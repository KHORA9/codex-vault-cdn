The sectional trouble that preceded\r\nthe Civil War, the war itself with all its attendant horrors and\r\nsacrifices, the abolition of slavery, the reconstruction measures,\r\nand the vast and unexampled progress of the republic in growth and\r\ndevelopment since the war, presented a topic worthy of a better\r\nhistorian than I am.  Still, as my life was interwoven with these\r\nevents, I concluded that it was better that I state my recollection\r\nof what I saw or heard or did in those stirring times rather than\r\nwhat I said.  Whether this conclusion was a wise one the reader must\r\njudge.  Egotism is a natural trait of mankind.  If it is exhibited\r\nin a moderate degree we pardon it with a smile; if it is excessive\r\nwe condemn it as a weakness.  The life of one man is but an atom,\r\nbut if it is connected with great events it shares in their dignity\r\nand importance.  Influenced by this reasoning I concluded to postpone\r\nthe publication of my speeches except so far as they are quoted or\r\ndescribed in these memoirs.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon their preparation the question arose whether\r\nthe book to be written was to be of my life, including ancestry\r\nand boyhood, or to be confined to the financial history of the\r\nUnited States with which I was mainly identified.  This was settled\r\nby the publishers, who were more interested in the number of copies\r\nthey could sell than in the finances of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery man has a theory of finance of his own, and is indifferent\r\nto any other.  At best the subject is a dry one.  Still, the problem\r\nof providing money to carry on the expensive operations of a great\r\nwar, and to provide for the payment of the vast debt created during\r\nthe war, was next in importance to the conduct of armies, and those\r\nwho were engaged in solving this problem were as much soldiers as\r\nthe men who were carrying muskets or commanding armies.  As one of\r\nthese I feel it my duty to present the measures adopted and to\r\nclaim for them such merit as they deserve.\r\n\r\nThese volumes do contain the true history of the chief financial\r\nmeasures of the United States government during the past forty\r\nyears.  My hope is that those who read them will be able to correct\r\nthe wild delusions of many honest citizens who became infected with\r\nthe \"greenback craze,\" or the \"free coinage of silver.\"\r\n\r\nMy chief regret is that the limit of these volumes did not permit\r\nme to extend my narrative to the memorable battles and marches of\r\nthe Civil War, nor to a more general notice of my associates who\r\ndistinguished themselves in civil life.  The omission of military\r\nnarrative is admirably compensated by the memoirs of the great\r\ncommanders on either side, and better yet by the vast collection\r\nand publication, by the United States, of the \"Records of the\r\nRebellion.\"  The attempt to include in these volumes my estimate\r\nof distinguished men still living who participated in the events\r\nnarrated would greatly extend them and might lead to injustice.\r\n\r\nOne of the fortunate results of the Civil War has been to diminish\r\nthe sectional prejudice that previously existed both in the north\r\nand in the south.  I would not check this tendency, but will gladly\r\ncontribute in every way possible to a hearty union of the people\r\nin all sections of our country, not only in matters of government,\r\nbut also in ties of good will, mutual respect and fraternity.  The\r\nexistence of slavery in some of the states was the cause of the\r\nwar, and its abolition was the most important result of the war.\r\nSo great a change naturally led to disorder and violence where\r\nslavery had existed, but this condition, it is believed, is passing\r\naway.  Therefore I have not entered in detail into the measures\r\nadopted as the result of the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nThis preface is hardly necessary, but I comply with the general\r\ncustom of adding at the beginning, instead of the end, an apology\r\nfor writing a book.  This seems to me to be the chief object of a\r\npreface, and I add to it an appeal for the kindly consideration of\r\nthe readers of these volumes.\r\n\r\n  John Sherman.\r\n  Mansfield, Ohio, August 30, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman\r\nDedham Street, Dedham, Essex County, England\r\nBirthplace of John Sherman at Lancaster, Ohio\r\nMr. Sherman at the Age of Nineteen\r\nCharles T.

It is\r\nvery common along the Rhine, and in different parts of the German\r\nEmpire.  It is there written Shearmann or Schurmann.  I found it\r\nin Frankfort and Berlin.  The English Shermans lived chiefly in\r\nEssex and Suffolk counties near the east coast, and in London.\r\nThe name appears frequently in local records.  One Sherman was\r\nexecuted for taking the unsuccessful side in a civil war.  It was\r\nnot until the beginning of the 16th century that any of the name\r\nassumed the arms, crest, and motto justified by their pride, property\r\nor standing.  The motto taken, \"Conquer Death by Virtue,\" is a\r\nrather meaningless phrase.  It is modest enough, and indicates a\r\nreligious turn of mind.  Nearly every family of the name furnished\r\na preacher.  A few members of it attained the dignity of knighthood.\r\nA greater number became landed property-holders, and more were\r\nengaged in trade in London.  Sir Henry Sherman was one of the\r\nexecutors of the will of Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby, May 23, 1521.\r\nWilliam Sherman, Esq., purchased Knightston in the time of Henry\r\nVIII; and a monument to him is in Ottery St. Mary, dated 1542.  As\r\na rule the family belonged to the middle class and were engaged in\r\nactive occupations, earning their own bread, with a strong sense of\r\ntheir rights and liberties as Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe principal family of the name in the 16th century were the\r\nShermans of Yaxley in the county of Suffolk, a full detail of which\r\nis given in Davy's Collections of that county.  Edmond Sherman,\r\nmy ancestor, was a member of this family.  He was born in 1585 and\r\nwas married to Judith Angier, May 26, 1611.  He resided at Dedham,\r\nEssex county, England, then a place of some importance.  He was a\r\nmanufacturer of cloth, a man of means and high standing.  He was\r\na Puritan, with all the faults and virtues of a sectary.  He resisted\r\nship-money and the tax unlawfully imposed on tonnage and poundage.\r\nHe had the misfortune to live at the time when Charles I undertook\r\nto dispense with Parliament, and to impose unlawful taxes and\r\nburdens upon the people of England, and when the privileges of the\r\nnobility were enforced with great severity by judges dependent upon\r\nthe crown.  He had three sons, John, baptized on the 4th of January,\r\n1614; Edmond, baptized June 18, 1616, and Samuel, baptized July\r\n12, 1618.  He had a nephew, known as \"Captain John,\" somewhat older\r\nthan his sons, who was an active man in 1634.\r\n\r\nAt this time the migration to Boston, caused chiefly by the tyranny\r\nof Charles I, was in active operation.  Hume, in his history, says:\r\n\r\n\"The Puritans, restrained in England, shipped themselves off for\r\nAmerica, and laid there the foundations of a government which\r\npossessed all the liberty, both civil and religious, of which they\r\nfound themselves bereaved in their native country.  But their\r\nenemies, unwilling that they should anywhere enjoy ease and\r\ncontentment, and dreading, perhaps, the dangerous consequences of\r\nso disaffected a colony, prevailed on the king to issue a proclamation,\r\ndebarring those devotees access, even into those inhospitable\r\ndeserts.  Eight ships, lying in the Thames, and ready to sail, were\r\ndetained by order of the council; and in there were embarked Sir\r\nArthur Hazelrig, John Hampden, John Pym, and Oliver Cromwell, who\r\nhad resolved, forever, to abandon their native country, and fly to\r\nthe other extremity of the globe; where they might enjoy lectures\r\nand discourses, of any length or form, which pleased them.  The\r\nking had afterward full leisure to repent this exercise of\r\nauthority.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that, influenced the same motives, Edmond Sherman\r\ndetermined to remove his family, with his nephew, \"Captain John,\"\r\nto Boston.  In one statement made in respect to them it is said\r\nthat the father and his three sons and nephew embarked for Boston,\r\nbut this is doubtful.  It is certain, however, that his son, Rev.\r\nJohn Sherman and his son Samuel, and his nephew \"Captain John,\"\r\ndid go to Boston in 1634.  It is quite as certain that if they were\r\naccompanied by their father and their brother Edmond, that the two\r\nlatter returned again to Dedham in 1636.  Edmond Sherman, senior,\r\nlived and died at Dedham.  One of his descendants, Rev. Henry Beers\r\nSherman, a few years ago visited Dedham and there found one of the\r\nchurch windows of stained glass bearing the initials of Edmond\r\nSherman as having been his gift, and the record shows that one of\r\nthe buttresses of the church was erected at his expense.  Mr. Henry\r\nBeers Sherman there saw the pupils of a free school, endowed by\r\nEdmond Sherman and still in operation, attending the church in\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nWhen in London, in the summer of 1889, I concluded to make a visit\r\nto \"the graves of my ancestors.\"  I examined Black's Universal\r\nAtlas to locate Dedham, but it was not to be found.  I made inquiries,\r\nbut could discover no one who knew anything about Dedham, and\r\nconcluded there was no such place, although I had often read of\r\nit.  I was compelled, therefore, to give up my visit.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar, a descendant, through his mother, of Roger Sherman\r\nof Revolutionary fame, was more fortunate or more persistent than\r\nI, for he subsequently found Dedham and verified the accounts we\r\nhad of our common ancestor, and procured photographs, copies of\r\nwhich I have, of the monument of Edmond Sherman, of the church near\r\nwhich he was buried, and of the handsome school building, still\r\ncalled \"the Sherman Library,\" that he had left by his will for the\r\nyouth of Dedham, with a sufficient annuity to support it.  Dedham\r\nis but two or three miles from Manningtree, a more modern town on\r\nthe line of railroad, which has substantially obscured the ancient\r\nand decayed village of Dedham.\r\n\r\nThe sexton of this church wrote General Sherman soon after he had\r\nbecome distinguished as a military leader, calling his attention\r\nto the neglected monument of his ancestor, Edmond Sherman, in the\r\nchurchyard, and asking a contribution for its repair.  The general\r\nsent a reply to the effect that, as his ancestor in England had\r\nreposed in peace under a monument for more than two centuries,\r\nwhile some of his more recent ancestors lay in unmarked graves, he\r\nthought it better to contribute to monuments for them here and\r\nleave to his English cousins the care of the monuments of their\r\ncommon ancestors in England.  This letter is highly prized by the\r\nsexton and has been shown to visitors, among others to Senator\r\nHoar, as a characteristic memento of General Sherman.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Sherman, \"Captain John,\" soon after his arrival in\r\nBoston, settled in Watertown, Mass., where he married and had a\r\nlarge family of children.  Among his descendants was Roger Sherman\r\nof the Revolution, by far the most distinguished man of the name.\r\nHe had the good fortune to contribute to and sign the three most\r\nimportant papers of American history, the \"Address to the King,\"\r\nthe \"Declaration of Independence\" and the \"Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\"  Among other descendants of Captain John Sherman\r\nwere Hon. Roger Minot Sherman, of New Haven, a nephew of Roger\r\nSherman, a distinguished lawyer and a leading participant in the\r\nHartford Convention.  William M. Evarts, George F. Hoar and Chauncey\r\nM. Depew are descendants of Roger Sherman or of his brother.\r\n\r\nRev. John Sherman, the eldest son of Edmond Sherman, was born on\r\nthe 26th of December, 1613, at Dedham, England.  He graduated at\r\nImmanuel College, Cambridge, left college a Puritan and came over\r\nto America in 1634, as above stated.  He preached his first sermon\r\nat Watertown, Massachusetts, under a tree, soon after his arrival\r\nin this country.  In a few weeks he went to New Haven, Connecticut,\r\nand preached in several places, but finally settled at Watertown,\r\nwhere he had a large family of children.  His numerous descendants\r\nare well distributed throughout the United States, but most of them\r\nin the State of New York.\r\n\r\nSamuel Sherman, the youngest son of Edmond Sherman, is the ancestor\r\nof the family to which I belong.  At the age of sixteen years he\r\ncame with his brother, Rev. John and his cousin \"Captain John,\" in\r\nApril, 1634, in the ship \"Elizabeth\" from Ipswich, and arrived in\r\nBoston in June, and for a time settled in Watertown, Massachusetts.\r\nHe afterward moved to Weathersfield, Connecticut, thence to Stamford\r\nand thence to Stratford.\r\n\r\nIn Cothron's \"History of Ancient Woodbury\" there are found full\r\ndetails of the life of Samuel Sherman and his numerous descendants\r\nto the present generation.  Of Samuel Sherman Mr. Cothron says:\r\n\r\n\"He was from Dedham, Essex county, England, came to this country\r\nin 1634, and previous to the date of the new plantation, at Woodbury,\r\nhad been a leading man in the colony of Connecticut.  He had assisted\r\nin the settlement of several other towns in the colony, and now\r\nundertook the same for Woodbury.  He had been a member of the Court\r\nof Assistants, or Upper House of the General Court, and Supreme\r\nJudicial Tribunal, for five or six years from 1663, and held various\r\noffices and appointments of honor and trust.  He is referred to in\r\nancient deeds and documents as the 'Worshipful Mr. Sherman.'  In\r\n1676 he was one of the commission for Stratford and Woodbury.\"\r\n\r\nThe order of succession of the descendants of Samuel Sherman, the\r\nancestor of the family to which I belong, is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  John Sherman, the fifth child of Samuel Sherman, was born at\r\nStratford, Conn., February 8, 1650.  He early moved to Woodbury.\r\nHe died December 13, 1730.\r\n\r\n2.  John Sherman 2nd, the fifth child of John, was baptized June,\r\n1687.  He married Hachaliah Preston, July 22, 1714.  He died 1727.\r\n\r\n3.  Daniel Sherman, the third child of John 2nd, was born August\r\n14, 1721, and died July 2, 1799.\r\n\r\n4.  Taylor Sherman, the sixth child of Daniel, was born in 1758.\r\nHe married Elizabeth Stoddard in 1787, and died in Connecticut May\r\n15, 1815.  His widow died at Mansfield, Ohio, August 1, 1848.\r\n\r\n5.  Charles Robert Sherman, the eldest child of Taylor, was born\r\nSeptember 26, 1788, married Mary Hoyt, of Norwalk, Conn., May 8,\r\n1810.  He died on the 24th of June, 1829.  His widow died at\r\nMansfield, Ohio, September 23, 1852.  The had eleven children, six\r\nsons and five daughters, all of whom lived to maturity.  I am the\r\neighth child of this family.\r\n\r\nThe names and dates of the birth of the children of my parents are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Charles Taylor Sherman . . . . . February 3, 1811.\r\n  Mary Elizabeth Sherman . . . . . April 21, 1812.\r\n  James Sherman  . . . . . . . . . December 10, 1814.\r\n  Amelia Sherman . . . . . . . . .

May 3, 1829.\r\n\r\nMr. Cothron, in his \"History of Ancient Woodbury,\" after referring\r\nto Samuel Sherman, makes this reference to his son John:\r\n\r\n\"The fame of his son John is particularly the property of the town.\r\nHe was distinguished, not only at home, but also in the colony.\r\nHe was Justice of the Quorum, or Associate County Judge, for forty-\r\nfour years from 1684; a Representative of the town for seventeen\r\nsessions, and Speaker of the Lower House in May and October, 1711,\r\nand Captain in the Militia, a high honor in those days.  He was\r\nthe first Judge of Probate for the District of Woodbury, from its\r\norganization in 1719, for nine years.  The District them comprised\r\nall of Litchfield county, and Woodbury in New Haven county.  He\r\nwas an assistant, or member of the Upper House, for ten years from\r\n1713.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman 2nd, does not seem to have taken any active part in\r\npublic affairs, and died before his father, at the age of forty.\r\nHis son Daniel, who lived to the age of eighty, covering the period\r\nof the Indian wars, the French Canadian war, and the war of the\r\nRevolution, took an active part in all the great events of that\r\nperiod.  Mr. Cothron says of him:\r\n\r\n\"Judge Daniel Sherman was perhaps the most distinguished man that\r\nhad arisen in the town previous to his day.  He was a descendant\r\nof Samuel Sherman, of Stratford, Connecticut, who emigrated to this\r\ncountry from England, in company with his brother, Rev. John Sherman,\r\nand his nephew, Captain John Sherman, ancestor of Hon. Roger Sherman.\r\nHe was a Justice of the Quorum for twenty-five years, and Judge of\r\nthe Litchfield County Court five years from 1786.  For sixteen\r\nyears he was Probate Clerk for the District of Woodbury, and Judge\r\nof that District thirty-seven years.  He represented his native\r\ntown in the General Assembly sixty-five semi-annual sessions,\r\nretaining the unbounded confidence of his fellow citizens.  This\r\nwas by far the longest period of time anyone has ever represented\r\nthe town.  He was a man of commanding powers of mind, of sterling\r\nintegrity, and every way qualified for the various public trusts\r\nconfided to this care.  He died at a good old age, full of honor,\r\nand was followed by the affectionate recollections of the inhabitants\r\nof the town, among whom he had so long lived.\"\r\n\r\nNo portion of the people of the United States took a more decisive\r\npart in the Revolutionary contest of 1775 than those of Connecticut.\r\nThe people of Woodbury caught the prevailing spirit, and, as early\r\nas September 20, 1774, had a public meeting and made patriotic\r\nresolves, and entered into associations for defense.  Daniel Sherman,\r\nthen fifty-four years old, presided at this meeting and was appointed\r\npresident of the association of the delegates.  Among other duties\r\nthey were to perform, was to ascertain whether any persons within\r\nthe limits of the town were hostile to the objects of the association,\r\nand in that case they, using the spelling of the time, were to\r\n\r\n\"Cause the truth of the case to be published in the Gazette, to\r\nthe End that all such foes to ye Rights of British americai may be\r\npublikly known and universially Comtemned as enemies to american\r\nLiberty and thensforth we Do bind ourselves to break off all Dealings\r\nWith Such Persons and also will all Persons in other Towns and\r\nCitys who shall be found Guilty as above Expressed, and that it\r\nshall be ye Duty and Business of the sd Comtee to Receive and\r\nCommunicate all Such intelligence as they shall judge to be conducive\r\nto ye Peace and Tranquility of this and the Neighboring Colonies;\r\nthis meeting presents their most thankfull acknowledgments to those\r\ntruly Honourable and Worthy Gentlemen members of ye Congress who\r\nhave Shewn themselves able advocates of the civil and Religious\r\nliberty of the american Colonys.\r\n\r\n\"Voated, that the doings of this meeting be Recorded by the Town\r\nClerk, and a Copy thereof be forthwith sent to one of the printers\r\nof the Connecticut Journal to be published accordingly.  The Whole\r\nof the above Written as voated in said Meeting.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the \"Committee of Inspection\" of thirty, appointed\r\nat the beginning of the war.  On the 12th of April, 1784, they\r\nresolved as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Voted, that those persons who joined the enemies of the United\r\nStates in the course of the late Civil war of what description\r\nsoever are denyed a residence in this Town from this date until\r\nthe Genll Assembly shall grant them full liberty for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held on the 3d of April, 1777, at which Daniel Sherman\r\nwas the Moderator, it was:\r\n\r\n\"Voated, that Each Able Bodied Effective man, who hath or shall\r\nvoluntarily Inlist into the Continental Army in such way and Manner\r\ntoward makeing the Quota of this Town for the space of Three years,\r\nor during the war shall be Intitled to Receive out of the publick\r\nTreasury of the Town the sum of Twenty Shillings Lawful money, as\r\nan Addition to Each month's Wages he shall continue in the service,\r\nto be paid to him, or to his order, at the End of Each six month's\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nThis was kept up during the war.  Provision was made for a Council\r\nof Safety, appointed annually by the Assembly, of from nine to\r\nfourteen of the most distinguished men in the state, to aid the\r\ngovernor in the organization and conduct of troops, of which Daniel\r\nSherman, his cousin Roger Sherman, Benjamin Huntington, and other\r\ndistinguished men were members.  This committee was frequently in\r\nsession and the most responsible, arduous and difficult details of\r\nthe service were confided to its care.  It was shown that during\r\nthe war Daniel Sherman contributed provisions to soldier's families\r\nto the value of 2,718 pounds, 7 shillings and 8 pence.  It would\r\nseem from the following anecdote told of Daniel Sherman, that some\r\nof his neighbors thought he had enjoyed his full share of honor:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman was a representative at the May session of the General\r\nAssembly in 1791, and, it is related, desired to be elected to the\r\nOctober session of the same year, in order to make the full number\r\nof thirty-three years that he would have then represented the town.\r\nBut at the time of the election for the October session, the\r\nModerator of the meeting happened to think that he had his share\r\nof honors, and when he made proclamation that the ballot-box was\r\nopen for the reception of votes, remarked in a loud tone of voice,\r\n'Gentlemen, the box is now open; you will please to bring in your\r\nballots for him whom you _will have_ for your first representative\r\n--_Honorable Daniel Sherman, of course!_  This simple incident gave\r\na change to the popular current, and on counting the votes it was\r\nfound that Honorable Nathaniel Smith was elected, instead of Mr.\r\nSherman.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor Sherman, my grandfather, the son of Judge Daniel Sherman,\r\nwas born in 1758.  He was married in 1787 to Elizabeth Stoddard\r\nand removed to Norwalk, Connecticut, where he lived during the\r\nremainder of his life.  He died on the 15th of May, 1815.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother was born at Woodbury, Connecticut, on the 14th of\r\nJune, 1767.  She lived to a good old age and died at Mansfield,\r\nOhio, on the 1st of August, 1848.  She was a remarkable woman in\r\nmany respects, a Puritan of the strictest faith, of large mold,\r\nbeing nearly six feet tall, and well proportioned.  She was a\r\ngranddaughter of Rev. Anthony Stoddard, a man whose history strikingly\r\npresents the peculiar characteristics of life in Connecticut during\r\nthe 18th century.  The contract between the church and town of\r\nWoodbury and Mr. Stoddard, for employment as pastor, commences as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"At a lawfull Towns-meeting ye 13th of August, 1700, in ordr to ye\r\nsettling of ye Reverend mr. Anthony Stoddard amongst us, in ye work\r\nof ye ministry.  And for his encouragement so to do;\r\n\r\n\"It was voted and agreed to allow him, as Maytenance in ye Work of\r\nye Ministry, seventy pounds per Anuu, in provision pay, or to his\r\nSatisfaction, in Case of Faylure of provision pay.  By provision\r\npay, is intended, whet, pease, indian corn & pork, proportionally:\r\nAlso fire wood:\r\n\r\n\"We do also promise, to build him an house here in Woodberry of\r\nknown Demensions; yt is to say, the Carpetners work & Masons work;\r\nhee providing nayles and glass; by building ye sd house is intended,\r\ndoors, floures, fitting up and playstering and partitions, finishing\r\nit, as also a well.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow many other mutual stipulations, to which was added a\r\nsupplemental agreement as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Since wch time at a Lawfull Towns-meeting ye 25th of Novembr,\r\n1700, It was Voted and agreedyt ye abovesd specices for mr Stoddard's\r\nyearly maytenance bee levyed at ye prices following:  Wheat at 4s\r\n6d per Bush: pork at 3d pr lb:  Indian Corn 2s 6d per Bush:  Pease\r\nthree shillings per Bushll:  And these prices for this yeare ye\r\nTown will not vary from for ye future Exterordinary providences\r\ninterposing being exceapted.\r\n\r\n\"Recorded from ye originalls pr Jon Minor, Recorder, March, 1700-\r\n1701.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this contract Mr. Stoddard served his congregation for sixty\r\nyears, and died September 7, 1760, in his eighty-third year, and\r\nthe sixty-first of his ministry.  He was educated at Harvard College\r\nand graduated in 1679.  Mr. Cothron, in 1872, says of him:\r\n\r\n\"He was at the same time minister, lawyer and physician.  Like many\r\nof the early ministers of the colony, he prepared himself for the\r\npractice of physic, that he might administer to the wants of the\r\nbody, as well as those of the mind.  In this capacity he was often\r\ncalled.  The only person the author has found who ever saw him,\r\nwas Deacon Amos Squire, of Roxbury, who died two or three years\r\nago, aged ninety-nine, and who recollected having seen him when a\r\nlad about eight years of age, while on a visit in this capacity to\r\nhis father, who had received a severe wound from an ax.  He had\r\nalso done what other ministers did not, and that was to perfect\r\nhimself in legal knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the pastor of a church in those days\r\nwas in quite a different position than one now, when the constitution\r\nguarantees to every one liberty to worship God according to the\r\ndictates of his conscience.  The Congregational mode of worship\r\nwas then adopted and established by law in Connecticut, but it was\r\nprovided that all sober orthodox persons dissenting therefrom\r\nshould, on representing it to the General Court, be allowed to\r\nworship in their own way.  Such a privilege, however, was regarded\r\nwith distrust.  Our fathers who desired religious freedom and\r\nperiled all for it in the wilderness, had not anticipated that they\r\nwould speedily have an opportunity to extend that toleration to\r\nothers which in the fatherland they had in vain sought for themselves.\r\nThe town church was, therefore, in substance, the only church, and\r\nthe preacher was the autocrat of the place.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoddard was not only a preacher, lawyer and doctor, but he\r\nwas also a fighter.  In 1707 an expedition was made by the French\r\nand Indians against New England, which created general alarm\r\nthroughout the country.  Woodbury was exposed to the raids made by\r\nthe Indians, and suspicions were entertained that the neighboring\r\ntribes would join the French and Indians in their foray.  During\r\nthe continuance of this war, on one Sabbath evening, after the\r\nconclusion of the services at church, while he was walking in his\r\ngarden, he discovered an Indian skulking among the surrounding\r\ntrees and bushes.  Apparently without noticing the movements of\r\nthe Indian, he contrived to re-enter his house, and obtained his\r\ngun.  After playing the same game of skulking with his adversary\r\nfor a while, Mr. Stoddard got a fair view of him, discharged his\r\npiece, and the Indian fell among the bushes.  He dared not investigate\r\nfarther that night, but having quietly given the alarm, the\r\ninhabitants sought their palisaded houses for the night.  Early in\r\nthe morning he discovered another red foe, in the vicinity of his\r\ncompanion, and whom he also laid low with his musket.  By this time\r\nthe people had assembled, and after the country was scoured in all\r\ndirections for several hours, and no other savages were found, the\r\nalarm subsided.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving my Woodbury ancestors, who resided there nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty years, I wish to relate my first visit to Woodbury.\r\nI was at West Point, as one of the Board of Visitors, one Saturday\r\nin June, 1873, when I concluded to respond to an invitation I had\r\nreceived, and go to Woodbury and spend the Sabbath there.  I did\r\nso and found, as I had anticipated, beautiful valleys with picturesque\r\nhills, a rural air and a quiet, peaceful, Sunday outlook.  I knew\r\nno one except Hon. William Cothron, and him only by correspondence.\r\nI believe he was superintendent of the Sunday school; but, at all\r\nevents, upon my presenting myself, and stating my desire to explore\r\nWoodbury, he kindly consented, and went with me.  I located many\r\nof the most interesting objects in the town.  The large, well-built\r\nstone house of Daniel Sherman was still standing, made after the\r\nusual pattern, two stories high with a lean-to roof in the rear,\r\nand with low ceilings.  He had lived there during most of his active\r\nlife, and had entertained Washington and Lafayette, when they at\r\ndifferent times visited the French vessels at Newport.  The fortified\r\nhouse of Rev. Anthony Stoddard was in a good state of preservation,\r\nwith its projecting eaves and loop holes for defense.  We visited\r\nthe old church and graveyard, and drove southward to what were\r\ncalled the \"Sherman settlements.\"  Evidently the comparatively few\r\nfamilies in Woodbury were in a state of comfort as they were found\r\nto be living in good houses and drawing, no doubt, an income from\r\ninvestments in the great and growing West.\r\n\r\nOn that quiet Sabbath day the village of Woodbury recalled to me\r\nMr. John H. Bryant's description of his native village:\r\n\r\n  \"There lies a village in a peaceful vale,\r\n   With sloping hills and waving woods around,\r\n   Fenced from the blasts.  There never ruder gale\r\n   Bows the tall grass that covers all the ground;\r\n   And planted shrubs are there, and cherish'd flowers,\r\n   And a bright verdure born of gentle showers.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently I again visited Woodbury with General Sherman.  Mr.\r\nCothron was still there and was very kind to us.  It seemed to me\r\nthat the old place had run down a little, that the walks were not\r\nso clean, the grass was not as fresh in the fields, and evidently\r\nthe graveyards had lost some of their monuments, but a prominent\r\none had been erected in the churchyard to Rev. Anthony Stoddard,\r\nto which General Sherman had contributed.  We heard of no one of\r\nour name in Woodbury, but when General Sherman saw an old sign,\r\n\"Sherman's Tannery,\" he said that he believed he had at last found\r\nsome tangible evidence of the residence of our fathers in Woodbury;\r\nthat Sherman had been a good honest tanner no doubt, and that was\r\nthe most that could be said of any one.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, my grandfather, Taylor Sherman, and his wife,\r\nElizabeth Stoddard, moved from Woodbury to Norwalk, where he\r\npracticed his profession as a lawyer.  He attained a good position\r\nas such, and for many years he was a Judge of Probate.  He became\r\nearly associated with the proprietors of the half million acres of\r\nland lying in the western part of the Western Reserve in Ohio,\r\ncalled \"Sufferers' Land.\"\r\n\r\nIn the period immediately before and after the adoption of the\r\nconstitution several of the states laid claim to western lands,\r\nfounded upon grants by James I, the chief of which were the claims\r\nof Virginia to the region north and west of the Ohio River, and\r\nthe claim of Connecticut to all the land lying west of Pennsylvania\r\nto the South Seas and north of the 41st parallel of latitude.\r\nThese claims were finally compromised by Congress granting to\r\nVirginia all the land lying between the Scioto and the Miami Rivers\r\nin Ohio, and to Connecticut the land in Ohio north of the 41st\r\nparallel, extending westward of Pennsylvania one hundred and twenty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War the coasts of Connecticut had been\r\nsubjected to several raids by the British and Tories, and several\r\ntowns, including Norwalk, Greenwich, Fairfield, Danbury, New Haven\r\nand New London, had been burned.  Indemnity had been proposed, but\r\nthe state was in no condition to pay such losses.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800, the State of Connecticut granted to her citizens,\r\nwho were sufferers by fire during the Revolutionary War, a half\r\nmillion acres of land, lying within the State of Ohio, which was\r\nto be taken off the west part of what was called the \"Western\r\nConnecticut Reserve,\" now embraced in the counties of Huron and\r\nErie.  By an act of the legislature of the State of Ohio, passed\r\nin 1803, the sufferers were incorporated under the name of \"The\r\nproprietors of the half million acres of land, lying south of Lake\r\nErie, called 'Sufferers' Land.'\"  The affairs of this company, by\r\nthat act, were to be managed by a Board of Directors which, among\r\nother things, was authorized to locate and survey said half million\r\nacres of land, and partition it among the different claimants.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of November, 1805, Taylor Sherman was appointed\r\nby the Board of Directors an agent to survey the above tract of\r\nland, and, on the 16th day of December, of the same year, he entered\r\ninto a contract with John McLane and James Clarke, Jr., to survey,\r\nor have surveyed, said tract.  Taylor Sherman visited the fire\r\nlands, and fully performed the duty imposed upon him.  He also\r\npurchased a considerable tract of this land in Sherman township,\r\nHuron county, which was the foundation of the little fortune which\r\nhe left to his widow and children.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Western Reserve, especially the western part of\r\nit, was at that time in the possession of the Indians, who soon\r\nafterwards engaged in open warfare with the white settlers.  Surveys,\r\nespecially along the shores of Lake Erie, were extremely difficult,\r\nowing to extensive bayous and swamps, but the surveys were made\r\nwhere practicable, and where lines could not be run, straight lines\r\nwere drawn on the map, and the contents estimated.  This gave rise\r\nto long litigation, one case being reported in the 13th Volume of\r\nOhio Supreme Court Reports.\r\n\r\nThe gift of Connecticut to the sufferers was a wise and liberal\r\none, and after the War of 1812 it led to the migration to the\r\ncounties of Huron and Erie of a great number of persons from the\r\ntowns of Norwalk, Greenwich, Danbury, New Haven and New London.\r\nThe losses of the sufferers in these different towns had been\r\ncarefully examined and stated, and the sufferers were allowed land\r\nin proportion to their losses.  The formidable list of these\r\nsufferers is a striking proof of the savage and destructive manner\r\nin which the Revolutionary War was conducted by the British troops.\r\nThe whole Western Reserve at the beginning of the 19th century was\r\na wilderness, with not a single white inhabitant.  The census of\r\n1820, however, showed that it then contained a population of 58,608,\r\nwhile that of 1890 showed a population of 678,561.  Of these a\r\nlarger number and proportion were descendants of Connecticut parents\r\nthan are most inhabitants of that state.  The industries, commerce,\r\nwealth and intelligence of this region are not excelled by any\r\ncommunity of the same size anywhere else in the country.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the condition of this region in 1812, it may\r\nbe worth while to here record a truthful anecdote of Daniel Sherman,\r\nthe son of Taylor Sherman, and whom we knew as \"Uncle Dan.\"  In\r\nthe spring of 1812, when twenty-two years of age, he was sent by\r\nhis father to make improvements on his land in Huron county, by\r\nbuilding a log cabin and opening a clearing.  He had with him a\r\nhired man of the name of John Chapman, who was sent to Milan, twelve\r\nmiles away, to get a grist of corn ground, it being the nearest\r\nand only mill in the county.  Either on the way there, or while\r\nreturning, Chapman was killed by the Indians.  Uncle Dan did not\r\nhear of this until the next day, when, with a knapsack on his back,\r\nhe started for Mansfield, forty miles away.  For thirty miles there\r\nwas a dense and unbroken forest without a settler.  He arrived at\r\na blockhouse, six miles from Mansfield, but concluded that was not\r\nstrong enough to protect him.  He then went to Mansfield, where\r\nthey had a better blockhouse, but he heard so many stories of\r\nIndians that he did not feel safe there, and walked thence to his\r\nbrother's house in Lancaster, about seventy-five miles away, through\r\nan almost continuous forest.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1813, Taylor Sherman was appointed, by President\r\nMadison, Collector of Internal Revenue for the Second District of\r\nConnecticut.  He enjoyed the office but a short time and died, as\r\nalready stated, on the 15th day of May, 1815.\r\n\r\nA sketch of my mother and father will throw some light upon the\r\nlives of their children, but it is a delicate task to write of\r\none's parents.  As I was but six years old when my father died I\r\nhave only a dim recollection of him, but materials for an interesting\r\nsketch of his brief but active career are abundant.  I know of no\r\ncitizen of Ohio of whom more anecdotes have been told, or whose\r\ngeneral and social life has been more highly appreciated, or whose\r\npopularity has been more marked, than that of my father.  During\r\nthe early years of my life at the bar I met many of the older\r\nlawyers, contemporary with my father, and they all spoke of him in\r\nthe highest praise, and generally had some incident to tell of him\r\nthat happened in the days of the \"Stirrup Court.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Robert Sherman, my father, was born in Norwalk, Connecticut,\r\nSeptember 26, 1788, the eldest son of Judge Taylor Sherman and\r\nElizabeth Stoddard.  He received the best educational advantages\r\nof his day, and, when fully prepared, commenced the study of law\r\nin the associated offices of his father and the Hon. Judge Chapman.\r\nHe was admitted to the bar in 1810, and on May 8, of that year,\r\nmarried Mary Hoyt, also of Norwalk, who had grown up with him from\r\nchildhood.  He could not go into the northern part where his father's\r\nland lay, as it was then roamed over by hostile Indians, but followed\r\nthe usual route to Ohio by Pittsburg and Wheeling to Zanesville.\r\nHe located at Lancaster, but returned to Norwalk, Connecticut, in\r\nthe fall of 1810.  In 1811 he returned to Lancaster, accompanied\r\nby his wife.  Ohio was then a frontier state, and in large portions\r\nof its territory an unbroken wilderness.  The way to it from their\r\nNew England home was far and weary, beset with many hardships and\r\nexposed to great dangers.  My father and mother were obliged to\r\njourney the greater part of this distance on horseback, alternately\r\ncarrying their infant child upon a pillow before them.  I only\r\nadvert to these incidents as they illustrate the self-reliant\r\ncharacter of the man, and the brave, confiding trust of his wife.\r\nThe little boy they carried upon the pillow, then their only son,\r\nwas Charles Taylor Sherman.\r\n\r\nSoon after their arrival in Lancaster my father took a leading part\r\nin the measures of defense against the British and Indians.  I find\r\nin an old and weather-beaten newspaper of Lancaster, Ohio, called\r\nthe \"Independent Press,\" that on the 16th of April, 1812, at a\r\nmeeting of the first regiment of the first brigade of the third\r\ndivision of the militia of Ohio, assembled at Lancaster for the\r\npurpose of raising a company of volunteers to march immediately to\r\nDetroit, my father, then major of that regiment, made a very\r\neffective address to the regiment, the result of which was the\r\nvoluntary enlistment of the company required from Fairfield county.\r\nHe was then twenty-four years of age, and as this address is short,\r\nand is the best evidence of his mental qualities, and of the standing\r\nhe had so early attained among the hardy settlers of that section,\r\nmostly from Pennsylvania, I here insert a portion of it:\r\n\r\n\"_Fellow Soldiers:_--The crisis has arrived in which your country\r\ncalls upon you, her constitutional guardians, to rally round her\r\nstandard and to defend her rights and liberties--you are this day\r\nassembled to declare whether you will voluntarily answer this call\r\nor not.  Fellow soldiers, the general of brigade and at whose\r\ncommand and in whose name I now address you, cannot help but believe\r\nthat in this regiment which he once had the honor, personally, to\r\ncommand, those choice spirits are to be found, that will not for\r\na moment hesitate to come forward and give the answer to their\r\ncountry's call.\r\n\r\n\"You are not called upon to guard a tyrant's throne, or to enslave\r\na nation of freemen, neither are your exertions required to redress\r\na fancied wrong, or to revenge a supposed insult; but you are called\r\nupon to preserve your own dwellings from the flames--your families\r\nfrom destruction.  Neither are you requested to go unprotected nor\r\nunprovided;--everything that the patriot soldier could possibly\r\nwish will be furnished you by the government--food complete and\r\nsufficient for the necessities or conveniences of life--compensation\r\nfor your clothing,--arms of the best quality will be placed in your\r\nhands, which will be generously given you if you do, as I know you\r\nwill, your duty.\r\n\r\n\"Should you chance to be disabled in the service, a pension will\r\nbe given you that will enable you to live in comfort and in ease;\r\nor should the fortune of war number you with those brave and gallant\r\npatriots that fearlessly poured out their life's blood upon the\r\nheights of Bunker, the plains of Saratoga, or at the siege of\r\nYorktown--your families shall not be left unprotected or unprovided;\r\na generous and faithful government has promised that one hundred\r\nand sixty acres of land shall be given to your heirs, the more than\r\nmeans of existence, the means of every comfort that can render that\r\nexistence desirable.\r\n\r\n\"These, then, fellow soldiers, are the terms upon which sixty-four\r\nof you are requested to draw your swords, shoulder your arms and\r\nmarch to Detroit to defend the frontiers of your own territory.\r\nAnd from these columns are there not more than this small number\r\nthat would rush upon even certain death at their country's call?\r\n\r\n\"The services required of you will not be arduous--'tis not that\r\nyou should invade the territory of a distant enemy--'tis not that\r\nyou should march far from your homes to fight battles in which you\r\nare not, and which you do not feel yourselves, interested; but it\r\nis to prevent the hostile foot of a foe from invading your territory\r\n--it is to guard the sacred altar of your liberties, cemented by\r\nthe blood of your fathers, from the profanation of a tyrant's\r\npolluting touch--it is to guard your dwellings, your friends, your\r\nfamilies, your all, from the desolating warfare of a fell savage\r\nfoe--it is that the midnight and sleeping couch of our infants may\r\nnot be awakened to death by the tremendous yell of an Indian warwhoop\r\n--it is that the gray hairs of our fathers may not become the bloody\r\ntrophies of a cruel and insidious foe.  Cruelty and a thirst for\r\nblood are the inmates of an Indian's bosom, and in the neighborhood\r\nof two contending powers they are never peaceful.  If the strong\r\nhand of power does not bend them down they will raise the tomahawk\r\nand bare the scalping knife for deeds of blood and horror:  The\r\npurity of female innocence, the decrepitude of age, the tenderness\r\nof infancy afford no security against the murderous steel of a\r\nhostile Indian: to guard against the probable incursions of bands\r\nof these murderers, I will not call them by the dignified name of\r\nwarriors, are you called upon to arm: and who in such a cause would\r\nrefuse to march or to bleed?  And who would refuse to protect the\r\nscattered settlements on our frontiers--the humble cottage and its\r\npeaceful inhabitants?--Who would refuse to guard our fields from\r\ndesolation, our villages from destruction, or our towns from ruin?\r\n--None, in whom there is a spark of patriot valor.\r\n\r\n\"But, fellow soldiers, you may be called upon the meet the legions\r\nof Great Britain; every appearance indicates a state of approaching\r\nhostilities--year after year has insult been added to insult--injury\r\nhas followed injury with rapid strides, and every breeze comes\r\nladen with its tale of wrongs, and while we have borne their injuries\r\nand their insults our government has endeavored, but in vain, to\r\nreconcile our differences by amicable negotiation.\r\n\r\n\"The cup of our wrongs is full, and the voice of an indignant people\r\ndemands redress and revenge by every means in our power; 'tis that\r\nvoice that calls upon you to arm and meet the hosts of England.\r\n\r\n\"Do you fear the event of the contest?  Call but to mind the period\r\nof '76, without a government, without friends, without armies,\r\nwithout men, without money, our fathers dared to resist her\r\naggressions upon our liberties; she determined to enslave us, and\r\na hardy band of freemen resolved on death rather than slavery,\r\nencountered and conquered her boasted legions, established our\r\nindependence and left it as their richest legacy for us to maintain:\r\nand do we, their sons, possessing all the advantages that we could\r\nwish, all that they were deprived of, do we fear the contest when\r\nhalf the world is confederate against her?  Where is the spirit of\r\nour fathers that urged them to battle and to victory?  Is there no\r\nlatent spark of patriot ardor that the wrongs and indignities of\r\nour country will kindle into a flame?  Is there no thirst in our\r\nbosoms for glory?  Is it nothing for your names to be enrolled on\r\nthe list of fame?  Does it rouse no generous and noble feelings in\r\nyour breasts to be a guardian shield and avenging sword to your\r\ncountry?  Are the grateful thanks of your countrymen and posterity\r\nno inducement to valorous acts?\r\n\r\n\"Go then, fellow soldiers, assist to shield your country from the\r\ndestruction of an internal warfare, awake to honor and to glory,\r\nrouse the native courage of an American freeman and march to deeds\r\nof valor!\r\n\r\n\"Let the wings of fame come laden with the tale of your honors,\r\nand bring joy to your mothers' hearts, and the pride of valorous\r\ndeeds to your fathers' bosoms; then shall your country reward and\r\nbless you--posterity shall venerate your names, the world shall\r\nown you as the constituent guardians of liberty and the bulwark of\r\nyour nation's freedom!\"\r\n\r\nI presume the soldiers enlisted at Lancaster were a part of the\r\narmy infamously surrendered by General Hull on the 16th of August,\r\n1812.  This event opened up the whole of the then western states\r\nand territories to the inroads of the British and Indians, but was\r\nbrilliantly compensated by the splendid victory of Commodore Perry\r\nat the battle of Lake Erie, on the 10th of September, 1813, in\r\nwhich he destroyed the British fleet and announced his victory in\r\nthe stirring words, \"We have met the enemy, and they are ours!\"\r\nThis was followed by the complete triumph of General Harrison in\r\nthe battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813, in which Tecumseh was\r\nkilled, and the power of the British and Indians in that portion\r\nof the field of operations practically destroyed.\r\n\r\nMy father was appointed by Mr. Madison, on the 9th of November,\r\n1813, as Collector of Internal Revenue for the Third District of\r\nOhio.  He was then engaged in the active practice of his profession.\r\nHe was required to employ deputies in each of the counties of\r\nFairfield, Pickaway, Madison, Franklin, Delaware, and Knox to\r\ncollect internal revenue taxes, when assessed.  He took great care\r\nin the selection of his deputies, and in all cases required bonds,\r\nwith security, from each deputy.  At this period the only money in\r\nOhio was local bank paper money.  No silver or gold coins could be\r\nhad, and the purchasing power of notes varied with the success or\r\ndefeat of our armies in the field.  Internal taxes were imposed on\r\ndistilled spirits, on the retailing of spirits, on salt, sugar,\r\ncarriages, sales at auction, a stamp duty of one per cent. on bank\r\nnotes, on all notes discounted by a bank, and on inland bills of\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly shown by the papers on file in the treasury department\r\nthat Mr. Sherman exercised the utmost care in the collection of\r\nthese taxes through his deputies.  No difficulty seems to have\r\noccurred until July, 1817, when the government, without previous\r\nnotice, refused to take the paper then in circulation in Ohio, but\r\ndemanded notes of the Bank of the United States, or its branches,\r\none of which was located at Chillicothe.  This left upon the hands\r\nof his deputies a large amount of money that soon became utterly\r\nworthless.  The system of local banking failed and the loss fell\r\nupon the holders of notes, and, largely, upon the collectors of\r\ninternal revenue and their deputies.  Among my father's deputies\r\nthe principal one seems to have been Peter Apple, of Pickaway\r\ncounty, who at the time of his appointment held a county office,\r\nwas postmaster, and a justice of the peace.  He was a leading man,\r\nof high character and standing, and supposed to be of considerable\r\nwealth.  In 1817 he became embarrassed and insolvent, and was\r\nremoved from his position as deputy.  His bonds proved worthless,\r\nand the whole loss and liability fell upon my father.  This, with\r\nother losses occurring through the failure of other deputies, was\r\nthe most unfortunate event of his life.  His correspondence with\r\nthe Internal Revenue Bureau shows that he exercised the utmost care\r\nin keeping and reporting his accounts, and the difficulties and\r\nlosses he sustained in converting local bills into such notes as\r\nthe government would receive in payment of taxes.  It is clearly\r\nshown that the loss was not caused by any failure or neglect on\r\nhis part.  In like circumstances, under the existing law, Congress\r\nhas, in all cases where due diligence on the part of the collector\r\nhas been proven, relieved the collector.  My father declined to\r\nmake any appeal for such relief, but applied the proceeds of all\r\nhis property, and a large part of his earnings, to make good, as\r\nfar as he could, the defalcations of his deputies.  This loss was\r\na great embarrassment for him and his family during his life.  It\r\ndid not affect his standing, either at home or with the government,\r\nbut it deprived him of many comforts, and his family of advantages\r\nand opportunities for education which they otherwise would have had.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1815 my father was notified of the illness of his\r\nfather in Norwalk, and immediately went to Connecticut, but, owing\r\nto the nature of the long journey, did not arrive until after his\r\nfather's death.  The will of Taylor Sherman gave to his wife, and\r\ndaughter Elizabeth, all his real and personal estate in the State\r\nof Connecticut, subject to the payment of his debts, which were\r\nvery small.  He bequeathed to his two sons, Charles Sherman and\r\nDaniel Sherman, ceratin lands in the town of Sherman, county of\r\nHuron, Ohio, being part of the \"Sufferers' Lands.\"  The remainder\r\nof his property lying in the State of Ohio he gave equally to his\r\nwife and children.  The estate was soon settled, and in the following\r\nyear, 1816, my grandmother and her daughter, Elizabeth, moved to\r\nOhio and became a part of the family of my father.\r\n\r\nUnder the old constitution of Ohio prior to 1850, the Supreme Court\r\nwas composed of four judges.  They met at Columbus in the winter\r\nto hold the court of last resort, but at other seasons they divided\r\ninto circuit courts composed of two judges, and went from county\r\nto county attended by a bevy of the leading lawyers of the state,\r\nall mounted on horseback and always ready for fun or frolic.  I\r\ngladly acknowledge that I have received many a kindness, and much\r\naid in business as well as political and social life, from the\r\nkindly memory of my father.  I shrink from writing of his personal\r\ntraits and genial nature, but insert, instead, brief extracts from\r\na sketch of him written, in 1872, as a part of a local history of\r\nFairfield county, Ohio, by General William J. Reese, who knew him\r\nintimately.  General Reese says:\r\n\r\n\"Established permanently at Lancaster in the prosecution of his\r\nprofession, the subject of this sketch rapidly rose to eminence as\r\na polished and eloquent advocate, and as a judicious, reliable\r\ncounsellor at law--indeed, in the elements of mind necessary to\r\nbuild up and sustain such a reputation, few men were his equals,\r\nand fewer still his superiors, in the State of Ohio or out of it.\r\nBut it was not only in the higher region of legal attainments that\r\nhe gained superiority; his mind was enriched with choice classic\r\ncultivation also.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Sherman not only mastered the intricacies of Coke and\r\nLittleton, but, as I have stated, he made himself familiar with\r\nwhatever was worthy of reading outside the books of law, and was\r\ntherefore fitted to shine in the domain of general literature as\r\nwell as in the realm of technical jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n\"During the pioneer years of Ohio its lawyers were obliged to\r\nperform extensive circuits to practice their profession; they were\r\naccustomed to accompany the courts from county to county, and in\r\nthis way to traverse an extent of country which, being uncalled\r\nfor at present, would appear fabulous in statement and difficult\r\nto realize.\r\n\r\n\"Those early days also commemorated the warmest personal friendships\r\nin the profession, and, indeed, this could hardly have been otherwise,\r\nas they compelled its members into the closest habitual companionship.\r\nThey rode together in the same primitive style, their saddle-bags\r\nstuffed with papers, documents, briefs, law-books, clothing, and,\r\nperadventure, some creature delectation also.  They were exposed\r\nin common to the same inclemencies and impediments of travel, they\r\nlodged together at the same inns or taverns, messed at the same\r\ntable, slept in the same rooms, and were not unfrequently coerced\r\nby twos into the same bed.  Free, jovial, genial, manly, and happy\r\ntimes they were, when, after a hard-fought field-day of professional\r\nantagonisms in court, the evening hours were crowded with social\r\namenities, and winged with wit and merriment, with pathos, sentiment\r\nand song.\r\n\r\n\"If the sayings and doings at the festive evenings of the early\r\nOhio bar could be collected, there would be materials in rich\r\nabundance from which a sympathetic and facile pen could compile a\r\nvolume of equal piquancy and sentimental refinement of patriotic\r\ndetail and humor, that alternate the pages of Sir Jonah Barrington,\r\nor any other winsome work of the kind.  This will not be questioned\r\nfor a moment when it is remembered that Henry Clay, Lewis Cass,\r\nPhilip Doddridge, Willis Silliman, David K. Este, and Charles\r\nHammond were frequent participants; that Philoman Beecher, William\r\nW. Irvin, Thomas Ewing, William Stanberry, Benjamin Tappan, John\r\nM. Goodenow, Jacob Parker, Orris Parrish, and Charles Goddard\r\nhabitually contributed to their entertainment, and that these were\r\noften signalized with the hilarious fun of Creighton and the quaint\r\ndrolleries of Douglas.  At these symposiums of recreation, and they\r\nwere held whenever the courts used to meet, Charles R. Sherman was\r\nalways the most welcome of companions, and contributed his full\r\nshare even to the ambrosial feasts,\r\n\r\n  'When all such clustering portions had\r\n   As made their frolic wild, not mad.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus endowed and so associated, he became a leading and a popular\r\npeople's lawyer, from the Ohio River to our northern lake.\r\n\r\n\"In 1823 he was elected by the legislature to the bench of the\r\nSupreme Court of Ohio, and perhaps the only man in the state who\r\ndoubted his ability for this high position was himself.  He told\r\nthe writer of these lines when speaking on the subject of his\r\nappointment, that he assumed its duties with great personal diffidence\r\nand apprehension.  He feared that he lacked the ripe experience of\r\nyears necessary to hear and determine cases of magnitude in a court\r\nof the last resort.  His official associates were Calvin Pease,\r\nJacob Burnet, and Peter Hitchcock, and these are names of renown\r\nin the judicial history of Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Sherman upon the bench fully realized the large expectations\r\nof his professional friends and the public.\r\n\r\n\"His written opinions, published in 'Hammond's Reports of the\r\nSupreme Court,' demonstrate a mind of the choicest legal capabilities.\r\nThey are clear, compact, yet comprehensive, intuitive, logical,\r\ncomplete, and conclusive, and are respected by the bar and courts\r\nin this and other states as judicial _dicta_ of the highest authority.\r\nHe won upon the bench, as he did at the bar, the affection and\r\nconfidence of his associates.  They esteemed him for his gentle\r\nand genial nature, for the brilliant flashes of his mind and the\r\nsolid strength of his judgment; above all, for the stainless\r\nintegrity of his character, as a judge and as a man.\r\n\r\n\"Under the provisions of our old constitution, the Supreme Court\r\nwas required to hold an annual term or sitting in each county of\r\nthe state, two of the judges officiating.  In every court-room in\r\nOhio where Judge Sherman presided he made friends.  His official\r\nrobes were worn by him as the customary habiliments of the man.\r\nHe was never distant, haughty, morose, austere, or overbearing on\r\nthe bench.  It was not in his nature to be so anywhere, and it was\r\ntherefore always a personal pleasure to practice in his courts.\r\nThe younger members of the profession idolized him in every part\r\nof the state; for them and their early efforts he systematically\r\nsympathized, and he uniformly bestowed upon them the most gracious\r\ncompliment that any judge upon the bench can render to the oldest\r\npractitioner at the bar--he gave them his interested and undivided\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"He had entered upon the sixth year of his official term, was in\r\nhis manly meridian of life, in the full fruition of his matured\r\nintellectual powers, in the plenitude of his public usefulness,\r\nand in the enjoyment of apparent robust physical health, out upon\r\nhis circuit, and about to hold a session of the Supreme Court at\r\nLebanon, in Warren county, when suddenly, without any premonition,\r\nhe was struck down with a fatal malady, that was frightfully rapid\r\nin its termination.  The best medical aid was summoned from\r\nCincinnati; it was in vain.  An express messenger was hurried to\r\nLancaster for Mrs. Sherman, but before she reached him her lamented\r\nhusband was dead.\r\n\r\n\"He died in Lebanon, June 24, 1829, in the 41st year of his age.\r\n\r\n\"I will not attempt to describe the outburst of public sorrow that\r\nprevailed over this event.  It was general and sincere, touching\r\nand outspoken; but it was in Lancaster, it was here in his happy\r\nhome, which he made the home always of genial and open-hearted\r\nhospitality--here among his neighbors and fellow-citizens of every\r\nclass and description, all of whom knew him and all of whom loved\r\nhim--that the intelligence of his death came with the most painful\r\nand startling abruptness.  They could not comprehend it.  But\r\nyesterday he was among them in perfect health, and now he is dead.\r\nMen wept in our public streets.  I do not believe he had a single\r\npersonal enemy on earth.\r\n\r\n\"Had Judge Sherman lived, higher and broader spheres of public\r\nusefulness would have opened before him.  There is no doubt whatever\r\nthat the same spontaneity of opinion that placed him upon the\r\nsupreme bench would have again united, when the vacancy happened,\r\nto have sent him to the Senate of the United States, and those who\r\nknow him knew full well that his first prepared public utterance\r\nin that chamber upon any pending matter of national importance\r\nwould have secured to him a brilliant national name.  This is no\r\nfancy penciling.  It was conviction with his contemporaries, and\r\nit would have been the record of history had he lived.  As it is,\r\nhe has left to his children the heritage of his spotless public\r\nreputation--of his loved and honored name.\r\n\r\n\"This fragmentary sketch would be more incomplete did I not mention\r\nthat Judge Sherman was a zealous and prominent member of the Masonic\r\nfraternity, and that he filled its highest offices of honor in the\r\nseveral grand bodies of Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Reese, the author of this sketch, was born in Philadelphia,\r\nPa., on the 5th of August, 1804.  He was a graduate of the University\r\nof Pennsylvania, studied law and was admitted to practice in\r\nPhiladelphia.  He then came to Ohio and was admitted to the bar in\r\nCincinnati and soon after settled in Lancaster.  In 1829, soon\r\nafter the death of my father, he married my eldest sister, Mary\r\nElizabeth.  He did not long pursue his profession but became a\r\nmerchant.  He was prominent as a member of the board of public\r\nworks.  In old militia times he was in command of the forces of\r\nthe state as its only major-general.  He was grand master of the\r\nGrand Lodge of Masons in Ohio for a series of years, and at the\r\nsame time held high rank in the Grand Lodge of the United States.\r\nHe was a handsome and accomplished gentleman, of pleasing manners\r\nand liberal to a fault.  He died on the 17th of December, 1883, at\r\nLancaster, in his eightieth year.\r\n\r\nOf my mother I can scarcely write without emotion, though she died\r\nmore than forty years ago.  Her maiden name was Mary Hoyt.  She\r\nwas a member of a family, mostly merchants and sailors, who had\r\nlived in Norwalk, Connecticut, since its first settlement.  At the\r\nperiod of the American Revolution the Hoyt family, composed of\r\nseveral brothers, was divided in their allegiance, some as Tories,\r\nsome as Whigs.  My mother's grandfather was a Whig.  It is a\r\ntradition in the family that one of the Tory brothers pointed out\r\nthe house of his brother, at the capture of Norwalk by the British\r\nand Tories, as the nest of a rebel, and it was burned to the ground.\r\nIn this it shared the fate of the greater part of the town.  The\r\nTories of the family went to St. Johns, but years after the war\r\nwas over they and their descendants returned to Connecticut and\r\nNew York, and many of them became prominent and respected citizens.\r\nIsaac Hoyt, my grandfather, was a prominent citizen of Norwalk,\r\npossessing considerable wealth for those days.\r\n\r\nMy mother was carefully educated at the then famous female seminary\r\nat Poughkeepsie, New York.  I remember the many embroidered pictures,\r\nmade with the needle and silk thread by the handicraft of my mother,\r\nas a school girl, carefully framed, that decorated the old house\r\nin Lancaster.  The women of that day were trained more for the\r\nculture and ornament of the house, more to knit stockings and weave\r\nhome spun than to make speeches on woman's rights.  Soon after her\r\ngraduation she married Charles Robert Sherman, as before stated,\r\nand their lives were blended.  She sometimes rode with him when on\r\nthe circuit, and always on horseback.  It was an adage in the\r\nfamily, even to her grandchildren, that she was always ready for\r\na visit.  I never knew her to scold, much less to strike, her\r\nchildren.  She was our sure refuge against grandmother, between\r\nwhom and my mother there was, however, the warmest affection.  When\r\nAunt Elizabeth married Mr. Parker, grandmother followed her daughter\r\nto their home in Mansfield.\r\n\r\nWhen my mother, by the death of her husband, was left a widow with\r\neleven children and spare means of support, she received the sympathy\r\nof all her neighbors and the kindly encouragement of everyone in\r\nLancaster.  As her children scattered her resources increased, so\r\nthat after one year of widowhood she was quite independent.  Like\r\nGoldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield she was \"passing rich\" on four\r\nhundred dollars a year.  Soon the houses of her children were open\r\nto her, but she clung to Lancaster until all her children had taken\r\nflight, when, in the summer of 1844, she accepted the invitation\r\nof her sons to make her home in Mansfield and removed there.  She\r\nhad there her house and home.  Her two youngest daughters, and the\r\nwriter of this, were her family, but in a very brief period all\r\naround her were married.  She still continued to occupy her home,\r\nand always with some of her numerous grandchildren as guests.  She\r\noften visited her children, and her coming was always regarded by\r\nthem as a favor conferred by her.  And so her tranquil life flowed\r\non until 1852, when she attended the state fair at Cleveland and\r\ncontracted a bad cold.  She returned to Mansfield only to die on\r\nthe 23rd day of September, 1852, at the residence of her daughter,\r\nMrs. Bartley.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this sketch of my ancestors, it seems proper that\r\nI refer to their religious beliefs and modes of worship.  In England\r\nthey were classed as Puritans, and were members of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch.  In Connecticut they followed the doctrine and faith of\r\nthe Congregational church of Anthony Stoddard.  Daniel Sherman had\r\nhis father were deacons of the congregation of Mr. Stoddard, and\r\nhis granddaughter, the wife of Taylor Sherman, carried her faith\r\nand practice into her family, and maintained to her death the strict\r\nmorals, and close observance of the Sabbath day, that was the\r\nestablished rule and practice of the Connecticut Congregationalist.\r\n\r\nMy mother's family, the Hoyts, were, with scarcely an exception,\r\nmembers of the Episcopal church.  My mother was reared in that\r\nfaith and practice from infancy, and was a member of that church\r\nat the time of her marriage.  When she emigrated to Lancaster she\r\nfound there no church of that denomination, and, therefore, joined\r\nthe Presbyterian church under the pastorage of Rev. John Wright,\r\nwho baptized all her children.  At a later period, perhaps about\r\n1840, when an Episcopal church was established in Lancaster, she\r\nresumed her attendance and worship in that church.  When she removed\r\nto Mansfield she attended the Episcopal church at that place,\r\npartook of its sacraments and usages, and died in that faith and\r\nworship.  All her living children and their families recognized\r\nand supported the Episcopal church as their church, except the\r\nchildren of General Sherman, who followed their mother and her\r\nmaternal ancestors in the faith and worship of the Catholic church.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this has a firm belief in the Bible as the only creed\r\nof religious faith and duty, and willingly accords to every human\r\nbeing the right to choose his form of worship according to his\r\njudgment, but in case of doubt it is best to follow the teachings\r\nof his mother.\r\n\r\nWith this, the sketch of my ancestors closes.  Many will think it\r\nis not part of my life, and that I have given too much space and\r\nimportance to it.  If so, I hope they will pass it over without\r\nreading.  Each individual life is molded by one's ancestry, by the\r\nincidents of his childhood, the training he receives in the family\r\nand the school and the conditions and surroundings of his early\r\ndays.  The boy is father to the man.  It is difficult for one in\r\nadvanced age to recall or to measure the influence of each of these\r\nin forming his character, but a statement of them is a necessary\r\npreface to a history of his later life.  My information as to my\r\nancestry is chiefly derived from the admirable local histories of\r\nConnecticut, and, especially, from \"Cothron's History of Ancient\r\nWoodbury,\" \"Hutchinson's History of Connecticut,\" and the local\r\nrecords and traditions of Essex and Sussex counties in England.\r\n\r\nI cannot claim for my ancestors superior rank, wealth or ability.\r\nThey were not specially distinguished for any of these, but they\r\nwere men of useful and honorable lives, of untarnished reputation,\r\nhighly esteemed by their contemporaries, thorough republicans in\r\nthe broad sense of that word, always for their country in any\r\ncontest for the right, and willing to yield equal political and\r\ncivil rights to all their countrymen of every creed and color.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nMY BOYHOOD DAYS AND EARLY LIFE.\r\nBorn at Lancaster, Ohio, May 10, 1823--Death of My Father and Its\r\nEffect on Our Family--Early Days at School--A Dead Sheep in the\r\nSchoolroom--Lesson in Sunday Sport--Some of My Characteristics--My\r\nAttack on the Schoolmaster--Robbing an Orchard--A Rodman at Fourteen\r\nand My Experiences While Surveying--Debates at Beverly--Early Use\r\nof Liquor--First Visit to Mansfield in 1839--The Famous Campaign\r\nof 1840--I Begin the Study of Law.\r\n\r\nI was born at Lancaster, Ohio, on the 10th day of May, 1823, the\r\neighth child of Charles and Mary Sherman.  My first distinct\r\nrecollection of events is connected with the scenes and incidents\r\nthat followed the death of my father on the 24th day of June, 1829.\r\nI have a dim recollection before that time of being sent to school\r\nwith my elder brothers to keep me out of mischief, and of my father\r\npraising me for learning the alphabet, but all other impressions\r\nof my infancy were absorbed in the great family tragedy.  We were\r\nwarned to keep quiet, and to remain out of doors, so as not to\r\ndisturb mother, who was critically ill, and, as our grandmother\r\nwas then supreme in the household, we knew that her will was law,\r\nand that punishment invariably followed an offense.  During these\r\nenforced absences many were the wise resolves, or, rather, the\r\nconceits, that the boys discussed for \"helping mother.\"\r\n\r\nBut time, which mellows every misfortune, brought so many changes.\r\nMy sister, Elizabeth, was soon married to General William J. Reese.\r\nMy brother, Charles, came home a full-fledged graduate, and, as we\r\nthought, very learned.  Everybody was kind.  The affairs of my\r\nfather were settled.  The homestead and garden were secured to my\r\nmother, and she had, in addition, a settled income from her father's\r\nestate of $400 a year, while grandmother had her \"fire lands,\" and\r\nan assured but small income besides.  In those days a little money\r\nwent a great way; but there were eleven children of us to be cared\r\nfor,--from Charles, aged eighteen, to Fanny, aged three months.\r\nThe separation of this family was imperative, but the friends of\r\nmy father were numerous, and their offerings were generous and\r\nurgent.  Charles entered the family of our cousin, Mr. Stoddard,\r\nan old and leading lawyer in Dayton, Ohio, studied law, and in two\r\nyears was admitted to the bar.  James, the next eldest brother,\r\naccepted a clerkship in a store in Cincinnati, and from that time\r\npaid his own way, becoming a merchant, first in Lancaster, and\r\nlater in Des Moines, Iowa.  William Tecumseh was adopted into the\r\nfamily of Hon. Thomas Ewing, who lived in the same square with us\r\nin Lancaster.  The two families were bound by ties and mutual aid\r\nwhich were highly creditable to both.  My father, Judge Sherman,\r\nhad been able to help Mr. Ewing in the beginning of his professional\r\ncareer, and Mr. Ewing gratefully and generously responded.  They\r\nmaintained the most intimate and cordial relations during their\r\nlives and their families have since continued them, the bond being\r\nstrengthened by the marriage of William Tecumseh to Mr. Ewing's\r\ndaughter, Ellen.  Lampson P., the fourth son, was adopted into the\r\nfamily of Charles Hammond, of Cincinnati, a distinguished lawyer\r\nof marked ability, the reporter of the Supreme Court of Ohio, and\r\neditor and chief proprietor of the \"Gazette,\" the leading newspaper\r\npublished in his day in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nWhile the reduction of our family was thus taking place I was kept\r\nat school at Lancaster, where I made considerable advance in such\r\nstudies as a lad from six to eight years of age can pursue.  I have\r\nforgotten the names of my tutors.  The present admirable system of\r\ncommon schools in Ohio had not then been adopted, but the private\r\nschools in Lancaster were considered very good, and most of the\r\nboys of school age were able at little cost to get the rudiments\r\nof an education.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1831, my father's cousin, John Sherman, a prosperous\r\nmerchant of Mt. Vernon, Ohio, accompanied by his bride, visited my\r\nmother, and proposed to take me into his family and to keep me at\r\nschool until I was prepared to enter Kenyon College, five miles\r\nfrom Mt. Vernon.  This was a kindly offer and was gratefully\r\naccepted.  But I remember well the sadness I felt, and the tears\r\nI shed, over the departure from home into the midst of strangers.\r\nThe old-fashioned stage coach was then the only medium of travel\r\nand the fifty miles between Lancaster and Mt. Vernon were to me a\r\nwearisome journey.  For days after I arrived at Mt. Vernon I was\r\nmoping either at the house or at the store, but ere long became\r\naccustomed to the change, and commenced my studies in the schools,\r\nwhich, as I remember them, were admirably conducted by teachers of\r\nmarked ability, among whom were some who became distinguished in\r\nprofessional and business life.  One of the families that I became\r\nintimate with was that of Mr. Norton, one of whose sons, J. Banning\r\nNorton, who lately died in Dallas, Texas, was my constant companion.\r\nWe studied our lessons together, but frequently had quarrels and\r\nfights.  It was a \"fad\" of his to wear his finger-nails very long.\r\nOn one occasion I pummeled him well, but he scratched my face in\r\nthe contest.  When I went home, marked in this way, I was asked\r\nhow I came to be so badly scratched and the best answer I could\r\nmake was that I had fallen on a \"splintery log,\" and this got to\r\nbe a by-word in the school.\r\n\r\nAccording to the usages of the time I was put early to the study\r\nof Latin, which then seemed to be regarded as the necessary foundation\r\nfor an education.  I must confess that during my stay in Mt. Vernon\r\nI was rather a troublesome boy, frequently involved in controversies\r\nwith the teachers, and sometimes punished in the old-fashioned way\r\nwith the ferule and the switch, which habit I then regarded as\r\ntyrannical and now regard as impolitic.  I do not believe that the\r\npolicy of punishment adopted in the schools of those times would\r\nbe expedient to-day.  It tended to foster a constant irritation\r\nbetween the teacher and the pupil.\r\n\r\nAmong my school adventures at Mt. Vernon was one I heartily regret.\r\nWe had a teacher by the name of Lord.  He was a small man, and not\r\nable to cope with several of the boys in the school.  We called\r\nhim \"Bunty Lord.\"  One evening after school four boys, of whom I\r\nwas one, while playing on the commons, found a dead sheep.  It was\r\nsuggested that we carry the sheep into the schoolroom and place it\r\non Lord's seat.  This was promptly done and I wrote a Latin couplet,\r\npurporting that this was a very worthy sacrifice to a very poor\r\nLord, and placed it on the head of the sheep.  The next morning\r\nLord found the sheep and made a great outcry against the indignity.\r\nEfforts were made at once to ascertain the actors in this farce,\r\nand proof was soon obtained.  My handwriting disclosed my part in\r\nthe case, and the result was a prompt discharge of the culprits\r\nfrom school; but poor Lord lost his place, because of his manifest\r\ninability to govern his unruly pupils.\r\n\r\nAnother teacher I remember was of a very different type.  This was\r\nMatthew H. Mitchell.  He was severe and dogmatic, allowing no\r\nfoolishness in his school.  He was strict and impartial in his\r\ntreatment of the boys, and, though we did not like him, we respected\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nI had one adventure during these early boyhood days which nearly\r\ncost me my life, and which Uncle John (as I called Mr. Sherman)\r\nconverted into a religious warning.  One Sunday there was a freshet\r\nin Owl Creek, on the south side of the town, and many people went\r\nto see it, I among the rest.  I was reckless, and, against the\r\nadvice of others, went out on a temporary foot-bridge which fell\r\nand I dropped into the raging waters.  How I escaped I hardly know,\r\nbut it was by the assistance of others.  Uncle John said that I\r\nwas punished by the Almighty for violating the Sabbath.  Ever after\r\nthat I was careful about Sunday sport.\r\n\r\nI remember, while living at Uncle John's, witnessing the wedding\r\nof his niece, Miss Leavenworth, to Columbus Delano.  I sat upon\r\nthe stair steps during the ceremony, the first of the kind I ever\r\nsaw.  I mention this because of my long acquaintance with Mr. Delano\r\nand his family.  He became a great lawyer and filled many offices\r\nof high public trust, and is now (1895) living in vigorous health,\r\neighty-six years old.  I also remember very well Henry B. Curtis\r\nand his family.  He married a sister of Mrs. Sherman of Mt. Vernon,\r\nand had a number of children.  He was a brother of Colonel Samuel\r\nR. Curtis, distinguished in the Civil War, was an accomplished\r\nlawyer, a careful business man, and a gentleman in every sense of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I regard my four years at Mount Vernon as well spent.\r\nI advanced in my studies so that I could translate Latin fairly\r\nwell, I went through the primary studies, and obtained some\r\ncomprehension of algebra, geometry and kindred studies.  In the\r\nmeantime the condition of our family had greatly changed and\r\ngenerally improved.  My sister Amelia was happily married to Robert\r\nMcComb, a merchant of Mansfield.  My father's only sister was\r\nmarried to Judge Parker, of Mansfield, to which place my grandmother\r\nhad followed her daughter, and my brother Charles had entered upon\r\nhis career as a lawyer in the same town.\r\n\r\nUncle John had a family of small children growing up and I felt I\r\nwas in the way.  My mother was anxious for me to return home as\r\nall her boys were away.  I wanted to go.  Uncle John, however,\r\nexpressed his desire for me to stay and enter Kenyon College, but\r\nI knew that Mrs. Sherman preferred that I should leave as she had\r\nher young children to care for.  The result was my return to\r\nLancaster at the age of twelve.  Mrs. Sherman is now living at\r\nWashington, D. C., at the age of eighty-seven, with her son John.\r\nI shall always remember with sincere gratitude her care and\r\nforbearance manifested toward a rather wild and reckless boy at\r\nthe disagreeable age of from eight to twelve years.  Affection may\r\nmake a mother bear with the torment of her own child at that age,\r\nbut will rarely induce an equal leniency toward that of another.\r\n\r\nMy return to Lancaster was a happy event in my life.  I renewed my\r\nold acquaintance with boys of my age, and was on intimate terms\r\nwith Philemon Ewing, Charles Garaghty, Frederick Reese, W. P. Rice,\r\nW. Winthrop Sifford and others.  My brother, William Tecumseh, was\r\nthree years my senior, and he and his associates of his own age\r\nrather looked down upon their juniors.  Still, I had a good deal\r\nof intercourse with him, mainly in the way of advice on his part.\r\nAt that time he was a steady student, quiet in his manners and\r\neasily moved by sympathy or affection.  I was regarded as a wild,\r\nreckless lad, eager in controversy and ready to fight.  No one\r\ncould then anticipate that he was to be a great warrior and I a\r\nplodding lawyer and politician.  I fired my first gun over his\r\nshoulder.  He took me with him to carry the game, mostly squirrels\r\nand pigeons.  He was then destined to West Point, and was preparing\r\nfor it.  To me the future was all unknown.\r\n\r\nI entered, with all the boys referred to and many others, the\r\nAcademy of Mark and Matthew Howe, then well established, and of\r\ngreat reputation,--and deservedly so.  The schoolrooms were large,\r\nand furnished with desks and chairs, an improvement upon the old\r\nbenches with boards in front.  The course of studies mapped out\r\nfor me was much the same as I pursued at Mount Vernon, with a\r\nspecialty of the first six books of Euclid, and of algebra.  Latin\r\nwas taught but little.  From the first, arithmetic, algebra and\r\nsurveying were my favorite studies, and in those I became proficient.\r\nWe had an improvised theatre in which we acted plays and made\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the school Matthew Howe was the regulator, teacher\r\nand dominie.  He was the supreme autocrat, from whom there was no\r\nappeal.  All the boys respected him, for he certainly was a good\r\nteacher, but they did not like his domineering way.  I got along\r\nwith him pretty well for some months, but one day after I had\r\nmastered my lessons I rested my head on my desk when I was sharply\r\nreproved by him.  I said that I did not feel very well and had\r\nlearned my lessons.  He called me to the black-board and directed\r\nme to demonstrate some problem in my lesson of Euclid.  I went,\r\nand, as I believed, had made the drawing and demonstrated the\r\nproblem.  He said I had not, that I had failed to refer to a\r\ncorollary.  I answered that he had not required this in previous\r\nlessons.  Some discussion arose, when, with the ferule in his hand,\r\nhe directed me to hold out mine.  I did so, but as he struck my\r\nright hand, I hit him with all the force I could command with my\r\nleft.  This created great excitement in the school, all the students\r\nbeing present, my brother Tecumseh among them.  It was said at the\r\ntime that the boys were disposed to take sides with me, but I saw\r\nno signs of it.  The result was that I was expelled from the school,\r\nbut, by the intercession of my mother, and Mrs. Reese, after\r\nexplanations, I was restored, and during my two years with Mr. Howe\r\nI had no other contention with him.  He moved some years later to\r\nIowa, where he established another academy, and lived a long and\r\nuseful life.  We had friendly correspondence with each other, but\r\nneither alluded to our skirmish over a corollary in Euclid.\r\n\r\nThe pupils had the usual disposition among boys to play tricks on\r\neach other.  The academy was in a large square, the greater part\r\nof which was an orchard of apple trees.  Mr. Howe lived on the\r\ncorner of the square, some distance from the academy.  The boys\r\nwere forbidden to climb the trees to shake down the fruit, but were\r\nquite welcome to the fruit on the ground.  One fall, when the apples\r\nwere ripe, the boys conspired to play a trick upon some of the\r\nstudents and outsiders,--among them my brother Lampson, then on a\r\nvisit home from Cincinnati,--who were easily persuaded to rob the\r\norchard, none more willing than \"Lamp.\"  Those in the plot were to\r\nwatch and prevent interference.  When the time came we had detailed\r\ntwo or three boys in the academy to fire off muskets, well loaded\r\nwith powder and nothing else, when the signal was given.  Everything\r\nmoved on according to programme.  The boys detailed to shake down\r\nthe apples were in the trees, when, all at once, the firing of\r\nmusketry commenced.  The boys dropped from the trees and scattered\r\nin every direction.  Some of them were caught in the pea vines of\r\nMr. Howe's garden, but most of them, with great labor, climbed over\r\nthe high fence around the ground and dropped on the outside \"with\r\na thud,\" safe from powder!  The dogs in the neighborhood lent their\r\naid to the outcry, and everybody was convinced that ruffians had\r\nrobbed Howe's orchard.\r\n\r\nI suppose it will never occur that a generation of boys will not\r\ndo these things.  At seventy-two I know it was wrong.  At thirteen\r\nI thought it was fun.\r\n\r\nI now recall many pleasing memories of what occurred in the two\r\nyears \"at home\" at that period when the life of a boy is beginning\r\nto open to the future.  It is the period of greatest danger and\r\nhighest hope.  At that time, 1835 to 1837, everybody was prosperous.\r\nThe development created by our system of canals had opened markets\r\nfor our produce.  The public national debt had been paid.  The pet\r\nbanks chartered after the destruction of the Bank of the United\r\nStates started upon a wild scheme of inflation.  A craze to purchase\r\npublic land created an overflowing revenue.  All causes combining\r\ncreated a deceptive prosperity that could end only in one way.\r\nAll this was Greek to me.  All I wanted, and the controlling wish\r\nof my life, was to help mother.  She was always kind, loving and\r\nforbearing.  No word of reproach ever fell from her lips to me.\r\nShe was the same to all her children, but if there was any difference,\r\nor favor, it was for me.  Even at that early age I had day dreams\r\nfor the future, and mother was the central picture.  If fortunes\r\ncould be made by others why could I not make one!  I wished I was\r\na man.  It began to appear to me that I could not wait to go through\r\ncollege.  What were Latin and Greek to me, when they would delay\r\nme in making my fortune!\r\n\r\nNear the close of 1836 I wrote to my brother Charles at Mansfield,\r\nasking him to get me employment.  He discouraged me and said I\r\nshould stick to my studies, but I insisted that I was strong and\r\ncould make my own living.  At this time Ohio had decided upon the\r\nimprovement of the Muskingum River from Zanesville to Marietta,\r\nand the Board of Public Works had selected Colonel Samuel R. Curtis,\r\na graduate of West Point, as chief engineer.  He was a brother of\r\nMr. Curtis, of Mount Vernon, and a friend of our family.\r\n\r\nCharles had no difficulty in securing me employment as junior rodman\r\nif, at the age of fourteen, I could perform the duties requed,--\r\nwhich Colonel Curtis doubted.  The work was not to commence until\r\nthe spring, when I was to be given a trial.  I worked hard that\r\nwinter, for hard work, I thought, was the way to fortune.  I studied\r\nthe mode of leveling.  I saw a man on the Hocking canal operate\r\nhis instrument, take the rear sight from the level of the water in\r\nthe canal, then by a succession of levels backwards and forwards\r\ncarry his level to the objective point.  Then the man was kind\r\nenough to show me how, by simple addition and subtraction, the\r\nresult wanted could be obtained.  I was well advanced in arithmetic\r\nand in mathematics generally, and was confident, even if I was\r\nhardly fourteen years old, that I could do the work of a junior\r\nrodman.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of May, 1837, the day of deliverance came.  I was\r\nto be my own master and make my own living!  A fortune gilded with\r\nhope was before me.  I was to go in the stage thirty-six miles to\r\nZanesville, and thence by stage-route down the Muskingum River,\r\ntwenty-eight miles to McConnelsville.  When the stage arrived at\r\nmy mother's house it was rather full, but there was still room\r\nenough for me.  All the family, and my comrades, had gathered to\r\nsee me off.  My baggage, all new, was thrown into the boot, and I\r\ntook my seat in the stage.  My heart sank a little as the stage\r\nrolled over the hill and down the valley beyond, but the passengers\r\nwanted to know who I was, where I was going, and what I was going\r\nto do, and I think they got all the information they wanted, for\r\nwhy should I not tell them of my visions of hope, sometimes called\r\nplans!  Oh! the golden dreams of childhood, the splendid anticipations\r\nof boyhood, the fields of conquest to be won, the fortunes to be\r\nmade, all to vanish into thin air by the touch of reality.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Zanesville long after dark, and very weary.  I had\r\nnever been in so large a town before.  The hotel was full of people,\r\nbut no one noticed me.  I was hungry, but could only get the scraps\r\nleft, as the supper hour was past.  I was to leave in the morning\r\nat daylight without breakfast.  I was shown into a small dark room,\r\non the third floor, and was to be called in the morning.  I did\r\nnot like the place and was alone and in fear.  I had more money\r\nthan ever before.  Might I not be robbed?  I took the precaution\r\nto deposit my jack-knife on a chair within reach, to defend myself\r\nin case of attack!  My fears were soon lost in sleep.  In the\r\nmorning I was aroused to take by place in the stage, but forgot my\r\nknife, my only weapon of defense, and it was lost to me forever.\r\nThe bright morning revived my spirits.  A hearty breakfast at\r\nTaylorsville revived all my hopes and plans.\r\n\r\nI arrived at McConnelsville about noon and stopped at the only\r\ntavern in the place.  I called at the headquarters of Colonel Curtis\r\nand introduced myself to him.  He received me very kindly and\r\nintroduced me to the office clerks, and to James M. Love, who, I\r\nwas told, would take me within a week to the engineer corps, then\r\nrunning their levels at Beverly, sixteen miles away.  I spent the\r\nweek pleasantly with him, and was intimately associated with him\r\nduring my service of two years.  He subsequently studied law and\r\npracticed his profession at Coshocton.  When the Mexican War was\r\nprogressing he enlisted in one of the Ohio regiments, became a\r\ncaptain, and, I think, a major, and rendered good service.  He\r\nsubsequently migrated to Iowa and was appointed judge of the District\r\nCourt of the United States for that state.  This position he held\r\nfor many years with distinction and honor.  He died July 2, 1891.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for joining the corps Love proposed that we\r\nstart in the morning for Beverly, but I insisted that, as it was\r\nonly sixteen miles to Beverly, we could easily make the trip after\r\ndinner.  I had never walked so far as sixteen miles in my life,\r\nbut had walked or run three or four miles in an hour, and, by the\r\nrules of arithmetic, we could easily go sixteen miles in five or\r\nsix hours.  He yielded to my wishes, and, as our baggage had been\r\nsent by the stage, we started about one o'clock, light of heart\r\nand foot.  When we had climbed the long hill south of McConnelsville,\r\nabout a mile and a half, I was a little tired, and I asked how far\r\nwe had gone; he said, \"a mile and a half!\"  I began then to appreciate\r\nmy folly in not starting in the morning.  He said nothing, but kept\r\nat my slower pace, giving me a rest occasionally.  It was sun-down\r\nwhen we were six miles from Beverly, and I was completely tired\r\nout.  Still neither of us proposed to stop, as we could have done\r\nat a farmer's house on the roadside.  We reached the town of Beverly\r\nabout ten o'clock, weary and hungry.  This tramp taught me a lesson\r\nI never forgot,--not to insist upon anything I knew nothing about.\r\nWe found the corps the next day in camp in one large tent on the\r\neast bank of the Muskingum River.\r\n\r\nI had another experience, equally unpleasant, during our first\r\nevening in camp.  The members of our corps, five or six in number,\r\nhad been invited by Mr. Lindsley to attend a party at his house\r\nnear by.  They accepted, and, as Love and I had no invitations, we\r\nwere left on guard in the tent containing the instruments and\r\nsupplies.  When we were alone there came up suddenly a storm of\r\nwind and rain,--not uncommon along the valley,--which flattened\r\nthe tent and flooded the ground on which it stood.  We were thoroughly\r\nsoaked and utterly helpless, and, for a time, in real danger.  I\r\nremember my utter collapse at this new misfortune, but all we could\r\ndo was to wait and hope for the return of the corps.  I must confess\r\nthat I quietly mingled my tears with the rain, but I did not tell\r\nthis to the boys when they returned after the storm was over.  No\r\ngreat damage was done.  The tent was soon raised and secured in\r\nplace.  The next morning I was given a rod and instructed how to\r\nuse it.  I noticed that my associates did not have much confidence\r\nin my ability to perform the duties, and, especially the senior\r\nrodman, John Burwell.  I followed instructions, however, and reported\r\nmy rod correctly.  After a day or two they gave me a book in which\r\nI was to enter the levels.  In a very short time they were satisfied\r\nthat I could perform my duties, and I was soon trusted to make up\r\nthe record of levels, and the necessary additions and subtractions\r\nin my book.\r\n\r\nThis little corps was composed of men, some of whom afterwards\r\nbecame proficient as engineers, lawyers or preachers.  Among them\r\nwere John B. Straughn, Wright Coffinberry, John Scott, John Burwell,\r\nand James M. Love.  The line of surveys were soon completed to\r\nMarietta, the locks and dams were located, estimates of cost were\r\ncarefully made, the materials to be used were purchased and the\r\nexcavations and embankments to be made were computed.  My associates\r\nsoon found that I could do the work assigned me, and in this way\r\nI won their respect and forbearance.\r\n\r\nAfter the surveys were completed, the members of the corps were\r\nlocated at different places to take charge of the work.  Mr.\r\nCoffinberry was assigned to Lowell, and I was attached to him as\r\nan assistant.  John Scott, who had been at West Point, and, I think,\r\nwas a graduate, was assigned to Beverly, where a dam, lock and a\r\nshort canal were to be constructed.  In the fall of 1837 he was\r\ndismissed, I think, for intemperance.  I was detailed, not exactly\r\nto take his place, for which I was unfitted, but to look after some\r\ndetails, and to keep the headquarters advised of the progress of\r\nthe work.  It was soon found that I was able to measure embankments,\r\nexcavations, stone and other materials.  The result was that I was\r\ncontinued, at my early age, practically in charge of the work I\r\nhave mentioned.  All plans came from headquarters and I was carefully\r\ninstructed from there what to do and how to do it.  This was a\r\ngreat and useful experience for me, and it continued until the\r\nsummer of 1839.\r\n\r\nDuring most of that time I lived in the family of Mr. Paul Fearing,\r\nan old and respected citizen of Beverly, who had long been engaged\r\nin what was called the river trade.  He transported the produce of\r\nthe country, chiefly pork, apples, wheat, and corn, from the\r\nneighboring region on flats and scows down the Muskingum, Ohio and\r\nMississippi to New Orleans, stopping at the riverside towns, selling\r\nhis commodities and buying others.  The boats were sold at New\r\nOrleans for lumber.  The captain and crew, generally consisting of\r\ntwo men, would return by steamer with the proceeds of their traffic\r\nin sugar, molasses and other productions of the south.  This was\r\nthe early mode of traffic, but it had largely been broken up by\r\nsteamboats, so that at the time I refer to, Mr. Fearing's occupation\r\nwas gone; but he had a comfortable little fortune, and, with his\r\nwife and only daughter, lived in a neat cottage on the banks of\r\nthe river at Beverly, where I became practically a member of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe community at Beverly was a very intelligent one, composed mainly\r\nof settlers from Massachusetts on the Ohio Company's purchase.\r\nThe valley of the Muskingum is exceedingly fertile, but it is\r\ncomparatively narrow and confined by picturesque hills and ridges,\r\nbroken by water courses.  The settlements were mostly in the valley,\r\nfor the hill lands were rough, covered by poor soil, and were\r\noccupied chiefly for grazing.  The portion of the valley at Beverly,\r\nand south of it, was singularly fertile and pleasing, and very\r\nvaluable.  Its owners and occupants were mostly of New England\r\nbirth and descent.  Their productions had a ready market down the\r\nriver, and in that age, before railroads, the valley had a great\r\nadvantage in transportation and supplies over the interior parts\r\nof the state.  The people were, as a rule, educated in good schools,\r\nand they had a college at Marietta and a female college at Zanesville.\r\nThe proposed improvement of the Muskingum, they believed, would\r\ngive them another advantage, by securing them water of a depth\r\nsufficient for boats in the dry seasons of the year, as well as\r\nduring the \"freshets,\" which they then had to depend upon, but\r\nwhich at best were not very reliable in their habits, as I found\r\nto my cost.  This was to be corrected by the \"improvement,\" which,\r\nin their delusive hope, was to give them cheap water transportation\r\nall the year around.\r\n\r\nAt that time railroads were in their infancy.  They have since\r\npractically destroyed or crippled all internal navigation on inland\r\nrivers, reaching their iron arms over the United States, traversing\r\nnorth and south, east and west--a vast gridiron of roads, in value\r\ngreater than the market value of all the land in the United States\r\nin 1837.  Before the first railroad was built in Ohio the Muskingum\r\nimprovement was completed, but it proved to be a bad investment.\r\nThe canals of Ohio and this improvement were, perhaps, the necessary\r\nforerunner of the railroads to come, but the money expended on them\r\nwas practically lost.  And I believe that the experiment now being\r\nmade by the United States in the improvement of the Ohio, Missouri\r\nand Mississippi Rivers will end in a like result on a grander scale.\r\nBy the demolition of the forests which covered this great valley,\r\nthe supply and distribution of the waters and rivers in this region\r\nwill be so diminished at certain seasons as to render these water-\r\nways worthless for navigation.  Engineers may make dams that will\r\nhold water and locks that may lift a steamboat, but if the clearing\r\naway of forests prevents the usual fall of rain and causes its\r\nabsorption into the earth, and if the dispersion of water by its\r\nuse and waste in cities, are to continue, the dam will not be\r\nfilled, and the lock will be like a stranded vessel, fit only as\r\na quarry for cut stone, or for a railway arch over a street of\r\nasphalt in a growing city.  Captain Fearing railed against the\r\nsteamboats as many now inveigh against the railroads, but these\r\ntwo great agencies will divide the commerce of the world between\r\nthem.  The railroads will possess the land, the steamboats the\r\nocean and the great fresh waters of the world.  Possibly steamboats\r\nmay be utilized on short stretches of rivers, but even on these\r\nthey will have to compete with railroads having wide-reaching\r\nconnections which they do not possess.  The money expended to levee\r\nthe Mississippi may be lost by the United States, but the planters\r\nwill receive some benefit from it in the protection given to their\r\ncrops.  The steamboats in interior waters will be exchanged for\r\niron whalebacks, and new forces of a new nature, as yet only partly\r\ndeveloped, such a electricity, will contest with steam as a motive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of my stay on the Muskingum improvements I had\r\nvery excellent opportunities for study, of which I regret to say\r\nI did not avail myself as well as I might have done.  Still, I\r\noccupied my leisure in reading novels, histories, and such books\r\nas I could readily get.  Many books were sent to me from Lancaster.\r\nI purchased a number, and found some in Beverly which were kindly\r\nlent to me.  I read most of the British classics, as they are\r\ncalled, the Spectator, Shakespeare, Byron, and Scott.  I read all\r\nI could find of the history of America.  I tried to brush up my\r\nLatin, but without much success.  I had the frequent company of my\r\nassociates on the corps, all of whom were bright, able men, several\r\nyears in advance of me in age.  We were frequently called to\r\nheadquarters at McConnelsville, a trip usually made on horseback,\r\nand where we always had not only a cheerful, but a very instructive\r\ntime.  Colonel Curtis was highly esteemed by us all, and his\r\ntreatment of me was kind and fatherly.  He frequently complimented\r\nme upon my work, and when he came through Beverly he visited me.\r\n\r\nAmong the diversions at Beverly we had occasional debates.  One of\r\nthese was upon the dangerous subject of temperance, a topic not\r\nthen much discussed, for drinking of something stronger than water\r\nwas almost as universal as eating, and considered equally necessary.\r\nHowever, there sprang up about this time a movement in favor of\r\ntemperance.  It was thought best to discuss the subject at a public\r\nmeeting, a school teacher and I taking the side of temperance, and\r\ntwo other young men opposing us.  The meeting was well attended,\r\nlargely by the men employed on the public work who habitually\r\nreceived a certain number of \"jiggers\" of whisky a day, at regular\r\nhours.  Whisky, not being taxed, was worth from fifteen to twenty-\r\nfive cents a gallon.  It was not an expensive luxury, and was\r\nregarded by all the workingmen on the improvement as a necessity.\r\nAt the end of the debate, which I do not remember to have been a\r\nvery notable one, the audience decided that we had the best of the\r\nargument.  The discussion created a great excitement.  The workingmen\r\ntook up the cry that the Cumberland Presbyterians, the prevailing\r\nsect there, and other Christians, were interfering with their habits\r\nand comforts, and when the young schoolmaster appeared the next\r\nday, they raised a shout and pursued him with sticks and stones.\r\nHe escaped with difficulty across the river, thus getting out of\r\nthe way.  I heard of the trouble, but went up to the canal and made\r\nmy usual measurements.  Not a word was said to me and no unkindness\r\nshown.  I understood afterwards that this was caused by a warning\r\ngiven them by the contractor, who, hearing of the assault upon the\r\nschoolmaster, told them that I was a part of the government and it\r\nwould not do to attack me; that to disturb me would have a very\r\nbad effect upon them all.  So, I was forgiven, and, indeed, I never\r\nhad any controversy during my time there with anyone connected with\r\nthe work, from John McCune, the contractor, to the humblest water\r\ncarrier about the works.\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter of 1838, I think in November, I had made up my\r\nmind to go to Cincinnati on the usual leave after the close of\r\nthe works.  As an excuse, and to procure means of paying for the\r\ntrip, I purchased, partly on credit, a barge and loaded it with\r\nbarreled salt, apples and other commodities, intending before the\r\nfreeze-up to avail myself of the usual rise in the river to float\r\nto the Ohio and thence to Cincinnati.  All went smoothly, the boat\r\nwas loaded and floated as far as Luke Shute, when the river was\r\nfound to be too low to proceed.  Consequently the boat was tied up\r\nand placed under the care of a man who slept aboard.  We waited\r\nfor the river to rise, but it did not come.  Both the Muskingum\r\nand Ohio Rivers were very low that season and finally froze up\r\nbefore the freshet came.  This closing of navigation created a\r\ngreat demand for salt in Cincinnati, as that article could not be\r\nobtained from the up-river country, and it advanced to a price that\r\nwould have yielded me a little fortune had my boat not been among\r\nthose thus detained.  I undertook to carry some of the salt by\r\nflatboats, but they were frozen up.  The packing season in Cincinnati\r\nwas going forward and salt bore a high price, but I knew it would\r\nfall the moment the river opened.  It was apparent that I would\r\nlose on the salt, but I still clung to my purpose to go down the\r\nriver.  Finally the freshet came, some time in January, I think,\r\nand then, with three men on the barge, I floated down the river,\r\ntying up at nights for safety, and stopping occasionally to sell\r\napples to the Kentucky farmers, I arrived at last in Cincinnati\r\nand soon found that salt had greatly fallen in value, so I sold\r\nthe salt, boat and cargo upon the best terms I could get.  The\r\nresult was a loss of about one hundred dollars.  However, I had a\r\nvery pleasant visit in Cincinnati with my brother Lampson, who was\r\nconnected with the \"Cincinnati Gazette.\"  He was a member of the\r\nfamily of Mr. Charles Hammond, his daughter, and son-in-law Mr.\r\nL'Hommedieu.  Mr. Hammond had been a warm friend of my father's\r\nand was certainly one of the ablest writers of his day and generation,\r\nas well as an accomplished lawyer.  He was much pleased at my\r\nadventure and especially with my rough shoes and warm Kentucky\r\njeans.  He told me not to be discouraged, and flattered me with\r\nthe statement that a young fellow who could, at fifteen years of\r\nage, do what I had done would make his way in the world.\r\n\r\nAt that time I saw Judge Burnett at his residence.  He had been a\r\ncolleague of my father on the supreme bench, and during all his\r\nmanhood had been distinguished as a lawyer and a man of marked\r\nability.  He wore a long queue, preserved the habits of the gentleman\r\nof the old school, and was proud of being a Federalist.  His book\r\ncalled \"Burnett's Notes\" is perhaps the most valuable collection\r\nof historical data pertaining to the early history of Ohio now\r\nextant.\r\n\r\nAt this time I visited what was called Powers' \"Hell.\"  My brother\r\nLampson and I took the boatmen with us, and \"Lamp,\" who was fond\r\nof playing practical jokes, and knew the place better than I did,\r\ntook care to warn one of the roughest of my boatmen to seize hold\r\nof a bar which was before him, and which \"Lamp\" knew would be\r\ncharged later with electricity, and to hold on to it for dear life.\r\nWe heard a rumbling sound inside, and finally saw flashes resembling\r\nlightning, and we naturally seized on whatever was before us to\r\nawait the opening of \"Hell.\"  After more sheet lightning the veil\r\nwas drawn aside and there were before us representations of human\r\nbeings in every attitude of agony.  At the same moment the electric\r\ncurrent was passed through certain bars before us, on one of which\r\nthe boatman held a firm grip, but no sooner was he charged with\r\nelectricity than his hair flew on end, he looked the picture of\r\nterror, shouted in a loud voice, \"O, hell!\" and broke for the door.\r\nSoon after we followed also, and that, to us, was the end of a\r\nscene that ought never to have been exhibited.\r\n\r\nI returned to Beverly in a steamboat and soon settled all the bills\r\nof the salt speculation, but had to call upon Mr. McComb and my\r\nbrother, Charles, for a small sum to make up the deficit.  I repaid\r\nthis sum later on, but Mr. McComb never failed, whenever I made a\r\nbusiness proposition that seemed hazardous, to say, with a great\r\nhaw-haw:  \"Well, John, that is one of your salt speculations.\"\r\n\r\nThe election in the fall of 1838 resulted in the choice of a\r\nDemocratic governor and state legislature, which, according to the\r\npolitics of the time, involved an entire change of state officials\r\nand employees.  Mr. Wall became a member of the Board of Public\r\nWorks, and was assigned, among other works, to the charge of the\r\nMuskingum improvement.  In the course of a few months, I think\r\nabout the last of June, 1839, Col. Curtis was removed, and Mr.\r\nMacaboy was appointed superintendent in his place.  At first it\r\nwas uncertain whether changes would be made in the subordinates of\r\nthe corps.  Some of its members had become so much attached to Col.\r\nCurtis that they thought it right and proper to send him a letter\r\nexpressing in substance their regret at his removal, their high\r\nestimate of his services, and thanks for his kindness to them.\r\nThis was signed by Mr. Coffinberry, Mr. Burwell, Mr. Love and\r\nmyself.  I am not certain that the others did not express the same\r\nfriendly feelings, but, at all events, the four whose names I have\r\nmentioned were summarily dropped from the service.\r\n\r\nThus, after two years of faithful work with small pay, I was, at\r\nthe age of sixteen, turned adrift on account of politics.\r\n\r\nI find among my papers, dingy with age, the correspondence with\r\nCol. Curtis, and also the subsequent correspondence between Mr.\r\nWall and myself, in respect to my removal.  My letter to Mr. Wall\r\nwas a disclaimer of any intention of disrespect to him in our letter\r\nto Col. Curtis, and his reply was that we alleged that Col. Curtis\r\nwas removed without a cause, which he denied.  I have no doubt,\r\nfrom a present reading of the papers, but that he would have retained\r\nme as a juvenile offender if I had made a suitable apology, but\r\nthe instinct of a boy to stand up for his party was strong.  I was\r\na Whig of sixteen, and it was glorious to be a victim of\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\nI also find among my papers of that time, which I thought worthy\r\nof preservation, a multitude of essays on as many different subjects,\r\nand some efforts at poetry, all of which I consign to flames.  Most\r\nboys have had the same experience.  The only benefit I derived was\r\nthe habit I formed of writing upon such subjects as attracted my\r\nattention by reading, a habit I continued when studying law, in\r\npreparing a case for trial, and in preparation for a debate in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI returned at once to Lancaster.  The great financial depression,\r\ncommencing in 1837, was now at its height.  It was said that Ohio\r\nState six per cent. bonds had been sold at fifty cents on the\r\ndollar.  Many banks were embarrassed and refused to discount notes,\r\nwhile several failed, and their circulating notes became worthless.\r\nI found that Lancaster had especially suffered, that many of its\r\nleading business firms had suspended or were on the brink of failure.\r\nI was then in excellent health, tall and slender and willing to\r\nwork.  I received temporary employment from Dr. Kreider, who was\r\neither Clerk of the Court or Recorder of Deeds, I do not remember\r\nwhich.  He gave me a dollar and a half a day, which I regarded as\r\na great favor, but the records were soon made up and I had nothing\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period of my life that I fell into very bad habits.\r\nMany of the boys about my age who were with me in Howe's school\r\nwere still about Lancaster, and were out of employment like myself.\r\nWe would meet on the street, or at the post office, or some place\r\nof resort, to talk over old times, and got into the habit of drinking\r\npoor wine, mostly made of diluted whiskey and drugs.  The general\r\nhabit of drinking spirits was more common than now, but I had not\r\nbeen subject to this temptation, as Col. Curtis was very strict in\r\nprohibiting all such drinking.  With the jolly good fellows I met\r\nat Lancaster who had nothing to do, I could not refuse to join in\r\ndrinking the health of each other, and thus I was conscious frequently\r\nof being more or less intoxicated.  On one occasion, in the fall\r\nof 1839, I went home very sick from drinking.  My mother received\r\nme with much surprise and sorrow, but neither complained nor scolded,\r\nand, with the utmost kindness, put me to bed and watched over and\r\ncared for me.  I was not stupid enough to be unconscious of my\r\ndegradation and her affection, and then and there resolved never\r\nto be in such a condition again, and from that time to this I am\r\nnot conscious of having been under the influence of liquor.  I have\r\npartaken of wine and spirits at weddings, feasts and dinners, I\r\nhave used it as a medicine, and in response to toasts and compliments,\r\nbut never to an extent to addle my brain or disturb my walk.\r\n\r\nAt that time intemperance was a common vice.  Of the young men who\r\nwere my contemporaries a very large proportion became habitual\r\ndrunkards and died prematurely.  No reform in my time has been so\r\ngeneral and beneficial as that of the disuse of drinking intoxicating\r\nliquors, commencing in 1841.  Formerly liquors were put on the\r\nsideboard or table, and the invitation \"take a drink\" was as common\r\nthen as \"take a seat\" is now.  This method of treating was shared\r\nin by preachers of the Gospel, and by all who observed the courtesies\r\nof social life.  Now these conditions have greatly changed.  Whisky\r\nis banished to the drug store, the grocery and the saloon, and even\r\nthere it is under surveillance and so highly taxed as to furnish\r\na large proportion of the national revenue.\r\n\r\nSome time in the autumn of 1839 I visited Mansfield for the first\r\ntime, on some business for General Reese, and it was then arranged\r\nthat early in the next spring I should return to study law with my\r\nbrother Charles.  Mansfield was then a very unattractive village,\r\nbadly located on parallel ridges and valleys, but precisely in the\r\ncenter of the very large county of Richland, then containing 900\r\nsquare miles.  The county covered a part of the high table-land\r\nthat separated the waters of Lake Erie and the Ohio River.  It was\r\nan almost unbroken forest during the War of 1812, with a few families\r\nliving in log houses, protected by block houses of logs from the\r\nincursions of Indians, many of whom lived in the county.  After\r\nthe war it was rapidly settled, chiefly from Pennsylvania, and\r\ndivided into farms of 160 acres or less, according to the new\r\ncongressional plan of townships six miles square, sections one mile\r\nsquare, and subdivisions of forty, eight, and one hundred and sixty\r\nacres.  The topography of the country was high and rolling, from\r\n900 to 1,350 feet above the sea, with innumerable springs of the\r\npurest water, and small streams and creeks, all rising in the county\r\nand flowing north or south into the Muskingum or Sandusky rivers.\r\nThe timber was oak, sugar, elm, hickory and other deciduous trees.\r\nThis valuable timber was the chief obstruction to the farmers.  It\r\nhad to be deadened or cut away to open up a clearing for the cabin\r\nand the field.  The labor of two or three generations was required\r\nto convert it into the picturesque, beautiful and healthy region\r\nit now is.\r\n\r\nThe village of Mansfield has been converted into a flourishing city\r\nof more than 15,000 inhabitants, with extensive manufacturing\r\nestablishments and a network of railroads reaching out to Cleveland,\r\nChicago, Pittsburg, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis.  There\r\nwas no sign of this development when I first visited the place.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Lancaster I applied myself closely to study and\r\nreading, mainly of history.  I read Hume, Smollett and Miller's\r\nhistories of England, Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire,\" and such histories of the United States as I could procure.\r\nIt was at this time that the memorable \"Log Cabin and Hard Cider\r\nCampaign\" of 1840 commenced.  General Harrison had been nominated\r\nin December, 1839, at Harrisburg, by the Whig party.  He was a\r\ndistinguished general in the War of 1812, but had lived mainly a\r\nquiet, modest life on his farm at South Bend, near Cincinnati.\r\nThe Democratic papers ridiculed him as a feeble old man, living in\r\na cabin and drinking hard cider.  The Whigs turned these sarcasms\r\nwith great effect upon their adversaries.  They compared the old\r\nsoldier and his excellent war record, living in a cabin with the\r\nlatch string out and eating corn bread, with \"Matty Van, the used\r\nup man,\" living in a palace, with roast beef every day, eating from\r\nsilver plate, with gold spoons, and drawing a salary of $25,000 a\r\nyear.  This was no doubt demagoguism, but there was back of it the\r\ngreat questions of protection to American industries, sound and\r\nstable currency, and the necessity of economy in public expenditures.\r\nA great meeting was held in Columbus in February, 1840.  In the\r\nprocession were log cabins, filled with farmers and hauled by a\r\nnumber of horses and oxen, and hard cider was on tap for all who\r\nchose to drink.  Songs were improvised, especially by Greiner, the\r\npoet of the canvass.  One of these songs, with the refrain, \"The\r\nLog Cabin Candidate will March to Washington,\" became famous and\r\nprophetic.\r\n\r\nSome time in March, 1840, taking the stage for Mansfield, I saw\r\nsigns of political excitement all along the way, even at that early\r\nperiod of the canvass.  My sister Susan, two years younger than I,\r\nwas with me.  We met with no adventure worthy of notice until we\r\narrived at our destination, when, in ascending the hill to the\r\npublic square, the coach slipped and fell over on its side.  This\r\nwe considered a bad omen.  It was not, however, an unusual accident,\r\nas the roads were always bad in March, and the coaches of the day\r\nnot worthy of the name.  We were heartily welcomed into the family\r\nof Robert McComb, who had married my sister, Amelia.\r\n\r\nI was to study law, but under the laws of Ohio I could not be\r\nadmitted to practice until I arrived at the age of twenty-one years.\r\nOur liberal laws presumed that a man of ordinary capacity could\r\nmaster this profession in two years.  What was I to do during the\r\ntwo spare years?  This question was left to the decision of my\r\nuncle, Judge Parker, husband of my father's only sister.  He was\r\na peculiar character, and, as I will have occasion to refer to him\r\nagain, I will give of him a brief biography.  He was born in Nova\r\nScotia.  His father was a merchant of some wealth who early decided\r\nthat his son should be educated in Ohio, and chose for him the\r\ncollege at Athens.  There young Parker not only received his\r\ncollegiate diploma, but became thoroughly attached to western habits\r\nand opinions.  He studied law with my father at Lancaster, and,\r\nwhen admitted to the bar, went to Mansfield, where he practiced\r\nlaw.  He was genial, social, and especially fond of the society of\r\nyoung people.  I have often seen him stop on the streets of Mansfield\r\nto watch boys playing marbles.  He was conceded to be an able\r\nlawyer, perhaps the best land lawyer and special pleader in that\r\npart of Ohio.  But he was not an advocate, partly owing to occasional\r\nstuttering, but in jury cases employed my father until the latter\r\nbecame a judge of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker had for some years before 1840 retired from active\r\npractice, and was engaged with Robert McComb as a general merchant.\r\nDuring, or about 1842, he was elected by the legislature of Ohio\r\npresiding judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and became eminently\r\npopular, and deservedly so.  He was to be my guide and counselor.\r\n\r\nA few words in regard to my brother, Charles Taylor, will explain\r\nour relations, the confidence he reposed in me, and my deep\r\nobligations to him.  He was then a bachelor thirty years old, with\r\nquite a lucrative practice, mainly in collecting debts due to New\r\nYork and other eastern merchants.  Our banking system was then as\r\nbad as it could be, exchange on New York was always at a premium,\r\nand there was no confidence in our local banks.  Charles was\r\nsubstantially the banker in Mansfield and surrounding counties for\r\neastern merchants.  He was a good speaker when he addressed a judge,\r\nand his briefs were clear statements of the law of the case, but\r\nwhen forced to speak to a jury he was exceedingly shy and sensitive.\r\nHe avoided jury trials.  He was a fair speaker on popular topics,\r\nand took great interest in current politics as a Whig.  He was a\r\nmember of the Harrisburg convention that nominated General Harrison\r\nfor President, and made several creditable speeches in that canvass.\r\nHe was married in the fall of 1840 to Miss Elizabeth Williams, of\r\nDayton, Ohio, and I became a member of his family soon after.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the special traits and tendencies of Judge Parker\r\nand my brother Charles upon my life was soon manifest.  My course\r\nof study, outlined by Judge Parker, commenced with Blackstone,\r\nfollowed soon after by Coke on Littleton.  As a compromise I was\r\nallowed to read Kent's Commentaries, but Chitty's Pleadings had to\r\ngo along with Kent.  The disinclination of Charles to have anything\r\nto do with contested litigation became more marked, and I was\r\ncompelled, long before my admission to the bar, to look after such\r\ncases as grew out of his practice.  The pleadings then in vogue\r\nwere the declarations, pleas and replications of the English common\r\nlaw.  These I prepared after I had been a student for a year, and,\r\nin cases within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, I\r\nhabitually appeared either in prosecution or defense.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, I was often outwitted and defeated, much to\r\nmy chagrin.  In one case submitted to arbitration, a pettifogger\r\nof bad repute by the name of Baldwin secured an award palpably\r\nunjust.  I felt more keenly than my client the injustice done him,\r\nand never forgave Baldwin until he was indicted for perjury and\r\ndriven out of the county in disgrace.\r\n\r\nWhile pursuing my studies, I was able in various ways to make enough\r\nmoney to support myself.  I wrote deeds and agreements, and drew\r\nthe first map of Richland county, showing subdivisions in farms,\r\nthe course of creeks and rivulets, and roads.  I was also employed\r\nto collect small debts, and, toward the close of my probation, I\r\nwas intrusted with large collections, one of which was in closing\r\nthe business of an old firm with outstanding credits of more than\r\n$20,000.\r\n\r\nIn those days of primitive barter the merchant was the banker of\r\nall the farmers dealing with him.  The farmer sold to the merchant\r\nmost of his surplus products, including live stock and pork, and\r\npurchased his supplies, mainly of clothing, tea, coffee, and the\r\nlike, and the merchant made advances on the growing crop.  At the\r\nclose of the year the account was settled, generally with a balance\r\nin favor of the merchant.  Little money was used.  It was a traffic\r\nin commodities.  It was not unusual for the merchant to drive horses\r\nand cattle to Pittsburg or further east, and send the proceeds to\r\nthe eastern merchant.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the year it was quite common for the farmer to load\r\nupon his wagon his surplus wheat and haul it fifty miles to Sandusky\r\nand Milan, receiving in return salt and farming implements, and\r\nthe balance in money.  Wheat was then the only article that would\r\ncommand cash.  At this season the highway was often blocked with\r\nlong trains of wagons that would not give way for other vehicles.\r\nAt night the wagons would be parked on the roadside near a creek,\r\nand the farmers and their boys would have a regular joyous picnic\r\non provisions brought from home.  This was the life of a farmer\r\nbefore the days of railroads, and I am not sure but it was a more\r\nhappy one than now.  Then the village blacksmith or shoemaker, the\r\ntinker, the carpenter and the mechanic of every trade had his shop\r\nand was a far more important and independent citizen than now, when\r\ngrouped into large manufacturing and machine works.\r\n\r\nWhile a student, I was frequently sent by my brother to Wooster,\r\nthe nearest bank, with large sums of money to purchase exchange on\r\nNew York for his clients.  These trips I always made on horseback.\r\nOnce, as I was to start quite early in the morning, I received\r\nnearly $2,000 in bills the night before, in two packages, and placed\r\nthem in my overcoat.  In the morning I threw my overcoat over my\r\narm and went for my horse.  Before mounting I felt for the money\r\nand found it was gone.  I started in alarm for the house and on my\r\nway found one package of $1,000 lying on the sidewalk at the corner\r\nof the street where I had passed, but the other was nowhere to be\r\nseen.  I felt sure it was picked up by some one.  I at once gave\r\nnotice to my brother, and he took immediate measures to trace the\r\nfinder.  I cannot express the chagrin and anxiety which I suffered\r\non account of my carelessness, but Charles uttered no reproach,\r\nbut prepared to replace the loss.  Fortunately within a month the\r\nlost money was traced to an \"early drunkard,\" who found the package\r\non the pavement while going for his morning grog.  He was watched\r\nand at night was seen to take some money from his trunk.  A search\r\nwarrant soon led to the restoration of the money, except a small\r\nsum he had spent.  This incident attached me the more to my brother.\r\n\r\nThe social life in Mansfield, while I was a student, was very\r\npleasant and instructive.  The freedom, and yet propriety of\r\nintercourse among the young people, was notable.  We had social\r\nmeetings, parties, dances, and an occasional ball during the winter,\r\nbut in summer, riding in carriages and on horseback was the recreation\r\nof the day.  Fleming's Ravine, about five miles from Mansfield,\r\nwas the general gathering place for young and old.  A small stream\r\nhad cut a deep ravine with rocky banks on either side.  An old mill\r\nwith its overshot wheel spanned the ravine and filled it with noisy\r\nrattle.  The adjacent woods, where the fire was lit and the coffee\r\nmade, and the farm lands stretching beyond, made a picturesque\r\nscene often described and always admired.  Here we had dances,\r\nfrolics, speeches and fun, with healthy exercise in the open air.\r\nThese frolics were often made the subject of description in the\r\nnewspapers.  On a notable occasion of one of these visits to\r\nFleming's Ravine, Mr. Franklin Barker, a law student, wrote for\r\none of the local papers a pleasing description of the scene under\r\nthe name of \"The Fairy's Tale.\"  He paraphrased Byron as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"There was a sound of revelry by _day_\r\n   And Richland's capital gathered then\r\n   Her beauty and her chivalry and fair eyes\r\n   Looked love to eyes that spoke again.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the persons present were named, or so described as to be\r\nrecognized.  There was a good deal of egotism and assumption in\r\nthe narrative which created much feeling among those who had not\r\nthe good fortune to attend.  Though I was present, and greatly\r\nenjoyed the picnic, I thought it was a good opportunity to prick\r\nthe bubble of self esteem assumed by Barker, and wrote for the\r\nrival newspaper a counter description signed \"A Looker On.\"  This\r\nexcited a good deal of interest at the time, but it has probably\r\nfaded, after half a century, from the memory of the few who survive;\r\nit then created a rivalry and left its mark upon the future.  The\r\ndestruction of the mill by a flood, the cutting away of the wood\r\nand other causes, have changed this, so that the gathering place\r\nof the young of my day is a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nDuring my study of law, the bar at Mansfield was considered a very\r\nable one, including among its members James Stewart, Thomas W.\r\nBartley, Jacob Brinkerhoff, Charles Sherman and others.  All of\r\nthose named became judges, either of the courts of Ohio or of the\r\nUnited States.  During the same period there were also many law\r\nstudents in the offices of these gentlemen, among them Samuel J.\r\nKirkwood, George W. Geddes, Thomas H. Ford, Henry C. Hedges, Willard\r\nSlocum, Joseph Newman, Patrick Hull and others, who afterwards\r\nbecame distinguished in civil or military life.  These students,\r\nmyself among the number, organized a moot court, presided over by\r\nJoseph Newman, then in active practice as a partner of Mr. Stewart.\r\nWe held famous moot courts in which cases were tried with all the\r\nearnestness, industry and skill that could have been evoked by real\r\ncases.  In these trials Mr. Kirkwood and I were usually pitted\r\nagainst each other, although he studied late in life, and was then\r\nmore than thirty years old.  He was then a Democrat, but moved to\r\nIowa in 1856, became a Republican war governor of that state and\r\nUnited States Senator.  I have always regarded our contests in this\r\nmoot court as the most important part of my legal training.\r\n\r\nThe course of study pursued under the direction of Judge Parker\r\ncontinued until my admission to the bar, though much interrupted\r\nby the variety and nature of my employment.  I read, in addition\r\nto the routine works prescribed by Judge Parker, a great variety\r\nof literary and historical works, and had substantially practiced\r\nmy profession a year or more in advance of my admission to the bar.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the age of twenty-one on the 10th day of May, 1844,\r\nand promptly on time on that day I was presented to the Supreme\r\nCourt \"on the circuit,\" then sitting at Springfield, Ohio, for\r\nadmission to the bar.  Several other students were presented, and,\r\naccording to the custom of that time, we were all referred to a\r\ncommittee composed of General Samson Mason, Hon. Charles Anthony,\r\nand one other lawyer whose name I do not recall.  All were leading\r\nlawyers of that place, and had been busily occupied in the court.\r\nWe met that evening at the office of one of these gentlemen to pass\r\nthe ordeal for which we had been preparing for years.  A few\r\nquestions were put to us which were answered, when some question\r\nwas asked, the answer to which led to a decided difference of\r\nopinion among the examiners, and a practical suspension of our\r\nexamination.  It soon occurred to them that they were more interested\r\nin the cases coming on \"to-morrow\" than in our efficiency as\r\nincipient lawyers.  I was asked under whom I studied.  I answered\r\nJudge Parker, and they all agreed that anyone who was certified by\r\nhim ought to be admitted.\r\n\r\nMy old and dearest friend, and boon companion, Dr. J. C. Buckingham,\r\nof Springfield, was then entering upon his profession.  He was an\r\nadmirable penman.  He obtained leave of the clerk of the court, to\r\nwrite out my certificate of admission as a member of the bar, and\r\nthis he did in beautiful form, handsomely illustrated.  He attached\r\nto it an enormous seal, and it was duly signed by the clerk of the\r\ncourt.  I have kept it as a memento of him, but have never had\r\noccasion to present it to anyone.  He, poor fellow, died prematurely\r\nat Springfield, when in the full employment of his duties as a\r\nphysician, and with the most hopeful prospects of success in his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nI must not forget that in my boyhood days I had a strong penchant\r\nfor military parade.  I remember well the respect always shown to\r\nRevolutionary veterans, who survived to the period of my boyhood.\r\nAt every meeting, political or otherwise, where these soldiers\r\nappeared to share in the assemblage of citizens, they were received\r\nwith profound respect.  Hats came off.  They were given the best\r\nseats, and every mark of honor was shown them.  What boy did not\r\nfeel the gushings of patriotic emotion when one of these old veterans\r\nappeared upon the stage.  To a less degree, similar marks of respect\r\nwere shown to the soldiers of the War of 1812; but, though this\r\nwas as great and important an event in our history, it did not\r\nlight the spark of patriotic fire like the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nBefore the war for the Union broke out, military spirit died away,\r\nespecially in Ohio.  Military organizations had fallen into disuse\r\nand popular contempt.  We had, it is true, in times far apart, what\r\nwere called militia musters, but Jack Falstaff's regiment was\r\nnothing to our militia.  I had the honor to be a member of the\r\nstaff of Colonel Urie, of Ashland, when the venerable General Wilson\r\nwas the Commander-in-Chief of the militia of that part of Ohio.\r\nHe was a hero of the War of 1812, and, as I remember, a gallant\r\nand fine-looking old gentleman.  The regiment--so called--without\r\nguns, uniform, or anything proper for a soldier, was with some\r\ndifficulty formed into line, but a wavering line, across the public\r\nsquare at Mansfield and along East and West Market streets, when,\r\nby some misunderstanding of orders, the right of the regiment\r\nmarched to the right, and the left to the left.  With some difficulty,\r\nand a good deal of swearing, they were brought back into line and\r\ndismissed.  Militia day was a day of drunkenness and fighting.  No\r\nwonder that years passed without muster.  Such was the military\r\ncondition of the United States when the War of the Rebellion sounded\r\nthe tocsin of alarm, and our generation was called upon to meet\r\nthe gravest struggle in American history.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOHIO, ITS HISTORY AND RESOURCES.\r\nOccupation by the Indians--Washington's Expedition to the Head of\r\nthe Ohio River--Commencement of the History of the State--Topography,\r\nCharacteristics, etc., in 1787--Arrival of the First Pioneers--The\r\nTreaty of Greenville--Census of 1802 Showed a Population of 45,028\r\nPersons--Occupation of the \"Connecticut Reserve\"--Era of Internal\r\nImprovement--Value of Manufactures in 1890--Vast Resources of the\r\nBuckeye State--Love of the \"Ohio Man\" for His Native State.\r\n\r\nThe life of a man is greatly influenced by the place of his birth,\r\nthe surroundings of his boyhood, and the habits and customs of the\r\ncommunity in which he lived.  As I have been all my life a resident\r\nof Ohio, and for more than forty years have been one of its\r\nrepresentatives in Congress, or the Cabinet, I feel that a brief\r\nsketch of the history and resources of the state may not be out of\r\nplace in this biography.  No adequate history of the state has been\r\nwritten, though many works have given general outlines.  The\r\nmaterials are copious, but I can only state a few events that mark\r\nthe changes in its civilization.  That it was once occupied by a\r\nrace now entirely extinct is evidenced by numerous mounds, earthworks\r\nand lines of fortifications so extensive as to have required to\r\nconstruct them a dense population with a knowledge of mathematics\r\nfar beyond that of any tribe or race existing on the American\r\ncontinent, when discovered by Columbus.  The works of the mound\r\nbuilders can be seen, and have been described, but no ray of light\r\nhas been cast upon, or plausible suggestion made to account for,\r\nthe origin, existence or disappearance of this race.\r\n\r\nLong after the settlement on the Atlantic Coast of the Thirteen\r\nColonies, the territory now included in the State of Ohio was part\r\nof a vast unknown region north and west of the Ohio River.  It was\r\nroamed over by numerous tribes of Indians living in tents of bark\r\nor skins, whose residence was generally as transitory as that of\r\nthe wandering tribes of Arabia.  Many of these Indian tribes were\r\ncomposed of a few families under the domination of a chief who went\r\nout from his kindred as Abraham did, and planted his tents where\r\nfancy led him, and moved at his whim or with his game.  Every one\r\nof the Indian tribes that had been driven by the white man from\r\nthe east and the south chose his camping and hunting grounds in\r\nthe region of the O-hi-o, often driving away a weaker tribe.  Their\r\ncontests with white men had given them some knowledge of fire-arms,\r\nand some of them had been marshaled under arms in the wars between\r\nthe English and the French, but, as a rule, the Indians encountered\r\nby our race since the landing at Jamestown were all of the same\r\ntype of wandering savages.  The difference between these tribes\r\ncan be accounted for by their location, whether on the seashore or\r\nin the forest or plain, and by the strength of the tribe, from the\r\npowerful Six Nations to the feeble band in possession of some chosen\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the irrepressible conflicts between the\r\nwhite man and the Indians, waged often with savage and relentless\r\ncruelties on both sides, it may as truly be said that the same\r\nsavage conflicts have been carried on between the different tribes\r\nof Indians, which often ended by the extermination of the weaker\r\ntribe, or the absorption of the feeble remnant with the stronger\r\ntribe.  This was certainly the case with the Indian tribes of the\r\nnorthwest territory.  Ohio was the battleground for destructive\r\nwarfare between the Indian tribes long before the white man gained\r\na foothold on its soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1755, when the war with France commenced, the English settlements\r\ncovered the Atlantic Coast, but did not extend across the Alleghany\r\nMountains, though a few hardy pioneers may have wandered into the\r\nwilderness beyond.  But French missionaries, inspired with religious\r\nzeal, had penetrated all the northwest territory, including the\r\ngreat lakes.  In 1673 Marquette and Joliet, two of these missionaries,\r\nafter years spent with the Indians on the shores of the lakes,\r\nwinning their confidence by humility and care, followed the lines\r\nof the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers from the shores of Lake Michigan,\r\nand discovered the great river \"with a joy that could not be\r\nexpressed,\" and floated upon its waters to the mouth of the\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read the interesting narratives of these\r\nmissionaries, of their life among the Indians of the northwest,\r\nand their enthusiastic description of the new and wonderful land\r\nthey had discovered, without a feeling of admiration and reverence.\r\nThe adventures and trials of these zealous priests read like romance;\r\nbut their description of natural scenes, of great rivers, mountains\r\nand plains, now familiar to fifteen million of people, attest the\r\naccuracy of their statements and the courage and zeal with which\r\nthey pursued their task.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Marquette was diligently followed by Chevalier de\r\nla Salle, a knight of fortune, of wonderful endurance, who, after\r\novercoming incredible difficulties, conducted an expedition by the\r\nway of the lakes and the Mississippi River to its mouth.  Thus the\r\nKing of France, by the piety and zeal of a priest and the courage\r\nof an adventurer, was able to base his claims to fully half the\r\ncontinent of North America upon grounds recognized as valid by\r\nEuropean law, namely, the discovery of the St. Lawrence, the\r\noccupation of Canada, and the discovery of the Mississippi from\r\nits source to its mouth.  The great body of the continent is drained\r\nby these two rivers.  Their discovery and occupation was sufficient\r\nat that time to give to France the right of exclusive possession\r\nof that vast territory, for the title of the Indian tribes was not\r\nconsidered valid by Christian powers.  While the priests of France\r\nwere seeking to save the souls of the Indians, the Kings of France\r\nwere seeking to rob them of their property.\r\n\r\nThe French, during this period, erected a line of posts from the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi, by way of the Wabash, Maumee and the\r\nlakes, to Montreal, and finally, in 1733, established a line of\r\nposts from Lake Erie to the junction of the Monongahela and Alleghany\r\nRivers, where Pittsburg now stands, and claimed the whole country\r\nnorth of the Ohio from its source to its mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd here, for the first time, comes into view the majestic form of\r\nGeorge Washington, then a young man of twenty-two.  He was sent by\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, to visit the several Indian tribes\r\nat the head of the Ohio River and the French forces at Venango.\r\nIn the dead of winter he made his trip into the wilderness, and\r\nsoon ascertained that it was the fixed purpose of the French\r\nauthorities to occupy all the country to the sources of the Ohio,\r\nincluding a large section of what is now a part of Pennsylvania\r\nand New York.  The commander, St. Pierre, declared his purpose of\r\nseizing every Englishman within the Ohio valley.  The result of\r\nthe expedition of Washington left no choice to the English government,\r\nexcept to abandon their claim to the northwest territory, or to\r\ndeclare war.  The English title was based upon their occupation of\r\nthe shores of the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Georgia.\r\nIt was claimed that this occupation carried the right to possession\r\nwestward from sea to sea.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest grants to the colonies, especially to Virginia and\r\nConnecticut, their western boundaries extended to the South Sea.\r\nWhere the South Sea lay, and what was the breadth of the continent,\r\nwas not defined by these kingly grants.  James I and his councilors\r\nthen knew but little about America.  There was no way to settle\r\nthis disputed title between the two powers but by war.  A Virginia\r\ncompany had built a fort on the south side of the Ohio, below the\r\nsite of the present city of Pittsburg.  In 1754 the French troops\r\noccupied the point at the junction of the Monongahela and Alleghany,\r\nwhere the city of Pittsburg now is, and erected a fort.\r\n\r\nThen followed the well-known war of the French and English, Braddock's\r\ndefeat, the heroism of Washington, the capture of Quebec and the\r\ncession of Canada and the northwestern territory to Great Britain.\r\nIt is impossible to overrate the importance of these events upon\r\nthe future of America.  The result was that the region east of the\r\nMississippi River and north of the Ohio River was the property of\r\nGreat Britain and the inheritance of the English race.  The great\r\nnorthwest was theirs, and fairly won.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the French title to the Ohio territory was at\r\nonce followed by the claims of several colonies to parts of this\r\nterritory under grants from the British crown; but the English\r\ngovernment declared all the land west of the sources of the Atlantic\r\nrivers as under the dominion of the king for the use of the Indians,\r\nand all persons were forbidden to settle or remain within it.  This\r\ndispute was postponed by the War of the Revolution.  An event during\r\nthe war, apparently of small importance, had a controlling influence\r\nin securing to the United States the northwestern territory.\r\n\r\nThe State of Virginia, claiming title under a grant from the British\r\ncrown to the regions west of the Alleghanies, in 1778, organized\r\nan expedition, under Colonel George Rogers Clark, to punish and\r\nrepel incursions of Indians, and capture the old French posts then\r\nheld by the English.  This he accomplished, so that when negotiations\r\nfor peace were entered upon in 1782 our plenipotentiaries could\r\nmaintain the title of the United States to the northwestern territory,\r\nnot only by grants to the English colonies, but by conquest in war,\r\nand actual possession at the time of the negotiations.  The British\r\ninsisted on making the Ohio River a boundary of the United States.\r\nMr. Adams said that sooner than yield the western territory he\r\nwould exhort his countrymen to continue the war as long as they\r\ncould keep a soldier in the field.  Mr. Jay was equally determined,\r\nand finally the line of the lakes was agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace recognized the St. Lawrence, the lakes and the\r\n49th parallel of latitude as the dividing line between the United\r\nStates and Canada.  But the question arose whether the western\r\nterritory was the property of the United States as the result of\r\ntheir joint struggle for independence, or of the several states\r\nunder the grants of the English crown.  This dangerous controversy\r\ndelayed the formation of the federal government; but it was happily\r\nsettled by the cession of the territory to the United States, with\r\nor without conditions and reservations, by the several states\r\nclaiming western lands.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this cession and settlement, and almost equal in\r\nimportance to the constitution of the United States, was the\r\ncelebrated ordinance organizing the northwestern territory.  This\r\nordinance guaranteed the subdivision of the territory into states,\r\nand secured to them, by a perpetual compact, the forms and substance\r\nof a republican government, a proper disposition of the public\r\nlands, and the formal prohibition of slavery in the territories,\r\nand may be properly considered the commencement of the history of\r\nthe State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nWe may here pause to consider the condition, topography and\r\ncharacteristics of the Territory, now the State, of Ohio in 1787,\r\nwhen the first territorial government was organized by Congress.\r\nIt was bounded on the south and east by the Ohio River, touching\r\non its northeast border the States of Pennsylvania and New York;\r\non the north by Lake Erie, and on the west by an arbitrary line\r\nnot then defined, and contained about 40,000 square miles.  Its\r\ntopography may be described as an elevated plain, its highest\r\nelevation being 1,540 feet above the sea, its lowest depression\r\nbeing 440 feet above the sea, and its mean altitude about 800 feet\r\nabove the sea.  It is traversed by the comb of a watershed between\r\nthe river and the lakes, running from northeast to southwest across\r\nthe state, much nearer the lake than the river, at an elevation\r\nabove the sea of from 1,000 to 1,300 feet.  The shed on either side\r\nis penetrated by rivers of clear, pure water, in valleys of great\r\nfertility, and usually with hillsides of a gentle slope and fertile\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 it was an unbroken wilderness covered with great forests\r\nand sparsely inhabited by savage tribes of Indians, only here and\r\nthere tempered by the civilizing teachings of the missionary.  One\r\nof the earliest descriptions I find of the famous Miami Valley is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"The land beyond the Scioto, except the first twenty miles, is rich\r\nand level, bearing walnut trees of huge size, the maple, the wild\r\ncherry and the ash; full of little streams and rivulets; variegated\r\nby beautiful natural prairies, covered with wild rye, blue grass\r\nand white clover.  Turkeys abounded, and deer and elks, and most\r\nsorts of game; of buffaloes, thirty or forty were frequently seen\r\nfeeding in one meadow.  Nothing is wanting but cultivation to make\r\nthis a most delightful country.\"\r\n\r\nThis favored land was thrown open for settlement at a time when\r\nthe people of the states had been impoverished by the war, when\r\nthere was neither money, credit nor commerce, when the government\r\nof the Continental Congress had fallen into contempt, and the new\r\ngovernment was passing the ordeal of a vote in states jealous of\r\neach other.  It was the only land subject to sale by the United\r\nStates, for Kentucky was covered by Virginia grants, Western New\r\nYork was the property of land companies, and all beyond was a _terra\r\nincognita_.  There was a struggle for Ohio land among all the\r\nnorthern states, including Virginia and Maryland.  Companies were\r\nformed, composed mostly of officers and soldiers of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, to secure from Congress favorable land grants.  Virginia and\r\nConnecticut had their ample reserves, New York had a large unoccupied\r\nregion in her territory, and the other northern states demanded\r\ntheir shares in the common property of the United States.  The\r\nresult was that all the states established settlements in Ohio,\r\nand, for the first time in our history, the descendants of the\r\nPuritans of New England, the Dutch of New York, the Germans and\r\nScotch-Irish of Pennsylvania, the Jersey Blues, the Catholics of\r\nMaryland, the Cavaliers of Virginia and the loyal refugees of Canada\r\nunited their blood and fortunes in establishing a purely American\r\nstate on the soil of Ohio.\r\n\r\nAmong these early settlers were the foremost men of all the states,\r\nthe Revolutionary stock that won independence, who carried their\r\nlove of liberty and the principles and instincts of their localities\r\nto a soil more fertile than any of the old states, and with natural\r\nresources, climate and facilities for settlement and civilization\r\nas favorable as any within their reach.  The limits of this sketch\r\nwill not permit details of the progress of this migration.  The\r\nfirst difficulty it encountered was the toilsome way to the promised\r\nland.  All roads, such as they were, crossed the Alleghany Mountains,\r\nor followed the longer route by the lakes.  A voyage now easily\r\nmade in a day then occupied sixty days on foot or on horseback,\r\nand every article of civilized life had to be transported with\r\npainful labor over rude paths and roads, relieved sometimes by\r\nbarges and canoes on creeks and rivers.\r\n\r\nWhen the first pioneers reached their destination, their land was\r\nalready occupied.  Every part of Ohio was then in the possession\r\nof Indians.  The war they had maintained with the pioneers of\r\nKentucky only prepared them for the desperate struggle with new\r\ninvaders.  The first settlement of the New England colony was made\r\nin Marietta, April, 1788.  From that day to the close of the war\r\nwith Great Britain in 1815 there were hostilities in some part of\r\nOhio with the Indians.  There is not a county in Ohio that was not\r\nat some time the scene of a battle with the Indians, or a skirmish,\r\nor a massacre.\r\n\r\nThe interesting \"Historical Collections,\" recently published by\r\nHenry Howe, give many details of this local warfare.  But, aside\r\nfrom the danger that lurked at all times over the cabin of the\r\npioneer, there were more regular battles with the Indians fought\r\non the soil of Ohio than in any other state of the Union.  The\r\ndefeat of General Harmer with 1,300 men, in 1790, in two battles\r\nin the Scioto valley, laid open to predatory warfare all the\r\nsettlements in Ohio, and some in Kentucky.  Every attempt at\r\nnegotiations was defeated by British interference.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1791, a force of over 2,000 men was organized\r\nat Cincinnati under General St. Clair, and marched against the\r\nIndians at the head waters of the Maumee.  While encamped they were\r\nattacked by the Indians and ignominiously defeated, losing a large\r\nnumber of officers and men.  They retreated in disorder, abandoning\r\ntheir baggage and artillery, and throwing away their arms and\r\naccoutrements.  The loss in this disastrous campaign was more than\r\n900 men, of whom 600 were killed.  This calamity spread terror\r\nthroughout all the settlements as far as Pittsburg, and arrested\r\nfor a time the migration to Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe successive defeats of Harmer and St. Clair greatly impressed\r\nGeneral Washington with the necessity of marching an overwhelming\r\nforce against the Indians, and he appealed to Congress for the\r\nnecessary aid; but there was a manifest reluctance in Congress to\r\nvote supplies, even if the failure to do so involved the abandonment\r\nto the Indians of all the territory northwest of the Ohio.  The\r\nsupplies, however, were granted, and General Wayne, a Revolutionary\r\nhero, was placed in command.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1794, with a force of over 3,000 men, he advanced to\r\nthe confluence of the Maumee and the Auglaize, and there destroyed\r\nthe Indian villages and their abundant crops.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Indians down the Maumee to a fort recently built by\r\nthe British, the forces of General Wayne attacked the Indians and\r\ninflicted upon them a disastrous defeat.  This victory settled\r\nforever the occupancy of this territory by the white man, and the\r\nirreversible fate of the poor Indian, though, as it will appear\r\nhereafter, he struggled for this, his favorite region, for twenty\r\nyears more.\r\n\r\nIn looking back over a period of one hundred years it is impossible\r\nto suppress a sense of injustice, and a feeling of sympathy for\r\nthe Indian in his unequal struggle.  After their defeat by General\r\nWayne, a general conference of all the Indian tribes in the northwest\r\nwas proposed, and agreed upon, to be held during the following year\r\nat Greenville.  The full details of this conference are given by\r\nJudge Burnet, in his \"Notes on the Northwestern Territory.\"  General\r\nWayne, in many \"council fires,\" explained to the chiefs of the\r\nnumerous tribes the terms of the treaties made at Forts McIntosh\r\nand Harmer, and demanded that they be ratified with additional\r\nconcessions and grants.  Many of the replies, in the figurative\r\nlanguage of the Indians, are eloquent appeals to their \"Great\r\nFather\" and their \"Elder Brothers\" to allow them to possess in\r\npeace the land of their fathers; that they were not represented\r\nwhen these treaties were made, and that their terms had not been\r\nobserved by their white brethren.\r\n\r\nIt was the same old story of injustice and wrong, of might against\r\nright.  They were compelled to accept the terms offered them.  The\r\nresult was the cession by the Indians to the United States of 25,000\r\nsquare miles of southern and eastern Ohio and many other tracts\r\nwest of Ohio.  The Indians were to receive in return $20,000 in\r\npresents, and an annuity of $9,500, to be distributed among the\r\ntribes.  By this treaty confidence was restored to the settlements,\r\nand the tide of migration was renewed, and continued until the\r\nbreaking out of the War of 1812.  But the treaty of Greenville did\r\nnot put an end to Indian hostilities.  They still occupied northwestern\r\nOhio, and that part of the reserve west of the Cuyahoga River.\r\nOccasional aggressions by both races led to outrages and murder,\r\nusually followed by encroachments on Indian territory.  In 1805\r\nthe remainder of the Western Reserve was ceded by treaty.  In 1818\r\nthe northwestern part of Ohio was purchased by the United States\r\nby treaty, subject to certain reservations, all of which were\r\nsubsequently ceded to the United States, the last by the Wyandots\r\nin 1842, when the remnant, about 700 souls, moved to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe most important, and by far the most dangerous, conspiracy of\r\nIndians since the treaty of Greenville was organized by the \"Prophet,\"\r\na crazy enthusiast denounced as an impostor and accused of witchcraft,\r\nand his brother, Tecumseh, a warrior of approved courage, possessed\r\nof all the craft of the Indian, with remarkable intelligence and\r\ncomprehensive views.  They united most of the tribes who had\r\nparticipated in that treaty, and threatened with death all the\r\nchiefs who were concerned in the subsequent treaties.  This excited\r\nthe attention of General Harrison, then Governor of the Territory\r\nof Indiana, who, in 1811, after many ineffectual conferences with\r\nTecumseh and the \"Prophet,\" organized a force of 800 men and marched\r\nagainst the \"Prophet's\" town, in what is now Cass county, Indiana.\r\nThe battle of Tippecanoe ensued, in which the Indians were totally\r\ndefeated and the town burned.  The loss of the troops was so great\r\nthat General Harrison made a speedy retreat.  The war with Great\r\nBritain soon followed, and Tecumseh entered the British service.\r\nHe participated in most of the battles in Ohio and Michigan during\r\nthat war, and was killed at the battle of the Thames on the 5th of\r\nOctober, 1813.  With him ended all organized Indian hostilities in\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1798 all the laws governing the northwestern territory\r\nwere selected from the laws of the states by the territorial judges\r\nappointed by the President.  In that year it was ascertained that\r\nthe territory contained 5,000 white male inhabitants, when they\r\nwere authorized, as a matter of right, to organize and elect\r\nrepresentatives to a general assembly, who, with a legislative\r\ncouncil, were authorized to pass laws, subject to the veto of the\r\ngovernor.  The general assembly was duly organized on the 16th of\r\nSeptember, 1799, and was remarkable for the ability and distinction\r\nof its members, most of whom had been soldiers in the Revolutionary\r\nWar.  This was the beginning of home rule in Ohio.  The life of\r\nthe territorial legislature was brief.  Early in January, 1802, a\r\ncensus was taken of the inhabitants in the eastern division of the\r\nTerritory, now the State of Ohio, by which it was found that it\r\ncontained 45,028 persons.  Congress promptly authorized the people\r\nto form a constitution and state government.  This authority was\r\nspeedily acted upon, a convention of thirty-five members was elected,\r\nand a constitution adopted November, 1802, without being submitted\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\nThis constitution remained unaltered in a single particular for\r\nfifty years.  It was regarded at the time, and ever since, as a\r\nmodel framework of state government, clear and brief in its\r\nprovisions, but comprehensive enough to meet the necessities of a\r\npeople growing in population from 45,000 to 1,980,329 in 1850.\r\nThe present constitution of Ohio was framed by a convention, which\r\nmet at Columbus, on the 6th of May, 1850, and adjourned on the 10th\r\nof March, 1851.  This constitution was ratified by a majority of\r\nthe people, and is still in force.\r\n\r\nThe decennial growth of the population of Ohio is here shown:\r\n\r\n  1802 . . . .    45,028\r\n  1810  . . .    230,760\r\n  1820 . . . .   381,295\r\n  1830  . . .    937,903\r\n  1840 . . . . 1,519,467\r\n  1850  . . .  1,980,329\r\n  1860 . . . . 2,339,511\r\n  1870  . . .  2,665,260\r\n  1880 . . . . 3,198,062\r\n  1890  . . .  3,672,316\r\n\r\nIn 1802 Ohio was eighteenth in rank among her sister states; in\r\n1810 the thirteenth; in 1820 the fifth; in 1830 the fourth; in 1840\r\nthe third, and so continued until the recent census when the\r\nmarvelous growth of Chicago placed Illinois in advance of Ohio.\r\nThis remarkable growth was accompanied by rapid changes in the\r\nhabits and conditions of the people.  Within a century they had\r\ntheir struggle with the Indians; then their contest with nature in\r\na new country covered by forests--the \"age of the pioneers;\" then\r\nthe period of internal improvements, when roads and canals and\r\nmeans of transportation were the great objects of desire; then the\r\nmarvelous development of railroads, followed by manufactures.\r\nThese changes, following in succession, are the most striking\r\nfeatures of the history of Ohio.  I have already referred to the\r\npioneers who planted the first settlement, who bore the brunt of\r\nIndian warfare, and firmly founded free institutions in Ohio.\r\n\r\nAfter this period, and the organization of the state government,\r\nthe great migration to Ohio commenced which, within a century, was\r\ndestined to extend across the continent.  The settler was generally\r\npoor, bringing all his earthly possessions, with wife and children,\r\nin a covered wagon, slowly traversing difficult roads to the new\r\nand only land, then open to settlement.  But the land was cheap,\r\nthe title clear, the soil good, and all were on the same footing,\r\nwilling to help each other.  The task before him was discouraging.\r\nHe found his quarter-section in the unbroken forest, its boundary\r\nblazed on the trees by the surveyor, and all around him a wilderness.\r\nHis first work was to erect a rough cabin of logs for a shelter;\r\nhis next to clear an opening for a crop.  Every new settler was a\r\nwelcome neighbor, though miles away.  The mail, the newspaper, the\r\ndoctor and the preacher were long in coming.  In this solitary\r\ncontest with nature the settler had often to rely upon his gun for\r\nfood, upon simple remedies for new and strange diseases, and upon\r\nthe hope that his crop would be spared from destruction by wild\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nThis was the life of the early settler in every county in Ohio, as\r\neach in its turn was organized and opened to settlement.  A life\r\nso hard, was yet so attractive that many pioneers, when a few\r\nneighbors gathered around them, preferred to sell their clearings\r\nand push further into the wilderness.  In the meantime the older\r\nsettlements attracted newcomers.  Mechanics and tradesmen came\r\nalong them.  Then towns sprang up, and incipient cities, with corner\r\nlots and hopeful speculators, tempted eastern capitalists to invest\r\ntheir money in Ohio.\r\n\r\nOhio, in these early days, was the only outlet of the population\r\nof the northern and middle states.  Emigrants from the south,\r\nfollowing lines of latitude, went into Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\nThe great west, with its vast prairies and plains, was not then\r\naccessible.  Had it been so, the forests of Ohio might have been\r\nleft in solitude for many years to come.  During all this period,\r\nwhich we may properly call the pioneer stage, the settlers had no\r\nmarket for their produce, except to supply the demand of incoming\r\nimmigrants.  Grain and fruit would not bear the expense of\r\ntransportation.  The only way to obtain ready money was to convert\r\ncorn and grain into hogs, horses and cattle, which were driven on\r\nthe hoof to Pittsburg and eastern cities.  But little money\r\ncirculated, and that was chiefly irredeemable bank notes.  The\r\nclothing of the people was mainly of linsey-woolsey, home-made.\r\nThe spinning wheel, big and little, was to be found in every\r\nhousehold.  Settlers near the banks of the Ohio River, and its\r\ntributaries, had the advantage of floating their surplus products\r\nin rough barges down the Ohio to New Orleans for a market, so that\r\nthe southern part of the state advanced rapidly, while the northern\r\npart was still in the possession of the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian title was extinguished settlers came from Pennsylvania\r\ninto the counties immediately west of it, which are still, in the\r\nhabits of the people, in the location of houses and barns and the\r\ncultivation of the soil, the precise counterpart of the region from\r\nwhich the settlers came.  The \"Connecticut Reserve\" was slowly\r\nfilled by the northern route of the lakes, almost exclusively from\r\nNew England, and the habits and customs of that region were\r\ntransported to their new homes, so that the \"Western Reserve\" to-\r\nday is a striking type of old Connecticut in habits, and with the\r\nsame ideas.  The lakes became the highway of commerce, and the\r\ninhabitants of the interior carried their surplus grain and produce\r\nin long lines of wagons to the new towns along the lake shore,\r\nwhere it was exchanged for the necessaries of life and enough money\r\nto pay taxes.  All trade in the interior was by barter with merchants,\r\nwho became the bankers of the people.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Erie Canal, and the introduction of steamboats\r\non the rivers and lakes, was the beginning of a great revolution.\r\nThen followed in Ohio the era of internal improvement by the\r\nconstruction of two lines of canal across the state, one from\r\nCleveland, on Lake Erie, to Portsmouth, on the Ohio River, and the\r\nother from Toledo, on Maumee Bay, to the city of Cincinnati, with\r\nthe lateral canal to Pittsburg, and the improvement of the Muskingum\r\nRiver by locks and canals.\r\n\r\nSalmon P. Chase, then a young attorney at Cincinnati, in his\r\nintroduction to his compilation of the laws of the state, published\r\nin 1833, thus describes the effect of these improvements upon the\r\nprosperity of Ohio:\r\n\r\n\"They have afforded to the farmer of the interior an easy access\r\nto market, and have enhanced the value of his farm and his productions.\r\nThey have facilitated intercourse between different sections of\r\nthe state, and have thus tended to make the people more united, as\r\nwell as more prosperous.  They have furnished to the people a common\r\nobject of generous interest and satisfaction.  They have attracted\r\na large accession of population and capital.  And they have made\r\nthe name and character of Ohio well-known throughout the civilized\r\nworld, as a name and character of which her sons may be justly\r\nproud.\"\r\n\r\nThis period of prosperity continued for twenty years, when, in\r\n1846, a still greater revolution was introduced by the building of\r\nrailroads.  The first object of this was to furnish cheaper\r\ntransportation of the produce of the farmer to the Ohio River and\r\nLake Erie.  The first railroads were from the interior, north and\r\nsouth.  They were little better than tramways, supported by cross-\r\nties with longitudinal stringpieces covered with thin strips of\r\niron.  The carriages were propelled by feeble engines, and it was\r\nthought a matter of great importance when, by this new motive power,\r\na bushel of wheat could be transported from the interior to distances\r\nof from fifty to a hundred miles for from six to ten cents.  While\r\na young attorney, I thought it a grievous injustice that my client,\r\none of the new railroad companies, was compelled by a jury to pay\r\n$2,000 for the right-of-way over twenty miles of farm land.  It\r\nwas soon discovered that railroads were to be so successful that\r\nthey would supersede for the transportation of persons and passengers\r\nall kinds of water transportation, and that lines running long\r\ndistances east and west would have the benefit of the through travel\r\nand traffic.  In rapid succession several lines of railroad were\r\nbuilt from the eastern cities across the state to the northwest,\r\nwest and southwest.  Within twenty years from the first construction\r\nof railways they had almost superseded all former modes of\r\ncommunication, and had reduced the rates of travel and transportation\r\nto less than one-half the former rates.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Civil War the construction of railroads\r\nrapidly increased, so that in 1890 the total miles of railway track\r\nin Ohio was 10,464, and the valuation for taxes was $102,950,642,\r\na development in a single branch of industry far greater than in\r\nany other.  This improvement led to the adoption of a system of\r\nfree turnpikes in most of the counties in Ohio, constructed by\r\nlocal taxation, so that now Ohio is as well supplied with well-\r\nconstructed turnpikes and railroads as any state in the Union, and\r\nperhaps, as well as many European states.\r\n\r\nAnother great change in the industry of the people of Ohio rapidly\r\nfollowed the construction of railroads.  Manufacturing establishments\r\nof almost every kind were rapidly constructed, mostly since the war.\r\n\r\nIt appears by census, prior to 1890, that in 1850 the total value\r\nof manufactures of Ohio was $62,692,279; in 1860 it was $121,000,000;\r\nin 1870 it was $269,713,610; in 1880 it was $348,298,300.  In 1890\r\nit was over $500,000,000.  During the single year 1889 there were\r\nincorporated over 400 new companies with a capital stock of\r\n$25,584,500.  Almost every article needed for use by the people is\r\nthus produced at home, and great quantities of machinery, especially\r\nof farming machines of every variety, are exported to every state\r\nof the Union and to many foreign countries.  The manufacturing\r\nindustry has thus become second only to that of agriculture, and\r\nit is believed that, under the great impetus given by our protective\r\nlaws, the time is not far distant when the value of manufactured\r\nproducts will be equal to, or greater than, the productions of the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nThe most striking result of the change in the industries of Ohio\r\nis the rapid increase of city population, compared with farming\r\npopulation.  The following table will show the population of twenty\r\ncities, by the censuses of 1850 and 1890:\r\n\r\n                       1850.      1890.\r\n  Akron . . . . . . .   3,266     27,601\r\n  Canton . . . . . .    2,603     26,189\r\n  Chillicothe . . . .   7,100     11,288\r\n  Cincinnati . . . .  115,435    296,908\r\n  Columbus  . . . . .  17,882     88,150\r\n  Cleveland  . . . .   17,034    261,353\r\n  Dayton  . . . . . .  10,977     61,220\r\n  Findlay  . . . . .    1,256     18,553\r\n  Hamilton  . . . . .   3,210     17,565\r\n  Ironton  . . . . .    ----      10,939\r\n  Lima  . . . . . . .     757     15,987\r\n  Mansfield  . . . .    3,557     13,473\r\n  Newark  . . . . . .   3,654     15,286\r\n  Portsmouth . . . .    4,011     12,394\r\n  Sandusky  . . . . .   5,087     18,471\r\n  Springfield  . . .    5,108     31,895\r\n  Steubenville  . . .   6,140     13,394\r\n  Tiffin . . . . . .    2,718     10,801\r\n  Toledo  . . . . . .   3,829     81,434\r\n  Zanesville . . . .    7,929     21,009\r\n                      221,553  1,053,910\r\n\r\nWhile the aggregate population of Ohio has increased 185 per cent.\r\nsince 1850, that of the cities named has increased 475 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe growth of cities and manufactures has been accompanied by the\r\ndiscovery and development of a diversity of mineral resources of\r\ngreat and increasing value.\r\n\r\nThe mining of coal was insignificant in 1850, while the product of\r\ncoal in 1890 is estimated at exceeding 12,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nRecently petroleum was discovered near Marietta and Lima, places\r\nin Ohio remote from each other, thus supplying a new element for\r\ncommerce and a new agent for manufactures.  Its properties and\r\ninnumerable uses have already been tested in Pennsylvania.  The\r\nannual supply by the census of 1890 was 12,471,466 barrels, second\r\nonly to that of Pennsylvania, and has not yet reached its maximum.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period came the discovery of natural gas at Findlay,\r\nin Hancock and surrounding counties.  This subtle and mysterious\r\ncreation of nature has been applied locally as fuel for manufacture,\r\nand as light and heat in many cities and towns.  The duration of\r\nits supply, however, cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nThe lakes on the north and the river on the south secure to the\r\npeople of Ohio cheap water transportation for the importation and\r\nexportation of raw materials and finished products, while the\r\nphysical features of the country north and south of Ohio, in a\r\nmeasure, compelled the construction of the great routes of railway\r\nover its soil.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Ohio has taken a leading part in furnishing\r\nfacilities for education to the rising generation.  In early days,\r\nwhen the population was sparse and scattered, day schools were\r\nestablished, by voluntary effort, in counties, towns and neighborhoods\r\nwhere the population was sufficient to justify it.  At an early\r\nperiod the State of Ohio established the common-school system, by\r\nwhich every child between the ages of seven and fourteen years is\r\nfurnished with the rudiments of a good education.  Some of these\r\nschools have been so far advanced that in them any child showing\r\nproficiency can secure, without cost, an education fully equal to\r\nthat furnished by the colleges of the country forty years ago.\r\nThe amount expended in 1890 for the support of public schools was\r\n$11,407,499.  The number of teachers employed was 19,526.  The number\r\nof persons enrolled between the ages of six and twenty-one was\r\n1,123,985.  The number of scholars who attended was 797,439.  The\r\naverage attendance was 549,269.  The excellence of the system of\r\ncommon schools in Ohio is admitted on all hands to be equal to that\r\nof any other state or section.\r\n\r\nThe charitable institutions of the state, including children's\r\nhomes, are equal to the best in any country in the world.\r\n\r\nThe building of churches and places of public worship commenced\r\nwith the first settlement in Ohio, and has kept pace fully with\r\nthe growth of population.  In every community, great or small,\r\nchurches are open for the worship of the Almighty God.  The broadest\r\ntoleration is not only permitted, but favored, by a universal public\r\nsentiment.  Every denomination of Christians who number enough to\r\nmake a congregation can readily secure a house of worship, not only\r\nby gifts from its members, but by contributions made by other\r\nprofessing Christians.  The same charity is extended to Jews and\r\nGentiles professing any creed or having any form of worship.\r\n\r\nThe standing, ability and influence of the men engaged in the\r\nprofessions in Ohio will compare favorably with any in the Union,\r\nand especially is this true of the lawyers of the state.  Many of\r\nthe lawyers who engaged in the fervent discussion which led to the\r\nRevolution and then participated in the war, thrown upon their own\r\nresources after the war, were among the early founders of the new\r\nsettlements in Ohio.  They chiefly framed the first laws of the\r\nstate.  Judge Burnet, one of them, had intrusted to him the\r\npreparation of most of the laws of the territorial government.\r\nThe principal lawyers appeared in the constitutional convention\r\nand in the legislatures subsequent, and contributed more than their\r\nshare in ingrafting upon our statutes the republican principles\r\nand ideas found in the first constitution and laws of the state.\r\nThey shared with other settlers in all the hardships of pioneer\r\nlife.  Innumerable anecdotes of their voyages through the forests\r\nof southern and eastern Ohio, and the swamps of northwestern Ohio,\r\nare preserved among the traditions of the bar.\r\n\r\nIt was the habit in those early days for the principal lawyers of\r\nthe state to follow the judges in their rounds from county to\r\ncounty, attending the courts and aiding local attorneys in the\r\ntrial of important causes.  They rode on horseback, with their\r\nclothing and books in their saddlebags, and, where a better lodging\r\ncould not be found, camped in the woods by the roadside.  The early\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, some of whom were transferred to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, rode in the same manner on\r\ntheir circuit, administering justice impartially, but firmly, for\r\nthe salary of $1,000 a year, only raised to $100 a month about the\r\nyear 1820.  The doctors and preachers shared the general life and\r\ncondition and the same homely fare as their patients and hearers.\r\n\r\nA life like this developed individual character and produced many\r\nmen of odd characteristics, strange manners and peculiar dress and\r\nconversation.  The almost universal use of whisky during the pioneer\r\nperiod in the family circle and in social life, and the habit of\r\ntreating and drinking, led to many wild scenes and fights, but,\r\nunlike their brethren of the south, the contestants commonly were\r\ncontent with the weapons nature gave them.  It was not unusual,\r\nwhen a quarrel arose, to gather around them, form a circle and give\r\nthem fair play and a free fight.  There can be no doubt that in\r\nthose early days many rude scenes and fights and violence of many\r\nkinds occurred, and such crimes were indulged with more charity\r\nthan now prevails.  But it is equally true that thefts and the\r\nmeaner crimes were more rare than now, and when disclosed were\r\npunished with greater severity than acts of violence.  The stealing\r\nof a horse was considered a greater crime than manslaughter without\r\nmalice or premeditation.\r\n\r\nBut all these habits and ideas have been greatly changed for at\r\nleast fifty years.  The habit of drinking spirituous liquor at the\r\nhomestead, in the family circle, or on the farm, has almost entirely\r\nceased.  As a rule, it is confined to saloons and bar-rooms, mostly\r\nin the cities and large towns, and a \"free fight\" in the presence\r\nof spectators could not now occur in any community in the state.\r\nThe enforcement of the criminal laws is as certain as in any other\r\ncommunity.  The discipline of penitentiaries and reformatories and\r\nhouses of correction is founded upon the best examples of such\r\ninstitutions in the older states, and the most civilized countries\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is one other quality developed by the people of Ohio which\r\nwill be readily conceded by all.  The people from the earliest days\r\nwere born politicians, vigorous in the defense of their opinions\r\nand firm in the maintenance of all their rights.  The events in\r\ntheir history developed a military instinct which led them to take\r\nan active part whenever their country became involved in war.  In\r\nthe pioneer age nearly every able-bodied man served either in the\r\nIndian wars or in the War of 1812.  In the Mexican war the State\r\nof Ohio furnished her full quota of soldiers, and tendered thousands\r\nmore.  In the political contests that preceded the Civil War the\r\nlines between the two parties were sharply drawn, though when war\r\nwas commenced by the firing upon Fort Sumter the people were\r\npractically united for its prosecution until the Union was restored\r\nby the unconditional surrender of the Confederate armies.  Questions\r\narose involving individual rights upon which the Democratic party\r\nwas divided, but it is due to history to say that in the great\r\nstruggle for national life the people of Ohio, without distinction\r\nof party, with few individual exceptions, were on the side of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe share taken by the several states in the Civil War is familiar\r\nto all.  Invidious comparisons ought not to be made.  It will be\r\nconceded that Ohio did its full part in this supreme contest.  She\r\nfurnished to the Union army 319,659 soldiers, or more than one-\r\ntenth of the national armies, out of a then population of 2,339,000,\r\nsome of whom served in every considerable battle of the war.  She\r\nfurnished from among her sons the leading commanders of the Union\r\narmy, and a long list of distinguished officers who were conspicuous\r\nin every battle of the war.  The war Governors of Ohio were\r\nconspicuous in their zeal and ability in organizing recruits, and\r\nin care and attention to their comfort and wants.  The people of\r\nOhio, both men and women, contributed freely in many ways for the\r\nrelief of the sick and wounded during the war, and after its close\r\nprovided homes for needy soldiers, and for the children of those\r\nwho fell.\r\n\r\nI have carefully refrained from mentioning the names of the many\r\nillustrious citizens of Ohio who contributed most to the organization,\r\ngrowth and development of that state and of the United States, lest\r\nI omit others equally worthy of honorable mention.  The Governors\r\nof Ohio have been selected for conspicuous service to the state,\r\nor to the United States, and, though the powers of that officer,\r\nunder the constitution of Ohio, are not so great as in many of the\r\nstates, they were distinguished for ability, integrity and high\r\npersonal character.  The roll of statesmen who have served Ohio in\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States includes\r\nmany of commanding influence in the national councils, two of whom\r\nhave been Presidents of the United States, two Chief Justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and many others have occupied\r\nseats as Justices of the Supreme Court, as heads of departments of\r\nthe executive branch of government, and representatives of the\r\nhighest rank in our diplomatic service.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to make a comparison of the merits of individuals\r\nor parties, nor of Ohio with other states, old or new.  I concede\r\nthat all the states, old or new, have contributed to the strength\r\nof the republic, the common hope and pride of all American citizens.\r\nLocal or state pride is entirely consistent with the most devoted\r\nloyalty to the Union.  All I have sought is to present truthfully\r\na mere outline of the history and resources of a state carved within\r\na century out of a wilderness, having at the beginning no inhabitants\r\nbut savage men and wild beasts, no mark of civilization except that\r\nmade by an extinct race leaving no name or date or history, and\r\nnow converted into the peaceful home of four millions of human\r\nbeings, possessed of a full share of property and wealth, a soil\r\nrich and fertile, well cultivated by independent farmers, yielding\r\nmore than the entire production of all the colonies that rebelled\r\nagainst Great Britain, and producing by varied industries and\r\ndeveloped resources more than all the states produced when the\r\nconstitution was adopted.\r\n\r\nIn intelligence, means of education, temperance, order and religious\r\nobservance, Ohio may fairly take its place among the most favored\r\ncommunities in the world.  It is a type of what can be accomplished\r\nunder favorable circumstances by a free people under a free\r\ngovernment, where each citizen enjoys the full and undisputed\r\npossession of equal rights and opportunities.  Ohio commenced its\r\nexistence on the western border line of civilization on the continent.\r\nThe center of population has already passed its borders, so that\r\nit now takes its place, not in the west, but in the east.  The new\r\ncommunities that have been founded in the west are largely composed\r\nof the sons and daughters of Ohio, who, following the example of\r\ntheir ancestors, seek new fields for enterprise and industry.  I\r\nhave observed that whenever I traveled in the west, however remote\r\nthe place, I found the \"Ohio man\" well advanced among his fellow\r\ncitizens, and actively contributing his full share to the growth\r\nand prosperity of the community in which he lived, but retaining\r\nhis love for his native state, and always proud to say he was born\r\nin Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nADMISSION TO THE BAR AND EARLY POLITICAL LIFE.\r\nLaw Partnership with my Brother Charles--Change in Methods of Court\r\nPractice--Obtaining the Right of Way for a Railroad--Excitement of\r\nthe Mexican War and its Effect on the Country--My First Visit to\r\nWashington--At a Banquet with Daniel Webster--New York Fifty Years\r\nAgo--Marriage with Margaret Cecilia Stewart--Beginning of My\r\nPolitical Life--Belief in the Doctrine of Protection--Democratic\r\nand Whig Conventions of 1852--The Slavery Question--My Election to\r\nCongress in 1854.\r\n\r\nAfter I was admitted to the bar I felt the natural elation of one\r\nwho had reached the end of a long journey after weary waiting.  I\r\nspent two or three weeks in visiting my relatives in Dayton and\r\nCincinnati, attending the courts in those cities, where I observed\r\nclosely the conduct of judges and lawyers in the trial of cases,\r\nand returned to Mansfield full of confidence, and with a better\r\nopinion of myself than I have entertained since.\r\n\r\nThe first object I sought to accomplish was the removal of my mother\r\nand her two unmarried daughters, Susan and Fannie, from Lancaster\r\nto Mansfield.  At this time all her sons were settled at homes\r\ndistant from Lancaster, and her other daughters were married and\r\nscattered.  By an arrangement between my brothers, Charles and\r\nTecumseh, and myself, I was to keep house with mother in charge,\r\nSusan and Fannie as guests.  This family arrangement was continued\r\nuntil Susan and I were married and mother died.\r\n\r\nTo return to my admission to the bar.  I felt that I was now a man.\r\nI had heretofore banked mainly on the treasures of hope.  My brother,\r\nCharles Sherman, admitted me as an equal partner in his lucrative\r\npractice, and thus I gained a foot-hold in the profession.\r\nFortunately for me, his timidity required me to attend stoutly\r\ncontested cases brought to us.  The old distinction between law\r\nand equity proceedings was then preserved, and Charles was a very\r\ngood equity counselor.  With this line of distinction between us\r\nwe never had any difficulty in arranging our business, or in dividing\r\nour labor.  He was then agent and attorney for New York and eastern\r\ncreditors, the confidential adviser of our leading business men,\r\nand the counselor of a very interesting sect, then quite numerous\r\nin Richland county, called Quakers, or Friends, who could not\r\nconscientiously take the usual oath, but in witnessing all necessary\r\nlegal papers, and in contests, made their affirmations.  There was,\r\ntherefore, left to me the pleadings, oral or written, and the\r\nstruggle of debate and trial.  The practice of the bar in Ohio had\r\ngreatly changed from that of the early decades of this century.\r\nAs I have stated, the judges, in the earlier decades, accompanied\r\nby leading lawyers, mounted on horses, went from county to county\r\nand disposed of the docket.  The local lawyers had but little to\r\ndo.  Now all this is changed.  Each county has its bar and its\r\nleading lawyers, and only when the case is of great importance a\r\n\"foreign\" lawyer is called in.  The change has been caused by the\r\nabnormal growth of population.  In 1830 the total population of\r\nthe state was only 938,000, that of many of the counties being very\r\nsmall.  In 1850 the population had more than doubled, amounting to\r\n1,980,000.  In 1890 it was 3,672,000, well distributed among the\r\ncounties according to their capacity for supporting this increase.\r\n\r\nOther remarkable changes have also taken place during the same\r\nperiod.  The entire mode of conducting business in early days has\r\nbeen abandoned.  Cash payments and short accounts have taken the\r\nplace of barter and credit.  The Ohio banking law of 1846, followed\r\nand superseded by the national banking act of 1863, produced a\r\nradical change in the forms, credit and solvency of paper money,\r\nand, more than any other cause, has encouraged the holding of small\r\nsavings of money in savings banks and like institutions.  These\r\nfavorable conditions tended to limit credits, to encourage savings,\r\nand to change the vocation and habits of lawyers.\r\n\r\nChanges in methods have also affected the legal profession.  The\r\nadoption of a code of laws, and of new and simple pleadings, rendered\r\nuseless half the learning of the old lawyers, driving some of them\r\nout of practice.  I knew one in Mansfield who swore that the new\r\ncode was made by fools, for fools, and that he never would resort\r\nto it.  I believe he kept his word, except when in person he was\r\nplaintiff or defendant.  Yet, the code and pleadings adopted in\r\nNew York have been adopted in nearly all the states, and will not\r\nbe changed except in the line of extension and improvement.\r\n\r\nThese reforms, and the many changes made in the organization of\r\nour state and federal courts, have to a considerable extent lessened\r\nthe fees and restricted the occupation of lawyers.  But it can be\r\nsaid that the leading members of the legal profession proposed and\r\nadopted these reforms, and always advocated any legislation that\r\ntended to simplify and cheapen litigation and at the same time\r\nprotect life, property or reputation.\r\n\r\nWhile these causes were operating against lawyers, agents of nature,\r\nhitherto unknown, undiscovered, and wonderful, were being developed,\r\nwhich were to completely revolutionize the methods of travel, the\r\ntransportation of goods, and the modes of production, thus opening\r\nnew fields for the employment of lawyers.  Instead of assault and\r\nbattery cases, suits for slander and the collection of debts, the\r\nattention of lawyers was directed to the development of railroads,\r\nbanking institutions and other corporations.\r\n\r\nThe construction of railroads caused a most remarkable revolution\r\nin the habits and industries of our people.  The first built in\r\nOhio ran from Lake Erie or the Ohio River, north or south into the\r\ncenter of the state.  Among them was the Sandusky & Mansfield road,\r\noriginally a short line from Sandusky to Monroeville, intended to\r\nbe run by horse power.  It was soon changed to a steam road, the\r\npower being furnished by a feeble, wheezing engine, not to be\r\ncompared with the locomotive of to-day.  It was then extended to\r\nMansfield, and subsequently to Newark, but was not completed until\r\n1846.  It was built of cross-ties three feet apart, connected by\r\nstring pieces of timber about six by eight inches in dimensions,\r\nand a flat iron bar two and one-half inches wide and five-eighths\r\nof an inch thick.  The worthlessness and danger of such a railroad\r\nwas soon demonstrated by innumerable accidents caused by the spreading\r\nof rails, the \"snaking\" of the flat bars of iron through the cars,\r\nand the feebleness of the engines.  Both road and engines soon had\r\nto be replaced.  In every case which I recall the original investment\r\nin the early railroads was lost.\r\n\r\nIt was thought when the first railroad from Sandusky to Mansfield\r\nwas completed that the road would save the farmer five or six cents\r\na bushel on his wheat in its transit to the lake, and yield a\r\nhandsome profit to the stockholders of the railroad.  That was the\r\ngreat benefit anticipated.  No one then thought of the movement by\r\nrailroad, over vast distances, of grain, stock, and merchandise,\r\nbut regarded the innovation as a substitute for the old wagon trains\r\nto the lake.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this railroad was considered at that time a\r\ngreat undertaking.  It was accomplished mainly by the leading\r\nbusiness men of Mansfield, but the road turned out to be a very\r\nbad investment, bankrupting some and crippling others.  I was\r\nemployed by the company to collect the stock and to secure by\r\ncondemnation the right-of-way from Plymouth to Mansfield.  Much of\r\nthe right-of-way was freely granted without cost by the owners of\r\nthe land.  As the chief benefit was to inure to the farmers, it\r\nwas thought to be very mean and stingy for one of them to demand\r\nmoney for the right-of-way through his farm.  I went over the road\r\nfrom Mansfield to Plymouth with a company of five appraisers, all\r\nfarmers, who carefully examined the line of the railroad, and much\r\nto my mortification, assessed in the aggregate for twenty miles of\r\nrailway track, damages to the amount of $2,000.  I honestly thought\r\nthis an exorbitant award, but the same distance could not be\r\ntraversed now at a cost for right-of-way of ten times that sum.\r\n\r\nThe present admirable roads in Ohio have been built mainly by the\r\nproceeds of bonds based upon a right-of-way.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime other railroads of much greater importance were\r\nbeing built, and the direction of the roads, instead of being north\r\nand south was from east to west, to reach a business rapidly\r\ndeveloping west of Ohio of far greater importance than the local\r\ntraffic of that state.\r\n\r\nAmong the most valuable of these railroads was the Pittsburg, Ft.\r\nWayne & Chicago, now a part of the system of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company, by which it is leased.  This road was built in\r\nsections by three different corporations, subsequently combined by\r\nauthority of the legislatures of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois.  The first section was the Pittsburg & Ohio railroad from\r\nPittsburg to Crestline, twelve miles west of Mansfield.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more remarkable material development in the\r\nhistory of mankind than that of railroads in the United States\r\nsince 1845.  The number of miles of such roads is now 171,804.72,\r\nthe actual cost of which with equipment amounting to $9,293,052,143.\r\nThe value of these railroads and their dependent warehouses and\r\nstations is probably greater to-day than the value of the entire\r\nproperty of the United States in 1840.\r\n\r\nContemporaneous with railroads came the telegraph, the cable, and\r\nthe telephone.  The first telegraph wire was strung between Baltimore\r\nand Washington in 1844.  The first telegraph line through the State\r\nof Ohio was from Cleveland via Mansfield to Columbus and Cincinnati,\r\nand was established in 1848.  At the close of the session of the\r\nSupreme Court at Mansfield in that year, Judge Hitchcock, who\r\npresided, asked me the road to Mt. Gilead, in Morrow county, a\r\ncounty then recently created.  I pointed to the telegraph wire\r\nstretched on poles, and told him to follow that.  The old Judge,\r\nwho had been on the supreme bench for over twenty years was quite\r\namused at the directions given.  He laughed and said he had been\r\nmislead by guideboards all his life, and now he was glad to be\r\nguided by a wire.\r\n\r\nThe development and changes, soon after my admission to the bar,\r\nturned somewhat the tide of my hopes and expectations.  Our firm\r\nsoon lost the business of collecting debts for eastern merchants\r\nby the establishment of numerous and safe banks under the state\r\nact of 1846.  Several of the old banks, especially those at Wooster,\r\nNorwalk, and Massillon had utterly failed, and, I believe, paid no\r\npart of their outstanding notes.  The new banks, founded upon a\r\nbetter system, one of which was at Mansfield, rapidly absorbed the\r\ncollections of eastern merchants from the part of Ohio in which we\r\nlived.  This loss was, however, more than made good by our employment\r\nas attorneys for the several railroads through Richland county.\r\nMy brother gradually withdrew from his business in Mansfield, and\r\nbecame the general attorney for the Pittsburg, Ft. Wayne & Chicago\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I had taken a junior part in the trial of several\r\ncases in which I was greatly favored by Mr. Stewart, the most\r\neminent member of his profession at Mansfield.  He gave me several\r\nopportunities for testing my qualities before a jury, so that I\r\ngradually gained confidence in myself as a speaker.\r\n\r\nMy Uncle Parker was then judge of the Court of Common Pleas.  So\r\nfar from favoring me on account of my relation to him, he seemed\r\nto wish to demonstrate his impartiality by overruling my pleadings\r\nor instructing the jury against me.  I am quite sure now that this\r\nwas fanciful on my part, for he was universally regarded as being\r\nan excellent example of a just judge without favor or partiality.\r\n\r\nDuring the early period of practice at the bar I studied my cases\r\ncarefully and had fair success.  I settled more cases by compromises,\r\nhowever, than I tried before a jury.  I got the reputation of being\r\nsuccessful by full preparation and a thorough knowledge of the\r\nfacts and law of the case.  In addressing a jury I rarely attempted\r\nflights of oratory, and when I did attempt them I failed.  I soon\r\nlearned that it was better to gain the confidence of a jury by\r\nplain talk than by rhetoric.  Subsequently in public life I preserved\r\na like course, and once, though I was advised by Governor Chase to\r\nadd a peroration to my argument, I did not follow his advice.\r\nWhile I defended many persons for alleged crimes I never but once\r\nprosecuted a criminal.  My old friend, Mr. Kirkwood, was the\r\nprosecuting attorney of the county, and I renewed with him my \"moot\r\ncourt\" experience in frequent contests between real parties.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I became a member of the order of Odd Fellows\r\nin Mansfield.  I took an active interest in the order, and was at\r\none time Noble Grand of the lodge.  I have continued every since\r\nto pay my dues, but have not been able to attend the meetings\r\nregularly for some years.  I have always thought, without any\r\nreference to its supposed secrecy, that it is an association of\r\ngreat value, especially in bringing young men under good social\r\ninfluences with men of respectable character and standing.\r\n\r\nAmong the political incidents of this period I recall the excitement\r\nthat grew out of the Mexican War.  The general feeling among all\r\nclasses, and the universal feeling among the Whigs was, that the\r\nMexican War was purposely and unjustly entered upon to extend the\r\ninstitution of slavery.  There is, now, no doubt that such was the\r\nobject of the war.  After the battles at Palo Alto and Resaca de\r\nla Palma a call was made upon the people of Ohio for two regiments\r\nof volunteers.  These were raised without much difficulty, one\r\nbeing placed under the command of Col. Thomas L. Hamer, the other\r\nunder my old commander, Col. Samuel R. Curtis.  I was somewhat\r\ntempted to enter the service, though I did not believe in the\r\njustice of the war.  My old friend, Gen. McLaughlin, raised a\r\ncompany in Mansfield, and my comrade on the Muskingum Improvement,\r\nJames M. Love, raised one in Coschocton, and Col. Curtis was to\r\ncommand the regiment.  My brother, William Tecumseh, then captain\r\nin the regular army, was eager to go into the war.  He had been\r\nstationed at Pittsburg, on recruiting service, but during the\r\nexcitement visited us at Mansfield, and chafed over the delay of\r\norders to join the troops, then under General Taylor.  No doubt\r\nhis impatience led him to be assigned to the expedition around Cape\r\nHorn to occupy California, this, greatly to his regret, keeping\r\nhim out of the war with Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the merits of this war in the beginning,\r\nits fruits were undoubtedly of immense value to this country.\r\nWithout this war California might, like other provinces of Mexico,\r\nhave remained undeveloped.  In the possession of the United States\r\nits gold and silver have been discovered and mined, and, together\r\nwith all the vast interior country west of the Mississippi, it has\r\nbeen developed with a rapidity unexampled in history.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1846-7, I for the first time visited the cities\r\nof Washington, New York and Boston.  I rode in a stage coach from\r\nMansfield to the national road south of Newark, and thence over\r\nthat road by stages to Cumberland, the railroads not having yet\r\ncrossed the mountains.  From Cumberland I rode in cars to Baltimore,\r\noccupying nearly a day.  From Baltimore I proceeded to Washington.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival I went to the National Hotel, then the most popular\r\nhotel in Washington, where many Senators and Members lodged.  I\r\nfound there, also, a number of charming young ladies whose company\r\nwas much more agreeable to me than that of the most distinguished\r\nstatesmen.  We had hops, balls and receptions, but I recall very\r\nfew public men I met at that time.  Mr. Vinton, then the veteran\r\nMember from Ohio, invited me to join for a few days his mess; he\r\nwas then boarding in a house nearly opposite the hotel, kept by an\r\nItalian whose name I cannot recall.  He was a famous cook.  The\r\nmess was composed entirely of Senators and Members, one of the\r\nformer being Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky.  I was delighted and\r\ninstructed by the free and easy talk that prevailed, a mixture of\r\nfunny jokes, well-told stories and gay and grave discussions of\r\npolitics and law.\r\n\r\nMy stay at the capital was brief as I wished to go to New York and\r\nBoston.  In New York I received from a relative a letter of\r\nintroduction to Benj. R. Curtis, then an eminent lawyer, and latterly\r\na more eminent justice of the Supreme Court.  When I presented my\r\nletter I was received very kindly and after a brief conversation\r\nhe said he was able to do me a favor, that he had a ticket to a\r\ngrand banquet to be attended by the leading men of Boston at Plymouth\r\nRock, on the anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers,\r\nand that Daniel Webster would preside.  I heartily thanked him,\r\nand on the next day, prompt on time, I entered the train at Boston\r\nfor Plymouth.  When I arrived at the hotel, which is also a station-\r\nhouse of the railway, I did not know a single person in the great\r\nassemblage.  In due time we were ushered into the dining hall where\r\nthe banquet was spread.  There was no mistaking Webster.  He sat\r\nat the center of a cross table with the British minister on his\r\nright and Jeremiah Mason on his left.  At the other end of the room\r\nsat Abbott Lawrence and other distinguished men.  The residue of\r\nthe guests, merchants, poets, and orators of Massachusetts, filled\r\nevery seat at the tables.  I sat some way down on the side and\r\nintroduced myself to my neighbors on the right and left, but my\r\neye was on Webster, from whom I expected such lofty eloquence as\r\nhe alone could utter.\r\n\r\nMuch to my surprise, when the time came for the oratory to commence,\r\nMr. Lawrence acted as toast master.  We had stories, songs, poetry\r\nand oratory, generally good and appropriate, but not from Webster.\r\nAnd so the evening waned.  Webster had been talking freely with\r\nthose about him.  He displayed none of the loftiness associated\r\nwith his name.  He drank freely.  That was manifest to everyone.\r\nHis favorite bottle was one labeled \"Brandy.\"  We heard of it as\r\nbeing \"more than a hundred years old.\"  It did not travel down to\r\nus.  Webster was plainly hilarious.  At this time the conductor\r\nappeared at a side door and announced that in fifteen minutes the\r\ncars would start for Boston.  Then Webster arose--with difficulty\r\n--he rested his hands firmly on the table and with an effort assumed\r\nan erect position.  Every voice was hushed.  He said that in fifteen\r\nminutes we would separate, nevermore to meet again, and then, with\r\nglowing force and eloquence, he contrasted the brevity and vanity\r\nof human life with the immortality of the events they were celebrating,\r\nwhich century after century would be celebrated by your children\r\nand your children's children to the latest generation.\r\n\r\nI cannot recall the words of his short but eloquent speech, but it\r\nmade an impress on my mind.  If his body was affected by the liquor,\r\nhis head was clear and his utterance perfect.  I met Mr. Webster\r\nafterwards on the cars and in Washington.  I admired him for his\r\ngreat intellectual qualities, but I do not wonder that the people\r\nof the United States did not choose him for President.\r\n\r\nSoon after the national Whig convention of 1852, of which I was a\r\nmember, I heard this story told by his secretary.  In the evening,\r\nwhen Mr. Webster was at his well-known residence on Louisiana\r\nAvenue, near Sixth street, he was awaiting the ballots in the\r\nconvention.  When it came by the telegraph, \"Scott 159, Fillmore\r\n112, Webster 21,\" he repeated it in his deep tones and said:  \"How\r\nwill this read in history?\"  He did not like either Scott or\r\nFillmore, and was disappointed in the votes of southern members.\r\nTo be third in such a contest wounded his pride.  He died before\r\nthe year closed.  He was, perhaps, the greatest man of intellectual\r\nforce of his time, but he had faults which the people could not\r\noverlook.  Another incident about Mr. Webster, and the house in\r\nwhich he lived, may not be without interest.  On New Year's day of\r\n1860, Mr. Corwin, Mr. Colfax and myself made the usual calls\r\ntogether.  Among the many visits we made, was one on a gentleman\r\nthen living in that house.  As we entered, Mr. Corwin met an old\r\nwell-trained negro servant who had been a servant of Mr. Webster\r\nin this house.  I noticed that Mr. Corwin lost his usual gayety,\r\nand as we left the house he turned to us, and, with deep emotion,\r\nasked that we leave him at his lodgings, that his long associations\r\nwith Mr. Webster, especially his meetings with him in that house\r\nduring their association as members of the cabinet of Fillmore,\r\nunfitted him to enjoy the usual greetings of the day.  I felt that\r\nthe emotion of such a man as Corwin was the highest possible\r\ncompliment to the memory of Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nFrom Boston I returned to New York.  There, in the families of two\r\nbrothers of my mother, both then living, I had a glimpse of New\r\nYork society.  With Mr. Scott, the son-in-law of my uncle, James\r\nHoyt, I made nearly one hundred of the usual New Years' visits, then\r\ncustomary in New York.  This custom I am told has been abandoned,\r\nbut the New York of to-day is quite different from the New York of\r\n1847.  It still retained some of the knickerbocker customs of the\r\nolden time.  The site of the Fifth Avenue Hotel was then a stone-\r\nyard where grave stones were cut.  All north of Twenty-third street,\r\nnow the seat of plutocracy, was then sparsely occupied by poor\r\nhouses and miserable shanties, and the site of Central Park was a\r\nrough, but picturesque body of woodland, glens and rocky hills,\r\nwith a few clearings partly cultivated.  Even then the population\r\nof New York was about 400,000, or more than three-fold that of any\r\ncity in the United States, and twenty-fold that of Chicago.  Now\r\nNew York contains 2,000,000 inhabitants, and Chicago, according to\r\nrecent reports, about 1,700,000.  Many cities now exist containing\r\nover 100,000 inhabitants, the sites of which, in that year, were\r\nwithin the limits of Indian reservations.\r\n\r\nFrom New York I returned to Washington.  Many incidents recur to\r\nme but they were of persons now dead and gone, the memory of whom\r\nwill not be recalled by the present generation.  Mr. Polk was then\r\nPresident.  He was a plain man, of ordinary ability and more\r\ndistinguished for the great events that happened during his presidency\r\nthan for anything he did himself.  I attended one of his receptions.\r\nHis wife appeared to better advantage than he.  I then saw Mr.\r\nDouglas for the first time.  I think he was still a Member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, but had attained a prominent position\r\nand was regarded as a rising man.  I wished very much to see Henry\r\nClay, the great favorite of the Whigs of that day, but he was not\r\nthen in public life.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in Washington at that time to excite interest,\r\nexcept the men and women in public or social life.  The city itself\r\nhad no attractions except the broad Potomac River and the rim of\r\nhills that surrounded the city.  It then contained about 30,000\r\ninhabitants.  Pennsylvania avenue was a broad, badly paved,\r\nunattractive street, while all the other streets were unpaved and\r\nunimproved.  All that part of the city lying north of K street and\r\nwest of Fourteenth street, now the most fashionable part of the\r\ncity, was then a dreary waste open, like all the rest of the city,\r\nas free pasturage for cows, pigs, and goats.  It was a city in\r\nname, but a village in fact.  The contrast between Washington then\r\nand now may be referred to hereafter.\r\n\r\nUpon my return from the east in February, 1847, I actively resumed\r\nthe practice of the law.  I was engaged in several important trials,\r\nbut notably one at Mount Vernon, Ohio, where the contesting parties\r\nwere brothers, the matter in dispute a valuable farm, and the chief\r\nwitness in the case the mother of both the plaintiff and defendant.\r\nIt was, as such trials are apt to be, vigorously contested with\r\ngreat bitterness between the parties.  Columbus Delano was the\r\nchief counsel for the plaintiff, and I was his assistant.  I remember\r\nthe case more especially because during its progress I was attacked\r\nby typhoid fever.  I returned home after the trial, completely\r\nexhausted, and on the Fourth of July, 1847, found myself in a raging\r\nfever, which continued more than two months before I was able to\r\nrise from the bed, and then I was as helpless as a child.  I was\r\nunable to walk, and was lifted from the house into the carriage to\r\nget the fresh air, and continued under disability until October,\r\nwhen I was again able to renew my business.\r\n\r\nDuring my practice thus far, I had been able to accumulate in\r\nproperty and money more than ten thousand dollars.  I had, in\r\naddition to my practice, engaged in a profitable business with\r\nJacob Emminger, a practical mechanic, in the manufacture of doors,\r\nblinds and other building materials.  We acquired valuable pine-\r\nlands in Michigan and transported the lumber to our works at\r\nMansfield.  We continued this business until I was appointed\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, in March, 1877, when I sold out my\r\ninterest and also abandoned the practice of the law.\r\n\r\nI spent the winter of 1847-8 at Columbus, where I made many\r\nacquaintances who were of great service to me in after life, and\r\nhad a happy time also with the young ladies I met there.  Columbus\r\nwas then the headquarters of social life for Ohio.  It had a\r\npopulation of about fifteen thousand, with few or no manufactures.\r\nIt has now a population of more than one hundred thousand, the\r\nincrease being largely caused by the great development of the\r\nnumerous railroads centering there, and of the coal and iron mines\r\nof the Hocking Valley.  It was also the natural headquarters of\r\nthe legal profession, the Supreme Court of Ohio, then under the\r\nold constitution, and the District Court of the United States\r\nholding their sessions there.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of August, 1848, my grandmother, Elizabeth Stoddard\r\nSherman, died at Mansfield at the residence of her daughter, Mrs.\r\nParker.  Her history and characteristics have already been referred\r\nto.  She was to our family the connecting link between the\r\nRevolutionary period and our times.  She had a vivid recollection\r\nof the burning of the principal towns of Connecticut by the British\r\nand Tories, of the trials and poverty that followed the War of the\r\nRevolution, of the early political contests between the Federalists\r\nand Republicans, of the events of the War of 1812, and of her\r\njourney to Ohio in 1816.  She maintained a masterly care of her\r\nchildren and grandchildren.  She was the best type I have known of\r\nthe strong-willed, religious Puritan of the Connecticut school,\r\nand was respected, not only by her numerous grandchildren, but by\r\nall who knew her.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, Thomas W. Bartley, was District Attorney of the\r\nUnited States during the administration of Mr. Polk, and, as he\r\nexpected a change would be made by the incoming administration of\r\nTaylor, he advised me to become a candidate for his place, as that\r\nwas in the line of my profession.  I told him I doubted if my\r\nexperience of the bar would justify me in making such an application,\r\nbut he thought differently.  I wrote to Mr. Ewing upon the subject\r\nand he answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., Dec. 31, 1848.\r\n\"John Sherman, Esq., Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I believe you would be able to perform the duties\r\nof District Attorney, but your youth would be an objection to your\r\nappointment, and in competition with one so long known, and so\r\nhighly esteemed, as Mr. Goddard is both professionally and politically,\r\nwould probably make your prospects but little encouraging.  If you\r\nconclude to withdraw your name, signify the fact and the reason by\r\nletter to Mr. Goddard and it may be of use to you hereafter.  I\r\nam, with great regard,\r\n\r\n  \"Yours, T. Ewing.\"\r\n\r\nI complied with his advice, though Mr. Goddard, I think, declined\r\nand Mr. Mason was accepted.\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of the same month I was married to Margaret\r\nCeclia Stewart, the only child of Judge Stewart, whom I had known\r\nsince my removal to Mansfield.  She had been carefully educated at\r\nthe Female College at Granville, Ohio, and at the Patapsco Institute,\r\nnear Baltimore, Maryland.  After the usual wedding tour to Niagara\r\nFalls, Montreal and Saratoga, we settled in Mansfield, and I returned\r\nto my profession, actively pursuing it until elected a member of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to follow my professional life into further\r\ndetail.  I shall not have occasion to mention that subject again.\r\nSufficient to say that I was reasonably successful therein.  During\r\nthis period Henry C. Hedges studied law with my brother and myself,\r\nand when admitted to the bar became my partner.  Mr. Stewart was\r\nelected by the legislature a judge of the Court of Common Pleas,\r\nand after the adoption of the new constitution of 1851, he was\r\nelected by the people to the same office.\r\n\r\nI had determined in the fall of 1853 to abandon Mansfield and settle\r\nin Cleveland, then rapidly growing in importance as the leading\r\ncity in the northern part of the state.  I went so far as to\r\nestablish an office there and place in it two young lawyers,\r\nnominally my partners, but the great political currents of that\r\ntime soon diverted me from the practice of the law into the political\r\ncontests that grew out of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\n  \"The direful spring of woes unnumbered.\"\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon an account of my political life it seems\r\nappropriate for me to state my political bias and position.  I was\r\nby inheritance and association a Whig boy, without much care for\r\nor knowledge of parties or political principles.  No doubt my\r\ndischarge from the engineer corps by a Democratic Board of Public\r\nWorks strengthened this bias.  I shouted for Harrison in the campaign\r\nof 1840.  In 1842 I was enthusiastic for \"Tom Corwin, the wagon-\r\nboy,\" the Whig candidate for Governor of Ohio.  In that canvass\r\nGovernor Corwin addressed a great meeting at Mansfield.  I heard\r\nhis speech, and was full of enthusiasm.  Mr. Corwin was certainly\r\nthe greatest popular orator of his time.  His face was eloquent,\r\nchangeable at his will.  With a look he could cause a laugh or a\r\ntear.  He would move his audience at his pleasure.  I vividly\r\nremember the impression he made upon me, though I cannot recall\r\nanything he said.  At the close of the meeting I was requested by\r\nthe committee in charge to take Mr. Corwin in a buggy to Bucyrus.\r\nThis I cheerfully did.  I noticed that Mr. Corwin was very glum\r\nand silent, and to cheer him up I spoke of his speech and of the\r\nmeeting.  He turned upon me, and with some show of feeling, said\r\nthat all the people who heard him would remember only his jokes,\r\nand warned me to keep out of politics and attend to my law.  He\r\ntold me that he knew my father, and was present at his death at\r\nLebanon, where he, Mr. Corwin, lived.  And then, brightening up,\r\nhe gave me an interesting account of the early settlement of Ohio,\r\nand of the bar and bench, and of his early life as a wagon boy in\r\nHarrison's army.  His sudden fit of gloom had passed away.  I do\r\nnot recall any circumstance that created a deeper impression on my\r\nmind than this interview with Mr. Corwin.  His advice to keep out\r\nof politics was easy to follow, as no one could then dream of the\r\npossibility of a Whig being elected to office in Richland county,\r\nthen called \"the Berks of Ohio.\"  Mr. Corwin was defeated at that\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nI took but little part in the campaign of 1844, when Mr. Clay was\r\na candidate for President, but I then made my first political speech\r\nto a popular audience and cast my first vote.  The meeting was held\r\nat Plymouth, and Honorable Joseph M. Root, the Whig candidate for\r\nCongress, was to be the orator.  For some reason Mr. Root was\r\ndelayed, and I was pressed into service.  Of what I said I have\r\nnot the remotest recollection, but my audience was satisfied, and\r\nI was doubly so, especially when Mr. Root came in sight.  After\r\nthat I made a few neighborhood speeches in support of the Whig\r\ncandidate for governor, Mr. Mordecai Partley, a gentleman who for\r\nseveral years had lived in Mansfield, but had long since retired\r\nfrom public office after eight years' service in the United States\r\nHouse of Representatives.  Mr. Bartley received 147,378 votes, Mr.\r\nTod, Democrat, 146,461 votes and Mr. King, Third Party, 8,411 votes;\r\nso close were parties divided in Ohio in 1844.\r\n\r\nAt this time I had but two definite ideas in respect to the public\r\npolicy of the United States.  One was a hearty belief in the doctrine\r\nof protection to American industries, as advocated by Mr. Clay,\r\nand, second, a strong prejudice against the Democratic party, which\r\nwas more or less committed to the annexation of Texas, and the\r\nextension of slavery.  I shared in the general regret at the defeat\r\nof Mr. Clay and the election of Mr. Polk.  I took some part in the\r\nlocal canvasses in Ohio prior to 1848, but this did not in the\r\nleast commit me to active political life.  I was appointed a delegate\r\nto the national Whig convention, held in Philadelphia, in 1848, to\r\nnominate a presidential candidate.  I accepted this the more readily\r\nas it gave me an opportunity to see my future wife at her school\r\nat Patapsco, and to fix our engagement for marriage upon her return\r\nhome.  The chief incident of the convention was the struggle between\r\nthe friends of General Scott and General Taylor.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention was being organized, Colonel Collyer, chairman\r\nof the Ohio delegation, said there was a young gentleman in that\r\nconvention who could never hope to get an office unless that\r\nconvention gave him one, and nominated me for secretary of the\r\nconvention.  Mr. Defrees said there was a delegate from Indiana in\r\nthe same condition and moved that Schuyler Colfax be made assistant\r\nsecretary.  We then marched together to the platform and commenced\r\nour political life, in which we were to be closely associated for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of General Taylor, cordially supported by me, was\r\nnot acceptable to all the Whigs of Ohio.  The hostility to slavery\r\nhad grown chiefly out of the acquisition of Texas as a slave state.\r\nAn anti-slavery party headed in Ohio by Salmon P. Chase cast 35,354\r\nvotes for Van Buren.  General Taylor was defeated in Ohio mainly\r\nby this defection, receiving 138,360 votes.  General Cass received\r\n154,755 votes.  General Cass received the vote of Ohio, but General\r\nTaylor was elected President, having received a majority of the\r\nelectoral vote.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor proved a very conscientious and acceptable President.\r\nHis death, on the ninth day of July, 1850, preceded the passage of\r\nthe compromise measures of Henry Clay, commonly known by his name.\r\nThey became laws with the approval of Millard Fillmore.\r\n\r\nIt was my habit during this period to attend the annual state\r\nconventions of the Whig party, not so much to influence nominations\r\nas to keep up an acquaintance with the principal members of the\r\nparty.  I had not the slightest desire for public office and never\r\nbecame a candidate until 1854.  In the state convention of 1850 I\r\nheartily supported the nomination of General Scott for President,\r\nat the approaching election of 1852.  In this convention an effort\r\nwas made to nominate me for Attorney-General in opposition to Henry\r\nStanbery.  I promptly declined to be a candidate, but received a\r\nnumber of votes from personal friends, who, as they said, wanted\r\nto introduce some young blood into the Whig party.\r\n\r\nI then began seriously to study the political topics of the day.\r\nI was classed as a conservative Whig, and heartily supported the\r\ncompromise measures of 1850, not upon their merits, but as the best\r\nsolution of dangerous sectional divisions.  Prior to this time I\r\ndo not remember to have given any study, except through the newspapers\r\nof the day, to the great national questions that divided the\r\npolitical parties.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1852 I was designated by the state convention as\r\na delegate at large in association with Honorable Samuel F. Vinton\r\nto the national Whig convention of that year.  I was an earnest\r\nadvocate of General Scott, and rejoiced in his nomination.  Here,\r\nagain, the slavery question was obtruded into national politics.\r\nThe clear and specific indorsement of the compromise measures,\r\nthough supported by a great majority, divided the Whig party and\r\nled to the election of Franklin Pierce.  In this canvass I took\r\nfor the first time an active part.  I was designated as an elector\r\non the Scott ticket.  I made speeches in several counties and\r\ncities, but was recalled to Wooster by a telegram stating that my\r\nmother was dangerously ill.  Before I could reach home she died.\r\nThis event was wholly unexpected, as she seemed, when I left home,\r\nto be in the best of health.  She had accompanied her daughter,\r\nMrs. Bartley, to Cleveland to attend the state fair, and there, no\r\ndoubt, she was attacked with the disease of which she died.  I took\r\nno further part in the canvass.\r\n\r\nI wish here to call special attention to the attitude of the two\r\ngreat parties in respect to the compromise measures.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic national convention at Baltimore was held in the\r\nfirst of June, 1852.  The resolutions of that convention in reference\r\nto slavery were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"12.  _Resolved_, That Congress has no power under the constitution\r\nto interfere with, or control, the domestic institutions of the\r\nseveral states, and that such states are the sole and proper judges\r\nof everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by\r\nthe constitution; that all efforts of the Abolitionists or others,\r\nmade to induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery, or\r\nto take incipient steps in relation thereto, are calculated to lead\r\nto the most alarming and dangerous consequences, and that all such\r\nefforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of\r\nthe people, and endanger the stability and permanency of the Union,\r\nand ought not to be countenanced by any friends of our political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\"13.  _Resolved_, That the foregoing proposition covers, and is\r\nintended to embrace, the whole subject of slavery agitation in\r\nCongress, and, therefore, _the Democratic party of the Union,\r\nstanding on this national platform, will abide by, and adhere to,\r\na faithful execution of the acts known as the compromise measures\r\nsettled by the last Congress, 'the act for reclaiming fugitives\r\nfrom service labor' included; which act, being designed to carry\r\nout an express provision of the constitution, cannot, with fidelity\r\nthereto, be repealed, nor so changed as to destroy or impair its\r\nefficiency_.\r\n\r\n\"14.  _Resolved, That the Democratic party will resist all attempts\r\nat renewing in Congress, or out of it, the agitation of the slavery\r\nquestion, under whatever shape or color the attempt may be made_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whig convention, which met at Baltimore on the 16th of June,\r\n1852, declared as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"8.  _That the series of acts of the 32nd Congress, the act known\r\nas The Fugitive Slave Law included, are received and acquiesced in\r\nby the Whig party of the United States as a settlement in principle\r\nand substance of the dangerous and exciting questions which they\r\nembrace, and so far as they are concerned, we will maintain them,\r\nand insist upon their strict enforcement_, until time and experience\r\nshall demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard\r\nagainst the evasion of the laws on the one hand, and the abuse of\r\ntheir powers on the other--not impairing their present efficiency;\r\nand we _deprecate all further agitation of the question thus settled\r\nas dangerous to our peace, and will discountenance all efforts to\r\ncontinue or renew such agitation whenever, wherever or however the\r\nattempt may be made_, and we will maintain the system as essential\r\nto the nationality of the Whig party and the integrity of the\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that these platforms do not essentialy differ\r\nfrom each other.  Both declare in favor of acquiescence in the\r\ncompromise measures of 1850.  The Democratic party more emphatically\r\ndenounces any renewal in Congress, or out of it, of the agitation\r\nof the slavery question under whatever name, shape or color, the\r\nattempt may be made.  The Whig platform, equally positive in its\r\nacquiescence in the settlement made, known as the compromise\r\nmeasures, declared its purpose to:  \"Maintain them, and to insist\r\nupon their strict enforcement until time and experience shall\r\ndemonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against\r\nthe evasion of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that under these platforms both parties were committed\r\nto acquiescence in existing laws upon the subject of slavery, and\r\nto a resistance of all measures to change or modify them.\r\n\r\nI took quite an active part in this canvass and wrote to Mr. Seward,\r\nthen the great leader of the Whig party, inviting him to attend a\r\nmass meeting in Richland county, to which I received the following\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n  \"Auburn, Sept. 20, 1852.\r\n\"John Sherman, Esq., Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I have the honor of receiving your letter urging me to\r\naccept the invitation of the Whig central committee to address a\r\nmass meeting in Richland county, Ohio, on the second of October.\r\nI appreciate fully the importance of the canvass in which we are\r\nengaged, and I have some conception of the responsibilities of the\r\nWhigs of Ohio.  I wish, therefore, that it was in my power to comply\r\nwith the wishes, expressed in several quarters, by going among them\r\nto attempt to encourage them in their noble and patriotic efforts,\r\nbut it is impossible.  Public and professional engagements have\r\nwithdrawn me from my private affairs during the past two years,\r\nand the few weeks of interval between the last and the next session\r\nof Congress are equally insufficient for the attention my business\r\nrequires and for the relaxation of public labors which impaired\r\nhealth demands.  I am, dear sir, with great respect, you friend\r\nand humble servant,\r\n\r\n  \"William H. Seward.\"\r\n\r\nThe election of 1852 resulted in the overwhelming defeat of General\r\nScott, and the practical annihilation of the Whig party.  Franklin\r\nPierce received 244 electoral votes, and General Scott but 42.\r\n\r\nThe triumphant election of Mr. Pierce, on the platform stated,\r\njustified the expectation that during his term there would be no\r\nopening of the slavery controversy by the Democratic party.  If\r\nthat party had been content with the compromise of 1850, and had\r\nfaithfully observed the pledges in its platform, there would have\r\nbeen no Civil War.  Conservative Whigs, north and south, would have\r\nunited with conservative Democrats in maintaining and enforcing\r\nexisting laws.  The efforts of the opponents of slavery and of\r\naggressive pro-slavery propagandists would have been alike ineffective.\r\nThe irrepressible conflict would have been indefinitely postponed.\r\nYet, as will appear hereafter, the leaders of the 33rd Congress of\r\nboth parties, and mainly on sectional lines, openly and flagrantly\r\nviolated the pledges of their party, and renewed a contest that\r\nwas only closed by the most destructive Civil War of modern times,\r\nand by the abolition of slavery.  As this legislation brought me\r\ninto public life, I wish to justify my statement by the public\r\nrecords, with all charity to the authors of the measures who no\r\ndoubt did not anticipate the baleful events that would spring from\r\nthem, nor the expanded and strengthened republic which was the\r\nfinal result.  \"Man proposes, but God disposes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the 33rd Congress met, on the 6th day of December, 1853, the\r\ntariff issue was practically in abeyance.  The net ordinary receipts\r\nof the government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1853, were\r\n$61,587,031.68.  The net ordinary expenditures of the government\r\nfor the same year were $47,743,989.09, leaving a surplus of revenue\r\nover expenditures of $13,843,042.59, of which, $6,833,072.65 was\r\napplied to the payment of the public debt, leaving in the treasury,\r\nunexpended, about $7,000,000.00.  The financial and political\r\ncondition of the United States was never more prosperous than when\r\nthis Congress met.  The disturbance of this condition can be\r\nattributed only to the passage of the act to organize the territories\r\nof Nebraska and Kansas approved by President Franklin Pierce, May\r\n30, 1854.  The 32nd section of that act contained this provision:--\r\n\r\n\"That the constitution and all laws of the United States which are\r\nlocally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within\r\nthe said Territory of Kansas as elsewhere within the United States,\r\nexcept the eighth section of the act preparatory to the admission\r\nof Missouri into the Union, approved March sixth, eighteen hundred\r\nand twenty, which, being inconsistent with the principle of non-\r\nintervention by Congress with slavery in the states and territories,\r\nas recognized by the legislation of eighteen hundred and fifty,\r\ncommonly called the compromise measures, is hereby declared\r\ninoperative and void; it being the true intent and meaning of this\r\nact not to legislate slavery into any territory or state, nor to\r\nexclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly\r\nfree to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own\r\nway, subject only to the constitution of the United States:\r\n_Provided_, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to\r\nrevive or put in force any law or regulation which may have existed\r\nprior to the act of March sixth, eighteen hundred and twenty, either\r\nprotecting, establishing, prohibiting or abolishing slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThis act contained a similar clause relating to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nTo understand the effect of this provision it is necessary to review\r\nthe status of slavery in the United States under the constitution\r\nand existing laws.\r\n\r\nThe articles of Confederation make no mention of slavery or slaves.\r\nDuring and after the Revolution the general feeling was that slavery\r\nwould be gradually abolished by the several states.  In the Ordinance\r\nof 1787 for the government of the territories of the United States,\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio River, it was expressly provided that:\r\n\r\n\"There shall be no slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said\r\nterritory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the\r\nparties shall have been duly convicted; provided, always, that any\r\nperson escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully\r\nclaimed in any of the original states, such fugitive may be lawfully\r\nreclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or\r\nservice as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision applied to all the territory of the United States\r\nthat was subject to the jurisdiction of the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the United States did not mention either slaves\r\nor slavery.  Its two provisions relating to the subject were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states\r\nnow existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited\r\nby the Congress prior to the year one thousand, eight hundred and\r\neight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not\r\nexceeding ten dollars for each person. . . .\r\n\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but\r\nshall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service\r\nor labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nThe first clause quoted was intended to enable Congress to prohibit\r\nthe introduction of slaves after the year 1808, and this was promptly\r\ndone.  The second provision was intended to authorize the recapture\r\nof slaves escaping from their owners to another state.  It was the\r\ngeneral expectation of the framers of the constitution that under\r\nits provisions slavery would be gradually abolished by the acts of\r\nthe several states where it was recognized.\r\n\r\nThe first great controversy that grew out of slavery was whether\r\nMissouri should be admitted into the Union as a slave state, and\r\nwhether slavery should exist in the western territories.\r\n\r\nThe following provision became part of the law of March 6, 1820,\r\napproved by President James Monroe, and known as the compromise\r\nmeasure of that year:\r\n\r\n\"That, in all that territory ceded by France to the United States\r\nunder the name of 'Louisiana,' which lies north of 36 deg. 30 min.\r\nnorth latitude, not included within the limits of the state\r\ncontemplated by this act, slavery and involuntary servitude,\r\notherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall\r\nhave been duly conviced, shall be and is hereby, forever prohibited:\r\n_Provided, always_, That any person escaping into the same, from\r\nwhom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any other state of\r\nterritory of the United States, such fugitive may be lawfully\r\nreclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or\r\nservice, as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nThis compromise measure fixed the boundary line between free and\r\nslave states in all the territories then belonging to the United\r\nStates.  Slavery was thus forever prohibited within the Territories\r\nof Kansas and Nebraska.  This happy solution was regarded as\r\nsomething more than a mere enactment of Congress.  It was a\r\nterritorial division between the two great sections of our country,\r\nacquiesced in by both without question or disturbance for thirty-\r\nfour years.  The memorable controversy that arose in the 31st\r\nCongress in 1850 in respect to the territory acquired from Mexico\r\ndid not in the least affect or relate to the Territories of Nebraska\r\nand Kansas.  The subject-matter of the several bills originally\r\nembraced in Mr. Clay's report of the committee of thirteen, defined\r\nthe northern boundary of the State of Texas on the line of 36 deg.\r\n30 min. north latitude, provided for the addition of the State of\r\nCalifornia, for territorial governments for New Mexico and Utah,\r\nand for the surrender of fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the resolution annexing Texas to the United States there is this\r\nexpress recognition of the Missouri Compromise line:\r\n\r\n\"New states of convenient size, not exceeding four in number, in\r\naddition to said State of Texas, and having sufficient population,\r\nmay hereafter, by the consent of the said state, be formed out of\r\nthe territory thereof, which shall be _entitled to admission_ under\r\nthe provisions of the Federal constitution; and such states as may\r\nbe formed out of that portion of said territory lying _south_ of\r\n36 deg. 30 min. north latitude, commonly known as the Missouri\r\nCompromise line, _shall be_ admitted into the Union with or without\r\nslavery, as the people of each state asking admission may desire.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention providing for the admission of California expressly\r\nstipulated by a unanimous vote that slavery should be forever\r\nprohibited in that state.  The bill providing for a territorial\r\ngovernment for New Mexico, the great body of the territory which\r\nlay south of the parallel of latitude 36 deg. 30 min., provided,\r\n\"That, when admitted as a state, the said territory, or any portion\r\nof the same, shall be received into the Union, with or without\r\nslavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their\r\nadmission.\"\r\n\r\nThe act organizing the Territory of Utah, lying entirely north of\r\nthe 37th degree of latitude, contains no provision recognizing the\r\nright of the people of that territory to permit slavery within its\r\nborders.  The situation of the state and its population precluded\r\nthe possibility of establishing slavery within its borders.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by the compromise measures of 1820 and 1850,\r\nthe existence or prohibition of slavery was fixed by express laws,\r\nor by conditions which it was fondly believed defined the limits\r\nof slavery, and thus set at rest the only question that threatened\r\nthe union of the states.  This settlement was indorsed and ratified\r\nby the two great parties in their national platforms of 1852, with\r\nthe solemn pledge of both parties that they would resist the re-\r\nopening of these questions.\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the 33rd Congress was composed of 36 Democrats, 20\r\nWhigs and 2 Free Soilers.  The House was composed of 159 Democrats,\r\n71 Whigs, and 4 Free Soilers, with Franklin Pierce as President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nI need not narrate the long struggle in both Houses over the bill\r\nto organize the Territories of Nebraska and Kansas.  It was a direct\r\ninvitation for a physical struggle between the north and south for\r\nthe control of these territories, but it finally passed on the 30th\r\nof May, 1854.\r\n\r\nThis act repealed in express terms the Missouri Compromise of 1820,\r\nand falsely stated the terms of the compromise of 1850, which, as\r\nI have shown, had no reference whatever to the Territories of\r\nNebraska and Kansas.  It re-opened, in the most dangerous form,\r\nthe struggle between freedom and slavery in the western territories,\r\nand was the congressional beginning of the contest which culminated\r\nin the War of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, at this distance of time, to describe the effect\r\nof the act of 1854 upon popular opinion in the northern states.\r\nThe repeal was met in Ohio by an overwhelming sentiment of opposition.\r\nAll who voted for the bill were either refused a nomination or were\r\ndefeated by the people at the polls.  Party lines were obliterated.\r\nIn every congressional district a fusion was formed of Democrats,\r\nWhigs and Free Soilers, and candidates for Congress were nominated\r\nsolely upon the issues made by the Kansas and Nebraska bill.\r\n\r\nI had carefully observed the progress of the bill, had read the\r\narguments for and against it, and was strongly convinced that it\r\nwas the duty of every patriotic citizen to oppose its provisions.\r\nThe firm resolve was declared by the state convention of Ohio,\r\ncomposed of men of all parties, that the institution of slavery\r\nshould gain no advantage by this act of perfidy.  It was denounced\r\nas a violation of a plain specific pledge of the public faith made\r\nby acts of Congress in 1820 and in 1850.  With this feeling there\r\nran current a conviction that the measure adopted was forced by\r\nsouthern domination, and yielded to by ambitious northern dough-\r\nfaces anxious to obtain southern support.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the drift of parties was on sectional lines.  The\r\nwhole south had become Democratic, so that a united south, acting\r\nin concert with a few members from the north, could control the\r\naction of Congress.  I believe that a feeling did then prevail with\r\nmany in the south, that they were superior to men of the north,\r\nthat one southern man could whip four Yankees, that their institution\r\nof slavery naturally produced among the masters, men of superior\r\ncourage, gentlemen who could command and make others obey.  Whether\r\nsuch a feeling did exist or not, it was apparent that the political\r\nleaders in the south were, as a rule, men of greater experience,\r\nwere longer retained in the service of their constituents, and held\r\nhigher public positions than their associates from the north.\r\nBesides, they had in slavery a bond of union that did not tolerate\r\nany difference of opinion when its interests were involved.  This\r\ncompact power needed the assistance only of a few scattered members\r\nfrom the north to give it absolute control.  But now the south was\r\nto meet a different class of opponents.  There had been growing\r\nall over the north, especially in the minds of religious people,\r\na conviction that slavery was wrong.  The literature of the day\r\npromoted this tendency.  The repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\naroused the combative feeling of the north until it became general\r\namong all parties and sects.  Still, the north recognized the legal\r\nexistence of slavery in the south, and did not propose to interfere\r\nwith it, and was entirely content to faithfully observe the\r\nobligations of the constitution and the laws, including those for\r\nthe return of fugitive slaves.  A smaller, but very noisy body of\r\nmen and women denounced the constitution as \"a covenant with hell\r\nand a contract with the devil.\"  A much large number of conservative\r\nvoters formed themselves into a party called the Free Soil party,\r\nwho, professing to be restrained within constitutional limits, yet\r\nfavored the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.  They\r\ninvoked the moral influence and aid of the government for the\r\ngradual prohibition of slavery in the states.  \"Liberty is National,\r\nSlavery is Sectional,\" was their motto.\r\n\r\nThe strong controlling feeling of the great body of the Whigs and\r\nof the Democrats of the north, who opposed the Nebraska and Kansas\r\nlaw was that the law was a violation of existing compromises,\r\ndesigned to extend slavery over free territory, that it ought to\r\nbe repealed, but, if repeal was impracticable, organized effort\r\nshould be made to make both territories free states.  \"Slavery\r\nshall gain no advantage over freedom by violating compromises,\"\r\nwas the cry of a new party, as yet without a name.\r\n\r\nIt was on this basis in the summer of 1854, I became a candidate\r\nfor Congress.  Jacob Brinkerhoff and Thomas H. Ford, both residents\r\nof Richland county, Ohio, and gentlemen of experience and ability,\r\nwere also candidates, but we agreed to submit our pretensions to\r\na convention in that county, and I was selected by a very large\r\nmajority.  A district convention was held at Shelby, in July.  Mr.\r\nJames M. Root, for several terms a Member of Congress, was my chief\r\ncompetitor, but I was nominated, chiefly because I had been less\r\nconnected with old parties and would encounter less prejudice with\r\nthe discordant element of a new party.\r\n\r\nI made a thorough canvass through the district, composed of the\r\ncounties of Huron, Erie, Richland and Morrow.  I visited and spoke\r\nin every town and township in the district.  William D. Linsley,\r\na Member of the 33rd Congress, was my competitor.  He was a farmer,\r\nof popular manners, but defective education.  When first a candidate\r\na letter of his was published in which he spelled the word \"corn\"\r\n\"korne.\"  The Whig newspapers ridiculed him for his faulty spelling,\r\nbut Democrats, who were offended at this criticism, said they would\r\nshow the Whigs how to plant corn, and the incident proved a benefit\r\nrather than an injury to Lindsley.  He had been elected to Congress\r\nin 1852 against a popular Whig by a majority of 754.  He had voted\r\nagainst the Nebraska bill, but had cast one vote that opened the\r\nway to the consideration of that bill, which action was made the\r\nsubject of criticism.  This did not enter as a national element in\r\nthe canvass.  The real issue was whether the Democrats and Free\r\nSoilers would vote for a Whig.  Among the Free Soilers I was regarded\r\nas too conservative on the slavery question.  They were not content\r\nwith the repeal of the offensive provisions of the Nebraska act,\r\nbut demanded the prohibition of slavery in all the territories and\r\nin the District of Columbia.  This feeling was very strong in the\r\nimportant county of Huron.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke in North Fairfield I was interrupted by the distinct\r\nquestion put to me by the pastor of the church in which I spoke,\r\nand whose name I do not recall, whether I would vote for the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.  I knew this was\r\na turning point, but made up my mind to be frank and honest, whatever\r\nmight be the result.  I answered that I would not, that the great\r\nissue was the extension of slavery over the territories.  I fortified\r\nmyself by the opinions of John Q. Adams, but what I said fell like\r\na wet blanket on the audience.  I understood that afterwards, in\r\na church meeting, the preacher commended my frankness and advised\r\nhis people to vote for me.\r\n\r\nThis canvass, more than any other, assumed a religious tone, not\r\non sectarian, but on moral grounds.  Our meetings were frequently\r\nheld in churches, and the speaker was invited to the pulpit, with\r\nthe Bible and hymn-book before him, and frequently with an audience\r\nof men, women and children, arranged as for religious worship.\r\n\r\nThe probable course of Democrats opposed to the Nebraska bill was\r\nmore than a matter of doubt.  They were in the main content with\r\nMr. Lindsley and voted for him.  But out of the general confusion\r\nof parties there arose what was known as the \"Know-nothing\" order,\r\nor American party, opposed to the Catholics, and to free immigration.\r\nIt was a secret organization, with signs and grips.  There were\r\nperhaps one thousand of them in my district, composed about equally\r\nof Democrats and Whigs.  They were indifferent, or neutral, on the\r\npolitical issue of the day.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election in October was against the Democratic\r\nparty in Ohio.  Every Democratic candidate for Congress was defeated.\r\nTwenty-one Members, all opposed to the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, but differing in opinion upon other questions, were\r\nelected to Congress.  The composition of the delegation was somewhat\r\npeculiar, as the party had no name, and no defined principles except\r\nupon the one question of the extension of slavery.  On the day of\r\nthe election everyone was in doubt.  Mr. Kirkwood, who supported\r\nMr. Lindsley, told me it was the strangest election he had ever\r\nseen, that everyone brought his ticket in his vest pocket, and\r\nthere was no electioneering at the polls.  He expressed his opinion,\r\nbut not with much confidence, that Mr. Lindsley was elected.  When\r\nthe votes were counted, it was found that I had 2,823 majority,\r\nhaving carried every county in the district.  Richland county, in\r\nwhich I lived, for the first time cast a majority adverse to the\r\nDemocratic party, I receiving a majority of over 300 votes.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1855, the elements of opposition to the\r\nadministration of President Pierce organized as the Republican\r\nparty.  County conventions were generally held and largely attended.\r\nThe state convention met at Columbus on the 13th day of July, 1855.\r\nIt was composed of heterogenous elements, every shade of political\r\nopinion being represented.  Such antipodes as Giddings, Leiter,\r\nChase, Brinkerhoff, and Lew Campbell met in concert.  The first\r\nquestion that troubled the convention was the selection of a\r\npresident.  It was thought impolitic to take one who had been\r\noffensively conspicuous in one of the old parties.  The result was\r\nthat I was selected, much to my surprise, and, for a time, much to\r\nmy chagrin.  Mr. Allison, since a distinguished Member of the United\r\nStates Senate, was elected secretary of the convention.  I had\r\nnever presided over any assembly excepting an Odd Fellows' lodge.\r\nWhen I assumed the chair I no doubt soon exposed my ignorance.  A\r\ndeclaration of principles was formulated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1.  _Resolved_, That the people who constitute the supreme power\r\nin the United States, should guard with jealous care the rights of\r\nthe several states, as independent governments.  No encroachment\r\nupon their legislative or judicial prerogatives should be permitted\r\nfrom any quarter.\r\n\r\n\"2.  _Resolved_, That the people of the State of Ohio, mindful of\r\nthe blessings conferred upon them by the 'Ordinance of Freedom,'\r\nwhose anniversary our convention this day commemorates, should\r\nestablish for their political guidance the following cardinal rules:\r\n\r\n\"(1).  We will resent the spread of slavery under whatever shape\r\nor color it may be attempted.\r\n\r\n\"(2).  To this end we will labor incessantly to render inoperative\r\nand void that portion of the Kansas and Nebraska bill which abolishes\r\nfreedom in the territory withdrawn from the influence of slavery\r\nby the Missouri Compromise of 1820; and we will oppose by every\r\nlawful and constitutional means, the extension of slavery in any\r\nnational territory, and the further increase of slavery territory\r\nor slave states in this republican confederacy.\r\n\r\n\"3.  _Resolved_, That the recent acts of violence and Civil War in\r\nKansas, incited by the late Vice President of the United States,\r\nand tacitly encouraged by the Executive, command the emphatic\r\ncondemnation of every citizen.\r\n\r\n\"4.  _Resolved_, That a proper retrenchment in all public expenditures,\r\na thoroughly economical administration of our state government, a\r\njust and equal basis of taxation, and single districts for the\r\nelection of members of the legislature, are reforms called for by\r\na wise state policy and justly demanded by the people.\r\n\r\n\"5.  _Resolved_, That a state central committee, consisting of\r\nfive, be appointed by this convention, and the said committee, in\r\naddition to its usual duties, be authorized to correspond with\r\ncommittees of other states for the purpose of agreeing upon a time\r\nand place for holding a national convention of the Republican party\r\nfor the nomination of President and Vice President.\"\r\n\r\nJoshua R. Giddings was the solitary member of the committee opposed\r\nto the resolutions, not, he said, because he objected to the\r\nresolutions themselves, but he thought they were a little too\r\ntender.  They were not strong enough for the old guard and still\r\nthey were better than none.  If it offended his brother to eat meat\r\nhe would eat no more while time lasted.  He was opposed to this\r\nmilk for babes.  He disagreed with his colleagues, but had had the\r\nmisfortune to disagree with people before.  He was used to disagreement\r\nand hoped everybody would vote for the platform.\r\n\r\nLewis D. Campbell said his friend from Ashtabula wanted to make an\r\nissue with Frank Pierce.  He did not wish to raise an issue with\r\nthe dead.  He hoped everybody would vote for the platform.  He did\r\nnot consider the resolutions milk for babes, but strong meat.\r\n\r\nThe platform was adopted by a unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nThe real contention was upon the nomination of governor.  Salmon\r\nP. Chase was nominated, but there was difference of opinion concerning\r\nhis somewhat varied political associations and some criticism of\r\nthem.  In 1845 he had projected what was called a liberty convention.\r\nIn 1848 he had been a member of the Free Soil convention held at\r\nBuffalo and since 1849 had been a Senator of the United States.\r\nThomas H. Ford, my townsman, was nominated as lieutenant governor,\r\nas the representative of the Whig party.  Jacob Brinkerhoff, also\r\nof Mansfield, was nominated as judge of the Supreme Court.  He had\r\nbeen a Member of Congress from 1843 to 1847 as a Democrat, but\r\nearly took decided ground against the extension of slavery.  He\r\nwas the reputed author of what is known as the \"Wilmot Proviso.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of August this famous proviso was offered as an\r\namendment to a bill authorizing the President of the United States\r\nto employ $3,000,000 in negotiations for a peace with Mexico, by\r\npurchase of territory, by David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, a Member\r\nof the House.  \"That, as an express fundamental condition to the\r\nacquisition of any territory from the Republic of Mexico by the\r\nUnited States, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should\r\never exist in any part of said territory.\"  This proviso was adopted\r\nby the House, but was rejected by the Senate.  It was the basis of\r\nthe organization known as the Free Soil party of 1848, and of the\r\nRepublican party in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe other candidates on the ticket were fairly distributed.\r\n\r\nThe canvass of 1855 was conducted mainly by Senator Chase and\r\nColonel Ford.  I participated in it to some extent, but was chiefly\r\nengaged in closing my business in preparation for the approaching\r\nsession of Congress.  The result of the election was as follows:\r\nChase, 146,770 votes; Medill, 131,019; Allen Trimble, 24,276.\r\n\r\nThe election of Senator Chase, upon a distinctly Republican platform,\r\nestablished the fact that the majority of the voters of Ohio were\r\nRepublicans as defined by the creed of that party.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1855 I made my first trip to Iowa, accompanied by\r\nAmos Townsend and James Cobean.  At that time Iowa was a far-off\r\nstate, thinly populated, but being rapidly settled.  We passed\r\nthrough Chicago, which at that time contained a population of about\r\n50,000.  The line of railroad extended to the Mississippi River.\r\nFrom thence we traveled in a stage to Des Moines, now the capital\r\nof Iowa, but then a small village with about 1,000 inhabitants.\r\nThe northern and western parts of the state were mostly unsold\r\npublic lands, open to entry.  My three brothers, James, Lampson,\r\nand Hoyt, were living in Des Moines.  James was a merchant in\r\nbusiness.  Lampson was the editor and proprietor of a newspaper,\r\nand Hoyt was actively engaged in the purchase and sale of land.\r\nWith Hoyt for a guide we drove in a carriage as far north as Fort\r\nDodge, where a new land office had been recently established.  The\r\nwhole country was an open plain with here and there a cabin, with\r\nno fences and but little timber.  We arrived at Fort Dodge on\r\nSaturday evening, intending to spend some time there in locating\r\nland.  The tavern at which we stopped was an unfinished frame\r\nbuilding with no plastering, and sash without glass in the windows.\r\nOn the next day, Sunday, Cobean invited us to join him in drinking\r\nsome choice whisky he had brought with him.  We did so in the dining\r\nroom.  While thus engaged the landlady came to us and told Cobean\r\nthat she was not very well, and would be glad if he would give her\r\nsome whisky.  He handed her the bottle, and she went to the other\r\nend of the room and there poured out nearly a glass full and drank\r\nit.  Cobean was so much alarmed lest the woman should become drunk\r\nthat he insisted upon leaving the town immediately, and we acquiesced\r\nand left.  Afterwards we learned that she became very drunk, and\r\nthe landlord was very violent in denouncing us for giving her\r\nwhisky, but we got outside the county before the sun went down.\r\nI had frequent occasion to be in Fort Dodge afterwards, but heard\r\nnothing more of the landlord or his wife.\r\n\r\nThe road to Council Bluffs from Des Moines was over a high rolling\r\nprairie with scarcely any inhabitants.  The village of Omaha,\r\nopposite Council Bluffs, contained but a few frame houses of little\r\nvalue.  The settlement of Iowa and Nebraska after this period is\r\nalmost marvelous.  Iowa now (1895), contains over 2,000,000 and\r\nNebraska over 1,200,000 people.  The twelve states composing the\r\nnorth central division of the United States contained 5,403,595\r\ninhabitants in 1850, and now number over 24,000,000, or more than\r\nquadruple the number in 1850, and more than the entire population\r\nof the United States in that year.  I have frequently visited these\r\nstates since, and am not surprised at their wonderful growth.  I\r\nbelieve there is no portion of the earth's surface of equal area\r\nwhich is susceptible of a larger population than that portion of\r\nthe United States lying north of the Ohio River, and between the\r\nAlleghany Mountains and the Missouri River.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nEARLY DAYS IN CONGRESS.\r\nMy First Speech in the House--Struggle for the Possession of Kansas\r\n--Appointed as a Member of the Kansas Investigating Committee--The\r\nInvasion of March 30, 1855--Exciting Scenes in the Second District\r\nof Kansas--Similar Violence in Other Territorial Districts--Return\r\nand Report of the Committee--No Relief Afforded the People of Kansas\r\n--Men of Distinction in the 34th Congress--Long Intimacy with\r\nSchuyler Colfax.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Whig party had disappeared from the roll of parties in\r\nthe United States.  It was a bad name for a good party.  English\r\nin its origin, it had no significance in American politics.  The\r\nword \"Democratic,\" as applied to the opposing party, was equally\r\na misnomer.  The word \"Democracy,\" from which it is derived, means\r\na government of the people, but the controlling power of the\r\nDemocratic party resided in the southern states, where a large\r\nportion of the people were slaves, and the ruling class were\r\nslaveholders, and the name was not applicable to such a people.\r\nThe Republican party then represented the progressive tendency of\r\nthe age, the development of the country, the opposition to slavery\r\nand the preservation of the Union.  It was about to engage in a\r\npolitical contest for the administration of the government.  It\r\nwas in the minority in the Senate, and had but a bare plurality in\r\nthe House.  It had to contest with an adverse Executive and Supreme\r\nCourt, with a well-organized party in possession of all the patronage\r\nof the government, in absolute control of the slaveholding states,\r\nand supported by strong minorities in each of the free states.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of parties when the 34th Congress met in\r\nthe old halls of the Senate and House of Representatives on the\r\n3rd of December, 1855.  The Senate was composed of 43 Democrats\r\nand 17 Republicans.  There were four vacancies.  The House was\r\ncomposed of 97 Republicans, 82 Democrats, and 45 classed as Third\r\nParty men, mostly as Americans.  Eight Members were absent, and\r\nnot yet classified.  An unusual proportion of the Members were new\r\nin public life, the result of the revolution of parties caused by\r\nthe Nebraska bill.  The Senate was already organized with Mr.\r\nBright, of Indiana, as president _pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nThe first duty of the House was to elect a speaker, a majority of\r\nthe Members present being necessary to a choice.  The balloting\r\nfor speaker continued until February 2, 1856, when Nathaniel P.\r\nBanks was elected under the plurality rule.  During these two months\r\nthe House was without a speaker, and also without rules except the\r\ngeneral principles of parliamentary law.  The clerk of the last\r\nHouse of Representatives presided.  Innumerable speeches were made,\r\nsome of them very long, but many brief ones were made by the new\r\nMembers who took the occasion to air their oratory.  Timothy Day,\r\none of my colleagues, a cynical bachelor and proprietor of the\r\nCincinnati \"Commercial,\" who sat by my side, was constantly employed\r\nin writing for his paper.  When a new voice was heard he would put\r\nhis hand to his ear, listen awhile and then, turning impatiently\r\nto his writing, would say to me:  \"Another dead cock in the pit.\"\r\nThis cynical suppression of a new Member rather alarmed me, but on\r\nthe 9th of January, as appears from the \"Globe,\" I ventured to make\r\na few remarks.  When I sat down I turned to Mr. Day and said:\r\n\"Another dead cock in the pit.\"  He relieved me by saying:  \"Not\r\nquite so bad as that.\"  The first speech I made in the House\r\ncontained my political creed at the time.  I here insert a paragraph\r\nor two:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to say a few words; and I would preface them with the\r\nremark, that I do not intend, while I have a seat in this House,\r\nto occupy much of its time in speaking.  But I wish to state now\r\nwhy I have voted, and shall continue to vote, for Mr. Banks.  I\r\ncare not whether he is a member of the American party or not.  I\r\nhave been informed that he is, and I believe that he is.  But I\r\nrepeat I care not to what party he belongs.  I understood him to\r\ntake this position,--that the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\nwas an act of great dishonor, and that under no circumstances\r\nwhatever will he--if he have the power--allow the institution of\r\nhuman slavery to derive any benefit from that repeal.  That is my\r\nposition.  I have been a Whig, but I will yield all party preferences,\r\nand will act in concert with men of all parties and opinions who\r\nwill steadily aid in preserving our western territories for free\r\nlabor; and I say now, that I never will vote for a man for speaker\r\nof this house, unless he convinces me, by his conduct and by his\r\nvoice, that he never will, if he has the power to prevent it, allow\r\nthe institution of slavery to derive any advantage from repealing\r\nthe compromise of 1820.\r\n\r\n\"I believe Mr. Banks will be true to that principle, and, therefore,\r\nI vote for him without regard to his previous political associations,\r\nor to his adherence to the American party.  I vote for him simply\r\nbecause he has had the manliness to say here, that, having the\r\npower, he will resist the encroachments of slavery, even by opposing\r\nthe admission of any slave state that may be formed out of the\r\nterritory north and west of Missouri.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the promise I made not to occupy much of the time\r\nof the House in speaking, and the cynicism of my friend Day, I did\r\npartake frequently in the debate on the organization of the House.\r\nI became involved in a contest with Mr. Dunn, of Indiana, who had\r\nsteadily refused to vote for Mr. Banks for speaker, to which I\r\ndeemed proper to refer.  He said he was not to be deterred from\r\nperforming his duty, as he understood it, by the criticisms of the\r\n\"neophyte\" from Ohio.  I replied at considerable length and with\r\nsome feeling.  In my reply I repeated my position in respect to\r\nthe repeal of the Missouri Compromise, declaring:  \"If the repeal\r\nwas wrong all northern and southern men alike ought to help to\r\nreinstate that restriction.  Nothing less than that will satisfy\r\nthe country; and if it is not done, as it probably will not be, we\r\nwill maintain our position of resisting the admission of Kansas as\r\na slave state, under all possible circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nLater on in the debate I declared:\r\n\r\n\"I am no Abolitionist in the sense in which the term is used; I\r\nhave always been a conservative Whig.  I was willing to stand by\r\nthe compromises of 1820 and 1850; but, when our Whig brethren of\r\nthe south allow this administration to lead them off from their\r\nprinciples, when they abandon the position which Henry Clay would\r\nhave taken, forget his name and achievements, and decline any longer\r\nto carry his banner--they lose all their claims on me.  And I say\r\nnow, that until this wrong is righted, until Kansas is admitted as\r\na free state, I cannot act in party association with them.  Whenever\r\nthat question is settled rightly I will have no disposition to\r\ndisturb the harmony which ought to exist between the north and\r\nsouth.  I do not propose to continue agitation; I only appear here\r\nto demand justice,--to demand compliance with compromises fully\r\nagreed upon and declared by law.  I ask no more, and I will submit\r\nto no less.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a narrow platform, but it was the one supported by public\r\nopinion.  I believed that a majority of the Members called Americans,\r\nespecially those from the south, were quite willing that Kansas\r\nshould be admitted as a free state, but local pride prevented such\r\na declaration.  It is easy to perceive now that if this had been\r\npromptly done the slavery question would have been settled for many\r\nyears.  But that opportunity was permitted to pass unused.  The\r\npeople, both north and south, were thoroughly aroused.  No compromise\r\nwas possible.  The contest could only be settled by the force of\r\nsuperior numbers.  That was the logic of the Nebraska bill, which\r\nwas an appeal to the people of both sections, already greatly\r\nexcited, to struggle for, and, if necessary, to fight for the\r\npossession of a large and beautiful territory.  It forced the\r\nirrepressible conflict in the most dangerous form.\r\n\r\nOn the one side were the border ruffians of Missouri, hereafter\r\ndescribed, backed by the general sentiment of the south, and actively\r\nsupported by the administration and by leading Democrats who had\r\nheld high positions in the public service.  On the other side were\r\na large number of free state men in the western states, who looked\r\nforward to the opening of Nebraska and Kansas as a new field of\r\nenterprise.  They were quite ready to fight for their opinions\r\nagainst slavery.  They were supported by a general feeling of\r\nresentment in the north, caused by the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise.\r\n\r\nLong before the meeting of Congress the actual struggle for the\r\npossession of Kansas commenced.  After the passage of the Kansas\r\nbill we had reports in the newspapers of gross frauds at pretended\r\nelections of rival legislatures, of murder and other crimes, in\r\nshort, of actual civil war in Kansas; but the accounts were\r\ncontradictory.  It was plainly the first duty of Congress to\r\nascertain the exact condition of affairs in that territory.  This\r\ncould not be done until a speaker was elected.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th day of January, 1856, President Pierce sent to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, still unorganized, a message upon the\r\ncondition of affairs in Kansas.  A question was made whether a\r\nmessage from the President could be received before a speaker had\r\nbeen elected, but it was decided that the message should be read.\r\nThe first paragraph is as follows;\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances have occurred to disturb the course of governmental\r\norganization in the Territory of Kansas, and produce there a\r\ncondition of things which renders it incumbent on me to call your\r\nattention to the subject, and urgently to recommend the adoption\r\nby you of such measures of legislation as the grave exigencies of\r\nthe case appear to require.\"\r\n\r\nThe President then gave his exposition of the condition of affairs\r\nin that territory.  This exposition was regarded as a partisan one\r\nin favor of the so-called pro-slavery legislative assembly, which\r\nmet the 2d day of July, 1855.  He recommended \"that a special\r\nappropriation be made to defray any expense which may become\r\nrequisite in the execution of the laws or the maintenance of public\r\norder in the Territory of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nThis was regarded as a threat of the employment of the army to\r\nenforce the enactments of a usurping legislature.  Congress took\r\nno action upon the message until after the organization of the\r\nHouse.  On the 14th of January, 1856, a motion was made by Mr.\r\nHouston that the message of the President, in reference to the\r\nTerritory of Kansas, be referred to the committee of the whole on\r\nthe state of the Union.  This motion was agreed to.  No further\r\naction was taken upon the message, but it remained in abeyance.\r\nCongress was not prepared to act without full information of the\r\nactual condition of affairs in that territory.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March, 1856, the House of Representatives adopted\r\na series of resolutions offered by Mr. Dunn, of Indiana, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a committee of three of the Members of this House,\r\nto be appointed by the speaker, shall proceed to inquire into and\r\ncollect evidence in regard to the troubles in Kansas generally,\r\nand particularly in regard to any fraud or force attempted, or\r\npracticed, in reference to any of the elections which have taken\r\nplace in said territory, either under the law organizing said\r\nterritory, or under any pretended law which may be alleged to have\r\ntaken effect since.  That they shall fully investigate and take\r\nproof of all violent and tumultuous proceedings in said territory\r\nat any time since the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska act, whether\r\nengaged in by residents of said territory, or by any person or\r\npersons from elsewhere going into said territory and doing, or\r\nencouraging others to do, any act of violence or public disturbance\r\nagainst the laws of the United States, or the rights, peace, and\r\nsafety of the residents of said territory; and for that purpose\r\nsaid committee shall have full power to send for and examine and\r\ntake copies of all such papers, public records, and proceedings,\r\nas in their judgment will be useful in the premises; and also, to\r\nsend for persons and examine them on oath, or affirmation, as to\r\nmatters within their knowledge touching the matters of said\r\ninvestigation; and said committee, by their chairman, shall have\r\nthe power to administer all necessary oaths or affirmations connected\r\nwith their aforesaid duties.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved, further_, That said committee may hold their investigations\r\nat such places and times as to them may seem advisable, and that\r\nthey may have leave of absence from the duties of this House until\r\nthey shall have completed such investigation.  That they be authorized\r\nto employ one or more clerks, and one or more assistant sergeants-\r\nat-arms, to aid them in their investigation; and may administer to\r\nthem an oath or affirmation faithfully to perform the duties assigned\r\nto them respectively, and to keep secret all matters, which may\r\ncome to their knowledge touching such investigation as said committee\r\nshall direct, until the report of the same shall be submitted to\r\nthis House; and said committee may discharge any such clerk or\r\nassistant sergeant-at-arms for neglect of duty or disregard of\r\ninstructions in the premises, and employ others under like\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved, further_, That if any persons shall in any manner\r\nobstruct or hinder said committee, or attempt so to do, in their\r\ninvestigation, or shall refuse to attend on said committee, and to\r\ngive evidence when summoned for that purpose, or shall refuse to\r\nproduce any papers, book, public record, or other proceeding in\r\ntheir possession or control, to said committee, when so required,\r\nor shall make any disturbance where said committee are holding\r\ntheir sittings, said committee may, if they see fit, cause any and\r\nevery such person to be arrested by said assistant sergeant-at-\r\narms, and brought before this House, to be dealt with as for a\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved, further_, That for the purpose of defraying the expenses\r\nof said commission, there be and hereby is appropriated the sum of\r\nten thousand ($10,000) dollars, to be paid out of the contingent\r\nfund of this House.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved, further_, That the President of the United States be\r\nand is hereby requested to furnish to said committee, should they\r\nbe met with any serious opposition by bodies of lawless men in the\r\ndischarge of their duties aforesaid, such aid from any military\r\nforce as may, at the time, be convenient to them, as may be necessary\r\nto remove such opposition, and enable said committee, without\r\nmolestation, to proceed with their labors.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved, further_, That when said committee shall have completed\r\nsaid investigation, they report all the evidence so collected to\r\nthis House.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of March, 1856, the speaker appointed Lewis D. Campbell,\r\nof Ohio, William A. Howard, of Michigan, and Mordecai Oliver, of\r\nMissouri, as the special committee of the House under the above\r\nresolution.  On the same day Mr. Campbell requested to be excused\r\nfrom the committee referred to, and I was appointed by the speaker\r\nin his place, leaving Mr. Howard as chairman.\r\n\r\nI accepted the position assigned me with much diffidence.  I knew\r\nit was a laborious one, that it would take me away from my duties\r\nin the House, expose me to a great deal of fatigue and some danger,\r\nyet I felt that the appointment on so important a committee was a\r\nhigh compliment when given to a new Member, and at once made\r\npreparations for the task before me.\r\n\r\nThe committee organized at the city of Washington, on the 27th of\r\nMarch, 1856.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sherman expressed a strong desire to accompany me.  I tried\r\nto frighten her from going, but this made her more resolute, and\r\nI consented.  She remained with or near us during our stay in Kansas\r\nand Missouri, and for a time was accompanied by Mrs. Oliver, a\r\ncharming lady, to whom we were much indebted for kindness and\r\ncivility where most of her sex were unfriendly.\r\n\r\nThe investigation continued from our arrival at St. Louis, on the\r\n12th day of April, 1856, until our arrival at Detroit, on the 17th\r\nday of June following, and was conducted in all respects like a\r\njudicial trial.  The testimony taken filled an octavo volume of\r\n1,188 pages.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard, during our stay in Kansas, was not in very good health,\r\nbut he never relaxed in his labor until the testimony closed.  He\r\nwas a man of marked ability, a good lawyer, conservative in all\r\nhis ideas and tendencies, and throughly fair and impartial.  At\r\nhis request I accompanied him, with our excellent corps of assistants,\r\nto his home in Detroit, where his health so failed that he was\r\nconfined to his bed for a week.  This threw upon me the preparation\r\nof the report.  The resolutions, under which we were acting, did\r\nnot require a report from the committee, but only required a report\r\nof all the evidence collected, to the House of Representatives,\r\nbut we felt that such a report without a summary of the evidence\r\nand principal facts proven would not be satisfactory to the House.\r\n\r\nThe majority and minority reports contained 109 pages of printed\r\nmatter and entered into full details as to the condition of affairs\r\nin that territory, and of every election held therein.  When the\r\nact to organize the Territory of Kansas was passed, May 30, 1854,\r\nthe greater portion of the eastern border of the territory was\r\nincluded in Indian reservations not open for settlements, and in\r\nno portion were there more than a few white settlers.  The Indian\r\npopulation of the territory was rapidly decreasing, while many\r\nemigrants from different parts of the country, were anxiously\r\nwaiting the extinction of the Indian title, and the establishment\r\nof a territorial government, to seek new homes on the fertile\r\nprairies which would be opened to settlement.  It cannot be doubted\r\nthat if the free condition of Kansas had been left undisturbed by\r\nCongress, that territory would have had a rapid, peaceful, and\r\nprosperous settlement.  Its climate, its soil, and its easy access\r\nto the older settlements, would have made it the favored course\r\nfor the tide of emigration constantly flowing to the west, and in\r\na brief period it would have been admitted to the Union as a free\r\nstate, without sectional excitement.  If so organized, none but\r\nthe kindest feelings would have existed between its citizens and\r\nthose of the adjoining State of Missouri.  Their mutual interests\r\nand intercourse, instead of endangering the harmony of the Union,\r\nwould have strengthened the ties of national brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe testimony taken by the committee clearly showed that before\r\nthe proposition to repeal the Missouri Compromise was introduced\r\ninto Congress, the people of western Missouri were indifferent to\r\nthe prohibition of slavery in the territory, and neither asked nor\r\ndesired its repeal.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the prohibition was removed by the action of Congress,\r\nthe aspect of affairs entirely charged.  The whole country was\r\nagitated by the reopening of a controversy which conservative men\r\nin different sections believed had been settled in every state and\r\nterritory by some law beyond the danger of repeal.  The excitement\r\nwhich always accompanied the discussion of the slavery question\r\nwas greatly increased by the hope, on the one hand, of extending\r\nslavery into a region from which it had been excluded by law; and,\r\non the other, by a sense of wrong done by what was regarded as a\r\nbreach of public faith.  This excitement was naturally transferred\r\ninto the border counties of Missouri and the territory, as settlers\r\nfavoring free or slave institutions moved into them.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after the organic law passed, and as soon as its\r\npassage could be known on the border, leading citizens of Missouri\r\ncrossed into the territory, held \"squatter meetings,\" voted at\r\nelections, committed crimes of violence, and then returned to their\r\nhomes.  This unlawful interference was continued in every important\r\nstage in the history of the territory; _every election_ was\r\ncontrolled, not by the actual settlers, but by the citizens of\r\nMissouri; and, as a consequence, every officer in the territory,\r\nfrom constable to legislator, except those appointed by the President,\r\nowed his position to non-resident voters.  None were elected by\r\nthe settlers, and no political power whatever, however important,\r\nwas exercised by the people of the territory.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1854, the Governor of Kansas, A. H. Reeder, and other\r\nofficers appointed by the President, arrived in the territory.\r\nSettlers from all parts of the country came in great number, entering\r\ntheir claims and building their cabins.  The first election was\r\nfor delegate to Congress and was held on the 29th of November,\r\n1854.  The governor divided the territory into seventeen election\r\ndistricts, appointed judges, and prescribed proper rules for the\r\nelection.  The report of the committee enters into full details as\r\nto this election and all subsequent thereto in each district.  The\r\nconduct of the election in the second district, held at the village\r\nof Douglas, nearly fifty miles from the Missouri line, is a fair\r\nspecimen of all the elections in Kansas.  The report says:\r\n\r\n\"On the second day before the election large companies of men came\r\ninto the district in wagons and on horseback, and declared that\r\nthey were from the State of Missouri, and were going to Douglas to\r\nvote.  On the morning of the election they gathered around the\r\nhouse where the election was to be held.  Two of the judges appointed\r\nby the governor did not appear, and other judges were selected by\r\nthe crowd; all then voted.  In order to make a pretense of right\r\nto vote, some persons of the company kept a pretended register of\r\nsquatter claims, on which anyone could enter his name, and then\r\nassert he had a claim in the territory.  A citizen of the district,\r\nwho was himself a candidate for delegate to Congress was told by\r\none of the strangers that he would be abused, and probably killed,\r\nif he challenged a vote.  He was seized by the collar, called a\r\ndamned Abolitionist, and was compelled to seek protection in the\r\nroom with the judges.  About the time the polls were closed these\r\nstrangers mounted their horses and got into their wagons and cried\r\nout, 'All aboard for Westport.'  A number were recognized as\r\nresidents of Missouri, and among them was Samuel H. Woodson, a\r\nleading lawyer of Independence.  Of those whose names are on the\r\npoll-books, 35 were resident settlers and 226 were non-residents.\"\r\n\r\nIn January and February, 1855, the governor, A. H. Reeder, caused\r\na census to be taken of the inhabitants and qualified voters in\r\nKansas.  On the day the census was completed he issued his proclamation\r\nfor an election to be held March 30, 1855, for members of the\r\nlegislative assembly of the territory.  The proclamation prescribed\r\nthe boundaries of the districts, the places for polls, the names\r\nof judges, the apportionment of members, and the qualification of\r\nvoters.  Had it been observed, a just and fair election would have\r\nreflected the will of the people of Kansas.  Before the election,\r\nhowever, false and inflammatory rumors were busily circulated among\r\nthe people of western Missouri.  They grossly exaggerated and\r\nmisrepresented the number and character of the emigration then\r\npassing into the territory.  By the active exertions of many of\r\nthe leading citizens, the passions and prejudices of the people of\r\nthat state were greatly excited.  Several residents of Missouri\r\ntestified to the character of the reports circulated among and\r\ncredited by the people.  These efforts were successful.  By an\r\norganized movement, which extended from Andrew county, in the north,\r\nto Jasper county, in the south, and as far eastward as Boone and\r\nCole counties (Missouri), companies of men were collected in\r\nirregular parties and sent into every council district in the\r\nterritory, and into every representative district but one.  The\r\nmen were so distributed as to control the election in every district.\r\nThey went to vote, and with the avowed design to make Kansas a\r\nslave state.  They were generally armed and equipped, carrying with\r\nthem their own provisions and tents, and so marched into the\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nAs this election was for a legislature, the validity of which was\r\ncontested, the committee took great pains to procure testimony as\r\nto the election in each election district.  The election in the\r\nsecond district is a fair specimen.  In that district, on the\r\nmorning of the election, the judges appointed by the governor\r\nappeared and opened the polls.  Their names were Harrison Burson,\r\nNathaniel Ramsay and Mr. Ellison.  The Missourians began to arrive\r\nearly in the morning, some 500 or 600 of them in wagons and carriages\r\nand on horseback, and under the lead of Samuel J. Jones, then\r\npostmaster of Westport, Missouri; Claiborne F. Jackson and a Mr.\r\nSteeley, of Independence, Missouri.  They were armed with double-\r\nbarreled guns, rifles, bowie-knives and pistols, and had flags\r\nhoisted.  They held a sort of informal election off at one side,\r\nat first for governor of Kansas Territory, and shortly afterwards\r\nannounced Thomas Johnson, of Shawnee Mission, elected governor.\r\nThe polls had been opened but a short time when Mr. Jones marched\r\nwith the crowd up to the window and demanded that they be allowed\r\nto vote, without swearing as to their residence.  After some noisy\r\nand threatening talk, Claiborne F. Jackson addressed the crowd,\r\nsaying that they had come there to vote; that they had a right to\r\nvote if they had been there but five minutes, and he was not willing\r\nto go home without voting; this was received with cheers.  Jackson\r\nthen called upon them to form into little bands of fifteen or\r\ntwenty, which they did, and went to an ox-wagon filled with guns,\r\nwhich were distributed among them, and proceeded to load some of\r\nthem on the ground.  In pursuance of Jackson's request, they tied\r\nwhite tape or ribbons in their button holes, so as to distinguish\r\nthem from the \"Abolitionists.\"  They again demanded that the judges\r\nresign.  Upon their refusing to do so they smashed in the window,\r\nsash and all, presented their pistols and guns, and at the same\r\ntime threatened to shoot.  Some one on the outside cried out not\r\nto shoot, as there were pro-slavery men in the house with the\r\njudges.  They then put a pry under the corner of the house, which\r\nwas built of logs, lifted it up a few inches, and let it fall again,\r\nbut desisted upon being again told that there were pro-slavery men\r\nin the house.  During this time the crowd repeatedly demanded to\r\nbe allowed to vote without being sworn, and Mr. Ellison, one of\r\nthe judges, expressed himself willing, but the other two judges\r\nrefused; thereupon a body of men, headed by Sheriff Jones, rushed\r\ninto the judges' room with cocked pistols and drawn bowie-knives\r\nin their hands, and approached Burson and Ramsay.  Jones pulled\r\nout his watch and said he would given them five minutes to resign\r\nin, or die.  When the five minutes had expired and the judges had\r\nnot resigned, Jones now said he would given them another minute\r\nand no more.  Ellison told his associates that if they did not\r\nresign there would be one hundred shots fired in the room in less\r\nthan fifteen minutes, and then snatching up the ballot-box ran out\r\ninto the crowd, holding up the ballot-box and hurrahing for Missouri.\r\nAbout that time Burson and Ramsay were called out by their friends,\r\nand not suffered to return.  As Mr. Burson went out he put the\r\nballot poll-books in his pocket and took them with him, and as he\r\nwas going out Jones snatched some papers away from him, and shortly\r\nafterwards came out himself, holding them up, crying, \"Hurrah for\r\nMissouri!\"  After he discovered they were not the poll-books he\r\ntook a party of men with him and captured the books from a Mr.\r\nUmberger, to whom Burson had given them.  They then chose two new\r\njudges and proceeded with the election.  They also threatened to\r\nkill the judges if they did not receive their votes, or resign.\r\nThey said no man should vote who would submit to be sworn; that\r\nthey would kill any man who would offer to do so.  Some of the\r\ncitizens who were about the window, but had not voted when the\r\ncrowd of Missourians marched up, upon attempting to vote were driven\r\nback by the mob, or driven off.  One of them, Mr. I. M. Mace, was\r\nasked if he would take the oath, and upon his replying that he\r\nwould if the judges required it, he was dragged through the crowd\r\naway from the polls, amid cries of \"kill the damned nigger-thief,\"\r\n\"cut his throat,\" \"tear his heart out,\" etc.  After they got into\r\nthe outside of the crowd they stood around him with cocked revolvers\r\nand drawn bowie-knives, one man putting a knife to his breast to\r\nthat it touched him, another holding a cocked pistol to his ear,\r\nwhile another struck at him with a club.\r\n\r\nThe Missourians declared that they had a right to vote, if they\r\nhad been in the territory but five minutes.  Some said they had\r\nbeen hired to come there and vote, and got a dollar a day, \"and by\r\nGod they would vote or die there.\"  They said the 30th day of March\r\nwas an important day, as Kansas would be made a slave state on that\r\nday.  They began to leave in the direction of Missouri in the\r\nafternoon, after they had voted, leaving some thirty or forty around\r\nthe house where the election was held, to guard the polls till\r\nafter the election was over.  The citizens of the territory were\r\nnot armed, except those who took part in the mob, and a large\r\nportion of them did not vote.  Three hundred and forty-one votes\r\nwere polled there that day, of which but some thirty were citizens.\r\nA protest against the election was prepared and sent to the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nA similarly organized and conducted election was held in each of\r\nthe other districts of the territory, varying only in degrees of\r\nfraud and violence.  In the fifteenth district it was proven that\r\nseveral hundred Missourians appeared and voted.  Several speeches\r\nwere made at the polls, and among those who spoke was Major Oliver,\r\none of our committee.  He urged all persons to use no harsh words\r\nand expressed a hope that nothing would be said or done to wound\r\nthe feelings of the most sensitive on the other side, giving some\r\nreasons, based on the Missouri Compromise, why they should vote,\r\nbut he himself did not vote.  The whole number of votes cast in\r\nthat district was 417.  The number of legal voters was about 80.\r\nOf the names on the poll-book but 62 were on the census roll.  But\r\na small portion, estimated at one-fourth of the legal voters, voted.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the so called pro-slavery legislature rested upon\r\nthis election.  It is hardly necessary at this late day to say that\r\nsuch a legislative body could not rightly assume or lawfully exercise\r\nlegislative functions over any law-abiding community.  Their\r\nenactments were, by every principle of law and right, null and\r\nvoid.  The existence of fraud at the election was admitted by every\r\none, but it was defended on the ground that the New England Emigrant\r\nAid Society had imported a great number of emigrants into Kansas\r\nfor the sole purpose of making that territory a free state.  This\r\nclaim was thoroughly investigated and the organization and history\r\nof the society examined.  The only persons who emigrated into the\r\nterritory under the auspices of this company in 1855, prior to the\r\nelection in March, was a party of 169 persons who came under the\r\ncharge of Charles Robinson, and of whom sixty-seven were women and\r\nchildren.  They came as actual settlers, intending to make their\r\nhomes in the territory, and for no other purpose.  Some of them\r\nreturned, but most of them became settlers.  A few voted at the\r\nelection in Lawrence but the number was small.  The names of these\r\nemigrants were ascertained and thirty-seven of them were found upon\r\nthe poll-books.  This company of peaceful emigrants, moving with\r\ntheir household goods, was distorted into an invading horde of\r\npauper Abolitionists, who were, with others of a similar character,\r\nto control the domestic institutions of the territory, and then\r\noverturn those of a neighboring state.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of March 30 left both parties in a state of excitement,\r\ntending directly to produce violence.  The successful party was\r\nlawless and reckless, while assuming the name of the \"Law and Order\"\r\nparty.  The Free State party, at first surprised and confounded,\r\nwas greatly irritated, but soon resolved to prevent the success of\r\nthe invasion.  In some districts, protests were sent to the governor;\r\nin others such action was prevented by threats, in others by want\r\nof time, and in others by the belief that a new election would\r\nbring a new invasion.  About the same time, all classes of men\r\ncommenced carrying deadly weapons about their persons.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, a slight or accidental quarrel produced unusual\r\nviolence.  Lawless acts became frequent and passed unpunished.\r\nThis unhappy condition of the public mind was further increased by\r\nacts of violence in western Missouri, where, in April, a newspaper,\r\ncalled the \"Parkville Luminary,\" was destroyed by a mob, and numerous\r\nacts of violence and homicides committed.  Some innocent persons\r\nwere unlawfully arrested and others ordered to leave the territory.\r\nThe first one notified to leave was William Phillips, a lawyer of\r\nLeavenworth, and upon his refusal the mob forcibly seized him, took\r\nhim across the river, carried him several miles into Missouri, and\r\nthen tarred and feathered him, shaving one side of his head and\r\ncommitting other gross indignities upon his person.  Judge Lecompte,\r\nchief justice of the territory, Colonel L. N. Burns, of Weston,\r\nMissouri, and others, took part in and made speeches at a bitterly\r\npartisan meeting, the tendency of which was to produce violence\r\nand disorder.\r\n\r\nAfter the most careful examination of the poll-books and the\r\ntestimony taken, we were convinced beyond all doubt that the election\r\nof the 30th of March, 1855, was utterly void.  It was the result\r\nof an organized invasion from the State of Missouri, a lawless\r\nseizure of the conduct of the election, and the open voting by\r\nthousands of persons who neither resided in nor pretended to be\r\nresidents of Kansas.  Not content with voting they made false\r\nreturns of votes never cast, and excluded legal voters because they\r\nwere \"Abolitionists.\"\r\n\r\nA more wanton and shameless overthrow of popular rights cannot be\r\nfound in history.\r\n\r\nThe so-called legislative assembly, thus elected, met at Pawnee,\r\non the 2nd of July, 1855.  It attempted to make laws for Kansas,\r\nand to that end adopted, in substance, the laws of the State of\r\nMissouri in gross as the laws for the territory, but, to retain\r\nits power, it provided that every officer of the territory, executive\r\nand judicial, was to be appointed by the legislature, or by some\r\nofficer appointed by it.\r\n\r\nThe legality of this legislature was denied by the great majority\r\nof the people who never acquiesced in or obeyed its enactments,\r\nthus taking the only course open to them to secure a lawful\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhile the alleged legislative assembly was in session, a movement\r\nwas instituted to form a state government, and apply for admission\r\ninto the Union as a state.  The first step taken by the people of\r\nthe territory, in consequence of the invasion of March 30, 1855,\r\nwas the circulation, for signature, of a graphic and truthful\r\nmemorial to Congress.  Every allegation in this memorial was\r\nsustained by the testimony.  No further step was taken, as it was\r\nhoped that some action by the general government would protect them\r\nin their rights.  When the alleged legislative assembly proceeded\r\nto construct the series of enactments referred to, the settlers\r\nwere of the opinion that submission to them would result in entirely\r\ndepriving them of the rights secured to them by the organic law.\r\n\r\nTheir political condition was freely discussed in the territory\r\nduring the summer of 1855.  Several meetings were held in reference\r\nto holding a convention to form a state government, and to apply\r\nfor admission into the Union as a state.  Public opinion gradually\r\nsettled in favor of such an application to the Congress to meet in\r\nDecember, 1855.  The first general meeting was held at Lawrence,\r\non the 15th of August, 1855.  Other meetings were held in various\r\nparts of the territory, which indorsed the action of the Lawrence\r\nmeeting, and delegates were selected in compliance with its\r\nrecommendation.  An election was called by a proclamation addressed\r\nto the legal voters of Kansas, requesting them to meet at their\r\nseveral precincts at the time and places named in the proclamation,\r\nthen and there to cast their ballots for members of a constitutional\r\nconvention, to meet at Topeka, on the fourth Tuesday of October.\r\n\r\nElections were held at the time and places designated, and the\r\nreturns were sent to the executive committee.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was proclaimed by the executive committee,\r\nand the members elect were required to meet on the 23rd of October,\r\n1855, at Topeka.  In pursuance of this proclamation and direction\r\nthe constitutional convention met at the time and place appointed,\r\nand framed a state constitution.  A memorial to Congress was also\r\nprepared, praying the admission of Kansas into the Union as a state\r\nunder that constitution.  The convention also provided that the\r\nquestion of the adoption of the constitution, and other questions,\r\nbe submitted to the people, and required the executive committee\r\nto take the necessary steps for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, an election was held on the 15th day of December,\r\n1855, in compliance with the proclamation issued by the executive\r\ncommittee who then issued a proclamation reciting the results of\r\nthe election of the 15th of December, and at the same time provided\r\nfor an election, to be held on the 11th day of January, 1856, for\r\nstate officers and members of the general assembly of the State of\r\nKansas.  The election was accordingly held in several election\r\nprecincts, the returns of which were sent to the executive committee\r\nwho announced the result by a proclamation.\r\n\r\nThus, when we arrived in Kansas, two rival governments were in\r\nexistence, one the result of fraud and force, the other confessedly\r\nincomplete, being without executive power or recognition.  Congress\r\nalone could settle the controversy by recognizing one or the other.\r\nIts action and its failure to act will be stated further on.\r\n\r\nA brief narrative of incidents while the committee was in Kansas\r\nmay be of interest.\r\n\r\nWe arrived by steamer at a place called Westport Landing, near the\r\nmouth of the Kansas River.  As I remember the place it was a mere\r\nhamlet, composed of three dwellings, a store, a tavern, and a\r\nblacksmith shop.  We passed over the high rolling prairie, where\r\nbut a few and scattered cabins then existed, but which is now the\r\nsite of Kansas City, a beautiful city of 90,000 inhabitants.  About\r\nsix miles from the landing we entered Westport, the headquarters\r\nof the Santa Fé trade.  This important trade in 1854 was conducted\r\nwith \"prairie schooners,\" wagons of great dimensions rudely but\r\nstrongly built, each hauled by four or six mules or Indian ponies,\r\nand all driven by as rough a set of men of mixed color, tribe and\r\nnativity as could be found anywhere in the world.  Their usual\r\ndress was a broad brimmed felt hat, a flannel shirt, home-spun\r\ntrousers, without suspenders, and heavy cowhide boots outside of\r\ntheir trousers, with a knife or pistols, or both, in their belts\r\nor boots.  They were properly classed as border ruffians, and as\r\na rule were whisky soaked.\r\n\r\nThe contrast of this region between then and now is a marked evidence\r\nof the wonderful change that has been made within a single generation.\r\nI have several times visited Kansas City and its environs since\r\n1856.  I have noted the change at each visit!  The rolling prairie\r\nhas been checkered with streets and avenues, and the squares and\r\nsuburbs are dotted all over with residences, stores and workshops.\r\nThe landing, once a single pier, now extends miles along the Missouri\r\nRiver.  The border ruffians have disappeared with the Indians and\r\n\"greasers,\" and have been replaced by an active, intelligent and\r\nprosperous community.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sherman and myself started in advance for Lawrence in an open\r\nbuggy drawn by one horse, and were told to follow the trail, and\r\nthis we had no difficulty in doing.  We passed through one or more\r\nIndian reservations, over as beautiful a country as the sun shines\r\nupon, but without house or habitation, except Indian huts.  We\r\narrived at Lawrence, a town less than two years old, and were\r\ncordially received.  The people there were fearing a raid by the\r\n\"border ruffians,\" but this was fortunately postponed until our\r\ndeparture for Leavenworth.\r\n\r\nThe committee proceeded immediately to take testimony.  Governor\r\nReeder acted in behalf of the Free State side, and General Whitfield\r\nin behalf of the pro-slavery side, this being the conceded line of\r\ndemarcation between the opposing factions.  The town was in embryo,\r\nnothing finished, and my wife and I were glad to have a cot in a\r\nroom in the unfinished and unoccupied \"Free State Hotel,\" soon\r\nafter burned to the ground by Jones, the marshal of Kansas, or his\r\ndeputies.  There was no difficulty in obtaining witnesses or\r\ntestimony, but, as a rule, the witnesses on one side would only\r\ntestify in Lawrence, and those on the other in Lecompton or\r\nLeavenworth.  They were like soldiers in hostile armies, careful\r\nto keep outside of the enemy's camp.\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson, afterwards Governor Robinson, was then by far the\r\nablest and bravest leader of the Free State cause.  His history of\r\nthe Kansas conflict is the most interesting yet published.  When\r\nthe committee visited Lecompton to take testimony, it was a surprise\r\nto us that he not only offered, but insisted upon going to that\r\nplace, the headquarters and capital of the pro-slavery party.  It\r\nwas then scarcely a hamlet, and its existence depended entirely\r\nupon the success of that party.  Dr. Robinson and I rode together\r\ninto the place.  It was easy to see that he was not a welcome\r\nvisitor.  Everyone but the committee carried arms.  Several murders\r\nand affrays had recently occurred, in regard to which we had taken\r\nevidence.  Here we had access to the poll-books of the contested\r\nelections, and met on friendly terms with the officers of the\r\nterritory, the chief of whom were Judge Lecompte, chief justice of\r\nthe territory, after whom the town had been named, and Jones, the\r\nmarshal of the United States.  Governor Shannon was, I think, also\r\nthere for a time.  The quarters for lodging were even more limited\r\nhere than in Lawrence.  I slept in a cot side by side with the one\r\noccupied by Judge Lecompte, who, though a terror to the Free State\r\nmen, seemed to me to be a good humored gentleman, more violent in\r\nhis words than in his acts.  We had no unpleasant incident while\r\nthere, though such had been prophesied at Lawrence.\r\n\r\nFrom Lecompton the committee went to Topeka, then quite a small\r\nvillage, now a city of 33,000 inhabitants.  It was already ambitious\r\nto become the Free State capital of Kansas, by reason of its central\r\nposition.  There was then no settlement of any importance west of\r\nTopeka.  Some testimony was taken, but we soon returned to Lawrence,\r\nand from thence went to Leavenworth.  A large part of the distance\r\nbetween these places was an Indian reservation.  Mrs. Sherman and\r\nI rode over it in a buggy, and found no white man's habitation on\r\nthe way.  Its great value and fertility was easily perceived, and\r\nit is now well settled by an active and prosperous population of\r\nwhite men.  On the road we met an Indian seated near his wigwam,\r\nwith a gun in his hand, and for a moment I feared he might use it.\r\nHe uttered some Indian gibberish, which we construed as an invitation\r\nto enter his hut.  We tied our horse, entered, and found no one\r\nthere but an old squaw.  I gave the Indian some silver which he\r\ngreedily took, but indicated by his motions that he wanted a drink\r\nof whisky, but this I was not able to give him.\r\n\r\nLeavenworth was a new town near Fort Leavenworth, the then western\r\nmilitary post of the army of the United States.  We placed ourselves\r\nin communication with Colonel Sumner, then in command, but we had\r\nno occasion to summon his official aid, though authorized by the\r\nresolutions under which we were acting to call for such assistance\r\nfrom any military force which was at the time convenient to us.\r\nHowever, our meetings there were more disturbed than at any other\r\nplace.  The trouble commenced at Lawrence shortly after our arrival\r\nat Leavenworth.  A company of about 700 armed men, the great body\r\nof whom were not citizens of the territory, were marched into the\r\ntown of Lawrence under Marshal Donaldson and Sheriff Jones, officers\r\nclaiming to act under the law, and they then bombarded and burned\r\nto the ground a valuable hotel and one private house, and destroying\r\ntwo printing presses and material.  The posse, being released by\r\nthe officers, proceeded to sack, pillage, and rob houses, stores,\r\ntrunks, even taking the clothing of women and children.  The people\r\nof Leavenworth were much alarmed, as threats were made to clean\r\nout the \"Black Republican Committee\" at Leavenworth.  No attempt\r\nof that kind was made.  Later on, Dr. Robinson was arrested on a\r\nsteamboat on the way with his wife to St. Louis.  We had confided\r\nto him a copy of the testimony taken, to be delivered to Mr. Banks,\r\nspeaker of the House.  We believe that a knowledge of that fact\r\ncaused the arrest, but, fortunately, Mrs. Robinson, who had the\r\ntestimony safely secured in her clothing, was allowed to proceed\r\nto Washington.  Dr. Robinson was taken back to Leavenworth and\r\nplaced in prison, where I called upon him, but was rudely threatened,\r\nand was only allowed to speak to him in the presence of the jailer.\r\n\r\nWe were frequently threatened through anonymous letters.  On one\r\noccasion, upon going in the morning to the committee room, I found\r\ntacked upon the door a notice to the \"Black Republican Committee\"\r\nto leave Kansas \"upon penalty of death.\"  I cut it from the door\r\nand called upon a bystander to testify to the contents and the\r\nplace from which it was taken.\r\n\r\nOn one Sunday morning, while sitting in my lodging, a very rough\r\nlooking man entered, and I indicated to Mr. W. Blair Lord, our\r\nstenographer, to take down what was said.  With many oaths and\r\nimprecations he told us that he had been robbed by ruffians of his\r\nhorses and wagon a few miles from Leavenworth; that he had offered\r\nto fight them, but they were cowards; that he was born in Richland\r\ncounty, Ohio, near Mansfield, and he wanted me to help him get his\r\ntraps.  I knew his family as famous fighters.  I asked him if he\r\nwould swear to his story.  He said he would, and Mr. Lord read it\r\nto him, oaths and all, from his stenographic notes.  He stared at\r\nLord and demanded \"Where in hell did you get that?\"  He was handed\r\nthe stenographic notes and, after looking at them, he exclaimed:\r\n\"Snakes, by God; but it is all true!\"  Whether he got his outfit\r\nand traps I never knew.\r\n\r\nThe evidence at Leavenworth being closed the committee returned to\r\nWestport, Missouri.  While we were there we saw an armed and\r\norganized body of residents of Missouri march across the line into\r\nKansas to retaliate, as we were told, the murder of five pro-slavery\r\nmen at Osawatamie.  While they were marching into Westport from\r\nthe east, Governor Shannon, in obedience to the summons of the\r\ncommittee, came into Westport from the territory, and in his presence\r\nthey filed off in regular array into the territory.  It was difficult\r\nto ascertain the precise causes of these murders, but it was shown\r\nthat they were in retaliation for those of certain Free State men,\r\none of whom was the son of John Brown, later the famous leader of\r\nthe attack on the fort at Harper's Ferry, and who had acted for\r\nthe committee in summoning witnesses to Lawrence.  The testimony\r\nin respect to these murders was vague, and the murderers were not\r\nidentified.  Two years afterwards I met John Brown in Chicago, and\r\nasked him about the murder of the pro-slavery men at Osawatamie;\r\nhe replied with spirit that they were not murdered, but that they\r\nhad been arrested, tried by a jury, convicted and executed.  The\r\narrest, trial and execution must have been done during one night.\r\nHe did not disclose the names of the executioners, but his cool\r\nstatement was a striking picture of the scenes then enacted in\r\nKansas by both sides; both appealed to the law of force and crime,\r\nand crime was justified by crime.\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken at Westport closed the investigation and Mr.\r\nHoward and I returned to Detroit, as already stated.\r\n\r\nThe report was approved by Mr. Howard, and presented by him to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, July 1, 1856, as a question of privilege.\r\nThe reception of it gave rise to much debate, but in the end I was\r\npermitted on the same day to read it.  The minority report of Mr.\r\nOliver was presented July 11 of that year.  No action was taken on\r\nthe reports, but they were widely published.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 1856, I made a speech on the Kansas contested election\r\nbetween General Whitfield and Governor Reeder, during which I was\r\ndrawn into a discussion with Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia,\r\nand Mr. Oliver, of Missouri, in which the general questions involved\r\nin the Kansas controversy were fully debated.  I closed with this\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n\"The worst evil that could befall our country is civil war, but\r\nthe outrages in Kansas cannot be continued much longer without\r\nproducing it.  To our southern brethren I especially appeal.  In\r\nthe name of southern rights, crimes have been committed, and are\r\nbeing committed, which I know you cannot and do not approve.  These\r\nhave excited a feeling in the northern states that is deepening\r\nand strengthening daily.  It may produce acts of retaliation.  You\r\nare in a minority and, from the nature of your institutions, your\r\nrelative power is yearly decreasing.  In excusing this invasion\r\nfrom Missouri--in attempting to hold on to an advantage obtained\r\nby force and fraud--you are setting an example which, in its\r\nultimate consequences, may trample your rights under foot.  Until\r\nthese wrongs are righted, you must expect northern men to unite to\r\nredress them.  It may not be this year, but, as sure as there is\r\na God in heaven, such a union will be effected; and you will gain\r\nnothing by sustaining northern agitators in violating the compromise\r\nof your fathers.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1856, I offered, as an amendment to the army appropriation\r\nbill, the following proviso:\r\n\r\n\"_Provided, nevertheless_, That no part of a military force of the\r\nUnited States herein provided for, shall be employed in aid of the\r\nenforcement of the enactments of the alleged legislative assembly\r\nof the Territory of Kansas, recently assembled at Shawnee Mission,\r\nuntil Congress shall have enacted either that it was or was not a\r\nvalid legislative assembly, chosen in conformity with the organic\r\nlaw, by the people of said territory.  And _Provided_, That until\r\nCongress shall have passed on the validity of the said legislative\r\nassembly of Kansas, it shall be the duty of the President to use\r\nthe military force in said territory to preserve the peace, suppress\r\ninsurrection, repel invasion, and protect persons and property\r\ntherein, and upon the national highways in the State of Missouri,\r\nfrom unlawful seizures and searches.  And _be it further provided_,\r\nThat the President is required to disarm the present organized\r\nmilitia of the Territory of Kansas and recall all the United States\r\narms therein distributed, and to prevent armed men from going into\r\nsaid territory to disturb the public peace, or aid in the enforcement\r\nor resistance of real or pretended laws.\"\r\n\r\nAfter long debate, this was agreed to by a vote of 80 yeas to 47\r\nnays.  The deliberate purpose of a majority of the House was to\r\nprevent any further support of the Lecompton territorial legislature.\r\nThis amendment, however, was disagreed to by the Senate and referred\r\nto a committee of conference.  On the 18th of August, the last day\r\nof the session, the disagreement continued and the conference report\r\nwas taken up for action.  A motion was made that the House insist\r\nupon its amendments and agree to another committee of conference.\r\nThis was defeated, but no definite action was taken, as a majority\r\nof the House was opposed to a further conference, and so the army\r\nbill failed.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the President, by proclamation, convened the two\r\nHouses in extra session to meet on the 21st day of August, three\r\ndays later.  The President, in his message, urged Congress to recede\r\nfrom the Kansas proviso in the army bill.  The Republicans of the\r\nHouse were determined to insist upon that proviso, and, by repeated\r\nvotes, refused to withdraw it or to reconsider it, but, after a\r\nsession of nine days, the House finally yielded, but only after\r\nthe Senate had agreed to an amendment, which contained the substance\r\nof the proviso offered by me, as follows;\r\n\r\n\"_Provided_, That no part of the military force of the United\r\nStates, for the support of which appropriations are made by this\r\nact, shall be employed in aid of the enforcement of any enactment\r\nheretofore passed by the bodies claiming to be the territorial\r\nlegislature of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was agreed to and thus, in the final struggle, while\r\nno effective measures to relieve the people of Kansas from the\r\ntyranny imposed upon them were adopted, the declaration was made\r\nthat the military force of the United States should not be used to\r\naid in the enforcement of any enactment theretofore passed by bodies\r\nclaiming to be the territorial legislature of Kansas.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that during this long and wearisome session (for\r\nin fact the two were but one), I was almost exclusively occupied\r\nin a futile effort to restore the prohibition of slavery in Kansas,\r\naccording to the Missouri Compromise, but the struggle made was\r\nfruitful in good.  It strengthened the Free State sentiment in\r\nKansas, it aroused public sentiment in the north, and drove the\r\nsouth to adopt new and strange theories which led to divisions in\r\nthe Democratic party and its disruption and overthrow in 1860.\r\nThe compromise made was understood to be the work of Mr. Seward,\r\nand, though not satisfactory to the Republicans of the House, it\r\nwas at least a drawn battle, and, like Bunker Hill to Yorktown,\r\nwas the prelude to the Revolution that ended at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nAmong the many who attained distinction in the 34th Congress I can\r\nonly refer to a few, the chief of whom was Nathaniel P. Banks, who,\r\nafter a long struggle, was elected speaker.  He was born in Waltham,\r\nMassachusetts, January 30, 1816.  He had risen into prominence\r\nwithout any aid or advantage of early education or training.  He\r\nwas the son of an overseer in a cotton factory at Waltham, where\r\nhe was for a time employed.  He improved his leisure hours by the\r\nstudy of history, political economy and the science of government.\r\nHe learned the trade of a machinist.  He early acquired the habit\r\nof speaking well on various subjects, and was elected as a Democratic\r\nmember of the legislature from his native town.  In 1852 he was\r\nelected to Congress, running upon the ticket with General Pierce,\r\nthe Democratic candidate for President.  He took a decided stand\r\nagainst the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.  He was a man of\r\nstriking presence, with a fine voice and engaging manners.  He\r\nfilled the difficult position of speaker with great credit, and is\r\nstill remembered by his associates as perhaps the best fitted for\r\nthe special duties of speaker of the House of any Member since the\r\ntime of Henry Clay.  He was afterward elected Governor of Massachusetts\r\nand continued in that position for several years.  When the war\r\nbroke out he was appointed major-general of volunteers, but his\r\nservice in the army was not marked.  After the war was over he was\r\nre-elected to Congress, but seemed to have lost his power and\r\ninfluence.  In later years his memory was impaired and he \"lagged\r\nsuperfluous on the stage.\"  He died September 1, 1894.\r\n\r\nLewis D. Campbell, of Ohio, was elected to Congress in 1848 as a\r\nWhig, and re-elected to each successive Congress down to 1856, when\r\nhis seat was contested and the House of Representatives decided\r\nagainst him.  He and Banks were the leading candidates for the\r\nspeakership of the 34th Congress, but the majority of the anti-\r\nNebraska Members voted for Banks, and upon his election Campbell\r\nwas made chairman of the committee of ways and means, and had\r\nsubstantial control of the business of that Congress.  He never\r\nwas in hearty sympathy with the Republican party.  He was subsequently\r\nelected to the 42nd Congress in 1870 as a Democrat, but had lost,\r\nin a great measure, his influence.  He served for a time as colonel\r\nof a regiment in the war.  He was a man of marked ability but was\r\ntoo erratic to be a successful leader in any cause or party.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, at the early age of twenty-seven, Galusha A. Grow was\r\nelected a Representative in Congress from Pennsylvania.  He was an\r\nactive and very useful Member.  He took strong ground against the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise, and in 1859 was a competitor\r\nwith me for the position of speaker, but withdrew in my favor after\r\nthe first ballot.  In the following Congress he was chosen speaker\r\nand rendered very valuable service as such.  After a continuous\r\nservice in Congress for fourteen years, he retired from active\r\npolitical life and engaged in important business enterprises, but\r\nalways took an interest in political affairs.  He was elected by\r\nan overwhelming majority as a Member of the 53rd Congress at large\r\nfrom his state.\r\n\r\nSchuyler Colfax was a conspicuous Member of Congress from 1855\r\nuntil he was nominated for the office of Vice President, in 1868,\r\non the ticket with General Grant.  During this long period he\r\nrepresented one district, and served for six years as speaker.  He\r\nwas a very industrious, active Member.  As we were of about the\r\nsame age, and our lives ran in parallel lines, we were often thrown\r\ntogether.  We and our families in Washington messed together in a\r\nhousehold for several years, and our intercourse was always friendly\r\nand intimate.  When he became Vice President he remarked to me that\r\nI was first to enter the Senate, but he was first to become Vice\r\nPresident.  After his service as Vice President, he retired from\r\npublic life and delivered lectures upon many topics.\r\n\r\nMany other Members of Congress, equally worthy of note, have passed\r\naway from the scenes of life, and some few survive.  I would gladly\r\nrecall their memory if my space would allow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nBIRTH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\nThe Name Formally Adopted at Jackson, Michigan, in 1854--Nomination\r\nof John C. Fremont at Philadelphia--Democratic Convention Nominates\r\nJames Buchanan--Effect of the Latter's Election on the North--My\r\nViews Concerning President Pierce and His Administration--French\r\nSpoilation Claims--First Year of Buchanan's Administration--Dred\r\nScott Case Decision by Supreme Court--The Slavery Question Once\r\nMore an Issue in Congress--Douglas' Opposition to the Lecompton\r\nScheme--Turning Point of the Slavery Controversy.\r\n\r\nDuring the first session of the 34th Congress, the opponents of\r\nslavery were without a party name or organization.  They agreed\r\nonly in the one demand, that slavery should not be established in\r\nKansas.  On other questions they voted on old party lines.  The\r\nMembers elected in 1854 in the northern states were Democrats,\r\nWhigs or Free Soilers.  Many of the Democrats still supported the\r\nadministration of President Pierce, and acquiesced in the doctrine\r\nof popular sovereignty in the territories.  A few of the Whigs, of\r\nconservative leanings, acted with the Americans, or \"Know-Nothings,\"\r\nof the south.  A strong popular movement was initiated in some of\r\nthe western states as early as 1854 in favor of a new party.  This\r\nwas especially the case in Wisconsin and Michigan.  On the 6th of\r\nJuly, 1854, a popular convention was held at Jackson, Michigan,\r\ncomposed of hundreds of men of all parties, who denounced slavery\r\nas a great moral, social and political evil, and resolved that,\r\npostponing and suspending all differences with regard to political\r\neconomy or administrative policy, they would act cordially and\r\nfaithfully in unison to oppose the extension of slavery, and be\r\nknown as Republicans until the contest was terminated.  This name\r\nwas assumed in other states of the north.\r\n\r\nThe state convention held in Ohio on July 13, 1855, formally declared\r\nitself a convention of the Republican party.  The long struggle in\r\nKansas, the elections in 1855, and the contest for the speakership\r\nof the House, added strength to this movement, and the name\r\n\"Republican\" was formally given to the new party by the national\r\nconvention held at Philadelphia, June 17, 1856, as the best expression\r\nof its views and principles.\r\n\r\nIt appeared for the time that the new party would carry the country\r\nin a blaze of enthusiasm.  And, looking over the past, I am clearly\r\nof the opinion that this would have been the result but for the\r\nfaulty nomination of Colonel John C. Fremont as the Republican\r\ncandidate for President, and the sagacious nomination of James\r\nBuchanan as the Democratic candidate.  The Republican party, still\r\ncomposed of uncertain elements, sought only for a candidate that\r\nwas available.  Seward or Chase was the natural candidate.  They\r\nwere fully identified with the principles and purposes of their\r\nparty.  They were men of marked ability, strong in their respective\r\nstates, each elected governor of his state and sure of its support,\r\nbut Chase was opposed on account of his advanced opinions on the\r\nslavery question, and Seward was actively opposed by the so-called\r\nAmerican party, for his open hostility to its principles and policy.\r\nAll these sought for a new man, and public opinion gradually, but\r\nstrongly, turned to John C. Fremont.  He had no experience in public\r\nlife, but he attracted attention by his bold explorations in the\r\nwest and, especially, by his marching to California, and occupation\r\nof this Mexican territory.  A strong effort was made to secure the\r\nnomination of Justice McLean of the United States Supreme Court.\r\nHe had been long in public life, had been a cabinet officer in two\r\nadministrations, had been appointed to the supreme bench by Jackson,\r\nhad held this position for twenty-six years, and was a man of\r\nspotless integrity.  His nomination was strongly urged by conservative\r\nRepublicans in all the northern states, and by the delegates from\r\nPennsylvania, especially by Thaddeus Stevens, who asserted that the\r\nnomination of Fremont would not only lose the State of Pennsylvania,\r\nto the Republicans, but that the party would be defeated at the\r\npresidential election.  But the current of opinion in the west, in\r\nNew England and New York, was too strong in favor of Fremont, and\r\nhe was nominated.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic national convention met at Cincinnati, June 2, 1856,\r\nfor the nomination of candidates for President and Vice President.\r\nPopular feeling was then strongly aroused against that party by\r\nthe assault of Brooks on Sumner, the removal of Reeder, the\r\nappointment of Shannon, the crimes in Kansas, and the recent sacking\r\nof Lawrence.  A large proportion of northern Democrats, who still\r\nadhered to their party, were restless under the violence of their\r\nsouthern associates.  It was this feeling, no doubt recognized by\r\nboth northern and southern Democrats, that prevented the nomination\r\nof either Pierce or Douglas.  Buchanan was regarded as a conservative\r\nman of great experience, who, being absent from the country during\r\nthe entire period of the Kansas contest, would, it was believed,\r\nand as his supporters affirmed, pursue a quieting policy that would\r\narrest and prevent further outrages and would secure fair elections\r\nin that territory.  He was popular in Pennsylvania, had served for\r\nmany years in each House of Congress, had creditably represented\r\nthe United States as minister to Russia and Great Britain, had been\r\nSecretary of State and the head of the cabinet of President Polk.\r\nHe was unanimously supported by the delegation from Pennsylvania,\r\nthen a doubtful state, and, after many ballots and the defeat of\r\nPierce, was nominated with the acquiescence of Douglas.  This\r\nnomination greatly strengthened the Democratic party.  It held in\r\nthat party the protection Democrats, and a large proportion of\r\nthose who in 1854 voted for anti-Nebraska Members of Congress.\r\nThe appointment of Colonel Geary of Pennsylvania as Governor of\r\nKansas, in the place of Governor Shannon, and his firm and impartial\r\nadministration, greatly aided the Democratic party.  It was regarded\r\nas evidence of a change of policy in Kansas, made at the request\r\nof Mr. Buchanan.\r\n\r\nThe American party met at the city of Philadelphia soon after the\r\nelection of Banks as speaker, and nominated Millard Fillmore for\r\nPresident and Donelson for Vice President.  This movement did not\r\nat first excite much attention, as it was known in the north it\r\nwould draw equally from the two great parties, and in the south\r\ncould only affect injuriously the Democratic party.  Its platform\r\nof principles was condemned by both the Republican and Democratic\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nMr. Fillmore took strong ground against what he called a sectional\r\nticket presenting both candidates from the free states, with the\r\navowed purpose of one part of the Union ruling over the whole United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Fremont, however, greatly strengthened the movement\r\nin favor of Fillmore.  There was a large element of the old Whig\r\nparty in the north, which, though friendly to Republican principles\r\nand willing to support Seward or McLean, yet would not vote for\r\nFremont, who had none of the qualities that commanded their respect.\r\nSuch men as Ewing, Everett, Winthrop and Hilliard, conspicuous\r\nleaders and eminent statesmen, announced their purpose to vote for\r\nFillmore.  Mr. Choate, the eminent lawyer and statesman of\r\nMassachusetts, declared his purpose to vote for Buchanan, upon the\r\nplausible ground that, as the choice was between Buchanan and\r\nFremont, he was compelled, by a sense of duty, to vote for Buchanan.\r\n\r\nAt the same time leading Democrats in the south declared that if\r\nFremont was elected the Union could not and ought not to be preserved.\r\nThe Whigs of the south, with scarce an exception, were committed\r\nto the support of Fillmore and Donelson, and joined in an outcry\r\nof danger to the Union.\r\n\r\nAs the canvass progressed this feeling increased, and before its\r\nclose it became apparent that some of the older and more populous\r\nRepublican states would be lost by the Republican party.  I shared\r\nin this feeling of distrust of Fremont, but gave him my support.\r\n\r\nI was nominated without any opposition for re-election to Congress\r\nby a convention held at Shelby on the 12th day of August, 1856,\r\nand was elected in October by a majority of 2,861.\r\n\r\nI took an active part in the canvass, after the adjournment of\r\nCongress, mainly in southern Ohio, where it was apparent that the\r\nnomination of Buchanan was popular.  In Pennsylvania, especially\r\nin Philadelphia, the cry was for \"Buck, Breck and free Kansas.\"\r\nJohn G. Forney, the chairman of the Democratic state committee,\r\npromised that if Buchanan was elected there would be no interference\r\nwith the efforts of the people of Kansas to make that territory a\r\nfree state.  The result of the canvass was that Buchanan carried\r\nthe states of Pennsylvnia, New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois and\r\nCalifornia at the November election and was elected.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the past it is apparent that the election of Buchanan\r\nwas necessary to convince the people of the north that no successful\r\nopposition to the extension of slavery could be made except by a\r\nparty distinctly pledged to that policy.  Mr. Buchanan encountered\r\ndifficulties which no human wisdom could overcome.  Whatever may\r\nhave been his desire he was compelled, by the prevailing sentiment\r\nin his party, to adopt measures that made a conflict between the\r\nsections inevitable.  The election of Fremont would probably have\r\nprecipitated this conflict before the north was ripe for it.  His\r\nconduct during the early period of the war proves that he would\r\nhave been unequal to such an emergency.  His defeat was the\r\npostponement of the irrepressible conflict until it became apparent\r\nto all that our country must be all free or all slave territory.\r\nThis was the lesson taught by the administration of Buchanan, and\r\nLincoln was best fitted to carry it into execution.\r\n\r\nPierce was still President, but after his defeat for the nomination\r\nhe changed his policy materially.  Events were allowed to develop\r\nin Kansas with a growing tendency in favor of the Free State party.\r\nJudge Lecompte was removed from an office the duties of which he\r\nwas totally unfit to perform.  A large number of emigrants from\r\nmany of the northern states were preparing to move in the spring\r\nto Kansas.  Governor Geary of that territory, who had taken a\r\ndecided stand in favor of equal and exact justice to all men, was\r\nmet by opposition from the pro-slavery faction.  His life was\r\nthreatened and strong demands were made for his removal.  He became\r\nsatisfied that he would not be sustained by the administration,\r\nand on the 4th of March, 1857, resigned his position.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the assembling of Congress in December, 1856, and\r\nbefore the usual message had been sent to the President, notifying\r\nhim that the House of Representatives was prepared to enter upon\r\nthe duties of the session, a contest sprang up over the question\r\nof administering the oath of office to Mr. Whitfield as a delegate\r\nfrom the Territory of Kansas, and a struggle resulted which continued\r\nuntil the 9th of December, when the oath of office was administered\r\nto him and he took his seat.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce sent to the House of Representatives, December 2,\r\n1856, his last message.  He commenced it with a careful review of\r\nthe Kansas question and this led to a debate which continued during\r\nthe entire session.  On the 8th of December I undertook to answer\r\nas much of the message as related to the slavery question.  He had,\r\nin the message, defended the repeal of the restriction of slavery\r\ncontained in the Missouri Compromise, asserting that this compromise\r\nwas unconstitutional and abortive, but I showed that it had been\r\nrecognized as in full force by every administration since and\r\nincluding that of Monroe, that it did not extend to the territory\r\nacquired from Mexico, and that it was consistent with the compromise\r\nacts of 1850.  He asserted that the purpose was not only to exclude\r\nslavery from Kansas, but also from places where it then existed.\r\nI showed this to be inaccurate by the express denial of such purpose\r\nin every platform of the Republican party.  I then declared that\r\n\"If I had my voice, I would not have one single political Abolitionist\r\nin the northern states.  I am opposed to any interference by the\r\nnorthern people with slavery in the slave states; I act with the\r\nRepublican party, with hundreds of thousands of others, simply\r\nbecause the Republican party resists the extension, but does not\r\nseek the abolition, of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nMy speech, as reported, expresses, as I believe, the limit and\r\nextent of the aims of the Republican party at that time.  The only\r\nregret I feel is that the tone and temper of my remarks were not\r\nsuch as should be addressed to the President of the United States\r\nby a Member of Congress.\r\n\r\nWhat I say of myself can be truthfully said of many other Members.\r\nThe feeling against the President was embittered by the firm stand\r\ntaken by him in support of a policy which we regarded as unpatriotic,\r\nand dangerous in the highest degree to the public peace and the\r\nnational Union.  In his last message he defended or excused the\r\nlawless efforts made by residents of Missouri to establish slavery\r\nin Kansas.  He made no effort to prevent the invasion of Kansas or\r\nthe crimes committed against its citizens.  He appointed many\r\ngovernors for this territory, and in every instance where they\r\nsought to protect the rights of its people, he either removed them\r\nor denied them his support.  This was the case with Reeder and\r\nShannon.  Even Governor Geary, whom he praised in his message, and\r\nwhom Buchanan had lauded during the canvass, was abandoned by both,\r\nand compelled to resign because he sought to protect all citizens\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce was properly, according to usage, a candidate for\r\nre-election when the convention met to nominate his successor, but\r\nhe was defeated by Buchanan.  Mr. Douglas, the chief instrument in\r\nthe passage of the Nebraska bill, met a like fate.  Buchanan was\r\nsaved only by the popular cry of \"Buchanan, Breckenridge and Free\r\nKansas,\" and the confident belief, founded upon his declaration,\r\nthat his election would secure freedom to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe political excitement existing during the whole of President\r\nPierce's term entered into social life in Washington.  The President\r\nwas not brought into contact with those who differed with him in\r\nopinion.  His family afflictions were, no doubt, the partial cause\r\nof this.  The sincere friendship that often exists between political\r\nadversaries in public life were not possible during this period.\r\nSocial lines were drawn on sectional lines, and in the north party\r\nlines became hostile lines.  Such causes, no doubt, led to unjust\r\ncriticism of the President, and, in turn, caused him to regard his\r\npolitical adversaries as enemies to their country and disturbers\r\nof the public peace.  I scarcely remember seeing him during this\r\nCongress, and was strongly prejudiced against him.  A more careful\r\nstudy of the motives and conduct of public men during this period\r\nhas changed my opinion of many of them, and, especially, of President\r\nPierce.  That he was a genial, social and agreeable companion is\r\naffirmed by all who were familiar with him.  That his opinions were\r\nhonestly entertained, and firmly supported, is shown by his adherence\r\nto them without change or shadow of turning.  In this respect he\r\ncompares favorable with many leading men of his party, who stifled\r\ntheir opinions to meet the currents of the day.  He had been a\r\ngeneral of distinction in the Mexican War and a Member of both the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives.  He was a leading lawyer in\r\nhis state.  His messages to Congress, considered in a literary\r\nview, were able state papers, clearly and strongly expressed.  It\r\nwas his great misfortune to have to deal with a controversy that\r\nhe did not commence, but he did not shrink from the responsibility.\r\nHe believed in the policy of non-intervention in the territories,\r\nand so did not prevent the \"border ruffians\" of Missouri crossing\r\nthe line and voting at every election in Kansas, setting up a bogus\r\nlegislature, adopting the laws of Missouri as the laws of Kansas,\r\nand establishing negro slavery in that territory.  Fortunately a\r\nmore numerous, courageous and intelligent population reversed all\r\nthis, and led, not only to the exclusion of slavery in Kansas, but\r\nalso to its abolition in the United States.\r\n\r\nWith the kindly biography of President Pierce, written by his\r\nfriend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, before me, I can appreciate his ability,\r\nintegrity and agreeable social qualities, and only regret that he\r\nwas President of the United States at a time when the sagacity of\r\na Jefferson, the determined courage of a Jackson, or the shrewdness\r\nand wisdom of a Lincoln, were needed to meet the difficulties and\r\ndangers which he had to encounter.\r\n\r\nThere is but one more personal incident of the 34th Congress I care\r\nto mention.  Mr. Banks designated me as a member of the committee\r\non foreign affairs.  Mr. Alexander C. M. Pennington, as chairman\r\nof that committee, handed me the voluminous papers in reference to\r\nthe French Spoilation Claims.  They covered an interesting period\r\nof American history, embracing all that between 1793 and 1801, in\r\nwhich were involved important negotiations both in England and\r\nFrance, and outrages committed upon our, then, infant government\r\nby the government of France and Great Britain.  I had all the\r\nfeeling of natural indignation against those great powers who sought\r\nto draw the United States into their controversies, and practice\r\nupon us enormities and outrages that we would not submit to for a\r\nmoment in our day.  Yet, after a full and careful examination of\r\nall the papers in the case, I became thoroughly satisfied that\r\nthese claimants, whatever might be said as to their claims against\r\nthe French government, had absolutely no foundation for a claim\r\nagainst the United States.\r\n\r\nI wrote an adverse report, but it was suppressed in the committee.\r\nBills for the payment of these claims were presented from time to\r\ntime.  In 1870 Senator Sumner reported favorably to the Senate a\r\nbill for the purpose from the committee on foreign relations.  It\r\nwas opposed by Senator Thurman and myself and again laid aside.\r\nOn the 14th of December, 1882, the bill was again pressed, the\r\ndebate which ensued clearly showing that the United States pressed\r\nthese claims against France to the verge of war.\r\n\r\nThe whole case is this:  Certain depredations were committed by\r\nthe French government and by the citizens of France, upon the\r\ncitizens of the United States, previous to the beginning of the\r\npresent century.  The government of the United States did all it\r\ncould to secure payment and compensation to its citizens for these\r\ndepredations.  The French government denied the validity of the\r\nclaims, holding, on the other hand, that the government of the\r\nUnited States had violated the treaties made with it under\r\ncircumstances of sacred obligation, that its citizens therefore\r\nwere justified in doing what they had done in seizing upon American\r\nvessels, and taking from them goods called contraband of war, and\r\nin committing these depredations.  It uniformly justified and\r\nmaintained the action of its cruisers in doing these things.  In\r\nother words, our claims were repudiated by France, their payment\r\nbeing refused, and, as we could not force their payment, we simply\r\nabandoned them.  Recently they have been referred to the court of\r\nclaims, without regard to the lapse of time, and large sums of\r\nmoney are now being paid by the United States for the depredations\r\ncommitted by the French nearly one hundred years ago, to descendants,\r\nthree generations removed, of merchants and ship owners, who, with\r\nall their losses, enjoyed the most profitable commerce in the\r\nhistory of our mercantile marine.  Their payment is, perhaps, the\r\nmost striking evidence of the improvidence of Congress in dealing\r\nwith antiquated claims against the government.\r\n\r\nThe first year of Buchanan's administration, 1857, will always be\r\nnoted as one of great political excitement, of sudden changes and\r\nunexpected results.  At its beginning the Democratic party was in\r\ncomplete possession of all branches of the government.  The House\r\nof Representatives, elected in the fall of 1856, had a strong\r\nDemocratic majority.  The Senate was composed of 37 Democrats, 20\r\nRepublicans and 4 Americans.  The Supreme Court was composed of 5\r\nDemocrats from the slave states, and 2 Democrats and 2 Whigs from\r\nthe free states.  The cabinet of Buchanan had four members from\r\nthe southern states and three from the northern.  The south had\r\nfull control of all departments of the government, with the President\r\nin hearty sympathy with the policy of that section.  The condition\r\nof Kansas alone caused it trouble.  The firm and impartial course\r\nof Governor Geary had imparted confidence and strength to the Free\r\nState citizens of that territory, who were now in an unquestioned\r\nmajority through the large emigration from the north during the\r\nspring of 1857.  The doctrine of popular sovereignty could not,\r\ntherefore, be relied upon to establish slavery in Kansas, and it\r\nwas abandoned.  New theories had to be improvised and new agencies\r\ncalled into action.\r\n\r\nI was present when the oath of office was administered to Mr.\r\nBuchanan, on the 4th of March, 1857.  With my strong sympathy for\r\nthe Free State people of Kansas, I hoped and believed that he would\r\ngive some assurance that the pledges made for him in the canvass\r\nwould be carried out, but the statement in his inaugural address,\r\nthat the difference of opinion in respect to the power of the people\r\nof a territory to decide the question of slavery for themselves\r\nwould be speedily and finally settled, as a judicial question, by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, in a case then pending\r\nbefore it, naturally, excited suspicion and distrust.  It was\r\nregarded as a change of position, a new device in the interest of\r\nslavery.  In two days after the inauguration, Chief Justice Taney\r\ndelivered the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case,\r\nas to the status of negroes in the United States.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"They had, for more than a century before, been regarded as beings\r\nof an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the\r\nwhite race, either in social or political relations; and so far\r\ninferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to\r\nrespect, and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced\r\nto slavery for his benefit.\"\r\n\r\nHe said negroes \"were not intended to be included in the word\r\n'citizens' in the constitution, and therefore could claim none of\r\nthe rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and\r\nsecures to the citizens of the United States;\" and announced as\r\nthe opinion of the court that the Missouri Compromise act was not\r\nwarranted by the constitution and was therefore void.\r\n\r\nThese declarations were in no sense necessary to the decision of\r\nthe case before the court, as it was held that Dred Scott was a\r\nresident of Missouri and subject as a slave to the laws of that\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nJustices McLean and Curtis dissented from the decision of the court,\r\nand in elaborate opinions refuted, as I think, every position of\r\nthe Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThus the Kansas question became a political question in the Supreme\r\nCourt.  At once the south rejected the doctrine of popular sovereignty,\r\nand demanded, as a constitutional right, that slaves moved into a\r\nterritory must be protected like other property, whether the people\r\nof the territory wish it or not.  This was the first time in our\r\nhistory when this great tribunal entered into the political arena.\r\nIts action encouraged the south, but produced a strong feeling of\r\nresentment in the north, and widened the breach between the two\r\ngreat sections of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan, early in his administration, found it necessary to\r\nappoint a Governor of Kansas.  He selected Robert J. Walker, of\r\nMississippi, who had held high positions in the national government,\r\nhaving been Secretary of the Treasury and Senator of the United\r\nStates.  He appointed Fred. P. Stanton, of Tennessee, as secretary\r\nof the territory.  Mr. Stanton had long been a Member of high\r\nstanding of the House of Representatives.  Both were southern men\r\nand both wished to see Kansas a slave state, but both were honorable\r\nmen who would not seek to gain their ends by dishonest means.\r\nAfter a careful estimate, made by them, it was believed that there\r\nwere, in the territory, 9,000 Free State Democrats, 8,000 Republicans,\r\n6,000 pro-slavery Democrats, and 500 pro-slavery Americans.  A\r\nstrong effort was made by Governor Walker to induce these elements\r\nto join in a movement for a convention to frame a constitution,\r\nwith a view to admit Kansas as a state in the Union.  The Free\r\nState men, while anxious for such a result, were not willing to\r\ntrust their adversaries with the conduct of such an election,\r\nwithout some safeguards against the repetition of the frauds and\r\nviolence of the previous elections.  The result was that only 2,200\r\npersons took part in choosing delegates to what became the notorious\r\nLecompton convention.\r\n\r\nBoth before and after this so-called election Governor Walker\r\npromised that the constitution, when adopted, should be submitted\r\nto a vote of the people, and he added his assurance that the\r\nPresident of the United States would insist upon this condition.\r\nOn the 12th of July Mr. Buchanan wrote to Governor Walker:\r\n\r\n\"On the question of submitting the constitution to the _bona fide_\r\nresident settlers of Kansas, I am willing to stand or fall.  In\r\nsustaining such a principle we cannot fail.  It is the principle\r\nof the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the principle of popular sovereignty,\r\nand the principle at the foundation of all popular government.\r\nThe more it is discussed, the stronger it will become.  Should the\r\nconvention of Kansas adopt this principle, all will be settled\r\nharmoniously.\"\r\n\r\nThis promise was soon after violated, and the President declared\r\nin an open letter:\r\n\r\n\"At the time of the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska act slavery\r\nexisted, and still exists, in Kansas, under the constitution of\r\nthe United States.  This point has at last been finally decided by\r\nthe highest tribunal known to our laws.  How it could ever have\r\nbeen seriously doubted is a mystery.\"\r\n\r\nIt was known that the delegates elected would adopt a pro-slavery\r\nconstitution and ask for admission to the Union.  It was equally\r\nwell known that no such constitution would be adopted by the people\r\nof Kansas.  Under these circumstances the President, pressed by\r\nhis cabinet, yielded to the demands of the south, violated his\r\npledges, and supported the convention in the extreme measures\r\nadopted by it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Free State party in Kansas, composed of nearly\r\nequal proportions of Republicans and Democrats, was persuaded by\r\nGovernor Walker to take part in the regular election for the\r\nterritorial legislature.  The result was, the Free State party\r\nelected nine of the thirteen councilmen, and twenty-four of the\r\nthirty-nine representatives.  This should have settled the Kansas\r\ncontroversy, and it would have done so on the principle of popular\r\nsovereignty, but a broader constituency in the south demanded that\r\nthe doctrine of the Dred Scott case should be applied to and\r\nenforced, not only in Kansas, but in all the states.  Henceforth\r\nthe Lecompton constitution must be considered, not as a local\r\nquestion, but as a national one.  The imperative issue, as pithily\r\nstated by Lincoln, was, all slave or all free states.  The battle\r\nwas to commence in Kansas, but was to become national in its scope.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional convention met on the 19th of October, 1857,\r\nwithin two weeks after the election of the legislature, but in its\r\naction little interest was taken, a quorum being preserved with\r\ndifficulty.  It adopted a pro-slavery constitution, which, it was\r\nwell known, if submitted to the people, would be rejected by an\r\noverwhelming majority, and if not submitted would be resisted, if\r\nnecessary, by open force.  The President, Governor Walker, and all\r\nparties, had promised that the constitution, when framed, would be\r\nsubmitted to a popular vote.  How not to do it, and yet appear to\r\ndo it, was a problem worthy of a gang of swindlers, and yet the\r\nfeeling was so strong in administration circles, that the plan\r\ndevised as below given was cordially approved by the cabinet and\r\nacquiesced in by the President.\r\n\r\nThe constitution adopted by the convention provided:  \"The right\r\nof property is before and higher than any constitutional sanction,\r\nand the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase\r\nis the same and as inviolable as the right of the owner of any\r\nproperty whatever.\"  Another provision of the constitution was that\r\nit could not be amended until after the year 1864, and even then\r\nno alteration should \"be made to affect the rights of property in\r\nthe ownership of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe election was to be held on December 21, 1857.  The people might\r\nvote for the \"constitution with slavery\" or the \"constitution with\r\nno slavery.\"  In either event, by the express terms of the\r\nconstitution, slavery was established for a time in Kansas and the\r\ndoctrine of the Dred Scott case was to be embodied in our laws.\r\nNo opportunity was offered to the people to vote against the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to characterize in proper terms the infamy of these\r\nproceedings.  The Free State party would take no part in the proposed\r\nelection on December 21, and it resulted, for the constitution with\r\nslavery, 6,226 votes, of which 2,720 were proven to be fraudulent;\r\nfor the constitution without slavery, 589.  Governor Walker promptly\r\ndenounced the outrage.  He said:  \"I consider such a submission of\r\nthe question a vile fraud, a base counterfeit, and a wretched device\r\nto prevent the people voting even on the slavery question.\"  \"I\r\nwill not support it,\" he continued, \"but I will denounce it, no\r\nmatter whether the administration sustains it or not.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan supported the scheme after the constitution had been\r\nadopted by the convention.  The elections in the fall preceding\r\nwere favorable to the Democrats, and Mr. Buchanan was naturally\r\nencouraged to hope that his party had regained popular ascendancy,\r\nbut the Lecompton juggle created a profound impression in the north,\r\nand divided the Democratic party to a greater extent than did the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill, especially in the northwest and in Ohio,\r\nwhere the feeling of resentment was almost universal.  Mr. Douglas,\r\nthe great leader for the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, took\r\nimmediate ground against the pro-slavery plan, and protested to\r\nthe President against it.  An open breach occurred between them.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled, the Lecompton scheme became the supreme\r\nsubject for debate.  Mr. Douglas assumed at once the leadership of\r\nthe opposition to that measure.  He said:  \"Up to the time of\r\nmeeting of the convention, in October last, the pretense was kept\r\nup, the profession was openly made, and believed by me, and I\r\nthought believed by them, that the convention intended to submit\r\na constitution to the people, and not to attempt to put a government\r\ninto operation without such a submission.\"  But instead of that,\r\n\"All men must vote for the constitution, whether they like it or\r\nnot, in order to be permitted to vote for or against slavery.\"\r\nAgain he said:  \"I have asked a very large number of the gentlemen\r\nwho framed the constitution, quite a number of delegates, and still\r\na larger number of persons who are their friends, and I have received\r\nthe same answer from every one of them. . . . They say if they\r\nallowed a negative vote the constitution would have been voted down\r\nby an overwhelming majority, and hence the fellows should not be\r\nallowed to vote at all.\"  He denounced it as \"a trick, a fraud upon\r\nthe rights of the people.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Walker declared:  \"I state it as a fact, based on a long\r\nand intimate association with the people of Kansas, that an\r\noverwhelming majority of that people are opposed\" to the Lecompton\r\nconstitution, \"and my letters state that but one out of twenty of\r\nthe press of Kansas sustains it. . . . Any attempt by Congress to\r\nforce this constitution upon the people of Kansas will be an effort\r\nto substitute the will of a small minority for that of an overwhelming\r\nmajority of the people.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1858, during the debate on the Lecompton\r\nconstitution, I made an elaborate speech, entering fully into the\r\nhistory of that constitution and the events that preceded it, and\r\nclosed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, allow me to impress the south with two important\r\nwarnings she has received in her struggle for Kansas.  One is, that\r\nthough her able and disciplined leaders on this floor, aided by\r\nexecutive patronage, may give her the power to overthrow legislative\r\ncompacts, yet, while the sturdy integrity of the northern masses\r\nstands in her way, she can gain no practical advantage by her well-\r\nlaid schemes.  The other is, that while she may indulge with impunity\r\nthe spirit of filibusterism, or lawless and violent adventure, upon\r\na feeble and distracted people in Mexico and Central American, she\r\nmust not come in contact with that cool, determined courage and\r\nresolution which forms the striking characteristic of the Anglo-\r\nSaxon race.  In such a contest, her hasty and impetuous violence\r\nmay succeed for a time, but the victory will be short-lived and\r\ntransient, and leave nothing but bitterness behind.  Let us not\r\nwar with each other; but with the grasp of fellowship and friendship,\r\nregarding to the full each other's rights, and kind to each other's\r\nfaults, let us go hand in hand in securing to every portion of our\r\npeople their constitutional rights.\"\r\n\r\nI may as well here briefly follow the progress and end of the Kansas\r\ncontroversy.  Mr. Stanton, the acting governor in the absence of\r\nGovernor Walker, convened an extra session of the territorial\r\nlegislature, in which the Free State men had a majority.  The\r\nlegislature provided for an election to be held January 4, 1858,\r\nat which a fair vote might be taken on the constitution.  At this\r\nelection the vote stood:  For the constitution with slavery, 138;\r\nfor the constitution without slavery, 24; against the constitution,\r\n10,226.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this decisive evidence of the opposition to the\r\nLecompton constitution by the people of Kansas, Mr. Buchanan sent\r\na copy of it to Congress, and, recommending the admission of Kansas\r\nunder that organic act, said:\r\n\r\n\"It has been solemnly adjudged, by the highest judicial tribunal\r\nknown to our laws, that slavery exists in Kansas by virtue of the\r\nconstitution of the United States.  Kansas is therefore at this\r\nmoment as much a slave state as Georgia or South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the controversy Gen. Denver, a conservative Democrat, a\r\nnative of Virginia, long a resident of Ohio and a representative\r\nfrom California in the 34th Congress, was appointed Governor of\r\nKansas.  His predecessors, four of his own party, Reeder, Shannon,\r\nWalker and Stanton, had been either removed or compelled to resign,\r\nevery one refusing to execute the extreme pro-slavery policy of\r\nthe President.  His efforts to secure justice to the citizens of\r\nKansas would in all probability have led to his removal, but the\r\nmarch of events withdrew the question involved from the people of\r\nKansas to the halls of Congress.  The policy of the administration\r\nwas driving a wedge into the Democratic party.  The bill for the\r\nadmission of Kansas under the Lecompton constitution passed the\r\nSenate by a vote of 33 yeas to 25 nays, four northern Democrats\r\nand two southern Americans voting with the Republicans against it.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, composed of 128 Democrats, 92\r\nRepublicans and 14 Americans, the bill was defeated by the adoption\r\nof an amendment which provided that the Lecompton constitution\r\nshould be submitted to a vote of the people of Kansas, but this\r\namendment was disagreed to by the Senate, and the disagreement was\r\nreferred to a committee of conference.  The result was the adoption\r\nof a substitute known as the English bill.  This bill, though\r\nfaulty, and partisan, provided for the admission of Kansas under\r\nthe Lecompton constitution, but provided also for a submission of\r\nthe English bill to a vote of the people of Kansas.  On the 2nd of\r\nAugust a vote was taken in Kansas, and 11,300, out of a total vote\r\nof 13,088, were cast against the English proposition.  Thus the\r\nLecompton constitution and the English bill were defeated, the\r\nexclusion of slavery made absolute, and the State of Kansas admitted\r\ninto the Union as a free state, under a constitution approved by\r\nthe people, but not until January 29, 1861.\r\n\r\nThis memorable result was the turning point of the slavery controversy.\r\nThe people of the south hastened preparations for a dissolution of\r\nthe Union and a civil war.  The Confederate congress, meeting four\r\ndays later, on February 9, elected Jefferson Davis as its president,\r\nhe having resigned as United States Senator, January 21, 1861,\r\neight days before Kansas was admitted to the Union.\r\n\r\nI have given much space to this Kansas controversy, for I wish to\r\nimpress upon the readers of this volume that the war was not caused\r\nby agitation for the abolition of slavery, but by aggressive measures\r\nfor the extension of slavery over free territory.  A large and\r\ninfluential class of southern men were born politicians, and were\r\nmainly slaveholders.  They had, from the beginning of the government,\r\na large influence, and held more public offices of chief importance\r\nthan their northern associates.  They were constantly complaining\r\nof opinions expressed by a comparatively few Abolitionists against\r\nslavery, while the great body of the north were either indifferent\r\nto or sympathized with them in their opposition to the Abolitionists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL PANIC OF 1857.\r\nIts Effect on the State Banks--My Maiden Speech in Congress on\r\nNational Finances--Appointed a Member of the Committee on Naval\r\nAffairs--Investigation of the Navy Department and its Results--Trip\r\nto Europe with Mrs. Sherman--We Visit Bracklin's Bridge, Made Famous\r\nby Sir Walter Scott--Ireland and the Irish--I Pay a Visit to\r\nParliament and Obtain Ready Admission--Notable Places in Paris\r\nViewed With Senator Sumner--The Battlefield of Magenta--Return Home.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1857 there occurred one of those periodical\r\nrevulsions which seem to come after a term of apparent prosperity.\r\nOn the 24th of August the Ohio Life Insurance & Trust Company\r\nfailed.  That single event, in itself unimportant, indicated an\r\nunhealthy condition of trade, caused by reckless speculation, high\r\nprices, the construction of railroads in advance of their need, a\r\ngreat increase of imports, and the excessive development of cities\r\nand towns.  All credits were expanded.  The immediate results of\r\nthe panic were the suspension of credits, the diminution of imports,\r\nthe failure of banks, and the general or partial suspension or\r\nlessening of all industries.  The revenues of the government were\r\ngreatly diminished.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July, 1857, the balance in the treasury was $17,710,000.\r\nOn the 1st of July, 1858, the balance was reduced to $6,398,000,\r\nand during the year preceding, the United States borrowed $10,000,000.\r\nOn the 1st of July, 1859, the surplus was reduced to $4,320,000,\r\nand during the year preceding the United States borrowed $20,774,000.\r\nThis sudden change in the financial condition of the treasury was\r\nan indication of a like or greater change in the condition of every\r\nperson engaged in productive industries.\r\n\r\nThe panic especially affected the state banks.  These banks were\r\nauthorized by the laws of several states to issue notes as money\r\npayable on demand, with no common system or methods of redemption,\r\nand varying in value according to the solvency of the banks issuing\r\nthem.  The banks in a few of the states maintained their notes at\r\npar, or at a small discount, but the great body of the notes could\r\ncirculate only in the states where issued, and then only because\r\ntheir people could get no other money in exchange for their products.\r\nThe necessities created by the Civil War compelled the United States\r\nto borrow large sums, and to aid in this a national currency was\r\nprovided, concerning which a statement of the measures adopted will\r\nbe made hereafter.  It is sufficient here to state that the national\r\ncurrency adopted proved one of the most beneficial results of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe financial stringency of 1857 led to a careful scrutiny of\r\nappropriations for the support of the government.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May, 1858, I expressed my views in respect to the\r\nexpenditures of the United States.  This speech was the first effort\r\nI made in Congress to deal with the finances of the national\r\ngovernment.  In the previous Congresses I had devoted my time to\r\nthe struggle in Kansas.  At the meeting of the 35th Congress, I\r\nnaturally turned to the condition of the finances, then the paramount\r\nsubject of interest in the country, and, especially in Ohio, devoting\r\nmost of my time to a careful study thereof.  The speech referred\r\nto on national finances was the result of much labor, and I believe\r\nit will bear favorable scrutiny even at this late day.  It certainly\r\nattracted the attention of my colleagues, and no doubt led to my\r\ntransfer, at the next Congress, to the committee of ways and means.\r\n\r\nIn this speech I state fully the increase of expenditures and the\r\ndiminution of the revenues, and the then condition of the treasury.\r\nI quote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"And yet, sir, for this alarming condition of the public finances,\r\nthe administration has no measures of relief except loan bills and\r\npaper money in the form of treasury notes.  No provision is made\r\nfor their payment; no measure of retrenchment and reform; but these\r\naccumulated difficulties are thrust upon the future, with the\r\nimprovidence of a young spendthrift.  While the secretary is waiting\r\nto foresee contingencies, we are prevented by a party majority from\r\ninstituting reform.  If we indicate even the commencement of\r\nretrenchment, or point out abuses, on this side of the House, we\r\nare at once assailed by members of the committee of ways and means.\"\r\n\r\nI cited the abuses and usurpations of the executive departments in\r\ndiverting specific appropriations to purposes not authorized by\r\nlaw.  I said:  \"The theory of our government is, that a specific\r\nsum shall be appropriated by a _law_ originating in this House,\r\nfor a specific purpose, and within a given fiscal year.  It is the\r\nduty of the executive to use that sum, and no more, especially for\r\nthat purpose, and no other, and within the time fixed.\"\r\n\r\nI pointed out cases where the departments assumed the power to\r\ntransfer appropriations made for one purpose, to other purposes in\r\nthe same department.  Another abuse by the executive departments\r\nwas the habit of making contracts in advance of appropriations,\r\nthus, without law, compelling Congress to sanction them or violate\r\nthe public faith.  All these evils have since been remedied by\r\nrestrictive legislation.  The habit of the Senate to load down\r\nappropriation bills with amendments already refused by the House\r\nof Representatives, and then insist that, if not agreed to, the\r\nbill would fail, was more frequent then than now, but under the\r\npractice now established an amendment finally disagreed to by either\r\nHouse is abandoned.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the former practice in the Senate occurred in\r\nthe 36th Congress, when I was chairman of the committee on ways\r\nand means.  An appropriation bill was loaded down with amendments,\r\namong them an appropriation of $500,000 each for the construction\r\nof public buildings in Charleston and New Orleans.  The amendments\r\nwere disagreed to and referred to a committee of conference, of\r\nwhich Senator Toombs was a member.  His first expression in the\r\ncommittee was that the House must agree to the items for Charleston\r\nand New Orleans or the bill would fail.  I promptly answered that\r\nI would report what he said to the House, and _the bill would fail_.\r\nHe said nothing further, the conference agreed, and the bill passed\r\nwithout any mention of Charleston or New Orleans.  Even now the\r\nabuse I refer to sometimes occurs, but the general rule and practice\r\nis to exclude any item of an appropriation bill not freely agreed\r\nto by both Houses.\r\n\r\nIt was generally agreed that the views expressed by me on the 27th\r\nof May were sound in principle, but the strong partisan feeling\r\nthat ran through the speech weakened its effect.  I insert the last\r\ntwo paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, I have no hope, while this House is constituted as it\r\nis now, of instituting any radical reform.  I believe that the\r\nHouse of Representatives should be in opposition to the President.\r\nWe know the intimate relations made by party ties and party feelings.\r\nWe know that with a party House, a House a majority of whose Members\r\nare friends of the President, it is impossible to bring about a\r\nreform.  It is only by a firm, able, and determined opposition--\r\nnot yielding to every friendly request, not yielding to every urgent\r\ndemand, not yielding to every appeal--that we can expect to reform\r\nthe abuse in the administration of the government.\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of this session, I did hope that a majority of\r\nthis House would compose such an opposition; and while on the one\r\nhand it crushed the unholy attempt to impose an odious constitution\r\n--by force, or with threats or bribes--upon a free people, it would\r\nbe prepared to check the reckless extravagance of the administration\r\nin the disbursement of the public funds.  But the power of party\r\nties and the executive influence were too potent.  We can only look\r\nnow to the virtue and intelligence of the people, whose potent will\r\ncan overthrow Presidents, Senators, and majorities.  I have an\r\nabiding hope that the next House of Representatives will do what\r\nthis should have done, and become, like its great prototype, the\r\nguardian of the rights and liberties of the people.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 35th Congress I was appointed by Speaker\r\nOrr a member of the committee on naval affairs, with Mr. Bocock as\r\nchairman.  Among the subjects referred to the committee was the\r\ncapture, by Commodore Paulding of the United States navy, of William\r\nWalker, engaged in an armed foray against Nicaragua.  It was fully\r\nconsidered, and on the 3rd of February, 1858, the majority of the\r\ncommittee, through Mr. Bocock, made a full report, accompanied by\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the act of Hiram Paulding, a captain of the United\r\nStates navy, in arresting General William Walker, was not authorized\r\nby the instructions which had been given him from the navy\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That while we have no reason to believe that the said\r\nPaulding acted form any improper motives or intention, yet we regard\r\nthe act in question as a grave error, and deserving, for the reason\r\nalready given, the disapproval of the American Congress.\"\r\n\r\nBy direction of the minority of the committee I submitted a minority\r\nreport as a substitute, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That Commodore Hiram Paulding, in arresting William\r\nWalker and his associates, and returning them to the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, acted within the spirit of his orders, and\r\ndeserves the approbation of his country.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared, from the documents submitted, that in September, 1857,\r\nWalker was fitting out, within the limits of the United States, a\r\nmilitary expedition against the Republic of Nicaragua, that on the\r\n18th of September, Lewis Cass, Secretary of State, issued a circular\r\nletter, warning all persons against setting on foot such expeditions,\r\nand urging all officers of the United States to enforce the provisions\r\nof the law cited by him, to prevent such expeditions \"so manifestly\r\nprejudicial to the national character and so injurious to the\r\nnational interests.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of this circular was transmitted to Commodore Paulding, for\r\nhis guidance, by the Secretary of the Navy, and he was required to\r\nregard the instruction contained in it as addressed to himself.\r\nCommodore Chatard was suspended for failing to arrest Walker within\r\nthe port of San Juan.  Commodore Paulding arrived at San Juan on\r\nthe 6th day of December.  Walker and his men were in sight on shore,\r\nat Punta Arenas, opposite San Juan.  This point, though within the\r\nlimits of Nicaragua, has been successively claimed and occupied by\r\nCosta Rica, Nicaragua and the so-called Mosquito Kingdom, under\r\nBritish protection.  It was an almost deserted point, to which a\r\nBritish subject had set up a doubtful title, founded upon a purchase\r\nfrom a pilot of the port of San Juan.  Its occupants were engaged\r\nas a military force, and were then waging war against the existing\r\ngovernment of Nicaragua--a government with which ours was at peace,\r\nand one so weak that it was inhuman to fight it.  Although freshly\r\nlanded from our shores, in violation of our laws, and controlling\r\nno spot except that they occupied--receiving, so far as we know,\r\nno accession or aid from the natives of the country, they issued\r\norders and manifestoes headed;\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Army of Nicaragua,\r\n   Punta Arenas, December 2, 1857.\"\r\n\r\nTheir leader signed these orders:\r\n\r\n  \"William Walker,\r\n   Commander-in-Chief, Army of Nicaragua.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that the expedition was the very one denounced\r\nby the Secretary of State in the circular, and by the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy in his orders, for Walker and his men sought no disguise.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Commodore Paulding arrested Walker and\r\nhis men and returned them to the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\nThis brief and imperfect sketch of the voluminous majority and\r\nminority reports of the committee will convey but a faint idea of\r\nthe excitement created by this arrest.  An attempt was made to\r\ncensure Commodore Paulding, but it utterly failed.  The purpose of\r\nWalker was to seize Nicaragua, adopt slavery and convert the Central\r\nAmerican states into slaveholding communities, and thus strengthen\r\nslavery in the United States.  It was the counterpart of the\r\nmovements in Kansas, and was supported by powerful influence in\r\nthe southern states.\r\n\r\nAnother investigation of great importance was ordered by the House\r\nof Representatives, upon the following resolution introduced by me\r\non the 18th of January, 1859:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, D. B. Allen, a citizen of the State of New York, specifically\r\ncharges that certain officers in the navy department, in awarding\r\ncontracts for the construction of vessels of war of the United\r\nStates, have been guilty of partiality, and of violation of law\r\nand their public duty: and whereas, grave charges have been made\r\nthat money appropriated for navy yards and for the repair of vessels\r\nof the United States, has been expended for partisan purposes, and\r\nnot for the purposes prescribed by law:  Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a committee of five members be appointed to\r\nexamine, 1.  Into the specifications and bids for, and the terms\r\nof, the contracts for the work and labor done, or materials furnished\r\nfor the vessels of the United States, constructed, or in process\r\nof construction or repair, by the United States, since the 4th day\r\nof March, 1857, and the mode and manner of awarding said contracts,\r\nand the inducements and recommendations influencing such awards.\r\n2.  Into the mode and manner, and the purpose, in which the money\r\nappropriated for the navy and dock yards, and for the repair and\r\nincrease of vessels, has been expended.  That said committee have\r\npower to send for persons and papers, and have leave to report by\r\nbill or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThis investigation occupied most of the remaining session of that\r\nCongress.  The committee of five was composed of Messrs. Sherman,\r\nBocock, Ritchie, Groesbeck and Ready, three Democrats and two\r\nRepublicans, of which I was chairman.  The committee took a mass\r\nof testimony, disclosing abuses and frauds of a startling character,\r\ncovering over 1,000 printed pages.  The majority of the committee,\r\nMessrs. Bocock, Groesbeck and Ready, submitted a report condemning\r\nthe glaring abuses proven, and, while reporting the inefficiency\r\nand incompetency of subordinate officers and employees, yet declared\r\nthat nothing had been proven which impeached the personal or official\r\nintegrity of the Secretary of the Navy.  They proposed the following\r\nresolutions:\r\n\r\n\"1.  _Resolved_, That the testimony taken in this investigation\r\nproves the existence of glaring abuses in the Brooklyn navy yard,\r\nand such as require the interposition of legislative reform; but\r\nit is due to justice to declare that these abuses have been slowly\r\nand gradually growing up during a long course of years, and that\r\nno particular administration should bear the entire blame therefor.\r\n\r\n\"2.  _Resolved_, That it is disclosed, by the testimony in this\r\ncase, that the agency for the purchase of anthracite coal for the\r\nuse of the navy has been, for some time past, in the hands of a\r\nperson wholly inefficient and grossly incompetent, and that reform\r\nis needed in the regulations which exist on that subject; but there\r\nis no proof which traces any knowledge of such inefficiency and\r\nincompetency to the responsible authorities in Washington, nor any\r\nwhich shows that the need of reform grows especially out of any\r\nact of theirs; but, on the contrary, it is expressly proven that\r\nthe supply of coal for the naval service has been purchased during\r\nthis administration upon terms relatively as favorable as ever\r\nheretofore.\r\n\r\n\"3.  _Resolved_, That while we could never sanction or approve any\r\narrangement, on the part of an officer of the government, which,\r\nunder pretense of making contracts for supplies, was designed to\r\nconfer especial and exclusive favor upon individuals, yet, in the\r\ncontract entered into in September, 1858, between the navy department\r\nand W. C. N. Swift, for the supply of live oak to said department,\r\nit is clearly proven by the testimony that, if the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy did contemplate any favor to said Swift, he did not design\r\nto bestow it to the detriment of the government, but that in all\r\nhe did in this matter he kept always in view the good of the public\r\nand the interests of the service.\r\n\r\n\"4.  _Resolved_, That in the letting of the contracts for the\r\nconstruction of the steam machinery for the vessels of the navy\r\nduring the present administration, nothing has been shown which\r\ncalls for the interposition of the Congress of the United States;\r\nbut it is manifest that the present head of the navy department\r\nhas displayed a very laudable zeal to secure the greatest amount\r\nof speed and efficiency attainable for said vessels.\r\n\r\n\"5.  _Resolved_, That nothing has been proven in this investigation\r\nwhich impeaches, in any way, the personal or official integrity of\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy.\"\r\n\r\nThe minority report was made by Ritchie and myself on the 24th of\r\nFebruary, 1859, in which we recommended the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Secretary of the Navy has, with the sanction\r\nof the President, abused his discretionary power in the selection\r\nof a coal agent and in the purchase of fuel for the government.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the contract made by the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nunder date of September 23, 1858, with W. C. N. Swift, for the\r\ndelivery of live oak timber, was made in violation of the law, and\r\nin a manner unusual, improper, and injurious to the public service.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the distribution, by the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nof the patronage in the navy yard among Members of Congress was\r\ndestructive of discipline, corrupting in its influence, and highly\r\ninjurious to the public service.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the President and Secretary of the Navy, by\r\nreceiving and considering the party relations of bidders for\r\ncontracts with the United States, and the effect of awarding\r\ncontracts upon pending elections, have set an example dangerous to\r\nthe public safety and deserving the reproof of the House.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the appointment, by the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nof Daniel B. Martin, chief engineer, as a member of the board of\r\nengineers, to report upon proposals for constructing machinery for\r\nthe United States, the said Martin at the same time being pecuniarily\r\ninterested in some of said proposals, is hereby censured by this\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\nNo action was taken on these reports during that session, which\r\nterminated on the 4th of March; but in the succeeding Congress the\r\nresolutions of the minority were reported favorably from the\r\ncommittee on the expenditures of the navy department, and, after\r\ndebate, were adopted, a separate yea and nay vote being taken on\r\neach resolution, and the vote generally being 119 in favor of the\r\nresolution and 60 against, a large number of Democrats voting for\r\neach resolution.\r\n\r\nThis investigation, and the action of the House of Representatives\r\nupon it, led to radical reforms in the purchase of supplies in the\r\nnavy department, and stamped with deserved censure the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, and his subordinates, who participated in his action.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1859, Mrs. Sherman and I started on my first trip\r\nto Europe, on the steamer \"Vanderbilt,\" without any definite route\r\nor plan.  Fortunately, we formed on shipboard some pleasant\r\nacquaintances, among others Judge Harris of the Supreme Court of\r\nNew York, afterwards Senator of the United States, and his wife.\r\nEach had children by a former marriage, who had arrived at or near\r\nmanhood or womanhood, and all were pleasant traveling companions.\r\nMr. Platt and his wife, of New York, a young married couple, were\r\nof the party.  We were fortunate in the weather and the sea.  I\r\nhad often encountered the waves of Lake Erie, but the ocean was to\r\nme the great unknown, and I imagined that from its magnitude, its\r\nwaves would be in proportion to its size, but, instead, the waves\r\nof the Atlantic were a gentle cradle compared with the short and\r\nchopping movement of the lake.  Since then I have crossed the ocean\r\nmany times, but never was sea sick.  We thought the voyage of eleven\r\ndays a brief one, but now it is reduced to six or seven days, on\r\nvessels much greater and stronger.  We landed safely at Southampton\r\nlate in the evening.  Many of the passengers left immediately for\r\nLondon, but our party, with others, went to the hotel.  We seemed\r\nto overcrowd the capacity of the place.  One of our passengers, a\r\nyoung gentleman from Baltimore, said to me he would drive out those\r\nEnglishmen, who were quietly enjoying themselves in the waiting\r\nroom.  He had been a quiet gentlemanly passenger, but he changed\r\nhis tone and manner, was boisterous in his talk and rather rude.\r\nOne by one the Englishmen departed, slamming the door after them,\r\ncasting a sour look at their persecutor, but he was not disturbed\r\nuntil \"the coast was clear,\" and then quieting down in his usual\r\nmanner he said he knew these Englishmen, and thought he would give\r\nthem a chance to abuse the d----d Americans.  After long waiting\r\nwe had a good supper.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, or the day following, we visited the Isle of Wight,\r\nand what is misnamed the \"New Forest\"--which is very old instead\r\nof new, and is an open park instead of a forest--in the neighborhood.\r\nLike most travelers we soon went to London.  This great city\r\nimpressed me more by the association of great men and women who\r\nhad lived and died in it than by the grandeur of its buildings and\r\npublic works.  Every street and many houses in it recalled the\r\nnames of persons whose writings I had read, and of others whose\r\ndeeds made them immortal.  As Parliament was not in session we\r\nshortened our visit in London until our return.  My trip to Scotland\r\nwas especially interesting.  Mrs. Sherman, a daughter of Judge\r\nStewart, was in her face and affinities a thorough Scotch woman,\r\nthough her ancestors for several generations were born in America.\r\nShe was familiar with Scottish history, and with the geography of\r\nScotland.  Our visit to Edinburgh and its environs was to her like\r\na return to familiar scenes.  In our slow progress towards the\r\nlakes we stopped at Callender over Sunday.  After looking into the\r\nwell-filled church we started for Bracklinn bridge, made famous in\r\nScott's \"Lady of the Lake.\"  \"Bracklinn's thundering wave\" is a\r\nbeautiful cascade made at a place called the Bridge of Bracklinn,\r\nby a mountain stream called the Keltie, about a mile from the\r\nvillage of Callender, in Mentieth.  Above a chasm where the brook\r\nprecipitates itself from a height of at least 50 feet, there is\r\nthrown, for the convenience of the neighborhood, a rustic foot\r\nbridge, of about three feet in breadth, and without ledges, which\r\nis scarcely to be crossed by a stranger without awe and apprehension.\r\nWe were told it was but a short walk, a mile or two, but we soon\r\nfound that Scottish miles were very long.  On the way we encountered\r\nan old woman, dressed in Scotch plaid, of whom we inquired the way\r\nto Bracklinn bridge.  She pointed out the way, and in return asked\r\nus where we lived.  We told her the United States.  She replied,\r\nin language we could hardly understand, \"Ah, ye maun come a lang\r\nway to spay it.\"  She then told us where to leave the road and how\r\nto find the bridge.  There was nothing remarkable at the bridge,\r\nnothing to justify \"But wild as Bracklinn's thundering roar,\" but\r\nthe genius of Sir Walter invested it with his glamour.\r\n\r\n  \"It had much of glamour might\r\n   To make a lady seem a knight.\"\r\n\r\nThe lakes of Scotland we would call bays.  The waters of the ocean\r\nfill these deep depressions between high hills.  A boat ride over\r\nthese interlocked waters was pleasing, but the views did not impress\r\nme like the lakes in Switzerland in the midst of high mountains,\r\nnor did they compare with the grandeur of the Yellowstone Lake,\r\n6,000 feet above the sea, with surrounding mountains rising to the\r\nheight of 12,000 feet, and covered with snow.  We were much pleased\r\nwith Scotland and its people until we arrived at Glasgow.  Here we\r\nwalked about the city.  It seemed to be crowded with discontented,\r\nunhappy people, with sad faces and poorly clad.  We were told not\r\nto go into certain portions of the city, as we might be insulted.\r\n\r\nWe soon left Glasgow for Belfast and visited different parts of\r\nIreland, and especially the city of Cork, and Lake Killarney.  The\r\nsouthern part of Ireland was very beautiful, the herbage was fresh\r\nand green, and the land productive.  The great drawback was the\r\ncrowds of beggars, who would surround us wherever we went, soliciting\r\nalms, but they were generally good humored.  I saw little of the\r\ndisposition to fight attributed to them.  At a subsequent visit I\r\nsaw much more of Ireland and the Irish people, but on this, my\r\nfirst visit, I left with a very kindly impression of the country\r\nand the people.  We have more people of Irish descent in the United\r\nStates than now live in Ireland, and they have done their full part\r\nin our development, not only as laborers, but in all the walks and\r\nprofessions of life.  They are heartily welcomed in our midst.  If\r\nall the discontented people of Ireland would migrate to the United\r\nStates we would welcome them if they would leave their Irish vs.\r\nEnglish politics behind them.  We have enough possible points of\r\ncontroversy on this continent with Great Britain, without importing\r\nfrom that country old controversies that have been the occasion of\r\nwars and rumors of war for centuries.\r\n\r\nWe made but a short stay in Dublin and crossed the channel to\r\nCaernarvon.  Here we took the old tally-ho coach.  Despite all that\r\nis said about railroads and steamboats, I believe in the old-\r\nfashioned stage coach, and especially in the one in which we crossed\r\nthe hills of Wales, in full view of Mount Snowdon.  We remained\r\nover Sunday in a village on the way, inquired for the church, and\r\nwere shown to a very pretty church building near by.  When we\r\nentered we found perhaps ten or fifteen persons, mostly women.\r\nThe pastor, with an assistant, soon entered, and services commenced.\r\nThe pastor read his part, and the assistant led, and practically\r\nmade, the responses.  The singing was led by the assistant and\r\nshared in by the few women present.  The sermon was short and\r\nlifeless and the entire service--though read from the Book of Common\r\nPrayer, as fine a model of impressive English as exists--was\r\nspiritless.  When we left the church we met lines of well-dressed,\r\nbut plain, proper men, women and children in Sunday garb.  I inquired\r\nwhere these people came from, and was informed they were Methodists\r\non the way home from their meeting house.  This settled the question\r\nwith me.  The church I attended was the \"established church,\"\r\nsupported by taxes on all the people, and the Methodist meeting\r\nwas the church of the people, supported by their voluntary\r\ncontributions.  How such a policy could have been sustained so long\r\nwas beyond my comprehension.  Our policy of respect and toleration\r\nfor all religious sects, but taxes for none, is a better one.\r\n\r\nOur party, still consisting of Judge Harris and family, Mr. Platt\r\nand wife, and Mrs. Sherman and myself, visited several of the\r\ncentral counties and towns of England, chiefly the towns of Warwick,\r\nStratford, Kenilworth and Leamington.  This is well trodden ground\r\nfor tourists, and I need not repeat the many descriptions of\r\ninteresting places and the historic names and events attached to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to London, I visited the courts of law, Westminster\r\nAbbey, and the new Parliament House.  I had no difficulty in gaining\r\nfree access to the gallery of the House of Commons by stating that\r\nI was a Member of the House of Representatives.  Though I had\r\nletters of introduction to members of Parliament I did not present\r\nthem.  Judge Harris was greatly interested in the proceedings of\r\nthe courts of London, while I wandered through every part of the\r\ngreat city.  We attended, by invitation, a dinner given by the\r\nGoldsmith's Guild, and accepted some invitations, among them that\r\nof Mr. Morgan, the leading American banker in London.\r\n\r\nOur congenial party then separated with mutual regret, Judge Harris\r\ngoing to the Rhine and Mrs. Sherman and I to Paris.  Here we remained\r\nsome time.  Senator Sumner, not yet recovered from the blows of\r\nBrooks, had been some time in Paris and accompanied us to many of\r\nthe noted places in that city--among them I remember the grave of\r\nLafayette.\r\n\r\nOur visit was during the Franco-Italian-Austrian War.  I was anxious\r\nto reach the seat of war.  On the way we made hurried visits to\r\nGeneva, and Lake Leman.  After traversing this lake we took the\r\ncoach over the Alps, on the road to Milan, stopping several times\r\non the way.  We passed over the battle field at Magenta but a few\r\ndays after the battle was fought.  We saw there the signs of\r\ndestructive war.  The killed had been buried and the wounded were\r\nin hospitals, but the smell of dead horses poisoned the air, and\r\nthe marks of the battle were on almost every house.  We pushed on\r\nto Milan and were comfortably quartered.  The city was full of\r\nsoldiers on the way to the army to the eastward.  It was then known\r\nthat a battle was about to be fought at Solferino.  I was very\r\nanxious to witness a battle.  General Crittenden, of the United\r\nStates army, was attached as an aid to the French army, and I sought\r\nthe same facility, but the authorities would not permit it.  I was\r\nassured that my horse would be taken from me, especially as I could\r\nnot speak French, and that I would be treated as a spy unless I\r\nwas formally attached to a particular command.  I therefore gave\r\nup my contemplated trip and awaited the battle, which occurred in\r\na day or two.  I then returned to Switzerland by the Simplon Pass,\r\nand visited Berne, Luzerne, and Neuchâtel.  From thence I returned\r\nto London and soon after embarked on the \"Vanderbilt\" for home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nEXCITING SCENES IN CONGRESS.\r\nI am Elected for the Third Term--Invasion of Virginia by John Brown\r\n--His Trial and Execution--Spirited Contest for the Speakership--\r\nDiscussion over Helper's \"Impending Crisis\"--Angry Controversies\r\nand Threats of Violence in the House--Within Three Votes of Election\r\nas Speaker--My Reply to Clark's Attack--Withdrawal of my Name and\r\nElection of Mr. Pennington--Made Chairman of the Committee of Ways\r\nand Means--President Buchanan Objects to Being \"Investigated\"--\r\nAdoption of the Morrill Tariff Act--Views Upon the Tariff Question\r\n--My Colleagues.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July, 1858, I received the congressional nomination\r\nfor my third term without opposition, and, in October following,\r\nwas elected as a Member of the 36th Congress, by a majority of\r\n2,331 over S. J. Patrick, Democrat.\r\n\r\nThe memorable campaign in Illinois in that year excited profound\r\ninterest throughout the United States, the debate between Douglas\r\nand Lincoln attracting universal attention.  The result was favorable\r\nto Douglas, and the legislature re-elected him Senator, but Mr.\r\nLincoln attained such distinction and prominence as to place him\r\nat once in the position of a formidable candidate for the presidency\r\nin 1860.  This debate made it clear that the struggle between free\r\nand slave institutions was to be continued and to become the\r\ncontrolling issue of the future.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Broderick by Terry, in California, on the 13th of\r\nSeptember, 1859, under color of a duel, excited profound interest\r\nand made that state Republican.  The election of a governor in\r\nOhio, in the fall of that year, preceded by a debate of much interest\r\nbetween William Dennison, the Republican candidate, and Judge\r\nRanney, the Democratic candidate, added greatly to the political\r\nexcitement then existing, and ended in the election of Mr. Dennison.\r\nA few days after this election--on the 17th of October--the invasion\r\nof the State of Virginia by John Brown startled the country, and,\r\nmore than all other causes, aroused the southern people to a state\r\nof great excitement, amounting to frenzy.  Brown, with a few\r\nfollowers of no distinction, captured the United States arsenal at\r\nHarper's Ferry, took possession of the bridge which crosses the\r\nPotomac, fortifying it with cannon, stopped trains, cut telegraph\r\nwires, killed several men, and seized many prominent citizens,\r\nholding them as hostages.  Wild reports were circulated of a rise\r\nof the negroes in the neighborhood, the uprising accompanied by\r\nall the horrors of a servile war, and a general alarm prevailed\r\nthroughout the State of Virginia and the south.  The insurrection\r\nwas, however, speedily suppressed, mainly by the state militia,\r\nand the few insurgents not killed were captured by United States\r\nmarines under Colonel Robert E. Lee, soon afterwards to be commander-\r\nin-chief of the rebel forces in the Civil War.\r\n\r\nBrown was tried for murder and executed.  This foolish and criminal\r\ninvasion was the work of a fanatic who all his lifetime had been\r\na violent opposer of slavery, and who while in Kansas had participated\r\nmore or less in the Osawatamie murders.  His son was killed by the\r\n\"border ruffians\" near his home in Kansas, for which a fearful\r\nrevenge was taken upon the murderers.  Brown, having always been\r\nan Abolitionist, and being crazed by these events, believed it his\r\nduty to wage a relentless war against slavery, and, with the courage\r\nbut shortsightedness of a fanatic, and with the hope of the resistance\r\nof the slaves of the south, undertook this wild scheme to secure\r\ntheir freedom.\r\n\r\nUnder such exciting conditions Congress convened on the 5th day of\r\nDecember, 1859, divided politically into 109 Republicans, 101\r\nDemocrats and 27 Americans.  No party having a majority, it was\r\nfeared by some that the scenes of 1855, when Banks was elected\r\nspeaker only after a long struggle, would be repeated.  That contest\r\nwas ended by the adoption of the plurality rule, but in this case\r\na majority could not agree upon such a rule, and the only possible\r\nway of electing a speaker was by a fusing of Members until a majority\r\nvoted for one person.\r\n\r\nIt was well understood that the Republican vote would be divided\r\nbetween Galusha A. Grow and myself, and it was agreed between us\r\nthat whichever received a majority of the Republican vote should\r\nbe considered as the nominee of that party.  On the first vote for\r\nspeaker, Thomas S. Bocock, of Virginia, the Democratic candidate,\r\nreceived 86 votes, I received 66, Galusha A. Grow 43, and 21\r\nscattering.  Mr. Grow then withdrew his name.  On the same day John\r\nB. Clark, of Missouri, offered this resolution:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas certain Members of this House, now in nomination for\r\nspeaker, did indorse and recommend the book hereinafter mentioned,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the doctrine and sentiments of a certain book,\r\ncalled 'The Impending Crisis of the South--How to meet it,' purporting\r\nto have been written by one Hinton R. Helper, are insurrectionary\r\nand hostile to the domestic peace and tranquility of the country,\r\nand that no Member of this House who has indorsed and recommended\r\nit, or the compend from it, is fit to be speaker of this House.\"\r\n\r\nIn the absence of rules, Mr. Clark was allowed to speak without\r\nlimit and he continued that day and the next, reading and speaking\r\nabout the Helper book.  John A. Gilmer, of North Carolina, offered\r\nas a substitute for the resolution of Mr. Clark a long preamble\r\nclosing with this resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Therefore resolved_, That, fully indorsing these national\r\nsentiments, it is the duty of every good citizen of this Union to\r\nresist all attempts at renewing, in Congress or out of it, the\r\nslavery agitation, under whatever shape and color the attempt may\r\nbe made.\"\r\n\r\nA motion was made to lay both resolutions on the table, and was\r\nlost by a tie vote of 116 yeas and 116 nays.  In the absence of\r\nrules a general debate followed, in which southern Members threatened\r\nthat their constituents would go out of the Union.  The excitement\r\nover the proposition to compile a political pamphlet, by F. P.\r\nBlair, an eminent Democrat and slaveholder, from a book called \"The\r\nImpending Crisis\" written and printed by a southern man, seemed so\r\nludicrous that we regarded it as manufactured frenzy.  After John\r\nS. Millson, of Virginia, a conservative Democrat, who was opposed\r\nto the introduction of the Clark resolution, had exhibited unusual\r\nfeeling, I said:\r\n\r\n\"I have until this moment regarded this debate with indifference,\r\nbecause I presumed it was indulged in for the purpose of preventing\r\nan organization.  But the manner of the gentleman from Virginia,\r\nmy respect for his long experience in this House, my respect for\r\nhis character, and the serious impression which this matter seems\r\nto have made upon his mind, induce me to say a few words.  I ask\r\nthat the letter which I send up may be read.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter was thereupon read from the clerk's desk:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington City, December 6, 1859.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I perceive that a debate has arisen in Congress in\r\nwhich Mr. Helper's book, the 'Impending Crisis,' is brought up as\r\nan exponent of Republican principles.  As the names of many leading\r\nRepublicans are presented as recommending a compendium of the\r\nvolume, it is proper that I should explain how those names were\r\nobtained in advance of the publication.  Mr. Helper brought his\r\nbook to me at Silver Spring to examine and recommend, if I thought\r\nwell of it, as a work to be encouraged by Republicans.  I had never\r\nseen it before.  After its perusal, I either wrote to Mr. Helper,\r\nor told him that it was objectionable in many particulars, to which\r\nI adverted; and he promised me, in writing, that he would obviate\r\nthe objections by omitting entirely or altering the matter objected\r\nto.  I understand that it was in consequence of his assurance to\r\nme that the obnoxious matter in the original publication would be\r\nexpurgated, that Members of Congress and other influential men\r\namong the Republicans were induced to give their countenance to\r\nthe circulation of the edition so to be expurgated.\r\n\r\n  \"F. P. Blair,\r\n  \"Silver Spring.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI then continued:\r\n\r\n\"I do not recollect signing the paper referred to; but I presume,\r\nfrom my name appearing in the printed list, that I did sign it.\r\nI therefore make no excuse of that kind.  I never read Mr. Helper's\r\nbook, or the compendium founded upon it.  I have never seen a copy\r\nof either.  And here, Mr. Clerk, I might leave the matter; but as\r\nmany harsh things have been said about me, I desire to say that\r\nsince I have been a Member of this House, I have always endeavored\r\nto cultivate the courtesies and kind relations that are due from\r\none gentleman to another.  I never addressed to any Member such\r\nlanguage as I have heard to-day.  I never desire such language to\r\nbe addressed to me, if I can avoid it.  I appeal to my public\r\nrecord, during a period of four years, in this body; and I say not\r\nthat there is not a single question agitating the public mind, not\r\na single topic on which there can be sectional jealousy or sectional\r\ncontroversy, unless gentlemen on the other side of the House thrust\r\nsuch subjects upon us.  I repeat, not a single question.  We have\r\npursued a course of studied silence.  It is our intention to organize\r\nthe House quietly, decently, in order, without vituperations; and\r\nwe trust to show to Members on all sides of the House that the\r\nparty with which I have the honor to act can administer this House\r\nand administer this government without trespassing upon the rights\r\nof any.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, in answer to an inquiry from Shelton F. Leake, of\r\nVirginia, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to say, once for all, and I have said it five times on\r\nthis floor, that I am opposed to any interference whatever of the\r\npeople of the free states, with the relation of master and slave\r\nin the slave states.\"\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a heated debate, the manifest purpose of which\r\nwas to excite sectional animosity, and to compel southern Americans\r\nto co-operate with the Democratic Members in the election of a\r\nDemocrat for speaker.  The second ballot, taken on the close of\r\nthe session of December 8, exhibited no material change except that\r\nthe Republican vote concentrated on me.  I received 107 votes, Mr.\r\nBocock 88, Mr. Gilmer 22, and 14 scattering.\r\n\r\nThe debate continued and was participated in by my colleague, S.\r\nS. Cox, who asked me about the fugitive slave law.  I declined, as\r\nI had before, to answer any interrogatories and said:  \"I will\r\nstate to him, and to gentlemen on the other side of the House, that\r\nI stand upon my public record.  I do not expect the support of\r\ngentlemen on that side of the House, who have, for the last four\r\nyears, been engaged in a series of measures--none of which I approve.\r\nI have no answers to give to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe third ballot produced no material change.  I received 110,\r\nBocock 88, Gilmer 20, and 13 scattering.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the invasion of Harper's Ferry was debated in the\r\nSenate at great length and with extreme violence, producing in both\r\nhouses intense irritation and excitement.  Keitt, of South Carolina,\r\ncharged upon the Republicans the responsibility of Helper's book\r\nand John Brown's foray, exclaiming:  \"The south here asks nothing\r\nbut its right. . . . I would have no more; but, as God is my judge,\r\nas one of its Representatives, I would shatter this republic from\r\nturret to foundation-stone before I would take one tittle less.\"\r\nLamar, of Mississippi, declared that the Republicans were not\r\n\"guiltless of the blood of John Brown and his co-conspirators, and\r\nthe innocent men, the victims of his ruthless vengeance.\"  Pryor,\r\nof Virginia, said Helper's book riots \"in rebellion, treason, and\r\ninsurrection, and is precisely in the spirit of the act which\r\nstartled us a few weeks since at Harper's ferry.\"  Crawford, of\r\nGeorgia, declared:  \"We will never submit to the inauguration of\r\na black Republican President.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republicans generally remained silent and demanded a vote.\r\n\r\nMr. Corwin, then a Representative from Ohio, elected after a long\r\nabsence from public life, endeavored to quiet the storm.  Frequent\r\nthreats of violence were uttered.  Angry controversies sprang up\r\nbetween Members, and personal collisions were repeatedly threatened\r\nby Members, armed and ready for conflict.  No such scenes had ever\r\nbefore occurred in the Congress of the United States.  It appeared\r\nmany times that the threatened war would commence on the floor of\r\nthe House of Representatives.  The House remained in session the\r\nweek between Christmas and New Year's Day.  During this excitement\r\nmy vote steadily increased until on the 4th day of January, 1860,\r\non the 25th ballot, I came within three votes of election; the\r\nwhole number of votes cast being 207; necessary to a choice 104,\r\nof which I received 101.  John A. McClernand, of Illinois, received\r\n33, Gilmer 14, Clement L. Vallandigham, of Ohio, 12, and the\r\nremainder were scattering.\r\n\r\nAt this time Henry Winter Davis, of Maryland, an American, said to\r\nme, and to others, that whenever his vote would elect me it should\r\nbe cast for me.  J. Morrison Harris, also an American from the same\r\nstate, was understood to occupy the same position.  Garnett B.\r\nAdrain, of New Jersey, an anti-Lecompton Democrat, who had been\r\nelected by Republicans, it was hoped would do the same.  Horace F.\r\nClark, of New York, also an anti-Lecompton Democrat who had been\r\nelected by Republicans, could at any moment have settled the\r\ncontroversy in my favor.  It was well known that I stood ready to\r\nwithdraw whenever the requisite number of votes could be concentrated\r\nupon any Republican Member.  The deadlock continued.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of January, 1860, Mr. Clark, who had introduced the\r\nHelper resolution, said:\r\n\r\n\"I wish to make a personal explanation with regard to my personal\r\nfeelings in the matter of this resolution.  I never read the letter\r\nof which the gentleman from Georgia speaks, and do not take to\r\nmyself articles that appear in newspapers, unless they make\r\nimputations against my moral integrity.  That resolution was\r\nintroduced by me, as I have frequently remarked, with no personal\r\nill-feeling towards Mr. Sherman, the Republican candidate for\r\nspeaker, apart from what I considered to be an improper act of his\r\n--namely, the recommendation of that book.  So far as that affects\r\nhis political or social character, he must of course bear it.\"\r\n\r\nI replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Missouri, for the first time, I believe, has\r\nannounced that it was his purpose, in introducing this resolution,\r\nto give gentlemen an opportunity to explain their relations to the\r\nHelper book.  I ask him now whether he is willing to withdraw the\r\nresolution for the purpose he has indicated, temporarily, or for\r\nany time?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark said:\r\n\r\n\"I will endeavor to answer the gentleman.  I avowed my purpose\r\nfrankly at the time I introduced the resolution, in the remarks\r\nwith which I accompanied its introduction.  The gentleman from Ohio\r\npropounds the question more directly whether I am willing to withdraw\r\nthe resolution for the purpose which I avow?  Sir, at the very\r\ninstant it was offered, I gave the gentleman that opportunity and\r\nI have given it to him since.  I say to the gentleman that he has\r\nhad two opportunities to make that explanation; but he has failed\r\nto relieve himself of the responsibility he took when he signed\r\nthat book and recommended its circulation.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"I will say that that opportunity has never been rendered to me.\r\nWhen the gentleman introduced his resolution, offensive in its\r\ncharacter, at an improper time, in an improper manner, he cut off\r\n--what he says now he desires to give--an opportunity for explanation.\r\nIt is true that three days afterward, when the gentleman from\r\nVirginia (Mr. Millson) appealed to me, I stated to him frankly how\r\nmay name became connected with that paper.  I did not sign the\r\npaper; but it seems that the Hon. E. D. Morgan, a Member of the\r\nlast Congress, and a friend of mine, came to me when I was in my\r\nplace, and asked me to sign a recommendation for the circulation\r\nof a political pamphlet, to be compiled by a committee, of which\r\nMr. Blair, a slaveholder of Missouri, was one, from a large book\r\nby Helper, a North Carolinian.  I said to him that I had not time\r\nto examine the book; but if there was nothing offensive in it, he\r\nmight use my name.  Thereupon, this gentleman attached my name to\r\nthat paper.  This information I did not have at the time the\r\ngentleman from Virginia addressed me, but I said to him I had no\r\nrecollection of having signed the paper, but presumed I had, from\r\nmy name appearing in the printed list.  I subsequently acquired it\r\nfrom Mr. Morgan, whose letter was published.  That I believe was\r\nsufficient under the circumstances.  I know there are Members on\r\nthat side of the House who have considered it as satisfactory; and\r\nmy friends so regard it.  At the time I stated that I had not read\r\nthe book, that I did not know what was in it.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman alludes to another time.  The other day, when this\r\nsubject was again brought before the House by him, in language\r\nwhich, although he claims to be courteous, I could not regard as\r\nsuch, when I was, by implication, but with a disclaimer of personal\r\noffense, charged with disseminating treason, with lighting the\r\ntorch in the dwelling of my southern brethren, and of crimes of\r\nwhich, if I was guilty, I should not be entitled to a seat upon\r\nthis floor, I then rose in my place and told the gentleman from\r\nMissouri that if he would withdraw that resolution I would answer\r\nthis book page by page, or those extracts one by one, and tell him\r\nwhether I approved them or not.  The gentleman refused to withdraw\r\nthe resolution.  Long ago he was notified by me, and my friend from\r\nPennsylvania (Mr. Morris) announced on the floor, that this resolution\r\nwas regarded by me as a menace, and, if withdrawn, would lead to\r\na frank avowal, or disavowal.\r\n\r\n\"I say now that I do not believe it is the desire of the gentleman\r\nto give me that opportunity.  If he does desire it, I am willing\r\nto do now what I said I would have done then.  And I say, with\r\nequal emphasis, that never, so help me God, whether or not the\r\nspeaker's chair is to be occupied by me, will I do so while that\r\nresolution is before this body, undisposed of.  I regard it as\r\noffensive in its tone, unprecedented, unparliamentary, and an\r\ninvasion of the rights of representation.  Under the menace clearly\r\ncontained in it, I never will explain a single word contained in\r\nthose extracts.\r\n\r\n\"If the gentleman will withdraw his resolution, even for a moment,\r\nto relieve me from the menace--he may reinstate it afterwards if\r\nhe chooses--I will then say what I have to say in regard to those\r\nextracts.  But while it stands before the House, intended as a\r\nstigma upon me, and sustained by an argument without precedent in\r\nparliamentary history, he cannot expect me to say more than I have\r\ndone.  I believe not only my friends, but the gentlemen on the\r\nother side of the House, who have a sense of honor, believe that\r\nmy position is correct.  I know that some of them regard my statement\r\nmade on the third day of the session as full and satisfactory, and\r\nall that, under the circumstances, it was proper for me to indicate.\r\n\r\n\"For gentlemen now to press this matter; to agitate the country;\r\nto spread these extracts all over the south, and to charge the\r\nsentiments of this book upon me, and my associates here; to proclaim,\r\nday after day, that the Republicans entertain these sentiments and\r\nindorse them, is not that ingenuous, candid and manly course which\r\na great party like the Democratic party ought to pursue.  While we\r\nmay conduct our political quarrels with heat, and discuss matters\r\nwith zeal and determination, it ought to be done with fairness and\r\nfrankness.  The mode in which this resolution has been pressed\r\nbefore the country, and I, with my hands tied and my lips sealed\r\nas a candidate, have been arraigned day by day, is without a\r\nprecedent, not only in history but in party caucuses, in state\r\nlegislatures, in state conventions or anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\"I said when I rose the other day that my public opinions were on\r\nrecord.  I say so now.  Gentlemen upon the other side have said\r\nthat they have examined that record to ascertain what my political\r\nopinions were.  They will look in vain for anything to excite\r\ninsurrection, to disturb the peace, to invade the rights of states,\r\nto alienate the north and south from each other, or to loosen the\r\nties of fraternal fellowship by which our people have been and\r\nshould be bound together.  I am for the Union and the constitution,\r\nwith all the compromises under which it was formed, and all the\r\nobligations which it imposes.  This has always been my position;\r\nand these opinions have been avowed by me on this floor and stand\r\nnow upon your records.  Who has brought anything from that record\r\nagainst me that is worthy of answer? . . .\r\n\r\n\"I have never sought to invade the rights of the southern states.\r\nI have never sought to trample upon the rights of citizens of the\r\nsouthern states.  I have my idea about slavery in the territories,\r\nand at the proper time and in the proper way I am willing to discuss\r\nthe question.  I never made but one speech on the subject of slavery,\r\nand that was in reference to what I regarded as an improper remark\r\nmade by President Pierce in 1856.  I then spread upon the record\r\nmy opinions on the subject; and I have found no man to call them\r\ninto question.  They are the opinions of the body of the Republicans.\r\nThey are the opinions which I now entertain.  Gentlemen are at\r\nliberty to discuss these questions as much as they choose, and I\r\nwill bear my share of the responsibility for entertaining those\r\nopinions.  But I now speak to my personal record. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Again these gentlemen, while publishing in their speeches all over\r\nthe country that I am in effect a traitor, etc., by implication,\r\nit is true, disavowing, as I am glad to say each of them have done,\r\nany design to be personally offensive, but in a way which answers\r\nthe same purpose; yet when called upon to show proof or specifications,\r\nthey fail to do so; and the only act for which I have been arraigned\r\nbefore the American people is that, in a moment when I was sitting\r\nhere, busy at my desk, and one of my friends, and late a Member of\r\nthis House, came to me and asked me to sign a paper recommending\r\nthe publication of a political tract; that, when I authorized my\r\nname to be put to that recommendation, by that very act I became\r\na traitor and would place the torch in the hands of the incendiary.\r\nI say this is not fair argument.  And I again repeat that if the\r\nMember from Missouri (Mr. Clark) desires to know what my sentiments\r\nare in regard to the extracts read at the clerk's table, the only\r\nportion of the Helper book I have seen or read, I will give them\r\nif he will remove a menace from me.  I never did do anything under\r\nmenace.  I never will.  It is not in my blood and these gentlemen\r\ncannot put it there.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark rose to speak, but I continued:\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman will excuse me, I have, so far as I am concerned in\r\nthis contest, been quiet and patient.  I desire to see an organization\r\nof the House opposed to the administration.  I think it is our\r\nhighest duty to investigate, to examine and analyze the mode in\r\nwhich the executive powers of this government have been administered\r\nfor a few years past.  That is my desire.  Yes sir, I said here,\r\nin the first remark I made, that I did not believe the slavery\r\nquestion would come up at all during this session.  I came here\r\nwith the expectation that we would have a business session, that\r\nwe would analyze the causes of the increased expenditures of the\r\ngovernment and the proper measures of redress and retrenchment.\r\nI did not believe that the slavery question would come up, and but\r\nfor the unfortunate affair of Brown at Harper's Ferry, I did not\r\nbelieve there would be any feeling on the subject.  Northern Members\r\ncame here with kindly feelings, no man approving the foray of John\r\nBrown and every man willing to say so; every man willing to admit\r\nit as an act of lawless violence.  We came here hoping that, at\r\nthis time of peace and quiet, we might examine, inquire into, and\r\npass upon, practical measures of legislation tending to harmonize\r\nthe conflicting elements of the government and strengthen the bonds\r\nof Union.  The interests of a great and growing people present\r\npolitical questions enough to tax the ability and patriotism of us\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Such was our duty; but the moment we arrived here--before, sir,\r\nwe even had a formal vote,--this question of slavery was raised by\r\nthe introduction of the resolution of the gentleman from Missouri.\r\nIt has had the effect of exciting the public mind with an irritating\r\ncontroversy.  It has impaired the public credit and retarded the\r\npublic business.  The debate founded upon it has been unjust,\r\noffensive, wrong, not only to the Republicans here, not only to\r\nthose with whom I act, but to all our common constituents, north\r\nand south.  The gentlemen who have advocated that resolution have\r\nstirred up bad blood, and all because certain gentlemen have\r\nrecommended that a compilation be made of a book.  Even yet we may\r\nretrieve the loss of valuable time.  We could now go to work,\r\norganize the House and administer the powers of this House with\r\nfairness and impartiality.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, let me say that by no act or effort have I sought\r\nthe position I now occupy before the House.  The honor was tendered\r\nme by the generous confidence and partiality of those with whom it\r\nhas been my pride to act, politically.  Their conduct in this\r\nirritating controversy has justified my attachment.\r\n\r\n\"If I shall ever reach the speaker's chair, it will be with\r\nuntrammeled hands and with an honest purpose to discharge every\r\nduty in the spirit which the oath of office enjoins; and to organize\r\nthe House with reference to the rights and interests of every\r\nsection, the peace and prosperity of the whole Union, and the\r\nefficient discharge of all the business of the government.  And\r\nwhenever friends who have so gallantly and liberally sustained me\r\nthus far believe that my name in any way presents an obstacle to\r\nsuccess, it is my sincere wish that they should adopt some other.\r\nWhenever any one of my political friends can combine a greater\r\nnumber of votes than I have been honored with, or sufficient to\r\nelect him by a majority or plurality rule, I will not stand in this\r\nposition one hour; I will retire from the field, and yield to any\r\nother gentleman with whom I act, the barren honors of the speaker's\r\nchair; and I promise my friends a grateful recognition of the\r\nunsolicited honor conferred upon me, and a zealous and earnest co-\r\noperation.\"\r\n\r\nPending the vote on the 39th ballot and before it was announced,\r\nRobert Mallory, of Kentucky, an American, appealed to the Democrats\r\nto vote for William N. H. Smith, of North Carolina, also an American,\r\nwhich would elect him.  The Democrats thereupon changed their votes\r\nto Mr. Smith, making many speeches in explanation of their action.\r\nPerceiving that this would elect Mr. Smith I arose and for the\r\nfirst time cast my ballot for speaker, voting for Mr. Corwin.\r\nThree other Members who had voted for Mr. Smith changed their votes,\r\nwhich defeated the election on that ballot.\r\n\r\nAfter this vote I conferred with Davis and George Briggs, of New\r\nYork, Americans, and Adrain.  I had the positive assurance of these\r\nthree gentlemen that if I would withdraw they would vote for William\r\nPennington, of New Jersey, and thus secure a Republican organization\r\nof the House.  I referred this proposition to my Republican\r\nassociates, and a majority of them were opposed to any change.\r\nFrancis E. Spinner, of New York, said he would never change his\r\nvote from me, and Thaddeus Stevens said he never would do so until\r\nthe crack of doom.  When afterwards reminded of this Mr. Stevens\r\nsaid he thought he \"heard it cracking.\"\r\n\r\nI felt the responsibility, but on the 30th of January, 1860, I\r\ndetermined to withdraw.  In doing so I made the following remarks,\r\nas printed in the \"Congressional Globe:\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. clerk--[Loud cries of 'Down,' 'Down,' 'Order,' 'Order,' 'Let\r\nus have the question,' etc.]  Eight weeks ago, I was honored by\r\nthe votes of a large plurality of my fellow Members for the high\r\noffice of speaker of this House.  Since that time they have adhered\r\nto their choice with a fidelity that has won my devotion and respect;\r\nand, as I believe, the approbation of their constituents.  They\r\nhave stood undismayed amidst threats of disunion and disorganization;\r\nconscious of the rectitude of their purposes; warm in their attachment\r\nto the constitution and Union, and obedient to the rules of order\r\nand the laws.  They have been silent, firm, manly.  On the other\r\nhand, they have seen their ancient adversary and their only natural\r\nadversary, reviving anew the fires of sectional discord, and broken\r\ninto fragments.  They have seen some of them shielding themselves\r\nbehind a written combination to prevent the majority of the House\r\nfrom prescribing rules for its organization.  They have heard others\r\nopenly pronounce threats of disunion; proclaim that if a Republican\r\nbe duly elected President of the United States, they would tear\r\ndown this fair fabric of our rights and liberties, and break up\r\nthe union of these states.  And now we have seen our ancient\r\nadversary, broken, dispersed and disorganized, unite in supporting\r\na gentleman who was elected to Congress as an American, in open,\r\navowed opposition to the Democratic organization.\r\n\r\n\"I should regret exceedingly, and believe it would be a national\r\ncalamity, to have anyone who is a supporter, directly or indirectly,\r\nof this administration, or who owes it any allegiance, favor or\r\naffection, occupying a position of importance or prominence in this\r\nHouse.  I would regard it as a public calamity to have the power\r\nof this House placed, directly or indirectly, under the control of\r\nthis administration.  It would be, it seems to me, a fatal policy\r\nto trust the power of this House to the control of gentlemen who\r\nhave proclaimed that under any circumstances, or in any event, they\r\nwould dissolve the union of these states.  For this reason we would\r\nbe wanting in our duty to our God and our country, if we did not\r\navert such a result of this contest.  I regard it as the highest\r\nduty of patriotism to submerge personal feelings, to sacrifice all\r\npersonal preferences and all private interests, to the good of our\r\ncommon country.  I said here a few days ago, and I always stood in\r\nthe position, that when I became convinced that any of my political\r\nfriends or associates could receive further support outside of the\r\nRepublican organization, I would retire from the field and yield\r\nto him the honor of the position that the partiality of friends\r\nhas assigned to me.  I believe that time has now arrived.  I believe\r\nthat a greater concentration can now be made on another gentleman,\r\nwho, from the beginning, has acted with me.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, I respectfully withdraw my name as a candidate.  And\r\nin doing so, allow me to return my heartfelt thanks for the generous\r\nand hearty support of all my political friends, and especially to\r\nthose gentlemen with whom I have not the tie of a party name, but\r\nthe higher one of a common purpose and sympathy.  And if I can ask\r\nof them one more favor, it would be that in an unbroken column,\r\nwith an unfaltering front and unwavering line, each of them will\r\ncast his vote in favor of any one of our number who can command\r\nthe highest vote, or who can be elected speaker of this House.\"\r\n\r\nA ballot was immediately taken, but, much to my chagrin, the\r\ngentlemen named did not change their votes, and Mr. Pennington\r\nstill lacked three votes of an election.  I again appealed to Davis\r\nand Briggs, and finally, on the 1st of February, Mr. Pennington\r\nreceived their votes.  The result was announced; Pennington, 117\r\nvotes; McClernand, 85; Gilmer, 16; 15 scattering; giving Pennington\r\na majority of one, and thus, after a long and violent contest, a\r\nRepublican was elected speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI was entirely satisfied with the result.  I had received every\r\nRepublican vote and the votes of a large number of anti-Nebraska\r\nDemocrats and Americans.  No cloud rested upon me, no allegation\r\nof misconduct or unfitness was made against me.  I would have been\r\neasily and quickly elevated but for the abnormal excitement created\r\nby Brown's invasion and the bitterness of political antagonism\r\nexisting at that time.  Many Members who felt it their duty to oppose\r\nmy election, subsequently expressed their regret that I was not\r\nelected.  I had voted for Mr. Pennington during the contest, had\r\na high respect for him as a gentleman of character and influence,\r\nlong a chancellor of his state, and a good Republican.\r\n\r\nWhen the canvass was over, I felt a sense of relief.  During its\r\ncontinuance, I had remained, with rare exceptions, silent, though\r\nstrongly tempted, by political criticism, to engage in the debate.\r\nI had, during the struggle, full opportunity to estimate the capacity\r\nand qualifications of different Members for committee positions,\r\nand had the committees substantially framed, when Pennington was\r\nelected.  I handed the list to him, for which he thanked me kindly,\r\nsaying that he had but little knowledge of the personal qualifications\r\nof the Members.  With some modifications, made necessary by my\r\ndefeat and his election as speaker, he adopted the list as his own.\r\nHe designated me as chairman of the committee of ways and means,\r\nof which I had not previously been a member.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the House was not completed until the 9th day\r\nof February, 1860.  The officers designated by the Republicans were\r\ngenerally elected.  Congress seemed to appreciate the necessity of\r\nprompt and vigorous action on the business of the session.  Still,\r\nwhatever question was pending, political topics were the object of\r\ndebate, but were rarely acted upon, as the condition of the House\r\nprevented anything like political action.  Nearly all the measures\r\nadopted were of a non-political character.  The chief work of the\r\nsession was devoted to appropriations, and the preparation and\r\nenactment of a tariff bill.  At that time, the great body of\r\nlegislation was referred to the committee of ways and means, which\r\nthen had charge of all appropriations and of all tax laws, and\r\nwhose chairman was recognized as the leader of the House, practically\r\ncontrolling the order of its business.\r\n\r\nBy the 13th of March, I was able to say, in behalf of the committee,\r\nthat all the annual appropriation bills were ready for the\r\nconsideration of the House, and promised that if the House would\r\nsustain the committee, all these bills could be passed before the\r\nmeeting of the Charleston convention.  Notwithstanding the partisan\r\nbitterness which was exhibited against me while I was a candidate\r\nfor speaker, I had no cause to complain of a want of support by\r\nthe House, in the measures reported from that committee.  Since\r\nthen the work of that committee has been distributed among a number\r\nof committees.\r\n\r\nThe first political contest was caused by a message of President\r\nBuchanan, protesting against action under a resolution by the House\r\nof Representatives, passed on the 5th of March, providing for a\r\ncommittee of five members, to be appointed by the speaker, for the\r\npurpose of investigating \"whether the President of the United\r\nStates, or any other officer of the government, has, by money,\r\npatronage, or other improper means, sought to influence the action\r\nof Congress for or against the passage of any law pertaining to\r\nthe rights of any state or territory.\"  The committee appointed\r\ncame to be commonly known as the Covode committee.\r\n\r\nThis message was regarded as a plain interference with the\r\nunquestionable power of the House to investigate the conduct of\r\nany officer of the government, a process absolutely necessary to\r\nenable the House to exercise the power of impeachment.  Upon the\r\nreception of the message I immediately replied to it, and a general\r\ndebate arose upon a motion to refer it to the committee on the\r\njudiciary.  That motion was adopted and the committee reported a\r\nresolution in the following words, which was finally adopted after\r\ndebate, by a vote of 88 yeas and 40 nays:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the House dissents from the doctrines of the\r\nspecial message of the President of the United States of March 28,\r\n1860;\r\n\r\n\"That the extent of power contemplated in the adoption of the\r\nresolutions of inquiry of March 5, 1860, is necessary to the proper\r\ndischarge of the constitutional duties devolved upon Congress;\r\n\r\n\"That judicial determinations, the opinions of former Presidents\r\nand uniform usage, sanction its exercise; and\r\n\r\n\"That to abandon it would leave the executive department of the\r\ngovernment without supervision or responsibility, and would be\r\nlikely to lead to a concentration of power in the hands of the\r\nPresident, dangerous to the rights of a free people.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was regarded as a severe reproach to the President,\r\nwho was not content to let the matter rest there, but on the 25th\r\nof June sent to the House of Representatives, a message restating\r\nthe position in his former message.  He denounced the proceedings\r\nof that committee as a violation of the letter and spirit of the\r\nconstitution.  But for the lateness of the session the message\r\nwould have been the subject of severe animadversion.  Late as it\r\nwas Benjamin Stanton, of Ohio, entered his protest and moved that\r\nthe message be referred to a select committee of five, with power\r\nto report at the next session.  This, after a brief debate, was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire session, while the current business was progressing\r\nrapidly, the political questions involved in the pending presidential\r\ncanvass, the topics of Kansas and slavery, were frequently obtruded\r\ninto the debate.  On the 23rd of April, William T. Avery, a Democratic\r\nMember from Tennessee charged that \"an overwhelming majority of\r\nthe Republican party in this House, headed by Mr. Sherman--in fact,\r\nevery member of that party present when the vote was taken, excepting\r\nsome fourteen or fifteen--indorsed the doctrine of the abolition\r\nof slavery everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a reply to this charge I said:\r\n\r\n\"I think there is not a Member on this side of the House who is\r\nnot now willing to make the declaration broadly, openly, that he\r\nis opposed to any interference whatever with the relations of master\r\nand slave in the slave states.  We do believe that Congress has\r\nthe power to prohibit slavery in the territories; and whenever the\r\noccasion offers, whenever the proper time arrives, whenever the\r\nquestion arises, we are in favor of exercising that power, if\r\nnecessary, to prevent the extension of slavery into free territory.\r\nWe are frank and open upon this subject.  But we never did propose,\r\nand do not now propose, to interfere with slavery in the slave\r\nstates.  I hope the gentleman will put these observations in his\r\nspeech, so that the gentleman's constituents may see that we 'black\r\nRepublicans' are not so very desirous of interfering with their\r\ninterests or rights, but only desirous of preserving our own.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmore inquired:  \"Are you not in favor of abolishing slavery\r\nin the District of Columbia?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have stated to my constituents, over and over again, that I am\r\nopposed to interference with slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\nThat is my individual position.  The Republican party never took\r\na position on the subject.  Some are for it, and some against it.\r\nI have declared to my constituents, over and over again, that I\r\ndid not think it proper to agitate the question of the abolition\r\nof slavery in the District of Columbia; because I believe that this\r\nis the very paradise of the free negro.  I believe that practically,\r\nthough not legally, he is better off in the District than in any\r\nportion of the United States.  There are but few slaves here, and\r\nthe number is decreasing daily.  As an institution, slavery scarcely\r\nexists here, and I am willing to leave it to the effect of time.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, 1860, Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont, by\r\ninstruction of the committee of ways and means, reported a bill\r\n\"to provide for the payment of outstanding treasury notes, to\r\nauthorize a loan, to regulate and fix duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes.\"  This became the law commonly known as the Morrill\r\ntariff act, which, from the time of its introduction to this day,\r\nhad been the subject of debate, amendment, criticism and praise.\r\nIt was referred to the committee of the whole on the state of the\r\nUnion, and its consideration occupied a large proportion of the\r\nremainder of the session.  Nearly one hundred Members entered into\r\nthe debate and some of them made several speeches upon the subject.\r\nBeing at the time much occupied with the appropriation bills, I\r\ndid not give much attention to the debate, but had taken part in\r\nthe preparation of the bill in the committee of ways and means,\r\nand concurred, with rare exceptions, in the principles and details\r\nof the measure.\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill was eminently fitted to prepare a tariff bill.  He had\r\nbeen engaged in trade and commerce, was a man of sound judgment,\r\nperfectly impartial and honest.  Representing a small agricultural\r\nstate, he was not biased by sectional feeling or the interests of\r\nhis constituents.  He regarded the tariff as not only a method of\r\ntaxation, but as a mode of protection to existing industries in\r\nthe United States with a view to encourage and increase domestic\r\nproduction.  He was moderate in his opinions, kind and fair in\r\nexpressing them, and willing to listen with patience to any\r\nproposition of amendment.  He still lives at the venerable age of\r\neighty-five, and has been, during all the long period since the\r\nreport of the bill named after him, to this time, in public life,\r\nand still retains the confidence and affection of his constituents\r\nand colleagues.\r\n\r\nI did not participate in the debate until the time came when, in\r\nthe judgment of the committee of ways and means, it was necessary\r\nto dispose of the bill, either by its passage or defeat.  On the\r\n7th of May, 1860, the bill being before the House, I moved that\r\nall debate on it should cease at one o'clock the next day.  Some\r\nopposition was evinced, but the motion was adopted.  I then made\r\nmy first speech upon the subject of the tariff.  The introductory\r\nparagraphs state the then condition of the treasury as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The revenue act of March 3, 1857, which it is now proposed to\r\nrepeal, has proved to be a crude, ill-advised, and ill-digested\r\nmeasure.  It was never acted upon in detail in either branch of\r\nCongress, but was the result of a committee of conference in the\r\nlast days of the session, and was finally passed by a combination\r\nof hostile interests and sentiments.  It was adopted at a time of\r\ninflated prices, when the treasury was overflowing with revenue.\r\nWhen that condition of affairs ceased, it failed to furnish ordinary\r\nrevenue, and by its incidental effects operated injuriously to\r\nnearly every branch of industry.\r\n\r\n\"It went into operation on the 1st of July, 1857.  At that time\r\nthere was in the treasury of the United States a balance of\r\n$17,710,114.  The amount of the public debt then remaining unpaid,\r\nnone of which was then due, was a little over $29,000,000.  So that\r\nthere was in the treasury of the United States, when the tariff\r\nact of 1857 went into operation, nearly enough to have paid two-\r\nthirds of the public debt.  Within one year from that time, the\r\npublic debt was increased to $44,910,777.\r\n\r\n\"On the 1st of July, 1859, the public debt had increased to\r\n$58,754,699.  On the 1st of May, 1860, as nearly as I can ascertain,\r\nthe public debt had risen to $65,681,099.  The balance in the\r\ntreasury on the first of July next, as estimated by me, will be\r\n$1,919,349.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Under the operation of the tariff of 1857, the deficit in the\r\nrevenue is over $52,000,000.  It may be stated thus:\r\n\r\n  Balance in the treasury, July 1, 1857 . . . . . . . . . $17,710,114\r\n  Balance in the treasury, July 1, 1860, estimated  . . .   1,919,349\r\n                                                          $15,790,765\r\n  Amount of public debt May 1, 1860 . . . $65,681,199\r\n  Amount of public debt July 1, 1857  . .  29,060,386      36,620,813\r\n                                                          $52,411,578\"\r\n\r\nIt was manifest from these statements that there was an imperative\r\nnecessity for the passage of some measure to increase the revenues.\r\nWe could hardly hope that, in the excited state of the public mind\r\nand the known position of the Senate, the bill could pass at that\r\nsession.  The government had been conducted for three years by\r\nborrowing money in time of peace.  The appropriations had been\r\nreduced during that session by the committee of ways and means\r\nbelow the estimate of the treasury, as stated by me to the House.\r\nI then said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire now to say that the committee of ways and means, who have\r\nhad charge of appropriation bills, have endeavored, faithfully and\r\nhonestly, without regard to party divisions--and all parties in\r\nthis House are represented in that committee--to cut down the\r\nappropriations to the lowest practicable point; and thus to reduce\r\nthe expenses of the government.  I have before me a table showing\r\nthat, upon the estimates submitted to us, by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, for the ordinary expenses of the government, we have been\r\nable to reduce the amount about $1,230,000.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a careful statement of the condition of the treasury and the\r\nnecessity for further supplies, I expressed this opinion of the\r\npending bill:\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment Mr. Morrill's bill is a great improvement on the\r\ntariff of 1857.  It is more certain.  It is more definite.  It\r\ngives specific duties.  There is another reason why it is better\r\nthan the tariff of 1857.  That tariff is made up of complex and\r\ninconvenient tables.  The number of tables is too great; and in\r\nsome cases the same article is in two tables.  Thus, flaxseed comes\r\nin with a duty of ten per cent.; and yet linseed, the same thing,\r\nyielding the same product, the same oil, is admitted duty free.\r\nThe bill of Mr. Morrill, on the other hand, fixes three _ad valorem_\r\ntables; one at ten per cent., one at twenty, and the other at\r\nthirty.  There is a number of specific duties, and then there is\r\na free list.  It conforms to our decimal currency, and the duties\r\nunder it are easily calculated.  There can be but little dispute\r\nabout home and foreign valuation under it.  It will yield a revenue\r\nsufficient to pay the expenses of the government.  It is more simple\r\nand more certain.  It substitutes specific for _ad valorem_ duties\r\nwhenever practicable.  For these reasons, it is obvious Mr. Morrill's\r\nbill ought to receive the sanction of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill not only provided for a sufficient revenue, but was\r\ndistinctively a bill for incidental protection to all American\r\nindustries, impartially and fairly applied.  I said I desired to\r\nhave this bill passed,\r\n\r\n\"Because it is framed upon the idea that it is the duty of the\r\ngovernment, in imposing taxes, to do as little injury to the industry\r\nof the country as possible; that they are to be levied so as to\r\nextend a reasonable protection to all branches of American industry.\r\nI think that is right.  Every President of the United States, from\r\nWashington to this time, has recognized that principle, including\r\nMr. Buchanan.\r\n\r\n\"We may make a tariff to raise the sum of $40,000,000, and injure\r\nevery industrial interest of the country.  The committee of ways\r\nand means report a tariff bill which will produce $65,000,000, and\r\nwill do no injury to any industrial interest.  I believe that it\r\nwill give a reasonable fair protection for the great industries of\r\nagriculture, manufacture, and commerce, which lie at the basis of\r\nthe prosperity of this country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill participated in this debate by brief but clear statements\r\nin respect to the details of the bill.  On the 8th of May, 1860,\r\nhe said, in the course of some remarks upon the bill:\r\n\r\n\"I think if the gentleman will examine this bill, he will find that\r\nthe average rates of duties upon manufactured articles are not\r\nhigher, but rather lower, than they are now; but being to a large\r\nextent specific, they will prove of great value to the country, in\r\ngiving steadiness to our markets, as well as to the revenue; and\r\nbecause frauds will be to a very great extent obviated, which are\r\nnow practiced under our _ad valorem_ system, and which have made\r\nour government almost equal in infamy to that of Mexico and other\r\ncountries, where their revenue laws are a mere farce.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill, despite its merits, was assailed with all forms of\r\namendments from all parts of the House.  Many of the amendments\r\nwere adopted, until the bill became so mottled that Mr. Morrill,\r\ndiscouraged and strongly inclined against the bill as changed, was\r\ndisposed to abandon it to its fate.  He was not familiar with the\r\nrules, and, for this reason, labored under a disadvantage in the\r\nconduct of the bill.  I believed not only in the merits of the\r\nmeasure, but that by a process strictly in accordance with the\r\nrules, it might be restored substantially as it was reported by\r\nthe committee.  To secure that effect Mr. Morrill offered an\r\namendment in the nature of a substitute for the bill.  To that I\r\noffered as an amendment a bill which embodied nearly all of the\r\noriginal bill as reported, with such modifications as were evidently\r\nfavored by the House, without affecting the general principles of\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\nThe vote, upon my substitute being adopted in place of the substitute\r\noffered by Mr. Morrill, prevented any amendment to my amendment\r\nexcept by adding to it.  The result of it was that the House, tired\r\nwith the long struggle, and believing that the measure thus amended\r\nwas in substance the same as the original bill reported, finally\r\npassed the bill on the 10th day of May, 1860, by the vote of 105\r\nyeas to 64 nays.\r\n\r\nAs this was my birthday, I remember to have celebrated it, not only\r\nas my birthday, but as the day on which the Morrill tariff bill\r\npassed the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nWe knew upon the passage of this bill that it could not pass the\r\nSenate during that session.  It was taken up in that body, debated\r\nat length, and finally, on the 20th of June, it was, in effect,\r\npostponed until the next session.\r\n\r\nI might as well here follow the Morrill tariff bill to its final\r\npassage at the next session of this Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December, 1860, Mr. Hunter, from the committee on\r\nfinance, to whom was referred the tariff bill, reported it back\r\nwith a recommendation that it be postponed until the 4th day of\r\nMarch following.  This was, in effect, to reject the bill, as\r\nCongress terminated on that day.  The committee on finance, and a\r\nmajority of the Senate as then constituted, was opposed to the\r\npassage of the bill, but the secession movements, then openly\r\nthreatened, soon changed the political complexion of the Senate,\r\nby the resignation of Senators on account of the secession of their\r\nstates.  On the 18th of January, 1861, Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania,\r\nmoved to take up the bill, and, upon his motion, it was made a\r\nspecial order for the following Wednesday.  On the 23rd of January\r\nit was referred to a committee of five members, consisting of Mr.\r\nSimmons, Mr. Hunter, Mr. Bigler, Mr. Fessenden, and Mr. Gwin.  This\r\nwas done on the same day when the committees of the Senate were\r\nreorganized on account of the withdrawal of Senators.  The special\r\ncommittee appointed by the Vice President was friendly to the bill.\r\nThen for the first time it became possible to secure favorable\r\naction in the Senate.  Many amendments were proposed and adopted\r\nby the Senate, but they did not materially affect the general\r\nprinciples upon which the bill was founded.  It passed the Senate\r\nwith these amendments by the decided vote of 25 yeas to 14 nays.\r\nAll of the amendments of the Senate but one were promptly agreed\r\nto by the House, and a conference between the two Houses was ordered.\r\nMessrs. Simmons, Bigler and Hunter were the managers on the part\r\nof the Senate and Messrs. Sherman, Phelps and Moorhead on the part\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th day of February, five days before the close of the\r\nsession, the conferees reported to the Senate their agreement and\r\nthe report of the committee was adopted without objection or division\r\nof that body, and also by the House of Representatives, and the\r\nbill was signed by President Buchanan.\r\n\r\nThis law, passed in the throes of a revolution, and only possible\r\nas the result of the withdrawal of Senators to engage in the war\r\nof secession, met all the expectations of its friends.  It was\r\nfair, just and conservative, and would, in peaceful times, yield\r\nabout $50,000,000 a year, the amount of national expenditures in\r\n1860, and, at the same time, protect and strengthen all existing\r\nhome industries, and lay the foundation for great increase in\r\nproduction.  It was destined, however, to begin its existence at\r\na period of revolution.  The secession of eleven states precipitated\r\nthe war, involving enormous expenditures, in the face of which all\r\nrevenue laws were inadequate and powerless.  The credit of the\r\ngovernment, its resources and capacity for taxation, had to be\r\nappealed to.  Resort was had to every possible mode of taxation\r\nthat could be devised by the ingenuity of man, to supply the\r\nrequirements of the war, and to maintain the public credit.  The\r\nMorrill tariff act was, therefore, greatly modified by subsequent\r\nlaws, the duties doubled and in some cases trebled.  Internal taxes,\r\nyielding twofold the amount collected from customs, were levied,\r\nand cheerfully paid, and duties on imported goods were quickly\r\nincreased.  The details of this act became the victim of the war,\r\nbut the general principles upon which it was founded, the application\r\nof specific duties where possible, and the careful protection\r\nextended to the products of the soil and the mine, as well as of\r\nthe workshop, have been maintained to a greater or less extent\r\nuntil the present time.\r\n\r\nI have participated in framing many tariff bills, but have never\r\nsucceeded in securing one that I entirely approved.  The Morrill\r\ntariff bill came nearer than any other to meeting the double\r\nrequirement of providing ample revenue for the support of the\r\ngovernment and of rendering the proper protection to home industries.\r\nNo national taxes, except duties on imported goods, were imposed\r\nat the time of its passage.  The Civil War changed all this, reducing\r\nimportations and adding tenfold to the revenue required.  The\r\ngovernment was justified in increasing existing rates of duty, and\r\nin adding to the dutiable list all articles imported, thus including\r\narticles of prime necessity and universal use.  In addition to\r\nthese duties, it was compelled to add taxes on all articles of home\r\nproduction, on incomes not required for the supply of actual wants,\r\nand, especially, on articles of doubtful necessity, such as sprits,\r\ntobacco and beer.  These taxes were absolutely required to meet\r\nexpenditures for the army and navy, for the interest on the war\r\ndebts and just pensions to those who were disabled by the war, and\r\nto their widows and orphans.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have, in a measure, been fulfilled.  The war is\r\nover; the public debt has been diminished to one-third of the amount\r\ndue at the close of the war.  The pension list is the chief and\r\nalmost only outstanding obligation growing out of the war, but this\r\nis fully met by internal taxes on spirits, tobacco and beer.  What\r\nis needed now is a tariff or tax on imported goods sufficient in\r\namount to meet the current expenditures of the government, and\r\nwhich at the same time will tend to encourage the production in\r\nthis country of all articles, whether of the farm, the mine or the\r\nworkshop, that can be readily and at reasonable cost produced in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nAnd here we meet the difficulty that the mode, extent, manner and\r\nobjects of tariff taxation are unhappily mixed up in our party\r\npolitics.  This should not be so.  Whether the mode of taxation\r\nshould be by a percentage on the _value_ of goods imported, or by\r\na duty imposed on the weight or quantity, depends upon the nature\r\nof the article.  If the article is sold in the market by weight or\r\nquantity, the duty should be specific, _i. e._, a certain rate on\r\nthe unit of weight or quantity.  If it is of such a nature that\r\nits value cannot be measured by weight or quantity the duty should\r\nbe _ad valorem, i. e._ a percentage of its value.  This is matter\r\nof detail to be fixed by the custom of merchants.  As a rule it is\r\nbetter to fix the duty upon weight or measure, rather than upon\r\nvalue, for by the former mode the amount is easily ascertained by\r\nthe scale or yard stick, while to base the duty upon value, changing\r\nfrom day to day, is to invite fraud and litigation.\r\n\r\nThe extent or rate of duty to be imposed should depend entirely\r\nupon the pecuniary wants of the government, and the nature of the\r\narticle imported.  If the article is one of luxury, mainly consumed\r\nby the rich, the duty should be at a higher rate than upon an\r\narticle in general use.  This principle is sometimes disputed, but\r\nit would seem that in a republic a just discrimination ought to be\r\nmade in favor of the many rather than of the few.  On this principle\r\nall political parties have acted.  The rates have been higher on\r\nsilks, satins, furs and the like than on goods made of cotton,\r\nwool, flax or hemp.  To meet the changing wants of the government\r\nall articles should be classified in schedules, so that the rate\r\nof duty on a single schedule, or on many schedules, could be advanced\r\nor lowered without disturbing the general scheme of taxation.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner of taxation and the places where duties should be\r\ncollected, all will agree that they should be paid as nearly as\r\npossible where the goods are to be consumed.  The concentration of\r\nimportations at any one port on the coast, or at several ports,\r\ngives to the people residing at or near such favored ports an\r\nadvantage over the people living in the interior of the country.\r\nThe system of interior ports, or places of delivery to which goods\r\nmay be consigned, has been adopted and generally approved.  The\r\nobject is that all parts of the country shall have equal facilities\r\nand bear equally the burdens of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe method of importations should be so simplified that any person,\r\nin any part of the United States, may order from any commercial\r\nport or country any article desired and be able to receive it and\r\npay the prescribed duty, at any considerable port or city in the\r\nUnited States that he may designate.\r\n\r\nAs to the objects of tariff taxation there is and always will be\r\nan honest difference of opinion.  The main purpose is to secure\r\nthe revenue from foreigners seeking our market to dispose of their\r\nproducts.  The United States has the right, exercised by every\r\nnation, to determine upon what terms the productions of foreign\r\nnations shall be admitted into its markets, and those terms will\r\nbe such as its interests may demand.  Great Britain may admit nearly\r\nall commodities free of duty, but even that country is guided by\r\nher interests in all her commercial regulations.  All other nations\r\nclassified as civilized seek, like the United States, by tariff\r\nlaws, not only to secure revenue, but to protect and foster domestic\r\nindustries.  Japan has won its entrance among civilized nations by\r\nsecuring treaties with European countries and the United States,\r\nby which she has been relieved from restrictions as to her duties\r\non imports, and now has the right to regulate and fix her import\r\nduties as her interest dictates.\r\n\r\nThe United States has from the beginning of its government declared\r\nthat one object of duties on imports is the encouragement of\r\nmanufactures in the United States, and, whatever may be the dogma\r\ninserted in a political party platform, tariff legislation will\r\ncontinue to have a double object, _revenue and protection_.  This\r\nwas strikingly exemplified by the recent action of Congress in the\r\npassage of the tariff law now in force.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty in our tariff laws is to avoid unequal and\r\nunjust discrimination in the objects of protection, made with a\r\nview to favor the productions of one state or section at the cost\r\nof another state or section.  The dogma of some manufacturers, that\r\nraw materials should be admitted free of duty, is far more dangerous\r\nto the protective policy than the opposition of free traders.  The\r\nlatter contend that no duties should be levied to protect domestic\r\nindustry, but for revenue only, while the former demand protection\r\nfor their industries, but refuse to give to the farmer and miner\r\nthe benefit of even revenue duties.  A denial of protection on\r\ncoal, iron, wool and other so-called raw materials, will lead to\r\nthe denial of protection to machinery, to textiles, to pottery and\r\nother industries.  The labor of one class must not be sacrificed\r\nto secure higher protection for another class.  The earth and all\r\nthat is within it is the work of God.  The labor of man that tends\r\nto develop the resources buried in the earth is entitled to the\r\nsame favor and protection as skilled labor in the highest branch\r\nof industry, and if this is not granted impartially the doctrine\r\nof protection proclaimed by the founders of our government, supported\r\nfor more than a hundred years of wonderful progress, will be\r\nsacrificed by the hungry greed of selfish corporations, who ask\r\nprotection for great establishments and refuse to grant it to the\r\nminer, the laborer and the farmer.\r\n\r\nAnother principle must be ingrafted into our tariff laws, growing\r\nout of new modes of production by corporations and combinations.\r\nUntil recently each miner, each artisan, and each manufacturer,\r\nhad to compete in the open market with everyone engaged in the same\r\nindustry.  The general public had the benefit of free competition.\r\nThis tended to lower prices on many commodities, to increase the\r\nquantity produced, and to supply the home market, thus excluding\r\nimportations.  The tendency since the Civil War in every branch of\r\nindustry has been to consolidate operations.  To effect this,\r\ncorporations have been created in most of the states and granted\r\nsuch liberal corporate powers, without respect to the nature of\r\nthe business to be conducted, and with terms and privileges so\r\nfavorable, that private enterprise without large capital cannot\r\ncompete with them.  Instead of small or moderate workshops, with\r\na few hands, we now have great establishments with hundreds of\r\nemployees, and all the capital of scores of stockholders under the\r\ncontrol of a few men, and often of one man.  This may be of benefit\r\nby reducing the cost of production, but it also involves two dangers,\r\none the irrepressible conflict of labor with capital, and the other\r\nthe combination of corporations engaged in the same business to\r\nadvance prices and prevent competition, thus constituting a monopoly\r\ncommanding business and controlling the market.\r\n\r\nThis power in the hands of a few is at this moment the disturbing\r\nelement in many of our great industries.  It is especially dangerous\r\nwhen it is promoted by rates of duty on imported goods higher than\r\nare necessary to cover the difference in the cost of labor here\r\nand abroad.  When such conditions occur, the monopoly becomes\r\noffensive.  Such combinations are denounced and punished by the\r\nlaws of almost every civilized government and by the laws of many\r\nof our states.  They should be denounced and punished by the laws\r\nof the United States whenever they affect any matter within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.  Whenever the tendency of a\r\nmonopoly is to prevent mutual competition, and to advance prices\r\nfor any articles embraced in our tariff laws, the duty on the\r\narticle should be at once reduced or repealed.\r\n\r\nAs Members of Congress, divided by party lines and crude platforms,\r\nmust in the main, care for and protect local interests, I do not\r\nbelieve any fair, impartial and business tariff can be framed by\r\nthem.  It would be better for Congress, the law-making power, after\r\ndetermining the amount to be raised, to sanction and adopt a careful\r\ntariff bill, framed by an impartial commission, large enough to\r\nrepresent all sections and parties, all employers and employees.\r\nHitherto, the tariffs framed by Congress have been rejected by the\r\npeople.  Each party, in its turn, has undertaken the task with a\r\nlike result.  Let us try the experiment of a tariff framed, not by\r\na party upon a party platform, but by the selected representatives\r\nof the commercial, industrial, farming and laboring classes.  Let\r\nCongress place upon the statute book such a law, and the tariff\r\nquestion will cease to be the foot ball of partisan legislation.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the session was occupied chiefly in the consideration\r\nof appropriation bills.  These were carefully scrutinized; many\r\nestimates of the departments were reduced.  As usual, appropriations\r\nwere increased in the Senate, but most of the amendments were\r\nrejected in conference.\r\n\r\nThe bill authorizing a loan for the redemption of treasury notes\r\nwas passed on the 22nd day of June.  Congress adjourned at noon\r\nJune 25, 1860.\r\n\r\nThis memorable Congress, commencing with a contest which threatened\r\nviolence on the floor of the House of Representatives, was held\r\nunorganized for sixty days by a defeated party upon a flimsy pretext,\r\nand during all that time we had to listen to open threats of\r\nsecession and disunion made by its members.  No previous Congress\r\nhad exhibited such violence of speech and action.  When fully\r\norganized it quieted down, and, with occasional exceptions, proceeded\r\nrapidly to the discharge of its public duties.  A greater number\r\nof contested bills were passed at this Congress than usual.  Most\r\nof these measures came from the committee of ways and means.  The\r\nmembers of that committee were Messrs. John Sherman, of Ohio, Henry\r\nWinter Davis, of Maryland, John S. Phelps, of Missouri, Thaddeus\r\nStevens, of Pennsylvania, Israel Washburn, Jr., of Maine, John S.\r\nMillson, of Virginia, Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont, Martin J.\r\nCrawford, of Georgia, and Elbridge G. Spaulding, of New York.  Of\r\nthese but two, Mr. Morrill and myself, survive.  A brief notice of\r\nthose who are numbered with the dead may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nHenry Winter Davis was the most accomplished orator in the House\r\nwhile he was a Member.  Well educated in college, well trained as\r\na lawyer, an accomplished writer and eloquent speaker, yet he was\r\na poor parliamentarian, a careless member in committee, and utterly\r\nunfit to conduct an appropriation or tariff bill in the House.  He\r\nwas impatient of details, querulous when questioned or interrupted,\r\nbut in social life and in intercourse with his fellow Members he\r\nwas genial, kind and courteous.  On one occasion, when I was called\r\nhome, I requested him to take charge of an appropriation bill and\r\nsecure its passage.  He did as I requested, but he was soon\r\nembarrassed by questions he could not answer, and had the bill\r\npostponed until my return.  I felt for Mr. Davis a personal\r\nattachment, and I believe this kindly feeling was reciprocated.\r\nHe served in the House of Representatives during most of the war,\r\nand joined with Senator Wade in opposition to Mr. Lincoln's re-\r\nelection in 1864.  He died at Baltimore on the 20th of December,\r\n1865, when in the full vigor of matured manhood.\r\n\r\nJohn S. Phelps in 1860 was an old and experienced Member.  Born in\r\nConnecticut he removed to Missouri as early as 1837.  In 1844 he\r\nwas elected to Congress as a Democrat, and continued as a Member\r\nsixteen years, being chairman of the committee of ways and means\r\nduring the 35th Congress.  He was a valuable Member, patient,\r\ncareful, industrious, and had the confidence of the House.  He was\r\nmoderate in his political opinions, and, though a resident of\r\nMissouri, he took the Union side in the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens, one of the most remarkable men of the last\r\ngeneration, was born in Vermont near the close of the last century;\r\nand was well educated.  He taught school and studied law.  He\r\nremoved to Pennsylvania and there engaged in turbulent politics;\r\nserved several years as a member of the state legislature; was\r\nelected to Congress in 1848 and served four years.  He was known\r\nto be an aggressive Whig and a dangerous opponent in debate; was\r\nre-elected in 1858 as a Republican and at once took the lead in\r\nthe speakership contest.  His sarcasm was keen and merciless.  He\r\nwas not a very useful member of the committee.  He was better in\r\nthe field of battle than in the seclusion of the committee.  Still,\r\nwhen any contest arose in the House over bills reported by the\r\ncommittee, he was always ready to defend its action.  Though a\r\ncynical old bachelor, with a deformed foot and with a bitter tongue\r\nfor those he disliked, he was always charitable and kind to the\r\npoor.  He was quiet and impartial in his charity, recognizing no\r\ndistinction on account of color, but usually preferring to aid\r\nwomen rather than men.  I was often the witness of his charities.\r\nHe continued in active public life until his death on the 11th of\r\nAugust, 1868.  For some time before his death he was unable to walk\r\nup the marble steps of the capitol and two stout negroes were\r\ndetailed to carry him up in a chair.  On one occasion when safely\r\nseated he grimly said to them, \"Who will carry me when you die?\"\r\nMr. Stevens was a brave man.  He always fought his fights to a\r\nfinish and never asked or gave quarter.\r\n\r\nIsrael Washburn, Jr., of Maine, was one of three brothers, Members\r\nof this Congress.  Israel was the eldest, and, perhaps, the most\r\nactive, of the three.  He received a classical education, studied\r\nlaw and was admitted to the bar in 1830.  He was a good debater\r\nand a useful member of the committee.  He had been in Congress ten\r\nyears, including the 36th.  He subsequently became governor of\r\nMaine, and collector of customs at Portland.\r\n\r\nJohn S. Millson, of Virginia, had long been a Member of Congress,\r\nwas fifty-two years old, and regarded as a safe, conservative man\r\nof fair abilities.\r\n\r\nMartin J. Crawford, of Georgia, was a lawyer of good standing.  He\r\nwas elected a Member of Congress in 1854, and continued as such\r\nuntil the rebellion, in which he took an active part.  When Georgia\r\nseceded, he, with his colleagues, formally withdrew from Congress.\r\nCrawford and I had been friendly, and somewhat intimate.  He was\r\na frank man, openly avowing his opinions, but with respectful\r\ntoleration of those of others.  After he withdrew we met in the\r\nlobby; he bade me good-bye, saying that his next appearance in\r\nWashington would be as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nof the Confederate States.  I told him that he was more likely to\r\nappear as a prisoner of war.  I then warned him that the struggle\r\nwould be to the death, and that the Union would triumph.  Long\r\nafterwards, when I visited the fair at Atlanta, he recalled our\r\nconversation and admitted I was the best prophet.  We spent the\r\nevening and far into the night talking about the past and the\r\nfuture.  He evinced no regret for the result of the war, but quietly\r\nacquiesced, and was then a judge in one of the courts in that state.\r\n\r\nElbridge G. Spaulding, of New York, was an excellent Member.  He\r\nhad a taste for financial problems and contributed a good deal to\r\nthe measures adopted, in this and the 37th Congress, to establish\r\na national currency and to build up the public credit.  These\r\nMembers, with Mr. Morrill and myself, were charged with the most\r\nimportant legislation in the 36th Congress, and I believe that the\r\ngeneral opinion of the House was that we did our duty well.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nLAST DAYS OF THE BUCHANAN ADMINISTRATION.\r\nMy First Appearance Before a New York Audience--Lincoln's Nomination\r\nat the Chicago Convention--I Engage Actively in the Presidential\r\nCanvass--Making Speeches for Lincoln--My Letter to Philadelphia\r\nCitizens--Acts of Secession by the Southern States--How the South\r\nwas Equipped by the Secretary of the Navy--Buchanan's Strange\r\nDoctrine Regarding State Control by the General Government--Schemes\r\n\"To Save the Country\"--My Reply to Mr. Pendleton on the Condition\r\nof the Impending Revolution--The Ohio Delegation in the 36th Congress\r\n--Retrospection.\r\n\r\nI have followed this important session of Congress to its close,\r\nbut while the debate continued in Congress a greater debate was\r\nbeing conducted by the people.  Never before was such interest felt\r\nin the political questions of the day.  In many of the cities of\r\nthe country clubs were organized for political discussions, and\r\npersons in public life were pressed to make speeches or lectures\r\non the topics of the day.  The Young Men's Central Republican Union,\r\nof New York, arranged a series of lectures, the first of which was\r\ndelivered by Frank P. Blair, the second by Cassius M. Clay, and\r\nthe third by Abraham Lincoln.  The remarkable address of the last\r\nnamed had great influence in securing his nomination for President.\r\nIt was the first time Mr. Lincoln had spoken in New York, where he\r\nwas then personally almost unknown.  His debate with Douglas had\r\nexcited general attention.  Using the language of his biographers:\r\n\r\n\"When, on the evening of February 27, 1860, he stood before his\r\naudience, he saw not only a well-filled house, but an assemblage\r\nof listeners in which were many whom, by reason of his own modest\r\nestimate of himself, he would have been rather inclined to ask\r\nadvice from than to offer instruction to.  William Cullen Bryant\r\npresided over the meeting.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The representative men of New York were naturally eager to see\r\nand hear one who, by whatever force of eloquence or argument, had\r\nattracted so large a share of the public attention.  We may also\r\nfairly infer that, on his part, Lincoln was no less curious to test\r\nthe effect of his words on an audience more learned and critical\r\nthan those collected in the open air meetings of his western\r\ncampaigns.  This mutual interest was an evident advantage to both;\r\nit secured a close attention from the house, and insured deliberation\r\nand emphasis by the speaker, enabling him to develop his argument\r\nwith perfect precision and unity, reaching perhaps the happiest\r\ngeneral effect ever attained in any one of his long addresses.\"\r\n\r\nHis speech was printed by the leading papers of the city, and, in\r\npamphlet form, was widely distributed and read.\r\n\r\nI was invited by the Republican Union to make one of these addresses,\r\nand, though very much occupied and having little time for preparation,\r\nI accepted the invitation, and spoke at Cooper Institute in the\r\ncity of New York on the 30th of April, 1860.  It was my first\r\nappearance before a New York audience, and I confess that I was\r\nnot satisfied with the address.  I undertook, what I never attempted\r\nbefore, to read a political speech to a popular audience.  While\r\nI was treated kindly I felt quite sure my speech was a disappointment.\r\nA recent reading of it confirms my opinion that it was not equal\r\nto the occasion or the audience.\r\n\r\nI was also invited by the Republican Club of Philadelphia to make\r\na speech ratifying the nomination of Lincoln and Hamlin and spoke\r\nat a meeting held May 28, 1860.  My address was entirely impromptu,\r\nand was far better, both in manner and matter, than the speech in\r\nNew York, and was received with great applause.  Since that time,\r\nI have never attempted to make a popular address from manuscript.\r\nEvery speaker should know the substance of what he intends to say,\r\nbut ought to rely for his words upon the spirit and temper of the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1860 was ominous of domestic discord and civil war.\r\nThe success of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,\r\nthe violent scenes in the House, notably those between Potter,\r\nPryor, Barksdale, and Lovejoy, were indications that the south was\r\naggressive, and that the north would fight.  The meeting of the\r\nDemocratic convention at Charleston, on the 23rd of April, soon\r\ndisclosed an almost equal division of its members as to slavery in\r\nthe territories.  The southern platform was adopted by a majority\r\nof one in its committee on resolutions, but rejected by a majority\r\nof the convention.  This was the vital issue between the followers\r\nof Davis and Douglas, and Douglas won.  A majority of the delegates\r\nfrom six of the southern states thereupon withdrew from the convention\r\nand adjourned to Richmond.  Thus, the first secession was from a\r\nDemocratic convention.  The remainder of that convention adjourned\r\nto Baltimore, at which city Douglas was nominated for President.\r\nThe seceding delegates nominated Breckenridge.  Thus, the Democratic\r\nparty, which, in every stage of the slavery controversy, had taken\r\nsides with the south, was itself broken on the rock of slavery,\r\nand condemned to certain defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention met at Chicago on the 16th of May, with\r\na defined line of public policy which was adopted unanimously by\r\nthe convention.  The only question to be determined was, who should\r\nbe the candidate for President, who would best represent the\r\nprinciples agreed upon.  Seward, Chase and Bates were laid aside,\r\nand Abraham Lincoln, one stronger than any of these, was unanimously\r\nnominated.  The nomination of a candidate by a third party, ignoring\r\nthe slavery question, did not change the issue.  The conflict was\r\nnow between freedom and slavery, an issue carefully avoided by the\r\ntwo great parties prior to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\nThus Douglas, as a consequence of his own act, was destined to\r\ndefeat, and the irrepressible conflict was to be finally determined\r\nby the people in the choice between Lincoln and Breckenridge, with\r\nthe distinct declaration, made by the delegates seceding from the\r\nCharleston convention, that if Lincoln was elected their states\r\nwould secede from the Union, and establish an independent government\r\nfounded upon slavery.  This was the momentous issue involved in\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned on the 28th of June, 1860.  On the 17th of July,\r\nI was unanimously renominated at Shelby.  John Shauck, a venerable\r\nQuaker, 80 years of age, claimed to right to nominate me as he had\r\ndone in previous conventions.  He was absent at the moment, but\r\nthe convention, in deference to his known wishes, awaited his\r\ncoming.  From that time until the election, I was actively engaged\r\nin the presidential canvass.  I spent but little time in my district,\r\nas there was but a nominal opposition to my election.  The Democratic\r\ncandidate, Barnabus Burns, was a personal friend, and sympathized\r\nwith me on many subjects.  Scarcely a week day passed that I did\r\nnot speak at least once.\r\n\r\nOf the many speeches made by me in that canvass, I recall but very\r\nfew.  I have already referred to my debate with Cox, if it can\r\nproperly be called a debate.  It was friendly badinage.  He charged\r\nme with pulling the Morrill tariff bill through by a trick.  I\r\nanswered that if it was a trick, it was a trick well played, as\r\nthe bill passed by a vote of 105 to 64, many Democrats voting for\r\nit.  He complained of the duties on wool, declaring that the farmers\r\nwere sacrificed.  I showed that the duties on wool had been advanced.\r\nHe said I was president of a Know Nothing Lodge in Mansfield.  I\r\nsaid this was simply a lie, and that there were plenty of Douglas\r\nDemocrats before me who knew it.  He said that I initiated therein,\r\nSam Richey in a stable.  I asked who told him that story, when the\r\naudience called out loudly for Burns.  Mr. Burns rose and said he\r\ndid not tell Mr. Cox so.  I said I was glad to hear it, that it\r\nwas a silly lie made up out of whole cloth, and asked if Richey\r\nwas present.  Richey was in the crowd, and rose amid great laughter\r\nand applause and said:  \"Here I am.\"  I said:  \"Well, friends, you\r\nsee my friend, Richey, is a genuine Irishman, but he knows, as I\r\nknow, that Cox's story is a falsification.  Mr. Cox says I am a\r\npolitical thief; don't think he charges me with stealing sheep, he\r\nonly means to say I stole squatter sovereignty.  It is petty larceny\r\nat best.  But I did not steal Douglas squatter sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to define the difference between the only two\r\nparties with definite principles.  The real contest was, not between\r\nLincoln and Douglas, or between Cox and me, but between Breckenridge\r\nand Lincoln, between free institutions and slave institutions,\r\nbetween union and disunion.  I refer to this debate with Cox to\r\nshow how local prejudices obscured the problem then involved.  The\r\npeople of Ohio were divided on parallel lines, for Cox and I agreed\r\non Kansas, but he was for Douglas and I for Lincoln, while the\r\nsouth was brooding over secession, if either Lincoln or Douglas\r\nshould be elected.\r\n\r\nI went into most of the congressional districts of Ohio and perceived\r\na strong leaning in favor of Lincoln, but Douglas also had many\r\nsupporters.  The Democratic party of Ohio was satisfied with Douglas'\r\npopular sovereignty, especially as it, as they alleged, had secured\r\nfreedom for Kansas.  Breckenridge had no great following in Ohio,\r\nand Bell and Everett less.\r\n\r\nI spent several days in the canvass in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New\r\nJersey and Delaware, all warmly contested states, the votes of\r\nwhich would determine the election.  It soon became apparent that\r\nLincoln was the only candidate who could secure a majority of the\r\nelectoral vote.  This fact, and the known difficulty of securing\r\nan election by the House in case of failure of an election by the\r\nElectoral College, greatly aided Mr. Lincoln.  I presented this\r\nargument with care and fullness in a speech delivered at Philadelphia\r\non the 12th of September, 1860.  It was printed at the time and\r\nlargely circulated.  I quote a paragraph, which contains the one\r\nfact upon which my argument rested:\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the division of the Democratic party, the Republican\r\nparty is the only one that can hope to succeed by a direct vote of\r\nthe people.  This is a fact I need not discuss, for it was written\r\nat the threshold of the contest by the conventions of Charleston\r\nand Baltimore.  If the election were to be determined by the rule\r\nof plurality--a rule now adopted in every state in the Union--\r\nintelligent men would consider it already decided; but the rule of\r\nthe majority is fixed by the constitution, and if Pennsylvania does\r\nnot vote for Lincoln, then the election devolves upon the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  In that event the constitution requires the House\r\nto choose immediately, by ballot, a President from the persons,\r\nnot exceeding three, having the highest number of electoral votes.\r\nThe vote must be taken by states, and not by Representatives.  The\r\nthree millions of people of Pennsylvania will have only the same\r\npolitical power as the one hundred thousand people of Delaware.\"\r\n\r\nI recently read this speech, and, in view of the events that followed\r\nI can say that every prophecy made, and every argument stated, has\r\nbeen verified and sustained by the march of events.  My opening\r\ncriticism of Mr. Buchanan's administration may seem to be partisan\r\nand unjust, but the general opinion now is that his fault was\r\nfeebleness of will, not intentional wrong.  Mr. Buchanan was\r\nsurrounded by men who had already made up their minds to destroy\r\nthe Union, one of whom had already committed acts of treachery in\r\nthe distribution of arms and military supplies, and all of whom\r\navowed the legality and rightfulness of secession.  I think what\r\nI said was justified by the conditions existing when the speech\r\nwas made.  The residue of my speech was certainly moderate enough\r\nto satisfy the most conservative mind.  I give the closing\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\"These are, so far as I know, the leading ideas of the Republican\r\nparty.  I appeal to your candor if they do not commend themselves\r\nto the judgment of reasonable men.  Is this the party which you\r\nwould combine and conspire against, and to defeat which you would\r\nunite hostile elements?  Is it to defeat these ideas that you would\r\nrisk scenes of violence in the House, or the subversion of the\r\nconstitution by the Senate of the United States?  Is it to defeat\r\nthis noble policy that you would longer trust a broken-down, corrupt\r\nand demoralized administration?  Is it for this that you would\r\ncontinue in power a party that, by a long enjoyment of the patronage\r\nof the government, has become reckless and corrupt?\r\n\r\n\"If you will take the responsibility of preventing the triumph of\r\nthe Republican party, you may do so, but it will require a close\r\nfusion of all the elements to defeat it.  It is young and vigorous.\r\nIt has all the unity and discipline of the old Democratic party.\r\nIt holds most of the opinions, modified by experience, of the old\r\nWhig party.  It has the conservative moderation of the People's\r\nparty, which has influenced its nominations.  It adheres to every\r\nprinciple proclaimed by the old Republican party of Jefferson.  We\r\nhave confidence in the integrity and patriotism, and wisdom of our\r\nstandard bearers--Lincoln and Hamlin.  If Mr. Lincoln cannot be\r\nrecommended as a parlor President, like General Pierce, and is not\r\nfamiliar with the etiquette of foreign courts, as is Mr. Buchanan,\r\nwe know that he is honest, faithful, courageous and capable.  No\r\nman can read his celebrated debates with Mr. Douglas, without\r\nforming a high opinion of his capacity.  He is better for having\r\nlived but a short time in Washington, for that city of politicians\r\nis not particularly celebrated for sound principles or right morals.\r\nBorn in Kentucky, descended from a Pennsylvania stock, the son and\r\ngrandson of Virginians, raised in Indiana and Illinois, familiar\r\nby his own experience with the wants and interests and aspirations\r\nof the people, he possesses the same traits of character which made\r\nJackson and Clay, in their day and generation, leaders of parties\r\nand of men.  Let us, my friends, unite in electing him President\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln was elected.  He received 180 electoral votes; Breckenridge\r\n72; Douglas 12; Bell 39.  The question then was whether the people\r\nof the seceding states would try to carry into effect their\r\ndeclaration.  I had no doubt they would try, but I was equally\r\nconfident they would fail.\r\n\r\nAs events progressed in the south, citizens of the north held\r\npopular meetings in nearly all our cities and in many rural\r\ncommunities.  I was invited by leading citizens of Philadelphia to\r\nattend a public dinner in that city in December, 1860.  I could\r\nnot attend in person, but wrote them a letter which defined clearly\r\nmy convictions and my conception of the duties of our people in\r\nview of passing events.  I insert it here:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, December 22, 1860.\r\n\"Gentlemen:--Your note of the 15th inst., inviting me to attend a\r\npublic dinner in your city, on Friday evening next, was duly\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\"I remember with pleasure the kindness shown me during the recent\r\ncanvass by our political friends in Philadelphia, and would gladly\r\navail myself of the proposed celebration, to mingle my personal\r\nthanks with your rejoicings, over the recent triumph of our political\r\nprinciples.  Other engagements and duties, however, will not allow\r\nme that pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"No state can dispute with Pennsylvania the honor of this triumph.\r\nHer own son was upon trial, and her voice of condemnation was\r\nemphatic and decisive.  The election of Governor Curtin foreshadowed\r\nher decision, and strengthened our cause in every state where\r\nfreedom of election is allowed to the people.  Her verdict in\r\nNovember reconsidered and reaffirmed her verdict in October.  And\r\nnow, since the victory is won, let us not lose the fruits of it.\r\n\r\n\"Fidelity to principle is demanded by the highest patriotism.  The\r\nquestion is not whether this or that policy should prevail; but\r\nwhether we shall allow the government to be broken into fragments,\r\nby disappointed partisans, condemned by four-fifths of the people.\r\nIt is the same question answered by General Jackson in his proclamation\r\nof 1833.  It is the same question answered by Henry Clay in the\r\nSenate in 1850.  It is the same question answered by Madison and\r\nJefferson, and recently by Wade and Johnson.  It is a question\r\nwhich, I feel assured, every one of you will answer, in the patriotic\r\nlanguage of General Jackson--'_The Union, it must be preserved_.'\r\n\r\n\"Such would be the voice of the whole country, if the government\r\nwas not now administered by those who not only threaten treason,\r\nbut actually commit it, by turning the powers of the government\r\nagainst itself.  They kill the government they have sworn to maintain\r\nand defend, because the people, whose agents they are, have condemned\r\nthem.  In this spirit we have seen a Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncharged with the financial credit of the government, offering for\r\nsale the bonds of the government, and at the same moment declaring\r\nthat it will be overthrown, and that he would aid in overthrowing\r\nit.  We see other high officers receiving _pay_ for services to\r\nthe government, and yet, at the same moment, plotting its destruction.\r\nWe see the treasury robbed by subordinate officers amid the general\r\nruin.  Stranger still, we see the President of the United States\r\nacknowledging his duty to execute the laws, but refusing to execute\r\nthem.  He admits that the constitution is the supreme law; that\r\nneither a state nor the citizens of a state can disregard it; and\r\nyet, armed as he is with all the executive power, he refuses even\r\nto protect the property of the United States against armed violence.\r\nHe will not heed General Cass, the head of his cabinet.  He will\r\nnot heed General Scott, the head of the army.  He has transferred\r\nto southern states more than one hundred thousand arms, of the\r\nnewest pattern and most effective calibre, to be turned against\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n\"The American people are now trembling with apprehension lest the\r\nPresident allow our officers and soldiers to be slaughtered at\r\ntheir posts, for want of the aid which he has refused, or, what is\r\nfar more disgraceful, shall order the flag of the Union to be\r\nlowered, without resistance to lawless force.\r\n\r\n\"Treason sits in the councils, and timidity controls the executive\r\npower.  The President listens to, and is controlled by, threats.\r\nHe theorizes about coercing a state when he should be enforcing\r\nthe laws against rebellious citizens.  He admits that the states\r\nhave surrendered the power to make treaties, coin money, and regulate\r\ncommerce, and yet we will probably have the novel and ridiculous\r\nfarce of a negotiation between the President and a state, for the\r\nsurrender of forts, and arsenals, and sovereignty.  Congress can\r\ndo nothing, for the laws now are sufficient, if executed.  Impeachment\r\nis too slow a remedy.  The constitution provided against every\r\nprobable vacancy in the office of President, but did not provide\r\nfor utter imbecility.\r\n\r\n\"The people, alarmed, excited, yet true to the Union and the\r\nconstitution, are watching with eager fear, lest the noble government,\r\nbaptized in the blood of the Revolution, shall be broken into\r\nfragments, before the President elect shall assume the functions\r\nof his office.\r\n\r\n\"What pretext is given for this alarming condition of affairs?--\r\nfor every treasonable act has its pretext.  We are told that the\r\npeople of the southern states _apprehend_ that Mr. Lincoln will\r\ndeprive them of their constitutional rights.  It is not claimed\r\nthat, as yet, their rights have been invaded, but upon an _apprehension_\r\nof evil, they will break up the most prosperous government the\r\nprovidence of God ever allowed to man.\r\n\r\n\"We know very well how groundless are their apprehensions, but we\r\nare not even allowed to say so to our fellow-citizens of the south.\r\nSo wild is their apprehension, that even such statesmen as Stephens,\r\nJohnson, Hill, Botts and Pettigrew, when they say, 'wait, wait,\r\ntill we see what this Republican party will attempt,' are denounced\r\nas Abolitionists--Submissionists.  You know very well that we do\r\nnot propose to interfere in the slightest degree with slavery in\r\nthe states.  We know that our leader, for whose election you rejoice\r\nhas, over and over again, affirmed his opposition to the abolition\r\nof slavery in the District of Columbia, except upon conditions that\r\nare not likely to occur; or to any interference with the inter-\r\nstate slave trade, and that he will enforce the constitutional\r\nright of the citizens of the slave states to recapture their fugitive\r\nslaves when they escape from service into the free states.  We know\r\nvery well that the great objects which those who elected Mr. Lincoln\r\nexpect him to accomplish will be to secure to free labor its just\r\nright to the territories of the United States; to protect, as far\r\nas practicable, by wise revenue laws, the labor of our people; to\r\nsecure the public lands to actual settlers, instead of non-resident\r\nspeculators; to develop the internal resources of the country, by\r\nopening new means of communication between the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific, and to purify the administration of the government from\r\nthe pernicious influences of jobs, contracts, and unreasoning party\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n\"But some of you may say, all this is very well, but what will you\r\ndo to save the Union?  Why don't you compromise?\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, remember that we are just recovering from the dishonor\r\nof breaking a legislative compromise.  We have been struggling,\r\nagainst all the powers of the government, for six years, to secure\r\npractically what was expressly granted by a compromise.  We have\r\nsucceeded.  Kansas is now free.  The Missouri restriction is now\r\npractically restored by the incipient constitution of Kansas, and\r\nsafer yet, by the will of her people.  The baptism of strife through\r\nwhich she has passed has only strengthened the prohibition.  There\r\nlet it stand.\r\n\r\n\"But our political opponents, who have dishonored the word compromise,\r\nwho trampled, without a moment's hesitation, upon a compromise,\r\nwhen they expected to gain by it, now ask us to again compromise,\r\nby securing slavery south of a geographical line.  To this we might\r\nfairly say:  There is no occasion for compromise.  We have done no\r\nwrong; we have no apologies to make, and no concessions to offer.\r\nYou chose your ground, and we accepted your issue.  We have beaten\r\nyou, and you must submit, as we have done in the past, and as we\r\nwould have done if the voice of the people had been against us.\r\nAs good citizens, you must obey the laws, and respect the constituted\r\nauthorities.  But we will meet new questions of administration with\r\na liberal spirit.  Without surrendering our convictions in the\r\nleast, we may now dispose of the whole territorial controversy by\r\nthe exercise of unquestioned congressional power.\r\n\r\n\"The only territory south of the line, except that which, by treaty\r\nwith Indian tribes, cannot be included within the jurisdiction of\r\na state, is New Mexico.  She has now population enough for admission\r\nas a state.  Let Congress admit her as a state, and then she has\r\nthe acknowledged right to form, regulate, change, or modify her\r\ndomestic institutions.  She has now a nominal slave code, framed\r\nand urged upon her by territorial officers.  Practically, slavery\r\ndoes not exist there.  It never can be established there.  In a\r\nregion where the earth yields her increase only by the practice of\r\nirrigation, slave labor will not be employed.  At any rate, it is\r\nbetter to settle all questions about slavery there, by admitting\r\nthe territory as a state.  While a territory, it is insisted that\r\nslavery shall be protected in it.  We insist that Congress may\r\nprohibit it, and that the people have an undisputed right to exclude\r\nslaves.  Why not, by terminating their territorial condition,\r\ndetermine this controversy?  The same course might now properly be\r\nadopted with all the territories of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"In each of the territories there are, now, small settlements\r\nscattered along the lines of transit.  Within five years, the least\r\npopulous will contain sufficient population for a Representative\r\nin Congress.  Dakota, Washington, Nevada, and Jefferson are destined\r\nsoon to be as familiar to us as Kansas and Nebraska.  It is well\r\nworthy the consideration of the old states, whether it is not better\r\nto dispense with all territorial organizations--always expensive\r\nand turbulent--and, at once, to carve the whole into states of\r\nconvenient size, for admission.  This was the Jeffersonian plan,\r\nwhich did not contemplate territories, but states.  It was also\r\nsanctioned by General Taylor, and, but for his death, would have\r\nbeen adopted.\r\n\r\nThis is an easy, effectual remedy, within the power of Congress,\r\nand in its nature an irrevocable act.  There is no necessity of an\r\namendment to the constitution.  It is not at all probable that two-\r\nthirds of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the states\r\ncan agree to any amendments.  Why attempt it, unless to invite new\r\ncontests, to again arouse sectional animosities?  We know that if\r\nMexico is acquired the south will demand it for slavery, and the\r\nnorth for free institutions.  We must forego, for the present, new\r\nconquests, unless the love of acquisition is stronger than the love\r\nof domestic peace.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it to be conceded that the constitution should be amended,\r\nwhat amendment will satisfy the south?  Nothing less than the\r\nprotection of slavery in the territories.  But our people have\r\npronounced against it.  All who voted for Mr. Lincoln or Mr. Douglas\r\n--over three million three hundred thousand citizens--voted against\r\nthis claim.  Less than a million voted for it.  Should the great\r\nmajority yield to a meagre minority, especially under threats of\r\ndisunion?  This minority demand that slavery be protected by the\r\nconstitution.  Our fathers would not allow the word 'slave' or\r\n'slavery' in the constitution, when all the states but one were\r\nslaveholding.  Shall we introduce these words when a majority of\r\nthe states are free, and when the progress of civilization has\r\narrayed the world against slavery?  If the love of peace and ease,\r\nand office, should tempt politicians and merchants to do it, the\r\npeople will rebel.  I assure you, whatever may be the consequence,\r\nthey will not yield their moral convictions by strengthening the\r\ninfluence of slavery in this country.  Recent events have only\r\ndeepened this feeling.\r\n\r\n\"The struggle to establish slavery in Kansas; the frequent murders\r\nand mobbings, in the south, of northern citizens; the present\r\nturbulence and violence of southern society; the manifest fear of\r\nthe freedom of speech and of the press; the danger of insurrection;\r\nand now the attempt to subvert the government rather than submit\r\nto a constitutional election--these events, disguise it as you may,\r\nhave aroused a counter irritation in the north that will not allow\r\nits representatives to yield merely for peace, more than is prescribed\r\nby the letter and spirit of the constitution.  Every guarantee of\r\nthis instrument ought to be faithfully and religiously observed.\r\nBut when it is proposed to change it, to secure new guarantees to\r\nslavery, to extend and protect it, you invoke and arouse the anti-\r\nslavery feeling of the north to war against slavery everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"I am, therefore, opposed to any change in the constitution, and\r\nto any compromise that will surrender any of the principles sanctioned\r\nby the people in the recent contest.  If the personal-liberty bills\r\nof any state infringe upon the constitution, they should at once\r\nbe repealed.  Most of them have slumbered upon the statute book\r\nfor years.  They are now seized upon, by those who are plotting\r\ndisunion, as a pretext.  We should give them no pretext.  It is\r\nalways right and proper for each state to apply to state laws the\r\ntest of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable fact that neither of the border free states--\r\nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, nor Iowa--have\r\nany such upon their statute books.  The laws of these states,\r\nagainst kidnapping, are similar to those of Virginia and Kentucky.\r\nThe laws of other states, so-called, have never operated to release\r\na single fugitive slave, and may be regarded simply as a protest\r\nof those states against the harsh features of the fugitive slave\r\nlaw.  So far as they infringe upon the constitution, or impair, in\r\nthe least, a constitutional right, they are void and ought to be\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\n\"I venture the assertion that there have been more cases of kidnapping\r\nof free negroes in Ohio, than of peaceable or unlawful rescue of\r\nfugitive slaves in the whole United States.  It has been shown that\r\nthe law of recapture and the penalties of rescue have been almost\r\ninvariably executed.  Count up all the cases of rescue of negroes\r\nin the north, and you can find in your newspapers more cases of\r\nunlawful lynching and murder of white men in the south.  These\r\ncases have now become so frequent and atrocious, as to demand the\r\nattention of the general government.  The same article of the\r\nconstitution that secures the recapture of fugitives from service\r\nand justice, also secures the rights of citizens of Pennsylvania\r\nand Ohio to all the immunities and privileges of citizens of the\r\nseveral states.  No law has been passed by Congress to secure this\r\nconstitutional right.  No executive authority interposes to protect\r\nour citizens, and yet we hear no threats of retaliation or rebellion\r\nfrom northern citizens or northern states.  So, I trust, it ever\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n\"The great danger that now overshadows us does not arise from real\r\ngrievances.  Plotters for disunion avail themselves of the weakness\r\nof the executive to precipitate revolution.  South Carolina has\r\ntaken the lead.  The movement would be utterly insignificant if\r\nconfined to that state.  She is still in the Union, and neither\r\nthe President nor Congress has the power to consent to her withdrawal.\r\nThis can only be by a change in the constitution or the acquiescence\r\nof the people of the other states.  The defense of the property of\r\nthe United States and the collection of the revenues need not cause\r\nthe shedding of blood, unless she commences a contest of physical\r\nforce.  The increase, in one year, of our population is greater\r\nthan her entire population, white and black.  Either one of several\r\ncongressional districts in the west has more white inhabitants than\r\nshe has.  Her military power is crippled by the preponderance of\r\nher slaves.  However brave, and gallant, and spirited her people\r\nmay be, and no one disputes these traits, yet it is manifest she\r\nis weak in physical force.  This great government might well treat\r\nwith indulgence paper secession, or the resolves of her convention\r\nand legislature, without invoking physical force to enforce the\r\nlaws among her citizens.\r\n\r\n\"Without disrespect to South Carolina, it would be easy to show\r\nthat Shay's rebellion and the whisky insurrection involved the\r\ngovernment in greater danger than the solitary secession of South\r\nCarolina.  But the movement becomes imposing when we are assured\r\nthat several powerful states will very soon follow in the lead of\r\nSouth Carolina; and when we know that other states, still more\r\npowerful, sympathize with the seceding states, to the extent of\r\nopposing, and perhaps resisting, the execution of the laws in the\r\nseceding states.\r\n\r\n\"In this view of the present condition of public affairs, it becomes\r\nthe people of the United States seriously to consider whether the\r\ngovernment shall be arrested, in the execution of its undisputed\r\npowers, by the citizens of one or more states, or whether we shall\r\ntest the power of the government to defend itself against dissolution.\r\nCan a separation take place without war?  If so, where will be the\r\nline?  Who shall possess this magnificent capital, with all its\r\nevidences of progress and civilization?  Shall the mouth of the\r\nMississippi be separated from its sources?  Who shall possess the\r\nterritories?  Suppose these difficulties to be overcome; suppose\r\nthat in peace we should huckster and divide up our nationality,\r\nour flag, our history, all the recollections of the past; suppose\r\nall these difficulties overcome, how can two rival republics of\r\nthe same race of men, divided only by a line of a river for thousands\r\nof miles, and with all the present difficulties aggravated by\r\nseparation, avoid forays, disputes, and war?  How can we travel on\r\nour future march of progress in Mexico, or on the high seas, or on\r\nthe Pacific slope, without collision?  It is impossible.  To\r\npeacefully accomplish such results we must change the nature of\r\nman.  Disunion is war!  God knows, I do not threaten it, for I will\r\nseek to prevent it in every way possible.  I speak but the logic\r\nof facts, which we should not conceal from each other.  It is either\r\nhostilities between the government and the seceding states; or, if\r\nseparation is yielded peaceably, it is a war of factions--a rivalry\r\nof insignificant communities, hating each other, and contemned by\r\nthe civilized world.  If war results, what a war it will be!\r\nContemplate the north and south, in hostile array against each\r\nother.  If these sections do not know each other _now_ they will\r\n_then_.\r\n\r\n\"We are a nation of miliary men, naturally turbulent because we\r\nare free, accustomed to arms, ingenious, energetic, brave and\r\nstrong.  The same qualities that have enabled a single generation\r\nof men to develop the resources of a continent, would enable us to\r\ndestroy more rapidly than we have constructed.  It is idle for\r\nindividuals of either section to suppose themselves superior in\r\nmilitary power.  The French and English tried that question for a\r\nthousand years.  We ought to know it now.  The result of the contest\r\nwould not depend upon the first blow of the first year, but blood\r\nshed in civil war will yield its baleful fruit for generations.\r\n\r\n\"How can we avert a calamity at which humanity and civilization\r\nshudder?  I know no way but to cling to the government framed by\r\nour fathers, to administer it in a spirit of kindness, but in all\r\ncases, without partiality, to enforce the laws.  No state can\r\nrelease us from the duty of obeying the laws.  The ordinance or\r\nact of a state is no defense for treason, nor does it lessen the\r\nmoral guilt of that crime.  Let us cling to each other in the hope\r\nthat our differences will pass away, as they often have in times\r\npast.  For the sake of peace, for the love of civil liberty, for\r\nthe honor of our name, our race, our religion, let us preserve the\r\nUnion, loving it better as the clouds grow darker.  I am willing\r\nto unite with any man, whatever may have been his party relations,\r\nwhatever may be his views of the existing differences, who is\r\nwilling to rely on the constitution, as it is, for his rights; and\r\nwho is willing to maintain and defend the Union under all circumstances,\r\nagainst all enemies, at home or abroad.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, gentlemen, for writing you so fully.  I feel restrained,\r\nby the custom of the House of Representatives, from engaging there\r\nin political debate; and yet I feel it is the duty of every citizen\r\nto prepare his countrymen for grave events, that will test the\r\nstrength and integrity of the government.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that our only safety is in a firm enforcement of the\r\nlaws, and that Mr. Lincoln will execute that duty without partiality,\r\nI join my hearty congratulation with yours that he is so soon to\r\nbe President of the United States.

O'Neill, _Committee_.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading events in the progressive secession may be briefly\r\nstated.  The States of South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida,\r\nLouisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nand Virginia, severally in the order named, adopted ordinances of\r\nsecession.  Each of them committed acts of war against the United\r\nStates.  They seized forts, navy yards, arsenals, customhouses,\r\npost offices and other public buildings of the United States.\r\nSouth Carolina, on the 27th of December, 1860, seized Fort Moultrie\r\nand Castle Pinckney, a light-house tender, and a schooner.  On the\r\n31st, she took possession of the United States arsenal, post office,\r\nand customhouse in Charleston, the arsenal containing seventy\r\nthousand stand of arms and other stores.  On the 9th of January,\r\n1861, she took possession of the steamer \"Marion\" at Charleston,\r\nand on that day the \"Star of the West\" was fired upon.\r\n\r\nGeorgia, on the second day of January, 1861, took possession of\r\nForts Pulaski and Jackson and the United States arsenal.  On the\r\n12th of January, she took possession of the arsenal at Augusta,\r\ncontaining howitzers, cannon, muskets and large stores of powder,\r\nball and grape.  On the same day she seized the United States\r\nsteamer \"Ida.\"  On the 8th of February, she took possession of all\r\nthe money received from customs.  On the 21st, she seized three\r\nNew York vessels at Savannah.  Florida, on the 12th of January,\r\n1861, took possession of the navy yards at Forts Barrancas and\r\nMcRae; also the Chattahoochie arsenal, containing 800,000 cartridges\r\nof different patterns and 50,000 pounds of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nAlabama took possession of Fort Morgan, the Mount Vernon arsenal,\r\nsome pieces of cannon, and large amounts of munitions of war.  She\r\ntook possession also of the revenue cutter \"Lewis Cass.\"\r\n\r\nMississippi, on the 20th of January, seized the fort at Ship Island\r\nand the United States hospital on the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January, Louisiana took possession of Forts Jackson,\r\nSt. Philip, and Pike, and the arsenal at Baton Rouge containing\r\nfifty thousand small arms, twenty heavy pieces of ordnance, three\r\nhundred barrels of powder and other military supplies.  On the\r\n28th, she took possession of all commissary and quartermaster stores\r\nin the possession of the United States officials within her borders.\r\nOn the first of February, she seized the mint and customhouse\r\ncontaining $599,303 in gold and silver.\r\n\r\nTexas, on the 20th of February, took Forts Chadbourne and Belknap\r\nwith all the property of the Overland Mail Company.  On the 25th,\r\nGeneral Twiggs, an officer of the army of the United States,\r\ntraitorously surrendered all government stores in his command,\r\nestimated at $1,300,000 in value, including money and specie, thirty-\r\nfive thousand stand of arms, twenty-six pieces of mountain artillery,\r\nand other military stores.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, she seized the revenue cutter \"Dodge\" and Fort\r\nBrown.\r\n\r\nArkansas seized the arsenal at Little Rock, containing nine thousand\r\nsmall arms, forty cannon, and a quantity of ammunition.\r\n\r\nVirginia, according to the statement of Governor Letcher, would\r\nhave seized Fortress Monroe, but that it was firmly held by national\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThese were some of the acts of war committed by the seceding states\r\nbefore the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nWhat was done by the administration of James Buchanan to meet these\r\nacts of war?  The answer to this question is a most painful confession\r\nof feebleness, vacillation and dishonor.  It was shown conclusively\r\nthat Floyd, the Secretary of War, during 1860 transferred from\r\nSpringfield and other armories to southern arsenals 65,000 percussion\r\nmuskets, 40,000 altered muskets and 10,000 rifles.  On the 20th of\r\nOctober, he ordered 40 columbiads and four 32 pounders to be sent\r\nfrom the arsenal to the Fort, at Galveston in Texas, the building\r\nof which had hardly been commenced.  It was shown by a report of\r\na committee of the House that the vessels of the United States were\r\ndispersed by the Secretary of the Navy to distant ports, for the\r\npurpose of preventing their use in the defense of the property of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile \"Advertiser\" said:\r\n\r\n\"During the past year, 135,430 muskets have been quietly transferred\r\nfrom the northern arsenal at Springfield alone, to those in the\r\nsouthern states.  We are much obliged to Secretary Floyd for the\r\nforesight he has thus displayed in disarming the north and _equipping\r\nthe south for this emergency_.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, on January 9, 1860, in introducing into the Senate\r\na bill to authorize the sale of public arms to the several states\r\nand territories, significantly said:  \"There are a number of\r\nvolunteer companies wanting to purchase arms, but the states have\r\nnot a sufficient supply.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill was agreed to by the Senate by a party vote, yeas 28,\r\nnays 18.  In the House the bill was never reported.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan, in his annual message at the beginning of the 2nd\r\nsession of the 36th Congress, announced the startling doctrine that\r\na state could not be coerced by the general government, and said:\r\n\r\n\"After much serious reflection, I have arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat no such power has been delegated to Congress nor to any other\r\ndepartment of the federal government.  It is manifest, upon an\r\ninspection of the constitution, that this is not among the specific\r\nand enumerated powers granted to Congress; and it is equally apparent\r\nthat its exercise is not 'necessary and proper for carrying into\r\nexecution' any one of these powers.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he says:\r\n\r\n\"Without descending to particulars, it may be safely asserted that\r\nthe power to make war against a state is at variance with the whole\r\nspirit and intent of the constitution. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, that our Union rests upon public opinion, and can\r\nnever be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war.\r\nIf it cannot live in the affections of the people it must one day\r\nperish.  Congress possesses many means of preserving it by\r\nconciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hand to preserve\r\nit by force.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, if acquiesced in, would leave the United States\r\nutterly powerless to preserve its own life, whatever might be the\r\nexigencies, even against the most insignificant state in the Union.\r\nIt was manifest that while Buchanan remained President, and Commander-\r\nin-Chief of the army and navy, it was utterly futile to resist the\r\nsecession of the least of these states, or even to protect the\r\npublic property in them.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, 1860, the House of Representatives organized\r\nwhat is known as the \"committee of thirty-three,\" of which Mr.\r\nCorwin, of Ohio, was chairman.  So much of the President's message\r\nas related to the perilous condition of the country was referred\r\nto it.  Propositions of all kinds were sent to the committee, but\r\nthe final result was, as anticipated, a disagreement upon all the\r\nmeasures proposed.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, 1861, Mr. Crittenden offered his celebrated\r\nresolutions, proposing certain amendments to the constitution of\r\nthe United States, in relation to slavery, but they were rejected\r\nin the Senate and were not acted upon in the House.\r\n\r\nA peace conference was held at Washington, at the request of the\r\nlegislature of Virginia, composed of delegates from the several\r\nstates appointed by the governors thereof.  John Tyler was president\r\nand Thomas Ewing, of Ohio, was one of the most active and influential\r\nmembers of the conference.  It sat during nearly all the month of\r\nFebruary and recommended seven articles of amendment to the\r\nconstitution.  These propositions were adopted by the conference\r\nand reported to the Senate on the 2nd of March, and were rejected\r\nby a vote of 3 yeas and 34 nays.  Subsequently they were again\r\noffered by Mr. Crittenden and rejected by a vote of 7 yeas and 28\r\nnays.  They were presented to the House on the 1st of March, 1861,\r\nand were there rejected.\r\n\r\nA Senate committee of 13 was organized on the 18th of December,\r\n1860, to consider the condition of the country, but its report was\r\ndisagreed to by the Senate.  Many other propositions of adjustment\r\nwere made both in the Senate and House, but none of them were agreed\r\nto.  Not only were no measures adopted to prevent secession, but\r\nit was proposed by Mr. Mason, that, to avoid the possibility of a\r\nconflict between the forces of the army and navy and of the seceding\r\nstates, all the laws providing for the use of the army in aid of\r\nthe civil authorities in executing the laws of the United States,\r\nshould be suspended and made inoperative in those states.  These\r\nwere the laws passed during the term of President Jackson and, at\r\nhis earnest request, to enable the government to enforce the laws\r\nof the United States against the opposition of the State of South\r\nCarolina.  It was a striking presentation of the difference between\r\nGeneral Jackson and James Buchanan.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter, of Virginia, proposed to retrocede to the seceding\r\nstates, the property of the United States.  The last act of Jefferson\r\nDavis was to offer a joint resolution providing:\r\n\r\n\"That upon the application of a state, either through a convention\r\nor legislature thereof, asking that the federal forces of the army\r\nand navy may be withdrawn from its limits, the President of the\r\nUnited States shall order the withdrawal of the federal garrisons,\r\nand take the needful security for the safety of the public property\r\nwhich may remain in said state.\r\n\r\n\"That whenever a state convention, duly and lawfully assembled,\r\nshall enact that the safety of the state requires it to keep troops\r\nand ships of war, the President of the United States be, and he is\r\nhereby authorized and directed to recognize the exercise of that\r\npower by the state, and by proclamation to give notice of the fact\r\nfor the information and government of all parties concerned.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February, 1861, Burton Craige, of North Carolina,\r\noffered a joint resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States be, and is hereby required\r\nto acknowledge the independence of said government (The Confederacy\r\nof the United States South) as soon as he is informed officially\r\nof its establishment; and that he receive such envoy, ambassador,\r\nor commissioner as may or shall be appointed by said government\r\nfor the purpose of amicably adjusting the matters in dispute with\r\nsaid government.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the hopeless condition of the United States in the last\r\nmonths of the administration of James Buchanan.  It would appear\r\nfrom the resolute action of the seceding states, their union as\r\nConfederate States, the hopeless imbecility of the President of\r\nthe United States, the presence of the seceded traitors in both\r\nhouses of Congress, the weakness and feebleness of that body, left\r\nbut little hope for the preservation of the Union.  The future\r\npresaged a civil war, and opened up a dark prospect, a discouraging\r\nexample for future republics, but the 4th of March came, and a new\r\nlife was infused into the national councils.\r\n\r\nThe second session of the 36th Congress commenced on the 3rd day\r\nof December.  The message of the President I have already commented\r\nupon.  It was regarded as a feeble wail of despair, an absolute\r\nabnegation of the powers of the general government.  No expectation\r\nor hope was indulged in that the President would do any act or say\r\nany word to arrest or delay the flagrant treason, then being\r\ncommitted in South Carolina.  \"After me the deluge\" was written on\r\nevery page of his message.  Our only hope was in the good time\r\ncoming, when, at the close of his term, he would retire to private\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHaving charge of the appropriation bills as chairman of the committee\r\nof ways and means, of the 36th Congress, I was only solicitous to\r\nsecure the passage of these bills, so that the new administration\r\nwould have money to meet the current wants of the government.\r\nWithin a few days, all these bills were reported, and were pushed\r\nforward and passed at an early period of the session.,\r\n\r\nI purposely postpone consideration of the financial condition of\r\nthe United States during this session so as to consider it in\r\nconnection with the measures adopted at the called session in July,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was almost constantly occupied in\r\nconsidering and rejecting the many schemes \"to save the country,\"\r\nalready referred to.  The only political speech I made was in reply\r\nto an ingenious speech of my colleague, George H. Pendleton, made\r\non the 18th day of January, 1861.  I replied on the same day without\r\npreparation, but with a lively appreciation of the dangers before\r\nus.  As I believe that it states fully and fairly the then condition\r\nof the impending revolution, I insert extracts from it here:\r\n\r\n\"I have listened with respect and attention to all that has fallen\r\nfrom my colleague.  Much that he has said I approve; but it seems\r\nto me that instead of appealing to this side of the House for\r\nconciliation, kindness and forbearance, he should appeal to those\r\naround him, who alone, provoke the excitement now prevailing in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\"He says the army should not be used to coerce a state.  If by this\r\nhe means that the army should not be used to conquer a state, to\r\ncompel her to be represented, to maintain the courts or post offices\r\nwithin her limits, to burn her cities or desolate her fields, he\r\nis entirely correct.  I do not believe any administration will\r\npursue such a policy.  But, sir, we have a government, a great\r\ngovernment, to maintain.  It is supreme within the powers delegated\r\nto it; and it is provided with ample authority to protect itself\r\nagainst foreign or domestic enemies.  It has the exclusive right\r\nto collect duties on imports.  It is the exclusive owners of forts,\r\narsenals, navy yards, vessels, and munitions of war.  It has a\r\nflag, the symbol of its nationality, the emblem of its power and\r\ndetermination, to protect all those who may of right gather under\r\nits folds.  It is our duty, as the representatives of this government,\r\nto maintain and defend it in the exercise of its just powers.  Has\r\nit trespassed upon the rights of a single individual?  Does any\r\ncitizen of South Carolina allege that this government has done him\r\nwrong?  No man can say that.  The government for years has been in\r\nthe hands of the Democratic party, whose power and patronage have\r\nbeen controlled chiefly by southern citizens; and now, when the\r\nRepublican party is about to assume the reins, these citizens seek\r\nto subvert it.  They organize revolution under the name of\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\n\"What have they done?  The State of South Carolina has seized the\r\ncustomhouse in the city of Charleston, has closed that port, and\r\nprevented the United States from the exercise of their conceded\r\nexclusive power of collecting the revenue from imports.  It has\r\ntaken, by force, money from the treasury of the United States, and\r\napplied it to its own use.  It has seized the arms and munitions of\r\nwar of the United States deposited in arsenals within the conceded\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and turned them against\r\nthe army of the United States.  It has seized a loyal citizen of\r\nthe United States engaged in the discharge of his duty, imprisoned\r\nhim, and threatened his life, for the exercise of a plain constitutional\r\nduty, charging him with treason against the State of South Carolina.\r\nIt has taken citizens of different states rightfully and peacefully\r\nattending to their business, insulted them, inflicted the most\r\ndegrading indignities upon them, and then forcibly expelled them.\r\nIt has raised a military force of artillery, cavalry, and infantry,\r\nwith the avowed purpose of expelling, or, to use their own chosen\r\nword, coercing, the United States from the forts, arsenals, and\r\nother property of the United States.  When Major Anderson removed\r\nfrom Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, it seized Fort Moultrie, Fort\r\nPinckney, and other property of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"More recently they fired upon a vessel in the employ of the United\r\nStates, conveying reinforcements and provisions to our troops.  In\r\nthis act of war, they used the cannon and munitions of war paid\r\nfor out of our treasury.  Forts ceded by the State of South Carolina\r\nto the United States were used to expel a vessel of the United\r\nStates in the pursuit of its lawful commerce. WHen the 'star-spangled\r\nbanner' was hoisted to her mast-head, as a sign of nationality,\r\nappealing to all the patriotic recollections which cluster around\r\nit--your flag, my flag, the flag of Virginia, of Ohio, of Kentucky,\r\nof Massachusetts, the flag of every state and of the whole Union,\r\nthe rustle of whose folds has so often excited the pride and\r\npatriotic ardor of Americans in every part of the habitable globe\r\n--that flag, invoked for the protection of an unarmed vessel,\r\ncarrying provisions to our own troops, was fired upon and dishonored.\r\nAn act of war by citizens of the United States, and therefore an\r\nact of treason, was applauded by officers and citizens of that\r\nstate, and perhaps by those of other states.  It was not an act of\r\nwar against you and me merely, but against every loyal and patriotic\r\ncitizen of this great republic.  Up to that moment we had done\r\nnothing.  This government had been more forbearing, more quiet,\r\nmore complacent, under this series of offenses, than any government\r\ninstituted since the foundation of governments.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mr. chairman, the same lawless violence is breaking out\r\nin other parts of the country.  Forts, arsenals, navy yards, and\r\nvessels of war, intrusted without defense to the patriotism of the\r\npeople, have, upon one pretext or another, been seized, and are\r\nnow held by lawless force.  Upon the recommendation of Members of\r\nCongress, Fort Pulaski was seized by troops, under an order from\r\nthe Governor of Georgia.  I suppose there is not a Member upon the\r\nopposite side who will declare that it would be given up peacefully\r\nto the troops of the United States if it were demanded by our\r\nnational authorities.  More recently still, the navy yard at\r\nPensacola was taken by an armed force, under the order of the\r\nGovernor of Florida.  I have here a telegraphic dispatch sent to\r\nthis government:\r\n\r\n'_January 12, 1861_.--Commissioners appointed by the Governor of\r\nFlorida with a regiment of armed men at the gate, demanded the\r\nsurrender of this navy yard, having previously taken possession of\r\none of the magazines.  I surrendered the place and struck my flag\r\nat half-past one o'clock, p. m., this day.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. chairman, suppose Great Britain, suppose France, suppose all\r\nthe powers of the world combined, had thus outraged the flag of\r\nthe United States; would not every one of us have demanded men and\r\nmoney to wipe out the indignity, and to repel further like assaults,\r\nat whatever hand?  Yet, sir, the Governor of Florida, before the\r\nState of Florida had seceded, goes with an armed force, seizes upon\r\nour property, and turns the guns of the people of the United States\r\nagainst the army and the navy of the United States.  I am also told\r\n--with what truth I do not know--that cannon are planted upon the\r\nbanks of the Mississippi River, at or near the city of Vicksburg,\r\nin the State of Mississippi, and that our steamboats are now\r\ncompelled to land there and to give an account of themselves.  We\r\ndo not know at what moment they may be subject to tribute and\r\nseizure.  To whom?  To the State of Mississippi?  I agree with all\r\nmy colleagues from the State of Ohio, from both sides of the House,\r\nthat there is one thing immutable--a law that is a higher law.  It\r\nis, that the Mississippi River, gathering all the rivulets of the\r\nnorthwest into one current, must be permitted to float our commerce,\r\nuninterrupted and untrammeled, to the sea, or thousands of men will\r\nfloat down upon its waters and make it free.\r\n\r\n\"No one doubts, I suppose, that the forts at the mouth of the\r\nMississippi are in the possession, not of the troops of the United\r\nStates, but troops that will resist the troops of the United States.\r\nThere is no doubt that Baton Rouge has been seized; no doubt, sir,\r\nthat act after act of war has been repeated.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you, as the representative of a brave people, what shall we\r\ndo?  The question is not, shall we coerce a state? but shall we\r\nnot defend the property of the United States against all enemies,\r\nat home and abroad, here or wherever the flag of our country floats?\r\nMust this government submit to insult and indignity?  Must it\r\nsurrender its property, its flag, its nationality?  Do you, gentlemen\r\nfrom Virginia, whose great statesman had so large a share in laying\r\nthe foundations of our government, desire to see it thus dishonored?\r\nAre you ready to join excited men, who will not listen to reason;\r\nwho even spurn your patriotism as timidity; who reject your counsels,\r\nand who would drag you as unwilling victims at the heel of their\r\ncar of juggernaut, crushing under its weight all hope of civil\r\nliberty for ages to come?  Are you aroused into madness by political\r\ndefeat?\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it was but the other day that I was told by a distinguished\r\ncitizen of an absolute monarchy--and the remark made a deep impression\r\non my mind--that he deplored the events now transacting around us;\r\nthat he deplored what he considered the inevitable fall of this\r\nrepublic, but, said he, one good will result from it; it will stop\r\nforever the struggle for free institutions in Europe; it will\r\nestablish upon a secure basis the existing governments of the Old\r\nWorld.  I felt that the remark was true.  If this government cannot\r\nsurvive a constitutional election; if it cannot defend its property\r\nand protect our flag; if this government crumbles before the first\r\nsign of disaffection, what hope is there for free institutions in\r\ncountries where kings and nobles and marshals and hereditary\r\ninstitutions and laws of primogeniture have existed for ages?  Sir,\r\nwhen the masses of any people, inspired by the love of country,\r\nhave demanded in modern times the right of self-government, they\r\nhave been pointed to France with its revolution of 1798, to South\r\nAmerica, where changing republics rise and disappear so rapidly\r\nthat not ten men in this House can tell me their names, and also\r\nto Mexico.  God forbid that the despots of the Old World should\r\never adorn their infernal logic by pointing to a disrupted Union\r\nhere!  It is said, with a poet's license, that--\r\n\r\n  'Freedom shrieked as Kosciusko fell.'\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, freedom will die with the fall of this republic, and\r\nthe survivors of the calamity will find springing into existence\r\nmilitary despotisms north, south, east and west.  Instead of two\r\ndivisions, there will be many divisions.  The condition of this\r\ncountry will be worse than that of Mexico, because we are a braver,\r\na more powerful, people, who will fight each other with greater\r\ntenacity.  If this republic is dissolved, the man now lives who\r\nwill be the Napoleon of some section thereof.  All history teaches\r\nus that whenever a free government is disrupted a military despotism\r\nof force is substituted for the will of the people; and we have no\r\nright to suppose that our country will be an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the Representatives of the border states to arrest\r\nthe progress of this storm for a little time, at least.  Let us\r\nsee whether there is any hope for peace and conciliation.  If there\r\nis not, then, if we cannot agree, let us fight; but if we can agree,\r\nlet us do it like men, and not be hurried off by wild and insane\r\nfeelings of rage and disappointment, by the weakest state in this\r\nconfederacy.  Sirs, if you do calm this storm, peace will again\r\nsmile upon our country.  If you do not, I see nothing but civil\r\nwar before us.  My colleague may paint in beautiful language the\r\nblessings of peace; and cry 'peace! peace!' when there is no peace;\r\nbut, Mr. chairman, you and I see already rising in the west, where\r\nmilitary feeling is so rife, a spirit which will not brook much\r\nlonger the insults already cast upon the flag of our country.  I\r\ndo not threaten, for I dread--nor for you or me, or the Members of\r\nthis House, for I suppose we have the ordinary courage of our race,\r\nand we are but atoms in the storm--but thousands and millions of\r\nmen, like us, will regret the day when this government was hurried\r\ninto revolution, without opportunity for parley or delay.\r\n\r\n\"If your people will not aid the government in maintaining the\r\npublic property in the seceding states, then we must do it in spite\r\nof you, or perish in the attempt.  We must not allow the government\r\nto crumble at our feet.  You can arrest this movement, and you\r\nalone can do it.  I ask you, gentlemen from Virginia and the south,\r\ndoes not your blood boil with indignation when you read of the\r\nsurrender of our forts and the dishonor of our flag?  Are they not\r\nyours as well as mine?  Has the feeling of sectionalism become\r\nstronger than love of country?  I ask if the same patriotism which\r\nbrought your fathers and mine into common battlefields, amid all\r\nthe storms of the Revolution, does not now rebel when you are forced\r\ninto a civil war by the madness of a few men in the southern states?\r\nSir, I do not believe it.  For the moment, under the smart of\r\nimaginary wrongs, under the disappointment of political defeat,\r\nyour people may be hurried into acts of madness; but when returning\r\nreason comes, woe be to them who have led them astray!  Then a\r\nsingle wave of the star-spangled banner will silence the miserable\r\nparty cries with which you have misled them.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not deceive ourselves with the idea that this government\r\ncan be broken up on Mason and Dixon's line, or upon any other line,\r\nwithout involving us in all we dread.  There is no man, with a head\r\nto reason and a heart to feel, who does not shudder at the idea of\r\ncivil war.  Do you suppose that this government can be divided into\r\ntwo, according to the plan of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.\r\nGarnett), with this capitol, with the mouth of the Mississippi,\r\nwith the territories, and a thousand things that unite us, without\r\nprovoking civil war?  Why, sir, we may do all we can to prevent\r\nit; we may throw ourselves into the breach; we may stand up and\r\nyield everything, or cringe down and yield everything; but I tell\r\nyou that will not stop the surging waves.  If this government is\r\ndivided, though we may agree to separate in peace--though every\r\nman here may sign the bond--we know that events hurriedly running\r\nforward will bring these two sections in hostile array against each\r\nother; and then, what a war is there, my countrymen!  I know that\r\nyour southern people are brave, spirited, active, quick; no man\r\ndoubts that; but if you have made any misapprehension about the\r\nnorthern people--if you suppose that, because they are cold, because\r\nthey are not fired by your hot blood, they will not perform their\r\nduty everywhere, you are very much mistaken.  We are the equals of\r\neach other; we are of the same blood, the same parentage, the same\r\ncharacter; your warm sun has quickened your blood, but our cold\r\nclimate has steadied our intellects and braced our energies.\r\n\r\n\"I again repeat, Mr. chairman, that we should not allow ourselves\r\nto be deceived by words.  The question is not whether the United\r\nStates will coerce a state, but whether a state shall coerce the\r\ngovernment; whether this noble fabric, devised by our fathers,\r\nshall fall without a blow.  I appeal to you again; I appeal to the\r\nRepresentatives of all the states, whether we shall allow Fort\r\nSumter, the only place where our flag floats in the harbor of\r\nCharleston, to be surrendered at discretion.\r\n\r\n\"For one, I say, NEVER! NEVER!  Even if to-morrow I should vote to\r\ngive South Carolina license to leave the confederacy, if I had the\r\npower, yet, while that flag floats, it is the bounden and sacred\r\nduty of this government to protect it against all enemies, and at\r\nall hazards.  I had fondly hoped, while we disagreed, and while I\r\nknew that our disagreement was marked and decided, that you,\r\ngentlemen of the south, would yourselves take the lead in the\r\ndefense of our property and our honor; therefore I sat silent.  I\r\nhad hoped that, while we were discussing, you would insist upon\r\nthe protection of the property of the United States, and that our\r\nflag should not be dishonored until we separated, in peace or in\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"I was much struck by a remark made the other day by the honorable\r\nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Davis), that if we could not agree\r\nwith each other, we ought to separate in peace--that we should take\r\nthis old flag, and fold it away, and keep it as a much-loved memento\r\nfor us all.  But, sir, we cannot do that now.  It has been lowered\r\nand tarnished, and we all know and feel it.\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised that my colleague (Mr. Pendleton) did not vote\r\nfor the resolution offered by the gentleman from New Jersey, in\r\nregard to Major Anderson.  I hoped that the Ohio delegation would\r\nunite in favor of the resolution.  I was still more surprised,\r\nallow me to say to the Representatives of Kentucky, that when their\r\nown gallant son had but performed his bounden duty they should have\r\nrefused to vote to sustain him in his removal from Fort Moultrie\r\nto the strongest point in his command.\r\n\r\n\"The resolution simply expressed a desire to enforce the laws and\r\nto preserve the Union--no more.  I am willing to stand on this\r\nplatform.  I can join heartily with all those who made that pledge,\r\nwhatever else they may think or believe about the questions that\r\ndivide our people.  If we can stand by each other, if our constituents\r\nwill stand by us in that emphatic declaration, I do believe the\r\ngood ship that has borne us thus far on a prosperous voyage will\r\noutlive the storm.  But, sir, if we yield too far to the fury of\r\nthe waves; if we now surrender, without resistance, the forts,\r\narsenals, dock-yards, and other property of the government, we only\r\ndemonstrate that we are not fit for the duties assigned us; and,\r\nif our names survive our times, they will only be recorded as those\r\nof a degenerate race, who had not the manhood to preserve what\r\ntheir fathers won.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen cannot come here and say, 'We demand this; or, we demand\r\nthat; stand and deliver.'  That is the language of the highwayman.\r\nThis is a great tribunal, where men reason and judge and weigh and\r\ndoubt and hesitate and talk--and we have a good deal of that.  No\r\nsection and no state can, because the presidential election has\r\ngone against it, say, 'We will have this change in the constitution,\r\nor we will fire upon your flag; we will have that change in the\r\nconstitution, or we will seize upon your forts.'  That is not the\r\nprinciple upon which this government was founded.  Mr. Jefferson,\r\nwhen elected President in 1801, declared the true principle.  He\r\nsaid it was the duty of all good citizens to obey the constitution;\r\nto submit to a constitutional election; and he congratulated the\r\ncountry that the Federalists were willing to give the Democrats a\r\nfair trial. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Under the grave responsibility upon which we are acting, I feel\r\nit to be my duty to you, my fellow Members, and to my countrymen,\r\nnorth and south, to say frankly, that, in voting for this army\r\nbill, I vote with the expectation that the army will be used in\r\nprotecting the acknowledged property of the United States, in\r\nrecovering that which has been unlawfully taken, and in maintaining\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\"It may be said that the gravity of the events that surround us\r\ndemands a greater force than is provided by this bill.  The regular\r\narmy is a mere skeleton.  The present force will scarcely defend\r\nour frontier from Indian incursions; but it forms a nucleus capable\r\nof any re-enforcement demanded by the exigencies of the times.  I\r\ndo not contemplate, in any event, hostile invasions of the soil of\r\nany state, unless demanded for the defense of the acknowledged\r\nproperty of the United States.  It is the duty of the government\r\nto suppress insurrection in a state; but in this event the military\r\npower can only be used in strict subordination to the civil authority.\r\nIf the civil authority refuse to call for such aid, or suppress\r\nthe courts, the military power cannot interfere.  If the courts\r\nare closed, the duties of postmasters must necessarily be suspended.\r\nNo doubt this measure will soon be adopted.  If the revenue is\r\nrefused, or cannot be collected, then goods cannot be imported,\r\nand ports must be closed.  If a state shall, in violation of the\r\nconstitution, undertake to regulate commerce, then her commerce\r\nmust be suspended.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt other measures can be devised that will preserve the\r\npeace of the country until the people of the states may confer in\r\na constitutional way, unless one or more of the seceding states\r\nshall, by military force, shed the blood of their fellow-citizens,\r\nor refuse to surrender to the proper authorities the acknowledged\r\nproperty of the government.  I know that all the gentlemen around\r\nme must deeply deplore a civil war, especially if that war shall\r\ninvolve the fate of this capital and the disruption of the government.\r\nNo man can contemplate the inevitable results of such a war without\r\nthe most serious desire to avert it.  It is our duty as Members of\r\nthe House, it is the duty of Congress, I am happy to say it is now\r\nthe acknowledged duty of the President, as it is of the incoming\r\nadministration, to use forbearance to the extremest point.  Let\r\nnot physical force be arrayed in civil war until the last hope of\r\npeace and conciliation has been exhausted; then let each branch of\r\nthe government, acting in concert with each other, perform its\r\nrespective duties, though the heavens fall!\r\n\r\n\"What can we do for peace and conciliation?  I anticipate at once\r\nyour reply; you say, 'Let us compromise; yield what we demand of\r\nyou.  Let us compromise, and we will preserve the Union; civil war\r\nwill be averted.'  This, I know, is the earnest appeal of patriotic\r\nmen in the southern states, who would gladly give their lives to\r\nstop the march of treason in those states.  How useless it is to\r\ntalk about compromises, concessions, conciliation, adjustment,\r\nwhen, if everything was conceded, the integrity of the government\r\nmay be broken up by a majority of a single state.  If we hold this\r\nUnion, and all the rights it secures to us, and all the hopes we\r\nhave upon it, upon the whim or will of a single state, then, indeed,\r\nit is the weakest government ever devised by man.  If a single\r\nstate may destroy our nationality, then, indeed, is the wisdom of\r\nour fathers the wisdom of babes.  We can no longer talk about the\r\nweakness of the old confederacy or anarchy of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we owe it as the most sacred of duties to put down this\r\nheresy.  If it now fortifies itself by sectional animosities, if\r\nit rises from party rebellion to sectional and civil war, still it\r\nmust, and will, be met with determined resistance.  Upon this point,\r\nI am glad to say, the people of Ohio are united, if the unanimous\r\nvoice of the legislature of that state is a true indication.\r\n\r\n\"Again, I say, what is the use of concession, conciliation, or\r\ncompromise, when, if we yield everything you demand, you cannot\r\nsay to us 'It will save us from disunion or war?'  Are we not in\r\ndanger of quarreling about terms of conciliation, when traitors\r\nare overthrowing the government we wish to preserve?  Are we not\r\ndividing ourselves for their benefit?  What will satisfy South\r\nCarolina and Florida and Mississippi and Alabama?  They want\r\ndisunion, and not compromise or conciliation.  The Democratic party\r\nwould not agree to their terms, and they seceded from the Charleston\r\nand Baltimore conventions.  Is it likely that we will yield what\r\nour northern Democratic friends could not yield?  Can you expect\r\nthis 'black Republican party,' as you please to call it, will yield\r\nto you what your northern Democratic associates dare not?  It is\r\nutterly idle to talk about any such terms of concession.  I do not\r\nbelieve any terms which our people could yield, and preserve their\r\nown self-respect, would satisfy South Carolina, Florida, or some\r\nof the other southern states, because they are bent upon disunion.\r\n\r\n\"We know that gentlemen who represented South Carolina on this\r\nfloor, if the newspapers correctly report them, declared in the\r\nCharleston convention, held recently, that they had brooded over\r\nthis matter for long years, and that they only sought an opportunity,\r\nan occasion, or, if I may use the word, a pretext, for the secession\r\nof the State of South Carolina and the disruption of the Union.\r\nSome stated that they had brooded over disunion and prayed for its\r\nconsummation since boyhood.  We know, sir, that the seeds of this\r\nrevolution were sowed in the time of Andrew Jackson and John C.\r\nCalhoun.  We know that in 1832 the doctrines upon which this\r\nrevolution is going forward were initiated, and from that time the\r\nyoung men of South Carolina have been educated in the school of\r\ndisunion.  They have cherished these doctrines in their innermost\r\nhearts.  All the concessions we might make, all the compromises we\r\ncould agree to, all the offerings of peace we could make for the\r\nsalvation of the Union, would not be able to secure the desired\r\nend, if South Carolina could prevent it.\r\n\r\n\"Again, we might, on this side, properly say we have done nothing\r\nto impair any constitutional right.  We propose to do nothing to\r\ninfringe yours.  We have succeeded in a constitutional way in\r\nelecting a President of the United States.  All we ask is that he\r\nmay be inaugurated in peace, and may develop his policy in the\r\nusual manner.  We can add that this is the demand of all our people,\r\nnot only of those who voted for Mr. Lincoln, but of every loyal\r\ncitizen.  You tell us your people are excited and alarmed, that\r\nthey apprehend that an overwhelming anti-slavery element is about\r\nto be inaugurated in power that will, directly or indirectly, affect\r\nthe constitutional rights of your states.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you will confess, what you know to be true, that for\r\npolitical purposes, in the struggle of partisans for ascendancy,\r\nboth parties in the south have united to fire the southern mind\r\nagainst the hated 'black Republicans' of the north.  Speeches have\r\nbeen distorted, single sentences have been torn from their context\r\nand made to deceive and mislead.  Garrison, Wendell Phillips,\r\nSeward, Lincoln and latterly Douglas, have been mixed in a hated\r\nconglomerate, and used to excite your people.  A philosophic opinion\r\nof Mr. Seward has been construed as the statement of a settled\r\npurpose to overthrow slavery in the states, although in the very\r\nparagraph itself all idea of interference by the people of the free\r\nstates with slavery in the slave states is expressly excluded.  It\r\nis but a year since you inflamed your constituents because some of\r\nyour fellow-Members recommended, without reading, a book written\r\nby one of your own citizens, containing obnoxious opinions about\r\nslavery.  Nearly all of you gave birth, vitality, and victory to\r\nthe Republican party, by adopting a policy you now join in condemning.\r\nSome of you broke down the only political organization that could\r\ncompete with us, and thus gave us an easy victory.  You have all\r\ncontributed, more or less, in perverting the public mind as to our\r\nprinciples and purposes.  And I tell you, gentlemen, that when you\r\ncall the Republican party an abolition party, in the sense you use\r\nthe word abolition; when you quote from Garrison, Wendell Phillips,\r\nand from like extreme men, and circulate their opinions all over\r\nthe south, telling the people of your states that the people of\r\nthe north have been educated in these sentiments, profess them,\r\nand are going to put down slavery in the states, you do a great\r\ninjustice to the intelligence and the safety of your people.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard here, over and over again, this course of agitation,\r\npursued only the other day in the Senate of the United States.\r\nMr. Douglas quoted from one of the speeches of Mr. Lincoln that\r\npassage so familiar to us all, that, in his opinion, that states\r\nwould at some day be all slave or all free.  Sir, in this time when\r\nthe people of the southern states are in a storm of excitement,\r\nthat speech of the Senator from Illinois is sent over those states\r\nas tending to show that Mr. Lincoln would in some way interfere\r\nwith slavery in the states.  Mr. Lincoln answered this inference\r\nwith a solemn disclaimer over and over again on the same 'stump'\r\nwith that Senator.  I ask whether it was just to quote the opinion\r\nwithout giving the disclaimer?  It certainly was not.  We might\r\nanswer all you say by declaring that the Republican party does not\r\npropose to interfere with your constitutional rights.  I have no\r\ndoubt that the administration of Mr. Lincoln will carry out the\r\ndoctrines of the Chicago platform; but not the platform as you\r\npervert it.  Sir, it will convince the southern people that all\r\nthe things said about us are unfounded.  What, then, will be the\r\nfate of hundreds of politicians in the southern states who have\r\nstirred their people up to the present intense excitement?\r\n\r\n\"Yet the baptism of misrepresentation, through which this Republican\r\nparty has thus far advanced, does not excuse us from doing all in\r\nour power to produce conciliation, harmony, peace, quiet, a fair\r\nand honest adjustment of all the difficulties that surround us. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. chairman, I have gone over the whole field.  I have given\r\nmy views, speaking for no other man, frankly and fearlessly, and\r\nI will stand by them now and in the future.  I have given you my\r\nopinion upon all these points.  I tell you that this whole controversy\r\nwas fought and won by us two years ago, and all you have to do now\r\nis to admit Kansas.  That is the only act of power now needed.\r\nThere let it stand.  Let us live together like a band of brothers.\r\nIf we cannot agree with you about slavery, why, you do not agree\r\nwith us.  I know there has been a great deal of intemperance of\r\nlanguage on this subject; but I ask, if it has been used upon our\r\nside, has it not been used upon yours?  If there has been harsh\r\nand violent words used, I have not uttered them that I know of.\r\nIf I have, I beg every man's pardon; because I think that violent\r\nlanguage, calculated to stir up excitement and agitation, ought\r\nnot be used in a deliberative assembly.  I ask you if you have not\r\nsins to repent of, if we have?  Let us be at peace.  Let us go on\r\nwith the administration of the government kindly, harmoniously,\r\nhopefully, trusting in that providence of Almighty God which has\r\nthus far guided and guarded us, until this nation has become a\r\nmarvel to the world.  Can we not go on in the same way in which we\r\nhave gone on in the past?  Why not let the Republican administration\r\nbe inaugurated in peace and quiet?  Try it in the name of God!\r\nAre you cowards, that you would flee from an apprehension?  I know\r\nyou are not.  Stand by the old ship of state!  Give the Republican\r\nadministration a fair chance.  If it does not do right, you will\r\nfind thousands--ay, millions--in the northern states who will stand\r\nby you.  I believe it will do right.  Give it a trial.  That is\r\nall we ask, and what we demand at all hazards.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegation from Ohio, during this Congress, was regarded as a\r\nvery strong one.  I do not disparage any by a brief reference to\r\na few.\r\n\r\nThomas Corwin was, by far, the most distinguished member of the\r\ndelegation.  I have already referred to his eminence as a popular\r\norator.  His speech against the Mexican War, though unfortunate as\r\na political event, has always been regarded as one of the most\r\neloquent ever made in either House of Congress.  His speech in\r\nreply to Crary, of Michigan, is still remembered as the best specimen\r\nof humorous satire in our language.  He had served in the legislature\r\nof Ohio, as a Member of Congress for ten years, as Governor of\r\nOhio, as a Member of the Senate, and as Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nAfter an absence from public life for six years, he was elected a\r\nMember of the 36th Congress.  Here he was regarded as the \"peacemaker\"\r\nof the House.  In the contest for speaker, he made a long speech,\r\nin which he exhibited marked ability, humor, pathos and persuasive\r\neloquence.  As chairman of the committee of thirty, he did all that\r\nman could do to quiet the storm, to compromise and soothe the\r\ncontending factions, but this was beyond human power.  He was re-\r\nelected to the 37th Congress, but in 1861 was appointed minister\r\nto Mexico by Mr. Lincoln.  In December, 1865, he attended a party\r\nof his Ohio friends, at which I was present.  He was the center of\r\nattraction, and, apparently, in good health and spirits.  He was\r\ntelling amusing anecdotes of life in Ohio \"in the olden times,\" to\r\nthe many friends who gathered around him, when, without warning,\r\nhe suffered a stroke of apoplexy and died within two or three days,\r\nleaving behind him none but friends.  Tom Corwin, \"the wagon-boy,\"\r\nhad traveled through all the gradations of life, and in every stage\r\nwas a kind friend, a loving father, a generous, noble and honest\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe life of George H. Pendleton was a striking contrast to that of\r\nCorwin.  He was a favorite of fortune.  His father was a distinguished\r\nlawyer and a Member of Congress.  George had the advantage of a\r\ngood education and high social position, a courtly manner, a handsome\r\nperson and a good fortune.  He served several terms in the House\r\nof Representatives and six years in the Senate.  He was the candidate\r\nfor Vice President on the Democratic ticket with McClellan, and a\r\nprominent candidate for nomination as President in 1868.  He was\r\nminister to Germany during the first term of Cleveland as President.\r\nHe died November 24, 1889.  My relations with him were always\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nSamuel S. Cox was an active, industrious and versatile Member of\r\nCongress for more than twenty years.  He was born in Ohio, graduated\r\nat Brown University, was admitted to the bar, but, I believe, rarely\r\npracticed his profession.  His natural bent was for editorial and\r\npolitical conflicts, in which most of his life was spent.  He was\r\na good debater, overflowing with humor without sarcasm.  In the\r\ncampaign of 1860, he and I had a running debate at long range.  In\r\na speech at Columbus, then his residence, I spoke of his erratic\r\ncourse on the Lecompton bill.  He replied at Mansfield with\r\nshrewdness, humor and ability.  I reviewed his speech at the same\r\nplace, and we kept up a running fire during that canvass, but this\r\ndid not disturb our friendly relations.  Some years later, he\r\nremoved to New York, where he was soon taken into favor, and was\r\nelected several times to Congress.  He was the author of several\r\nbooks of merit, and was the champion of a measure establishing the\r\nlife-saving service of the country upon its present footing.  He\r\nmay be classified as a leading Member of the House of Representatives,\r\na bright and successful speaker and a copious author.  He died\r\nSeptember 10, 1889.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Bingham was regarded, next to Mr. Corwin, as the most\r\neloquent member of the Ohio delegation, and, perhaps with one or\r\ntwo exceptions, of the House of Representatives.  He studied law\r\nand was admitted to the bar in 1840.  He served for sixteen years\r\nin the House of Representatives on the judiciary and other important\r\ncommittees, and took an active and leading part in all the debates\r\nduring this long period.  He was a man of genial, pleasing address,\r\nrather too much given to flights of oratory, but always a favorite\r\nwith his colleagues and associates.  He was subsequently appointed\r\nUnited States minister to Japan, where he remained for many years.\r\nHe still lives at a ripe old age at Cadiz, Ohio.\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of the 36th Congress, I do not recall any\r\npolitical divisions in the committee of ways and means, unless the\r\ntariff is considered a political measure.  It was not so treated\r\nby the committee.  The common purpose was to secure sufficient\r\nrevenue for the support of the government.  The incidental effect\r\nof all duties was to encourage home manufactures, but, as the rule\r\nadopted was applied impartially to all productions, whether of the\r\nfarm, mine, or the workshop, there was no controversy except as to\r\nthe amount or rate of the duty.  The recent dogma that raw materials\r\nshould not have the benefit of protection did not enter the mind\r\nof anyone.  The necessity of economy limited the amount of\r\nappropriations, but if the war had not changed all conditions, the\r\nrevenues accruing would have been sufficient for an economical\r\nadministration of the government.\r\n\r\nIn a retrospect of my six years as a Member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, I can see, and will freely admit, that my chief\r\nfault was my intense partisanship.  This grew out of a conscientious\r\nfeeling that the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was an act of\r\ndishonor, committed by a dominating party controlled by slaveholders\r\nand yielded to by leading northern Democrats, headed by Douglas,\r\nwith a view on his part to promote his intense ambition to be\r\nPresident of the United States.  I felt that this insult to the\r\nnorth should be resented by the renewed exclusion, by act of\r\nCongress, of slavery north of the line of latitude 36 degrees 30\r\nminutes.  This feeling was intensified by my experience in Kansas\r\nduring the investigation of its affairs.  The recital by the Free\r\nState men of their story, and the appearance and conduct of the\r\n\"border ruffians,\" led me to support extreme measures.  The political\r\nfeebleness of Mr. Buchanan, and the infamy of the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, appeared to me conclusive evidence of the subserviency\r\nof the President and the Supreme Court to the slave power.  The\r\ngross injustice to me personally, and the irritating language of\r\nsouthern Members in the speakership contest, aroused my resentment,\r\nso that in the campaign of 1860 I was ready to meet the threats of\r\nsecession with those of open war.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that the south at this time was largely represented\r\nin Congress by men of the most violent opinions.  Such men as Keitt,\r\nHindman, Barksdale, and Rust, were offensive in their conduct and\r\nlanguage.  They were of that class in the south who believed that\r\nthe people of the north were tradesmen, hucksters, and the like,\r\nand therefore were cowards; that one southern man was equal in a\r\nfight to four northern men; that slavery was a patent of nobility,\r\nand that the owner of slaves was a lord and master.  It is true\r\nthat among the southern Members there were gentlemen of a character\r\nquite different.  Such men as Letcher, Aiken and Bocock entertained\r\nno such opinions, but were courteous and friendly.  But even these\r\nshared in the opinions of their people that, as slavery was recognized\r\nby the constitution, as an institution existing in many of the\r\nstates, it should not be excluded from the common territory of the\r\nUnion, except by the vote of the people of a territory when assuming\r\nthe dignity and power of a state.  It would appear that as in 1860\r\nthe exclusion of slavery from Kansas was definitely settled by the\r\npeople of that state, and that as the only region open to this\r\ncontroversy was New Mexico, from which slavery was excluded by\r\nnatural conditions, there was no reason or ground for an attempt\r\nto disrupt the Union.  In fact, this pretense for secession was\r\nabandoned by South Carolina, and the only ground taken for attempting\r\nit was the election of Mr. Lincoln as President of the United\r\nStates.  If this was conceded to be a just cause for secession,\r\nour government would become a rope of sand; it would be worse than\r\nthat of any South American republic, because our country is more\r\npopulous, and sections of it would have greater strength of attack\r\nand defense.  This pretense for secession would not have been\r\nconcurred in by any of the states north of South Carolina, but for\r\nthe previous agitation of slavery, which had welded nearly all the\r\nslaveholding states into a compact confederacy.  This was done,\r\nnot for fear of Lincoln, but to protect the institution of slavery,\r\nthreatened by the growing sentiment of mankind.  Upon this question\r\nI had been conservative, but I can see now that this contest was\r\nirrepressible, and that I would soon have been in favor of the\r\ngradual abolition of slavery in all the states.  This could not\r\nhave been effected under our constitution but for the Rebellion,\r\nso that, in truth, South Carolina, unwittingly, led to the only\r\nway by which slavery could be abolished in the present century.\r\n\r\nThe existence of slavery in a republic founded upon the declaration\r\nthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their\r\ncreator with certain inalienable rights, and that among them are\r\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, is an anomaly so pregnant\r\nwith evil that it is not strange that while it existed it was the\r\nchief cause of all the serious contentions that threatened the life\r\nof the republic.  The framers of the constitution, finding slavery\r\nin existence in nearly all the states, carefully avoided mention\r\nof it in that instrument, but they provided against the importation\r\nof slaves after a brief period, and evidently anticipated the\r\neventual prohibition of slavery by the voluntary action of the\r\nseveral states.  This process of prohibition occurred until one-\r\nhalf of the states became free, when causes unforeseen made slavery\r\nso profitable that it dominated in the states where it existed,\r\nand dictated the policy of the United States.  The first controversy\r\nabout slavery was happily settled by the Missouri Compromise of\r\n1820.  But a greater danger arose from the acquisition of territory\r\nfrom Mexico.  This, too, was postponed by the compromise of 1850,\r\nbut unhappily, within four years, the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise re-opened the controversy that led to the struggle in\r\nKansas.  Douglas prescribed the doctrine of popular sovereignty.\r\nDavis contended that slaves were property and must be protected by\r\nlaw like other property.  Lincoln declared that \"a house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand,\" that slavery must be lawful or unlawful\r\nin all the states, alike north as well as south.  Seward said that\r\nan irrepressible conflict existed between opposing and enduring\r\nforces, that the United States must and would become either entirely\r\na slaveholding nation or entirely a free labor nation.  Kansas\r\nbecame a free state in spite of Buchanan and then the conflict\r\ncommenced.  The southern states prepared for secession.  Lincoln\r\nbecame President.  The war came by the act of the south and ended\r\nwith the destruction of slavery.  This succession of events,\r\nfollowing in due order, was the natural sequence of the existence\r\nof slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\n  \"God moves in a mysterious way,\r\n   His wonders to perform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF LINCOLN'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION.\r\nArrival of the President-Elect at Washington--Impressiveness of\r\nHis Inaugural Address--I am Elected Senator from Ohio to Succeed\r\nSalmon P.

Thomas.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, the President elect, arrived in the city of\r\nWashington on the 23rd day of February, 1861, and, with Mrs. Lincoln,\r\nstopped at Willard's Hotel where I was then living.  On the evening\r\nof his arrival I called upon him, and met him for the first time.\r\nWhen introduced to him, he took my hands in both of his, drew\r\nhimself up to his full height, and, looking at me steadily, said:\r\n\"You are John Sherman!  Well, I am taller than you; let's measure.\"\r\nThereupon we stood back to back, and some one present announced\r\nthat he was two inches taller than I.  This was correct, for he\r\nwas 6 feet 3½ inches tall when he stood erect.  This singular\r\nintroduction was not unusual with him, but if it lacked dignity,\r\nit was an expression of friendliness and so considered by him.\r\nOur brief conversation was cheerful, and my hearty congratulations\r\nfor his escape from the Baltimore \"roughs\" were received with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nIt was generally understood when Mr. Lincoln arrived that his\r\ncabinet was definitely formed, but rumors soon prevailed that\r\ndissensions existed among its members, that Seward and Chase were\r\nrivals, that neither could act in harmony with the other, and that\r\nboth were discontented with their associates.  I became satisfied\r\nthat these rumors were true.  I do not feel at liberty, even at\r\nthis late day, to repeat what was said to me by some of the members\r\nselected, but I was convinced that Lincoln had no purpose or desire\r\nto change the cabinet he had selected in Springfield, and that he\r\nregarded their jealousies (if I may use such a word in respect to\r\nthe gentlemen so distinguished) as a benefit and not an objection,\r\nas by that means he would control his cabinet rather than be\r\ncontrolled by it.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln delivered his inaugural address from the east steps of\r\nthe capitol, on the 4th day of March, 1861.  I sat near him and\r\nheard every word.  Douglas stood conspicuous behind him and suggesting\r\nmany thoughts.  I have witnessed many inaugurations, but never one\r\nso impressive as this.  The condition of the south already organized\r\nfor war, the presence of United States troops with general Scott\r\nin command, the manifest preparation against threatened violence,\r\nthe sober and quiet attention to the address, all united to produce\r\na profound apprehension of evils yet to come.  The eloquent peroration\r\nof Mr. Lincoln cannot be too often repeated, and I insert it here:\r\n\r\n\"In _your_ hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in\r\n_mine_, is the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will\r\nnot assail you.  You can have no conflict, without being yourselves\r\nthe aggressors.  _You_ have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy\r\nthe government, while _I_ shall have the most solemn one to 'preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend' it.\r\n\r\n\"I am loth to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must\r\nnot be enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not\r\nbreak, our bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory,\r\nstretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living\r\nheart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell\r\nthe chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will\r\nbe, by the better angels of our nature.\"\r\n\r\nSalmon P. Chase, then Senator, was appointed Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  I know with what doubt and reluctance he accepted this\r\noffice.  On the 7th of March his resignation as Senator was\r\ncommunicated to the Senate.  In anticipation of it the legislature\r\nof Ohio was canvassing for his successor.  My name was mentioned\r\nwith many others.  I was in doubt whether I ought to be a candidate,\r\nor even to accept the position if tendered.  I had been elected as\r\na Member of the next Congress and was quite certain of election as\r\nspeaker of the House of Representatives.  The Republicans had a\r\ndecided majority in that body and a feeling was manifest that I\r\nshould have, without opposition, the position to which I had been\r\nunjustly deprived by the previous House.  This was to me a coveted\r\nhonor.  I, therefore, did not follow the advice of my friends and\r\ngo to Columbus.  A ballot was taken in the caucus of Republican\r\nmembers of the general assembly, and I received a plurality but\r\nnot a majority, the votes being scattered among many other candidates\r\nof merit and ability.  My name was then withdrawn.  Several ballots\r\nwere taken on a number of days without result.  I was then telegraphed\r\nto come to Columbus.  I went and was nominated on the first vote\r\nafter my arrival, and promptly elected as Senator, to fill the\r\nvacancy occasioned by the resignation of Mr. Chase.\r\n\r\nI received many letters of congratulation, among which were two\r\nwhich I insert:\r\n\r\n  \"Dubuque, March 23, 1861.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman:--Allow me to sincerely congratulate you upon\r\nyour signal triumph at Columbus.  I can assure you that no recent\r\nevent has given me so much sincere gratification as your election,\r\nwhich I think a most worthy reward to a faithful public servant.\r\nRepublics are not so ungrateful as I supposed when I was defeated\r\nfor Dist. Atty.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely your friend,\r\n  \"Wm. B. Allison.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Strafford, April 1, 1861.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I congratulate you upon your election to the Senate\r\nof the U. S., but still I regret that you have left the House where\r\nI think you might have rendered more important services to your\r\ncountry than you will find opportunity to do in the Senate.  You\r\ncould without doubt, I think, have been Speaker, had you possessed\r\nany ambition for the position.  That would have been for two years\r\nonly, but it would be at a crisis that will figure in our history.\r\nThen you are greatly needed in economical questions with our party\r\n--many of whom have no just idea of the responsibility of the\r\nRepublican party or a Republican Representative.  I see no material\r\nworth mentioning for leaders in our House, and though I am glad to\r\nhave you suited, I do much regret your translation to the higher\r\nbranch.  I suppose we may be called back by Seward about the 1st\r\nof June.\r\n\r\n\"Our tariff bill is unfortunate in being launched at this time, as\r\nit will be made the scape-goat of all difficulties.  In fact the\r\nsouthern Confederacy would have made a lower tariff had we left\r\nthe old law in force and precisely the same troubles would have\r\nbeen presented.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours, very sincerely,\r\n  \"Justin S. Morrill.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate being then in special session, the oath prescribed by\r\nlaw was administered to me, and on the 23rd of March, 1861, I took\r\nmy seat in that body.  I had, however, before my election, witnessed,\r\nwith deep humiliation, the Senate debates, feeling that the Republican\r\nSenators were too timid in the steps taken to purge that body of\r\npersons whom I regarded as traitors.  I cannot now read the debates\r\nwithout a feeling of resentment.  Breckenridge, Mason, Hunter and\r\nPowell still retained their seats as Senators from Kentucky and\r\nVirginia, and almost daily defended the secession of the southern\r\nstates, declaring that the states they represented would do likewise.\r\nThese and other declarations I thought should have been promptly\r\nresented by the immediate expulsion of these Senators.  Wigfall,\r\nof Texas, though his state had seceded, was permitted to linger in\r\nthe Senate and to attend executive sessions, where he was not only\r\na traitor but a spy.  His rude and brutal language and conduct\r\nshould have excluded him from the Senate in the early days of the\r\nsession, but he was permitted to retire without censure, after a\r\nlong debate upon the terms of his proposed expulsion.  I took no\r\npart in the debates of that session, which closed March 28, 1861,\r\nfive days after my becoming a Member.  I remained in Washington\r\nuntil after the fall of Sumter in April following.\r\n\r\nDuring this period my brother, William Tecumseh, came to Washington\r\nto tender his services in the army in any position where he could\r\nbe useful.  I had corresponded with him freely in regard to his\r\nremaining in Louisiana, where he was president of the Louisiana\r\nState Seminary of Learning and Military Academy.  He had been\r\nembarrassed in his position by my attitude in Congress, and,\r\nespecially, by the outcry against me for signing the Helper book.\r\nHe was very conservative in his opinions in regard to slavery, and\r\nno doubt felt that I was too aggressive on that subject.  In the\r\nsummer of 1860 he made his usual visit to Lancaster, and, finding\r\nthat I was engaged in the canvass and would on a certain day be at\r\nCoshocton, he determined to go and hear me \"to see whether I was\r\nan Abolitionist.\"  He was greatly embarrassed by a memorable speech\r\nmade by Mr. Corwin, the principal speaker on that occasion.  We\r\nsat upon the stand together, and he very excitedly said:  \"John,\r\nyou must not speak after Corwin.\"  He was evidently impressed with\r\nthe eloquence of that orator and did not wish me to speak, lest\r\nthe contrast between our speeches would be greatly to my disparagement.\r\nI told him that he need not trouble himself, that I was to speak\r\nin the evening, though I might say a few words at the close of Mr.\r\nCorwin's address.  He remained and heard me in the evening, and\r\nconcluded on the whole that I was not an Abolitionist.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of Mr. Lincoln I wrote him a letter, which will\r\nspeak for itself, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, Ohio, November 26, 1860.\r\n\"My Dear Brother:--Since I received your last letter, I have been\r\nso constantly engaged, first with the election and afterwards in\r\narranging my business for the winter, that I could not write you.\r\n\r\n\"The election resulted as I all along supposed.  Indeed, the division\r\nof the Democratic party on precisely the same question that separated\r\nthe Republican party from the Democratic party made its defeat\r\ncertain.  The success of the Republicans has saved the country from\r\na discreditable scramble in the House.  The disorders of the last\r\nwinter, and the fear of their renewal, have, without doubt, induced\r\na good many citizens to vote for the Republican ticket.  With a\r\npretty good knowledge of the material of our House, I would far\r\nprefer that any one of the candidates be elected by the people\r\nrather than allow the contest to be determined by Congress.  Well,\r\nLincoln is elected.  No doubt, a large portion of the citizens of\r\nLouisiana think this is a calamity.  If they believe their own\r\nnewspapers, or, what is far worse, the lying organs of the Democratic\r\nparty in the free states, they have just cause to think so.  But\r\nyou were long enough in Ohio, and heard enough of the ideas of the\r\nRepublican leaders, to know that the Republican party is not likely\r\nto interfere, directly or indirectly, with slavery in the states\r\nor with the laws relating to slavery; that, so far as the slavery\r\nquestion is concerned, the contest was for the possession of Kansas\r\nand perhaps New Mexico, and that the chief virtue of the Republican\r\nsuccess was in its condemnation of the narrow sectionalism of\r\nBuchanan's administration and the corruption by which his policy\r\nwas attempted to be sustained.  Who doubts but that, if Buchanan\r\nhad been true to his promises in submitting the controversy in\r\nKansas to its own people, and had closed it by admitting Kansas as\r\na free state, that the Democratic party would have retained its\r\npower?  It was his infernal policy in that state (I can hardly\r\nthink of the mean and bad things he allowed there without swearing)\r\nthat drove off Douglas, led to the division of the Democratic party\r\nand the consequent election of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of course, I rejoice in the result, for in my judgment\r\nthe administration of Lincoln will do much to dissipate the feeling\r\nin the south against the north, by showing what are the real purposes\r\nof the Republican party.  In the meantime, it is evident we have\r\nto meet in a serious way the movements of South Carolinian\r\nDisunionists.  These men have for years desired this disunion; they\r\nhave plotted for it.  They drove Buchanan from his Kansas policy;\r\nthey got up this new dogma about slave protection, they broke up\r\nthe Charleston convention merely to advance secession; they are\r\nnow hurrying forward excited men into acts of treason, without\r\ngiving time for passion to cool or reason to resume its sway.  God\r\nknows what will be the result.  If, by a successful revolution,\r\nthey can go out of the Union, they establish a principle that will\r\nbreak the government into fragments.  Some local disaffection or\r\ntemporary excitement will lead one state after another out of the\r\nUnion.  We shall have the Mexican Republic over again, with a\r\nfiercer race of men to fight with each other.  Secession is\r\nrevolution.  They seem bent upon attempting it.  If so, shall the\r\ngovernment resist?  If so, then comes civil war, a fearful subject\r\nfor Americans to think of.\r\n\r\n\"Since the election I have been looking over the field for the\r\npurpose of marking out a course to follow this winter, and I have,\r\nas well as I could, tested my political course in the past.  There\r\nhas been nothing done by the Republican party but what merits the\r\ncordial approval of my judgment.  There have been many things said\r\nand done by the Republican leaders that I utterly detest.  Many of\r\nthe dogmas of the Democratic party I like, but their conduct in\r\nadministering the government, and especially in their treatment of\r\nthe slavery question, I detest.  I know we shall have trouble this\r\nwinter, but I intend to be true to the moderate conservative course\r\nI think I have hitherto undertaken.  Whatever may be the consequences,\r\nI will insist on preserving the unity of the states, and all the\r\nstates, without exception and without regard to consequences.  If\r\nany southern state has really suffered any injury or is deprived\r\nof any right, I will help reduce the injury and secure the right.\r\nThese states must not, merely because they are beaten in election,\r\nor have failed in establishing slavery where it was prohibited by\r\ncompromise, attempt to break up the government.  If they will hold\r\non a little while, they will find no injury can come to them,\r\nunless, by their repeated misrepresentation of us, they stir up\r\ntheir slaves to insurrection.  I still hope that no state will\r\nfollow in the wake of South Carolina; then the weakness of her\r\nposition will soon bring her back again or subject her to ridicule\r\nand insignificance.\r\n\r\n\"It may be supposed by some that the excitement in the south has\r\nproduced a corresponding excitement in the north.  This is true in\r\nfinancial matters, especially in the cities.  In political circles\r\nit only strengthens the Republican party.  Even Democrats of all\r\nshades say, 'The election is against us; we will submit and all\r\nmust submit.'  Republicans say, 'The policy of the government has\r\nbeen controlled by the south for years, and we have submitted; now\r\nthey must submit.'  And why not?  What can the Republicans do half\r\nas bad as Pierce and Buchanan have done?\r\n\r\n\"But enough of this.  You luckily are out of politics, and don't\r\nsympathize with my Republicanism, but as we are on the eve of\r\nimportant events, I write about politics instead of family matters,\r\nof which there is nothing new.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nIn December I received this letter from him:\r\n\r\n  \"Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy,}\r\n  \"Alexandria, December 1, 1860.                             }\r\n\"Dear Brother:--. . . The quiet which I thought the usual acquiescence\r\nof the people was merely the prelude to the storm of opinion that\r\nnow seems irresistible.  Politicians, by heating the prejudices of\r\nthe people and running with the current, have succeeded in destroying\r\nthe government.  It cannot be stopped now, I fear.  I was in\r\nAlexandria all day yesterday, and had a full and unreserved\r\nconversation with Dr. S. A. Smith, state senator, who is a man of\r\neducation, property, influence, and qualified to judge.  He was,\r\nduring the canvass, a Breckenridge man, but, though a southerner\r\nin opinion, is really opposed to a dissolution of our government.\r\nHe has returned from New Orleans, where he says he was amazed to\r\nsee evidences of public sentiment which could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"The legislature meets December 10, at Baton Rouge.  The calling\r\nof a convention forthwith is to be unanimous, the bill for army\r\nand state ditto.  The convention will meet in January, and only\r\ntwo questions will be agitated,--immediate dissolution, a declaration\r\nof state independence, and a general convention of southern states,\r\nwith instructions to demand of the northern states to repeal all\r\nlaws hostile to slavery and pledges of future good behavior. . . .\r\nWhen the convention meets in January, as they will assuredly do,\r\nand resolve to secede, or to elect members to a general convention\r\nwith instructions inconsistent with the nature of things, I must\r\nquit this place, for it would be neither right for me to stay nor\r\nwould the governor be justified in placing me in this position of\r\ntrust; for the moment Louisiana assumes a position of hostility,\r\nthen this becomes an arsenal and fort. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Let me hear the moment you think dissolution is inevitable.  What\r\nMississippi and Georgia do, this state will do likewise.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately,\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December I wrote him:\r\n\r\n\"I am clearly of the opinion that you ought not to remain much\r\nlonger at your present post.  You will, in all human probability,\r\nbe involved in complications from which you cannot escape with\r\nhonor.  Separated from your family and all your kin, and an object\r\nof suspicion, you will find your position unendurable.  A fatal\r\ninfatuation seems to have seized the southern mind, during which\r\nany act of madness may be committed. . . . If the sectional\r\ndissensions only rested upon real or alleged grievances, they could\r\nbe readily settled, but I fear they are deeper and stronger.  You\r\ncan now close your connection with the seminary with honor and\r\ncredit to yourself, for all who know you speak well of your conduct,\r\nwhile be remaining you not only involve yourself, but bring trouble\r\nupon those gentlemen who recommended you.\r\n\r\n\"It is a sad state of affairs, but it is nevertheless true, that\r\nif the conventions of the southern states make anything more than\r\na paper secession, hostile collisions will occur, and probably a\r\nseparation between the free and the slave states.  You can judge\r\nwhether it is at all probable that the possession of this capital,\r\nthe commerce of the Mississippi, the control of the territories,\r\nand the natural rivalry of enraged sections, can be arranged without\r\nwar.  In that event, you cannot serve in Louisiana against your\r\nfamily and kin in Ohio.  The bare possibility of such a contingency,\r\nit seems to me, renders your duty plain, to make a frank statement\r\nto all the gentlemen connected with you, and with good feeling\r\nclose your engagement.  If the storm shall blow over, your course\r\nwill strengthen you with every man whose good opinion you desire;\r\nif not, you will escape humiliation.\r\n\r\n\"When you return to Ohio, I will write you freely about your return\r\nto the army, not so difficult a task as you imagine.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman then wrote me as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Alexandria, La., December, 1861.\r\n\"Events here seem hastening to a conclusion.  Doubtless you know\r\nmore of the events in Louisiana than I do, as I am in an out-of-\r\nthe-way place.  But the special session of the legislature was so\r\nunanimous in arming the state and calling a convention that little\r\ndoubt remains that Louisiana will, on the 23rd of January, follow\r\nthe other seceding states.  Governor Moore takes the plain stand\r\nthat the state must not submit to a 'black Republican President.'\r\nMen here have ceased to reason; they seem to concede that slavery\r\nis unsafe in a confederacy with northern states, and that now is\r\nthe time; no use of longer delay.  All concessions, all attempts\r\nto remonstrate, seem at an end.\r\n\r\n\"A rumor says that Major Anderson, my old captain (brother of\r\nCharles Anderson, now of Texas, formerly of Dayton and Cincinnati,\r\nLarz, William and John, all of Ohio), has spiked the guns of Fort\r\nMoultrie, destroyed it, and taken refuge in Sumter.  This is right.\r\nSumter is in mid-channel, approachable only in boats, whereas\r\nMoultrie is old, weak, and easily approached under cover.  If Major\r\nAnderson can hold out till relieved and supported by steam frigates,\r\nSouth Carolina will find herself unable to control her commerce,\r\nand will feel, for the first time in her existence, that she can't\r\ndo as she pleases. . . .\r\n\r\n\"A telegraph dispatch, addressed to me at Alexandria, could be\r\nmailed at New Orleans, and reach me in three days from Washington.\"\r\n\r\nI wrote him the following letter on the 6th of January, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Brother:--. . . I see some signs of hope, but it is probably\r\na deceptive light.  The very moment you feel uncomfortable in your\r\nposition in Louisiana, come away.  Don't for God's sake subject\r\nyourself to any slur, reproach, or indignity.  I have spoken to\r\nGeneral Scott, and he heartily seconds your desire to return to\r\nduty in the army.  I am not at all sure but that, if you were here,\r\nyou could get a position that would suit you.  I see many of your\r\nfriends of the army daily.\r\n\r\n\"As for my views of the present crisis, I could not state them more\r\nfully than I have in the inclosed printed letter.  It has been very\r\ngenerally published and approved in the north, but may not have\r\nreached you, and therefore I send it to you.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately your brother,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nLater he wrote me:\r\n\r\n  \"Alexandria, January 16, 1861.\r\n\"My Dear Brother:--I am so much in the woods here that I can't keep\r\nup with the times at all.  Indeed, you in Washington hear from New\r\nOrleans two or three days sooner than I do.  I was taken aback by\r\nthe news that Governor Moore had ordered the forcible seizure of\r\nthe Forts Jackson and St. Philip, at or near the mouth of the\r\nMississippi; also of Forts Pike and Wood, at the outlets of Lakes\r\nBogue and Pontchartrain.  All these are small forts, and have rarely\r\nbeen occupied by troops.  They are designed to cut off approach by\r\nsea to New Orleans, and were taken doubtless to prevent their being\r\noccupied, by order of General Scott.  But the taking the arsenal\r\nat Baton Rouge is a different matter.  It is merely an assemblage\r\nof store-houses, barracks, and dwelling-houses, designed for the\r\nhealthy residence of a garrison, to be thrown into one or the other\r\nof the forts in case of war.  The arsenal is one of minor importance,\r\nyet the stores were kept there for the moral effect, and the garrison\r\nwas there at the instance of the people of Louisiana.  To surround\r\nwith the military array, to demand surrender, and enforce the\r\ndeparture of the garrison, was an act of war.  It amounted to a\r\ndeclaration of war and defiance, and was done by Governor Moore\r\nwithout the authority of the legislature or convention.  Still,\r\nthere is but little doubt but that each of these bodies, to assemble\r\nnext week, will ratify and approve these violent acts, and it is\r\nidle to discuss the subject now.  The people are mad on this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"I had previously notified all that in the event of secession I\r\nshould quit.  As soon as knowledge of these events reached me, I\r\nwent to the vice president, Dr. Smith, in Alexandria, and told him\r\nthat I regarded Louisiana as at war against the federal government,\r\nand that I must go.  He begged me to wait until some one could be\r\nfound to replace me.  The supervisors feel the importance of system\r\nand discipline, and seem to think that my departure will endanger\r\nthe success of this last effort to build up an educational\r\nestablishment. . . . You may assert that in no event will I forego\r\nmy allegiance to the United States as long as a single state is\r\ntrue to the old constitution. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n  \"Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy,}\r\n  \"Alexandria, January 18, 1861.                             }\r\n\"Dear Brother:--Before receiving yours of the 6th, I had addressed\r\na letter to Governor Moore at Baton Rouge, of which this is a copy:--\r\n\r\n'_Sir:_--As I occupy a quasi military position under the laws of\r\nthe state, I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted such\r\nposition when Louisiana was a state in the union and when the motto\r\nof this seminary was inscribed in marble over the main door:  \"By\r\nthe liberality of the General Government.  The Union Esto perpetua.\"\r\nRecent events foreshadow a great change, and it becomes all men to\r\nchoose.  If Louisiana withdraw from the federal Union, I prefer to\r\nmaintain my allegiance to the old constitution as long as a fragment\r\nof it survives, and my longer stay here would be wrong in every\r\nsense of the word.  In that event, I beg that you will send or\r\nappoint some authorized agent to take charge of the arms and\r\nmunitions of war here belonging to the state, or advise me what\r\ndisposition to make of them.  And furthermore, as president of the\r\nboard of supervisors, I beg you to take immediate steps to relieve\r\nme as superintendent the moment the state determines to secede;\r\nfor on no earthly account will I do any act or think any thought\r\nhostile to, or in defiance of, the United States.\r\n\r\n  'With respect, etc.,\r\n  'W. T. Sherman.'\r\n\r\n\"I regard the seizure by Governor Moore of the United States arsenal\r\nas the worst act yet committed in the present revolution.  I do\r\nthink every allowance should be made to southern politicians for\r\ntheir nervous anxiety about their political powers and the safety\r\nof slaves.  I think that the constitution should be liberally\r\nconstrued in their behalf, but I do regard this civil war as\r\nprecipitated with undue rapidity. . . . It is inevitable.  All\r\nlegislation now would fall powerless on the south.  You should not\r\nalienate such states as Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri.\r\nMy notice is that this war will ruin all politicians, and that\r\nmilitary leaders will direct the events.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours\r\n  \"W. T. S.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first of February he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have felt the very thoughts you have spoken.  It is war to\r\nsurround Anderson with batteries, and it is shilly-shally for the\r\nsouth to cry 'Hands off!  No coercion!'  It was war and insult to\r\nexpel the garrison at Baton Rouge, and Uncle Sam had better cry\r\n'Cave!' or assert his power.  Fort Sumter is not material save for\r\nthe principle; but Key West and the Tortugas should be held in\r\nforce at once, by regulars if possible, if not, by militia.  Quick!\r\nThey are occupied now, but not in force.  While maintaining the\r\nhigh, strong ground you do, I would not advise you to interpose an\r\nobjection to securing concessions to the middle and moderate states,\r\n--Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri.  Slavery there is\r\nlocal, and even if the world were open to them, its extension would\r\ninvolve no principle.  If these states feel the extreme south wrong,\r\na seeming concession would make them committed.  The cotton states\r\nare gone, I suppose.  Of course, their commerce will be hampered. . . .\r\n\r\n\"But of myself.  I sent you a copy of my letter to the Governor.\r\nHere is his answer:\r\n\r\n'_Dear Sir:_--It is with the deepest regret I acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your letter of the 18th instant.  In the pressure of\r\nofficial business I can only request you to transfer to Professor\r\nSmith the arms, munitions, and funds in your hands, whenever you\r\nconclude to withdraw from the position you have filled with so much\r\ndistinction.  You cannot regret more than I do the necessity which\r\ndeprives us of your services, and you will bear with you the respect,\r\nconfidence, and admiration of all who have been associated with you.\r\n\r\n  'Very truly, your friend and servant,\r\n  'Thos. D. Moore.'\r\n\r\n\"This is very handsome, and I do regret this political imbroglio.\r\nI do think it was brought about by politicians.  The people in the\r\nsouth are evidently unanimous in the opinion that slavery is\r\nendangered by the current of events, and it is useless to attempt\r\nto alter that opinion.  As our government is founded on the will\r\nof the people, when that will is fixed, our government is powerless,\r\nand the only question is whether to let things slide into general\r\nanarchy, or the formation of two or more confederacies which will\r\nbe hostile sooner or later.  Still, I know that some of the best\r\nmen of Louisiana think this change may be effected peacefully.\r\nBut even if the southern states be allowed to depart in peace, the\r\nfirst question will be revenue.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if the south have free trade, how can you collect revenues\r\nin the eastern cities?  Freight from New Orleans to St. Louis,\r\nChicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, and even Pittsburg, would be about\r\nthe same as by rail from New York, and importers at New Orleans,\r\nhaving no duties to pay, would undersell the east if they had to\r\npay duties.  Therefore, if the south make good their confederation\r\nand their plan, the northern confederacy must do likewise or\r\nblockade.  Then comes the question of foreign nations.  So, look\r\non it in any view, I see no result but war and consequent changes\r\nin the form of government.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters, written at their dates, on the spur of the moment,\r\npresent the condition of affairs as viewed by General Sherman and\r\nmyself when they occurred.\r\n\r\nWith the conviction just stated General Sherman came to Washington\r\nabout the time of my election to the Senate.  He was deeply impressed\r\nwith the certainty of war and of its magnitude, and was impelled\r\nby the patriotic sentiment that, as he had been educated at the\r\nexpense of the government for military service, it was his duty,\r\nin the then condition of the country, to tender his services.  I\r\ntherefore escorted him to the White House.  His statement of the\r\ninterview given in his \"Memoirs\" is not very full, for, while Mr.\r\nLincoln did say, in response to his tender, \"I guess we will manage\r\nto keep house,\" he also expressed a hope, which General Sherman\r\nknew to be delusive, that the danger would pass by and that the\r\nUnion would be restored by a peaceful compromise.  This was,\r\nundoubtedly, the idea then uppermost in the minds of both the\r\nPresident and Mr. Seward.  At this time the public mind in the\r\nnorth was decidedly in favor of concessions to the south.  The\r\nDemocrats of the north would have agreed to any proposition to\r\nsecure peace and the Union, and the Republicans would have acquiesced\r\nin the Crittenden Compromise, or in any measure approved by Lincoln\r\nand Seward.\r\n\r\nThe period between the 4th of March and the 12th of April was the\r\ndarkest one in the history of the United States.  It was a time of\r\nhumiliation, timidity and feebleness.  Fortunately for the future\r\nof our country the rebels of the south were bent upon disunion;\r\nthey were hopeful and confident, and all the signs of the times\r\nindicated their success.  They had possession of all the forts of\r\nthe south, except Fortress Monroe, Fort Sumter, and two remote\r\nforts in Florida.  They had only to wait in patience, and Fort\r\nSumter would necessarily be abandoned for want of supplies.  Fortress\r\nMonroe could not be held much longer by the regular army, weakened\r\nas it was by the desertion of officers and men, and public sentiment\r\nwould not justify a call for troops in advance of actual war.  The\r\npeople of South Carolina were frenzied by their success thus far,\r\nand, impatient of delay, forced an attack on Fort Sumter, then held\r\nby a small garrison under command of Major Robert Anderson.  The\r\nfirst gun fired on the 12th of April, 1861, resounded throughout\r\nthe United States and the civilized world, touching an electric\r\nchord in every family in the northern states and changing the whole\r\ncurrent of feeling.  From this time forth, among the patriotic\r\npeople of the loyal states, there was no thought or talk of\r\ncompromise.  That this insult to our flag must be punished, \"that\r\nthe Union must and shall be preserved,\" were the resolves of millions\r\nof men, without respect to party, who but the day before were eager\r\nfor compromise.  The cold and cautious men of the north were at\r\nlast awakened from their indifference.\r\n\r\nThe impression made upon my mind by the attack on Fort Sumter is\r\nexpressed in a letter I wrote from Washington to my brother, General\r\nSherman, as he was then called, at midnight of the 12th of April:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, April 12, 1861.\r\n\"Dear Brother:--I was unexpectedly called here soon after receiving\r\nyour letter of the 8th, and at midnight write you.  The military\r\nexcitement here is intense.  Since my arrival I have seen several\r\nofficers, many citizens, and all the heads of departments except\r\nBlair.  There is a fixed determination now to preserve the Union\r\nand enforce the laws at all hazards.  Civil war is actually upon\r\nus, and, strange to say, it brings a feeling of relief; the suspense\r\nis over.  I have spent much of the day in talking about you.  There\r\nis an earnest desire that you go into the war department, but I\r\nsaid this was impossible.  Chase is especially desirous that you\r\naccept, saying that you would be virtually Secretary of War, and\r\ncould easily step into any military position that offers.\r\n\r\n\"It is well for you seriously to consider your conclusion, although\r\nmy opinion is that you ought not to accept.  You ought to hold\r\nyourself in reserve.  If troops are called for, as they surely will\r\nbe in a few days, organize a regiment or brigade, either in St.\r\nLouis or Ohio, and you will then get into the army in such a way\r\nas to secure promotion.  By all means take advantage of the present\r\ndisturbances to get into the army, where you will at once put\r\nyourself in a high position for life.  I know that promotion and\r\nevery facility for advancement will be cordially extended by the\r\nauthorities.  You are a favorite in the army and have great strength\r\nin political circles.  I urge you to avail yourself of these\r\nfavorable circumstances to secure your position for life; for,\r\nafter all, your present employment is of uncertain tenure in these\r\nstirring times.\r\n\r\n\"Let me now record a prediction.  Whatever you may think of the\r\nsigns of the times, the government will rise from this strife\r\ngreater, stronger, and more prosperous than ever.  It will display\r\nenergy and military power.  The men who have confidence in it, and\r\ndo their full duty by it, may reap whatever there is of honor and\r\nprofit in public life, while those who look on merely as spectators\r\nin the storm will fail to discharge the highest duty of a citizen,\r\nand suffer accordingly in public estimation. . . .\r\n\r\n\"I write this in great hurry, with numbers around me, and exciting\r\nand important intelligence constantly repeated, even at this hour;\r\nbut I am none the less in earnest.  I hope to hear that you are on\r\nthe high road to the 'General' within thirty days.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately your brother,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later I wrote him:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, Sunday, April 14, 1861.\r\n\"Dear Brother:--. . . The war has really commenced.  You will have\r\nfull details of the fall of Sumter.  We are on the eve of a terrible\r\nwar.  Every man will have to choose his position.  You fortunately\r\nhave a military education, prominence, and character, that will\r\nenable you to play a high part in the tragedy.  You can't avoid\r\ntaking such a part.  Neutrality and indifference are impossible.\r\nIf the government is to be maintained, it must be by military power,\r\nand that immediately.  You can choose your own place.  Some of your\r\nbest friends here want you in the war department; Taylor, Shiras,\r\nand a number of others, talk to me so.  If you want that place,\r\nwith a sure prospect of promotion, you can have it, but you are\r\nnot compelled to take it; but it seems to me you will be compelled\r\nto take some position, and that speedily.  Can't you come to Ohio\r\nand at once raise a regiment?  It will immediately be in service.\r\nThe administration intends to stand or fall by the Union, the entire\r\nUnion, and the enforcement of the laws.  I look for preliminary\r\ndefeats, for the rebels have arms, organization, unity; but this\r\nadvantage will not last long.  The government will maintain itself\r\nor our northern people are the veriest poltroons that ever disgraced\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\"For me, I am for a war that will either establish or overthrow\r\nthe government and will purify the atmosphere of political life.\r\nWe need such a war, and we have it now. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote in reply:\r\n\r\n\"The time will come in this country when professional knowledge\r\nwill be appreciated, when men that can be trusted will be wanted,\r\nand I will bide my time.  I may miss the chance; if so, all right;\r\nbut I cannot and will not mix myself in this present call. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The first movements of the government will fail and the leaders\r\nwill be cast aside.  A second or third set will rise, and among\r\nthem I may be, but at present I will not volunteer as a soldier or\r\nanything else.  If Congress meet, or if a national convention be\r\ncalled, and the regular army be put on a footing with the wants of\r\nthe country, if I am offered a place that suits me, I may accept.\r\nBut in the present call I will not volunteer.\"\r\n\r\nHe criticised the call for 75,000 militia for three months, saying\r\nthat the best of men could only be made indifferent soldiers in\r\nthree months, and that the best of soldiers could accomplish nothing\r\nin three months in such a country as ours.  He therefore would not\r\nvolunteer for such a service, but his mind was occupied with military\r\nplans.  The correspondence between us shows that he had a better\r\nconception of the magnitude and necessities of the war than civilians\r\nlike myself.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Mr. Cameron, Secretary of War, from St. Louis, on May\r\n8, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"I hold myself now, as always, prepared to serve my country in the\r\ncapacity for which I was trained.  I did not and will not volunteer\r\nfor three months, because I cannot throw my family on the cold\r\nsupport of charity, but for the three years' call made by the\r\nPresident an officer could prepare his command and do good service.\r\nI will not volunteer, because, rightfully or wrongfully, I feel\r\nmyself unwilling to take a mere private's place, and having for\r\nmany years lived in California and Louisiana, the men are not well\r\nenough acquainted with me to elect me to my appropriate place.\r\nShould my services be needed, the record or the war department will\r\nenable you to designate the station in which I can render best\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln was elected President, there was no general feeling\r\namong the northern people that war would result from his election.\r\nIt was not believed, although it had been threatened, that the\r\nsouthern states would take up arms to resist the accession of a\r\nPresident not of their choice.  The love of Union and the orderly\r\nobedience to constituted authority had been so well established\r\namong our people that, while politicians might threaten, but few\r\nreally believed that war, of which they knew nothing, was to come\r\nupon us.  The result was that when the southern states, one by one,\r\nseceded, and Fort Sumter was fired upon, and the forts and arsenals\r\nof the south were captured, a new inspiration dawned upon the people\r\nof the north, a determination became general that, cost what it\r\nwould, the Union should be preserved to our children and our\r\nchildren's children.  That feeling was not confined to party lines.\r\nI am bound to say that the members of the Democratic party in the\r\nloyal States, in the main, evinced the same patriotic determination\r\nto maintain the cause of the Union, as those of the Republican\r\nparty.  Their sons and their kindred formed part of every regiment\r\nor force raised in the United States.\r\n\r\nAt this distance of time from the opening of the Civil War, I have\r\nendeavored to take an impartial retrospect of the causes that led\r\nthe south to engage therein.  Undoubtedly, the existence of negro\r\nslavery in the south was the governing excitement to war.  The\r\nowners of slaves knew that the tenure of such property was feeble.\r\nBesides the danger of escape, there was the growing hostility to\r\nslavery in a preponderance of the people of the United States,\r\nrestrained only by its recognition by the constitution.  The slave\r\nowners believed that, by secession, they could establish a republic,\r\nfounded on slavery, with an ample field in Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica for conquest and expansion.  They had cultivated a bitter\r\nsectional enmity, amounting to contempt, for the people of the\r\nnorth, growing partly out of the subserviency of large portions of\r\nthe north to the dictation of the south, but chiefly out of the\r\nwordy violence and disregard of constitutional obligation by the\r\nAbolitionists of the north.  They believed in the doctrine of an\r\nirrepressible conflict long before it was announced by Seward.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, far in advance of other southern states, led in\r\npromulgating the legal rights of secession, until they came to be\r\nacquiesced in by all these states.  They committed themselves to\r\nit in the Charleston convention.  Their speakers declared, during\r\nthe canvass, that if Lincoln was elected, their states would secede.\r\nWhen elected, the first gun was fired on Fort Sumter, in South\r\nCarolina, where all the people were determined on war.  The struggle\r\nonce commenced, the natural sympathy of the southern states was\r\nwith South Carolina.  The States of Virginia, North Carolina and\r\nTennessee, where a strong Union sentiment prevailed, hesitated and\r\ndelayed, but the young and active spirits were with the south, and\r\nthese carried the states named into the general conflict.  Once in\r\nthe war, there was no way but to fight it out.  I have no sympathy\r\nwith secession, but I can appreciate the action of those who were\r\nborn and reared under the influence of such teachings.  Who of the\r\nnorth can say, that in like conditions, he would not have been a\r\nrebel?\r\n\r\nLooking back from my standpoint now, when all the states are re-\r\nunited in a stronger Union, when Union and Confederate soldiers\r\nare acting together in both Houses of Congress in legislating for\r\nthe common good, when, since 1861, our country has more than doubled\r\nits population and quadrupled its resources, when its institutions\r\nhave been harmonized by the abolition of slavery, when the seceding\r\nstates are entering into a friendly and hopeful rivalry, in the\r\ndevelopment of their great resources, when they have doubled or\r\ntrebled their production of cotton, when they are producing the\r\ngreater part of their food, when they are developing their manufactures\r\nof iron and steel, and introducing the spindle and loom into the\r\ncities and villages, it seems to me that men of the south surely\r\nwill appreciate, if they do not approve, what I said in the Senate\r\nearly in the war:\r\n\r\n\"I would stake the last life, the last dollar, the last man, upon\r\nthe prosecution of the war.  Indeed, I cannot contemplate the\r\ncondition of my country if it shall be dissevered and divided.\r\nTake the loyal states as they now stand and look at the map of the\r\nUnited States, and regard two hostile confederacies stretching\r\nalong for thousands of miles across the continent.  Do you not know\r\nthat the normal condition of such a state of affairs would be\r\neternal, everlasting war?  Two nations of the same blood, of the\r\nsame lineage, of the same spirit, cannot occupy the same continent,\r\nmuch less standing side by side as rival nations, dividing rivers\r\nand mountains for their boundary.  No, Mr. president, rather than\r\nallow this war to terminate except upon the restoration of the\r\nUnion intact in all its breadth and length, I would sacrifice the\r\nlast man and see the country itself submerged.\r\n\r\n\"Rather than yield to traitors or the intervention of foreign\r\npowers, rather than bequeath to the next generation a broken Union,\r\nand an interminable civil war, I would light the torch of fanaticism\r\nand destroy all that the labor of two generations has accumulated.\r\nBetter a desert and universal poverty than disunion; better the\r\nwar of the French Revolution than an oligarchy founded upon the\r\nlabor of slaves.  But, sir, there is no need of this.  The resources,\r\nwealth, and labor of twenty millions of freemen are amply sufficient\r\nto meet not only the physical, but financial, difficulties of the\r\nwar.  Thank God! the test to which all nations in the course of\r\ntheir history are subjected, is applied to us when we have a\r\ninsignificant national debt; when our resources were never more\r\nmanifest; when the loyal states are so throughly united; when our\r\npeople are filled with a generous enthusiasm that will make the\r\nloss of life and burden of taxation easy to bear.  If we conquer\r\na peace by preserving the Union, the constitution, our nationality,\r\nall our ample territories, the rebound of prosperity in this country\r\nwill enable a single generation easily to pay the national debt,\r\neven if the war is protracted until desolation is written upon\r\nevery rebel hearthstone.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, expressed the spirit and determination of the\r\nloyal states of the north, at the beginning of the war.  With\r\nopinions so widely divergent in the two sections, and with a fixed\r\npurpose of each to stand by them, there was no way that poor frail\r\nhuman nature could devise to decide the controversy except to fight.\r\n\r\nFrom the graves of the dead, who fought on opposite sides for their\r\ncountry of their state, there has been a resurrection, honorable\r\nto both sections, a Union stronger, more united and glorious than\r\nthe Union established by our fathers, and with a rebound of prosperity\r\ngreater than we could conceive of in 1862.  This war, though fearful\r\nin the sacrifice of property and life, has resulted in a better\r\nunderstanding among the people of both sections.  Each has for the\r\nother a higher respect and regard.  I sincerely hope and believe\r\nin the good time coming when sectional lines will not divide\r\npolitical parties, and common interests and a broader nationality\r\nwill have destroyed sectional feeling and jealousy.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the war we command the respect of all foreign\r\nnations.  The United States, as a great republic, has become an\r\nexample already followed by European nations.  It has at least\r\nsecured the respect and forbearance of the ruling class in Great\r\nBritain, who never forgot or forgave the rebellion of our ancestors\r\nagainst King George III and the parliament of Great Britain.  It\r\nhas stamped the language, the laws, and the boasted freedom of\r\nEnglishmen, upon a population double that in the mother country,\r\nand they, in turn, are taking lessons from us in extending to their\r\npeople equality of rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nI remained in Washington a few days and then started for my home\r\nat Mansfield, to encourage enlistments, but found that no help was\r\nneeded; that companies were enlisted in a day.  One was recruited\r\nby William McLaughlin, a gallant soldier in the war in Mexico, a\r\nmajor general of the Ohio militia who had arrived at the age of\r\nsixty years.  He dropped his law books and in twelve hours had a\r\ncompany of one hundred men ready to move at the command of the\r\ngovernor.  A like patriotism was aroused in all parts of the state,\r\nso that in a very short time two full regiments, numbering 2,000\r\nmen, were organized under the command of Colonel A. McD. McCook,\r\nof the United States army, and were on the way to Washington, then\r\nblockaded by the roughs of Baltimore.  I met them at Harrisburg\r\nand went with them to Philadelphia.  They were camped at Fairmount\r\nPark, and were drilled with other regiments by Colonel Fitz John\r\nPorter, the entire force being under the command of General\r\nPatterson.\r\n\r\nWhen the blockade was opened, by the skill and audacity of General\r\nBenjamin F. Butler, the two Ohio regiments were ordered to Washington\r\nand were there reviewed by President Lincoln, at which time a\r\npleasant incident occurred which may be worthy of mention.  I\r\naccompanied the President to the parade, and passed with him down\r\nthe line.  He noticed a venerable man with long white hair and\r\nmilitary bearing, standing in position at the head of his company\r\nwith arms presented, and inquired his name.  I said it was General\r\nMcLaughlin and hurriedly told him his history, his politics and\r\npatriotism.  The President, as he came opposite him, stopped, and\r\nleaving his party advanced to McLaughlin and extended his hand.\r\nMcLaughlin, surprised, had some difficulty in putting his sword\r\nunder his left arm.  They shook hands and Lincoln thanked him,\r\nsaying when men of his age and standing came to the rescue of their\r\ncountry there could be no doubt of our success.  McLaughlin highly\r\nappreciated this compliment.  He afterwards enlisted for the war\r\nand died in the service of his country.\r\n\r\nThese two regiments were subsequently ordered to Harrisburg, to\r\nwhich place they went, accompanied by me, and there they formed a\r\npart of the command of General Patterson, which was to advance on\r\nMartinsburg and Winchester to aid in a movement of General McDowell\r\nagainst the enemy at Bull Run.  I was serving on the staff of\r\nGeneral Patterson as a volunteer aid without pay.  While at Harrisburg\r\nit was suggested to me that ex-President Buchanan, then at his\r\ncountry home near that city, had expressed a wish to see me.  As\r\nour personal relations had always been pleasant, though our political\r\nopinions were widely different, I called upon him, I think with\r\nColonel Porter, and we were cordially received.  I was surprised\r\nat the frankness and apparent sincerity of the opinions expressed\r\nby him in relation to the war.  He said he had done all he could\r\nto prevent the war, but now that it was upon us it was the duty of\r\nall patriotic people to make it a success, that he approved all\r\nthat had been done by Mr. Lincoln, of whom he spoke in high terms\r\nof praise.  I believe he was sincere in the opinions he then\r\nexpressed, and know of nothing said or done by him since that time\r\nthat could create a doubt of his sincerity.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June the command of General Patterson moved\r\nslowly to Chambersburg, where it remained several days under constant\r\ndrill, then to Hagerstown and to the village of Williamsport on\r\nthe Potomac.  While at the latter place General Sherman, who had\r\nbeen at Washington and received his commission as colonel of the\r\n13th United States infantry, then being recruited, came to visit\r\nme at my lodgings in a country tavern.  He then met for the first\r\ntime in many years his old classmate, Colonel, afterwards Major-\r\nGeneral, George H. Thomas, who then commanded a regular regiment\r\nof the United States army in the force under the command of General\r\nPatterson.  The conversation of these two officers, who were to be\r\nso intimately associated in great events in the future, was very\r\ninteresting.  They got a big map of the United States, spread it\r\non the floor, and on their hands and knees discussed the probable\r\nsalient strategic places of the war.  They singled out Richmond,\r\nVicksburg, Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga.  To me it has\r\nalways appeared strange that they were able confidently and correctly\r\nto designate the lines of operations and strategic points of a war\r\nnot yet commenced, and more strange still that they should be\r\nleading actors in great battles at the places designated by them\r\nat this country tavern.\r\n\r\nThe next day General Thomas crossed the river into Virginia, but\r\nthe order was soon countermanded, it is said, by General Scott,\r\nand General Thomas returned to the north bank of the Potomac.\r\nGeneral Sherman returned to Washington to drill his raw troops for\r\nthe battle of Bull Run.  I soon after returned by stage to Frederick,\r\nMaryland, to take my seat in the Senate, Congress having been\r\nconvened to meet in special session on the 4th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nSPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS TO PROVIDE FOR THE WAR.\r\nCondition of the Treasury Immediately Preceding the War--Not Enough\r\nMoney on Hand to Pay Members of Congress--Value of Fractional Silver\r\nof Earlier Coinage--Largely Increased Revenues an Urgent Necessity\r\n--Lincoln's Message and Appeal to the People--Issue of New Treasury\r\nNotes and Bonds--Union Troops on the Potomac--Battle of Bull Run--\r\nOrganization of the \"Sherman Brigade\"--The President's Timely Aid\r\n--Personnel of the Brigade.\r\n\r\nTo understand the measures to be submitted to Congress at its\r\napproaching session, it is necessary to have a clear conception of\r\nthe condition of the treasury at that time, and of the established\r\nfinancial policy of the government immediately before the war.\r\n\r\nOn the meeting of Congress in December, 1860, the treasury was\r\nempty.  There was not enough money even to pay Members of Congress.\r\nThe revenues were not sufficient to meet the demands for ordinary\r\nexpenditures in time of peace.  Since 1857 money had been borrowed\r\nby the sale of bonds and the issue of treasury notes bearing\r\ninterest, to meet deficiencies.  The public debt had increased\r\nduring the administration of Mr. Buchanan about $70,000,000.  The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb, resigned on the 10th of\r\nDecember, 1860, declaring that his duty to Georgia required such\r\naction.  He had aided in every possible way to cripple the department\r\nwhile in charge of it.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of the same month Congress authorized the issue of\r\n$10,000,000 treasury notes, to bear interest at the lowest rate bid.\r\nOn the 18th Secretary Philip F. Thomas, Mr. Cobb's successor,\r\ninvited bids for $5,000,000 of treasury notes, part of the $10,000,000\r\nauthorized, at the rate of interest offered by the lowest bidder.\r\nOffers at 12 per cent. or less were made for $1,831,000 (the bulk\r\nof the offers being at 12 per cent.) which were accepted and\r\nadditional offers were received at interest varying from 15 to 36\r\nper cent., but were refused.  Immediately after the decision of\r\nthe department on these offers was announced, the assistant treasurer\r\nat New York advised the secretary that certain parties would take\r\nthe residue of the $5,000,000 offered, through the Bank of Commerce,\r\nat 12 per cent.  This proposition was accepted, on condition that\r\nthe amount required to make up the five millions should be deposited\r\nwithout delay.  The whole amount was applied to the payment of\r\noverdue treasury notes and other pressing demands on the treasury.\r\n\r\nSecretary Thomas resigned on the 11th of January, 1861, and John\r\nA. Dix became Secretary of the Treasury.  In answer to my inquiry\r\nSecretary Dix, in an official letter, dated January 18, 1861, stated\r\nthe terms of the sale of treasury notes and that:  \"The amount\r\nrequired to meet the outstanding current and accruing dues before\r\nthe close of the present fiscal year, besides any additional charges\r\non the treasury created by legislation during the present session\r\nof Congress, is $44,077,524.63.\"  He recommended a further issue\r\nof $25,000,000 of bonds, and suggested that the states which had\r\nreceived deposits under the act for the distribution of surplus\r\nrevenue in General Jackson's time might be called upon to return\r\nsuch deposits, and added:  \"If, instead of calling for these\r\ndeposits, it should be deemed advisable to pledge them for the\r\nrepayment of any money the government might find it necessary to\r\nborrow, a loan contracted on such a basis of security, superadding\r\nto the plighted faith of the United States that of the individual\r\nstates, could hardly fail to be acceptable to capitalists.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection I received the following note:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, February 6, 1861.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I send a preamble and resolution, and a letter to your\r\ngovernor.  Will you read and send them at once?  You, as a Member\r\nof Congress, can say what I cannot with propriety--that no states\r\nwhich guarantee bonds of the United States to the amount of the\r\npublic moneys in its hands, will be likely to be called on to repay\r\nthese moneys--at all events during the twenty years the bonds of\r\nthe United States will run.\r\n\r\n  \"I am truly yours,\r\n  \"John A. Dix.\r\n\"P. S.--I cannot put out my notice for a loan till your state acts,\r\nand the time is very short.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently I received the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, February 11, 1861, 7 p. m.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--My plan for raising money to meet the outstanding\r\nliabilities of the government, and to enable the incoming administration\r\nto carry on its financial operations without embarrassment till it\r\nshall have time to mature a plan for itself, has met with an obstacle\r\nquite unexpected to me.  The committee of ways and means in the\r\nHouse has declined to report a bill to authorize me to accept the\r\nguaranties voluntarily tendered by the states.  Mr. Spaulding, of\r\nNew York, and Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, I learn, have objections.\r\nUnless they withdraw their opposition the bill cannot be reported,\r\nand the plan must fail.  In that case I shall not deem it proper\r\nto ask for a loan of more than two millions to meet the redemption\r\nof treasury notes, which fall due before the 4th of March.  The\r\nstate of the country is such that a larger amount thrown on the\r\nmarket would have a most disastrous influence on the public credit.\r\nI do not think I can borrow two millions at more than 90 per cent.\r\nWith a guaranty such as the states have offered, I can get eight\r\nmillions at par.  The alternative is to authorize me to accept the\r\nguaranty, or leave the treasury with scarcely anything in it and\r\nwith outstanding demands, some of them very pressing, of at least\r\nsix millions of dollars, for you and your political friends to\r\nprovide for.  If anything is done it should be to-morrow, as I\r\nought to publish the notice on Wednesday.  Perhaps you can see the\r\ngentlemen referred to to-night and remove their objections.  I am,\r\nvery truly, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  \"John A. Dix.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of February, 1861, a bill became a law providing for\r\nthe sale of $20,000,000 six per cent. bonds, and these were sold\r\nat the rate of $89.10 for $100, yielding $18,415,000.\r\n\r\nSuch was the humiliating financial condition of the government of\r\nthe United States at the close of Mr. Buchanan's administration.\r\nThe expenditures of the government for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1861, were $84,577,258.60, of which $42,064,082.95 was procured\r\nfrom loans and treasury notes, leaving a balance in the treasury,\r\nat the close of the fiscal year 1861, of $2,395,635.21.  This\r\ncondition still existed when Congress subsequently met in special\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nUnder the sub-treasury laws then in force, the revenues of the\r\ngovernment were received and held only in the treasury at Washington,\r\nand in sub-treasuries located in a few of the principal cities of\r\nthe United States, and could be paid out only upon the draft of\r\nthe treasurer of the United States, drawn agreeably to appropriations\r\nmade by law.  No money could be received into the treasury except\r\ngold and silver coin of the United States, and such treasury notes\r\nas were receivable for bonds.  State bank notes were not received\r\nfor government dues.  This exclusion grew out of the general failure\r\nof banks after the War of 1812 and the panic of 1837, and had caused\r\nthe outcry in 1840 of:  \"Gold for the office holders; rags for the\r\npeople.\"  But this policy of the government to receive only its\r\nown coin or notes was sustained by popular opinion.\r\n\r\nSilver dollars were not in circulation in 1861.  Their issue was\r\nprovided for at the beginning of our government, but, as they were\r\nmost of the time more valuable than gold coin of like face value,\r\nthey were hoarded or exported.  Their coinage was suspended by an\r\norder of President Jefferson in 1805, and after this order only\r\n1,300 silver dollars were coined by the United States prior to\r\n1836.  From 1836 to 1861 silver dollars were coined in small\r\nquantities, the aggregate being less than one and one-half million,\r\nand they were generally exported.  It is probable that when Mr.\r\nChase became Secretary of the Treasury, there was not in the United\r\nStates one thousand silver dollars.  In 1853, and prior to that\r\nyear, fractional silver coins were worth for bullion more than\r\ntheir face value, and, therefore, did not circulate.  Small change\r\nwas scarce, and fractional notes, called \"shinplasters,\" were issued\r\nin many parts of the United States.  Mexican coin, debased and\r\nworn, was in circulation.  To remedy this evil Congress, by the\r\nact of February 21, 1853, during Pierce's administration, prescribed\r\nthe weight of the silver half dollar as 192 grains instead of 206¼\r\ngrains, fixed by the coinage act of 1792, and the weight of the\r\nquarter, dime and half dime of silver was reduced in the same\r\nproportion.  As these new coins were less valuable than gold at\r\nthe rate coined, they were made a legal tender in payment of debts\r\nonly for sums not exceeding five dollars.  The silver bullion for\r\nthese coins was purchased at market value, and the privilege\r\ntheretofore granted to a depositor of silver bullion to have it\r\ncoined for him was repealed.  This law had the beneficial effect\r\nof driving out of circulation \"shinplasters\" and worn coins, and\r\nsupplied in ample quantity new full weight silver coins of handsome\r\ndevice, the government receiving the profit of the difference\r\nbetween the market value of the silver and its coinage value.\r\nUnder this law the coinage of silver rapidly increased, so that,\r\nwithin two years after the passage of the act of 1853, more silver\r\nwas converted into fractional coins and was in active use among\r\nthe people than was contained in all the silver dollars coined\r\nunder \"free coinage\" from the beginning of the government to 1878.\r\n\r\nWhile silver was thus made useful to the fullest extent possible,\r\nit was, from its weight and bulk, inadequate and inconvenient for\r\nthe vast demands of the government during the war.  Silver and gold\r\ntogether could not meet this demand.  There was known to be in the\r\ncountry at that time, of specie in circulation, $250,000,000, of\r\nstate bank notes, $180,000,000, in all $430,000,000.  This amount,\r\nexperience had shown, was necessary to meet exchanges in ordinary\r\ntimes of peace.  The disturbance of a civil war would likely\r\nstimulate production for a time and require even more circulation\r\nfor current business.  This circulation, if drawn from its ordinary\r\nchannels, would bring no end of confusion and distress to the\r\npeople, and the government, to meet the demand occasioned by carrying\r\non a war, must look elsewhere for a circulating medium with which\r\nto meet its enormous disbursements which must necessarily be made\r\nalmost wholly in actual cash--checks being, from the character of\r\npayments, of little avail.\r\n\r\nThere was no escaping the issue of credit money in some form, and\r\nof whatever form adopted we knew that gold and silver would soon\r\ndisappear under the shadow of war--that they would be hoarded or\r\nexported.\r\n\r\nThis is the universal result of great wars long protracted.  It\r\nwas our experience during our Revolution and the War of 1812, and\r\nof Great Britain and all European nations during the Napoleonic\r\nwars.  What should take the place of gold and silver for currency?\r\nThe only answer was to substitute for the time the notes of the\r\nUnited States, with all the sanction and credit which the republic\r\ncould confer, in the place of coin.  We could not, with safety,\r\naccept bank notes issued by state corporations, varying in terms\r\nand credit according to the laws of twenty-three separate states.\r\n\r\nTo establish a credit of our bonds and notes these measures at\r\nleast were necessary:  First, to increase largely the revenues from\r\ncustoms duties to be paid in coin; second, impose all forms of\r\ninternal taxes authorized by the constitution; third, create a\r\nnational currency redeemable in coin, with no fixed time for\r\nredemption, but made a legal tender for all debts, public and\r\nprivate, except customs duties; fourth, borrow any moneys needed\r\non the most favorable terms possible.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1861, the Senate convened in compliance with\r\nthe proclamation of the President, from whom it received a message\r\ncontaining a clear statement of the events that followed his\r\ninaugural address.  He described the attack upon Fort Sumter and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances,\r\nthat point was reached.  Then and thereby the assailants of the\r\ngovernment began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or\r\nin expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in the fort,\r\nsent to that harbor years before for their own protection, and\r\nstill ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful.  In\r\nthis act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country\r\nthe distinct issue, 'immediate dissolution or blood.'\r\n\r\n\"And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States.\r\nIt presents to the whole family of man the question, whether a\r\nconstitutional republic, or democracy--a government of the people\r\nby the same people--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity\r\nagainst its own domestic foes.  It presents the question, whether\r\ndiscontented individuals, too few in number to control administration\r\naccording to organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretenses\r\nmade in this case, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily,\r\nwithout any pretense, break up their government, and thus practically\r\nput an end to free government upon the earth.  It forces us to ask:\r\n'Is there, in all republics, this inherent and fatal weakness?'\r\n'Must a government, of necessity, be too _strong_ for the liberties\r\nof its own people, or too _weak_ to maintain its own existence?'\r\n\r\n\"So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war\r\npower of the government; and so to resist force employed for its\r\ndestruction, by force for its preservation.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed with this appeal to the people:\r\n\r\n\"It was with the deepest regret that the Executive found the duty\r\nof employing the war power in defense of the government forced upon\r\nhim.  He could but perform this duty, or surrender the existence\r\nof the government.  No compromise by public servants could in this\r\ncase be a cure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that\r\nno popular government can long survive a marked precedent that\r\nthose who carry an election can only save the government from\r\nimmediate destruction by giving up the main point upon which the\r\npeople gave the election.  The people themselves, and not their\r\nservants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions.\r\n\r\n\"As a private citizen, the Executive could not have consented that\r\nthose institutions should perish; much less could he, in betrayal\r\nof so vast and so sacred a trust as these free people have confided\r\nto him.  He felt that he had no moral right to shrink, or even to\r\ncount the chances of his own life, in what might follow.  In full\r\nview of his great responsibility, he has, so far, done what he has\r\ndeemed his duty.  You will now, according to your own judgment,\r\nperform yours.  He sincerely hopes that your views and your action\r\nmay so accord with him as to assure all faithful citizens who have\r\nbeen disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration\r\nof them, under the constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\n\"And having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure\r\npurpose, let us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear\r\nand with manly hearts.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Chase also submitted to Congress, on the first day of\r\nthe session, a clear statement of the financial condition of the\r\nUnited States.  He estimated the sum needed for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1862, at $318,519,581.  He recommended a large\r\nincrease of duties on imports, especially upon such articles as\r\nwere then free from duty; also a direct tax of $20,000,000, to be\r\napportioned among the states according to population; also a tax\r\non distilled spirits, ale, beer, tobacco, bank notes, and other\r\narticles of domestic production.  He also suggested the property\r\nof those engaged in insurrection or in giving aid and comfort to\r\ninsurgents should be made to contribute to the expenditures made\r\nnecessary by their criminal misconduct.  As the receipts from\r\ntaxation would still be inadequate to meet the expenses of the war,\r\nhe discussed the best mode and form of borrowing money, including\r\nbonds running for a long period with a fixed rate of interest, and\r\ntreasury notes bearing interest, payable on demand.\r\n\r\nKansas having recently been admitted into the Union, twenty-three\r\nstates were represented in the Senate by forty-six Senators.  Eleven\r\nstates being in open war against the United States, twenty-one of\r\ntheir Senators withdrew, but Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, remained\r\nin the Senate, making the total of Senators forty-seven.  Some of\r\nthese Senators were new in congressional life, and some had been\r\ntransferred from the House of Representatives.  This transfer of\r\na Member, though eagerly sought, is not for a time agreeable.\r\nHowever conspicuous the Member may have been in the House, he must\r\ntake his place in the Senate at the bottom of the ladder, and,\r\naccording to Senatorial usage, must be reasonably modest in expressing\r\nhis opinions.  The withdrawal of so many Senators in 1861, however,\r\ngave the new Members better positions than usual.  I was assigned\r\nto the committee on finance and on naval affairs.\r\n\r\nAt that time the committee on finance had charge of all bills\r\nappropriating money for the support of the government, all tax or\r\nrevenue bills, all loan and coinage bills, and, generally, all\r\nbills relating to the treasury department, and to the finances of\r\nthe government.  It was soon manifest that, in view of the war,\r\nand the enormous sums required to conduct it, the task of the\r\ncommittee would be a Herculean one, and that the labor required\r\nwould fall chiefly on Mr. Fessenden, the chairman of the committee,\r\nand, I may with due modesty add, myself.  My former position in\r\nthe House of Representatives, as chairman of the committee of ways\r\nand means, and my personal association with Secretary Chase, with\r\nwhom I was intimate, led to my taking an active part in financial\r\nlegislation, which was considered my specialty.  Congress, in\r\nsubstantial conformity with the recommendations of Secretary Chase,\r\npassed the act to authorize a loan which was approved July 17,\r\n1861, providing for the issue of $250,000,000 of bonds running\r\ntwenty years, bearing not exceeding seven per cent. interest, or\r\ntreasury notes for not less than fifty dollars each, bearing interest\r\nat not less than seven and three-tenths per cent. annually, and\r\npayable in three years, and treasury notes of less denomination\r\nthan fifty dollars, not bearing interest and not exceeding $50,000,000,\r\npayable on demand, and commonly known as demand notes.  We knew\r\nthat this act was entirely inadequate for the great struggle before\r\nus.  The problem was not whether we could muster men, but whether\r\nwe could raise money.  We had to create a system of finance that\r\nwould secure an enlarged revenue, unquestioned credit, absolute\r\ncertainty of payment of interest in coin, a national currency, and\r\nsuch economy as is possible during war.\r\n\r\nThe first feeble attempt to create a national currency was the\r\nissue of demand notes under the act of July 17, 1861, described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"And the Secretary of the Treasury may also issue, in exchange for\r\ncoin, and as part of the above loan, or may pay for salaries or\r\nother dues from the United States, treasury notes of a less\r\ndenomination then fifty dollars, not bearing interest, but payable\r\non demand by the assistant treasurer of the United States, at\r\nPhiladelphia, New York or Boston.\"\r\n\r\nThe fatal defect of these notes was the promise to pay on demand.\r\nHow could they be paid?  In what kind of money?  They could not be\r\npaid out of the current revenue, for that was insufficient to meet\r\ncurrent expenses.  No reserve was provided for their payment, and,\r\nwhen paid, there was no authority for their re-issue.  All other\r\nforms of securities bore interest, and these notes, not bearing\r\ninterest, were convertible into bonds and that was the end of them.\r\nIf that was the process why issue them at all?  They did not prevent,\r\nbut rather expedited, the disappearance of gold.  Of American silver\r\ndollars there were none.  Even the new fractional silver coins rose\r\nto a premium, and were hoarded or exported.  Still, the necessity\r\nexisted for some form of paper money that would be available for\r\ncirculation.  The solution of this problem was properly left to\r\nthe next regular session of Congress.\r\n\r\nCongress did not act upon the recommendations for internal taxes,\r\nbut this subject was also left over until the next session.  It\r\ndid provide, however, for a large increase of revenue from imports,\r\nmainly upon articles that were then free from taxation and upon\r\narticles regarded as luxuries; also for a direct tax on the states\r\nof $20,000,000, and for a graded tax, from and after the first day\r\nof January, 1862, upon the annual income of every person residing\r\nin the United States, from whatever source the income should be\r\nderived; if such annual income should exceed the sum of $800 a tax\r\nof three per cent. on the excess above that limit.  A provision\r\nwas made reducing the tax on incomes from treasury notes and other\r\nsecurities of the United States one-half.  The tax on incomes of\r\ncitizens of the United States residing abroad was placed at five\r\nper cent., except on that portion derived from interest on treasury\r\nnotes and other securities of the United States, which was taxed\r\none and one-half per cent.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was engaged in legislative duties in Washington,\r\nthe military forces of the Confederate States were gathering in\r\nVirginia, with the principal force at Manassas, about twenty-five\r\nmiles southwest of Washington, under the command of General\r\nBeauregard.  The Union troops, composed mainly of three months'\r\nvolunteers, were in camp occupying the region about Washington on\r\nboth banks of the Potomac River, under the immediate command of\r\nGeneral McDowell, but with Lieutenant General Scott in full command.\r\nI frequently visited the Union camps where the soldiers, fresh from\r\ncivil life and confident of easy success over the \"rebels,\" were\r\nbeing drilled.  The cry was, \"On to Richmond!\"  They could not\r\nforesee the magnitude of the task they had undertaken.  I will not\r\nattempt to narrate the incidents of the Battle of Bull Run.  I knew\r\nit was to be fought on Sunday, the 21st of July.  Soon after noon\r\nof that day I mounted my horse, and with James Rollins, a Member\r\nof Congress from Missouri, called on General Scott, and inquired\r\nfor news of the battle then going on.  He told us he was quite sure\r\nof a favorable result, but feared the loss of his gallant officers\r\nas, the troops being raw, it would be necessary for their officers\r\nto lead them.  We crossed the pontoon bridge from Georgetown, and\r\nthen, passing by Arlington, we went to a new fort on the main road\r\nfrom the Long Bridge.  As we approached we could hear the distant\r\nfiring of cannon.  We asked a sentinel on duty if he had heard the\r\nsound all day.  He said, \"Yes, but not so loud as now.\"  This was\r\nsignificant but not encouraging.  We returned to my lodgings on\r\nFifteenth street.  Everywhere there was an uneasy feeling.  At\r\neight o'clock in the morning I started for the residence of the\r\nSecretary of War to get information of the battle.  As I approached\r\nI was seized by the arm, and, turning, saw Secretary Cameron.  I\r\nasked about the battle, but, without answering, he hurried me into\r\nthe house and said:  \"Our army is defeated, and my brother is killed.\"\r\nHe then gave way to passionate grief.  His brother, Colonel Cameron,\r\nhad been killed, and the Union army was in full retreat.  I was\r\nenjoined to say nothing until morning.  I obeyed his injunction.\r\nAt eleven o'clock that night I heard the clatter of a horse's feet\r\nin full gallop.  My nephew, Robert McComb, a boy about nineteen,\r\na private soldier in an Ohio regiment, but detailed as an orderly,\r\nhad been sent to the rear with a message.  He saw the army in\r\nretreat, and, being well mounted and believing that discretion was\r\nthe better part of valor, rode rapidly to my lodgings in Washington.\r\nIt is uncertain whether he or \"Bull-Run\" Russell, an English\r\nreporter, made the best time to the Long Bridge.  McComb gave me\r\na doleful account of the battle and retreat.  The official reports\r\nfrom both armies show that it was a drawn battle.  General Sherman,\r\nin his \"Memoirs,\" gives a graphic history of the battle and expresses\r\nthe same opinion.\r\n\r\nStill, the battle of Bull Run was an important event.  It dispelled\r\nthe illusion of the people of the north as to the duration and\r\ngravity of the war.  It demonstrated the folly of ninety days'\r\nenlistments.  It brought also, to every intelligent mind, the\r\ndangers that would inevitably result from disunion.  On the 22nd\r\nof July, the day after the battle, the bill to authorize the\r\nemployment of 500,000 volunteers became a law.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July two bills, one for the increase of the military\r\nestablishment of the United States, and one to provide for the\r\nsuppression of the rebellion, were passed.  On the 5th of August\r\nan act passed for the better organization of the military establishment.\r\nArmed with the largest military power ever conferred upon a President,\r\nwith the almost unlimited power of taxation, the administration of\r\nMr. Lincoln entered upon the task before it.\r\n\r\nHaving passed these provisions in aid of the government, the special\r\nsession of Congress closed on the 6th of August, 1861.\r\n\r\nI immediately returned to my home at Mansfield.  Regiments were\r\nbeing organized but it seemed to me that the mode of enlistment\r\nwas too slow.  The people, though still resolute, were somewhat\r\ntroubled by the failure of military operations.  I felt this so\r\nstrongly that I determined at once to adopt some plan to raise a\r\nbrigade to be composed of two regiments of infantry, one battery\r\nof artillery and one squadron of cavalry.  When I made application\r\nto Governor Dennison for the requisite authority, he feared my plan\r\nmight interfere with existing organizations then being enlisted in\r\nthe different parts of the state, and I was persuaded to wait until\r\nafter the 15th regiment was recruited and in the field, and the\r\n42nd was well under way.  I also made up my mind to delay actual\r\nrecruiting until after the election in October of that year, so\r\nthat no political bias might enter into it.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of September I addressed a letter to the Hon. Simon\r\nCameron, Secretary of War, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, Ohio, September 24, 1861.\r\n\"Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I respectfully ask for an order granting me leave to\r\nrecruit and organize, in this part of Ohio, a brigade of two\r\nregiments of infantry, one squadron of cavalry, and two companies\r\nof artillery.  I know I can do it promptly.  The squadron of cavalry\r\nauthorized to Major McLaughlin may, if desired, be considered as\r\npart of the brigade.\r\n\r\n\"For reasons that are probably unjust the governor and state military\r\nauthorities are less successful than I hoped, and I know that I\r\ncan get you recruits that they cannot.  I wish no rank, pay, or\r\nexpenses for myself, and will freely act without compensation.  I\r\ncare not who are the field officers, so I know they are men of\r\nhonor, honesty and experience.  I will only ask of the department\r\nthe usual rations, pay and armament and equipage for the men; I\r\nask nothing for myself, will undertake upon my individual responsibility\r\nto purchase any of them desired, receiving in return government\r\nsecurities therefor.\r\n\r\n\"I will so execute the order as not to interfere with the state\r\nauthorities, and will act in subordination to them.  I will freely\r\nconfer with the government as to details, but would rather be left\r\nas free as practicable in the selection of officers.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, my dear sir, this application will receive your sanction,\r\nand I will stake my reputation and property that what I offer shall\r\nbe accomplished.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, in order to secure the active co-operation of\r\nSecretary Chase, I wrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, Ohio, September 24, 1861.\r\n\"Hon. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury:\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I have to-day written to General Cameron, asking an\r\norder allowing me to recruit a brigade in this part of Ohio.  I\r\nknow I can do it.  I ask no office, rank, pay, or expenses for\r\nmyself, and will undertake to recruit this force in subordination\r\nto the state and general government, and within such limits as may\r\nbe allowed.  Whatever may be the reason, it is manifest that\r\nvoluntary enlistment needs the spur of active exertion and\r\nsolicitation.  This I am willing to give, and, from offers freely\r\nmade to me by personal acquaintances, know that I can enlist hundreds\r\nwhom the state authorities cannot reach.\r\n\r\n\"Can I ask your favorable influence and co-operation?  I will pay\r\nmy own expenses, and ask only rations, tents and armament for the\r\nmen.  Any of these I am willing to purchase upon my individual\r\ncredit, receiving in payment government securities.  I pledge you\r\nmy reputation and all I am worth to accomplish what I offer.\r\n\r\n\"If it is objected that my operation will interfere with state\r\nenlistments, I will agree to subordinate my movements to the orders\r\nof the governor, but for the good of the service I hope to be left\r\nas free as possible.  In the selection of officers I should want\r\nto be especially consulted, so as to insure the honor, probity and\r\npersonal habits of such officers.  Further than this I have no\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\"If this meets your approbation promptly say so to General Cameron,\r\nand let him set me to work.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time I had arranged with Governor Dennison for a\r\nplan of enlistment which enabled the recruits to select their\r\nofficers, by allowing persons securing a certain number of recruits\r\nto be captains, a less number first lieutenants, and a less number\r\nsecond lieutenants.  The governor very kindly agreed that he would\r\ncommission the persons selected in this way, leaving the regimental\r\norganization to be composed of the best material that could be\r\nfound anywhere.  On the 28th of September I issued and distributed,\r\nmainly in the region near the line of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne &\r\nChicago railroad, this circular:\r\n\r\n\"TO THE YOUNG MEN OF OHIO.\r\n\r\n\"I am authorized by the governor of Ohio to raise at once two\r\nregiments of infantry and a battery of artillery, and a squadron\r\nof cavalry.\r\n\r\n\"I am also authorized to recommend one lieutenant for each company,\r\nwho shall at once receive their commissions and be furnished with\r\nproper facilities for enlisting.  I am now ready to receive\r\napplications for such appointments, accompanied with evidence of\r\ngood habits and character, the age of applicant, and his fitness\r\nand ability to recruit a company.\r\n\r\n\"Major Wm. McLaughlin will command the squadron of cavalry.\r\n\r\n\"The company officers will be designated by the soldiers of each\r\ncompany, subject to the approval of the governor.\r\n\r\n\"The field officers are not yet designated, but shall be men of\r\nexperience, and, if possible, of military education.\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers shall have, without diminution, all they are entitled\r\nto by law.\r\n\r\n\"Danger is imminent.  Promptness is indispensable.  Let the people\r\nof Ohio now repay the debt which their fathers incurred to the\r\ngallant people of Kentucky for the defense of Ohio against the\r\nBritish and Indians.  They now appeal to us for help against an\r\ninvasion more unjustifiable and barbarous.\r\n\r\n\"Letters can be addressed to me, marked 'Free,' at Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Mansfield, Ohio, September 28, 1861.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter thus rested until after the election on the 9th of\r\nOctober, when squads rapidly formed into companies, and within\r\ntwenty days Camp Buckingham was opened near Mansfield.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of this self-imposed duty, I encountered but\r\none difficulty, and at one time a very serious one, the selection\r\nof regimental officers, and especially of commanders of regiments.\r\nI knew that military warfare was an art, a trade, an occupation,\r\nwhere education, experience and preparation are absolutely essential\r\nto effective service.  The materials for soldiers abound everywhere,\r\nbut without discipline, order, obedience, and severe drilling men\r\nare not soldiers.  It was my desire to secure for the commanders\r\nof regiments two graduates of West Point.  I made application direct\r\nto Washington for various details of officers of the regular army,\r\nso that the soldiers in Camp Buckingham might have experienced\r\ndrill masters from the beginning.  I failed to receive an answer,\r\nand went to Washington, earnestly impressed with the importance of\r\nmy mission, and determined, if possible, that these men enlisted\r\nby me should not be placed in the front of the enemy until they\r\nhad had all the benefit they could derive from military discipline\r\nand drilling.  When I arrived I found that Secretary Cameron was\r\nindisposed to interfere with the purely military details of the\r\narmy, while General Scott, a brave old soldier whom I always loved\r\nand admired, was firmly of the opinion that the favorable result\r\nof the war depended upon strengthening the regular army, maintaining\r\nits force and discipline, and especially retaining its valuable\r\nofficers.  The regular army, almost disbanded at the beginning of\r\nthe war, was gradually filling up upon the basis of a new organization\r\nand long enlistments, but it was idle, it seemed to me, to expect\r\nthat the young men of the country would enlist in the regular\r\nservice.  While ready to respond to the call of their country in\r\nits actual peril, they had no purpose to become regular soldiers\r\nfor life.  It appeared to me, therefore, that the manifest policy\r\nof the government should be to allow the regular army to be gradually\r\nabsorbed into the volunteer service, where the young officers\r\neducated at the expense of the government might impart instruction\r\nto regiments and brigades, instead of to squads and companies.  I\r\nspoke to General Scott about this, and the result of my interview\r\nwas very unpleasant.  I fear we both lost our temper, though I\r\nnever ceased to respect the old general for the great service he\r\nhad rendered his country; but his day was past.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting Major Garesche, Assistant Adjutant-General, as to\r\nthe names of officers, I then applied to the President, explained\r\nto him fully the situation of affairs, my promise, the gathering\r\nof the soldiers in Camp Buckingham, their inexperience, and want\r\nof drill masters, their ardent patriotism, stated my interview with\r\nGeneral Scott, and appealed to him to help me out of the dilemma.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the interview with Mr. Lincoln, for he did\r\nnot hesitate, but sent for Major Garesche, and gave me the coveted\r\norder before I left him, directing the Secretary of War to detail\r\ntwo second lieutenants, James William Forsyth, of Ohio, and Charles\r\nGarrison Harker, of New Jersey, and Sergeants Bradley and Sweet, of\r\nthe regular army, for service in the Ohio Volunteers, under my\r\ndirection.  This order was the key that unlocked the difficulty\r\nand gave to the force the elements of military discipline.  At the\r\nsame time the requisite orders were given for uniforms, arms of\r\nthe best pattern, cannon, horses and various equipments.\r\n\r\nI then procured the detail of Major Robert S. Granger, of the United\r\nStates army, to command the camp and to organize the force.  He\r\nhad graduated as a cadet from Ohio, was one of the officers of the\r\nregular army surrendered by General Twiggs to the State of Texas\r\nbefore the beginning of the war, and had given his parole not to\r\nserve in the army until exchanged.  Though this was not held to\r\napply to the enlistment of volunteers he so construed his parole\r\nas to prevent him from serving in his regiment until duly exchanged.\r\nWhen this was done he entered the service and was rapidly promoted\r\nto Major General of Volunteers.\r\n\r\nWithin sixty days 2,340 young men of Ohio were formed into the 64th\r\nand 65th regiments, the 6th battery of artillery, and McLaughlin's\r\nsquadron of cavalry, armed with the best arms then in the service,\r\nuniformed, equipped and partly drilled as soldiers, ready to march,\r\nand actually marching, to the seat of war.  No better material for\r\nsoldiers, and no better soldiers in fact, ever enlisted in any\r\ncause or any service.\r\n\r\nI insert a letter from General Garfield written when he was in\r\ncommand of this brigade:\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters, 20th Brigade,                             }\r\n  \"In the Field, 6 Miles from Corinth, Miss., May 17, 1862.}\r\n\"Hon.

I have sent forward to\r\nWashington the name of Lt. D. G. Swain (65th Ohio) of Salem, O.,\r\nfor appointment as A. A. Gen. on my staff.  He is an excellent\r\nofficer, and his nomination has been approved by Gen. Buell.  I\r\nwill be particularly obliged to you if you will aid in securing\r\nhis appointment as soon as possible.

General Sherman said that\r\nfor aggressive movements, the United States would require 200,000\r\nmen.  This was so far beyond the ideas of the time that he was\r\nregarded as crazy, and was soon after relieved from his command by\r\nGeneral Buell.  Secretary Cameron was blamed for this, but his\r\nletter to me, here inserted, shows that he was absent from Washington\r\nwhen the order was made:\r\n\r\n  \"War Department, Nov. 14, 1861.\r\n\"Sir:--Your letter of the 10th inst. is received.

Since my return on the 11th, I have\r\nnot had time to make any inquiries concerning the cause of the\r\nchange, but I feel certain it was not from any want of confidence\r\nin the patriotism or capacity of your brother.  He has been ordered\r\nto Missouri, under the immediate command of Major General Halleck,\r\nof the regular army, and the fact that he has been so assigned is\r\nevidence of the confidence reposed in him.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n  \"Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nPASSAGE OF THE LEGAL TENDER ACT IN 1862.\r\nMy Interview with Lincoln About Ohio Appointments--Governmental\r\nExpenses Now Aggregating Nearly $2,000,000 Daily--Secretary Chase's\r\nAnnual Report to Congress in December, 1861--Treasury Notes a Legal\r\nTender in Payment of Public and Private Debts--Beneficial Results\r\nfrom the Passage of the Bill--The War Not a Question of Men, but\r\nof Money--Proposed Organization of National Banks--Bank Bills Not\r\nTaxed--Local Banks and Their Absorption by the Government--The 1862\r\nIssue of $150,000,000 in \"Greenbacks\"--Legal Tender Act a Turning\r\nPoint in Our Financial History--Compensation of Officers of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I had an interview with Mr. Lincoln which may be\r\nof interest.  In making the local appointments in Ohio he was\r\nnaturally governed largely by his strong affinities for old Whig\r\nassociates in Congress, of one of whom, General Schenck, he was\r\nespecially fond.  I thought some of his appointments in Ohio were\r\nnot judicious, and concluded I would go to him and make a general\r\ncomplaint of the distribution of these offices.  I felt that he\r\nfailed to consider the fact that the Republican party contained\r\nmany men who had not belonged to the Whig party.  I requested an\r\ninterview with him which was promptly granted, and called at his\r\noffice one evening.  He was seated in an easy chair and seemed to\r\nbe in excellent humor.  I proceeded to complain of some of his\r\nappointments in Ohio and as I progressed the expression of his face\r\ngradually changed to one of extreme sadness.  He did not say a\r\nword, but sank in his chair, placing his feet upon the table, and\r\nlooking, as I thought, the picture of despair.  I proceeded with\r\nmy complaint until I began mentally to reproach myself for bothering\r\nthe President of the United States with so unimportant a matter as\r\nthe choice of persons to fill local offices in Ohio, when the\r\ncountry was in the throes of revolution.  Finally I told him I felt\r\nashamed to disturb him with such matters and would not bother him\r\nagain with them.  His face brightened, he sat up in his chair and\r\nhis whole manner changed, until finally he almost embraced me.  He\r\nthen told me many interesting stories of his short service in\r\nCongress and of the men with whom he was brought in contact.  The\r\nclose of the interview was very pleasant and I kept my promise to\r\nhim about his appointments.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress convened on the 2nd of December, 1861, the financial\r\ncondition of the government was more alarming than at any other\r\nperiod during the war.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury had ample and complete authority,\r\ngiven him by the act of July, 1861, to borrow money on the credit\r\nof the government, but he could not deal with the system of state\r\nbanks then existing in the several states.  He was forbidden, by\r\nthe sub-treasury act of 1846, to receive notes of state banks and\r\nwas required to receive into and pay from the treasury only the\r\ncoin of the United States; but by the act of August 5, 1861, he\r\nwas permitted to deposit to the credit of the Treasurer of the\r\nUnited States, in such solvent specie-paying banks, as he might\r\nselect, any of the moneys obtained from loans, the moneys thus\r\ndeposited to be withdrawn only for transfer to the regularly\r\nauthorized depositaries, or for the payment of public dues, including\r\ncertain notes payable on demand, as he might deem expedient.  He\r\nhad, however, no authority to receive from individuals or banks\r\nany money but coin.\r\n\r\nThe coin received from the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia banks,\r\nin payment of their subscriptions to the government loans, to the\r\namount of nearly $150,000,000, had to be sent to every point in\r\nthe United States to meet public obligations, and, when thus\r\nscattered, was not readily returned to the banks, thus exhausting\r\ntheir resources and their ability to loan again.\r\n\r\nThe demand notes, authorized by the act of July 17, 1861, were also\r\npaid out by the treasury; but from time to time were presented for\r\nredemption in coin or in payment of customs duties to the exclusion\r\nof coin, and thus both the banks and the government were greatly\r\ncrippled, the banks suspending specie payments on the 30th day of\r\nDecember, 1861.\r\n\r\nAt this time an army of 500,000 Union soldiers was in the field,\r\nand a powerful navy, with vast stores of artillery and ammunition,\r\nhad been created.  In providing for their sustenance, comfort and\r\nequipment the government had been obliged to incur expenses far\r\nexceeding in magnitude any which had been hitherto known in its\r\nhistory, aggregating nearly $2,000,000 per day.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that a radical change in existing laws relating to\r\nour currency must be made, or the government would practically be\r\nunable to make the current disbursements on account of the war,\r\nand the destruction of the Union would be unavoidable, notwithstanding\r\nthe immense resources of the country which had then hardly been\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of Secretary Chase reached Congress on the 10th\r\nof December, having been delayed by the press of business.  So much\r\nof it as related to the currency was the basis of the long debates\r\nthat followed.  The circulation of the banks of the United States\r\non the 1st of January, 1861, was reported at $202,000,767.  Of this\r\n$152,000,000, in round numbers, was in the loyal states, including\r\nWest Virginia, and $50,000,000 in the rebel states, the whole\r\nconstituting a loan without interest from the people to the banks,\r\ncosting the latter only the expense of issue and redemption and\r\nthe interest on the specie kept in hand for the latter purpose.\r\nThe secretary called especial attention to the organization and\r\nnature of these banks, and questioned whether a currency of banks\r\nissued by local institutions under state laws was not in fact\r\nprohibited by the national constitution.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Such emissions certainly fall within the spirit, if not within\r\nthe letter, of the constitutional prohibition of the emission of\r\n'bills of credit' by the states, and of the making by them of\r\nanything except gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of\r\ndebts.  However this may be, it is too clear to be reasonably\r\ndisputed that Congress, under its constitutional powers to lay\r\ntaxes, to regulate commerce, and to regulate the value of coin,\r\npossesses ample authority to control the credit circulation which\r\nenters so largely into the transaction of commerce, and affects in\r\nso many ways the value of coin.  In the judgment of the secretary,\r\nthe time has arrived when Congress should exercise this authority.\"\r\n\r\nHe described with great force the weakness of the state banking\r\nsystem, and the repeated losses by the people of the United States\r\non account of the failure of such banks.  He recommended two plans\r\nby either of which he held that these banks might be absorbed, and\r\na national currency be substituted in the place of their issues.\r\nOne plan proposed the gradual withdrawal from circulation of the\r\nnotes of private corporations, and the issue in their stead of\r\nUnited States notes, payable in coin on demand, in amounts sufficient\r\nfor the useful ends of a representative currency.  The other proposed\r\na system of national banks authorized to issue notes for circulation\r\nunder national direction, to be secured as to prompt convertibility\r\ninto coin by the pledge of United States bonds and other needful\r\nregulations.  He discussed these two plans at length, but concluded\r\nby recommending a system of national banks, the advantages of which\r\nwould be uniformity in currency, uniformity in security, an effectual\r\nsafeguard against depreciation, and protection from losses from\r\ndiscounts and exchanges.  He expressed the opinion that such notes\r\nwould give to the government the further advantage of a large demand\r\nfor government securities, of increased facilities for obtaining\r\nthe loans required for the war, a reduction of interest, and a\r\nparticipation by the government in the profit of circulation without\r\nrisking the perils of a great money monopoly.  It will be noticed\r\nthat the secretary nowhere suggested the suspension of coin payments,\r\nor making the notes a legal tender in payment of public and private\r\ndebts, or the redemption in coin of the bank notes to be issued.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations were referred to the committee of ways and\r\nmeans of the House, and by it to a sub-committee, of which Elbridge\r\nG. Spaulding, of New York, was chairman.  Undoubtedly we owe to\r\nhim, more than to any other individual Member, the important and\r\nradical changes made in our currency system by the act reported by\r\nhim to the House and amended in the Senate.  Mr. Spaulding perceived\r\nthe objection to the recommendations of Secretary Chase that they\r\ndid not provide for any payments but in coin, or call for a suitable\r\nprovision that the notes when issued should be a legal tender for\r\npublic and private debts, or for their reissue in case of payment,\r\nnor did they provide for the absorption of the demand notes\r\noutstanding, which were, on their face, payable on demand, an\r\nobligation that could not be ignored without severely impairing\r\nthe public credit.  It was also apparent that the system of national\r\nbanks proposed by the secretary could not be organized and put in\r\neffective force for a year or more, and that in the meantime the\r\nstate banks would be in a condition of suspension, without coin or\r\nthe possibility of obtaining it, and, with no effective money which\r\nthe people were bound to receive, or which the government could\r\nreceive, it would have been difficult to carry on the operations\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nThe first bill introduced by Mr. Spaulding, on the 30th of December,\r\nmet some of these difficulties.  It provided for the issue of\r\n$50,000,000 treasury notes, payable on demand, the notes to be\r\nreceivable for all debts and demands due to or by the United States,\r\nto be a legal tender in payment of all debts, public or private,\r\nwithin the United States, and exchangeable at their face value,\r\nthe same as coin, at the treasury of the United States, and the\r\noffices of the assistant treasurers in New York, Boston, Philadelphia,\r\nSt. Louis and Cincinnati, for any of the coupon or registered bonds\r\nwhich the secretary was authorized to issue.  It also contained\r\nthis provision:  \"Such treasury notes may be reissued from time to\r\ntime as the exigencies of the public service may require,\" the\r\nfirst authority ever given for the reissue of treasury notes after\r\nredemption.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, 1862, Mr. Spaulding reported the bill to\r\nthe House with some important changes, and it soon became the\r\nsubject of a long and interesting debate.  On the 22nd of January,\r\nSecretary Chase returned Mr. Spaulding's bill to him and suggested\r\nsome modifications, referring to the legal tender clause as follows,\r\nbeing his first reference to that clause:\r\n\r\n\"Regretting exceedingly that it is found necessary to resort to\r\nthe measure of making fundable notes of the United States a legal\r\ntender, but heartily desiring to co-operate with the committee in\r\nall measures to meet existing necessities in the most useful and\r\nleast hurtful to the general interest, I remain,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the committee of ways and means, on the 29th of\r\nJanuary, the secretary said:\r\n\r\n\"The condition of the treasury certainly needs immediate action on\r\nthe subject of affording provision for the expenditures of the\r\ngovernment, both expedient and necessary.  The general provisions\r\nof the bill submitted to me seem to me well adapted to the end\r\nproposed.  There are, however, some points which may, perhaps, be\r\nusefully amended.\r\n\r\n\"The provision making United States notes a legal tender has\r\ndoubtless been well considered by the committee, and their conclusion\r\nneeds no support from any observation of mine.  I think it my duty,\r\nhowever, to say, that in respect to this provision my reflections\r\nhave conducted me to the same conclusion they have reached.  It is\r\nnot unknown to them that I have felt, nor do I wish to conceal that\r\nI now feel, a great aversion to making anything but coin a legal\r\ntender in payment of debts.  I has been my anxious wish to avoid\r\nthe necessity of such legislation.  It is, however, at present\r\nimpossible, in consequence of the large expenditures entailed by\r\nthe war, and the suspension of the banks, to procure sufficient\r\ncoin for disbursements; and it has, therefore, become indispensably\r\nnecessary that we should resort to the issue of United States notes.\r\n. . . Such discrimination should, if possible, be prevented; and\r\nthe provision making the notes legal tender, in a great measure at\r\nleast, prevents it, by putting all citizens, in this respect, on\r\nthe same level, both of rights and duties.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of February the secretary wrote to Mr. Spaulding as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Seward said to me on yesterday that you observed to him that\r\nmy hesitation in coming up to the legal tender proposition embarrassed\r\nyou, and I am very sorry to observe it, for my anxious wish is to\r\nsupport you in all respects.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that I came with reluctance to the conclusion that the\r\nlegal tender clause is a necessity, but I came to it decidedly,\r\nand I support it earnestly.  I do not hesitate when I have made up\r\nmy mind, however much regret I may feel over the necessity of the\r\nconclusion to which I come.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February the secretary became more urgent, and wrote\r\nto Mr. Spaulding the following brief note:\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I make the above extract from a letter received from\r\nthe collector of New York this morning.  It is very important the\r\nbill should go through to-day, and through the Senate this week.\r\nThe public exigencies do not admit of delay.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"S. P. Chase.\r\n\"Hon. E. G. Spaulding.\"\r\n\r\nIt will thus be perceived that, whatever may have been the\r\nconstitutional scruples of Secretary Chase in respect to the legal\r\ntender clause, he yielded to it under the pressure of necessity,\r\nand expressed no dissent from it until, as chief justice, his\r\nopinion was delivered in the case of Hepburn vs. Griswold, in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe bill, much modified from the original, passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives by the decided vote of yeas 93, nays 59.  As it\r\npassed the House it contained authority to issue, on the credit of\r\nthe United States, United States notes to the amount of $150,000,000,\r\nnot bearing interest, payable to bearer at the treasury of the\r\nUnited States, at Washington or New York.  It provided that\r\n$50,000,000 of said notes should be in lieu of the demand treasury\r\nnotes authorized by the act of July 17, 1861, and that said demand\r\nnotes should be taken up as rapidly as practicable.  It provided\r\nthat the treasury notes should be receivable in payment of all\r\ntaxes, duties, imports, excise, debts and demands of all kinds due\r\nto the United States, and all debts and demands owing by the United\r\nStates to individuals, corporations and associations within the\r\nUnited States, and should be lawful money and a legal tender, in\r\npayment of all debts, public and private, within the United States.\r\n\r\nThis bill came to the Senate on the 7th of February.  It was followed\r\non the same day by a letter from Secretary Chase to Mr. Fessenden,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--The condition of the treasury requires immediate legislative\r\nprovision.  What you said this morning leads me to think that the\r\nbill which passed the House yesterday will hardly be acted upon by\r\nthe Senate this week.  Until that bill shall receive the final\r\naction of Congress, it seems advisable to extend the provisions of\r\nthe former acts, so as to allow the issue of at least $10,000,000\r\nin United States notes, in addition to the $50,000,000 heretofore\r\nauthorized.  I transmit a bill framed with that object, which will,\r\nI trust, meet your approval and that of Congress.  Immediate action\r\non it is exceedingly desirable.\"\r\n\r\nThe request for authority to issue $10,000,000 additional demand\r\nnotes was immediately granted, and the bill was passed without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe currency bill was considered in the committee on finance of\r\nthe Senate, and four important and radical amendments were reported\r\nby that committee.  These amendments were as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst--That the legal tender notes should be receivable for all\r\nclaims and demands against the United States, of every kind\r\nwhatsoever, \"_except for interest on bonds and notes, which shall\r\nbe paid in coin_.\"\r\n\r\nSecond--That the secretary might dispose of United States bonds,\r\n\"at the market value thereof, for coin or treasury notes.\"\r\n\r\nThird--A new section authorizing deposits in the sub-treasuries at\r\nfive per cent., for not less than thirty days, to the amount of\r\n$25,000,0000, for which certificates of deposit might be issued.\r\n\r\nFourth--An additional section, No. 5, \"that all duties on imported\r\ngoods and proceeds of the sale of public lands,\" etc., should be\r\nset apart to pay coin interest on the debt of the United States;\r\nand one per cent. for a sinking fund, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was felt that if no provision was made for the payment of the\r\ninterest on the bonds in coin, they would depreciate more and more,\r\nwhile such payment would tend, as it did, to maintain them nearer\r\nto their specie standard.  In order to obtain coin for the payment\r\nof interest, provision was made that all duties on imported goods,\r\nand the proceeds of the sale of public lands, should be payable in\r\ncoin and be set apart to pay coin interest on the debt of the United\r\nStates, and one per cent. for a sinking fund to provide for ultimate\r\nredemption of the bonds.  These amendments were considered of prime\r\nimportance.  It was felt that the duty on imported goods should\r\nnot be lessened by any depreciation of our local currency.  Such\r\nimportations were based upon coin values, and the tax levied upon\r\nthem was properly required to be paid in coin.  This security of\r\ncoin payment enabled the government to sell bonds at a far higher\r\nrate than they would have commanded without it, and tended also to\r\nlimit the depreciation of United States notes.  The bill and\r\namendments were reported on the 12th, and became the subject of\r\nwhat was regarded as a very able debate.\r\n\r\nThere was decided opposition in the Senate to the legal tender\r\nclause, headed by Mr. Fessenden.  Mr. Collamer, who also was opposed\r\nto it, made a motion to strike it out.  Upon that subject I made\r\nmy first lengthy speech in the Senate, a few extracts from which\r\nI insert:\r\n\r\n\"The motion of the Senator from Vermont now for the first time\r\npresents to the Senate the only question upon which the members of\r\nthe committee of finance had any material difference of opinion,\r\nand that is, whether the notes provided for in this bill shall be\r\nmade a legal tender in payment of public and private debts.  Upon\r\nthis point I will commence the argument where the Senator from\r\nMaine left it.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I will say, every organ of financial opinion\r\n--if that is a correct expression--in this country agrees that\r\nthere is such a necessity, in case we authorize the issue of demand\r\nnotes.  You commence with the Secretary of the Treasury, who has\r\ngiven this subject the most ample consideration.  He declares, not\r\nonly in his official communications here, but in his private\r\nintercourses with the members of the committee, that this clause\r\nis indispensably necessary to the security and negotiability of\r\nthese demand notes.  We all know from his antecedents, from his\r\npeculiar opinions, that he would probably be the last man among\r\nthe leading politicians of our country to yield to the necessity\r\nof substituting paper money for coin.  He has examined this question\r\nin all its length and breadth.  He is in a position where he feels\r\nthe necessity.  He is a statesman of admitted ability, and\r\ndistinguished in his high opinion.  He informs us that, without\r\nthis clause, to attempt to circulate as money the proposed amount\r\nof demand notes of the United States, will prove a fatal experiment.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to his opinion, we have the concurring opinion of the\r\nChamber of Commerce of the city of New York.  With almost entire\r\nunanimity they have passed a resolution on the subject, after full\r\ndebate and consideration.  That resolution has been read by your\r\nsecretary.  You have also the opinion of the committee of public\r\nsafety of the city of New York, composed of distinguished gentlemen,\r\nnearly all of whom are good financiers, who agree fully in the same\r\nopinion.  I may say the same in regard to the Chambers of Commerce\r\nof the city of Boston, of the city of Philadelphia, and of almost\r\nevery recognized organ of financial opinion in this country.  They\r\nhave said to us, in the most solemn form, that this measure was\r\nindispensably necessary to maintain the credit of the government,\r\nand to keep these notes anywhere near par.  In addition, we have\r\nthe deliberate judgment and vote of the House of Representatives.\r\nAfter a full debate, in which the constitutionality, expediency\r\nand necessity of this measure were discussed, in which all the\r\nobjections that have been made here, and many more, were urged,\r\nthe House of Representatives, by a large vote, declared that it\r\nwas necessary to issue United States notes, and that this clause\r\nwas indispensable to their negotiation and credit. . . .\r\n\r\n\"A hard necessity presses the government.  $100,000,000 is now\r\ndue the army, and $250,000,000 more up to July first.  The banks\r\nof New York, Boston and Philadelphia, have exhausted their capitals\r\nin making loans to the government.  They have already tied up their\r\ncapital in your bonds.  Among others, Mr. Vail, the cashier of the\r\nBank of Commerce, the largest bank corporation in the United States,\r\nand one that has done much to sustain the government, appeared\r\nbefore the finance committee, and stated explicitly that the Bank\r\nof Commerce, as well as other banks of New York, could aid the\r\ngovernment no further, unless your proposed currency was stamped\r\nby, and invested with, the attributes of lawful money, which they\r\ncould pay to others as well as receive themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Bonds cannot be sold except at a great sacrifice, because there\r\nis no money to buy them.  As soon as the banks suspended, gold and\r\nsilver ceased to circulate as money.  You cannot sell your bonds\r\nfor gold and silver, which is the only money that can now be received\r\nunder the sub-treasury law.  This currency made a legal tender was\r\nnecessary to aid in making further loans.  I insisted that the bill\r\nwas constitutional.  The Senator from Vermont has read extracts\r\nfrom the debates in the national convention, and from Story's\r\n'Commentaries,' tending to show that Congress cannot authorize the\r\nissue of bills of credit.  But I submit to him that this question\r\nhas been settled by the practice of the government.  We issued such\r\nbills during the War of 1812, during the war with Mexico, and at\r\nthe recent session of Congress.  We receive them now for our\r\nservices; we pay them to our soldiers and our creditors.  These\r\nnotes are payable to bearer; they pass from hand to hand as currency;\r\nthey bear no interest.  If the argument of the Senator is true,\r\nthen all these notes are unauthorized.  The Senator admits that\r\nwhen we owe a debt and cannot pay it, we can issue a note.  But\r\nwhere does he find the power to issue a note in the constitution?\r\nWhere does he find the power to prescribe the terms of the note,\r\nto make it transferable, receivable for public dues?  He draws all\r\nthese powers as incidents to the power to borrow money.  According\r\nto his argument, when we pay a soldier a ten dollar demand bill,\r\nwe borrow ten dollars from the soldier; when I apply to the secretary\r\nof the Senate for a month's pay, I loan the United States $250.\r\nThis certainly is not the view we take of it when we receive the\r\nmoney.  On the other hand, we recognize the fact that the government\r\ncannot pay us in gold.  We receive notes as money.  The government\r\nought to give, and has the power to give, to that money, all the\r\nsanction, authority, value, necessary and proper, to enable it to\r\nborrow money.  The power to fix the standard of money, to regulate\r\nthe medium of exchanges, must necessarily go with, and be incident\r\nto, the power to regulate commerce, to borrow money, to coin money,\r\nto maintain armies and navies.  All these high powers are expressly\r\nprohibited to the states and also the incidental power to emit\r\nbills of credit, and to make anything but gold and silver a legal\r\ntender.  But Congress is expressly invested with all these high\r\npowers, and, to remove all doubt, is expressly authorized to use\r\nall necessary and proper means to carry these powers into effect.\r\n\r\n\"If you strike out the legal tender clause you do so with the\r\nknowledge that these notes will fall dead upon the money market of\r\nthe world.  When you issue demand notes, and announce to the world\r\nyour purpose not to pay any more gold and silver, you then tender\r\nto those who have furnished you provisions and services this paper\r\nmoney.  What can they do?  They cannot pay their debts with it;\r\nthey cannot support their families with it, without a depreciation.\r\nThe whole then depends on the promise of the government to pay at\r\nsome time not fixed on the note.  Justice to our creditors demands\r\nthat it should be a legal tender; it will then circulate all over\r\nthe country, and it will be the lifeblood of the whole business of\r\nthe country, and it will enable capitalists to buy your bonds.\r\nThe only objection to the measure is that too much may be issued.\r\nHe did not believe the issue of $150,000,000 would do any harm.\r\nIt is only a mere temporary expedient. . . .\r\n\r\n\"I have thus, Mr. president, endeavored to reply to the constitutional\r\nargument of the Senator from Vermont.  Our arguments must be\r\nsubmitted finally to the arbitration of the courts of the United\r\nStates.  When I feel so strongly the necessity of this measure, I\r\nam constrained to assume the power, and refer our authority to\r\nexercise it to the courts.  I have shown, in reply to the argument\r\nof the Senator from Maine, that we must no longer hesitate as to\r\nthe necessity of this measure.  That necessity does exist, and now\r\npresses upon us.  I rest my vote upon the proposition that this is\r\na necessary and proper measure to furnish a currency--a medium of\r\nexchange--to enable the government to borrow money, to maintain an\r\narmy and support a navy.  Believing this, I find ample authority\r\nto authorize my vote.  We have been taught by recent fearful\r\nexperience that delay and doubt in this time of revolutionary\r\nactivity are stagnation and death.  I have sworn to raise and\r\nsupport your armies; to provide for and maintain your navy; to\r\nborrow money; to uphold your government against all enemies, at\r\nhome and abroad.  That oath is sacred.  As a Member of this body,\r\nI am armed with high powers for a holy purpose, and I am authorized\r\n--nay, required--to vote for all laws necessary and proper for\r\nexecuting these high powers, and to accomplish that purpose.  This\r\nis not the time when I would limit these powers.  Rather than yield\r\nto revolutionary force, I would use revolutionary force.  Here it\r\nis not necessary, for the framers of the constitution did not assume\r\nto foresee all the means that might be necessary to maintain the\r\ndelegated powers of the national government.  Regarding this great\r\nmeasure as a necessary and proper one, and within our power to\r\nenact, I see plain before me the path of duty, and one that is easy\r\nto tread.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion to strike out the legal tender clause in the bill was\r\ndefeated by a vote of yeas 17, nays 22.  The amendments proposed\r\nby the finance committee were agreed to substantially as reported\r\nby the committee.  The bill finally passed by a vote of yeas 30,\r\nnays 7.  The House agreed to the amendment providing for the payment\r\nof the interest on bonds and notes in coin, and disagreed to the\r\nremaining amendments, and these were referred to a committee of\r\nconference, composed of Messrs. Fessenden, Sherman and Carlisle,\r\nof West Virginia, of the Senate and Messrs. Stevens, Horton, and\r\nSedgwick, of the House.  The conference met, and, after two or\r\nthree days of full discussion, the material parts of the disagreements\r\nbetween the two Houses were settled.  The provision that coin only\r\nbe received for duties on imports, and that it be held as a fund\r\nto pay the interest on the bonded debt, was retained.  The report\r\nof the conference was agreed to by both Houses, and on the same\r\nday the bill was approved by the President.  Thus, the legal tender\r\nact, after a most able and determined opposition, became a law on\r\nthe 25th of February, 1862.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to measure the beneficial results that rapidly\r\nfollowed the passage of this bill.  The public credit was greatly\r\nstrengthened by the provision for the payment of interest in coin\r\nfurnished by duties on imported goods.  The legal tender clause\r\nwas acquiesced in by all classes, and we had, for the first time,\r\nin circulation national paper money as the actual standard of value.\r\nIt was silent as to time of its payment, but each note contained\r\na promise of the United States to pay a specific sum, and the\r\nimplied obligation was to pay in coin as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July, 1862, a further issue of $150,000,000 United\r\nStates treasury notes (or \"greenbacks,\" as they were commonly called\r\nfrom their color) of the same description was authorized, and\r\nsubsequent issues increased the total amount to $450,000,000, the\r\nextreme limit.  By the act of March 31, 1863, fractional currency\r\nwas authorized to an amount not exceeding $50,000,000, to take the\r\nplace of fractional silver coins, which had entirely disappeared\r\nfrom circulation, and this amount was issued.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the legal tender act was the turning point of our\r\nphysical and financial history.  Less than a year before the\r\ngovernment was bankrupt; our bonds bearing six per cent. interest\r\nwere sold at a discount; our national expenditures exceeded our\r\nreceipts; loans could only be made upon the basis of coin, and this\r\ncoin was disappearing from circulation.  We had to appeal to the\r\npatriotism of bankers to accept the demand notes of the United\r\nStates as money, with no prospect of being able to pay them.  Our\r\nregular army was practically disbanded by the disloyalty of many\r\nof its leading officers.  Washington was then practically in a\r\nstate of siege, forcing me, in May, 1861, to go there at the heels\r\nof the 7th regiment of New York militia, avoiding the regular\r\nchannels of travel.  The city of Baltimore was decked under the\r\nflag of rebellion.  Through the State of Maryland, loyal citizens\r\npassed in disguise, except by a single route opened and defended\r\nby military power.  The great State of Kentucky, important as well\r\nfrom its central position as from the known prowess and courage of\r\nits people, hung suspended in doubt between loyalty and secession.\r\nIn the State of Missouri, St. Louis was the only place of unquestioned\r\nloyalty, and even there we regarded it a fortunate prize that we\r\nwere able to take the public arms from a government arsenal.  The\r\nwhole State of Virginia, with the single exception of Fortress\r\nMonroe, was in the possession of the revolutionary force.\r\n\r\nBut from the passage of the legal tender act, by which means were\r\nprovided for utilizing the wealth of the country in the suppression\r\nof the rebellion, the tide of war turned in our favor.  Delaware,\r\nafter a short hesitation, complied with the proclamation of the\r\nPresident.  Maryland had, by clear and repeated votes and acts,\r\narrayed herself on the side of the Union.  Her rebellious sons who\r\nfought against the old flag could not tread in safety on a single\r\nfoot of the soil of that state.  Western Virginia, the eastern\r\npeninsula, and many ports on the eastern coast, were securely\r\nreclaimed.  The State of Kentucky had distinctly, by the vote of\r\nher people, and by the action of all her constituted authorities,\r\nproclaimed her loyalty, and her sons were fighting side by side\r\nwith the soldiers of other states to expel traitors who, in her\r\ndays of doubt, had seized upon a small portion of her soil, which\r\nthey still occupied.  In the State of Missouri the constituted\r\nauthorities, organized by a convention of the people duly elected,\r\nwere sustained by physical power in nearly all the state, and the\r\nrebellion there was subsiding into bands of thieves, bridge burners,\r\nand small parties of guerillas, who could soon be readily controlled\r\nby local militia.  In nearly every rebellious state, the government\r\nhad secured a foothold, and an army of half a million men, armed,\r\norganized and disciplined, impatiently awaited the word of command\r\nto advance the old banner of our country against every foe that\r\nstood in its way.  Where does the history of nations present an\r\nexample of greater physical weakness followed so soon by greater\r\nphysical strength?  When have results more wonderful been accomplished\r\nin eight months?\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1862 we were physically strong but\r\nfinancially weak.  Therefore, I repeat, the problem of this contest\r\nwas not as to whether we could muster men, but whether we could\r\nraise money.  There was great wealth in the country but how could\r\nit be promptly utilized?  To that question the diligent attention\r\nof Congress was applied.  The banks which had aided us with money\r\nwere crippled and had suspended coin payments.  The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury was begging at the doors of both Houses for means to\r\nmeet the most pressing demands.  On the 15th of January, 1862, the\r\nLondon \"Post,\" the organ of Lord Palmerston, said:\r\n\r\n\"The monetary intelligence from America is of the most important\r\nkind.  National bankruptcy is not an agreeable prospect, but it is\r\nthe only one presented by the existing state of American finance.\r\nWhat a strange tale does not the history of the United States for\r\nthe past twelve months unfold?  What a striking moral does it not\r\npoint?  Never before was the world dazzled by a career of more\r\nreckless extravagance.  Never before did a flourishing and prosperous\r\nstate make such gigantic strides towards effecting its own ruin.\"\r\n\r\nThe legal tender act, with its provision for coin receipts to pay\r\ninterest on bonds, whatever may be said to the contrary by theorists,\r\nwas the only measure that could have enabled the government to\r\ncarry on successfully the vast operations of the war.  Our annual\r\nexpenditures at that time were four times the amount of our currency;\r\nwere three times the aggregate coin of the country; were greater\r\nthan any ever borne by any nation in ancient or in modern times.\r\nThe highest expenditure of Great Britain during her war with\r\nNapoleon, at a time when her currency was inflated, when she made\r\nthe Bank of England notes a legal tender, was but £100,000,000.\r\n\r\nAnticipating these enormous expenditures I introduced a bill which\r\nbecame a law on the 31st of July, 1861, which provided for a\r\ncommission to examine and report as to the compensation of all\r\noffices for the government, the commission to be composed of two\r\nMembers of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives,\r\none officer of the navy, and one officer of the army, who were\r\ndirected to examine and report, as soon as practicable, a fair and\r\njust compensation for each officer of the government, and such\r\nregulations as would secure a more economical collection of the\r\nrevenue.  When this bill was pending I stated its purpose and my\r\nhope to accomplish a reduction of the expenditures of the government,\r\nor, at least, an equalization of the salaries then paid to the\r\ndifferent officers.  We sought economy by the reduction of expenses.\r\nI was chairman of this commission, and Senator Clark, of New\r\nHampshire, was my associate.  The commission collected a mass of\r\ninformation, and upon it based several bills introduced in the\r\nsecond session of the 37th Congress.  Some of these were made\r\nnugatory by the rise of prices, measured in most cases by the fall\r\nin value of our currency, but many of their provisions were ingrafted\r\ninto other bills that became laws.\r\n\r\nThe organization of national banks, authorized to issue circulating\r\nnotes, is so intimately connected with legal tender United States\r\nnotes that I think it proper to consider them in connection, though\r\nthe banking law did not pass until 1863.  The two forms of currency,\r\none issued directly by the government as lawful money of the United\r\nStates and a legal tender, and the other issued by private\r\ncorporations, but secured by bonds of the United States, constitute\r\na system of national currency which, organized in the midst of war,\r\nwas an important aid to the government in its great struggle, and\r\nwhen placed at par with coin by the resumption act has proven to\r\nbe the best paper money created by legislation in this or any other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe issue of circulating notes by state banks had been the fruitful\r\ncause of loss, contention and bankruptcy, not only of the banks\r\nissuing them, but of all business men depending upon them for\r\nfinancial aid.  Inflation and apparent prosperity were often followed\r\nby the closing of one bank and distrust of all others.  The notes\r\nof a broken bank were rarely paid, the assets of such bank being\r\ngenerally applied to the payment of other liabilities, leaving the\r\nloss to fall on the holders of the notes, mostly innocent persons\r\nof limited means.  This led to the adoption in 1846 of the sub-\r\ntreasury system, by which all payments to the treasury were required\r\nto be in coin, to be held until required for disbursements on\r\ngovernment account.  This protected the United States, but it did\r\nnot save the people from loss, as, from necessity, they were\r\ncompelled to use bank bills authorized by the several states,\r\nvarying in value and security, and chiefly limited in circulation\r\nto the state in which issued.  With a narrow view of the powers of\r\nthe national government, Congress had repeatedly refused to authorize\r\na national bank, a policy I heartily approve, not from a doubt of\r\nthe power of Congress to grant such a charter, but from the danger\r\nof intrusting so vast a power in a single corporation, with or\r\nwithout security.  This objection did not lie against the organization\r\nof a system of national banks extending over the country, which\r\nrequired every dollar of notes issued to be secured by a larger\r\namount of bonds of the United States, to be deposited in the treasury\r\nof the United States, thus saving the note holder from all possibility\r\nof loss.\r\n\r\nSecretary Chase, in his report of December 9, 1861, recommended\r\nthat a tax be imposed upon notes issued by state banks and also\r\nthat Congress should exercise its authority to establish a system\r\nof national banks, with proper safeguards and limitations.  A bill\r\nwas introduced for the latter purpose in the House of Representatives\r\nin 1861, but, owing to the urgency for legislation on war measures,\r\nit was not acted upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nABOLISHMENT OF THE STATE BANKS.\r\nMeasures Introduced to Tax Them out of Existence--Arguments That\r\nInduced Congress to Deprive Them of the Power to Issue Their Bills\r\nas Money--Bill to Provide a National Currency--Why Congress Authorized\r\nan Issue of $400,000,000, of United States Notes--Issue of 5-20\r\nand 10-40 Bonds to Help to Carry on the War--High Rates of Interest\r\nPaid--Secretary Chase's Able Management of the Public Debt--Our\r\nInternal Revenue System--Repeal of the Income Tax Law--My Views on\r\nthe Taxability of Incomes.\r\n\r\nLong before I became a Member of Congress I had carefully studied\r\nthe banking laws of the several states.  The State of Ohio adopted,\r\nin 1846, an improved system of banking.  My study and experience\r\nas a lawyer in Ohio convinced me that the whole system of state\r\nbanks, however carefully guarded, was both unconstitutional and\r\ninexpedient and that it ought to be overthrown.  When I entered\r\nCongress I was entirely prepared, not only to tax the circulation\r\nof state banks, but to tax such banks out of existence.  But, while\r\nthis feeling prevailed in the west, the opposite feeling prevailed\r\nin the New England and Middle States, where their banking system\r\nhad been so improved that bank failures were rare, and bank bills\r\nwere protected by mutual guaranties.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury had, in two annual messages, proposed\r\na tax on the circulation of bank bills.  He believed that the\r\nexisting bank circulation prevented or embarrassed the process of\r\nfunding, by which alone the bonds of the United States could be\r\nabsorbed.  He was forbidden by law to receive bank bills in exchange\r\nfor bonds or for any purpose, so that the current money of the\r\npeople was not available for the purchase of bonds.  This was an\r\nadditional argument for taxing the state banks out of existence.\r\nI introduced a measure for this purpose as an amendment to the\r\nrevenue bill, but it was postponed to save it from defeat.\r\n\r\nI introduced a bill in January, 1863, containing two sections, the\r\nfirst to levy a tax of two per cent. per annum on the circulation\r\nof all bank bills, and the second to provide for a tax of ten per\r\ncent. on all fractional currency under one dollar issued by\r\ncorporations or individuals.  Upon this bill I made a carefully\r\nprepared speech, not only defending the proposed tax, but declaring\r\nmy purpose to urge a gradual increase of the tax until all state\r\nbank bills were excluded from circulation.  As the reversal of this\r\npolicy is threatened I feel justified in briefly restating the\r\nargument that induced Congress to deprive all state banks of the\r\npower to issue their bills as money.\r\n\r\nI drew the distinction between the ordinary powers of banking and\r\nthe issue of bank bills.  I said that the business of banking proper\r\nconsisted in loaning money, discounting bills, facilitating exchanges\r\nof productions by the agency of commercial paper, and in receiving\r\nand disbursing the deposits of individuals.  The issue of bank\r\nbills was an exclusive privilege conferred only on a few corporations.\r\nIt was a privilege that an individual could not enjoy.  No person\r\ncould issue his bills in the form of paper money without a corporate\r\nfranchise granted him and his associates, either by a general\r\nbanking law, or by an act of incorporation.  All the business of\r\nbanking might be exercised by private individuals except this\r\nfranchise.  There was no reason why any one individual or a\r\npartnership might not carry on all the business incident to banking\r\nexcept this one of issuing bills to circulate as money.  The largest\r\nbanking houses in the world did not exercise the privilege of\r\nissuing bills.  The strongest banks in the United States, such as\r\nthe Bank of Commerce of New York, had but little or no circulation,\r\nwhile the weakest banks supported themselves and made profit by\r\nissuing the largest quantity of bills authorized.  The law then\r\nexisting taxed heavily the business of banking proper.  All commercial\r\npaper--checks, drafts, orders, bills of exchange, protests, bonds\r\n--every instrument that was used in the ordinary process of banking\r\n--was heavily taxed, while bank bills were not taxed at all.  A\r\nprivate banker doing business had to pay a license of $100, but a\r\nbank of circulation was expressly exempted from the necessity of\r\nprocuring a license.  The tax law, as it stood, had this significant\r\nprovision:  \"But not to include incorporated banks legally authorized\r\nto issue notes as circulation.\"  Every commercial instrument was\r\nrequired to pay a stamp tax, but this did not attach to a bank\r\nbill.  Bank notes issued for circulation were expressly excepted.\r\nThe only tax levied upon banks of circulation was a tax of three\r\nper cent. on the net income.  This tax could be deducted from the\r\ndividend of the stockholders.  The discrimination in favor of banks\r\nof circulation ran through all the tax laws, while other corporations,\r\nsuch as railroad companies, insurance companies and the like, were\r\nsubject to heavy taxes.\r\n\r\nThe profits of banking were then very great.  The average profits\r\nof the banks of New York were twelve and one half per cent. per\r\nannum.  The burdens imposed upon the banks by their charters were\r\nlessened by the suspension of specie payments.  When the banks had\r\nto keep in their vaults coin to the amount of one-third of their\r\ncirculation, and were liable to be called upon any day for the\r\nredemption of their notes in gold and silver, they might claim\r\nexemption from taxes on their circulating notes.  But during the\r\nsuspension of coin payment there ws no such liability.  Whether\r\nright or wrong the banks suspended specie payments, and increased\r\ntheir currency without paying either principal of it or interest,\r\nor tax on it, though in direct violation of law in some states.\r\n\r\nI referred in my speech to an interview which was sought by the\r\nbanks of our chief commercial cities with the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, to which they invited the financial committees of the\r\ntwo Houses to hear their propositions for carrying on the financial\r\noperations of the government.  We all went to the office of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and the proposition was there made that\r\nthe United States should issue no paper money whatever, that the\r\nspecie clause, as it is called, of the sub-treasury act should be\r\nrepealed, and that we should carry on the war upon the basis of\r\nthe paper money of the banks, legalizing the suspension of specie\r\npayments, and that the government should issue no paper except upon\r\nan interest of six per cent., or higher if the money markets of\r\nthe world demanded more.  That was their plan of finance, the plan\r\nsubstantially adopted in the War of 1812, and which had been\r\ncondemned by every statesman since that time, a plan of carrying\r\non the operations of our government by an association of banks over\r\nwhich Congress had no control, and which could issue money without\r\nlimit so far as national laws affected it.  That was the scheme\r\npresented to us by very intelligent gentlemen engaged in the banking\r\nbusiness.  They were honest and in earnest, but it appeared to me\r\nas pretentious and even ludicrous.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed that a tax on banks interfered with vested rights.\r\nI said that all taxes that were levied by the government were to\r\nmaintain vested rights, liberty and life.  All these corporate\r\nfranchises were held subject to the power of taxation in Congress,\r\nwhich was sometimes necessary to be exercised in the most potent\r\nmanner in order to maintain the government.  The state could not,\r\nby an act of incorporation, place their property beyond the power\r\nof Congress.  The only question was what rate of taxation ought to\r\nbe adopted.  The rate proposed--two per cent.--I insisted was not\r\ntoo high, because it was only one-third of the profit derived from\r\nthe issue of paper money without interest, the principal of which\r\nwas not paid in coin.  I stated distinctly that the purpose of the\r\nbill was not merely to levy a reasonable tax on the banks, but also\r\nto induce them to withdraw their paper, in order to substitute for\r\nit a national currency.  I then reviewed in considerable detail\r\nthe history of our currency legislation, from the act chartering\r\nthe first bank of the United States to the beginning of our Civil\r\nWar, showing the view taken by the most eminent statesmen of our\r\ncountry in favor of the establishment of uniform national currency\r\nas the highest object of legislation.  Mr. Madison said in his\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n\"It is, however, essential to every modification of the finances\r\nthat the benefits of a uniform national currency should be restored\r\nto the community.  The absence of the precious metals will, it is\r\nbelieved, be a temporary evil; but, until they can again be rendered\r\nthe general medium of exchange, it devolves on the wisdom of Congress\r\nto provide a substitute which shall equally engage the confidence\r\nand accommodate the wants of the citizens throughout the Union.\"\r\n\r\nI said that when coin, the best of currency, was driven out of\r\ncirculation, by the existence of war or extraneous circumstances,\r\nit was the duty of Congress to provide a substitute.  In 1816\r\nCongress did this by establishing the Bank of the United States.\r\nMost of the state banks shortly afterward exploded, and almost\r\ntheir entire issue outstanding at the time fell as a loss to the\r\npeople of the United States.  The Bank of the United States did\r\nfurnish for a while a stable currency.  After its charter expired\r\nin 1836, the controversy was between gold and silver, and paper\r\nmoney as a currency.  Nearly all the statesmen of that time believed\r\nit was necessary to have a national currency in some form, but\r\nthere was a part in the country that believed the only true national\r\ncurrency was gold and silver coin.  After a controversy that I\r\nwould not review, the sub-treasury system was finally adopted.\r\nThe government had then no occasion to borrow money.  Its debt was\r\npaid off and there was a large surplus in the treasury, which was\r\ndistributed among the states.  The agency of a United States bank\r\nwas no longer necessary to sustain the public credit.  The object\r\nthen was to secure a safe deposit and custody of the public revenues.\r\nThe state banks failed to furnish a safe redeemable currency.  In\r\n1837 their notes were in the hands of the people, depreciated and\r\ndishonored, if not entirely worthless.  Therefore, I thought wisely,\r\nthe sub-treasury system was adopted, by which gold and silver coin\r\nwas the only money received or paid out by the government.  I\r\nbelieved that such was a true policy in the absence of national\r\nbanks.  I also stated that if peace were restored to our country,\r\nwe ought, as soon as possible, to go back to the basis of gold and\r\nsilver coin, but, in the meantime, we must meet the exigencies of\r\nthe hour.  Paper money was then a necessity.  Gold and silver were\r\nhoarded.  War always had led, and always would lead, to the hoarding\r\nof the precious metals.  Gold and silver flee from a state of war.\r\nAll nations in the midst of great wars have been compelled to resort\r\nto paper money.  It was resorted to by our fathers during the\r\nRevolution.  It was only by the use of paper money that England\r\nmaintained her wars with Napoleon.  At several periods during these\r\nwars gold and silver were at a greater premium in England than they\r\nwere in this country.\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to discuss the power of Congress to issue paper\r\nmoney.  I quoted an extract from the report of Mr. Dallas, in\r\nDecember, 1815, in which he stated:\r\n\r\n\"By the constitution of the United States, Congress is expressly\r\nvested with the power to coin money, to regulate the value of\r\ndomestic and foreign coin in circulation, and (as a necessary\r\nimplication from positive provisions) to emit bills of credit;\r\nwhile it is declared by the same instrument that 'no state shall\r\ncoin money, or emit bills of credit.'  The constitutional authority\r\nto emit bills of credit has also been exercised in a qualified and\r\nlimited manner. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The constitutional and legal foundation of the monetary system of\r\nthe United States is thus distinctly seen; and the power of the\r\nfederal government to institute and regulate it, whether the\r\ncirculating medium consist of coin or of bills of credit, must, in\r\nits general policy, as well as in the terms of its investment, be\r\ndeemed an exclusive power.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from a document of great ability, state the whole\r\nquestion in a few words.  Congress has the power to regulate\r\ncommerce; Congress has the power to borrow money, which involves\r\nthe power to emit bills of credit; Congress has the power to regulate\r\nthe value of coin.  These powers are exclusive.  When, by the force\r\nof circumstances beyond our control, the national coin disappears,\r\neither because of war or of other circumstances, Congress alone\r\nmust furnish the substitute.  No state has the power to interfere\r\nwith this exclusive authority in Congress to regulate the national\r\ncurrency, or, in other words, to provide a substitute for the\r\nnational coin.\r\n\r\nI next stated the objections to local banks.  The first was the\r\ngreat number and diversity of bank charters.  There were 1,642\r\nbanks in the United States, established by the laws of twenty-eight\r\ndifferent states, and these laws were as diverse, I might say, as\r\nthe human countenance.  We had the state bank system with its\r\nbranches.  We had the independent system, sometimes secured by\r\nlocal bonds, sometimes by state bonds, sometimes by real estate,\r\nsometimes by a mixture of these.  We had every diversity of the\r\nbank system in this country that has been devised by the wit of\r\nman, and all these banks had the power to issue paper money.  With\r\nthis multiplicity of banks, depending upon different organizations,\r\nit was impossible to have a uniform national currency, for its\r\nvalue was constantly affected by their issues.  There was no common\r\nregulator; they were dependent on different systems.  The clearing\r\nhouse system adopted in the city of New York applied only to that\r\ncity.  There was no check or control over these banks.  There was\r\na want of harmony and concert among them.  Whenever a failure\r\noccurred, such as that of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company,\r\nit operated like a panic in a disorganized army; all of the banks\r\nclosed their doors at once and suspended specie payments.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to these local banks was that of their unequal\r\ndistribution among the states.  In New England the circulation of\r\nthe banks was about $50,000,000, while in Ohio, a state with three-\r\nfourths of the population of all New England, it was but $9,000,000.\r\nThe contrast, if made with other states, was still more marked.\r\nI called attention to the fact that the circulation of banks in\r\nthe eastern states had then reached about $130,000,000, and of that\r\namount, $40,000,000 was circulating in the west.  If these notes\r\nwere driven out of circulation and the United States notes substituted,\r\na contribution would be made to the treasury of the United States\r\nof $2,400,000 a year, for the mere interest of a currency which\r\nthe west did not prefer, but was compelled to use.\r\n\r\nI called attention to the loss to the people by counterfeiting,\r\nwhich could not be avoided when we had such a multitude of banks.\r\nIt then required experts to detect counterfeits.  It was impossible\r\nto prevent counterfeiting.  An expert could save the banks, but\r\nthe loss fell upon the people.  By the substitution of national\r\ncurrency we substantially could lose nothing by counterfeiting.\r\nThe notes would be few in kind, only three or four of them, all\r\nissued by the United States, all of a uniform character, that could\r\nnot be counterfeited.  I described, with some detail, the loss to\r\nthe people of the United States by bills of broken banks, computed\r\nthem to be equivalent to five per cent. per annum of all the bills\r\nissued.  On an average, every twenty years the entire bank circulation\r\nceased to exist or deteriorated.\r\n\r\nThe loss of exchange from the west to the east on local currency\r\nwas one per cent.  This loss was usually made a gain to themselves\r\nby the bankers and \"shavers.\"  Under the most favorable state of\r\ntrade between the east and west an exchange of one per cent. was\r\ndemanded from drafts and bills of exchange.  With a national\r\ncurrency, uniform and equal throughout the country, this cost for\r\nexchange would not exist or would be greatly reduced.  I called\r\nattention to the then increasing volume of local currency in the\r\nUnited States.  When the United States had issued $250,000,000 of\r\nnotes, the banks had largely increased their circulation.  This\r\ntended to depreciate both United States and bank notes.\r\n\r\nI discussed at similar length the proposition that, as the states\r\nwere forbidden by the constitution to authorize the issue of bills\r\nof credit, they were equally forbidden to authorize corporations\r\nto issue circulating notes, which were bills of credit.  Upon this\r\npoint it seemed to me that the authorities were absolutely conclusive.\r\nThat position was taken by the most eminent members of the\r\nconstitutional convention, by Joseph Story in his \"Commentaries,\"\r\nby Daniel Webster, and other great leaders of both parties since\r\nthat time.  It was in reference to these bills that Mr. Webster\r\nused the language often quoted:\r\n\r\n\"A disordered currency is one of the greatest of political evils.\r\nIt undermines the virtues necessary for the support of the social\r\nsystem, and encourages propensities destructive of its happiness.\r\nIt wars against industry, frugality, and economy; and it fosters\r\nthe evil spirits of extravagance and speculation.  Of all the\r\ncontrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind, none\r\nhas been more effectual than that which deludes them with paper\r\nmoney.  This is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the\r\nrich man's field by the sweat of the poor man's brow.  Ordinary\r\ntyranny, oppression, excessive taxation, these bear lightly on the\r\nhappiness of the mass of the community, compared with a fraudulent\r\ncurrency, and the robberies committed by depreciated paper.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the bank circulation then afloat in the country, he\r\nfurther said:\r\n\r\n\"It is further to be observed that the states cannot issue bills\r\nof credit; not that they cannot make them a legal tender, but that\r\nthey cannot issue them at all.  Is not this a clear indication of\r\nthe intent of the constitution to restrain the states, as well from\r\nestablishing a paper circulation as from interfering with the\r\nmetallic circulation?  Banks have been created by states with no\r\ncapital whatever, their notes being put into circulation simply on\r\nthe credit of the state or the state law.  What are the issues of\r\nsuch banks but bills of credit issued by the state?  I confess,\r\nMr. president, that the more I reflect on this subject, the more\r\nclearly does my mind approach the conclusion that the creation of\r\nstate banks, for the purpose and with the power of circulating\r\npaper, is not consistent with the grants and prohibitions of the\r\nconstitution.\"\r\n\r\nI insisted that if there was no money in this country but United\r\nStates notes, the process of funding would be going on day by day.\r\nWhenever there was too great an accumulation of these notes they\r\nwould be converted into bonds; the operation would go on quietly\r\nand silently.  I quoted the authority of Secretary Chase that it\r\nwas his deliberate judgment, after watching this process with all\r\nhis conceded ability, that but for the influence of this local bank\r\npaper he would be able to carry on the war without the issue of\r\nmore paper money, that the currency then outstanding and that which\r\nby law he was authorized to issue would be sufficient to carry it\r\non.  Such a currency would lead to the conversion of the notes into\r\nbonds, and by this process the people would absorb the national\r\nloan and enable him to carry on the government without any sacrifice\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange that Mr. Jefferson, near the close of the War\r\nof 1812, stated more clearly than I could do the conflict between\r\nlocal bank paper and United States notes.  He, who during his whole\r\nlife was so mindful of the rights of the states, and so jealous of\r\npaper money, in brief and terse language designated the only way\r\nin which our country could carry on war.  In his letter to Mr.\r\nCooper, dated September 10, 1814, just at the close of the war, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The banks have discontinued themselves.  We are now without any\r\nmedium, and necessity, as well as patriotism and confidence, will\r\nmake us all eager to receive treasury notes, if founded on specific\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n\"Congress may now borrow of the public, and without interest, all\r\nthe money they may want, to the amount of a competent circulation,\r\nby merely issuing their own promissory notes of proper denominations\r\nfor the larger purposes of circulation, but not for the small.\r\nLeave that door open for the entrance of metallic money. . . .\r\nProvidence seems, indeed, by a special dispensation, to have put\r\ndown for us, without a struggle, that very paper enemy which the\r\ninterest of our citizens long since required ourselves to put down,\r\nat whatever risk.\r\n\r\n\"The work is done.  The moment is pregnant with futurity, and if\r\nnot seized at once by Congress, I know not on what shoal our bark\r\nis next to be stranded.  The state legislatures should be immediately\r\nurged to relinquish the right of establishing banks of discount.\r\nMost of them will comply, on patriotic principles, under the\r\nconvictions of the moment, and the non-complying may be crowded\r\ninto concurrence by legitimate devices.\"\r\n\r\nI also quoted another extract to show that this matter filled the\r\nmind of Mr. Jefferson.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Put down the banks, and if this country could not be carried\r\nthrough the longest war, against her most powerful enemy, without\r\never knowing the want of a dollar, without dependence on the\r\ntraitorous classes of her citizens, without bearing hard on the\r\nresources of the people, or loading the public with an indefinite\r\nburthen of debt, I know nothing of my countrymen.  Not by any novel\r\nproject, not by any charlatanry, but by ordinary and well-experienced\r\nmeans; by the total prohibition of all paper at all times, by\r\nreasonable taxes in war, aided by the necessary emissions of public\r\npaper of circulating size, this bottomed on special taxes, redeemable\r\nannually as this special tax comes in, and finally within a moderate\r\nperiod--even with the flood of private paper by which we were\r\ndeluged--would the treasury have ventured its credit in bills of\r\ncirculating size, as of five or ten dollars, etc., they would have\r\nbeen greedily received by the people in preference to bank paper.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January, 1863, I introduced in the Senate a bill to\r\n\"provide a national currency, secured by a pledge of United States\r\nstocks, and for the circulation and redemption thereof.\"  This bill\r\ntook the usual course, was referred to the committee on finance,\r\nwas reported favorably with a number of amendments, and was fully\r\ndebated in the Senate.  On the 9th of February, 1863, a cursory\r\ndebate occurred between Mr. Collamer, of Vermont, and myself, which\r\nindicated a very strong opposition to the passage of the banking\r\nbill.  Various amendments were proposed and some adopted.  I became\r\nsatisfied that if a strong effort was not made the bill would either\r\nbe defeated or postponed.  I then, without preparation, made a\r\nlong, and as I think, a comprehensive, speech covering the general\r\nsubject and its principal details.  It was the only speech of\r\nconsiderable length that was made in favor of the bill in the\r\nSenate.  There seemed to be a hesitancy in passing a measure so\r\nradical in its character and so destructive to the existing system\r\nof state banks.\r\n\r\nI said the importance of the subject under consideration demanded\r\na fuller statement than had as yet been made of the principle and\r\nobject of the bill.  It was the misfortune of war that we were\r\ncompelled to act upon matters of grave importance without that\r\nmature deliberation that would be secured in peaceful times.  The\r\nmeasure affected the property of every citizen of the United States,\r\nand yet our action for good or evil must be concluded within a few\r\ndays or weeks of that session.  We were to choose between a permanent\r\nsystem designed to establish a uniform national currency based on\r\nthe public credit, limited in amount, and guarded by all the\r\nrestraints which the experience of men had proved necessary, and\r\na system of paper money without limit as to amount, except for the\r\ngrowing necessities of war.\r\n\r\nI narrated the history of the bill, of its introduction in December,\r\n1861, its urgent recommendation by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nin two annual reports, and the conditions that then demanded\r\nimmediate action upon it.  I stated the then financial condition\r\nof the country.  Gold was at a premium of between fifty and sixty\r\nper cent. and was substantially banished from circulation.  We were\r\nin the midst of war, when the necessities of the government required\r\nus to have large sums of money.  We could not choose as to the mode\r\nin which we should get that money.  If we pursued the ordinary\r\ncourse, the course that had been sufficient in times of peace to\r\nraise money, of putting our bonds into the market and selling them\r\nfor what they would bring, it would be at a great sacrifice.  We\r\nknew this from the history of other nations and from our own\r\nexperience.  We therefore must look for some system of finance that\r\nwould give us all the aid possible, either in the form of paper\r\nmoney or by the agencies of associated banks.  We knew very well\r\nthat after the war was over the government would still be largely\r\nin need of money.\r\n\r\nI then reviewed the various financial measures since the commencement\r\nof the war.  We were then in the peculiar condition of a nation\r\ninvolved in a war without any currency whatever which by law could\r\nbe used in the ordinary transactions of public business.  Gold was\r\nwithdrawn by the suspension of specie payments.  The money of the\r\nbanks could not be used because the laws of the United States\r\nforbade it, and we were without any currency whatever.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, Congress had authorized the issue of $400,000,000\r\nof United States notes.  That this measure was wise but few would\r\ncontrovert.  We were compelled, by a necessity as urgent as could\r\nbe imposed upon any legislature, to issue these notes.  To the\r\nextent to which they were issued they were useful; they were a loan\r\nby the public and without interest; they were eagerly sought by\r\nour people; they were taken by our enemies in the south, by our\r\nfriends in the north; they were taken in the east and the west.\r\nThey furnished the best substitute for gold and silver that could\r\nthen be devised, and if we could limit United States notes to the\r\namount then authorized by law they would form a suitable and valuable\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nWe had but four expedients from which to choose.  First, to repeal\r\nthe sub-treasury act and use the paper of local banks as a currency;\r\nsecond, to increase largely the issue of United States notes; third,\r\nto organize a system of national banking, and fourth, to sell the\r\nbonds of the United States in the open market.  I discussed each\r\nof these expedients in considerable detail.  The practical objection\r\nto the further issue of United States notes was that there was no\r\nmode of redemption; they were safe; they were of uniform value,\r\nbut there was no mode pointed out by which they were to be redeemed.\r\nNo one was bound to redeem them.  They were receivable but not\r\nconvertible.  They were debts of the United States but could not\r\nbe presented anywhere for redemption.  No man could present them\r\nexcept for the purpose fo funding them into the bonds of the United\r\nStates.  They were not convertible into coin.  They lacked that\r\nessential element in currency.\r\n\r\nAnother objection was that they were made the basis of state bank\r\nissues.  Under the operation of the act declaring United States\r\nnotes to be a legal tender, the state bank circulation had increased\r\nfrom $120,000,000 to $167,000,000.  The banks sold their gold at\r\na large premium, and placed in their vaults United States notes\r\nwith which to redeem their own notes.  While the government had\r\nbeen issuing its paper money some of the banks were inflating the\r\ncurrency, by issuing paper money on the basis of United States\r\nmoney.  Illustrations of this inflation were given of existing\r\nbanks, showing enormous issues based upon a comparatively small\r\namount of legal tender notes.  The issue of United States notes by\r\nthe government, and the making them a legal tender, was made the\r\nbasis of an inflated bank circulation in the country, and there\r\nwas no way to check this except by uniting the interest of the\r\ngovernment, the banks, and the people, together, by one uniform\r\ncommon system.\r\n\r\nI said that during war local banks were the natural enemies of a\r\nnational currency.  They were in the War of 1812.  Whenever specie\r\npayment was suspended, the power to issue a bank note was the same\r\nas the power to coin money.  The power granted to the Bank of France\r\nand the Bank of England to issue circulating notes was greatly\r\nabused during the period of war.  It was a power that ought never\r\nto be exercised except by the government, and only when the state\r\nwas in danger.  It was the power to coin money, because when a bank\r\nissued its bill without the restraint of specie payments, it\r\nsubstantially coined money and false money.  This was a privilege\r\nthat no nation could safely surrender to individuals or banks.\r\nUpon this point I cited a number of authorities, not only in our\r\nown country, but in Europe.  While I believed that no system of\r\npaper money should depend upon banks, I was far from objecting to\r\ntheir agency.  They were useful and necessary mediums of exchange,\r\nindispensable in all commercial countries.  The only power they\r\nderived from corporation not granted to all citizens was to issue\r\nnotes as money, and this power was not necessary to their business\r\nor essential to their profit.  Their business connected them with\r\nthe currency, and whether it should be gold or paper they were\r\ndeeply interested in its credit and value.  Was it not then possible\r\nto preserve to the government the exclusive right to issue paper\r\nmoney, and yet not injuriously affect the local banks?  This was\r\nthe object of that bill.\r\n\r\nBut, it was asked, why look at all to the interest of the banks,\r\nwhy not directly issue the notes of the government, and thus save\r\nto the people the interest on the debt represented by the notes in\r\ncirculation?  The only answer to this was that history taught us\r\nthat the public faith of a nation alone is not sufficient to maintain\r\na paper currency.  There must be a combination between the interests\r\nof private individuals and the government.  Our revolutionary\r\ncurrency, continental money, depreciated until it became worthless.\r\nThe assignats of France, issued during her revolutionary period,\r\nshared the same fate.  Other European countries which relied upon\r\ngovernment money alone had a similar experience.  An excessive\r\nissue of paper money by the government would produce bankruptcy\r\nand repudiation, not only of the notes abroad, but of bonds also.\r\nThe government of the United States had in circulation nearly\r\n$400,000,000 United States notes.  We had a bank circulation of\r\n$160,000,000.  If we increased our circulation, as was then proposed,\r\nit would create an inflation that would evidently lead to the\r\nderangement of all business affairs in the country.  Whatever might\r\nbe the hazards, we had to check this over expansion and over issue.\r\nIf a further issue of United States notes were authorized, it would\r\nbe at once followed by the issue of more bank paper, and then we\r\nwould have the wildest speculation.  Hitherto the inflation had\r\nnot extended to many articles.  Real estate had not been much\r\naffected by it.\r\n\r\nThe question then occurred whether the bank bill proposed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and introduced by me into the Senate,\r\nwould tend to secure a national currency beyond the danger of\r\ninflation.  This, the principal question involved, was discussed\r\nat length.  I contended that the notes issued would be convertible\r\ninto United States notes while the war lasted, and afterwards into\r\ncoin; that the currency would be uniform, of universal credit in\r\nevery part of the United States, while the bank bills, which it\r\nwould supersede, were current only in the states in which they were\r\nissued.  It would furnish a market for our bonds by requiring them\r\nto be held as the security for bank notes, and thus advance the\r\nvalue of the bonds.  The state bank bills would be withdrawn, and\r\nthe state banks would be converted into national banks with severe\r\nrestrictions as to the amount of notes issued, and these only issued\r\nto them by the general government upon ample security.  The similarity\r\nof notes all over the United States would give them a wider\r\ncirculation.  I insisted that the passage of the bill would promote\r\na sentiment of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe policy of this country ought to be to make everything national\r\nas far as possible.  If we were dependent on the United States for\r\na currency and a medium of exchange, we would have a broader and\r\nmore prosperous nationality.  The want of such nationality, I then\r\ndeclared, was one of the great evils of the times; and it was that\r\nprinciple of state rights, that bad sentiment that had elevated\r\nstate authority above the great national authority, that had been\r\nthe main instrument by which our government was sought to be\r\noverthrown.  Another important advantage the banks would derive\r\nfrom this system, I urged, would be that their notes would be\r\nguarded against all frauds and all alterations.  There would be\r\nbut five or six kinds of notes in the United States, instead of\r\nthe great diversity there was then.  In 1862 the number of banks\r\nexisting was 1,500, and the number whose notes were not counterfeited\r\nwas 253.  The number of kinds of \"imitations\" was 1,861.  The number\r\nof kinds of \"alterations\" was 3,039.  The number of kinds of\r\n\"spurious\" was 1,685.  This was the kind of currency that was\r\nproposed to be superseded.  Under the new system, the banks would\r\nbe relieved from all this difficulty.\r\n\r\nOther advantages to the banks would be that they might become\r\ndepositaries of the public money, that their notes, being amply\r\nsecured, would be received in all payments due to or from the United\r\nStates, while the notes of state banks could not be so received,\r\nas they were dishonored and disgraced from the beginning, being\r\nrefused by the national government.\r\n\r\nThis is an imperfect view of the question as it was then presented\r\nto my mind.  I knew the vote upon the passage of the bill would be\r\ndoubtful.  The New England Senators, as a rule, voted for the bill,\r\nbut Senators Collamer and Foote had taken decided grounds against\r\nit, and it was believed that Mr. Anthony and his colleague would\r\ndo likewise.  I informed Secretary Chase of my doubt as to the\r\npassage of the bill, and especially whether Mr. Anthony would vote\r\nfor it; without his vote I did not think it would pass.  Mr. Chase\r\ncalled at the Senate and had an interview with Mr. Anthony, in my\r\npresence, in which he urged him strongly, on national grounds, to\r\nvote for the bill, without regard to local interests in his own\r\nstate.  His remarks made an impression upon Mr. Anthony who finally\r\nexclaimed that he believed it to be his duty to vote for the bill,\r\nalthough it would be the end of his political career.  When the\r\nvote was taken his name was the first recorded in favor of the\r\nbill.  It passed by a vote of 23 yeas and 21 nays, so that I was\r\nentirely correct that if he had voted against the bill it would\r\nhave been defeated by a tie vote.\r\n\r\nThese two measures, the absorption of the state banks, and the\r\nestablishment of the system of national banks, taken in connection\r\nwith the legal tender act, were the most important financial measures\r\nof the war, and, tested by time, have fully realized the anticipations\r\nand confident assurance of their authors.\r\n\r\nThis system of national banks has furnished to the people of the\r\nUnited States a currency combining the national faith with the\r\nprivate stock and private credit of individuals.  They have a\r\ncurrency that is safe, uniform, and convertible.  Not one dollar\r\nof the notes issued by national banks has been lost to any person\r\nthrough the failure of a bank.  We have a currency limited in\r\namount, restrained and governed by law, checked by the power of\r\nvisitation and by the limitation of liabilities, safe, uniform,\r\nand convertible in every part of the country.  Every one of these\r\nconditions prophesied by me has been literally realized.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to a national currency was the problem of the\r\npublic debt.  The issue of $50,000,000, demand notes, authorized\r\nin 1861, was a forced expedient to meet immediate demands.  A\r\nprudent man, engaged in business, would not borrow money payable\r\non call unless he had securities which he could immediately convert\r\ninto money.  Such liabilities are proper in a stock exchange or in\r\na gambling operation, to be settled by the receipt or payment of\r\nbalances on the rise or fall in the market of stocks or produce.\r\nThese demand notes gave Secretary Chase more trouble than any other\r\nsecurity, and they were finally absorbed in the payment of customs\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July, 1861, Congress authorized the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to borrow, on the credit of the United States, within\r\ntwelve months, $250,000,000, for which he was authorized to issue\r\nbonds, coupon or registered, or treasury notes, the bonds to bear\r\ninterest not exceeding seven per cent., payable semi-annually,\r\nirredeemable for twenty years.  The treasury notes were to be of\r\nany denominations fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, not less\r\nthan fifty dollars, and to be payable three years after date, with\r\ninterest at the rate of seven and three-tenths per cent. per annum,\r\npayable semi-annually.  He was also authorized to issue, in exchange\r\nfor coin, as a part of the loan of $250,000,000, treasury notes\r\npayable on demand, already referred to, or treasury notes bearing\r\ninterest at the rate of three and sixty-five hundredths per cent.\r\nper annum, and payable in one year from date and exchangeable at\r\nany time for treasury notes of fifty dollars and upwards.  These\r\nforms of security were the most burdensome that were issued by the\r\ngovernment during the war.  The terms of these securities were\r\nsomewhat altered by the act approved August 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nThese laws were superseded by the act of February 28, 1862, which\r\nmay be regarded as the most important loan law passed during the\r\nwar.  It authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue, on the\r\ncredit of the United States, $150,000,000 of United States notes,\r\ncommonly called greenbacks, already described.  Of these, $50,000,000\r\nwere to be in lieu of the demand treasury notes authorized to be\r\nissued by the act of July, 1861, above referred to.  It also\r\nauthorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue $500,000,000 of\r\ncoupon, or registered, bonds, redeemable at the pleasure of the\r\nUnited States after five years, and payable twenty years from date,\r\nbearing interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum, payable\r\nsemi-annually.  These are what were known as the 5-20 bonds.  In\r\nreference to these securities, Secretary Chase, in his report of\r\nDecember 4, 1862, said:\r\n\r\n\"These measures have worked well.  Their results more than fulfilled\r\nthe anticipations of the secretary.  The rapid sale of the bonds,\r\naided by the issue of United States notes, furnished the means\r\nnecessary for the conduct of the war during that year.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of March, 1863, the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nauthorized to borrow, from time to time, on the credit of the United\r\nStates, a sum not exceeding $300,000,000 for the current fiscal\r\nyear, and $600,000,000 for the next fiscal year, payable in coin,\r\nat the pleasure of the government, after such periods as may be\r\nfixed by the secretary, not less than ten, or more than forty,\r\nyears from date.  These bonds, known as the 10-40's, bearing five\r\nper cent. interest, were exempt from taxation by or under state or\r\nmunicipal authority.  This act also provided for the issue of a\r\nlarge increase of non-interest bearing treasury notes, which were\r\nmade lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts, public\r\nor private, within the United States, except for duties on imported\r\ngoods and interest on the public debt.  Additional 10-40 bonds were\r\nauthorized by the act of June 30, 1864.  But it may be said that\r\nthe 5-20 and 10-40 bonds became the well-known, recognized securities\r\nof the United States, the sale of which at par, in connection with\r\nthe treasury notes of different forms, furnished the United States\r\nthe money to carry on the war.  In the sale of these securities\r\nthe secretary was actively assisted by the banks and bankers of\r\nthe United States, and especially by Jay Cooke, who was the most\r\neffective agent of the government in the sale of 5-20 bonds.\r\n\r\nSecretary Chase, in his report of December 10, 1863, discussed at\r\nlength the objects to be kept studiously in view in the creation\r\nof debt by negotiations of loans or otherwise:  First, moderate\r\ninterest; second, general distribution; third, future controllability;\r\nand, fourth, incidental utility.\r\n\r\nThe first loans were made upon the extravagant rate of interest of\r\nseven and three-tenths per cent.  The reason for this was the fact\r\nthat there was no currency the secretary could receive in exchange\r\nfor bonds.  As already stated, specie payments were suspended by\r\nthe banks December 31, 1861.  He was forbidden by law to receive\r\nbank bills, and he knew that Congress would not and ought not to\r\nrepeal this law.  After such suspension coin was scarce and difficult\r\nto obtain.  Afterwards, when the legal tender notes were authorized\r\nand issued, he sold his bonds bearing six per cent. interest at\r\npar for notes, but these notes had already largely depreciated\r\ncompared with coin.  Still, they were money, readily taken for all\r\nsupplies, and enabled him to sell securities running a shorter\r\nperiod.  A diversity of securities maturing at different times were\r\nexchanged for notes, and finally he was able to sell five per cent.\r\nbonds at par, so that, on the 30th of September, 1863, two months\r\nprevious to his report, securities and notes then outstanding\r\namounted to $1,222,113,559.  The fist bonds were irredeemable for\r\ntwenty years.  The second bonds were redeemable in five, but payable\r\nin twenty, years.  The third bonds, bearing five per cent. interest,\r\nwere redeemable after ten years.  It will be perceived that under\r\nthis arrangement the rate of interest on securities issued was\r\nconstantly reduced.  The notes received in payment of bonds\r\ndepreciated or advanced in sympathy with the progress of our armies\r\nand the prospects of success.  The general purpose was to secure\r\nas low a rate of interest as possible, to distribute the securities\r\namong the largest number of persons possible, to provide the best\r\nmode, time and terms for redemption, and to put the securities in\r\nsuch form as to be used as a currency.  No one can question the\r\nwisdom of the management of the public debt by Secretary Chase.\r\n\r\nThe origin and development of the present system of internal taxes\r\nmust be interesting to every student of finance.  The policy of\r\nthe government had been to confine, as far as possible, national\r\ntaxes to duties on imports, and, in ordinary times, this source of\r\nrevenue, exclusively vested in the United States, together with\r\nthe proceeds of the sale of public lands, was ample to defray the\r\ncurrent expenses of the government.  During and shortly after the\r\nWar of 1812 resort was had to direct taxes apportioned among the\r\nstates respectively, and to internal taxes authorized by the\r\nconstitution under the name of excises, but the necessities of the\r\ntreasury becoming more urgent, and the reliance on the public credit\r\nbecoming more hazardous, Congress, at the special session which\r\nconvened in May, 1813, determined to lay the foundations of a system\r\nof internal revenue, selecting in particular those subjects of\r\ntaxation which would be least burdensome.  These taxes were at\r\nfirst limited to one year, but were extended from time to time, so\r\nthat they acquired the name of \"war taxes.\"  A direct tax of\r\n$3,500,000 was laid upon the United States, and apportioned among\r\nthe states respectively for the year 1814.  Taxes were imposed on\r\nsugar refined in the United States, on carriages, on licenses to\r\ndistillers of spirituous liquors, and other forms of internal\r\nproduction.  It was estimated that the internal taxes and the direct\r\ntax would yield $3,500,000.  For the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1815, internal taxes yielded $5,963,000.  In 1816 they yielded\r\n$4,396,000.  In 1817 they yielded $2,676,000, after which there\r\nwas no revenue from internal taxes except from the collection of\r\narrears, amounting in 1818 to $947,946, the law providing for such\r\ntaxes having expired by limitation.  A comparison between the\r\nreceipts from this source then and the receipts subsequently derived\r\nfrom internal revenue, is a significant indication of the difference\r\nin population and wealth between 1812 and 1862.\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil War commenced and the necessity of a large increase\r\nof revenue became apparent, Secretary Chase, in his report to\r\nCongress of the date of July 4, 1861, called attention to the\r\nnecessity of provision for a gradual increase in the revenue to\r\nmaintain the public credit, and to meet the current demands.  His\r\nrecommendation as to internal taxes has already been referred to.\r\nThe act of August 5, 1861, previously mentioned, levied a direct\r\ntax of $20,000,000 and an income tax.  This act proved to be a\r\ncrude and imperfect measure, and it was modified or superseded by\r\nthe act of July 1, 1862.  This act, carefully framed, was the basis\r\nof the present system of internal revenue.  It created a new office\r\nin the treasury department, to be called the office of commissioner\r\nof internal revenue.  No less than thirteen acts of Congress were\r\npassed prior to August 1, 1866, enlarging and defining the duties\r\nof the office, and prescribing the taxes imposed by these several\r\nlaws.  When this act was first framed we anticipated much greater\r\ndifficulties in the collection of the tax than actually occurred.\r\nWe had doubts whether the taxation imposed by this law would be\r\npatiently submitted to by our constituents, but these misgivings\r\nsoon disappeared and the taxes imposed by that act were cheerfully\r\nand promptly paid.  I gave to the study and consideration of this\r\nact, and the various amendatory acts, a large portion of my time.\r\nAt the end of the war internal taxes were cheerfully paid by the\r\npeople, and yielded far more revenue to the government than the\r\ncustoms duties and all other sources of revenue combined.\r\n\r\nThe receipts from internal revenue for the first four years under\r\nthis law were as follows;\r\n\r\n  For the year ending June 30, 1863 . . . . $37,640,787\r\n  For the year ending June 30, 1864 . . . . 117,145,748\r\n  For the year ending June 30, 1865 . . . . 211,129,529\r\n  For the year ending June 30, 1866 . . . . 310,906,984\r\n\r\nThese taxes were mainly upon spirits, tobacco and beer, but they\r\nalso included stamp taxes of various kinds, special taxes on\r\nparticular industries, and income taxes, so that practically nearly\r\nall forms of domestic manufactures were subject to a greater or\r\nless tax, according to the nature of the article.  So sweeping were\r\nthe provisions that it was frequently a matter of joke as well as\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nSome one remarked to Senator Collamer that everything was taxed\r\nexcept coffins.  He rejoined:  \"Don't say that to Sherman or he\r\nwill have them on the tax list before night!\"\r\n\r\nThe general prosperity that existed during the war under such a\r\nburden of taxation was frequently a matter of surprise.  The truth\r\nis that all productive industries were active because of the enormous\r\ndemand made by the army for supplies of all kinds, and everyone\r\nwho was willing to work could find plenty of employment.  The\r\ndepreciation of the currency caused by the war did not embarrass\r\nanyone, as the interest on securities was promptly paid in coin,\r\nand greenbacks were the favorite currency of the people.  The people\r\ndid not stop to inquire the causes of the nominal advance in prices;\r\nthey only knew that the United States note was cheerfully received\r\nin every part of the United States as the current money of the\r\ncountry.  At the beginning the tax on whisky was 20 cents per\r\ngallon, but it was gradually increased until it reached $2 a gallon,\r\nwhen frauds and illicit distilling became serious evils.  The tax\r\nwas then reduced to 90 cents a gallon.\r\n\r\nWhen I became Secretary of the Treasury, I was impressed with the\r\nmagnitude of illicit distilling, even after the rate was reduced.\r\nAt that time several hundred men, mostly in the mountain regions\r\nof North Carolina and Tennessee, were under arrest for violation\r\nof the laws against illicit distilling.  A delegation of them,\r\naccompanied by Senator Ransom, appeared before me, and I heard\r\ntheir apologies for distilling, and their complaints against the\r\nofficers.  We entered into a formal engagement by which they agreed\r\nto stop illicit distilling upon condition that they should be\r\nrelieved of punishment for their past acts, and, so far as I could\r\nlearn, they substantially observed their obligation.  As a rule,\r\nthey were rough mountaineers who regarded whisky as a prime necessity\r\nof life, and thought they ought to be allowed to convert their\r\ngrain into something better.\r\n\r\nAs the necessity for excessive taxation diminished after the war\r\nwas over, taxes on various articles were gradually repealed, until,\r\nin 1894, they consisted of practically four items, spirits, tobacco,\r\nfermented liquors, and oleomargarine.  These are the figures for\r\ntwo years:\r\n\r\n                       Receipts during fiscal years\r\n  Objects of Taxation.       ended June 30--\r\n                            1893.           1894.\r\n  Spirits . . . . . .  $94,720,260.55  $85,259,252.25\r\n  Tobacco . . . . . .   31,889,711.74   28,617,898.62\r\n  Fermented Liquors .   32,548,983.07   31,414,788.04\r\n  Oleomargarine . . .    1,670,643.50    1,723,479.90\r\n\r\nIn respect to these taxes, that on oleomargarine was not intended\r\nas, nor is it, a very material revenue tax.  The purpose was\r\nespecially to prevent the fraudulent imitation of butter by using\r\nan extract of beef.  The tax on spirits, tobacco and beer ought to\r\nbe retained as the best objects of taxation either of domestic or\r\nimported goods.  Neither of these is an article of necessity, but\r\nall are used purely to gratify an appetite, in many cases indulged\r\nto excess.\r\n\r\nAll civilized nations have come to regard these articles as the\r\nbest subjects of taxation.  To the extent that whisky is used as\r\na beverage it is hurtful in its influence upon the individual and\r\nupon society at large.  It is the cause of innumerable crimes, of\r\npoverty and distress in the family and home.  Still, it is an\r\nappetite that will be gratified, however severe may be the laws\r\nagainst its use, and while this habit exists the tax upon whisky,\r\nby limiting the quantity consumed, is beneficial to society at\r\nlarge.  It is true that alcohol, the base of whisky, is useful in\r\nthe arts and in the preparation of medicines and vinegar.  If some\r\nfeasible plan could be prescribed by which alcohol or spirits thus\r\nused could be freed from tax, it would be right to exempt it, but\r\nno such plan has been found that includes security against frauds\r\nbeing practiced to evade the tax on whisky.  The tax on tobacco\r\nand cigars is a moderate one, but the consumption of them is far\r\nless dangerous than that of spirits in their influence upon society.\r\nThe tax on the cheaper form of tobacco and cigars is comparatively\r\nsmall and does not add materially to the cost of tobacco in any of\r\nits forms.  No complaint is made of it.  Its consumption is so\r\ngeneral that the tax is fairly distributed and falls mainly on the\r\nricher classes, as the tax is increased in proportion to the value\r\nof the tobacco.  Beer, a beverage of almost universal use, yields\r\nthe large sum of $30,000,000 a year, at the rate of one dollar a\r\nbarrel.  This does not cause a perceptible increase of the cost to\r\nthe consumer, but rather tends to maintain the good quality of beer\r\nby the surveillance of the officers of internal revenue.  No general\r\ncomplaint has been made of this tax.  All internal taxes are\r\ncollected at less cost than any other form of taxation devised,\r\nand should be maintained as long as the expenses growing out of\r\nthe war shall remain unpaid.\r\n\r\nThe patience and even cheerfulness with which the people of the\r\nUnited States submitted to this severe taxation on their domestic\r\nproductions, was a matter of surprise, not only among our own\r\npeople, but in European countries.  In 1867, accompanied by Mr.\r\nAdams, our minister to England, I had the pleasure of breakfasting\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone at his official residence, and he referred to\r\nthe ease with which we collected, without complaint, taxes so\r\nburdensome as ours then were.  He asked me if it was true that we\r\nhad collected $1,600,000 annually from a tax on matches.  I told\r\nhim that we not only did so but that I had never heard a word of\r\ncomplaint, and the quality of matches was vastly improved while\r\ntheir price was actually reduced.  He threw up his hands and said\r\nthat the people of England would not submit to such tax and if any\r\nministry would propose it, it would soon be out of power.  Strange\r\nto say an administration of which Mr. Gladstone was at the head\r\ndid subsequently propose such a tax, but it was so severely arraigned\r\nthat it was at once abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe income tax, varied somewhat in terms from year to year, continued\r\nin force until 1870, when it was proposed to repeal it as no longer\r\nnecessary.  By the terms of the then existing law it expired in\r\n1872.  I urged as strongly as I could its retention at least until\r\nthe time expired, but it was repealed.  I then believed, and now\r\nbelieve, that a moderate income tax, levied on all incomes above\r\nthe sum of $1,000, or above a sum that will supply the ordinary\r\nwants of an average family in the United States with the necessaries\r\nof life, should be levied, according to the exigencies of the public\r\nservice.  In the present condition of affairs, I doubt the expediency\r\nof such a tax, especially in view of the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States recently rendered.\r\n\r\nThe distinction made by that court between incomes from the rent\r\nof land and other incomes seems narrow and technical.  A tax upon\r\nthe value of land is a direct tax, and must be apportioned among\r\nthe states according to population, but it does not follow that a\r\ntax on incomes from land is a direct tax.  An income means that\r\ngain which results from business, or property, of any kind, from\r\nthe proceeds of a farm, the profits derived from trade and commerce,\r\nand from any occupation or investment.  In common language the word\r\nincome applies to money received from any source.  It may be\r\nqualified as gross income and net income.  It may be limited by\r\nwords defining the source of the income, as, from land, merchandise\r\nor banking, but, in its general sense, it means gross savings from\r\nall sources.  When received in money it is an income and not until\r\nthen.  An income tax was paid, and cheerfully paid, by American\r\ncitizens during and since the war, in vast sums, and it did not\r\noccur to citizen, lawyer or judge that the constitution of the\r\nUnited States made a distinction between incomes from rents and\r\nincome from notes or bonds.  The states tax both land and bonds.\r\nWhy may not the United States tax income from each alike?  Many of\r\nthe largest incomes in the United States are derived from rents.\r\nTo except them by technical reasoning from a general tax on incomes\r\nwill tend to disparage the Supreme Court among \"plain people.\"  If\r\nincomes from rents must be excepted, then no income tax ought to\r\nbe assessed.  This decision, if adhered to, may cripple the government\r\nin times of emergency.  If made when the income tax was first\r\nimposed, it would have reduced the national revenue $347,000,000,\r\nfor no income tax would have been enacted if rents were excluded\r\nfrom taxable incomes.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to narrate the numerous internal revenue laws,\r\nwhich have been enacted and modified at every session of Congress\r\nsince 1861, or the innumerable objects of taxation embraced in\r\nthem, for such a narrative would fill too much space.  The discussion\r\nof these laws occupied a large portion of the time of Congress.\r\nThe articles or productions subject to taxation included for a time\r\nnearly everything for the use of man.  I trust the time is far\r\ndistant when such sweeping internal taxation will be required again,\r\nbut if it should come, the Congress of that day can find in our\r\nexperience resources more bountiful than Aladdin's lamp.\r\n\r\nDirect taxes, to be apportioned among the states, are not likely\r\nto be again assessed after the experience we had as to the last\r\ndirect tax.  Besides the difficulty of collecting it, there is the\r\npalpable objection that it is an unequal, and therefore an unjust,\r\ntax.  New states, and especially agricultural states, have not the\r\nsame ability to pay direct taxes as older commercial and manufacturing\r\nstates, having within them great cities with accumulated wealth,\r\nin the form of stocks, bonds and patents.\r\n\r\nThe office of commissioner of internal revenue has fortunately been\r\nfilled, as a rule, by gentlemen of standing and character of a high\r\norder of intelligence, and their work has been of great service to\r\nthe United States.  This important bureau ought to be, and no doubt\r\nwill be, retained as a part of the organized machinery of the\r\ngovernment, and the taxes collected by it will be necessary as long\r\nas our public debt remains, and until the list of pensioners will\r\nbe obliterated by the hand of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nLINCOLN'S EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.\r\nSlavery in the District of Columbia Abolished--Law Goes Into Effect\r\non April 10, 1862--Beginning of the End of Slavery--Military Measures\r\nin Congress to Carry on the War--Response to the President's Call\r\n--Beneficial Effects of the Confiscation Act--Visits to Soldiers'\r\nCamps--Robert S.

I had from the beginning\r\ndeclared my opposition to any interference with slavery in the\r\nDistrict, but the changed condition of the country demanded a change\r\nof public policy in this respect.  Slavery was made the pretext\r\nfor, and, I believe, was, the real cause of the war.  It had a\r\nfoothold in the District of Columbia, but it existed there in its\r\nmildest form.  By the census of 1860 there were, in the District\r\nof Columbia, 11,107 free negroes, 3,181 slaves, and 60,785 white\r\npeople.  It was considered the paradise of free negroes, where they\r\nwere almost exclusively employed as laborers in household service.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out a considerable number of slaves ran away\r\nfrom disloyal masters in Virginia and Maryland, seeking safety\r\nwithin our lines and finding employment in the District of Columbia.\r\nAs the war approached, most of the slaves in the District were\r\ncarried away by their owners into Virginia, and other southern\r\nstates, so that in 1862 it was estimated there were not more than\r\n1,500, and probably not 1,000, slaves in the District, while the\r\nnumber of free negroes increased to 15,000.  As a matter of course,\r\nwhen Virginia seceded no attempt was made to recapture runaway\r\nslaves from that state, and they became practically free.  It was\r\nknown that there was at that time a strong disposition in Maryland\r\nto try the experiment of emancipation, and it was believed that\r\nafter the war was over Virginia would adopt the same policy.  Little\r\ndoubt was felt as to the power of Congress to abolish slavery in\r\nthe District, should such a course be deemed expedient.  By the\r\nconstitution Congress was invested with express \"power to exercise\r\nexclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district\r\nas may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of\r\nCongress, become the seat of government of the United States.\"\r\nThis power had been recognized by the most eminent statesmen of\r\nour country, and also by the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nUntil Mr. Calhoun doubted or denied the power it was not questioned\r\nby any considerable number.  The real question was whether that\r\nwas the time for emancipation.  I endeavored to give to the subject\r\ncareful consideration, and came to the conclusion that it was\r\nexpedient then to emancipate the very few slaves in the District,\r\nfewer than there had been at any time within forty years, and fewer\r\nthan would likely be in case the war should end.  I believed also\r\nthat the social influence of Washington, and the wealth and property\r\ncontrolled and owned in a great measure by slaveholding residents\r\nthere, had been always against the government of the United States\r\nand in favor of the Rebellion.  While slavery existed it was a\r\nconstant source of annoyance and irritation.  The great mass of\r\nour constituents were opposed to slavery, morally, socially and\r\npolitically.  They felt it was wrong and would not change their\r\nopinion.  As long as slavery existed in the District, where Congress\r\nhad the power to abolish it, agitation and excitement would be\r\nceaseless.  The great body of the people of the northern states\r\nwere opposed to the institution theoretically, as were very many\r\nof the most intelligent people of the southern states.  I felt that\r\nnow was the time when this moral conviction should be heard and\r\nheeded by the national legislature.  I felt that we were bound to\r\nconsult the material interest of the people of the District, and\r\nthat emancipation would add to the value of their property and also\r\nadd to the population of the city.  The abolition of slavery would\r\nbring to the city intelligent mechanics and laboring men who would\r\nnever compete with the labor of slaves, and who, finding none there\r\nbut freemen, would develop the great advantages of the city.  In\r\na speech I made upon the subject I enlarged upon this consideration\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason why Washington, with a free population and as a\r\nfree city, situated here at the head of the Potomac, with remarkable\r\nfacilities of navigation, with great conveniences of communication,\r\nreaching to the west by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the\r\npolitical capital of the country, might not be a great free city,\r\nillustrating by its progress the operation of free institutions.\r\nBut it can only be done by the active, interested labor of free\r\npeople.  Simply as a municipal regulation it would be wise to\r\nabolish slavery in this district, because slavery is opposed to\r\nthe moral convictions of the great mass of the people of this\r\ncountry, and the existence of slavery here keeps out of this District\r\nan active, loyal, true, manly, generous body of laborers, who will\r\nnever compete in their labor with the labor of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another reason why the experiment of emancipation could\r\nbe best tried in the District of Columbia.  Emancipation was\r\nevidently the ultimate end of this question.  We had the power to\r\ntry the experiment.  It would be an example likely to be followed\r\nat the close of the war by many of the border states.  I therefore\r\nmade up my mind in favor of the measure, made a long speech for\r\nthe bill and voted for it.  It became a law on April 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nAt that early day, I believed that it was the duty of Congress to\r\nconfiscate the slaves in the seceding states as the natural result\r\nof the war.  These states had placed themselves in a position by\r\nrebellion where they had no constitutional rights which we were\r\nbound to observe.  The war being open and flagrant to break up the\r\nUnion, they were not entitled to the benefit of any stipulation\r\nmade in their favor as states in the Union.  I also favored the\r\ngranting of aid to any policy of emancipation that might be adopted\r\nin the border states of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, but Congress\r\nwas indisposed to extend the provisions of the then pending measure\r\nbeyond the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, on September 22, 1862, issued\r\nhis proclamation containing the following declaration:\r\n\r\n\"That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one\r\nthousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves\r\nwithin any state of designated part of a state, the people whereof\r\nshall be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then,\r\nthenceforward, and forever, free; and the executive government of\r\nthe United States, including the military and naval authority\r\nthereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons,\r\nand will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them,\r\nin any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThis was carried out in a subsequent proclamation of January 1,\r\n1863, in which the President declared:\r\n\r\n\"And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do\r\norder and declare that all persons held as slaves, within said\r\ndesignated states and parts of states, are, and henceforward shall\r\nbe, free; and that the executive government of the United States,\r\nincluding the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize\r\nand maintain the freedom of said persons.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the end of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn following the important financial measures of the 37th Congress,\r\nI have purposely passed by, in their order of time, other measures\r\nof vital interest that were acted upon in that Congress.  The\r\nmilitary measures adopted were on the same grand scale as the\r\nfinancial measures I have referred to.  In 1861 the United States\r\ncontained a population of 32,000,000 people, of whom about 10,000,000\r\nwere in the seceding states, some of whom were opposed to secession,\r\nbut a greater number living in states that did not secede were in\r\nhearty sympathy with the rebellion.  No preparation for war had\r\nbeen made in any of the loyal states, while in the disloyal states\r\npreparations had been made by the distribution of arms through the\r\ntreachery of Secretary Floyd.  When the seceding states organized\r\na confederate government, the executive branch of the general\r\ngovernment was under the management and control of those who favored\r\nthe rebellion, or were so feeble or indifferent that they offered\r\nno resistance whatever to such organization.  The President of the\r\nUnited States declared, in an executive message, that the general\r\ngovernment had no power to coerce a state.  On the accession of\r\nPresident Lincoln, the confederate government was better organized\r\nfor resistance than the Union was for coercion.  When war actually\r\ncommenced, the capital at Washington was practically blockaded,\r\nand in the power of the Confederates.\r\n\r\nThe response of the loyal states to the call of Lincoln was perhaps\r\nthe most remarkable uprising of a great people in the history of\r\nmankind.  Within a few days the road to Washington was opened, but\r\nthe men who answered the call were not soldiers, but citizens,\r\nbadly armed, and without drill or discipline.  The history of their\r\nrapid conversion into real soldiers, and of the measures adopted\r\nby Congress to organize, arm and equip them, does not fall within\r\nmy province.  The battles fought, the victories won, and the defeats\r\nsuffered, have been recorded in the hundred or more volumes of \"The\r\nRecords of the Rebellion,\" published by the United States.  The\r\nprincipal events of the war have been told in the history of Abraham\r\nLincoln by Nicolay and Hay, and perhaps more graphically by General\r\nGrant, General Sherman, General Sheridan, Alexander H. Stephens,\r\nFitz Hugh Lee, and many others who actively participated in the\r\nwar, and told what they saw and knew of it.\r\n\r\nThe military committees of the two Houses, under the advice of\r\naccomplished officers, formulated the laws passed by Congress for\r\nthe enlistment, equipment and organization of the Union armies.\r\nHenry Wilson, of Massachusetts, was chairman of the committee on\r\nmilitary affairs of the Senate, and he is entitled to much of the\r\npraise due for the numerous laws required to fit the Union citizen\r\nsoldiers for military duty.  His position was a difficult one, but\r\nhe filled it with hearty sympathy for the Union soldiers, and with\r\na just regard for both officers and men.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous bills relating to the war, that which became\r\nthe act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion,\r\nand to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, excited the\r\ngreatest interest, giving rise to a long debate.  It was founded\r\non the faulty idea that a territorial war, existing between two\r\ndistinct parts of the country, could be treated as an insurrection.\r\nThe law of nations treats such a war as a contest between two\r\nseparate powers, to be governed by the laws of war.  Confiscation\r\nin such a war is not a measure to be applied to individuals in a\r\nrevolting section, but if the revolt is subdued, the property of\r\nrevolting citizens is subject to the will of the conqueror and to\r\nthe law of conquest.  The apparent object of the law referred to\r\nwas to cripple the power of the Confederate States, by emancipating\r\nslaves held in them, whenever such states fell within the power of\r\nthe federal army.  This object was accomplished in a better and\r\nmore comprehensive way by the proclamation of the President.  The\r\nconfiscation act had but little influence upon the result of the\r\nwar, except that it gathered at the wake of our armies in the south\r\na multitude of negroes called \"contrabands,\" who willingly performed\r\nmanual labor, but were often an incumbrance and had to be fed and\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of these \"contrabands\" was the result of the war, and\r\nnot of the confiscation act.  In the later period of the war, they,\r\nin common with the free negroes from the north, were organized into\r\nregiments commanded by white men, and rendered valuable service to\r\nthe Union cause.\r\n\r\nWhen the confiscation bill was pending, on the 23rd of April, 1862,\r\nI made a speech in support of an amendment offered by me and in\r\nsubstance adopted.  A few extracts of my speech will show my opinions\r\non this subject:\r\n\r\n\"Confiscation is not only justified by the laws of war, by the\r\npractice of many nations, but it is practiced by our enemies in\r\nthe most obnoxious way.  They seize all kinds of property of loyal\r\ncitizens; they destroy contracts; confiscate debts.  All the property\r\nof citizens of loyal states which is within a disloyal state is\r\nseized without exception, and that whether such citizen has aided\r\nthe government or not.  They also seize the property of all citizens\r\nin disloyal states who will not commit an act of treason by aiding\r\nthem.  Yet they profess to be governed by a constitution similar\r\nto the constitution of the United States, so far as it relates to\r\nthe rights of person and property.  They draw the distinction\r\nbetween the laws of war and the laws of peace. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is time there was an end of this.  We are at war.  We must\r\ndestroy our enemies or they will destroy us.  We must subdue their\r\narmies and we must confiscate their property.  The only question\r\nwith me is as to the best measure of confiscation.  That some one\r\nshould be enacted, and that speedily, is not only my conviction of\r\nduty, but it will be demanded by those who will have to bear the\r\nburdens of the war.  Now, it is the interest of every citizen in\r\na seceding state to be a rebel.  If a patriot, his property is\r\ndestroyed.  If a rebel, his property is protected alike by friend\r\nand foe.  Now, the burdens of war will fall, by heavy taxation,\r\nupon loyal citizens, but rebels are beyond our reach.  How long\r\ncan we conduct such a war?  Sir, we have been moderate to excess.\r\nWar is a horrible remedy, but when we are compelled to resort to\r\nit, we should make our enemies feel its severity as well as\r\nourselves. . . .\r\n\r\n\"If too much is attempted in the way of confiscation, nothing will\r\nbe accomplished.  If nothing is confiscated, you array against you\r\nall who wish in a civil war merely to preserve their property and\r\nto remain quiet.  This is always a large class in every community.\r\nIf rebellion will secure their property from rebels and not endanger\r\nit to the government, they are rebels.  Those whose position or\r\ncharacter have secured them offices among the rebels can only be\r\nconquered by force.  Is it not, therefore, possible to frame a bill\r\nwhich will punish the prominent actors in the rebellion, proclaim\r\namnesty to the great mass of citizens in the seceding states, and\r\nseparate them from their leader?  This, in my judgment, can be done\r\nby confining confiscation to classes of persons.  The amendment I\r\npropose embraces five classes of persons.\"\r\n\r\nThe confiscation act was more useful as a declaration of policy\r\nthan as an act to be enforced.  It was denounced by the Confederates\r\nand by timid men in the north, but the beneficial results it aimed\r\nat were accomplished, not by law, but by the proclamation of the\r\nPresident and by the armed forces of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe several acts providing for enrolling and calling out the national\r\nforces gave rise to much debate, partly upon sectional lines.  The\r\npolicy of drafting from the militia of the several states, the\r\nemployment of substitutes and the payment of bounties, were contested\r\nand defended.  I insisted that if a special fund for hiring\r\nsubstitutes was raised, it ought to be by a tax upon all wealthy\r\ncitizens, and not confined to the man who was drafted.  These and\r\nnumerous questions of a similar character occupied much time, and\r\ncreated much feeling.  It is now hardly worth while, in view of\r\nthe results of the war, to revive old controversies.  It is sufficient\r\nto say that all the laws passed to organize the national forces\r\nand call out the militia of the several states in case of emergency\r\ncontributed to the success of the Union armies.  I do not recall\r\nany example in history where a peaceful nation, ignorant of military\r\ndiscipline, becoming divided into hostile sections, developed such\r\nmilitary power, courage and endurance as did the United States and\r\nConfederate States in our Civil War.  Vast armies were raised by\r\nvoluntary enlistments, great battles were fought with fearful losses\r\non both sides, and neither yielded until the Confederates had\r\nexhausted all their resources and surrendered to the Union armies\r\nwithout conditions, except such as were dictated by General Grant\r\n--to go home and be at peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire war Washington was a military camp.  Almost every\r\nregiment from the north on the way to the army in Virginia stopped\r\nfor a time in Washington.  This was especially the case in 1861.\r\nIt was usual for every new regiment to march along Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue to the White House.  Among the early arrivals in the spring\r\nof 1861 was a regiment from New Hampshire, much better equipped\r\nthan our western regiments.  My colleague, Ben Wade, and I went to\r\nthe White House to see this noted regiment pass in review before\r\nMr. Lincoln.  As the head of the line turned around the north wing\r\nof the treasury department and came in sight, the eyes of Wade fell\r\nupon a tall soldier, wearing a gaudy uniform, a very high hat, and\r\na still higher cockade.  He carried a baton, which he swung right\r\nand left, up and down, with all the authority of a field marshal.\r\nWade, much excited, asked me, pointing to the soldier:  \"Who is\r\nthat?\"  I told him I thought that was the drum major.  \"Well,\" he\r\nsaid, \"if the people could see him they would make him a general.\"\r\nSo little was then known of military array by the wisest among our\r\nSenators.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a habit of Senators and Members, during the war, to\r\ncall at the camps of soldiers from their respective states.\r\nSecretary Chase often did this and several times I accompanied him.\r\nThe \"boys,\" as they preferred to be called, would gather around\r\ntheir visitors, and very soon some one would cry out \"a speech, a\r\nspeech,\" and an address would usually be made.  I heard very good\r\nspeeches made in this way, and, in some cases, replied to by a\r\nprivate soldier in a manner fully as effective as that of the\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nIn the early period of the war the private soldier did not forget\r\nthat he was as good as any man.  One evening Major, afterwards\r\nMajor-General, Robert S. Granger and I were strolling through \"Camp\r\nBuckingham,\" near Mansfield, Ohio, and came to a young soldier\r\nboiling beans.  He was about to take them off the fire when Granger\r\nsaid:  \"My good fellow, don't take off those beans; they are not\r\ndone.\"  The young soldier squared himself and with some insolence\r\nsaid:  \"Do you think I don't know how to boil beans?\"  Granger,\r\nwith great kindness of manner, said:  \"If you had eaten boiled\r\nbeans in the army as many years as I have you would know it is\r\nbetter to leave them in the pot all night with a slow fire.\"  The\r\nmanner of Granger was so kindly that the soldier thanked him and\r\nfollowed his advice.  General Granger died at Zanesville, Ohio,\r\nApril 25, 1894, after having been on the retired list for over\r\ntwenty-one years.  He was a gallant, as well as a skillful, officer.\r\nPeace to his memory.\r\n\r\nIt was my habit, while Congress was in session during the war, to\r\nride on horseback over a region within ten miles of Washington,\r\ngenerally accompanied by some army officer.  I became familiar with\r\nevery lane and road, and especially with camps and hospitals.  At\r\nthat time it could be truly said that Washington and its environs\r\nwas a great camp and hospital.  The roads were generally very muddy\r\nor exceedingly dusty.  The great army teams cut up and blocked the\r\nroads which were either of clay or sand, but the air was generally\r\nrefreshing and the scenery charming.  I do not know of any city\r\nthat has more beautiful environs, with the broad Potomac at the\r\nhead of tide water, the picturesque hills and valleys, the woodland\r\ninterspersed with deciduous and evergreen trees, the wide landscape,\r\nextending to the Blue Ridge on the west, the low lands and ridges\r\nof Maryland and the hills about Mt. Vernon.  The city of Washington,\r\nhowever, was then far from attractive.  It was an overgrown village,\r\nwith wide unpaved avenues and streets, with 61,000 inhabitants\r\nbadly housed, hotels and boarding houses badly kept, and all\r\ndepending more or less upon low salaries, and employment by the\r\ngovernment.  All this has been changed.  The streets and avenues\r\nhave been paved and extended.  The old site is now well filled with\r\ncomfortable mansions and business blocks, and a large portion of\r\nthe District outside the city is being occupied with villas and\r\nmarket gardens.  The mode of living has greatly changed.  Before\r\nand during the war, Senators and Members lived in boarding houses\r\nin messes, formed of families of similar tastes and opinions.\r\nSociety, if it may be so called, was chiefly official, of which\r\njustices of the Supreme Court and cabinet officers were the head,\r\nand Senators and Members of Congress were the most numerous guests.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Congress my pay as a Member was $8 a day during the\r\nseason, and it was said we had \"roast beef;\" but we paid for it if\r\nwe had it.  At the close of the 34th Congress the compensation was\r\nincreased to $3,000 a year.  During the latter part of the war and\r\nafterwards, prices of food, board and lodging were considerably\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 I offered the proprietor of Willard's Hotel my monthly pay\r\nof $250 for board and lodgings, in very modest quarters, for my\r\nwife and myself, but he demanded $300 a month.  This led me to\r\npurchase a house in which to live, a change which I have never\r\nregretted.  It was quite the fashion then for the old families,\r\nwho were in full sympathy with the Confederates, to underrate\r\nproperty (even their own) in Washington, on the ground that when\r\nthe Confederacy was acknowledged the capital would be removed, and\r\nreal estate could, therefore, be obtained upon very reasonable\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nAfter the war the feverish revival of business growing out of our\r\nexpanded currency led to such reckless extravagance in improvements\r\nby public officials in Washington that for a time it threatened\r\nthe bankruptcy of the city, but, as this leads me in advance of\r\nevents, I will recur hereafter to the Washington of to-day.\r\n\r\nDuring 1870 Congress passed a law increasing the compensation of\r\nSenators and Members from $3,000 to $5,000 a year, and justified\r\nthis increase by the inflated prices of everything measured by a\r\ndepreciated currency.  There would have been but little complaint\r\nof this by the people had not the law been made retroactive.  It\r\nwas made to take effect at the beginning of that Congress, though\r\nwhen the law was passed Congress was nearly ended.  This \"back\r\npay,\" amounting to over $3,000, was very unpopular, and led to the\r\ndefeat of many Members who voted for it.  At home they were called\r\n\"salary grabbers.\"  Several Senators and Members, I among the\r\nnumber, declined to receive the back pay.  But it was said that\r\nthe Congressmen could apply for it at any time in the future when\r\nthe excitement died away.  This led me to write Francis E. Spinner,\r\nTreasurer of the United States, to ascertain how I could cover into\r\nthe treasury my back pay.  His answer was characteristic, and is\r\nhere inserted.  Spinner, long since dead, was a peculiar character.\r\nHe was with me in the House of Representatives, was appointed\r\nTreasurer of the United States by President Lincoln, and continued\r\nas such until 1875.  He was a typical officer, bold, firm and\r\nhonest.  He was also a true friend, a model of fidelity and courage.\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury of the United States,}\r\n  \"Washington, July 3, 1873.     }\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 28th ultimo has been received.\r\n\r\n\"I sympathize with you most fully.  I too have had my share of lies\r\ntold on me, by Dana and his 'Sun,' and shall be disappointed if\r\nthe libels are not continued, especially if I do right.  Really\r\nyou have a white elephant on your hands.  You can neither take the\r\nback pay, nor leave it where it is, nor draw it and redeposit it,\r\nwithout subjecting yourself to the yelping of the damned curs, that\r\nbark at the heels of every honest man.\r\n\r\n\"If you will turn to the proviso in Section 5, of the General\r\nAppropriation Bill, approved July 12, 1870, at page 251, volume\r\n16, of the Statutes at Large, you will, I think, be satisfied that\r\nyour back pay would never lapse to the treasury.  Should you leave\r\nit, as it now is, I think it would at all times be subject to your\r\norder, and to the order of your heirs afterwards.  The department\r\nhas decided that the appropriations for the pay of Members of\r\nCongress is _permanent_.  The papers say that the Comptroller has\r\ndecided that the back pay would lapse in two years.  I called on\r\nhim to-day, and he furnished me with a copy of his opinion, which\r\nis herewith inclosed you, and wrote me a note, a copy of which is\r\nalso inclosed, in which he says--'it could not be carried back\r\nuntil after two years; whether it can be carried back is another\r\nquestion, which I do not intend to decide.'  There are two ways\r\nthat the amount can be carried back into the treasury:  First, by\r\ndrawing out the amount, and redepositing it; and second, by directing\r\nthe secretary of the senate, by written order, to turn the amount\r\ninto the treasury.  I, of course, can't advise you what to do.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n  \"F. E. Spinner, Tr., U. S.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Mansfield, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1863, the financial operations of the government\r\nwere eminently successful.  In the fall of 1862, Secretary Chase\r\nendeavored to sell the $500,000,000 5-20 six per cent. bonds,\r\nauthorized by the act of February 25, 1862, through experienced\r\nofficers in New York, and could not get par for them.  He then\r\nemployed Jay Cooke, of Philadelphia, to take charge of this loan,\r\nand within a year it was sold by him, to parties all over the\r\ncountry, at par.  The entire cost of placing the loan was less than\r\nthree-eighths of one per cent.  It furnished the greater part of\r\nthe means necessary to conduct the war during 1863.\r\n\r\nThe early victories of Grant and Forts Henry and Donelson had\r\nrescued Kentucky, and opened up the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers\r\nto the heart of the south.  The battle of Shiloh, though won at a\r\ngreat sacrifice, inspired the western army with confidence, and\r\ngave General Sherman his first opportunity to prove his ability as\r\na soldier.  The timid handling of that army by Halleck and its\r\nsubsequent dispersion by his orders, and the general operations of\r\nboth the armies in the west and in Virginia, created a feeling of\r\ndespondency in the loyal states which was manifested in the election\r\nin the fall of 1862.  The military operations in the early part of\r\n1863 did not tend to restore confidence.\r\n\r\nAt this period I received the following letter from Secretary\r\nStanton, which evidenced his appreciation of General Sherman:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., December 7, 1862.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--The general's letter is returned herewith, having been\r\nread with much interest and great admiration of his wisdom and\r\npatriotism.  If our armies were commanded by such generals we could\r\nnot fail to have a speedy restoration of the authority of the\r\ngovernment, and an end of the war.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to give him my warmest regards, and no effort of mine\r\nwill be spared to secure to the government the fullest exercise of\r\nhis abilities.  With thanks for the favor, I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"Edwin M. Stanton.\"\r\n\r\nThe attack by General Sherman upon the defenses of Vicksburg had\r\nbeen repulsed, but the effect of this had been counteracted by the\r\ncapture of Arkansas post with over 5,000 prisoners.  General Grant\r\nhad failed in his operations in Mississippi.  General Hooker had\r\nbeen defeated at Chancellorsville, and Lee was preparing to make\r\nan advance into Maryland and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1863, Clement L. Vallandigham, for several years a Member\r\nof Congress from Ohio, in a speech made at Mount Vernon, denounced\r\nthe government with great violence, and, especially, an order issued\r\nby General Ambrose E. Burnside, commanding the department of the\r\nOhio, announcing that \"all persons, found within our lines, who\r\ncommit acts for the benefit of the enemies of our country, will be\r\ntried as spies or traitors, and if convicted will suffer death.\"\r\nBurnside enumerated among the things which came within his order,\r\nthe writing or carrying of secret letters, passing the lines for\r\ntreasonable purposes, recruiting for the Confederate service.  He\r\nsaid:  \"The habit of declaring sympathy for the enemy will not be\r\nallowed in this department; persons committing such offenses will\r\nbe at once arrested, with a view to being tried or sent beyond our\r\nlines into the lines of their friends.\"\r\n\r\nVallandigham denounced this order as a base usurpation of arbitrary\r\npower; said that he despised it, and spat upon it, and trampled it\r\nunder his foot.  He denounced the President, and advised the people\r\nto come up together at the ballot box and hurl the tyrant from his\r\nthrone.  Many of his hearers wore the distinctive badges of\r\n\"copperheads\" and \"butternuts,\" and, amid cheers which Vallandigham's\r\nspeech elicited, was heard a shout that Jeff. Davis was a gentleman,\r\nwhich was more than Lincoln was.\r\n\r\nThis speech was reported to General Burnside.  Early on the 4th of\r\nMay a company of soldiers was sent to arrest Vallandigham, and the\r\narrest was made.  Arriving at Cincinnati, he was consigned to the\r\nmilitary prison and kept in close confinement.  This event caused\r\ngreat excitement, not only in Cincinnati, but throughout the State\r\nof Ohio.  On the evening of that day a great crowd assembled at\r\nDayton, and several hundred men moved, hooting and yelling, to the\r\noffice of the Republican newspaper, and sacked and then destroyed\r\nit by fire.  Vallandigham was tried by a military commission, which\r\npromptly sentenced him to be placed in close confinement in some\r\nfortress of the United States, to be designated by the commanding\r\nofficer of the department, there to be kept during the continuance\r\nof the war.  Such an order was made by General Burnside, but it\r\nwas subsequently modified by Mr. Lincoln, who commuted the sentence\r\nof Vallandigham, and directed that he be sent within the Confederate\r\nlines.  This was done within a fortnight after the court-martial.\r\nVallandigham was sent to Tennessee, and, on the 25th of May, was\r\nescorted by a small cavalry force to the Confederate lines near\r\nMurfreesboro, and delivered to an Alabama regiment.\r\n\r\nVallandigham made a formal protest that he was within the Confederate\r\nlines by force, and against his will, and that he surrendered as\r\na prisoner of war.  His arrest for words spoken, and not for acts\r\ndone, created great excitement throughout Ohio and the country.\r\nA public meeting was held in New York on May 16, which denounced\r\nthis action as illegal--as a step towards revolution.  The Democratic\r\nleaders of Ohio assumed the same attitude, and made a vigorous\r\nprotest to the President.  It is not necessary to state this incident\r\nmore fully.  Nicolay and Hay, in their history of Lincoln, narrate\r\nfully the incidents connected with this arrest, and the disposition\r\nof Vallandigham.  The letters of the President in reply to Governor\r\nSeymour, and to the meeting in Ohio, are among the most interesting\r\nproductions of Mr. Lincoln.  He doubted the legality of the arrest.\r\nHe quoted the provision of the constitution that the privilege of\r\nthe writ of habeas corpus \"should not be suspended unless, in cases\r\nof invasion or rebellion, the public safety may require it.\"  He\r\nhad suspended the privileges of that writ upon the happening of\r\ncontingencies stated in the constitution and, therefore, the\r\ncommanding officer was justified in making the arrest, and he did\r\nnot deem it proper to interfere with the order of the commanding\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nThis incident was made more important when, on the 11th of June,\r\nthe Democratic convention of the State of Ohio met at Columbus and\r\nthere formally nominated Vallandigham as the candidate of that\r\nparty for Governor of Ohio.  This presented directly to the people\r\nof that state the question of the legality and propriety of the\r\narrest of Vallandigham.  The Republican party subsequently met and\r\nnominated for governor John Brough, a lifelong Democrat, but in\r\nthrough sympathy with the Union cause.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, now, to describe the intense excitement in Ohio\r\nover the issue thus made--at times breaking into violence.\r\nVallandigham was received with great favor in the different cities\r\nof the south, and finally, embarking on board of a vessel which\r\nran the blockade at Wilmington, he arrived at Bermuda on the 22nd\r\nof June, from which place he took passage to Canada, arriving at\r\nNiagara Falls about the middle of July.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of anger and excitement among the loyal people of Ohio\r\nincreased, so that it was manifest that if Vallandigham entered\r\nthe state he would be in great danger, and a quasi civil war might\r\nhave arisen.  I heard men of character and influence say distinctly\r\nthat if Vallandigham came into the state he would be killed, and\r\nthey, if necessary, would kill him.  It was then understood that\r\nMr. Lincoln was disposed to allow him to enter the state.  Senator\r\nWade and I met at Washington and had a conversation with Mr. Lincoln.\r\nWe told him the condition of feeling in Ohio, and of our confident\r\nbelief that if his order of banishment was revoked, it would result\r\nin riots and violence, in which Vallandigham would be the first\r\nvictim.  He gave us no positive assurance, but turned the conversation\r\nby saying that he thought Vallandigham was safer under British\r\ndominion, where he would have plenty of friends.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1863, my health was somewhat impaired, and Mrs. Sherman\r\nand I concluded to visit New England for a change of scene, and\r\nfor the benefit of the ocean air.  We visited Newport in advance\r\nof the season and found it deserted.  We went to Boston, and there\r\nheard of the advance of Lee in Pennsylvania, and the fierce contest\r\ngoing on in the rear of Vicksburg.  I became uneasy and started\r\nfor home with the intention of proceeding to Vicksburg, but at\r\nCleveland we heard the glad tidings of great joy, the fall of\r\nVicksburg and the defeat of Lee at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nThese victories, occurring on the same day, aroused the enthusiasm\r\nand confidence of the loyal people of the United States, especially\r\nthe people of Ohio.  Instead of a trip to Vicksburg I was soon\r\nenlisted in the political canvass, and this for three months occupied\r\nmy attention.  Meetings were held in every county and in almost\r\nevery township of the state.  All on either side who were accustomed\r\nto speak were actively engaged.  My opening speech was made at\r\nDelaware on the 29th of July.  I was intensely interested in the\r\ncanvass, and therefore insert a few paragraphs from that speech,\r\nas an indication of the state of feeling existing at that time:\r\n\r\n\"The political campaign in Ohio this season presents some singular\r\nfeatures.  We are in the midst of a great civil war, in which it\r\nis safe to say that one million of men are now arrayed in arms\r\nagainst each other.  There are, perhaps, now, from Ohio, one hundred\r\nthousand of her best and bravest citizens in the field, in hospitals\r\nor camps, sharing the burdens of war.  The immediate stake involved\r\nis nothing less than national existence; while the ultimate stake\r\ninvolves nothing less than civil liberty for generations yet to\r\ncome.  In the midst of this contest the Democratic party, through\r\nits most eloquent orators, endeavor to make a personal issue.  They\r\npropose to withdraw our armies, to abandon the war, and to try the\r\nquestion whether their candidate for governor has been legally\r\nconvicted as a traitor to his country.\r\n\r\n\"We are assured by Mr. Pugh, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant\r\ngovernor, who is one of the most eloquent and able young men in\r\nthe state, that here in Ohio we have been subjected to a tyranny\r\nas intolerable as that of King Bomba of Naples.  When we ask for\r\nevidence of this tyranny, we are told that Clement L. Vallandigham\r\nhas been illegally convicted and illegally banished; and that if\r\nwe are fit to be free we must stop and examine the record in his\r\ncase, and not be turned from it by clamors about prosecuting the\r\nwar, or of concluding peace.  And we are told that if we don't do\r\nall this we are helpless slaves and deserve no better fate.  Now,\r\nas I do not desire to be a slave, and do not wish the people of my\r\nnative state to be slaves, I will so far depart from my usual course\r\nin political discussion as to examine the personal issue thus made.\r\n\r\n\"I had supposed, fellow-citizens, that nowhere in the wide world\r\ndid people live as free from oppression as in the State of Ohio.\r\nBut the Democratic party has sounded the alarm that our liberties\r\nwere jeopardized in that Mr. Vallandigham has been, as they assert,\r\nillegally convicted and banished.  Before alluding to matters of\r\nmore general interest I propose to consider that question.\r\n\r\n\"The candidate of the Democratic party was convicted by a military\r\ntribunal for aiding the enemy with whom we are at war.  For this\r\nhe was expelled beyond our lines, and was within the lines of the\r\nenemy when nominated for governor of Ohio.  By the judgment of a\r\nmilitary tribunal, composed mainly of his political friends, approved\r\nby General Burnside, the chief military officer within the state,\r\nsanctioned by Judge Leavitt--a judge selected by Vallandigham\r\nhimself--of the United States court, he was convicted and sentenced\r\nto imprisonment during the war.  By the mercy of the President he\r\nwas released from imprisonment and sent beyond our lines.  While\r\nthus banished as a convicted traitor, by military authority, the\r\nDemocratic party of the State of Ohio nominated this man as a\r\ncandidate for governor, and you are called upon to ratify and\r\nconfirm that nomination, to intrust this man, convicted as a traitor,\r\nwith the chief command of our militia, the appointment of all its\r\nofficers, and the management of the executive authority of the\r\nstate; and that, too, in the midst of a war with the rebels he was\r\nconvicted of aiding. . . .\r\n\r\n\"And here is the marked distinction between the two parties.  The\r\nUnion party strikes only at the rebels.  The Democratic party\r\nstrikes only at the administration.  The Union party insists upon\r\nthe use of every means to put down the rebels.  The Democratic\r\nparty uses every means to put down the administration.  I read what\r\nis called the Democratic Platform, and I find nothing against the\r\nrebels who are in arms against the best government in the world;\r\nbut I find numerous accusations against the authorities of the\r\ngovernment, who are struggling to put down the rebels.  I find no\r\nkindly mention of the progress of our arms, no mention of victories\r\nachieved and difficulties overcome; no mention of financial measures\r\nwithout a parallel in their success; no promise of support, no word\r\nof encouragement to the constituted authorities; no allowance made\r\nfor human error; not a single patriotic hope.  It is a long string\r\nof whining, scolding accusations.  It is dictated by the spirit of\r\nrebellion, and, before God, I believe it originated in the same\r\nmalignant hate of the constituted authorities as has armed the\r\npublic enemies.  I appeal to you if that is the proper way to\r\nsupport your government in the time of war.  Is this the example\r\nset by Webster and Clay, and the great leaders of the Whig party\r\nwhen General Jackson throttled nullification; or is it the example\r\nof the tories of the Revolution?\"\r\n\r\nBrough visited, I think, every county in the state.  Everywhere\r\nhis meetings were large and enthusiastic, but it must be said also\r\nthat the Democratic meetings, which were equally numerous, were\r\nvery largely attended.  The people were evidently anxious to hear\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the campaign I accompanied Mr. Brough through\r\nthe populous central counties of the state.  We spoke, among other\r\nplaces, in Newark, Zanesville and Lancaster.  The meetings were\r\nnot merely mass meetings, but they were so large that no human\r\nvoice could reach all those present, and speeches were made from\r\nseveral stands in the open air, each surrounded by as many as could\r\nhear.  This indication of public feeling was somewhat weakened by\r\nthe fact that the Democratic meetings were also very large, and\r\nthe ablest members of that party were actively engaged in the\r\ncanvass.  The \"martyr\" in Canada was the hero of these meetings,\r\nand his compulsory arrest and absence from the state, but near its\r\nborder, was the constant theme of complaint.  It was observed that\r\nthe rival meetings were attended by men of both parties in nearly\r\nequal numbers, so that it was difficult to form an opinion of the\r\nresult.  Mr. Brough kept a memorandum book containing the names of\r\nthe counties in the state and the estimated majorities for or\r\nagainst him in each county.  At night, when the crowds dispersed,\r\nhe would take out his book, and, upon the information received that\r\nday, would change the estimate of his majorities.  In view of the\r\nenormous attendance at, and interest in, the Democratic meetings,\r\nhe was constantly lowering his estimated majority on the home vote,\r\nuntil finally it declined to 5,000, with the army vote known to be\r\nvery largely in his favor.  At Lancaster, where he had lived and\r\npublished a strong Democratic paper for many years, and where I\r\nwas born, he carefully analyzed his list, and, throwing his book\r\nupon the table, emphatically said that he would not reduce his\r\nmajority of the home vote one vote below 5,000.  The Democratic\r\nparty, however, seemed confident of Vallandigham's election.  The\r\nresult was that Brough was elected by the unprecedented majority\r\nof 101,000, of which 62,000 was on the home vote and 39,000 on the\r\nvote of the soldiers in the field, they having the privilege of\r\nvoting.\r\n\r\nThis settled once for all the position of Ohio, not only on the\r\nquestion of the war, but on the determination of its people to\r\nsupport Mr. Lincoln in the use of all the powers granted by the\r\nconstitution as construed by him, and to prosecute the war to final\r\nsuccess.  Vallandigham remained in Canada until June, 1864, when\r\nhe returned quietly to Ohio, where he was permitted to remain.\r\nHis presence injured his party.  His appearance in the national\r\nconvention at Chicago in 1864, and active participation in its\r\nproceedings, and his support of General McClellan, greatly, I think,\r\ndiminished the chances of the Democratic ticket.  He died seven\r\nyears later by an accidental wound inflicted by himself.\r\n\r\nI have always regarded Brough's election in Ohio upon the issue\r\ndistinctly made, not only as to the prosecution of the war, but in\r\nsupport of the most vigorous measures to conduct it, as having an\r\nimportant influence in favor of the Union cause equal to that of\r\nany battle of the war.  The results of all the elections in the\r\nseveral states in 1863 were decidedly victories for the Union cause,\r\nand especially in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nA MEMORABLE SESSION OF CONGRESS.\r\nDark Period of the War--Effect of the President's Proclamation--\r\nRevenue Bill Enacted Increasing Internal Taxes and Adding Many New\r\nObjects of Taxation--Additional Bonds Issued--General Prosperity\r\nin the North Following the Passage of New Financial Measures--Aid\r\nfor the Union Pacific Railroad Company--Land Grants to the Northern\r\nPacific--13th Amendment to the Constitution--Resignation of Secretary\r\nChase--Anecdote of Governor Tod of Ohio--Nomination of William P.\r\nFessenden to Succeed Chase--The Latter Made Chief Justice--Lincoln's\r\nSecond Nomination--Effect of Vallandigham's Resolution--General\r\nSherman's March to the Sea--Second Session of the 38th Congress.\r\n\r\nThe 38th Congress met on the 7th of December, 1863.  The Members\r\nof the House of Representatives were elected in the fall of 1862,\r\nperhaps the darkest period of the war for the Union cause.  The\r\nutter failure of McClellan's campaign in Virginia, the defeat of\r\nPope at the second battle of Bull Run, the jealousies then developed\r\namong the chief officers of the Union army, the restoration of\r\nMcClellan to his command, the golden opportunity lost by him at\r\nAntietam, the second removal of McClellan from command, the slow\r\nmovement of Halleck on Corinth, the escape of Beauregard, the\r\nscattering of Halleck's magnificent army, the practical exclusion\r\nof Grant and his command, and the chasing of Bragg and Buell through\r\nKentucky--these, and other discouraging events, created a doubt in\r\nthe public mind whether the Union could be restored.  It became\r\nknown during the happening of these events that Mr. Lincoln had\r\ndetermined upon the emancipation of slaves in states in rebellion\r\nby an executive act.  He said to the artist, F. B. Carpenter:\r\n\r\n\"It had got to be midsummer, 1862; things had gone on from bad to\r\nworse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the\r\nplan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played\r\nour last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game.  I\r\nnow determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and\r\nwithout consultation with, or the knowledge of, the cabinet, I\r\nprepared the original draft of the proclamation.\"\r\n\r\nOf the cabinet, Blair deprecated this policy on the ground that it\r\nwould cost the administration in the fall elections.  Chase doubted\r\nthe success of the measure and suggested another plan of emancipation,\r\nbut said that he regarded this as so much better than inaction on\r\nthe subject that he would give it his entire support.  Seward\r\nquestioned the expediency of the issue of the proclamation at that\r\njuncture.  The depression of the public mind consequent upon repeated\r\nreverses was so great that he feared the effect of so important a\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the opposition, the proclamation was postponed.\r\nOn the 22nd of September, the President, having fully made up his\r\nmind, announced to the cabinet his purpose to issue the proclamation\r\nalready quoted.  What he did, he said, was after full deliberation\r\nand under a heavy and solemn sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this proclamation upon the pending elections in Ohio\r\nwas very injurious.  I was then actively engaged in the canvass\r\nand noticed that when I expressed my approbation of the proclamation,\r\nit was met with coldness and silence.  This was especially so at\r\nZanesville.  The result was the election in Ohio of a majority of\r\nDemocratic Members of Congress.  This, following the overwhelming\r\nRepublican victory in 1861, when Tod was elected governor by a\r\nmajority of 55,203, was a revolution which could only be ascribed\r\nto the events of the war and to the issue of the proclamation.  It\r\nmay be also partially ascribed to the discontent growing out of\r\nthe appointments, by Governor Tod, of officers in the volunteers.\r\nThe same discontent defeated the renomination of Governor Dennison\r\nin 1861.  Such is the usual result of the power of appointment,\r\nhowever prudently exercised.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was promptly organized on the 7th of\r\nDecember, 1863, by the election of Schuyler Colfax as speaker.\r\nThe session of Congress that followed was perhaps the busiest and\r\nmost important one in the history of our government.  The number\r\nof measures to be considered, the gravity of the subject-matter,\r\nand the condition of the country, demanded and received the most\r\ncareful attention.  The acts relating to the organization of the\r\narmy and the one increasing the pay of soldiers, made imperative\r\nby the depreciation of our currency, as well as the draft and\r\nconscription laws, received prompt attention.  The enrollment act,\r\napproved February 24, 1864, proved to be the most effective measure\r\nto increase and strengthen the army.  The bounty laws were continued\r\nand the amount to be paid enlarged.  The laws relating to loans,\r\ncurrency, customs duties and internal taxes required more time and\r\noccupied a great portion of the session.  The revenue bill enacted\r\nat that session was far more comprehensive and the rates much higher\r\nthan in any previous or subsequent law.  It provided for an increase\r\nof all internal taxes contained in previous laws, and added many\r\nnew objects of taxation, so as to embrace nearly every source of\r\nrevenue provided for by American or English laws, including stamp\r\nduties upon deeds, conveyances, legal documents of all kinds,\r\ncertificates, receipts, medicines and preparations of perfumery,\r\ncosmetics, photographs, matches, cards, and indeed every instrument\r\nor article to which a stamp could be attached.  It also provided\r\nfor taxes on the succession to real estate, legacies, distributive\r\nshares of personal property, and a tax of from five to ten per\r\ncent. on all incomes above $600, upon all employments, upon all\r\ncarriages, yachts, upon slaughtered cattle, swine and sheep, upon\r\nexpress companies, insurance companies, telegraph companies,\r\ntheaters, operas, circuses, museums and lotteries, upon all banks\r\nand bankers, brokers, and upon almost every article of domestic\r\nproduction.  It placed a heavy tax upon licenses, upon dealers in\r\nspirits, upon brokers, lottery-ticket dealers and almost every\r\nemployment of life.\r\n\r\nIt largely increased the tax on spirits, ale, beer, porter, and\r\ntobacco in every form.  Not content with this, on the last day of\r\nthe session, Congress levied a special income tax of five per cent.,\r\nto provide for the bounties promised to Union soldiers.  This\r\ndrastic bill occupied the attention of both Houses during a\r\nconsiderable portion of the session, and became a law only on the\r\n30th of June, 1864, within four days of the close of the session.\r\nIt was greatly feared that the law could create discontent, but it\r\nwas received with favor by the people, few if any complaints being\r\nmade of the heavy burden it imposed.  The customs duties were\r\ncarefully revised, not in the interest of protection but solely\r\nfor revenue.  Nearly all the articles formerly on the free list\r\nwere made dutiable, and they proved to be copious sources of revenue,\r\nespecially the duties on tea, coffee, spirits of all kinds, wines,\r\ncigars, and tobacco in every form.\r\n\r\nDuring that session Congress passed two important loan bills, which\r\npractically confided to the Secretary of the Treasury the power to\r\nborrow money in almost any form that could be devised.  The first\r\nact, approved March 3, 1864, authorized him to borrow, on the credit\r\nof the United States, $200,000,000 during the current fiscal year,\r\nredeemable after any period not less than five years, and payable\r\nat any period not more than forty years from date, in coin, and\r\nbearing interest at six per cent. per annum.  It also provided for\r\nthe issue of $11,000,000 5-20 bonds which had been sold in excess\r\nof the $500,000,000 authorized by law.  By the act approved June\r\n30, 1864, the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to borrow,\r\non the credit of the United States, $400,000,000, on bonds redeemable\r\nat the pleasure of the United States after a period of not less\r\nthan five, nor more than forty, years from date, bearing an annual\r\ninterest of not exceeding six per cent., payable semi-annually in\r\ncoin.  He was authorized to receive for such bonds lawful money of\r\nthe United States, or, at his discretion, treasury notes, certificates\r\nof indebtedness or certificates of deposit, issued under any act\r\nof Congress.  These bonds were similar in general description to\r\nthe 5-20 bonds already provided for, but bore interest at five per\r\ncent. instead of six.\r\n\r\nBy these measures the people of the United States had placed in\r\nthe power of the government almost unlimited sources of revenue,\r\nand all necessary expedients for borrowing.  Strange as it may\r\nappear, under the operation of these laws the country was very\r\nprosperous.  All forms of industry hitherto conducted, and many\r\nothers, were in healthy operation.  Labor was in great demand and\r\nfully occupied.  This will account for the passage of several laws\r\nthat would not be justified except in an emergency like the one\r\nthen existing.  Among these was an act to encourage immigration,\r\napproved July 4, 1864.  This act grew out of the great demand for\r\nlabor caused by the absence of so many men in the army.  A commission\r\nof immigration was provided.  Immigrants were authorized to pledge\r\ntheir wages, for a term not exceeding twelve months, to repay the\r\nexpense of their immigration.  These contracts were declared to be\r\nvalid in law and might be enforced in the courts of the United\r\nStates or of the several states and territories.  It provided that\r\nno immigrant should be compulsorily enrolled for military service\r\nduring the existing insurrection, unless such immigrant voluntarily\r\nrenounced, under oath, his allegiance to the country of his birth,\r\nand declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States.\r\nThis law could only be justified by the condition of affairs then\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nAnother law, alike indefensible, but considered important at the\r\ntime, regulating the sale of gold, was approved June 17, 1864.\r\nIt declared unlawful a contract for the purchase or sale and delivery\r\nof any gold coin or bullion, to be delivered on any day subsequent\r\nto the making of the contract.  It also forbade the purchase or\r\nsale and delivery of foreign exchange, to be delivered at any time\r\nbeyond ten days subsequent to the making of such contract, or the\r\nmaking of any contract for the sale and delivery of any gold coin\r\nor bullion, of which the person making such contract was not at\r\nthe time of making it in actual possession.  It also declared it\r\nto be unlawful to make any loans of money or currency to be repaid\r\nin coin or bullion or to make any loan of coin or bullion to be\r\nrepaid in currency.  All these provisions were made to prevent what\r\nwere regarded as bets on the price of gold.  This law, however,\r\nproved to be ineffective, as all such laws interfering with trade\r\nand speculation must be, and was soon repealed.\r\n\r\nThe national banking act, which passed at the previous session,\r\nwas carefully revised and enacted in a new form, and it still\r\nremains in force, substantially unchanged by subsequent laws.  By\r\nthis new act the office of comptroller of the currency was created.\r\nUnder its provisions, aided by a heavy tax on the circulating notes\r\nof state banks, such banks were converted into national banks upon\r\nsuch conditions as secured the payment of their circulating notes.\r\n\r\nThe financial measures, to which I have referred, were the work of\r\nthe committees of ways and means of the House and on finance in\r\nthe Senate.  They occupied the chief attention of both Houses, and\r\nmay fairly be claimed by the members of those committees as successful\r\nmeasures of the highest importance.  I was deeply interested in\r\nall of them, took a very active part in their preparation in\r\ncommittee, and their conduct in the Senate, and, with the other\r\nmembers of the committee, feel that the measures adopted contributed\r\nlargely to the final triumph of the Union cause.  Certainly, the\r\nfull power of the United States, its credit and the property of\r\nits people were by these laws intrusted to the executive authorities\r\nto suppress the rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to military and financial measures, that session was\r\nprolific in many other measures of primary importance.  The Union\r\nPacific Railroad Company, which had been chartered by the previous\r\nCongress, found itself unable to proceed, and appealed to Congress\r\nfor additional aid.  This was granted by the act of July 2, 1864.\r\nUnder this act, the first lien of the United States for bonds\r\nadvanced to the company, provided for by the act of 1862, was made\r\nsubordinate to the lien of the bonds of the company sold in the\r\nmarket--a fatal error, which led to all the serious complications\r\nwhich followed.  The proceeds of the sale of the first mortgage\r\nbonds of the company, with a portion of those issued by the United\r\nStates in aid of the company, built both the Union and Central\r\nPacific, so that the constructors of those roads, who were mainly\r\ndirectors and managers of the company, practically received as\r\nprofit a large portion of the bonds of the United States issued in\r\naid of the work, and almost the entire capital stock of the company.\r\nIf the act had been delayed until after the war, when the securities\r\nof the United States rapidly advanced in value, it could not have\r\npassed in the form it did.  The construction of the road was\r\npractically not commenced until the war was over.  The constructors\r\nhad the benefit of the advancing value of the bonds and of the\r\nincreasing purchasing power of United States notes.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that the bill for the construction of the Northern\r\nPacific Railroad came up at the same time.  It was a faulty measure,\r\nmaking excessive grants of public lands to aid in the construction\r\nof a railroad and telegraph line from Lake Superior to Puget Sound.\r\nIt was an act of incorporation with broad and general powers,\r\ncarelessly defined, and with scarcely any safeguards to protect\r\nthe government and its lavish grants of land.  Some few amendments\r\nwere made, but mostly in the interest of the corporation, and the\r\nbill finally passed the Senate without any vote by yeas and nays.\r\n\r\nThese two bills prove that it is not wise during war to provide\r\nmeasures for a time of peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the same session the Territories of Colorado, Nebraska and\r\nNevada were authorized to form state governments for admission into\r\nthe Union, and a government was provided for each of the Territories\r\nof Montana and Idaho.  The great object of organizing all the Indian\r\ncountry of the west into states and territories was to secure the\r\ncountry from Indian raids and depredations.\r\n\r\nBy far the most beneficial action of Congress at this session was\r\nthe passage of the 13th article of the constitution of the United\r\nStates, viz., \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except\r\nas a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\nconvicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place\r\nsubject to their jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thoroughly debated, and passed the Senate by the large vote\r\nof 38 yeas and 6 nays.  It subsequently received the sanction of\r\nthe House and of the requisite number of states to make it a part\r\nof the constitution.  This was the natural and logical result of\r\nthe Civil War.  In case the rebellion should fail, it put at an\r\nend all propositions for compensation for slaves in loyal states,\r\nand all question of the validity of the emancipation proclamation\r\nof Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe following letter of Secretary Chase shows the extremity of the\r\nmeasures deemed to be necessary at this period of the war:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, May 26, 1864.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I inclose two drafts of a national bank taxation\r\nclause--one marked 'A,' providing for the appropriation of the\r\nwhole tax to the payment of interest or principal of the public\r\ndebt and repealing the real estate direct tax law, and another\r\nmarked 'B,' dividing the proceeds of the tax between the national\r\nand the loyal states.  In either form the clause will be vastly\r\nmore beneficial to the country than in the form of the bill, whether\r\noriginal or amended.\r\n\r\n\"I also inclose a draft of a section providing for a tax on banks\r\nnot national in the internal revenue act.  It substantially restates\r\nthe House proposition limiting it to banks of the states.  Some\r\ndiscrimination in favor of the national system which affords\r\nsubstantial support to the government as compared with the local\r\nsystem, which circulates notes in competition with those issued by\r\nthe government, seems to me indispensably necessary.  It is impossible\r\nto prevent the depreciation of the currency unless Congress will\r\nassume its constitutional function and control it; and it is idle\r\nto try to make loans unless Congress will give the necessary support\r\nto the public credit.  I am now compelled to advertise for a loan\r\nof fifty millions, and, to avoid as far as practicable the evils\r\nof sales below par, must offer the long bonds of '81.  Should the\r\nprovisions I ask for be denied, I may still be able to negotiate\r\nthe loan on pretty fair terms; but I dread the effects on future\r\nloans.\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto I have been able to maintain the public credit at the\r\nbest points possible with a surcharged circulation.  My ability to\r\ndo so is due mainly to the legislation of the session of 1862-63.\r\nI must have further legislation in the same direction if it is\r\ndesired to maintain that ability.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"S. P. Chase.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nA few days before the close of the session, on the 29th of June,\r\n1864, Mr. Chase tendered his resignation as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  This created quite a sensation in political circles.\r\nIt was thought to be the culmination of the feeling created by the\r\nnomination of Lincoln and the alleged rivalry of Chase, but the\r\nstatements made in the \"History of Lincoln,\" by Nicolay and Hay,\r\nand the \"Biography of Chase,\" by Schuckers, clearly show that the\r\ncause of the resignation arose long anterior to this event and\r\ngradually produced a condition of affairs when either Mr. Lincoln\r\nhad to yield his power over appointments or Mr. Chase retire from\r\nhis office.  No good would result from analyzing the events which\r\nled to this resignation.  The cause was perhaps best stated by Mr.\r\nLincoln in accepting it, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your resignation of the office of Secretary of the Treasury, sent\r\nme yesterday, is accepted.  Of all I have said in commendation of\r\nyour ability and fidelity I have nothing to unsay, and yet you and\r\nI have reached a point of mutual embarrassment in our official\r\nrelation which it seems cannot be overcome or longer sustained\r\nconsistently with the public service.\"\r\n\r\nThe nomination of David Tod, of Ohio, as Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto succeed Mr. Chase, was not well received in either House.  If\r\nthe Members had known Tod as well as I did, they would have known\r\nthat he was not only a good story teller, but a sound, able,\r\nconservative business man, fully competent to deal with the great\r\noffice for which he was nominated.  His declination, however,\r\nprevented a controversy which would have been injurious, whatever\r\nmight have been the result.  An anecdote frequently told by him\r\nmay, perhaps, explain his nomination.\r\n\r\nWhen he was elected Governor of Ohio, he went to Washington to see\r\nMr. Lincoln, to find out, as he said, what a Republican President\r\nwanted a Democratic Governor of Ohio to do in aid of the Union\r\ncause.  He called at the White house, sent in his card, and was\r\ninformed that the President was engaged, but desired very much to\r\nsee Governor Tod, and invited him to call that evening at 7 o'clock.\r\nPromptly on time Governor Tod called and was ushered into the room\r\nwhere, for the first time, he saw Mr. Lincoln.  Mutual salutation\r\nhad scarcely been exchanged before the announcement was made that\r\nDavid K. Cartter was at the door.  Mr. Lincoln asked the governor\r\nif he had any objection to Cartter hearing their talk.  The governor\r\nsaid no, that Cartter was an old friend and law partner of his.\r\nSoon after Governor Nye of Nevada was announced.  The same inquiry\r\nwas made and answered, and Nye joined the party, and in the same\r\nway Sam. Galloway, of Ohio, and a famous joker from New York, whose\r\nname I do not recall, came in.  Then grouped around the table, Nye\r\nled off with a humorous description of life in the mines in the\r\nearly days of California, and the others contributed anecdotes,\r\nhumor and fun, in which Lincoln took the lead, \"and I\" (as Tod told\r\nthe story), \"not to be behindhand, told a story;\" and so the hours\r\nflew on without any mention of the grave matters he expected to\r\ndiscuss with the President.  When the clock announced the hour of\r\neleven, Mr. Lincoln said he made it a habit to retire at eleven\r\no'clock, and, turning to Tod, said:  \"Well, Governor, we have not\r\nhad any chance to talk about the war, but we have had a good time\r\nanyway; come and see me again.\"  It then dawned upon the governor\r\nthat this little party of kindred spirits, all friends of his, were\r\ninvited by the President to relive him from an interview about the\r\nfuture that would be fruitless of results.  Neither could know what\r\neach ought to do until events pointed out a duty to be done.\r\nLincoln knew that Tod was a famous story teller, as were all the\r\nothers in the party, and availed himself of the opportunity to\r\nrelieve his mind from anxious care.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tod told me this anecdote and related many of the stories\r\ntold at that symposium.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of William P. Fessenden as Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwas a natural one to be made, and received the cordial support of\r\nMembers of the Senate, even of those who did not like his occasional\r\nill temper and bitterness.  And here I may properly pause to notice\r\nthe traits of two men with whom I was closely identified in public\r\nlife, and for whom I had the highest personal regard, although they\r\nwidely differed from each other.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden was an able lawyer, a keen incisive speaker, rarely\r\nattempting rhetoric, but always a master in clear, distinct statement\r\nand logical argument.  He had been for a number of years dyspeptic,\r\nand this, no doubt, clouded his temper and caused many of the bitter\r\nthings he said.  When I entered the Senate, I was, at his request,\r\nplaced on the committee on finance, of which he was chairman.  He\r\nwas kind enough to refer to my position in the House as chairman\r\nof the committee of ways and means, and my action there, and to\r\nexpress the hope that I would be able to aid him in dealing with\r\nfinancial question, in which he had no training and but little\r\ninterest.  I accepted the position with pleasure, and in general\r\nco-operated with him, though on many important subjects we widely\r\ndiffered.  His appointment as Secretary of the Treasury left me\r\nchairman of the committee on finance, but my intercourse with him\r\ncontinued while he was secretary.  During the short period in which\r\nhe held that office, I had many conferences with him in respect to\r\npending questions.  When he returned to the Senate, on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1865, he resumed his old place as chairman of the committee\r\non finance, and continued in that position nearly two years, when,\r\nhis health becoming more feeble, he resigned his membership of that\r\ncommittee, and I again took his place as chairman and held it until\r\nappointed Secretary of the Treasury in 1877.  His health continued\r\nto fail and he died at Portland, Maine, September 8, 1869.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Chase I had but little acquaintance and no sympathy during\r\nhis early political career.  His edition of the \"Statutes of Ohio\"\r\nwas his first work of any importance.  He was at times supposed to\r\nbe a Whig and then again classed as a Democrat.  Later he became\r\na member of the national convention of Free Soilers held at Buffalo,\r\nAugust 9, 1848, over which he presided.  This convention was composed\r\nof delegates from eighteen states, and included in its active\r\nmembers many of the most eminent Whigs and Democrats of a former\r\ntime.  It nominated Martin Van Buren for the Presidency, and Charles\r\nFrancis Adams for Vice President.  General Taylor, the nominee of\r\nthe Whig party, was elected President, but Mr. Van Buren received\r\n291,342 votes, being nearly one-eighth of the whole number of votes\r\ncast.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that when the Ohio legislature met in December,\r\n1848, it was composed of an equal number of Whigs and Democrats\r\nand of two members, Townsend and Morse, who classed themselves as\r\nFree Soilers.  They practically dictated the election of Mr. Chase\r\nas United States Senator.  They secured his election by an\r\nunderstanding, express or implied, with the Democratic members,\r\nthat they would vote for Democrats for all the numerous offices,\r\nwhich, under the constitution of the state as it then stood, were\r\nappointed by the legislature.  This bargain and sale--so-called--\r\ncreated among the Whigs a strong prejudice against Chase.  But\r\nevents in Congress, especially the act repealing the Missouri\r\nCompromise, practically dissolved existing parties, and left Mr.\r\nChase in the vantage ground of having resisted this measure with\r\nfirmness.  He was universally regarded as a man of marked ability\r\nand honest in his convictions.  In the election for Members of\r\nCongress in 1854, he supported what were known as the anti-Nebraska\r\ncandidates, and, no doubt, contributed to their election.  When he\r\nwas nominated for governor, I was naturally brought into friendly\r\nrelations with him, and these, as time advanced, were cordial and\r\nintimate.  Our correspondence was frequent, mostly of a personal\r\ncharacter, and our intimacy continued while he lived.  When he was\r\nSecretary of the Treasury I was frequently consulted by him, and\r\nhad, as I believe, his entire confidence.  I have a great number\r\nof letters from him written during that period.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1864, Mr. Chase was my guest at Mansfield for a day\r\nor two.  He was evidently restless and uneasy as to his future.\r\nI spoke to him about the position of chief justice, recently made\r\nvacant by the death of Taney.  He said it was a position of eminence\r\nthat ought to satisfy the ambition of anyone, but for which few\r\nmen were fitted.  Early in October I received a letter from him\r\nwhich shows he was actively engaged in the canvass, and that the\r\ncommon belief that he did not desire the election of Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas without foundation.  He wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Louisville, October 2, 1864.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Some days since I informed the secretary of the\r\nstate central committee that I would, as far as possible, fill the\r\nappointments which ill-health had obliged Gov. Tod to decline.\r\nSeeing afterwards, however, that he had determined to meet them\r\nhimself, I acceded to requests from other quarters to given them\r\nwhat help I could.  The first intimation I had that he would fail\r\nin any of them was your letter, put into my hands just as I was\r\nleaving Cincinnati for New Albany last Friday.  It was then too\r\nlate to recall my own appointments, and, of course, I cannot be at\r\nMansfield.  I should be glad to be there; but regret the impossibility\r\nof it the less since I should not meet you.  I am really glad you\r\nare going to Logansport.  The election of Gov. Morton is of vast\r\nimportance to our cause.  And, then, Colfax, I feel most anxious\r\nfor him.  I hope you can go to his district.  I wanted to go myself;\r\nbut was urged to other parts of Indiana, and was left no chance to\r\nreach it till this week; which must be given to Ohio in aid of\r\nStevenson and Bundy, except that I speak here to-morrow (Monday),\r\nand Tuesday night in Covington.\r\n\r\n\"There has been a very large accumulation of troops here, for\r\nSherman.  Col. Hammond telegraphed the department at Washington\r\nyesterday that, communications being now re-established from\r\nNashville to Atlanta, he could commence sending them forward\r\nimmediately; and doubtless the movement will begin tomorrow.  I\r\ncongratulate you most heartily of his splendid success thus far\r\nand on the certainty that no effort will be spared to maintain his\r\narmy at the highest possible point of efficiency.\r\n\r\n\"There appears to be no truth in the report of a co-operative\r\nmovement in aid of Sheridan for Tennessee.  Burbridge's expedition\r\nis for a point beyond Abingdon where there are important salt works,\r\nand he intends returning thence through Knoxville.  So I learn from\r\none who ought to know; but don't understand it.  _That game_ seems\r\nhardly worth the candle.\r\n\r\n\"We had a splendid meeting in Aurora yesterday and our friends are\r\nconfident of Gov. Morton's re-election.  Thousands of people stood\r\nin a pouring rain to hear me and Gov. Lane talk to them, and\r\nprofounder or more earnest attention I never witnessed.  It will\r\ngratify you, I am sure, to know that I receive, wherever I go,\r\nunequivocal manifestations of a popular confidence and appreciation,\r\nwhich I did not suppose I possessed.\r\n\r\n\"There is not now the slightest uncertainty about the re-election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln.  The only question is, by what popular and what\r\nelectoral majority.  God grant that both may be so decisive as to\r\nturn every hope of rebellion to despair!\r\n\r\n\"You ask about Mr. Fessenden's remaining in the cabinet.  He will\r\nbe a candidate for re-election to the Senate; and if successful\r\nwill leave his present post in March, or sooner if circumstances\r\nallow.  He has been in communication with me since he took charge,\r\nand in every step, with perhaps one slight exception, his judgment\r\nhas corresponded with mine.  He sees several matters now in quite\r\na different light from that in which they appeared to him when\r\nSenator.  He would now, for example, _cordially support_ your\r\nproposition for a heavy discriminating tax upon all unnational\r\ncirculation.  And he is more than just--he is very generous in his\r\nappreciation of the immense work of organization and effective\r\nactivity to be found in the department.\r\n\r\n\"How signally are events confirming my views as to the value of\r\ngold, compared with national currency.  How clear it is now that\r\nif Congress had come boldly to the act of marked discriminative\r\ntaxation on all non-national circulation and final prohibition\r\nafter a few years, say two--or at most three--gold would now have\r\nbeen at not more than fifty per cent. premium and that resumption\r\nof specie payments might have been effected within a year.  I trust\r\nthe next session will witness bolder and better legislation.  It\r\nwill be one of your brightest honors that you so clearly saw and\r\nso boldly followed the path of reform; for certainly no greater\r\nboon--except liberty itself--can be conferred upon a nation than\r\na truly national and thoroughly sound currency.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours most truly,\r\n  \"S. P. Chase.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the election he wrote me the following letter, in which he\r\nreferred to the appointment of a chief justice, with an evident\r\ndesire for the office:\r\n\r\n  \"Cincinnati, November 12, 1864.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--The papers still state you are in Washington.  I am\r\nglad of it, and hope you may be able to render good service to our\r\nfriend, Fessenden.  The task of preparing a report is no light one.\r\nAt least it always made me sweat and keep late hours.  May he find\r\na safe deliverance from the labor.\r\n\r\n\"All sorts of rumors are afloat about everything.  Those which\r\nconcern me most relate to the vacant seat on the bench; but I give\r\nlittle heed to any of them.  My experience in Washington taught me\r\nhow unreliable they are.  If what I hear is any index to the state\r\nof opinion, Mr. Lincoln must be satisfied that in acting on the\r\npurpose expressed in your letters, he will have the almost, if not\r\nquite, unanimous approval of the Union men throughout the country.\r\nSo I 'possess my soul in patience,' and urge nothing.\r\n\r\n\"If it did not seem to me a sort of indelicacy even to allow to\r\nanyone the slightest occasion to say that I solicit or even ask\r\nsuch an appointment as a favor or as a reward for political service,\r\nI should now be on my way to Washington; but I think it due to\r\nmyself as well as the President to await his decision here; though,\r\nif appointed, I hope the appointment will be considered as made\r\nfrom the country at large rather than from Ohio alone.  My legal\r\nresidence is here; but my actual domicile is still in the District.\r\n\r\n\"Please write me, if you can, when the President will act.  Let me\r\nknow too how the military and political aspects at Washington appear\r\nto you.  We have achieved a glorious political victory, which must\r\ngreatly help our military prospects and possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Miller has just come in and says he goes to Washington to-\r\nnight.  Had he come before I began, I should have spared you this\r\nletter; only asking him to make verbally the inquiries I have just\r\nset down; but I will send it with 'answer respectfully solicited.'\r\n\r\n  \"Yours very cordially,\r\n  \"S. P. Chase.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in December I received the following letter, which indicates\r\nvery clearly that Mr. Chase was anxious for the position of chief\r\njustice, and wished his appointment made, if at all, before his\r\narrival in Washington:\r\n\r\n  \"Cleveland, December 2, 1864.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 27th of November reached me here to-\r\nday.  Yesterday I fulfilled my appointment to make an address on\r\nthe dedication of the college edifice recently erected at Mount\r\nUnion, under the patronage of the Pittsburg conference of the\r\nMethodist church.  A number of leading men of the denomination were\r\npresent and assured me of the profound wishes of themselves and\r\nthe most influential men of the connection for my appointment.\r\nThese indeed seem to be universal except with an inconsiderable\r\nnumber whom various circumstances have made unfriendly personally.\r\nSo that I cannot doubt that the President's adherence to his declared\r\nintention is more important to our cause and to his administration\r\nthan it is to me personally.  Not to be appointed after such\r\ndeclaration and such expressions would, no doubt, be a mortification;\r\nbut it would not, I think, be any serious injury to me.\r\n\r\n\"I expect to be in Washington, Tuesday or Wednesday.  I should have\r\nbeen there long since had this appointment been determined either\r\nway; but I must come now.  My personal duties, unconnected with\r\nit, have required and now require my attention, and though I hated\r\nto come before I knew that there remains nothing to hope or fear\r\nconcerning it, I must.  I will be at the Continental, Philadelphia,\r\nTuesday morning.\r\n\r\n\"Our news from Tennessee is important and encouraging.  Garfield's\r\nsuccess against Forrest was brilliant.  I hope Thomas will succeed\r\nas well against Hood.\r\n\r\n\"General Sherman must now be near the coast.  His enterprise is\r\nfull of hazard, but a hazard wisely incurred as it seems to me.\r\nI ardently hope that 'out of the nettle, danger, he will pluck the\r\nflower, safety.'\r\n\r\n\"Our majority on the presidential election in Ohio turns out much\r\nless than I anticipated.  It will hardly, if at all, exceed fifty\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n  \"Faithfully yours,\r\n  \"S. P. Chase.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Washington at the beginning of the next session\r\nI called upon the President and recommended the appointment of Mr.\r\nChase.  We had a brief conversation upon the subject in which he\r\nasked me pointedly the question whether if Chase was appointed he\r\nwould be satisfied, or whether he would immediately become a\r\ncandidate for President.  I told him I thought his appointment to\r\nthat great office ought to and would satisfy his ambition.  He then\r\ntold me that he had determined to appoint him and intended to send\r\nthe nomination to the Senate that day and he did so, December 6,\r\n1864.  After Mr. Chase had become chief justice he still had a\r\nlingering interest in the financial policy of the country.  On\r\nMarch 1, 1865, I received from him the following letter.  The\r\nportion which refers to the legal tender laws will naturally excite\r\nsome interest in view of his decision against the power of Congress\r\nto make the notes of the United States a legal tender.  He wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"At Home, March 1, 1865.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--More to fulfill a promise than with the hope of\r\nservice I write this note.\r\n\r\n\"Your speech on the finances is excellent.  There are one or two\r\npoints on which I shall express myself otherwise; but, in the main,\r\nit commands the fullest assent of my judgment.\r\n\r\n\"Your appreciation of the currency question exactly corresponds\r\nwith my own; only I would not give up the national currency even\r\nif we must endure for years depreciation through the issues of\r\nstate banks before getting rid of them.\r\n\r\n\"The clause in the bill, as it came from the House, imposing a tax\r\nof ten per cent. on all notes not authorized by Congress which may\r\nbe paid out after this year by any bank, whether state or national,\r\nwill do much towards making our currency sound.\r\n\r\n\"I will briefly indicate what I should prefer and what I should\r\nmost zealously labor to have sanctioned by Congress if I were at\r\nthe head of the treasury department.\r\n\r\n\"1.  Let the monthly tax on state bank circulation be increased to\r\none-half of one per cent.\r\n\r\n\"2.  Provide that any bank may pay into the national treasury the\r\namount of its circulation in United States notes or national currency\r\nand that on such payment the bank making it shall be exempt from\r\ntaxation on circulation.\r\n\r\n\"3.  Provide for the application to the redemption of the circulation\r\nrepresented by such payments, of the United States notes or national\r\ncurrency so paid in, and strictly prohibit the paying out of such\r\nnotes for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n\"This measure contemplates:\r\n\r\n\"1.  An exclusive national currency.\r\n\r\n\"2.  Relief of the state banks from taxation upon circulation which\r\nthey cannot get in.\r\n\r\n\"3.  The assumption of the duty of redemption by the national\r\ntreasury with means provided by the state banks.\r\n\r\n\"4.  Reduction in the amount in circulation while the payments into\r\nthe treasury are being made and opportunity of some provision for\r\nredemption which will not again increase it.\r\n\r\n\"The effect will be:\r\n\r\n\"1.  Healthful condition of currency and consequent activity in\r\nproduction and increase of resources.\r\n\r\n\"2.  Gradual restoration of national notes to equality with specie\r\nand the facilitating of resumption of specie payments.\r\n\r\n\"3.  Improvement of national credit.\r\n\r\n\"4.  Diminution of national expenditures and possible arrest of\r\nthe increase of national debt.\r\n\r\n\"Half measures are better than no measures; but thorough measures\r\nare best.\r\n\r\n\"I will only add, that while I have never favored legal tender laws\r\nin principle, and never consented to them except under imperious\r\nnecessity, I yet think it unwise to prohibit the making of any of\r\nthe treasury notes authorized by the bill now before Congress legal\r\ntenders.  The compound interest legal tender notes have then\r\nfulfilled all my expectations for their issue and use; and may be\r\nmade most useful helps in gradual reduction of the volume of\r\ncirculation by substituting them for legal tenders bearing no\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot elaborate this now.  You will see how the thing will work\r\nwithout any suggestion of mine.  Faithfully your friend,\r\n\r\n  \"S. P. Chase.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nFrom my long and intimate acquaintance with Chief Justice Chase I\r\nam quite sure that the duties of the great office he then held were\r\nnot agreeable to him.  His life had been a political one, and this\r\ngave him opportunity for travel and direct communion with the\r\npeople.  The seclusion and severe labor imposed upon the Supreme\r\nCourt were contrary to his habits and injurious to his health.  It\r\ntook him some years to become accustomed to the quiet of judicial\r\nlife.  He presided over the Senate while acting as a court of\r\nimpeachment during the trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868.  While\r\nstrongly opposed to the impeachment, he manifested no sign of\r\npartiality.  He died in New York city on the 7th of May, 1873, at\r\nthe age of sixty-five.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was in session, the Republican national convention\r\nmet at Baltimore on the 7th day of June, 1864, to nominate candidates\r\nfor President and Vice President of the United States, and to\r\nannounce the principles and policy of the Republican party of the\r\nUnited States.  The nomination of Mr. Lincoln had already been made\r\nby state legislatures and by the loyal people of the United States\r\nin every form in which popular opinion can be expressed.  The feeble\r\nexpressions of dissent were but a whisper compared with the loud\r\nproclamations coming from every loyal state in favor of Lincoln.\r\nThe convention, with unanimous assent, ratified and confirmed the\r\npopular choice.\r\n\r\nThe nomination for Vice President was dictated by the desire to\r\nrecognize the loyalty and patriotism of those who, living in states\r\nin rebellion, remained true and loyal to the Federal Union.  Though\r\nMr. Johnson disappointed the expectations of those who nominated\r\nhim, yet at that time his courage and fidelity and his services\r\nand sacrifices for the cause of the Union fully justified his\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nMore important, even, than the choice of candidates, was the\r\ndeclaration by the convention of the policy of the Republican party.\r\nThe key-note of that policy was the third resolution, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, that as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes\r\nthe strength of this rebellion, and as it must be always and\r\neverywhere hostile to the principles of republican government,\r\njustice and the national safety demand its utter and complete\r\nextirpation from the soil of the republic; and that we uphold and\r\nmaintain the acts and proclamations by which the government, in\r\nits own defense, has aimed a deathblow at the gigantic evil.  We\r\nare in favor, furthermore, of such an amendment to the constitution,\r\nto be made by the people in conformity with its provisions, as\r\nshall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of slavery within\r\nthe limits or the jurisdiction of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the logical result of the war.  If it was carried into\r\nfull execution, it would settle on a just and sure foundation the\r\nonly danger that ever threatened the prosperity of the Union.  This\r\nwas happily carried into full effect by the constitutional amendment\r\nto which I have already referred.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic convention met at Chicago on the 29th of August,\r\n1864, and nominated George B. McClellan as the candidate for\r\nPresident and George H. Pendleton as Vice President; but far more\r\nimportant and dangerous was the second, and the only material\r\nresolution of the platform which was drawn by Vallandigham and was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, that this convention does explicitly declare, as the\r\nsense of the American people, that after four years of failure to\r\nrestore the Union by the experiment of war, during which, under\r\nthe pretense of a military necessity of a war power higher than\r\nthe constitution, the constitution itself has been disregarded in\r\nevery part, and public liberty and private right alike trodden\r\ndown, and the material prosperity of the country essentially\r\nimpaired, justice, humanity, liberty and the public welfare demand\r\nthat immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities with\r\na view to an ultimate convention of all the states, or other\r\npeaceable means, to the end that, at the earliest practicable\r\nmoment, peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of\r\nall the states.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a false declaration, and was also a cowardly surrender to\r\nenemies in open war.  These two resolutions made the momentous issue\r\nsubmitted to the American people.  From the moment it was made the\r\npopular mind grew stronger and firmer in favor of the prosecution\r\nof the war and the abolition of slavery, and more resolute to resist\r\nthe surrender proposed to rebels in arms.  Prior to the adoption\r\nof this resolution, there was apparent languor and indifference\r\namong the people as to who should be President, but after its\r\nadoption there could be no doubt as to the trend of popular opinion.\r\nEvery sentiment of patriotism, the love of flag and country, the\r\npride of our people in the success of our soldiers, and the resentment\r\nof the soldiers themselves at this slur on their achievements--all\r\ncontributed to the rejection of the candidates and the platform of\r\nthe Democratic party, and the overwhelming victory of the Republican\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nI had already entered into the canvass when this resolution of\r\nVallandigham was adopted.  It was only necessary to read it to the\r\npeople of Ohio to arouse resentment and opposition.  The scattered\r\nopposition to Mr. Lincoln, much of it growing out of his conservatism,\r\nat once disappeared.  The discontented Republicans who met in\r\nconvention at Cleveland again became active in the Republican ranks.\r\nThe two parties that grew out of factional politics in New York,\r\nthe Blair party and its opponents in Missouri, and the army of\r\ndisaffected office-seekers, waived their dissensions and griefs.\r\nHorace Greeley and the extreme opponents of slavery, represented\r\nby Wendell Phillips, not satisfied with the slow, but constitutional\r\nprocess of emancipation proposed by Lincoln, when compelled to\r\nchoose between that plan of abolition and unconditional surrender\r\nto slavery, naturally voted for Lincoln.  The great body of patriotic\r\nDemocrats in all the states, who supported the war, but were still\r\nattached to their party, quietly voted for Lincoln.  In Ohio,\r\nespecially, where a year before they voted against Vallandigham\r\nfor his disloyalty, they naturally voted against his resolution\r\nfor surrender to the rebels.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign I accompanied Johnson to Indiana where he made\r\npatriotic speeches to great audiences.  His arraignment of the\r\nautocracy of slaveholders in the south was very effective.  The\r\ncurrent of opinion was all in favor of Lincoln.  The result of the\r\nelection for Members of Congress in the states voting in October\r\nwas a decisive indication of the result in November.  All the\r\ncentral states elected a large majority of Republican Members of\r\nCongress.  In Ohio the Union party had a majority of over 50,000\r\nand elected 17 Republican and 2 Democratic Members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  In 1862 Ohio elected 14 Democratic and 5 Republican\r\nMembers.  The presidential election that followed on the 8th of\r\nNovember, 1864, resulted in an overwhelming victory for Lincoln.\r\nHe received 212 and McClellan 21 electoral votes, the latter from\r\nthe States of New Jersey, Delaware and Kentucky.  This political\r\nvictory had a more decisive effect in defeating the rebellion than\r\nmany battles.  I returned to Washington soon after the election.\r\n\r\nI was naturally deeply interested in the movements of General\r\nSherman's march to the sea.  Towards the close of November we had\r\nall sorts of rumors from the south, that General Sherman was\r\nsurrounded by Confederate troops, that his supplies were cut off,\r\nthat successful attacks had been made upon his scattered forces.\r\nI naturally became uneasy, and went to President Lincoln for\r\nconsolation and such news as he could properly give me.  He said:\r\n\"Oh, no, we have no news from General Sherman.  We know what hole\r\nhe went in at, but we do not know what hole he will come out of,\"\r\nbut he expressed his opinion that General Sherman was all right.\r\nSoon after, authentic information came that General Sherman had\r\narrived at Savannah, that Fort McAllister was taken, and the army\r\nwas in communication with the naval forces.  The capture of Savannah\r\nand the northward march of General Sherman's army is part of the\r\nfamiliar military history of the country.\r\n\r\nThe second session of the 38th Congress convened on the 5th of\r\nDecember, 1864.  It was a busy and active session confined mainly\r\nto appropriations, loan and currency bills.  The necessary expenditures\r\nhad been so greatly increased by the war that the aggregate amounts\r\nappropriated naturally created some opposition and alarm, but there\r\nwas no help for it.  As chairman of the committee on finance I did\r\nall I could to reduce the appropriations for civil expenses, but\r\nin respect to military expenditures there could scarcely be any\r\nlimit, the amount necessary being dependent upon military success.\r\nThe hopeful progress of the war gave encouragement that in a brief\r\nperiod the power of the Confederate States would be exhausted and\r\npeace would follow.  We had, however, to legislate upon the basis\r\nof the continued prosecution of the war, and it therefore became\r\nnecessary to increase the revenues in every possible way, and to\r\nprovide for new loans.  The act approved March 3, 1865, authorized\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to borrow not exceeding $600,000,000,\r\nand to issue therefore bonds or treasury notes of the United States\r\nin such form as he might provide.  This was the last great loan\r\nauthorized during the war.  An act to provide internal revenue to\r\nsupport the government was approved on the same day, which modified\r\nmany of the provisions of the previous act, but added subjects of\r\ntaxation not embraced in previous laws.  It especially increased\r\nthe taxes on tobacco in its various forms.  The 6th section\r\nprovided:\r\n\r\n\"That every national banking association, state bank, or state\r\nbanking association, shall pay a tax of ten per centum on the amount\r\nof notes of any state bank or state banking association, paid out\r\nby them after the first day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-\r\nsix.\"\r\n\r\nThis tax on state bank circulation was a practical prohibition of\r\nall state bank paper, and before the time fixed for the commencement\r\nof the tax, this circulation entirely disappeared.  Additional\r\nduties were placed upon certain foreign importations.  Provisions\r\nwere also made for the collection in the insurrectionary districts\r\nwithin the United States of the direct taxes levied under the act\r\nof 1862.  During the entire season my labor was excessive, and when\r\nit closed my health and strength were greatly impaired.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nASSASSINATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\nJohnson's Maudlin Stump Speech in the Senate--Inauguration of\r\nLincoln for the Second Term--My Trip to the South--Paying off a\r\nChurch Debt--Meetings to Celebrate the Success of the Union Army--\r\nNews of the Death of Lincoln--I Attend the Funeral Services--General\r\nJohnston's Surrender to General Sherman--Controversy with Secretary\r\nStanton Over the Event--Review of 65,000 Troops in Washington--Care\r\nof the Old Soldiers--Annual Pension List of $150,000,000--I am Re-\r\nelected to the Senate--The Wade-Davis Bill--Johnson's Treatment of\r\nPublic Men--His Veto of the Civil Rights Bill--Reorganization of\r\nthe Rebel States and Their Final Restoration to the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1865, at the inauguration of the President\r\nand Vice President elect, a scene occurred in the Senate chamber,\r\nwhich made a serious impression, and was indicative of what was to\r\noccur in the future.  About eleven o'clock of that day Andrew\r\nJohnson, Vice President, was shown into the room in the capitol\r\nassigned to the Vice President.  He complained of feeling unwell\r\nand sent for either whisky or brandy, and must have drunk excessively\r\nof it.  A few minutes before twelve o'clock he was ushered into\r\nthe Senate to take the oath of office and to make the usual brief\r\naddress.  He was plainly intoxicated and delivered a stump speech\r\nunworthy of the occasion.  Before him were assembled all the\r\nprincipal officers of the government and the diplomatic corps.  He\r\nwent on in a maudlin and rambling way for twenty minutes or more,\r\nuntil finally he was suppressed by the suggestion of the secretary\r\nthat the time for the inauguration had arrived, and he must close.\r\n\r\nThe procession was formed for the inauguration at the east front\r\nof the capitol, where a great multitude was gathered.  There Mr.\r\nLincoln delivered his memorable inaugural address.  Referring to\r\nthe condition of the controversy at the time of his former inaugural,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would _make_ war\r\nrather than let the Union survive; and the other would _accept_\r\nwar rather than let it perish.  And the war came.\"\r\n\r\nHe hopefully predicted the result of the war, but he said:\r\n\r\n\"Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\r\nthe bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall\r\nbe sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall\r\nbe paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand\r\nyears ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of the Lord\r\nare true and righteous altogether.'\"\r\n\r\nHis peroration will always be remembered for its impressive\r\neloquence:\r\n\r\n\"With malice towards none, with charity for all, with firmness in\r\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to\r\nfinish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care\r\nfor him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and\r\nhis orphan; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and\r\nlasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the adjournment I was invited by Secretary Stanton, with\r\nmany other Senators and our families, to take a trip to the south\r\nin the steamer \"Baltic.\"  Among those on board were Senators Simon\r\nCameron, Wade, Zach. Chandler, and Foster, of Connecticut, then\r\npresident _pro tempore_ of the Senate.  The sea was exceedingly\r\nboisterous.  Nearly all on board were sea sick, but none so badly\r\nas Wade and Chandler, both of whom, I fear, violated the third\r\ncommandment, and nearly all the party were in hearty sympathy with\r\nthem.  I was a good sailor and about the only one who escaped the\r\ncommon fate.  We visited the leading places of interest along the\r\ncoast, but especially Charleston, Beaufort and Savannah.  Charleston\r\nhad but recently been evacuated.  General Sherman was then on his\r\nmarch through North Carolina.  In Charleston everything looked\r\ngloomy and sad.  I rode on horseback alone through different parts\r\nof the city, and was warned by officers not to repeat the ride,\r\nas, if my name was known, I would be in danger of being shot.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Beaufort on Sunday morning.  The town was then full\r\nof contrabands.  We remained there that day and received an invitation\r\nfrom a negro preacher to attend religious services at his new\r\nmeeting-house.  About fifteen or twenty of the party went to the\r\n\"meeting-house,\" a new unfinished skeleton-frame house of considerable\r\nsize without any plastering--a mere shell.  We were shown to seats\r\nthat had been reserved for us.  The rest of the congregation were\r\nnegroes in every kind of dress and of every shade of color.  The\r\nscene was very interesting, but the sermon of the preacher was\r\nlittle better than gibberish.  He was a quaint old man, wearing\r\ngoggles and speaking a dialect we could hardly understand.  At the\r\nclose of his sermon he narrated how the meeting-house had been\r\nbuilt; that John had hauled the logs, Tom, Dick and Harry, naming\r\nthem, had contributed their labor, but they were in debt something\r\nover $200, and, with a significant glance at our little party, he\r\nthought this was a good time to take up a collection.  No sooner\r\nwas this said than Cameron, whispering to me, said:  \"Let's pay\r\nit; I'll give twenty dollars,\" and when the hat came around, instead\r\nof the usual dimes and quarters in ragged currency, it received\r\ngreenbacks of good denominations.  In the meantime the old preacher,\r\nhighly elated, called upon the audience to sing \"John Brown's Body.\"\r\nA feeble, piping voice from an old negro woman started the singing\r\nand the rest of the negroes, with loud melodious voices, joined\r\nin, and, before it was through, the rest of us joined in.  The hat,\r\nwhen returned to the preacher, was found to contain more than fifty\r\ndollars in excess of the amount necessary to pay off the debt.\r\nThen, with many thanks to us by the preacher, the audience was\r\nrequested to remain standing until their visitors left.\r\n\r\nOur visit at Savannah was very interesting.  We there found many\r\nleading citizens of the town who were social and kind, treating us\r\nin a friendly way by rides around the city.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of March, I was invited by General Sherman, then\r\non a visit to Grant near Petersburg, Virginia, to go with him to\r\nGoldsboro, North Carolina, where his army was then encamped.\r\nSecretary Stanton was my next door neighbor, and our families were\r\nintimately associated.  I invited his eldest son, Edwin, then a\r\nyoung man studying law, to accompany me, an invitation which he\r\ngladly accepted.  We joined General Sherman at Fortress Monroe and\r\naccompanied him on the steamer \"Bat\" to Newbern and thence by rail\r\nto Goldsboro.  There was a sense of danger in traveling by rail\r\nthrough a country mostly unoccupied, but we reached the army at\r\nGoldsboro safely.  There I had my first view of a great army in\r\nmarching garb.  Most of the troops had received their new uniforms\r\nand equipments, but outlying regiments were constantly coming in,\r\nragged, with tattered hats, shoes and boots of every description,\r\nalmost black from exposure and the smoke of the pine woods, and as\r\nhardy a looking set of men as one could conceive of.  They had\r\npicked up all kinds of paraphernalia, \"stove pipe\" hats being the\r\nfavorite, and had all sorts of wagons gathered in their march.\r\nTheir appearance was rapidly changed by new uniforms.  After a\r\nbrief visit I returned to Washington, and thence to my home in\r\nMansfield.\r\n\r\nI was invited soon after, on the 14th of April, to attend a mass\r\nmeeting at Columbus to celebrate the success of the Union army.\r\nI accepted the invitation and attended an immense meeting in the\r\nopen air on the capitol grounds, and there Samuel Galloway and\r\nmyself made addresses.  Meetings were held, congratulations uttered\r\nin the evening of that day.  The whole city was in holiday attire,\r\nornamented with flags, and everywhere and with everybody, there\r\nwas an expression of joy.  I retired late at night to my room in\r\nthe hotel, and after my fatigue slept soundly.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Rush Sloane, a personal friend, rapped at\r\nmy door and announced to me the news of the assassination of Lincoln,\r\nand, as then reported, that of Seward.  The change from joy to\r\nmourning that day in Columbus was marked and impressive.  No event\r\nof my life created a more painful impression than this news following\r\nthe rejoicings of the day before.  I returned to Washington and\r\nattended the funeral services over the body of Mr. Lincoln, then\r\nabout to be carried on the long journey to his old home in Springfield,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of May, in response to the invitation of my neighbors\r\nin Mansfield, I made an address upon the life and character of the\r\ndead President.  It expressed the opinion and respect I then\r\nentertained for him, and now I could add nothing to it.  As time\r\nmoves on his name and fame become brighter, while most of his\r\ncontemporaries are one by one forgotten.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Mr. Lincoln, the terms of the surrender of\r\nGeneral Johnston to General Sherman became the subject of a violent\r\ncontroversy.  On the 21st of April, Secretary Stanton issued an\r\norder to General Grant to proceed immediately to the headquarters\r\nof General Sherman and direct operations against the enemy.  He\r\nissued a bulletin in which he intimated that Davis and his partisans\r\nwere on their way to escape to Mexico or Europe with a large amount\r\nof gold plundered from the Richmond banks and from other sources,\r\nand that they hoped to make terms with General Sherman by which\r\nthey would be permitted with their effects, including their gold\r\nplunder, to go to Mexico or Europe.  The most violent and insulting\r\nparagraphs were published in the newspapers, substantially arraigning\r\nGeneral Sherman as a traitor and imputing to him corrupt motives.\r\nI felt myself bound at once, not to defend the terms of surrender,\r\nbut to repel the innuendoes aimed at General Sherman.  This led me\r\ninto a controversy with Mr. Stanton, not worth while to recall.\r\n\r\nI believed then and still believe that he was under the influence\r\nof perhaps a well-grounded fear that his life was in danger.  The\r\natmosphere of Washington seemed to be charged with terror, caused\r\nby the assassination of Lincoln, the wounding of Seward and the\r\nthreats against all who were conspicuous in political or military\r\nlife in the Union cause.  Now, since we are fully informed of all\r\nthe surrounding circumstances connected with the surrender, and\r\nthe belief of General Sherman that he was strictly carrying out\r\nthe policy of President Lincoln, it is plain that he acted in what\r\nhe supposed was the line of duty.  He did not comprehend that the\r\nfatal crime in Washington changed the whole aspect of affairs.\r\nHis agreement with Johnston was on its face declared to be inoperative\r\nuntil approved by the authorities at Washington, and, while the\r\npolitical features of the surrender could not be approved, a simple\r\nnotification of disapproval would have been cheerfully acted upon\r\nand the orders of the President would have been faithfully carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman, when he received notice of the disapproval of his\r\naction, at once notified Johnston, and new terms were arranged in\r\nexact accordance with those conceded by General Grant to General\r\nLee.\r\n\r\nI remained in Washington until the arrival, on the 19th of May, of\r\nGeneral Sherman's army, which encamped by the roadside about half\r\nway between Alexandria and the Long Bridge.  I visited the general\r\nthere and found that he was still smarting under what he called\r\nthe disgrace put upon him by Stanton.  I advised him to keep entirely\r\nquiet, said the feeling had passed away and that his position was\r\nperfectly well understood.  I persuaded him to call on the President\r\nand such members of the cabinet as he knew, and accompanied him.\r\nHe was dressed in full uniform, well worn, was bronzed and looked\r\nthe picture of health and strength.  As a matter of course he\r\nrefused to call on Stanton and denounced him in unmeasured terms,\r\ndeclaring that he would insult him whenever the opportunity occurred.\r\nWhen he came in contact with his fellow officers and found that\r\nthey sympathized with him his anger abated, and by the time the\r\ngreat review took place, he seemed to have recovered his usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe review of General Meade's army was to occur on Tuesday, May\r\n23, and that of General Sherman's, as it was called, on the 24th.\r\nGeneral Sherman, with his wife and her father, Hon. Thomas Ewing,\r\nand myself, were present on the reviewing stand on the first day\r\nof the review.  He received on the stand the congratulations of\r\nhundreds of people and seemed to enjoy every moment of time.  He\r\nwas constantly pointing out to Mr. Ewing and myself the difference\r\nbetween the eastern and western armies, in which he evidently\r\npreferred the Army of the West.  On the next day, prompt to the\r\ntime stated, attended by a brilliant staff, he rode slowly up\r\nPennsylvania avenue at the head of his column, and was followed by\r\na magnificent army of 65,000 men, organized into four army corps,\r\nand marching with that precision only possible with experienced\r\ntroops.  His description of the scene in his \"Memoirs\" proves his\r\ndeep interest in the appearance of his army and his evident pride\r\nin it.  When he arrived at the grand stand, where the President\r\nreviewed the troops, he dismounted, left the line, came upon the\r\nstand and took his place by the side of the President.  Everyone\r\nknew his relations to Stanton, and was curious to see the result\r\nof their meeting.  I stood very near the general, and as he approached\r\nhe shook hands with the President and the members of the cabinet,\r\nbut when Stanton partially reached out his hand, General Sherman\r\npassed him without remark, but everyone within sight could perceive\r\nthe intended insult, which satisfied his honor at the expense of\r\nhis prudence.  However, it is proper to say that these two men,\r\nboth eminent in their way, became entirely reconciled before the\r\ndeath of Mr. Stanton.  General Sherman always stopped with me when\r\nhe was temporarily in Washington, and I know that in a brief period\r\nthey met and conversed in a friendly way.  When Mr. Stanton lay\r\nupon his death bed, General Sherman not only called upon him, but\r\ntendered his services, and exhibited every mark of respect for him.\r\n\r\nThe great body of the volunteer forces was disbanded, the officers\r\nand soldiers were returning to their homes.  To most of them the\r\nwar was a valuable lesson.  It gave them a start in life and a\r\nknowledge and experience that opened to door to all employment,\r\nespecially to official positions in state and nation.  In all\r\npopular elections the soldier was generally preferred.  This was\r\na just recognition for his sacrifices and services.  I hope and\r\ntrust that while a single survivor of the War of the Rebellion is\r\nleft among us, he will everywhere be received with honor and share\r\nall the respect which the boys of my generation were so eager to\r\ngrant and extend to the heroes of the Revolutionary War.  The\r\nservice of one was as valuable as the other, rendered on a broader\r\nfield, in greater numbers, with greater sacrifices, and with the\r\nsame glorious results of securing the continuance of an experiment\r\nof free government, the most successful in the history of mankind\r\nand which is now, I profoundly trust, so well secured by the heroism\r\nand valor of our soldiers, that for generations and centuries yet\r\nto come no enemy will dare to aim a blow at the life of the republic.\r\nFor the wounded and disabled soldiers and the widows and orphans of\r\nthose who fell, a larger provision of pensions was freely granted\r\nthan ever before by any nation in ancient or modern times.\r\nProvision was made by the general government, and by most of the\r\nloyal states, for hospitals and homes for the wounded.  The bodies\r\nof those who died in the service have been carefully collected into\r\ncemeteries in all parts of the United States.  If there has been\r\nany neglect or delay in granting pensions, it has been caused by\r\nthe vast number of applications--more than a million--and the\r\ndifficulty as time passes in securing the necessary proof.  The\r\npension list now, thirty years after the war, requires annually\r\nthe sum of more than $150,000,000, or three times the amount of\r\nall the expenses of the national government before the war.  No\r\ncomplaint is made of this, but Congress readily grants any increase\r\ndemanded by the feebleness of age or the decay of strength.  I\r\ntrust, and believe, that this policy will be continued until the\r\nlast surviving soldier of the war meets the common fate of all.\r\n\r\nI participated in the canvass of 1865, when General Jacob D. Cox,\r\nthe Republican candidate for governor of Ohio, and a Republican\r\nlegislature were elected with but little opposition.  The first\r\nduty of this legislature was to elect a Senator.  There was a\r\nfriendly contest between General Robert C. Schenck, Hon. John A.\r\nBingham and myself, but I was nominated on the first ballot and\r\nduly elected.\r\n\r\nI received many letters from Horace Greeley, in the following one\r\nof which he showed great interest in my re-election to the Senate:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, February 7, 1865.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman:\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 5th inst. at hand.  I can assure you\r\nthat the combination to supplant you in the Senate is quite strong\r\nand confident of success.  I did not mean to allude to the controversy,\r\nbut was compelled to by the dispatch which got into our columns.\r\nI observe J. W. wrote 'locality' as he says, but the change to\r\n'loyalty' was a very awkward one in these days; so I felt compelled\r\nto correct it.\r\n\r\n\"I fear more the raids of Thad. Stevens on the treasury than those\r\nof Mosby on our lines.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  \"Horace Greeley.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met on the 4th of December, 1865, it had before it\r\ntwo important problems which demanded immediate attention.  One\r\nwas a measure for the reconstruction of the states lately in\r\nrebellion and the other was a plan for refunding and paying the\r\npublic debt.  It was unfortunate that no measure had been provided\r\nbefore the close of the war defining the condition of the states\r\nlately in rebellion, securing the freedmen in their new-born rights,\r\nand restoring these states to their place in the Union.  Therefore,\r\nduring the long vacation, from April to December, the whole matter\r\nwas left to executive authority.  If Lincoln had lived, his action\r\nwould have been acquiesced in.  It would have been liberal, based\r\nupon universal emancipation of negroes, and pardon to rebels.  It\r\nwas supposed that President Johnson would err, if at all, in imposing\r\ntoo harsh terms upon these states.  His violent speeches in the\r\ncanvass of 1864, and his fierce denunciation of the leaders in the\r\nRebellion, led us all to suppose that he would insist upon a\r\nreconstruction by the loyal people of the south and that reasonable\r\nprotection would be extended to the emancipated negroes.  The\r\nnecessity of legislation for the reconstruction of the Confederate\r\nstates was foreseen and provision had been made by Congress, during\r\nthe war, by what was known as the Wade-Davis bill, to provide for\r\nthe reorganization of these states.  During the 37th Congress,\r\nHenry Winter Davis, though not then a Member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, prepared a bill to meet this exigency.  It was a\r\nbill to guarantee to each state a republican form of government.\r\nIt embodied a plan by which these states, then declared by Congress\r\nto be in a state of insurrection, might, when that insurrection\r\nwas subdued or abandoned, come back freely and voluntarily into\r\nthe Union.  It provided for representation, for the election of a\r\nconvention and a legislature, and of Senators and Members of\r\nCongress.  It was a complete guarantee to the people of the\r\ninsurrectionary states that upon certain conditions these states\r\nmight resume their place in the Union when the insurrection had\r\nceased.  This bill he handed to me.  I introduced it at his request.\r\nIt was referred to the judiciary committee, but was not acted upon\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Mr. Davis came into the 38th Congress as a Member of\r\nthe House of Representatives.  Among the first acts performed by\r\nhim after taking his seat was the introduction of this same bill.\r\nOn the 15th of December, 1863, it was debated in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and passed by a very decided vote, and was sent to\r\nthe Senate.  It was reported to the Senate favorably, but in place\r\nof it was substituted a proposition offered by B. Gratz Brown, of\r\nMissouri.  This substitute provided a mode by which the eleven\r\nConfederate states might, when the Rebellion was suppressed within\r\ntheir limits, be restored to their old places in the Union.  The\r\nbill was sent back to the House with the proposed substitute.  A\r\ncommittee of conference was appointed, and the House preferring\r\nthe original bill, the Senate receded from its amendment, and what\r\nwas known as the Wade-Davis bill passed.  It went to President\r\nLincoln, who did not approve it, and it did not become a law, but\r\non the 8th of July, 1864, after the close of the session, he issued\r\nthe following proclamation:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, at the late session Congress passed a bill to guaranty\r\nto certain states, whose governments have been usurped or overthrown,\r\na republican form of government, a copy of which is hereunto annexed;\r\nand whereas the said bill was presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States for his approval less than one hour before the _sine\r\ndie_ adjournment of said session, and was not signed by him; and\r\nwhereas the said bill contains, among other things, a plan for\r\nrestoring the states in rebellion to their proper practical relation\r\nin the Union, which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that\r\nsubject, and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the\r\npeople for their consideration:\r\n\r\n\"Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\r\ndo proclaim, declare, and make known, that while I am (as I was in\r\nDecember last, when by proclamation I propounded a plan for\r\nrestoration) unprepared, by a formal approval of this bill, to be\r\ninflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration; and while\r\nI am also unprepared to declare that the free state constitutions\r\nand governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and\r\nLouisiana shall be set aside and held for naught, thereby repelling\r\nand discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to\r\nfurther effort, or to declare a constitutional competency in Congress\r\nto abolish slavery in states, I am at the same time sincerely hoping\r\nand expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery\r\nthroughout the nation may be adopted.\"\r\n\r\nHe added his reasons for not approving the Wade-Davis bill.  He\r\ndid not entirely disapprove of it, but said it was one of numerous\r\nplans which might be adopted.  Mr. Sumner stated, on the floor of\r\nthe Senate, that he had had an interview with President Lincoln\r\nimmediately after the publication of that proclamation, and it was\r\nthe subject of very minute and protracted conversation, in the\r\ncourse of which, after discussing the details, Mr. Lincoln expressed\r\nhis regret that he had not approved the bill.  I have always thought\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln made a serious mistake in defeating a measure,\r\nwhich, if adopted, would have averted many if not all the difficulties\r\nthat subsequently arose in the reconstruction of the rebel states.\r\n\r\nThe next and closing session of that Congress neglected to provide\r\nfor the reorganization of these states, and, thus, when Mr. Johnson\r\nbecame President, there was no provision of law to guide him in\r\nthe necessary process of reconstruction.  Thus, by the disagreement\r\nbetween Congress and President Lincoln, which commenced two years\r\nbefore the close of the war, there was no law upon the statute book\r\nto guide either the President or the people of the southern states\r\nin their effort to get back into the Union.  It became imperative\r\nduring the long period before the meeting of Congress that President\r\nJohnson should, in the absence of legislation, formulate some plan\r\nfor the reconstruction of these states.  He did adopt substantially\r\nthe plan proposed and acted upon by Mr. Lincoln.  After this long\r\nlapse of time I am convinced that Mr. Johnson's scheme of reconstruction\r\nwas wise and judicious.  It was unfortunate that it had not the\r\nsanction of Congress and that events soon brought the President\r\nand Congress into hostility.  Who doubts that if there had been a\r\nlaw upon the statute book by which the people of the southern states\r\ncould have been guided in their effort to come back into the Union,\r\nthey would have cheerfully followed it, although the conditions\r\nhad been hard?  In the absence of law both Lincoln and Johnson did\r\nsubstantially right when they adopted a plan of their own and\r\nendeavored to carry it into execution.  Johnson, before he was\r\nelected and while acting as military governor of Tennessee, executed\r\nthe plan of Lincoln in that state and subsequently adopted the same\r\nplan for the reorganization of the rebel states.  In all these\r\nplans the central idea was that the states in insurrection were\r\nstill states, entitled to be treated as such.  They were described\r\nas \"The eleven states which have been declared to be in insurrection.\"\r\nThere was an express provision that:\r\n\r\n\"No Senator or Representative shall be admitted into either branch\r\nof Congress from _any of said states_ until Congress shall have\r\ndeclared _such state_ entitled to such representation.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the plans proposed in Congress, as well as in the plan of\r\nJohnson, it was declared that states had no right while in insurrection\r\nto elect electors to the electoral college; they had no right to\r\nelect Senators and Representatives.  In other words they could not\r\nresume the powers, rights and privileges conferred upon states by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, except by the consent of\r\nCongress.  Having taken up arms against the United States, they by\r\nthat act lost their constitutional powers within the United States\r\nto govern and control our councils.  They could not engage in the\r\nelection of a President, or of Senators or Members of Congress;\r\nbut they were still states.  The supreme power of Congress to\r\nchange, alter or modify the acts of the President and to admit or\r\nreject these states and their Senators and Representatives at its\r\nwill and pleasure, and the constitutional right of the respective\r\nHouses to judge of the election, returns and qualifications of its\r\nown Members were recognized.  When Mr. Johnson came into power he\r\nfound the Rebellion substantially subdued.  His first act was to\r\nretain in his confidence, and in his councils, every member of the\r\ncabinet of Abraham Lincoln, and, so far as we know, every measure\r\nadopted by him had the approval and sanction of that cabinet.\r\nEvery act passed by Congress, with or without his assent, upon\r\nevery subject whatever, connected with reconstruction, was fairly\r\nand fully executed.  He adopted all the main features of the Wade-\r\nDavis bill--the only one passed by Congress.  In his proclamation\r\nof May 9, 1865, he provided:\r\n\r\n\"First, That all acts and proceedings of the political, military,\r\nand civil organizations which have been in a state of insurrection\r\nand rebellion within the State of Virginia against the authority\r\nand laws of the United States, and of which Jefferson Davis, John\r\nLetcher, and William Smith were late the respective chiefs, are\r\ndeclared null and void.\"\r\n\r\nThus, with a single stroke, he swept away the whole superstructure\r\nof the Rebellion.  He extended the tax laws of the United States\r\nover the rebel territory.  In his proclamation of May 29, he says:\r\n\r\n\"To the end, therefore, that the authority of the government of\r\nthe United States may be restored, and that peace, order, and\r\nfreedom may be established, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the\r\nUnited States, do proclaim and declare that I hereby grant to all\r\npersons who have directly or indirectly participated in the existing\r\nRebellion, _except as hereinafter excepted_, amnesty and pardon,\r\nwith restoration of all rights of property, _except as to slaves_,\r\nand except in cases where legal proceedings, under the laws of the\r\nUnited States providing for the confiscation of property of person\r\nengaged in rebellion, have been instituted, &c.\"\r\n\r\nHe enforced in every case full and ample protection to the freedmen\r\nof the southern states.  No complaint from them was ever brought\r\nto his knowledge in which he did not do full and substantial justice.\r\nThe principal objection to his policy was that he did not extend\r\nhis proclamation to all the loyal men of the southern states,\r\nincluding the colored as well as the white people.  It must be\r\nremembered in his justification that in every one of the eleven\r\nstates before the Rebellion the negro was, by the laws, excluded\r\nfrom the right to vote.  In Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York that\r\nright was limited.  In a large majority of the states, including\r\nthe most populous, negro suffrage was then prohibited.  It would\r\nseem to be a great stretch of power on his part, by a simple\r\nmandatory proclamation or military order, to confer the franchise\r\non a class of people, who were then prohibited from voting not only\r\nin the eleven southern states, but in a majority of the northern\r\nstates.  Such a provision, if it had been inserted, could not have\r\nbeen enforced, and, in the condition in which slavery left the\r\nnegro race, it could hardly be defended.  I cannot see any reason\r\nwhy, because a man is black, he should not vote, and yet, in making\r\nlaws, as the President was then doing, for the government of the\r\ncommunity, he had to regard the prejudices, not only of the people\r\namong whom the laws were to be executed, but also of the army and\r\nthe people who were to execute those laws, and no man can doubt\r\nbut what at that time there was a strong and powerful prejudice in\r\nthe army and among all classes of citizens against extending the\r\nright of suffrage to negroes, especially down in the far south,\r\nwhere the great body of the slaves were in abject ignorance.\r\n\r\nIt must be also noted that in the Wade-Davis bill Congress did not\r\nand would not make negro suffrage a part of its plan.  Even so\r\nradical an anti-slavery man as my colleague, Senator Wade, did not\r\npropose such a measure.  The effort was made to give emancipated\r\nnegroes the right to vote, and it was abandoned.  By that bill the\r\nsuffrage was conferred only upon _white_ male loyal citizens.  And\r\nin the plan of the President, he adopted in this respect the very\r\nsame conditions for suffrage as those proposed by Congress.  I\r\nbelieve that all the acts and proclamations of President Johnson\r\nbefore the meeting of Congress were wise and expedient, and that\r\nthere would have been no difficulty between Congress and the\r\nPresident but for his personal conduct, and, especially, his\r\ntreatment of Congress and leading Congressmen.  The unfortunate\r\noccurrence, already narrated, at his inauguration, was followed by\r\nviolent and disrespectful language, unbecoming the President,\r\nespecially, his foolish speech made on the 22nd of February, 1866,\r\nin which he selected particular persons as the objects of denunciation.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"I fought traitors and treason in the south.  I opposed the Davises,\r\nthe Toombses, the Slidells, and a long list of others, which you\r\ncan readily fill without my repeating the names.  Now, when I turn\r\nround, and at the other end of the line find men, I care not by\r\nwhat name you call them, who still stand opposed to the restoration\r\nof the Union of these states, I am free to say to you that I am\r\nstill in the field.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he said:\r\n\r\n\"I am called upon to name three at the other end of the line; I am\r\ntalking to my friends and fellow-citizens, who are interested with\r\nme in this government, and I presume I am free to mention to you\r\nthe names of those whom I look upon as being opposed to the\r\nfundamental principles of this government, and who are laboring to\r\npervert and destroy it.\"\r\n\r\nVoices:  \"Name them!\"  \"Who are they!\"\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\"You ask me who they are.  I say Thaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania,\r\nis one; I say Mr. Sumner, of the Senate, is another; and Wendell\r\nPhillips is another.\"\r\n\r\nThe violence of language, so unlike that of Abraham Lincoln, added\r\nto the hostility to Mr. Johnson in Congress, and, I think, more\r\nthan any other cause, led to his impeachment by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the controversy between Congress and the\r\nPresident, I tried to act as a peacemaker.  I knew Mr. Johnson\r\npersonally, his good and his bad qualities.  I sat by his side in\r\nthe Senate chamber during the first two years of the war.  I was\r\nwith him in his canvass in 1864.  I sympathized with him in his\r\nstruggles with the leaders of the Rebellion and admired his courage\r\nduring the war, when, as Governor of Tennessee, he reorganized that\r\nstate upon a loyal basis.  The defect of his character was his\r\nunreasoning pugnacity.  He early became involved in wordy warfare\r\nwith Sumner, Wade, Stevens and others.  In his high position he\r\ncould have disregarded criticism, but this was not the habit of\r\nJohnson.  When assailed he fought, and could be as violent and\r\ninsulting in language and acts as anyone.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I made a long and carefully considered\r\nspeech in the Senate on the 26th of February, 1866, in which I\r\nstated the position of Congress on the reconstruction measures,\r\nand the policy adopted by Johnson from Lincoln.  Either of these\r\nplans would have accomplished the provisional restoration of these\r\nstates to the Union, while all agreed that, when admitted, they\r\nwould be armed with all the powers of states, subject only to the\r\nconstitution of the United States.  I believed then, and believe\r\nnow, that the quarrel with Johnson did much to weaken the Republican\r\nparty.  In consequence of it several Republican Senators and Members\r\nsevered their connection with that party and joined the Democratic\r\nparty.  Johnson, irritated by this antagonism, drifted away from\r\nthe measures he had himself advocated and soon after was in open\r\nopposition to the party that elected him.  I here insert passages\r\nfrom my speech, which expressed my views at the time, and which I\r\nnow feel were justified by the then existing opinions and conditions\r\nof political life:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I can imagine no calamity more disgraceful than for us by\r\nour divisions to surrender, to men who to their country were enemies\r\nin war, any or all of the powers of this government.  He, who\r\ncontributes in any way to this result, deserves the execrations of\r\nhis countrymen.  This may be done by thrusting upon the President\r\nnew issues on which the well-known principles of his life do not\r\nagree with the judgment of his political associates.  It may be\r\ndone by irritating controversies of a personal character.  It may\r\nbe done by the President turning his back upon those who trusted\r\nhim with high power, and thus linking his name with one of the most\r\ndisgraceful in American history, that of John Tyler.  I feel an\r\nabiding confidence that Andrew Johnson will not and cannot do this;\r\nand, sir, who will deny that the overbearing and intolerant will\r\nof Henry Clay contributed very much to the defection of John Tyler?\r\nBut the division of the Whig party was an event utterly insignificant\r\nin comparison with the evil results of a division in the Union\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"Where will be the four million slaves whom by your policy you have\r\nemancipated?  What would be their miserable fate if now surrendered\r\nto the custody of the rebels of the south?  Will you, by your demand\r\nof universal suffrage, destroy the power of the Union party to\r\nprotect them in their dearly purchased liberty?  Will you, by new\r\nissues upon which you know you have not the voice of the people,\r\njeopard these rights which you can by the aid of the Union party\r\nsecure to these freedmen?  We know that the President can not and\r\nwill not unite with us upon the issues of universal suffrage and\r\ndead states, and he never agreed to.  No such dogmas were contemplated,\r\nwhen, for his heroic services in the cause of the Union, we placed\r\nhim, side by side, with Mr. Lincoln as our standard-bearer.  Why,\r\nthen, present these issues?  Why decide upon them?  Why not complete\r\nthe work so gloriously done by our soldiers in securing union and\r\nliberty to all men without distinction of color, leaving to the\r\nstates, as before, the question of suffrage.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the curse of God, the maledictions of millions of our people,\r\nand the tears and blood of new-made freedmen will, in my judgment,\r\nrest upon those who now for any cause destroy the unity of the\r\ngreat party that has led us through the wilderness of war.  We want\r\nnow peace and repose.  We must now look to our public credit.  We\r\nhave duties to perform to the business interests of the country,\r\nin which we need the assistance of the President.  We have every\r\nmotive for harmony with him and with each other, and for a generous\r\nand manly trust in his patriotism.  If ever the time shall come\r\nwhen I can no longer confide in his devotion to the principles upon\r\nwhich he was elected, I will bid farewell to Andrew Johnson with\r\nunaffected sorrow.  I will remember when he stood in this very\r\nspot, five years ago, repelling with unexampled courage the assaults\r\nof traitors.  He left in their hands wife, children, property, and\r\nhome, and staked them all on the result.  I will remember that when\r\na retreating general would have left Nashville to its fate, that\r\nagain, with heroic courage, he maintained his post.  I will remember\r\nthe fierce conflicts and trials through which he and his fellow-\r\ncompatriots in east Tennessee maintained our cause in the heart of\r\nthe Confederacy.  I will remember the struggles he had with the\r\naristocratic element of Tennessee, never ashamed of his origin and\r\nnever far from the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you must not sever the great Union party from this loyal\r\nelement of the southern states.  No new theories of possible utopian\r\ngood can compensate for the loss of such patriotism and devotion.\r\nTime, as he tells you in his message, is a great element of reform,\r\nand time is on your side.  I remember the homely and encouraging\r\nwords of a pioneer in the anti-slavery cause, an expelled Methodist\r\npreacher from the south, who told those who were behind him in his\r\nstrong anti-slavery opinions:  'Well, friends, I'll block up awhile;\r\nwe must all travel together.'  So I say to all who doubt Andrew\r\nJohnson, or who wish to move more rapidly than he can, to block up\r\nawhile, to consolidate their great victory with the certainty that\r\nreason and the Almighty will continue their work.  All wisdom will\r\nnot die with us.  The highest human wisdom is to do all the good\r\nyou can, but not to sacrifice a possible good to attempt the\r\nimpracticable.  God knows that I do not urge harmony and conciliation\r\nfrom any personal motive.  The people of my native state have\r\nintrusted me with a position here extending four years beyond the\r\ntermination of the President's term of office.  He can grant me no\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\"If I believed for a moment that he would seek an alliance with\r\nthose who, by either arms or counsel or even apathy, were against\r\ntheir country in the recent war, and will turn over to them the\r\nhigh powers intrusted to him by the Union party, then, sir, he is\r\ndishonored, and will receive no assistance from me; but I will not\r\nforce him into that attitude.  If he shall prove false to the\r\ndeclaration made by him in his veto message, that his strongest\r\ndesire was to secure to the freedmen the full enjoyment of their\r\nfreedom and property, then I will not quarrel with him as to the\r\nmeans used.  And while, as he tells us in this same message, he\r\nonly asks for states to be represented which are presented in an\r\nattitude of loyalty and harmony and in the persons of representatives\r\nwhose loyalty cannot be questioned under any constitutional or\r\nlegal test, surely we ought not to separate from him until, at\r\nleast, we prescribe a test of their loyalty, upon which we are\r\nwilling to stand.  We have not done it yet.  I will not try him by\r\nnew creeds.  I will not denounce him for hasty words uttered in\r\nrepelling personal affronts.\r\n\r\n\"I see him yet surrounded by the cabinet of Abraham Lincoln, pursuing\r\nLincoln's policy.  No word from me shall drive him into political\r\nfellowship with those who, when he was one of the moral heroes of\r\nthis war, denounced, spit upon him, and despitefully used him.\r\nThe association must be self-sought, and even then I will part with\r\nhim in sorrow, but with the abiding hope that the same Almighty\r\npower that has guided us through the recent war will be with us\r\nstill in our new difficulties until every state is restored to its\r\nfull communion and fellowship, and until our nation, purified by\r\nwar, will assume among the nations of the earth the grand position\r\nhoped for by Washington, Clay, Webster, Lincoln, and hundreds of\r\nthousands of unnamed heroes who gave up their lives for its glory.\"\r\n\r\nI received many letters in commendation of this speech, among others\r\nthe following from Thurlow Weed, who was in full sympathy with\r\nSecretary Seward:\r\n\r\n  \"Albany, N. Y., February 28, 1866.\r\n\"Dear Sherman:--You have spoken words of wisdom and patriotism--\r\nspoken them boldly at the right time.  They will help save the\r\nUnion--and they will save the Union particularly if fanatics and\r\ndespots will allow it to be saved.  Just such a speech at the moment\r\nit was made is worth more than all that has been said in Congress\r\nsince the session commenced.  I thank you gratefully for it.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"Thurlow Weed.\"\r\n\r\nI still hoped that the pending civil rights bill would be approved\r\nby the President, and that then the controversy would end.  On the\r\n17th of March, 1866, I made a speech at Bridgeport, Conn., in which\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, I say, that upon all these various propositions, upon the\r\nnecessity of a change in the basis of representation, upon the\r\nnecessity for protecting the negroes, upon this question of suffrage\r\n--upon all these questions that have arisen in our politics of\r\nlate, the differences between Andrew Johnson and Congress are not\r\nsuch as need excite the alarm of any patriotic citizen.  No, my\r\nfriends, we have a great duty to perform to our country.  Every\r\nman in public life now has a heavy responsibility resting upon him,\r\nin the discharge of which he is bound to follow the dictates of\r\nhis own conscience, given to him by Almighty God.  There are, there\r\nmust be, differences of opinion; God has so made us that we must\r\ndiffer; it is the established nature of the human mind to disagree.\r\nIt is only by discussion and comparison of views that the highest\r\nhuman wisdom is elicited.  Therefore, I say again, that no Union\r\nman need feel anxious or uneasy because of the differences between\r\nthe President and Congress.  Let me tell you, as the solemn conviction\r\nwith which I address you to-night, that Andrew Johnson never will\r\nthrow the power we have given him into the hands of the Copperhead\r\nparty of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"I have many reasons for this faith.  One is that no nomination\r\nhas ever been sent by Andrew Johnson to the Senate of the United\r\nStates of any man of that stripe of politics.  No flattery, no\r\ncajolery can draw him from that line.  He is a man who fights his\r\nown battles, and whether they are old friends or foes that assail\r\nhim he fights them with equal freedom and boldness, and sometimes,\r\nperhaps indiscreetly; but that is a fault of his character, which\r\nneed excite no uneasiness in the minds of the people.\r\n\r\n\"On Thursday, the day that I left Washington, we sent to him a bill\r\nwhich secures to all the colored population of the southern states\r\nequal rights before the law, the civil rights bill.  It declares\r\nthat no state shall exclude any man on account of his color from\r\nany of the natural rights which, by the Declaration of Independence,\r\nare declared to be inalienable; it provides that every man may sue\r\nand be sued, may plead and be impleaded, may acquire and hold\r\nproperty, may purchase, contract, sell and convey; all those rights\r\nare secured to the negro population.  That bill is now in the hands\r\nof the President.  If he sign it, it will be a solemn pledge of\r\nthe law-making power of the nation that the negroes shall have\r\nsecured to them all these natural and inalienable rights.  I believe\r\nthe President will sign it.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at the end of ten days the President sent to the\r\nSenate the civil rights bill, referred to, with his message vetoing\r\nit.  It passed both Houses with the requisite two-thirds majority,\r\nand thus became a law.  This veto was followed by other vetoes,\r\nand, practically, the President abandoned his party.  From this\r\ntime forth, I heartily joined with my political associates in the\r\nmeasures adopted to secure a loyal reorganization of the southern\r\nstates.  I was largely influenced by the harsh treatment of the\r\nfreedmen in the south under acts adopted by the reconstructed\r\nlegislatures.  The outrages of the Ku-Klux-Klan seemed to me to be\r\nso atrocious and wicked that the men who committed them were not\r\nonly unworthy to govern, but unfit to live.  The weakness of the\r\nposition of Congress in the controversy with Mr. Johnson, was, that\r\nit had furnished no plan of reconstruction and he was compelled to\r\nact upon the urgency of events.  Many efforts were made to provide\r\nlegislation to take the place of the proclamations and acts of the\r\nPresident, but a wide divergence of opinion in the Republican party\r\nmanifested itself, and no substantial progress was made until near\r\nthe close of the second session of the 39th Congress.  Several\r\nbills were then pending in each House to provide governments for\r\nthe insurrectionary states.  On the 13th of February, 1867, during\r\nthe short session, a bill with that title came from the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  It was manifest unless this bill could be acted\r\nupon, that, in the then condition of Congress, all legislation\r\nwould fail.  It was kept before the Senate and thoroughly debated.\r\nOn the 16th of February, after consultation with my political\r\ncolleagues, I moved a substitute for the House bill.  The fifth\r\nsection of this substitute embodied a comprehensive plan for the\r\norganization of the rebel states with provision for elections in\r\nsaid states, and the conditions required for their administration\r\nand restoration to the Union and the exercise by them of all the\r\npowers of states, and provided for the election of Senators and\r\nMembers of Congress.  In presenting this substitute, I briefly\r\nstated my reasons for it, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The principle of this bill is contained in the first two lines of\r\nthe preamble.  It is founded upon the proclamation of the President\r\nand Secretary of State made just after the assassination of President\r\nLincoln, in which they declared specifically that the Rebellion\r\nhad overthrown all civil governments in the insurrectionary states,\r\nand they proceeded by an executive mandate to create governments.\r\nThey were provisional in their character, and dependent for their\r\nvalidity solely upon the action of Congress.  These are propositions\r\nwhich it is not now necessary for me to demonstrate.  These\r\ngovernments have never been sanctioned by Congress, nor by the\r\npeople of the states where they exist.  Taking that proclamation\r\nand the acknowledged fact that the people of the southern states,\r\nthe loyal people, whites and blacks, are not protected in their\r\nrights, but that an unusual and extraordinary number of cases occur\r\nof violence, and murder, and wrong, I do think it is the duty of\r\nthe United States to protect these people in the enjoyment of\r\nsubstantial rights.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the first four sections of this substitute contain nothing\r\nbut what is the present law.  There is not a single thing in the\r\nfirst four sections that does not now exist by law.\r\n\r\n\"The first section authorizes the division of the rebel states into\r\nmilitary districts.  That is being done daily.\r\n\r\n\"The second section acknowledges that the President is the commanding\r\nofficer of the army, and it is made his duty to assign certain\r\nofficers to those districts.  That is clearly admitted to be right.\r\n\r\n\"The third section does no more than what the Supreme Court in\r\ntheir recent decision have decided could be done in a state in\r\ninsurrection.  The Supreme Court in their recent decisions, while\r\ndenying that a military tribunal could be organized in Indiana\r\nbecause it never had been in a state of insurrection, expressly\r\ndeclared that these tribunals might have been, and might now be,\r\norganized in insurrectionary states.  There is nothing in this\r\nthird section, in my judgment, that is not now and has not been\r\ndone every month within the last twelve months by the President of\r\nthe United States.  The orders of General Sickles, and many other\r\norders I might quote, have gone further in punishment of crime than\r\nthis section proposes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in regard to the fourth section, that is a limitation upon\r\nthe present law.  Under the present law many executions of military\r\ntribunals are summarily carried out.  This section requires all\r\nsentences of military tribunals which affect the liberty of the\r\ncitizen to be sent to the commanding officer of the district.  They\r\nmust be approved by the commanding officer of the district; and so\r\nfar as life is concerned the President may issue his order at any\r\nmoment now, or after this bill passes, directing that the military\r\ncommander of the district shall not enforce a sentence of death\r\nuntil it is submitted to him, because the military officer is a\r\nmere subordinate of the President, remaining there at the pleasure\r\nof the President.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing, therefore, in these sections, that ought to\r\nalarm the nerves of my friend from Pennsylvania, or anybody else.\r\nI cannot think that these gentlemen are alarmed about the state of\r\ndespotism that President Johnson is to establish in the southern\r\nstates.  I do not feel alarmed; nor do I see anything in these\r\nsections as they now stand that need endanger the rights of the\r\nmost timid citizen of the United States.  They are intended to\r\nprotect a race of people who are now without protection.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in regard to the fifth section, which is the main and material\r\nfeature of this bill, I think it is right that the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, before its adjournment, should designate some way\r\nby which the southern states may reorganize loyal state governments\r\nin harmony with the constitution and laws of the United States,\r\nand the sentiment of the people, and find their way back to these\r\nhalls.  My own judgment is that the fifth section will point out\r\na clear, easy, and right way for these states to be restored to\r\ntheir full power in the government.  All that it demands of the\r\npeople of the southern states is to extend to all their male\r\ncitizens, without distinction of race or color, the elective\r\nfranchise.  It is now too late in the day to be frightened by this\r\nsimple proposition.  Senators can make the most of it as a political\r\nproposition.  Upon that we are prepared to meet them.  But it does\r\npoint out a way by which the twenty absent Senators, and the fifty\r\nabsent Representatives can get back to these halls, and there is\r\nno other way by which they can justly do it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that this is the whole substance of the bill.  All\r\nthere is material in the bill is in the first two lines of the\r\npreamble and the fifth section, in my judgment.  The first two\r\nlines may lay the foundation adopting the proclamation issued first\r\nin North Carolina, that the Rebellion had swept away all the civil\r\ngovernments in the southern states; and the fifth section points\r\nout the mode by which the people of those states in their own\r\nmanner, without any limitations or restrictions by Congress, may\r\nget back full representation in Congress.  That is the view I take\r\nof this amended bill; and taking that view of it I see no reason\r\nin the world why we should not all vote for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe substitute was adopted on the same day and the bill, thus\r\namended, was passed by a vote of yeas 29, nays 10.  In the House\r\nit was agreed to with slight amendments, which were finally concurred\r\nin by the Senate, on February 20, 1867.  It was sent to the President\r\nand was not approved by him, but was, on the 2nd of March, passed\r\nover his veto by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses.\r\n\r\nUpon the law, long deferred, the several states mentioned in it\r\nwere organized and restored to their place in the Union.  The\r\npreamble and fifth and sixth sections of this law are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"An Act to Provide for the More Efficient Government of the Rebel\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, no legal state governments or adequate protection for\r\nlife or property now exists in the rebel states of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,\r\nFlorida, Texas, and Arkansas; and whereas it is necessary that\r\npeace and good order should be enforced in said states until loyal\r\nand republican state governments can be legally established:\r\nTherefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled:_ . . .\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 5.  _And be it further enacted_, That when the people of any\r\none of said rebel states shall have formed a constitution of\r\ngovernment in conformity with the constitution of the United States\r\nin all respects, framed by a convention of delegates elected by\r\nthe male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and upward,\r\nof whatever race, color, or previous condition, who have been\r\nresident in said state for one year previous to the day of such\r\nelection, except such as may be disfranchised for participation in\r\nthe Rebellion, or for felony at common law, and when such constitution\r\nshall provide that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed by all\r\nsuch persons as have the qualifications herein stated for electors\r\nof delegates, and when such constitution shall be ratified by a\r\nmajority of the persons voting on the question of ratification who\r\nare qualified as electors for delegates, and when such constitution\r\nshall have been submitted to Congress for examination and approval,\r\nand Congress shall have approved the same, and when said state, by\r\na vote of its legislature, elected under such conditions, shall\r\nhave adopted the amendment to the constitution of the United States,\r\nproposed by the 39th Congress, and known as article fourteen, and\r\nwhen said article shall have become a part of the constitution of\r\nthe United States, said state shall be declared entitled to\r\nrepresentation in Congress, and Senators and Representatives shall\r\nbe admitted therefrom on their taking the oath prescribed by law,\r\nand then and thereafter the preceding sections of this act shall\r\nbe inoperative in said state:  _Provided_, That no person excluded\r\nfrom the privilege of holding office by said proposed amendment to\r\nthe constitution of the United States shall be eligible to election\r\nas a member of the convention to frame a constitution for any of\r\nsaid rebel states, nor shall any such person vote for members of\r\nsuch convention.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 6.  _And be it further enacted_, That, until the people of\r\nsaid rebel states shall be by law admitted to representation in\r\nthe Congress of the United States, any civil government which may\r\nexist therein shall be deemed provisional only, and in all respects\r\nsubject to the paramount authority of the United States at any time\r\nto abolish, modify, control, or supersede the same; and in all\r\nelections to any office under such provisional governments all\r\npersons shall be entitled to vote, and none others, who are entitled\r\nto vote, under the provisions of the fifth section of this act;\r\nand no person shall be eligible to any office under any such\r\nprovisional governments who would be disqualified from holding\r\noffice under the provisions of the third article of said constitutional\r\namendment.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the financial question, embracing the currency,\r\nthe public debt and the national revenue were of the highest\r\nimportance and demanded immediate consideration.  Hugh McCulloch,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, had been during most of his life a\r\nbanker in the State of Indiana, of acknowledged ability as such,\r\nbut with little or no experience as a financier dealing with public\r\nquestions.  He was the first comptroller of the currency under the\r\nbanking act, and rendered valuable service in organizing the system\r\nof national banks, though he had not originally favored the system,\r\nbut was, at the time of its adoption, a strong supporter of sound\r\nstate banks.  In his first report to Congress on the 4th of December,\r\n1865, he, as Secretary of the Treasury, took strong ground against\r\nUnited States notes as a circulating medium and their being made\r\na legal tender as money.  He regarded the legal tender acts as war\r\nmeasures, and, while he did not recommend their repeal, he expressed\r\nhis opinion that they ought not to remain in force one day longer\r\nthan would be necessary to enable the people to prepare for a return\r\nto the constitutional currency.  He denied the authority of Congress\r\nto issue these notes except in the nature of a loan, and affirmed\r\nthat the statute making them a legal tender for all debts, public\r\nand private, was not within the scope of the duties or the\r\nconstitutional powers of Congress; that their issue as lawful money\r\nwas a measure necessary in a great emergency, but, as this emergency\r\ndid not then exist, the government should, as speedily as possible,\r\nwithdraw them, and he recommended that the work of retiring the\r\nnotes should be commenced without delay and carefully and persistently\r\ncontinued until all were retired.  He proposed to do this by the\r\nsale of bonds for United States notes outstanding and their withdrawal\r\nand cancellation.  He recommended as a substitute the notes of\r\nnational banks, but even these notes he thought redundant, and said:\r\n\r\n\"There is no fact more manifest that the plethora of paper money\r\nis not only undermining the morals of the people by encouraging\r\nwaste and extravagance, but is striking at the root of our material\r\nprosperity by diminishing labor . . . and if not speedily checked,\r\nwill, at no distant day, culminate in widespread disaster.  The\r\nremedy, and the only remedy within the control of Congress, is, in\r\nthe opinion of the secretary, to be found in the reduction of the\r\ncurrency.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief part of his report was devoted to the danger of inflation\r\nand the necessity of contraction.  He said the longer contraction\r\nwas delayed the greater must the fall eventually be, and the more\r\nserious its consequences.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the recommendations of Secretary McCulloch, a\r\nbill was introduced in the House by Justin S. Morrill, which\r\nauthorized the Secretary of the Treasury, at his discretion, to\r\nsell any of the description of bonds authorized by the act of March\r\n3, 1865, the proceeds to be used only to retire treasury notes or\r\nother obligations issued under any act of Congress.  This bill as\r\nreported would have placed in the power of the secretary the\r\nretirement of all United States notes at his discretion.  An\r\namendment was made in the House which provided:\r\n\r\n\"That of United States notes not more than ten millions of dollars\r\nmay be retired and canceled within six months from the passage of\r\nthis act, and thereafter not more than four millions of dollars in\r\nany one month.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill as it came to the Senate was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"An act to amend an act entitled 'An act to provide ways and means\r\nto support the government,' approved March third, eighteen hundred\r\nand sixty-five.\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That the act\r\nentitled 'An act to provide ways and means to support the government,'\r\napproved March third, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, shall be\r\nextended and construed to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nat his discretion, to receive any treasury notes or other obligations\r\nissued under any act of Congress, whether bearing interest or not,\r\nin exchange for any description of bonds authorized by the act to\r\nwhich this is an amendment; and also to dispose of any description\r\nof bonds authorized by said act, either in the United States or\r\nelsewhere, to such an amount, in such manner, and at such rates,\r\nas he may think advisable, for lawful money of the United States,\r\nor for any treasury notes, certificates of indebtedness, or\r\ncertificates of deposit, or other representatives of value, which\r\nhave been or which may be issued under any act of Congress, the\r\nproceeds thereof to be used only for retiring treasury notes or\r\nother obligations issued under any act of Congress; but nothing\r\nherein contained shall be construed to authorize any increase of\r\nthe public debt:  _Provided_, That of United States notes not more\r\nthan ten millions of dollars may be retired and canceled within\r\nsix months from the passage of this act, and thereafter not more\r\nthan four millions of dollars in any one month:  _And provided\r\nfurther_, That the act to which this is an amendment shall continue\r\nin full force in all its provisions, except as modified by this act.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  _And be it further enacted_, That the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury shall report to Congress at the commencement of the next\r\nsession the amount of exchanges made or money borrowed under this\r\nact, and of whom and on what terms; and also the amount and character\r\nof indebtedness retired under this act, and the act to which this\r\nis an amendment, with a detailed statement of the expense of making\r\nsuch loans and exchanges.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill, without change, became a law April 12, 1866.  I believed\r\nthen, and now know, that the passage of this law was a great\r\nmisfortune.  It enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to retire at\r\na rapid rate United States notes and to largely increase the bonded\r\nindebtedness of the United States.  It would no doubt have brought\r\nus abruptly to the specie standard and made us dependent for\r\ncirculating notes upon the issues of national banks.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was a wide difference of opinion between Secretary\r\nMcCulloch and myself as to the financial policy of the government\r\nin respect to the public debt and the currency.  He was in favor\r\nof a rapid contraction of the currency by funding it into interest\r\nbearing bonds.  I was in favor of maintaining in circulation the\r\nthen existing volume of currency as an aid to the funding of all\r\nforms of interest-bearing securities into bonds redeemable within\r\na brief period at the pleasure of the United States, and bearing\r\nas low a rate of interest as possible.  Both of us were in favor\r\nof specie payments, he by contraction and I by the gradual advancement\r\nof the credit and value of our currency to the specie standard.\r\nWith him specie payments was the primary object, with me it was a\r\nsecondary object, to follow the advancing credit of the government.\r\nEach of us was in favor of the payment of the interest of bonds in\r\ncoin, and the principal, when due, in coin.  A large proportion of\r\nnational securities were payable in lawful money, or United States\r\nnotes.  He, by contraction, would have made this payment more\r\ndifficult, while I, by retaining the notes in existence, would\r\ninduce the holders of currency certificates to convert them into\r\ncoin obligations bearing a lower rate of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nINDEBTEDNESS OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1865.\r\nOrganization of the Greenback Party--Total Debt on October 31st\r\namounts to $2,805,549,437.55--Secretary McCulloch's Desire to\r\nConvert All United States Notes into Interest Bearing Bonds--My\r\nDiscussion with Senator Fessenden Over the Finance Committee's Bill\r\n--Too Great Powers Conferred on the Secretary of the Treasury--His\r\nDesire to Retire $10,000,000 of United States Notes Each Month--\r\nGrowth of the Greenback Party--The Secretary's Powers to Reduce\r\nthe Currency by Retiring or Canceling United States Notes is\r\nSuspended--Bill to Reduce Taxes and Provide Internal Revenue--My\r\nTrip to Laramie and Other Western Forts with General Sherman--\r\nBeginning of the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nDuring this period a party sprang up composed of men of all parties\r\ncalled the Greenback party, who favored an increase of United States\r\nnotes, and the payment of all United States bonds and securities\r\nin such notes.  This difference of opinion continued until the\r\nresumption of specie payments, in January, 1879.\r\n\r\nI propose to state here the measures adopted in respect to the\r\nnational currency and debt during the rest of the administration\r\nof President Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe total debt of the United States on the 31st of October, 1865,\r\nwas $2,808,549,437.55 in twenty-five different forms of indebtedness\r\nof which, $1,200,000,000 was payable at the option of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, or within a brief period.  The amount of United\r\nStates notes outstanding was then $428,160,569, and of fractional\r\ncurrency $26,057,469, in all $545,218,038.  All of this money was\r\nin active circulation, in great favor among the people, worth in\r\nuse as much as national bank notes, and rapidly rising in value\r\ncompared with coin.  It was the least burdensome form of indebtedness\r\nthen existing.  The treasury notes and compound interest notes were\r\nin express terms payable in this lawful money, and, therefore, bore\r\na higher rate of interest than the bonds, which, by their express\r\nterms or necessary implication, were payable in coin only.\r\n\r\nIt was insisted that the amount of United States notes was in excess\r\nof what was needed for currency in time of peace and might safely\r\nbe gradually reduced.  This effort to contract the currency was\r\nfirmly resisted by several Senators, myself among them.  The Supreme\r\nCourt decided that Congress had full power to make these notes a\r\nlegal tender.  They were far better than any form of currency\r\npreviously existing in the United States.  During the war, when\r\nthe expenditures of the government reached nearly $1,000,000,000\r\na year they were indispensable.  Those most opposed to irredeemable\r\npaper money acknowledged this necessity.  The only objection to\r\nthem was that they were not equivalent to coin in purchasing power.\r\nAfter the war was over, the general desire of all was to advance\r\nthese notes nearer to par with coin, but not to withdraw them.\r\nThe rising credit and financial strength of the United States would,\r\nit was believed, bring them to par without injustice to the debtor,\r\nbut the rapid withdrawal of the notes would add to the burden of\r\ndebts and cripple all forms of industry.  It would convert the\r\ncompound interest notes and treasury notes bearing seven and three\r\ntenths per cent. interest, amounting to over $1,000,000,000 expressly\r\npayable in United States notes, into coin liabilities.  The bill\r\nprepared at the treasury department contemplated the conversion of\r\nall United States notes into bonds.  In that form the bill was\r\ndefeated in the House of Representatives, but it was reconsidered\r\nand an amendment was then made limiting the retirement of notes to\r\n$4,000,000 a month.  This gained for the bill enough votes to secure\r\nits passage.  Even the withdrawal of $48,000,000 a year was soon\r\nfound to be oppressive and was subsequently repealed.\r\n\r\nWhen this bill came before the committee on finance, I found myself\r\nalone in opposition to it.  I could not impress my colleagues of\r\nthe committee with the grave importance of the measure, and its\r\nwide-reaching influence upon our currency, debt and credit.  They\r\nregarded it simply as a bill to change the form of our securities.\r\nI felt confident that without the use of United States notes we\r\ncould not make this exchange.  When the bill was brought before\r\nthe Senate by Mr. Fessenden, chairman of the committee, he made no\r\nstatement of its terms, but only said:\r\n\r\n\"I have merely to say that this bill is reported by the committee\r\non finance without amendment as it came from the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  The committee on finance, on careful examination\r\nof it, came to the conclusion that the bill was well enough as it\r\nstood, and did not deem it advisable to make any amendment.  It\r\nhas been before the Senate a considerable time, and I presume every\r\nSenator understands it.  I ask, therefore, for the question.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"I regret very much that I differ from the committee on finance in\r\nregard to this bill.  This is the only bill on the subject of the\r\npublic debt on which I have not been able to concur with that\r\ncommittee. . . .\r\n\r\n\"If Senators will read this bill they will find that it confers on\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury greater powers than have ever been\r\nconferred, since the foundation of this government, upon any\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  Our loan laws, heretofore, have generally\r\nbeen confined to the negotiation of a single loan, limited in\r\namount.  As the war progressed, the difficulties of the country\r\nbecame greater, and we were more in the habit of removing the\r\nlimitations on the power of the Secretary of the Treasury; but\r\ngenerally the power conferred was confined to a particular loan\r\nthen in the market.  This bill, however, is more general in its\r\nterms.  This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to sell\r\nany character of bonds without limit, except as to the rate of\r\ninterest.  The authority conferred does not limit him to any form\r\nof security.  It may run for any period of time within forty years.\r\nHe may sell the securities at less than par, without limitation as\r\nto rate.  He may sell them in any form he chooses.  He may put them\r\nin the form of treasury notes or bonds, the interest payable in\r\ngold or in paper money.  He may undertake, under the provisions of\r\nthis bill, to fund the whole debt of the United States.  The only\r\nlimit as to amount is the public debt, now $2,700,000,000.  The\r\npower conferred on the Secretary of the Treasury is absolute.  It\r\nis not only for this year, or during the current fiscal year, or\r\nfor the next year, but it is for all time, until the act shall be\r\nrepealed.  It gives him absolute power to negotiate bonds of the\r\nUnited States to the amount of $2,700,000,000, without limiting\r\nthe rate at which they shall be sold, and only limiting the rate\r\nof interest inferentially.  The description of the bonds in the\r\nact of March 3, 1865, referred to here, would probably limit the\r\nrate of interest to six per cent. in coin, and seven and three-\r\ntenths per cent. in currency; but with this exception there is no\r\nlimitation.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that in the present condition of our finances there\r\nis no necessity for conferring these large powers on the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury.  The people are not generally aware of the favorable\r\ncondition of our finances.  The statement of the public debt laid\r\non our tables the other day does not show fully the condition of\r\nthe finances.  It is accurate in amounts, but does not give dates\r\nof the maturity of our debts.  But a small portion of the debt of\r\nthe United States will be due prior to August, 1867, that will give\r\nthe secretary any trouble.  But little of the debt which he will\r\nbe required to fund under the provisions of this bill matures before\r\nAugust, 1867.  The temporary or call loan, now over one hundred\r\nmillions, may readily be kept at this sum even at a reduced rate\r\nof interest.  The certificates of indebtedness, amounting to sixty-\r\ntwo millions, may easily be paid from accruing receipts, or, if\r\nnecessary, may be renewed or funded at the pleasure of the secretary.\r\nNone of the compound interest notes or the seven-thirty notes mature\r\nuntil August, 1867. . . .\r\n\r\n\"There is, therefore, no immediate necessity for these vast powers.\r\nThe question then naturally occurs, why grant them?  I have carefully\r\nconsidered this question, and I do not think there is now any\r\nimmediate necessity for granting these powers.  No debt is maturing\r\nthat is likely to give the government any trouble; and yet we are\r\nnow about to confer upon the Secretary of the Treasury, powers that\r\nwe cannot, in the nature of things, recall.  It is true we may\r\nrepeal this law next year, but we know very well that when these\r\nlarge powers are granted they are very seldom recalled; they are\r\nmade the precedents of further grants of powers and are very rarely\r\nrecalled.  It seems to me that the whole object of the passage of\r\nthis bill is to place it within the power of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to contract the currency of the country, and thus, as I\r\nthink, to produce an unnecessary strain upon the people.  This\r\npower I do not think ought to be given to him.  The House of\r\nRepresentatives did not intend to give him this power.  They debated\r\nthe bill a long time, and it was defeated on the ground that they\r\nwould not confer on the secretary this power to reduce the currency,\r\nand finally it was only passed with a proviso contained in the bill\r\nwhich I will now read:\r\n\r\n'_Provided_, That of United States notes not more than $10,000,000\r\nmay be retired and canceled within six months from the passage of\r\nthis act, and thereafter not more than $4,000,000 in any one month.'\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of the House of Representatives was, while giving the\r\nsecretary power to fund the debt as it matured or even before\r\nmaturity, giving him the most ample power over the debt of the\r\nUnited States, to limit his power over the currency, lest he might\r\ncarry to an extreme the view presented by him in his annual report.\r\nIf this proviso would accomplish the purpose designed by the House\r\nof Representatives, I would cease all opposition to this bill; but\r\nI know it will not, and for the very obvious reason, that there is\r\nno restraint upon the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\naccumulate legal tender notes in the treasury.  He may retire\r\n$200,000,000 of legal tender notes by retaining them in his possession\r\nwithout cancellation, and thus accomplish the very purpose the\r\nHouse of Representatives did not intend to allow him to accomplish.\r\nHe may sell the bonds of the United States, at any rate he chooses,\r\nfor legal tenders, and he may hold those legal tenders in his\r\nvaults, thus retiring them from the business of the country, and\r\nthus produce the very contraction which the House of Representatives\r\nmeant to deny him power to do.  Therefore, this proviso, which only\r\nlimits the power of canceling securities or notes, does not limit\r\nhis power over the currency, and he may, without violating this\r\nbill, in pursuance of the very terms of this bill, contract the\r\ncurrency according to his own good will and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"My own impression is, that the Secretary of the Treasury, in\r\ncarrying out his own policy, will do so.  He says he will not\r\ncontract it unreasonably or too rapidly, but I believe he will\r\ncontract the currency in this way.  He has now in the vaults of\r\nthe treasury $60,000,000 in currency and $62,000,000 in gold--a\r\nlarger balance, I believe, than was ever before kept in the treasury\r\nuntil within the last two or three months; a larger balance than\r\nwas ever found in the treasury during the war.  What is the object\r\nof accumulating these vast balances in the treasury?  Simply to\r\ncarry out his policy of contraction.  With this power of retaining\r\nin the treasury the money that comes in, what does he care for the\r\nlimitation put upon this bill by the House of Representatives?\r\nThat says that he shall not retire and cancel more than $10,000,000\r\nof United States notes within six months, and not more than $4,000,000\r\nin any one month thereafter; but why need he retire and cancel them\r\nwhen he can retain them in the vaults of the treasury, and thus\r\ncontract the currency? . . .\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt in the least either the integrity or the capacity\r\nof the present incumbent of the treasury department.  I have as\r\nmuch confidence in him as anyone; but this question of the currency\r\nis one that affects so intimately all the business relations of\r\nlife, the property of every man in this country, his ability to\r\npay taxes, his ability to earn food and acquire a living, that no\r\nman ought to have the power to vary the volume of currency.  It\r\nought to be regulated by law, and the law ought to be so fixed and\r\nso defined that every business man may transact his business with\r\nfull knowledge of the amount of the currency, with all its limits\r\nand qualifications.  I ask you, sir, how any prudent or judicious\r\nman can now engage in any important business, in which he is\r\ncompelled to go into debt, with this large power hanging over him.\r\nIt would be unsafe for him to do so.  The amount of the currency\r\nought to be fixed by law, whether much or little.  There ought to\r\nbe a limit, and no man ought to have the power at pleasure to\r\nenlarge or contract that limit. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Then there is the further power to reduce the currency, a power\r\nthat has not heretofore been granted to any Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  The amount heretofore has been fixed and limited by law.\r\nBy the first clause of this bill the secretary is authorized to\r\nreceive treasury notes, or United States notes of any form or\r\ndescription, and there is no limitation to this power, except the\r\nclause which I have read to you.  That limits his power to retire\r\nand cancel the United States notes, but not to accumulate the\r\nenormous balances on hand.  My own impression has been, and when\r\nthis bill was before the committee on finance I believed, it would\r\nbe better for that committee to report to the Senate a financial\r\nproject to fund the debt of the United States.  I believe that now\r\nis the favorable time to do it.  If a five per cent. bond, a long\r\nbond of proper description and proper guarantee, was now placed\r\nupon the market, with such ample powers to negotiate it as ought\r\nto be given to the Secretary of the Treasury, such a loan as was\r\nauthorized two years ago, at a reduced rate of interest, to be\r\nexempt from taxation, I have no doubt whatever, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury could fund every portion of the debt of the United\r\nStates as it matured. . . .\r\n\r\n\"I do not like to embarrass a bill of this kind with amendments,\r\nbecause I know it is difficult to consider amendments of this sort,\r\nrequiring an examination of figures and tables.  I have prepared\r\na bill very carefully, with a view to meet my idea, but I will not\r\npresent it now in antagonism to this bill passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the view taken by the finance committee, because\r\nI know, in the present condition of the Senate, it would not probably\r\nbe fully considered.  My only purpose now is to point out the fact\r\nthat is perfectly clear to the mind of every sensible man who has\r\nexamined this bill, that the bill as it stands does not carry out\r\nthe manifest intention of the House of Representatives when they\r\npassed it, and that the proviso, limiting the power of the secretary\r\nover the legal tender currency, does not accomplish the purpose\r\nwhich they designed, and without which I know the bill never could\r\nhave passed the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden:  \"If the House of Representatives did not understand\r\nwhat they were doing when they passed this bill, it arises from\r\nthe fact that they did not give the rein to their imagination, as\r\nthe honorable Senator from Ohio seems to have done to his, and take\r\nit for granted that the Secretary of the Treasury had a purpose to\r\naccomplish, and that he would not hesitate to take any means in\r\nhis power to accomplish it, improperly against the manifest will\r\nof Congress, against the interests of the country, and against his\r\nown interests as Secretary of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the Senator whether that is a fair statement of my\r\nargument?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden:  \"That is the way precisely that I understand it.\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely as no gentleman could have understood me.  I\r\nnever said that the secretary improperly would do so and so by any\r\nmeans.  It is one of the honorable Senator's modes of stating\r\npropositions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden:  \"I certainly did not mean to say that the honorable\r\nSenator supposed he designed to do so, but such seems to be the\r\nresult of his argument--that the Secretary of the Treasury having\r\nthe power, as he says, there is danger that he might abuse it in\r\nthat precise way; else his argument amounts to nothing at all as\r\nagainst the bill.  I certainly acquit my friend of any sort of\r\ndesire or intention to throw any imputation on the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.  That he did not mean to do. . . .\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not think it wise to confer on the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nthe power to meet the indebtedness not accruing for a year, or two,\r\nor three years.  I do not think it is necessary, in our present\r\nfinancial condition, to authorize him to go into market now and\r\nsell bonds at current market rates with a view to pay debts that\r\ndo not mature for a year or two.  I have no doubt before the five-\r\ntwenty loans are due we shall retire every dollar of them at four\r\nor five per cent. interest.  No one who heeds the rapid developments\r\nof new sources of wealth in this country, the enormous yield of\r\ngold now, the renewal of industry in the south, the enormous yield\r\nof cotton, the growing wealth of this country, and all the favorable\r\nprospects that are before us, doubts the ability of this government\r\nbefore this debt matures to reduce it to four or five per cent.\r\ninterest. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary of the Treasury may sell bonds at any rate to meet\r\ndebts as they accrue, but that is not the purpose of this bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden:  \"That is all the purpose there is in it.\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Then there is no necessity for it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden:  \"Yes, there is.  I differ from you.\"\r\n\r\nI continued:\r\n\r\n\"We have here the tables before us.  The honorable Senator and I\r\nknow when this debt matures. . . .\r\n\r\n\"That is the power now given, and he will use the power.  He may\r\nthink it to his interest to retire the whole of the seven-thirties\r\nor the ten-forties; but is it wise for us to give him that power\r\nnow, at the heel of the war and before things have settled down?\r\nI do not think it is.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat, I do not wish to call in question the integrity of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  The Senator interjects by saying we\r\nmust look ahead.  I have done so.  The difference between us is\r\nthat I anticipate that the future of this country will be hopeful,\r\nbuoyant, joyous.  We shall not have to beg money of foreign nations,\r\nor even of our own people, within two or three years.  Our national\r\ndebt will be eagerly sought for, I have no doubt.  I take a hopeful\r\nview of the future.  I do not wish now to cripple the industry of\r\nthe country by adopting the policy of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nas he calls it, by reducing the currency, by crippling the operations\r\nof the government, when I think that under any probability of\r\naffairs in the future, all this debt will take care of itself.  I\r\nbelieve that if the Secretary of the Treasury would do nothing in\r\nthe world except simply sit in his chair, meet the accruing\r\nindebtedness, and issue his treasury warrants, this debt will take\r\ncare of itself, and will fund itself at four or five per cent.\r\nbefore very long.  All that I object to in this bill is the power\r\nit gives the Secretary of the Treasury over the currency, to affect\r\nthe currency of the country now and to anticipate debts that are\r\nnot yet due. . . .\r\n\r\n\"That is what I am afraid of, his interference to contract the\r\ncurrency.  The honorable Senator from Maine, however, would seem\r\nto think that I impute to him a wrong motive, and therefore I\r\ncorrected him when he made the remark that I seemed to suppose the\r\nsecretary was doing this improperly.  I think not.  The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury informed us that he desired to reduce the currency,\r\nand he has been doing it as far as he could.  He has been accumulating\r\nlarge balances.  He was opposed to the proviso which has been\r\ninserted in this bill, and yielded to it only with reluctance.\r\nThat is admitted on all hands, and he is not precluded either in\r\nhonor or propriety from carrying out his policy if you gave him\r\nthe power to do it.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill became a law on the 12th of April, 1866.  President\r\nJohnson relied entirely upon McCulloch, and had no opinions upon\r\nfinancial topics.\r\n\r\nNow, nearly thirty years after the passage of this act, it is\r\nmanifest that it was far the most injurious and expensive financial\r\nmeasure ever enacted by Congress.  It not only compelled the United\r\nStates to pay the large war rates of interest for many years, but\r\npostponed specie payments until 1879.  It added fully $300,000,000\r\nof interest that might have been saved by the earlier refunding of\r\noutstanding bonds into bonds bearing four or five per cent. interest.\r\nMr. Fessenden, then chairman of the committee on finance, committed\r\na grave error in hastily supporting the bill, an error which I\r\nbelieve he greatly regretted and which, in connection with his\r\nfailing health, no doubt led him to resign his position as chairman\r\nof that committee.  Although our debate was rather sharp, it did\r\nnot disturb our friendly relations.  With McCulloch in the treasury\r\ndepartment, nothing could be done.\r\n\r\nIf the funding clauses of this act had been limited to the conversion\r\nof compound interest notes, treasury notes bearing interest,\r\ncertificates of indebtedness, and temporary loans into bonds\r\nredeemable at the pleasure of the United States after a brief time,\r\nbearing not exceeding five per cent. interest, retaining in\r\ncirculation during this process of refunding all the then outstanding\r\nUnited States notes, the result would have been greatly beneficial\r\nto the United States, but this was not the chief object of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  His primary object was to convert United\r\nStates notes into interest-bearing bonds, and thus force the\r\nimmediate resumption of specie payments or the substitution of\r\nnational bank notes for United States notes.  The result of his\r\nrefunding was largely to increase the amount of six per cent. bonds,\r\nthe most burdensome form of security then outstanding.  In October,\r\n1865, the amount of six per cent. bonds was $920,000,000; on the\r\n1st of July, 1868, the six per cent. bonds outstanding were\r\n$1,557,844,600.  The increase of these bonds under the operation\r\nof this law was thus over $637,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe result of this policy of contraction was not only to increase\r\nthe burden of the public debt, but it created serious derangement\r\nof the business of the country.  It excited a strong popular\r\nopposition to the measures adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback party, as it was called, grew out of this policy of\r\ncontraction, and for a time threatened to carry the election of a\r\nmajority of the Members of Congress.  It contended practically for\r\nan unlimited issue of legal tender United States notes, and the\r\npayment of all bonds and securities in United States notes.  This,\r\nhowever, did not disturb Secretary McCulloch.  In his annual report\r\nof December 3, 1866, he again urged the policy of a further reduction\r\nof United States notes.  He was not satisfied with the reduction\r\nalready provided for, and recommended that the reduction should be\r\nincreased from $4,000,000 a month, as contemplated by the act of\r\nApril 12, 1866, to $6,000,000 a month for the fiscal year, and to\r\n$10,000,000 a month thereafter.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"The _policy_ of contracting the circulation of the government\r\nnotes should be definitely and unchangeably established, and the\r\n_process_ should go on just as rapidly as possible without producing\r\na financial crisis or seriously embarrassing those branches of\r\nindustry and trade upon which our revenues are dependent.  That\r\nthe policy indicated is the true and safe one, the secretary is\r\nthoroughly convinced.  If it shall not be speedily adopted and\r\nrigidly, but judiciously, enforced, severe financial troubles are\r\nin store for us.\"\r\n\r\nHe insisted that the circulation of the country should be further\r\nreduced, not by compelling the national banks to retire their notes,\r\nbut by the withdrawal of United States notes.  When reminded of\r\nthe great saving of interest in the issue of $400,000,000 United\r\nStates notes, he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Considerations of this nature are more than counterbalanced by\r\nthe discredit which attaches to the government by failing to pay\r\nits notes according to their tenor, by the bad influence of this\r\ninvoluntary discredit upon the public morals, and the wide departure,\r\nwhich a continued issue of legal tender notes involves, from the\r\npast usages, if not from the teachings of the constitution itself.\"\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"The government cannot exercise powers not conferred by its organic\r\nlaw or necessary for its own preservation, nor dishonor its own\r\nengagements when able to meet them, without either shocking or\r\ndemoralizing the sentiment of the people; and the fact that the\r\nindefinite continuance of the circulation of an inconvertible but\r\nstill legal tender currency is so generally advocated indicates\r\nhow far we have wandered from old landmarks both in finance and in\r\nethics.\"\r\n\r\nThe growing opposition of the people at large to the contraction\r\nof the currency seemed to have no effect upon his mind.\r\n\r\nHe again recurs to the same subject in his annual report to Congress,\r\nin December, 1867.  After stating that the United States notes,\r\nincluding fractional currency, had been reduced from $459,000,000\r\nto $387,000,000, and the funded debt had been increased $684,548,800,\r\nhe urged as a measure regarded by him as important, if not\r\nindispensable for national prosperity, the funding or payment of\r\nthe balance of interest-bearing notes, and a continued contraction\r\nof the paper currency.  He urged that the acts authorizing legal\r\ntender notes be repealed, and that the work of retiring the notes\r\nwhich had been issued under them should be commenced without delay,\r\nand carefully and persistently continued until all were retired.\r\n\r\nThis policy of contraction, honestly entertained and persistently\r\nurged by Secretary McCulloch in spite of growing stringency, led\r\nCongress, by the act of February 4, 1868, to suspend indefinitely\r\nthe authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to make any reduction\r\nof the currency by retiring or canceling United States notes.\r\n\r\nWho can doubt that if he had availed himself of the power given\r\nhim to refund the interest-bearing notes and certificates of the\r\nUnited States into bonds bearing a low rate of interest, leaving\r\nthe United States notes bearing no interest to circulate as money,\r\nhe would have saved the government hundreds of millions of dollars?\r\nIf irredeemable notes were a national dishonor, why did he not urge\r\ntheir redemption in coin at some fixed period and then reissue\r\nthem, and maintain their redemption by a reserve in coin?\r\n\r\nThe act of February 25, 1862, under which the original United States\r\nnotes were issued, provided that:\r\n\r\n\"Such United States notes shall be received the same as coin, at\r\ntheir par value, in payment for any loans that may be hereafter\r\nsold or negotiated by the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be\r\nreissued from time to time as the exigencies of the public interest\r\nshall require.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision would have maintained the parity of United States\r\nnotes at par with bonds, but under the pressure of war it was deemed\r\nbest by Congress, upon the recommendation of Secretary Chase, to\r\ntake from the holder of United States notes the right to present\r\nthem in payment for bonds after the first day of July, 1863.  If\r\nthis privilege, conferred originally upon United States notes, had\r\nbeen renewed in 1866, with the right of reissue, bonds and notes\r\nwould together have advanced to par in coin.  But this is what the\r\ncontractionists especially opposed.  They demanded the cancellation\r\nof the notes when presented, a contraction of the currency when\r\noffering our bonds.  It is easy now to perceive that a conservative\r\nuse of United States notes, convertible into four per cent. bonds,\r\nwould have steadily advanced both notes and bonds to par in coin.\r\nBut the equally erroneous opposing opinions of contractionists and\r\nexpansionists delayed for many years the coming of coin resumption\r\nupon a fixed quantity of United States notes.\r\n\r\nAmong the acts of this Congress of chief importance is the act\r\napproved July 13, 1866, to reduce taxes and provide internal revenue.\r\nThe passage of such an act required much labor in both Houses, but\r\nespecially so in the House of Representatives, where tax bills must\r\noriginate.  It was a compromise measure, and, unlike previous acts,\r\ndid not reach out for new objects of taxation, but selected such\r\narticles as could bear it best, and on some of these the tax was\r\nincreased.  A great number of articles that enter into the common\r\nconsumption of the people and are classed as necessities of life\r\nwere relieved from taxation.  The general purpose of the bill was\r\nin time to concentrate internal taxes on such articles as spirits,\r\ntobacco and beer.  The tax on incomes was continued but limited to\r\nthe 30th of June, 1870.  I have already stated the marked development\r\nof internal taxation, and this measure was one of the most important\r\nin the series to produce great revenue at the least cost, and of\r\nthe lightest burden to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the act, approved April 12, 1866, to\r\ncontract the currency, I introduced a bill, \"To reduce the rate of\r\ninterest on the national debt and for funding the same.\"  In view\r\nof the passage of that act I did not expect that a funding bill\r\nwould meet with success, but considered it my duty to present one,\r\nand on the 22nd of May, 1866, made a speech in support of it.  The\r\nbill provided for the voluntary exchange of any of the outstanding\r\nobligations of the United States for a bond running thirty years,\r\nbut redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after ten years\r\nfrom date, bearing interest at the rate of five per cent., payable\r\nannually.  On reading that speech now I find that, though I was\r\nmuch more confident than others of converting our maturing securities\r\ninto five per cent. bonds, the general opinion then prevailing,\r\nand acted upon by the Secretary of the Treasury, was to issue six\r\nper cent. bonds as already stated.  I soon found that it was idle\r\nto press the funding bill upon Congress, when it was so much occupied\r\nwith reconstruction and with Andrew Johnson.  The refunding and\r\nmany other measures had to be postponed until a new administration\r\ncame into power.  Congress had unfortunately authorized the issue\r\nof six per cent. bonds for accruing liabilities, and thus postponed\r\nrefunding at a lower rate of interest.\r\n\r\nThe long and exciting session of Congress that ended on the 28th\r\nday of July, 1866, left me in feeble strength and much discouraged\r\nwith the state of affairs.  I had arranged with General Sherman to\r\naccompany him in an official inspection of army posts on the western\r\nplains, but did not feel at liberty to leave Washington until\r\nCongress adjourned.  The letter I wrote him on the 8th of July\r\nexpresses my feelings as to the political situation at that time:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate Chamber,}\r\n  \"Washington, July 8, 1866.    }\r\n\"Dear Brother:--It is now wise for you to avoid all expressions of\r\npolitical opinion.  Congress and the President are now drifting\r\nfrom each other into open warfare.  Congress is not weak in what\r\nit has done, but in _what it has failed to do_.  It has adopted no\r\nunwise or extreme measures.  The civil rights bill and constitutional\r\namendments can be defended as reasonable, moderate, and in harmony\r\nwith Johnson's old position and yours.  As Congress has thus far\r\nfailed to provide measures to allow legal Senators and Representatives\r\nto take their seats, it has failed in a plain duty.  This is its\r\nweakness, but even in this it will have the sympathy of the most\r\nof the soldiers, and the people who are not too eager to secure\r\nrebel political power.  As to the President, he is becoming Tylerized.\r\nHe was elected by the Union party for his openly expressed radical\r\nsentiments, and now he seeks to rend to pieces this party.  There\r\nis a sentiment among the people that this is dishonor.  It looks\r\nso to me.  What Johnson is, is from and by the Union party.  He\r\nnow deserts it and betrays it.  He may varnish it up, but, after\r\nall, he must admit that he disappoints the reasonable expectations\r\nof those who intrusted him with power.  He may, by a coalition with\r\ncopperheads and rebels, succeed, but the simple fact that nine-\r\ntenths of them who voted for him do not agree with him, and that\r\nhe only controls the other tenth by power intrusted to him by the\r\nUnion party, will damn him forever.  Besides, he is insincere; he\r\nhas deceived and misled his best friends.  I know he led many to\r\nbelieve he would agree to the civil rights bill, and nearly all\r\nwho conversed with him until within a few days believed he would\r\nacquiesce in the amendments, and even aid in securing their adoption.\r\nI almost fear he contemplates civil war.  Under those circumstances\r\nyou, Grant and Thomas ought to be clear of political complications.\r\nAs for myself, I intend to stick to finance, but wherever I can I\r\nwill moderate the actions of the Union party, and favor conciliation\r\nand restoration.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment I proceeded to St. Louis, and with General\r\nSherman and two staff officers, went by rail to Omaha.  This handsome\r\ncity had made great progress since my former visit.  We then went\r\nby the Central Pacific railroad to Fort Kearney, as far as the\r\nrails were then laid.  There our little party started through the\r\nIndian Territory, riding in light wagons with canvas covers, each\r\ndrawn by two good army mules, escorted by a squad of mounted\r\nsoldiers.  We traveled about thirty miles a day, camping at night,\r\nsleeping in our wagons, turned into ambulances, the soldiers under\r\nshelter tents on blankets and the horses parked near by.  The camp\r\nwas guarded by sentinels at night, and the troopers lay with their\r\nguns close at hand.  Almost every day we met Indians, but none that\r\nappeared to be hostile.  In this way we traveled to Fort Laramie.\r\nThe country traversed was an unbroken wilderness, in a state of\r\nnature, but singularly beautiful as a landscape.  It was an open\r\nprairie, traversed by what was called the North Platte River, with\r\nscarcely water enough in it to be called a creek, with rolling\r\nhills on either side, and above, a clear sky, and air pure and\r\nbracing.  It was the first time I had been so far out on the plains,\r\nand I enjoyed it beyond expression.  I was soon able to eat my full\r\nshare of the plain fare of bread and meat, and wanted more.\r\n\r\nAfter many days we reached Fort Laramie, then an important post\r\nfar out beyond the frontier.  We remained but a few days, and then,\r\nfollowing south along the foot hills, we crossed into the Laramie\r\nplains to Fort Sanders.  This was the last post to the west in\r\nGeneral Sherman's command.  From thence we followed the course of\r\nthe Cache la Poudre.  On the way we camped near a station of the\r\nOverland Stage Company, for change of horses and for meals, in a\r\ncharming and picturesque region.  The keeper of the station soon\r\ncalled and inquired for me, and I found that he was a former resident\r\nof Mansfield, who married the daughter of an old friend.  He invited\r\nour party to his house, and there I met his wife, who, in this\r\nregion without any neighbors or habitations near, seemed to be\r\nperfectly happy and fearless, though often disturbed by threatened\r\nIndian outbreaks.  We were handsomely entertained.  It was a great\r\nrelief to sleep one night in a comfortable bed, after sleeping for\r\nmany nights with two in a narrow wagon.  We then proceeded to\r\nGreeley, where we found a small settlement of farmers.  From thence\r\nto Denver, we found a few cabins scattered over a vast open plain\r\nstretching as far as the eye could reach to the east, with the\r\nmountains on the west rising in grandeur and apparently presenting\r\nan insurmountable barrier.  I have seen many landscapes since that\r\nwere more bold and striking, but this combination of great mountains\r\nand vast plains, side by side, made an impression on my mind as\r\nlasting as any natural landscape I have seen.\r\n\r\nAt Denver, General Sherman and I were handsomely entertained by\r\nthe citizens, many of whom General Sherman knew as soldiers under\r\nhis command during the war, and some of whom I knew as former\r\nresidents of Ohio.  They were enthusiastic in their praise of\r\nColorado.  It seemed to me the air was charged with a superabundance\r\nof ozone, for everyone was so hopeful of the future of Denver, that\r\neven the want of rain did not discourage them and some of them\r\ntried to convince me that irrigation from the mountains was better\r\nthan showers from the sky.  Denver was then a town of less than\r\n5,000 inhabitants and now contains more than 110,000.  Colorado\r\nhad less than 50,000 inhabitants in 1870, and in 1890 it had 412,198,\r\nan increase of nearly ten fold in twenty years.  But this marvelous\r\ngrowth does not spring from the invigorating air and flowing springs\r\nof Colorado, but from the precious metals stored in untold quantities\r\nin her mountains.  From Denver General Sherman had to continue his\r\ninspection to the southern posts, and I was called home to take\r\npart in the pending canvass.  I started in a coach peculiar to the\r\ncountry, with three or four passengers, over a distance of about\r\nfour hundred miles to Fort Riley, in Kansas.  We had heard of many\r\nIndian forays on the line we were to travel over and there was some\r\ndanger, but it was the only way to get home.  Each of the passengers,\r\nI among the number, had a good Winchester rifle, with plenty of\r\nammunition.  The coach was a crude rattle-trap, noisy and rough,\r\nbut strong and well adapted to the journey.  It was drawn by four\r\nhorses of the country, small but wiry.  We had long reaches between\r\nchanges.  The stations for meals had means of defense, and the food\r\nset before us was substantial, mainly buffalo beef, chickens and\r\nbread.  A good appetite (always a sure thing on the plains) was\r\nthe best sauce for a substantial meal, and all the meals were\r\ndinners with no change of courses.  We saw on the way many evidences\r\nof Indian depredations, one of which was quite recent, and two or\r\nthree settlers had been killed.  We met no Indians on the way, but\r\nwe did meet myriads of buffaloes, scattered in vast herds to the\r\nnorth and south of us as far as the eye could reach.  It is sad to\r\nreflect that all these animals have been exterminated, mainly in\r\nwanton sport by hunters who did not need their flesh for food or\r\ntheir hides for leather or robes.  This destruction of buffaloes\r\nopened the way for herds of domestic cattle, which perhaps in equal\r\nnumbers now feed upon the native grass of the prairies.\r\n\r\nIn a recent visit to western Nebraska and South Dakota, I saw these\r\ncattle in great numbers in good condition, cheaply cared for and\r\nsold for four cents a pound on the hoof.  The owners of these cattle\r\npurchased land from settlers who had acquired title under the\r\nhomestead or pre-emption laws, as suitable sites for ranches,\r\nincluding a permanent lake or pond for each, an indispensable\r\nrequisite for a ranch.  This being secured, they built houses to\r\nlive in and sheds for the protection of their cattle in winter,\r\nand thus obtained practical possession, without cost or taxes, of\r\nall the government land needed for their ranges.  Sad experience\r\nhas convinced settlers in all the vast rainless region of the west,\r\nthat they cannot produce grain with any certainty of harvesting a\r\ncrop, and thousands who have made the experiment in western Kansas\r\nand Nebraska and in eastern Colorado and Wyoming have recently\r\nabandoned their improvements and their claims.  It seems now that\r\nthis part of our country must be given up to the herders of cattle.\r\nThe Indians and buffaloes have disappeared and the \"cowboys\" and\r\ndomestic cattle and horses have taken their place, to give way, no\r\ndoubt, in time, to the farmer, when the water will be drawn from\r\nthe earth by artesian wells, and life and vitality will thus be\r\ngiven to a soil as rich as the Kansas valley.\r\n\r\nWe reached the end of our stage ride at Fort Riley, and were glad\r\nto enter into the cars of the Kansas Pacific railroad, though they\r\nwere as dirty and filthy as cars could well be.  All this has been\r\nchanged.  Now the ride over the plains from Kansas City to Denver\r\ncan be made, in a comparatively few hours, in comfort and safety.\r\n\r\nI returned to Ohio to take my usual part in the canvass in the fall\r\nof 1866, and returned to Washington in time for the meeting of\r\nCongress on the first Monday in December.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1862 but little attention was given by Congress to the\r\ngreatest and most important industry of mankind, that of agriculture.\r\nThis is especially true of the United States, where the majority\r\nof its inhabitants are engaged in farming.  Agriculture has furnished\r\nthe great body of our exports, yet this employment had no representative\r\nin any of the departments except a clerk in the Patent Office.\r\nThe privileges granted by that bureau to inventors had no relation\r\nto work on the farm, though farming was greatly aided by invention\r\nof farm implements during the period of the war, when a million of\r\nmen were drawn from their occupations into the army.  This anomaly\r\nled to the passage, on the 15th of May, 1862, of the act to establish\r\nthe department of agriculture.  Though called a department its\r\nchief officer was a commissioner of agriculture, who was not for\r\nmany years a member of the cabinet.  The first commissioner, Isaac\r\nNewton, appointed by Lincoln, was a peculiar character, a Quaker\r\nof Philadelphia, a gardener rather than a farmer, but he was an\r\nearnest and active officer.  The appropriations for his department\r\nwere very small, but enabled him to distribute valuable seeds and\r\ncuttings, which were in great demand and of real service to farmers.\r\nI early took an active part in promoting his efforts and especially\r\nin producing him appropriations and land where he could test his\r\nexperiments.  He applied for authority to use that portion of\r\nReservation No. 2 between 12th and 14th streets of the mall in\r\nWashington, then an unsightly waste without tree or shrub, but he\r\nwas notified that the use of it was essentially necessary to the\r\nwar department as a cattle yard.  When the war was over Congress\r\nappropriated it for the use of his department.  He took possession\r\nof it about the middle of April, 1865, and, though the ground was\r\nan unbroken soil of tenacious clay, he fertilized and pulverized\r\na part of it and planted a great variety of seeds for propagation,\r\nand covered the remaining portions of it with grass and cereals.\r\nHis reports increased in interest and were in great demand.  His\r\noffice work was done in inconvenient parts of the Patent Office,\r\nand the necessity of better accommodations was constantly pressed\r\nupon Members of Congress.  I took an active interest in the subject,\r\nand offered an amendment to the civil appropriation bill to\r\nappropriate $100,000 for a suitable building for the department of\r\nagriculture on the reservation mentioned.  There was a disposition\r\nin the Senate to ridicule Newton and his seeds, and Mr. Fessenden\r\nopposed the appropriation as one for an object not within the\r\nconstitutional power of Congress.  The amendment, however, was\r\nadopted on the 28th day of February, 1867.  Newton died on the 19th\r\nof June of that year, but on the 22nd of August, John W. Stokes,\r\nas acting commissioner, entered into a contract for the erection\r\nof the building, and Horace Capron, as commissioner, completed the\r\nwork within the limits of his appropriation, a rare result in the\r\nconstruction of a public building.  The building is admirably\r\nadapted for the purposes designed.  The unsightly reservation has\r\nbeen converted by Mr. Capron and his successors in office into one\r\nof the most beautiful parks in Washington.  The department of\r\nagriculture is now represented in the cabinet, and in practical\r\nusefulness to the country is equal to any of the departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nTHREE MONTHS IN EUROPE.\r\nShort Session of Congress Convened March 4, 1867--I Become Chairman\r\nof the Committee on Finance, Succeeding Senator Fessenden--Departure\r\nfor Europe--Winning a Wager from a Sea Captain--Congressman Kasson's\r\nPistol--Under Surveillance by English Officers--Impressions of John\r\nBright, Disraeli and Other Prominent Englishmen--Visit to France,\r\nBelgium, Holland and Germany--An Audience with Bismarck--His Sympathy\r\nwith the Union Cause--Wonders of the Paris Exposition--Life in\r\nParis--Presented to the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie\r\n--A Dinner at the Tuileries--My Return Home--International Money\r\nCommission in Session at Paris--Correspondence with Commissioner\r\nRuggles--His Report--Failure to Unify the Coinage of Nations--\r\nRelative Value of Gold and Silver.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of the 39th Congress the relations between\r\nPresident Johnson and Congress became such that it was deemed\r\nadvisable to provide by law for a session of the new Congress on\r\nthe 4th of March, 1867, that being the commencement of the term\r\nfor which the Members were elected.\r\n\r\nThe law, in my opinion, ought to be a permanent one, so that the\r\nwill of the people, as evidenced by the elections, may be promptly\r\nresponded to.  But such was not the purpose of this act.  The reason\r\nwas that, under the claim of authority made by the President, there\r\nwas a fear that he might recognize the states in insurrection before\r\nthey had complied with the conditions prescribed by law for\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this law the 40th Congress met on the day named.\r\n\r\nI took the oath as Senator, my colleague, Benjamin F. Wade, president\r\n_pro tem._ of the Senate, administering it.  I became chairman of\r\nthe committee on finance by the voluntary retirement of Mr. Fessenden.\r\nI knew this had been his purpose during the session just closed.\r\nHe complained of his health, and that the confinement and labor of\r\nthe position he held added to his infirmity.  At the same time it\r\nwas agreed that the duties of the committee should be divided by\r\nreferring all appropriations to a committee on appropriations, and\r\nI was to choose between the two committees.  The House of\r\nRepresentatives had already divided the labors of the committee of\r\nways and means, a corresponding committee to that on finance, among\r\nseveral committees, and the experiment had proved a success.  I\r\npreferred the committee on finance, and remained its chairman until\r\nI became Secretary of the Treasury.  Mr. Fessenden took the easy\r\nand pleasant position of chairman of the committee on public\r\nbuildings and grounds, and held that position until he died in\r\nSeptember, 1869.  I have already expressed my opinion of his\r\nremarkable ability as a debater and as a statesman of broad and\r\nconservative views.  His only fault was a hasty temper too often\r\ndisplayed, but as often regretted by him.\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned on the 30th of March, to meet again on the 3rd\r\nof July.  The Senate was called to a special session by proclamation\r\nof the President on the 1st day of April, 1867.  It remained in\r\nsession until the 20th of April and then adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\nI did not remain until the close of the session, but about the 10th\r\nof April sailed from New York for Europe in the steamer \"City of\r\nAntwerp.\"  I went for needed rest, a change of air and scene, and\r\nhad in view, as one of the attractions of the voyage, a visit to\r\nthe exposition at Paris in that year.  My associates on the ocean\r\nwere Colonel Morrow, United States Army, and John A. Kasson, Member\r\nof Congress from Iowa, and we remained together until I left London.\r\n\r\nI had no plan, route or business, except to go where I drifted with\r\nsuch companions as I met.  The only limitation as to time was the\r\nduty of returning to meet the adjourned session of the Senate in\r\nJuly.  I have no memoranda in respect to the voyage and preserved\r\nno letters about it.  Still, the principal scenes and events are\r\nimpressed on my mind and I will narrate them as I now recall them.\r\n\r\nThe passage on the ocean was a favorable one.  We had some rain\r\nbut no winds that disturbed my digestion.  But few on the vessel\r\nwere seasick, and these mainly so from imagination.  The captain,\r\nwhose name I do not recall, was a jolly Englishman, but a careful,\r\nprudent and intelligent officer.  I sat by his side at his table.\r\nAfter leaving port we soon took our places at table for our first\r\nmeal on board.  He inquired of me if I was a good sailor.  I told\r\nhim I would be as regular in my attendance at meals as he.  He\r\nlaughed and said he would like to wager some wine on that.  I\r\ncheerfully accepted his bet, and, true to my promise, I did not\r\nmiss a meal during the voyage, while he three or four times remained\r\nat his post on deck when the air was filled with fog or the waves\r\nwere high.  He paid the bet near the end of the voyage, and a number\r\nof his passengers, including Morrow and Kasson, shared in the treat.\r\n\r\nI can imagine no life more pleasing than a tranquil, but not too\r\ntranquil, sea, with a good ship well manned, with companions you\r\nlike, but not too many.  The quiet and rest, the view of the ocean,\r\nthe sense of solitude, the possibility of danger, all these broken\r\na little by a quiet game of whist or an interesting book--this I\r\ncall happiness.  All these I remember to have enjoyed on this, my\r\nfifth trip on the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn due time we arrived at Queenstown in Ireland.  It was about the\r\ntime a party of Irishmen, in some town in England rescued some of\r\ntheir countrymen from a van in charge of English constables, one\r\nor more of whom were killed or wounded.  Morrow, Kasson and I\r\nconcluded we would spend a few days in \"Ould Ireland.\"  Morrow and\r\nKasson believed they were of Irish descent, though remotely so as\r\ntheir ancestors \"fought in the Revolution.\"  We remained in and\r\nabout Cork for two or three days.  We visited and kissed the Blarney\r\nStone, saw the Lakes of Killarney, and drove or walked about the\r\ninteresting environs of Cork and Queenstown.  We sought no acquaintance\r\nwith anyone.\r\n\r\nWe were all about the age of forty, physically sound, and both\r\nMorrow and Kasson had the military air and step of soldiers.  We\r\nsoon became conscious that we were under surveillance.  One day an\r\nofficer called at our lodgings and frankly told us that there was\r\nso much excitement about Fenian disturbances in England, and such\r\npolitical ferment in Ireland, that an examination of the baggage\r\nof passengers was required and he wished to examine ours.  I told\r\nhim who we were, and introduced him to Morrow and Kasson, and\r\noffered my trunk for inspection.  They did the same, Kasson producing\r\nalso a small pistol from his valise.  The officer had heard of that\r\npistol.  Kasson had fired it at the birds hovering about the vessel.\r\nThis had been reported to the police.  The officer took the pistol\r\nand it was returned to Kasson some days after at Dublin.  Morrow\r\nridiculed the pistol and told the officer that Kasson could not\r\nhit or hurt him at ten paces away, but the officer was only half\r\nsatisfied.  We soon after went to Dublin, but we felt that we were\r\nunder suspicion.  All Americans were then suspected of sympathizing\r\nwith the Irish.  We told our consul at Dublin of our adventures at\r\nCork, and he said we were lucky in not being arrested.  We went to\r\na steeple chase a few miles from Dublin, where gentlemen rode their\r\nown horses over a long and difficult route, leaping barriers and\r\ncrossing streams.  We enjoyed the scene very much and mingled freely\r\nin the great crowd, but always feeling that we were watched.  The\r\nnext day we started to cross the channel to Holyhead.\r\n\r\nWe took the steamer at Dublin Bay and found aboard a large company\r\nof well-dressed passengers, such as we would find on a summer\r\nexcursion from New York.  Morrow, who was a handsome man of pleasing\r\nmanners and address, said he could pick out Americans from the\r\ncrowd.  I doubted it.  He said:  \"There is an American,\" pointing\r\nout a large, well-built man, who seemed to be known by the passengers\r\naround him.  I said he was an Englishman.  Morrow stepped up to\r\nhim and politely said that he had a wager with a friend that he\r\nwas an American.  \"Not by a d----d sight,\" replied the Englishman.\r\nMorrow apologized for the intrusion, but the gentleman changed his\r\ntone and said that his abrupt answer was caused by a letter he had\r\nlately received from a nephew of his whom he had sent to America\r\nto make his fortune.  His nephew had written him now that the rebels\r\nwere put down, the next thing to do would be to put down \"old\r\nEngland.\"  Morrow said there was too much of that kind of gasconade\r\nin America, and that after our desperate struggle at home we would\r\nnot be likely to engage in one with England.\r\n\r\nWe arrived safely in London.  In my first visit in 1859, with my\r\nwife, we were sight-seers.  Now I sought to form acquaintance with\r\nmen whose names were household words in all parts of the United\r\nStates.  By the courtesy of our consul general at Liverpool, Thomas\r\nH. Dudley, I met John Bright, Disraeli, and many others less\r\nconspicuous in public life.  I have already mentioned my breakfast\r\nwith Gladstone during this visit.  Mr. Dudley, then in London,\r\ninvited Mr. Bright to a dinner as his principal guest.  Of all the\r\nmen I met in London, Mr. Bright impressed me most favorably.  Finely\r\nformed physically, he was also mentally strong.  He was frank and\r\nfree in his talk and had none of the hesitation or reserve common\r\nwith Englishmen.  He was familiar with our war and had no timidity\r\nin the expression of his sympathy for the Union cause.  If we ever\r\nerect a monument to an Englishman, it should be to John Bright.\r\nI heard Disraeli speak in the House of Commons and was introduced\r\nto him at a reception at Lord Stanley's.  In the ten days I spent\r\nin London I saw as much of social life as could be crowded into\r\nthat time.  Charles Francis Adams was then United States minister\r\nat London, and I am indebted to him for many acts of kindness.\r\nWhen we were Members of the House of Representatives together he\r\nhad the reputation of being cold and reserved and he was not popular\r\nwith his fellow Members, but in London he was distinguished for\r\nhis hospitality to Americans.  He certainly was very kind to me,\r\nentertaining me at dinner and taking pains to introduce me to many\r\npeers and members whose names were familiar to me.  While receptions\r\nare very common in London during the session, the Englishman prefers\r\ndinners as a mode of entertainment.  It is then he really enjoys\r\nhimself and gives pleasure to his guests.  The sessions of parliament,\r\nhowever, interfere greatly with dinners.  The great debates occur\r\nduring dining hours, so that, as Mr. Adams informed me, it was\r\ndifficult to arrange a dinner that would not be broken up somewhat\r\nby an unexpected debate, or a division in the House of Commons.\r\nThe precedence of rank had to be carefully observed.  The unsocial\r\nhabit of not introducing guests to each other tended to restrain\r\nconversation and make the dinner dull and heavy.  Still the forms\r\nand usages in social life in London are much like those in Washington.\r\nBut here the ordinary sessions of each House of Congress terminate\r\nbefore six o'clock, leaving the evening hours for recreation.\r\n\r\nThe presidential mansion is the natural resort of all who visit\r\nWashington.  The doors are always open to visitors at stated hours,\r\nand the President is easy of access to all who call at such hours.\r\nFormerly presidential receptions were open to all comers, and the\r\nresult was a motley crowd, who formed in line and shook hands with\r\nthe President, bowed to the attending ladies, passed into the great\r\neast room and gradually dispersed.  In late years these receptions\r\nhave become less frequent, and in their place we have had diplomatic,\r\nmilitary and navy, and congressional receptions, for which invitations\r\nare issued.  During the usual period before Lent card receptions\r\nare given by the cabinet, by many Senators and Members, and by\r\ncitizens, for which invitations are issued.  I know of no place\r\nwhere the entrance into society is so open and free as in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nFrom London I went, by way of Dieppe and Rouen, to Paris, where my\r\nfirst call was on General Dix and his family.  Next I visited the\r\nexposition, and wandered through and about and around it.  I have\r\nattended many exhibitions, but never one before or since that\r\ncombined such magnitude and completeness in size, form and location,\r\nand such simplicity in arrangement and details, as the Paris\r\nExposition of 1867.  I spent ten days in this inspection, and in\r\nwalking and driving around Paris and its environs.  Through the\r\nkindness of General Dix, then envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary, I received invitations to many meetings and\r\nreceptions given by Mayor Haussman and other officers of the French\r\ngovernment to visitors from abroad connected with the exposition.\r\nI accepted some of them, but purposely postponed this social part\r\nof my visit until I returned from Berlin.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris I went to Antwerp via Brussels.  At this latter place\r\nI met Doctor John Wilson, then United States consul at Antwerp.\r\nHe was an old friend at Washington, where he served during the\r\ngreater part of the war as an army surgeon.  He was a man of\r\nremarkable intelligence, familiar with nearly every part of Europe,\r\nand especially with France, Belgium and Prussia.  He readily\r\nacquiesced in my invitation to accompany me to Berlin.  On the\r\ninvitation of Henry S. Sanford, our minister to Brussels, I returned\r\nto that city, and met at dinner the principal officers of Belgium,\r\nsuch as we designate cabinet ministers.  I drove with Mr. Sanford\r\nto Waterloo and other famous historic places in and about that\r\nbeautiful city.\r\n\r\nFrom Brussels we went to the Hague, where General Hugh Ewing, a\r\nbrother-in-law of General Sherman, was United States minister.\r\nAfter a brief stay in Holland, General Ewing, Doctor Wilson and\r\nmyself went to Berlin.  Prussia was then a kingdom of rising power,\r\nand Berlin was a growing city, but not at all the Berlin of to-day.\r\nBismarck was recognized as a great statesman and, although far less\r\nprominent than he afterwards became, he was the one man in Germany\r\nwhom I desired to see or know.  Mr. Joseph A. Wright, late United\r\nStates minister at Berlin, had recently died, and his son, John C.\r\nWright, who was in charge of the legation, had no difficulty in\r\nsecuring me an audience with Bismarck, accompanying me to the\r\nofficial residence, where I was introduced to him.  Bismarck spoke\r\nEnglish with a German accent, but was easily understood.  When I\r\nspoke of recent events in Europe he would turn the conversation to\r\nthe United States, asking me many questions about the war and the\r\nprincipal generals in the opposing armies.  He was in thorough\r\nsympathy with the Union cause, and emphatically said that every\r\nman in Prussia, from the king to his humblest subject, was on the\r\nside of the Union, and opposed to the Rebellion.  What a pity, he\r\nsaid, it would have been if so great a country as the United States\r\nhad been disrupted on account of slavery.  I mentioned my visit to\r\nthe international fair at Paris and my intention to return, and he\r\nsaid he would be there.\r\n\r\nThis interview, which lasted, perhaps, forty minutes, was as informal\r\nand frank as the usual conversation of friends.  Bismarck was then\r\nin full health and strength, about fifty years old, more than six\r\nfeet high, and a fine specimen of vigorous manhood in its prime.\r\n\r\nI found the same feeling for the United States expressed by a\r\npopular meeting in the great exposition hall in Berlin.  Our little\r\nparty was escorted to this place on Sunday afternoon by Mr. Kreismann,\r\nour consul at Berlin.  As we entered the hall, Mr. Kreismann advanced\r\nto the orchestra, composed of several military bands, and said\r\nsomething to the leader.  When we took our seats at one of the\r\nnumerous tables he told me to pay attention after the first item\r\nof the second part of the programme before me, and I would hear\r\nsomething that would please me.  At the time stated, a young man\r\nadvanced to the front of the stage, with a violin in his hand, and\r\nplayed exquisitely the air \"_Yankee Doodle Is the Tune_,\" and soon\r\nafter the entire band joined in, filling the great hall with American\r\nmusic.  The intelligent German audience, many of whom knew the\r\nnational airs of all countries, realized at once that this addition\r\nto the programme was a compliment to the Americans.  They soon\r\nlocated our little party and then rose, and fully two thousand\r\npersons, men, women and children, waved their handkerchiefs and\r\nshouted for America.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in favor of the United States was then strong in all\r\nparts of Europe, except in France and England.  In these countries\r\nit was somewhat divided--in France by the failure of Maximilian,\r\nand in England by the rivalry of trade, and sympathy with the south.\r\nGenerally, in referring in Europe to the people of the United\r\nStates, the people speak of us as Americans, while those of other\r\nparts of America are Canadians, Mexicans, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant week in Berlin I went by way of Frankfort, Wiesbaden\r\nand Cologne to Paris.  The exposition was then in full operation.\r\nIt may be that greater numbers attended the recent exposition at\r\nChicago, but, great as was its success, I think, for symmetry, for\r\nplans of buildings, and arrangement of exhibits, the fair at Paris\r\nwas better than that at Chicago.  The French people are well adapted\r\nfor such exhibits.  The city of Paris is itself a good show.  Its\r\npeople almost live out of doors six months of the year.  They are\r\nquick, mercurial, tasteful and economical.  A Frenchman will live\r\nwell on one-half of what is consumed or wasted by an American.  I\r\ndo not propose to describe the wonderful collection of the productions\r\nof nature or the works of men, but I wish to convey some idea of\r\nlife in Paris during the thirty days I spent in it.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon Bonaparte was then Emperor of the French, and Haussman\r\nwas mayor of the city of Paris.  General Dix, as before stated,\r\nwas United States minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary\r\nat the court of France.  Upon my arrival, I hired what in Paris is\r\ncalled an apartment, but which includes several rooms, comprising\r\ntogether a comfortable residence.  Many similar apartments may be\r\nin the same building, but with them you need have no communication,\r\nand you are detached from them as fully as if each apartment was\r\na separate house.  The concierge, generally a woman, takes charge\r\nof your room, orders your breakfast if you require one, and keeps\r\nthe key of your apartment when you are absent.  It is a charming\r\nmode of living.  You can dine or lunch when you will, and are master\r\nof your time and your apartment.  I employed a neat, light carriage\r\nand one horse, with a driver who knew a smattering of several\r\nlanguages, and found him trusty and faithful--all this at a cost\r\nthat would disgust the ordinary hotel proprietor in the United\r\nStates, and especially the hack driver of any of our cities.  This,\r\nin Paris, was the usual outfit of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dix advised me on whom and when and how I should make my\r\ncalls.  My card in the usual form announced that I was \"Sénateur\r\ndes États Unis d'Amérique.\"  A Parisian could not pronounce my name.\r\nThe best he could do was to call me \"Monsieur le Sénateur.\"  With\r\na few words of French I acquired, and the imperfect knowledge of\r\nEnglish possessed by most French people, I had no difficulty in\r\nmaking my way in any company.  I received many invitations I could\r\nnot accept.  I attended a reception at the Palais Royal, the\r\nresidence of the mayor, dressed in the ordinary garb for evening\r\nparties, a dress coat and trousers extending to the knees, and\r\nbelow black silk stockings and pumps.  I felt very uncomfortable\r\nin this dress when I entered the reception room, but, as I found\r\nevery gentleman in the same dress, we become reconciled to it.\r\nSubsequently I attended a reception at the Tuileries, at which I\r\nwas presented by General Dix to the emperor and empress.\r\n\r\nOne feature of this presentation I shall always remember.  The\r\ngeneral company had been gathered in the great hall.  The diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives of many countries were formed in line according to\r\ntheir rank, attended by the persons to be presented.  Soon a door\r\nwas opened from an adjoining room and the Emperor of the French,\r\nescorting, I think, the Empress of Russia, passed along the line\r\nand saluted the ambassadors and ministers in their order, and the\r\nladies and gentlemen to be presented were introduced by name to\r\nthe emperor.  General Dix presented Fernando Wood, of New York,\r\nand myself.  Following the French emperor came the Emperor of Russia\r\nescorting the Empress Eugenie of France, and the same mention of\r\nour names was made to her.  Following them came kings, the Prince\r\nof Wales and others of like rank, each accompanied by distinguished\r\npeers of his country.  Third or fourth in this order came the King\r\nof Prussia, Prince Bismarck, and General Von Moltke.  When Bismarck\r\npassed he shook hands with Dix and recognized me with a bow and a\r\nfew words.  If the leaders in this pageant could have foreseen what\r\nhappened three years later--that King William would be an emperor,\r\nthat Bonaparte would be his prisoner and Eugenie a refugee from\r\nrepublican France--the order of the march would have been reversed.\r\n\r\nSoon after this reception, I was invited by the emperor to attend,\r\nwith General Dix and his daughter, a dinner at the Tuileries.  Such\r\nan invitation is held to be in the nature of a command.  I accompanied\r\nthem, and was agreeably surprised to find that the dinner was quite\r\ninformal, though more than forty sat at table.  When I entered the\r\nroom one of the ladies in waiting came to me and introduced me to\r\na lady whom I was to escort to the table.  Presently she returned\r\nand said:  \"Oh, I understand monsieur does not speak French, and\r\nmarquise does not speak English.  Will monsieur allow me to be a\r\nsubstitute?\"  I agreed with great pleasure.  Both the guests and\r\nthe hosts were promptly on time.  I was introduced to the emperor\r\nand empress.  She was very gracious to her guests, passing from\r\none to another with a kindly word to all.  I noticed her greeting\r\nto Miss Dix was very cordial.  The emperor engaged in a conversation\r\nwith me that continued until the dinner was announced,--fully ten\r\nminutes.  He asked many questions about the war, and especially\r\nabout General Sherman.  I answered his questions as I would to any\r\ngentleman, but felt uneasy lest I was occupying time that he should\r\nbestow on others.  General Dix was by my side, and encouraged the\r\nconversation.  When the dinner was announced each guest knew his\r\nplace from the card furnished him, and the party was seated without\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nI need not say that the young lady I escorted was a charming woman.\r\nI did not learn whether she was married or not, but have always\r\nregarded her action in relieving me from a silent dinner as the\r\nhighest mark of politeness.  She was bright and attractive, and I\r\ncertainly did and said all I could to amuse her, so what I expected\r\nto be a dull dinner turned out to be a very joyful one.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for an American to visit Paris without enjoyment\r\nand instruction.  The people of Paris are always polite, especially\r\nto Americans.  The debt of gratitude for the assistance of France\r\nin our War of the Revolution is never forgotten by a true American,\r\nand Frenchmen are always proud of their share in establishing the\r\nindependence of America.  The two Bonapartes alone did not share\r\nin this feeling.  The Americans are liberal visitors in Paris.\r\nThey spend their money freely, join heartily in festivities, and\r\nsympathize in the success and prosperity of the French republic.\r\nIf I was not an American I certainly would be a Frenchman.  I have\r\nvisited Paris three times, remaining in it more than a month at\r\neach visit, and always have been received with civility and kindness.\r\nThough it is a great manufacturing city, chiefly in articles of\r\nluxury requiring the highest skill, yet it is also a most beautiful\r\ncity in its location, its buildings, public and private, its museums\r\nand opera houses, its parks and squares, its wide streets and\r\navenues, and especially the intelligence of its people.  Science\r\nand art have here reached their highest development.  We may copy\r\nall these, but it will require a century to develop like progress\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nI returned to England for a few days and then took the steamer\r\n\"City of Paris\" for New York, where I arrived on the 13th of July.\r\nI took the cars for Washington and arrived ten days after the\r\nsession had commenced.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Paris a special international commission, composed\r\nof delegates from seventeen nations, was sitting to consider, and,\r\nif possible, agree on a common unit of money for the use of the\r\ncivilized world.  Mr. Samuel B. Ruggles, a gentleman of the highest\r\nstanding and character, was the representative of the United States\r\non this commission.  It should be remembered that at this time the\r\nonly currency in circulation in the United States was the legal\r\ntender notes of the United States and the notes of national banks.\r\nNeither gold nor silver coin was in circulation, both being at a\r\npremium in currency.  At this time silver bullion was at a premium\r\nover gold bullion, the legal ratio being sixteen to one.  In other\r\nwords, sixteen ounces of silver were worth, in the open market,\r\nthree to five cents more than one ounce of gold.  All parties in\r\nthe United States were then looking forward to the time when United\r\nStates notes would advance in value to par with gold, the cheaper\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nThe question before the commission was how to secure a common coin\r\nthat would be the measure of value between all nations, and thus\r\navoid the loss by exchange of the coins of one nation for those of\r\nanother.  Mr. Ruggles knew that I had studied this question, and\r\ntherefore wrote this letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Paris, May 17, 1867.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--You are, of course, aware that there is a special\r\ncommittee now in session, organized by the Imperial Commission of\r\nFrance, in connection with the 'Paris Exposition,' composed of\r\ndelegates from many of the nations therein represented.  Its object,\r\namong others, is to agree, if possible, on a common unit of money,\r\nfor the use of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\"I perceive that the opinions of the committee are running strongly\r\nin favor of adopting, as the unit, the existing French five-franc\r\npiece of gold.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what, in your opinion, is the probability that the\r\nCongress of the United States, at an early period, would agree to\r\nreduce the weight and value of our gold dollar, to correspond with\r\nthe present weight and value of the gold five-franc piece of France;\r\nand how far back such a change would commend itself to your own\r\njudgment?\r\n\r\n\"I would also ask the privilege of submitting your answer to the\r\nconsideration of the committee.\r\n\r\n  \"With high respect, faithfully your friend,\r\n  \"Samuel B. Ruggles,\r\n  \"U. S. Commissioner to the Paris Exposition and Member of the\r\n     Committee.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman,\r\n  \"Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate of the United\r\n     States, etc., etc., etc., now in Paris.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter I made the following reply:\r\n\r\n  \"Hotel Jardin des Tuileries, May 18, 1867.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your note of yesterday, inquiring whether Congress\r\nwould probably, in future coinage, make our gold dollar conform in\r\nvalue to the gold five-franc piece, has been received.\r\n\r\n\"There has been so little discussion in Congress upon the subject\r\nthat I cannot base my opinion upon anything said or done there.\r\n\r\n\"The subject has, however, excited the attention of several important\r\ncommercial bodies in the United States, and the time is now so\r\nfavorable that I feel quite sure that Congress will adopt any\r\npractical measure that will secure to the commercial world a uniform\r\nstandard of value and exchange.\r\n\r\n\"The only question will be, how can this be accomplished?\r\n\r\n\"The treaty of December 23, 1865, between France, Italy, Belgium,\r\nand Switzerland, and the probable acquiescence in that treaty by\r\nPrussia, has laid the foundation for such a standard.  If Great\r\nBritain will reduce the value of her sovereign two pence, and the\r\nUnited States will reduce the value of her dollar something over\r\nthree cents, we then have a coinage in the franc, dollar and\r\nsovereign easily computed, and which will readily pass in all\r\ncountries; the dollar as five francs and the sovereign as 25 francs.\r\n\r\n\"This will put an end to the loss and intricacies of exchange and\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\n\"Our gold dollar is certainly as good a unit of value as the franc;\r\nand so the English think of their pound sterling.  These coins are\r\nnow exchangeable only at a considerable loss, and this exchange is\r\na profit only to brokers and bankers.  Surely each commercial nation\r\nshould be willing to yield a little to secure a gold coin of equal\r\nvalue, weight, and diameter, from whatever mint it may have been\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n\"As the gold five-franc piece is now in use by over 60,000,000 of\r\npeople of several different nationalities, and is of convenient\r\nform and size, it may well be adopted by other nations as the common\r\nstandard of value, leaving to each nation to regulate the divisions\r\nof this unit in silver coin or tokens.\r\n\r\n\"If this is done France will surely abandon the impossible effort\r\nof making two standards of value.  Gold coins will answer all the\r\npurpose of European commerce.  A common gold standard will regulate\r\nsilver coinage, of which the United States will furnish the greater\r\npart, especially for the Chinese trade.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought a good deal of how the object you propose may be\r\nmost readily accomplished.  It is clear that the United States\r\ncannot become a party to the treaty referred to.  They could not\r\nagree upon the silver standard; nor could we limit the amount of\r\nour coinage, as proposed by the treaty.  The United States is so\r\nlarge in extent, is so sparsely populated, and the price of labor\r\nis so much higher than in Europe, that we require more currency\r\nper capita.  We now produce the larger part of the gold and silver\r\nof the world, and cannot limit our coinage except by the wants of\r\nour people and the demands of commerce.\r\n\r\n\"Congress alone can change the value of our coin.  I see no object\r\nin negotiating with other powers on the subject.  As coin is not\r\nnow in general circulation with us, we can readily fix by law the\r\nsize, weight, and measure of future issues.  It is not worth while\r\nto negotiate about that which we can do without negotiation, and\r\nwe do not wish to limit ourselves by treaty restrictions.\r\n\r\n\"In England many persons of influence and different chambers of\r\ncommerce are earnestly in favor of the proposed change in their\r\ncoinage.  The change is so slight with them that an enlightened\r\nself-interest will soon induce them to make it, especially if we\r\nmake the greater change in our coinage.  We have some difficulty\r\nin adjusting existing contracts with the new dollar; but as contracts\r\nare now based upon the fluctuating value of paper money, even the\r\nreduced dollar in coin will be of more purchasable value than our\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n\"We can easily adjust the reduction with public creditors in the\r\npayment or conversion of their securities, while private creditors\r\nmight be authorized to recover upon the old standard.  All these\r\nare matters of detail to which I hope the commission will direct\r\ntheir attention.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear sir, allow me to say in conclusion that I heartily\r\nsympathize with you and the others in your efforts to secure the\r\nadoption of the metrical system of weights and measures.\r\n\r\n\"The tendency of the age is to break down all needless restrictions\r\nupon social and commercial intercourse.  Nations are now as much\r\nakin to each other as provinces were of old.  Prejudices disappear\r\nby contact.  People of different nations learn to respect each\r\nother as they find that their differences are the effect of social\r\nand local custom, not founded upon good reasons.  I trust that the\r\nindustrial commission will enable the world to compute the value\r\nof all productions by the same standard, to measure by the same\r\nyard or meter, and weigh by the same scales.\r\n\r\n\"Such a result would be of greater value than the usual employments\r\nof diplomatists and statesmen.\r\n\r\n  \"I am very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAs the result of its investigation the commission agreed, with\r\nentire unanimity, that the gold five-franc piece should be adopted\r\nas the unit of value, and that the coins of all nations represented\r\nshould be based upon that unit or multiples thereof.  This would\r\nrequire a slight change in the quantity of gold in the dollar of\r\nthe United States, amounting to a reduction of about three cents,\r\na reduction in the pound sterling of England of about one penny,\r\nand a slight reduction or increase in the gold coins of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles reported the proceedings and recommendation of the\r\ncommission to the President, and his report was referred to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nA private letter to me from Mr. Ruggles, dated December 30, 1867,\r\nshows the nature of the opposition to the measure proposed, being\r\nentirely from British opposition to a change in the pound sterling.\r\nHe wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, December 30, 1867.\r\n\"My Dear Mr. Sherman:--You may have perceived, within the last\r\nweek, articles in the 'New York Evening Post,' the 'New York Times'\r\nand the 'World,' on the subject of the proposed monetary unification;\r\nthe first denying its _propriety_, the second its _practicability_,\r\nand the third underrating its _importance_.\r\n\r\n\"The articles are hastily and ignorantly and, in some respects,\r\nbitterly written.  My first impulse was to briefly answer each of\r\nthem in its respective newspaper.  On further reflection, it seemed\r\nmore decorous that, as a member of the 'conference,' I should first\r\nappear before the Senate committee now in possession of all the\r\npapers, and there render any proper explanations, and not obtrude\r\nmyself as a combatant in the newspapers, prematurely and only\r\npartially defending my official action.  If, however, you should\r\nthink that the articles should be answered without delay, I could\r\nreadily cause it to be done, by other persons.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot but think that the dignity of the subject, formally\r\npresented as it now is, to our national authorities, by a diplomatic\r\nassemblage representing nearly all the civilized nations of the\r\nChristian world, entitles it to a full discussion before the Senate\r\ncommittee, to be followed by a maturely considered report, fairly\r\nweighing and presenting to the country all the merits and demerits,\r\nfacilities and difficulties of the measure.\r\n\r\n\"I am just at the moment confined to my house by an 'influenza,'\r\nbut if I can be of any service, either before the committee or\r\nelsewhere, I shall hold myself subject to your official call, for\r\nany duty, after the 7th or 8th of January, which you may indicate.\r\n\r\n\"You must have perceived that my report to the department of state,\r\nhaving in view the possibility of European readers, abstained from\r\nsome considerations which might properly be brought to the notice\r\nof the committee of the American Senate.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange, indeed, to see American newspapers eagerly maintaining\r\nthe inviolability of the 'pound sterling,' when it has become\r\nentirely evident that the great monetary struggle of the future\r\nmust lie between the British pound and the American dollar.  In\r\ntruth, this was virtually admitted in the 'conference' by Mr.\r\nGraham, one of the British delegates, and master of the royal mint.\r\n\r\n  \"With high regard, faithfully yours,\r\n  \"Samuel B. Ruggles.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman,\r\n  \"Chairman Senate Finance Comittee, etc., etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nWe were called upon to legislate upon the subject.  The French\r\ngovernment promptly acquiesced in the coin proposed.  Mr. Ruggles'\r\nreport said that several governments had already assented to it.\r\nThe report was referred to the committee on finance of the Senate,\r\nwho submitted a favorable report with a bill to carry out the\r\nrecommendations, and that report was published.  There was no\r\ndissent from the plan except that Senator Morgan, of New York,\r\nthought it would interfere with the profit of New York brokers in\r\nchanging dollars into pounds.  As a matter of course, it would have\r\ninterfered with the exchanges of New York and London, the great\r\nmoney centers of the world.  It would have interfered with bullion\r\ndealers who make profit in exchanging coins; but the whole of it\r\nwas for the benefit of each country.\r\n\r\nNo man can estimate the benefit it would have conferred upon our\r\nown people.  It was only defeated by the refusal of Great Britain\r\nto assent to the change of her pound sterling by the reduction of\r\nits value about one penny.  But pride in the existing coins, so\r\nstrong in that country, defeated the measure, although it had been\r\nassented to by her representatives in that monetary congress; and\r\nso the thing ended.\r\n\r\nIt is easy now to perceive that if this international coin had been\r\nagreed to it would have passed current everywhere, as it could\r\nrapidly be exchanged at sight without going through the hands of\r\nbrokers.  I do not believe that Mr. Morgan would have insisted on\r\nhis opposition, as the only ground of his objection was, it would\r\nhave destroyed the business of the money changers of New York.\r\nEven his resistance would have been ineffectual, as the committee\r\nand the Senate were decidedly in favor of the bill and the opposition\r\nof New York brokers would have added strength to the measure.\r\n\r\nThe greatest statesmen of Europe and America have sought for many\r\nyears to unify the coinage of nations, and to adopt common standards\r\nof weights and measures, so that commerce may be freed from the\r\nrestrictions now imposed upon it, but Great Britain has steadily\r\nopposed all these enlightened measures, and thus far has been able\r\nto defeat them.\r\n\r\nMy report from the committee on finance, made to the Senate June\r\n7, 1868, contains a full statement of the acts of the monetary\r\nconference at Paris, and of the approval of its action by many of\r\nthe countries there represented, and of the support given to the\r\nplan in Great Britain by many of her ablest statesmen and the great\r\nbody of her commercial classes, but the party then in power in\r\nparliament refused its sanction, and thus, as already stated, the\r\nmeasure failed.\r\n\r\nIt has been quite common, during recent discussion about silver,\r\nto attribute the alleged demonetization of that metal to the action\r\nof the Paris monetary conference.  In 1867, when this conference\r\nwas in session, as already stated, sixteen ounces of silver were\r\nworth more than one ounce of gold.  Fifteen and one-half ounces of\r\nsilver were the legal equivalent of one ounce of gold in all European\r\ncountries.  No suggestion was made or entertained to disturb the\r\ncirculation of silver.  The only object sought was to secure some\r\ncommon coin by which other coins could be easily measured.  As gold\r\nwas the most valuable metal in smallest space, and the five-franc\r\ngold piece of France was the best _unit_ by which other coins could\r\nbe measured, other gold coins were to be multiples of the unit, so\r\nthat five francs would be a dollar and five dollars would be a\r\npound.  The coins of other nations would be made to conform to\r\nmultiples of this unit.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly understood that, while silver was the chief coin\r\nin domestic exchanges in every country, it was not convenient for\r\nforeign commerce, owing to its bulk.  The ratio between gold and\r\nsilver was purely a domestic matter, to be determined by each\r\ncountry for itself.  It is apparent that the chief cause of the\r\nfall of the market value of silver is its increased production.\r\nThis affects the price of every commodity, cotton, corn, or wheat\r\nas well as silver.  The law of supply and demand regulates value.\r\nIt is the \"higher law\" more potent than acts of Congress.  If the\r\nsupply is in excess of demand the price will fall, in spite of\r\nlegislation.  The most striking evidence of this was furnished by\r\nour recent legislation by which we purchased over 400,000,000 ounces\r\nof silver at its market value and hoarded it, and yet the price of\r\nit steadily declined.  We can coin it into silver dollars, but we\r\ncan keep these dollars at par with gold only be receiving them as\r\nthe equal of gold when offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nIMPEACHMENT OF ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\nJudiciary Committee's Resolution Fails of Adoption by a Vote of 57\r\nYeas to 108 Nays--Johnson's Attempt to Remove Secretary Stanton\r\nand Create a New Office for General Sherman--Correspondence on the\r\nSubject--Report of the Committee on Impeachment, and Other Matters\r\nPertaining to the Appointment of Lorenzo Thomas--Impeachment\r\nResolution Passed by the House by a Vote of 126 Yeas to 47 Nays--\r\nJohnson's Trial by the Senate--Acquittal of the President by a Vote\r\nof 35 Guilty to 19 Not Guilty--Why I Favored Conviction--General\r\nSchofield Becomes Secretary of War--\"Tenure of Office Act.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1867 the question of impeaching\r\nAndrew Johnson, President of the United States, was frequently\r\ndiscussed in the House of Representatives.  The resolutions relating\r\nto his impeachment were introduced by James M. Ashley, of Ohio, on\r\nthe 7th of March, 1867, and they were adopted on the same day.\r\nThese resolutions instructed the judiciary committee, when appointed,\r\nto continue the inquiry, previously ordered, into certain charges\r\npreferred against the President of the United States, with authority\r\nto sit during the sessions of the House, and during any recess the\r\nCongress might take.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of November, 1867, a majority of the committee on the\r\njudiciary reported a resolution of impeachment, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,\r\nbe impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was accompanied by a long report and the testimony,\r\nall of which was ordered to be printed, and made the special order\r\nfor Wednesday, December 4, 1867.  James F. Wilson, of Iowa, made\r\na minority report against the resolution of impeachment, signed by\r\nhimself and Frederick E. Woodbridge, of Vermont.  Samuel S. Marshall,\r\nof Illinois, also made a minority report in behalf of himself and\r\nCharles A. Eldridge, of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of December, the resolution of impeachment reported by\r\nthe committee on the judiciary at the previous session was disagreed\r\nto by a vote of 57 yeas and 108 nays.  This decision of the House\r\nof Representatives against an impeachment on the charges then made\r\nwas entirely justified.  This imposing process was not authorized\r\nfor misconduct, immorality, intoxication or neglect of duties, such\r\nas were alleged in the report of the committee, but only for high\r\ncrimes or misdemeanors.  The House properly made this distinction,\r\nand here the accusations against the President would have ended,\r\nbut for his attempt, in violation of the constitution and law, to\r\nplace General Lorenzo Thomas in an important office without the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, then in session.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1867, and the early part of 1868, I became\r\ninvolved in a controversy, between President Johnson, General Grant\r\nand General Sherman, which caused the last-named serious embarrassment.\r\nAs much of the correspondence between these parties has been\r\npublished in the \"Sherman Letters,\" I at first thought it best not\r\nto make any reference to the matter, but upon reflection, and to\r\nexplain subsequent events, I insert the letters in their order.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman was summoned to Washington, by the President, and\r\nupon his arrival there wrote me the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, October 11, 1867.\r\n\"Dear Brother:--I have no doubt that you have been duly concerned\r\nabout my being summoned to Washington.\r\n\r\n\"It was imprudently done by the President without going through\r\nGrant.  But I think I have smoothed it over so that Grant does not\r\nfeel hurt.  I cannot place myself in a situation even partially\r\nantagonistic with Grant.  We must work together.  Mr. Johnson has\r\nnot offered me anything, only has talked over every subject, and\r\nbecause I listen to him patiently, and make short and decisive\r\nanswers, he says he would like to have me here.  Still he does not\r\noppose my going back home. . . .\r\n\r\n\"On Monday I will start for St. Louis by the Atlantic and G. W.\r\nroad, and pass Mansfield Tuesday.  Can't you meet me and ride some\r\nmiles?  I have been away from home so much, and must go right along\r\nto Fort Laramie, that I cannot well stop at Cleveland or Mansfield,\r\nand would like to see you for an hour or so to hear your views of\r\nthe coming events. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Yours affectionately,\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on his return to St. Louis he continues:\r\n\r\n. . . \"I have always talked kindly to the President, and have\r\nadvised Grant to do so.  I do think that it is best for all hands\r\nthat his administration be allowed to run out its course without\r\nthreatened or attempted violence.  Whoever begins violent proceedings\r\nwill lose in the long run.  Johnson is not a man of action but of\r\ntheory, and so long as your party is in doubt as to the true mode\r\nof procedure, it would be at great risk that an attempt be made to\r\ndisplease the President by a simple law of Congress.  This is as\r\nmuch as I have ever said to anybody.  I have never, by word or\r\ninference, given anybody the right to class me in opposition to,\r\nor in support of, Congress.  On the contrary, I told Mr. Johnson\r\nthat from the nature of things he could not dispense with a Congress\r\nto make laws and appropriate money, and suggested to him to receive\r\nand make overtures to such men as Fessenden, Trumbull, Sherman,\r\nMorgan, and Morton, who, though differing with him in abstract\r\nviews of constitutional law and practice, were not destructive.\r\nThat if the congressional plan of reconstruction succeeded, he\r\ncould do nothing, and if it failed or led to confusion, the future\r\ndeveloped results in his favor, etc.; and that is pretty much all\r\nI have ever said or done.  At the meeting of the society of the\r\narmy of the Tennessee on the 13th inst., I will be forced to speak,\r\nif here, and though I can confine myself purely to the military\r\nevents of the past, I can make the opportunity of stating that in\r\nno event will I be drawn into the complications of the civil politics\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\n\"If Congress could meet and confine itself to current and committee\r\nbusiness, I feel certain that everything will work along quietly\r\ntill the nominations are made, and a new presidential election will\r\nlikely settle the principle if negroes are to be voters in the\r\nstates without the consent of the whites.  This is more a question\r\nof prejudice than principle, but a voter has as much right to his\r\nprejudices as to his vote. . . .\"\r\n\r\nI answered:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, Ohio, November 1, 1867.\r\n\"Dear Brother:-- . . . I see no real occasion for trouble with\r\nJohnson.  The great error of his life was in not acquiescing in\r\nand supporting the 14th amendment of the constitution in the 39th\r\nCongress.  This he could easily have carried.  It referred the\r\nsuffrage question to each state, and if adopted long ago the whole\r\ncontroversy would have culminated; or, if further opposed by the\r\nextreme radicals, they would have been easily beaten.  Now I see\r\nnothing short of universal suffrage and universal amnesty as the\r\nbasis.  When you come on, I suggest that you give out that you go\r\non to make your annual report and settle Indian affairs.  Give us\r\nnotice when you will be on, and come directly to my house, where\r\nwe will make you one of the family.\r\n\r\n\"Grant, I think, is inevitably the candidate.  He allows himself\r\nto drift into a position where he can't decline if he would, and\r\nI feel sure he don't want to decline.  My judgment is that Chase\r\nis better for the country and for Grant himself, but I will not\r\nquarrel with what I cannot control.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAnd later I wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"If you can keep free from committals to Johnson, you will surely\r\nas you live be called upon to act as President.  The danger now is\r\nthat the mistakes of the Republicans may drift the Democratic party\r\ninto power.  If so, the Rebellion is triumphant, and no man active\r\nin suppressing it will be treated or honored.  Grant is not injured\r\nby his correspondence with Johnson, but no doubt feels annoyed. . . .\"\r\n\r\nAt this time President Johnson had come to open disagreement with\r\nMr. Stanton, his Secretary of War, and wished to force him from\r\nthe cabinet.  Mr. Stanton had refused to resign and had been upheld\r\nby Congress.  The President then turned for help in his difficulties\r\nto General Grant, commanding the army; but the latter found that\r\nany interference on his part would be illegal and impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson then planned to create a new office for General Sherman,\r\nthat of brevet general of the army, in order to bring him to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe following letters and telegrams refer to this difficulty:\r\n\r\n  \"(Confidential.)\r\n  \"Library Room, War Department,       }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., January 31, 1868.}\r\n\"To the President:--Since our interview of yesterday I have given\r\nthe subject of our conversation all my thoughts, and I beg you will\r\npardon my reducing the result to writing.\r\n\r\n\"My personal preferences, if expressed, were to be allowed to return\r\nto St. Louis to resume my present command, because my command was\r\nimportant, large, suited to my rank and inclination, and because\r\nmy family was well provided for there, in house facilities, schools,\r\nliving, and agreeable society.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst, on the other hand, Washington was for many (to me) good\r\nreasons highly objectionable.  Especially because it is the political\r\ncapital of the country and focus of intrigue, gossip, and slander.\r\nYour personal preferences were, as expressed, to make a new department\r\neast adequate to my rank, with headquarters at Washington, and to\r\nassign me to its command--to remove my family here, and to avail\r\nmyself of its schools, etc.; to remove Mr. Stanton from his office\r\nas Secretary of War, and have me to discharge the duties.\r\n\r\n\"To effect this removal two modes were indicated:  To simply cause\r\nhim to quit the war office building and notify the treasury department\r\nand the army staff departments no longer to respect him as Secretary\r\nor War; or to remove him, and submit my name to the Senate for\r\nconfirmation.  Permit me to discuss these points a little, and I\r\nwill premise by saying that I have spoken to no one on the subject,\r\nand have not even seen Mr. Ewing, Mr. Stanbery, or General Grant\r\nsince I was with you.\r\n\r\n\"It has been the rule and custom of our army, since the organization\r\nof the government, that the officer of the army second in rank\r\nshould be in command at the second place in importance, and remote\r\nfrom general headquarters.  To bring me to Washington would put\r\nthree heads to an army,--yourself, General Grant, and myself,--and\r\nwe would be more than human if we were not to differ.  In my judgment\r\nit would ruin the army, and would be fatal to one or two of us.\r\n\r\n\"Generals Scott and Taylor proved themselves soldiers and patriots\r\nin the field, but Washington was fatal to them both.  This city\r\nand the influences that centered here defeated every army that had\r\nits head here from 1861 to 1865, and would have overwhelmed General\r\nGrant at Spottsylvania and Petersburg, had he not been fortified\r\nby a strong reputation already hard earned, and because no one then\r\nliving coveted the place.  Whereas in the west we made progress\r\nfrom the start, because there was no political capital near enough\r\nto poison our minds and kindle into light that craving itching for\r\nfame which has killed more good men than battles.  I have been with\r\nGeneral Grant in the midst of death and slaughter--when the howls\r\nof people reached him after Shiloh; when messengers were speeding\r\nto and fro, between his army and Washington, bearing slanders to\r\ninduce his removal before he took Vicksburg; in Chattanooga, when\r\nthe soldiers were stealing the corn of the starving mules to satisfy\r\ntheir own hunger; at Nashville, when he was ordered to the 'forlorn\r\nhope' to command the army of the Potomac, so often defeated--and\r\nyet I never saw him more troubled than since he has been in\r\nWashington, and has been compelled to read himself a 'sneak and\r\ndeceiver,' based on reports of four of the cabinet, and apparently\r\nwith your knowledge.  If this political atmosphere can disturb the\r\nequanimity of one so guarded and so prudent as he is, what will be\r\nthe result with one so careless, so outspoken, as I am?  Therefore,\r\nwith my consent, Washington never.\r\n\r\n\"As to the Secretary of War, his office is twofold.  As cabinet\r\nofficer he should not be there without your hearty, cheerful consent,\r\nand I believe that is the judgment and opinion of every fair-minded\r\nman.  As the holder of a civil office, having the supervision of\r\nmoney appropriated by Congress, and of contracts for army supplies,\r\nI do think Congress, or the Senate by delegation from Congress,\r\nhas a lawful right to be consulted.  At all events, I would not\r\nrisk a suit or contest on that phase of the question.  The law of\r\nCongress of March 2, 1867, prescribing the manner in which orders\r\nand instructions relating to 'military movements' shall reach the\r\narmy, gives you, as constitutional commander in chief, the very\r\npower you want to exercise, and enables you to prevent the secretary\r\nfrom making any such orders and instructions, and consequently he\r\ncannot control the army, but is limited and restricted to a duty\r\nthat an auditor of the treasury could perform.  You certainly can\r\nafford to await the result.  The executive power is not weakened,\r\nbut, rather, strengthened.  Surely he is not such an obstruction\r\nas would warrant violence or even a show of force which could\r\nproduce the very reaction and clamor that he hopes for, to save\r\nhim from the absurdity of holding an empty office 'for the safety\r\nof the country.'\r\n\r\n  \"With great respect, yours truly,\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Military Division of the Missouri,}\r\n  \"St. Louis, Mo., February 14, 1868.             }\r\n\"To the President:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--It is hard for me to conceive you would purposely do\r\nme an unkindness, unless under the pressure of a sense of public\r\nduty, or because you do not believe me sincere.\r\n\r\n\"I was in hopes, since my letter to you of the 31st of January,\r\nthat you had concluded to pass over that purpose of yours, expressed\r\nmore than once in conversation, to organize a new command for me\r\nin the east, with headquarters in Washington; but a telegram, from\r\nGeneral Grant, of yesterday, says that 'the order was issued ordering\r\nyou' (me) 'to Atlantic division;' and the newspapers of this morning\r\ncontain the same information, with the addition that I have been\r\nnominated as 'brevet general.'  I have telegraphed to my own brother\r\nin the Senate to oppose my nomination, on the ground that the two\r\nhigher grades in the army ought not to be complicated with brevets,\r\nand I trust you will conceive my motives aright.  If I could see\r\nmy way clear to maintain my family, I should not hesitate a moment\r\nto resign my present commission and seek some business wherein I\r\nwould be free from those unhappy complications that seem to be\r\nclosing about me, in spite of my earnest efforts to avoid them;\r\nbut necessity ties my hands, and I submit with the best grace I\r\ncan, till I make other arrangements.\r\n\r\n\"In Washington are already the headquarters of a department, and\r\nof the army itself, and it is hard for me to see wherein I can\r\nrender military service there.  Any staff officer with the rank of\r\nmajor could surely fill any gap left between those two military\r\noffices; and by being placed at Washington I shall be universally\r\nconstrued as a rival to the general in chief, a position damaging\r\nto me in the highest degree.  Our relations have always been most\r\nconfidential and friendly, and if, unhappily, any cloud of difficulty\r\nshould arise between us, my sense of personal dignity and duty\r\nwould leave me no alternative but resignation.  For this I am not\r\nyet prepared, but I shall proceed to arrange for it as rapidly as\r\npossible, that when the time does come (as it surely will if this\r\nplan is carried into effect), I may act promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as the order is now issued, I cannot expect a full\r\nrevocation of it, but I beg the privilege of taking post at New\r\nYork, or at any point you may name, within the new military division,\r\nother than Washington.\r\n\r\n\"This privilege is generally granted to all military commanders,\r\nand I can see no good reasons why I, too, may not ask for it; and\r\nthis simple concession, involving no public interest, will much\r\nsoften the blow which, right or wrong, I construe as one of the\r\nhardest I have sustained in a life somewhat checkered with\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\n  \"With great respect, yours truly,\r\n(Signed)  \"W. T. Sherman, Lieutenant General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Military Division of Missouri,}\r\n  \"St. Louis, February 14, 1868.              }\r\n\"Dear Brother:-- . . . I am again in the midst of trouble, occasioned\r\nby a telegram from Grant saying that the order is out for me to\r\ncome to the command of the military division of the Atlantic,\r\nheadquarters at Washington.  The President repeatedly asked me to\r\naccept of some such position, but I thought I had fought it off\r\nsuccessfully, though he again and again reverted to it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, it seems, he has ordered it, and it is full of trouble for\r\nme.  I wrote him one or two letters in Washington, which I though\r\npositive enough, but have now written another, and if it fails in\r\nits object I might as well cast about for new employment.  The\r\nresult would be certain conflict, resulting in Grant's violent\r\ndeposition, mine, or the President's.\r\n\r\n\"There is not room on board of one ship for more than one captain.\r\n\r\n\"If Grant intends to run for President I should be willing to come\r\non, because my duties would then be so clearly defined that I think\r\nI could steer clear of the breakers--but now it would be impossible.\r\nThe President would make use of me to beget violence, a condition\r\nof things that ought not to exist now.\r\n\r\n\"He has no right to use us for such purposes, though he is commander\r\nin chief.  I did suppose his passage with Grant would end there,\r\nbut now it seems he will fight him as he has been doing Congress.\r\nI don't object if he does so himself and don't rope me in. . . .\r\n\r\n\"If the President forces me into a false position out of seeming\r\nfavor, I must defend myself.  It is mortifying, but none the less\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately,\r\n  \"W. T.

I have not yet got the order for the Atlantic\r\ndivision, but it is coming by mail, and when received I must act.\r\nI have asked the President to let me make my headquarters at New\r\nYork, instead of Washington, making my application of the ground\r\nthat my simply being in Washington will be universally construed\r\nas rivalry to General Grant, a position which would be damaging to\r\nme in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\"If I must come to Washington, it will be with a degree of reluctance\r\nnever before experienced.  I would leave my family here on the\r\nsupposition that the change was temporary.  I do not question the\r\nPresident's right to make the new division, and I think Congress\r\nwould make a mistake to qualify his right.

B. Comstock, B. B. S.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, United States Senate.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after this, General Sherman went to Washington in response\r\nto the President's order, and while there had several interviews\r\nwith the President relating to the change of his command.  He\r\nobjected very strongly, as has been seen, to any such change,\r\nbecause he felt that he could not hold a command in Washington\r\nwithout interfering with Grant's interests, and because he had a\r\nrooted objection to living in Washington in the midst of the turmoil\r\nof politics.  These objections were embodied in three letters which\r\nGeneral Sherman wrote and showed to Grant before he sent them to\r\nthe President.  One of them found its way into the public press,\r\nand created a disturbance which called forth the following letters:\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Army of the United States,}\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., February 22, 1868.  }\r\n\"Hon. J. Sherman, United States Senate.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--The 'National Intelligencer' of this morning contains\r\na private note which General Sherman sent to the President whilst\r\nhe was in Washington, dictated by the purest kindness and a\r\ndisposition to preserve harmony, and not intended for publication.\r\nIt seems to me that the publication of that letter is calculated\r\nto place the general in a wrong light before the public, taken in\r\nconnection with what correspondents have said before, evidently\r\ngetting their inspiration from the White House.\r\n\r\n\"As General Sherman afterwards wrote a semi-official note to the\r\nPresident, furnishing me a copy, and still later a purely official\r\none sent through me, which placed him in his true position, and\r\nwhich have not been published, though called for by the 'House,'\r\nI take the liberty of sending you these letters to give you the\r\nopportunity of consulting General Sherman as to what action to take\r\nupon them.  In all matters where I am not personally interested,\r\nI would not hesitate to advise General Sherman how I would act in\r\nhis place.  But in this instance, after the correspondence I have\r\nhad with Mr. Johnson, I may not see General Sherman's interest in\r\nthe same light that others see it, or that I would see it in if no\r\nsuch correspondence had occurred.  I am clear in this, however,\r\nthe correspondence here inclosed to you should not be made public\r\nexcept by the President, or with the full sanction of General\r\nSherman.  Probably the letter of the 31st of January, marked\r\n'confidential,' should not be given out at all.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter was addressed to the \"National Intelligencer,\"\r\na Washington newspaper:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate Chamber, }\r\n  \"Washington, February 22, 1868.}\r\n\"Gentlemen:--The publication in your paper yesterday of General\r\nSherman's note to the President, and its simultaneous transmission\r\nby telegraph, unaccompanied by subsequent letters withheld by the\r\nPresident because they were 'private,' is so unfair as to justify\r\nsevere censure upon the person who furnished you this letter,\r\nwhoever he may be.  Upon its face it is an informal private note\r\ndictated by the purest motives--a desire to preserve harmony--and\r\nnot intended for publication.  How any gentleman receiving such a\r\nnote could first allow vague but false suggestions of its contents\r\nto be given out, and then print it, and withhold other letters\r\nbecause they were 'private,' with a view to create the impression\r\nthat General Sherman, in referring to ulterior measures, suggested\r\nthe violent expulsion of a high officer from his office, passes my\r\ncomprehension.  Still I know that General Sherman is so sensitive\r\nupon questions of official propriety in publishing papers, that he\r\nwould rather suffer from this false inference than correct it by\r\npublishing another private note, and as I know that this letter\r\nwas not the only one written by General Sherman to the President\r\nabout Mr. Stanton, I applied to the President for his consent to\r\npublish subsequent letters.  This consent was freely given by the\r\nPresident, and I therefore send copies to you and ask their\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n\"These copies are furnished me from official sources; for while I\r\nknow General Sherman's opinions, yet he did not show me either of\r\nthe letters to the President, during his stay here, nervously\r\nanxious to promote harmony, to avoid strife, and certainly never\r\nsuggested or countenanced resistance to law--or violence in any\r\nform.  He no doubt left Washington with his old repugnance to\r\npolitics, politicians, and newspapers very much increased by his\r\nvisit here.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate Chamber, February 23, 1868.\r\n\"Dear Brother:--I received your letters and telegrams, and did not\r\nanswer because events were moving so rapidly that I could say\r\nnothing but might be upset before you got the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Now you can congratulate yourself upon being clear of the worst\r\ncomplications we have ever had.  Impeachment seems to be a forgone\r\nconclusion so far as the House of Representatives is concerned,\r\nbased upon the alleged _forcible_ expulsion of Stanton.  No one\r\ndisputes the right of the President to raise a question of law upon\r\nhis right to remove Stanton, but the forcible removal of a man in\r\noffice, claiming to be in lawfully, is like the forcible ejectment\r\nof a tenant when his right of possession is in dispute.  It is a\r\ntrespass, an assault, a riot, or a crime, according to the result\r\nof the force.  It is strange the President can contemplate such a\r\nthing, when Stanton is already stripped of power, and the courts\r\nare open to the President to try his right of removal.  The President\r\nis acting very badly with respect to you.  He creates the impression\r\nthat you acted disingenuously with him.  He has published your\r\nshort private note before you went to Annapolis, and yet refuses\r\nto publish your formal one subsequently sent to him, because it\r\nwas 'private.'  The truth is, he is a slave to his passions and\r\nresentments.  No man can confide in him, and you ought to feel\r\nhappy at your extrication from all near connection with him. . . .\r\nGrant is anxious to have your letters published, since the note\r\nreferred to was published.  I will see Grant and the President this\r\nevening, and if the latter freely consents, I will do it informally;\r\nbut if he doubts or hesitates, I will not without your expressed\r\ndirections.  In these times of loose confidence, it is better to\r\nsubmit for a time to a wrong construction, than to betray confidential\r\ncommunications.  Grant will, unquestionably, be nominated.  Chase\r\nacquiesces, and I see no reason to doubt his election. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Military Division of the Missouri.}\r\n  \"St. Louis, Mo., February 25, 1868.             }\r\n\"Dear Brother:-- . . . I am in possession of all the news up to\r\ndate--the passage of the impeachment resolution, etc.--but I yet\r\ndon't know if the nomination of T. Ewing, Senior, was a real thing\r\nor meant to compromise a difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"The publication of my short note of January 18, is nothing to me.\r\nI have the original draft which I sent through Grant's hands, with\r\nhis indorsement back to me.  At the time this note must have been\r\ngiven to the reporter, the President had an elaborate letter from\r\nme, in which I discussed the whole case, and advised against the\r\nvery course he has pursued, but I don't want that letter or any\r\nother to be drawn out to complicate a case already bad enough.\r\n\r\n\"You may always safely represent me by saying that I will not make\r\nup a final opinion until called on to act, and I want nothing to\r\ndo with these controversies until the time comes for the actual\r\nfight, which I hope to God may be avoided.  If the Democratic party\r\nintend to fight on this impeachment, which I believe they do not,\r\nyou may count 200,000 men against you in the south.  The negroes\r\nare no match for them.  On this question, the whites there will be\r\nmore united than on the old issue of union and secession.  I do\r\nnot think the President should be suspended during trial, and, if\r\npossible, the Republican party should not vote on all side questions\r\nas a unit.  They should act as judges, and not as partisans.  The\r\nvote in the House, being a strictly party vote, looks bad, for it\r\naugurs a prejudiced jury.  Those who adhere closest to the law in\r\nthis crisis are the best patriots.  Whilst the floating politicians\r\nhere share the excitement at Washington, the people generally\r\nmanifest little interest in the game going on at Washington. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately yours,\r\n  \"W.

I need not\r\nsay to you that the new events transpiring here are narrowly watched\r\nby me.  So far as I am concerned, I mean to give Johnson a fair\r\nand impartial trial, and to decide nothing until required to do\r\nso, and after full argument.  I regard him as a foolish and stubborn\r\nman, doing even right things in a wrong way, and in a position\r\nwhere the evil that he does is immensely increased by his manner\r\nof doing it.  He clearly designed to have first Grant, and then\r\nyou, involved in Lorenzo Thomas' position, and in this he is actuated\r\nby his recent revolt against Stanton.  How easy it would have been,\r\nif he had followed your advice, to have made Stanton anxious to\r\nresign, or what is worse, to have made his position ridiculous.\r\nBy his infernal folly we are drifting into turbulent waters.  The\r\nonly way is to keep cool and act conscientiously.  I congratulate\r\nyou on your lucky extrication.  I do not anticipate civil war, for\r\nour proceeding is unquestionably lawful, and if the judgment is\r\nagainst the President, his term is just as clearly _out_ as if the\r\n4th of March, 1869, was come.  The result, if he is convicted,\r\nwould cast the undivided responsibility of reconstruction upon the\r\nRepublican party, and would unquestionably secure the full admission\r\nof all the states by July next, and avoid the dangerous questions\r\nthat may otherwise arise out of the southern vote in the Presidential\r\nelection.  It is now clear that Grant will be a candidate, and his\r\nelection seems quite as clear.

Doubtless he intends to hold aloof from the\r\nexpression of any opinion, till the actual nomination is made,\r\nwhen, if he accepts with a strong radical platform, I shall be\r\nsurprised.  My notion is that he thinks that the Democrats ought\r\nnot to succeed to power, and that he would be willing to stand a\r\nsacrifice rather than see that result. . . . I notice that you\r\nRepublicans have divided on some of the side questions on impeachment,\r\nand am glad that you concede to the President the largest limits\r\nin his defense that are offered.  I don't see what the Republicans\r\ncan gain by shoving matters to an extent that looks like a foregone\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\"No matter what men may think of Mr. Johnson, his office is one\r\nthat ought to have a pretty wide latitude of opinion.  Nevertheless,\r\nthe trial is one that will be closely and sternly criticised by\r\nall the civilized world. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Your brother,\r\n  \"W. T.

It is strange that\r\nthey have so little effect on prices and business.  The struggle\r\nhas been so long that the effect has been discounted. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The President was very anxious to send you to Louisiana, and only\r\ngave it up by reason of your Indian command.  He might think that\r\nyour visit to Europe now was not consistent with the reason given\r\nfor your remaining at St. Louis.  Still, on this point you could\r\nreadily ask his opinion, and if that agrees with Grant's you need\r\nfeel no delicacy in going.  No more favorable opportunity or time\r\nto visit Europe will likely occur. . . .\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman replied:\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know what to think of the impeachment.  Was in hopes Mr.\r\nJohnson would be allowed to live out his term, and doubt if any\r\ngood will result by a change for the few months still remaining of\r\nhis term.  A new cabinet, and the changes foreshadowed by Wade's\r\nfriends, though natural enough, would have insufficient time to do\r\nany good.  I have a private letter from Grant as late as March 18,\r\nbut he says not a word of his political intentions.  So far as I\r\nknow, he would yet be glad of a change that would enable him to\r\nremain as now. . . .\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February, 1868, Mr. Stevens made the following\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n\"The committee on reconstruction, to whom was referred, on the 27th\r\nof January last, the following resolution:\r\n\r\n'_Resolved_, That the committee on reconstruction be authorized\r\nto inquire what combinations have been made or attempted to be made\r\nto obstruct the due execution of the laws; and to that end the\r\ncommittee have powers to send for persons and papers, and to examine\r\nwitnesses on oath, and report to this House what action, if any,\r\nthey may deem necessary; and that said committee have leave to\r\nreport at any time.'\r\n\r\n\"And to whom was also referred, on the 21st day of February, instant,\r\na communication from Hon.

It was\r\nsoon developed that the gravamen of the charges was not the removal\r\nof Stanton, but was the attempt of the President to force General\r\nLorenzo Thomas into a high office without the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of this impeachment I wished to be, and I think I was,\r\nabsolutely impartial.  I liked the President personally and harbored\r\nagainst him none of the prejudice and animosity of some others.\r\nI knew he was bold and rash, better fitted for the storms of\r\npolitical life than the grave responsibilities of the chief magistrate\r\nof a great country.  His education, such as it was, was acquired\r\nlate in life, when his character was formed and his habits fixed.\r\nStill, his mind was vigorous and his body strong, and when thoroughly\r\naroused he was an able speaker; his language was forcible and apt\r\nand his influence over a popular audience was effective.  I disliked\r\nabove all things to be a judge in his case.  I knew some of my\r\nassociates were already against the President, and others were\r\ndecided in his favor.  I resolutely made up my mind, so far as\r\nhuman nature would admit, to fairly hear and impartially consider\r\nall the evidence produced and all the arguments made.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the President were Henry Stanbery, B. R. Curtis,\r\nJeremiah S. Black, William M. Evarts, William S. Groesbeck, and\r\nThomas A. R. Nelson.  The managers on the part of the House of\r\nRepresentatives were John A. Bingham, George S. Boutwell, James F.\r\nWilson, John A. Logan, Thomas Williams, Benjamin F. Butler and\r\nThaddeus Stevens.  The trial lasted nearly two months, was ably\r\nconducted on both sides, and ended by the acquittal of the President,\r\non the eleventh article of impeachment, by a vote of 35 guilty and\r\n19 not guilty.  Two-thirds of those voting not having pronounced\r\n\"guilty,\" as required by the constitution, the President was\r\nacquitted upon this article.  Two other articles were voted on with\r\nthe same result.  Thereupon, on the 26th day of May, 1868, the\r\nSenate sitting as a court of impeachment adjourned without day.\r\nMr. Stanton resigned and General Schofield became Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI voted for conviction for the reasons stated in the opinion given\r\nby me.  I have carefully reviewed this opinion and am entirely\r\ncontent with it.  I stated in the beginning my desire to consider\r\nthe case without bias or feeling.  I quote in full the opening\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\"This cause must be decided upon the reasons and presumptions which\r\nby law apply to all other criminal accusations.  Justice is blind\r\nto the official station of the respondent, and to the attitude of\r\nthe accusers speaking in the name of all the people of the United\r\nStates.  It only demands of the Senate the application to this cause\r\nof the principles and safeguards provided for every human being\r\naccused of crime.  For the proper application of these principles\r\nwe ourselves are on trial before the bar of public opinion.  The\r\nnovelty of this proceeding, the historical character of the trial,\r\nand the grave interests involved, only deepen the obligation of\r\nthe special oath we have taken to do impartial justice according\r\nto the constitution and laws.\r\n\r\n\"And this case must be tried upon the charges now made by the House\r\nof Representatives.  We cannot consider other offenses.  An appeal\r\nis made to the conscience of each Senator of guilty or not guilty\r\nby the President of eleven specific offenses.  In answering this\r\nappeal a Senator cannot justify himself by public opinion, or by\r\npolitical, personal, or partisan demands, or even grave considerations\r\nof public policy.  His conscientious conviction of the truth of\r\nthese charges is the only test that will justify a verdict of\r\nguilty.  God forbid that any other shall prevail here.  In forming\r\nthis conviction we are not limited merely to the rules of evidence,\r\nwhich, by the experience of ages, have been found best adapted to\r\nthe trial of offenses in the double tribunal of court and jury,\r\nbut we may seek light from history, from personal knowledge, and\r\nfrom all sources that will tend to form a conscientious conviction\r\nof the truth.  And we are not bound to technical definitions of\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\"A willful violation of the law, a gross and palpable breach of\r\nmoral obligations tending to unfit an officer for the proper\r\ndischarge of his office, or to bring the office into public contempt\r\nand derision, is, when charged and proven, an impeachable offense.\r\nAnd the nature and criminality of the offense may depend on the\r\nofficial character of the accused.  A judge would be held to higher\r\nofficial purity, and an executive officer to a stricter observance\r\nof the letter of the law.  The President, bound as a citizen to\r\nobey the law, and specially sworn to execute the law, may properly,\r\nin his high office as chief magistrate, be held to a stricter\r\nresponsibility than if his example was less dangerous to the public\r\nsafety.  Still, to justify the conviction of the President there\r\nmust be specific allegations of some crime or misdemeanor involving\r\nmoral turpitude, gross misconduct, or a willful violation of law,\r\nand the proof must be such as to satisfy the conscience of the\r\ntruth of the charge.\r\n\r\n\"The principal charges against the President are that he willfully\r\nand purposely violated the constitution and the laws, in the order\r\nfor the removal of Mr. Stanton, and in the order for the appointment\r\nof General Thomas as Secretary of War _ad interim_.  These two\r\norders were contemporaneous--part of the same transaction--but are\r\ndistinct acts, and are made the basis of separate articles of\r\nimpeachment.\"\r\n\r\nI stated the grounds of my conviction that the action of the\r\nPresident, in placing Lorenzo Thomas in charge of the office of\r\nSecretary of War, without the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nwas a clearly illegal act, committed for the purpose of obtaining\r\ncontrol of that office.  I held that the President had the power\r\nto remove Secretary Stanton, but that he had not the power to put\r\nanyone in his place unless the person appointed was confirmed by\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nDid the act of March 2, 1867, commonly known as the \"tenure of\r\noffice act,\" confer this authority?  On the contrary, it plainly\r\nprohibits all temporary appointments except as specially provided\r\nfor.  The third section repeats the constitutional authority of\r\nthe President to fill all vacancies happening during the recess of\r\nthe Senate by death or resignation, and provides that if no\r\nappointment is made during the following session to fill such\r\nvacancy, the office shall remain in abeyance until an appointment\r\nis duly made and confirmed, and provision is made for the discharge\r\nof the duties of the office in the meantime.  The second session\r\nprovides for the suspension of an officer during the recess, and\r\nfor a temporary appointment _during the recess_.  This power was\r\nexercised and fully exhausted by the suspension of Mr. Stanton\r\nuntil restored by the Senate, in compliance with the law.  No\r\nauthority whatever is conferred by this act for any temporary\r\nappointment during the session of the Senate, but, on the contrary,\r\nsuch an appointment is plainly inconsistent with the act, and could\r\nnot be inferred or implied for it.  The sixth section further\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n\"That every removal, appointment, or employment, made, had, or\r\nexercised, contrary to the provisions of this act, and the making,\r\nsigning, sending, countersigning, or issuing of any commission or\r\nletter of authority for, or in respect to, any such appointment or\r\nemployment, shall be deemed, and are hereby declared to be, high\r\nmisdemeanors, and, upon trial and conviction thereof, every person\r\nguilty thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $10,000,\r\nor by imprisonment not exceeding five years, or both said punishments,\r\nin the discretion of the court.\"\r\n\r\nThis language is plain, explicit, and was inserted not only to\r\nprohibit all temporary appointments except during the recess, and\r\nin the mode provided for in the second section, but the unusual\r\ncourse was taken of affixing a penalty to a law defining the official\r\nduty of the President.  The original bill did not contain penal\r\nclauses; but it was objected in the Senate that the President had\r\nalready disregarded mandatory provisions of law, and would this;\r\nand therefore, after debate, these penal sections were added to\r\nsecure obedience to the law, and to give to it the highest sanction.\r\n\r\nI quote my view of the action of the President:\r\n\r\n\"Was not this act willfully violated by the President during the\r\nsession of the Senate?\r\n\r\n\"It appears, from the letter of the President to General Grant,\r\nfrom his conversation with General Sherman, and from his answer,\r\nthat he had formed a fixed resolve to get rid of Mr. Stanton, and\r\nfill the vacancy without the advice of the Senate.  He might have\r\nsecured a new Secretary of War by sending a proper nomination to\r\nthe Senate.  This he neglected and refused to do.  He cannot allege\r\nthat the Senate refused to relieve him from an obnoxious minister.\r\nHe could not say that the Senate refused to confirm a proper\r\nappointee, for he would make no appointment to them.  The Senate\r\nhad declared that the reasons assigned for suspending Mr. Stanton\r\ndid not make the case required by the tenure of office act, but I\r\naffirm as my conviction that the Senate would have confirmed any\r\none of a great number of patriotic citizens if nominated to the\r\nSenate.  I cannot resist the conclusion, from the evidence before\r\nus, that he was resolved to obtain a vacancy in the department of\r\nwar in such a way that he might fill the vacancy by an appointment\r\nwithout the consent of the Senate, and in violation of the constitution\r\nand the law.  This was the purpose of the offer to General Sherman.\r\nThis was the purpose of the appointment of General Thomas.  If he\r\nhad succeeded as he hoped, he could have changed his temporary\r\nappointment at pleasure, and thus have defied the authority of the\r\nSenate and the mandatory provisions of the constitution and the\r\nlaw.  I cannot in any other way account for his refusal to send a\r\nnomination to the Senate until after the appointment of General\r\nThomas.  The removal of Mr. Stanton by a new appointment, confirmed\r\nby the Senate, would have complied with the constitution.  The\r\nabsolute removal of Mr. Stanton would have created a temporary\r\nvacancy, but the Senate was in session to share in the appointment\r\nof another.  An _ad interim_ appointment, without authority of law,\r\nduring the session of the Senate, would place the department of\r\nwar at his control in defiance fo the Senate and the law, and would\r\nhave set an evil example, dangerous to the public safety--one which,\r\nif allowed to pass unchallenged, would place the President above\r\nand beyond the law.\r\n\r\n\"The claim now made, that it was the sole desire of the President\r\nto test the constitutionality of the tenure of office act, is not\r\nsupported by reason or by proof.  He might, in August last, or at\r\nany time since, without an _ad interim_ appointment, have tested\r\nthis law by a writ of _quo warranto_.  He might have done so by an\r\norder of removal, and a refusal of Mr. Stanton's requisitions.  He\r\nmight have done so by assigning a head of department to the place\r\nmade vacant by the order of removal.  Such was not his purpose or\r\nexpectation.  He expected by the appointment of General Sherman at\r\nonce to get possession of the war department, so when General Thomas\r\nwas appointed there was no suggestion of a suit at law, until the\r\nunexpected resistance of Mr. Stanton, supported by the action of\r\nthe Senate, indicated that as the only way left.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey, by extracts, a correct idea of a carefully\r\nprepared opinion, but this statement shows my view of the case,\r\nand, entertaining it, I felt bound, with much regret, to vote\r\n\"guilty\" in response to my name, but I was entirely satisfied with\r\nthe result of the vote, brought about by the action of several\r\nRepublican Senators.  There was some disposition to arraign these\r\nSenators and to attribute their action to corrupt motives, but\r\nthere was not the slightest ground for the imputations.  Johnson\r\nwas allowed to serve out his term, but there was a sense of relief\r\nwhen General Grant was sworn into office as President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE FORTIETH CONGRESS.\r\nLegislation During the Two Years--Further Reduction of the Currency\r\nby the Secretary Prohibited--Report of the Committee of Conference\r\n--Bill for Refunding the National Debt--Amounted to $2,639,382,572.68\r\non December 1, 1867--Resumption of Specie Payments Recommended--\r\nRefunding Bill in the Senate--Change in My Views--Debate Participated\r\nin by Nearly Every Senator--Why the Bill Failed to Become a Law--\r\nBreach Between Congress and the President Paralyzes Legislation--\r\nNomination and Election of Grant for President--His Correspondence\r\nwith General Sherman.\r\n\r\nDuring the 40th Congress, extending from the 4th of March, 1867,\r\nto the 4th of March, 1869, the chief subjects of debate were the\r\ncontraction of the currency, the refunding of the public debt, the\r\npayment of United States notes in coin, and a revision of the laws\r\nimposing internal taxation and duties on imported goods.\r\n\r\nEarly in the first session of this Congress, the opposition of the\r\npeople to the policy of contraction, constantly pressed by Secretary\r\nMcCulloch, became so imperative that both Houses determined to take\r\nfrom him all power to diminish the volume of currency then in\r\ncirculation.  On the 5th of December, 1867, Robert C. Schenck,\r\nchairman of the committee of ways and means, reported a bill in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted, etc._, That so much of an act entitled 'An act to\r\namend an act to provide ways and means to support the government,'\r\napproved April 12, 1866, as authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto retire United States notes to an amount not exceeding $4,000,000\r\nin any one month, is hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  _And be it further enacted_, That from and after the\r\npassage of this act the further reduction of the currency by retiring\r\nor canceling United States notes shall be, and hereby is,\r\nprohibited.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill was taken up for consideration on the 7th of December,\r\nand, after a brief debate, with little opposition, passed the House\r\nby the vote of 127 yeas and 32 nays.  It was sent to the Senate,\r\nreferred to the committee on finance, and was carefully considered.\r\nThat committee, with but two dissenting voices, directed me to\r\nreport the bill to the Senate with a single amendment.  On the 9th\r\nof January, 1868, I called up the bill for consideration, and made\r\na brief explanation, in which I said the committee, after full\r\nreflection, had thought proper to recommend the passage of the bill\r\nof the House of Representatives, in substance as it was sent to\r\nus, only changing the phraseology.  I said that the bill contemplated\r\nfurther legislation during that session.  It was understood by all\r\nthat some more comprehensive measures must be adopted during that\r\nsession, but until further legislation there should be no more\r\ncontraction of the currency.  I thus stated the reasons which, in\r\nmy opinion, justified the passage of the bill:\r\n\r\n\"_First_.  It will satisfy the public mind that no further contraction\r\nwill be made when industry is in a measure paralyzed.  We hear the\r\ncomplaint from all parts of the country, from all branches of\r\nindustry, from every state in the Union, that industry for some\r\nreason is paralyzed, and that trade and enterprise are not so well\r\nrewarded as they were.  Many, perhaps erroneous, attribute all this\r\nto the contraction of the currency--a contraction that I believe\r\nis unexampled in the history of any nation.  $140,000,000 has been\r\nwithdrawn out of $737,000,000 in less than two years.  There is no\r\nexample, that I know of, of such rapid contraction.  It may be\r\nwise, it may be beneficial, but still it has been so rapid as to\r\nexcite a stringency that is causing complaint, and I think the\r\npeople have a right to be relieved from that.\r\n\r\n\"_Second_.  This bill will restore to the legislature their power\r\nover the currency, a power too important to be delegated to any\r\nsingle officer of the government.  I do not wish to renew the\r\ndiscussion that occurred here two years ago on the passage of the\r\nlaw of April 12, 1866; but it is still my opinion, as it has been\r\nalways, that the question of the amount of currency ought to be\r\nfixed by Congress.  We have the power to coin money, and to regulate\r\nthe value thereof.  We have coined money in the form of paper money,\r\nand certainly the power of Congress in this respect ought not to\r\nbe delegated to any single officer.  If contraction ought to be\r\nestablished as a policy it should be by Congress, not by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and it is not wise to confer upon any\r\nofficer of the government a power of this kind, which can be and\r\nmay be properly controlled and limited by Congress.\r\n\r\n\"_Third_.  This will strongly impress upon Congress the imperative\r\nduty of acting wisely upon financial measures, for the responsibility\r\nwill then rest entirely upon Congress, and will not be shared with\r\nthem by the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"_Fourth_.  It will encourage business men to continue old, and\r\nembark in new, enterprises, when they are assured that no change\r\nwill be made in the measure of value without the open and deliberate\r\nconsent of their representatives.\r\n\r\n\"These considerations are amply sufficient to justify this measure,\r\nbut it is only preliminary to others of far greater importance that\r\nmust command our attention.  These involve--\r\n\r\n\"1.  The existence of the banking system of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"2.  The time and manner of resuming specie payments.\r\n\r\n\"3.  The mode of redeeming the debt of the United States and the\r\nkind of money in which it may be redeemed; and, in this connection,\r\nthe taxes, if any, that may be levied upon the public creditors.\r\n\r\n\"4.  Such a reduction of our expenditures and taxes as will relieve\r\nour constituents, as far as practicable, from the burdens resulting\r\nfrom the recent war.\"\r\n\r\nThis led to a long debate, which continued until the 15th of January,\r\nwhen the bill, as amended, passed by a vote of 33 years and 4 nays.\r\n\r\nThese decisive votes against contraction definitely settled the\r\npolicy of the government to retain in circulation the then existing\r\nvolume of United States notes.  The disagreement between the two\r\nHouses was referred to a committee of conference, and the conferees\r\nreported the bill in the following form:\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_,\r\n\r\n\"That, from and after the passage of this act, the authority of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to make any reduction of the currency,\r\nby retiring or canceling United States notes, shall be, and is\r\nhereby, suspended; but nothing herein contained shall prevent the\r\ncancellation and destruction of mutilated United States notes, and\r\nthe replacing of the same with notes of the same character and\r\namount.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill was sent to the President, and, not having been returned\r\nby him within ten days, it became a law without his approval, under\r\nthe constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, 1867, I reported from the committee on\r\nfinance a bill for refunding the national debt and for a conversion\r\nof the notes of the United States.  This bill was accompanied by\r\nan elaborate report.  This report was carefully prepared by me,\r\nand met, I believe, the general approval of the committee on finance.\r\nIn that Congress there were but five Democratic Senators, and it\r\nso happened that all the members of the committee on finance were\r\nRepublicans, but these represented widely different opinions on\r\nfinancial subjects.  I undertook, in this report, to deal in a\r\ngeneral way with these topics.  Upon a careful reading of it now\r\nI find but little that I do not approve.  The general policy set\r\nout in this report was subsequently embodied into laws, but the\r\nmeasures relating to refunding the debt and the resumption of specie\r\npayments were not adopted until several years after the date of\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nThe ascertained debt on the first day of December, 1867, as stated\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury, was $2,639,382,572.68, divided\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nDebt bearing coin interest.\r\n5 per cent. bonds, 10-40's, and old fives   $205,532,580.00\r\n6 per cent. bonds of 1867 and 1868 . . . .    14,690,941.80\r\n6 per cent. bonds, 1881  . . . . . . . . .   282,731,550.00\r\n6 per cent. 5-20 bonds . . . . . . . . . . 1,324,412,550.00\r\nNavy pension fund  . . . . . . . . . . . .    13,000,000.00\r\n                                           ----------------\r\n                                          $1,840,367,891.80\r\nDebt bearing currency interest.\r\n6 per cent. bonds  . . . . . . . . . . . .   $18,601,000.00\r\n3-year compound interest notes . . . . . .    62,249,360.00\r\n3-year 7-30 notes  . . . . . . . . . . . .   285,587,100.00\r\n3 per cent. certificates . . . . . . . . .    12,855,000.00\r\n                                           ----------------\r\n                                            $379,292,460.00\r\nMatured debt not presented for payment.\r\n3 year 7-30 notes, due August 15, 1867 . .    $2,855,400.00\r\nCompound interest notes, matured June 10,\r\n  July 15, August 15, and October 15, 1867     7,065,750.00\r\nBonds, Texas indemnity . . . . . . . . . .       260,000.00\r\nTreasury notes, acts July 17, 1861 and\r\n  prior thereto  . . . . . . . . . . . . .       163,011.64\r\nBonds, April 15, 1842  . . . . . . . . . .        54,061.64\r\nTreasury notes, March 3, 1863  . . . . . .       868,240.00\r\nTemporary loan . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     2,880,900.55\r\nCertificates of indebtedness . . . . . . .        31,000.00\r\n                                           ----------------\r\n                                             $14,178,363.83\r\nDebt bearing no interest.\r\nUnited States notes  . . . . . . . . . . .  $356,212,473.00\r\nFractional currency  . . . . . . . . . . .    30,929,984.05\r\nGold certificates of deposit . . . . . . .    18,401,400.00\r\n                                           ----------------\r\n                                            $405,543,857.05\r\n  Total debt   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n                                          $2,639,382,572.68\r\nAmount in treasury, coin . . . . . . . . .  $100,690,645.69\r\nAmount in treasury, currency . . . . . . .    37,486,175.24\r\n  Amount of debt less cash in treasury . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n                                          $2,501,205,751.75\r\n\r\nBesides the amounts thus stated there were large balances due to\r\nloyal states, upon accounts not then rendered or ascertained, and\r\nto individuals for losses sustained during the war.\r\n\r\nThe ascertained debt consisted of twenty different forms of liability,\r\nsome payable in coin and some in lawful money.  Much of this debt\r\nwas due on demand, but the great body of it was payable in from\r\none to twenty years, while the unascertained debt was being stated\r\nfrom time to time and had to be met from accruing revenues.  Nearly\r\n$300,000,000 of debt had been paid out of current revenue since\r\nthe close of the war.  The first recommendation of the committee\r\nwas that the debt should be refunded as rapidly as practicable into\r\nbonds bearing as low a rate of interest as possible, payable in\r\ntwenty or thirty years, but redeemable at the pleasure of the United\r\nStates in five or ten years. This recommendation was based on the\r\nfixed policy of the government to limit the duration of a bond\r\nwithin its lifetime, and thus leave it to the option of the government\r\nto pay its indebtedness and to reduce the rate of interest after\r\na brief period, if the condition of the public revenues and of the\r\nmoney market should enable it to do so.\r\n\r\nHere the question arose whether the bonds known as the 5-20 bonds\r\ncould be paid in lawful money after the period of five years, when,\r\nby their terms, they were redeemable.  These bonds promised to pay\r\nso many dollars.  Other bonds were specifically payable in coin,\r\nand still other bonds were payable in lawful money; that is, in\r\nUnited States notes.  These notes were then at a discount, being\r\nworth in the market about 88 cents in coin.  But the notes were\r\nobligations of the United States, and it was the duty, and then\r\nwithin the power of the United States, to advance these notes to\r\npar in coin.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the committee, I among them, believed that the\r\nUnited States should not take advantage of its own wrong, in not\r\nredeeming its notes in coin, but should either advance these notes\r\nto par in coin, or pay its bonds in coin.  The committee, therefore,\r\nrecommended that both the notes and bonds should be received in\r\nexchange for the funding bonds, and that the notes should be reissued\r\nand maintained at par with coin, and be supported by a reserve of\r\ncoin ample to maintain the notes at par with coin.  In other words,\r\nthe United States would resume specie payments.  The committee\r\nexpressed the opinion that, with the system of taxation then in\r\nexistence, this policy of refunding and resumption could be\r\nmaintained, and that the rate of interest then paid could be reduced\r\nto four or five per cent., and the money then in circulation would\r\nbe kept at par with coin at the cost only of the interest on the\r\nbullion and coin held to meet any notes presented for redemption.\r\nThe committee also recommended that the internal and tariff taxes\r\nbe revised to correct irregularities or defects, and to repeal such\r\nas were oppressive.\r\n\r\nWhile the committee opposed any contraction of the currency it also\r\nopposed any increase of it.  The general theory of the report was\r\nto advance both bonds and notes to par in coin, and to issue bonds\r\nin such form and terms that the government could redeem them, or\r\nrenew them at lower rates of interest.\r\n\r\nThe report states:\r\n\r\n\"Your committee are therefore of opinion that no legal tender notes,\r\nbeyond the amount now limited by law, should be issued under any\r\npressure of financial or political necessity until they are\r\nconvertible into gold and silver.  Our duty is to elevate the\r\n'greenback,' the standard of national credit, to the standard of\r\ngold, the money of the world.  Until then we are not on a substantial\r\nfoundation.  Let us make the dollar of our promise in the pocket\r\nof a laboring man equal to the dollar of our mint.  The rapidity\r\nof the process is a question of public policy.  It may be by\r\ngradually diminishing the volume of currency, or be left at its\r\npresent amount until increased business or improved credit bring\r\nit up to the specie standard.\"\r\n\r\nThe refunding bill was taken up by the Senate on the 27th of\r\nFebruary, 1868, and was fully discussed by me.  After stating its\r\ngeneral objects I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is with this view, and actuated by this principle, that the\r\ncommittee on finance have endeavored to make this a bill of relief,\r\nreducing, if possible, consistent with the public faith, the interest\r\nof the public debt, and giving increased value to United States\r\nnotes.  We have endeavored in this bill to accomplish three results:\r\nFirst, to reduce the rate of interest with the voluntary consent\r\nof the holders of our securities; second, to make a distinct\r\nprovision for the payment of the public debt; and third, to give\r\nincreased value to United States notes, and to provide for a gradual\r\nresumption of specie payments.  All these are objects admitted to\r\nbe of the highest importance.  The only question is, whether the\r\nmeasure proposed tends to accomplish them.\"\r\n\r\nI then quoted the example of the United States and Great Britain\r\nin reducing the rate of interest on public securities.  I do not\r\napprove all I said in that speech.  It has been frequently quoted\r\nas being inconsistent with my opinions and action at a later period.\r\nIt is more important to be right than to be consistent.  I then\r\nproposed to use the doubt expressed by many people as to the right\r\nof the government to redeem the 5-20 bonds in the legal tender\r\nmoney in circulation when the bonds were sold, as an inducement to\r\nthe holders of bonds to convert them into securities bearing a less\r\nrate of interest but specifically payable in coin.  Upon this policy\r\nI changed my opinion.  I became convinced that it was neither right\r\nnor expedient to pay these bonds in money less valuable than coin,\r\nthat the government ought not to take advantage of its neglect to\r\nresume specie payments after the war was over, by refusing the\r\npayment of the bonds with coin.  I acted on this conviction when\r\nyears afterwards the resumption act was adopted, and the beneficial\r\nresults from this action fully justified my change of opinion.\r\n\r\nThe debate on this bill was participated in by nearly every Senator,\r\nand was conceded to be the most comprehensive and instructive debate\r\non financial questions for many years.\r\n\r\nThe bill, as it then stood, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto issue registered or coupon bonds of the United States, in such\r\nform and of such denominations as he might prescribe, payable,\r\nprincipal and interest, in coin, and bearing interest at the rate\r\nof five per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually, such bonds to\r\nbe payable forty years from date and to be redeemable in coin after\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nIt authorized the exchange of the bonds commonly known as the 5-20\r\nbonds for the bonds authorized by that bill.  It also authorized\r\nthe holders of United States notes to the amount of $1,000, or any\r\nmultiple of that sum, to convert them into the five per cent. bonds\r\nprovided for by the bill.  This bill passed the Senate on the 14th\r\nof July, 1868.  It passed the House of Representatives soon after,\r\nwith amendments that were disagreed to by the Senate.  The bill\r\nand amendments were referred to a conference committee which reported\r\na modified bill which passed both Houses and was sent to President\r\nJohnson, but at so late a period of the session that it was not\r\napproved by him and thus failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nThe committee on finance at the next and closing session of that\r\nCongress deemed it useless to report another funding bill, and on\r\nthe 16th of December, 1868, I reported, by direction of that\r\ncommittee, the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved by the Senate_, That neither public policy nor the good\r\nfaith of the nation will allow the redemption of the 5-20 bonds\r\nuntil the United States shall perform its primary duty of paying\r\nits notes in coin or making them equivalent thereto; and measures\r\nshall be adopted by Congress to secure the resumption of specie\r\npayments at as early a period as practicable.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was the foundation of the act \"to strengthen the\r\npublic credit,\" the first act subsequently adopted in General\r\nGrant's administration.  Neither this nor any other financial\r\nmeasure was pressed to a conclusion, as we knew that any measure\r\nthat would be sanctioned by Congress would probably be vetoed by\r\nthe President.  This, however, did not stop the almost continuous\r\nfinancial debate which extended to the currency, banking, funding\r\nand taxation.  The drift of opinion was in favor of resumption\r\nwithout contraction, and funding at low rates of interest on a coin\r\nbasis.  The wide breach between Congress and the President paralyzed\r\nlegislation.  But one vital question had been settled, that no\r\nfurther contraction of the currency should occur; and it was well\r\nsettled, though not embodied in law, that no question would be made\r\nas to the payment of bonds in coin.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was drifting to a sound financial policy, the\r\nPresident and his Secretary of the Treasury were widely divergent,\r\nthe former in favor of repudiation, and the latter in favor of\r\npaying and canceling all United States notes.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson, in his last annual message to Congress, on the\r\n9th of December, 1868, substantially recommended a repudiation of\r\nthe bonds of the United States, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Upon this statement of facts it would seem but just and equitable\r\nthat the six per cent. interest now paid by the government should\r\nbe applied to the reduction of the principal in semi-annual\r\ninstallments, which in sixteen years and eight months would liquidate\r\nthe entire national debt.  Six per cent. in gold would, at present\r\nrates, be equal to nine per cent. in currency, and equivalent to\r\nthe payment of the debt one and half times in a fraction less than\r\nseventeen years.  This, in connection with the other advantages\r\nderived from their investment, would afford to the public creditors\r\na fair and liberal compensation for the use of their capital, and\r\nwith this they should be satisfied.  The lessons of the past admonish\r\nthe lender that it is not well to be over anxious in exacting from\r\nthe borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the bond.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the President wished to apply the interest on the United\r\nStates bonds to the redemption of the principal, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury was pressing for the restoration of the specie standard.\r\nI quote from his report to Congress, made on the same day the\r\nmessage of the President was sent us:\r\n\r\n\"The first and most important of these measures are those which\r\nshall bring about, without unnecessary delay, the restoration of\r\nthe specie standard.  The financial difficulties under which the\r\ncountry is laboring may be traced directly to the issue, and\r\ncontinuance in circulation, of irredeemable promises as lawful\r\nmoney.  The country will not be really and reliably prosperous\r\nuntil there is a return to specie payments.  The question of a\r\nsolvent, convertible currency, underlies all the other financial\r\nand economical questions.  It is, in fact, a fundamental question;\r\nand until it is settled, and settled in accordance with the teachings\r\nof experience, all attempts in other financial and economical\r\nreforms will either fail absolutely, or be but partially successful.\r\nA sound economy is the lifeblood of a commercial nation.  If this\r\nis debased the whole current of its commercial life must be disordered\r\nand irregular.  The starting point in reformatory legislation must\r\nbe here.  Our debased currency must be retired or raised to the\r\npar of specie, or cease to be lawful money, before substantial\r\nprogress can be made with other reforms.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it was manifest that no wise financial\r\nlegislation could be secured until General Grant should become\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Republican national convention met at the city of Chicago, on\r\nthe 20th of May, 1868.  It declared its approval of the reconstruction\r\npolicy of Congress, denounced all forms of repudiation as a national\r\ncrime, and pledged the national good faith to all creditors at home\r\nand abroad, to pay all public indebtedness, not only according to\r\nthe letter, but the spirit, of the law.  It favored the extension\r\nof the national debt over a fair period for redemption, and the\r\nreduction of the rate of interest whenever it could be honestly\r\nmade.  It arraigned, with severity, the treachery of Andrew Johnson,\r\nand deplored the tragic death of Abraham Lincoln.  The entire\r\nresolutions were temperate in tone; they embodied the recognized\r\npolicy of the Republican party, and made no issue on which Republicans\r\nwere divided.\r\n\r\nThe real issue was not one of measures, but of men.  The nomination\r\nof General Grant for President, and Schuyler Colfax for Vice\r\nPresident, upon the basis of reconstruction by loyal men, was\r\nantagonized by the nomination, by the Democratic convention, of\r\nHoratio Seymour for President, and Francis P. Blair for Vice\r\nPresident, upon the basis of universal amnesty, and immediate\r\nrestoration to power, in the states lately in rebellion, of the\r\nmen who had waged war against the government.\r\n\r\nIn this contest, Grant was the representative Union soldier of the\r\nwar, and Seymour was the special representative of the opponents\r\nin the north to the war.  Grant received 197 electoral votes, and\r\nSeymour 72.\r\n\r\nA few hours in advance of the meeting of the national convention,\r\nthere was a great mass meeting of soldiers and sailors of the war,\r\na delegation from whom, headed by General Lucius Fairchild, of\r\nWisconsin, entered the convention after its organization and\r\npresented this resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That as the soldiers and sailors, steadfast now as\r\never to the Union and the flag, fully recognize the claims of Gen.\r\nUlysses S. Grant to the confidence of the American people, and\r\nbelieving that the victories won under his guidance in war will be\r\nillustrated by him in peace by such measures as will secure the\r\nfruits of our exertions and restore the Union upon a loyal basis,\r\nwe declare our deliberate conviction that he is the choice of the\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Union for the office of President of\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was received with great applause.  Henry S. Lane,\r\nof Indiana, leaped upon a chair, and moved to nominate Grant by\r\nacclamation.  This was done without rules and amid great excitement.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I gave to General Grant my cordial and active\r\nsupport.  From the beginning of the canvass to the end, there was\r\nno doubt about the result.  I spoke on his behalf in several states\r\nand had frequent letters from him.  Assuming that his election was\r\nalready foreordained, I invited him to stop with me in Mansfield,\r\non his way to Washington, and received from him the following\r\nautograph letter, which, though dated at Headquarters Army of the\r\nUnited States, was written at Galena, Illinois:\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Army of the United States,}\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., October 26, 1868.   }\r\n\"Dear Senator:--Your invitation to Mrs. Grant and myself to break\r\nour journey east and spend a day or two with you was duly received,\r\nand should have been sooner acknowledged.  I thank you for the\r\ninvitation and would gladly accept it, but my party will be large\r\nand having a special car it will inconvenience so many people to\r\nstop over.  Mrs. Grant too and her father are anxious, when they\r\nstart, to get through to Washington before they unpack.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\r\n\"Hon. J. Sherman, U. S. S.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day he wrote a letter to General Sherman, which was\r\nreferred to me by the latter.  I regard this letter, which exhibits\r\nclosely the cordial relations existing, at the time, between the\r\ntwo men, as of sufficient interest to justify its publication:\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters Army of the United States,}\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., October 26, 1868.   }\r\n\"Dear General:--Your letter inclosing one from your brother was\r\nduly received.  As I did not want to change your determination in\r\nregard to the publication of the correspondence between us, and am\r\ngetting to be a little lazy, I have been slow in answering.  I had\r\nforgotten what my letter to you said but did remember that you\r\nspoke of the probable course the Ewings would take, or something\r\nabout them which you would not probably want published with the\r\nletters.  The fact is, general, I never wanted the letters published\r\nhalf so much on my own account as yours.  There are a great many\r\npeople who do not understand as I do your friendship for me.  I do\r\nnot believe it will make any difference to you in the end, but I\r\ndo fear that, in case I am elected, there will be men to advocate\r\nthe 'abolition of the general' bill who will charge, in support of\r\ntheir motion, lack of evidence that you supported the Union cause\r\nin the canvass.  I would do all I could to prevent any such\r\nlegislation, and believe that without my doing anything the confidence\r\nin you is too genuine with the great majority of Congress for any\r\nsuch legislation to succeed.  If anything more should be necessary\r\nto prove the falsity of such an assumption the correspondence\r\nbetween us heretofore could then be produced.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you that Sheridan should be left alone to prosecute\r\nthe Indian War to its end.  If no treaty is made with the Indians\r\nuntil they can hold out no longer we can dictate terms, and they\r\nwill then keep them.  This is the course that was pursued in the\r\nnorthwest, where Crook has prosecuted war in his own way, and now\r\na white man can travel through all that country with as much security\r\nas if there was not an Indian in it.\r\n\r\n\"I have concluded not to return to Washington until after the\r\nelection.  I shall go very soon after that event, however.  My\r\nfamily are all well and join me in respects to Mrs. Sherman and\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\r\n\"Lt. Gen. W. T. Sherman, U. S. Army.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1871 there was a good deal of feeling against\r\nGrant, and some opposition indicated to his renomination for the\r\npresidency.  Several influential papers had recommended the nomination\r\nof General Sherman, who then, as always afterwards, had resolutely\r\nannounced his purpose not to allow his name to be used in connection\r\nwith the office of President.  This suggestion arose out of the\r\nfeeling that injustice had been done to General Sherman by the\r\nSecretary of War, Mr. Belknap, who practically ignored him, and\r\nissued orders in the name of the President, greatly interfering\r\nwith the personnel of the army.  This led to the transfer of General\r\nSherman from Washington to St. Louis.  General Sherman made no\r\ncomplaint of Grant, who had the power to control the action of the\r\nSecretary of War, but the general impression prevailed that the\r\nfriendly relations that had always subsisted between the President\r\nand General Sherman had been disturbed, but this was not true.  I\r\nhave no doubt that Grant, in the following letter, stated truthfully\r\nhis perfect willingness that General Sherman should, if he wished,\r\nbe made his successor as President:\r\n\r\n  \"Long Branch, N. J., June 14, 1871.\r\n\"Dear Senator:--Being absent at West Point until last evening, for\r\nthe last week, your letter of the 5th inst., inclosing one to you\r\nfrom General Sherman, is only just received.  Under no circumstances\r\nwould I publish it; and now that the 'New York Herald' has published\r\nlike statements from him it is particularly unnecessary.  I think\r\nhis determination never to give up his present position a wise one,\r\nfor his own comfort, and the public, knowing it, will relieve him\r\nfrom the suspicion of acting and speaking with reference to the\r\neffect his acts and sayings may have had upon his claims for\r\npolitical preferment.  If he should ever change his mind, however,\r\nno one has a better right than he has to aspire to anything within\r\nthe gift of the American people.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\r\n\"Hon. J. Sherman, U. S. S.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nBEGINNING OF GRANT'S ADMINISTRATION.\r\nHis Arrival at Washington in 1864 to Take Command of the Armies of\r\nthe United States--Inaugural Address as President--\"An Act to\r\nStrengthen the Public Credit\"--Becomes a Law on March 19, 1869--\r\nFormation of the President's Cabinet--Fifteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution--Bill to Fund the Public Debt and Aid in the Resumption\r\nof Specie Payments--Bill Finally Agreed to by the House and Senate\r\n--A Redemption Stipulation Omitted--Reduction of the Public Debt--\r\nProblem of Advancing United States Notes to Par with Coin.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant entered into his high office without any experience\r\nin civil life.  In his training he was a soldier.  His education\r\nat West Point, his services as a subordinate officer in the Mexican\r\nWar, and as the principal officer in the Civil War of the Rebellion,\r\nhad demonstrated his capacity as a soldier, but he was yet to be\r\ntested in civil life, where his duties required him to deal with\r\nproblems widely differing from those he had successfully performed\r\nin military life.  I do not recall when I first met him, but was\r\nconfident it was before his coming to Washington, in March, 1864,\r\nto take command of the armies of the United States.  His arrival\r\nin Washington then was not generally known until he entered the\r\ndining hall at Willard's hotel.  He came in alone, and was modestly\r\nlooking for a vacant seat when I recognized him and went to him\r\nand invited him to a seat at my table.  He quietly accepted, and\r\nthen the word soon passed among the many guests to the tables, that\r\nGeneral Grant was there, and something like an ovation was given\r\nhim.  His face was unknown, but his name and praise had been sounded\r\nfor two years throughout the civilized world.  His coming to take\r\nfull command of the Union forces was an augury of success to every\r\nloyal citizen of the United States.  His personal memoirs, written\r\nin the face of death, tell the story of his life in a modest way,\r\nwithout pretension or guile.  I am not sure that he added to his\r\nfame by his eight years of service as President of the United\r\nStates, but what he did in subduing the Rebellion will always keep\r\nhis name among those of the greatest benefactors of his country.\r\nHe was elected because of his military services, and would have\r\nbeen elected in 1868 by any party that put him in nomination,\r\nwithout respect to platform or creed.\r\n\r\nHe opened his inaugural address with these words:\r\n\r\n\"Your suffrages, having elected me to the office of President of\r\nthe United States, I have, in conformity with the constitution of\r\nour country, taken the oath of office prescribed therein.  I have\r\ntaken this oath without mental reservation and with the determination\r\nto do to the best of my ability all that it requires of me.  The\r\nresponsibilities of the position I feel but accept them without\r\nfear.  The office has come to me unsought.  I commence its duties\r\nuntrammeled.  I bring to it a conscientious desire and determination\r\nto fill it to the best of my ability to the satisfaction of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"On all leading questions agitating the public mind I will always\r\nexpress my views to Congress, and urge them according to my judgment;\r\nand when I think it advisable will exercise the constitutional\r\nprivilege of interposing a veto to defeat measures which I oppose.\r\nBut all laws will be faithfully executed whether they meet my\r\napproval or not.\r\n\r\n\"I shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend, but none to\r\nenforce against the will of the people.  Laws are to govern all\r\nalike, those opposed as well as those who favor them.  I know no\r\nmethod to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective\r\nas their stringent execution.\"\r\n\r\nAnd closed with these words:\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion I ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout\r\nthe land, and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to\r\ndo his share toward cementing a happy Union; and I ask the prayers\r\nof the nation to Almighty God in behalf of this consummation.\"\r\n\r\nI believe he strictly performed what he thought was his duty, and\r\nif he erred, it was from a want of experience in the complicated\r\nproblems of our form of government.  The executive department of\r\na republic like ours should be subordinate to the legislative\r\ndepartment.  The President should obey and enforce the laws, leaving\r\nto the people the duty of correcting any errors committed by their\r\nrepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the 41st Congress, entitled \"An act to strengthen\r\nthe public credit,\" was introduced in the House of Representatives\r\nby General Schenck, on the 12th of March, 1869, and was passed the\r\nsame day.  It came to the Senate on the 15th of March, and, on my\r\nmotion, was substituted for a similar bill, reported from the\r\ncommittee on finance, and, after a brief debate, was passed by the\r\ndecisive vote of 42 yeas and 13 nays, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That in order to remove any doubt as to the purpose of the government\r\nto discharge all just obligations to the public creditors, and to\r\nsettle conflicting questions and interpretations of the law by\r\nvirtue of which said obligations have been contracted, it is hereby\r\nprovided and declared that the faith of the United States is solemnly\r\npledged to the payment in coin, or its equivalent, of all obligations\r\nof the United States not bearing interest, known as United States\r\nnotes, and of all interest-bearing obligations of the United States,\r\nexcept in cases where the law authorizing the issue of any such\r\nobligations has expressly provided that the same may be paid in\r\nlawful money or other currency than gold and silver.  But none of\r\nsaid interest-bearing obligations not already due shall be redeemed\r\nor paid before maturity, unless at such time United States notes\r\nshall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder, or\r\nunless at such time bonds of the United States bearing a lower rate\r\nof interest than the bonds to be redeemed can be sold at par in\r\ncoin.  And the United States also solemnly pledges its faith to\r\nmake provision, at the earliest practicable period, for the redemption\r\nof United States notes in coin.\"\r\n\r\nIt was approved by the President and became a law on the 19th of\r\nMarch.  Thus the controversy as to the payment of bonds in coin\r\nwas definitely decided.\r\n\r\nBut little else of importance was done by Congress during this\r\nsession.  The usual general appropriation bill for the Indian\r\ndepartment having failed in the previous Congress, a bill for that\r\npurpose was introduced in the House of Representatives and became\r\na law on the 10th of April.  The bill to provide for deficiencies\r\nwas passed on the same day.  A change was made in the tax on\r\ndistilled spirits and tobacco, and provision was made for submitting\r\nthe constitutions of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas to a vote of\r\nthe people.  A number of measures of local importance were passed,\r\nand, on the 10th of April, the Congress adjourned without day.\r\n\r\nThe Senate convened in pursuance of a proclamation of the President\r\nimmediately on the adjournment of Congress, and after a few days,\r\nconfined mainly to executive business, adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe early movements of Grant as President were very discouraging.\r\nHis attempt to form a cabinet without consultation with anyone,\r\nand with very little knowledge, except social intercourse with the\r\npersons appointed, created a doubt that he would not be as successful\r\nas a President as he had been as a general, a doubt that increased\r\nand became a conviction in the minds of many of his best friends.\r\nThe appointments of Stewart and Borie were especially objectionable.\r\nGeorge S. Boutwell was well fitted for the office of Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, to which he was appointed after Stewart was excluded\r\nby the law.  Washburne was a man of ability and experience, but he\r\nwas appointed Secretary of State only for a brief time, and was\r\nsucceeded by Hamilton Fish.  Mr. Fish was eminently qualified for\r\nthe office, and during both of the terms of Grant discharged the\r\nduties of it with great ability and success.  Jacob D. Cox, of\r\nOhio, was an educated gentleman, a soldier of great merit, and an\r\nindustrious and competent Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe impression prevailed that the President regarded these heads\r\nof departments, invested by law with specific and independent\r\nduties, as mere subordinates, whose function he might assume.  This\r\nis not the true theory of our government.  The President is intrusted\r\nby the constitution and laws with important powers, and so by law\r\nare the heads of departments.  The President has no more right to\r\ncontrol or exercise the powers conferred by law upon them than they\r\nhave to control him in the discharge of his duties.  It is especially\r\nthe custom of Congress to intrust to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nspecific powers over the currency, the public debt and the collection\r\nof the revenue.  If he violates or neglects his duty he is subject\r\nto removal by the President, or impeachment by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, but the President cannot exercise or control the\r\ndiscretion reposed by law in the Secretary of the Treasury, or in\r\nany head or subordinate in any department of the government.  This\r\nlimitation of the power of the President, and the distribution of\r\npower among the departments, is an essential requisite of a republican\r\ngovernment, and it is one that an army officer, accustomed to give\r\nor receive orders, finds it difficult to understand and to observe\r\nwhen elected President.\r\n\r\nCongress convened on the 6th of December, 1869.  The chief\r\nrecommendations submitted to Congress by the President related to\r\nthe gradual reconstruction of the states lately in rebellion, to\r\nthe resumption of specie payments and the reduction of taxation.\r\nThe relations of Great Britain and the United States growing out\r\nof the war were treated as a grave question, and a hope was expressed\r\nthat both governments would give immediate attention to a solution\r\nof the just claims of the United States growing out of the Civil\r\nWar.  The message was brief, modest, conservative and clear.  He\r\nclosed by saying that on his part he promised a rigid adherence to\r\nthe laws and their strict enforcement.\r\n\r\nThe most important measure consummated during this Congress was\r\nthe adoption of the 15th amendment of the constitution of the United\r\nStates, declared, in a proclamation of the Secretary of State,\r\ndated March 30, 1870, to have been ratified by the legislatures of\r\ntwenty-nine of the thirty-seven states, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\r\ndenied or abridged by the United States, or by any state, on account\r\nof race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a question of grave doubt whether this amendment, though\r\nright in principle, was wise or expedient.  The declared object\r\nwas to secure impartial suffrage to the negro race.  The practical\r\nresult has been that the wise provisions of the 14th amendment have\r\nbeen modified by the 15th amendment.  The latter amendment has been\r\npractically nullified by the action of most of the states where\r\nthe great body of this race live and will probably always remain.\r\nThis is done, not by an express denial to them of the right of\r\nsuffrage, but by ingenious provisions, which exclude them on the\r\nalleged ground of ignorance, while permitting all of the white\r\nrace, however ignorant, to vote at all elections.  No way is pointed\r\nout by which Congress can enforce this amendment.  If the principle\r\nof the 14th amendment had remained in full force, Congress could\r\nhave reduced the representation of any state, in the proportion\r\nwhich the number of the male inhabitants of such state, denied the\r\nright of suffrage, might bear to the whole number of male citizens\r\ntwenty-one years of age, in such state.  This simple remedy, easily\r\nenforced by Congress, would have secured the right of all persons,\r\nwithout distinction of race or color, to vote at all elections.\r\nThe reduction of representation would have deterred every state\r\nfrom excluding the vote of any portion of the male population above\r\ntwenty-one years of age.  As the result of the 15th amendment, the\r\npolitical power of the states lately in rebellion has been increased,\r\nwhile the population, conferring this increase, is practically\r\ndenied all political power.  I see no remedy for this wrong except\r\nthe growing intelligence of the negro race, which, in time, I trust,\r\nwill enable them to demand and to receive the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe most important financial measure of that Congress was the act\r\nto refund the national debt.  The bonds known as the 5-20's, bearing\r\ninterest at six per cent., became redeemable, and the public credit\r\nhad so advanced that a bond bearing a less rate of interest could\r\nbe sold at par.  The committee on finance of the Senate, on the\r\n3rd day of February, 1870, after more care and deliberation, than,\r\nso far as I know, it has ever bestowed on any other bill, finally\r\nreported a bill to fund the public debt, to aid in the resumption\r\nof specie payments, and to advance the public credit.\r\n\r\nThe first section authorized the issue of $400,000,000 of bonds,\r\nredeemable in coin at the pleasure of the United States, at any\r\ntime after ten years, bearing interest at five per cent.\r\n\r\nThe second section authorized the issue of bonds to the amount of\r\n$400,000,000, redeemable at the pleasure of the government, at any\r\ntime after fifteen years, and bearing interest at four and a half\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe third section authorized the issue of $400,000,000 of bonds,\r\nredeemable at any time after twenty years, and bearing interest at\r\nthe rate of four per cent.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of all these bonds were to be applied to the redemption\r\nof 5-20 and 10-40 bonds, and other obligations of the United States\r\nthen outstanding.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this bill provided for the issue of\r\nsecurities, all of which were redeemable within twenty years, and\r\ntwo-thirds of which were redeemable within fifteen years, so that\r\nif the bill, as reported by the committee on finance, had become\r\nthe law, no such difficulty as we labored under eighteen years\r\nlater, when we had a large surplus revenue, would have existed.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the Senate, in substantially the form reported from\r\nthe committee on finance, by the large vote of 33 to 10, and was,\r\nperhaps, the most carefully prepared of any of the financial measures\r\nof the government.\r\n\r\nIn opening the debate, I called the attention of the Senate to the\r\ngreat advantage the government had derived from making its bonds\r\nredeemable at brief periods, like the 5-20 bonds, the 10-40 bonds,\r\nand the treasury notes.  I also called attention to the fact that\r\nthe same principle of maintaining the right to redeem had been\r\ningrafted in the bill then before the Senate, that the duration of\r\nthe bonds was divided into three periods of ten, fifteen, and twenty\r\nyears, during which time, by the gradual application of the surplus\r\nrevenue, the whole debt might be paid.  This was the bill sent by\r\nthe Senate to the House of Representatives, and if it had been\r\nadopted by the House, there would have been no trouble about the\r\napplication of the surplus revenue, but by common consent it would\r\nhave been used in the speedy extinction of the public debt.\r\n\r\nThe bill was sent to the House of Representatives on the 11th of\r\nMarch, and there seems to have slept for nearly three months without\r\nany action on the part of the House.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June the committee on ways and means reported House\r\nbill 2167, covering the same subject-matters as were contained in\r\nthe Senate bill.  The consideration of this bill was commenced, by\r\nsections, on the 30th of June.  The material part of the first\r\nsection of this bill is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to issue,\r\nin a sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate $1,000,000,000,\r\ncoupon or registered bonds of the United States, in such form as\r\nhe may prescribe, and of denomination of $50, or some multiple of\r\nthat sum, redeemable in coin of the present standard value at the\r\npleasure of the United States after thirty years from the date of\r\ntheir issue, and bearing interest payable semi-annually in such\r\ncoin at the rate of four per cent. per annum.\"\r\n\r\nThus it will be perceived that instead of the three series of bonds\r\nprovided by the Senate, the House proposed to authorize the issue\r\nof $1,000,000,000, redeemable in coin after thirty years from the\r\ndate of their issue, with interest at four per cent.  This difference\r\nin the description of the bonds was the chief difference between\r\nthe propositions of the House and the Senate.  To emphasize this\r\ndifference I quote what was said by the chairman of the House\r\ncommittee, Mr. Schenck, in reporting the bill:\r\n\r\n\"It is a proposition to refund a portion of the public debt of the\r\ncountry at a very much lower rate of interest.  It is a proposition\r\nthat $1,000,000,000 of that debt shall take the form of bonds, upon\r\nwhich the United States will agree to pay only four per cent. per\r\nannum.  But, in order to make those bonds acceptable to capitalists\r\nat home and abroad, further provision is made that the bonds\r\nthemselves shall have a longer time to run, not merely for thirty\r\nyears, but that they shall only be redeemable after thirty years;\r\nthus giving them, without the objections, the advantages which in\r\na great degree attach to a perpetual loan.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill, with a very limited debate, passed the House on the 1st\r\nof July, and then immediately was offered as a substitute for the\r\nSenate bill, and was adopted.\r\n\r\nThose two rival propositions, differing mainly upon the question\r\nof the character of the bonds to be issued, were sent to a committee\r\nof conference, composed on the part of the Senate of Messrs. Sherman,\r\nSumner and Davis.  The chief controversy in the conference was as\r\nto the description of funding bonds to be provided for.  After many\r\nmeetings it was finally agreed that the bonds authorized should be\r\n$200,000,000 five per cent. bonds, $300,000,000 four and a half\r\nper cent. bonds, of the character described in the Senate bill,\r\nand $1,000,000,000 of four per cent. bonds, as described in the\r\nHouse bill.  In other words, it was a compromise which, like many\r\nother compromises, was in its results an injury of great magnitude,\r\nbut it was an honest difference of opinion between the Senate and\r\nthe House, in which, tested by the march of time, the Senate was\r\nright and the House was wrong.  But it was perfectly manifest that\r\nwithout this concession by the Senate to the House, the bill could\r\nnot have passed, and even with this concession, the first report\r\nof the committee of conference was disagreed to by the House,\r\nbecause of certain provisions requiring the national banks to\r\nsubstitute the new bonds as the basis of banking circulation.\r\n\r\nThis disagreement by the House compelled a second committee of\r\nconference, in which the contested banking section was stricken\r\nout, and the bill agreed to as it now stands on the statute books.\r\n\r\nAnd thus thirty-year securities, subsequently at a premium of more\r\nthan twenty-five per cent., were forced into the law by the determined\r\naction of the House.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be an error.  No bonds should have been authorized\r\nthat did not contain a stipulation that the government might pay\r\nthem at pleasure, after a brief period and before they became due.\r\nThis stipulation during the war was inserted in the 5-20 and the\r\n10-40 bonds.  Its wisdom and importance were demonstrated by the\r\nearly substitution of bonds bearing a lower rate of interest for\r\nthe 5-20 six per cent. bonds.  When this precedent was cited, and\r\nits saving to the government shown, it was strongly urged by the\r\nHouse conferees that such a provision would prevent the sale of\r\nbonds, and that there was no probability that bonds bearing less\r\nthan four per cent. could be sold at any time at par.  This was\r\nproven to be an error within a short period, for securities of the\r\nUnited States bearing three per cent. interest have been sold at\r\npar.\r\n\r\nSome years later, Senator Beck, of Kentucky, arraigned me for\r\nconsenting to the issue of bonds running thirty years, but I was\r\nable to show by the public records that I resisted this long duration\r\nof the four per cent. bonds, that the House insisted upon it, and\r\nthat Mr. Beck, then a Member of the House, voted for it.  The same\r\nobjection was made by the Senate conferees to the bonds bearing\r\nfour and a half and five per cent., that no stipulation was made\r\nauthorizing the government to anticipate the payment of these bonds.\r\nUnder the Senate bill the bonds would have been redeemable in a\r\nbrief period, and would, no doubt, have been redeemed by bonds\r\nbearing four, three and a half, or three per cent. interest.\r\n\r\nThe bill, as it passed, authorized the conversion of all forms of\r\nsecurities, then outstanding, into the bonds provided for by the\r\nrefunding act at par one with the other.  The Secretary of the\r\nTreasury could sell the bonds provided for by the refunding act at\r\npar, and with the proceeds pay off the then existing securities as\r\nthey became redeemable.  In the discussion of this bill in the\r\nSenate, on the 28th of February, 1870, I made a carefully prepared\r\nspeech, giving a detailed history of the various securities\r\noutstanding, and expressed the confident opinion that the existing\r\ncoin bonds bearing six per cent. interest, and other securities\r\nbearing interest in lawful money, could be refunded into bonds\r\nrunning for a short period, bearing a reduced rate of interest.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"After a long and memorable debate of over two months in both Houses\r\nof Congress, the act of February 25, 1862, was adopted.  That was\r\na revolutionary act.  It was a departure from every principle of\r\nthe financial policy of this government from its foundation.  It\r\noverthrew, not only the mode and manner of borrowing money, but\r\nthe character of our public securities, and was the beginning of\r\na new financial system, unlike anything that had been ventured upon\r\nby any people in the world before.  This new policy was adopted\r\nunder the pressure of the severest necessities, and only because\r\nof those necessities, and was intended to meet a state of affairs\r\nnever foreseen by the framers of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, it is important to understand the principles of this\r\nact; for this act was the foundation of all the financial measures\r\nduring the war.  It was upon the basis of this act, enlarged and\r\nmodified from time to time, that we were enabled to borrow\r\n$3,000,000,000 in three years and to put down the most formidable\r\nrebellion in modern history.  This act was based upon certain\r\nfundamental conditions.\r\n\r\n\"Extraordinary power was conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto borrow money in almost any form, at home or abroad, practically\r\nwithout limitation as to amount, or with limits repeatedly enlarged.\r\nEvery form of security which the ingenuity of man could devise was\r\nprovided for by this act or the acts amending it.  Under these acts\r\nbonds were issued, payable in twenty years, treasury notes were\r\nissued, certificates of indebtedness, compound-interest notes, and\r\nother forms of indebtedness, with varying rates of interest.  There\r\nwere, however, distinct limitations upon the nature and character\r\nof these loans.  It was stipulated first, that more than six per\r\ncent. interest in gold should not be paid on the bonds issued, nor\r\nmore than seven and three-tenths interest in currency should be paid\r\non the notes issued; and _second, all the loans provided by this\r\nact were short loans_, redeemable within a short period of time at\r\nthe pleasure of the United States.  Thus the gold bonds were\r\nredeemable after five years, the treasury notes were redeemable\r\nafter three years, and all forms of security were within the power\r\nof the United States at the end of five years at furthest.  And\r\nthird, no securities were to be sold at less than par.  Their\r\nunavoidable depreciation was measured, not by the rate of their\r\ndiscount, but by the depreciation of the currency.  We held our\r\nbonds at par in paper money, though at times they were worth only\r\nforty per cent. of gold. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. president, it may be proper to state the reasons for this\r\npolicy.  Short loans were adopted that we might not bind the future\r\nto the payment of usurious rates of interest.  We recognized the\r\nexistence of a great pressing necessity that would tend to depreciate\r\nthe public credit; and we took care, therefore, not to make these\r\nloans for a long period, so as to bind the future to the payment\r\nof the rates which we were then compelled to pay.\r\n\r\n\"We provided for gold interest and gold revenue, to avoid the\r\nextreme inflations of an irredeemable currency.  We wished to rest\r\nour paper fabric on a coin basis, and to keep constantly in view\r\nultimate specie payments.  I believe but for that provision in the\r\nloan act of February 25, 1862, that in 1864 our financial system\r\nwould have been utterly overthrown.  There was nothing to anchor\r\nit to the earth except the collection of duties in coin and the\r\npayment of the interest on our bonds in coin.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, the most important and the most revolutionary principle\r\nof the act of February 25, 1862, was the legal tender clause.  This\r\nwas a measure of imperious and pressing necessity.  I can recall\r\nvery well the debates in the Senate and in the House of Representatives\r\nupon the legal tender clause.  We were then standing in the face\r\nof a deficit of some $70,000,000 of unpaid requisitions to our\r\nsoldiers.  Creditors in all parts of the country, among them the\r\nmost powerful corporations of this country, had refused our demand\r\nnotes, then very slightly depressed.  We were under the necessity\r\nof raising two or three million dollars per day.  We were then\r\norganizing armies unheard of before.  We stood also in the presence\r\nof defeat, constant and imminent, which fell upon our armies in\r\nall parts of the country.  It was before daylight was shed upon\r\nany part of our military operations.  We adopted the legal tender\r\nclause then as an absolute expedient.  Remembering the debate, I\r\nknow with what slow steps the majority of the Senate came to the\r\nnecessity of adopting legal tenders.\"\r\n\r\nThe debt of the United States on the 31st of August, 1866, when it\r\nreached its maximum, amounted to $2,844,649,627.  On the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1870, the debt had been reduced to less than $2,500,000,000,\r\nof which about $400,000,000 was in United States notes, for the\r\nredemption of which no provision was made.  It was the confident\r\nexpectation of Congress, which proved to be correct, that before\r\nthe refunding operations were complete, the debt would be gradually\r\nreduced, so that the sum of $1,500,000,000, provided for in the\r\nlaw, would be sufficient to refund all existing debts, except United\r\nStates notes, into the new securities.\r\n\r\nThe process of refunding progressed slowly, was confined to the\r\nfive per cent. bonds, and was somewhat interrupted by the financial\r\nstringency of 1873.\r\n\r\nBy the act approved January 20, 1871, the amount of five per cent.\r\nbonds authorized by the act approved July 14, 1870, was increased\r\nto $500,000,000, but the act was not to be construed to authorize\r\nany increase of bonds provided for by the refunding act.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 24th of August, 1876, there had been sold, for refunding\r\npurposes, the whole of the $500,000,000 five per cents. authorized\r\nby that act, and on that day Lot M. Morrill, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, entered into a contract for the sale of $40,000,000 of\r\nthe four and a half per cent. bonds authorized by the refunding\r\nact.  By this process of refunding an annual saving had been made\r\nof $5,400,000 a year, by the reduction of interest in the sale of\r\n$540,000,000 bonds.  On the 9th day of June, 1877, I, as Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, terminated the contract made by Mr. Morrill, my\r\npredecessor, and placed on the market the four per cent. bonds\r\nprovided for by the refunding act.  The subsequent proceedings\r\nunder this act will be more appropriately referred to hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe more difficult problem remained of advancing United States\r\nnotes to par in coin.  This could be accomplished by reducing the\r\namount of these notes outstanding, and, thus, by their scarcity,\r\nadd to their value.  They were a legal tender in payment for all\r\ndebts, public and private, except for duties on imported goods and\r\ninterest on the public debt.  As long as these notes were at a\r\ndiscount for coin they could circulate only in the United States,\r\nand until they were at par with coin, coin would not circulate as\r\nmoney in the United States, except to pay coin liabilities.  The\r\nnotes were a dishonored, depreciated promise, the purchasing power\r\nof which varied day by day, the football of \"bulls and bears.\"  In\r\nmany respects these notes were better than any other form of\r\ndepreciated paper money, for the people of the United States had\r\nfull confidence in their ultimate redemption.  They were much better\r\nand in higher favor with the people than the state bank notes which\r\nthey replaced and which were not only depreciated like United States\r\nnotes but had been often proven worthless in the hands of innocent\r\nholders.  They were as good as national bank notes, however well\r\nsecured, for these notes were not payable in coin, but could be\r\nredeemed by United States notes.  Still, with all their defects\r\nthe United States notes were the favorite money of the people, and\r\nany attempt to contract their volume was met by a strong popular\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the gradual reduction of the volume of United\r\nStates notes, urged so strongly by Secretary McCulloch, and provided\r\nfor by the resumption act, met with popular opposition and was\r\nrepealed by Congress.  Under these conditions it became necessary\r\nto approach the specie standard of value without a contraction of\r\nthe currency.  The act to strengthen the public credit, already\r\nreferred to, was the beginning of this struggle.  The government\r\nwas, by this act, committed to the payment of the United States\r\nnotes in coin or its equivalent.  But when and how was not stated\r\nor even considered.  The extent to which Congress would then go,\r\nand to which popular opinion would then consent, was the declaration\r\nthat the \"United States solemnly pledges its faith to make provision\r\nat the earliest practicable period for the redemption of United\r\nStates notes, in coin.\"  Many events must occur before the fulfillment\r\nof this promise could be attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nOUR COINAGE BEFORE AND AFTER THE WAR.\r\nBut Little Coin in Circulation in 1869--General Use of Spanish\r\nPieces--No Mention of the Dollar Piece in the Act of 1853--Free\r\nCirculation of Gold After the 1853 Act--No Truth in the \"Demonetization\"\r\nCharge--Account of the Bill Revising the Laws Relative to the Mint,\r\nAssay Offices and Coinage of the United States--Why the Dollar was\r\nDropped from the Coins--Then Known Only as a Coin for the Foreign\r\nMarket--Establishment of the \"Trade Dollar\"--A Legal Tender for\r\nOnly Five Dollars--Repeated Attempts to Have Congress Pass a Free\r\nCoinage Act--How It Would Affect Us--Controversy Between Senator\r\nSumner and Secretary Fish.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the passage of the act \"to strengthen the public\r\ncredit,\" on March 19, 1869, there was but little coin in circulation\r\nin the United States except gold coin, and that was chiefly confined\r\nto the Pacific coast, or to the large ports of entry, to be used\r\nin payment of duties on imported goods.  Silver coins were not in\r\ncirculation.  The amount of silver coined in 1869 was less than\r\none million dollars and that mainly for exportation.  Fractional\r\nnotes of different denominations, from ten to fifty cents, were\r\nissued by the treasury to the amount of $160,000,000, of which\r\n$120,000,000 had been redeemed, and $40,000,000 were outstanding\r\nin circulation or had been destroyed.  These fractional notes\r\nsuperseded silver coin as United States notes superseded gold coin.\r\nThe coinage laws as they then existed were scattered through the\r\nlaws of the United States from 1793 to 1853, and were in many\r\nrespects imperfect and conflicting.\r\n\r\nThe ratio fixed by Alexander Hamilton, of fifteen ounces of silver\r\nas the equivalent of one ounce of gold, was, at the time it was\r\nadopted, substantially the market ratio, but the constant tendency\r\nof silver to decline in relative value to gold had been going on\r\nfor years and it continued to decline, almost imperceptibly perhaps,\r\nand the legal ratio in France having been fixed at fifteen and a\r\nhalf to one, there was an advantage in shipping gold to that country\r\nfrom this, and consequently very little if any of our gold, even\r\nif coined, came into circulation.  By the act of 1793 foreign coins\r\nwere made a legal tender for circulation in this country, and the\r\nSpanish silver dollar, on which ours was founded, with the 8th or\r\n\"real\" pieces, found great favor.  Singularly enough, in Mexico\r\nand the West Indies, the Spanish population would exchange their\r\ndollars for ours, dollar for dollar, although their pieces, if not\r\nworn, were each three grains heavier.  This led to an exchange of\r\nour dollars for the Spanish ones, which were promptly recoined at\r\nthe mint at a fair profit to the depositor.\r\n\r\nThis put upon the government the expense of manufacturing coins\r\nwith no advantage.  The evil grew so great that in 1806 the further\r\ncoinage of our silver dollars was prohibited by President Jefferson,\r\nin an order issued through the state department, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Department of State, May 1, 1806.\r\n\"Sir:--In consequence of a representation from the director of the\r\nBank of the United States, that considerable purchases have been\r\nmade of dollars coined at the mint for the purpose of exporting\r\nthem, and as it is probable further purchases and exportations will\r\nbe made, the President directs that all the silver to be coined at\r\nthe mint shall be of small denominations, so that the value of the\r\nlargest pieces shall not exceed half a dollar.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, etc.,\r\n  \"James Madison.\r\n\"Robert Patterson, Esq., Director of the Mint.\"\r\n\r\nThe coinage of the silver dollar at our mint was not resumed until\r\n1836.  The small and worn Spanish pieces, being legal tender, also\r\ndrove from circulation our fractional coins coming bright and plump\r\nfrom the mint.  Bank notes and these worn pieces furnished the\r\ncirculation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the currency became so objectionable that in 1830\r\nthe subject was taken up by a special committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, appointed for the purpose.  Three reports were\r\nsubmitted, in one of which the committee stated that of $37,000,000\r\ncoined at our mints only $5,000,000 remained in circulation.  A\r\nbill was submitted to the House fixing the ratio at 15.625 to one,\r\nand was strongly urged.  There appeared no special opposition to\r\nthe measure for a time, but the feeling of opposition to the\r\ncirculation of bank bills had become very strong among the people\r\nand was reflected by the administration.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the opposition to bank bills was headed by Thomas H.\r\nBenton, who openly advocated so changing the coinage ratio that\r\ngold would circulate to the exclusion of the notes, and perhaps\r\nincidentally of silver also.  The matter of providing for silver,\r\nhowever, received little attention.  The ratio was changed to\r\nsixteen to one, John Quincy Adams and Daniel Webster joining with\r\nCalhoun and Benton in bringing it about.  It was well understood\r\nat the time that the operation of this act would banish silver.\r\nThe object of the change was distinctly stated, especially by Mr.\r\nBenton, who said:\r\n\r\n\"To enable the friends of gold to go to work at the right place to\r\neffect the recovery of that precious metal, which their fathers\r\nonce possessed; which the subjects of European kings now possess;\r\nwhich the citizens of the young republics to the south all possess;\r\nwhich even the free negroes of San Domingo possess; but of which\r\nthe yeomanry of America have been deprived for more than twenty\r\nyears, and will be deprived forever, unless they discover the cause\r\nof the evil and apply the remedy to its root.\"\r\n\r\nBy the act of 1834, superadded to by the act of 1837, the ratio of\r\nsixteen to one instead of fifteen to one was adopted.  The result\r\nwas that gold coins were largely introduced and circulated; but as\r\nsixteen ounces of silver were worth more than one ounce of gold,\r\nthe silver coins disappeared, except the depreciated silver coin\r\nof other countries, then a legal tender.  To correct this evil,\r\nCongress, on the 21st of February, 1853, provided for the purchase\r\nof silver bullion by the government, to be coined by it and not\r\nfor the owners of the bullion.  That was the first time the government\r\nhad ever undertaken to buy bullion for coinage purposes.  It provided\r\nfor the purchase of silver bullion and the coinage of subsidiary\r\nsilver coins at the ratio of less than fifteen to one.  No mention\r\nwas made of the dollar in the act of 1853.  It had fallen into\r\ndisuse and when coined was exported, being more valuable as bullion\r\nthan as coin.\r\n\r\nAs the value of the minor coins was less that gold at the coinage\r\nratio, they were limited as a legal tender to five dollars in any\r\none payment.  They were, in fact, a subsidiary coin made on government\r\naccount, and, from their convenience and necessity, were maintained\r\nin circulation.  They were similar to the coins now in use, revived\r\nand re-enacted by the resumption act of 1875.\r\n\r\nIt was not the intention of the framers of this law to demonetize\r\nsilver, because they were openly avowed bimetallists, but it limited\r\ncoinage to silver bought by the government at market price.  They\r\nsaw, in this expedient, a way in which silver could be more generally\r\nutilized than in any other.  Mr. R. M. T. Hunter, an avowed\r\nbimetallist, in a report to the United States Senate, said:\r\n\r\n\"The mischief would be great indeed if all the world were to adopt\r\nbut one of the precious metals as the standard of value.  To adopt\r\ngold alone would diminish the specie currency more than one-half;\r\nand the reduction the other way, should silver be taken as the only\r\nstandard, would be large enough to prove highly disastrous to the\r\nhuman race.\"\r\n\r\nHe evidently did not consider the purchase of silver bullion at\r\nits coinage value by the government, instead of the free coinage\r\nof silver, as monometallism.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the act of 1853, gold in great quantities,\r\nthe produce of the mines of California, was freely coined at the\r\nratio of sixteen to one, and was in general circulation.  If, then,\r\nthe purchase of silver, instead of the free coinage of silver, is\r\nthe demonetization of silver, it was demonetized practically in\r\n1834, and certainly in 1853, when the purchase of silver and its\r\nuse as money increased enormously.  In 1852 the coinage of silver\r\nwas less than $1,000,000.  In the next year the coinage of silver\r\nrose to over $9,000,000, and reached the aggregate of nearly\r\n$50,000,000 before the beginning of the Civil War.  Then, as now,\r\nthe purchase of silver bullion led to a greater coinage than free\r\ncoinage.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of our coinage until the war, like all other\r\ngreat wars in history, drove all coins into hoarding or exportation,\r\nand paper promises, great and small, from five cents to a thousand\r\ndollars, supplanted both silver and gold.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it became necessary to prepare for the coinage of\r\ngold and silver to meet the requirements of the act of 1869, \"to\r\nstrengthen the public credit,\" it was deemed by the treasury\r\ndepartment advisable to revise and codify the coinage laws of the\r\nUnited States.  Mr. Boutwell, then Secretary of the Treasury, with\r\nthe assistance of John Jay Knox, deputy comptroller, afterwards\r\ncomptroller, of the currency, and the officers of the mints of the\r\nUnited States, prepared a complete code of the coinage laws.  It\r\nwas submitted to experts, not only to those in the treasury but\r\nalso to all persons familiar with the subject.  The bill was\r\nentitled, \"An act revising and amending the laws relative to the\r\nmint, assay offices, and coinage of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe law, tested by experience, is conceded to be an excellent\r\nmeasure.  A single provision of the bill has been the subject of\r\ncharges and imputations that the silver dollar was, in a fraudulent\r\nand surreptitious way, \"demonetized\" by this act.  There is not\r\nthe slightest foundation for this imputation.  The bill was sent\r\nto me as chairman of the committee on finance, and submitted to\r\nthe Senate with this letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, April 25, 1870.\r\n\"Sir:--I have the honor to transmit herewith a bill revising the\r\nlaws relative to the mint, assay offices, and coinage of the United\r\nStates, and accompanying report.  The bill has been prepared under\r\nthe supervision of John Jay Knox, deputy comptroller of the currency,\r\nand its passage is recommended in the form presented.  It includes,\r\nin a condensed form, all the important legislation upon the coinage,\r\nnot now obsolete, since the first mint was established, in 1792;\r\nand the report gives a concise statement of the various amendments\r\nproposed to existing laws and the necessity for the change recommended.\r\nThere has been no revision of the laws pertaining to the mint and\r\ncoinage since 1837, and it is believed that the passage of the\r\ninclosed bill will conduce greatly to the efficiency and economy\r\nof this important branch of the government service.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n  \"Geo. S. Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman,\r\n  \"Chairman Finance Committee, United States Senate.\"\r\n\r\nSection 15 of the original bill omitted the silver dollar.  It was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 15.  _And be it further enacted_, That of the silver coin,\r\nthe weight of the half dollar, or piece of 50 cents, shall be 192\r\ngrains; and that of the quarter dollar and dime shall be, respectively,\r\none-half and one-fifth of the weight of said half dollar.  That\r\nthe silver coin issued in conformity with the above section shall\r\nbe a legal tender in any one payment of debts for all sums less\r\nthan one dollar.\"\r\n\r\nSection 18 prohibited all coins except those named, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 18.  _And be it further enacted_, That no coins, either gold,\r\nsilver, or minor coinage, shall hereafter be issued from the mint\r\nother than those of the denominations, standards, and weights herein\r\nset forth.\"\r\n\r\nSpecial attention was called to the dropping out of the silver\r\ndollar, both by Secretary Boutwell and Mr. Knox, and the opinion\r\nof experts was invited and given on this special matter and\r\ncommunicated to Congress.  These sections, in the three years that\r\nthe bill was pending in Congress, were changed either in the House\r\nor Senate in only one or two unimportant particulars.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the report of Mr. Knox were the statements of Robert\r\nPatterson, of Philadelphia, confessedly one of the ablest scientists\r\nand metallists in the United States, in favor of dropping from our\r\ncoinage the silver dollar.  Dr. Linderman, the director of the\r\nmint, made the same recommendation.  In the report accompanying\r\nthe introduction of the bill, under date of April 25, 1870,\r\nComptroller Knox gives the history of the silver dollar and the\r\nreasons for its discontinuance as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The dollar unit, as money of account, was established by the act\r\nof Congress April 2, 1792, and the same act provides for the coinage\r\nof a silver dollar, 'of the value of a Spanish milled or pillar\r\ndollar, as the same is now current.'  The silver dollar was first\r\ncoined in 1794, weighing 416 grains, of which 371¼ grains were pure\r\nsilver, the fineness being 892.4.  The act of January 18, 1837,\r\nreduces the standard weight to 412½ grains, but increases the\r\nfineness to 900, the quantity of pure silver remaining 371¼ grains\r\nas before, and at these rates it is still coined in limited\r\namounts.\"\r\n\r\nHe then says:\r\n\r\n\"The coinage of the silver dollar piece, the history of which is\r\nhere given, is discontinued in the proposed bill.  It is, by existing\r\nlaw, the dollar unit, and assuming the value of gold to be fifteen\r\nand one-half times that of silver, being about the mean ratio for\r\nthe past six years, is worth in gold a premium of about three per\r\ncent. (its value being 103.12) and intrinsically more than seven\r\nper cent. premium in our other silver coin, its value thus being\r\n107.42.  The present laws consequently authorize both a gold dollar\r\nunit and a silver dollar unit, differing from each other in intrinsic\r\nvalue.  The present gold dollar piece is made the dollar unit in\r\nthe proposed bill, and the silver dollar piece is discontinued.\r\nIf, however, such a coin is authorized, it should be issued only\r\nas a commercial dollar, not as a standard unit of account, and of\r\nthe exact value of the Mexican dollar, which is the favorite for\r\ncirculation in China and Japan and other oriental countries.\r\n\r\n\"Note.--Assuming the value of gold to be fifteen and one-half times\r\nthat of silver, the French 5-franc piece is worth about 96½ cents\r\n(96.4784); the standard Mexican dollar 104.90, our silver dollar\r\npiece 103.12, and two of our half-dollar pieces 96 cents.\"\r\n\r\nThe finance committee carefully examined the bill.  We were not in\r\nany hurry about it.  It was sent to us in April, 1870, and was\r\nprinted and sent, by order of the Senate, to everyone who desired\r\nto read it or look over it.\r\n\r\nThat committee was composed of Messrs. Sherman, Williams, Cattell,\r\nMorrill, Warner, Fenton and Bayard.\r\n\r\nThe bill was reported unanimously to the Senate December 19, 1870,\r\nafter lying in the committee room for eight months.\r\n\r\nThe dollar was dropped from the coins in the bill framed in the\r\ntreasury department.  It was then an unknown coin.  Although I was\r\nquite active in business which brought under my eye different forms\r\nof money, I do not remember at that time ever to have seen a silver\r\ndollar.  Probably if it had been mentioned to the committee and\r\ndiscussed it would have been thought, as a matter of course, scarcely\r\nworthy of inquiry.  If it was known at all, it was known as a coin\r\nfor the foreign market.\r\n\r\nNo one proposed to reissue it.  The Pacific coast had six intelligent,\r\nable, and competent Senators on the floor of the Senate.  They\r\nwould have carefully looked out for the interest of silver, if the\r\nbill affected them injuriously.  The authority given in the bill\r\nas it finally passed for coining the so-called trade dollar, met\r\nall the demands of the silver producing states.  But the silver\r\ndollar at that time was worth more than the gold dollar.  California\r\nand Nevada were on the gold standard.\r\n\r\nThe bill was printed over and over again, finally reported, and\r\nbrought before the Senate.  It was debated there for three days.\r\nEvery Senator from the Pacific coast spoke upon the measure.\r\nRepresenting the committee, I presented the questions as they\r\noccurred from time to time, until finally we differed quite seriously\r\nupon the question of a charge for the coinage of gold.  The only\r\nyea and nay vote in the Senate on the passage of that bill, after\r\ntwo days debate, occurred on the 10th of January, 1871.  Those who\r\nvoted in favor of the bill were Messrs. Bayard, Boreman, Brownlow,\r\nCasserly, Cole, Conkling, Corbett, Davis, Gilbert, Hamlin, Harlan,\r\nJewett, Johnston, Kellogg, McCreary, Morton, Nye, Patterson, Pomeroy,\r\nPool, Ramsey, Rice, Saulsbury, Spencer, Stewart, Stockton, Sumner,\r\nThurman, Tipton, Trumbull, Vickers, Warner, Willey, Williams, Wilson\r\nand Yates--36.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the six members of the Pacific coast voted for the\r\nbill after full debate.\r\n\r\nAgainst this bill were Messrs. Abbott, Ames, Anthony, Buckingham,\r\nCarpenter, Chandler, Fenton, Hamiliton, of Texas, Harris, Howell,\r\nMorrill, of Vermont, Pratt, Scott and Sherman--14.\r\n\r\nSo on the only yea and nay vote which was ever taken upon the bill\r\nI voted against it.  It was not on account of demonetizing the\r\nsilver dollar.  I did not do it because of that, but I did it\r\nbecause gold was then only coined for the benefit of private\r\ndepositors; we were not using gold except for limited purposes.\r\nGold was the standard in California, and we thought the people of\r\nthat state ought to continue to pay the old and reasonable rate\r\nfor coinage of one-fifth of one cent to the dollar.  No action was\r\ntaken on the bill in the House of Representatives, and it failed\r\nto pass during that Congress.  At the beginning of the next Congress\r\nthe bill was introduced by Wm. D. Kelley, and reported by him\r\nfavorably to the House of Representatives.  It gave rise to\r\nconsiderable debate, especially the section defining the silver\r\ncoins.  No one proposed to restore the old silver dollar, but the\r\nHouse inserted a coin precisely the equivalent of five francs, or\r\ntwo half dollars of our subsidiary coin, and this franc dollar, as\r\nit was called, was made, like other subsidiary coins, a legal tender\r\nonly for five dollars.  On the 9th of April, 1872, Mr. Hooper,\r\nhaving charge of the bill, called especial attention to the dropping\r\nof the old dollar and the substitution of the French dollar.  He\r\nsaid, on April 9, 1872:\r\n\r\n\"Section 16 re-enacts the provisions of existing laws defining the\r\nsilver coins and their weights, respectively, except in relation\r\nto the silver dollar, which is reduced in weight from 412½ to 384\r\ngrains; thus making it a subsidiary coin in harmony with the silver\r\ncoins of less denomination, to secure its concurrent circulation\r\nwith them.  The silver dollar of 412½ grains, by reason of its\r\nbullion and intrinsic value being greater than its nominal value,\r\nlong since ceased to be a coin of circulation, and is melted by\r\nmanufacturers of silverware.  It does not circulate now in commercial\r\ntransactions with any country, and the convenience of those\r\nmanufacturers, in this respect, can better be met by supplying\r\nsmall stamped bars of the same standard, avoiding the useless\r\nexpense of coining the dollar for that purpose.  The coinage of\r\nthe half dime is discontinued for the reason that its place is\r\nsupplied by the copper nickel five-cent piece, of which a large\r\nissue has been made, and which, by the provisions of the act\r\nauthorizing its issue, is redeemable in United States currency.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was sent to the Senate it, in compliance with the\r\nmemorial of the legislature of the State of California, inserted\r\nin place of the French dollar, of 384 grains of standard silver,\r\na dollar containing 420 grains of standard silver, called the \"trade\r\ndollar.\"  This was urged upon the ground that, as the Mexican dollar\r\ncontained 416 grains, or 3½ grains more than the old silver dollar,\r\nit had an advantage in trade with China and Japan over our dollar,\r\nand that a coin containing a few grains more than the Mexican dollar\r\nwould give our people the benefit of this use for silver.  This\r\ndollar was, in conference, agreed to by the House, but was a legal\r\ntender for only five dollars.  On final action on that bill, the\r\nconferees on the part of the Senate were Messrs. Sherman, Scott\r\nand Bayard.  The amendment of the Senate adopting the trade dollar\r\nwas agreed to by the House, and the bill passed in both Houses\r\nwithout a division.\r\n\r\nThere never was a bill proposed in the Congress of the United States\r\nwhich was so publicly and openly presented and agitated.  I know\r\nof no bill in my experience which was printed, as this was, thirteen\r\ntimes, in order to invite attention to it.  I know no bill which\r\nwas freer than any immoral or wrong influence than this act of 1873.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this bill, the Senators and Representatives\r\nfrom the Pacific coast were in favor of the single standard of gold\r\nalone.  This was repeatedly shown during the debates, but now they\r\ncomplain that the silver dollar was demonetized, and that, though\r\npresent, taking the most active interest in the consideration of\r\nthe bill, they did not observe that the silver dollar was dropped\r\nfrom the coinage.  The public records are conclusive against this\r\npretense.  Mr. Stewart, Senator from Nevada, and all the Senators\r\nfrom the Pacific coast, who took an active part in the debate on\r\nthe bill, must have known of the dropping of the silver dollar from\r\nthe coinage.  It appears from the \"Congressional Record\" that, on\r\nthe 11th of February, 1874, Mr. Stewart said:\r\n\r\n\"I want the standard gold, and no paper money not redeemable in\r\ngold; no paper money the value of which is not ascertained; no\r\npaper money that will organize a gold board to speculate in it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, only a few days after this, on the 20th of February, when\r\nhe was speaking in favor of the resolution, instructing the committee\r\non finance to report a bill providing for the convertibility of\r\ntreasury notes into gold coin of five per cent. bonds, he said:\r\n\r\n\"By this process we shall come to a specie basis, and when the\r\nlaboring man receives a dollar it will have the purchasing power\r\nof a dollar, and he will not be called upon to do what is impossible\r\nfor him or the producing classes to do, figure upon the exchanges,\r\nfigure upon the fluctuations, figure upon the gambling in New York;\r\nbut he will know what his money is worth.  Gold is the universal\r\nstandard of the world.  Everybody knows what a dollar in gold is\r\nworth.\"\r\n\r\nTo review the history of the act of 1873:  It was framed in the\r\ntreasury department after a thorough examination by experts,\r\ntransmitted to both Houses of Congress, thoroughly examined and\r\ndebated during four consecutive sessions, with information called\r\nfor by the House of Representatives, printed thirteen times by\r\norder and broadly circulated, and many amendments were proposed,\r\nbut no material changes were made in the coinage clause from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the controversy.  It added the French dollar\r\nfor a time, but that was superseded by the trade dollar, and neither\r\nwas made a legal tender but for five dollars.  It passed the Senate\r\non the 10th of January, 1871--36 yeas and 14 nays--every Senator\r\nfrom the Pacific coast voting for it.\r\n\r\nIt was introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Kelley,\r\nat the next session.  It was debated, scrutinized, and passed\r\nunanimously, dropping the silver dollar, as directly stated by Mr.\r\nHooper.  It was reported, debated, amended, and passed by the Senate\r\nunanimously.  In every stage of the bill, and every print, the\r\ndollar of 412½ grains was prohibited, and the single gold standard\r\nrecognized, proclaimed, and understood.  It was not until silver\r\nwas a cheaper dollar that anyone demanded it, and then it was to\r\ntake advantage of a creditor.\r\n\r\nIt has always been within the power of Congress to correct this\r\nerror, if error was made; but Congress has refused over and over\r\nagain to do it.  When the controversy arose, in 1878, on the Bland\r\nbill, and the House of Representatives proposed the free coinage\r\nof silver, the Senate rejected it after a deliberate contest, and\r\nsubstituted in place of it what is called the Bland-Allison act,\r\nwhich required the purchase, by the government, of silver bullion\r\nat its market value, and its coinage to a limited amount.  Every\r\neffort has been made, from that time to this, to have the Congress\r\nof the United States pass a free coinage act.\r\n\r\nIf this is done, it will be to secure a cheaper dollar of less\r\npurchasing power, with the view to enable debtors to pay debts,\r\ncontracted on the basis of gold coin, with silver coins, worth,\r\nwith free coinage, less than one-half of gold coins.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing, at this distance of time, the legislation of 1873,\r\nin respect to the coinage of silver, I am of the opinion that it\r\nwas fortunate that the United States then dropped the coinage of\r\nthe old silver dollar.  No one then contemplated the enormous yield\r\nof silver from the mines, and the resulting fall in the market\r\nvalue of silver, but, acting upon the experience of the past, that\r\na parity between silver and gold could not be maintained at any\r\nfixed value, Congress adopted gold as the standard of value, and\r\ncoined silver as a subsidiary coin, to be received and maintained\r\nat a parity with gold, but only a legal tender for small sums.\r\nThis was the principle adopted in the act of 1853, when silver was\r\nmore valuable than gold at the legal ratio.  Silver was not then\r\ncoined into dollars, because it was then worth more as bullion than\r\nas coin.  It was needed for change, and, under the law of 1853, it\r\nwas furnished in abundance.  Similar laws are now in force in all\r\ncountries where gold is the sole standard.  Under these laws, a\r\nlarger amount of silver is employed as subsidiary coins than when\r\nthe coinage of silver was free.\r\n\r\nThe same condition of coinage now exists in the United States.\r\nWhile silver is reduced in market value nearly one-half, silver\r\ncoins are maintained at par with gold at the old ratio, by fiat of\r\nthe government.  It is true that the purchase of silver, under\r\nrecent laws, involved a heavy loss to the government, but the free\r\ncoinage of silver, under the ratio of sixteen to one, would exclude\r\ngold from our currency, detach the United States from the monetary\r\nstandard of all the chief commercial nations of the world, and\r\nchange all existing contracts between individuals and with the\r\ngovernment.  In view of these results, certain to come from the\r\nfree coinage of silver, I am convinced that until some international\r\narrangement can be made, the present system of coinage should\r\ncontinue in force.  This has now became a political, or, rather a\r\nmonetary question, to be decided sooner or later, by popular opinion,\r\nat the polls.  This subject will be further discussed at a later\r\nperiod, when efforts were made to adopt the free coinage of silver\r\nat the old ratio.\r\n\r\nPrior to the meeting of Congress in December, 1870, a controversy\r\nhad arisen between Senator Sumner and Secretary Fish, which created\r\nserious embarrassment, and I think had a very injurious influence\r\nduring that and succeeding sessions of Congress.  Mr. Sumner had\r\nlong been chairman of the committee on foreign relations, and no\r\ndoubt exercised a domineering power in this branch of the public\r\nservice.  Mr. Fish and Mr. Sumner had differed widely in respect\r\nto the annexation of San Domingo and certain diplomatic appointments\r\nand former treaties, among them the highly important English\r\nnegotiations for the settlement of claims growing out of the war.\r\nOn these topics the President and Mr. Sumner could not agree.  Mr.\r\nSumner insisted that the hasty proclamation by Great Britain of\r\nneutrality between the United States and the Southern Confederacy\r\nwas the gravamen of the Alabama claims.  The President and Mr. Fish\r\ncontended that this proclamation was an act of which we could not\r\ncomplain, except as an indication of an unfriendly spirit by Great\r\nBritain, and that the true basis of the Alabama claims was that\r\nGreat Britain, after proclaiming neutrality, did not enforce it,\r\nbut allowed her subjects to build cruisers, and man, arm and use\r\nthem, under cover of the rebel flag, to the destruction of our\r\ncommercial navy.\r\n\r\nThis difference of opinion between the President and Mr. Sumner\r\nled to the removal of John L. Motley, our minister to England, who\r\nsided with Sumner, and unquestionably intensified the feeling that\r\nhad arisen from the San Domingo treaty.\r\n\r\nAs to that treaty it was a conceded fact that before the President\r\nhad become publicly committed to it he had, waiving his official\r\nrank, sought the advice and counsel of Mr. Sumner, and was evidently\r\nmisled as to Mr. Sumner's views on this subject.  The subsequent\r\ndebating, in both open and executive session, led to Mr. Sumner's\r\ntaking the most extreme and active opposition to the treaty, in\r\nwhich he arraigned with great severity the conduct of the naval\r\nofficers, the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Fish and the President.\r\nThis was aggravated by alleged public conversations with Mr. Sumner\r\nby \"interviewers,\" in which the motives of the President and others\r\nwere impugned.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, social relations between the Secretary of State\r\nand Mr. Sumner had become impossible; and--considering human passion,\r\nprejudice and feeling--anything like frank and confidential\r\ncommunication between the President and Mr. Sumner was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nA majority of the Republican Senators sided with the President.  We\r\ngenerally agreed that it was a false-pretended neutrality, and not\r\na too hasty proclamation of neutrality, that gave us an unquestionable\r\nright to demand indemnity from Great Britain for the depredations\r\nof the Alabama and other English cruisers.  And as for the San\r\nDomingo treaty, a large majority of Republican Senators had voted\r\nfor it--though I did not; and nearly all of us had voted for the\r\ncommission of inquiry of which Mr. Wade was the chief member.\r\n\r\nWhen we met in March, it was known that both these important subjects\r\nwould necessarily be referred to the committee on foreign relations,\r\nand that, aside from the hostile personal relations of Mr. Sumner\r\nand the Secretary of State, he did not, and could not, and would\r\nnot, represent the views of a majority of his Republican colleagues\r\nin the Senate, and that a majority of his committee agreed with\r\nhim.  Committees are and ought to be organized to represent the\r\nbody, giving a majority of the members to the prevailing opinion,\r\nbut fairly representing the views of the minority.  It has been\r\nthe custom in the Senate to allow each party to choose its own\r\nrepresentatives in each committee, and in proportion to its numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the Republican conference the first question that arose was as\r\nto Mr. Sumner.  He was the oldest Senator in consecutive service.\r\nHe was eminent not only as a faithful representative of Republican\r\nprinciples, but as especially qualified to be chairman of our\r\nforeign relations.  He had long held that position, and it was not\r\nusual in the Senate to change the committees, but to follow the\r\nrule of seniority, placing Senators of the majority party in the\r\norder of their coming into the Senate and those of the minority at\r\nthe foot of the list.\r\n\r\nIn deciding Mr. Sumner's case, in view of the facts I have stated,\r\ntwo plans were urged;\r\n\r\nFirst--To place him at the head of the new and important committee\r\nof privileges and elections, leaving the rest of the committee on\r\nforeign relations to stand in the precise order it had been, with\r\none vacancy to be filled in harmony with the majority.\r\n\r\nSecond--To leave Mr. Sumner to stand in his old place as chairman,\r\nand to make a change in the body of the committee by transferring\r\none of its members to another committee, and fill the vacancy by a\r\nSenator in harmony with the majority.\r\n\r\nMy own opinion was that the latter course was the most polite and\r\njust; but the majority decided, after full consideration and debate,\r\nupon the first alternative.\r\n\r\nSimon Cameron was next to Mr. Sumner on the list of Republican\r\nmembers of the committee, and, by uniform usage, became its\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nThis affair created feeling in the Senate which it is difficult\r\nnow to realize, but it was decided in a Republican caucus, in which\r\nthere was an honest difference of opinion.  We foresaw, whichever\r\nway it should be decided, that it would create--and it did create\r\n--bad feeling among Senators, which existed as long as Mr. Sumner\r\nlived.  I think it proper to make this statement of my own views\r\nat the time, though by the happening of great events this incident\r\nhas almost passed out of memory.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner died in Washington, March 11, 1874.  He was distinguished\r\nfor his literary attainments, and his strong opposition to the\r\ninstitution of slavery and his severe arraignment of it.  The brutal\r\nattack made upon him by Preston S. Brooks created profound sympathy\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nSOME EVENTS IN MY PRIVATE LIFE.\r\nFeuds and Jealousies During Grant's Administration--Attack on Me\r\nby the Cincinnati \"Enquirer\"--Reply and Statement Regarding My\r\nWorldly Possessions--I Am Elected to the Senate for the Third Term\r\n--Trip to the Pacific with Colonel Scott and Party--Visit to the\r\nYosemite Valley--San Diego in 1872--Return via Carson City and Salt\r\nLake--We call on Brigham Young--Arrival Home to Enter Into the\r\nGreeley-Grant Canvass--Election of General Grant for the Second\r\nTerm.\r\n\r\nI have purposely followed the legislation of Congress on financial\r\nquestions until the passage of the act of 1873, passing over other\r\nevents in my personal history and that of President Grant.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be said that we had a strictly Republican administration,\r\nduring his two terms.  While Republicans were selected to fill the\r\nleading offices, the policy adopted and the controlling influence\r\naround him were purely personal.  He consulted but few of the\r\nSenators or Members, and they were known as his personal friends.\r\nMr. Conkling, by his imperious will, soon gained a strong influence\r\nover the President, and from this came feuds, jealousies and\r\nenmities, that greatly weakened the Republican party and threatened\r\nits ascendency.  This was a period of bitter accusations, extending\r\nfrom the President to almost everyone in public life.  During the\r\nentire period of Grant's administration, I was chairman of the\r\ncommittee on finance of the Senate, and had to act upon all questions\r\nof taxation, debt, banking or finance, and had occasion to talk\r\nwith the President upon such measures, but he rarely expressed any\r\nopinion or took any interest in them.  His veto of the bill to\r\nincrease the amount of United States notes, on the 22nd of April,\r\n1874, was an exception, but on this he changed his mind, as he had\r\nexpressed his approval of the bill when pending.  He was charged\r\nwith being in a whisky ring and with other offensive imputations,\r\nall of which were without the slightest foundation.  General Grant\r\nwas, in every sense of the word, an honest man.  He was so honest\r\nthat he did not suspect others, and no doubt confided in, and was\r\nfriendly with, those who abused his confidence.  It was a period\r\nof slander and scandal.\r\n\r\nI did not escape the general crimination.  I usually met accusations\r\nwith silence, as my accusers were answered by others.  In March,\r\n1871, the Cincinnati \"Enquirer\" contained the following imputation:\r\n\r\n\"We are informed that a gentleman who lately filled a responsible\r\noffice in this city, who has recently returned from Washington,\r\nsays that the Southern Railroad bill would have passed the United\r\nStates Senate if it had not, unfortunately, happened that Senator\r\nSherman had no direct pecuniary interest in it.  In these days,\r\nand with such Congresses, it takes grease to oil the wheels of\r\nlegislation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March I wrote to the editors of the \"Enquirer\" the\r\nfollowing note, after quoting the editorial:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate Chamber,}\r\n  \"Washington, March 12, 1871.  }\r\n\"To the Editors of the 'Enquirer:'\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--Some one, perhaps in your office, sends me the following\r\neditorial, cut from your paper:\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"All I can say in reply is that it contains a falsehood and a\r\ncalumny.  I introduced the bill for the Southern Railroad; am\r\nstrongly in favor of it, and pressed it at every stage as rapidly\r\nas the rules of the Senate and the strong opposition to it would\r\nallow.  This is known by every Senator, and I am quite sure Judge\r\nThurman and Mr. Davis would say so.  I alone took an active interest\r\nin the bill, and at the very moment your editorial was received I\r\nwas pressing a Republican caucus to make it an exception to a\r\nresolution not to take up general legislation at this session.\r\nEveryone familiar with our rules knew that it was the sheerest\r\nfolly to try to pass the bill on the last day of the session,\r\nespecially as against our appropriation bills.  When it does pass\r\nit will take days of debate, and will not receive support from any\r\nof your political associates, who think Kentucky can block up all\r\nintercourse between the north and south.  Still I yielded to the\r\nearnest desire of the trustees to try to get a vote, but failed to\r\nget the floor at 3 o'clock in the morning, the only moment it was\r\npossible to submit even the motion to take it up.  The bill to\r\nabolish the duty of coal was taken up and was not acted on, nor\r\nwould the railroad bill, or any other contested bill, have passed\r\nat that stage of the session.\r\n\r\n\"As to the base imputation you attribute to 'a gentleman who lately\r\nfilled a responsible office in this city,' I can only say that,\r\nwhether it originates with you or anyone else, it is utterly false.\r\nNeither in this nor in any measure that has passed Congress, or is\r\npending, have I had any direct pecuniary interest.  I respectfully\r\nask that you print this, and also the name of the 'gentleman' you\r\nrefer to.\r\n\r\n\"I intend, in the interests of the city of Cincinnati and of the\r\nwhole country, to press the Southern Railroad bill, and to secure\r\nits passage as soon as possible, but it is rather poor encouragement\r\nto read such libels in a prominent paper in your city.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours etc.,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThis was followed by an article in the \"Enquirer\" embodied in my\r\nreply, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, March 20, 1871.\r\n\"Gentlemen:--In your editorial in the 'Enquirer' of March 17, in\r\ncommenting on my card to you as to my action on the Cincinnati\r\nSouthern Railroad bill, you repeat my statement that 'neither in\r\nthis nor in any measure that has passed Congress, or is pending,\r\nhave I any pecuniary interest,' and you say:\r\n\r\n'If this is true, he has certainly been a very badly slandered\r\ngentleman.  Somehow or other there is a popular impression that\r\nMr. Sherman has contrived to make his connection with politics a\r\nhighly lucrative business, and that he has exhibited, since he has\r\nbeen in Congress, a worldly thrift that is remarkable.  There is\r\na further impression that he is now a very rich man, whereas, a\r\nfew years ago, before he was in public affairs, his circumstances\r\nwere decidedly moderate.  Perhaps our senatorial friend may not be\r\naware of the existence of these derogatory reports, and will thank\r\nus for giving him an opportunity, now that he knows of their\r\nexistence, to disprove them.'\r\n\r\n\"I have not been ignorant that there has been a studied effort--\r\nascribed by me to the common tactics of political warfare--to create\r\nthe impression, by vague innuendo, that I have used my official\r\nposition to make money for myself.  I know that this charge or\r\nimputation is without the slightest foundation, and I now repeat\r\nthat I never was pecuniarily interested in any question, bill or\r\nmatter before Congress; that I never received anything in money,\r\nor property, or promise, directly or indirectly, for my vote or\r\ninfluence in Congress or in the departments; that I have studiously\r\navoided engaging in any business depending upon legislation in\r\nCongress.  The only enterprise in which I ever engaged, which rests\r\nupon an act of Congress, is that in 1862, after the bill passed\r\nauthorizing the construction of a street railroad in this city, I,\r\nwith others, openly subscribed stock, and undertook to build it in\r\npursuance of the act of Congress.\r\n\r\n\"From the position assigned me here, I have had to deal with great\r\nquestions involving our financial system of currency, taxes and\r\ndebt, and I can appeal to all my associates in Congress, to each\r\nof the eminent men with whom, as Secretaries of the Treasury, I\r\nhave been intimate, and to every man of the multitude with whom I\r\nhave been brought into contact, to say whether I have ever been\r\ninfluenced in my course by pecuniary interest.\r\n\r\n\"But you say that the impression is that I am a very rich man,\r\nwhereas, before I was in public affairs, my circumstances were\r\ndecidedly moderate.  This allegation contains two gross exaggerations.\r\nWhen I entered public life, I was largely engaged in my profession\r\nand other lucrative business.  If I had not engaged in politics,\r\nI might have been the rich man you suppose.  I am not this day\r\nrelatively richer, considering the changed value of property, than\r\nI was when I entered the Senate.  Some time ago it was stated in\r\nyour paper that I was worth millions.  A very small fraction,\r\nindeed, of one million dollars will cover all I am worth.  My\r\nproperty consists mainly of real estate, palpable to the eye, and\r\nthe rest of it is chiefly in a railroad with which I was connected\r\nbefore I entered public life.\r\n\r\n\"I have managed my business affairs with reasonable care, prudence,\r\neconomy and success.  What I have is the result of this.\r\n\r\n\"You kindly offer me an opportunity to disprove to you these reports.\r\nWell, how can I?  What charge is made against me?  How can I fight\r\nshadows?  How can a man prove himself innocent against an innuendo?\r\n\r\n\"But as you offer me the opportunity, I now invite Mr. Faran to\r\ncome to my home at Mansfield, and I will show him all I possess\r\nthere, and render him a full account of all I have elsewhere, and\r\nif I can't fairly account for it without being suspected of receiving\r\nbribes, or gifts, or stealing, then he can repeat these baseless\r\naccusations with an easy conscience.\r\n\r\n\"You may ask why I have not met these derogatory reports before.\r\nPerhaps I ought, but I feel the humiliation of such a controversy,\r\nand thought it time enough when a specific charge was made.  And\r\nI am told by Mr. Hedges, my former law partner, that in my absence,\r\nlast summer, he corrected some gross misstatements in your paper\r\nabout me, and that you refused or neglected to publish it--even to\r\nnotice it.  As, however, you now, in a courteous way, invite this\r\nletter, I take great pleasure in accepting your offer.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Messrs. Faran & McLean, editors of the 'Enquirer.'\"\r\n\r\nI doubted the policy of my publishing such a letter, or of taking\r\nany notice of so indefinite a charge, but the response from the\r\npress was fair, especially from the \"Shield and Banner,\" a Democratic\r\npaper printed in Mansfield, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We publish a letter of Hon. John Sherman to the editors the\r\nCincinnati 'Enquirer.'  It is hardly necessary that we should say\r\nthat we have no sympathy with the political creed of John Sherman.\r\nBetween him and us there is a vast and wide difference; but we are\r\nnot, we trust, so much of the partisan that we cannot do justice\r\nto a neighbor, if that neighbor differs with us.  We have known\r\nJohn Sherman, not only during all his public life, but from the\r\ntime we became a resident of Mansfield, now covering a period of\r\nthirty years, and we have always known him as industrious, prudent\r\nand careful in his profession, and economical and thrifty in his\r\nbusiness.  We placed very little credence in the rumors that he\r\nwas a man of immense wealth.  His property is mostly in real estate.\r\nHe was fortunate in getting hold of very desirable property in and\r\naround our city, and the advance in that has doubtless given him\r\na competence; but it is folly to charge him with being a millionaire.\r\nWe have, in common with our neighbors, enjoyed his hospitality,\r\nand his style of living is neither extravagant nor ostentatious.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman is one of our townsmen, and although all wrong as a\r\npolitician and statesman, and holding to a creed we utterly\r\ndisapprove, he is a highminded and honorable man, and we are bound\r\nto accept his statement about his pecuniary affairs as true.\"\r\n\r\nI have often since been accused of the crime of \"being rich,\" but\r\nas nearly all my possessions are visible to the naked eye, and\r\ntheir history and acquisition are known to so many, I think I am\r\nnot required to prove that I have not made them as the result of\r\nlegislation or my holding public trusts.\r\n\r\nMy second term in the Senate expired on the 4th of March, 1873.\r\nThe election of my successor devolved upon the legislature that\r\nconvened on the first Monday of January, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe canvass in Ohio, in the summer and fall of 1871, was an active\r\nand exciting one and attracted great interest in other states.\r\nThe result would indicate the strength or weakness of Grant's\r\nadministration.  I felt it was necessary, not only for my re-\r\nelection, but for the success of the Republican party, that every\r\neffort should be made to elect a Republican majority in the\r\nlegislature, and I, therefore, at the state convention and in most\r\nof the congressional districts of Ohio, made earnest speeches in\r\nbehalf of the state ticket and members of the legislature.  I\r\nreceived many letters of encouragement, one of which, from Senator\r\nCarpenter in reference to my speech in the convention, I insert:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., July 20, 1871.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I have just read your speech to the state convention\r\nof Ohio.  _It is splendid_.  The only fault I have to find with it\r\nis, that you have covered the whole ground and reduced us 'lesser\r\nlights' to the necessity of repeating and elaborating.  This is\r\n_very mean of you;_ you might have left some topic of the next\r\ncampaign untouched, for us to dwell upon.  But you have pre-empted\r\neverything and we must follow after.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"Matt H. Carpenter.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislature was elected in October, 1871, but the majority for\r\nthe Republicans was so small that the election of a Republican\r\nSenator was in doubt.\r\n\r\nI received many hearty letters of congratulation on our success in\r\nOhio from my colleagues in the Senate, among them one from Senator\r\nConkling as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Utica, N. Y., October 13, 1871.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Having waited for certainties touching your election\r\nand the legislature, and having watched the canvass with sincere\r\nsolicitude, I congratulate you most heartily upon the result.\r\n\r\n\"Your own speeches have been among the best you ever made, and your\r\ncanvass has been full of the pluck without which no canvass and no\r\npolitical contest is thorough or truthful.\r\n\r\n\"This state is ours unless the people are discouraged from voting\r\nin the country by the belief that with Tammany to count, it matters\r\nnot what majority rolls up above the Highlands.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the grievous statements of the 'Tribune' and inspired\r\nby the 'Tribune,' we have done nothing harsh to the anti-administration\r\nminority, but the least and mildest thing which would prevent a\r\nsplit in our organization with trouble for the future, and probably\r\na double delegation in the next national convention.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours sincerely,\r\n  \"Roscoe Conkling.\"\r\n\r\nIt was conceded that a decided majority of the Republican members\r\nof the legislature were in favor of my re-election, but it was\r\nbelieved that an effort would be made by five Republican members\r\nto combine with the Democratic members and thus secure the election\r\nof ex-Governor Jacob D. Cox.\r\n\r\nA Republican legislative caucus was convened on the evening of\r\nJanuary 4th, to nominate a candidate.  The first and informal ballot\r\ngave me 61 votes to 14 scattering and the second ballot 71 votes\r\nto 4 scattering.  This settled the matter unless the few dissenting\r\nvotes could combine with the solid Democratic vote upon some other\r\ncandidate.  It was soon found that this attempt would be abortive,\r\nas several Democrats, and especially those from Richland and\r\nFairfield counties, would vote for me it the choice came between\r\nCox and myself.  Every effort was made by General Ashley and the\r\nfew others who were opposed to my nomination to combine upon anyone\r\nwho could defeat me.  They offered their support to Governor Hayes,\r\nbut this was promptly refused by him.  The same effort was made\r\nwith Governor Dennison, General Garfield and General Schenck, and\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThe joint convention for the election of a Senator was held on the\r\nsecond Tuesday of January.  It was an open meeting.  The voting\r\nwas soon over on roll call, and the result was as follows:  Sherman\r\n73; Morgan 64; Cox 1; Schenck 1; Perry 1.  Thus I was elected by\r\nsix majority over all.  When this result was known five Democrats\r\nchanged from Morgan to Cox, and others were preparing to do so when\r\nLieutenant Governor Mueller announced the result of the vote.  He\r\nwas an educated German of high standing, but his English was very\r\nimperfect.  His decision that I, having received a majority of the\r\nvotes cast, was duly elected, was clearly right, and this was\r\nconceded, but his imperfect English created great noise and merriment.\r\nIt was printed in the \"Ohio Statesman,\" on the same day, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"John Sherman, having received seventy-three votes for President\r\nin Congress [laughter], I mean for Senator in Congress, which being\r\na majority over all them others, I declares John Sherman duly\r\nelected Senator in Congress from Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nIf the changing of the minority vote had proceeded, some of the\r\nDemocratic votes would have been cast for me, and my majority would\r\nhave been increased, but I preferred the election as it occurred.\r\nMy election for the third term was after a hot political contest,\r\nbut it left no wounds unhealed.  Most of the gentlemen opposed to\r\nme became afterwards my warm friends.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1872, two months after the close of the session of Congress,\r\nI received the following letter from Thomas A. Scott, President of\r\nthe Texas and Pacific Railroad Company:\r\n\r\n  \"Philadelphia, July 19, 1872.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--A few gentlemen connected with the Texas and Pacific\r\nroad, and myself, propose to go to the Pacific coast, leaving\r\nPhiladelphia about the 12th to the 15th of August.\r\n\r\n\"If your engagements will permit, I shall be very glad indeed to\r\nhave you go with us.\r\n\r\n\"I am going from San Francisco to San Diego, and shall return by\r\nway of San Francisco; the trip will occupy about thirty days.\r\n\r\n\"Please let me hear from you, and, if possible, let me have the\r\npleasure of your company.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"Thomas A. Scott, President.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted the invitation, and with a very agreeable party of ladies\r\nand gentlemen, among whom were Mr. W. T. Walters, of Baltimore,\r\nand his daughter, made my first voyage to the Pacific coast.  Mr.\r\nScott, as president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, had\r\ncommand, by courtesy, of every convenience of travel.  We had a\r\ndining car which we could attach to any train, with ample room for\r\nbeds, and a full supply of provisions.  The journey to San Francisco\r\nwas broken by several stops on the way at places that we thought\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nGreat changes had occurred in the brief period since my trip in an\r\nambulance with General Sherman.  The Indians and buffaloes had\r\ndisappeared from the plains, the former placed on reservations\r\ndistant from the railroad, and the latter by gradual extinction.\r\nWhen we crossed the Laramie plains I was in, to me, a \"terra\r\nincognita.\"  The great basin of Salt Lake, with the varied and\r\npicturesque scenery to the east and west of it, attracted our\r\nattention, but the want of water, the dry air, the dust and the\r\nabsence of tress and vegetation of any kind, condemn all that\r\ncountry to waste and desolation, except in a few places where\r\nirrigation can be had.  The Nevada range of mountains was crossed\r\nat night, but we were to explore them on our return.  When the\r\nbroad valley of the Sacramento opened to our view, we could hardly\r\nexpress our delight.  Here, indeed, was the land of gold, with its\r\nclear air, its grand mountains, its rich plains.\r\n\r\nAside from the wonderful variety of its scenery, the history of\r\nCalifornia has always excited poetic interest--its long settlement\r\nby mixed races living in quiet peaceful harmony, mainly as herdsmen\r\nand shepherds, suddenly disturbed and conquered without firing a\r\ngun, by an aggressive race who soon revolutionized the habits of\r\nthe natives, and planted a new civilization, with all the bad as\r\nwell as the good elements of our race.  Then the discovery of gold,\r\nimmediately following the conquest of California, drew to it, from\r\nall parts of the United States, the most restless and adventurous\r\nof our population, some of the worst and many of the best.  The\r\nrapid admixture of these diverse elements threatened for a time\r\nhostile conflicts, in which criminals, under cover of law, committed\r\nmurder and other crimes, and peaceful, law-abiding citizens were\r\ncompelled to appeal to force and mob law to preserve civilization.\r\n\r\nThe railway soon brought us through Sacramento to San Francisco,\r\nwhere we remained several days.  We were kindly received and\r\nentertained.  The enterprise of Scott was not then favored in San\r\nFrancisco, but this did not prevent our hearty welcome.  Here I\r\nmet Mr. Hollister, whom I had known in Ohio.  He was the great\r\nshepherd of California.  I was informed that he owned 100,000 sheep,\r\ndivided into flocks of about 3,000 each.  These flocks were wintered\r\nat a large ranch near the Pacific coast belonging to him.  The\r\nclimate was mild, and the sheep could live without shelter during\r\nthe winter.  The flocks would start eastwardly over the great\r\nvalley, each flock cared for by a shepherd, a boy and a dog, feeding\r\nin the open country, some of the flocks reaching the Mariposa\r\nvalley, one hundred miles away.  When the grass failed they were\r\nturned to the west to their home.  Whether this tale is an exaggeration\r\nI cannot say, but certain it is that at that time sheep raising\r\nand the production of wool was one of the chief industries of\r\nCalifornia.  Hollister was also interested in woolen manufacture,\r\nespecially of blankets, equal to any in the world.  When I knew\r\nhim in Ohio, he and his brother were the owners, by inheritance,\r\nof a large and valuable farm in Licking county.  When gold was\r\ndiscovered in California, Hollister sold to his brother one-half\r\nof the farm, and with the proceeds purchased a large flock of the\r\nbest Ohio sheep, and drove them to California, taking two years\r\nfor the journey.  He was fond of telling his adventures, and proud\r\nof his success.  He died a few years since in California, but\r\nwhether his good fortune followed him to the close of his life I\r\ndo not know.  He was very kind to our party and accompanied us to\r\nSan Diego.\r\n\r\nFrom San Francisco we made a trip to the Mariposa Grove, and the\r\nYosemite valley.  We traveled by rail to a small station nearest\r\nthe grove.  Then by stage we rode to the terminus of the line.\r\nFrom there we went but a short distance to the grove.  This majestic\r\nsurvivor of the forest has been so often been described that details\r\nare not necessary.  We measured the trees, and rode on horseback\r\nnearly one hundred feet through one of the fallen monsters.  We\r\nalso attempted to form a ring with hands and arms extended around\r\none of these trees, but our party was not numerous enough to encircle\r\nit.  I felt a sense of insignificance when I realized the long life\r\nof some of these trees, estimated to span forty generations of men,\r\nand still in health and strength.  We returned to the stage station\r\nand again mounted our horses and mules for the perilous adventure\r\nof a descent into the Yosemite valley.  It so happened that Mr.\r\nBell, the keeper of the station, was a former resident of Bellville,\r\nin Richland county, Ohio, in which I live.  He knew me well, and\r\nhis wife I knew as the daughter of a leading farmer of that county.\r\nI thought I might utilize this acquaintance by asking him to see\r\nthat I was well mounted to descend to the valley.  Much to my\r\nsurprise a spirited horse, well accoutered, was brought out for\r\nColonel Scott, and a shaggy short-legged mule, with a California\r\nsaddle and a common but stout bridle, was brought out for me.  I\r\nfelt that Bell had disregarded the obligation of \"auld acquaintance,\"\r\nbut said nothing.\r\n\r\nMy mount started at the heels of the cavalcade in a steady walk,\r\nbut I noticed he was sure-footed, and that, at the end of two or\r\nthree weary hours, he had passed most of the party and soon after\r\nwas close in the wake of Colonel Scott.  In the meantime, I had\r\nnoticed that I was the subject of merriment.  My feet were in close\r\nproximity to the ground.  The length of my legs was out of proportion\r\nto that of the legs of the mule.  When we came to descend the\r\nmountain, however, at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, on a\r\nvery narrow path, I found that my mule could turn the bends of the\r\ntrack, and, by a peculiar gathering of his feet, could slide down\r\ndifficult places, while Colonel Scott, on his already jaded horse,\r\nwas troubled and worried.  He dismounted when the path widened and\r\nasked me to go ahead.  He then followed me, leading his horse.\r\nAfter that, I made up my mind that my Richland county friend had\r\nnot failed me in my hour of need.\r\n\r\nAs for the scenery through which we were passing, no language could\r\ndescribe it.  We saw, four thousand feet below, a beautiful little\r\nvalley about half a mile wide at the widest part, with what appeared\r\nto be a very small stream dancing along from side to side of the\r\nvalley, and surrounded by precipitous mountains in every direction.\r\nThe eye and mind can now vividly recall the picture of the scenes\r\nthan around me.  My mule had my confidence, but I feared lest some\r\nfatal mishap might befall some of my companions, and especially I\r\nfeared for a lady who ventured the journey, but she fortunately\r\ndisplayed pluck and coolness, and at the end of the day we all\r\narrived at the hut in the valley safe and sound, but very weary.\r\nSince that time, I understand that a good road has been made up\r\nthe valley, by which tourists can enjoy the grandest scenery in\r\nnature, without the risk we took.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed a hearty supper of plain food, and a sound sleep on corn-\r\nhusk mattresses.  The next day we explored the valley, and enjoyed\r\nthe changing views of near and distant mountains.  These have often\r\nbeen described, but they can only be appreciated by a personal\r\nvisit.  We left the valley by another route to the north, and\r\nreached the railroad by a different line of stages.\r\n\r\nReturning to San Francisco, we took the boat for San Diego, stopping,\r\non the way, at Santa Barbara and San Pedro.  From this place we\r\ndrove to Los Angeles, then a typical Mexican town of great interest.\r\nThe good people hoped for the railroad, but Colonel Scott expected\r\nthe road of which he was president would be able to reach San Diego.\r\n\r\nOur arrival at San Diego was an event of interest to the few people\r\nof that town.  We inspected the remarkable harbor and the surrounding\r\ncountry.  It was apparently a good site for a great city.  Fresh\r\nwater was the great want and rain-falls were rare, but it was\r\nclaimed that an ample supply of water could be had from the hills.\r\nThe real obstacle to that site, as a terminus for the railroad,\r\nwas the mountains east of San Diego, which, upon a survey, were\r\nfound to be extremely difficult, and this turned the route to Los\r\nAngeles, over natural passes and through the beautiful region of\r\nSan Bernardino.\r\n\r\nWe returned, by boat, to San Francisco, and soon after turned our\r\nway eastward.  We stopped at Reno, and went by rail to Carson City,\r\nthe capital of Nevada.  It was then an embryo town.  From there we\r\nwent to Lake Tahoe, one of the finest bodies of water on the earth.\r\nIts clear, cold waters filled a natural basin in the midst of the\r\nNevada range of mountains, which was supplied by the melting snows.\r\nWe then returned to Carson City, ascended, by rail, an inclined\r\nplane of high grade, to Virginia City.  Most of the party descended\r\ninto the mines, but I was prevented from doing so by an attack of\r\nneuralgia, a complaint from which I never suffered before or since,\r\ncaused, as it was said, by the high altitude and thin air.  Here\r\nI met several natives of Ohio, who had sought their fortunes in\r\nthe far west.  They were very kind to the party and to myself.  It\r\ngot to be a common remark, that Ohio has everything good in the\r\nwest.  I could answer that they all seemed to deserve what they\r\nhad.  I was disposed to be proud of them and of my native state,\r\nbut soon after, on the way east, we heard of an atrocious murder\r\ncommitted by two Ohio men.  This turned the tables on my native\r\nstate, and I was compelled to confess that bad men came from Ohio\r\nas well as from other states; but, if so, Ohio people excelled in\r\nthe atrocity of their crimes as well as in the excellence of their\r\nmerits!\r\n\r\nOur next stopping place was at Salt Lake City.  Whatever opinion\r\nwe may have of the religious creed and dogmas of the Mormons, we\r\ncannot deny the industry and courage of that sect in building up\r\na city in a wilderness where natural conditions seemed to forbid\r\nall hope of success in such an enterprise.  And yet there it was,\r\na well-ordered city laid out with squares, avenues, streets, and\r\nreservations for schools, churches and other public uses, with\r\nwater introduced in great abundance.  All the needs of city life\r\nwere provided, such as stores, markets and shops.  We were invited\r\nby the delegate to Congress, from Utah, to call on Brigham Young,\r\nand did so.  He was a large, well-built man, then about sixty years\r\nold.  He took great interest in the enterprise of Colonel Scott\r\nand seemed familiar with all the railways built or projected in\r\nthe western country.  There was nothing in his conversation or\r\nmanner that indicated the \"crank,\" nor did he exhibit any of the\r\nsigns of a zealot or fanatic.  He made no allusions to his creed\r\nor the habits of his followers and betrayed no egotism or pride.\r\nHe has died since but the organization he left behind him is still\r\nin existence, and the Mormon faith is still the creed and guide of\r\nthe great body of those who followed Brigham Young into the\r\nwilderness, and of their numerous descendants.  It is to be hoped\r\nthat the government and people of the United States will let the\r\nMormons severely alone, allowing them to believe what they will,\r\nand to do in the way of worship what they choose.  In this way only\r\ncan their confidence in alleged revelations be shaken, and Mormonism\r\nwill disappear among the many vain attempts of humanity to explore\r\nthe mysteries of life and death.  Persecution never weakens delusions,\r\nnor disturbs faith, however ignorant and groundless.\r\n\r\nFrom Salt Lake our party went to Cheyenne and thence to Denver.\r\nThis city was growing rapidly and was plainly destined to be the\r\nprincipal center of the mineral development of several states.  I\r\nhad, on a previous trip, visited the interesting region of the\r\n\"Garden of the Gods,\" Colorado Springs and Pike's Peak.  Our party\r\nleft Denver for home.  On the long stretch via Kansas City, St.\r\nLouis and Indianapolis we saw nothing new, as we were traveling\r\nover familiar ground.  It was early in September, when corn, the\r\ngreat western staple, was approaching maturity, and the earth was\r\ngiving forth its increase.  We were crossing the largest and perhaps\r\nmost fertile valley of the world.  All of it had been redeemed from\r\nnature and the Indians, within one hundred years.  During our trip\r\nwe had passed through great cities, prosperous towns and amidst\r\nwonderful scenery.  All of the route except through the Yosemite\r\nvalley was passed over in a palace car.  The ocean voyage was in\r\na steamboat even more luxurious then the palace car.  All this\r\nrapid development did not satisfy the desire of Colonel Scott and\r\nMr. Walters.  Their minds were occupied with vast railroad projects,\r\nsome of which were accomplished before their death.  I also had my\r\ndreams but they related to public policies rather than internal\r\nimprovements and some of these have been realized.\r\n\r\nI was awakened one bright morning in September and told that the\r\ncar was in Ohio.  This was enough to drive sleep from my eyelids.\r\nI looked out upon the rich lands of the Miami valley, the comfortable\r\nhomesteads on every farm, the fat cattle and herds of sheep, the\r\nbroad fields of yellow corn, and every sign of fertility.  All\r\nthese, and perhaps a little admixture of state pride, led me to\r\nsay that, after all, the people of Ohio need not go beyond the\r\nbounds of that state with any hope to improve their condition or\r\nto secure a better opportunity for a happy life.  I soon parted\r\nwith my friends with sincere regrets, for in our journeyings we\r\nwere in truth a happy family.\r\n\r\nThe canvass in Ohio was then progressing for the election of a\r\nPresident and Members of Congress, in which I was expected, as\r\nusual, to take a part.  The strange anomaly of Horace Greeley\r\nrunning on a Democratic ticket was enough in itself to excite\r\nopposition, especially in the southern states.  The result was that\r\nGeneral Grant, in November, 1872, was elected President by 31 states\r\nwith 286 electoral votes.  Greeley died after the election, and\r\nbefore the electors voted, so that no electoral vote was counted\r\nfor him.  If he had lived he would probably have received 60\r\nelectoral votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTHE PANIC OF 1873 AND ITS RESULTS.\r\nFailure of Jay Cooke and Co.--Wild Schemes \"for the Relief of the\r\nPeople\"--Congress Called Upon for Help--Finance Committee's Report\r\nfor the Redemption of United States Notes in Coin--Extracts from\r\nMy Speech in Favor of the Report--Bill to Fix the Amount of United\r\nStates Notes--Finally Passed by the Senate and House--Vetoed by\r\nPresident Grant and Failure to Pass Over His Objection--General\r\nEffect Throughout the Country of the Struggle for Resumption--\r\nImperative Necessity for Providing Some Measure of Relief.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four years of General Grant's administration the\r\nfinancial condition of the United States was eminently prosperous.\r\nThe total reduction of the national debt, from the 1st of March,\r\n1869, to the 1st of November, 1873, was $383,629,783, the annual\r\nsaving of interest resulting therefrom being $27,432,932.  During\r\nthis period the value of United States notes compared with coin\r\nsteadily increased.  The funding of the six per cent. bonds into\r\nfive per cent. bonds, under the refunding act, continued at the\r\nrate of about $85,000,000 a year.  The credit of the United States\r\nsteadily advanced during this period, so that the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, in his report of 1873, stated that it had not stood higher\r\nsince the close of the Rebellion than it did at that time.  This\r\nimprovement of the public credit was accompanied with a large\r\nreduction of internal taxes and duties on imported goods.  The\r\nbusiness of the country was prosperous, the increase and extension\r\nof railroads and the development of new industries was marked,\r\nindicating great prosperity.\r\n\r\nAll this was subsequently changed by the happening of a panic in\r\nSeptember, 1873.  The cause of this was attributed to over-trading,\r\nto the expansion of credits, and to rash investment made in advance\r\nof public needs.  This panic commenced by the failure of Jay Cooke\r\n& Co., of Philadelphia, an enterprising firm of high standing, then\r\nengaged in selling the bonds of the Northern Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany.  I was engaged at that time, with a committee of the\r\nSenate, of which William Windom was chairman, in examining many\r\nplans of public improvements, especially in the increase of facilities\r\nfor water transportation at the mouth of the Mississippi river,\r\nand at the great lakes on our northern boundary, improvements since\r\nthen made with great benefit to the commerce of the United States.\r\nRoscoe Conkling, of New York, was a member of that committee.  We\r\nwere at Buffalo when the failure of Cooke & Co. was announced.  We\r\nall felt that for the present, at least, our duties as a committee\r\nwere at an end.  The panic spread so that in a month all industries\r\nwere in a measure suspended.  The wildest schemes for relief were\r\nproposed, in and out of Congress.  The panic spread to the banks,\r\nwhich were compelled in self-defense to call in their loans, to\r\nwithhold their circulating notes, and contract their business.  As\r\nusual on the happening of such a panic, an appeal was made to the\r\ntreasury for relief, a demand was made for an increase in the volume\r\nof the United States notes, and that the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nshould use the money of the government to buy exchange.\r\n\r\nThe New York Produce Exchange applied to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury on the 29th of September, 1873, in resolutions, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, The critical condition of the commercial interests of\r\nthe country requires immediate relief by the removal of the block\r\nin negotiating foreign exchange; therefore be it\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That we respectfully suggest to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury the following plans for relief in this extraordinary\r\nemergency:\r\n\r\n\"First, That currency be immediately issued to banks or bankers,\r\nupon satisfactory evidence that gold has been placed upon special\r\ndeposit in the Bank of England, by their correspondents in London,\r\nto the credit of the United States, to be used solely in purchasing\r\ncommercial bills of exchange.\r\n\r\n\"Second, That the President of the United States and the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury are respectfully requested to order the immediate\r\nprepayment of the outstanding loan of the United States due January\r\n1, 1874.\"\r\n\r\nThis request had, as a matter of course, to be denied.  But the\r\nsecretary did purchase $13,000,000 of bonds for the sinking fund,\r\nto the full extent the condition of the treasury allowed.  It is\r\ndifficult to realize or to convey by description the wild ideas\r\ndeveloped by such a panic.  The government for the time being is\r\nexpected to provide a remedy for a condition it did not create,\r\nbut, instead of aiding, the government is most likely to need aid.\r\nThe revenues from importations fell off and the value of United\r\nStates notes declined.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress convened in December, 1873, the wildest schemes for\r\nrelief to the people were proposed.  A large increase of United\r\nStates notes was demanded.  More than sixty bills, resolutions and\r\npropositions were introduced in the Senate in respect to the\r\ncurrency, the public debt and national banks, all bearing upon the\r\nfinancial condition of the country, expressing every variety of\r\nopinion, from immediate coin payments to the wildest inflation of\r\nirredeemable paper money.  All these were referred to the committee\r\non finance, then composed as follows:  Messrs. Sherman (chairman),\r\nMorrill, of Vermont, Scott, Wright, Ferry, of Michigan, Fenton and\r\nBayard.\r\n\r\nThe several measures referred to the committee were taken up and\r\nconsidered, but the same wide divergence of opinion was developed\r\nin the committee as existed outside of Congress among the people.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the committee reported to the Senate the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That it is the duty of Congress during its present\r\nsession to adopt definite measures to redeem the pledge made in\r\nthe act approved March 18, 1869, entitled 'An act to strengthen\r\nthe public credit,' as follows:  'And the United States also pledges\r\nits faith to make provision, at the earliest practicable period,\r\nfor the redemption of United States notes in coin;' and the committee\r\non finance is directed to report to the Senate, at as early a day\r\nas practicable, such measures as will not only redeem the pledge\r\nof the public faith, but will also furnish a currency of uniform\r\nvalue, always redeemable in gold or its equivalent, and so adjusted\r\nas to meet the changing wants of trade and commerce.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ferry, of Michigan, a member of the committee, offered the\r\nfollowing substitute for the pending resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That the committee on finance is directed to report to the Senate,\r\nat as early a day as practicable, such measures as will restore\r\ncommercial confidence and give stability and elasticity to the\r\ncirculating medium through a moderate increase of currency.\"\r\n\r\nUpon these adverse propositions a long debate followed without\r\npractical results.  I made a long speech on the 16th day of January,\r\n1874, in favor of the resolution of the committee.  I then said:\r\n\r\n\"At the outset of my remarks I wish to state some general propositions\r\nestablished by experience, and the concurring opinions of all\r\nwriters on political economy.  They may not be disputed, but are\r\nconstantly overlooked.  They ought to be ever present in this\r\ndiscussion as axioms, the truth of which has been so often proven\r\nthat proof is no longer requisite.\r\n\r\n\"The most obvious of these axioms, which lies at the foundation of\r\nthe argument I wish to make to-day, is that a specie standard is\r\nthe best and the only true standard of all values, recognized as\r\nsuch by all civilized nations of our generation, and established\r\nas such by the experience of all commercial nations that have\r\nexisted from the earliest period of recorded time.  While the United\r\nStates, as well as all other nations, have for a time, under the\r\npressure of war or other calamity, been driven to establish other\r\nstandards of value, yet they have all been impelled to return to\r\nthe true standard; and even while other standards of value have\r\nbeen legalized for the time, specie has measured their value as it\r\nnow measures the value of our legal tender notes.\r\n\r\n\"This axiom is as immutable as the law of gravitation or the laws\r\nof the planetary system, and every device to evade it or avoid it\r\nhas, by its failure, only demonstrated the universal law that specie\r\nmeasures all values as certainly as the surface of the ocean measures\r\nthe level of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"It is idle for us to try to discuss with intelligence the currency\r\nquestion until we are impressed with the truth, the universality,\r\nand the immutability, of this axiom.  Many of the crude ideas now\r\nadvanced spring from ignoring it.  The most ingenious sophistries\r\nare answered by it.  It is the governing principle of finance.  It\r\nis proved by experience, is stated clearly by every leading writer\r\non political economy, and is now here, in our own country, proving\r\nits truth by measuring daily the value of our currency and of all\r\nwe have or produce.  I might, to establish this axiom, repeat the\r\nhistory of finance, from the shekels of silver, 'current money with\r\nthe merchant,' paid by Abraham, to the last sale of stock in New\r\nYork.  I might quote Aristotle and Pliny, as well as all the writers\r\non political economy of our own time, and trace the failure of the\r\ninnumerable efforts to establish some other standard of value, from\r\nthe oxen that measured the value of the armor of Homeric heroes to\r\nthe beautifully engraved promise of our day; but this would only\r\nbe the hundred-times-told tale which every student may find recorded,\r\nnot only in schoolbooks, but in the writings of Humboldt, Chevalier,\r\nAdam Smith, and others of the most advanced scientific authorities.\r\nThey all recognize the precious metals as the universal standard\r\nof value.  Neither governments, nor parliaments, nor congresses\r\ncan change this law.  It defies every form of authority, but silently\r\nand surely asserts itself as a law of necessity, beyond the\r\njurisdiction of municipal law.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Of late years much difficulty has grown out of the slightly varying\r\nvalue of silver and gold, as compared with each other, and the\r\ntendency of opinion has been to adopt gold alone as the standard\r\nof value.  The United States has twice changed the relative value\r\nof these metals, and other modern nations have been driven to\r\nsimilar expedients.  At the Paris monetary conference, held in\r\n1867, which I had the honor to attend, the delegates of twenty\r\nnations represented agreed to recommend gold alone as the standard\r\nof value.  The United States, and nearly all the commercial nations,\r\nhave adopted this standard, and reduced the use of silver to a mere\r\ntoken coinage of less intrinsic value than gold, but maintained at\r\npar with gold by the right to be converted into gold at the will\r\nof the holder.  So that for all practical purposes we may regard\r\ngold as the only true standard, the true money of the world, by\r\nwhich the value of all property, of all productions, of all credits,\r\nand of every medium of exchange, and especially of all paper money,\r\nis tested.\r\n\r\n\"Specie, in former times, was not only the universal standard of\r\nvalue, but it was the general medium of all exchanges.  In modern\r\ntimes this is greatly changed.  Specie is still the universal\r\nstandard of value, but it has ceased to be even the usual medium\r\nof exchange.  The failure to distinguish between the standard of\r\nvalue and the medium of exchanges occasions many of the errors into\r\nwhich so many fall, and nearly every Senator who has spoken on one\r\nside of the question has fallen into this error.  Specie has lost\r\na portion of its sovereign power, for with the enormous increase\r\nof exchanges it was found that, valuable as it is, it is too heavy\r\nto transport from place to place as a medium of exchange.  The\r\nperils of the sea, the dangers of theft and robbery, led to devices\r\nto substitute promises to pay gold in place of the actual gold.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, thus far my remarks are founded upon the experience\r\nof ages, applicable to all countries and to all commercial nations\r\nof our time.  I present them now as axioms of universal recognition.\r\nAnd yet I have heard these axioms denounced in this debate as\r\n'platitudes,' useless for this discussion in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States.  The wisdom of ages, the experience of three thousand\r\nyears, the writings of political economists, are whistled down the\r\nwind as if we in the Senate were wiser than all who have reasoned\r\nand thought and legislated upon financial problems--that all this\r\naccumulated wisdom consists of 'platitudes' unworthy to influence\r\nan American Senate in the consideration of the affairs of our day\r\nand generation.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I do not think so.  If we disregard these 'platitudes,' we\r\nonly demonstrate our own ignorance and punish our constituents with\r\nevils that we ought to avoid.  I purpose now to pursue the argument\r\nfurther, and to prove that we are bound, both by public faith and\r\ngood policy, to bring our currency to the gold standard; that such\r\na result was provided for by the financial policy adopted when the\r\ncurrency was authorized; that a departure from this policy was\r\nadopted after the war was over, and after the necessity for a\r\ndepreciated currency ceased; and that we have only to restore the\r\nold policy to bring us safely, surely, and easily to a specie\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\"First, I present to you the pledge of the United States to pay\r\nthese notes in coin 'at the earliest practicable period.'  In the\r\n'act to strengthen the public credit,' passed on the 18th day of\r\nMarch, 1869, I find this obligation:\r\n\r\n'And the United States also solemnly pledges its public faith to\r\nmake provision, at the earliest practicable period, for the redemption\r\nof the United States notes in coin.'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The Congress of the United States, in order to put into form its\r\nsense of this obligation, passed the act 'to strengthen the public\r\ncredit,' and the last and most important clause of this act is the\r\npromise which I have just read, that these notes should be paid,\r\n'at the earliest practicable period,' in coin.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"On the day we made that promise, the 18th of March, 1869, the\r\ngreenbacks, the notes of the United States, were worth 75¾ cents\r\nin gold; or in other words, gold was at a premium of thirty-two\r\nper cent. . . . What was the result?  After you enacted that law--\r\nthe faith of the people of the United States that you would redeem\r\nthis pledge--the value of your greenbacks advanced, not rapidly,\r\nbut gradually, and in one year, to within twelve per cent. of par\r\nin gold.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, we see, then, the effect of this promise.  And I\r\nhere come to what I regard as a painful feature to discuss--how\r\nhave we redeemed our promise?  It was Congress that made it, in\r\nobedience to the public voice; and no act of Congress ever met with\r\na more hearty and generous approbation.  But I say to you, with\r\nsorrow, that Congress has done no single act the tendency of which\r\nhas been to advance the value of these notes to a gold standard;\r\nand I shall make that clearer before I get through.  Congress made\r\nthis promise five years ago.  The people believed it and business\r\nmen believed it.  Four years have passed away since then, and your\r\ndollar in greenbacks is worth no more to-day than it was on the\r\n18th of March, 1870; and no act of yours has even tended to advance\r\nthe value of that greenback to par in gold, while every affirmative\r\nact of yours since that time has tended to depreciate its value\r\nand to violate your promise.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Every bond that was issued was issued only upon the sacred pledge\r\ncontained in this act, that the interest of that bond should be\r\npaid in coin; and the principal should be paid, when due, in coin.\r\nThe fifth section of the act provides that all duties on imported\r\ngoods shall be paid in coin; and that this money shall be set aside\r\nas a special fund to pay the interest on the bonded debt in coin.\r\nThen, in order to secure the greenbacks, it authorized any holder\r\nof greenbacks to pay any government debt with them; it authorized\r\nthe holder of greenbacks to pay any debt, public or private, with\r\nthem; and every citizen of the United States was bound to take\r\nthem.  Then it authorized them to be converted into six per cent.\r\nbonds of the United States--those bonds payable, principal and\r\ninterest, in gold.  If the policy provided for by this act had been\r\nmaintained, we would long since have been at specie payments,\r\nwithout any serious disturbance of our monetary affairs.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. president, I come to show the Senate how this provision,\r\nthe convertible clause of the act of February 25, 1862, was repealed.\r\nOn the 3rd of March, 1863, Congress passed 'An act to provide ways\r\nand means for the support of the government.'  This act was passed\r\nduring the dark hours of the war.  The currency of the country did\r\nnot flow into the treasury rapidly enough to pay our army.  I\r\nremember that at about the time this act was passed there were very\r\nlarge unpaid requisitions.  The Secretary of the Treasury, instead\r\nof issuing any more six per cent. bonds, desired to float a 10-40\r\nfive per cent. bond; in other words, to reduce the burden of interest\r\nupon the public debt.  At this time there were three hundred millions\r\nof circulation outstanding, and with all the rights, and all the\r\nprivileges, conferred upon the greenbacks, they did not flow into\r\nthe treasury fast enough to furnish means to carry on the operations\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"In other words, the suspension of this convertibility clause was\r\npassed with a view to promote conversion; to encourage conversion;\r\nto induce conversion; and, if possible, to induce a conversion into\r\na five per cent. gold bond instead of into a six per cent. bond.\r\nWhen the Secretary of the Treasury presented this view to Congress\r\nhe was at once met with the pledge of the public faith; with the\r\npromise printed upon the back of the greenbacks that they could be\r\nconverted into six per cent. bonds at the pleasure of the holder;\r\nand that we could not take away that right.  This difficulty was\r\nmet by the ingenuity of the then Senator from Vermont (Mr. Collamer).\r\nHe said that no man ever exercised a right which could not properly\r\nbe barred by a statute of limitations; and if this right was\r\ninjurious to the people of the United States, and prevented the\r\nconversion of these notes into bonds, we might require the holder\r\nof these notes to convert them within a given time; that we could\r\ngive them a reasonable time within which they could convert them\r\ninto six per cent. bonds, and after that take away the right.\r\n\r\n\"The act of March 3, 1863, was amended by inserting this clause:\r\n\r\n'And the holders of United States notes, issued under or by virtue\r\nof said acts, shall present the same for the purpose of exchanging\r\nthe same for bonds, as therein provided, on or before the 1st day\r\nof July, 1863; and thereafter the right so to exchange the same\r\nshall cease and determine.'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. president, I have shown you that the greenbacks were\r\nbased upon coin bonds; that they had the right to be converted into\r\ncoin bonds; that that right was taken away as to the 5-20 bonds;\r\nbut that, in practice and in effect, the greenback was convertible\r\ninto an interest-bearing bond of the United States up to 1866, and\r\nuntil the passage of the law to which I will now refer.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"If this act had contained a simple provision restoring to the\r\nholder of the greenback the right to convert his note into bonds\r\nthere would have been no trouble.  Why should it not have been\r\ndone?  Simply because the then Secretary of the Treasury believed\r\nthat the only way to advance the greenbacks was by reducing the\r\namount of them; that the only way to get back to specie payments\r\nwas by the system of contraction.  If the legal tender notes could\r\nhave been wedded to any form of gold bond by being made convertible\r\ninto it, they would have been lifted, by the gradual advance of\r\nour public credit, to par in gold, leaving the question of contraction\r\nto depend upon the amount of notes needed for currency.  Sir, it\r\nwas the separation of our greenbacks from the funding system that\r\ncreated the difficulty we have upon our hands to-day; and I say\r\nnow that, in my judgment, the only true way to approach specie\r\npayments is to restore this principle, and give to the holder of\r\nthe greenback, who is your creditor, the same right that you give\r\nto any other creditor.  If he has a note which you promised to pay\r\nand cannot, and he desires interest on that note by surrendering\r\nit, why should you not give it to him?  No man can answer that.\r\nIt is just as much a debt as any other portion of the debt of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, after more than three months study and debate, a majority\r\nof the committee agreed upon a measure and directed me to report\r\nit to the Senate.  It fixed the maximum limit of the United States\r\nnotes at $382,000,000.  It provided for a gradual payment of these\r\nnotes in coin or in five per cent. bonds, at the option of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, from the 1st of January, 1876.  It was\r\nentitled \"An act to provide for the redemption and reissue of United\r\nStates notes and for free banking.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the instructions of the committee, on the 23rd of\r\nMarch, 1874, I reported the bill as an original measure, and said:\r\n\r\n\"It is due to the members of the committee on finance that I should\r\nsay that the bill which I have just reported, as it appears on its\r\nface, is in the nature of a compromise measure, which is more or\r\nless acceptable all around, but at the same time there are certain\r\nfeatures of the bill which members of the committee on finance will\r\nfeel at liberty to express their opposition to, and also to propose\r\namendments to.  It is due to them that I should make this statement.\r\nThe bill itself, as appears on its face, is the result of great\r\nlabor, long consideration, and the consequence of compromise.  In\r\nmany cases we were not able, however, to reconcile conflicting\r\nopinions; and on those points, of course, members of the committee\r\nwill feel themselves at liberty to oppose certain features of the\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thurman said:\r\n\r\n\"I should like to inquire of my colleague whether he proposes to-\r\nday or to-morrow, when he makes the motion that he indicated, to\r\nstate what, in the opinion of the committee reporting this bill,\r\nwill be its practical effect, so that we may have the views of the\r\ncommittee as to the workings of the bill should it become a law.\r\nI am sure I, for one, should like very much to know what the\r\ncommittee, who have devoted so much time to this subject, think\r\nwill be the practical working of the measure, at any time that it\r\nsuits the convenience of the chairman of the committee to make such\r\nstatement.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"When the subject is introduced, if it be convenient, to-morrow,\r\nI propose to make a very brief statement of the effect of each\r\nsection, as we understand it; but I do not intend, by any long\r\nspeeches or any remarks, to prolong this matter unnecessarily.  I\r\nhave expressed my own individual views, and each member of the\r\ncommittee, I suppose, stands to the opinion expressed by him in\r\nthe speeches he has made in the Senate--speeches that were carefully\r\nconsidered, and by which the position of each Senator was stated;\r\nbut undoubtedly I shall feel it my duty, when the bill is called\r\nup, to state what I regard as the actual practical effect of these\r\ndifferent propositions; and some of them, I will now say, I assented\r\nto with great reluctance.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day the bill was taken up in the Senate, and I then\r\nstated the general provisions of the bill.  I insert extracts from\r\nmy speech, which indicate the difficulties we encountered:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, some complaint has been made in the Senate and in\r\nthe country at the delay in the presentation, by the committee on\r\nfinance, of some bill covering the financial question; but a moment's\r\nreflection will, I am sure, convince every Senator that there has\r\nbeen no fault on the part of that committee.  From the beginning\r\nof the session to this hour that committee, under the direction of\r\nthe Senate, has been studying and discussing the various plans and\r\npropositions which were referred to the committee; and I may say\r\nthat over sixty different propositions, either coming in the form\r\nof petitions or in the form of bills, have been sent to the committee,\r\nall of these suggesting different plans and ideas.  It was impossible\r\nto consider all these and to agree upon any comprehensive measures\r\nuntil within a day or two.\r\n\r\n\"There was another consideration.  The committee found itself\r\ndivided in opinion, precisely as the country is, and precisely as\r\nthe Senate is, into as many as three different classes of opinion.\r\nThere were, first, those who desired to take a definite and positive\r\nstep toward the resumption of specie payments.  There were, second,\r\nthose who desired an enlargement of the currency, or what we commonly\r\ncall an inflation of the currency.  There were, third, those who,\r\nwhile willing to see the amount of bank notes increased and the\r\nquestion of the legal tender settled in some form, were also desirous\r\nthat some definite step should be taken toward a specie standard.\r\nThere were these differences of opinion.\r\n\r\n\"For the purpose of ascertaining the views of the Senate, and not\r\ninvolving ourselves in reporting a bill that would be defeated as\r\nthe bill of the last session was, we presented, early in the session,\r\nresolutions of a general character which stated these three ideas:\r\nFirst, the resolution of the majority of the committee that some\r\ndefinite step should be taken toward specie payments.  Then there\r\nwas the amendment offered by the gentleman who now occupies the\r\nchair [Mr. Ferry, of Michigan], that there ought to be an increase\r\nof the currency without reference to any plan of redemption.  Third,\r\nthere was the proposition made by the Senator from Delaware [Mr.\r\nBayard], that measures should be taken at once looking to the\r\nresumption of specie payments.\r\n\r\n\"These propositions were discussed, and the committee were enlightened\r\nby that discussion; at least they obtained the opinions of Members\r\nof the Senate.  Subsequently, in the course of our investigation,\r\na question about the $25,000,000 section (section 6 of the act of\r\nJuly 12, 1870) came up, and the committee deemed it right, by a\r\nunanimous vote, to ascertain the sense of the Senate as to whether\r\nthey wished this section carried into execution.  As it stood upon\r\nthe statute book it was a law without force.  It was a law so\r\nexpressed that the comptroller said he could not execute it.\r\nTherefore the committee reported a bill which would have provided\r\nthe necessary details to carry into execution that section of the\r\nexisting law.  But in the present temper of the public mind, in\r\nthe Senate and in the country, that bill was discussed, and has\r\nbeen discussed day after day, without approaching the question at\r\nall.  During all this time the committee have been pursuing their\r\ninquiries, and finally they have reported the bill which is now\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n\"The measure that is reported is not a satisfactory one to any of\r\nus in all its details.  Probably it is not such as the mind of any\r\nsingle Member of the Senate would propose.  It is in the nature of\r\na compromise bill, and therefore, while it has the strength of a\r\ncompromise bill, it has also the weakness of a compromise bill.\r\nThere are ideas in it which, while meeting the views of a majority,\r\ntaken separately will be opposed by others.  I am quite sure I say\r\nnothing new to the Senate when I say it does not in all respects\r\nmeet my own views.  But there is a necessity for us to yield some\r\nof our opinions.  We cannot reconcile or pass any measure that will\r\nbe satisfactory to the country unless we do so.  Any positive\r\nvictory by either extreme of this controversy will be an absolute\r\ninjury to the business of the country.  Therefore, any measure that\r\nis adopted ought to be so moderate, pursuing such a middle course,\r\nsuch a middle ground, that it will give satisfaction to the country.\r\nIt must be taken as a whole; and therefore the effect of amending\r\nthis proposition will be simply to destroy it.  If an amendment in\r\nthe direction of expansion is inserted, it will drive away some\r\nwho would be willing to support it as is.  If an amendment in the\r\nway of contraction is proposed and carried by a majority of the\r\nSenate, it will drive away those who might be willing to take this\r\nmeasure as a compromise.  The only question before the Senate now\r\nis, whether this is a fair compromise between the ideas that have\r\ndivided the people of this country and the Members of the Senate;\r\nwhether it will surely improve our currency while giving the relief\r\nthat is hoped for by a moderate increase of the currency.  Now I\r\nask the secretary to read the first section of the bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief clerk read section 1, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That the maximum\r\nlimit of United States notes is hereby fixed at $382,000,000, at\r\nwhich amount it shall remain until reduced as hereinafter provided.\"\r\n\r\nI then continued:\r\n\r\n\"It is manifest to every Senator that the initial step in this\r\ncontroversy is to fix the aggregate limit of United States notes.\r\nThe United States notes, although they are very popular, and justly\r\nso, in this country, are at this moment inconvertible; they are\r\nirredeemable, and they are depreciated.  These are facts admitted\r\non all hands.  In making that statement I do not intend at all to\r\ndeny that the United States notes have served a great and useful\r\npurpose; and though I was here at the birth of them and advocated\r\nthem in all stages of their history, yet I am compelled to say at\r\nthis moment, twelve years after their issue, that they are\r\ninconvertible; they are irredeemable; and they are depreciated this\r\nday at the rate of twelve per cent.  They have been legally\r\ninconvertible since July 1, 1863, and practically inconvertible\r\nsince the close of the war; that is, the government refuses to\r\nreceive them, either in payment of customs or in payment at par of\r\nany bond of the United States offered by it.  They are irredeemable\r\non their very face.  They have depreciated almost from the date of\r\ntheir issue, at one time being worth only forty cents in gold, and\r\nto-day only worth ninety cents.  That is the condition of the United\r\nStates notes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there is another thing admitted by all Senators.  I do not\r\ntrespass on any disputed ground when I say that every addition to\r\nthe volume of these notes, while they thus stand depreciated,\r\nirredeemable, and inconvertible, is as certain to further depreciate\r\nthem, as it is that to pour water into an overflowing bucket will\r\ncause it still more to overflow; as certain as the law of gravitation;\r\nas certain as anything human or divine.  It is equally true that\r\nany contraction of this currency, any withdrawal of the amount of\r\nit, is undoubtedly an appreciation of its value, making it nearer\r\nand nearer to the standard of gold.\r\n\r\n\"This is so plain a proposition that it is not necessary to discuss\r\nit; and the whole people of the country understand it; the plainest\r\nand simplest people understand it as well as the wisest.  Those\r\nwho desire to increase prices, to start and put in operation new\r\nenterprises, desire an increase of the currency without any plan\r\nof redemption.  Those, on the other hand, who want to get back to\r\nthe specie standard, to appreciate the value of these notes, desire\r\nto withdraw them, get them out of the way, or give new uses and\r\nnew values to them so as to advance them nearer and nearer the\r\nstandard of gold.  Therefore it is that I say the very first step\r\nat the outset of this controversy is to settle what is the legal\r\nlimit of these notes; how many are there now authorized by law;\r\nhow many are there outstanding.  And here it is a strange thing\r\nthat on this very point, a purely legal question, the most important\r\none in our financial discussion, there is a great difference of\r\nopinion.  There ought not to be uncertainty or room for a difference\r\nof opinion upon a question of this kind.  It ought to be settled.\r\nOn the one hand it is insisted by Senators who compose the majority\r\nof the committee on finance that the legal limit of United States\r\nnotes is $356,000,000; that the amount which has been already\r\nissued, of what is known as the $44,000,000 reserve, was unlawfully\r\nissued, although under great press of circumstances and without\r\nany intention on the part of the secretary to do more than he\r\nthought he had a lawful right to do.  On the other hand it is\r\ninsisted by other Senators that the legal limit of United States\r\nnotes is $400,000,000; and here is a margin of $44,000,000 upon\r\nwhich there is a dispute of law as to the power of the secretary\r\nto issue it.  That dispute ought to be settled at once.  It is a\r\nquestion that ought not to be in doubt a moment, because the power\r\nto issue that $44,000,000 places it in the discretion of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury either to advance or to lower the value\r\nof all property in the United States, of all debts in the United\r\nStates, of everything that is measured by United States notes.\r\n\r\n\"Should we undertake to say that the secretary did wrong in exceeding\r\nthe limit at $356,000,000?  A majority of the committee believe\r\nthat that is now the legal limit, and believe it conscientiously.\r\nBut should be undertake to fix that as the legal limit?  Twenty-\r\nsix million dollars of the $44,000,000 are outstanding.  They are\r\nnow issued; they are now a part of the currency of the country.\r\nThey are just as much the currency as that which was issued before.\r\nYou cannot distinguish between them.  You cannot say which of the\r\n$382,000,000 now outstanding is legal and which is illegal.  So\r\nfar as the United States are concerned, they are all debts of the\r\nUnited States which we are bound to pay, whether they have been\r\nissued legally or illegally.  I do not understand even my friend\r\nfrom Delaware to dispute the duty and obligation of the United\r\nStates to pay these notes, even if they have been illegally issued.\r\nThere can be no question about it.  It is impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween them.  The only question is whether our agent exceeded his\r\nauthority or not.  Therefore, without raising the question as to\r\nthe legality of this issue, reserving to each Senator his own\r\nopinion on the subject, we have adopted as the _status quo_\r\n$382,000,000, the amount now outstanding; and we recognize that\r\namount as the maximum legal obligation of the United States in the\r\nform of notes, and we propose upon that basis to erect our\r\nsuperstructure.  We therefore say that we will raise no question\r\nas to the mode of retiring the $26,000,000; we will simply say that\r\nthe amount now outstanding shall never be exceeded.  That is a\r\nrecognition, at least, that they are outstanding lawfully and\r\nproperly; at any rate, so far as the obligation of the United States\r\nto pay them is concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, a limit ought to be fixed.  But there is a difference\r\nof opinion as to what should be the limit.  If I had the power to\r\nfix this limit I should say that the limit which was fixed by the\r\nold law should remain at $356,000,000; and I would provide a mode\r\nand manner of issuing United States bonds to retire the $26,000,000\r\nslowly and gradually, without disturbing the ordinary business of\r\nthe country.  I would thereby seek to recover the ground we have\r\nlost by what has occurred since the panic, and go back to the\r\nstandard prior to that time.  But I know that would be very difficult;\r\nthat would involve an increase of the bonded debt.  Our revenues\r\nare not sufficient to call in this $26,000,000.  We have no surplus\r\nrevenue now as we had a year or two ago.  We could only do it by\r\nthe issue of bonds, and the process itself would be a very hard\r\none.  Besides, it is probable that public opinion and the judgment\r\nof Congress would not sustain such a proposition; and therefore it\r\nis hardly worth while to recommend it.  We assume, therefore, that\r\nthe $382,000,000 is the present limit, and we say that shall be\r\nthe maximum limit.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I said it was a compromise by the committee.  I speak of a majority\r\nof the committee.  As a matter of course my friend is at liberty\r\nto dissent from any of its propositions.  On question of this kind\r\ncommittees are very rarely unanimous; but I will say that on this\r\npoint a very decided majority of the committee concurred in the\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\"To the second section I wish to invite the careful and earnest\r\nattention of the Senate.  This section is an honest effort to deal\r\nwith the great problem of redemption.  Every Senator who has spoken\r\ncontemplates that a time must come when all the United States notes\r\nmust be redeemed in coin.  The public faith of the United States\r\nis so pledged.  The notes were issued with the understanding that\r\nthey should be paid in coin.  No man could survive politically in\r\nthis country who would declare that it was his purpose never to\r\npay these notes in coin.  My friend who now presides [Mr. Ferry,\r\nof Michigan], speaks always of his measure of inflation as a means\r\nof bringing about at some time specie payments; and I will say that\r\nin the Senate I have not heard any Senator deny that it is the duty\r\nof the United States at some time to pay these notes in coin.  In\r\nall this discussion there is at least that one point agreed upon.\r\nIf I state this too strongly I hope I will be here corrected.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. president, how shall it be done, and when shall it be\r\ndone?  I say that now, nine years after the close of our Civil War,\r\ntwelve years after these notes have been authorized and issued,\r\nfive years after the dominant party has declared its purpose to\r\npay them at the earliest day practicable, there should be no longer\r\ndelay.  The United States ought to do something toward the fulfillment\r\nof that pledge and the performance of that duty.  There must be\r\nsomething very peculiar in the condition of our country that will\r\njustify a longer delay; a longer procrastination in the performance\r\nof this solemn pledge, this public policy--our own political\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, this section is the result of the patient consideration\r\nof the committee on finance as to how this result is to be brought\r\nabout; and upon this very section there is most likely to be a\r\ncontrariety and difference of opinion among Senators, because the\r\nmode and manner of redemption is the thing which has excited the\r\npublic mind and upon which men all over the country differ.  I\r\nwish, therefore, to deal with this question.  We have got to pay\r\nthese notes in coin.  The time when is not defined by the law.\r\nAre we prepared now to fix a day when we will pay these notes in\r\ncoin?  If the condition of our country was such as to justify it,\r\nI would greatly prefer fixing the time when these notes should be\r\npaid in coin; but I am disposed to agree with what has been stated\r\nby the Senator from Indiana, and by other Senators, that in the\r\npresent condition of our coinage, the present condition of our\r\nforeign trade, we are not prepared to fix a definite day when we\r\nwill pay in coin.  Why?  I find, by reference to official documents,\r\nthat we now have in gold and silver coin in this country about\r\n$140,000,000.  This statement of Dr. Linderman does not include\r\nthe bullion on hand.  How much that is I am not prepared to state.\r\nThe whole amount of gold and silver coin in the country, however,\r\nis about $140,000,000.  Some of that is in circulation in the\r\nPacific states, but the bulk of it is in the treasury of the United\r\nStates, the property of individuals and the property of the United\r\nStates.  The total annual production of gold and silver in this\r\ncountry cannot be estimated at over $70,000,000; and heretofore,\r\nat least $50,000,000 of this has been exported over and above the\r\namount that has been imported.  The balance of trade has been\r\nagainst us; and although I do not regard that as entering much into\r\nthe calculation, yet it is a fact that until recently, perhaps,\r\nthe balance of trade has been against us.  The annual coinage of\r\nthe United States for the last year or two has been largely\r\nincreasing, and last year the coinage of the United States was\r\n$38,689,183, besides stamping into fine bars, which operate as a\r\nkind of coinage, of $27,517,000.  So that there has been in fact\r\nconverted, of gold and silver, into coin, or bars stamped by the\r\nUnited States, $66,000,000 during the last year, showing a use and\r\nemployment of gold in this country that is now rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\n\"But still this state of affairs would not justify us in saying\r\nthat we are prepared to declare a resumption of specie payments\r\nabsolutely upon the basis of $800,000,000 of paper money, including\r\nour fractional currency.  I am, therefore, not prepared to say that\r\nthe United States can, on a fixed day, within a reasonable time--\r\nwithin such a time as would give confidence in our ability to\r\nperform it--say that we will absolutely redeem our notes in coin.\r\n\r\n\"I know that Senators here, for whose opinion I have the highest\r\nrespect, who are probably more sanguine of our ability and capacity\r\nto do this than I am--many of those who have agreed with me and co-\r\noperated with me--think we are able and strong enough to fix the\r\ntime for the absolute resumption of specie payments; but I have\r\nalways doubted it.  Indeed I have thought there was a better way\r\nto reach the great result.  But if we cannot fix the time when we\r\nwill redeem in coin, can we not give additional value to our United\r\nStates noes, so as to gradually appreciate them to the coin standard,\r\nand thus advance toward specie payments if we cannot reach the\r\ngoal?  Because we cannot accomplish all that we have agreed to do\r\nin a given time, does that relieve us from the necessity of\r\nprogressing in that direction?  When we have before us a long\r\njourney that will take months to pass, perhaps years, shall we\r\ndelay starting on that journey because we cannot reach the end of\r\nit in a year or two?  Not at all.  I therefore say that the time\r\nhas arrived this moment when the United States ought to do something\r\nto advance its notes to the specie standard.\r\n\r\n\"Now what is that something?  There are two propositions, and only\r\ntwo propositions, that have been made, aside from absolute coin\r\nredemption, that have had any strength whatever.  One is to allow\r\nthe United States notes to be received in payment of customs duties,\r\nthe other is to allow United States notes to be converted into\r\nbonds.  In regard to the first, I agree entirely that if the matter\r\nwas open now to our choice and selection, one of the best methods\r\nwe could adopt to advance our notes to par in gold would be by\r\nrepealing that restriction which prevents the receiving of them\r\nfor customs duties; but we are met there by the sacred pledge of\r\nthe United States; we are met there by the fact that customs duties\r\nare, by the law of 1862, agreed to be collected in coin.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bayard inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Does not the law provide that the customs duties shall be paid in\r\ncoin or in notes of the United States?  Is not the alternative\r\ngiven by the law?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"O, no.  If the Senator will look at section 5 of the act of February\r\n25, 1862--my friend from Vermont can turn to it in a moment--he\r\nwill find that there is an express stipulation that the customs\r\nduties shall be collected in coin, and that this coin shall be set\r\naside as a pledge--legal language is used--and shall only be applied,\r\nfirst, to the payment of the interest on the public debt, and,\r\nsecondly, to the establishment of a sinking fund of one per cent.\r\nThat was the basis of the obligation of the United States to pay\r\nin coin, and but for the fact that we collected our customs duties\r\nin coin during the war we could not have paid the interest on our\r\npublic debt in coin, and therefore our bonds would have sunk out\r\nof sight.  That pledge we cannot now violate; and I never have yet\r\nbeen able to bring my mind to the consideration of any proposition\r\nwhatever which would ever shock or excite the fear of the public\r\ncreditors in that respect.  The safety of the public creditors\r\nconsists in having a specific fund for the payment of their interest;\r\nthe principal will take care of itself; and that fund has always\r\nbeen maintained in the darkest hours of the war.  Except the\r\npropositions that have been made here and there to impair that fund\r\nby allowing a portion of the customs duties to be paid in currency,\r\nit has never been either invaded or threatened; but all such\r\npropositions have been voted down.  I, therefore, while I see the\r\npolicy and the expedience of allowing these notes to be used in\r\npayment of customs duties, simply say we are precluded from that\r\nremedy because we have mortgaged that fund, and we have no power\r\nto take them for any purpose except that which the mortgage\r\nstipulates.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"We then come to the redemption in bonds.  There is the moral\r\nobligation, on the part of the United States, which has issued its\r\nnotes payable in coin, but for reasons of public policy does not\r\npay in coin, to give to its creditors its notes bearing interest\r\nin place of coin.  The United States cannot plead inability to pay\r\ninterest on its notes if it will not or cannot pay the principal.\r\nWhy should not the United States give its obligation bearing interest\r\njust as any individual would have to do?  There is a moral obligation\r\nwhich rests upon the United States every day of the year to every\r\nholder of these notes, because, although the United States has not\r\nsaid when it will redeem these notes in coin, yet it is bound to\r\ndo what it can to give them additional value.  Although it may not\r\nreceive these notes for customs duties, why can it not receive\r\nthese notes in payment of bonds?  Why discriminate against these\r\nnotes in the sale of bonds?  The answer is, that during the war we\r\nwere compelled to do it; and so we were.  I very reluctantly yielded\r\nto that necessity.  We were compelled to do it; but, sir, it was\r\nonly expected that that would continue to the close of the war;\r\nand, practically, during the whole of the war these notes were\r\nreceived at par for bonds at par.\r\n\r\n\"If, therefore, we are to take any step toward specie payments,\r\nwhy not give to the holder of United States notes who demands it,\r\na bond of the United States bearing a reasonable rate of interest\r\nin exchange for his notes?  This should only be done after a\r\nreasonable time, so as to prevent any injury to the private contracts\r\nbetween debtor and creditor.  When we cannot pay the coin, we are\r\nhonorably and sacredly bound to pay in a bond of the United States,\r\nwhich in ordinary times would approximate to par in gold.  In other\r\nwords, this is a qualified redemption.  The Senator from Indiana\r\ncalls it a 'half-way measure.'  It is a half-way measure in the\r\nright direction, and indeed it is practical specie payment.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill led to a long continuous debate which extended to the 6th\r\nof April, 1874.  Several amendments were offered and adopted which\r\nenlarged the maximum of notes to $400,000,000, and greatly weakened\r\nthe bill as a measure of resumption of specie payments.  By reason\r\nof these amendments many of those who would have supported the bill\r\nas introduced voted against it on its passage, I among the number.\r\nThe bill, however, passed the Senate by a vote of yeas 29 and nays\r\n24.  The title of the bill was changed to \"A bill to fix the amount\r\nof United States notes and the circulation of national banks, and\r\nfor other purposes.\"  This change of title indicates the radical\r\nchange in the provisions of the bill.  Instead of a return to specie\r\npayments, it provided for an expansion of an irredeemable currency.\r\n\r\nThe bill, as it passed the Senate, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted, etc.,_, That the maximum amount of United States\r\nnotes is hereby fixed at $400,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  That forty-six millions in notes for circulation, in\r\naddition to such circulation now allowed by law, shall be issued\r\nto national banking associations now organized and which may be\r\norganized hereafter, and such increased circulation shall be\r\ndistributed among the several states as provided in section 1 of\r\nthe act entitled 'An act to provide for the redemption of the three\r\nper cent. temporary loan certificates and for an increase of national\r\nbank notes,' approved July 12, 1870.  And each national banking\r\nassociation, now organized or hereafter to be organized, shall keep\r\nand maintain, as a part of its reserve required by law, one-fourth\r\npart of the coin received by it as interest on bonds of the United\r\nStates deposited as security for circulating notes or government\r\ndeposits; and that hereafter only one-fourth of the reserve now\r\nprescribed by law for national banking associations shall consist\r\nof balances due to an association available for the redemption of\r\nthe circulating notes from associations in cities of redemption,\r\nand upon which balances no interest shall be paid.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was taken up in the House of Representatives on the 14th\r\nof April, 1874, and, without any debate on its merits, was passed\r\nby the vote of 140 yeas and 102 nays.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of April, President Grant returned the bill to the\r\nSenate with his veto, and the Senate, upon the question, \"Shall\r\nthe bill pass notwithstanding the objections of the President of\r\nthe United States,\" voted 34 yeas and 30 nays.  I voted nay.  The\r\npresident of the Senate declared \"that two-thirds of the Senators\r\npresent not having voted in the affirmative the Senate refuses to\r\npass the bill.\"\r\n\r\nThus, for that session, the struggle for resumption ended; but the\r\ndebate in both Houses attracted popular discussion, and tended in\r\nthe right direction.  The evil effects of the stringency in monetary\r\naffairs, the want of confidence, the reduction of the national\r\nrevenue, the decline of domestic productions, all these contributed\r\nto impress Congress with the imperative necessity of providing some\r\nmeasure of relief.  Instead of inflation, of large issues of paper\r\nmoney by the United States and the national banks, there grew up\r\na conviction that the better policy was to limit and reduce the\r\nvolume of such money to an amount that could be maintained at par\r\nwith coin.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass that followed I spoke in many parts of Ohio,\r\nconfining myself chiefly to financial questions.  The stringency\r\nof the money market which occurred the preceding year still continued,\r\nand great interest was manifested in the measures proposed during\r\nthe preceding session, especially in the defeat of the bill to\r\nprevent the contraction of the currency.  At the request of General\r\nGarfield I spoke in Warren in his Congressional district, where he\r\nmet, for the first time, a decided opposition.  I insert his\r\nautograph letter, the original being in his familiar hand writing:\r\n\r\n  \"Hiram, Ohio, September 25, 1874.\r\n\"Dear Senator:--In accordance with the arrangement which I made\r\nwith you and with the central committee, we have posted you for a\r\nmass meeting at Warren, on Saturday afternoon, October 10.  I hope\r\nI shall not embarrass you by suggesting that in your speech you\r\ntake occasion to say a few words in reference to my standing and\r\npublic service as a representative.  It will do much to counteract\r\nthe prejudice that a small knob of persistent assailants have\r\ncreated against me.  I write also to inquire if you will be willing\r\nto speak at another place the same evening.  If so, we are very\r\nanxious to have you do so.  Please telegraph me to Garrettsville,\r\nOhio, and oblige,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nBILL FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS.\r\nDecline in Value of Paper Money--Meeting of Congress in December,\r\n1874--Senate Committee of Eleven to Formulate a Bill to Advance\r\nUnited States Notes to Par in Coin--Widely Differing Views of the\r\nMembers--Redemption of Fractional Currency Readily Agreed to--Other\r\nSections Finally Adopted--Means to Prepare for and Maintain Resumption\r\n--Report of the Bill by the Committee on Finance--Its Passage by\r\nthe Senate by a Vote of 32 to 14--Full Text of the Measure and an\r\nExplanation of What It Was Expected to Accomplish--Approval by the\r\nHouse and the President.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, 1874, the amount of United States\r\nnotes outstanding was $382,000,000.  The fractional notes outstanding\r\nconvertible into legal tenders amounted to $44,000,000, and the\r\namount of national bank notes redeemable in lawful money was\r\n$354,000,000, in all $780,000,000.  Each dollar was worth a fraction\r\nless than 89 cents in coin.  While these notes were at a discount\r\ncoin did not and could not circulate as money.  The government\r\nexacted coin for customs duties and paid coin for interest on its\r\nbonds.  If there was an excess of coin received from customs to\r\npay interest then the excess was sold at a premium.  If the receipts\r\nfrom customs were insufficient to pay the interest on bonds, the\r\ngovernment had to buy the coin and pay the premium.  The people\r\nwho were demanding more money to relieve the stringency did not\r\nsee that the best way to get more money into circulation was to\r\nadopt measures that would make United States notes and bank notes\r\nequal to coin, when all three forms of money would enter into\r\ncirculation and thus give them more money and all kinds of equal\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nWhile our paper money was depreciated the gold and silver bullion\r\nfrom our mines went abroad and was converted into foreign coin,\r\nwhile a large portion and perhaps a majority of our people demanded\r\nmore paper money, which declined in value in exact proportion to\r\nits increase.  During the war vast expenditures compelled us to\r\nuse paper money; the return of peace and the excess of revenue over\r\nexpenditures should have been promptly followed by coin payments\r\nor notes payable in coin.  We delayed this process so long that\r\nthe popular mind rested content with depreciated money, but the\r\npanic of 1873, and the feverish speculation which preceded it,\r\nconvinced the great body of our business men that there was no\r\nremedy for existing evils but a return to specie payments.\r\n\r\nAnother bill concerning currency and free banking was reported by\r\nHorace Maynard, of Tennessee, on the 29th of January, 1874, from\r\nthe committee on banking and currency of the House of Representatives,\r\nwhich provided for free banking and a gradual reduction and\r\ncancellation of United States notes by the issue of notes payable\r\nin gold in two years from the passage of the bill.  This was fully\r\ndebated in the House of Representatives and amended and passed.\r\nIn the Senate it was reported by me from the committee on finance,\r\nwith a substitute which provided for free banking and that on and\r\nafter the 1st of January, 1877, and holder of United States notes\r\nmight present them for payment either in coin or five per cent.\r\nbonds of the United States, at the suggestion of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.  This substitute was amended in the Senate by striking\r\nout all provisions for the redemption of United States notes,\r\nleaving the measure one for free banking alone.  The House disagreed\r\nto the amendments and a committee of conference was appointed,\r\nwhich resulted in a measure fixing the amount of United States\r\nnotes outstanding at $382,000,000, and making no provision for\r\ntheir redemption.  It was a crude and imperfect measure.  I voted\r\nfor it because it provided for a redistribution of national banks\r\namong the states.  I said:  \"Because I cannot get a majority of\r\nboth Houses of Congress to agree to specie resumption I ought not\r\ntherefore to refuse to vote for a bill on the subject of banking\r\nand currency.\"  The bill was approved by the President on the 20th\r\nof June, 1874.  This long struggle prepared the way for the result\r\naccomplished at the next session.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, 1874, the feeling that the remedy\r\nfor existing evils was the return to specie payments, was general\r\namong Republican Senators and Members.  The abortive efforts of\r\nthe previous session and the veto of President Grant of one of the\r\nbills referred to contributed to it.  At the first Republican\r\nconference I called attention to the necessity of our uniting, if\r\npossible, on some measure that would advance United States notes\r\nto par in coin and moved that a committee of eleven Senators be\r\ncreated to formulate a bill for that purpose.  It was agreed to,\r\nand, as the names of the Senators composing the committee have\r\nalready been published, I feel justified in repeating them:  The\r\ncommittee consisted of Senators John Sherman (chairman), William\r\nB. Allison, George S. Boutwell, Roscoe Conkling, George F. Edmunds,\r\nThomas W. Ferry, F. T. Freylinghuysen, Timothy O. Howe, John A.\r\nLogan, Oliver P. Morton, and Aaron A. Sargent.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee met it was agreed that each member should state\r\nhow far he would go in the direction of specie resumption.  When\r\nthese statements were made it was manifest that the divergence of\r\nopinion was so great that an agreement was almost impossible.  Yet,\r\nthe necessity of an agreement was so absolute that a failure to\r\nagree was a disruption of the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the act to provide for the resumption of specie\r\npayments, which related to the coinage and issue of fractional\r\nsilver under the act of February 21, 1853, and the redemption of\r\nan equal amount of fractional currency outstanding should be\r\nredeemed, and was readily agreed to.  This fractional currency was\r\nso worn and filthy, and it cost so much to reissue, that by general\r\nconsent its destruction was agreed to, and its replacement by bright\r\nnew silver coin, which followed, was heartily welcomed.\r\n\r\nThe second section was an unjust concession to the miners of gold.\r\nIt repealed the coinage charge for converting standard gold bullion\r\ninto coin.  This charge had been maintained, not only to cover the\r\ncost of coining, but to prevent the exportation of American coins.\r\nIf the coins were of less value than the bullion of which they were\r\nmade, however small the difference, they would not be exported\r\nwhile bullion could be had for exportation.  The concession was\r\nmade and the charge for coinage of gold was prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe free banking provisions in the third section were not seriously\r\ncontested.  The contraction of the volume of United States notes\r\nas national bank notes increased, was one of the chief subjects of\r\ndisagreement.  It was finally agreed that this contraction should\r\nextend only to the retirement of United States notes in excess of\r\n$300,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe most serious dispute was upon the question whether United States\r\nnotes presented for redemption and redeemed could be reissued.  On\r\nthe one side it was urged that, being redeemed, they could not be\r\nreissued without an express provision of law.  The inflationists,\r\nas all those who favored United States notes as part of our permanent\r\ncurrency were called, refused to vote for the bill if any such\r\nprovision was inserted, while those who favored coin payments were\r\nequally positive that they would vote for no bill that permitted\r\nnotes once redeemed to be reissued.  This appeared to be the rock\r\nupon which the party in power was to split.  I had no doubt under\r\nexisting law, without any further provision, but that United States\r\nnotes could be reissued.  It was finally agreed that no mention\r\nshould be made by me for or against the reissue of notes, and that\r\nI must not commit either side in presenting the bill.\r\n\r\nThe date for general resumption of specie payments on all United\r\nStates notes was fixed on the first of January, 1879, four years\r\nfrom the framing of this bill.  The important and closing clause\r\nof the bill was referred to Mr. Edmunds and myself.  It provided\r\nthe means to prepare for and to maintain resumption.  It placed\r\nunder the control of the Secretary of the Treasury all the surplus\r\nrevenue in the treasury, and gave him full power to issue, sell\r\nand dispose of, at not less than par in coin, any of the bonds\r\ndescribed in the refunding act.  We were careful to select phraseology\r\nso comprehensive that all the resources and credit of the government\r\nwere pledged to redeem the notes of the United States, as fully\r\nand completely as our Revolutionary fathers pledged to each other\r\ntheir lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, in support of\r\nthe declaration of American independence.\r\n\r\nAfter every sentence and word of this bill had been carefully\r\nscrutinized, I was authorized by every member of the committee to\r\nsubmit it to the committee on finance, and to report it from that\r\ncommittee as the unanimous act of the Republican Senators.  We\r\nnaturally expected some support from Mr. Bayard and other Democratic\r\nSenators, who, no doubt, were in favor of specie payments, but they\r\nperhaps thought it best not to share the risk of the measure.\r\n\r\nI reported the bill from the committee on finance on the 21st of\r\nDecember, 1874, and gave notice that on the next day I would call\r\nit up with a view to immediate action.  On the 22nd, after the\r\nmorning business, I moved to proceed to the consideration of the\r\nbill, and gave notice that I intended to press it to its passage,\r\nfrom that hour forward, at the earliest moment practicable.  It\r\nwas well understood that the bill was the result of a Republican\r\nconference.  It was taken up by the decisive vote of 39 yeas to 18\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nIt was not my purpose to do more than to present the provisions of\r\nthe bill.  My brief statement led to a desultory debate, participated\r\nin almost exclusively by Democratic Senators, the Republican Senators\r\nremaining silent.  Several votes were taken, each showing a majority\r\nof more than two-thirds in favor of the bill and against all\r\namendments.  It passed the Senate without change by the vote of 32\r\nyeas to 14 nays.\r\n\r\nI here insert the bill as introduced and passed, with my statement\r\nin support of its provisions:\r\n\r\n  \"AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS.\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury is hereby authorized and required, as rapidly as\r\npracticable, to cause to be coined, at the mints of the United\r\nStates, silver coins of the denominations of ten, twenty-five, and\r\nfifty cents, of standard value, and to issue them in redemption of\r\nan equal number and amount of fractional currency of similar\r\ndenominations, or, at his discretion, he may issue such silver\r\ncoins through the mints, the sub-treasuries, public depositaries,\r\nand post offices of the United States; and, upon such issue, he is\r\nhereby authorized and required to redeem an equal amount of such\r\nfractional currency, until the whole amount of such fractional\r\ncurrency outstanding shall be redeemed.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  That so much of section three thousand five hundred and\r\ntwenty-four of the Revised Statutes of the United States as provides\r\nfor a charge of one-fifth of one per centum for converting standard\r\ngold bullion into coin is hereby repealed; and hereafter no charge\r\nshall be made for that service.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 3.  That section five thousand one hundred and seventy-seven\r\nof the Revised Statutes, limiting the aggregate amount of circulating\r\nnotes of national banking associations, be, and hereby is, repealed;\r\nand each existing banking association may increase its circulating\r\nnotes in accordance with existing law, without respect to said\r\naggregate limit; and new banking associations may be organized in\r\naccordance with existing law, without respect to said aggregate\r\nlimit; and the provisions of law for the withdrawal and redistribution\r\nof national bank currency among the several states and territories\r\nare hereby repealed.  And whenever, and so often, as circulating\r\nnotes shall be issued to any such banking association, so increasing\r\nits capital or circulating notes, or so newly organized as aforesaid,\r\nit shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem\r\nthe legal tender United States notes in excess only of three hundred\r\nmillions of dollars, to the amount of eighty per centum of the sum\r\nof national bank notes so issued to any banking association as\r\naforesaid, and to continue such redemption as such circulating\r\nnotes are issued until there shall be outstanding the sum of three\r\nhundred million dollars of such legal tender United States notes,\r\nand no more.  And on and after the first day of January, anno Domini\r\neighteen hundred and seventy-nine, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nshall redeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then\r\noutstanding, on their presentation for redemption at the office of\r\nthe assistant treasurer of the United States in the city of New\r\nYork, in sums of not less than fifty dollars.  And to enable the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to prepare and provide for the redemption\r\nin this act authorized or required, he is authorized to use any\r\nsurplus revenues from time to time in the treasury not otherwise\r\nappropriated, and to issue, sell, and dispose of, at not less than\r\npar in coin, either of the descriptions of bonds of the United\r\nStates described in the act of Congress approved July fourteenth,\r\neighteen hundred and seventy, entitled 'An act to authorize the\r\nrefunding of the national debt,' with like qualities, privileges,\r\nand exemptions, to the extent necessary to carry this act into full\r\neffect, and to use the proceeds thereof for the purposes aforesaid.\r\nAnd all provisions of law inconsistent with the provisions of this\r\nact are hereby repealed.\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, I do not intend to reopen the debate on financial\r\ntopics of last session.  That debate was carried to such great\r\nlength that it was not only exhaustive, but it was exhausting, not\r\nonly mentally but physically.  The Senate is composed of the same\r\npersons who shared in that debate, and it is utterly idle for us,\r\nin this short session, to reopen it and to invite the discussion\r\nof the various topics presented in that debate.  The Senate is now\r\nwithin less than three months, a little more than two months, of\r\nits adjournment, and there is a general feeling throughout the\r\ncountry, shared by all classes of people, that this Congress ought\r\nto give some definite notice to the people of this country as to\r\ntheir purpose in the important topics embraced in this bill; and\r\nI say to Senators on all sides of the House that this bill contains\r\nenough to accomplish the important object declared by the title of\r\nthe bill, and this without reviving all the troublesome and difficult\r\nquestions which were discussed at the last session.  It contains\r\na few simple propositions which may be separated from the mass of\r\nfinancial topics discussed at the last session.  Its purpose is\r\ndeclared upon the title of the bill, 'An act to provide for the\r\nresumption of specie payments.'  Every word, every line, and every\r\nprovision, of this bill is in harmony with that title.  It will\r\ntend to promote the resumption of specie payments.  It may fall\r\nshort in many particulars of the desire of some Senators; and it\r\ndoes go further in that direction than some Senators were willing\r\nto support at the last session.  It is a bill which demands reasonable\r\nconcession from every Member of the Senate.  If we undertake now\r\nto seek to carry out the individual views of any Senator, we cannot\r\naccomplish the passage of any bill to promote this object, and\r\ntherefore this bill has demanded of everyone who has consented to\r\nit thus far a surrender of some portions of his opinions as to\r\nmeasures and means to accomplish the great purpose.  I will consider\r\nmy duty done, so far as this bill is concerned, by simply stating\r\nits provisions and calling attention to the character of those\r\nprovisions, without entering into a single topic that gave rise to\r\nthe long discussion at the last session.\r\n\r\n\"The bill is intended to provide for the resumption of specie\r\npayments.  The first section of the bill provides for the resumption\r\nof specie payments on the fractional currency.  It is confined to\r\nthat subject alone.  It so happens that at this particular period\r\nof time the state of the money market, the state of the demand for\r\nsilver bullion, and more especially the recent action of the German\r\nEmpire, which has demonetized silver and thus cheapened that product,\r\nenables us now, without any loss of revenue, without any sacrifice,\r\nto enter the market for the purchase of bullion and resume specie\r\npayments on our fractional currency.  The market price of bullion\r\nto-day will justify the government of the United States, without\r\nany sacrifice, at a price about equivalent to, or perhaps a trifle\r\nabove, our fractional currency--scarcely a shadow above our fractional\r\ncurrency--to purchase silver bullion in the money markets of the\r\nworld, mostly of our own production, perhaps entirely of our own\r\nproduction.  This bill simply directs that the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury shall purchase this bullion and shall coin silver coin\r\nand substitute that in the place of fractional currency.  This\r\nsection is recommended not only by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand the President of the United States, but I believe will meet\r\nthe general concurrence of every Member of the Senate, and we\r\nfortunately are enabled to embrace the present time to commence\r\nthis operations without any loss to the government, except perhaps\r\nthe cost of the coinage of this silver may have to be paid out of\r\nthe treasury of the United States.  That coinage may be done in\r\nthe ordinary course of business without any increase of expenditures.\r\nThe mints of the United States are now prepared, immediately upon\r\nthe passage of this bill, to resume the coinage of silver coins\r\nof all the legal denominations.  Therefore the committee has provided\r\nthat the Secretary of the Treasury shall proceed to coin the silver\r\ncoins, and in one of several ways to issue them in place of fractional\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n\"I need not dwell further upon this section, because I believe it\r\nwill meet with the general assent of the Senate.  It provides for\r\nthe immediate resumption of specie payments upon the fractional\r\ncurrency, or at least as immediate as possible; that is, as soon\r\nas the government of the United States can, in the mints of the\r\nUnited States, coin the silver coin.  That process may continue\r\none, two, or three years, how long we cannot tell, depending entirely\r\nupon the force that may be employed in that direction.  It takes\r\na much longer time to coin these small coins than gold coins, and\r\nthe operation will probably take more time than it would to coin\r\nany considerable amount of gold coin.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, of Maryland, inquired:\r\n\r\n\"I would ask the Senator if there is authority to reissue that\r\nfractional currency?\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"I will come to that in a moment.  The second section of this bill\r\nsimply removes an inducement that now exists to export our gold\r\nbullion from the United States to Great Britain, where, by the long\r\nestablished laws of that country, they coin money free of charge.\r\nThis section involves the surrender of about $85,000 a year of\r\nrevenue; that is, the government of the United States received last\r\nyear for coining gold coins, $85,000, or one-fifth of one per cent.\r\non forty-five millions of gold coined.  The only sacrifice of\r\nrevenue, therefore, by the second section of the bill, is the\r\nsacrifice or surrender of $85,000, which heretofore has been levied\r\nupon those who produce gold bullion in order to convert it into\r\ncoin.  In the opinion of many men, among them the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, the director of the mint, and perhaps a large number of\r\nSenators heretofore, this will tend, in a slight degree at any\r\nrate, to prevent the exportation of the gold of our own country\r\ninto foreign parts, because when the government of the United States\r\nundertakes to put gold bullion in the form of gold coin without\r\nadditional charge the tendency will inevitably be for the gold\r\nbullion to flow into the mints for coinage, and being put into the\r\nform of American coin, it is thought by a great many people that\r\nthis will tend to prevent its exportation.  To the extent it does\r\nso it prepares us for specie payments.  That is the whole of the\r\nsecond section.\r\n\r\n\"The third section of the bill contains only two or three affirmative\r\npropositions.  The first is that after the passage of this act\r\nbanking shall be free.  Perhaps there is no idea stronger in the\r\nminds of the American people than a feeling of hostility against\r\na monopoly--a privilege that one man or set of men can enjoy which\r\nis denied to another man or set of men.  Under the law as it now\r\nstands banking is substantially free in the southern and some of\r\nthe western states; but banking is not free in the great commercial\r\nstates, in the older states, where wealth has accumulated for ages.\r\nThis may be a mere sentimental point, but it is well enough to meet\r\nit; and by the operation of this bill banking is made free, so that\r\nthere will be no difficulty hereafter for any corporation organized\r\nas a national bank either to increase its circulation or for banks,\r\nto be organized under the provisions of existing law, to issue\r\ncirculating notes to any extent within the limits and upon the\r\nterms and provisions of the banking law.  This section, therefore,\r\nby making banking free, provides for an enlargement of the currency\r\nin case the business of the community demands it, and in case any\r\nbank in the United States may think it advisable or profitable to\r\nissue circulating medium in the form of bank notes, under the\r\nconditions and limitations of the banking law.  Coupled with that\r\nis a provision, an undertaking, on the part of the United States,\r\nthat as banks are organized or as circulating notes are issued,\r\neither by old or new banks, the government of the United States\r\nundertakes to retire eighty per cent. of that amount of United\r\nStates notes.  In other words, it proposes to redeem the United\r\nStates notes to the extent of eighty per cent. of the amount of bank\r\nnotes that may be issued; and here is the first controversial\r\nquestion that arises on this bill and the first that is settled.\r\n\r\n\"It may be asked if we provide for the issue of circulating notes\r\nto banks, why not provide for the retirement of an equal amount of\r\nUnited States notes.  The answer is that under the provisions of\r\nthe banking act, by the law as it now stands, a bank cannot be\r\norganized and maintained in existence unless the reserve which is\r\nin that bank, or required for that bank in the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness, either on its deposits or circulation, is at least equal\r\nto twenty per cent. of the amount of its circulating notes, so that\r\nit was believed, according to the judgment of the best business\r\nmen of the country, and I may say with the comptroller of the\r\ncurrency, that the retirement of eighty per cent. of the amount of\r\nbank notes is fully equivalent to keeping the amount of circulating\r\nmedium in actual circulation on the same footing, so that this\r\nprovision of the bill neither provides for a contraction nor\r\nexpansion of the currency, but leaves the amount to be regulated\r\nby the business wants of the community, so that when notes are\r\nissued to a bank eighty per cent. of the amount in United States\r\nnotes is redeemed, and this process continued until United States\r\nnotes are reduced to three hundred millions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Schurz asked:\r\n\r\n\"Will the Senator permit me to ask him a question in reference to\r\nthis section?  When the eighty per cent. of greenbacks are retired\r\nwill they be destroyed and never used again?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"I will speak of that in a moment in connection with other sections.\r\nNow, Mr. president, that is all there is in regard to banking in\r\nthis bill and also in regard to the retirement of the United States\r\nnotes until the time for the resumption of specie payments comes,\r\nwhen this bill provides for actual redemption in coin of all notes\r\npresented.  It has always been a question in the minds of many\r\npeople as to whether it is wise to fix a day for specie payments.\r\nThat matter was discussed at the last session of Congress by many\r\nSenators, and the general opinion seemed to be that if we would\r\nprovide the means by which specie payments would be resumed it\r\nmight not be necessary to fix the day; but, on the other hand, it\r\nis important to have our laws in regard to the currency fix a\r\nprobable time, or a certain time, when everybody may know that his\r\ncontracts will be measured by the coin standard.  We also know, by\r\nthe example of other nations which have found themselves in the\r\ncondition in which we are now placed, and by some of the states\r\nwhen specie payments were suspended, that they have adopted a\r\nspecific day for the resumption of specie payments.  In England,\r\nby the bank act of 1819, they provided for the resumption of specie\r\npayments in 1823, making four years.  In our own states--in New\r\nYork, in Ohio, in nearly all the states--when there has been a\r\ntemporary suspension of specie payments a time has been fixed when\r\nthe banks were compelled to resume, and this bill simply follows\r\nthe example that has been set by the states, by England, and by\r\nother nations, when they have been involved in a like condition.\r\n\r\n\"This bill also provides ample means to prepare for and to maintain\r\nresumption.  I may say the whole credit and money of the United\r\nStates is placed by this bill under the direction of the proper\r\nexecutive officers, not only to prepare for but to maintain\r\nresumption, and no man can doubt that if this bill stands the law\r\nof the land from this time until the 1st day of January, 1879,\r\nspecie payments will be resumed, and that our United States notes\r\nwill be converted at the will of the holder into gold and silver\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n\"These are all the provisions contained in this bill.  They are\r\nsimple and easily understood, and every Senator can pass his judgment\r\nupon them readily.\r\n\r\n\"Now I desire to approach a class of questions that are not embraced\r\nin this bill.  Many such, and I could name fifty, are not included\r\nin this bill, and I may say this:  That if there should be a\r\nsuccessful effort, by the Senate of the United States, to ingraft\r\nany of this multitude of doubtful or contested questions upon the\r\nface of this bill it would inevitably tend to its defeat.  I am\r\nfree to say that if I were called upon to frame a bill to accomplish\r\nthe purpose declared in the title of this bill, I would have provided\r\nsome means of gradual redemption between this and the time fixed\r\nfor final specie payments.  All these means are open to objection.\r\n\r\n\"There have been three different plans proposed to prepare for\r\nspecie payments, and only three.  They are all grouped in three\r\nclasses.  One is what is called the contraction plan.  The simplest\r\nand most direct way to specie payments is, undoubtedly, the gradual\r\nwithdrawal of United States notes or the contraction of the currency.\r\nNow, we know very well the feeling with which that idea is regarded,\r\nnot only in this Senate, but all through the country.  It is believed\r\nto operate as a disturbing element in all the business relations\r\nof life; to add to the burden of the debtor by making scare that\r\narticle in which he is bound to pay his debts; and there has been\r\nan honest, sincere opposition to this theory of contraction.\r\nTherefore, although it may be the simplest and the best way to\r\nreach specie payments, it is entirely omitted from this bill.\r\n\r\n\"The second plan, that I have favored myself often, and would favor\r\nnow, if I had my own way, and had no opinion to consult but my own,\r\nis the plan of converting United States notes into a bond that would\r\ngradually appreciate our notes to par in gold.  That has always\r\nbeen a favorite idea of mine.  There is nothing of that kind in\r\nthis bill, except those provisions which authorize the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to issue bonds to retire the greenbacks as bank\r\nnotes are issued; and it also authorizes the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to issue bonds to provide for and to maintain resumption.\r\nI therefore have been compelled to surrender my ideas on this bill\r\nin order to accomplish a good object without using these means that\r\nhave been held objectionable by many Senators.\r\n\r\n\"The third plan of resumption has been favored very extensively in\r\nthis country, which is the plan of a graduated scale for resumption\r\nin coin or bullion; what I call the English plan.  That is, that\r\nwe provide now for the redemption, at a fixed rate or scale or\r\nrates, of so much gold for a specific sum of United States notes.\r\nAt present rates we would give about $90 of gold for $100 of\r\ngreenbacks, and then provide for a graduated scale by which we would\r\napproach specie payments constantly, and reach it at a fixed day.\r\nThis may be called a gradual redemption.  This, also, is objectionable\r\nto many persons, from the idea that it compels us to enter the\r\nmoney markets of the world to discount our own paper.  It is an\r\nideal objection, but a very strong objection; an objection that\r\nhas force with a great many people.  We have undertaken to redeem\r\nthese notes in coin, and it is at least a question of doubtful\r\nethics whether we ought to enter into the markets of the world and\r\nbuy our own notes at a discount.  Although that plan has been\r\nadopted in England and successfully carried into execution, yet\r\nthere is a strong objection to it in this country, and therefore\r\nthat mode is abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"Either of these plans I could readily support; but they have met\r\nand will meet with such opposition that we cannot hope to carry\r\nthem or ingraft them in this bill without defeating it.  We have\r\nthen fallen back on these gradual steps:  First, to retire the\r\nfractional currency; second, to reduce United States notes as bank\r\nnotes are increased; and then to rest our plan of redemption upon\r\nthe declaration, made on the faith of the United States, that at\r\nthe time fixed by the bill we will resume the payment of the United\r\nStates notes in coin at par.  That is the whole of this bill.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, 1875, the bill was considered in the House\r\nof Representatives and, after a very brief conversational debate,\r\npassed by the vote of yeas 136, nays 98.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th day of January, 1875, the President sent a message to\r\nthe Senate approving the bill but also containing recommendations\r\nof further legislation upon matters that had been carefully excluded\r\nfrom the bill.  He added at the close of the message this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"I have ventured upon this subject with great diffidence, because\r\nit is so unusual to approve a measure--as I most heartily do this,\r\neven if no further legislation is attainable at this time--and to\r\nannounce the fact by message.  But I do so, because I feel that it\r\nis a subject of such vital importance to the whole country, that\r\nit should receive the attention of, and be discussed by, Congress\r\nand the people, through the press and in every way, to the end that\r\nthe best and most satisfactory course may be reached of executing\r\nwhat I deem most beneficial legislation on a most vital question\r\nto the interests and the prosperity of the nation.\"\r\n\r\nThus, after a memorable debate, extending through two sessions of\r\nCongress, a measure of vital importance became a law, and when\r\nexecuted completely accomplished the great object proposed by its\r\nauthors.  The narrative of the steps leading to resumption under\r\nthis act will be more appropriate hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nRESUMPTION ACT RECEIVED WITH DISFAVOR.\r\nIt Is Not Well Received by Those Who Wished Immediate Resumption\r\nof Specie Payments--Letter to \"The Financier\" in Reply to a Charge\r\nThat It Was a \"Political Trick,\" etc.--The Ohio Canvass of 1875--\r\nFinance Resolutions in the Democratic and Republican Platforms--R.\r\nB. Hayes and Myself Talk in Favor of Resumption--My Recommendation\r\nof Him for President--A Democrat Elected as Speaker of the House--\r\nThe Senate Still Republican--My Speech in Support of Specie Payments\r\nMade March 6, 1876--What the Financial Policy of the Government\r\nShould Be.\r\n\r\nThe resumption act was generally received with disfavor by those\r\nwho wished the immediate resumption of specie payments.  It was\r\nthe subject of much criticism in the financial journals, among\r\nothers \"The Financier,\" which described it as a political trick,\r\nan evasion of a public duty, and as totally inadequate for the\r\npurpose sought to be accomplished.  I took occasion to reply to\r\nthis article in the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate Chamber,}\r\n  \"Washington, January 10, 1875.}\r\n\"Dear Sir:--As I am a subscriber to 'The Financier,' you will\r\nprobably allow me to express my surprise at the course you have\r\npursued in respect to the finance bill recently passed by Congress.\r\nClaiming as you do to be a 'monetary and business' journal, you\r\nmight be expected to treat fairly a measure affecting so greatly\r\nthe interests you represent; but you have not done so.  You have\r\ntreated it as a political trick, an evasion, a disgrace to Congress.\r\nYou complained that it was passed without debate and that its\r\ninception and passage were shameful.  But as you say in your last\r\nnumber 'that it is well to examine it hopefully, to find _what good\r\nmay have been done, if any_, although from a _bad motive_,' I take\r\nthe liberty to correct errors even in your 'hopeful' view of the\r\nlaw, so that you may be more hopeful still.  You assume that the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury is not authorized to issue five per cent.\r\ngold bonds to prepare for and to maintain resumption, because the\r\namount of five per cent. bonds authorized in the act of 1870 is\r\nnearly exhausted.  This is an error.  The secretary can issue either\r\nfour and a half or five per cent. gold bonds to an amount sufficient\r\nto execute the law.  The act of 1870 is only referred to for the\r\n'description' of the bonds to be issued, and the only limit to\r\ntheir amount is the sum necessary, and the only limit to their sale\r\nis that they must not be sold at less than par in coin.\r\n\r\n\"You say that _one trick_ of the bill is 'that there is no provision\r\nfor carrying on the withdrawal of legal tenders after their maximum\r\nreaches $300,000,000.'  Now this 'trick' was advocated by you one\r\nyear ago; it was voted for by every specie paying Member of Congress\r\nat the last session, and nearly every writer on the subject has\r\ncontended that if the legal tenders were reduced to $300,000,000,\r\nand the treasury was supported by a reasonable reserve, specie\r\npayments could be resumed and maintained.  Besides, no one believes\r\nthat $100,000,000 of bank notes will be issued under this act, and\r\nthis provision only relieves some people from an idle fear of an\r\nimprobable event.  You must have noticed that when banks retire\r\ntheir notes, as they have done and will do rapidly, this is a\r\nreduction of the currency, while every issue of notes to new or\r\nold banks involves a retirement of a ratable amount of United States\r\nnotes.  What you say about playing with a movable 'reserve' is\r\nequally wrong.  Neither the fractional currency nor the 'eighty-\r\ntwo million' redeemed can be reissued, and I stated so when the\r\nbill was pending under debate, and no lawyer could put a different\r\nconstruction upon the bill.  As to United States notes, a part of\r\nthe $300,000,000 redeemed after resumption of specie payments, we\r\ndid refuse to provide whether they could be reissued or not, and\r\nwe acted wisely.  When the question is hereafter determined by\r\nCongress, the controversy will be whether the notes _when reissued_\r\nshall have the _legal tender_ quality, or be simple treasury notes\r\nreceivable for public dues.\r\n\r\n\"Last session the public press scolded at our long and fruitless\r\ndebate on finances, and I agreed with the press.  This session the\r\nsame Senators, enlightened by the long debate and heeding the call\r\nof the press, gave to the subject the most careful and deliberate\r\nconsideration, and agreed upon this bill without much debate, and\r\nyet the press is not happy.  The act does not go as far as I wished,\r\nbut everything in it is right in itself, and is in the right\r\ndirection.  Its chief merit is that it establishes a public policy\r\nwhich no political party or faction will be strong enough to\r\noverthrow, and which if it had not been adopted now, the Democratic\r\nparty in the next Congress would have defeated.  The pretense that\r\nthe Democratic party, as represented in the next House, would have\r\nfavored any bill for specie payments is utterly false.  Therefore\r\nthe measure grants to the Secretary of the Treasury powers enough\r\nto execute it, but if we can secure the aid of a Democratic House\r\nwe can make it certain and effective.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Editor of 'Financier.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the Ohio canvass of 1875 the resumption act became the chief\r\nsubject of controversy.  R. B. Hayes, after having previously served\r\nfor four years as governor of the state, was against nominated for\r\nthat office.  William Allen, then governor, was renominated upon\r\nthe Democratic ticket, in opposition to the resumption act and in\r\nfavor of fiat money, upon which issue the election mainly turned.\r\n\r\nThe eighth resolution of the Democratic platform was as follows;\r\n\r\n\"That the contraction of the currency heretofore made by the\r\nRepublican party, and the further contraction proposed by it, with\r\na view to the forced resumption of specie payment, have already\r\nbrought disaster to the business of the country, and threaten it\r\nwith general bankruptcy and ruin.  We demand that this policy be\r\nabandoned, and that the volume of currency be made and kept equal\r\nto the wants of trade, leaving the restoration of legal tenders to\r\npar with gold, to be brought about by promoting the industries of\r\nthe people and not by destroying them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention in their second resolution declared:\r\n\r\n\"That a policy of finance be steadily pursued, which, without\r\nunnecessary shock to business or trade, will ultimately equalize\r\nthe purchasing capacity of the coin and paper dollar.\"\r\n\r\nEx-Governor Hayes and I opened the state canvass in the county of\r\nLawrence on July 31, 1875, and took strong ground in favor of the\r\nresumption act.  At the beginning it appeared that the people were\r\nnot quite prepared for any measure looking to resumption, but as\r\nthe contest progressed and the subject was fully and boldly presented\r\nby Mr. Hayes and myself, the tide of opinion ran in our favor and\r\nHayes was elected by a small majority.  The ex-governor did not\r\nevade the issue, but in every speech supported and urged the policy\r\nof resumption as a matter of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nIn the approaching nomination for President, Governor Hayes was\r\nfrequently spoken of as a candidate to succeed General Grant, and\r\nI also was mentioned in the same connection, but, feeling confident\r\nthat Mr. Hayes would be a stronger candidate than myself, and fully\r\ndetermined not to stand in his way, on the 21st of January, 1876,\r\nI wrote a letter to a personal friends, and the Member of the Senate\r\nfrom the district in which I live, in which I urged the nomination\r\nof Governor Hayes as the most available candidate in the approaching\r\npresidential canvass.  This letter no doubt contributed to his\r\nstrength and prevented any possibility of the division of the vote\r\nof Ohio in the convention.  The letter I give in full:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., January 21, 1876.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letters of the 2nd and 10th inst. were duly\r\nreceived, and I delayed answering the first sooner partly from\r\npersonal reasons, but mainly that I might fully consider the\r\nquestions raised by you as to the approaching presidential contest,\r\nthe importance of which cannot be overstated.  The election of a\r\nDemocratic President means a restoration to full power in the\r\ngovernment of the worst elements of the rebel Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\"The southern states are to be organized, by violence and intimidation,\r\ninto a compact political power only needing a small fragment of\r\nthe northern states to give it absolute control where, by a majority\r\nrule of the party, it will govern the country as it did in the time\r\nof Pierce and Buchanan.\r\n\r\n\"If it should elect a President and both Houses of Congress, the\r\nconstitutional amendments would be disregarded, the freedmen would\r\nbe nominally citizens but really slaves; innumerable claims, swollen\r\nby perjury, would be saddled upon the treasury, the power of the\r\ngeneral government would be crippled, and the honors won by our\r\npeople in subduing rebellion would be a subject of reproach rather\r\nthan of pride.  The only safeguard from these evils is the election\r\nof a Republican President, and the adoption of a liberal Republican\r\npolicy which should be fair and even generous in the south, but\r\nfirm in the maintenance of all the rights won by the war.  Our\r\nelection in Ohio last fall shows that even under the most adverse\r\ncircumstances we can win on this basis.\r\n\r\n\"Every movement made by this Democratic House of Representatives\r\nis an appeal to every man who ever voted with the Republican party\r\nto rally to its support again, and to every man who fought in the\r\nUnion army to vote with us to preserve the results of his victory.\r\n\r\n\"All we need is such a presidential ticket as will give assurance\r\nthat we mean to stand by our principles, and that will administer\r\nthe government honestly and economically.\r\n\r\n\"As to candidates, the drift of public opinion is rapidly reducing\r\nthe list and has already settled adversely the chances of many of\r\nthem.  Above all, it has positively closed the question of a third\r\nterm.  The conviction that it is not safe to continue in one man\r\nfor too long a period the vast powers of a President, is based upon\r\nthe strongest reasons, and this conviction is supported by so many\r\nprecedents set by the voluntary retirement at the end of a second\r\nterm of so many Presidents that it would be criminal folly to\r\ndisregard it.  I do not believe General Grant ever seriously\r\nentertained the thought of a third term, but even if he did, the\r\nestablished usage against it would make his nomination an act of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\"It would disrupt our party in every Republican state.\r\n\r\n\"Happily for us we do not need to look for the contingency of his\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\n\"Among the candidates now generally named, I have no such preference\r\nthat I could not heartily support either of them.  They are men of\r\nmarked ability, who have rendered important public services, but,\r\nconsidering all things, I believe the nomination of Governor Hayes\r\nwould give us the more strength, taking the whole country at large,\r\nthan any other man.  He is better known in Ohio than elsewhere,\r\nand is stronger there than elsewhere, but the qualities that have\r\nmade him strong in Ohio will, as the canvass progresses, make him\r\nstronger in every state.  He was a good soldier, and, though not\r\ngreatly distinguished as such, he performed his full duty, and I\r\nnoticed, when traveling with him in Ohio, that the soldiers who\r\nserved under him loved and respected him.  As a Member of Congress\r\nhe was not a leading debater, or manager in party tactics, but he\r\nwas always sensible, industrious, and true to his convictions and\r\nthe principles and tendencies of his party, and commanded the\r\nsincere respect of his colleagues.  As a governor, thrice elected,\r\nhe has shown good executive abilities and gained great popularity,\r\nnot only with Republicans but with our adversaries.  On the currency\r\nquestion, which is likely to enter largely into the canvass, he is\r\nthoroughly sound, but is not committed to any particular measure,\r\nso as to be disabled from co-operating with any plan that may\r\npromise success.  On the main questions, protection for all in\r\nequal rights, and the observance of the public faith, he is as\r\ntrustworthy as any one named.  He is fortunately free from the\r\npersonal enmities and antagonisms that would weaken some of his\r\ncompetitors, and he is unblemished in name, character or conduct,\r\nand a native citizen of our state.\r\n\r\n\"I have thus, as you requested, given you my view of the presidential\r\nquestion, taken as dispassionately as if I were examining a\r\nproposition in geometry, and the result drawn from these facts,\r\nnot too strongly stated, is that the Republican party in Ohio ought,\r\nin their state convention, to give Governor Hayes a united delegation\r\ninstructed to support him in the national convention, not that we\r\nhave any special claim to have the candidate taken from Ohio, but\r\nthat in General Hayes we honestly believe the Republican party of\r\nthe United States will have a candidate for President who can\r\ncombine greater popular strength and a greater assurance of success\r\nthan other candidates, and with equal ability to discharge the\r\nduties of President of the United States in case of election.  Let\r\nthis nomination be thus presented, without any wire pulling or\r\ndepreciation of others and as a conviction upon established facts,\r\nand I believe Governor Hayes can be and ought to be nominated.\r\nBut if our state is divided or is not in earnest in this matter it\r\nis far better for Governor Hayes and the state that his name be\r\nnot presented at all.  We have never sufficiently cultivated our\r\nstate pride, with every reason for indulging it, and thus our proper\r\ninfluence has been wasted and lost.  Now we have a good opportunity\r\nto gratify it, and at the same time contribute to the common good.\r\nRemember me kindly to personal friends in the Senate.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. A. M. Burns.\"\r\n\r\nThe election of Members of Congress in 1874 resulted in the choice\r\nof a large majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives\r\nof the 44th Congress, the term of which commenced on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1875.  A majority of the Senate being still largely Republican,\r\nit became difficult to pass any measure of a political character\r\nduring that Congress.  President Grant, on the 17th of February,\r\n1875, issued his proclamation convening the Senate at 12 o'clock\r\non the 5th of March following, to receive and act upon such\r\ncommunications as might be made to it on the part of the Executive.\r\nThe session continued until the 24th of March.  It was largely\r\nengaged in questions affecting the State of Louisiana, which had\r\nbeen the scene of violent tumult and almost civil war.  As these\r\nevents are a part of the public history of the country I do not\r\ndeem it necessary to refer to them at length.  These disturbances\r\ncontinued during the whole of that Congress, and, in 1876, approached\r\nthe condition of civil war.\r\n\r\nThe regular meeting occurred on the 6th of December, 1875, when\r\nThomas W. Ferry, of Michigan, was elected president _pro tempore_\r\nof the Senate, and Michael C. Kerr, a Democratic Representative\r\nfrom the State of Indiana, was elected by a large majority as\r\nspeaker of the House.\r\n\r\nThis political revolution was no doubt caused largely by the\r\nfinancial panic of 1873, and by the severe stringency in monetary\r\naffairs that followed and continued for several years.  Many\r\nfinancial measures of the highest importance in respect to the\r\npublic credit were acted upon, but were generally lost by a\r\ndisagreement between the two Houses.  I do not deem it necessary\r\nto refer to the political questions that greatly excited the public\r\nmind during that session.  Congress was largely occupied in political\r\ndebate on questions in respect to the reconstruction of the states\r\nlately in rebellion, upon which the two Houses disagreed.  Among\r\nother measures which failed was the act amendatory of the acts\r\nauthorizing the refunding of the national debt, which passed the\r\nSenate but was not considered by the House.\r\n\r\nDuring this session of Congress all sorts of financial plans were\r\npresented in each House, but all were aimed, directly or indirectly,\r\nat the resumption act, although that act itself was adopted as a\r\nremedy for existing financial evils, and especially to deal with\r\nand prevent the recurrence of such a panic as that of 1873.  I took\r\noccasion, on the presentation of the resolution of the New York\r\nChamber of Commerce in favor of the resumption of specie payments,\r\nat the time provided by the resumption act, to discuss the policy\r\nof that measure more fully than I thought it expedient to do so\r\nwhen, as a bill, it was pending in the previous Congress.  This\r\nspeech was made in the Senate on the 6th of March, 1876.  It was\r\nthe result of great labor and care, and was intended by me to be,\r\nand I believe it is now, the best presentation I have ever been\r\nable to offer in support of the financial policy of the government,\r\nand especially in support of the resumption of specie payments.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, I have taken the unusual course of arresting the\r\nreference to the committee of finance of the memorial of the Chamber\r\nof Commerce of New York, in order to discuss, in an impersonal and\r\nnonpartisan way, one of the questions presented by that memorial,\r\nand one which now fills the public mind and must necessarily soon\r\noccupy our attention.  That question is, 'Ought the resumption act\r\nof 1875 be repealed?'  The memorial strongly opposes such repeal,\r\nwhile other memorials, and notably those from the boards of trade\r\nof New York and Toledo, advocate it.  These opposing views are\r\nsupported in each House of Congress, and will, when our time is\r\nmore occupied than now, demand our vote.\r\n\r\n\"And, sir, we are forced to consider this question when the law it\r\nis proposed to repeal is only commencing to operate, now, three\r\nyears before it can have full effect--during all which time its\r\noperation will be under your eye and within your power--and while\r\nthe passions of men are heated by a presidential combat, when a\r\ngrave questions, affecting the interests of every citizen of the\r\nUnited States, will be influenced by motives entirely foreign to\r\nthe merits of the proposition.  And the question presented is not\r\nas to the best means of securing the resumption of a specie standard,\r\nbut solely whether the only measure that promises that result shall\r\nbe repealed.  We know there is a wide and honest diversity of\r\nopinion as to the agency and means to secure a specie standard.\r\n\r\n\"When any practicable scheme to that end is proposed I am ready to\r\nexamine it on its merits; but we are not considering the best mode\r\nof doing the thing, but whether we will recede from the promise\r\nmade by the law as it stands, as well as refuse all means to execute\r\nthat promise.  If the law is deficient in any respect it is open\r\nto amendment.  If the powers vested in the secretary are not\r\nsufficient, or you wish to limit or enlarge them, he is your servant,\r\nand you have but to speak and he obeys.  It is not whether we will\r\naccumulate gold or greenbacks or convert our notes into bonds, nor\r\nwhether the time to resume is too early or too late.  All these\r\nare subjects of legislation.  But the question now is whether we\r\nwill repudiate the legislative declaration, made in the act of\r\n1875, to redeem the promise made and printed on the face of every\r\nUnited States note, a promise made in the midst of war, when our\r\nnation was struggling for existence, a promise renewed in March,\r\n1869, in the most unequivocal language, and finally made specific\r\nas to time by the act of 1875.\r\n\r\n\"And let us not deceive ourselves by supposing that those who oppose\r\nthis repeal are in favor of a purely metallic currency, to the\r\nexclusion of paper currency, for all intelligent men agree that\r\nevery commercial nation must have both; the one as the standard of\r\nvalue by which all things are measured, which daily measures your\r\nbonds and notes as it measures wheat, cotton, and land; and also\r\na paper or credit currency, which, from its convenience of handling\r\nor transfer, must be the medium of exchanges in the great body of\r\nthe business of life.  Statistics show that in commercial countries\r\na very large proportion of all transfers is by book accounts and\r\nnotes, and more than nine-tenths of all the residue of payments is\r\nby checks, drafts, and such paper tools of exchange.\r\n\r\n\"Of the vast business done in New York and London not five per\r\ncent. is done with either paper money or gold or silver, but by\r\nthe mere balancing of accounts or the exchange of credits.  And\r\nthis will be so whether your paper money is worth forty per cent.\r\nor one hundred per cent. in gold.  The only question is whether,\r\nin using paper money, we will have that which is as good as it\r\npromises, as good as that of Great Britain, France, or Germany; as\r\ngood as the coin issued from your mints; or whether we will content\r\nourselves with depreciated paper money, worth ten per cent. less\r\nthan it promises, every dollar of which daily tells your constituents\r\nthat the United States in not rich enough to pay more than ninety\r\nper cent. on the dollar for its three hundred and seventy millions\r\nof promises to pay, or that you have not courage enough to stand\r\nby your promise to do it.\r\n\r\n\"Nor are we to decide whether our paper money shall be issued\r\ndirectly by the government or by banks created by the government;\r\nnor whether at a future time the legal tender quality of United\r\nStates notes shall continue.  I am one of those who believe that\r\na United States note issued directly by the government, and\r\nconvertible on demand into gold coin, or a government bond equal\r\nin value to gold, is the best currency we can adopt; that it is to\r\nbe the currency of the future, not only in the United States, but\r\nin Great Britain as well; and that such a currency might properly\r\ncontinue to be a legal tender, except when coin is specifically\r\nstipulated for it.\r\n\r\n\"But these are not the questions we are to deal with.  It is whether\r\nthe promise of the law shall be fulfilled, that the United States\r\nshall pay such of its notes as are presented on and after the 1st\r\nday of January, 1879, in coin; and whether the national banks will,\r\nat the same time, redeem their notes either in coin or United States\r\nnotes made equal to coin; or whether the United States shall revoke\r\nits promise and continue, for an indefinite period, to still longer\r\nforce upon the people a depreciated currency, always below the\r\nlegal standard of gold, and fluctuating daily in its depreciation\r\nas Congress may threaten or promise, or speculators may hoard, or\r\ncorner, or throw out your broken promises.  It is the turning point\r\nin our financial history, which will greatly affect the life of\r\nindividuals and the fate of parties, but, more than all, the honor\r\nand good faith of our country.\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of our national existence, our ancestors boldly\r\nand hopefully assumed the burden of a great national debt, formed\r\nof the debts of the old confederation and of the states that composed\r\nit; and, with a scattered population and feeble resources, honestly\r\nmet and paid, in good solid coin, every obligation.  After the War\r\nof 1812, which exhausted our resources, destroyed our commerce,\r\nand greatly increased our debt, a Republican administration boldly\r\nfunded our debt, placed its currency upon the coin basis, promptly\r\npaid its interest, and reduced the principal; and within twenty\r\nyears after that war was over, under the first Democratic President,\r\npaid in coin the last dollar, both principal and interest, of the\r\ndebt.  And now, eleven years after a greater war, of grander\r\nproportions, in which, not merely foreign domination threatened\r\nus, but the very existence of our nation was at stake, and after\r\nour cause has been blessed with unexampled success, with a country\r\nteeming with wealth, with our credit equal to that of any nation,\r\nwe are debating whether we will redeem our promises, according to\r\ntheir legal tenor and effect, or whether we will refuse to do so\r\nand repeal and cancel them.\r\n\r\n\"I would invoke, in the consideration of this question, the example\r\nof those who won our independence and preserved it to us, to inspire\r\nus so to decide this question that those who come after us may\r\npoint to our example of standing by the public faith now solemnly\r\npledged, even though to do so may not run current with the temporary\r\npressure of the hour, or may entail some sacrifice and hardship.\r\n\r\n\"What then is the law it is proposed to repeal?  I will state its\r\nprovisions fully in detail, but the main proposition--the essential\r\ncore of the whole--is the promise, to which the public faith is\r\npledged, that the United States will redeem in gold coin any of\r\nits notes that may be presented to the treasury on and after the\r\n1st day of January, 1879.  This is the vital object of the law.\r\nIt does not undertake to settle the nature of our paper money after\r\nthan, whether it shall be reissued again, whether it shall thereafter\r\nbe a legal tender, nor whether it shall or shall not supersede bank\r\nnotes.  All this is purposely left to the future.  But it does say\r\nthat on and after that day the United States note promising to pay\r\none dollar shall be equal to the gold dollar of the mint.\r\n\r\n\"The questions then arise--\r\n\r\n  \"First.  Ought this promise be performed?\r\n  \"Second.  Can we perform it?\r\n  \"Third.  Are the agencies and measures prescribed in the law\r\nsufficient for the purpose?\r\n  \"Fourth.  If not, what additional measures should be executed?\r\n\r\n\"Let us consider these questions in their order, with all the\r\nserious deliberation that their conceded importance demands.\r\n\r\n\"And first, ought this promise be fulfilled?\r\n\r\n\"To answer this we must fully understand the legal and moral\r\nobligations contained in the notes of the United States.  The\r\npurport of the note is as follows:\r\n\r\n  'THE UNITED STATES PROMISES TO PAY THE BEARER ONE DOLLAR.'\r\n\r\n\"This note is a promise to pay one dollar.  The legal effect of\r\nthis note has been announced by the unanimous opinion of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, the highest and final judicial authority\r\nin our government.\r\n\r\n\"The legal tender attribute given to the note has been the subject\r\nof conflicting decisions in that court, but the nature and purport\r\nof it is not only plain on its face, but is concurred in by every\r\njudge of that court and by every judicial tribunal before which\r\nthat question has been presented.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of Bank vs. Supervisors, 7 Wallace, 31, Chief Justice\r\nChase says:\r\n\r\n'But, on the other hand, it is equally clear that these notes are\r\nobligations of the United States.  Their name imports obligation.\r\nEvery one of them expresses upon its face an engagement of the\r\nnation to pay to the bearer a certain sum.  The dollar note is an\r\nengagement to pay a dollar, and the dollar intended is the _coined_\r\ndollar of the United States, a certain quantity in weight and\r\nfineness of gold or silver, authenticated as such by the stamp of\r\nthe government.  No other dollars had before been recognized by\r\nthe legislation of the national government as lawful money.'\r\n\r\n\"Again, in the case of Bronson vs. Rhodes, 7 Wallace, 251, Chief\r\nJustice Chase says:\r\n\r\n'The note dollar was the promise to pay a coined dollar.'\r\n\r\n\"In the Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wallace, 560, Justice Bradley says:\r\n\r\n'It is not an attempt to _coin_ money out of a valueless material,\r\nlike the coinage of leather, or ivory, or cowrie shells.  _It is\r\na pledge of the national credit_.  It is a _promise_ by the government\r\nto _pay dollars;_ it is not an attempt to _make_ dollars.  The\r\nstandard of value is not changed.  The government simply demands\r\nthat its credit shall be accepted and received by public and private\r\ncreditors during the pending exigency. . . .\r\n\r\n'No one supposes that these government certificates are never to\r\nbe paid, that the day of specie payments is never to return.  And\r\nit matters not in what form they are issued. . . . Through whatever\r\nchanges they pass, their ultimate destiny is _to be_ paid.'\r\n\r\n\"In all these legal tender cases there is not a word in conflict\r\nwith these opinions.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, then, it is settled that this note is not a dollar, but a\r\ndebt due; a promise to pay a dollar in gold coin.  Congress may\r\ndefine the weight and fineness of a dollar, and it has been done\r\nso by providing a gold coin weighing twenty-five and eight-tenths\r\ngrains of standard gold nine-tenths fine.  The promise is specific\r\nand exact, and its nature is fixed by the law and announced by the\r\ncourt.  Here I might rest as to the nature of the United States\r\nnote; but it is proper that I state the law under which it was\r\nissued and the subsequent laws relating to it.\r\n\r\n\"The act of February 25, 1862, gave birth to this note as well as\r\nthe whole financial policy of the war.  The first section of that\r\nact authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue, upon the\r\ncredit of the United States, United States notes to the amount of\r\n$150,000,000, payable to bearer at the treasury of the United\r\nStates.  The amount of these notes was subsequently increased during\r\nthe war to the maximum sum of $450,000,000, but the nature and\r\ncharacter of the notes was the same as the first ones.  The\r\nenlargement of the issue did not in the least affect the obligation\r\nof the United States to pay them in coin.  This obligation was\r\nrecognized in every loan law passed during the war; and to secure\r\nthe note from depreciation the amount was carefully limited, and\r\nevery quality was given to it to maintain its value that was possible\r\nduring the exigencies of the war.  I might show you, from the\r\ncontemporaneous debates in Congress, that at every step of the war\r\nthe notes were regarded as a temporary loan, in the nature of a\r\nforced loan, but a loan cheerfully borne, and to be redeemed soon\r\nafter the war was over.\r\n\r\n\"It was not until two years after the war, when the advancing value\r\nof the note created an interest to depreciate it in order to advance\r\nprices for the purpose of speculation, that there was any talk\r\nabout putting off the payment of the note.  The policy of a gradual\r\ncontraction of the currency with a view to specie payments was, in\r\nDecember, 1865, concurred in by the almost unanimous vote of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and the act of April 12, 1866, authorized\r\n$4,000,000 of notes a month to be retired and canceled.  No one\r\nthen questioned either the policy, the duty, or the obligation of\r\nthe United States to redeem these notes in coin.\r\n\r\n\"Why has not this obligation been performed?  How comes it that\r\nfourteen years after these notes were issued, and eleven years\r\nafter the exigency was over, we are debating whether they shall be\r\npaid, and when they shall be paid?  We may well pause to examine\r\nhow this plain and positive obligation has so long been deferred\r\nby a nation always sensitive to the public honor.\r\n\r\n\"The fatal commencement of this long delay was in this provision\r\nof the act, approved March 3, 1863, as follows:\r\n\r\n'And the holders of United States notes issued under, and by virtue\r\nof, said acts, shall present the same, for the purpose of exchanging\r\nthe same for bonds as therein provided, on or before the 1st day\r\nof July, 1863, and thereafter the right so to exchange the same\r\nshall cease and determine.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus, under the pressure of war, and the plausible pretext of a\r\nstatute of limitations, the most essential legal attribute of the\r\nnote was taken away.  This act, though convenient in its temporary\r\nresults, was a most fatal step, and for my part in acquiescing in,\r\nand voting for it, I have felt more regret than for any act of my\r\nofficial life.  But it must be remembered that the object of this\r\nprovision was not to prevent the conversion of notes into bonds,\r\nbut to induce their conversion.  It was the policy and need of the\r\ngovernment to induce its citizens to exchange the notes freely for\r\nthe bonds, so that the notes might again be paid out to meet the\r\npressing demands of the war.  It was believed that if this right\r\nto convert them was limited, in time this would cause them to be\r\nmore freely funded; and Mr. Chase, then Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nanxious to prevent a too large increase of the interest of the\r\npublic debt, desired to place in the market a five per cent. bond\r\ninstead of a six per cent. bond.  The fatal error was in not changing\r\nthe right to convert the note into a five per cent. bond instead\r\nof a six per cent. bond.  This was, in fact, proposed in the\r\ncommittee on finance, but it was said that a right to convert a\r\nnote into a bond at any time, was not so likely to be exercised as\r\nif it could only be exercised at the pleasure of the government.\r\nAnd this plausible theory to induce the conversion of notes into\r\nbonds was made the basis, after the war was over, for the refusal\r\nof the United States to allow the conversion of its notes into\r\nbonds, and has been the fruitful cause of the continued depreciation\r\nand dishonor of United States notes for the last five years, during\r\nwhich, our five per cent. bonds have been at par with gold, while\r\nour notes rise and fall in the gamut of depreciation from six to\r\ntwenty per cent. below gold.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding that the right to convert notes into bonds was\r\ntaken away, yet, in fact, they were, during the war, received par\r\nfor par for bonds; and after the war was over all the interest-\r\nbearing securities were converted into bonds; but the notes--the\r\nmoney of the people--the artificial measure of value, the most\r\nsacred obligation, because it was past due, was refused either\r\npayment or conversion, thus cutting it off from the full benefit\r\nof the advancing credit of the government, and leaving to it only\r\nthe forced quality of legal tender in payment of debts.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after the war was over, and notably during the presidential\r\ncampaign of 1868, the question arose whether the bonds of the United\r\nStates were payable in coin or United States notes.  Both notes\r\nand bonds were then below par in coin, the notes ranging from sixty-\r\nseven to seventy-five cents in coin; and five per cent. bonds from\r\nseventy-two to eighty cents in coin.  Here again the opportunity\r\nwas lost to secure the easy and natural appreciation of our notes\r\nto the gold standard.  Had Congress then authorized the conversion\r\nof notes into bonds, when both were depreciated, both would have\r\nadvanced to par in gold; but, on the one hand, it was urged that\r\nthis would cause a rapid contraction, and, on the other, that the\r\nright to convert the note into a bond was not specie payment; it\r\nwas only the exchange of one promise for another.  It was specie\r\npayment they very much favored, but did not have the wisdom then\r\nto secure.  If the advocates for specie payment had then supported\r\na restoration of the right to convert notes into bonds, they would\r\nhave secured their object with but little opposition.  But all\r\nmeasures to fund the notes at the pleasure of the holder were\r\ndefeated, and, instead, there was ingrafted into the act to strengthen\r\nthe public credit--\r\n\r\n\"First, a declaration 'that the faith of the United States is\r\nalready pledged to the payment in coin, or its equivalent, of all\r\nthe obligations of the United States not bearing interest, known\r\nas United States notes, and of all the interest-bearing obligations\r\nof the United States,' except such as by the law could be paid in\r\nother currency than gold and silver.\r\n\r\n\"Second, 'and the United States also solemnly pledges its faith to\r\nmake provision, at the earliest practicable period, for the redemption\r\nof the United States notes in coin.'\r\n\r\n\"Here again, the obligation of the government to pay these notes\r\nin coin was recognized, its purpose declared, and the time fixed\r\n'as early as practicable.'  What was the effect of this important\r\nact of Congress?  Without adding one dollar to the public debt, or\r\nthe burden of the debt, both bonds and notes rose in value.  Within\r\none year, the bonds rose to par in gold, making it practicable to\r\ncommence the refunding of six per cent. bonds into five per cent.\r\nbonds.  The notes rose under the stimulus of this new promise, in\r\none year, from seventy-six cents to eighty-nine cents in gold, but\r\nno steps whatever were made to redeem them.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of bank notes authorized was increased fifty-four\r\nmillions.  The executive department pursued the policy of redeeming\r\ndebts not due, and did, from an overflowing treasury, reduce very\r\nlargely the public debt, but no steps whatever were taken to advance\r\nthe value of our notes.  The effect of the act of 1869 was exhausted\r\non the adjournment of Congress in March, 1870, when the United\r\nStates notes were worth eighty-nine cents in gold; and thereabouts,\r\nup and down, with many fluctuations, they have remained to this\r\nday.  The bondholder, secure in the promise to him, is happy in\r\nreceiving his interest in gold, with his bond above par in gold.\r\nThe note holder, the farmer, the artisan, the laborer, whose labor\r\nand production is measured in greenbacks, still receives your\r\ndepreciated notes, worth ten per cent. less than gold you promised\r\nhim 'at the earliest day practicable.'  The one has a promise\r\nperformed and the other a promise postponed.\r\n\r\n\"Thus we stood when the panic of 1873 came upon us; with more paper\r\nmoney afloat than ever circulated before in any country of the\r\nworld.  Even then, had we stood firmly, the hoarding tendency of\r\nthe panic would have advanced our notes toward the gold standard,\r\nand, in fact, did so during the months of September and October,\r\nuntil the premium on gold had fallen to eight per cent.  But, sir,\r\nat this critical moment, the Secretary of the Treasury, acting, no\r\ndoubt, in good faith, but I think without authority of law, issued\r\ntwenty-six millions more United States notes--part of the notes\r\nretired and canceled under previous acts.  And now, notwithstanding\r\nall the talk about the contraction of the currency, we have not\r\nwithdrawn one-half of this illegal issue.  On the 1st of September,\r\n1873, we had three hundred and fifty-six million notes outstanding.\r\nThree months afterward, we had three hundred and eighty-two million;\r\nand now we have three hundred and seventy-one million.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it was under the light of these events, after the fullest\r\ndiscussion ever given in Congress, of any question--after debate\r\nbefore the people during the recess of Congress, and full deliberation\r\nlast winter--this act was passed.  There was and is now great\r\ndifference of opinion as to the details, but the vital promise made\r\nto the note holder to make his note as good as gold in January,\r\n1879, was concurred in by a large majority of both Houses, and by\r\nmany who opposed the bill as too slow in its operation.  This act\r\nof honor and public faith was applauded by the civilized world and\r\nconcurred in by our constituents, the doubts only being as to the\r\nmachinery to carry it into effect.  The time was fixed by those\r\nwho most feared resumption, and no one proposed a longer time.  My\r\nhonorable friend from Indiana [Mr. Morton] truly said (in the recent\r\ncampaign in Ohio) that he participated in framing it; and he and\r\nthose who agreed with him fixed the time so remote as to excite\r\nthe unfounded charge that the bill was a sham, a mere contrivance\r\nto bridge an election.\r\n\r\n\"And now, sir, to recapitulate this branch of the question, it is\r\nshown that the holder of these notes has a promise of the United\r\nStates, made in February, 1862, to pay him one dollar in gold coin;\r\nthat the legal purport of this promise has been declared by the\r\nSupreme Court; that we have taken away from this note one of the\r\nlegal attributes given it, which would long since have secured its\r\npayment in coin--that when the note was authorized and issued, it\r\nwas understood as redeemable in coin when the war was over; that\r\nour promise to pay it was renewed in 1869--'at as early a day as\r\npracticable;' that by reason of our failure to provide for its\r\npayment, it is still depreciated below par more than one-tenth of\r\nits nominal value; that we renewed this promise, and made it definite\r\nas to time, by act of 1875; that it is a debt due from the United\r\nStates, and in law and honor due now in coin.  Yet it is proposed\r\nto recall our promise to redeem this note in coin three years hence.\r\nI say, sir, this would be national dishonor.  It would destroy the\r\nconfidence with which the public creditor rests upon the promises\r\ncontained in your bonds.  It would greatly tend to arrest the\r\nprocess by which the interest on your bonds is reduced.  It would\r\naccustom our people to the substitution of a temporary wave of\r\npopular opinion for its written contract or promise.  It would\r\nweaken in the public mind that keen sense of honor and pride which\r\nhas always distinguished the English-speaking nations in dealing\r\nwith public obligations.\r\n\r\n\"An old writer thus describes 'public credit:'\r\n\r\n'Credit is a consequence, not a cause; the effect of a substance,\r\nnot a substance; it is the sunshine, not the sun; the quickening\r\n_something_, call it what you will, that gives life to trade, gives\r\nbeing to the branches and moisture to the root; it is the oil of\r\nthe wheel, the marrow in the bones, the blood in the veins, and\r\nthe spirits in the heart of all the negoce, trade, cash, and commerce\r\nin the world.'\r\n\r\n'It is produced, and grows insensibly from fair and upright dealing,\r\npunctual compliance, honorable performance of contracts and covenants;\r\nin short, it is the offspring of universal probity.\r\n\r\n'It is apparent even by its nature; it is no way dependent upon\r\npersons, parliament, or any particular men or set of men, as such,\r\nin the world, but upon their conduct and just behavior.  Credit\r\nnever was chained to men's names, but to their actions; not to\r\nfamilies, clans, or collections of men; no, not to nations.  It is\r\nthe honor, the justice, the fair dealing, and the equal conduct of\r\nmen, bodies of men, nations, and people, that raise the thing called\r\ncredit among them.  Wheresoever this is found, credit will live\r\nand thrive, grow and increase; where this is wanting, let all the\r\npower and wit of man join together, they can neither give her being\r\nnor preserve her life.\r\n\r\n'Arts have been tried on various occasions in the world to raise\r\ncredit; art has been found able with more ease to destroy credit\r\nthan to raise it.  The force of art, assisted by the punctual,\r\nfair, and just dealing abovesaid, may have done much to form a\r\ncredit upon the face of things, but we find still the honor would\r\nhave done it without the art, but never the art without the honor.\r\nNor will money itself, which, Solomon says, answers all things,\r\npurchase this thing called credit or restore it when lost. . . .\r\n\r\n'Our credit in this case is a public thing.  It is rightly called\r\nby some of our writers _national credit_.  The word denominates\r\nits original.  It is produced by the nation's probity, the honor\r\nand exact performing national engagements.'\r\n\r\n\"And, sir, passing from considerations of public honor, there are\r\nmany reasons of _public policy_ which forbid the repeal of the act\r\nof 1875.  That act was generally regarded as the settlement of a\r\nfinancial policy by which at least the party in power is bound,\r\nand upon the faith of which business men have conducted their\r\naffairs and made their contracts.  Debts have been contracted and\r\npaid with the expectation that at the time fixed the gold standard\r\nwould measure all obligations, and a repeal of the act would now\r\nreopen all the wild and dangerous speculation schemes that feed\r\nand fatter upon depreciated paper money.  The influence that secures\r\nthis repeal will not stop here.  If we can recall our promise to\r\npay our notes outstanding why should we not issue more?  If we can\r\ndisregard our promise to pay them, why shall we regard our promise\r\nnot to issue more than $400,000,000, as stipulated for by the act\r\nof 1864?  If we can reopen the question of the payment of our notes,\r\nwhy may we not reopen the question as to the payment of our bonds?\r\nIs the act of 1869 any more sacred than the act of 1875?  And if\r\nwe can reopen these questions, why not reopen the laws requiring\r\nthe payment of either interest or principal of the public debt?\r\nThey rest upon acts of Congress which we have the power to repeal.\r\nIf the public honor cannot protect our promise to the note holder,\r\nhow shall it protect our promise to the bondholder?  Already do we\r\nsee advocated in high places, by numerous and formidable organizations,\r\nall forms of repudiation, which, if adopted, would reduce our nation\r\nto the credit of a robber chief--worse than the credit of an Algerine\r\npirate, who at least would not plunder his own countrymen.  And if\r\nthe public creditor had no safety, what chance would the national\r\nbanks--creations of our own and subject to our will--have in\r\nCongress?  It has already been proposed to confiscate their bonds,\r\npremium and all, as a mode of paying their notes with greenbacks.\r\nWhat expedient so easy if we would make money cheap and abundant?\r\nOr, if so extreme a measure could be arrested, what is to prevent\r\nthe permanent dethronement of gold as a measure of value, and the\r\nsubstitution of an interconvertible currency bond, bearing three\r\nand sixty-five hundredths per cent. interest, as a standard of\r\nvalue; and when it become too expensive to print the notes to pay\r\nthe interest, reduce the rate.  Why not?  Why pay three and sixty-\r\nfive hundredths per cent., when it is easier to print three?  It is\r\nbut an act of Congress.  And when the process of repudiation goes\r\nso far that your notes will not buy bread, why then declare against\r\nall interest, and then, after passing through the valley of\r\nhumiliation, return again to barter, and honor, and gold again.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if you once commence this downward course of repudiation then\r\nthere is but one ending.  You may, like Mirabeau and the Girondists,\r\nseek to stem the torrent, but you will be swept away by the spirit\r\nyou have evoked and the instrument you have created.  You complain\r\nnow of a want of confidence which makes men hoard their money.\r\nWill you, then, destroy all confidence?  No, sir, no; the way to\r\n_restore_ confidence is to _inspire_ it by fulfilling your obligations.\r\nYou cannot make men lend you; you cannot make men sell you anything\r\n--either bread, or meat, or wool, or iron, or anything that is or\r\nthat can be created--except for that which they choose to take.\r\nYou may depreciate the money which you offer, but it will only take\r\nmore of it to buy what you want.  It is true that the creditor may,\r\nby your laws, be compelled to take your money however much you\r\ndepreciate it, but he cannot buy back that which he sold, or its\r\nequivalent in other necessaries of life, and thus he is cheated of\r\npart of what he sold.  During the war, when money was depreciating,\r\nmany a simple man gladly counted his gains as he sold his goods or\r\ncrops at advancing prices, but he found out his mistake when, with\r\nhis swollen pile, he tried to replace his stock in trade or laid\r\nin his supplies.  Sir, this policy exhausts itself in cheating the\r\nman who buys or sells or loans on credit, who produces something\r\nto sell on credit; whether that something be food or clothing;\r\nwhether it be a necessity or a luxury of life.  Productive labor,\r\nhonest toil, whether of the farmer or the artisan, is deeply\r\ninterested in credit.  It is credit that gives life and competition\r\nto trade; and credit is destroyed by every scheme that impairs,\r\ndelays, or even clouds an obligation.\r\n\r\n\"Again, sir, an irredeemable and fluctuating currency always raises\r\nthe rate of interest on money, while a stable currency or an\r\nimproving currency always reduces the rate of interest.  This is\r\neasily shown by statistics, but the reason is so obvious that proof\r\nis not needed.  If a man lends his money he wants it back again\r\nwith its increase; but if the money, when it is to be paid back,\r\nis like to be worth less than when he thinks of loaning it, he will\r\nnot loan it except at such rates as will cover the risk of\r\ndepreciation.  He will prefer to buy land or something of stable\r\nvalue.  If money is at the gold standard, or is advancing toward\r\nthat standard, he will loan it readily at a moderate interest, for\r\nhe knows he will receive back money of at least equal value to that\r\nhe loaned.  Again, sir, with a depreciated currency great domestic\r\nproductions are cut off from the foreign market; for it is impossible\r\nthat with such a currency we can compete on equal terms with rival\r\nnations, whose industry rests upon a specie standard.  As we approach\r\nsuch a standard, we are now able, as to a few articles, to compete\r\nwith foreign industry; but it is only as to articles in the\r\nmanufacture of which we have peculiar advantages.  Let us rest our\r\nindustries on that standard, and soon we could compete in the\r\nmarkets of the world in all the articles produced from iron, wood,\r\nleather, and cotton, the raw basis of which are our national\r\nproductions.  And it must be remembered that all the countries with\r\nwhich we compete are specie-paying countries.\r\n\r\n\"A country that does not rest her industry upon specie is necessarily\r\nexcluded from the great manufacturing industries of modern\r\ncivilization, and is self-condemned to produce only the raw basis\r\nfor advanced industry.  Cheap food, climate, soil, or natural\r\nadvantages, such as cheap land, vast plains for pasture, or rich\r\nmines, may give to a country wealth and prosperity in spite of the\r\nevils of depreciated paper money; but when we come in competition\r\nwith the world in the advanced grades of production which give\r\nemployment to the skilled mechanic, we must rest such industry upon\r\nthe gold basis, or we enter the lists like a knight with his armor\r\nunbound.\r\n\r\n\"Again, sir, a depreciated and fluctuating currency is a premium\r\nand bounty to the broker and money changer.  Under his manipulation\r\nour paper standard of value goes up and down, and he gambles and\r\nspeculates, with all the advantages in his favor.  Good people look\r\non and think that it is gold that is going up and down; that their\r\nmoney is a dollar still, and trade and traffic in that belief.\r\nBut the shrewd speculator calculates daily the depreciation of our\r\nnote, the shortening of the yard stick, the shrinkage of the acre,\r\nthe lessening of the ton, and thus it is that he daily adds to his\r\ngains from the indifference or delusion of our people.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is an old story, often repeated in our day, and most\r\neloquently epitomized by Daniel Webster in the often-quoted passage\r\nof his speech, in which he said:\r\n\r\n'A disordered currency is one of the greatest of political evils.\r\nIt undermines the virtues necessary for the support of the social\r\nsystem and encourages propensities destructive of its happiness.\r\nIt wars against industry, frugality, and economy; and it fosters\r\nthe evil spirit of extravagance and speculation.  Of all contrivances\r\nfor cheating the laboring classes of mankind, none has been more\r\neffectual than that which deluded them with paper money.  Ordinary\r\ntyranny, oppression, excessive taxation, these bear lightly upon\r\nthe happiness of the mass of the community, compared with the\r\nfraudulent currencies and the robberies committed by depreciated\r\npaper.  Our own history has recorded for our instruction enough,\r\nand more than enough, of the demoralizing tendency, the injustice,\r\nand the intolerable oppression of the virtuous and well-disposed,\r\nof a degraded paper currency authorized by law or in any way\r\ncountenanced by government.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we must meet this question of specie payments, not only\r\nbecause the public honor is pledged to do so, but also for the\r\nlesser reason that it is our interest to do so.  The only questions\r\nwe should permit ourselves to discuss are the means and measures\r\nof doing so.\r\n\r\n\"And now, sir, let us examine the reasons that have been given for\r\nthe repeal of the resumption act by those who, though favoring\r\nresumption, yet think the act should be repealed for one or other\r\nof the following reasons:\r\n\r\n  \"First.  That it is not advisable to fix a day for resumption.\r\n  \"Second.  Or at least until the balance of trade is in our favor.\r\n  \"Third.  That it produces a contraction of the currency.\r\n  \"Fourth.  That it injuriously adds to the burden of existing\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\n\"Let us glance at these objections.\r\n\r\n\"First.  As to fixing a day for resumption.\r\n\r\n\"If it was possible to agree upon measures that would secure\r\nresumption without fixing a time, I agree it would not be indispensable,\r\nthough not unadvisable, to fix a time; but such agreement is utterly\r\nimpossible.  Of the multitude of schemes that have been presented\r\nto me by intelligent men trying to solve this problem, many could\r\nhave been selected that in my opinion would be practicable; but of\r\nall of them not one ever has or is likely to secure the assent of\r\na majority of a body so numerous as Congress.  One difficulty we\r\nhave encountered is that the Democratic party, though in the\r\nminority, has never presented in any form, through any leading\r\nmember, a plan for resumption, but with widely differing opinions\r\nhas joined in opposing any and every measure from the other side.\r\nI understand from the papers that our Democratic friends, through\r\na caucus, and through a caucus committee of which my colleague is\r\nchairman, have been laboring to agree upon a plan for specie\r\npayments.  After his frequent speeches to us about secret conclaves,\r\nabout shams and deceptions, and such like polite and friendly\r\ncomments upon the work of the Republican party, I might greet my\r\ncolleague with such happy phrases about _his_ caucus; but I will\r\nnot, but, on the contrary, I commend his labors, and sincerely hope\r\nthat he and his political friends may agree upon some plan to reach\r\na specie standard, and not one to avoid to, to prevent it, to defer\r\nit.  Under color of intending to prepare for it, I hope they will\r\nnot make their measure the pretext for repealing the law as it\r\nstands, which fixes a day for resumption and will secure the end\r\nwe both aim at.\r\n\r\n\"I frankly state for the Republican party that, while we could\r\nagree to fixing the time for specie payments and upon conferring\r\nthe ample and sufficient powers upon the Secretary of the Treasury\r\ncontained in the law, we could not agree in prescribing the precise\r\nmode in which the process should be executed.  Nor, in my opinion,\r\nwas it at all essential that we should.  Much must be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the officer charged with the execution of such a law.\r\nThe powers conferred, as I shall show hereafter, are ample; and\r\nthe discretion given will be executed under the eye of Congress.\r\n\r\n\"And, sir, there is a strong force in the fact that in every example\r\nwe have of the successful resumption of specie payments, in this\r\nand other countries, a fixed day has been named by legislative\r\nauthority, and the details and power of execution have been left\r\nto executive authority.  Thus, in Great Britain, the act of parliament\r\nof July 2, 1819, fixed the time for full resumption at the 1st day\r\nof May, 1823, and for a graduated resumption in gold at intermediate\r\ndates; and for fractional sums under forty shillings to be paid in\r\nsilver coin; and the governor and directors of the Bank of England\r\nwere charged with its execution, and authorized at their discretion\r\nto resume payment in full on the 1st day of May, 1822.  France is\r\nnow successfully passing through the same process of resumption,\r\nthe time being fixed (two years ago) for January 1, 1878, and now\r\npractically attained.\r\n\r\n\"In our own country many of the states have presented similar laws\r\nin case of suspended bank payments, and in some cases the suspended\r\nbanks have, by associated action, fixed a time for general resumption,\r\nand each bank adopted its own expedient for it.  Sir, the light of\r\nexperience is the lamp of wisdom.  I can recall no case of successful\r\nresumption where a fixed future time has not been presented\r\nbeforehand, either by law or agreement; while the historical examples\r\nof repudiation of currency have come by the drifting process, by\r\na gradual decline of value, by increased issues, and a refusal to\r\nprovide measures of redemption, until the whole mass disappeared,\r\ndishonored and repudiated.\r\n\r\n\"This concurrence in the mode of resumption by so many governments\r\nwas the strongest possible instruction to Congress when fixing a\r\nplan of resumption for the United States, and should satisfy\r\nreasonable men of its wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, it would seem to be but fair that everyone should have\r\nplain notice of so important a fact.  If the measures only were\r\npresented and no time fixed it would be a matter of speculation,\r\nand the discretionary powers of the Secretary of the Treasury could\r\nbe exercised with a view to hasten or postpone the time to the\r\ninjury of individuals.\r\n\r\n\"As to the date selected, I can only repeat it was placed as remote\r\nas any one suggested; far more so than is necessary to secure the\r\nobject, and so that the fluctuations of value will scarcely exceed\r\nin four years what they have frequently been in a single year.  It\r\nallows ample time to arrange all the relations of debtor and\r\ncreditor, and to enable Congress to provide any additional measure\r\nin aid of redemption, or, if events make it expedient, to postpone\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nMY CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESS OF RESUMPTION.\r\nTendency of Democratic Members of Both Houses to Exaggerate the\r\nEvil Times--Debate Over the Bill to Provide for Issuing Silver Coin\r\nin Place of Fractional Currency--The Coinage Laws of the United\r\nStates and Other Countries--Joint Resolution for the Issue of Silver\r\nCoins--The \"Trade Dollar\" Declared Not to Be a Legal Tender--My\r\nViews on the Free Coinage of Silver--Bill to Provide for the\r\nCompletion of the Washington Monument--Resolution Written by Me on\r\nthe 100th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence--Unanimously\r\nPassed in a Day by Both Houses--Completion of the Structure Under\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be the policy of a majority of the Democratic Members\r\nof both the Senate and the House to exaggerate the evils and\r\ndiscouragements of the times, while in fact the people were rapidly\r\nrecovering from the results of the panic of 1873, and all branches\r\nof industry were, to a greater or less extent, starting into life\r\nanew, and to prevent the resumption of specie payments, and, if\r\npossible, to repeal the act providing for such resumption.  This\r\npolicy undoubtedly checked the process of refunding the public\r\ndebt, which progressed slowly, and was confined to an exchange of\r\nbonds bearing five per cent. interest for those bearing six per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nI took a much more hopeful view of the situation, and in the many\r\nspeeches I made in that Congress, I stated my confidence, not only\r\nin the process of resumption and refunding, but in the rapid\r\nimprovement of all branches of industry as we progressed towards\r\nspecie payments.  In a speech I made in the Senate on the 6th of\r\nJanuary, 1876, on a bill \"to further provide for the redemption of\r\nlegal tender United States notes in accordance with existing law,\"\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we ought to take a hopeful view of things in this centennial\r\nyear of our country.  Look at the aggregate results.  A century\r\nago we were three million people; now forty million; then we had\r\na little border on the Atlantic; we are now extended to the Pacific.\r\nSee what has been accomplished in a hundred years.  During that\r\ntime there have been periods of darkness and doubt.  Every seven\r\nor ten or twelve years, periodically, there have been times of\r\nfinancial distress.  We have lived through them all.  I believe,\r\nand I trust in God, that this very year is the beginning of another\r\nperiod of prosperity, and that all these dark clouds, which gentlemen\r\nare trying to raise up from the memory of the past two or three\r\nyears and from their own clouded imaginations, will entirely\r\ndisappear.  I believe that even now we are in the sunshine of\r\nincreasing prosperity, and that every day and every hour will add\r\nto our wealth and relieve us from our distress.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, things are not so unhopeful as Senators seem to think.  We\r\nhave made a promise to be executed three years hence, and every\r\nstep of our legislation, if any is had, should look in that direction.\r\nWe may not adopt any measure or may not deem that any is necessary;\r\nbut, if any be adopted, it ought to look to the execution of that\r\npromise, and we ought to enter on the performance of this duty with\r\nhopeful trust in the continued prosperity of our country.  All this\r\ngloom and doubt, all this arraignment of official statements, this\r\ndoubt of our sufficient revenues, this doubt of our ability to meet\r\nand advance our destiny, always falls upon my ear with painful\r\nsurprise.  Senators, the task we have before us may be a difficult\r\none, as it has always proved to be difficult to resume the specie\r\nstandard whenever, for any reason, a nation has fallen from it,\r\nbut it is a duty that must be executed, and it ought to be executed\r\nwithout the spirit of party warfare, without these appeals, directly\r\nor indirectly, to party tactics.  The pledges made one year ago,\r\nalthough not voted for by the Democratic party, are pledges binding\r\nupon their honor and their faith as they are upon mine, and I trust\r\nin God that we shall join together in all the proper steps to carry\r\nout those pledges.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill was referred to the committee on finance, but no action\r\nwas taken upon it, as the committee preferred to await the action\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\nThe resumption act provided for the payment and destruction of the\r\nfractional currency then in circulation, to the amount of $40,000,000,\r\nand the substitution of silver coins in all respects, such as were\r\ndefined by the coinage act of 1853.  This was to be the first step\r\nin preparation for the general resumption of coin payments in\r\nJanuary, 1879.  It became necessary to provide for the coinage of\r\nfractional silver coins, and a bill for this purpose, entitled \"A\r\nbill to provide for a deficiency in the Printing and Engraving\r\nBureau, and for the issue of the silver coin of the United States,\r\nin place of the fractional currency,\" was reported by Mr. Randall,\r\non the 2nd of March, 1876, from the committee on appropriations of\r\nthe House.  It was subsequently considered, amended and passed by\r\nthe House, after a long debate, participated in by many of the\r\nleading Members.  Much to my surprise, Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Ward,\r\nprominent Members from New York, opposed the measure, denounced\r\nthe resumption act, and prophesied its failure.  Mr. Hewitt, in\r\nsupport of his position, quoted passages from the reports of Mr.\r\nBristow, then Secretary of the Treasury, and predicted the utter\r\nfailure of resumption, unless the United States notes were entirely\r\nwithdrawn.  He insisted that if silver coin was issued to replace\r\nfractional currency, the coin would disappear from circulation,\r\nleaving the people without any currency for the smaller necessities\r\nof life.  In the progress of the debate, it became manifest that\r\nthe larger portion of the Democratic Members would vote against\r\nevery measure proposed to aid in the execution of the resumption\r\nact.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the House on the 31st of March by the vote of 123\r\nyeas and 100 nays.  In the Senate it was referred to the committee\r\non finance, and reported back with amendments.  The third section\r\nof the bill, as it came from the House, provided for the coinage\r\nof the silver dollar, of the weight of 412.8 grains troy, standard\r\nsilver, and made that dollar a legal tender at its nominal value,\r\nto an amount not exceeding twenty dollars in any one payment, except\r\nfor customs duties and interest on the public debt, and that the\r\n\"trade dollar\" should not, thereafter, be a legal coin.  This\r\nsection was stricken out.\r\n\r\nIn the remarks made by me, upon this bill, on the 10th day of April,\r\n1876 , I gave, in detail, the history of each of the coinage laws\r\nof Great Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.\r\nI had taken great pains to collect this information and to procure\r\ntranslations of the laws of the several countries named.  The then\r\nrecent changes, made by Germany, and their effect upon the coinage\r\nof other nations, were carefully stated.  The general conclusion\r\nwhich I drew from a reference to these statutes of various countries,\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n\"First.  It is impossible, in the nature of things, to fix the\r\nprecise value of silver and gold.  We have tried it three times\r\nand failed.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  Whenever either coin is worth more in the market than\r\nthe rate fixed by the law, it flees from the country.  That we have\r\ntwice proved.  That is the admitted economic law.  It is the Gresham\r\nlaw; a law of currency named from the name of its discoverer.  He\r\nwrote a book to show that always the poorer currency would drive\r\nout of circulation a superior currency; and his book gave name to\r\nthe theory that is called the law of Gresham.  It is the universal\r\nlaw of political economy that, whenever two metals or two moneys\r\nare in circulation, the least valuable will drive out the most\r\nvaluable; the latter will be exported.\r\n\r\n\"The third proposition is that the example of several great European\r\nnations, as well as of the United States, proves that to prevent\r\nthe depreciation of silver the tendency of modern nations is to\r\nissue it as a token coinage somewhat less in intrinsic value than\r\ngold, and maintain its value by issuing it only as needed, at par\r\nwith the prevailing currency, and to make it a limited legal tender.\r\nI may say that has been acted upon by every great Christian nation.\r\nRussia and Austria have not yet gold coinage at all, but still they\r\nhave their values based upon gold.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  That the demonetization of silver tends to add to the\r\nvalue of gold, and that though the relative value ebbs and flows\r\nit is more stable compared to gold than any other metal, grain, or\r\nproduction.  Its limit of variation for a century is between fifteen\r\nto seventeen for one in gold.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  That both coins are indispensable, one for small and the\r\nother for large transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth.  That the causes of the decline of silver are temporary.\r\nIt is still used by a great majority of mankind as the standard of\r\nvalue.  Its use in France and the United States will, on resumption,\r\nmore than counteract its decline in Germany.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh.  The general monetizing of silver now, when it is\r\nunnaturally depreciated, would be to invite to our country, in\r\nexchange for gold or bonds, all the silver of Europe, and at last\r\nit would leave us with a depreciated currency.\r\n\r\n\"Eighth.  The decline of silver enables us now to exchange silver\r\ncoin of the old standard for fractional currency, leaving the\r\nexchange optional with the holder, until we have the courage, as\r\nwe now have the ability, to redeem it in gold.\r\n\r\n\"Ninth.  More silver can be maintained at par than we have now of\r\nfractional currency.\r\n\r\n\"Tenth.  The redemption of a part of our currency would advance\r\nits purchasing power, while the silver in circulation will counteract\r\nthe contraction of the currency.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill became a law on the 17th of April, 1876.  The second\r\nsection provided:\r\n\r\n\"That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed to issue\r\nsilver coins of the United States of the denomination of ten,\r\ntwenty, twenty-five and fifty cents of standard value, in redemption\r\nof an equal amount of fractional currency, whether the same be now\r\nin the treasury awaiting redemption, or whenever it may be presented\r\nfor redemption; and the Secretary of the Treasury may, under\r\nregulations of the treasury department, provide for such redemption\r\nand issue by substitution, at the regular sub-treasuries and public\r\ndepositaries of the United States, until the whole amount of\r\nfractional currency outstanding shall be redeemed.  And the fractional\r\ncurrency redeemed under this act shall be held to be a part of the\r\nsinking fund provided for by existing law, the interest to be\r\ncomputed thereon as in the case of bonds redeemed under the act\r\nrelating to the sinking fund.\"\r\n\r\nA joint resolution for the issue of silver coin was introduced in\r\nthe House by Mr. Frost, of Massachusetts, on the 1st of May, 1876.\r\nThe object of this resolution was to expedite the issue of minor\r\ncoin and the retirement of fractional currency.  It was referred\r\nto the committee on finance, reported favorably and passed with\r\namendments June 21.  The House disagreed to the amendments of the\r\nSenate, and a committee of conference was appointed composed of\r\nJohn Sherman, George S. Boutwell, and Louis V. Bogy, managers on\r\nthe part of the Senate, and H. B. Payne, and Samuel J. Randall,\r\nmanagers on the part of the House.  The report of the conferees\r\nwas agreed to, and the bill having passed both Houses it was approved\r\nby the President on the 22nd of July.  It provided:\r\n\r\n\"That the Secretary of the Treasury, under such limits and regulations\r\nas will best secure a just and fair distribution of the same through\r\nthe country, may issue the silver coin at any time in the treasury\r\nto an amount not exceeding ten million dollars, in exchange for an\r\nequal amount of legal tender notes; and the notes so received in\r\nexchange shall be kept as a special fund, separate and apart from\r\nall other money in the treasury, and be reissued only upon the\r\nretirement and destruction of a like sum of fractional currency\r\nreceived at the treasury in payment of dues to the United States;\r\nand said fractional currency, when so substituted, shall be destroyed\r\nand held as part of the sinking fund, as provided in the act approved\r\nApril seventeen, eighteen hundred and seventy-six.\"\r\n\r\nIt also provided:  \"That the trade dollar shall not hereafter be\r\na legal tender, and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized\r\nto limit, from time to time, the coinage thereof to such an amount\r\nas he may deem sufficient to meet the export demand for the same.\"\r\n\r\nIt also provided that the amount of subsidiary silver coin authorized\r\nshould not exceed $50,000,000.  The silver bullion was to be\r\npurchased from time to time at market price by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury from any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated,\r\nand any gain or seigniorage arising from the coinage was to be paid\r\ninto the treasury.\r\n\r\nThese provisions in respect to subsidiary coin were in a large\r\nmeasure executed prior to the 4th of March, 1877, and tended, in\r\nmy opinion, to facilitate the progress of the resumption of specie\r\npayments on the 1st of January, 1879.  The debate on these measures\r\noccupied a large portion of the time of both Houses of Congress,\r\nand presented in every possible aspect all the financial questions\r\ninvolved in coinage, resumption and refunding.  Anyone desiring a\r\nfull knowledge of the view then taken of the act revising the laws\r\nin respect to coins and coinage, approved February 12, 1873, will\r\nfind in the debate a full history of that act, given at a time when\r\nit was fresh in the memory of the great body of Senators and\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\nI supported the coinage of the old silver dollar in a speech in\r\nthe Senate made on the 8th of June, 1876, two years before the\r\nappearance of the \"Bland bill,\" or the \"Allison bill.\"  Silver\r\nbullion was then declining in market value.  The resumption act\r\nprovided for the gradual replacement of fractional currency by\r\nsilver coins of the character and form provided for by the coinage\r\nact of 1853.  When that act passed the old silver dollar was not\r\ncoined or in circulation.  It was more valuable in the market than\r\na dollar in gold, and, if coined, would have been exported as\r\nbullion.  In the revision of the coinage laws of 1873, it was\r\ndropped from the list of coins, and its further coinage was prohibited\r\nby a clause providing that no coins should be made at the mint\r\nexcept those provided for in that act.  The history of this act\r\nand the reasons for prohibiting the coinage of the old dollar have\r\nbeen fully stated in a previous chapter of this work.  In place of\r\nthe old dollar the trade dollar, containing 420 grains of silver,\r\nwas provided for.  This trade dollar, coined for, and at the expense\r\nof, the owner of the bullion deposited at the mint, was, in the\r\nrevision of the laws of the United States, unintentionally made a\r\nlegal tender for five dollars, the same as the minor coins issued\r\nby the mint on government account.  As silver declined in value,\r\nthe trade dollar became less valuable than a dollar in gold, and\r\nthe owners of bullion deposited it in the mint, and received in\r\nexchange trade dollars costing less than a dollar in gold, but,\r\nbeing a legal tender for five dollars, it could be forced upon the\r\npeople of California, then upon the gold standard, at a profit to\r\nthe owner of the bullion.  Mr. Sargent, a Senator from California,\r\nearly in the session introduced a bill enlarging the limit of legal\r\ntender of minor coins, and repealing the legal tender quality of\r\nthe trade dollar.  This bill was referred to the committee on\r\nfinance, and was reported with an amendment to strike out all after\r\nthe enacting clause, and insert:\r\n\r\n\"That section 3586 of the Revised Statutes of the United States\r\nbe, and hereby is, amended to read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The silver coins of the United States, except the trade dollar,\r\nshall be a legal tender at their nominal value for any amount not\r\nexceeding five dollars in any one payment.\"\r\n\r\nThis simple bill was made the text of a long debate in the Senate\r\nthat continued during the greater part of that session.  The\r\nprovision that \"the trade dollar shall not hereafter be a legal\r\ntender\" was transferred to the joint resolution already mentioned\r\nwhich became a law on the 22nd of July.\r\n\r\nIn my speech on Mr. Sargent's bill I said:\r\n\r\n\"This bill proposes to restore the old silver dollar, and with it\r\nand the subsidiary coins of the United States to redeem the United\r\nStates notes and fractional currency.  The dollar to be restored\r\nis the same dollar that had existed from 1792 to 1873; and the\r\nsubsidiary coins to be issued are the same in form and value as\r\nhave been issued since 1853.  I have already stated in my remarks,\r\nmade on the 11th of April last, the history of these silver coins\r\nand the relation of silver and gold to each other, not only in the\r\nUnited States, but in the countries with which we have the most\r\nextensive commercial relations.\r\n\r\n\"The two main questions are:\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"First.  Shall silver coin be exchanged for United States notes as\r\nwell as for fractional currency?  And,\r\n\r\n\"Second.  Is it wise to recoin the old silver dollar with a view\r\nto exchange it for United States notes?\"\r\n\r\nIn this speech I favored the restoration of the silver dollar of\r\nthe precise character and description of the dollar that existed\r\nfrom 1792 to 1873, but, as the market value of the silver in this\r\ndollar had greatly fallen, I insisted that the dollar should be\r\ncoined from bullion purchased by the government at market price,\r\nso that the people of the United States would receive the difference\r\nbetween the cost of the bullion and the face value of the coin,\r\nthe same principle that was adopted in what is known as the Bland-\r\nAllison act of 1878.  I did not, however, propose the full legal\r\ntender quality that was given to the dollar by the act when adopted,\r\nbut that it should be placed among the other silver coins, and be\r\na legal tender only for twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by me was to set aside a portion of the surplus\r\nrevenue or sinking fund of each year applicable to the payment of\r\nthe public debt, for the purchase of silver bullion to be coined\r\ninto silver dollars of the old standard.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"The bill reported by the committee on finance thus provides for\r\nan immediate resumption of specie payments in silver coin, and thus\r\ncompletes the first and most difficult step of the problem.  It\r\nneither disturbs nor deranges business, nor stirs up the phantom\r\nof contraction.  It is in exact accordance with existing law, and\r\nleaves the silver coin, as now, a subsidiary coin, a legal tender\r\nonly for limited amounts.\r\n\r\n\"The next question presented by this bill is, shall we return to\r\nour silver coinage the old silver dollar.  And here I am met by\r\nthe objections of the Senator from Vermont, but his objections are\r\nrather to the amendments proposed by the Senator from Missouri,\r\nthan to the report of the committee.  The committee propose the\r\nsilver dollar, not as a legal tender for gold contracts, but only\r\nas a tender for currency contracts not exceeding twenty dollars in\r\nany one payment.  I would prefer to leave the silver dollar and\r\nstand upon its intrinsic value as a legal tender the same as the\r\nsmaller coin; but there is no injustice in enlarging the limit to\r\ntwenty dollars, and but for the reasons I will state hereafter\r\nthere is no injustice in making it a legal tender for all currency\r\ncontracts.  The silver dollar has that intrinsic value which in\r\nall periods of our history has made it a favorite coin, not only\r\nfor domestic uses but for exportation.  It furnishes silver bullion\r\nin a shape and form more convenient for handling than any other\r\nform of coin.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"When the old silver dollars are issued at par with the United\r\nStates notes, a large amount of them will be taken as a reserve by\r\nthe people to meet future needs, with or without a legal tender\r\nquality.  As their issue is not peremptory, and the aggregate cannot\r\nexceed the surplus revenue or sinking fund, there is no danger of\r\nan overissue, while their existence among the people will be the\r\nbest reserve when gold alone becomes the full standard of value.\r\n\r\n\"Every argument already mentioned in favor of subsidiary silver\r\ncoins is equally potent in favor of the silver dollar.  It will be\r\neagerly taken in payment of United States notes.  It is purely a\r\nvoluntary exchange.  It is the cheapest mode in which we can redeem\r\nUnited States notes.  It is specie resumption in the old time-\r\nhonored standard of silver dollars of full weight and fineness.\r\nIt will accustom our people to distinguish between the real dollar\r\nthat pays where it goes and a paper dollar which only promises to\r\npay.  It will prepare the way for full resumption in gold.  To the\r\nextent proposed by the committee, and to be used as a purely\r\nvoluntary approach to a full specie standard, it is open to no\r\nobjection or criticism, and should be assented to by gentlemen who\r\nhave differed with each other on the present resumption law or on\r\nthe merits and dangers of contraction and expansion.\"\r\n\r\nThe vital difference between the free coinage of silver, and the\r\nlimited coinage of that metal on government account, is that with\r\nfree coinage the standard of value would be the cheaper money.\r\nWith silver at its present price in the market the dollar would be\r\nworth but a little over fifty cents.  The coinage being free to\r\nthe holders of silver bullion no other coins would be made except\r\nthe cheaper coins of least purchasing power.  On the other hand,\r\nthe coinage of silver on government account enables us to maintain\r\nthe silver coins at par with gold, without respect to the market\r\nvalue of the silver bullion.  Any nominal profit from this coinage\r\ninures to the benefit of the whole people of the United States and\r\nnot merely to the producers of silver bullion.  This distinction\r\nhas always appeared to me so marked and clear, and the argument so\r\nstrong in favor of limiting the coinage of silver to the amount\r\ndemanded as a convenience of the people for the smaller transactions\r\nof life, that I cannot sympathize with a policy that aims merely\r\nto secure the cheapest money for the discharge of obligations\r\ncontracted upon more valuable money.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures that became a law at this session was a concurrent\r\nresolution, introduced by me in the Senate on the 5th of July,\r\n1876, to provide for the completion of the Washington monument.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th of July, 1876, the 100th anniversary of\r\nAmerican independence, I was making some preparation for the\r\ncelebration of that day in the vicinity of Washington.  Animated\r\nby the patriotic feeling inspired by the day, and sitting in view\r\nof the unfinished monument of George Washington, I felt that the\r\ntime had come when this monument should no longer continue a standing\r\nreproach to a patriotic people.  Shortly after the death of\r\nWashington, a resolution providing for the erection of a monument\r\nto his memory, was agreed to by both Houses of Congress.  Subsequently,\r\non January 1, 1801, a bill was passed by the House of Representatives\r\nappropriating $200,000 for this purpose, but, in the political\r\nexcitements of that day, the Senate failed to concur.  In the\r\nabsorbing public questions that ensued, resulting in the War of\r\n1812, the subject was dropped in Congress for the time.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the \"Washington Monument Society\" was formed, with Chief\r\nJustice Marshall as its president.  This society proposed to raise\r\nthe necessary sum to erect such a monument by voluntary subscriptions\r\nof individuals, and in 1854 it had, by such means, constructed\r\nabout one-third of the height of the monument and then suspended\r\nwork.  Thus it had remained for years for want of means to complete\r\nit, a glaring evidence of failure.  The portion of the monument\r\nalready reared to the height of 156 feet stood in rude outline, an\r\nabandoned failure in the midst of a reservation partly covered with\r\nwater and broken stone.  The society was incorporated by Congress\r\nin 1859, but no further progress was made.  It was manifest that\r\nthe work could not be completed by the existing organization, and\r\ndoubts were expressed whether the foundation was sufficient to bear\r\nthe superstructure.  Under these conditions, on the 100th anniversary\r\nof the declaration of American independence, it occurred to me the\r\ntime had arrived when a great country like ours should complete\r\nthis unfinished monument to George Washington.  Under the inspiration\r\nof this thought I wrote this resolution on the morning of the 4th\r\nof July, and on the next morning offered it for adoption in the\r\nSenate:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, It has pleased Almighty God to guide the United States\r\nof America safely through one hundred years of national life, and\r\nto crown our nation with the highest blessing of civil and religious\r\nliberty, Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"The Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled, in\r\nthe name of the people of the United States, in reverent thankfulness\r\nacknowledge the fountain and source, the author and giver of all\r\nthese blessings, and our dependence upon His providence and will;\r\nand,\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, We recognize, as our fathers did, that George Washington,\r\n'first in peace, first in war, and first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen,' was one of the chief instruments of Divine Providence\r\nin securing American independence and in laying broad and deep the\r\nfoundations of our liberties in the constitution of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, as a mark of our sense of the honor due to his name\r\nand to his compatriots and associates, our revolutionary fathers,\r\n\r\n\"We, the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled,\r\nin the name of the people of the United States at this, the beginning\r\nof the second century of national existence, do assume and direct\r\nthe completion of the Washington monument in the city of Washington,\r\nand instruct the committees on appropriations of the respective\r\nHouses to propose suitable provisions of law to carry this resolution\r\ninto effect.\"\r\n\r\nIn submitting this resolution I said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to offer at this time a concurrent resolution  I wish to\r\nsay before it is read that I believe if it were passed to-day it\r\nwould be a matter of profound satisfaction to the great body of\r\nthe people of the United States.  I ask that it be read.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the resolution was read, there was a pause, when Mr. Edmunds\r\nsaid:  \"Let us consider this resolution.  It will be agreed to\r\nunanimously, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was therefore considered and agreed to unanimously.\r\nIt was sent to the House of Representatives the next morning, when\r\nMr. Hopkins, of Pennsylvania, pending a motion to adjourn, asked\r\nunanimous consent to take from the speaker's table the concurrent\r\nresolution in reference to the Washington monument.  Upon the\r\nresolution being read, the House seemed to be impressed, as was\r\nthe Senate, with the fitness of the time, and the propriety of the\r\nmeasure proposed, and it was unanimously adopted without debate.\r\n\r\nThus Congress undertook to execute the unfinished work of the\r\nWashington Monument Society.  The requisite appropriations were\r\nsubsequently made, and the monument, as completed, is now the most\r\nimpressive token of the appreciation, by the American people, of\r\nthe name and fame of George Washington.  It is visited daily by\r\nnearly every American or stranger who enters the city of Washington.\r\nIts dedication will be hereafter mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE HAYES-TILDEN PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST.\r\nNomination of R. B. Hayes for President--His Fitness for the\r\nResponsible Office--Political Shrewdness of Samuel J. Tilden, His\r\nOpponent--I Enter Actively Into the Canvass in Ohio and Other States\r\n--Frauds in the South--Requested by General Grant to Go to New\r\nOrleans and Witness the Canvassing of the Vote of Louisiana--\r\nDeparture for the South--Personnel of the Republican and Democratic\r\n\"Visitors\"--Report of the Returning Board--My Letter to Governor\r\nHayes from New Orleans--President Grant's Last Message to Congress\r\n--Letter from President Hayes--Request to Become his Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Republican national convention of 1876 met at Cincinnati on\r\nthe 14th of June of that year.  After the usual organization the\r\nfollowing eight nominations for President were made:  Blaine,\r\nMorton, Conkling, Bristow, Hayes, Hartranft, Wheeler and Jewell.\r\nThe total number of delegates was 754.  Blaine was greatly in the\r\nlead, receiving on the first ballot 285 votes, some from nearly\r\nevery state.  Morton received 124, Bristow 113, Conkling 99, Hayes\r\n61, Hartranft 58, Jewell 11, and Wheeler 3.  There were 7 ballots,\r\nin which Blaine steadily held his vote and slightly gained, receiving\r\non the final ballot 351 votes.  The vote for Hayes increased at\r\neach ballot until on the seventh ballot he received 384 votes, a\r\nmajority over all.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Blaine was the favorite of the convention, but the\r\nantagonisms that existed between him and Conkling probably defeated\r\nhis nomination.  I still believe that the nomination of Hayes was\r\nnot only the safest, but the strongest, that could be made.  The\r\nlong possession of power by the Republicans naturally produced\r\nrivalries that greatly affected the election of anyone who had been\r\nconstantly prominent in public life, like Blaine, Conkling and\r\nMorton.  Hayes had growing qualities, and in every respect was\r\nworthy of the high position of President.  He had been a soldier,\r\na Member of Congress, thrice elected as Governor of Ohio, an\r\nadmirable executive officer, and his public and private record was\r\nbeyond question.  He was not an aggressive man, although firm in\r\nhis opinions and faithful in his friendships.  Among all the public\r\nmen with whom I have been brought in contact, I have known none\r\nwho was freer from personal objection, whose character was more\r\nstainless, who was better adapted for a high executive office, than\r\nRutherford B. Hayes.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hayes wrote me the following letter in recognition of my\r\naid in his nomination.\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., June 19, 1876.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I trust you will never regret the important action\r\nyou took in the inauguration and carrying out of the movement which\r\nresulted in my nomination.  I write these few words to assure you\r\nthat I appreciate, and am gratified for, what you did.\r\n\r\n\"My kindest regards to Mrs. Sherman.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nHis opponent, Samuel J. Tilden, was a man of singular political\r\nsagacity, of great shrewdness, a money-making man, who professed\r\nto represent, and perhaps did represent, as fairly as anyone, the\r\nideas of the New York politicians of the school of Van Buren and\r\nMarcy.  I knew Mr. Tilden personally and very favorably, as we were\r\nmembers of a board of railroad directors which frequently met.  He\r\nseemed to take pleasure in talking with me about political events,\r\nand especially of the famous New York politicians, of whom Silas\r\nWright and Mr. Van Buren were his favorites.  He had acquired great\r\nwealth as the attorney of corporations, and was undoubtedly a man\r\nof marked ability and sagacity.  He had taken an active part in\r\ndefeating the corruption of Tweed in New York politics.  He had\r\nbeen elected governor of the State of New York, as the candidate\r\nof reform and honesty in politics.\r\n\r\nThe long and important session of Congress adjourned on the 15th\r\nof August.  It had been the arena for long debates, mostly on\r\npolitical topics growing out of reconstruction, and financial\r\nmeasures heretofore referred to.  The pending presidential contest\r\nalso excited much debate in both Houses.  The administration of\r\nGeneral Grant had not been entirely satisfactory, and the long\r\ncontinuance of the Republican party in power was an element of\r\nweakness.  The complaints, unavoidable in the most honest\r\nadministration, and the disappointments of office-seekers, placed\r\nthat party on the defensive.  The south had, by reconstruction,\r\nbeen practically restored to political power, and the body of the\r\nnegroes had been substantially disfranchised, though legally entitled\r\nto the suffrage.  Riots and crimes of every degree were committed\r\nin the south, notably in Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida.\r\nOrganized mobs and violence had deterred many from voting, and in\r\nsome cases had prevented even the semblance of a free election.\r\n\r\nI entered actively into this canvass, more so than in any previous\r\none.  Three days before the adjournment, I made my opening speech\r\nat Marietta, Ohio, in which I discussed fully the dangers of the\r\nrestoration of the Democratic party to power, the probability of\r\ntheir failure to enforce the constitutional amendments, and the\r\nprotection of the rights of the freedmen.  I claimed that the\r\nelection of Mr. Tilden would result in the virtual nullification\r\nof the constitutional amendments, and amount to a practical\r\nrestoration to power of the old Democratic party.  The revival of\r\nthe rebel claims, the refunding of the cotton tax, and the damages\r\ndone to rebels, were fully commented upon, as were the outrages\r\ncommitted upon freedmen during the second administration of General\r\nGrant, the organization of Ku-Klux Klans, and the White League,\r\nand the boldness with which the laws were disregarded in the south.\r\nIt is difficult now to realize the condition of public affairs in\r\nall the states then lately in rebellion.  The people of the south\r\nare certainly entitled to the highest credit for the great change\r\nthat has recently been made in the government of their states, but\r\nit cannot be denied that during the ten years after the war their\r\ncondition bordered on the despotism of mob rule and violence.\r\nFinancial questions, no doubt, entered into the canvass, but in\r\nthis respect Governor Tilden and Governor Hayes did not materially\r\ndiffer, while public opinion in the southern states was almost a\r\nunit in favor of the larger use of paper money.  Their bankrupt\r\ncondition made this policy almost universal there.\r\n\r\nI continued until the day of election to make speeches, not only\r\nin Ohio, but in several of the states.  I engaged in a joint debate\r\nwith Senator Voorhees, of Indiana, at Columbia City, in that state,\r\nin September, which probably had more fun and humor in it than\r\nargument.  It so happened that appointments were made for each of\r\nus at Columbia City, on the same day, and the managers of the two\r\nparties concluded that they would have a joint debate, and arranged\r\nfor it, to which we both assented.  There was a great crowd, and\r\nbesides Mr. Voorhees and myself, \"Blue Jeans\" Williams, the candidate\r\nfor governor, was to open the meeting in his peculiar way, to which,\r\nas it would not at all interfere with our debate, I did not object.\r\nThe debate was fully reported in the Chicago \"Inter-Ocean,\" and is\r\na very graphic specimen of popular debates in which each side claims\r\nto be the victor.  I think it would be safe to say that from the\r\nclose of Congress until the day of election I spoke on nearly every\r\nweek day in some one of the five or six states which I visited.\r\n\r\nThe result of the presidential election in November, 1876, was\r\nextremely doubtful.  It was soon asserted that the majority either\r\nway would be very small, and that the probabilities were that Mr.\r\nTilden was elected.  Zachariah Chandler, chairman of the national\r\nRepublican committee, however, confidently telegraphed, on the\r\nmorning after the election, that Hayes was elected by a majority\r\nof one in the electoral college.  Further reports developed that\r\non account of intimidation, frauds and violence, committed in the\r\nelection in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, the vote of\r\neach of those states was doubtful, and could only be ascertained\r\nby the reports of the returning boards.  All of their electoral\r\nvotes were needed to give Hayes the majority of one.  Both parties\r\nclaimed in each of the states a majority of the popular vote.  In\r\nthe heated state of political feeling in those states, it was a\r\nmatter of grave doubt whether the count of the vote might not result\r\nin violence, tumult or war.  On the evening of November 11, I\r\nreceived from President Grant the following telegram:\r\n\r\n  \"Philadelphia, Pa., November 11, 1876.\r\n  \"Received at Mansfield, O., 8:35 p. m.\r\n\"Senator John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"I would be much pleased if you would join other parties, who have\r\nalready accepted same invitation, to go to New Orleans to witness\r\nthe canvassing of the vote of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I would go as soon as practicable, and received the\r\nfollowing answer:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., November 12, 1876.\r\n  \"Received at Mansfield, O., 4 p. m.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Unless you can reach there by Friday morning it will be too late.\r\n\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\"\r\n\r\nI at once started for New Orleans, stopping on the way at Columbus\r\nto confer with Governor Hayes, who said he wished I would go to\r\nNew Orleans, and witness the count, but expressed, in the strongest\r\npossible language, his opposition to any movement on the part of\r\nanyone to influence the action of the returning board in his favor.\r\nHe said that if Mr. Tilden was elected he desired him by all means\r\nto have the office.  I proceeded to Cincinnati, where I met some\r\nof the gentlemen whom General Grant had requested to witness the\r\ncount.  When we arrived in New Orleans I found far less excitement\r\nin respect to the count than in Ohio.  I there met the other\r\ngentlemen who had been, like myself, invited by General Grant.\r\nThey were Messrs. Stanley Matthews, Ohio; J. A. Garfield, Ohio; E.\r\nW. Stoughton, New York; J. H. Van Alen, New York; Wm. D. Kelley,\r\nPennsylvania; Job E. Stevenson, Ohio; Eugene Hale, Maine; J. M.\r\nTuttle, Iowa; J. W. Chapman, Iowa; W. R. Smith, Iowa; W. A. McGrew,\r\nIowa; Sidney Clarke, Kansas; C. B. Farwell, Illinois; Abner Taylor,\r\nIllinois; S. R. Haven, Illinois; J. M. Beardsley, Illinois; John\r\nCoburn, Indiana; Will Cumback, Indiana; C. Irving Ditty, Maryland.\r\n\r\nAt New Orleans I was for the first time introduced to the members\r\nof the returning board, who, under the laws of Louisiana, were\r\nrequired to verify the count and whose return was final.  We met\r\nalso a large number of gentlemen who were there at the request of\r\nthe national Democratic committee to perform the same duty that\r\nhad been imposed upon us by General Grant.  These gentlemen were\r\nJohn M. Palmer, Illinois; Lyman Trumbull, Illinois; William R.\r\nMorrison, Illinois; Samuel J. Randall, Pennsylvania; A. G. Curtin,\r\nPennsylvania; William Bigler, Pennsylvania; J. R. Doolittle,\r\nWisconsin; George R. Smith, Wisconsin; J. E. McDonald, Indiana;\r\nGeorge W. Julian, Indiana; M. D. Manson, Indiana; John Love, Indiana;\r\nHenry Watterson, Kentucky; J. W. Stevenson, Kentucky; Henry D.\r\nMcHenry, Kentucky; Oswald Ottendorfer, New York; J. B. Stallo,\r\nOhio; Lewis V. Bogy, Missouri; James O. Brodhead, Missouri; C.\r\nGibson, Missouri; John Lee Carroll, Maryland; William T. Hamilton,\r\nMaryland; W. G. Sumner, Connecticut; P. H. Watson, Ohio; F. R.\r\nCoudert, New York.\r\n\r\nBefore my arrival a correspondence had occurred between what was\r\ncalled the Democratic visitors and the Republican visitors in regard\r\nto our respective duties.  This correspondence, all of which was\r\nreported to President Grant, resulted in the attendance of a certain\r\nnumber of each of the bodies of visitors at each session of the\r\nreturning board, and thus a constant surveillance of the proceedings\r\nof the board was had.  At the same time we received from the\r\nreturning board the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"State of Louisiana, Office Board of Returning-Officers,}\r\n  \"New Orleans, November 18, 1876.                        }\r\n\"Sir:--At a meeting of the board of returning-officers, held this\r\nday, the following preamble and resolution, introduced by General\r\nThomas C. Anderson, was unanimously adopted, viz:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, This board has learned with satisfaction that distinguished\r\ngentlemen of national reputation from other States, some at the\r\nrequest of the President of the United States, and some at the\r\nrequest of the national executive committee of the Democratic party\r\nare present in this city with a view to witness the proceedings of\r\nthis board in canvassing and compiling the returns of the recent\r\nelection in this state for presidential electors, in order that\r\nthe public opinion of the country may be satisfied as to the truth\r\nof the result and the fairness of the means by which it may have\r\nbeen attained; and whereas, this board recognizes the importance\r\nwhich may attach to the result of their proceedings, and that the\r\npublic mind should be convinced of its justice by a knowledge of\r\nthe facts on which it may be based, therefore, be it\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That this board does hereby cordially invite and request\r\nfive gentlemen from each of the two bodies named, to be selected\r\nby themselves respectively, to attend and be present at the meetings\r\nof the board while engaged in the discharge of its duties, under\r\nthe law, in canvassing and compiling the returns, and ascertaining\r\nand declaring the result of said election for presidential electors,\r\nin their capacity as private citizens of eminent reputation and\r\nhigh character, and as spectators and witnesses of the proceedings\r\nin that behalf of this board.\r\n\r\n  \"J. Madison Wells,\r\n  \"Chairman Board of Returning-Officers.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, St. Charles Hotel, New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day I answered in behalf of my associates as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"St. Charles Hotel,             }\r\n  \"New Orleans, November 18, 1876.}\r\n\"Sir:--I have received your note of to-day, with a copy of the\r\nresolution of the board of returning-officers of the State of\r\nLouisiana, and have communicated the invitation contained in it to\r\nthe gentlemen who are here at the request of the President of the\r\nUnited States to witness the canvassing of the vote at the recent\r\nelection in this state for presidential electors, and am instructed\r\nby them to inform you of their acceptance of the invitation, and\r\nthat they will designate a committee of five of their number to\r\nattend the meetings of the board.  And I take this occasion to\r\nexpress my thanks for the courteous terms of this invitation, my\r\ndeep sense of the importance of your proceedings, and my confident\r\nhope that they will be so conducted as to convince the public mind\r\nof the justice of your finding.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. J. Madison Wells.\"\r\n\r\nA similar invitation was extended to the Democratic visitors, and\r\nsubstantially the same reply made.  The returning board then\r\nproceeded to perform its duty under the law.  At each session the\r\nRepublican and Democratic visitors were present, and I neither know\r\nof nor have ever heard of any act being done or testimony taken by\r\nthe board except in the presence of committees of the two bodies\r\nof visitors.  The proceedings of the returning board were reported\r\nfor each body of visitors and for the returning board, and all the\r\nevidence taken was not only delivered in the presence of the two\r\nvisiting bodies, but was reported to the President and was published\r\nby Congress.  Whatever opinions may be expressed as to the correctness\r\nof the findings of the returning board, there can be no doubt that\r\nits proceedings were open, fair and impartial.  The board arrived\r\nat the conclusion that the Republican electors received a majority\r\nof the votes cast in Louisiana at that election, and were entitled\r\nto cast the vote of the state for President of the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the great excitement over this controversy, and also over\r\nthat in South Carolina and Florida, exaggerated statements, without\r\nthe slightest foundation, of frauds and improper conduct on the\r\npart of the returning officers were made and published.  As to the\r\naction of the returning board of Louisiana, I feel bound now, after\r\na long lapse of time, to repeat what was reported to General Grant\r\nby the Republican visitors, that it made a fair, honest and impartial\r\nreturn of the result of the election.  In concluding our report we\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The proof of violence and intimidation and armed disturbance in\r\nmany other parishes, is of the same general character, although\r\nmore general and decisive, as to the five parishes particularly\r\nreferred to.  In the others, these causes prevailed at particular\r\npolling places, at many of which the Republican vote was, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, prevented.\r\n\r\n\"We hope to be able to furnish full copies of all testimony taken\r\nby the board, that the justice of its conclusions may be appreciated.\r\nIt is a tribunal, from which there can be no appeal, and, in view\r\nof the possible consequences of its adjudication, we have closely\r\nobserved its proceedings and have carefully weighed the force of\r\na large mass of the testimony upon which that adjudication has been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\"The members of the board, acting under oath, were bound by law,\r\nif convinced by the testimony that riot, tumult, acts of violence,\r\nor armed disturbance did materially interfere with the purity and\r\nfreedom of election at any poll or voting place, or did materially\r\nchange the result of the election thereat, to reject the votes thus\r\ncast, and exclude them from their final return.  Of the effect of\r\nsuch testimony, the board was sole and final judge, and if, in\r\nreaching a conclusion, it exercised good faith and was guided by\r\nan honest desire to do justice, its determination should be respected,\r\neven if, upon like proof, a different conclusion might have been\r\nreached by other tribunals or persons.\r\n\r\n\"To guard the purity of the ballot; to protect the citizen in the\r\nfree and peaceful exercise of his right to vote; to secure him\r\nagainst violence, intimidation, outrage, and especially murder,\r\nwhen he attempts to perform his duty, should be the desire of all\r\nmen, and the aim of every representative government.  If political\r\nsuccess shall be attained by such violent and terrible means as\r\nwere resorted to in many parishes in Louisiana, complaint should\r\nnot be made if the votes thus obtained are denounced by judicial\r\ntribunals and all honest men as illegal and void.\"\r\n\r\nPending the action of the board I wrote to Governor Hayes the\r\nfollowing letter, giving a general view of the testimony:\r\n\r\n  \"State of Louisiana, Executive Department,}\r\n  \"New Orleans, November 23, 1876.          }\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I have not written you sooner, for the progress of\r\nour visitation will be known to you through the papers sooner than\r\nfrom my letters, and the telegraph office here is more public than\r\na sheriff's sale.  We sometimes hear of private telegrams before\r\nthey are delivered.  The action of the returning board has thus\r\nfar been open and fair and only confirms the general result known\r\nbefore.  We are now approaching the contested parishes.  To five\r\nof them, viz:  Baton Rouge, East and West Feliciana, Morehouse and\r\nOuachita, the evidence of intimidation is so well made out on paper\r\nthat no man can doubt as to the just exclusion of their vote.  In\r\nthese parishes alone we ought to have a majority of 7,000, but\r\nunder the law the entire return must be excluded of all election\r\ndistricts where intimidation has affected or changed the result.\r\nIf this is done the result will give the Hayes electors majorities\r\naggregating 24,111, and the Tilden electors 22,633, but in almost\r\nevery parish the official return varies somewhat from the stated\r\nmajorities, and thus far slightly reduces the Republican majority.\r\n\r\n\"The vote of each disputed parish has thus far been laid aside,\r\nand among them two parishes where a most foolish blunder, or\r\nsomething worse, was made in omitting from the Republican tickets\r\nthe names of all the electors but the two Senatorial and one district\r\nelector.  The Democrats claim this will lose over 2,000 votes, but\r\nour friends, whose information we have generally found confirmed,\r\nsay it will lose us at most 1,193 votes.  The law seems conclusive\r\nthat the defective ballots cannot be counted for any electors but\r\nthose named on the ticket; though it is conclusively shown that\r\nthe remaining electors were omitted by reason of the mistaken idea\r\nthat the district could only vote for one elector.  The whole\r\ntrouble has grown out of the fact that in these two parishes a\r\ncandidate for district judge was not named on the ticket printed\r\nby the state committee.  We undertook to correct this by printing\r\nnew tickets, which were voted in those parishes.  The result of\r\nthis blunder will leave the poll so close as to render it probable\r\nthat one or more of the Tilden electors would have a majority.\r\n\r\n\"There are other parishes where the organized intimidation was not\r\nso general as in the parishes named, though in single election\r\nprecincts it was effective.  These parishes, where formal protests\r\nhave been filed, are Bienville, Bossier, Caldwell, Franklin, Grant,\r\nIberia, Lincoln, Richland and Sabine.  How far the proof in these\r\nparishes will sustain the protests we cannot judge till the evidence\r\nis heard before the returning board.\r\n\r\n\"We are now collecting the testimony as to the bulldozed parishes.\r\nIt seems more like the history of hell than of civilized and\r\nChristian communities.  The means adopted are almost incredible,\r\nbut were fearfully effective upon an ignorant and superstitious\r\npeople.  That you would have received at a fair election a large\r\nmajority in Louisiana, no honest man can question; that you did\r\nnot receive a majority is equally clear.  But that intimidation of\r\nthe very kind and nature provided against by the Louisiana law did\r\nenter into and control the election, in more election polls than\r\nwould change the result and give you the vote, I believe as firmly\r\nas that I write this.  The difficulty of gathering this testimony\r\nand putting it in the legal form has been very great, but I believe\r\nhas been fully met.\r\n\r\n\"The whole case rests upon the action of the returning board.  I\r\nhave carefully observed them, and have formed a high opinion of\r\nGovernor Wells and Colonel Anderson.  They are firm, judicious,\r\nand, as far as I can judge, thoroughly honest and conscientious.\r\nThey are personally familiar with the nature and degree of intimidation\r\nin Louisiana.  They can see that the intimidation, as organized,\r\nwas with a view of throwing out Republican parishes rather than\r\nendangering Democratic parishes.  Our little party is now dividing\r\nout the disputed parishes, with the view of a careful examination\r\nof every paper and detail.  Many are impatient of the delay, and\r\nsome have gone home.  We will probably be able to keep about ten\r\nhere.  We have incurred some liabilities for reporting, printing,\r\netc., but hope the Republican national committee will make this\r\ngood.  If not, we must provide for it ourselves.  We are in good\r\nhope and spirit.  Not wishing the return in your favor, unless it\r\nis clear that it ought to be so, and not willing to be cheated out\r\nof it, or to be 'bulldozed' or intimidated, the truth is palpable\r\nthat you ought to have the vote of Louisiana, and we believe that\r\nyou will have ti, by an honest and fair return, according to the\r\nletter and spirit of the law of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nTo this General Hayes responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., November 27, 1876.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I am greatly obliged to you for your letter of the\r\n23rd.  You feel, I am sure, as I do about this whole business.  A\r\nfair election would have given us about forty electoral votes at\r\nthe south--at least that many.  But we are not to allow our friends\r\nto defeat one outrage and fraud by another.  There must be nothing\r\ncrooked on our part.  Let Mr. Tilden have the place by violence,\r\nintimidation and fraud, rather than undertake to prevent it by\r\nmeans that will not bear the severest scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate the work doing by the Republicans who have gone south,\r\nand am especially proud of the acknowledged honorable conduct of\r\nthose from Ohio.  The Democrats make a mistake in sending so many\r\nex-Republicans.  New converts are proverbially bitter and unfair\r\ntowards those they have recently left.\r\n\r\n\"I trust you will soon reach the end of the work, and be able to\r\nreturn in health and safety.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\"\r\n\r\nI met Governor Hayes on my return and his conversation was to the\r\nsame effect, that he wished no doubtful votes and would greatly\r\nprefer to have Mr. Tilden serve as President if there was any doubt\r\nabout his (Hayes') election.  The Republican visitors did not return\r\nuntil after the meeting of Congress at its regular session on the\r\n4th of December, 1876.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant, in the beginning of his annual message of that\r\ndate, said:\r\n\r\n\"In submitting my eighth and last message to Congress, it seems\r\nproper that I should refer to, and in some degree recapitulate,\r\nthe events and official acts of the past eight years.\r\n\r\n\"It was my fortune, or misfortune, to be called to the office of\r\nChief Executive without any previous political training.  From the\r\nage of seventeen I had never even witnessed the excitement attending\r\na presidential campaign but twice antecedent to my own candidacy,\r\nand at but one of them was I eligible as a voter.  Under such\r\ncircumstances it is but reasonable to suppose that errors of judgment\r\nmust have occurred.  Even had they not, differences of opinion\r\nbetween the Executive, bound by an oath to the strict performance\r\nof his duties, and writers and debaters must have arisen.  It is\r\nnot necessarily evidence of blunder on the part of the Executive\r\nbecause there are these differences of views.  Mistakes have been\r\nmade, as all can see and I admit, but, it seems to me, oftener in\r\nthe selections made of the assistants appointed to aid in carrying\r\nout the various duties of administering the government, in nearly\r\nevery case selected without a personal acquaintance with the\r\nappointee, but upon recommendations of the representatives chosen\r\ndirectly by the people.  It is impossible, where so many trusts\r\nare to be allotted, that the right parties should be chosen in\r\nevery instance.  History shows that no administration, from the\r\ntime of Washington to the present, has been free from these mistakes.\r\nBut I leave comparison to history, claiming only that I have acted\r\nin every instance from a conscientious desire to do what was right,\r\nconstitutional within the law, and for the very best interests of\r\nthe whole people.  Failures have been errors of judgment, not of\r\nintent.\"\r\n\r\nThis modest statement by General Grant was appreciated by Congress\r\nand by the country.  No one doubted the sincerity and patriotism\r\nof the President.  His modest confession of errors did not in the\r\nslightest degree impair the universal confidence in him.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January, 1877, Mr. Edmunds, of the select committee\r\nof the Senate on the counting of electoral votes, submitted a report\r\nin writing with an accompanying bill.  It was, with one exception,\r\nsigned by the members of the committees of the two Houses without\r\ndistinction of party.  The bill provided in full detail a prescribed\r\nmanner for counting the electoral vote.  It was adopted by both\r\nHouses and voted for by a great majority, but, believing that it\r\nwas extra constitutional, I, with other Republicans, did not vote\r\nfor it.  The history of the electoral commission provided for in\r\nthis bill is part of the history of the country, and it is not\r\nnecessary to here enter into it in detail.  It is sufficient to\r\nsay that it resulted in the counting of the votes of Louisiana,\r\nSouth Carolina and Florida for Mr. Hayes, electing him President\r\nby a majority of one vote.  I took an active part in the debates\r\non the questions involved and gave in detail my view of the action\r\nof the returning board of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I received a number of personal letters from\r\nGovernor Hayes, some of which may be of interest:\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., December 25, 1876.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I have your esteemed favor, and have also met Judge\r\nTaft and Governor Dennison.  There will not be the slightest\r\ndifficulty growing out of the matter you refer to.  You know my\r\ngeneral course of conduct.  It has always seemed to me wisest, in\r\ncase of decided antagonisms among friends, not to take sides--to\r\nheal by compromise, not to aggravate, etc., etc.  I wish _you_ to\r\nfeel authorized to speak in pretty decided terms for me whenever\r\nit seems advisable--to do this not by reason of specific authority\r\nto do it, but from your knowledge of my general methods of action.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., January 5, 1877.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I have your note of the 3rd.  I do not wish to\r\ninfluence the action of our friends, and do not volunteer opinions.\r\nBut _you_ have a right to my opinion.  I believe the Vice President\r\nalone has the constitutional power to count the votes and declare\r\nthe result.  Everything in the nature of a contest as to electoral\r\nvotes is an affair of the states.  The rest is a mere ministerial\r\nduty.  Therefore it is not right, in my judgment, for Congress to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, U. S. S.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., February 15, 1877.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I have two letters from you since I last wrote.  It\r\nif becomes my duty to make a cabinet I want your views fully and\r\nspecifically.  If possible a personal interview would be extremely\r\ndesirable.  Boynton writes to Smith that an assurance of my views\r\non the southern question, which are truly set forth in my letter,\r\nwith such additions as I could properly make, would be useful.  I\r\nprefer to make no new declarations.  But you may say if you deem\r\nit advisable that you _know_ that I will stand by the friendly and\r\nencouraging words of that letter and by all that they imply.  You\r\ncannot express that too strongly.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., February 16, 1877.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--If the issue of the contest is in our favor I shall\r\nwant to see you at once if it is at all practicable.  Don't you\r\nwant to visit Mansfield?  I can meet you there or here--or possibly\r\nat a point east of there.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Columbus, O., February 19, 1877.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--The more I think of it the more difficult it seems\r\nfor me to get ready to come to Washington before Wednesday or\r\nThursday of next week.  I must fix affairs at Fremont, and cannot\r\nbegin it until I know the result.  Why can't friends be sent or\r\ncome here?\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me proper now to say that I am extremely desirous that\r\nyou should take the treasury department.  Aside from my own personal\r\npreference, there are many and controlling reasons why I should\r\nask you to do this.  It will satisfy friends here in Ohio.  I\r\nunderstand Governor Morton and our friends in Washington like it.\r\nThe country will approve it.  You are by all odds the best fitted\r\nfor it of any man in the nation.  Your resignation from the Senate\r\nwill be a great loss to that body, but it will cause no serious\r\ndissensions or difficulty in Ohio.  Do not say no until I have had\r\na full conference with you.  There is no reason why you should not\r\nvisit Ohio as soon as you can be spared from Washington.  Of course\r\nthe public will know of our meeting.  But they will be gratified\r\nto know it.  No possible harm can come of it.  I should have said\r\nall this before, but I did not want to embarrass you in your action\r\non the presidential question.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Telegram.)\r\n  \"Columbus, O., February 20, 1877.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"I will be greatly obliged if you can come to Columbus, but will\r\nmeet you at Zanesville if you think it important.\r\n\r\n  \"R. B.

C.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Governor Hayes will be obliged to you if you will be\r\nkind enough to speak to Mr. Evarts with respect to his acceptance\r\nof the place in the cabinet referred to in the interview with you\r\nlast week.  It was the governor's intention to make this request\r\nat that time, and he may have done so, but not being quite sure of\r\nthe fact, desires me to write you with reference to it.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours very respectfully,\r\n  \"W. K. Rogers, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes frequently, in personal conversation and in writing,\r\nhad expressed a strong desire that I should become the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury.  I was disinclined to accept this position, as I\r\nwas content to serve my constituents in the Senate.  It was not\r\nuntil after his urgent request in his letter of February 19, 1877,\r\nthat I seriously considered his desire that I should accept that\r\noffice.  I went to Columbus to ascertain the views of the legislature,\r\nand whether there would be any difficulty in selecting a Republican\r\nto my place in the Senate.  Having found that there would not be,\r\nI, with reluctance, accepted his offer.  Stanley Matthews was\r\nelected on the 21st of March to serve out my unexpired term, which\r\nended on the 3rd of March, 1879.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes arrived at Washington a few days before the 4th of\r\nMarch and was my guest until he was inaugurated as President.  The\r\n4th day of March was on Sunday, and to avoid any questions about\r\nan interregnum, he was sworn into office on that day, but took the\r\nformal oath on the next day, the 5th of March, and made his inaugural\r\naddress.  He nominated the members of his cabinet to the Senate\r\nand they were promptly confirmed.\r\n\r\nI received many letters of congratulation and encouragement in\r\nassuming the duties of Secretary of the Treasury, two of which I\r\ninsert:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, March 6, 1877.\r\n\"My Dear Mr. Secretary:--Allow me to congratulate you on having\r\nbeen selected by President Hayes to administer the financial affairs\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\n\"I deem it a happy augury that the President's choice of members\r\nof his cabinet has fallen upon men who have made their mark as\r\nstatesmen, and whose advent to power will, I feel convinced,\r\ninaugurate an era of prosperity for our country.\r\n\r\n\"With yourself at the head of the treasury department, there is no\r\nfear of public credit being shaken and commercial interests imperiled\r\nby crude and experimental legislation.\r\n\r\n\"With great respect, I remain, my dear Mr. Sherman,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly your friend,\r\n  \"Cyrus W.

You have certainly succeeded to the\r\nmost difficult post in the government, one in whose successful\r\nadministration Americans abroad feel an especial interest, for no\r\ndepartment is more important to foreigners or more discussed by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be unsatisfactory to you to know that Americans--both\r\nthose long domiciled here and those in transit--applaud the\r\nappointment of the new Chief of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to offer my best wishes and belief that the reputation he\r\nhas already achieved in the Senate will be increased in the cabinet;\r\nand to say how glad I was that the unanimity of his late compeers\r\nshowed that they were of the same mind.\r\n\r\n\"With great respect, I am, my dear sir,\r\n\r\n  \"Very faithfully yours,\r\n  \"Adam Badeau.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nI BEGIN MY DUTIES AS SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\nLegislative Training of Great Advantage to Me in My New Position--\r\nLoan Contract in Force When I Took the Portfolio--Appointment of\r\nCharles F. Conant as Funding Agent of the Treasury Department in\r\nLondon--Redeeming Called Bonds--Sale of Four Per Cent. Bonds Instead\r\nof Four and a Half Per Cents.--Popularity of the New Loan--Great\r\nSaving in Interest--On a Tour of Inspection Along the Northern\r\nAtlantic Coast--Value of Information Received on This Trip--Effect\r\nof the Baltimore and Pittsburg Railroad Strikes in 1877 Upon Our\r\nPublic Credit.\r\n\r\nWhen I assumed the office of Secretary of the Treasury I had the\r\nadvantage of some of my predecessors in that I was acquainted with\r\nthe organization and duties of the treasury department.  Ever since\r\n1859 my connection with the committee of ways and means in the\r\nHouse and with the committee on Finance in the Senate had brought\r\nme into official relations with the head of that department.  This\r\nlegislative training gave me a full knowledge of the several laws\r\nthat were to be executed in relation to public revenue, to all\r\nforms of taxation, to coinage and currency, and to the public debt.\r\nThe entire system of national finance then existing grew out of\r\nthe Civil War, and I had participated in the passage of all the\r\nlaws relating to this subject.  My intimate association with\r\nSecretaries Chase, Fessenden and McCulloch, and my friendly relations\r\nwith Secretaries Boutwell and Richardson, led me, as chairman of\r\nthe Senate committee on finance, to have free and confidential\r\nintercourse with them as to legislation affecting the treasury.\r\nSecretary Bristow had not had the benefit of experience either in\r\nCongress or the department.  He was a good lawyer and an able man.\r\nHe doubted whether resumption would be effective without a gradual\r\nretirement of United States notes, a measure that Congress would\r\nnot agree to.  Congress repealed even the limited retirement of\r\nsuch notes provided for by the resumption act.  Secretary Morrill,\r\nof Maine, my immediate predecessor, was in hearty sympathy with\r\nthe policy of Congress, of which he had been a useful Senator, and\r\nbut for his failing health would have been an efficient secretary.\r\nUpon my assuming the duties of secretary, and for some time before,\r\nhe had been confined by illness to his lodgings in Washington.\r\nThe treasury department was then well organized.  Most of the\r\nprincipal officers had been long in the service.  But few changes\r\nwere made by President Hayes or by myself, and only as vacancies\r\noccurred or as incompetency was demonstrated.  The following loan\r\ncontract was in force at the beginning of my administration of the\r\ntreasury department:\r\n\r\n\"This agreement, entered into this 24th day of August, in the year\r\nof our Lord, 1876, between the Secretary of the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States of America, of the first part, and Messrs.

J. & W.\r\nSeligman & Co., of New York, for themselves and associates, and\r\nMessrs. Drexel, Morgan & Co., on behalf of Messrs. J. S. Morgan &\r\nCo., of London, England, and Messrs.

Kuhn, Loeb & Co., of New York, the Bank of New York National\r\nBanking Association, and Messrs. Morton, Rose & Co., of London,\r\nand themselves, of the second part:\r\n\r\n\"Witnesseth, That the said Messrs. August Belmont & Co. of New\r\nYork, on behalf of Messrs. N. M.

J. & W. Seligman & Co., for themselves and their\r\nassociates, hereby agree to purchase from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury six million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\r\n($6,750,000) of the bonds hereinbefore described; and that Messrs.\r\nDrexel, Morgan & Co., on behalf of Messrs. J. S.

Of the said aggregate amount, not less than ten million\r\ndollars ($10,000,000) are hereby subscribed for, the subscription\r\nto take effect on the 1st day of September, 1876, and the remaining\r\namount, namely, thirty million dollars ($30,000,000), may be divided\r\nat the pleasure of the parties of the second part into several\r\nsuccessive subscriptions of not less than five million dollars\r\n($5,000,000) each, to be made prior to the 4th day of March, 1877.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  The parties of the second part shall have the exclusive\r\nright to subscribe, in the same proportion to each of the subscribers,\r\nfor the remainder, namely, two hundred and sixty million dollars\r\n($260,000,000), or any portion of said loan authorized to be issued\r\nby the acts of Congress aforesaid, by giving notice thereof to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury on or before the 30th day of June, 1877;\r\nbut the party of the first part reserves the right to terminate\r\nthis contract at any time after March 4, 1877, by giving ten days'\r\nnotice thereof to the parties of the second part.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That the Secretary of the Treasury shall, when subscriptions\r\nare made by the said parties of the second part, issue calls with\r\neven date with said subscriptions for the redemption of an equivalent\r\namount of six per cent. 5-20 bonds of the United States, as provided\r\nby said act of July 14, 1870.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  The parties of the second part agree to pay for said four\r\nand a half per cent. bonds par and interest accrued to the date of\r\napplication for delivery of said bonds, in gold coin, matured United\r\nStates gold coin coupons, or any of the six per cent. 5-20 bonds\r\ncalled for redemption, or in United States gold certificates of\r\ndeposit issued under the act of March 3, 1863, with the understanding\r\nthat payment to the extent of the amount of any call shall be made\r\nwithin the time during which such call shall mature:  _Provided_,\r\nThat, if the parties of the second part shall elect so to do, they\r\nmay have the privilege of making any of said subscriptions payable\r\nspecifically in uncalled six per cent 5-20 bonds of the United\r\nStates, in which case the Secretary of the Treasury may, to the\r\nextent of such payments, omit the calls mentioned in condition No. 3.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  The parties of the second part shall receive in coin a\r\ncommission of one-half of one per cent. on all bonds taken by them,\r\nas allowed by the act of July 14, 1870, and shall assume and defray\r\nall expenses which may be incurred in sending bonds to London upon\r\ntheir request, or by transmitting bonds, coupons, or coin from\r\nthere to the treasury department at Washington, including all cost\r\nof making exchange of bonds, and shall also be charged with the\r\npreparation and issuing of the bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth.  No bonds shall be delivered to the parties of the second\r\npart, or either of them, until payment shall have been made in full\r\ntherefor in accordance with the terms of this contract.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh.  During the continuance of this contract any sales of\r\nbonds ordered by the Secretary of the Treasury, by authority of\r\nlaw, except those that it may become necessary to sell to pay\r\njudgments of the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, shall\r\nbe made through the parties of the second part, who shall be allowed\r\nthereon a commission of one per cent. in gold coin.  And it is\r\nprovided that the amount of bonds so ordered shall not exceed in\r\nthe aggregate $25,000,000, unless by mutual agreement of the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n  \"Lot M.

Morgan & Co., of London.\r\n  \"Morton, Bliss & Co., For themselves and associates, as named\r\n    above.\"\r\n\r\nBy its terms the contract provided for the sale of $40,000,000,\r\nfour and a half per cent. bonds of the United States at par in gold\r\ncoin.  The contractors had the exclusive right to subscribe for\r\nall or any portion of the remainder of the four and a half per\r\ncent. bonds, amounting to $260,000,000.  The right to terminate\r\nthis contract at any time after March 4, 1877, after ten days'\r\nnotice, was reserved by the United States.  The proceeds of the\r\nbonds sold were to be applied solely to the payment of the six per\r\ncent. 5-20 bonds of the United States.  No provision was made in\r\nthis contract for the accumulation of coin for the redemption of\r\nUnited States notes.  The process of refunding under it progressed\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nI felt it to be important that I should have some personal\r\nrepresentative in London, to protect the interests of the United\r\nStates in the execution of this contract, and, therefore, on the\r\n31st of March, 1877, I appointed Charles F. Conant, as the funding\r\nagent of the treasury department, and directed him to assume the\r\ngeneral management and supervision of all business in London,\r\narising from the funding of bonds.  A letter of instructions\r\nprescribing his duties was given him.  He was directed to pursue\r\nthe same general plan under which former negotiations had been\r\nconducted, except as modified by these instructions, which were\r\nbased upon the contract before mentioned.  All bonds, money, or\r\ncoupons received by him were to be securely kept in safes, furnished\r\nby the department for that purpose, to be deposited in the vaults\r\nof the Messrs. Rothschild.  Combination locks were provided for\r\neach safe, and no safe could be unlocked except by three persons\r\non distinct combinations, each person using a combination unknown\r\nto the others.  He was to keep me fully advised as to the course\r\nof the market, of the price not only of American securities, but\r\nof foreign securities, and was to receive the new bonds and deliver\r\nthem to the Rothschilds in exchange for the bonds redeemed.  He\r\nproved to be a very competent and faithful agent, and furnished me\r\nimportant financial information, which aided me greatly in refunding\r\noperations.  His compensation and allowances, as well as those of\r\nall persons sent to London in connection with the refunding of the\r\npublic debt, were paid by the syndicate, so that no expense whatever\r\nwas incurred by the treasury on this account.\r\n\r\nI gave the following notice to the parties to this contract that\r\nI would, on the part of the United States, terminate it.\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,             }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., April 6, 1877.}\r\n\"Gentlemen:--I received your friendly cable message of the 10th\r\nultimo, and return my thanks and hearty good wishes.\r\n\r\n\"I am very solicitous to promote the funding of our six per cent.\r\nbonds as rapidly as practicable, and feel indebted to you for the\r\naid you have given in placing the four and a half per cent. bonds.\r\n\r\n\"I propose no change at present; but it is my desire, if practicable,\r\nto withdraw the four and a half per cent. bonds from the market\r\nand substitute in their place the four per cent. bonds authorized\r\nby the funding act.\r\n\r\n\"These bonds, as you know, are a very desirable investment, running\r\nthirty years from the date of issue, with every guard and security\r\nthat has been given to any bond of the United States, and we think\r\nas safe and desirable as the securities of any other nation.  It\r\nis probably the bond into which all the debt of the United States\r\nwill in time be converted.  I hope you and your associates will be\r\nable to engage with me to place this bond on the market when\r\n$200,000,000 of the four and a half per cent. bonds have been sold.\r\n\r\n\"The public policy of the United States to resume specie payments\r\non or before the 1st of January, 1879, is fully established by the\r\nlaw and by public opinion.  It may be that the surplus revenue will\r\nbe sufficient to enable me to carry out this policy without the\r\nsale of bonds.  I am authorized by the resumption act to sell five,\r\nfour and a half, or four per cent. bonds to prepare for resumption,\r\nand it may be desirable to sell through the syndicate, under that\r\nact, a limited amount of bonds, not exceeding, I hope, $30,000,000\r\na year.  I do not wish in the execution of this duty to disturb\r\nthe exchanges between Europe and this country.  For this purpose\r\nI desire to sell only the four per cent. bonds and must sell at\r\npar in coin, but could receive in payment coin coupons maturing\r\nwithin a limited time.  I invite from you and your associates such\r\nsuggestions and offers as you may think proper to make for the\r\npurchase of such bonds.\r\n\r\n\"The operations of the syndicate have become so important that I\r\nhave deemed it proper to ask Mr. Charles F. Conant, late Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to take charge of the business in London\r\nin connection with the gentlemen already there.  He is well informed\r\nas to our laws, and I trust his services may be of advantage to\r\nthe government and agreeable to you.\r\n\r\n\"I will give my personal attention to this business, and will\r\nreceive with pleasure any suggestions from you that will promote\r\nour common object.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\r\n\"Messrs.

I remain, dear Mr.\r\nsecretary, yours, very faithfully.\r\n\r\n  \"Jos.

On Friday last I concluded a modification\r\nof the present syndicate contract, which provides for the sale of\r\nfive million four and a half per cent. bonds at par in coin for\r\nresumption purposes.  A further negotiation is pending as to the\r\nrenewal and modification of the contract, of which I will give you\r\ndue notice when completed.  In the meantime I wish to keep steadily\r\nin view the sale of the balance of two hundred million four and a\r\nhalf per cent. bonds, and, if possible, I wish to make the necessary\r\ncalls during this month and next.\r\n\r\n\"You can assure Messrs.

Their efforts in maintaining\r\nthe credit of the bonds and securing this result will be highly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to have you write me at least twice a week as fully\r\nas practicable.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Mr. C. F. Conant, London.\"\r\n\r\nAs the process of redeeming called bonds required a notice of ninety\r\ndays, I postponed the termination of the existing contract until\r\nafter that period.  My purpose in terminating the contract was to\r\nsubstitute for sale the four per cent. bonds of the United States\r\ninstead of the four and a half per cent. bonds.  I believed that\r\nthe advancing credit of the United States would justify this\r\nreduction of the rate of interest.  Another reason for this step\r\nwas that, in addition to refunding at a lower rate of interest, I\r\nwished to commence preparation for the resumption of specie payments\r\non January 1, 1879, according to law.  This could only be done by\r\nthe sale of bonds for gold coin.  I reserved the remainder of the\r\nfour and a half bonds, amounting to $100,000,000, authorized by\r\nthe refunding act, for resumption purposes in case the four per\r\ncent. bonds could not be sold at par in coin.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for a change in the existing contract was that it\r\ngave to the syndicate a monopoly in the sale of bonds while I wished\r\nto sell the bonds directly to the people.  The new contract was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"This agreement, entered into this 9th day of June, 1877, between\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, of the first\r\npart, and Messrs. August Belmont & Co., of New York, on behalf of\r\nMessrs. N. M. Rothschild & Sons, of London, England, and associates\r\nand themselves; Messrs. Drexel, Morgan & Co., of New York, on behalf\r\nof Messrs. J. S. Morgan & Co., of London, and themselves; Messrs.\r\nJ. & W. Seligman & Co., of New York, on behalf of Messrs. Seligman\r\nBrothers, of London, and themselves; Messrs. Morton, Bliss & Co.,\r\nof New York, on behalf of Messrs. Morton, Rose & Co., of London,\r\nand themselves; and the First National Bank of the city of New York--\r\n\r\n\"Witnesseth:  That the said Messrs. August Belmont & Co., on behalf\r\nof Messrs. N. M. Rothschild & Sons, and associates and themselves,\r\nhereby agree to purchase from the Secretary of the Treasury\r\n$10,312,500 of the bonds known as the four per cent. consols of\r\nthe United States, issued under the acts of July 14, 1870, January\r\n20, 1871, and January 14, 1875, and that Messrs. Drexel, Morgan &\r\nCo., on behalf of Messrs. J. S. Morgan & Co., and themselves, agree\r\nto purchase $4,062,500 of said bonds, and that Messrs. J. & W.\r\nSeligman & Co., on behalf of Messrs. Seligman Brothers, and\r\nthemselves, agree to purchase $4,062,500 of said bonds, and that\r\nthe First National Bank of the city of New York agree to purchase\r\n$2,500,000 of said bonds, making a total aggregate of $25,000,000\r\nof said bonds, on the terms and conditions following:\r\n\r\n\"First.  Of the said aggregate amount not more than $5,000,000\r\nshall be sold for resumption purposes, the remaining $20,000,000\r\nto be sold for funding purposes, and subscribed for by the parties\r\nof the second part during the months of July and August, 1877.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  The parties of the second part shall have the exclusive\r\nright to subscribe in the same proportion to each of the subscribers,\r\nfor the remainder of the four per cent. consols of the United\r\nStates, or any portion of said consols authorized to be issued by\r\nthe acts of Congress aforesaid, by giving notice thereof to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury on or before the 30th day of June, 1878;\r\nbut the party of the first part reserves the right to terminate\r\nthis contract at any time after the 31st day of December, 1877, by\r\ngiving ten days' notice thereof to the parties of the second part.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That the Secretary of the Treasury shall not sell for\r\nresumption purposes exceeding five millions per month during the\r\ncontinuance of this contract, except by mutual agreement of the\r\nparties hereto.  When subscriptions are made for other than resumption\r\npurposes by the parties of the second part, the party of the first\r\npart shall issue calls of even date with said subscriptions for\r\nthe redemption of an equal amount of six per cent. 5-20 bonds of\r\nthe United States, as provided for in said act of July 13, 1870.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  The parties of the second part agree to pay for said four\r\nper cent. bonds par and interest accrued to the date of application\r\nfor delivery of said bonds in gold coin, matured United States gold\r\ncoin coupons, or any of the six per cent. 5-20 bonds called for\r\nredemption, or in United States gold certificates of deposit issued\r\nunder the act of March 3, 1863, with the understanding that payment\r\nto the extent of the amount of any call shall be made within the\r\ntime during which call shall mature:  _Provided_, That if the\r\nparties of the second part shall elect so to do, they may have the\r\nprivilege of making any of said subscriptions payable specifically\r\nin uncalled six per cent. 5-20 bonds of the United States, in which\r\ncase the Secretary of the Treasury may, to the extent of such\r\npayments, omit the calls mentioned in condition No. 3.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  The parties of the second part shall receive in coin a\r\ncommission of one-half of one per cent. on all bonds taken by them,\r\nas allowed by the act of July 14, 1870, and shall assume and defray\r\nall expenses which may be incurred in sending bonds to London or\r\nelsewhere upon their request, or by transmitting bonds, coupons,\r\nor coin to the treasury department at Washington, including all\r\ncost of making the exchange of bonds, and shall also be charged\r\nwith the cost of the preparation and issuing of the bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth.  No bonds shall be delivered to the parties of the second\r\npart, or either of them, until payment shall have been made in full\r\ntherefor in accordance with the terms of this contract.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh.  During the continuance of this contract any sales of\r\nbonds ordered by the Secretary of the Treasury, by authority of\r\nlaw, shall be made through the parties of the second part, who\r\nshall be allowed thereon a commission similar in amount and subject\r\nto the same deductions as prescribed in the fifth clause of this\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n\"Eighth.  It is also agreed that the parties of the second part\r\nshall offer to the people of the United States, at par and accrued\r\ninterest in coin, the four per cent. registered consols and four\r\nper cent. coupon consols of the denominations of fifty dollars and\r\none hundred dollars, embraced in this contract, for a period of\r\nthirty days from the public notice of such subscriptions, and in\r\nsuch cities and upon such notice as the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nmay prescribe prior to the opening of the lists, and further, to\r\noffer to the subscribers the option of paying in installments,\r\nextending through three months.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n  \"August Belmont & Co., On behalf of N.

The eighth section was a new provision,\r\nand required the syndicate to offer to the people of the United\r\nStates, at par and accrued interest in coin, the four per cent.\r\nbonds, for a period of thirty days, in such cities and upon such\r\nnotice as the Secretary of the Treasury might prescribe.\r\n\r\nThe result of this contract was not only to save one-half of one\r\nper cent. on the annual interest of the bonds redeemed, but to so\r\npopularize the loan that within a brief period I was able to\r\nterminate the contract according to its terms, and to sell the four\r\nper cent. bonds directly to the people at par, without a commission,\r\nor the aid of a syndicate.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Mr. Conant as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,     }\r\n  \"Washington, May 31, 1877.}\r\n\"Dear Mr. Conant:--Your letter of the 19th is received.  Since its\r\ndate matters here have changed greatly for the better, and I have\r\nmade two calls for ten millions each.\r\n\r\n\"There is a strong, steady demand for our bonds, and I have now no\r\nfear but the two hundred millions four and a halfs will be exhausted\r\nbefore the 1st of July, when they will be withdrawn.  The prospect\r\nof placing the four per cent. bonds, commencing July 1, is very\r\ngood.  I have submitted to the syndicate a proposition in substance\r\nrequiring them to take twenty-five millions four per cents., during\r\nJuly and August, of which five millions will be for resumption\r\npurposes, with a stipulation that if they take fifty millions\r\nadditional in September and October the contract will be extended\r\nto January 1, 1878, five millions a month to be applied for resumption\r\npurposes.  I do not propose to vary essentially from the proposition.\r\nI have another offer almost as good from other parties, but I hope\r\nto combine these two offers into a modified syndicate, and, if\r\npossible, reserve the right to sell bonds at par, in coin or 5-20\r\nbonds, to persons who apply directly to me for exchange, giving,\r\nhowever, the syndicate the half per cent. commission.  We will\r\nconsiderably reduce the cost of the bonds, I think, to one-tenth\r\nof one per cent., so that the contracting parties will have a\r\nreasonably fair commission.  I am already assured of many sales of\r\nthe bonds whenever offered, without the aid of the syndicate, so\r\nthat I consider myself strong enough to undertake the placing the\r\nbonds even without their aid, if they will not agree to reasonable\r\nterms.  If I can secure the active, hearty co-operation of all the\r\nparties who wish to engage in selling the bonds, and they will be\r\ncontent with a reasonable profit, the operation of funding can go\r\non so rapidly that they ought to be satisfied with the profit they\r\nwill make.\r\n\r\n\"I have not overlooked the possibility that some movement of coin\r\nwill be made to meet called bonds in Europe in excess of bonds sold\r\nthere, but hope to perfect arrangements by which I will secure\r\nAmerican bullion to meet this demand, without stopping accumulations\r\nof coin in the treasury.\r\n\r\n\"The prospects here are favorable for a good crop in all the states\r\nof the Mississippi valley, but there will probably be a bad crop\r\nin California.\r\n\r\n\"What we must do is push the loan so that it will be an established\r\nsuccess before the meeting of Congress.  If you can succeed in\r\ninspiring the Rothschilds to aid this purpose I am sure of success.\r\nMy proposition has been sent to them, and I was advised would be\r\nanswered by telegram about this time; but by the 15th I hope to\r\nhave the arrangements completed.\r\n\r\n\"If upon receipt of this letter there is anything of striking\r\ninterest affecting the loan you may cable me.\r\n\r\n\"All well in the department.

Henry F.\r\nFrench, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, in a published letter\r\nof the date of June 11, asserted his opinion that the bonds issued\r\nunder the act of July 14, 1870, for refunding, were redeemable in\r\ncoin of the standard value at that date, and that \"as it cannot be\r\nknown what bonds have been transferred since the act of 1873, all\r\nbonds under the act of 1870 must be paid in gold coin of the standard\r\nvalue named in the act of 1873.\"\r\n\r\nI received a letter from Messrs. Seligman & Co., inclosing an\r\nextract from the New York \"Times,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, June 12, 1877.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury, Washington.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. Secretary:--We beg to inclose a short editorial article\r\nwhich appeared in to-day's New York 'Times,' which, coming from a\r\nRepublican paper, may frighten investors in our country and abroad.\r\nIntelligent people know that you, sir, as well as President Hayes,\r\nare sound on the silver question, and yet it may appear to you\r\nproper, and highly advantageous to the prompt marketing of the four\r\nper cent. bonds, to disabuse those who have been led to believe\r\nthat the President and you favor the remonetizing of silver, with\r\na view of paying our national debt in a metal so fluctuating as\r\nsilver has become since the principal nations of Europe have\r\ndemonetized it.

There is no doubt that the bond has many advantages\r\nboth for home and foreign investors.  It has only one point of\r\nweakness, and that is, if the silver ring should succeed in getting\r\nan unlimited issue of legal tender silver dollars, this bond would\r\nbe payable, principal and interest, in that coin.  Shrewd men, who\r\nknow what silver has done and is liable to do in the way of ups\r\nand downs, will take this fact into consideration, and the government\r\nwill ultimately be compelled to do the same.  At present the strength\r\nof the silver movement is estimated to be small, but if this estimate\r\nshould prove to be mistaken, the new four per cents. would suffer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. August Belmont wrote me a letter upon this subject of the date\r\nof June 14th, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to add a few words to the letter of my house of this\r\nday, in order to urge upon you the _vital_ importance of an official\r\nexpression of yours _over you own signature_, in the sense of the\r\nletter of Assistant Secretary French, published in this morning's\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"You are placed at this moment, by a large portion of your political\r\nfriends, in a somewhat similar position as the late Mr. Chase was\r\nby the attempt of Thad. Stevens to have Congress pass a law to\r\ndeclare the principal of the 5-20 bonds payable in currency.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chase took the bull by the horns by declaring, over his own\r\nsignature, that the principal as well as the interest of the 5-20\r\nbonds were payable in gold, the faith of the United States being\r\npledged to this by the tacit understanding of the government and\r\nits creditors.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has reflected more credit and renown upon that great\r\nstatesman--then as prominent and favored a son of the noble State\r\nof Ohio as you are to-day--and nothing more effectually paved the\r\nway to the great work of reducing the burden of our people by\r\nlowering our interest one-third than that expression, sanctioned\r\nand confirmed by subsequent enactment of Congress in 1869.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"You will, in my opinion, insure the success of your financial\r\nmeasures, and add greatly to your high and prominent political\r\nposition, if you will unequivocally declare that the funded debt\r\nof the government can only be redeemed, principal and interest, in\r\ngold coin, and that until otherwise agreed upon by the mutual\r\nconsent of the great commercial nations of the United States,\r\nEngland, France, and Germany, the silver dollar can only be accepted\r\nas an auxiliary standard for the payment of fractional indebtedness.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,      }\r\n  \"Washington, June 16, 1877.}\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your private note, the letter of your firm, and one\r\nfrom Messrs. Seligman & Co., asking me to make a public statement\r\nover my own signature, similar to that of Mr. French, are received.\r\nI have given to this important suggestion the most serious\r\nconsideration, and have come to the firm conclusion that such an\r\nact on my part would be inexpedient, and defeat the very object\r\nyou have in view.  As a purely executive officer, I have no power\r\nto pass upon the question mooted.  My attempt to do so would at\r\nonce unite all those who are seized with this mania, and those who\r\noppose executive encroachment upon legislative power.  It would\r\ncreate excitement, personal and political animosities would mingle\r\nwith it, and it would tend more than anything else to defeat the\r\nsuccess of the law.  I am quite sure this would be the result.\r\n\r\n\"As to whether Congress or the people would ever undertake to pay\r\neither principal or interest of the bonded debt, and especially\r\nthe bonds sold since 1873, in silver, I have a firm conviction that\r\nthe question will never seriously be raised.  These bonds will be\r\npaid, principal and interest, in gold coin.  The people of the\r\nUnited States have always been extremely sensitive as to the public\r\ncredit.  They never have, for the sake of an apparent profit,\r\nyielded any question involving the public honor.\r\n\r\n\"The great satisfaction that will arise from the funding of the\r\nloan at a low rate of interest, together with their strong sense\r\nof public honor and public faith, will always secure the payment\r\nof these bonds, principal and interest, in coin.\r\n\r\n\"Parties or factions may, for a time, raise and contest questions,\r\nbut they are but bubbles, and will pass away, and, like all other\r\nquestions involving the public credit, will be rightfully settled,\r\nin due time, by Congress and the people.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing would so tend to disturb this result as unauthorized\r\n'theses,' or dogmas, by an executive officer, upon a question purely\r\nlegislative or judicial.  Indeed, it may be that too much has\r\nalready been said about this matter by both the President and\r\nmyself, and I assure you that you will have no occasion to be\r\ndisturbed by anything truthfully reported of either of us hereafter.\r\nThe better way is to move right along, making your own statements,\r\nand if, at any time, I see a proper occasion for a strong expression\r\nof my opinion, I will give it.\r\n\r\n\"Please show this to Mr. Seligman, and such of your associates as\r\nyou deem proper, as an answer to all.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon.

The\r\nsubject, from its great importance, has demanded and received\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Under laws now in force, there is no coin issued or issuable in\r\nwhich the principal of the four per cent. bonds is redeemable, or\r\nthe interest payable, except the gold coins of the United States\r\nof the standard value fixed by laws in force on the 14th of July,\r\n1870, when the bonds were authorized.\r\n\r\n\"The government exacts, in exchange for these bonds, payment at\r\npar in such gold coin, and it is not to be anticipated that any\r\nfuture legislation of Congress, or any action of any department of\r\nthe government, would sanction or tolerate the redemption of the\r\nprincipal of these bonds, or the payment of the interest thereon,\r\nin coin, of less value than the coin authorized by law at the time\r\nof the issue of the bonds, being the coin exacted by the government\r\nin exchange for the same.\r\n\r\n\"The essential element of _good faith_, in preserving the equality\r\nin value between the coinage in which the government receives and\r\nthat in which it pays these bonds, will be sacredly observed by\r\nthe government and the people of the United States, whatever may\r\nbe the system of coinage which the general policy of the nation\r\nmay at any time adopt.\r\n\r\n\"This principle is impressed upon the text of the law of July 14,\r\n1870, under which the four per cent. bonds are issued, and requires,\r\nin the opinion of the executive department of the government, the\r\nredemption of these bonds and the payment of their interest in coin\r\nof equal value with that which the government receives from its\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\r\n\"Francis O. French, Esq., 94 Broadway, New York.\"\r\n\r\nThe subscriptions were taken in every part of the United States,\r\nand within thirty days $67,600,000 were taken in this country and\r\n$10,200,000 in Europe, making $77,800,000 sold.  This sum, when\r\napplied to the payment of the six per cent. bonds, made an annual\r\nsaving to the people of the United States of $1,556,000.  Since\r\nthe 1st of March, 1877, there had been sold under the refunding\r\nact $135,000,000 four and a half per cent. bonds and that amount\r\nof six per cent. bonds was paid off and canceled, thus saving to\r\nthe people of the United States $2,025,000 in coin each year.  The\r\naggregate reduction of interest by both classes of bonds from the\r\n1st of March to the close of the popular loan, was $3,581,000 a\r\nyear in coin.  This was regarded as a great success.\r\n\r\nEarly in July I set out on the revenue cutter \"U. S. Grant\" on a\r\nvisit of inspection along the north Atlantic coast, accompanied by\r\nthe chief of the coast survey, the secretary of the lighthouse\r\nboard, the superintendent of the life-saving service, and the chief\r\nof the revenue marine service, and also by Webb Hayes, the son of\r\nthe President.  We visited the life-saving stations along the New\r\nJersey coast.  I was deeply interested in this service, which I\r\nregard as the most deserving humanitarian branch of the public\r\nservice.  We also visited some of the leading lighthouses along\r\nthe coast and the principal customhouses between the Chesapeake\r\nBay and Eastport, Maine.  We were everywhere received with great\r\nkindness and many social courtesies were extended to us, especially\r\nin New York, Boston and Portland.  This outing was a great relief\r\nfrom the close confinement I had undergone since the 4th of March.\r\nThe information I gathered as to these branches of the service,\r\nwith which I had not previously had much acquaintance, was of great\r\nvalue to me.  Such trips are sometimes treated by the press as\r\n\"junketing\" at the public expense.  This is a great error.  Each\r\nof us paid his share of the expenses and the vessel only pursued\r\nits usual course of duty.  I was brought into close association\r\nwith these subordinate officers of the department and became informed\r\nof their duties, and their fitness for them, and was enabled to\r\nact with intelligence on their recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe only unpleasant incident that occurred on the trip was the\r\nrunning of the cutter upon a rock upon the coast of Maine.  This\r\nhappened in the afternoon of a beautiful day.  All the gentlemen\r\nwith me and the officers of the vessel were on deck.  The various\r\nbuoys were being pointed out and a map of the channel was lying\r\nbefore us.  Some mention was made of a buoy that ought to be near\r\nthe place where we were to mark the location of a rock, but none\r\nwas found, and suddenly we heard the scraping of the vessel upon\r\nthe rock.  The cutter trembled and careened over.  The captain was\r\nsomewhat alarmed and turned the vessel toward the beach, where it\r\nwas speedily examined and found to be somewhat injured.  We\r\nascertained afterwards that the buoy had been displaced by a storm\r\nand that a vessel was then on its way to replace it.  The sinking\r\nof the revenue cutter \"U. S. Grant\" was reported in the morning\r\ndispatches and created some excitement; but the vessel did not\r\nsustain any substantial injury.  We thought it best to leave it\r\nfor a time to be thoroughly examined and repaired and took another\r\nvessel to complete our journey to Eastport, the northeastern port\r\nof the United States.  From thence Webb Hayes and myself returned\r\nto Portland and crossed over the Burlington, Vermont, on Lake\r\nChamplain, and from thence went to Saratoga, where we remained a\r\nfew days, and then returned to Washington on the 22nd of July.  We\r\npassed through Baltimore on the day the riots occurred in that\r\ncity, and soon after heard of the much more dangerous outbreak in\r\nPittsburg.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August I wrote to Mr. Conant as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your letter of the 26th ultimo is received.  You can safely say\r\nto the Messrs. Rothschild that the strikes have been totally\r\ndisconnected with the government, but grow purely out of a contract\r\nbetween the managers of the leading lines of railway and their\r\nemployees as to rates of pay.\r\n\r\n\"The railroad companies have, for several years, competed with each\r\nother in a very improvident and reckless way, and are now, and have\r\nbeen for some time, carrying freight for less than cost.  This has\r\ncaused a large reduction of the net income of roads, has led to\r\nthe loss of dividends, and now to the reduction of wages of employees\r\nto rates scarcely sufficient to support life.  Hence the strikes.\r\n\r\n\"The government has been appealed to by both railroads and strikers,\r\nby states and by cities, for relief, and has promptly extended it\r\nin every proper case, and, without shedding blood, has, in every\r\ncase, suppressed the riot, and maintained the peace, so that the\r\ngovernment is really stronger by reason of these unfortunate events\r\nthan before.  I do not observe that any change has been made by\r\nthem, either in the price of bonds or in the price of gold, nor in\r\nthe payment of subscriptions to four per cent. bonds.\r\n\r\n\"No effort is made to sell the bonds now, nor do I care to press\r\nthe home market, until enough bonds are sold abroad to provide for\r\ncalled bonds abroad.\r\n\r\n\"The month of August must necessarily be a languid one, and I do\r\nnot advise any unusual efforts to force sales.\r\n\r\n\"Your supplemental cipher was received after your telegram, but\r\nwas soon found and dispatch made out.\"\r\n\r\nI no doubt was mistaken in the effect of the strikes upon our public\r\ncredit.  From that time forward for many months there was scarcely\r\nany sale of government bonds at any price.  The contracting parties\r\ninformed me that no bonds were then selling in the market and that\r\nin New York they were a trifle below par.  Practically, for the\r\nremainder of the year, government securities were greatly affected\r\nin price and value.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nPOLICY OF THE HAYES ADMINISTRATION.\r\nReception at my Home in Mansfield--Given by Friends Irrespective\r\nof Party--Introduced by My Old Friend and Partner, Henry C. Hedges\r\n--I Reply by Giving a Résumé of the Contests in South Carolina and\r\nLouisiana to Decide Who Was Governor--Positions Taken by Presidents\r\nGrant and Hayes in These Contests--My Plans to Secure the Resumption\r\nof Specie Payments--Effects of a Depreciated Currency--Duties of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury--Two Modes of Resuming--My Mansfield\r\nSpeech Printed Throughout the Country and in England--Letters to\r\nStanley Matthews and General Robinson--Our Defeat in Ohio--An Extra\r\nSession of Congress--Bills Introduced to Repeal the Act Providing\r\nfor the Resumption of Specie Payments--They All Fail of Passage--\r\nPopular Subscription of Bonds All Paid For.\r\n\r\nAbout the 10th of August I made my usual visit to my home at\r\nMansfield.  Soon after my arrival I received the following invitation,\r\nsigned by a great number of my neighbors and friends, without\r\nrespect to party, expressing a desire to tender me a reception:\r\n\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--The undersigned, your townsmen, and fellow-citizens of\r\nRichland county, desire to give you some manifestation of the very\r\nhigh regard in which we hold your public services.  We are glad to\r\nknow that you are permitted to again be at your own home, and for\r\na week or two mingle with us in all the unrestrained freedom of\r\nfriends and townsmen.\r\n\r\n\"Financial and other public questions are, however, of importance\r\nto us always, and especially now.  We recognize your great ability\r\nand long experience, and cannot but think that an expression of\r\nyour views on these questions will be very highly prized by the\r\npeople of Ohio, irrespective of party.  We therefore desire, with\r\nyour sanction, on some day during the next week, to give you a\r\nhearty welcome to your old home, and shall be glad to have you, on\r\nthe occasion, give your views on the public questions, now of such\r\nvast importance to all.  With our kindest regards, we are,\r\n\r\n  \"Your friends, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nI replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, O., August 13, 1877.\r\n\"Gentlemen:--I received with much pleasure your kindly letter of\r\nthe 10th inst., signed by so many of my old friends and neighbors\r\nof Mansfield, and assure you of my high appreciation of your generous\r\nwords of courtesy and regard.\r\n\r\n\"I always return with satisfaction to my home on the western slope\r\nof our little city, and always enjoy the fresh air and picturesque\r\ncountry around us, but, more than all, the cordial greetings of\r\nold friends, with whom I have been acquainted since boyhood.  It\r\nwill give me much pleasure, at any time or place, to meet you, and\r\nto speak to you on current public questions, and I venture to name\r\nnext Friday evening.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe gathering was one of the largest that had come together in\r\nMansfield for years.  The evening was delightful, cool and balmy,\r\na bright moonlight adding attraction to the scene.  A stand decorated\r\nwith flags had been erected near the center of the park, with seats\r\nin front, and lights gleamed on either hand.  I was introduced to\r\nthe audience by my old friend and partner, Henry C. Hedges, whose\r\nremarks were too flattering for me to insert.  In closing he said:\r\n\r\n\"Regarding you as our friend, our neighbor, our townsman, we are\r\nglad and rejoice.  We welcome you home, though your stay may be\r\nonly a few days, and we sincerely trust that, rested by your stay,\r\nyou may go back to your work reinvigorated, and that frequently we\r\nmay have the pleasure of your temporary visits, and in the future,\r\nwhen your labors are finished, among us you may spend your old age,\r\nhonored and happy.\"\r\n\r\nAs my speech expressed my views upon important questions of that\r\ntime, I think it well to embody extracts from it as part of the\r\nhistory of the then recent events, and my anticipations for the\r\nfuture:\r\n\r\n\"The kindly words of welcome uttered by my friend and associate of\r\nmany years move me beyond expression.  They recall to me the scene\r\nof the early time when I came to Mansfield, then a scattered hamlet\r\nof about 1,100 inhabitants, without pavements and without any of\r\nthe modern conveniences of cities and towns.  As Mr. Hedges has\r\ntold you, very many of those I then met here are dead and gone.\r\nI was a boy then.  A generation has passed away, and the sons of\r\nthose I met then as citizens of Richland county now fill places of\r\ntrust and responsibility.  I have every reason in the world for\r\nbeing strongly attached to this town of Mansfield.  You have always\r\nbeen kind to me.  Here I studied law, here I practiced my profession\r\nfor several years, here I married my wife, a native of your town,\r\nhere I have lived ever since, and when this mortal coil shall be\r\nshuffled off, here, probably, will my body rest with your fathers.\r\nBut pardon me, fellow-citizens, if, under the kinds words of welcome\r\nof your spokesman, my old and honored friends, Mr. Hedges, I had\r\nforgotten that we are not here merely to exchange courtesies, but\r\nto discuss grave matters of far more importance than the life or\r\nmemories of an individual.\r\n\r\n\"In doing so I wish it distinctly understood that I speak for myself\r\nalone, as a citizen of Ohio, to you my fellow-citizens and my\r\nneighbors, to whom I am under the highest obligations of gratitude\r\nand duty.\r\n\r\n\"The President authorized me to say one thing, and one thing only,\r\nfor him, and in his name, and that is that all reports that impute\r\nto him any participation whatever in the nomination of candidates\r\non your state ticket, or any desire or purpose to influence in any\r\nway the senatorial contest in Ohio, are utterly groundless.\r\n\r\n\"These are your matters, and I can assure you for him, that he does\r\nnot and will not, interpose in any such contest between political\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"You all know that I am now, and have been, warmly attached to the\r\nRepublican party.  I believe in its principles and honor its work.\r\nWith my strong convictions I could not conceal my partisan bias,\r\nor my earnest hope for the success of the Republican party, but\r\nthe subjects of which I intend to speak to you to-night will not\r\nlead me to say much of former political struggles, or to fight our\r\nold battles over again, but chiefly to discuss the actual administrative\r\nquestions of the day as they have arisen since the 4th of March\r\nlast, and in all of which you are alike interested, whether you\r\nmay call yourselves Republicans or Democrats.  As to those questions\r\nI wish fairly to appeal to the candor and good judgment of honest\r\nmen of both parties, only asking for the administration of President\r\nHayes that considerate charity of judgment which must be extended\r\nto all human agents.\r\n\r\n\"When Mr. Hayes was inaugurated as President he found thirty-six\r\nstates in the full and uncontested exercise of all the powers of\r\nstates in the Union.  In two states only there were contests as to\r\nwho was governor.  Both contests had existed from January to March,\r\n1877, while General Grant was President.\r\n\r\n\"In South Carolina Governor Chamberlain claimed to have been elected\r\non the Republican ticket, and General Hampton on the Democratic\r\nticket.  The President is not made the judge of who is elected\r\ngovernor of a state, and an attempt to exercise such a power would\r\nbe a plain act of usurpation.  The constitution of South Carolina\r\nis much like that of Ohio.  The count of the vote was to be made\r\nby the general assembly of the state.  Unfortunately for Chamberlain\r\na controlling question in the contest had been decided against him\r\nby a Republican court, and he was only kept in possession of the\r\nstate house by the actual presence of United States troops in the\r\nbuilding.  He had appealed again and again to President Grant to\r\nrecognize him as governor and give him the aid of Federal troops\r\nin the enforcement of his claim, which General Grant had refused,\r\nseeking only to preserve the public peace.\r\n\r\n\"When President Hayes was inaugurated both contestants were called\r\nto Washington and both were patiently heard and the questions\r\npresented were patiently and carefully examined.  The President\r\nheld that a case was not presented in which, under the constitution\r\nand the laws, he was justified in using the army of the United\r\nStates in deciding a purely local election contest.  The soldiers\r\nand bayonets of the United States were then withdrawn from the\r\nstate house--not from the state, nor the capital of the state--but\r\nfrom the building in which the legislature, that alone could lawfully\r\ndecide this contest, must meet.  This was all that was done by the\r\nPresident, and Governor Chamberlain, without further contesting\r\nhis claim, abandoned it and left the state.\r\n\r\n\"I say to you now that, strongly as I desired the success of Governor\r\nChamberlain and the Republican party in South Carolina, the President\r\nhad not a shadow of right to interpose the power of the army in\r\nthis contest, and his attempt to do so would have been rash and\r\nabortive as well as without legal right.\r\n\r\n\"The case of Louisiana was far more difficult.  The local returning\r\nofficers of that state had, after a full examination, certified to\r\nthe election of the legislature, showing a Republican majority in\r\nboth houses.  This had been done by excluding from their return\r\nthe votes of certain parishes and counties wherein intimidation,\r\nviolence and fraud had prevailed to an extent sufficient to change\r\nthe result of the election.  I was present, at the request of\r\nGeneral Grant, to witness the count, and I assure you, as I have\r\nsaid officially, that the proof of this intimidation, violence and\r\nfraud, extending to murder, cruelty, and outrage in every form,\r\nwas absolutely conclusive, showing a degree of violence in some of\r\nthose parishes that was more revolting and barbarous than anything\r\nI could conceive of.  It was plain that the returning officers had\r\nthe legal right to pass upon and certify, in the first instance,\r\nwho were elected members of the legislature, and that they were\r\njustified by the evidence in excluding bulldozed parishes, but it\r\nwas equally clear that their return was not conclusive upon the\r\nmembers elected, and that each house had the constitutional right\r\nto pass upon the returns and elections of its members, and to set\r\naside the action of the returning board.  The two houses, when\r\norganized, had also the power to pass upon the returns of the\r\nelection of governor, and they alone and no one else.  Neither the\r\nPresident of the United States nor the returning board has any\r\npower or right to pass upon the election of governor.  And here\r\nthe difficulty in the Louisiana case commences.\r\n\r\n\"Governor Packard contends that a majority of the two houses, as\r\nduly returned, did pass upon the election of the governor, and did\r\nreturn that he was duly elected, but this was stoutly denied by\r\nGovernor Nichols.  This vital point was strongly asserted and denied\r\nby the adverse parties, and the legislature of Louisiana divided\r\ninto two hostile bodies, holding separate session, each asserting\r\nits legal power, and denouncing the other as rebels and traitors.\r\nGovernor Packard and his legislature called upon President Grant\r\nfor the aid of the army to put down insurrection and domestic\r\nviolence; and here I confess that if I had been President, instead\r\nof General Grant, I would have recognized Packard and sustained\r\nhim with the full power of the general government.  My intense\r\nfeeling, caused by the atrocities in Louisiana, may have unduly\r\ninfluenced me.  But General Grant did not think this was his duty.\r\nI do not criticise his action, but only state the facts,  He would\r\nonly maintain the peace.  He would not recognize Packard as governor,\r\nbut I know, what is now an open secret, the strong bent of his\r\nmind, and at one time his decision was to withdraw the troops, to\r\nrecognize Nichols and thus end this dangerous contest.  He did not\r\ndo this, but kept the peace.\r\n\r\n\"But during these two months the whole condition of affairs had\r\nslowly changed in Louisiana.  The government of Packard had dwindled\r\naway until it had scarcely a shadow of strength or authority, except\r\nat the state house, where it was upheld by federal bayonets.  The\r\ngovernment of Nichols had extended its authority over the state\r\nand was in full existence as the _de facto_ government of Louisiana,\r\nsupported by the great body of the white men and nearly all the\r\nwealth and intelligence of the state, and by the tired acquiescence\r\nof a large portion of the colored people, some of whom deserted\r\nPackard's legislature and entered that of Governor Nichols.  The\r\ndelay and hesitation of General Grant had been fatal to Packard,\r\nand when Hayes became President the practical question was greatly\r\nchanged.  One thing was clear, that a legislature had been duly\r\nelected in November previous, and was then in existence, though\r\nseparated into two parts.  If the members lawfully elected could\r\nbe convened, they alone could decide the question of who was\r\ngovernor, without the intervention of troops, and their decision\r\ncould be supported, if necessary, by the general government.\r\n\r\n\"The most anxious consideration was given to this question.  Days\r\nand weeks of anxious deliberation were given to it by the President\r\nand his cabinet.  But one way seemed open for a peaceful solution,\r\nand that was to gather, if possible, a single legislature that\r\ncould be recognized as the depositary of the representative will\r\nof the people of Louisiana.  If this could be done it had the\r\nunquestioned right to decide who had been elected governor, and\r\nall other questions would settle themselves.  To aid in this object,\r\na commission of the most eminent men, high in position, from\r\ndifferent states, and distinguished for judicial impartiality, was\r\nselected and the result is known to all.  They went to Louisiana,\r\nand, with great difficulty, brought together these hostile legislatures\r\nwhich met, organized, promptly settled the question in dispute in\r\nfavor of the government of Nichols, and thus ended this most\r\ndangerous controversy.  No other change was made, no other act done\r\nexcept, when the solution was almost accomplished, the few troops\r\nwhich had then occupied that state house were withdrawn a few\r\nsquares away, to their barracks.  Thus, in this peaceful appeal to\r\nthe legislature of Louisiana, this controversy, which not only\r\nendangered the peace and safety of this state, but the peace and\r\nsafety of the whole people of the United States, was settled.  This\r\nis the sum and substance of all that was done in the southern\r\npolicy, as it is called, of the President.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I ought to state that his policy has a broader motive than\r\na mere settlement of a local election contest.  It seeks to bring\r\nthe north and south again into conditions of harmony and fraternity,\r\nand, by a frank appeal to the generous impulses and patriotic\r\nfeeling of all classes of people in the south, to secure, not only\r\npeace among themselves, but the equal protection of the laws to\r\nall, and security in the enjoyment of political and civil rights.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt the result in Louisiana caused some disappointment to\r\nmany Republicans throughout the United States, who deeply sympathized\r\nwith their Republican brethren in that state.  In that feeling I\r\ndid, and do, share, and yet I feel and know that every step taken\r\nby President Hayes was right, in strict accordance with his\r\nconstitutional duty, and from the highest motives of patriotism.\r\nSome are foolish enough to talk of his abandoning the colored people\r\nand their constitutional rights.  President Hayes, from his early\r\nmanhood, has been an anti-slavery man; his life was imperiled on\r\nmany battlefields in the great cause of liberty, he sympathizes\r\nmore and will do more for the equal rights of the colored people\r\nthan those who falsely accuse him, and I believe this day, that\r\nthe policy he has adopted will do more to secure the full practical\r\nenforcement of those rights than the employment of an army tenfold\r\ngreater than the army of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn this speech I stated the action I proposed to take to secure\r\nthe resumption of specie payments.  The plan was executed in all\r\nits parts by me, and my remarks may, in one sense, be said to be\r\na history of resumption.  Continuing I said:\r\n\r\n\"And now, fellow-citizens, this brings me to the question upon\r\nwhich there is so much diversity of opinion, so many strange\r\ndelusions, and that is the question of specie payments.  What do\r\nwe mean by this phrase?  Is it, that we are to have no paper money\r\nin circulation?  If so, I am as much opposed to it as any of you.\r\nIs it that we are to retire our greenback circulation?  If so, I\r\nam opposed to it and have often so said.  What I mean by specie\r\npayments is simply that paper money ought to be made equal to coin,\r\nso that when you receive it, it will buy as much beef, corn or\r\nclothing as coin.\r\n\r\n\"Now the importance of this cannot be overestimated.  A depreciated\r\npaper money cheats and robs every man who receives it, of a portion\r\nof the reward of his labor or production, and, in all times, it\r\nhas been treated by statesmen as one of the greatest evils that\r\ncan befall a people.  There are times when such money is unavoidable,\r\nas during war or great public calamity, but it has always been the\r\nanxious care of statesmen to return again to the solid standard of\r\ncoin.  Therefore it is that specie payments, or a specie standard,\r\nis pressed by the great body of intelligent men who study these\r\nquestions, as an indispensable prerequisite for steady business\r\nand good times.\r\n\r\n\"Now, most of you will agree to all this, and will only differ as\r\nto the mode, or time, and manner; but there is a large class of\r\npeople who believe that paper can be, and ought to be, made into\r\nmoney without any promise or hope of redemption; that a note should\r\nbe printed:  'This is a dollar,' and be made a legal tender.\r\n\r\n\"I regard this as a mild form of lunacy, and have no disposition\r\nto debate with men who indulge in such delusions, which have\r\nprevailed to some extent, at different times, in all countries,\r\nbut whose life has been brief, and which have ever shared the fate\r\nof other popular delusions.  Congress will never entertain such a\r\nproposition, and, if it should, we know that the scheme would not\r\nstand a moment before the Supreme Court.  That court only maintained\r\nthe constitutionality of the legal tender promise to pay a dollar\r\nby a divided court, and on the ground that it was issued during\r\nthe war, as in the nature of a forced loan, to be redeemed upon\r\nthe payment of a real dollar; that is, so many grains of silver or\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore dismiss such wild theories, and speak only to those\r\nwho are willing to assume, as an axiom, that gold and silver, or\r\ncoined money, have been proven by all human experience to be the\r\nbest possible standards of value, and that paper money is simply\r\na promise to pay such coined money, and should be made and kept\r\nequal to coined money, by being convertible on demand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the question is as to the time and mode by which this may be\r\nbrought about, and on this subject no man should be dogmatic, or\r\nstand, without yielding, upon a plan of his own, but should be\r\nwilling to give and take, securing the best expedient that public\r\nopinion will allow to be adopted.  The purpose and obligation to\r\nbring our paper money to the standard of coin have been over and\r\nover again announced by acts of Congress, and by the platforms of\r\nthe great political parties of the country.  If resolutions and\r\npromises would bring about specie payments, we would have been\r\nthere long ago; but the diversity of opinion as to the mode now--\r\ntwelve years after the close of the war--still leaves our paper\r\nmoney at a discount of five per cent.  Until this is removed, there\r\nwill be no new enterprises involving great sums, no active industries,\r\nbut money will lie idle, and watch and wait the changes that may\r\nbe made before we reach the specie standard.\r\n\r\n\"In 1869, Congress pledged the public faith that the United States\r\nwould pay coin for United States notes.  Again, in January, 1875,\r\nafter more than a year's debate, Congress declared that on and\r\nafter the 1st of January, 1879, the United States would pay its\r\nnotes in coin.\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary of the Treasury is expressly required to prepare\r\nfor, and maintain, the redemption of all United States notes\r\npresented at the treasury on and after that date, and for that\r\npurpose he is authorized to use all the surplus revenues, and to\r\nsell bonds of the United States bearing four, four and a half, and\r\nfive per cent. interest, at par in coin.  It is this law, called\r\nthe resumption act, now so much discussed in the papers, that\r\nimposes upon the office I hold most difficult and important duties,\r\nand without replying to any attacks made upon me, I am anxious to\r\nconvey to you personally, what I have done, and what I must do, in\r\nobedience to the provisions of this act.  It is said that the law\r\nis defective, but, if the great object and policy of the law is\r\nright, the machinery of the law could easily be changed by Congress.\r\nThat resumption can be secured, and ought to be secured, under this\r\nlaw, it will be my purpose to show you, and I shall not hesitate\r\nto point out such defects in the law as have occurred to me in its\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\"There are two modes of resumption; one is to diminish the amount\r\nof notes to be redeemed, which mode is commonly called a contraction\r\nof the currency; the other is to accumulate coin in the treasury,\r\nto enable the secretary to maintain the notes at par.\"\r\n\r\nObjection had been made that under the first mode resumption would\r\nbe a process of converting a non-interest bearing note into an\r\ninterest bearing note, and that was true, but what right had we,\r\nas a nation, or had any bank, or individual, to force in to\r\ncirculation, as money, its note upon which it paid no interest?\r\nWhy ought not anyone who issued a promise to pay on demand be made\r\nto pay it when demanded, or pay interest thereafter?  What right\r\nhad he, in law or justice, to insist upon maintaining in circulation\r\nhis note, which he refused to pay according to his promise, and\r\nwhich he refused to receive in payment of a note bearing interest?\r\nA certain amount of United States notes could be, and ought to be,\r\nmaintained at par in coin, with the aid of a moderate coin reserve\r\nheld in the treasury, and to the extent that this could be done\r\nthey formed the best possible paper money, a debt of the people\r\nwithout interest, of equal value with coin, and more convenient to\r\ncarry and handle.  Beyond this the issue of paper money, either by\r\nthe government or by banks, was a dangerous exercise of power,\r\ninjurious to all citizens, and should not continue a single day\r\nbeyond the necessities that gave it birth.  I added:\r\n\r\n\"The one practical defect in the law is, that the secretary is not\r\na liberty to sell bonds of the United States for United States\r\nnotes, but must sell them for coin.  As coin is not in circulation\r\namong the people, he is practically prohibited from selling bonds\r\nto the people, except by an evasion of the law, or through private\r\nparties.  Bonds are in demand and can readily be sold at par in\r\ncoin, and still easier at par, or at a premium, in United States\r\nnotes.  The process of selling for United States notes need not go\r\nfar before the mere fact that they are receivable for bonds would\r\nbring them up to par in coin, and that is specie payments.\r\n\r\n\"But the reason of the refusal of Congress to grant this authority,\r\noften asked of it, was that it would contract the currency, and\r\nthis fear of contraction has thus far prevented Congress from\r\ngranting the easiest, plainest, and surest mode of resumption.  To\r\navoid contraction, it provided that national bank notes may be\r\nissued without limit as to amount and that, when issued, United\r\nStates notes might be retired to the extent of four-fifths of the\r\nbank notes issued.  This was the only provision for redeeming United\r\nStates notes that Congress made or would make, and this, it was\r\nsupposed, would reduce the United States notes to $300,000,000\r\nbefore January 1, 1879.  The actual experiment only proves the\r\nfolly of the cry we had for more money, more money.\"\r\n\r\nThe second mode of resuming was by accumulating coin gradually, so\r\nthat when the time fixed for resumption should arrive, the treasury\r\nmight be able to redeem such notes as should be presented.  In this\r\nrespect the resumption act was as full and liberal as human language\r\ncould frame it.  The secretary was authorized to prepare for\r\nresumption, and for that purpose to use the surplus revenue and\r\nsell either of the three classes of bonds, all of which in 1877\r\nwere at or above par in coin.  I said:  \"The power can be, ought\r\nto be, and will be, executed if not repealed.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was printed in the leading papers in the United States\r\nand in England, and was regarded by the public at large as a\r\ndeclaration of the policy of the administration, to enforce the\r\nresumption law, whatever might be the current of opinion developed\r\nat the approaching elections, which, as they occurred, were generally\r\nagainst the Republican party.  The Democratic party had taken\r\nposition against the resumption act, in favor of the enlarged issue\r\nof United States notes and the free coinage of silver.  The strikes\r\nled to the organization of labor unions, which, though independent\r\nof political parties, chiefly affected the Republican party then\r\nin power.\r\n\r\nAmong many letters received by me, after this speech, I insert one\r\nfrom Mr. Evarts:\r\n\r\n  \"Windsor, Vt., Aug. 30, 1877.\r\n\"The Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. Sherman:--I congratulate you upon the excellence and\r\nsuccess of your speech in Ohio.  The difficulty of the undertaking\r\njustly enhances the credit of its prosperous treatment.\r\n\r\n\"I inclose a remonstrance from an 'Injustice' on the subject of a\r\nnew arrangement in the _weighing_ at the customhouse.  It was sent\r\nto me at Washington and forwarded from there here.  I know nothing\r\nof its source and have no opinion on the subject of the supposed\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\"The President's visit has pleased the people in New England\r\namazingly.  I hope to see you all in Washington early next week.\r\n\r\n  \"I am very truly yours,\r\n  \"Wm. M. Evarts.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September, 1877, I sent to Hon. Stanley Matthews\r\nthe following letter, giving my view of the position taken by\r\nGeneral Ewing and Mr. Pendleton:\r\n\r\n\"At the request of General Robinson I have directed to you, in the\r\ncare of Bickham, a number of documents for reference in your debate\r\nwith Ewing, and as Robinson says you wish me to make suggestions,\r\nI venture to do so, but without any confidence that they can be of\r\nassistance, though they can do no harm.\r\n\r\n\"The most beneficial financial act of the administration is the\r\nreduction of the interest on the public debt.  The amount already\r\naccomplished is stated in my printed speech.  The rapidity of this\r\nprocess depends entirely upon the credit of the government.  Ewing's\r\npolicy would destroy our credit and stop the process.  The very\r\ndoubts created by him and Pendleton have already damaged the\r\ngovernment very largely.  Confidence is so sensitive that when\r\nprominent men like Ewing and Pendleton talk as they do, the injury\r\nis immediate.\r\n\r\n\"The whole difference between the amount of silver and gold at this\r\nmoment is eight per cent., so that the payment of the debt in silver\r\nwould lessen the burden of the debt eight per cent., but under the\r\nfunding operations, which would be entirely destroyed by anything\r\nthat alarmed the market, we are enabled to save thirty-three per\r\ncent.  Whatever may be our right to pay our bonds, either in\r\ngreenbacks or in silver, this question of expediency, as you very\r\nproperly said in one of your speeches, is to be considered apart\r\nfrom the question of legal power.\r\n\r\n\"Refunding would go on with greatly accelerated speed if we could\r\nsell bonds for greenbacks.  We make discrimination against the\r\ngreenbacks by refusing to take them in payment of bonds.  If I had\r\nthe power to sell bonds for greenbacks I could make greenbacks\r\nequal to coin with scarcely a perceptible change.  That is the\r\nadvice of the most sagacious men in the country.  I know it.  There\r\nis talk about the bondholder being a privileged person.  He ought\r\nto be so no longer, and the moment that a bond could be bought with\r\ncurrency at par in gold, all discrimination in favor of the bondholder\r\nwould disappear.\r\n\r\n\"The differences among Republicans about silver will be settled by\r\nthe use of the silver dollar to the extent that it can be kept in\r\ncirculation at par with greenbacks, and is a pure question of\r\ndetail.  The difference in the Democratic party about interconvertible\r\ncurrency is vital, and Ewing's doctrine overthrows the whole\r\nDemocratic theory of finance before the war.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of the national banks is a question simply of policy\r\nand not a question of principle.  The right conferred upon banks\r\nto issue circulation is not conferred for their profit, but for\r\nthe public convenience, and all Republicans can agree that that\r\nright should never be permitted to exist except when it is for the\r\npublic convenience.  The office of bank notes is simply to supply\r\nthe ebb and flow of currency made necessary by the wants of business.\r\nThe United States cannot lend United States notes, and therefore\r\ncannot meet this want.  Ewing proposes to destroy the whole national\r\nbank system, interwoven with all the business of the country.  I\r\nsend you the last statement of the national banks.  You can very\r\neasily show the effect upon the reviving industry of the country\r\nof the withdrawal of these loans and disturbing all this business.\r\nAs at present organized the circulation is the vital thing, and if\r\nthe bonds held by the banks to secure circulation were thrown upon\r\nthe market, it would stop funding and compel also the withdrawal\r\nof loans, and create distress compared with which our present\r\ntroubles are mere moonshine.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you will think I am going on to make a speech for you,\r\nso I will stop abruptly, with the promise that if I can furnish\r\nyou any documents or information that may be of service to you I\r\nwill do so with pleasure.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I inclose the last statement of the national banks containing many\r\npoints that may be of use.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the question of resumption I believe we are all agreed that\r\nit must come, and that the only standard of value is gold or silver\r\ncoin.  The time and manner are the points of disagreement.  Ewing\r\nis opposed to all resumption, but believes in printing a dollar\r\nand saying it is a dollar, while all the world would know that the\r\ndeclaration is a lie.  The fact that we have advanced the greenbacks\r\nsix per cent. in one year, by the movements made under the resumption\r\nact, shows that it is working pretty well.  I send you a statement\r\nshowing the changed condition in a year of our finances.\r\n\r\n\"While the people differ about the resumption act there is time to\r\nchange it if it needs change, but Ewing would go back and commence\r\nthe process over again.  I am disposed to be tolerant about\r\ndifferences on the resumption act, for I think it will demonstrate\r\nits success or failure before Congress is likely to tamper with it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September I wrote to General J. S. Robinson the\r\nfollowing letter, evincing my anxiety as to the result of the\r\ncanvass in Ohio, as it was then conducted:\r\n\r\n\"I am so deeply impressed with the importance of the campaign in\r\nOhio that it makes me uneasy and restless that I cannot participate\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\"What a magnificent chance the Republican party in Ohio now has,\r\nnot only to place itself in the vanguard in the United States, but\r\nto do this country a service as great as any victory won by the\r\nUnion army during the war.  Here it is demonstrated by the cordial\r\nreception of the President in the south, by his hearty indorsement\r\nin Massachusetts, and by a public sentiment now growing and spreading\r\nwith amazing rapidity, that in his southern policy he has opened\r\nthe means of order, safety, peace and security in all the southern\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\"Now, when it is demonstrated that the difficulties in the way of\r\nresumption were myths conjured up by the fantasies of demagogues,\r\nwhen our notes are worth within three per cent. of gold, when\r\nProvidence has favored us with boundless crops, and prosperity is\r\nagain coming upon us after a dreary time of distress and trial\r\ncaused by inflated paper money, why is it that we cannot see all\r\nthese things and avail ourselves of the advantage they give us in\r\nour political contest?  It seems to me that we ought to carry the\r\nstate by an overwhelming majority, and if we do so we will establish\r\nthe beneficial principles of our party beyond danger of overthrow\r\nby reaction, and we will secure the peaceful and orderly development\r\nof industry without a parallel in our previous history.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it were in my power to impress every Republican in Ohio\r\nwith my earnest conviction about this matter, but here, constantly\r\noccupied by official duties, I can only remain watching and waiting\r\nin anxious suspense lest the great advantages we possess shall be\r\nfrittered away or lost by inaction or mistakes.\r\n\r\n\"I know you will do your utmost for success, and only write you\r\nthis to show you how earnestly I sympathize with you in your\r\nefforts.\"\r\n\r\nThe election in Ohio, in October, resulted in the defeat of William\r\nH. West, Republican, for governor, mainly on account of his position\r\nas to labor unions, but no doubt also because of a feeling of\r\nopposition against the resumption of specie payments.  Richard M.\r\nBishop, Democrat, was elected governor, with a Democratic legislature\r\nin both branches, which subsequently elected George H. Pendleton\r\nas United States Senator.\r\n\r\nThe following letter expresses my view of the election, and the\r\ncauses which led to our defeat:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, October 17, 1877.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 13th inst. is received.\r\n\r\n\"Your statement of the causes of our defeat in Ohio seems to me\r\nreasonable, though probably I would not agree with you in many\r\npoints stated.\r\n\r\n\"It is not worth while now to bother ourselves about what we cannot\r\nhelp.  All we can do is to inquire how far we have been right, and\r\nto that extent pursue the right, whether victory or defeat is the\r\nresult.  No party can administer a government, that will not take\r\nthe risk of temporary defeat when it is pursuing what, in the\r\nopinion of the great masses of it, is a beneficial policy for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"So far as the southern question is concerned, I feel that the\r\nPresident did right.  The wisdom of his executive order as to office\r\nholders depends upon the construction given to it, and he is not\r\nresponsible for a perverted construction not authorized by its\r\nwords or terms.  As to the resumption policy, the law is plain and\r\nmandatory, and, more than all, the law is right, and the Republican\r\nparty might as well understand first as last, that the question of\r\nresumption is one higher than any party obligations and will be\r\npursued by our adversaries if we do not.  We can gain the credit\r\nof success, but we can gain no credit by retreating on this vital\r\nquestion.  While the law stands nothing is left but to execute it,\r\nand for one I never would aid to alter the law, except to make it\r\nmore effective, and would be very willing to retire on this question\r\nrather than to surrender.\r\n\r\n\"The only way is for us to go steadily forward, with a certainty\r\nthat public opinion in the end will sustain us if we do what is\r\nsubstantially right.  The Republican party has been in this position\r\nmany times and has never won success by retreat and cannot do so\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"A. P. Miller, Esq., Toledo, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nIt became necessary for the President to call an extra session of\r\nCongress, on account of the failure of the passage of the army bill\r\nat the previous session.  Though the proclamation was issued on\r\nthe 5th of May, 1877, Congress was not convened until the 15th of\r\nOctober following.  Both Houses met on the day appointed.  The\r\nSenate was organized by the election of Thomas W. Ferry, of Michigan,\r\nas president _pro tempore_, and Samuel J. Randall, a Democratic\r\nMember from Pennsylvania, was elected speaker of the House by a\r\nmajority of seventeen over James A. Garfield, the Republican\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nThe message of the President was confined mainly to the circumstances\r\nconnected with the failure of the previous Congress to provide for\r\nthe support of the army, and to certain deficiencies in appropriations\r\nrequired for the government, the President stating that as certain\r\nacts of Congress, providing for reports of the government officials,\r\nrequired their submission at the regular annual session, he deferred\r\nuntil that time any further reference to subjects of popular\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nCongress, however, not being confined in its powers, and having\r\nfull jurisdiction of all legislative questions, proceeded at once\r\nto discuss financial questions and especially the measures taken\r\nfor the resumption of specie payments.  No less than four bills\r\nwere introduced in the Senate and fourteen in the House, providing\r\nfor the repeal, in whole or in part, of the act for the resumption\r\nof specie payments.  One of these bills was reported from the\r\ncommittee on banking and currency, by Mr. Ewing, on the 31st of\r\nOctober.  It was the subject of debate during the remaining period\r\nof the session, and finally passed the House on the 23rd of November,\r\nby the vote of 133 yeas and 120 nays.  It repealed all that part\r\nof the resumption act which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto dispose of United States bonds, and to redeem and cancel the\r\ngreenback currency, or practically all the resumption act except\r\nthe clauses for the substitution of silver coin for fractional\r\ncurrency.  It was sent to the Senate on the 26th of November, and\r\nreferred to the committee on finance.  No action was taken upon it\r\nduring that session, which adjourned on the 3rd of December.  The\r\nregular session convened on the same day, with this bill still\r\npending in the committee on finance.  On the 17th of April, 1878,\r\nMr. Ferry, from that committee, reported back the bill with an\r\namendment to strike out all after the enacting clause, and insert\r\nnew matter.  After a long debate ending on the 13th of June, the\r\nfollowing amendment was adopted as a substitute for Mr. Ferry's\r\namendment, by a vote of yeas 30, nays 29:\r\n\r\n\"That from and after the passage of this act United States notes\r\nshall be receivable the same as coin in payment for the four per\r\ncent. bonds now authorized by law to be issued; and on and after\r\nOctober 1, 1878, said notes shall be receivable for duties on\r\nimports.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill, as amended, passed the Senate by a large majority.  In\r\nthis form it had no proper relevancy to the bill as it passed the\r\nHouse, and the action of the Senate was regarded as a practical\r\ndefeat of the bill.  It was taken up in the House on the 14th of\r\nJune, and the question being taken on concurring in the amendment\r\nof the Senate, the vote was yeas 112, nays 122, so the motion was\r\ndisagreed to.  On the 17th of June, a motion was made to suspend\r\nthe rules and proceed to the consideration of the bill, but as two-\r\nthirds did not vote in favor of the motion it was not adopted, and\r\nthe bill was not called up for action until the next session of\r\nCongress, when Mr. Ewing, on February 22, 1879, reported it from\r\nthe committee on banking and currency, and moved to concur in the\r\nSenate amendments, with amendments changing the date on which the\r\nact should take effect, and also adding, \"that the money hereafter\r\nreceived from any sale of bonds of the United States shall be\r\napplied only to the redemption of other bonds bearing a higher rate\r\nof interest, and subject to call.\"\r\n\r\nThis motion came too late, as the whole subject-matter had been\r\ndisposed of by the resumption of specie payments on the 1st of\r\nJanuary previous.  It led, however, to a considerable debate in\r\nwhich Mr. Garfield participated.  He made a humorous allusion to\r\nthe revival of controversies that were past and gone since the 1st\r\nof January, and moved to lay the bill and the amendments upon the\r\ntable.  That was adopted by a vote of yeas 141, nays 118.\r\n\r\nI have given the official history of the efforts to repeal the\r\nresumption act, but it would be beyond the limits of this book to\r\nquote, or even state, the copious speeches for and against resumption.\r\nI felt secure, for if such a bill should pass, the executive veto\r\nwould prevent any action by Congress that would interfere with the\r\nexecution of the law.  My principal effort was to convince Congress\r\nthat it ought not to interfere with what the House called a\r\ndestructive experiment, but what I regarded as an easy and beneficial\r\nexecution of existing law.  A large part of the opposition was\r\npurely political.  The resumption act was a Republican measure,\r\nvoted for only by Republicans.  The Democratic party had, by the\r\nelections just previous to its taking effect, secured a majority\r\nin the House, and, with the aid of a few Republican Senators, with\r\nstrong \"greenback\" proclivities, had the control of the Senate on\r\nthe financial question.\r\n\r\nThis political condition in the fall of 1877 tended to prevent the\r\nsale of four per cent. bonds after the close of the popular loan.\r\nMy official correspondence with members of the syndicate, and with\r\nMr. Conant, published by order of the House of Representatives in\r\nthe volume \"Specie Resumption and Refunding of the National Debt,\"\r\nshows fully the earnest effort made by me to sell the four per\r\ncent. bonds.  This was successful to a slight degree in August and\r\nSeptember, but sales were substantially suspended after that date,\r\nuntil it became manifest that the two Houses could not agree upon\r\nthe repeal of the resumption act, or the remonetization of silver.\r\nThe threatened measure for the free coinage of silver, and the fear\r\nthat the bonds would be paid in silver coin less valuable than the\r\ngold coin paid for them, tended, more than the efforts to repeal\r\nthe resumption, to prevent the sale of bonds.\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, Ohio, August 18, 1877.\r\n\"Dear Mr. Conant:--Your letter of the 4th was forwarded to me here.\r\nI notice what you say about the calls, but you must remember that\r\nout of the sales of four per cent. bonds we must provide five\r\nmillions gold for each of the months of September and October, so\r\nthat for ten millions of bonds there must be no calls.  I should\r\nhave informed you of this sooner, but neglected to do so before\r\nleaving.  The parties in New York, and no doubt the Rothschilds,\r\nhave been advised of it and agree to it.  Until the popular\r\nsubscription is paid for it will be difficult to press the sale of\r\nthe four per cents., but I hope in September the sales will commence\r\nand be pushed rapidly.  The movement of the crop has already\r\ncommenced.  The strike seems to be ended, with a better feeling\r\namong laborers, and some advance in freight.  The necessity of the\r\ntrunk lines combining on freight is so clear that it is likely to\r\nresult in some agreement that will stand.\r\n\r\n\"I made a speech here yesterday, which no doubt will be received\r\nby you in the New York papers in due time, and which contains some\r\nmatters affecting your operations.  It is substantially in conformity\r\nwith the general wish of the administration as to financial affairs,\r\nand it might be well for you to call the attention of the Rothschilds\r\nto that part of it relating to our loans and the basis of our\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n\"I return next week to Washington, where I will again be happy to\r\nhear from you.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conant answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"New Court, St. Swithin's Lane,          }\r\n  \"London, E. C., England, August 23, 1877.}\r\n\"Dear Mr. Secretary:--I was very glad indeed to receive your letter\r\nof the 6th instant.  I at once informed the contracting parties of\r\nwhat you had written in reference to the strikes and riots at home.\r\nThe sale of our bonds has not been directly interfered with on\r\naccount of the riots.  In fact, the occurrence of the riots has\r\nalmost been forgotten.  The London 'Times,' of this morning, has,\r\nhowever, revived the subject by printing a letter from its Philadelphia\r\ncorrespondent, in which he says that the strikers, it is evident,\r\nare to get into politics through the organization of a party, to\r\nbe called the 'Workingmen's party;' and he predicts that mischief\r\nwill come out of it through the control of state governments which\r\nthe mob element may gain; and the consequent enactment of bad laws,\r\netc., especially against capital.  Another letter is also printed\r\n(written by a Mr. Connolly), by which it is made to appear that\r\nAmerican is in a terrible financial condition.  These two letters\r\nare made the subject of an editorial which, on the whole, is not\r\nvery complimentary to us, nor calculated to improve our credit.\r\nThe 'Times' of last Monday's date had an editorial on the speech\r\nwhich you made in Ohio on Friday last.  I send you a copy, and\r\nthink, if you can find time, you will rather enjoy reading the\r\narticle.  Nearly all of the English people, as you are aware,\r\nbelieve in the principle of 'free trade,' and it is but natural\r\nthat they should, for the reason that England depends upon her\r\ngreat commerce and her markets in every part of the globe for the\r\nemployment and maintenance of her people.  People here think that\r\nour protectionist tariffs are not only detrimental to the commercial\r\ninterest of our own country, but that they are of a suicidal\r\ncharacter so far as our fiscal policy is concerned.  They think,\r\nin other words, that it would be vastly better for the real interest\r\nof the people of the United States if they would trade more\r\nextensively with the people of England.  What the 'Times' editor\r\nhas to say about the balance of trade will amuse you, and yet people\r\ntalk about the advantages of a balance of trade as being an exploded\r\nidea.  English interests are laboring to effect a new treaty with\r\nFrance, under which large reductions in duties are proposed.\r\n\r\n\"I note what you are pleased to say in regard to sales of bonds\r\nduring the present month.  With the price of bonds at the present\r\nmoment they cannot of course be sold.  The parties will find it\r\nnecessary to use great caution as well as care in managing the\r\nmarket, so as to get control of it.  Any attempt to force the sale\r\nof the bonds during this, and, I think, next month will only operate\r\nto keep the price so low that they cannot be sold at all.  I am\r\nfirm in the belief that the premium on gold will go gradually lower,\r\nand that the balance of trade in our favor will keep forcing it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n  \"I remain your obedient servant,\r\n  \"Chas. F. Conant.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nHe again wrote on the 30th of August:\r\n\r\n\"On Tuesday last a further amount of gold (£130,000) was withdrawn\r\nfrom the Bank of England for shipment to the United States, and\r\nfor the purpose of protecting its stock of bullion the bank\r\nimmediately advanced its rate to three per cent., and also increased\r\nthe price of American eagles.\r\n\r\n\"Great Britain must obtain from us this season a large supply of\r\nbreadstuffs and grain, larger than has been required in any one\r\nyear during several years past, and at higher prices than those\r\nheretofore paid, and, in the present condition of trade between\r\nthe two countries, gold, to quite an extent, will have to be sent\r\nover in payment for these articles.  Therefore, advancing the rate\r\nof interest may check for a time, but will not stop altogether,\r\nthe shipment of bullion, but it may attract here some of the gold\r\nheld by the Bank of France.  The bank rate does not govern the\r\nstreet rate, and a further advance by the bank, which it is very\r\nlikely may be made, is not to be considered as indicating that we\r\nare to have a dearer money market.  I inquired to-day of Mr. Morgan\r\nand the Messrs. Rothschild what they thought of the prospects of\r\nmaking any sales during next month, and their answer was:  'Wait\r\npatiently for the market to recuperate.'  I am satisfied that good\r\ninvestment securities are scarce here; that they have been cleared\r\nfrom the market, and that as soon as the question of cheap or dear\r\nmoney is settled, sales of the four per cent. consols will be\r\nresumed.  The amount of the sales will of course depend upon which\r\nway the question is settled.  There were times during the placing\r\nof the five per cent. and four and a half per cent. bonds when, as\r\nyou are aware, operations were suspended for quite a time, the\r\ncondition of the market being such as to prevent anything being\r\ndone.  From semi-official accounts it appears that the famine in\r\nIndia is a very serious affair, and it is quite possible that large\r\nsums of money will be required from here with which to purchase\r\nsupplies.\"\r\n\r\nMy experience thus far convinced me that it was bad public policy\r\nto continue the sale of bonds for refunding purposes through a\r\nsyndicate of bankers, the chief of whom resided in London.  I could\r\nsee no reason why this function could not be performed by national\r\nbanks, better than by bankers at home or abroad.  A question arose\r\nwhether the Secretary of the Treasury had the power to designate\r\nnational banks as public depositaries of the proceeds of bonds sold\r\nunder the resumption and refunding acts.  The object to be gained\r\nby this designation was to prevent the withdrawal of coin from\r\ncirculation, and the undue accumulation of coin in the treasury of\r\nthe United States.  If the exchange of one bond by another could\r\nbe directly effected through the banks without the payment of coin,\r\nit would facilitate the process of refunding.  I submitted this\r\ninquiry to Attorney General Devens, and on the 30th of August he\r\nstated his opinion and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In answer to your inquiry, I have, therefore, the honor to say\r\nthat the Secretary of the Treasury, if he deems it expedient as a\r\nmatter of administrative policy, may sell bonds under the act known\r\nas the 'refunding' and 'resumption' acts, depositing the amounts\r\nreceived therefrom with such public depositaries as he may select\r\nunder the national bank act, taking such security as is required\r\nby the statutes.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the popular subscriptions for the four per cent. bonds\r\nbecame due on the 16th of October, and all were paid for but three\r\nsubscriptions aggregating $1,600, and these were assumed by the\r\nsyndicate.  The bonds had been paid for by the syndicate either by\r\ncalled six per cent. bonds, which were canceled, or in gold coin\r\ndeposited in the treasury, without the loss of a dollar.  The called\r\nsession of Congress, which met on the 15th of October, and the\r\nagitation of the repeal of the resumption act and the remonetization\r\nof silver, prevented for the time any further sales of the four\r\nper cent. bonds by the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SHERMAN'S\r\nRECOLLECTIONS\r\nOF\r\nFORTY YEARS\r\nIN\r\nTHE HOUSE, SENATE AND CABINET\r\nAN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED\r\nWITH PORTRAITS, FAC-SIMILE LETTERS, SCENES, ETC.\r\n\r\nGREENWOOD PRESS, PUBLISHERS\r\nNEW YORK 1968\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1895, By John Sherman\r\n\r\nFirst Greenwood reprinting, 1968\r\n\r\nLIBRARY OF CONGRESS catalogue card number:  68-28647\r\n\r\nPrinted in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman in His Library at Washington, D.

The motion to suspend the\r\nrules cut off all amendments and all debate.  Several members\r\ndemanded a hearing.  Efforts were made to adjourn, but this was\r\nrefused.  The previous question being ordered and the rules suspended,\r\na single vote would introduce the bill without a reference to a\r\ncommittee, and would pass it without any power of amendment, without\r\nthe usual reading at three separate times.  The motion was agreed\r\nto by a vote of yeas 163, nays 34.  So, two-thirds voting in favor\r\nthereof, the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.\r\n\r\nThe first section of this bill provided that there shall be coined,\r\nat the several mints of the United States, the silver dollar of\r\nthe weight of 412½ grains, troy, of standard silver, as provided\r\nin the act of January 18, 1837, on which shall be the devices and\r\nsuperscriptions provided by said act; which coins, together with\r\nall silver dollars heretofore coined by the United States, of like\r\nweight and fineness, shall be a legal tender at their nominal value\r\nfor all debts and dues, public and private, except where otherwise\r\nprovided by contract; and any owner of silver bullion may deposit\r\nthe same in any United States coinage mint or assay office, to be\r\ncoined into such dollars for his benefit, upon the same terms and\r\nconditions as gold bullion is deposited for coinage under existing\r\nlaw.  Section 2 provided for repealing all acts and parts of acts\r\ninconsistent with provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nThus this bill, of wide-reaching importance, was introduced and\r\npassed by the House under the previous question, and a suspension\r\nof the rules without debate on the same day of its introduction by\r\na vote of yeas 163, nays 34.  It was sent to the Senate and referred\r\nto the committee on finance.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Mr. Ewing moved in the House of Representatives to\r\nsuspend the rules and adopt the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the bill to repeal the third section of the\r\nresumption law be made the special order, not to interfere with\r\nany appropriation bills, for to-morrow at the expiration of the\r\nmorning hour, and from day to day thereafter until the following\r\nTuesday at three o'clock, when the previous question shall be\r\nordered on it and on any amendments then pending, all amendments\r\nmeanwhile to be in order, provided the time shall be extended, if\r\nnecessary, so as to allow five days after the morning hour for the\r\nconsideration of said bill and amendments.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution passed by a vote of yeas 143, nays 47.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this action of the House, the syndicate declined\r\nto offer the bonds, and no further calls for six per cent. bonds\r\nwere therefore made.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of November August Belmont wrote me from New York as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\n\"I fear that the threatening position of the silver question will\r\ncheck completely any demand for the four per cent. bonds here and\r\nin Europe.  The damage which the passage of this measure will do\r\nto our public credit abroad _cannot be over estimated_.  To remonetize\r\nsilver upon the old standard, and make it a legal tender for all\r\nprivate and public debts, will be considered by the whole civilized\r\nworld as an act of repudiation on the part of the federal government,\r\nand cast a stain upon our national credit, which has hitherto stood\r\nas high and bright as that of any government in the world.\r\n\r\n\"It is just as much repudiation for the federal government to compel\r\nits bondholders to accept the payment of their interest in silver,\r\nwhich is at a discount of ten per cent., against the gold which\r\nthe government received for the bonds, as it would be if Congress\r\ndecreed that all the bonds of the United States should not bear a\r\nhigher interest than two per cent. per annum.  To do such a thing\r\nnow as is contemplated by the Bland silver bill, when the federal\r\nfinances are in a flourishing condition, when the premium of gold\r\nhas been reduced two and a half to three per cent., and when our\r\nfunded debt sells equal to that of any other public security in\r\nthe world, is actually as if a man of wealth and position, who had\r\nby a life-long course of strict honesty acquired the well-earned\r\nconfidence and respect of his fellow-citizens and of the outer\r\nworld, should in the midst of his affluence, and without the\r\npalliating excuse of any temptation of want or necessity, commit\r\nopen theft.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I do not over estimate the damaging effect which the\r\npassage of the bill must have upon American credit.  All my letters\r\nfrom abroad, and conversations with people familiar with the English\r\nand continental money markets, confirm my convictions on that point.\r\nWhen you look back and find in the archives of your department the\r\nproud records of a nation's faith kept inviolate with a most\r\npunctilious and chivalrous spirit during a century, amidst all the\r\ntrials of foreign and civil war which strained the resources of\r\nour country to the very verge of ruin, the task before you is\r\ncertainly a difficult and harassing one; but while the path of duty\r\nis often narrow and difficult, it is always straight and so well\r\ndefined that it can never be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"Sound financial policy and love of our country's fair name alike\r\ndemand from those to whom the administration of its affairs have\r\nbeen intrusted the most uncompromising hostility to the _blind_\r\nand _dishonest_ frenzy which has taken hold of Congress, and I\r\nsincerely hope that you will be seconded in the task before you by\r\nthe hearty support of the President and your colleagues.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November I was advised that the four per cent. bonds\r\nwere selling at 99 and interest, in a small way only.  The syndicate\r\nhad bought in the market about $750,000 of these bonds at less than\r\npar in order to prevent a further depreciation.  On the same day\r\nI was informed by August Belmont & Co., as follows:\r\n\r\n\"After conference and careful consideration of the whole subject,\r\nit is the conclusion of all the associates, in Europe and here,\r\nthat it is injudicious to undertake further negotiations of the\r\nfours, during the pendency of the legislation proposing to make\r\nsilver a full legal tender, as the discussion has checked dealings\r\nin the bonds by the public.  To make a call in the face of a market\r\nquotation (to-day 98¾ and interest) below the price fixed by law\r\nwould not convince the public that new business had been undertaken\r\nat a loss, but that the call was connected with business previously\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Further than this, we are satisfied that, holding the views\r\nexpressed in your letters mentioned, the President and all his\r\ncabinet will agree with us that it would be wrong for us to ask\r\nfor another call at this juncture, as such action would be held by\r\nthose advocating the legislation in favor of silver as proving that\r\nsuch legislation in our opinion was not prejudicial to the national\r\ncredit and the refunding of our national debt.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November Mr. Conant wrote me that our bonds had been\r\ndepressed by the rumors which had been circulated respecting probable\r\nlegislation which would depreciate their value, and that four and\r\na half per cent. bonds had fallen off three-fourths per cent.  He\r\nsaid:  \"If, in any legislation which may be enacted regarding\r\nsilver, provision could be made not only exempting the debt and\r\ninterest thereon from payment in silver, but declaring that payment\r\nof the same shall be made in gold coin, it would aid us immeasurably\r\nin placing our bonds.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later I received a letter from F. O. French, of New York,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Our business people are very much alarmed at the rumored strength\r\nof the silver people, and, as they apprehend the gravest disasters\r\nfrom the success of the Bland bill, a committee of gentlemen\r\nconnected with insurance and trust companies, as well as with the\r\nbanks, go to Washington to-morrow to present their views to the\r\nfinance committee.\r\n\r\n\"Once dispatch this silver business--and I have faith that it cannot\r\nlive in the light of full discussion by the Senate--and we shall\r\nrenew funding, and by attaining resumption put an end to financial\r\ndiscussions as we did to slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the following day I wrote to August Belmont & Co.:\r\n\r\n\"Your letter of the 9th instant was received, and also a personal\r\nletter from Mr. Belmont.\r\n\r\n\"I am watchful of the course of legislation in Congress and of the\r\ncurrent of public sentiment, both in our own and foreign countries,\r\non the silver question.  I am not prepared at present to give any\r\nassurance as to what will be done in Congress, nor of the action\r\nof the executive department.  It is better to let the matter stand\r\nas it is, awaiting events without any committals whatever.  I have\r\nfaith to believe that all will come our right so far as the public\r\ncredit is affected, and will write you again when anything definite\r\ncan be said.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of November Belmont wrote me a long letter containing\r\nthe following statements:\r\n\r\n\"I need hardly assure you, at this late day, of my earnest solicitude\r\nfor the success of the funding and resumption operations, and of\r\nmy personal deep regret, apart from all pecuniary considerations,\r\nas a member of the syndicate, to see this unfortunate situation of\r\nthe silver question put a complete stop to all further sales of\r\nthe four per cent. bonds at present, here and in England.  The\r\ncapitalists and banks on both sides of the Atlantic will not buy\r\na bond at par _in gold_, when it is almost certain, from the\r\noverwhelming vote in the House, and the known attitude of the\r\nSenate, that a silver bill, making the old silver dollar a legal\r\ntender for all private and public obligations, will pass both Houses\r\nthis winter. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The bonds are selling at ninety-nine and one-fourth in gold in open\r\nmarket, and it seems to me very doubtful policy to offer bonds, by\r\nus, to the public at this moment, and thus assist the advocates of\r\nthe old silver dollar by our apparent indifference to the injustice\r\nand dishonesty of the Bland bill.\"\r\n\r\nThis condition of suspense and anxiety continued during the remainder\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nMy first annual report, as Secretary of the Treasury, was made to\r\nCongress on the 3rd of December, 1877.  The statement made of our\r\nfinancial condition was a very favorable one, showing a surplus\r\nrevenue of $30,340,577.69.  The receipts from different sources of\r\nrevenue were largely diminished, but the expenditures for the year\r\nwere reduced by an equal amount.  The surplus revenue was applied\r\nto the redemption of United States notes and of fractional currency,\r\nand to the payment of six per cent. bonds for the sinking fund.\r\nThe report dealt with the usual topics of such reports, embracing\r\na great variety of subjects.  What attracted the most attention\r\nwas, naturally, what was said about refunding the public debt and\r\nthe resumption of specie payments.  The results of refunding during\r\nthe previous year have already been sufficiently stated.  The plans\r\nfor the resumption of specie payments were fully explained.  The\r\nmode and manner of bringing this about was not specified in the\r\nlaw, but the time for resumption was fixed and the means provided\r\nfor accumulating coin for that purpose were ample.\r\n\r\nBy the resumption act the Secretary of the Treasury was required\r\nto redeem legal tender notes to the amount of eighty per centum of\r\nthe sum of national bank notes issued, and to continue such\r\nredemption, as circulating notes were issued, until there was\r\noutstanding the sum of $300,000,000 of such legal tender United\r\nStates notes, and no more.\r\n\r\nBy the same act it was provided that, on and after the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1879, the Secretary of the Treasury should redeem, in\r\ncoin, the United States legal tender notes then outstanding, on\r\ntheir presentation for redemption at the office of the assistant\r\ntreasurer of the United States, in the city of New York, in sums\r\nof not less than fifty dollars.  \"And,\" it continued, \"to enable\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and provide for the\r\nredemption in this act authorized or required, he is authorized to\r\nuse any surplus revenues, from time to time, in the treasury, not\r\notherwise appropriated, and to issue, sell, and dispose of, at not\r\nless than par, in coin, either of the descriptions of bonds, of\r\nthe United States, described in the act of Congress approved July\r\n14, 1870, entitled 'An act to authorize the refunding of the national\r\ndebt,' with like qualities, privileges, and exemptions, to the\r\nextent necessary to carry this act into full effect, and to use\r\nthe proceeds thereof for the purposes aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this provision I had sold at par, for coin,\r\n$15,000,000 four and a half per cent. bonds, or $5,000,000 during\r\neach of the months of May, June and July, and $25,000,000 at par,\r\nin coin, of four per cent. bonds, or $5,000,000 for each of the\r\nmonths of August, September, October, November and December.  Of\r\nthe coin thus received $4,000,000 had been sold for the redemption\r\nof United States notes, and the residue was in the treasury.  The\r\nsurplus revenue had also, under the same authority, been applied\r\nto the redemption of the residue of United States notes, not redeemed\r\nby the sale of coin, and the balance was held in the treasury in\r\npreparation for resumption.\r\n\r\nThese operations, aided greatly, no doubt, by the favorable condition\r\nof our foreign commerce, had advanced the market value of United\r\nStates notes to ninety-seven and three-eighths per cent., or within\r\nnearly two and a half per cent. of coin.  They had also conclusively\r\ndemonstrated the practicability of restoring United States notes\r\nto par, in coin, by the time fixed by law, and that without disturbing\r\neither domestic or foreign trade or commerce.  Every step had been\r\naccompanied with growing business, with the advance of public\r\ncredit, and the steady appreciation of United States notes.  The\r\nexport of bullion had been arrested, and our domestic supply had\r\naccumulated in the treasury.  The exportation of other domestic\r\nproducts had been largely increased, with great advantage to all\r\nindustries.  I said the course adopted under the resumption act,\r\nif pursued, would probably be followed with like favorable results,\r\nand a sufficient fund for the maintenance of resumption would\r\ndoubtless accumulate in the treasury at or before the date fixed\r\nby law.\r\n\r\nI strongly urged the firm maintenance of a policy that would make\r\ngood the promise contained in the United States note when issued--\r\na promise repeated in the act \"To strengthen the public credit,\"\r\napproved March 18, 1869, and made definite and effective by the\r\nresumption act, and asserted that dishonored notes, less valuable\r\nthan the coin they promise, though justified by the necessity which\r\nled to their issue, should be made good as soon as practicable;\r\nthat the public credit was injured by failure to redeem them; that\r\nevery holder who was compelled by law to receive them was deprived\r\nof a part of his just due; that our national resources being ample,\r\nthe process of appreciation being almost complete, and the wisdom\r\nof the law having been demonstrated, it was the dictate of good\r\npolicy and good faith to continue the process of preparation, so\r\nthat, at or before the time fixed by law, every United States note\r\nwould have equal purchasing power with coin; that to reverse this\r\npolicy in the face of assured success would greatly impair the\r\npublic credit, arrest the process of reducing the interest on the\r\npublic debt, and cause anew the financial distress our country had\r\nrecently suffered.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the resumption act plainly provided for the\r\npermanent substitution of silver coin for the whole amount of\r\nfractional currency outstanding.  Section 3 directed the permanent\r\nreduction of United States notes to an amount not exceeding\r\n$300,000,000.  No distinct legislative declaration was made in the\r\nresumption act that notes redeemed after that limit was reached\r\nshould not be reissued; but section 3579 of the Revised Statutes\r\nof the United States provided that \"when any United States notes\r\nare returned to the treasury they may be reissued, from time to\r\ntime, as the exigencies of the public interest may require.\"\r\n\r\nI expressed in my report the opinion that, under this section,\r\nnotes, when redeemed after the 1st of January, 1879, if the amount\r\noutstanding was not in excess of $300,000,000, might be reissued\r\nas the exigencies of the public service required.  A note redeemed\r\nwith coin was in the treasury and subject to the same law as if\r\nreceived for taxes, or as a bank note, when redeemed by the\r\ncorporation issuing it.  The authority to reissue it did not depend\r\nupon the mode in which it was returned to the treasury.  But this\r\nconstruction was controverted, and I thought should be settled by\r\ndistinct provisions of law.  It should not be open to doubt or\r\ndispute.  The decision of this question by Congress would involve\r\nnot merely the construction of existing law, but the public policy\r\nof maintaining in circulation United States notes, either with or\r\nwithout the legal tender clause.  These notes were of great public\r\nconvenience--they circulated readily; were of universal credit;\r\nwere a debt of the people without interest; were protected by every\r\npossible safeguard against counterfeiting; and, when redeemable in\r\ncoin at the demand of the holder, formed a paper currency as good\r\nas had yet been devised.\r\n\r\nIt was conceded, I said, that a certain amount could, with the aid\r\nof an ample reserve in coin, be always maintained in circulation.\r\nShould not the benefit of this circulation inure to the people,\r\nrather than to corporations, either state or national?  The government\r\nhad ample facility for the collection, custody, and care of the\r\ncoin reserves of the country.  It was a safer custodian of such\r\nreserves than a multitude of scattered banks would be.  The authority\r\nto issue circulating notes by banks was not given to the banks for\r\ntheir benefit, but for the public convenience, and to enable them\r\nto meet the ebb and flow of currency caused by varying crops,\r\nproductions, and seasons.  It was indispensable that a power should\r\nexist somewhere to issue and loan credit money at certain times,\r\nand to redeem it at others.  This function could be performed better\r\nby corporations than by the government.  The government could not\r\nloan money, deal in bills of exchange, or make advances on property.\r\n\r\nI expressed the opinion, that the best currency for the people of\r\nthe United States would be a carefully-limited amount of United\r\nStates notes, promptly redeemable on presentation in coin, supported\r\nby ample reserves of coin, and supplemented by a system of national\r\nbanks, organized under general laws, free and open to all, with\r\npower to issue circulating notes secured by United States bonds,\r\ndeposited with the government and redeemable on demand in United\r\nStates notes or coin.  Such a system would secure to the people a\r\nsafe currency of equal value in all parts of the country, receivable\r\nfor all dues, and easily convertible into coin.  Interest could\r\nthus be saved on so much of the public debt as could be conveniently\r\nmaintained in permanent circulation, leaving to national banks the\r\nproper business of such corporations, of providing currency for\r\nthe varying changes, the ebb and flow of trade.\r\n\r\nI said that the legal tender quality given to United States notes\r\nwas intended to maintain them in forced circulation at a time when\r\ntheir depreciation was inevitable.  When they were redeemable in\r\ncoin this quality might either be withdrawn or retained, without\r\naffecting their use as currency in ordinary times.  But all experience\r\nhad shown that there were periods when, under any system of paper\r\nmoney, however carefully guarded, it was impracticable to maintain\r\nactual coin redemption.  Usually contracts would be based upon\r\ncurrent paper money, and it was just that, during a sudden panic,\r\nor an unreasonable demand for coin, the creditor should not be\r\nallowed to demand payment in other than the currency upon which\r\nthe debt was contracted.  To meet this contingency, it would seem\r\nto be right to maintain the legal tender quality of the United\r\nStates notes.  If they were not at par with coin it was the fault\r\nof the government and not of the debtor, or, rather, it was the\r\nresult of unforseen stringency not contemplated by the contracting\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIn establishing a system of paper money, designed to be permanent,\r\nI said it should be remembered that theretofore no expedient had\r\nbeen devised, either in this or other countries, that in times of\r\npanic or adverse trade had prevented the drain and exhaustion of\r\ncoin reserves, however large or carefully guarded.  Every such\r\nsystem must provide for a suspension of specie payment.  Laws might\r\nforbid or ignore such a contingency, but it would come; and when\r\nit came it could not be resisted, but had to be acknowledged and\r\ndeclared, to prevent unnecessary sacrifice and ruin.  In our free\r\ngovernment the power to make this declaration would not be willingly\r\nintrusted to individuals, but should be determined by events and\r\nconditions known to all.  It would be far better to fix the maximum\r\nof legal tender notes at $300,000,000, supported by a minimum\r\nreserve of $100,000,000, of coin, only to be used for the redemption\r\nof notes, not to be reissued until the reserve was restored.  A\r\ndemand of coin to exhaust such a reserve might not occur, but, if\r\nevents should force it, the fact would be known and could be\r\ndeclared, and would justify a temporary suspension of specie\r\npayments.  Some such expedient could, no doubt, be provided by\r\nCongress for an exceptional emergency.  In other times the general\r\nconfidence in these notes would maintain them at par in coin, and\r\njustify their use as reserves of banks and for the redemption of\r\nbank notes.\r\n\r\nAs to the fractional currency I said the resumption act provided\r\nfor the exchange and substitution of silver coins for such currency.\r\nTo facilitate this exchange, the joint resolution, approved July\r\n22, 1876, provided that such coin should be issued to an amount\r\nnot exceeding $10,000,000, for an equal amount of legal tender\r\nnotes.  It also provided that the aggregate amount of such coin\r\nand fractional currency outstanding should not exceed, at any time,\r\n$50,000,000.  That limit would have been reached if the whole amount\r\nof fractional currency issued and not redeemed, had been held to\r\nbe \"outstanding.\"  It was well known, however, that a very large\r\namount of fractional currency issued had been destroyed, and could\r\nnot be presented for redemption, and could hardly be held to be\r\n\"outstanding.\"  The Treasurer of the United States, the Comptroller\r\nof the Currency, and the Director of the Mint concurred in estimating\r\nthe amount, so lost and destroyed, to be not less than $8,083,513.\r\n\r\nAs it was evident that Congress intended to provide an aggregate\r\nissue of $50,000,000 of such coin and currency in circulation, I\r\ndirected the further issue of silver coin, equal in amount to the\r\ncurrency estimated to have been lost and destroyed.\r\n\r\nI recommended that the limitation upon the amount of such fractional\r\ncoin, to be issued in exchange for United States notes, be repealed.\r\nThe coin was readily taken, was in great favor with the people,\r\nits issue was profitable to the government, and experience had\r\nshown that there was no difficulty in maintaining it at par with\r\nUnited States notes.  The estimated amount of such coin in circulation\r\nin the United States in 1860, at par with gold, was $43,000,000.\r\nGreat Britain, with a population of 32,000,000, maintained an\r\ninferior fractional coin to the amount of $92,463,500, at par with\r\ngold, and other nations maintained a much larger _per capita_\r\namount.  The true limit of such coin was the demand that might be\r\nmade for its issue, and if only issued in exchange for United\r\nStates notes there was no danger of an excess being issued.\r\n\r\nBy the coinage act of 1873, any person might deposit silver bullion\r\nat the mint to be coined into trade dollars of the weight of 420\r\ngrains, troy, upon the payment of the cost of coinage.  This\r\nprovision had been made at a time when such a dollar, worth in the\r\nmarket $1.02-13/100 in gold, was designed for the use of trade in\r\nChina, where silver was the only standard.  By the joint resolution\r\nof July 22, 1876, passed when the trade dollar in market value,\r\nhad fallen greatly below one dollar in gold, it was provided that\r\nit should not be thereafter a legal tender, and the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury was authorized \"to limit the coinage thereof to such\r\nan amount as he may deem sufficient to meet the export demand for\r\nthe same.\"  Under these laws the amount of trade dollars issued,\r\nmainly for exportation, was $30,710,400.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1877, it became apparent that there was no further\r\nexport demand for trade dollars, but deposits of silver bullion\r\nwere made, and such dollars were demanded of the mint for circulation\r\nin the United States, that the owner might secure the difference\r\nbetween the value of such bullion in the market and United States\r\nnotes.  At the time the mints were fully occupied by the issue of\r\nfractional, and other coins, on account of the government.  Therefore,\r\nunder the authority of the law of 1876 referred to, I directed that\r\nno further issues of trade dollars be made until necessary again\r\nto meet an export demand.  In case another silver dollar was\r\nauthorized, I recommended that the trade dollar be discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe question of the issue of a silver dollar for circulation as\r\nmoney had, previous to my report, been discussed and carefully\r\nexamined by a commission organized by Congress, which had recommended\r\nthe coinage of the old silver dollar.  With such legislative\r\nprovisions as would maintain its current value at par with gold,\r\nits issue was recommended by me.  I thought a gold coin of the\r\ndenomination of one dollar was too small for convenient circulation,\r\nwhile such a coin in silver would be convenient for a multitude of\r\ndaily transactions, and in a form to satisfy the natural instinct\r\nof hoarding.\r\n\r\nI discussed the silver question to some length and said that of\r\nthe metals, silver was of the most general use for coinage.  It\r\nwas a part of every system of coinage, even in countries where gold\r\nwas the sole legal standard.  It best measured the common wants of\r\nlife, but, from its weight and bulk, was not a convenient medium\r\nin the larger exchanges of commerce.  Its production was reasonably\r\nsteady in amount.  The relative market value of silver and gold\r\nwas far more stable than that of any other two commodities--still,\r\nit did vary.  It was not in the power of human law to prevent the\r\nvariation.  This inherent difficulty had compelled all nations to\r\nadopt one or the other as the sole standard of value, or to authorize\r\nan alternative standard of the cheaper coin, or to coin both metals\r\nat an arbitrary standard, and to maintain one a par with the other\r\nby limiting the amount and legal tender quality of the cheaper\r\ncoin, and receiving or redeeming it at par with the other.\r\n\r\nIt had been the careful study of statesmen for many years to secure\r\na bimetallic currency not subject to the changes of market value,\r\nand so adjusted that both kinds could be kept in circulation\r\ntogether, not alternating with each other.  The growing tendency\r\nhad been to adopt, for coins, the principle of \"redeemability\"\r\napplied to different forms of paper money.  By limiting tokens,\r\nsilver, and paper money, to the amount needed for business, and\r\npromptly receiving or redeeming all that might at any time be in\r\nexcess, all these forms of money could be kept in circulation, in\r\nlarge amounts, at par with gold.  In this way, tokens of inferior\r\nintrinsic value were readily circulated, and did not depreciate\r\nbelow the paper money into which they were convertible.  The\r\nfractional coin then in circulation, though the silver of which it\r\nwas composed was of less market value than the paper money, passed\r\nreadily among all classes of people and answered all the purposes\r\nfor which it was designed.  And so the silver dollar, if restored\r\nto our coinage, would greatly add to the convenience of the people.\r\nBut this coin should be subject to the same rule, as to issue and\r\nconvertibility, as other forms of money.  If the market value of\r\nthe silver in it was less than that of gold coin of the same\r\ndenomination, and it was issued in unlimited qualities, and made\r\na legal tender for all debts, it would demonetize gold and depreciate\r\nour paper money.\r\n\r\nThe importance of gold as the standard of value was conceded by\r\nall.  Since 1834, it had been practically the sole coin standard\r\nof the United States, and, since 1815, been the sole standard of\r\nGreat Britain.  Germany had recently adopted the same standard.\r\nFrance, and other Latin nations, had suspended the coinage of\r\nsilver, and, it was supposed, would gradually either adopt the sole\r\nstandard of gold, or provide for the convertibility of silver coin,\r\non the demand of the holder, into gold coin.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, several experiments had been made with the\r\nview of retaining both gold and silver in circulation.  The 2nd\r\nCongress undertook to establish the ratio of fifteen of silver to\r\none of gold, with free coinage of both metals.  By this ratio gold\r\nwas under-valued, as one ounce of gold was worth more in the markets\r\nof the world than fifteen ounces of silver, and gold, therefore,\r\nwas exported.  To correct this, in 1837, the ratio was fixed at\r\nsixteen to one, but sixteen ounces of silver were worth, in the\r\nmarket, more than one ounce of gold, so that silver was demonetized.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties in the adjustment of gold and silver coinage\r\nhad been fully considered by Congress, prior to the passage of the\r\nact approved February 21, 1853.  By that act a new, and it was\r\nbelieved a permanent, policy was adopted to secure the simultaneous\r\ncirculation of both silver and gold coins in the United States.\r\nSilver fractional coins were provided for at a ratio of 14.88 in\r\nsilver to one in gold, and were only issued in exchange for gold\r\ncoin.  The right of private parties to deposit silver bullion for\r\nsuch coinage was repealed, and these coins were issued from bullion\r\npurchased by the Treasurer of the Mint, and only upon the account,\r\nand for the profit, of the United States.  The coin was a legal\r\ntender only in payment of debts for all sums not exceeding five\r\ndollars.  Though the silver in this coin was then worth in the\r\nmarket 3.13 cents on the dollar less than gold coin, yet its\r\nconvenience for use in change, its issue by the government only in\r\nexchange for, and its practical convertibility into, gold coin,\r\nmaintained it in circulation at par with gold coin.  If the slight\r\nerror in the ratio of 1792 prevented gold from entering into\r\ncirculation for forty-five years, and the slight error in 1837\r\nbrought gold into circulation and banished silver until 1853, how\r\nmuch more certainly would an error then of nine per cent. cause\r\ngold to be exported and silver to become the sole standard of value?\r\nWas it worth while to travel again the round of errors, when\r\nexperience had demonstrated that both metals could only be maintained\r\nin circulation together by adhering to the policy of 1853?\r\n\r\nThe silver dollar was not mentioned in the act of 1853, but from\r\n1792 until 1874 it was worth more in the market than the gold dollar\r\nprovided for in the act of 1837.  It was not a current coin\r\ncontemplated as being in circulation at the passage of the act of\r\nFebruary 12, 1873.  The whole amount of such dollars, issued prior\r\nto 1853, was $2,553,000.  Subsequent to 1853, and until it was\r\ndropped from our coinage in 1873, the total amount issued was\r\n$5,492,838, and this was almost exclusively for exportation.\r\n\r\nBy the coinage act approved February 12, 1873, fractional silver\r\ncoins were authorized, similar in general character to the coins\r\nof 1853, but with a slight increase in silver in them, to make them\r\nconform exactly to the French coinage, and the old dollar was\r\nreplaced by the trade dollar of 420 grains of standard silver.\r\n\r\nMuch complaint had been made that this was done with the design of\r\ndepriving the people of the privilege of paying their debts in a\r\ncheaper money than gold, but it was manifest that this was an error.\r\nNo one then did or could foresee the subsequent fall in the market\r\nvalue of silver.  The silver dollar was an unknown coin to the\r\npeople, and was not in circulation even on the Pacific slope, where\r\ncoin was in common use.  The trade dollar of 420 grains was\r\nsubstituted for the silver dollar of 412½ grains because it was\r\nbelieved that it was better adapted to supersede the Mexican dollar\r\nin the Chinese trade, and experiment proved this to be true.  Since\r\nthe trade dollar was authorized $30,710,400 had been issued, or\r\nnearly four times the entire issue of old silver dollars since the\r\nfoundation of the government.  Had not the coinage act of 1873\r\npassed, the United States would have been compelled to suspend the\r\nfree coinage of silver dollars, as the Latin nations were, or to\r\naccept silver as the sole coin standard of value.\r\n\r\nSince February, 1873, great changes had occurred in the market\r\nvalue of silver.  Prior to that time the silver in the old dollar\r\nwas worth more than a gold dollar, while it was worth then, in\r\n1877, about 92 cents.  If by law any holder of silver bullion might\r\ndeposit in the mint and demand a full legal tender dollar for every\r\n412½ grains of standard silver deposited, the result would be\r\ninevitable that as soon as the mints could supply the demand the\r\nsilver dollar would, by a financial law as fixed and invariable as\r\nthe law of gravitation, become the only standard of value.  All\r\nforms of paper money would fall to that standard or below it, and\r\ngold would be demonetized and quoted at a premium equal to its\r\nvalue in the markets of the world.  For a time the run to deposit\r\nbullion at the mint would give to silver an artificial value, of\r\nwhich the holders and producers of silver bullion would have the\r\nsole benefit.  The utmost capacity of the mints would be employed\r\nfor years to supply this demand at the cost of, and without profit\r\nto, the people.  The silver dollar would take the place of gold as\r\nrapidly as coined, and be used in the payment of customs duties,\r\ncausing an accumulation of such coins in the treasury.  If used in\r\npaying the interest on the public debt, the grave questions then\r\npresented would arise with public creditors, seriously affecting\r\nthe public credit.\r\n\r\nIt had been urged that the free coinage of silver in the United\r\nStates would restore its market value to that of gold.  Market\r\nvalue was fixed by the world, and not by the United States alone,\r\nand was affected by the whole mass of silver in the world.  As the\r\nenormous and continuous demand for silver in Asia had not prevented\r\nthe fall of silver, it was not likely that the limited demand for\r\nsilver coin in this country, where paper money then was, and would\r\nbe, the chief medium of exchange, would cause any considerable\r\nadvance in its value.  This advance, if any, would be secured by\r\nthe demand for silver bullion for coin, to be issued by and for\r\nthe United States, as well as if it were issued for the benefit of\r\nthe holder of the bullion.  If the financial condition of our\r\ncountry was so grievous that we must at every hazard have a cheaper\r\ndollar, in order to lessen the burden of debts already contracted,\r\nit would be far better, rather than to adopt the single standard\r\nof silver, to boldly reduce the number of grains in the gold dollar,\r\nor to abandon and retrace all efforts to make United States notes\r\nequal to coin.  Either expedient would do greater harm to the public\r\nat large than any possible benefit to debtors.\r\n\r\nThe free coinage of silver would also impair the pledge made of\r\nthe customs duties, by the act of February, 1862, for payment of\r\nthe interest of the public debt.  The policy adhered to of collecting\r\nthese duties in gold coin, had been the chief cause of upholding\r\nand advancing the public credit, and making it possible to lessen\r\nthe burden of interest by the process of refunding.\r\n\r\nIn view of these considerations, I felt it to be my duty to earnestly\r\nurge upon Congress the serious objections to the free coinage of\r\nsilver on such conditions as would demonetize gold, greatly disturb\r\nall the financial operations of the government, suddenly revolutionize\r\nthe basis of our currency, throw upon the government the increased\r\ncost of coinage, arrest the refunding of the public debt, and impair\r\nthe public credit, with no apparent advantage to the people at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nI believed that all the beneficial results hoped for from a liberal\r\nissue of silver coin could be secured by issuing this coin, in\r\npursuance of the general policy of the act of 1853, in exchange\r\nfor United States notes, coined from bullion purchased in the open\r\nmarket, by the United States, and by maintaining it by redemption,\r\nor otherwise, at par with gold coin.  It could be made a legal\r\ntender for such sums and on such contracts as would secure to it\r\nthe most general circulation.  It could be easily redeemed in United\r\nStates notes and gold coin, and only reissued when demanded for\r\npublic convenience.  If the essential quality of redeemability\r\ngiven to the United States notes, bank bills, tokens, fractional\r\ncoins and currency, maintained them at par, how much easier it\r\nwould be to maintain the silver dollar, of intrinsic market value\r\nnearly equal to gold, at par with gold coin, by giving to it the\r\nlike quality of redeemability.  To still further secure a fixed\r\nrelative value of silver and gold, the United States might invite\r\nan international convention of commercial nations.  Even such a\r\nconvention, while it might check the fall of silver, could not\r\nprevent the operation of that higher law which places the market\r\nvalue of silver above human control.  Issued upon the conditions\r\nstated, I was of opinion that the silver dollar would be a great\r\npublic advantage, but that if issued without limit, upon the demand\r\nof the owners of silver bullion, it would be a great public injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nENACTMENT OF THE BLAND-ALLISON SILVER LAW.\r\nAmendments to the Act Reported by the Committee on Finance--Revival\r\nof a Letter Written by Me in 1868--Explained in Letter to Justin\r\nS. Morrill Ten Years Later--Text of the Bland Silver Bill as Amended\r\nby the Senate and Agreed to by the House--Vetoed by President Hayes\r\n--Becomes a Law Notwithstanding His Objections--I Decide to Terminate\r\nthe Existing Contract with the Syndicate--Subscriptions Invited\r\nfor Four per Cent. Bonds--Preparations for Resumption--Interviews\r\nwith Committees of Both Houses--Condition of the Bank of England\r\nas Compared with the United States Treasury--Mr. Buckner Changes\r\nHis Views Somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe President's message supported and strengthened the position\r\ntaken by me both in favor of the policy of resumption and against\r\nthe free coinage of silver provided for in the Bland bill.  The\r\ncomments in the public press, both in the United States and in\r\nEurope, generally sustained the position taken by the President\r\nand myself.  I soon had assurances that the Bland bill would not\r\npass the Senate without radical changes.  Even the House of\r\nRepresentatives, so recently eager to repeal the resumption act,\r\nand so hasty and united for the free coinage of silver, had become\r\nmore conservative and would not have favored either measure without\r\nmaterial changes.  I conversed with Mr. Allison and wrote him the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., December 10, 1877.\r\n\"Hon. W. B. Allison, U. S. Senate.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Permit me to make an earnest appeal to you to so amend\r\nthe silver bill that it will not arrest the refunding of our debt\r\nor prevent the sale of our four per cent. bonds.  I know that upon\r\nyou must mainly rest the responsibility of this measure, and I\r\nbelieve that you would not do anything that you did not think would\r\nadvance the public service, whatever pressure might be brought to\r\nbear upon you.\r\n\r\n\"It is now perfectly certain that unless the customs duties and\r\nthe public debt--as least so much of it as was issued since February,\r\n1873--are excepted, we cannot sell the bonds.  The shock to our\r\ncredit will bring back from abroad United States bonds, and our\r\npeople will then have a chance to buy the existing bonds and we\r\ncannot sell the four per cent. bonds.  This will be a grievous loss\r\nand damage to the administration and to our party, for which we\r\nmust be held responsible.  You know I have been as much in favor\r\nof the silver dollar as anyone, but if it is to be used to raise\r\nthese difficult questions with public creditors, it will be an\r\nunmixed evil.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could impress you as I feel about this matter, and I know\r\nyou would then share in the responsibility, if there is any, in so\r\namending this bill that we can have all that is good out of it\r\nwithout the sure evil that may come from it if it arrests our\r\nfunding and resumption operations.\r\n\r\n  \"With much respect, yours, etc.\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe amendments to the Bland bill proposed by Mr. Allison from the\r\ncommittee on finance, completely revolutionized the measure.  The\r\nSenate committee proposed to strike out these words in the House\r\nbill:\r\n\r\n\"And any owner of silver bullion may deposit the same at any coinage\r\nmint or assay office, to be coined into such dollars, for his\r\nbenefit, upon the same terms and conditions as gold bullion is\r\ndeposited for coinage under existing laws.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to insert the following:\r\n\r\n\"And the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed, out\r\nof any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to purchase,\r\nfrom time to time, at the market price thereof, not less than\r\n$2,000,000 per month, nor more than $4,000,000 per month, and cause\r\nthe same to be coined into such dollars.  And any gain or seigniorage\r\narising from this coinage shall be accounted for and paid into the\r\ntreasury, as provided under existing laws relative to the subsidiary\r\ncoinage:  _Provided_, that the amount of money at any one time\r\ninvested in such silver bullion, exclusive of such resulting coin,\r\nshall not exceed $5,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nThese amendments were agreed to.\r\n\r\nSections two and three of the bill were added by the Senate.  The\r\nbill, as amended, was sent to the House of Representatives, and\r\nthe Senate amendments were agreed to.  The bill as amended was as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\n\"AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE COINAGE OF THE STANDARD SILVER DOLLAR,\r\nAND TO RESTORE ITS LEGAL TENDER CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That there shall\r\nbe coined, at the several mints of the United States, silver dollars\r\nof the weight of four hundred and twelve and a half grains troy of\r\nstandard silver, as provided in the act of January eighteenth,\r\neighteen hundred thirty-seven, on which shall be the devices and\r\nsuperscriptions provided by said act; which coins, together with\r\nall silver dollars heretofore coined by the United States, of like\r\nweight and fineness, shall be a legal tender, at their nominal\r\nvalue, for all debts and dues, public and private, except where\r\notherwise expressly stipulated in the contract.  And the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase, from time\r\nto time, silver bullion, at the market price thereof, not less than\r\ntwo million dollars worth per month, nor more than four million\r\ndollars worth per month, and cause the same to be coined monthly,\r\nas fast as so purchased, into such dollars; and a sum sufficient\r\nto carry out the foregoing provision of this act is hereby appropriated\r\nout of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.  And\r\nany gain or seigniorage arising from this coinage shall be accounted\r\nfor and paid into the treasury, as provided under existing laws\r\nrelative to the subsidiary coinage:  _Provided_, That the amount\r\nof money at any one time invested in such silver bullion, exclusive\r\nof such resulting coin, shall not exceed five million dollars:\r\n_And provided further_, That nothing in this act shall be construed\r\nto authorize the payment in silver of certificates of deposit issued\r\nunder the provisions of section two hundred and fifty-four of the\r\nRevised Statutes.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  That immediately after the passage of this act, the\r\nPresident shall invite the governments of the countries composing\r\nthe Latin union, so-called, and of such other European nations as\r\nhe may deem advisable, to join the United States in a conference\r\nto adopt a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose\r\nof establishing, internationally, the use of bimetallic money, and\r\nsecuring fixity of relative value between those metals; such\r\nconference to be held at such place, in Europe or in the United\r\nStates, at such time within six months, as may be mutually agreed\r\nupon by the executives of the governments joining in the same,\r\nwhenever the governments so invited, or any three of them, shall\r\nhave signified their willingness to unite in the same.\r\n\r\n\"The President shall, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, appoint three commissioners, who shall attend such conference\r\non behalf of the United States, and shall report the doings thereof\r\nto the President, who shall transmit the same to Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Said commissioners shall each receive the sum of two thousand five\r\nhundred dollars and their reasonable expenses, to be approved by\r\nthe Secretary of State; and the amount necessary to pay such\r\ncompensation and expenses is hereby appropriated out of any money\r\nin the treasury not otherwise appropriated.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 3.  That any holder of the coin authorized by this act may\r\ndeposit the same with the treasurer or any assistant treasurer of\r\nthe United States in sums not less than ten dollars, and receive\r\ntherefor certificates of not less than ten dollars each, corresponding\r\nwith the denominations of the United States notes.  The coin\r\ndeposited for or representing the certificates shall be retained\r\nin the treasury for the payment of same upon demand.  Said certificates\r\nshall be receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues, and,\r\nwhen so received, may be reissued.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 4.  All acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions\r\nof this act are hereby repealed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was sent to the President, and was disapproved by him.  His veto\r\nmessage was read in the House on the 28th of February, and upon\r\nthe question whether the bill should pass, the objections of the\r\nPresident notwithstanding, it was adopted by a vote of yeas 196,\r\nnays 73.  It passed the Senate on the same day, by a vote of yeas\r\n46, nays 19, and thus became a law.\r\n\r\nI did not agree with the President in his veto of the bill, for\r\nthe radical changes made in its terms in the Senate had greatly\r\nchanged its effect and tenor.  The provisions authorizing the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to purchase not less than $2,000,000\r\nworth of silver bullion per month, at market price, and to coin it\r\ninto dollars, placed the silver dollars upon the same basis as the\r\nsubsidiary coins, except that the dollar contained a greater number\r\nof grains of silver than a dollar of subsidiary coins, and was a\r\nlegal tender for all debts without limit as to amount.  The provision\r\nthat the gain or seigniorage arising from the coinage should be\r\naccounted for and paid into the treasury, as under the existing\r\nlaws relative to subsidiary coinage, seemed to remove all serious\r\nobjections to the measure.  In view of the strong public sentiment\r\nin favor of the free coinage of the silver dollar, I thought it\r\nbetter to make no objections to the passage of the bill, but I did\r\nnot care to antagonize the wishes of the President.  He honestly\r\nbelieved that it would greatly disturb the public credit to make\r\na legal tender for all amounts, of a dollar, the bullion of which\r\nwas not of equal commercial value to the gold dollar.\r\n\r\nThe provision made directing the President to invite the governments\r\nof the countries composing the Latin Union, and of such other\r\nEuropean countries as he deemed advisable, to unite with the United\r\nStates in adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, has been\r\nmade the basis of several conferences which have ended without any\r\npractical result, and the question of a single or double standard\r\nstill stands open as the great disturbing question of public policy,\r\naffecting alike all commercial countries.\r\n\r\nWhile this measure was pending in the Senate, a casual letter\r\nwritten by me ten years previously was frequently quoted, as evidence\r\nthat I was then in favor of paying the bonds of the United States\r\nwith United States notes, at that date at a large discount in coin.\r\nThe letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate Chamber,}\r\n  \"Washington, March 20, 1868.  }\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I was pleased to receive your letter.  My personal\r\ninterests are the same as yours, but, like you, I do not intend to\r\nbe influenced by them.  My construction of the law is the result\r\nof a careful examination, and I feel quite sure an impartial court\r\nwould confirm it, if the case could be tried before a court.  I\r\nsend you my views, as fully stated in a speech.  Your idea is that\r\nwe propose to repudiate or violate a promise when we offer to redeem\r\nthe 'principal' in 'legal tender.'  I think the bondholder violates\r\nhis promise when he refuses to take the same kind of money he paid\r\nfor the bonds.  If the coin is to be tested by the law, I am right;\r\nif it is to be tested by Jay Cooke's advertisements, I am wrong.\r\nI hate repudiation, or anything like it, but we ought not to be\r\ndeterred from doing what is right by fear of undeserved epithets.\r\nIf, under the law as it now stands, the holder of the 5-20's can\r\nonly be paid in gold, then we are repudiators if we propose to pay\r\notherwise.  If, on the other hand, the bondholder can legally demand\r\nonly the kind of money he paid, he is a repudiator and an extortioner\r\nto demand money more valuable than he gave.\r\n\r\n  \"Your truly,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. A. Mann, Jr., Brooklyn Heights.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, 1878, I wrote the following letter to Senator\r\nJustin S. Morrill, which was read by him in the debate, and, I\r\nthink, was a conclusive answer to the erroneous construction put\r\nupon my letter to Mann:\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 24th inst. is received.  I have\r\nnoticed that my casual letter to Dr. Mann, of the date of March\r\n20, 1868, inclosing a speech made by me, has been frequently used\r\nto prove that I have changed my opinion since that time as to the\r\nright of the United States to pay the principal of the 5-20 bonds\r\nin legal tenders.  This would not be very important, if true, but\r\nit is not true, as I never have changed my opinion as to the\r\ntechnical legal right to redeem the principal of the 5-20 bonds in\r\nlegal tenders, but, as you know and correctly state, have always\r\ninsisted that we could not avail ourselves of this legal right\r\nuntil we complied, in all respects, with the legal and moral\r\nobligations imposed by the legal tender note, to redeem it in coin\r\non demand or to restore the right to convert it into an interest-\r\nbearing government bond.  The grounds of this opinion are very\r\nfully stated in the speech made February 27, 1868, referred to in\r\nthe letter to Dr. Mann, and in a report on the funding bill made\r\nby me from the committee on finance, December 7, 1867.\r\n\r\n\"If my letter is taken in connection with the speech which it\r\ninclosed and to which it expressly referred, it will be perceived\r\nthat my position there is entirely consistent with what it is now,\r\nand time has proven that, if the report of the committee on finance\r\nhad been adopted, we would long since have reached the coin standard,\r\nwith an enormous saving of interest, and without impairing the\r\npublic credit.  My position was, that while the legal tender act\r\nmade United States notes a legal tender for all debts, private and\r\npublic, except for customs duties and interest of the public debt,\r\nyet we could not honestly compel the public creditors to receive\r\nUnited States notes in the payment of bonds until we made good the\r\npledge of the public faith to pay the notes in coin.  That promise\r\nwas printed on the face of the notes when issued, was repeated in\r\nseveral acts of Congress, and was declared valid and obligatory by\r\nthe Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\"From the first issue of the legal tender note, which I heartily\r\nsupported and voted for, I have sought to make it good, to support,\r\nmaintain and advance its value.  It was in the earnest effort to\r\nrestore to the greenback the right to be converted, on the demand\r\nof the holder, into a five per cent. bond and, as soon as practicable,\r\ninto coin, that I made the speech referred to, resisting alike the\r\ndemand of those who wished to exclude United States notes from the\r\noperation of funding and the large class of persons who wished to\r\ncheapen, degrade and ultimately repudiate them.  In all my official\r\nconnection with legislation as to legal tender notes, I have but\r\none act to regret and to apologize for, and that is my acquiescence\r\nin the act of March 3, 1863, which, under the pressure of war and\r\nto promote the sale of bonds, took away from the holders of these\r\nnotes the right to convert them into interest-bearing securities.\r\nThis right might properly have been suspended during the war, but\r\nits repeal was a fatal act, the source and cause of all the financial\r\nevils we have suffered and from which we cannot recover until we\r\nrestore that right or redeem on demand our notes in coin.\r\n\r\n\"The speech referred to, and which I have recently read by reasons\r\nof the reference to it in the letter to Dr. Mann, will clearly show\r\nthat I have not been guilty of inconsistency or a change of opinion\r\n--the most pardonable of all offenses--but then insisted, as I now\r\ninsist, that no discrimination should be made against the note\r\nholder, but that until we are ready to pay him in coin he should\r\nbe allowed, at his option, to convert his money into a bond at par.\r\nUntil then our notes are depreciated by our wrongful act, and we\r\nhave no right to take advantage of our own wrong by forcing upon\r\nthe bondholders the notes we refuse to receive.  This is the precise\r\nprinciple involved in the act to strengthen the public credit,\r\napproved March 18, 1869.  That act did not in any respect change\r\nthe legal and moral obligations of the United States, but expressly\r\nprovides that none of the interest-bearing obligations not already\r\ndue shall be redeemed or paid before maturity, unless at such time\r\nas the United States notes shall be convertible into coin, at the\r\noption of the holder.  And the act further 'solemnly pledges the\r\npublic faith to make provisions, at the earliest practicable period,\r\nfor the redemption of United States notes in coin.'\r\n\r\n\"This is in exact harmony with the position I held when I wrote\r\nthe letter to Dr. Mann and that I now maintain, the primary principle\r\nbeing that the United States notes shall first be brought to par\r\nin coin before they shall be forced upon the public creditor in\r\npayment of his bonds.  This act is the settled law, and whatever\r\nany man's opinions were before it passed, he would assume a grave\r\nresponsibility who would seek to evade its terms, weaken its\r\nauthority or change its provisions.  It has entered into every\r\ncontract made since that time.  It has passed the ordeal of four\r\nCongresses and two elections for Presidents.  It cannot be revoked\r\nwithout public dishonor.  So far as the bondholder is concerned,\r\nit is an executed law.  Over $700,000,000 of bonds have been redeemed\r\nin coin under it, and the civilized world regards all the remainder\r\nas covered by its sanction, and in their faith in it our securities\r\nhave become the second only in the markets of the world.  This law\r\nis not yet quite executed so far as the note holder is concerned.\r\nHis note is not yet quite as good as coin.  Congress has debated\r\never since its passage the best mode to make it good.  The Senate\r\nin 1870 provided, in the third section of the refunding act, as it\r\npassed that body, that these notes might be converted into four\r\nper cent. bonds, but the House would not concur.  Everybody can\r\nnow see that if this had been done these notes would now be at par\r\nin coin.  Other expedients were proposed, and finally the resumption\r\nact was passed, and, if undisturbed, is now on the eve of execution.\r\n\r\n\"The promise made in 1862, and so often repeated, is about to be\r\nfulfilled.  Agitation on collateral questions may delay it, but\r\nthe obligation of public faith, written on the face of every United\r\nStates note and sacredly pledged by the act to strengthen the public\r\ncredit, will give us neither peace nor assured prosperity until it\r\nis fulfilled.  Public opinion may vibrate, and men and parties may\r\narray themselves against the fulfillment of these public promises,\r\nbut in time they will be fulfilled, and I think the sooner the\r\nbetter.  Pardon me for this long answer to your note, but I have\r\nno time to condense it.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nRelief from the fear of the enactment of the Bland bill, and the\r\nlimitation of the amount of silver dollars to be coined, removed\r\nthe great impediment to the sale of four per cent. bonds, for\r\nrefunding purposes, and the progress toward specie payments.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, I had concluded to terminate the existing\r\ncontract with the syndicate, and to make the sales directly through\r\nnational bank depositaries, and the treasury and sub-treasuries of\r\nthe United States.  I therefore gave August Belmont & Co. the\r\nfollowing notice:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, January 14, 1878.\r\n\"Messrs. August Belmont & Co., New York.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--In compliance with the second clause of the contract\r\nbetween the Secretary of the Treasury and yourselves and associates,\r\nof the date of June 9, 1877, for the sale of four per cent. bonds,\r\nI give you notice that from and after the 26th day of January\r\ninstant that contract is terminated.  It is the desire of the\r\nPresident, in which I concur, to open subscriptions in the United\r\nStates to the four per cent. bonds in a different way from that\r\nprovided in our contract, and therefore this notice is given.  I\r\nsincerely hope to have your active co-operation in the new plan,\r\nand am disposed, if you are willing, to continue in substance, by\r\na new contract with you, the sale of these bonds in European markets,\r\nand invite your suggestions to that end.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nI received from them the following answer:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, January 15, 1878.\r\n\"Hon.

Belmont & Co.\"\r\n\r\nNotice was given to Mr. Conant of the termination of the contract,\r\nbut he was advised by me that we would probably agree to the\r\ncontinuance of the syndicate in the European markets.  He had\r\nexpressed to me a fear that a panic would occur about our bonds in\r\nEurope, on account of the anticipated passage of the Bland bill,\r\nbut I was able to assure him that it would not become a law in the\r\nform originally proposed.\r\n\r\nBeing thus free from all existing contracts, I published the\r\nfollowing notice inviting subscriptions to the four per cent. bonds:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,                }\r\n  \"Washington, D.

The check is payable on presentation,\r\nproperly indorsed, at the offices of the treasurer and assistant\r\ntreasurers of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Payments for the bonds may be made in coin to the treasurer of\r\nthe United States at Washington, or the assistant treasurers at\r\nBaltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, New Orleans, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"To promote the convenience of subscribers, the department will\r\nalso receive, in lieu of coin, called bonds of the United States,\r\ncoupons past due or maturing within thirty days, or gold certificates\r\nissued under the act of March 3, 1863, and national banks will be\r\ndesignated as depositaries under the provisions of section 5153,\r\nRevised Statutes of the United States, to receive deposits on\r\naccount of this loan, under regulations to be hereafter prescribed.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of this notice inviting subscriptions to the\r\nfour per cent. bonds, I found that the chief impediment in my way\r\nwas the apparent disposition of both Houses of Congress to require\r\nthe called bonds to be paid in United States notes.  This was not\r\nconfined to any party, for, while the majority of the Democrats of\r\neach House were in favor of such payment, many of the prominent\r\nRepublicans were fully committed to the same policy.  I was requested\r\nby committees of the two Houses, from time to time, to appear before\r\nthem, which, in compliance with the law, I cheerfully did, and\r\nfound that a free and unrestricted statement of what I proposed to\r\ndo was not only beneficial to the public service, but soon induced\r\nCongress not to interfere with my plans for resumption.  My first\r\ninterview was on the 11th of March, 1878, with the committee on\r\ncoinage of the House, of which Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia,\r\nwas chairman.  I was accompanied by H. R. Linderman, Director of\r\nthe Mint.  The notes of the conference were ordered by the House\r\nof Representatives to be printed, and the committee was convinced\r\nof the correctness of the statements in regard to the amount of\r\nactual coin and bullion on hand, and where it was situated, which\r\nhad been previously doubted.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March, I had an interview with the Senate committee\r\non finance, of which Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, was chairman.  I was\r\nexamined at great length and detail as to the preparations for\r\nresumption, and the actual state of the treasury at that time.\r\nThe principal topic discussed was whether the four per cent. bonds\r\ncould be sold, Mr. Bayard being evidently in favor of the substitution\r\nof the four and a half per cents. for the four per cent. bonds I\r\nhad placed on the market.  The question of how to obtain gold coin\r\nand bullion was fully considered in this interview, and here I was\r\nable to convince the committee that a purchase of domestic gold\r\ncoin and bullion would meet all the requirements of the treasury,\r\nand that no necessity existed for the purchase of gold abroad.\r\nThis interview, which covers over twenty printed pages, I believe\r\nentirely satisfied the committee of the expediency of the steps\r\ntaken by me and their probable success.  After this interview I\r\nhad the assistance of the committee of finance, without regard to\r\nparty, in the measures adopted by me.  Mr. Bayard and Mr. Kernan\r\ngave me their hearty support, and Mr. Voorhees made no unfriendly\r\nopposition.  The report of this interview was subsequently published,\r\nand had a good effect upon the popular mind.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important interview was one with the committee on\r\nbanking and currency, of the House of Representatives, of which A.\r\nH. Buckner, of Missouri, was chairman.  A large majority of this\r\ncommittee had reported a bill to repeal the resumption act, and\r\nthe members of the committee of each party were among the most\r\npronounced greenbackers in the House of Representatives.  Perhaps\r\nthe most aggressive was Thomas Ewing, a friend, and by marriage a\r\nrelative of mine, a Member of ability and influence, and thoroughly\r\nsincere in his convictions against the policy of resumption.  I\r\nwas summoned before this committee to answer a series of interrogatories\r\nfurnished me a few days previously, calling for statements as to\r\nthe actual amount of gold and silver belonging to, and in the\r\ncustody of, the treasury department on the 28th of March, where\r\nlocated and what deductions were to be made from it, on account of\r\nactual existing demands against it.  This interview, extending\r\nthrough several days, and covering seventy-three printed pages,\r\nembraced every phase of the financial condition of the United\r\nStates, and the policy of the treasury department in the past and\r\nin the future.  At the end of the first day the principal question\r\nseemed to be whether it was possible that the United States could\r\nresume specie payments and maintain them.  This led to a careful\r\nscrutiny of the amount of gold in the treasury, Mr. Ewing assuming\r\nthat a portion of the amount stated was \"phantom\" gold, and was\r\nreally not available for the purposes of resumption.  I said that\r\nthe United States would be, on the 1st of January, in a better\r\ncondition to resume specie payments than the Bank of England was\r\nto maintain them, and gave my reasons for that opinion.  I saw that\r\nMr. Ewing regarded this statement as an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment I understood that Mr. Ewing said that I was\r\ngrossly in error, and that he would be able to show it by authentic\r\ndocuments as to the condition of the Bank of England.  He said that\r\nI was laboring under delusions, which he would be able to expose\r\nat the next meeting.  When we again met with the full committee\r\npresent, Mr. Ewing said:\r\n\r\n\"I ask your attention to a comparison of the condition of the\r\ntreasury for resumption with the condition of the Bank of England\r\nin 1819 and now, with the Bank of France this year, and with the\r\nbanks of the United States in 1857 and 1861.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied:\r\n\r\n\"When I said the other day that I thought the condition of the\r\ntreasury, on the 1st of January next, would be as good as the Bank\r\nof England, I had not then before the actual figures or tables,\r\nbut only spoke from a general knowledge of the facts.  Since then\r\nI have given the matter a good deal of attention, and now have some\r\ncarefully prepared tables, founded upon late information, giving\r\nthe exact comparison of the condition of the Bank of England, the\r\nBank of France, the Bank of Germany, the Bank of Belgium, the\r\nnational banks, and the treasury.  These tables will show that\r\npretty accurately.\"\r\n\r\nI handed the tables to the committee, and they are printed with\r\nthe report.  I then proceeded to show in detail that while the Bank\r\nof England had notes outstanding to the amount of £38,698,020, it\r\nhad on hand as assets:  Government debt, £11,015,100; other\r\nsecurities, £3,984,900; gold coin and bullion, £23,698,020; that\r\nupon this it was apparent that in the issue department the Bank of\r\nEngland was stronger than the United States; but in the banking\r\ndepartment, the bank was liable for deposits, the most dangerous\r\nform of liability, and various other forms of liability, to the\r\namount of £46,277,277.  To pay these it had government securities,\r\nnotes and other securities and £1,032,773 gold and silver coin, in\r\nall amounting to £46,277,277.  Combining these accounts it was\r\nshown that the demand liabilities on the bank were £54,639,171,\r\nwhile the gold and bullion on hand was only £24,730,793.  Then I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now, in regard to the United States, I have a statement here\r\nshowing the apparent and probable condition of the United States\r\ntreasury on April 1, 1878, and on the 1st of January next.  The\r\nonly difference in these statements is that I add to the present\r\ncondition of the treasury the proposed accumulation of fifty millions\r\nof coin and a substantial payment before that of the fractional\r\ncurrency.  I think it will be practically redeemed before that\r\ntime.  The actual results show the amount of demand liabilities on\r\nApril 1, 1878, against the United States, as $460,527,374, and they\r\nshow the demand resources, including coin and currency, at\r\n$174,324,459, making the percentage of resources to liabilities\r\nthirty-seven.  To show the probable condition of the treasury on\r\nthe 1st of January, 1879, I add the fifty millions of coin and I\r\ntake off the fractional currency, and deducted estimated United\r\nStates notes lost and destroyed, leaving the other items about the\r\nsame.  That would show an aggregate of probable liabilities of\r\n$35,098,400 and probable cash resources of $224,324,459, making\r\nfifty-one per cent. of the demand liabilities.  The ratio of the\r\nBank of England, at this time, is forty-five per cent.; the ratio\r\nof the Bank of France, is sixty-five per cent.; the ratio of the\r\nBank of Germany, is fifty-eight per cent.; and the ratio of the\r\nBank of Belgium, is twenty-five per cent., all based upon the same\r\nfigures.\"\r\n\r\nI gave the statistics as to the condition of the national banks,\r\nshowing their assets and liabilities, that they were not bound to\r\nredeem their notes in gold or silver, but could redeem them in\r\nUnited States notes, of which they had on hand $97,083,248, and\r\nbesides they had deposited in the treasury, as security for their\r\nnotes, an amount of United States bonds ten per cent. greater than\r\nthe entire amount of their circulating notes, and that these bonds\r\nwere worth in the market a large premium in currency.  In addition\r\nto the legal tenders on hand, they had five per cent. of their\r\ncirculation in legal tender notes deposited in the treasury as a\r\nredemption fund, amounting to $15,028,340.  They had also on hand\r\ngold and silver coin and gold certificates amounting to $32,907,750,\r\nmaking a total cash reserve of $145,019,338.  The ratio of their\r\nlegal tender funds to circulation was 48.4; ratio of legal tenders\r\nto circulation and deposits, 15.1.\r\n\r\nIn this interview I explicitly stated to the committee my purpose\r\nto sell bonds, under the resumption act, at the rate of $5,000,000\r\na month, to the aggregate amount of $50,000,000; that I was satisfied\r\nI could make this sale upon favorable terms, and could add to the\r\ncoin then in the treasury the sum of $50,000,000 gold coin, which\r\nI thought sufficient to secure and maintain the parity of our notes\r\nwith coin.  Mr. Ewing inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Where do you expect to get the additional fifty millions of gold\r\nby January 1, 1879?\"\r\n\r\nMy answer was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"You must see that for me to state too closely what I propose to\r\ndo might prevent me from doing what I expect to do, and therefore\r\nI will answer your question just as far as I think you will say I\r\nought to go.  I answer, mainly from the sale of bonds.  Indeed, in\r\nthe present condition of the revenue, we cannot expect much help\r\nfrom surplus revenue, except so far as that surplus revenue may be\r\napplied to the payment of greenbacks and to the redemption of\r\nfractional currency in aid of the sinking fund.  To that extent I\r\nthink we can rely upon revenue enough to retire the United States\r\nnotes redeemed under the resumption act; so that I would say that\r\nwe can get the $50,000,000 of gold additional by the sale of bonds.\r\nAs to the kind of bonds that I would sell, and as to how I would\r\nsell them, etc., I ought not to say anything on that subject at\r\npresent, because you ought to allow me, as an executive officer,\r\nin the exercise of a very delicate discretion, free power to act\r\nas I think right at the moment, holding me responsible for my action\r\nafterward.  As to what bonds I will sell, or where I will sell\r\nthem, or how I will sell them, as that is a discretionary power\r\nleft with the secretary, I ought not to decide that now, but to\r\ndecide it as the case arises.\"\r\n\r\nSome question was made by Mr. Ewing as to the ability to sell bonds,\r\nand he asked:\r\n\r\n\"I understood you to say in your interview with the Senate committee\r\nthat you would have to rely upon the natural currents of trade to\r\nbring gold from aborad; that is, that there cannot be a large sale\r\nof bonds for coin abroad.  Is it on a foreign sale that you are\r\nrelying?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, but on a sale at home.  Perhaps I might as well say\r\nthat if I can get two-thirds of this year's supply of gold and\r\nsilver from our own mines, it will amount to a good deal more that\r\n$50,000,000, so that I do not have to go abroad for gold.  If we\r\ncan keep our own gold and silver from going abroad, it is more than\r\nI want.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buckner inquired:\r\n\r\n\"For this $50,000,000 additional I suppose you rely, to some extent,\r\non the coinage of silver?\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"To some extent; silver and gold we consider the same under the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ewing asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect to pay out the silver dollar coined by you for\r\ncurrent expenses, or only for coin liabilities, or to hoard it for\r\nresumption?\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"I expect to pay it out now only in exchange for gold coin or for\r\nsilver bullion.  I am perfectly free and answer the question fully,\r\nbecause on that point, after consulting with many Members of both\r\nHouses, I have made up my mind what the law requires me to do.  I\r\npropose to issue all the silver dollars that are demanded in exchange\r\nfor gold coin.  That has been going on to some extent; how far I\r\ncannot tell.  Then I propose to use the silver in payment for silver\r\nbullion, which I can do at par in gold.  I then propose to buy all\r\nthe rest of the silver bullion which I need, under the law, with\r\nsilver coin.  As a matter of course, in the current course of\r\nbusiness, some of that silver coin will go into circulation; how\r\nmuch, I do not know.  The more, the better for us.  But most of\r\nit, I take it, will be transferred to the treasury for silver\r\ncertificates (that seems to be the idea of the bill), and those\r\nsilver certificates will come into the treasury in payment of\r\nduties, and in that way, practically, the silver will belong to\r\nthe government again.\"\r\n\r\nSome question arose as to the reissue of treasury notes under the\r\nresumption act.  I expressed my opinion that all notes not in excess\r\nof $300,000,000 could be reissued under existing laws, but as to\r\nwhether notes in excess of $300,000,000 could be reissued was a\r\nquestion which I hoped Congress would settle, that I considered\r\nthe law as doubtful.  Congress did subsequently suspend the retirement\r\nof United States notes at $346,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe sinking fund and many other subjects were embraced in this\r\ninterview, the importance of which would justify a fuller statement\r\nthan I have given, but, as the interview has been published as a\r\npublic document, I do not give further details.  I stated frankly\r\nand explicitly what I intended to do if not interrupted by Congress.\r\nI felt assured, not only from the Senate, but from what I could\r\nlearn from Members of the House, that no material change of existing\r\nlaw would be made to prevent the proposed operations of the treasury\r\ndepartment.  From that time forward I had not the least doubt of\r\nsuccess in preparing for and maintaining resumption, and refunding,\r\nat a lower rate of interest, all the public debt then subject to\r\nredemption.\r\n\r\nI think I entirely satisfied the committee that the government was\r\nnot dealing with shadows, but had undertaken a task which it could\r\neasily accomplish, if not prevented by our common masters, the\r\nCongress of the United States.  It was said of Mr. Buckner that\r\nbefore I appeared before the committee, he regarded me as a visionary\r\nenthusiast, who had undertaken to do what was impossible to be\r\ndone, that after the first day of the examination he came to the\r\nconclusion that I was honest in my belief that resumption was\r\npossible, but he did not believe in my ability to do what was\r\nproposed; at the end of the second day he expressed some doubts of\r\nthe ability to resume, but said that the object aimed at was a good\r\none, and he was not disposed to interfere with the experiment; and\r\non the third day he said he believed I had faith in the success of\r\nresumption, and would not interfere with it, but if I failed I\r\nwould be the \"deadest man politically\" that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nSALE OF BONDS FOR RESUMPTION PURPOSES.\r\nArrangements Begun for the Disposal of $50,000,000 for Gold or\r\nBullion--Interviews with Prominent Bankers in New York--Proposition\r\nin Behalf of the National Banks--Terms of the Contract Made with\r\nthe Syndicate--Public Comment at the Close of the Negotiations--\r\n\"Gath's\" Interview with Me at the Completion of the Sale--Eastern\r\nPress Approves the Contract, While the West Was Either Indifferent\r\nor Opposed to it--Senate Still Discussing the Expediency of Repealing\r\nthe Resumption Act--Letter to Senator Ferry--Violent and Bitter\r\nAnimosity Aroused Against Me--I Am Charged with Corruption--Interview\r\nwith and Reply to Letter of Peter Cooper--Clarkson N. Potter's\r\nCharges.\r\n\r\nThe general results of these interviews, which had a wide circulation\r\nat the time, I believe were beneficial, and at least assured the\r\npublic that a hopeful and determined effort was being made to\r\nadvance United States notes and national bank notes to par with\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nBefore I had these interviews I had determined to sell $50,000,000\r\nbonds at the rate of $5,000,000 a month for gold coin or bullion\r\nfor resumption purposes, and also to press the refunding operations\r\nas rapidly as possible.  I had at my disposal an unlimited amount\r\nof five, four and a half and four per cent. bonds, with authority\r\nto sell either kind to accumulate coin for the maintenance of\r\nresumption, or for the payment of bonds that were at the time\r\nredeemable, bearing a higher rate of interest.  My printed\r\ncorrespondence with banks and bankers shows the advancing value of\r\nthe four and four and a half per cent. bonds.  The most active\r\nagent for the sale of these bonds was the First National Bank of\r\nNew York, which had been the agent of the syndicate, and, though\r\nhaving no privilege or facility that was not extended to all banks\r\nand bankers alike, it evinced the utmost activity, intelligence\r\nand success, and took the lead in the sale of bonds.  The advancing\r\nquotations furnished by it and other banks and bankers satisfied\r\nme that the policy of an open loan, such as was provided for by\r\nthe notice of January 18, 1878, would be successful, if only we\r\ncould have the certainty of coin payments by the 1st of January,\r\n1879.  I knew of the sensitive jealousy between the banks and\r\nbankers and between the old syndicate and prominent and wealthy\r\nfirms who wished to participate in any new syndicate, and were\r\njealous and suspicious of each other.\r\n\r\nOffers were made to me by banks and bankers for special arrangements\r\nfor the purchase of bonds, but I put them all aside until after I\r\nhad written to all the parties a notice substantially similar to\r\nthe following, sent to Belmont & Co.:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, April 5, 1878.\r\n\"Gentlemen:--It is my purpose to be in New York at four o'clock on\r\nMonday afternoon, and I would like, if practicable, to meet the\r\nmembers of the old syndicate at the Fifth Avenue Hotel that evening\r\nat any hour convenient to them, to confer as to the best mode of\r\nobtaining $50,000,000 gold coin or bullion prior to January 1,\r\n1879, for resumption purposes, and to receive from the associates,\r\nor any of them, or from new parties, offers for any of the description\r\nof bonds I am authorized to sell for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I propose to accumulate this coin in either the treasury, the\r\nassay offices, or the public depositaries throughout the United\r\nStates that will comply with the conditions of section 5153 Revised\r\nStatutes.\r\n\r\n\"I will send a similar letter to this to the First National Bank,\r\nand have to request that you will give notice to the other members\r\nof the old syndicate, and, with their consent, to any others you\r\ndesire to participate in the interview.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\r\n\"Messrs. August Belmont & Co., New York.\"\r\n\r\nI sent General Hillhouse the following notice:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, April 5, 1878.\r\n\"Sir:--You will please inform Messrs. H. F. Vail, president National\r\nBank of Commerce; J. D. Vermilye, president Merchants' National\r\nBank; George S. Coe, president American Exchange National Bank; B.\r\nB. Sherman, Mechanics' National Bank, and James Buell, president\r\nImporters and Traders' National Bank, that I desire an interview\r\nwith them at any hour on Tuesday next, at your office, or at such\r\nother places as they may prefer, in respect to the purchase for\r\nthe Treasury for resumption of, say, $50,000,000 gold coin or\r\nbullion, to be delivered monthly and before the 1st of January\r\nnext, either at your office or at the designated depositaries of\r\nthe United States, under section 5153 Revised Statutes, and also,\r\nif practicable, to secure from them a bid for either of three\r\nclasses of bonds described in the refunding act to an amount\r\nsufficient to purchase the coin stated.  These gentlemen are\r\nrespectfully requested to select such others connected with national\r\nbanks as they may agree upon to join in the interview.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\r\n\"General Thomas Hillhouse,\r\n  \"Assistant Treasurer United States, New York.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the negotiation as one of great importance, I was\r\naccompanied to New York by Hon. Charles Devens, Attorney General;\r\nJohn Jay Knox, Comptroller of the Currency; Charles F. Conant,\r\nAssistant Secretary; Daniel Baker, Chief of the Loan Division, and\r\nE. J. Babcock, my Secretary.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April I, with the gentlemen named, had an interview\r\nwith the members of the old syndicate, Messrs. Belmont, Seligman,\r\nBliss, Fabri and Fahnestock.\r\n\r\nI stated that the object of my visit to New York, and of my request\r\nfor an interview with the associates, was to obtain $50,000,000\r\ncoin for resumption purposes, and I would like to sell four per\r\ncent. bonds to that amount.\r\n\r\nMr. Belmont did not think the four per cent. bonds could be sold\r\nthen, and the associates all concurred in the opinion that they\r\nwould prefer making a proposition for the four and a halfs, although\r\nthey were not prepared to make any definite offer.  I said I would\r\nlike to get 103 for the four and a halfs, but the associates said\r\nthey would not consider that at all; they would communicate with\r\nthe Rothschilds and others, and might possibly be able to offer\r\n101; they would come to some conclusion by next day.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, at the National Bank of Commerce, I met the\r\npresidents of the national banks:  Mr. Vail, Commerce; Mr. Vermilye,\r\nMerchants'; Mr. Coe, Merchants' Exchange; Mr. Sherman, Mechanics';\r\nMr. Buell, Importers and Traders'; Mr. Moses Taylor, City; Mr. F.\r\nD. Tappan, Gallatin; Mr. G. G. Williams, Chemical; Mr. F. A. Palmer,\r\nBroadway; Mr. George I. Seney, Metropolitan; Mr. P. C. Calhoun,\r\nFourth National.\r\n\r\nMr. Vail said that this meeting was called at my request, that the\r\ngentlemen present had no information as to the object of the meeting,\r\nand had had no opportunity for consultation; that I would explain\r\nmore fully what I desired.\r\n\r\nI said that I proposed to resume specie payments on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, in accordance with law, and that for this purpose I wished\r\nto get $50,000,000 of gold, and, to accumulate this amount, would\r\nif possible, sell four per cent. bonds.\r\n\r\nMr. Vermilye and Mr. Coe spoke at some length to the effect that\r\nthey were in full accord with me on the subject of resuming specie\r\npayments, and they were willing to co-operate in any way to bring\r\nit about.  They said that although they had not consulted with the\r\nother gentlemen present, they had no doubt they were all agreed\r\nupon this subject.  They thought, however, it would be utterly\r\nuseless to attempt to sell four per cent. bonds, and that as far\r\nas such bonds were concerned there need be no more said.\r\n\r\nI said this being so, I would like to have some propositions for\r\nfour and a halfs.\r\n\r\nMr. Coe said that no definite proposition could be made without\r\nfurther consultation among themselves; that they were willing to\r\nassist to the extent of their power to obtain resumption; that they\r\nwould place themselves at my service in any way I might wish without\r\ncompensation.  He said that he thought an arrangement could be made\r\nby which the national banks could be made my agents in the sale of\r\nbonds.  He thought the banks might take the $50,000,000 of four\r\nand a half per cent. bonds, to be paid for by the 1st of January,\r\nthe government to receive whatever the banks could get for the\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nI invited the gentlemen to confer among themselves, and, if\r\npracticable, make me some definite proposition in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the same day we met the members of the old\r\nsyndicate.  Mr. Belmont read a cable from the Rothschilds offering\r\n101 for $100,000,000 four and a half per cent. bonds, $50,000,000\r\nfor resumption and $50,000,000 for refunding purposes.\r\n\r\nI said I was not prepared to accept, but would give a definite\r\nanswer next day.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I met Mr. Vail, of the National Bank of\r\nCommerce, and Mr. Vermilye, of the Merchants' National Bank, at\r\nthe sub-treasury.\r\n\r\nMr. Vail and Mr. Vermilye submitted a memorandum that if I would\r\nindicate my willingness to receive a proposition for the negotiation\r\nof $50,000,000 four and a half per cent. bonds at par in gold they\r\nwould recommend the national banks to unite in making it.\r\n\r\nI then asked Mr. Vail and Mr. Vermilye whether, if a proposition\r\nwas made to me by bankers of acknowledged credit and responsibility\r\nof 101 for four and a half per cent. bonds, payable in installments\r\nand with the usual option, in their opinion, it was my duty to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nThey both said decidedly, yes; that such an arrangement would be\r\nfar more advantageous than the acceptance of their proposition,\r\nand besides, if they took the bonds, it might impair to some extent\r\ntheir power to render the usual facilities to their commercial\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nThe proposition submitted by Messrs. Vail and Vermilye, in behalf\r\nof the national banks, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If the secretary will intimate his willingness to receive a\r\nproposition from the national banks in New York, Boston, Philadelphia\r\nand Baltimore for the negotiation of fifty millions four and a half\r\nper cent. bonds at par in gold, for resumption purposes, we will\r\nrecommend our associates to unite in making it, with the belief on\r\nour part that it can be accomplished as suggested.  This special\r\nloan to be the only bonds of this character offered, unless the\r\nsame parties have the option on any further sums required.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, on the same day, I again met the members of the syndicate\r\nat the sub-treasury, and said that I would sell only $50,000,000\r\nfour and a half per cent. bonds; that these must be paid for in\r\ngold coin, for resumption purposes; that I would sell them for\r\n101½, allowing one-half of one per cent. commission, the syndicate\r\nto pay all expenses; but before signing the contract wished to\r\ncommunicate with the President.\r\n\r\nThese terms were accepted by the syndicate upon condition that\r\ntheir associates in London would consent, they reserving the right\r\nto cable to London for such consent; and the meeting adjourned\r\nuntil 1:30 o'clock, when, I having received a telegram from the\r\nPresident, the details of the contract were then discussed, and\r\nsignature was delayed for an answer to the cable of the syndicate.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we again met at the sub-treasury, and Mr.\r\nLucke, of Belmont & Co., informed me that the English parties had\r\nauthorized them to close the contract, and it was therefore signed.\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This agreement, entered into the 11th day of April, 1878, between\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, of the first\r\npart, and August Belmont & Co., of New York, on behalf of N. M.\r\nRothschild & Sons, of London, England, and their associates and\r\nthemselves; Drexel, Morgan & Co., of New York, on behalf of J. S.\r\nMorgan & Co., of London, and themselves; J. & W. Seligman & Co.,\r\nof New York, on behalf of Seligman Bros. of London, and themselves;\r\nMorton, Bliss & Co., of New York, on behalf of Morton, Rose & Co.\r\nof London, and themselves; and the First National Bank of the city\r\nof New York, witnesseth:  That said August Belmont & Co., on behalf\r\nof N. M. Rothschild & Sons, and their associates and themselves,\r\nhereby agree to purchase from the Secretary of the Treasury $4,125,000\r\nof the four and one half per cent. bonds of the United States,\r\nissued under the acts of July 14, 1870, January 20, 1871, and\r\nJanuary 14, 1875, and that Drexel, Morgan & Co., on behalf of J.\r\nS. Morgan & Co., and themselves, agree to purchase $1,625,000 of\r\nsaid bonds, and that J. & W. Seligman & Co., on behalf of Seligman\r\nBros., and themselves, agree to purchase $1,625,000 of said bonds,\r\nand that Morton, Bliss & Co., on behalf of Morton, Rose & Co., and\r\nthemselves, agree to purchase $1,625,000 of said bonds, and that\r\nthe First National Bank of the city of New York agrees to purchase\r\n$1,000,000 of said bonds; making a total aggregate of $10,000,000\r\nof said bonds on the terms and conditions following:\r\n\r\n\"First.  The bonds covered by this contract shall be sold for\r\nresumption purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  The parties of the second part shall have the exclusive\r\nright to subscribe in the same proportion of each of the subscribers\r\nfor the remainder of the $50,000,000 of the four and a half per\r\ncent. bonds of the United States authorized to be issued by the\r\nacts of Congress aforesaid; but the amount to be so subscribed\r\nshall not be less than $5,000,000 for each and every month after\r\nthe present month of April.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That the Secretary of the Treasury shall not sell, during\r\nthe continuance of this contract, any bonds other than such as by\r\nact of Congress may be provided to be sold for the payment of the\r\nHalifax or Geneva award, and the four per cent. consols of the\r\nUnited States, and those only for refunding purposes, except by\r\nmutual agreement of the parties hereto.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  The parties of the second part agree to pay for the said\r\nfour and a half per cent. bonds par and one and a half per cent.\r\npremium and interest accrued to the date of the application for\r\nthe delivery of said bonds, in gold coin or matured United States\r\ngold coin coupons, or any of the six per centum 5-20 bonds heretofore\r\ncalled for redemption, or in United States gold certificates of\r\ndeposit issued under the act of March 3, 1873, or in gold coin\r\ncertificates of deposit of authorized designated deposit, and that\r\nhave complied with the law.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  The parties of the second part shall receive in gold coin\r\na commission of half of one per centum on all bonds taken by them\r\nunder this contract, as allowed by the act of July 14, 1870, and\r\nshall assume and defray all expenses which may be incurred in\r\nsending the bonds to London or elsewhere, upon their request, or\r\nby transmitting the bonds, coupons, or coin to the treasury department\r\nat Washington, including all cost of making the exchange.  The\r\nbonds shall also be charged with the cost of preparation and issuing\r\nof the bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth.  No bonds shall be delivered to the parties of the second\r\npart, or either of them, until payment shall have been made in full\r\ntherefor, in accordance with the terms of this contract.\r\n\r\n\"Signed by John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury, J. & W. Seligman\r\n& Co., Morton, Bliss & Co., August Belmont & Co., the First National\r\nBank of New York, Drexel, Morgan & Co.; and by Assistant United\r\nStates Treasurer Thomas Hillhouse and E. J. Babcock, as witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of this contract and the open publicity of the\r\nnegotiation, created quite a sensation in the newspaper press,\r\nwhich presented a medley of praise and censure.  All varieties of\r\nopinion from extravagant flattery to extreme denunciation were\r\nvisited upon me by the editors of papers according to their\r\npreconceived opinions.  I made no effort at secrecy, and no answer\r\nto either praise or blame, but freely contributed any information\r\nin respect to the matter to anyone, whether friendly or otherwise,\r\nwho applied to me.  Perhaps as accurate a statement as any, of my\r\nopinions, was made by George Alfred Townsend, over his _nom de\r\nplume_ of \"Gath,\" in the New York \"Graphic\" of April 12, 1878.  He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"At four o'clock yesterday afternoon John Sherman, the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, was sitting in Parlor No. 1, the ante-room of the\r\nlate Republican national committee, when I followed my card into\r\nhis presence.  'Ah!' he said, rising from an easy chair where he\r\nwas resting, like one recently wearied but now relieved.  'Come\r\nin; it's all over now, and I don't mind telling you about it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it's all over Wall street, and I think opinion was more\r\nfavorable to the syndicate getting the bonds than the bank\r\npresidents.'\r\n\r\n'The representatives of the banks were very polite and well-meaning,'\r\nsaid the secretary.  'I sent word that I was coming to the city\r\nand asked the national banks, as intimately related to the treasury\r\ndepartment, to select persons to meet me.  I also notified the\r\nmembers of the old syndicate that I had some propositions to suggest\r\nto them.'\r\n\r\n'This is your third visit on the general object of resumption?  A\r\nvery eventful visit, isn't it, in the story of our finances?'\r\n\r\n'Well, both my previous visits were important--in May, 1877, when\r\n$200,000,000 of four and a half per cent. bonds were disposed of,\r\nand again last June, when $75,000,000 of the four per cent. bonds\r\nwere subscribed for.  The present visit is probably the last with\r\nsuch an object.  I feel glad and relieved.'\r\n\r\n'You failed to get the bank philosophers to get you the $50,000,000\r\nof gold?'\r\n\r\n'I thought I could see that they did not mean to enter into the\r\nsubscription.  They all said they wanted to see resumption achieved,\r\nand would like to aid it, but spoke of their obligations to their\r\ncommercial customers.  They said too, that they would have to rely\r\non brokers to get the gold and pay commissions for it, and were\r\nafraid it might be run up on them.  One or two, perhaps, expected\r\na more advantageous offer as to rates--indeed, wanted me to pay\r\nthem a commission for selling our bonds at par.  I can excuse them,\r\nbecause they will have to be looking after the redemption of their\r\nown circulation.'\r\n\r\n\"I suggested to the secretary that some of the bank presidents had\r\ndiscouraged resumption or treated it as a figment.\r\n\r\n'When the congressional committee was over here,' he answered,\r\n'there was something said about the advantage of getting priority\r\nin the line on resumption day; but that is nothing.  They were very\r\ncivil, but didn't see the proposition favorably.'\r\n\r\n'Is there any disadvantage in negotiating through the syndicate?'\r\n\r\n'No, there is an advantage in this respect; they sold the higher\r\nbonds abroad, and taking these will also place a part of them there,\r\nfacilitating exchange in commercial settlements and interestedly\r\nmaintaining prices.  A portion of these low bonds ought to locate\r\nin Europe.'\r\n\r\n'Speaking of exchange, Mr. secretary, the idea has been put forward\r\nhere, in the fiscal form, I believe, that a large, round balance\r\nof trade in our favor indicates poverty and collapse.  Is that good\r\npolitical economy?'\r\n\r\n'There are nations,' said the secretary, 'like England, which have\r\nsteady apparent balances of trade against them, yet show a great\r\nprosperity.  But that is only the product of English money invested\r\nin foreign places and colonies; it is an apparent purchase, but\r\nreally their own harvest.  No nation that is greatly in debt, as\r\nwe are, can observe real balances of trade overwhelmingly against\r\nus and not feel alarmed.'\r\n\r\n'Do you expect any opposition from Congress as the reply to this\r\nnegotiation and the near probability of specie payments?'\r\n\r\n'No, I do not think Congress will interfere.  The conservative\r\nelement of the inflation party was appeased by the reissue of\r\n$300,000,000, and the candid way in which their silver legislation\r\nwas carried out.  I do not anticipate that Congress can affect this\r\naction.'\r\n\r\n'May not the surprise of the news that you so readily negotiated\r\nthese bonds and secured your gold, enrage those who have cast their\r\npolitical hopes upon preventing resumption?'\r\n\r\n'I do not see why.  General Ewing and the finance committee were\r\nclearly apprised by me two weeks ago of the exact plan I have\r\nfollowed out.  They questioned me directly, and I told them.  As\r\nno attack has been made upon that programme, I look for no successful\r\nresistance to its performance.'\r\n\r\n'Do you consider the price paid by the syndicate for these bonds\r\nas good?'\r\n\r\n'It was the best that could at present be had.  I wanted them,\r\nfirst, to take $50,000,00 to $100,000,000 of the four per cent.\r\nbonds at 103--bonds that I think preferable in some respects,\r\nparticularly for durable investment.  These gentlemen, however,\r\nthought those bonds not convenient for them for ready sale, and\r\nthey urged that I ought to let them have the four and a half per\r\ncents. at par, as some had been put to the people at that.  I\r\ndesired a premium of three per cent.  They finally met me half way,\r\nand gave one and a half premium.  In short, we get a very little\r\nscant of 103 currency for those bonds, for the syndicate pays over\r\nto us the accrued interest.'\r\n\r\n'You do not anticipate that they will take the $10,000,000 and\r\ndecline the other $40,000,000?'\r\n\r\n'No; I think our economy, industry, exports, production, ready\r\nresources and general physical and political superiority will expand\r\nright onward, and protect everybody who puts faith in our national\r\nsecurities.'\r\n\r\n'How much gold have you absolutely got for resumption to-day?'\r\n\r\n'Seventy-two millions clear net of our own.  I have nearly $140,000,000\r\npresent due, or coming, not counting any liabilities on it.  The\r\n$50,000,000 I have secured to-day will give me, clear of everything,\r\n$120,000,000 of gold, and that is plenty.'\r\n\r\n'Have you read the views of Mr. Musgrave and other bankers, in \"The\r\nGraphic,\" on the theory that you have enough gold now and would\r\nnot have to redeem much with your gold?  I heard a merchant say\r\nthis afternoon that you might not have $5,000,000 put at you!'\r\n\r\n'That is more likely to be the case now,' said Mr. Sherman 'when\r\nI am so well protected.  There might be a dash made at my $72,000,000\r\n--not at my $120,000,000.'\"\r\n\r\nAs a flattering background to his interview Mr. Townsend gave the\r\nfollowing description of myself, which I hope it will not be egotism\r\nto publish.  There were so many descriptions of me of a different\r\ncharacter that I feel at liberty to quote one that was quite\r\nfriendly:\r\n\r\n\"John Sherman, as he sat before me, young looking, his air and\r\nbeard in perfect color, his manners gracious and indicating an easy\r\nspirit not above enjoyment, and manners not abraded by application,\r\nseemed to be a very excellent example to young public men.  His\r\nnature had not been worn out in personal contests, nor his courage\r\nabated by the exercise of discretion and civility.  He was the\r\nearliest and best champion of the Republican party--its first\r\ncandidate for speaker of Congress, its last Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  For twenty years he has been in the national center of\r\nobservation.  He owes to temperance and study, exercise and natural\r\nsense, his present proud position as the principal exponent of the\r\nRepublican party.  Not in the Senate is that party seen at its\r\nbest, but in the executive, where the President's original\r\ndiscrimination is approved by time and events; he chose John Sherman\r\nfirst of the cabinet, and within thirteen months he has concluded\r\nthe last great treaty of the war--peace with the public creditor.\r\nIn our arising commerce and huge balances of trade, we observe\r\nagain 'Sherman's march to the sea.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following statement in regard to the new loan and the national\r\nbanks appeared in the \"Financial Chronicle\" of April 13:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman has shown, in his interviews with the committees of\r\nthe House and Senate, not only his faith in the possibility of\r\nexecuting the resumption act, but also his determination to do it;\r\nand the disclosures of the past few days are the signs of the\r\nprogress he is making.  In fact, the events of the week, culminating\r\nin the successful negotiation with the syndicate bankers of a sale\r\nof four and a half per cent. bonds, practically put at rest all\r\ndoubts with regard to the fact that on or before the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1879, anyone can, on application to the office of the\r\nassistant treasurer in New York, obtain gold or silver for greenbacks,\r\nin sums of not less than fifty dollars.  The terms of the loan are\r\nsubstantially set out in the following, which was posted, shortly\r\nafter one o'clock on Thursday, on the bulletin boards of the sub-\r\ntreasury, the parties composing the syndicate being Drexel, Morgan\r\n& Co., and J. S. Morgan & Co., of London; August Belmont & Co.,\r\nand through them the Rothschilds, of London; Morton, Bliss & Co.;\r\nJ. & W. Seligman, and Seligman Brothers, of London; and the First\r\nNational Bank:\r\n\r\n'The Secretary of the Treasury and the members of the last syndicate\r\nhave entered into an agreement for the sale, for resumption purposes,\r\nof $50,000,000 United States four and a half per centum 15-year\r\nbonds at par and accrued interest, and one and a half per centum\r\npremium in gold coin, $10,000,000 to be subscribed immediately,\r\nand $5,000,000 per month during the balance of the year.  The sale\r\nof four per centum bonds will be continued by the treasury department\r\nas heretofore, upon the terms and conditions of the last circular,\r\nand the proceeds will be applied to the redemption of six per centum\r\n5-20 bonds.'\r\n\r\n\"This certainly will be considered a very favorable negotiation\r\nfor the government.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous letters received at this time, I insert the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  \"Viroqua, Wis.,, April 14, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--We have a Honest Money League started in Chicago, of\r\nwhich you are probably aware.  The secretary is the Hon. Thos. M.\r\nNichol, who aided us so materially in carrying the state last fall.\r\nHe is one of the ablest defenders of honest money that we have in\r\nthe northwest.  Any information you can furnish him will reach the\r\npeople of the northwest.  I see by the dispatches you have completed\r\narrangements whereby you will be able to resume by January 1, 1879.\r\nI hope Congress will have the good sense not to throw any obstacles\r\nin your way.  I used to, when in the army, tell the boys to trust\r\nin General Sherman and keep their powder dry, and now I feel like\r\ntrusting in Secretary Sherman to keep our money honest.  I have no\r\nfears of the result if Congress will let you alone.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n  \"J. M. Rush.\"\r\n\r\nThe eastern press, almost without exception, gave its hearty approval\r\nof the contract made, and the mode and manner of the negotiation.\r\nThe leading papers in New York, including the \"Herald,\" \"Tribune,\"\r\nand \"Times,\" gave full accounts.  In the west, however, where the\r\ngreenback craze or \"heresy,\" as it was commonly called, prevailed,\r\nthe press was either indifferent or opposed to the contract and to\r\nthe object sought.  It is singular how strong the feeling in favor\r\nof an irredeemable paper currency was in many of the western towns\r\nand among the farming people.  United States notes, universally\r\ncalled greenbacks, were so much better as money than the bank notes\r\nwere before the war, that the people were entirely content with\r\nthem, even if they were quoted at a discount in coin.  They were\r\ngood enough for them.  Any movement tending to reduce their number\r\nwas eagerly denounced.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when the negotiation was being made, the Senate\r\nfinance committee was discussing the expediency of agreeing to the\r\nbill repealing the resumption act which had passed the House.  The\r\nindications were that the committee had agreed upon a time when a\r\nfinal vote should be taken upon this bill and that it would be\r\nfavorably reported by a majority of one.  It depended upon the vote\r\nof Mr. Ferry, who was strongly in sympathy with the sentiment in\r\nthe House.  It appeared quite certain that with a favorable report\r\nthe bill would pass.  If passed it would no doubt have been vetoed,\r\nbut the moral effect of its passage would have been to greatly\r\nweaken all measures for redemption.  I had frequent conversations\r\nwith Mr. Ferry and appealed to him as strongly as I could to stand\r\nby his political friends, and for the success of the negotiation.\r\nHe voted against reporting the bill.  I wrote him the following\r\nletter while the matter was still pending:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., May 1, 1878.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--The deep interest I feel in the pending legislation in\r\nCongress, endangering as it does my hope of success in the great\r\nobject of resumption, will be my excuse for appealing to you again,\r\nin the strongest manner, against the mandatory provision that,\r\nunder all circumstances, United States notes shall be receivable\r\nin payment of customs duties.\r\n\r\n\"This provision may defeat the whole of our policy for which we\r\nhave been struggling so long and to which our party is so firmly\r\ncommitted.  Resumption on United States notes can be easily maintained\r\nwith a reasonable reserve and with a certainty that any considerable\r\nrun will be stopped by increased demand for United States notes,\r\nbut there is one essential prerequisite to our ability to resume,\r\nand that is that we must have coin income enough to pay the interest\r\nof the public debt and other current coin demands.  To throw upon\r\nthe treasury the possibility of the necessity of buying coin to\r\npay the interest of the public debt, in addition to buying that\r\nwhich is necessary to maintain resumption on United States notes,\r\nis simply to overload the wagon and break it down at the very start.\r\nOrdinarily the secretary would receive greenbacks for duties (and,\r\ntherefore, I have no objection to the discretionary authority being\r\nconferred upon him), if he can use them also in payment of interest,\r\nbut as we must pay the interest in coin, and the slightest difference\r\nin favor of coin making it certain that demand would be made for\r\nit for interest, we cannot undertake to buy sufficient coin to pay\r\nthe interest in addition to what we would naturally, under like\r\ncircumstances, be required to pay such notes as are presented.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought so much about this, and am so much troubled about\r\nit, that I would feel almost like giving up the ship rather than\r\nto undertake the additional task which the bill as now reported\r\nwould impose upon me.  Surely we are so near the end of our long\r\nstruggle that we ought not to assume a fresh load, and I assure\r\nyou that a mandatory provision requiring the secretary to receive\r\nUnited States notes in payment of customs duties, without regard\r\nto the time and circumstances, is simply a repeal of the resumption\r\nact, and it had better be done openly and directly.  Because we\r\nhave been so fortunate this far in the progress towards resumption\r\nis no reason why we should assume an additional burden.\r\n\r\n\"Please state this to any others who you think would have any\r\nrespect for my opinions, as I do not wish to thrust them upon those\r\nwho would like to thwart them; and, if overruled in this, I trust\r\nyou will make this letter public, for I will not be responsible\r\nfor so serious a change in the whole plan of resumption.  I said\r\nto the committee on finance that if the discretion was conferred\r\nupon me to receive United States notes for duties, I had no doubt\r\nthat I could do so on the 1st of October, but it was not then\r\nsupposed by anyone that such a provision would be mandatory.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. T. W. Ferry, U. S. Senate.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was congratulating myself upon accomplishing an important\r\nwork for the people, I had aroused an animosity more bitter and\r\nviolent than any I ever encountered before or since.  I was charged,\r\ndirectly, by a correspondent of the \"National Republican,\" published\r\nin Washington, with corruption, and that I was interested in and\r\nwould make money through the syndicate.  It was said that I \"came\r\nto the United States Senate several years ago a poor and perhaps\r\na honest man.  To-day he pays taxes on a computed property of over\r\nhalf a million, all made during his senatorial term, on a salary\r\nof $6,000 a year and perquisites.\"  My property at home and in\r\nWashington was discussed by this letter, and the inference was\r\ndrawn that in some way, by corrupt methods, I had made what I\r\npossessed.  It is true that I found many ready defenders, but I\r\ntook no notice of these imputations, knowing that they were entirely\r\nunfounded, for I never, directly or indirectly, derived any advantage\r\nor profit from my public life, except the salary.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was alleged that a sub-committee, consisting of\r\nMessrs. Ewing, Hartzell and Crittenden, had been in correspondence\r\nwith leading bankers, financiers and capitalists, and that information\r\nhad been obtained which led to the conclusion that I had derived\r\nprofit from the negotiation.  It was said that the committee proposed\r\nto interview me upon the subject of my recent syndicate operations,\r\nthat the syndicate would get about a $750,000 commission, which\r\ncould have been saved had outsiders been permitted to buy the bonds,\r\nthat the committee had summoned members of the syndicate and bankers\r\nwho were not admitted into the syndicate, but who wanted to be\r\nallowed to buy bonds without any commission, that the allegation\r\nwas so well supported that a resolution was prepared authorizing\r\nthe committee to investigate, but that this was unnecessary, as\r\nthe resolution authorizing the banking and currency committee to\r\nmake inquiries concerning resumption conferred authority to inquire\r\ninto this matter.  The only sign of the alleged investigation was\r\nan inquiry from Mr. Ewing, which was answered by me as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, April 19, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. Thomas Ewing, Acting Chairman Committee on Banking and\r\n  Currency, House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--In compliance with your request of the 18th instant, I\r\ninclose herewith a copy of the contract recently made with a\r\nsyndicate of New York bankers for the sale of four and a half per\r\ncent. bonds.  The only previous correspondence on this subject was\r\na letter sent to said bankers and one to the presidents of certain\r\nnational banks, copies of which are inclosed.\r\n\r\n\"In response to your question as to the amount of accrued interest\r\nthat will be allowed to the syndicate at each payment on account\r\nof such sales, I have to reply that no accrued interest is paid to\r\nthem, but, as you will see by the fourth paragraph of said contract,\r\nthey are to pay the United States the amount of interest accrued\r\non the bond up to the time of payment for it, in addition to the\r\npremium of one and a half per cent.  The interest on the four and\r\na half per cent. bonds accrued on the 1st of March, and therefore,\r\nthe interest is added from that date to the date of payment for\r\nthe bonds.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of commission to be paid is fixed by law at one-half\r\nof one per cent., but out of this the associates are to pay all\r\nexpenses incurred by them in the sale, and reimburse the United\r\nStates all expenses incurred by it as stated by said contract in\r\nparagraph 5.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nNo further action was taken by the committee on banking and currency.\r\nSubsequently I wrote Mr. Ewing the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"May 21, 1878.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I notice the crazy barkings of Buell in the 'Post'\r\nabout the syndicate, and favors granted to it by me.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to say to you that nothing would please me better than to\r\nhave the banking and currency committee examine into this matter,\r\nand I am quite sure you will be gratified that the result will be\r\nto my credit.\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to dignify this by asking an investigation, but\r\nonly to say to you privately, as a personal friend, that I court,\r\nrather than fear, such an inquiry.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. Thomas Ewing, House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that it was alleged that Mr. Tappan, a New York\r\nbank president, said that he would pay $50,000 to stand at the head\r\nof the line when the government began to pay out gold; that he\r\ncould put in $29,000,000 United States notes held by the New York\r\nbanks and break the government and take out all the gold.  It was\r\nsaid that Mr. Coe, a prominent banker in New York, was asked his\r\nopinion whether I could resume, and that he said:  \"Well, yes, I\r\nwould let the government resume, but it must sell a certain number\r\nof bonds to the banks at such a figure.\"  Sensational reports were\r\nsent out from Washington to discredit the contract lately made with\r\nthe syndicate.  It was reported that the terms were concealed, that\r\nonly ten millions were contracted for, part of which it might be\r\nnecessary to take back, and that the banking and currency committee\r\nhad summoned me to explain the contract.  So far from being true\r\nthe contract itself was printed in all the papers and the utmost\r\npublicity was given to every step taken.\r\n\r\nI had a very friendly acquaintance with Peter Cooper, for whom I\r\nhad the highest respect, but he had fallen into the general ideas\r\nof the greenbackers.  When in New York, early in April, I called\r\nupon him and had a pleasant interview.  Soon after I received from\r\nhim the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, April 18, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--In the brief interview which you did me the honor to\r\ngive me at my house a few days ago, I was impressed with your desire\r\nto give all the information that would throw light upon the financial\r\npolicy of the government, and on the department of which you are\r\nthe executive head.\r\n\r\n\"But we had not the time to discuss fully some of those practical\r\nquestions that involve this financial policy, and I therefore now\r\ntake the liberty, in a more deliberate manner, to ask of you an\r\nanswer to questions, which might throw light upon the public mind\r\non these great interests, and allay the anxiety which pervades the\r\nhearts of our people in reference to their future prospects of\r\nbusiness and employment, and show more clearly how the present\r\npolicy of the government in enforcing 'specie payments' by law and\r\ncarrying out the 'resumption act,' could be attended with any\r\n_wholesome results to the financial interests_ of this country both\r\nin the present and in the future.\r\n\r\n\"First.  Can you resume in the presence of $645,000,000 of legal\r\ntender and bank notes with what gold and silver you may have at\r\nyour command, without an actual shrinkage of this currency, either\r\non the part of the government or of the banks?\r\n\r\n\"Second.  Can 'resumption' be maintained after the law has placed\r\na premium on coin, and virtually demonetized the paper, by rendering\r\nits convertibility compulsory?  In other words, can the present\r\n'par value' of paper and coin be taken as an index that after the\r\nlaw has thrown its whole weight in favor of coin, by making the\r\npaper 'convertible,' the present equilibrium between the two can\r\nstill be maintained?\r\n\r\n\"Third.  In connection with the fact that by purely commercial\r\nlaws, we have already arrived at specie payments, or the par between\r\ncoin and paper money, what good will it do to thrust the further\r\npower of the law on the side of coin?  How can we avoid placing\r\nthe paper at the mercy of those who will have control of the coin\r\n--especially the paper of the national banks, whose chief credit\r\nwill consist in maintaining 'specie payments?'\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  After 'resumption,' how much money will the people have\r\nwith which to transact business, employ labor, enter into new\r\nenterprises, and use 'cash payments' instead of 'inflating credit'\r\nto a ruinous degree, as in times past, under the system of specie\r\npayments, and convertibility by law?\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  It being the duty of Congress to make the necessary and\r\nproper laws for carrying into execution a system of money, weights\r\nand measures as the only means to regulate commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the several states, to provide as far as possible\r\nan 'unfluctuating currency,' a steady measure of prices, how can\r\nyou prevent great and disastrous fluctuations in our 'convertible\r\nmoney' and coin, arising out of the great demands for gold and\r\nsilver that may, at any time, be made upon us from the commercial\r\nrelations of this country with Europe over which the government\r\ncan have no direct control?  With great respect I remain,\r\n\r\n  \"Your obedient servant,\r\n  \"Peter Cooper.\"\r\n\r\nI made the following reply:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 18th inst. is received.  The questions\r\nyou ask me have been, in the main, answered to the committees of\r\nthe two Houses, and I might, perhaps, best reply to your letter by\r\nsending these documents, printed by the order of the respective\r\nHouses; but my sincere respect for you, and desire to allay any\r\ndoubts you may entertain of the success of the present plan of\r\nresumption, induce me to answer your letter as fully as my time\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\n\"As to your first question:\r\n\r\n'Can you resume in the presence of $645,000,000 of legal tender\r\nand bank notes, with what gold and silver you may have at your\r\ncommand, without an actual shrinkage of this currency, either on\r\nthe part of the government or of the banks?'\r\n\r\n\"You must bear in mind that the aggregate amount of legal tender\r\nnotes and bank notes stated by you, may be gradually diminished,\r\nso far as the legal tenders are concerned, to $300,000,000, and by\r\nthe banks to such sum as they find can be maintained at par with\r\nUnited States notes.  But, assuming that the aggregate should be\r\nabout the present amount, and remembering always that the bank\r\nnotes can be redeemed in legal tender notes, and are not required\r\nto be redeemed in coin, I do express the opinion that resumption\r\nin a country like ours can be maintained in the presence of the\r\nexisting volume of circulation; but if this should prove to be too\r\ngreat, the reduction will be gradually of the bank notes, or, if\r\nCongress so direct, of the legal tender notes.\r\n\r\n\"As to your second question:\r\n\r\n'Can resumption be maintained after the law has placed a premium\r\non coin and virtually demonetized the paper, by rendering its\r\n_convertibility compulsory?_  In other words, can the par value of\r\npaper and coin be taken as an index that after the law has thrown\r\nits whole weight in favor of coin, by making paper convertible,\r\nthe present equilibrium between the two can still be maintained?'\r\n\r\n\"I respectfully deny that the law places a premium on coin.  One-\r\nhalf of this circulation is not redeemable in coin at all, but in\r\nlegal tenders; nor does the law fix a premium on coin as against\r\nlegal tenders, but simply requires an equality.  Its convertibility\r\nis not compulsory.  It is upon the demand of the holder.  The holder\r\nis as likely to deposit the coin, if he has it, as to deposit the\r\nnotes for coin.  The currency would rest upon the presumption that\r\nall paper money rests upon, that its use and convenience and\r\nconvertibility will always keep it at par with coin.\r\n\r\n\"To your third question:\r\n\r\n'In connection with the fact that, by purely commercial laws, we\r\nhave already arrived at specie payments, or the par between coin\r\nand paper money, what good will it do the thrust the further power\r\nof the law on the side of coin?  How can we avoid placing the paper\r\nat the mercy of those who will have control of the coin--especially\r\nthe paper of the national banks, whose chief credit will consist\r\nin maintaining specie payments?'\r\n\r\n\"I have simply to say that we have only arrived at our present\r\nposition approaching specie payments by the accumulation of coin\r\nin the treasury and by the gradual and slow reduction of the volume\r\nof notes; and the very measures which have enabled us to reach so\r\nnear the specie standard, are necessary to be continued to enable\r\nus to maintain resumption.  If resumption is desirable, it cannot\r\nbe maintained by a repeal of the law, which requires resumption\r\nand grants the necessary powers to prepare for it and to maintain\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"As to your fourth question:\r\n\r\n'After resumption, how much money will the people have with which\r\nto transact business, employ labor, enter into new enterprises,\r\nand use cash payments instead of inflating credit to a ruinous\r\ndegree, as in times past under the system of specie payments, and\r\nconvertibility by law?'\r\n\r\n\"It is answered, I think, by what I have said in reply to your\r\nfirst question.  We will have the United States notes, the bank\r\nnotes, and coin certificates, both gold and silver, together with\r\nthe gold and silver itself, all in circulation.  The actual amount\r\nof currency in circulation, I think, will be as large in specie\r\ntimes as now, and its equality and convertibility will rather\r\nincrease than prevent the circulation of either.  The depreciation\r\nof paper money is not necessarily caused solely by its excess, but\r\nby the uncertainty of its value and confidence in its redemption.\r\n\r\n\"In reply to your fifth question:\r\n\r\n'It being the duty of Congress to make the necessary and proper\r\nlaws for carrying into execution a system of money, weights and\r\nmeasures, as the only means to regulate commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the several states, to provide as far as possible\r\nan unfluctuating currency, a steady measure of prices, how can you\r\nprevent great and disastrous fluctuations in our convertible money\r\nand coin, arising out of the great demands for gold and silver that\r\nmay at any time be made upon us from the commercial relations of\r\nthe country with Europe, over which the government can have no\r\ndirect control?'\r\n\r\n\"I have only to say that it is undoubtedly the duty of Congress to\r\nprovide for the possible contingencies that would make it necessary\r\nto suspend specie payments, though, as the circumstances which\r\nwould compel suspension are necessarily unforeseen, unknown,\r\ndifficult to be defined or to be provided for, I am not sure but\r\nit is better to leave the question of suspension to the necessities\r\nof the case rather than to legislation which must be founded upon\r\nuncertainty.  When the treasury is actually unable to redeem its\r\nnotes in coin, suspension comes necessarily, but resumption would\r\ncome again from the absolute necessity of currency for our daily\r\nwants, and Congress could provide better in view of the actual\r\nfacts than anticipated facts.\r\n\r\n\"I think the real difficulty that has stood in the way of resumption\r\nis the nightmare of things that have existence only in the brain,\r\nand not in fact.  We can only deal with the current course of events\r\nbased upon probabilities, and cannot provide for unforeseen\r\ncontingencies.\r\n\r\n\"It is my earnest hope that you and gentlemen like you, who I know\r\nare sincere in your convictions, may see your way to trust to the\r\npolicy that is now entered upon, which seeks to provide as much\r\npaper currency as can be maintained at par in coin, and to secure\r\nits active circulation in aid of industry and enterprise.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, with great respect,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1878, the charges against me assumed a different\r\nform, by the adoption, in the House of Representatives, of a preamble\r\nand resolutions offered by Clarkson N. Potter, of New York.  Among\r\nthe recitals of this resolution was a charge that James E. Anderson\r\nand D. A. Weber, supervisors of registration of the parishes of\r\nEast and West Feliciana, falsely protested that the election in\r\nsuch precincts had not been fair and free, and that the returning\r\nboard thereupon falsely and fraudulently excluded the vote of said\r\nprecincts, and the choice of the people was annulled and reversed,\r\nand that such action of said Weber and Anderson was induced or\r\nencouraged by assurances from me.  The charge was based upon the\r\nfollowing letter, alleged to have been written by me:\r\n\r\n  \"New Orleans, November 20, 1876.\r\n\"Messrs. D. A. Weber and James E. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--Your note of even date has just been received.  Neither\r\nMr. Hayes, myself, the gentlemen who accompany me, or the country\r\nat large, can ever forget the obligations under which you will have\r\nplaced us should you stand firm in the position you have taken.\r\nFrom a long and intimate acquaintance with Governor Hayes, I am\r\njustified in assuming the responsibility for promises made, and\r\nwill guarantee that you will be provided for as soon after the 4th\r\nof March as may be practicable, and in such manner as will enable\r\nyou both to leave Louisiana, should you deem it necessary.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe charge was without any foundation whatever, and excited my\r\nresentment.  On the 20th of May I wrote Mr. Potter the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  \"May 20, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. Clarkson N. Potter, House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--I observe that the resolution of the House, under which your\r\ncommittee is organized, singles me out personally by name from\r\namong twenty or more gentlemen who were present, at the request of\r\nPresident Grant, or the chairman of the Democratic national committee,\r\nto attend and witness the action of the returning board upon the\r\npresidential election returns in the State of Louisiana in 1876,\r\nand, in substance, charges that at that election in East Feliciana\r\nparish the Republican vote was withheld and not cast, in pursuance\r\nand execution of a conspiracy by such voters, that in furtherance\r\nof such conspiracy, James E. Anderson, supervisor of registration\r\nin that parish, and D. A. Weber, supervisor of registration in West\r\nFeliciana parish, falsely protested that such election in such\r\nparishes had not been free and fair, and that, therefore, the\r\nreturning board of said state falsely and fraudulently excluded\r\nvotes of such precincts, and 'by means thereof, and of other false\r\nand fraudulent action of said returning board, the choice of the\r\npeople of the state was annulled and reversed, and that such action\r\nby the said Weber and Anderson was induced or encouraged by the\r\nassurances of Hon. John Sherman, now Secretary of the Treasury.'\r\n\r\n\"This resolution requires you to investigate these allegations,\r\nand upon the result of these depends the accusations against me.\r\n\r\n\"First.  That there was a conspiracy among the voters to withhold\r\nand not cast the votes, with a view to make a false charge on the\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  That in point of fact there was a free and fair election\r\nin East and West Feliciana, which was falsely protested and returned\r\nby said Anderson and Weber, by which the votes of those parishes\r\nwere falsely and fraudulently excluded by the returning board.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That the offense of Anderson and Weber was encouraged by\r\nassurances by me.\r\n\r\n\"With the view, therefore, to meet this accusation, which, so far\r\nas it affects me, I declare and know to be absolutely destitute of\r\neven the shadow of truth, I respectfully ask, and now make formal\r\napplication, for leave to be represented before your committee in\r\nthe investigations of all charges affecting me personally.  I tender\r\nand offer to prove that, in point of fact, the election in East\r\nand West Feliciana parishes was governed and controlled by force,\r\nviolence and intimidation so revolting as to excite the common\r\nindignation of all who became conversant with it, and proof was\r\nsubmitted to that effect, not only before the returning board in\r\nevidence contained in ex. doc. No. 2, second session 44th Congress,\r\nbut also in the testimony taken by the committee of the Senate on\r\nprivileges and elections, report No. 701, second session 44th\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\"I will, if allowed, furnish the names of witnesses whom I desire\r\nto examine before you to prove the truth of this statement as to\r\nsaid parishes, and that the protests referred to were true, supported\r\nby the testimony and properly acted upon and sustained by the\r\nreturning board.  To my personal conduct during this examination\r\nI invite your fair and candid scrutiny, with entire confidence that\r\nnot only myself, but my associates of both political parties, acted\r\nhonestly and properly, from a sense of public duty.  I have requested\r\nHon. Samuel Shellabarger to deliver this to you, and I respectfully\r\ndesignate him as the gentleman I would desire, on my part, to be\r\npresent to cross-examine witnesses testifying in relation to charges\r\nagainst me, and who will, as my counsel, tender evidence in proof\r\nof this statement.  The favor of an early answer is requested.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to detail the history of this investigation,\r\nof which so much was said or printed at the time.  It was a partisan\r\ncommittee organized to stir up the controversy that had been settled\r\nby the decision of the electoral commission.  The committee conducted\r\na long and expensive investigation.  The result was that the\r\npretended letter was proven to be a forgery, and that my conduct\r\nduring the sittings of the returning board was shown to have been\r\nthat of a spectator, precisely like that of a score of other so-\r\ncalled visitors, of both political parties.  The investigation\r\nproved to be a radical failure.  The report was not made until\r\nMarch 3, 1879, the last day of the 45th Congress.  No action was\r\ntaken upon it.\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation I specifically denied, under oath, that\r\nI had ever written or signed such a letter.  There was not the\r\nslightest proof, direct or indirect, that I did so.  The majority,\r\nwith great unfairness, instead of frankly stating that they were\r\ndeceived by a forgery, treated it as a matter in doubt.  In their\r\nreport they do not allege or pretend that I wrote or signed such\r\na letter.  The evidence of their own witnesses was conclusive that\r\nit was written by a Mrs. Jenks.\r\n\r\nThe report of the minority of the committee commented with severity\r\nupon the unfairness of the majority, in the following language:\r\n\r\n\"The majority seem to us to have come short of what we had a right\r\nto expect from their candor, when they fail to report explicitly\r\nwhether the testimony on this subject sustains the charge that such\r\na letter as Anderson and Weber testified to was ever written by\r\nthe Hon. John Sherman.  For our part, we report distinctly and\r\nemphatically that it does not, and that the palpable perjuries of\r\nboth the witnesses named justify a feeling of deep disgust that\r\nthey should be treated as capable of creating a serious attack upon\r\nthe character of a man who has borne a high character in the most\r\nresponsible service of the country for five-and-twenty years.\r\n\r\n\"The charge, if it meant anything, was that of corruptly bribing\r\nAnderson and D. A. Weber to perpetrate a fraud in the election\r\nreturns of the Feliciana parishes.\r\n\r\n\"We find nothing in the testimony to show that Mr. Sherman either\r\nknew or believed that any such fraud was committed.  We find abundant\r\nevidence that he believed that the protests against the fairness\r\nof the election were honestly and rightly made.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot follow the majority in their yielding to what we must\r\nbelieve to be a prejudice of party spirit, which has carried then\r\neven to the extent of intimating that the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwas party to the pranks of an eccentric woman who dropped a parcel\r\nof letters to set the local politicians of New Orleans agog--a\r\nwoman who was called before the committee a long time as a witness,\r\nbut who was neither called, examined, nor cross-examined by the\r\nminority, who, however they might share the public amusement at\r\nthe performance, entirely declined to take part in it.\r\n\r\n\"A considerable number of gentlemen who visited New Orleans, either\r\nat the request of President Grant or of the national or local\r\ncampaign committee, were called, and testified as to the purpose\r\nof their visit and their procedure during it.\r\n\r\n\"Adhering to our purpose of leaving the majority to frame issues\r\non which they were willing to proceed in investigating, we did not\r\nseek to examine into the particulars of the conduct of the Democratic\r\nvisitors in Louisiana.  To let the testimony show the original\r\nresolutions of inquiry to be both useless and mischievous, serving\r\nno purpose but the spread of unjust scandal, seemed to us, in view\r\nof all former inquiries in the same direction, the proper course\r\nto pursue.\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. Sherman, Garfield, Hale, Kelley, and others were examined,\r\nand their testimony was compared with that by which it was attempted\r\nto impeach their motives and their conduct.  Their account of their\r\naction is consistent and frank.  They believed that their party\r\nhad rightfully a good claim to the fruits of the election in that\r\nstate.  They also believed that the notorious violence and intimidation\r\nwhich had in former years disgraced that state had been again\r\npracticed in the campaign of 1876.  They approved the action of\r\nthe returning board in deciding, under the powers given them by\r\nlaw, to declare null the pretended elections at precincts and polls\r\nwhere evidence of such interference with the freedom of election\r\nhad occurred.  We do not find that they attempted to control the\r\nboard or to dictate their action.  We do not find that they attempted\r\nto dictate to witnesses or to procure false testimony to place\r\nbefore the board.  We do not find that they were in any way more\r\npartisan or less scrupulous than the similar party of gentlemen\r\nwho then represented the Democratic party.  The attempt to single\r\nout Mr. Sherman for special attack seems to us to have had no\r\noriginal foundation but the testimony of James E. Anderson, and\r\nthe terms in which the majority, in their report, have characterized\r\nthat person, warrant us in declaring our opinion that when the\r\ncharacter of that witness and his testimony were discovered, it\r\nwas the duty of the majority of the committee frankly to abandon\r\ntheir effort to discriminate between Mr. Sherman and the other\r\ngentlemen who were associated with him.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterward I wrote the following letter to E. F. Noyes, then\r\nUnited States minister at Paris, whose name was mentioned in the\r\nresolution of investigation:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., April 1, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 18th ult. is received.\r\n\r\n\"The report of the Potter committee, which you correctly pronounce\r\nto be infamous, was received in silence and was scarcely printed\r\nor noticed in the newspapers of the United States two days after\r\nits presentation to the House.  It was then severely handled by\r\nthe Republican press and treated with silence by the Democratic\r\npress, and now it is not mentioned.  I think that neither of us\r\nshould complain of any injurious result from the Potter investigation;\r\nalthough it was annoying, it was fair and creditable both to the\r\ncommittee and many of the witnesses.  But for the expense and\r\ntrouble of the investigation, I am rather gratified that it occurred,\r\nfor the feeling of the Democratic party, over what they supposed\r\nwas a fraudulent return, would have deepened into conviction, while\r\nthe investigation tended on the while to repel this suspicion.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. E. F. Noyes.\"\r\n\r\nAnother investigation into the conduct of the department was\r\ninaugurated by J. M. Glover, of Missouri, who, on November 6, 1877,\r\nintroduced into the House of Representatives a resolution directing\r\nthe several committees of the House to inquire into the conduct of\r\nthe different branches of the public service coming under their\r\ncharge, and the committees on expenditures in the several departments\r\nto examine into the state of the accounts and expenditures of the\r\nrespective departments submitted to them.  This resolution in\r\nsubstance was adopted January 11, 1878, and Mr. Glover was chairman\r\nof the sub-committee to examine into the conduct of the treasury\r\ndepartment.  He came to the department and every facility was given\r\nhim for examination.  He was allowed experts to aid him in the\r\nwork, and continued the investigation for two years until the close\r\nof the Congress.  His committee incurred much expense, but was\r\nunable to find that any of the public money had been wasted or\r\nlost.  His report, submitted in the closing days of Congress, was\r\nnot ordered to be printed.  Subsequently, on the 15th of April,\r\n1879, after Mr. Glover had ceased to be a Member of the House, a\r\npetition from him was presented asking that his report be printed,\r\nwhich was referred to a committee, but they did not seem to think\r\nthe report of much consequence, as they did not recommend it be\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nThe only financial bill that became a law during that session was\r\nthe following, approved May 31, 1878:\r\n\r\n\"AN ACT TO FORBID THE FURTHER RETIREMENT OF UNITED STATES LEGAL\r\nTENDER NOTES.\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That from and\r\nafter the passage of this act it shall not be lawful for the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, or other officer under him, to cancel\r\nor retire any more of the United States legal tender notes.  And\r\nwhen any of said notes may be redeemed or be received into the\r\ntreasury under any law, from any source whatever, and shall belong\r\nto the United States, they shall not be retired, canceled, or\r\ndestroyed, but they shall be reissued and paid out again and kept\r\nin circulation:  _Provided_, That nothing herein shall prohibit\r\nthe cancellation and destruction of mutilated notes and the issue\r\nof other notes of like denomination in their stead, as now provided\r\nby law.\r\n\r\n\"All acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith are hereby\r\nrepealed.\"\r\n\r\nI recommended the passage of this law, as I believed that the\r\nretirement of the greenbacks pending the preparation for resumption,\r\nby reducing the volume of the currency, really increased the\r\ndifficulties of resumption.\r\n\r\nThe session of Congress closed on the 26th of June, 1878.  During\r\nthe recess the business of the department proceeded in the ordinary\r\nway, without any event to attract attention, but all that happened\r\ntended in the right direction.  The crops were good, confidence\r\nbecame assurance, and all business was substantially based upon\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the sale of four and a half per cent. bonds for\r\nresumption purposes the return of Mr. Conant to London became\r\nnecessary.  His numerous letters advised the department of the\r\ncurrent of financial operations in Europe.  There was some fluctuation\r\nin the relative price of United States notes and coin, chiefly\r\ncaused by our demand for gold and the appearance in the market of\r\nbonds of other countries.  At one period the sale of four and a\r\nhalf per cent. bonds became more rapid than the contract provided\r\nfor, and this rapid accumulation of coin tended to advance its\r\nprice, which I desired to avoid, and, therefore, strictly limited\r\nthe sale of the four and a half per cent. bonds to $5,000,000 a\r\nmonth, thus preventing an unusual demand for coin.  During this\r\nperiod there was a constant effort of banks and bankers, chiefly\r\nin New York, to have some exceptional privilege in the purchase of\r\nfour per cent. bonds.  This was in every case denied.  The published\r\noffer of the sale of these bonds was repeated during every month,\r\nand the terms prescribed were enforced in every instance without\r\nfavor or partiality.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July W. S. Groesbeck, one of the members of the\r\nmonetary commission about to assemble in Europe, applied to the\r\ndepartment for information that would enable the American conferees\r\nto assure the conference that the United States would resume by\r\nthe time fixed, and should therefore be regarded by the conference\r\nas not in a state of suspicion.  I responded to his letter as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,             }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., July 15, 1878.}\r\n\"William S. Groesbeck, Esq., Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 12th instant was received during my\r\ntemporary absence, and I comply with your request with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Accompanying this I send you sundry documents, duly scheduled,\r\nwhich contain in detail the law and my views on the resumption\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Among these papers is a letter from the treasurer of the United\r\nStates, of date July 6, showing the exact coin on hand for all\r\npurposes, a careful examination of which will prove to you our\r\nability to resume at the time fixed by law.\r\n\r\n\"It will be perceived that we have on hand in the treasury coin\r\nenough to cover all our coin liabilities of every name and nature,\r\nand also thirty five per cent. of the aggregate amount of United\r\nStates notes outstanding, with an excess of $2,474,822.  We have\r\nalso $7,139,529 of fractional silver coin, which will be used for\r\ncurrent expenses.\r\n\r\n\"Of the United States notes outstanding, at least sixty millions\r\nare held in the treasury, either as the property of the United\r\nStates or as special funds for purposes prescribed by law, which\r\ncannot readily be diminished.\r\n\r\n\"In addition, the secretary is authorized to sell bonds for the\r\npurchase of coin or bullion, and he may use United States notes\r\nfor the same purpose.  Our revenue, both in coin and currency, is\r\nmore than sufficient to pay all current expenses covered by the\r\nappropriations of Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Considering that the United States notes are scattered over a vast\r\ncountry, are in great favor and demand, and extremely popular, I\r\nfeel entire confidence in the ability of the treasury to resume on\r\nthe 1st of January next, and the leading bankers and brokers of\r\nNew York are of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n\"I know of nothing that can prevent the United States from taking\r\nits place among the specie-paying nations at this time, except the\r\npossible repeal by Congress of the resumption act, and this I do\r\nnot anticipate.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nA SHORT RESPITE FROM OFFICIAL DUTIES.\r\nVisit to Mansfield and Other Points in Ohio--Difficulty of Making\r\na Speech at Toledo--An Attempt to Break up a Meeting that Did Not\r\nSucceed--Various Reports of the Gathering--Good Work of the Cincinnati\r\n\"Enquirer\"--Toledo People Wanted \"More Money\"--Remarks Addressed\r\nto the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce--Visit to Lancaster, the\r\nPlace of My Birth--My Return to Washington--I Begin to Exchange\r\nSilver Dollars for United States Notes--My Authority to Do So Before\r\nJanuary 1 Questioned--The Order is Withdrawn and Some Criticism\r\nFollows--Instructions to the United States Treasurer and Others--\r\nArrangements with New York Clearing House.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of August, 1878, I made a visit to Ohio, first\r\ngoing to Mansfield where I was cordially received.  In the evening\r\nI was serenaded, and after the band had played several times I went\r\nto the steps of the hotel and made a few impromptu remarks, reported\r\nas follows by the local paper:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow Citizens:--I thank you heartily for the courtesy of this\r\nserenade, and especially the members of the band who have favored\r\nus with their excellent music.  I will be here with you but for a\r\nfew days, and welcome with joy the sight of home, and the familiar\r\nfaces and scenes around me.  I do not desire to say anything of\r\npolitics, or of matters upon which we do not agree, but prefer to\r\nmeet you all as old acquaintances and townsmen, having common\r\ninterests and sympathies as to many things as to which we do agree.\r\nAnd I especially congratulate you upon the bountiful harvests,\r\nfruitful orchards and reviving prosperity with which you are blessed.\r\nI will be glad to shake hands with any of you, and to talk with\r\nyou free from all artificial restraints.\"\r\n\r\nI went from Mansfield to Toledo, where I had agreed with the state\r\ncentral committee to make a speech, and where the opposition to\r\nresumption was stronger than in any other city in the state.  Here\r\nthe so-called National party had its origin.  I knew a great many\r\nof the citizens of Toledo and the prevailing feeling on financial\r\ntopics.  I, therefore, carefully prepared a speech, covering all\r\nthe leading questions involved in the campaign, especially all that\r\nrelated to our currency.  The meeting was held August 26, in a\r\nlarge opera house, which would seat 2,500 people.  I found it full\r\nto overflowing.  Every particle of space in the aisles was occupied\r\nand it was estimated that 3,000 people were gathered within its\r\nwalls.  I will give the narrative of a correspondent of the St.\r\nPaul \"Pioneer Press,\" who was an eyewitness of the scenes that\r\nfollowed:\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Sherman was not received with that hearty greeting common\r\nto a man of such prominence at first, while the organization that\r\nhad been picketed in different parts of the hall at once commenced\r\nhissing at the first sight of the tall, slender form of the speaker.\r\nUntil his introduction the emotion was the same, and as soon as he\r\ncommenced to speak he was interrupted with jeers and insults from\r\nwhat Nasby, in his paper, called the 'hoodlums of the city,' who\r\ncame organized and determined to break up the meeting without giving\r\nthe speaker a chance to be heard, by shouting at the top of their\r\nvoices such insults as 'You are responsible for all the failures\r\nin the country;' 'You work to the interest of the capitalist;'\r\n'Capitalists own you, John Sherman, and you rob the poor widows\r\nand orphans to make them rich;' 'How about stealing a President;'\r\n'Why don't you redeem the trade dollar?'\r\n\r\n\"These, with many other like flaunting sneers, were constantly\r\nindulged in by the disorderly element, which had been distributed\r\nwith care throughout the hall.  So boisterous and moblike was their\r\nbehavior that it was apparent several times that it would be\r\nimpossible to maintain order, and notwithstanding the speaker stated\r\nthat if any gentlemen wished to ask any question, upon any point\r\nthat he might discuss, in their order, he would be glad to answer\r\nthem, and invited criticisms, but one such question was asked by\r\nMr. F. J. Scott, one of the leading lights of the Nationals, who\r\nwished to know the difference between 'fiat' money and greenbacks;\r\nthe speaker replied:  'Fiat money is redeemable nowhere, payable\r\nnowhere, for no amount without security, at no time, and without\r\na fixed value; while greenbacks are redeemable in specie at par,\r\nat a fixed time, and secured by the pledge of the government.'\r\n\r\n\"By this ready, pointed and satisfactory answer the speaker turned\r\nthe tide, and the applause was hearty in his favor.  When answering\r\nJudge Thurman the speaker alluded to the charge made by him that\r\nthe 'Republican party was the enemy of the country.'  Then, after\r\ncalling attention to the war record of the Democratic party, the\r\nspeaker said:  'Who is the enemy of the country?'  [A voice from\r\na 'hoodlum,' 'John Sherman.']  'Why,' says the speaker; 'because\r\nhe has brought greenbacks up to par value, and is in favor of honest\r\nmoney?'  This was another cause for an outburst of applause and\r\napproval to the speaker, although it was very doubtful, in the\r\nbeginning of the speech, whether he could carry enough of the vast\r\naudience, with the large disturbing element opposing intermingled\r\namong them, with him.  But long before the closing of his discourse\r\nit became apparent that John Sherman is able to defend his position,\r\neven in the camp of the enemy, while the ungentlemanly acts of the\r\ndisorganizing element were disgusting to the better element of\r\ntheir party.  It also effectively revived the lukewarm Republicans\r\nin this community, and it may be well said that John Sherman did\r\nwhat no other man could have done, that is, to go to a place like\r\nToledo, stand before an organized party which was determined to\r\nprevent his speaking, while his own party was lukewarm toward him\r\n--it was frequently asserted here 'John Sherman had not a single\r\nfriend in the city'--and during his speech of two hours turn the\r\npopular tide in his favor, as was evident he did from the hearty\r\napplause he received as he proceeded in his remarks; and it is safe\r\nto say that no man in these United States could have done the\r\nRepublican cause, in this place, the good that Secretary Sherman\r\ndid by his speech, and the 'Toledo National hoodlums,' in their\r\nefforts to break up the meeting, 'gave the old man a reception,'\r\nas was remarked on the streets; but throughout his speech he kept\r\nhis temper, kept cool and considerate, made remarks of cheer by\r\nsaying, 'This is only a love feast,' and 'We will feel better\r\nnatured after a while, as we become better acquainted,' etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrative given by the correspondent is perhaps a little\r\nexaggerated, but the general outlines are correct, as I very\r\ndistinctly remember.  The result was that my carefully prepared\r\nspeech was knocked into \"pi,\" and I had to depend upon the resources\r\nof the moment to make a speech suitable to the occasion and the\r\ncrowd.  The Cincinnati \"Enquirer,\" to which, as to other papers,\r\na copy of the prepared address had been sent, had two stenographers\r\nin Toledo to report the speech as made and telegraph it to the\r\npaper.  They did so and the speech as reported and published in\r\nthe \"Enquirer\" was so much more sensational and better than the\r\nprepared speech that it was selected by the Republican state\r\ncommittee for publication as a campaign document.  This enterprise\r\nof an unfriendly newspaper resulted to my advantage rather than my\r\ndetriment, for on account of the interruptions the speech reported\r\nwas much more readable than the other.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the feeling in Toledo grew out of the long depression that\r\nfollowed the panic of 1873, that for a time arrested the growth\r\nand progress of that thriving and prosperous city.  The people\r\nwanted more money, and I was doing all I could, not only to increase\r\nthe volume of money by adding coin to our circulation, but to give\r\nit value and stability.  I have spoken in Toledo nearly every year\r\nsince, and have always been treated with courtesy and kindness,\r\nand many of my best friends now in Toledo are among those who joined\r\nin interrupting me, and especially their leader, Mr. Scott.\r\n\r\nFrom Toledo I went to Cincinnati.  I have been for many years an\r\nhonorary member of the Chamber of Commerce of Cincinnati, a body\r\nof business men as intelligent and enterprising as can be found\r\nanywhere.  It has been my habit to meet them once a year and to\r\nmake a short speech.  This I did on August 28.  The \"Gazette\"\r\nreported my visit as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Sherman was on 'change yesterday, and, at the close of\r\nthe business hour, he was introduced by President Hartwell, and\r\nwas greeted with applause, after which he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen:--It gives me pleasure to meet so many of the active\r\nbusiness men of Cincinnati, even for a brief period.  In the office\r\nwhich I hold I have a great deal to do with merchants, like these\r\nengaged in the exchange of the products of our industries, and I\r\ncongratulate you, first of all, that this fall, by the bounty of\r\nDivine Providence, you will have to market the largest crop we have\r\never gathered in this country since the world was born.\r\n\r\n'In every part of our country, with but few exceptions, and only\r\nas to certain crops, are crops greater than ever before, and you\r\nwill have to buy and sell them.\r\n\r\n'The only point of an unpleasant nature, that occurs to me, affecting\r\nthe industrial interests which you so largely represent, is the\r\nmisfortune which has befallen large portions of the south, where\r\nyellow fever, one of the worst enemies of human life, now has spread\r\na pall of distress among our southern brethren.  I am glad, fellow-\r\ncitizens, that you are doing something to contribute to the relief\r\nof their sufferings, because business men, above all others, are\r\nto be humane and generous to those who are in distress.\r\n\r\n'That this will, to some extent, affect the business of gathering\r\ncotton, I have no doubt will occur to you all, but you can only\r\nhope that it will be but a brief season until the frost will\r\ndissipate the distress of the south and the cotton crop may be\r\nsafely gathered.\r\n\r\n'There is another thing I can congratulate you upon as business\r\nmen, that is--our currency is soon to be based upon the solid money\r\nof the world.  I do not want to talk politics to you, and I do not\r\nintend to do so, but I suppose it is the common desire of all men\r\nengaged in business to have a stable, certain standard of value,\r\nand although you and I may differ as to the best means of obtaining\r\nit, and as to whether the means that have been adopted have been\r\nthe proper means, yet I believe the merchants of Cincinnati desire\r\nthat their money shall be as good as the money of any country with\r\nwhich we trade.  And that, I think, will soon be accomplished.\r\n\r\n'Now, gentlemen, I do not know that there is any other topic on\r\nwhich you desire to hear from me.  I take a hopeful view of our\r\nbusiness affairs.  I think all the signs of the times are hopeful.\r\nI think it a hopeful fact that, after this week, there will be an\r\nend of bankruptcies, that all men who believe that they are not in\r\na condition to pay their debts will have taken the benefit of the\r\nlaw provided for their relief, and, after Saturday next, we will\r\nall stand upon a better basis--on the basis of our property and\r\nour deserved credit.\r\n\r\n'It has been the habit, you know, of one of your able and influential\r\njournals to charge me with all the bankruptcies of the country.\r\nIf a grocer could not sell goods enough to pay expenses, and a\r\nsaloon keeper could not sell beer enough to get rich, and took the\r\nshort way of paying his debts, this paper would announce the fact\r\nthat he had \"Shermanized.\"  [Laughter.]  And if a bank was robbed,\r\nor the cashier gobbled the money in the safe and left for parts\r\nunknown, this able editor announced that the bank had \"Shermanized.\"\r\nAnd thus this paper contributed largely to the very result it\r\ndenounced.  You understand how this thing works.\r\n\r\n'But we have passed through this severe crisis.  It has been common\r\nin all countries and all states that carry on extensive commercial\r\ntransactions with each other.  I believe that we are through with\r\nthis one; a ray of hope has dawned on us, and we are certainly\r\nentering upon a career of prosperity.  Every sign of business is\r\nhopeful.  We have paid off immense amount of our debts.  We do not\r\nowe Europe anything of consequence.  We have gone through the debt\r\npaying process.  A few years ago we were running in debt at the\r\nrate of $100,000,000 a year, but lately we have been paying off\r\nour debt at the rate of $100,000,000 a year.  From this time on we\r\nwill be more prosperous.  Take heart, you men of Cincinnati; you\r\nmen who represent the great interests in this great city; you who\r\nlive in the heart of the great west, take heart in the transaction\r\nof your business, because I believe you have reached a solid basis\r\nupon which to conduct your business profitably, the basis of solid\r\ncoin.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom Cincinnati I went to Lancaster, the place of my birth, and\r\nwhere my eldest sister, Mrs. Reese, resides.  I need not say that\r\nthe visit was a pleasant one, for it was necessarily so.  A great\r\nmany among those whom I saw had been my associates in boyhood, and,\r\nas a matter of course, the topics of conversation were mainly of\r\nthe past.  A dispatch to the Cincinnati \"Gazette\" of the date of\r\nAugust 30, briefly describes my visit and gives the substance of\r\na few remarks I was called upon to make by an impromptu gathering\r\nin the evening at the residence of my sister:\r\n\r\n\"The Lancaster band serenaded Secretary John Sherman this evening,\r\nat the residence of his sister, Mrs. General Reese.  A very large\r\ncrowd assembled on the occasion, and, in response, Senator Sherman\r\nmade one of the neatest, pleasantest, and most satisfactory little\r\ntalks heard here for many a day.  Of course he began by touching\r\nupon his early boyhood, and some of the incidents of the same spent\r\nhere in old Lancaster, the place of his nativity; told of his\r\nincipient struggles in life with the rod and chain on an engineer\r\ncorps in the Muskingum valley; how he was ushered into the sterner\r\nvicissitudes of life, and how he drifted into politics; and then,\r\nwithout using the occasion for party purposes, without making a\r\npolitical speech, he explained in well selected language his position\r\nas an officer of the government; what was the course prescribed\r\nfor him to do, how he was doing it, and concluding with a most\r\nclear and intelligible exegesis of the resumption act; what it was,\r\nits intent, purpose and meaning; and with convincing nicety and\r\nclearness, and evident satisfactoriness, was his explanation given,\r\nthat he was frequently interrupted by spontaneous applause from\r\nthe crowd.  He told how the credit of the country was advancing as\r\nwe near the solid foundation of hard money; how the American people\r\nwere the most favored, the greatest blest, the freest and most\r\nprosperous people on the earth; how the signs of the times in busy\r\nshops and abounding field told of the disappearing hard times, and\r\nthe dawning of an era of greater peace and prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to Washington, and at once proceeded to arrange with\r\nthe treasurer and assistant treasurers of the United States to make\r\nthe change from currency to coin easy.  I conferred with General\r\nHillhouse, assistant treasurer at New York, upon the subject and\r\nhad his opinions verbally and in writing.  I conferred freely with\r\nJames Gilfillan, treasurer of the United States, and, as a result\r\nof these conferences, on the 3rd of September, I directed the\r\ntreasurer of the United States, upon the receipt by him, from any\r\nperson, of a certificate, issued by any assistant treasurer, designed\r\ndepositary, or national bank designated as a public depositary of\r\nthe United States, stating that a deposit of currency had been made\r\nto his credit in general account of the sum of one thousand dollars,\r\nand any multiple thereof, not exceeding ten thousand dollars, to\r\ncause a shipment to be made, from some mint of the United States\r\nto the person in whose name the certificate was issued, of a like\r\namount of standard silver dollars, the expense of transportation\r\nto be paid by the mint.\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of this order was to facilitate the circulation\r\nof standard silver dollars for all purposes as currency, but not\r\nto issue them so as to be used directly in making those payments\r\nto the government which were required to be made in coin.  I wished\r\nto avoid their deposit for silver certificates.  Officers receiving\r\ndeposits of currency were expected, as far as practicable, to see\r\nthat the silver dollars were put in circulation.  Shipments, however,\r\nwere to be made only to points in the United States reached through\r\nthe established express lines by continuous railway or steamboat\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nI regarded this as practically the resumption of specie payments\r\nin silver dollars, but the chief object aimed at was to secure a\r\ngeneral distribution of these dollars throughout the United States,\r\nto the extent of the demand for them, without forcing them into\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hillhouse recommended the payment of silver for all purposes,\r\nnot only for circulation, but for the payment of bonds and customs\r\nduties.  This I fully considered, but thought it best for the\r\npresent to get into ordinary circulation among the people, in points\r\nremote from the ports of entry, as much silver coin as practicable,\r\nbefore offering it freely in cities where it would be immediately\r\nused for customs duties.  I said:  \"If, within a month or so, we\r\nare able to reduce our stock of silver to five or six millions, I\r\nshould not hesitate a moment to offer it then freely in New York\r\nand elsewhere, and run the risk of doing without gold revenue for\r\nawhile.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 7 I issued the following order:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, September 7, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. James Gilfillan, Treasurer of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--On and after the 16th day of this month you are authorized,\r\nat the treasury in Washington, and at the several sub-treasuries\r\nin the United States, to exchange standard silver dollars for United\r\nStates notes.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was raised in the public prints, and in the department,\r\nwhether I had legal authority, under the existing laws, to pay\r\nsilver dollars in exchange for United States notes before the 1st\r\nof January.  It was plausibly urged that the payment of this coin\r\nin advance of the time fixed for resumption was the exercise of\r\nauthority not authorized by law.  I, therefore, on the 13th day of\r\nSeptember, three days before the previous order would take effect,\r\ndirected the treasurer of the United States as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, September 13, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. James Gilfillan, Treasurer United States.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--Some question has been made whether the issue of silver\r\ndollars in exchange for United States notes, before January 1,\r\nnext, is in entire accordance with the legislation of Congress\r\nbearing on the subject, and, therefore, you will please postpone\r\nthe execution of department order of the 3rd instant until further\r\ninstructions, and withhold from transmission to assistant treasurers\r\nthe order of the 7th.\r\n\r\n\"Silver dollars will be issued as heretofore, in the purchase of\r\nsilver bullion, in payment of coin liabilities, and in the mode\r\npointed out in your order of July 19, as modified.\r\n\r\n\"With a view to their payment on current liabilities, you will\r\nrequest that each disbursing officer estimate the amount he can\r\nconveniently disburse.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThis change of my opinion was the subject of much criticism in the\r\npublic prints.  Some complained that I was unfriendly to the silver\r\ndollar and sought to prevent its use, and others complained that\r\nits use before the 1st of January as a substitute for gold coin\r\nwas a violation of the law.  My only purpose was to accustom the\r\npeople to the use of the silver dollar in the interior of the\r\ncountry at places where it could not be used in the payment of\r\ncustoms duties.  These could only be paid in coin, and, in view of\r\nresumption, I desired to strengthen the treasury as much as possible\r\nby the receipt of gold coin.  The charge that I was guilty of\r\nchanging my mind did not disturb me when I was convinced that I\r\nhad exceeded my authority in the issue of the first order.\r\n\r\nAt that time there was an evident reluctance to pay coin into the\r\ntreasury for four per cent. bonds sold, when, within a brief period,\r\nUnited States notes could be paid for such bonds.  I therefore\r\ndirected the treasurer of the United States:  \"Where deposits with\r\nnational banks on account of subscriptions to the four per cent.\r\nloan have not been paid into the treasury within ninety days after\r\nthe deposit was made, you will at once draw for the amount of such\r\ndeposits, to be forthwith paid into the treasury, and as such\r\ndeposits accrue under this rule, you will make such withdrawals\r\nuntil the whole is paid.\"\r\n\r\nI also directed the chief of the loan division as follows:\r\n\r\n\"No doubt most of the depositaries will place coin to their credit\r\nwithin the period of the call outstanding after subscriptions are\r\nmade, according to the circular of the 1st ultimo, but if this is\r\nnot done, the deposit must be withdrawn at the expiration of ninety\r\ndays from the date of subscription.\"\r\n\r\nI also advised August Belmont & Co., that the department expected\r\nthat by the 1st of October the remainder of the coin then due upon\r\nthe four and a half per cent. bonds, both from the American sales\r\nand those made in London, would be paid into the treasury; that it\r\nwas deemed best that this should be done, so that the account of\r\nthis loan might be closed as soon thereafter as the books could be\r\nmade up.  This request was promptly complied with.\r\n\r\nEarly in October there were many rumors in circulation charging\r\nthat prominent capitalists and speculators were combining to defeat\r\nresumption.  Among them Jay Gould was mentioned as being actively\r\nengaged in \"bearing\" the market.  About this period I received from\r\nhim the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"578 Fifth Avenue, Oct. 17, 1878.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Referring to recent newspaper statements that I have\r\nbeen interested in movements either to tighten money or create a\r\nscarcity of gold and thus interfere with natural and early resumption,\r\nI beg to say that they are without the slightest foundation.  On\r\nthe contrary I feel a very deep interest in your efforts, so far\r\neminently successful in carrying the country to a successful\r\nresumption.\r\n\r\n\"_If resumption is made a real success it will be accompanied with\r\nsubstantial business prosperity and do more to strengthen and retain\r\nthe ascendency of the Republican party than any and all other\r\nreasons_.\r\n\r\n\"The real causes of the recent disturbances in the money market\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n\"First.  Government bonds have come back from Europe faster than\r\ninvestment orders would absorb them--the surplus are carried on\r\ncall loans and have absorbed several millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  The financial troubles in England are retarding the rapid\r\nmovement of western produce.  The elevators at Chicago and Milwaukee\r\nare full of grain; at Chicago alone about 7,000,000 bushels.  The\r\ncurrency sent west to pay for this grain will not be released until\r\nthe grain is marketed.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  A large amount of foreign capital usually lent on call in\r\nWall street has been transferred to London and Liverpool as money\r\ncommands (or has until recently) better rates there than in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n  \"I remain, yours very truly,\r\n  \"Jay Gould.\"\r\n\r\nThe purchase of four per cent. bonds sensibly increased in October.\r\nAs the six per cent. bonds could not be paid within ninety days\r\nafter the call, the purchasers of the four per cent. bonds claimed\r\nthe right to pay for such bonds in United States notes, which on\r\nthe 1st of January would be redeemable in coin.  To this I replied\r\nthat as the sale of four per cent. bonds was solely for the purpose\r\nof refunding the six per cent. bonds, the proceeds of the sale must\r\nbe such as could be lawfully paid for called bonds.  \"Under existing\r\nlaw the treasury is required to and will redeem in coin, on and\r\nafter January 1, 1879, United States legal tender notes, on\r\npresentation at the sub-treasury in New York, and will then receive\r\nsuch notes in payment for four per cent. bonds.  The department\r\ndoes not anticipate any change in the law that would operate to\r\nprevent this, but cannot stipulate against any act which Congress\r\nin its judgment may pass.\"\r\n\r\nEvery facility which the law allowed to promote the easy change in\r\nthe basis of our currency was carefully considered and adopted.\r\nThe chief measure adopted was to promote exchanges in the clearing\r\nhouse in New York, so that only the balance of debits or credits\r\nwould actually be paid.  I requested Assistant Secretary French to\r\nexamine whether, under existing law, such an arrangement was in\r\nthe power of the department, and called his attention to previous\r\ncorrespondence in 1875 in the department on this subject.  He came\r\nto the conclusion that the existing law would not justify such an\r\narrangement.  John Jay Knox, comptroller of the currency, however,\r\nfavored the admission of the assistant treasurer of the United\r\nStates at New York as a member of the clearing house.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"The proposition is favored by the banks generally, and it is\r\nbelieved that the representation of the treasury department in the\r\nclearing house will facilitate the transaction of business between\r\nthe department and the banks, and I therefore respectfully suggest\r\nthat application be made for the admission of the assistant treasurer\r\nin New York to the Clearing House Association, provided it shall\r\nbe found that there is no legal objection thereto.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Hillhouse also was strongly in favor of the plan proposed.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"The plan of going into the clearing house was proposed in\r\ncorrespondence with the department several years ago, as a remedy\r\nfor the risk incurred in the collection of checks, and if there\r\nare no legal impediments in the way, it would very much simplify\r\nthe business of the office if it could be adopted.  The effect in\r\nconnection with resumption would also, I think, be good, as it\r\nwould place the banks and the treasury on the same footing with\r\nrespect to the use of United States notes in settlements, and thus\r\naid in maintaining them at par with gold in all the vast transactions\r\nconnected with our internal trade and commerce.  I have not given\r\nthe question sufficient thought to speak with confidence, but it\r\nseems to me a very important one, and well worthy of careful\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nA committee of the clearing house called upon me and the subject\r\nwas thoroughly considered.  Mr. Gilfillan wrote to General Hillhouse\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury of the United States.}\r\n  \"Washington, November 9, 1878. }\r\n\"Sir:--By direction of the secretary, I have the honor to request\r\nthat you will submit to the Clearing House Association of the banks\r\nof your city the following propositions, and, upon obtaining the\r\nassent of the association to them and communicating that fact to\r\nthe department, you are expected to act in conformity with them.\r\n\r\n\"First.  Hereafter, drafts drawn upon any bank represented in the\r\nClearing House Association in the city of New York, received by\r\nthe assistant treasurer in that city, may be presented to such bank\r\nat the clearing house for payment.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  Hereafter, drafts drawn on the assistant treasurer at\r\nNew York may be adjusted by him at the clearing house, and the\r\nbalances due from the United States may be paid at his office in\r\nUnited States notes or clearing house certificates.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  After the 1st of January next, payment of checks presented\r\nto the assistant treasurer by any bank connected with the clearing\r\nhouse may be made by him in United States notes.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"James Gilfillan, Treasurer United States.\r\n\"Hon. Thomas Hillhouse, Assistant Treasurer United States, New\r\n  York.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Hillhouse, on the 12th of November, advised me of the\r\nreceipt of this letter, and that the propositions of the treasurer\r\nwere referred to the Clearing House Association, that a meeting\r\nwould be held and there was little doubt but that they would be\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the Clearing House Association, fifty out of fifty-\r\neight banks, members of the associations, being present, unanimously\r\nadopted the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That in order to facilitate the payment of drafts and\r\nchecks, between the treasurer of the United States and the associated\r\nbanks, the manager of the New York clearing house is authorized to\r\nmake such an arrangement with the assistant treasurer as will\r\naccomplish that purpose through the medium of the clearing house.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the reported interview between the members of\r\nthe clearing house committee and the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwith the views expressed by them to him in the paper presented to\r\nthis meeting upon the subject of the restoration of specie payments,\r\nmeets the cordial approbation of this association, and that the\r\npractical measures recommended for the adoption of the banks in\r\nrespect to their treatment of coin in their business in the public,\r\nand with each other, be accepted and carried into practical operation;\r\nand, in pursuance thereof, it is hereby further\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the associated banks of this city, after the 1st\r\nof January, 1879, will, first, decline receiving gold coins as\r\n'special deposits,' but accept and treat them as lawful money;\r\nsecond, abolish special exchanges of gold checks at the clearing\r\nhouse; third, pay and receive balances between banks at the clearing\r\nhouse, either in gold or United States legal tender notes; fourth,\r\nreceive silver dollars upon deposit only, under special contract\r\nto withdraw the same in kind; fifth, prohibit payments of balances\r\nat the clearing house in silver certificates, or in silver dollars,\r\nexcepting as subsidiary coin, in small sums (say under $10); sixth,\r\ndiscontinue gold special accounts, by notice to dealers, on 1st of\r\nJanuary next, to terminate them.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the manager of the clearing house be requested\r\nto send copies of the proceedings of this meeting to clearing houses\r\nin other cities, with an expression of the hope that they will\r\nunite in similar measures for promoting the resumption of coin\r\npayments.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted in the following note:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,                 }\r\n  \"Washington, D.

Camp,\r\nmanager of the New York clearing house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nINVESTIGATION OF THE NEW YORK CUSTOMHOUSE.\r\nA General Examination of Several Ports Ordered--No Difficulty Except\r\nat New York--First Report of the Commission--President Hayes'\r\nRecommendations--Letter of Instructions to Collector C. A. Arthur\r\n--Second Report of the Commission--Losses to the Government by\r\nReason of Inefficiency of Employees--Various Measures of Reform\r\nRecommended--Four Other Reports Made--The President Decides on the\r\nRemoval of Arthur, Cornell and Sharpe--Two Letters to R. C. McCormick\r\non the Subject--Arthur et al. Refuse to Resign--The Senate Twice\r\nRefuses to Confirm the Men Appointed by the President to Succeed\r\nThem--Conkling's Contest Against Civil Service Reform--My Letter\r\nto Senator Allison--Final Victory of the President.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the administration of President Hayes, and for\r\nmonths previous, there had been complaints as to the conduct of\r\nbusiness in the principal customhouses of the United States.  This\r\nwas especially called to my attention, and at my suggestion the\r\nPresident directed an examination into the conduct of the customhouses\r\nat New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco and perhaps\r\nother ports.  Examinations were made by intelligent business men\r\nselected in the various ports, and full reports were made by them,\r\nand printed as public documents.  Many changes were made, and\r\nreforms adopted, founded upon these reports, and there was no\r\ndifficulty except only at the port of New York, where more than\r\ntwo-thirds of all the customs revenue was collected.  Chester A.\r\nArthur was then collector of the port, A. B. Cornell was naval\r\nofficer, and George H. Sharpe was appraiser.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of April, 1877, I designated John Jay, Lawrence Turnure,\r\nof New York, and J. H. Robinson, Assistant Solicitor of the Treasury,\r\nas a commission on the New York customhouse.  They were requested\r\nto make a thorough examination into the conduct of business in that\r\ncustomhouse.  Full instructions were given and many specifications\r\nwere made in detail of all the points embraced in their examination.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May they made their first report, preferring to\r\ntreat the general subject-matter separately.  This report related\r\nchiefly to appointments upon political influence without due regard\r\nto efficiency.  I promptly referred it to the President, and received\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Executive Mansion,       }\r\n  \"Washington, May 26, 1877.}\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I have read the partial report of the commission\r\nappointed to examine the New York customhouse.  I concur with the\r\ncommission in their recommendations.  It is my wish that the\r\ncollection of the revenues should be free from partisan control,\r\nand organized on a strictly business basis, with the same guarantees\r\nfor efficiency and fidelity in the selection of the chief and\r\nsubordinate officers that would be required by a prudent merchant.\r\nParty leaders should have no more influence in appointments than\r\nany other equally respectable citizens.  No assessments for political\r\npurposes, on officers or subordinates, should be allowed.  No\r\nuseless officer or employee should be retained.  No officer should\r\nbe required or permitted to take part in the management of political\r\norganizations, caucuses, conventions, or election campaigns.  Their\r\nright to vote, and to express their views on public questions,\r\neither orally or through the press, is not denied, provided it does\r\nnot interfere with the discharge of their official duties.\r\n\r\n  \"Respectfully,\r\n  \"R. B. Hayes.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, etc.\"\r\n\r\nMy answer to the commission was as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, May 26, 1877.\r\n\"Gentlemen:--Your first report on the customhouse in New York, of\r\ndate the 24th instant, has been received, and the reduction proposed\r\nby you of twenty per cent. of the number of persons employed therein\r\nis approved.\r\n\r\n\"So far as these offices are created by law, vacancies will be made\r\nand left for the action of Congress.  The reduction of the other\r\nemployees, the number of whom and whose compensation are not fixed\r\nby law, will be made as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\n\"I am much gratified that the collector, the naval officer, and\r\nthe surveyor of the port, concur with you in the proposed reduction.\r\n\r\n\"The hours of employment, after the 31st of this month, will be\r\nfrom 9 o'clock a. m. till 4 o'clock p. m., excepting where a longer\r\ntime is prescribed by law.  This corresponds to the hours of clerical\r\nservice in this department.  This rule will be strictly enforced,\r\nand absence will be the cause of reduction of pay or removal.\r\nStrict attention to duty will be required, and other business will\r\nnot be allowed to interfere with the full discharge of the duty\r\nattached to the office.\r\n\r\n\"I notice that you do not suggest a mode of carrying into effect\r\nthe reduction of the force recommended, and I cannot, with due\r\nregard to the remaining subjects of your inquiry, ask you to extend\r\nyour investigation into the _personnel_ of each employee, his\r\ncharacter, efficiency, and merits.  This must be mainly left to\r\nthe collector, who, by law, is authorized to employ, with the\r\napproval of the Secretary of the Treasury, proper persons as deputy\r\ncollectors, weighers, gaugers, and measurers, in the several ports\r\nwithin his district.  Thus, nearly all the officers of the customhouse\r\nare appointed by the collector, and, with the approval of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, may be removed at pleasure.  He will be\r\npromptly called upon, under special orders, to perform this delicate\r\nand onerous duty.  It is very important that it should be executed\r\nwith due regard to the efficiency and merit of the employees, and\r\nso as best to promote the public service.\r\n\r\n\"In order that a rule might be furnished him, I called upon the\r\nPresident for instructions to govern alike the collector and myself\r\nin the execution of this duty.  A copy of his answer is hereto\r\nannexed.  You will see from it that he approves your recommendations,\r\nand that he wishes the customhouse conducted free from partisan\r\ncontrol, on a strictly business basis, with the same guarantees\r\nfor efficiency and fidelity in the selection of the chief and\r\nsubordinate officers that would be required by a prudent merchant;\r\nthat the public business should not be affected injuriously by the\r\ninterests or influence of party leaders or party struggles; and\r\nthat, while an officer should freely exercise his political rights\r\nas a citizen, he should not use his power as an officer to influence\r\nthe conduct of others.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the opinions expressed by the President will meet with\r\nyour hearty approval, and they are in harmony with your report.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to add the thanks of this department for your care,\r\nability and industry in conducting this inquiry.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\r\n\"Messrs. John Jay, L. Turnure, and J. H. Robinson,\r\n  \"Commission on Custom House, New York.\"\r\n\r\nI inclosed a copy of the report of the commission to Collector\r\nArthur, with the following letter of instruction:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, May 28, 1877.\r\n\"Sir:--Inclosed I send you a copy of the first report of the\r\ncommission on the New York customhouse, recommending a large\r\nreduction of the employees in the various offices in your collection\r\ndistrict, and the approval and adoption of that report.\r\n\r\n\"It only remains now to execute this order, upon the principles\r\nand in the spirit stated by the President.  This task, always an\r\nunpleasant one, when it requires the removal of employees, falls\r\nmainly upon you, subject to my approval.  It may not be amiss now\r\nfor me to state, in advance, somewhat in more detail, my views as\r\nto the mode of reduction.  The extent of the reduction is fully\r\nstated in the report, and we are thus relieved from that portion\r\nof the task.\r\n\r\n\"I notice by the report that you have an exceptionally large\r\nproportion of experienced officers still in the service.  You will\r\nhave no difficulty in selecting, from these, the more efficient\r\nand trustworthy to fill the more important positions, and when\r\nthese are carefully selected, you will have secured for the duties\r\nof greatest trust, active, efficient, and experienced officers.\r\nIt must happen that among those longest in service some are disabled\r\nby age and infirmity.  It is often the most painful, but necessary,\r\nduty, to dismiss there, or reduce them to positions which they are\r\nstill able to fill.  The government is fairly entitled to the\r\nservices of those who are fully able to discharge personally the\r\nduties of their office, and who are willing to give their entire\r\nattention to their official duty.  If they cannot, or do not, do\r\nthis, it is no injustice to remove them.\r\n\r\n\"In the selection of inferior officers, the only rule should be\r\nthe one daily acted upon by merchants--to employ only those who\r\nare competent for the special work assigned them, whose industry,\r\nintegrity, and good habits give guarantees for faithful services,\r\nhonestly rendered.  This reduction will enable you to transfer\r\nthose now employed on work for which they are not fitted, to other\r\nwork for which they are competent, and to reward exceptional merit\r\nand ability by promotion.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible, in a force so large as yours, that you should\r\nknow the peculiar qualities and merits of each employee, and it is\r\nimportant, in making selections, that you secure this information\r\nthrough committees of trusted officers, and in proper cases to test\r\nthe intelligence, ability, and qualifications of an officer or\r\napplicant for office by written questions or an oral examination.\r\nIn many cases the partiality and influence of relations secure\r\nseveral persons of the same family in office, thus causing complaints\r\nand favoritism.  As a rule, it is best in all cases to have but\r\none of the same family under your jurisdiction, and no just complaint\r\ncan be made if this rule is impartially enforced.\r\n\r\n\"The President properly lays great stress on excluding from a purely\r\nbusiness office active participation in party politics.  Naturally,\r\nin a government like ours, other things being equal, those will be\r\npreferred who sympathize with the party in power; but persons in\r\noffice ought not to be expected to serve their party to the neglect\r\nof official duty, or to promote the interests of particular\r\ncandidates, or to interfere with the free course of popular opinion,\r\nor to run caucuses or conventions.  Such activity of office-holders\r\nis offensive to the great mass of the people who hold no office,\r\nand gives rise to complaints and irritation.  If any have been\r\nappointed for purely political reasons, without regard to their\r\nefficiency, now is a good time to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n\"Where actual misconduct is proven, such as receiving gratuities\r\nor bribes, or oppression or insolence in office, or even the want\r\nof common courtesy, or drunkenness or other bad habits tending to\r\ndegrade the officer, or absence from or neglect of duty--in all\r\nsuch cases I know it will be your pleasure to dismiss the employee.\r\n\r\n\"The payment of taxes is not pleasant at best, but if rudely enforced\r\nby oppression or discreditable officers, it renders the tax as well\r\nas the tax-collector odious.\r\n\r\n\"I do not fix any time within which this reduction must be made,\r\nbut shall expect it to be completed by the 30th day of June proximo.\r\nSo far as the reduction is specifically made by the adoption of\r\nthe report, it should be made by the 1st day of June, and it should\r\nbe made as to each particular division or department of the\r\ncustomhouse as early as practicable.\r\n\r\n\"After all, the success of this movement for reform of old abuses,\r\nwhich existed for many years before you became collector, will\r\ndepend mainly upon your good sense and discretion.  I assure you\r\nI will heartily sustain and approve any recommendation you may make\r\nthat appears to me to tend to make the New York customhouse--not\r\nonly what it now is, the most important, but what it ought to be--\r\nthe best managed business agency of the government.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\r\n\"C. A. Arthur, Esq., Collector of Customs, New York.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the inquiry commenced there was no purpose or desire on the\r\npart of the President or anyone to make a change in the officers\r\nof the New York customhouse.  This is apparent from my letter to\r\nCollector Arthur.  The commission proceeded with their examination,\r\nand on the 2nd of July made their second report.  This contained\r\nspecific charges, but of a general character, against persons\r\nemployed in the customhouse.  They found that for many years past,\r\nthe view had obtained with some political leaders that the friends\r\nof the administration in power had a right to control the customs\r\nappointments; and this view, which seemed to have been acquiesced\r\nin by successive administrations, had of late been recognized to\r\nwhat the commission deemed an undue extent by the chief officers\r\nof the service.  These gentlemen, on the ground that they were\r\ncompelled to surrender to personal and partisan dictation, appeared\r\nto have assumed that they were relieved, in part, at least, from\r\nthe responsibilities that belonged to the appointing power.\r\n\r\nThe collector of the port, in speaking of the \"ten thousand\r\napplications,\" and remarking that the urgency for appointments came\r\nfrom men all over the country, added, \"the persons for whom it is\r\nmade bear their proportion of the responsibility for the character\r\nof the whole force.\"\r\n\r\nThe surveyor had said:\r\n\r\n\"I had, within the last two weeks, a letter, from a gentleman\r\nholding a high official position, in regard to the appointment of\r\nan officer whom he knows had been dropped three times from the\r\nservice for cause.  He has also been to see me about him, and the\r\nlast time he came he admitted to me that he had been engaged in\r\ndefrauding the revenue; and yet he writes me calling my attention\r\nto the case, and requesting his appointment.\"\r\n\r\nThe collector, in his testimony before the commission, said that\r\n\"the larger number of complaints probably come from the surveyor\r\nof the port,\" and, on being asked their character, said:\r\n\r\n\"Some are for inefficiency, some are for neglect of duty, some for\r\ninebriety, and some for improper conduct in various ways; some for\r\nwant of integrity, and some for accepting bribes.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission further stated:\r\n\r\n\"The investigation showed that ignorance and incapacity on the part\r\nof the employees were not confined to the surveyor's department,\r\nbut were found in other branches of the service--creating delays\r\nand mistakes, imperiling the safety of the revenues and the interests\r\nof importers, and bringing the service into reproach.  It was\r\nintimated by chiefs of departments that men were sent to them\r\nwithout brains enough to do the work, and that some of those\r\nappointed to perform the delicate duties of the appraiser's office,\r\nrequiring the special qualities of an expert, were better fitted\r\nto hoe and to plow.  Some employees were incapacitated by age, some\r\nby ignorance, some by carelessness and indifference; and parties\r\nthus unfitted have been appointed, not to perform routine duties\r\ndistinctly marked, but to exercise a discretion in questions\r\ndemanding intelligence and integrity, and involving a large amount\r\nof revenue.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence shows a degree and extent of carelessness which we\r\nthink should not be permitted to continue.  This point was illustrated\r\nto some degree by the testimony of the chiefs of the appraiser's\r\ndepartment, the important duties of which would certainly justify\r\na reasonable exactness.  The invoices, which are recorded in that\r\noffice, and which are sent out to the different divisions to be\r\npassed upon and then returned to the chief clerk, are found to\r\nexhibit, on their return, errors on the part of the several divisions\r\n--according to one witness, nearly eight hundred errors a month--\r\nalthough the number by the appraiser was estimated at a lesser\r\nfigure.  A part of these errors may be assigned to a difference of\r\nopinion as to the classification of the goods; but fully one-half\r\nare attributed to carelessness.  At the naval office it was stated\r\nthat the balance in favor of the government, of the many and large\r\nerrors which they discover in the customhouse accounts of the\r\nliquidation of vessels and statements of refund, amounts to about\r\na million and a half of dollars per annum.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission entered into a full statement and details as to\r\nirregularities, inefficiency and neglect of duties in different\r\ndepartments of the customhouse, and recommended various measures\r\nof reform, both in the laws regulating the customs service and its\r\nactual administration.  A copy of this report was immediately sent\r\nto Collector Arthur and Naval Officer Cornell, with instructions\r\nto recommend to me the number of each grade for each branch of his\r\noffice, with various details designated by me, and to carry into\r\nexecution the general recommendations of the commission.  I added:\r\n\r\n\"You will please take your own way, by committee of your officers\r\nor otherwise, to fix the number of each grade requisite to conduct\r\nthe business of your office, and make report as early as\r\npracticable.\"\r\n\r\nThe third report was made on the 21st of July, and related to the\r\nmanagement of the department of weighers and gaugers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth report, made on the 31st of August, related to the\r\nappraiser's office.  In acknowledging the receipt of this report\r\non the 12th of September, I stated:\r\n\r\n\"The recommendations made by you will be fully examined in detail,\r\nand be acted upon cotemporaneously with the proposed change in the\r\nleading officers of that customhouse.\"\r\n\r\nTwo other reports were made, dated October 31 and November 1, 1877,\r\nthe latter containing suggestions as to the recommendations of\r\nlegislative amendments to various existing laws and usages.\r\n\r\nAfter the receipt of the report of August 31 the President, who\r\nhad carefully read the several reports, announced his desire to\r\nmake a change in the three leading officers of the New York\r\ncustomhouse.  He wished to place it upon the ground that he thought\r\nthe public service would be best promoted by a general change, that\r\nnew officers would be more likely to make the radical reforms\r\nrequired that those then in the customhouse.  The matter was\r\nsubmitted to the cabinet, and I was requested to communicate with\r\nthese officers, in the hope that they would resign and relive the\r\nPresident from the unpleasant embarrassment of removing them.  On\r\nthe 6th of September I wrote to Richard C. McCormick, Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, who was then at his home near New York\r\non account of illness, the following letter.  I knew that Mr.\r\nMcCormick was on friendly terms with Collector Arthur, and that he\r\nmight better than I inform him of the wish of the President to\r\nreceive the resignations of himself, and Messrs. Cornell and Sharpe:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,                 }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., September 6, 1877.}\r\n\"Dear Governor:--After a very full consideration, and a very kindly\r\none, the President, with the cordial assent of his cabinet, came\r\nto the conclusion that the public interests demanded a change in\r\nthe three leading offices in New York, and a public announcement\r\nof that character was authorized.  I am quite sure that this will,\r\non the whole, be considered to be a wise result.  The manner of\r\nmaking the changes and the persons to be appointed will be a subject\r\nof careful and full consideration, but it is better to know that\r\nit is determined upon and ended.  This made it unnecessary to\r\nconsider the telegrams in regard to Mr. Cornell.  It is probable\r\nthat no special point would have been made upon his holding his\r\nposition as chairman of the state committee for a limited time,\r\nbut even that was not the thing, the real question being that,\r\nwhether he resigned or not, it was better that he and Arthur and\r\nSharpe should all give way to new men, to try definitely a new\r\npolicy in the conduct of the New York customhouse.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt, unless these gentlemen should make it impossible\r\nby their conduct hereafter, that they will be treated with the\r\nutmost consideration, and, for one, I have no hesitation in saying\r\nthat I hope General Arthur will be recognized in a most complimentary\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"Things are going on quietly here, but we miss you very much.  Hope\r\nyou will have a pleasant time and return to us in fresh health and\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. R. C. McCormick.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day I wrote him a supplementary letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,                 }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., September 7, 1877.}\r\n\"Dear Governor:--Your note of yesterday is received.\r\n\r\n\"The action of the President on the New York customhouse cases\r\nturned upon the general question of change there, and not upon\r\nCornell's case.  It happened in this way:  General Sharpe, in a\r\nvery manly letter, withdrew his application for reappointment as\r\nsurveyor of the port.  In considering the question of successor\r\nthe main point, as to whether the changes in the New York customhouse\r\nrendered necessary a general change of the heads of the departments,\r\nwas very fully and very kindly considered, and, without any reference\r\nto Cornell's matter, until it was thought, as a matter of public\r\npolicy, it was best to make change in these heads, with some details\r\nabout it which I will communicate to you when you return.  When\r\nthat was seen to be the unanimous opinion, it was thought hardly\r\nworth while to single out Mr. Cornell's case, and act upon it on\r\nthe question that affected him alone.  If he was allowed to resign\r\nfrom the committee, it would undoubtedly be upon an implied\r\nsupposition that he would be continued as naval officer.  I think\r\neven yet he ought to do as he proposed to Orton, but we could not\r\nafford to have him do it with any such implied assent, and, therefore,\r\nit was deemed better to make the formal announcement agreed upon.\r\nYou know how carefully such things are considered, and, after a\r\nnight's reflection, I am satisfied of the wisdom of the conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see Arthur, and have requested him to come here.  You\r\ncan say to him that, with the kindest feelings, and, as he will\r\nunderstand when he sees me, with a proper appreciation of his\r\nconduct during the examination by the commission, there should be\r\nno feeling about this in New York.  At all events, what has been\r\ndone is beyond recall.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. R. C. McCormick.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick complied with my request, and orally reported his\r\ninterview on his return to Washington.  We were given to understand\r\nthat these officers did not wish to be removed pending the\r\ninvestigation, as it would seem that they were charged with the\r\nacknowledged defects and irregularities which they themselves had\r\npointed out.  The President was quite willing to base his request\r\nfor their resignation, not upon the ground that they were guilty\r\nof the offenses charged, but that new officers could probably deal\r\nwith the reorganization of the customhouse with more freedom and\r\nsuccess than the incumbents.  I also saw General Arthur, and\r\nexplained to him the view taken by the President and his desire\r\nnot in any way to reflect upon the collector and his associates,\r\nCornell and Sharpe.  I believed that at the close of the investigation\r\nby the commission these gentlemen would resign, and that their\r\ncharacter and merits would be recognized possibly by appointments\r\nto other offices.\r\n\r\nActing on this idea, on the 15th of October, I wrote the following\r\nletter to Arthur:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., October 15, 1877.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I regret to hear from Mr. Evarts that you decline the\r\nconsulship at Paris which I supposed would be very agreeable to you.\r\n\r\n\"As the time has arrived when your successor must be appointed, I\r\nsubmit to you whether, though your resignation might be inferred\r\nfrom your letters on file, it would not be better for you to tender\r\nit formally before your successor is appointed.\r\n\r\n\"The President desires to make this change in a way most agreeable\r\nto you, and it would be most convenient to have it announced to-\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n\"An early answer is requested.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly, etc.,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"General C. A. Arthur, Collector Customs, New York.\"\r\n\r\nIt soon became manifest that these gentlemen had no purpose to\r\nresign, and that Senator Conkling intended to make a political\r\ncontest against the policy of civil service reform inaugurated by\r\nPresident Hayes.  On the 24th of October, 1877, the President sent\r\nto the Senate the nominations of Theodore Roosevelt to succeed\r\nArthur as collector, Edwin A. Merritt to succeed George H. Sharpe\r\nas surveyor, and L. B. Prince to succeed A. B. Cornell as naval\r\nofficer.  All of them were rejected by the Senate on the 29th of\r\nOctober.  On the 6th day of December, during the following session,\r\nRoosevelt, Prince and Merritt were again nominated, and the two\r\nformer were again rejected.  Merritt was confirmed as surveyor on\r\nthe 16th of December.\r\n\r\nThis action of the Senate was indefensible.  There was not the\r\nslightest objection to Roosevelt or Prince, and none was made.\r\nThe reasons for a change were given in the report of the Jay\r\ncommission.  Even without this report the right of the President\r\nto appoint these officers was given by the constitution.  To compel\r\nthe President to retain anyone in such an office, charged with the\r\ncollection of the great body of the revenue from customs, in the\r\nface of such reasons as were given for removal, was a gross breach\r\nof public duty.  No doubt the Democratic majority in the Senate\r\nmight defend themselves with political reasons, but the motive of\r\nMr. Conkling was hostility to President Hayes and his inborn desire\r\nto domineer.  The chief embarrassment fell upon me.  I wished to\r\nexecute the reforms needed in the collector's office, but could\r\nonly do it with his consent.  The co-operation required was not\r\ngiven, and the office was held in profound contempt of the President.\r\nIf the rejection of these nominations had been placed upon the\r\nground of unfitness, other names could have been sent to the Senate,\r\nbut there was no charge of that kind, while specific and definite\r\ncharges were made against the incumbents.  Other names were mentioned\r\nto the President, and suggestions were made, among others by Whitelaw\r\nReid, whose letter I insert:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, March 29, 1878.\r\n\"My Dear Mr. Sherman:--Leaving Washington unexpectedly this morning,\r\nI was unable to call again at the treasury department in accordance\r\nwith your polite invitation of last night.  I have, however, been\r\nthinking over the customhouse problem of which you asked my opinion.\r\nIt seems to me, more and more clear, that, if a new appointment is\r\nto be made, it should be controlled by two considerations:  First,\r\nthe appointee should be a man who can be confirmed; and, second,\r\nhe should be a man equal to all the practical duties of the place,\r\nwhich are necessarily and essentially political as well as\r\nmercantile.\r\n\r\n\"To nominate another man only to have him rejected would do great\r\nharm, and the confirmation cannot, by any means, be taken for\r\ngranted.  I believe it is possible to select some well-known man,\r\nwho has carefully studied the subject of revenue collection, and\r\ncould bring to the task executive skill, experience, and sound\r\nbusiness and political sagacity, and that such a nomination could\r\nbe confirmed.  I assume, of course, that any movement of this sort\r\nwould be based upon the previous removal of the present incumbent,\r\nfor good cause--of which I have been hearing rumors for some time.\r\n\r\n\"Pray let me renew more formally the invitation to dine with me,\r\non the evening of the 10th of April, at seven o'clock, at the Union\r\nLeague Club, to meet Mr. Bayard Taylor just before his departure\r\nfor Berlin.  I sincerely hope you can arrange your movements after\r\nthe Chester visit so as to make it possible.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"Whitelaw Reid.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\nThe President would not make other appointments during the session\r\nof the Senate, as the implication would arise that the rejections\r\nwere based upon opposition to the persons named, and he, therefore,\r\npostponed any action until the close of the session.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the session, on the 11th of July, 1878, the\r\nPresident gave temporary commissions to Edwin A. Merritt as collector\r\nto succeed C. A. Arthur, and Silas W. Burt to succeed Cornell as\r\nnaval officer, and these gentlemen entered upon the duties of their\r\nrespective offices.\r\n\r\nOn the following December it became necessary to send their\r\nnominations to the Senate.  I had definitely made up my mind that\r\nif the Senate again rejected them I would resign.  I would not hold\r\nan office when my political friends forced me to act through\r\nunfriendly subordinates.  I wrote a letter to Senator Allison as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., January 31, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I would not bother you with this personal matter,\r\nbut that I feel the deepest interest in the confirmation of General\r\nMerritt, which I know will be beneficial to us as a party, and\r\nstill more so to the public service.  Personally I have the deepest\r\ninterest in it because I have been unjustly assailed in regard to\r\nit in the most offensive manner.  I feel free to appeal to you and\r\nWindom, representing as you do western states, and being old friends\r\nand acquaintances, to take into consideration this personal aspect\r\nof the case.  If the restoration of Arthur is insisted upon, the\r\nwhole liberal element will be against us and it will lose us tens\r\nof thousands of votes without doing a particle of good.  No man\r\ncould be a more earnest Republican than I, and I feel this political\r\nloss as much as anyone can.  It will be a personal reproach to me,\r\nand merely to gratify the insane hate of Conkling, who in this\r\nrespect disregards the express wishes of the Republican Members\r\nfrom New York, of the great body of Republicans, and, as I personally\r\nknow, runs in antagonism to his nearest and best friends in the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n\"Surely men like you and Windom, who have the courage of your\r\nconvictions, should put a stop to this foolish and unnecessary\r\nwarfare.  Three or four men who will tell Conkling squarely that,\r\nwhile you are his friends, you will not injure our party and our\r\ncause, would put a stop to this business.  Arthur will not go back\r\ninto the office.  This contest will be continued, and the only\r\nresult of all this foolish madness will be to compel a Republican\r\nadministration to appeal to a Democratic Senate for confirmation\r\nof a collector at New York.  It is a most fatal mistake.\r\n\r\n\"I intended to call upon some of the Senators this morning, but I\r\nam very much pressed, and will ask you to show this in confidence\r\nto Senator Windom, as I have not time to write him.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. W. B. Allison, U. S. Senate.\"\r\n\r\nI wrote to Senator Justin S. Morrill a much longer letter, giving\r\nreasons in detail in favor of confirmation and containing specific\r\ncharges of neglect of duty on the part of Arthur and Cornell, but\r\nI do not care to revive them.\r\n\r\nConkling was confident of defeating the confirmations, and thus\r\nrestoring Arthur and Cornell.  The matter was decided, after a\r\nstruggle of seven hours in the Senate, by the decisive vote in\r\nfavor of confirmation of Merritt 33, and against him 24, in favor\r\nof Burt 31, against 19.  From this time forward there was but slight\r\nopposition to the confirmation of Hayes' appointments.  The reforms\r\nproposed in the customhouse at New York were carried out.\r\n\r\nThis termination of the controversy with Arthur and Cornell was\r\nsupported by public opinion generally throughout the United States.\r\nI insert a letter from John Jay upon the subject.\r\n\r\n  \"N. Y. C. H., 24 Washington Square,}\r\n  \"New York, February 3, 1879.       }\r\n\"The Honorable John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Allow me to thank you for the two papers you have\r\nkindly sent me, in reference to the customhouse, the last of which,\r\nthe firm message of the President with your second conclusive\r\nletter, reached me to-day.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the result in the Senate, and I can scarcely\r\nbelieve that, after so full an exposure, the nomination will be\r\nrejected, the plain-thinking people of this country will appreciate\r\nthe attitude taken by the government as the only one consistent\r\nwith the duty of the executive and the general welfare.\r\n\r\n\"It will give new hope and confidence to the great body of Republicans,\r\nand to many who can hardly be called Republicans, who look to the\r\nadministration for an unflinching adherence--no matter what the\r\nopposition--to the pledge of reform on which the party was successful\r\nin the last election, and on fidelity to which depends its safety\r\nin the next.\r\n\r\n\"The country is infinitely indebted to you for redeeming its faith\r\nby a return to honest money.  A new debt will be incurred of yet\r\nwider scope if you succeed in liberating the custom service from\r\nthe vicious grip of the immoral factions of office holders and\r\ntheir retainers, who have made it a scandal to the nation with such\r\ngigantic loss to the treasury and immeasurable damage to our\r\ncommerce, industry and morals.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that the President will feel that all good citizens who\r\nare not blinded by prejudice or interest are thoroughly with him\r\nin the policy and resolve of his message that the customhouse shall\r\nno longer be 'a center of partisan political management.'\r\n\r\n\"With great regard I have the honor to be, dear Mr. Sherman,\r\n\r\n  \"Faithfully yours,\r\n  \"John Jay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS.\r\nAnnual Report to Congress on Dec. 2, 1878--Preparations for Resumption\r\nAccompanied with Increased Business and Confidence--Full Explanation\r\nof the Powers of the Treasurer Under the Act--How Resumption Was\r\nto Be Accomplished--Laws Effecting the Coinage of Gold and Silver\r\n--Recommendation to Congress That the Coinage of the Silver Dollar\r\nBe Discontinued When the Amount Outstanding Should Exceed $50,000,000\r\n--Funding the Public Debt--United States Notes at Par with Gold--\r\nInstructions to the Assistant Treasurer at New York--Political\r\nSituation in Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe annual report made by me to Congress on the 2nd of December,\r\n1878, contained the usual formal information as to the condition\r\nof the treasury, and the various bureaus and divisions of that\r\ndepartment.  It was regarded as a fair statement of public affairs\r\nat a time of unusual prosperity.  The revenue in excess of expenditures\r\nduring the year amounted to $20,799,551.90.\r\n\r\nThe statement made by me in this report, in respect to the resumption\r\nof specie payments on the 1st day of January, 1879, is so closely\r\na narrative of what did happen before and after that date that I\r\ndeem it best to quote the language of the report.  I then said:\r\n\r\n\"The important duty imposed on this department by the resumption\r\nact, approved January 14, 1875, has been steadily pursued during\r\nthe past year.  The plain purpose of the act is to secure to all\r\ninterests and all classes the benefits of a sound currency, redeemable\r\nin coin, with the least possible disturbance of existing rights\r\nand contracts.  Three of its provisions have been substantially\r\ncarried into execution by the gradual substitution of fractional\r\ncoin for fractional currency, by the free coinage of gold, and by\r\nfree banking.  There remains only the completion of preparations\r\nfor resumption in coin on the 1st day of January, 1879, and its\r\nmaintenance thereafter upon the basis of existing law.\r\n\r\n\"At the date of my annual report to Congress in December, 1877, it\r\nwas deemed necessary, as a preparation for resumption, to accumulate\r\nin the treasury a coin reserve of at least forty per cent. of the\r\namount of United States notes then outstanding.  At that time it\r\nwas anticipated that under the provisions of the resumption act\r\nthe volume of United States notes would be reduced to $300,000,000\r\nby the 1st day of January, 1879, or soon thereafter, and that a\r\nreserve in coin of $120,000,000 would then be sufficient.  Congress,\r\nhowever, in view of the strong popular feeling against a contraction\r\nof the currency, by the act approved May 31, 1878, forbade the\r\nretirement of any United States notes after that date, leaving the\r\namount in circulation $346,681,016.  Upon the principle of safety\r\nupon which the department was acting, that forty per cent. of coin\r\nwas the smallest reserve upon which resumption could prudently be\r\ncommenced, it became necessary to increase the coin reserve to\r\n$138,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the year 1877 this coin reserve, in excess of coin\r\nliability, amounted to $63,016,050.96, of which $15,000,000 were\r\nobtained by the sale of four and a half per cent., and $25,000,000\r\nby the sale of four per cent. bonds, the residue being surplus\r\nrevenue.  Subsequently, on the 11th day of April, 1878, the secretary\r\nentered into a contract with certain bankers in New York and London\r\n--the parties to the previous contract of June 9, 1877, already\r\ncommunicated to Congress--for the sale of $50,000,000 four and a\r\nhalf per cent. bonds for resumption purposes.  The bonds were sold\r\nat a premium of one and a half per cent. and accrued interest, less\r\na commission of one-half of one per cent.  The contract has been\r\nfulfilled, and the net proceeds, $50,500,000, have been paid into\r\nthe treasury in gold coin.  The $5,500,000 coin paid on the Halifax\r\naward have been replaced by the sale of that amount of four per\r\ncent. bonds sold for resumption purposes, making the aggregate\r\namount of bonds sold for these purposes, $95,500,000, of which\r\n$65,000,000 were four and a half per cent. bonds, and $30,500,000\r\nfour per cent. bonds.  To this has been added the surplus revenue\r\nfrom time to time.  The amount of coin held in the treasury on the\r\n23rd day of November last, in excess of coin sufficient to pay all\r\naccrued coin liabilities, was $141,888,100, and constitutes the\r\ncoin reserve prepared for resumption purposes.  This sum will be\r\ndiminished somewhat on the 1st of January next, by reason of the\r\nlarge amount of interest accruing on that day in excess of the coin\r\nrevenue received meanwhile.\r\n\r\n\"In anticipation of resumption, and in view of the fact that the\r\nredemption of United States notes is mandatory only at the office\r\nof the assistant treasurer in the city of New York, it was deemed\r\nimportant to secure the co-operation of the associated banks of\r\nthat city in the ready collection of drafts on those banks and in\r\nthe payment of treasury drafts held by them.  A satisfactory\r\narrangement has been made by which all drafts on the banks held by\r\nthe treasury are to be paid at the clearing house, and all drafts\r\non the treasury held by them are to be paid to the clearing house\r\nat the office of the assistant treasurer, in United States notes;\r\nand, after the 1st of January, United States notes are to be received\r\nby them as coin.  This will greatly lessen the risk and labor of\r\ncollections both to the treasury and the banks.\r\n\r\n\"Every step in these preparations for resumption has been accompanied\r\nwith increased business and confidence.  The accumulation of coin,\r\ninstead of increasing its price, as was feared by many, has steadily\r\nreduced its premium on the market.  The depressing and ruinous\r\nlosses that followed the panic of 1873 had not diminished in 1875,\r\nwhen the resumption act passed; but every measure taken in the\r\nexecution or enforcement of this act has tended to lighten these\r\nlosses and to reduce the premium on coin, so that now it is merely\r\nnominal.  The present condition of our trade, industry, and commerce,\r\nhereafter more fully stated, our ample reserves, and the general\r\nconfidence inspired in our financial condition, seem to justify\r\nthe opinion that we are prepared to commence and maintain resumption\r\nfrom and after the 1st day of January, A. D. 1879.\r\n\r\n\"The means and manner of doing this are left largely to the discretion\r\nof the secretary, but, from the nature of the duty imposed, he must\r\nrestore coin and bullion, when withdrawn in the process of redemption,\r\neither by the sale of bonds, or the use of the surplus revenue, or\r\nof the notes redeemed from time to time.\r\n\r\n\"The power to sell any of the bonds described in the refunding act\r\ncontinues after as well as before resumption.  Thought it may not\r\nbe often used, it is essential to enable this department to meet\r\nemergencies.  By its exercise it is anticipated that the treasury\r\nat any time can readily obtain coin to reinforce the reserve already\r\naccumulated.  United States notes must, however, be the chief means\r\nunder existing law with which the department must restore coin and\r\nbullion when withdrawn in process of redemption.  The notes, when\r\nredeemed, must necessarily accumulate in the treasury until their\r\nsuperior use and convenience for circulation enables the department\r\nto exchange them at par for coin or bullion.\r\n\r\n\"The act of May 31, 1878, already referred to, provides that when\r\nUnited States notes are redeemed or received in the treasury under\r\nany law, from any source whatever, and shall belong to the United\r\nStates, they shall not be retired, canceled, or destroyed, but\r\nshall be reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation.\r\n\r\n\"The power to reissue United States notes was conferred by section\r\n3579, Revised Statutes, and was not limited by the resumption act.\r\nAs this, however, was questioned, Congress wisely removed the doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Notes redeemed are like other notes received into the treasury.\r\nPayments of them can be made only in consequence of appropriations\r\nmade by law, or for the purchase of bullion, or for the refunding\r\nof the public debt.\r\n\r\n\"The current receipts from revenue are sufficient to meet the\r\ncurrent expenditures as well as the accruing interest on the public\r\ndebt.  Authority is conferred by the refunding act to redeem six\r\nper cent. bonds as they become redeemable, by the proceeds of the\r\nsale of bonds bearing a lower rate of interest.  The United States\r\nnotes redeemed under the resumption act are, therefore, the principal\r\nmeans provided for the purchase of bullion or coin with which to\r\nmaintain resumption, but should only be paid out when they can be\r\nused to replace an equal amount of coin withdrawn from the resumption\r\nfund.  They may, it is true, be used for current purposes like\r\nother money, but when so used their place is filled by money received\r\nfrom taxes or other sources of income.\r\n\r\n\"In daily business no distinction need be made between moneys, from\r\nwhatever source received, but they may properly be applied to any\r\nof the purposes authorized by law.  No doubt coin liabilities, such\r\nas interest or principal of the public debt, will be ordinarily\r\npaid and willingly received in United States notes, but, when\r\ndemanded, such payments will be made in coin; and United States\r\nnotes and coin will be used in the purchase of bullion.  This method\r\nhas already been adopted in Colorado and North Carolina, and\r\narrangements are being perfected to purchase bullion in this way\r\nin all the mining regions of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"By the act approved June 8, 1878, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nis authorized to constitute any superintendent of a mint, or assayer\r\nof any assay office, an assistant treasurer of the United States,\r\nto receive gold coin or bullion on deposit.  By the legislative\r\nappropriation bill, approved June 19, 1878, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury is authorized to issue coin certificates in payment to\r\ndepositors of bullion at the several mints and assay offices of\r\nthe United States.  These provisions, intended to secure to the\r\nproducers of bullion more speedy payment, will necessarily bring\r\ninto the mints and treasury the great body of the precious metals\r\nmined in the United States, and will tend greatly to the easy and\r\nsteady supply of bullion for coinage.  United States notes, at par\r\nwith coin, will be readily received for bullion instead of coin\r\ncertificates, and with great advantage and convenience to the\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\n\"Deposits of coin in the treasury will, no doubt, continue to be\r\nmade after the 1st of January, as heretofore.  Both gold and silver\r\ncoin, from its weight and bulk, will naturally seek a safe deposit,\r\nwhile notes redeemable in coin, from their superior convenience,\r\nwill be circulated instead.  After resumption the distinction\r\nbetween coin and United States notes should be, as far as practicable,\r\nabandoned in the current affairs of the government; and therefore\r\nno coin certificates should be issued except where expressly required\r\nby the provisions of law, as in the case of silver certificates.\r\nThe gold certificates hitherto issued by virtue of the discretion\r\nconferred upon the secretary will not be issued after the 1st of\r\nJanuary next.  The necessity for them during a suspension of specie\r\npayments is obvious, but no longer exists when by law every United\r\nStates note is, in effect, a coin certificate.  The only purpose\r\nthat could be subserved by their issue hereafter would be to enable\r\npersons to convert their notes into coin certificates, and thus\r\ncontract the currency and hoard gold in the vaults of the treasury\r\nwithout the inconvenience or risk of its custody.  For convenience,\r\nUnited States notes of the same denomination as the larger coin\r\ncertificates will be issued.\r\n\r\n\"By existing law, customs duties and the interest of the public\r\ndebt are payable in coin, and a portion of the duties was specifically\r\npledged as a special fund for the payment of the interest, thus\r\nmaking one provision dependent upon the other.  As we cannot, with\r\ndue regard to the public honor, repeal the obligation to pay in\r\ncoin, we ought not to impair or repeal the means provided to procure\r\ncoin.  When, happily, our notes are equal to coin, they will be\r\naccepted as coin, both by the public creditor and by the government;\r\nbut this acceptance should be left to the option of the respective\r\nparties, and the legal right on both sides to demand coin should\r\nbe preserved inviolate.\r\n\r\n\"The secretary is of the opinion that a change of the law is not\r\nnecessary to authorize this department to receive United States\r\nnotes for customs duties on and after the 1st day of January, 1879,\r\nwhile they are redeemable and are redeemed on demand in coin.\r\nAfter resumption it would seem a useless inconvenience to require\r\npayment of such duties in coin rather than in United States notes.\r\nThe resumption act, by clear implication, so far modifies previous\r\nlaws as to permit payments in United States notes as well as in\r\ncoin.  The provision for coin payments was made in the midst of\r\nwar, when the notes were depreciated and the public necessities\r\nrequired an assured revenue in coin to support the public credit.\r\nThis alone justified the refusal by the government to take its own\r\nnotes for the taxes levied by it.  It has now definitely assumed\r\nto pay these notes in coin, and this necessarily implies the receipt\r\nof these notes as coin.  To refuse them is only to invite their\r\npresentation for coin.  Any other construction would require the\r\nnotes to be presented to the assistant treasurer in New York for\r\ncoin, and, if used in the purchase of bonds, to be returned to the\r\nsame officer, or, if used for the payment of customs duties, to be\r\ncarried to the collector of customs, who must daily deposit in the\r\ntreasury all money received by him.  It is not to be assumed that\r\nthe law requires this indirect and inconvenient process after the\r\nnotes are redeemable in coin on demand of the holder.  They are\r\nthen at a parity with coin, and both should be received indiscriminately.\r\n\r\n\"If United States notes are received for duties at the port of New\r\nYork, they should be received for the same purpose in all other\r\nports of the United States, or an unconstitutional preference would\r\nbe given to that port over other ports.  If this privilege is denied\r\nto the citizens of other ports, they could make such use of these\r\nnotes only by transporting them to New York and transporting the\r\ncoin to their homes for payment; and all this not only without\r\nbenefit to the government, but with a loss in returning the coin\r\nagain to New York, where it is required for redemption purposes.\r\n\r\n\"The provision in the law for redemption in New York was believed\r\nto be practical redemption in all parts of the United States.\r\nActual redemption was confined to a single place from the necessity\r\nof maintaining only one coin reserve and where the coin could be\r\neasily accumulated and kept.\r\n\r\n\"With this view of the resumption act, the secretary will feel it\r\nto be his duty, unless Congress otherwise provides, to direct that\r\nafter the 1st day of January next, and while United States notes\r\nare redeemed at the treasury, they be received the same as coin by\r\nthe officers of this department, in all payments in all parts of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\"If any further provision of law is deemed necessary by Congress\r\nto authorize the receipt of United States notes for customs dues\r\nor for bonds, the secretary respectfully submits that this authority\r\nshould continue only while the notes are redeemed in coin.  However\r\ndesirable continuous resumption may be, and however confident we\r\nmay feel in its maintenance, yet the experience of many nations\r\nhas proven that it may be impossible in periods of great emergency.\r\nIn such events the public faith demands that the customs duties\r\nshall be collected in coin and paid to the public creditors, and\r\nthis pledge should never be violated or our ability to perform it\r\nendangered.\r\n\r\n\"Heretofore, the treasury, in the disbursement of currency, has\r\npaid out bills of any denomination desired.  In this way the number\r\nof bills of a less denomination than five dollars is determined by\r\nthe demand for them.  Such would appear to be the true policy after\r\nthe 1st of January.  It has been urged that, with a view to place\r\nin circulation silver coins, no bills of less than five dollars\r\nshould be issued.  It would seem to be more just and expedient not\r\nto force any form of money upon a public creditor, but to give him\r\nthe option of the kind and denomination.  The convenience of the\r\npublic, in this respect, should be consulted.  The only way by\r\nwhich moneys of different kinds and intrinsic values can be maintained\r\nin circulation at par with each other is by the ability, when one\r\nkind is in excess, to readily exchange it for the other.  This\r\nprinciple is applicable to coin as well as to paper money.  In this\r\nway the largest amount of money of different kinds can be maintained\r\nat par, the different purposes for which each is issued making a\r\ndemand for it.  The refusal or neglect to maintain this species of\r\nredemption inevitably effects the exclusion from circulation of\r\nthe most valuable, which, thereafter, becomes a commodity, bought\r\nand sold at a premium. . . .\r\n\r\n\"When the resumption act passed, gold was the only coin which by\r\nlaw was a legal tender in payment of all debts.  That act contemplated\r\nresumption in gold coin only.  No silver coin of full legal tender\r\ncould then be lawfully issued.  The only silver coin provided was\r\nfractional coin, which was a legal tender for five dollars only.\r\nThe act approved February 28, 1878, made a very important change\r\nin our coinage system.  The silver dollar provided for was made a\r\nlegal tender for all debts, public and private, except where\r\notherwise expressly stipulated in the contract.\r\n\r\n\"The law itself clearly shows that the silver dollar was not to\r\nsupersede the gold dollar; nor did Congress propose to adopt the\r\nsingle standard of silver, but only to create a bimetallic standard\r\nof silver and gold, of equal value and equal purchasing power.\r\nCongress, therefore, limited the amount of silver dollars to be\r\ncoined to not less than two millions nor more than four millions\r\nper month, but did not limit the aggregate amount nor the period\r\nof time during which this coinage should continue.  The market\r\nvalue of the silver in the dollar, at the date of the passage of\r\nthe act, was 93¼ cents in gold coin.  Now it is about 86 cents in\r\ngold coin.  If it was intended by Congress to adopt the silver\r\ninstead of the gold standard, the amount provided for is totally\r\ninadequate for the purpose.  Experience not only in this country,\r\nbut in European countries, has established that a certain amount\r\nof silver coin may be maintained in circulation at par with gold,\r\nthough of less intrinsic bullion value.  It was, no doubt, the\r\nintention of Congress to provide a coin in silver which would answer\r\na multitude of the purposes of business life, without banishing\r\nfrom circulation the established gold coin of the country.  To\r\naccomplish this it is indispensable either that the silver coin be\r\nlimited in amount, or that its bullion value be equal to that of\r\nthe gold dollar.  If not, it use will be limited to domestic\r\npurposes.  It cannot be exported except at its commercial value as\r\nbullion.  If issued in excess of demands for domestic purposes, it\r\nwill necessarily fall in market value, and, by a well-known principle\r\nof finance, will become the sole coin standard of value.  Gold will\r\nbe either hoarded or exported.  When two currencies, both legal,\r\nare authorized without limit, the cheaper alone will circulate.\r\nIf, however, the issue of the silver dollars is limited to an amount\r\ndemanded for circulation, there will be no depreciation, and their\r\nconvenient use will keep them at par with gold, as fractional silver\r\ncoin, issued under the act approved February 21, 1853, was kept at\r\npar with gold.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of such coin that can thus be maintained at par with\r\ngold cannot be fairly tested until resumption is accomplished.  As\r\nyet paper money has been depreciated, and silver dollars, being\r\nreceivable for customs dues, have naturally not entered into general\r\ncirculation, but have returned to the treasury in payment of such\r\ndues, and thus the only effect of the attempt of the department to\r\ncirculate them has been to diminish the gold revenue.  After\r\nresumption these coins will circulate in considerable sums for\r\nsmall payments.  To the extent that such demand will give employment\r\nto silver dollars their use will be an aid to resumption rather\r\nthan a hindrance, but, if issued in excess of such demand, they\r\nwill at once tend to displace gold and become the sole standard,\r\nand gradually, as they increase in number, will fall to their value\r\nas bullion.  Even the fear or suspicion of such an excess tends to\r\nbanish gold, and, if well established, will cause a continuous\r\ndrain of gold until imperative necessity will compel resumption in\r\nsilver alone.  The serious effect of such a radical change in our\r\nstandards of value cannot be exaggerated; and its possibility will\r\ngreatly disturb confidence in resumption, and may make necessary\r\nlarge reserves and further sales of bonds.\r\n\r\n\"The secretary, therefore, earnestly invokes the attention of\r\nCongress to this subject, with a view that either during the present\r\nor the next session the amount of silver dollars to be issued be\r\nlimited, or their ratio to gold for coining purposes be changed.\r\n\r\n\"Gold and silver have varied in value from time to time in the\r\nhistory of nations, and laws have been passed to meet this changing\r\nvalue.  In our country, by the act of April 2, 1792, the ratio\r\nbetween them was fixed at one of gold to fifteen of silver.  By\r\nthe act of June 28, 1834, the ratio was changed to one of gold to\r\nsixteen of silver.  For more than a century the market value of\r\nthe two metals had varied between these two ratios, mainly resting\r\nat that fixed by the Latin nations of one to fifteen and a half.\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot overlook the fact that within a few years, from\r\ncauses frequently discussed in Congress, a great change has occurred\r\nin the relative value of the two metals.  It would seem to be\r\nexpedient to recognize this controlling fact--one that no nation\r\nalone can change--by a careful readjustment of the legal ratio for\r\ncoinage of one to sixteen, so as to conform to the relative market\r\nvalues of the two metals.  The ratios heretofore fixed were always\r\nmade with that view, and, when made, did conform as near as might\r\nbe.  Now, that the production and use of the two metals have greatly\r\nchanged in relative value, a corresponding change must be made in\r\nthe coinage ratio.  There is no peculiar force or sanction in the\r\npresent ratio that should make us hesitate to adopt another, when,\r\nin the markets of the world, it is proven that such ratio is not\r\nnow the true one.  The addition of one-tenth or one-eighth to the\r\nthickness of the silver dollar would scarcely be perceived as an\r\ninconvenience by the holder, but would inspire confidence, and add\r\ngreatly to its circulation.  As prices are now based on United\r\nStates notes at par with gold, no disturbance of values would result\r\nfrom the change.\r\n\r\n\"It appears, from the recent conference at Paris, invited by us,\r\nthat other nations will not join with us in fixing an international\r\nratio, and that each county must adapt its laws to its own policy.\r\nThe tendency of late among commercial nations is to the adoption\r\nof a single standard of gold and the issue of silver for fractional\r\ncoin.  We may, by ignoring this tendency, give temporarily increased\r\nvalue to the stores of silver held in Germany and France, until\r\nour market absorbs them, but, by adopting a silver standard as\r\nnearly equal to gold as practicable, we make a market for our large\r\nproduction of silver, and furnish a full, honest dollar that will\r\nbe hoarded, transported, or circulated, without disparagement or\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\"It is respectfully submitted that the United States, already so\r\nlargely interested in trade with all parts of the world, and\r\nbecoming, by its population, wealth, commerce, and productions, a\r\nleading member of the family of nations, should not adopt a standard\r\nof less intrinsic value than other commercial nations.  Alike\r\ninterested in silver and gold, as the great producing country of\r\nboth, it should coin them at such a ratio and on such conditions\r\nas will secure the largest use and circulation of both metals\r\nwithout displacing either.  Gold must necessarily be the standard\r\nof value in great transactions, from its greater relative value,\r\nbut it is not capable of the division required for small transactions;\r\nwhile silver is indispensable for a multitude of daily wants, and\r\nis too bulky for use in the larger transactions of business, and\r\nthe cost of its transportation for long distances would greatly\r\nincrease the present rates of exchange.  It would, therefore, seem\r\nto be the best policy for the present to limit the aggregate issue\r\nof our silver dollars, based on the ratio of sixteen to one, to\r\nsuch sums as can clearly be maintained at par with gold, until the\r\nprice of silver in the market shall assume a definite ratio to\r\ngold, when that ratio should be adopted, and our coins made to\r\nconform to it; and the secretary respectfully recommends that he\r\nbe authorized to discontinue the coinage of the silver dollar when\r\nthe amount outstanding shall exceed fifty million dollars.\r\n\r\n\"The secretary deems it proper to state that in the meantime, in\r\nthe execution of the law as it now stands, he will feel it to be\r\nhis duty to redeem all United States notes presented on and after\r\nJanuary 1, next, at the office of the assistant treasurer of the\r\nUnited States, in the city of New York, in sums of not less than\r\nfifty dollars, with either gold or silver coin, as desired by the\r\nholder, but reserving the legal option of the government; and to\r\npay out United States notes for all other demands on the treasury,\r\nexcept when coin is demanded on coin liabilities.\r\n\r\n\"It is his duty, as an executive officer, to frankly state his\r\nopinions, so that if he is in error Congress may prescribe such a\r\npolicy as is best for the public interests.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of four per cent. bonds sold during the present year,\r\nprior to November 23, is $100,270,900, of which $94,770,900 were\r\nsold under the refunding act approved July 14, 1870.  Six per cent.\r\nbonds, commonly known as 5-20's, to an equal amount, have been\r\nredeemed, or will be redeemed as calls mature.  This beneficial\r\nprocess was greatly retarded by the requirement of the law that\r\nsubscriptions must be paid in coin, the inconvenience of obtaining\r\nwhich, to the great body of people outside of the large cities,\r\ndeterred many sales.  This will not affect sales after resumption,\r\nwhen bonds can be paid for with United States notes.  The large\r\nabsorption of United States securities in the American market, by\r\nreason of their return from Europe, together with the sale of four\r\nand a half per cent. bonds for resumption purposes, tended to retard\r\nthe sale of four per cent. bonds.  As, from the best advices, not\r\nmore than $200,000,000 of United States bonds are now held out of\r\nthe country, it may be fairly anticipated that the sale of four\r\nper cent. bonds, hereafter, will largely increase.\r\n\r\n\"Prior to May, 1877, United States bonds were mainly sold through\r\nan association of bankers.  Experience proves that under the present\r\nplan of selling to all subscribers on terms fixed by public\r\nadvertisement, though the aggregate of sales may be less, their\r\ndistribution is more satisfactory.  Under a popular loan the interest\r\nis paid at home, and the investment is available at all times,\r\nwithout loss, to meet the needs of the holder.  This policy has\r\nbeen carefully fostered by other nations, and should be specially\r\nso in ours, where every citizen equally participates in the government\r\nof his country.  The holding of these bonds at home, in small sums\r\nwell distributed, is of great importance in enlisting popular\r\ninterest in our national credit and in encouraging habits of thrift,\r\nand such holding in the country is far more stable and less likely\r\nto disturb the market than it would be in cities or by corporations,\r\nwhere the bonds can be promptly sold in quantities.\r\n\r\n\"The three months' public notes required by the fourth section of\r\nthe refunding act, to be given to holders of the 5-20 bonds to be\r\nredeemed, necessarily involve a loss to the government by the\r\npayment of double interest during that time.  The notice should\r\nnot be given until subscriptions are made or are reasonably certain\r\nto be made.  When they are made and the money is paid into the\r\ntreasury, whether it is kept there idle during the three months or\r\ndeposited with national banks under existing law, the government\r\nnot only pays interest on both classes of bonds during the ninety\r\ndays, but, if the sales are large, the hoarding of large sums may\r\ndisturb the market.  Under existing law this is unavoidable; and,\r\nto mitigate it, the secretary deemed it expedient during the last\r\nsummer to make calls in anticipation of subscriptions, but this,\r\nthough legal, might, in case of failure of subscriptions, embarrass\r\nthe government in paying called bonds.  The long notice required\r\nby law is not necessary in the interest of the holder of the bonds,\r\nfor, as the calls are made by public notice and the bonds are\r\nindicated and specified by class, date, and number, in the order\r\nof their numbers and issue, he, by ordinary diligence, can know\r\nbeforehand when his bonds in due course will probably be called,\r\nand will not be taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"The secretary therefore recommends that the notice to be given\r\nfor called bonds be, at his discretion, not less than ten days nor\r\nmore than three months.  In this way he will be able largely to\r\navoid the payment of double interest, as well as the temporary\r\ncontraction of the currency, and may fix the maturity of the call\r\nat a time when the interest of the called bonds becomes due and\r\npayable.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the act authorizing the coinage of the\r\nstandard silver dollar, and an attempt being made to procure the\r\nrequisite bullion for its coinage to some extent at the mints on\r\nthe Pacific coast, it was found that the producers and dealers\r\nthere would not sell silver to the government at the equivalent of\r\nthe London rate, but demanded in addition thereto an amount equal\r\nto the cost of bringing it from London and laying it down in San\r\nFrancisco.  These terms, being deemed exorbitant, were rejected,\r\nand arrangements were immediately made to bring the capacity of\r\nthe mint at Philadelphia to its maximum, with a view to meet the\r\nprovisions of law, which required two millions of silver dollars\r\nto be coined in each month, and the available supplies of silver\r\nfrom domestic sources being entirely insufficient for the coinage\r\nof this amount, the foreign market was indirectly resorted to and\r\nan amount sufficient to meet the requirements of law secured.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1878, the principal holders of bullion on the Pacific\r\ncoast receded from their position and accepted the equivalent of\r\nthe London rate, at which price sufficient bullion was purchased\r\nto employ the mints of San Francisco and Carson on the coinage of\r\nthe dollar.\r\n\r\nAt the date of my report, United States notes were practically at\r\npar with gold.  The public mind had settled into a conviction that\r\nthe parity of coin and currency was assured, and our people,\r\naccustomed to the convenience of paper money, would not willingly\r\nhave received coin to any considerable amount in any business\r\ntransactions.  The minor coins of silver, were received and paid\r\nout without question at parity with gold coin, because the amount\r\nwas limited and they were coined by the government only as demanded\r\nfor the public convenience.  The silver dollar was too weighty and\r\ncumbersome and when offered in considerable sums was objected to,\r\nthough a legal tender for any sum, and coined only in limited\r\namounts for government account.  Every effort was made by the\r\ntreasury department to give it the largest circulation, but the\r\nhighest amount that could be circulated was from fifty to sixty\r\nmillions, and much of this was in the southern states.  All sums\r\nin excess of that were returned to the treasury for silver\r\ncertificates.  These were circulated as money, like United States\r\nnotes and bank bills.  This was only possible by the guarantee of\r\nthe government that all forms of money would be maintained at parity\r\nwith each other.  If this guarantee had been doubted, or if the\r\nholder of silver bullion could have had it coined at his pleasure\r\nand for his benefit at the ratio of sixteen to one, the silver\r\ndollar would, as the cheaper coin, have excluded all other forms\r\nof money, and the purchasing power of silver coin would have been\r\nreduced to the market value of silver bullion.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of December, 1878, I wrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"Hon. Thomas Hillhouse,\r\n\r\n  \"United States Assistant Treasurer, New York.\r\n\"Sir:--I have this day telegraphed you as follows:\r\n\r\n'After receipt of this you will please issue no more gold\r\ncertificates.'\r\n\r\n\"In compliance with the above instructions you will not, until\r\nfurther advised, issue gold certificates either in payment of\r\ninterest on the public debt or for gold coin deposited.\r\n\r\n\"It is desired that you issue currency in payment of coin obligations\r\nto such an amount as will be accepted by public creditors.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nAfter resumption, United States notes were in fact gold certificates,\r\nbeing redeemable in coin.  On the 4th, I again wrote to General\r\nHillhouse as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your letter of yesterday is received.  The necessity of the recent\r\norder about coin certificates became apparent to the department,\r\nand the only doubt was as to the date of issuing it.  After full\r\nconsideration, it was deemed best to make it immediate, so that no\r\nmore certificates could be asked for.  By the 21st of this month\r\nthe large denominations of greenbacks will be ready for issue to\r\nyou, and after the 1st of January they will be received for customs\r\nduties and paid out for gold coin deposited with you.

The issue\r\nof gold certificates, however convenient to the public, had long\r\nceased to be of any advantage to the government, and in view of\r\nresumption it had become a positive injury, by enabling speculators\r\nto carry on their operations without the risk and expense of handling\r\nthe actual coin.  So far as I have discovered, the banks and the\r\nbusiness community generally regard the withdrawal of the certificates\r\nas a wise measure.  They may be put to some temporary inconvenience\r\nthereby, but they cannot fail to see that, in the use of this and\r\nall other legitimate means of making the great scheme of resumption\r\na success, the secretary is really promoting their interests, and\r\nthat in the end they will be greatly benefitted by the establishing\r\nof a sound and stable currency, which is the object in view.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"Thomas Hillhouse,\r\n  \"Assistant Treasurer United States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th I wrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, inquiring whether you\r\nare at liberty to pay out the standard silver dollars in exchange\r\nfor gold coin, you are authorized to pay out the standard silver\r\ndollars to any amount which may be desired in exchange for gold\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"In reply to your letter of yesterday, I have to advise you that\r\nit was the purpose of the order referred to to prohibit the issue\r\nof gold coin certificates for any purpose, including the redemption\r\nof called bonds.

I do not see my way clear\r\nto issue another call until the one now outstanding is covered by\r\nsubscription.  There is still a deficit of about $4,000,000 on the\r\n71st call.  There is not, however, the slightest objection to your\r\nstating authoritatively, or, if desired, I will do so in response\r\nto a direct inquiry, that every dollar of the proceeds of four per\r\ncent. bonds sold during the present year had been applied on calls\r\nfor refunding, and it is my purpose to continue this unless I give\r\npublic notice to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\"I feel the more inclined to refuse to make a call by reason of\r\nthe probable requisition that may be made for the Halifax award,\r\nand I do not wish by any chance to impair the resumption fund.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of December the air was full of rumors of\r\na combination in New York for a run upon the sub-treasury on the\r\nopening of the new year.  The alarm was so great that the president\r\nof the National Bank of Commerce in that city, who was also chairman\r\nof the clearing house committee, at three o'clock p. m. on the\r\n30th, with the advice of other bankers, sent me, by special messenger,\r\nan urgent request for the transfer to his bank, on the following\r\nday, from the sub-treasury, of $5,000,000 in gold, in exchange for\r\na like amount in United States notes, to enable the banks, he said,\r\nto meet a \"corner\" in gold.  To this there could be but one reply.\r\nThe treasury had no power to make the transfer, even if it desired\r\nto do so.  I therefore declined the proposition, and did not believe\r\nin a \"corner.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the exciting events connected with resumption and refunding\r\nI did not overlook the political condition in Ohio, and wrote a\r\nletter in regard to it, which I think proper here to insert, as it\r\npresents my view at its date:\r\n\r\n  \"December 26, 1878.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Much obliged for your kind letter of the 21st.\r\n\r\n\"My official duties engross my time so much that I scarcely catch\r\na glimpse of home affairs by reading the newspapers, and your\r\nintelligent view is therefore the more interesting.  It seems to\r\nme that the nomination of General Garfield for governor and Foster\r\nfor lieutenant governor would be a very excellent arrangement, but\r\nI understand that it is not agreeable to them.  Garfield has no\r\ndesire for the position, while Foster feels that he ought to head\r\nthe ticket.  An understanding that Garfield is to be Senator might\r\nembarrass us in certain doubtful districts, where the chief contest\r\nwould be upon that office.  Still such a ticket would be universally\r\nconceded to be very strong and would inspire confidence, and would\r\nbe entirely satisfactory to me.  Indeed, I wish to be in a condition\r\nto support our political friends in anything they may do in the\r\nconvention, without taking an active part in it.\r\n\r\n\"The contingency that you refer to with which my name is connected\r\nis still to remote to talk about.  I never supposed that a person\r\noccupying my office, open to attack and compelled to say no to so\r\nmany persons, could be sufficiently popular to justify any party\r\nin running him for the presidency, and, therefore, I have always\r\ndismissed such suggestions as the kindly compliments of the hour.\r\nCertainly it has not gained my mental consent, nor is it considered\r\nby me as one of the probabilities of the future.  If I should get\r\nthe maggot in my brain it would no doubt be more likely to hurt\r\nthan help.\r\n\r\n\"The tendency of public opinion is evidently towards General Grant,\r\nwhose absence and good conduct are in his favor, while the involuntary\r\nfeeling of Republicans would be in favor of nominating him as a\r\nremonstrance against the violence in the south, and notice that it\r\nmust end.\r\n\r\n\"However, a year hence will be time enough to settle this matter.\r\n\r\n\"I send my hearty greetings for the holiday season, and remain,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon.

Morton and Others--\r\nSix per Cent. Bonds Aggregating $120,000,000 Called During January,\r\n1879--The Sale in London--Charges of Favoritism--Further Enactments\r\nto Facilitate the Funding--Difficulty of Making Sales of Four per\r\nCent. Bonds to English Bankers--Large Amounts Taken in the United\r\nStates--One Subscription of $190,000,000--Rothschild's Odd Claim--\r\nComplimentary Resolution of the New York Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1879, when the resumption act went into\r\neffect, the aggregate amount of gold coin and bullion in the treasury\r\nexceeded $140,000,000.  United States notes, when presented, were\r\nredeemed with gold coin, but instead of the notes being presented\r\nfor redemption, gold coin in exchange for them was deposited, thus\r\nincreasing the gold in the treasury.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of specie payments was generally accepted as a\r\nfortunate event by the great body of people of the United States,\r\nbut there was a great diversity of opinion as to what was meant by\r\nresumption.  The commercial and banking classes generally treated\r\nresumption as if it involved the payment and cancellation of United\r\nStates notes and all forms of government money except coin and bank\r\nnotes.  Another class was opposed to resumption, and favored a\r\nlarge issue of paper money without any promise or expectation of\r\nredemption in coin.  The body of the people, I believe, agreed with\r\nme in opinion that resumption meant, not the cancellation and\r\nwithdrawal of greenbacks, but the bringing them up to par and\r\nmaintaining them as the equivalent of coin by the payment of them\r\nin coin on demand by the holder.  This was my definition of\r\nresumption.  I do not believe that any commercial nation can conduct\r\nmodern operations of business upon the basis of coin alone.  Prior\r\nto our Civil War the United States undertook to collect its taxes\r\nin specie and to pay specie for its obligations; this was the\r\nbullion theory.  This narrow view of money compelled the states to\r\nsupply paper currency, and this led to a great diversity of money,\r\ndepending upon the credit, the habits and the wants of the people\r\nof the different states.  The United States notes, commonly called\r\ngreenbacks, were the creature of necessity, but proved a great\r\nblessing, and only needed one attribute to make them the best\r\nsubstitute for coin money that has ever been devised.  That quality\r\nwas supplied by their redemption in coin, when demanded by the\r\nholder.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in the treasury department on the day of resumption is\r\nthus described by J. K. Upton, assistant secretary, in an article\r\nwritten at the close of 1892:\r\n\r\n\"The year, however, closed with no unpleasant excitement, but with\r\nunpleasant forebodings.  The 1st day of January was Sunday and no\r\nbusiness was transacted.  On Monday anxiety reigned in the office\r\nof the secretary.  Hour after hour passed; no news came from New\r\nYork.  Inquiry by wire showed all was quiet.  At the close of\r\nbusiness came this message:  '$135,000 of notes presented for coin\r\n--$400,000 of gold for notes.'  That was all.  Resumption was\r\naccomplished with no disturbance.  By five o'clock the news was\r\nall over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their tea\r\nin absolute safety.\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen years have since passed, and the redemption fund still\r\nremains intact in the sub-treasury vaults.  The prediction of the\r\nsecretary has become history.  When gold could with certainty be\r\nobtained for notes, nobody wanted it.  The experiment of maintaining\r\na limited amount of United States notes in circulation, based upon\r\na reasonable reserve in the treasury pledged for that purpose, and\r\nsupported also by the credit of the government, has proved generally\r\nsatisfactory, and the exclusive use of these notes for circulation\r\nmay become, in time, the fixed financial policy of the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of resumption of specie payments was to advance\r\nthe public credit, which made it possible to rapidly fund all the\r\nbonds of the United States then redeemable into bonds bearing four\r\nper cent. interest.  Early in January, 1879, I issued a circular\r\noffering the four per cent. funded loan of the United States at\r\npar and accrued interest to date of subscription in coin.  It was\r\nsubstantially similar to the one issued on the 16th of January,\r\n1878, but graded the commission, allowing from one-eighth of one\r\nper cent. to one-fourth of one per cent., according to the amount\r\nsubscribed.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters written about this date will show my view better\r\nthan anything I can say now:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., January 6, 1879.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your note of the 2nd was received upon my return from\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged for subscription, and hope that you will soon get\r\nabove the ten millions and thus be entitled to the additional one-\r\ntenth.  I cannot, however, allow it on the first ten millions\r\nwithout adopting it as a rule, which would be impossible, by reason\r\nof the limitation of the entire cost to one-half of one per cent.\r\nI may be compelled to allow the one-eighth commission down to\r\n$1,000, but perhaps not, as I have to carefully husband the limited\r\nfund out of which all expenses must be paid.  With the energy and\r\nhopefulness now exhibited, we can easily refund the 5-20's within\r\nthis year and, perhaps, within six months.  The more rapid the\r\nprocess the less disturbance it will create.  I am hopeful and\r\nsanguine of improving business, not that greenbacks will be so\r\nabundant, but that employment will be ready for everyone willing\r\nto work.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for your congratulations, which I heartily reciprocate,\r\nfor the syndicate are entitled to a large portion of the merit now\r\ngiven to me.  As I got more than my share of the abuse, it is\r\nprobably thought that I should get more than my share of the credit.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. L. P. Morton, New York.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., January 8, 1879.\r\n\"R. C. Stone, Esq., Secretary Bullion Club, New York.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 5th inst., inclosing a card of\r\ninvitation from the Bullion Club, to attend a dinner at their club\r\nhouse on Thursday evening, the 16th inst., is received.\r\n\r\n\"I regret that my official duties will not permit me, in person,\r\nto respond to the toast you send me, and I cannot do so, by letter,\r\nin words more expressive than the toast itself, 'To Resumption--\r\nmay it be forever.'\r\n\r\n\"Irredeemable money is always the result of war, pestilence, or\r\nsome great misfortune.  A nation would not, except in dire necessity,\r\nissue its promises to pay money when it is unable to redeem those\r\npromises.  I know that when the legal tenders were first issued,\r\nin February, 1862, we were under a dire necessity.  The doubt that\r\nprevented several influential Senators, like Fessenden and Collamer,\r\nfrom voting for the legal tender clause, was that they were not\r\nconvinced that our necessities were so extreme as to demand the\r\nissue of irredeemable paper money.  Most of those who voted for it\r\njustified their vote upon the ground that the very existence of\r\nthe country depended upon its ability to coin into money its promises\r\nto pay. THat was the position taken by me.  We were assured by\r\nSecretary Chase that nearly one hundred millions of unpaid requisitions\r\nwere lying upon his table, for money due to soldiers in the presence\r\nof the enemy, and for food and clothing to maintain them at the\r\nfront.  We then provided for the issue of legal tender United States\r\nnotes, as an extreme remedy in the nation's peril.  It has always\r\nseemed strange that so large and respectable a body of our fellow-\r\ncitizens should regard the continuance of irredeemable money as\r\nthe permanent policy of a nation so strong and rich as ours, able\r\nto pay every dollar of its debts on demand, after the causes of\r\nits issue had disappeared.  To resume is to recover from illness,\r\nto escape danger, to stand sound and healthy in the financial world,\r\nwith our currency based upon the intrinsic value of solid coin.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I say, may resumption be perpetual.  To wish otherwise\r\nis to hope for war, danger, and national peril, calamities to which\r\nour nation, like others, may be subject, but against which the\r\nearnest aspiration of every patriot will be uttered.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"January 10, 1879.\r\n\"H.

Indeed,\r\nI am glad you are buying from the market rather than from the\r\ndepartment.  I do not wish to force this refunding operation too\r\nmuch, lest it may embarrass resumption.  I only fear that some\r\neager parties may subscribe for more than they can sell and pay\r\nfor by called bonds or coin within the running of the call.  This\r\nis the only contingency that disturbs me.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nMy published correspondence shows that with all the efforts and\r\nstrength of the department it was impossible to keep up with the\r\nsubscriptions for bonds pouring in from all parts of the United\r\nStates and from Europe.  Over sixty millions were subscribed for\r\nin the first two weeks of January.  Offers made by me in December,\r\nthough not accepted at the time, were made the grounds of demands\r\nin January, when conditions had greatly changed.  As the money\r\nreceived for four per cent. bonds could not be applied to the\r\npayment of six per cent. called bonds until interest on such bonds\r\nceased, ninety days after the call, I feared that the enormous\r\ndeposits would create a serious stringency in the money market,\r\nand perhaps cause a panic after the first of April.  The banks and\r\nbankers in New York, as well as in other large cities of the United\r\nStates, were actively competing to swell these subscriptions, so\r\nas to get the larger commission offered for the greater amount of\r\nbonds sold.  Such a contest occurred between the First National\r\nBank of New York, and Seligman & Co., and their associates.  In\r\nended in a contract made on the 21st of January, between the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and the former syndicate, by which the\r\nlatter subscribed for $10,000,000 of four per cent. bonds, on the\r\nterms stated in my circular of January 1, and $5,000,000 a month\r\nthereafter, the secretary reserving the power to terminate the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nOn the same day a call was made for $20,000,000 of six per cent.\r\nbonds.  Another call for a like amount was made on the 28th.  The\r\naggregate call for six per cent. bonds in January was $120,000,000.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Conant was again appointed as the funding agent of the\r\ntreasury department, and directed to assume the general management\r\nand supervision of all business in London arising from the funding\r\nof bonds.  He was instructed to advise me frequently as to the\r\ncondition of the business intrusted to him.\r\n\r\nThe object of this sale of bonds in London was stated in the public\r\nprints, and also in the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, January 22, 1879.\r\n\"Charles M. Fry, Esq.,\r\n  \"President Bank of New York, National Banking Association, New\r\n    York.\r\n\"Sir:--Your telegram was received yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"The syndicate arrangement was confined to the sale of bonds in\r\nEurope, where it is deemed important to sell bonds partly to cover\r\ncalled bonds held abroad; and a contract has been made with bankers\r\nhaving houses in London, on precisely the same terms as were extended\r\nto all in this country.  It was thought that this would be best\r\nfor the domestic loan.  No contract of arrangement will be made to\r\ninterfere in any way with the free, open, popular subscriptions in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to notice your success and will give you every facility\r\nthat is extended to anyone else.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe sale in London was fully justified when the called bonds matured,\r\nand those held abroad were paid for without the exportation of\r\ncoin.  It was my desire to secure the exchange of four per cent.\r\nbonds directly with the holders of the six per cents.  For this\r\npurpose I invited, by a department order widely circulated, such\r\nan exchange, allowing to the holder of any six per cent. bond,\r\nwhether called or uncalled, the same commission and allowance for\r\ninterest granted to banks and bankers.  By these expedients I hoped\r\nfor, and succeeded in conducting, the change of bonds without\r\ndisturbing the ordinary current of business.\r\n\r\nThe process of refunding the 5-20 six per cent. bonds, by the sale\r\nof four per cent. bonds, went on with some fluctuations until the\r\n4th of April, 1879, when all the six per cent. bonds then redeemable\r\nwere called for payment.  This period in the magnitude of business\r\ndone was far the most active and important while I was Secretary\r\nof the Treasury.  The struggle between banks and bankers, not only\r\nin the United States but in London also, gave rise to many questions\r\nwhich had to be promptly acted upon, chiefly by cable or telegram.\r\nThe amount involved were so large as to induce caution and care.\r\nThe principal difficulty in refunding arose out of the provision\r\nin the act of Congress that ninety days' notice should be given,\r\nto the holder of bonds, by the government, when it exercised its\r\noption to pay, after five years, any portion of the bonds known as\r\nthe 5-20 bonds, payable in twenty years but redeemable after five\r\nyears.  Prudence required the actual sale of four per cent. bonds\r\nbefore a call could be made or notice given to the holders of the\r\n5-20 bonds, designated by description and numbers, of the intention\r\nof the government to pay them.  When sales were made the money\r\nreceived was deposited in the treasury of the United States, or\r\nwith national banks acting as public depositaries, which were\r\nrequired to give security for such deposits.\r\n\r\nThe necessary effort of the deposit of large amount involved in\r\nrefunding operations was to create a stringency in the money market.\r\nI early called the attention of Congress to this difficulty, but\r\nhad doubts whether the government would be justified in repealing\r\nthe law requiring ninety days' notice.  This provision was a part\r\nof the contract between the government and the bondholder, and\r\ncould only be changed by the consent of both parties.  Congress\r\nfailed to act upon my suggestion.  The interest accruing for ninety\r\ndays at six per cent., or one and a half per cent. on the great\r\nsums involved, was a loss to the government but a gain to the banks\r\nor bankers that sold the bonds.  The syndicate of bankers engaged\r\nin the sale of bonds chose the First National Bank of New York as\r\ntheir depositary.  The department was indifferent where the deposits\r\nwere made so that they were amply secured.  Other banks and bankers\r\nengaged in the sale of bonds chose their own depositaries, and thus\r\nan active competition was created in which the department took no\r\npart or interest.\r\n\r\nThis struggle led to charges of favoritism on the part of the\r\ndepartment, but they were without the slightest foundation.  Every\r\norder, ruling and letter was fully discussed and considered by the\r\nSecretary and other chief officers of the treasury, and also by\r\nGeneral Hillhouse, assistant treasurer at New York, and is in the\r\nprinted report of the letters, contracts, circulars and accounts\r\nrelating to resumption and refunding made to Congress on the 2nd\r\nof December, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe charge was especially made that favor was shown the First\r\nNational Bank of New York, of which George F. Baker was president\r\nand H. C. Fahnestock was vice president.  It was said that I was\r\na stockholder in that bank, and that I was interested in the\r\nsyndicate.  It is scarcely necessary for me to say, as I do, that\r\nthese charges and imputations were absolutely false.  This bank\r\nand the associated bankers sold larger amounts of four per cent.\r\nbonds than any others and received a corresponding commission, but,\r\ninstead of being favored, they were constantly complaining of the\r\nseverity of the treasury restrictions.  Rothschild, the head of\r\nthe great banking house in London and the chief of the syndicate,\r\nespecially complained of what he called the \"stinginess\" of the\r\ntreasury department.  I can say for all the officers of the treasury\r\nthat not one of them was interested in transactions growing out of\r\nresumption or refunding, or did or could derive any benefit\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nThe rapid payment of the 5-20 bonds had a more serious effect upon\r\nthe English market than upon our own.  Here the four per cent.\r\nbonds were received in place of the six per cent. bonds, no doubt\r\nwith regret by the holders of the latter for the loss of one-third\r\nof their interest, but accompanied by a sense of national pride\r\nthat our credit was so good.  In London the process of refunding\r\nwas regarded with disfavor and in some cases by denunciation.  On\r\nthe 4th of March Secretary Evarts wrote me the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Department of State,      }\r\n  \"Washington, March 4, 1870.}\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--I have the honor to transmit herewith, for your information,\r\na copy of a dispatch No. 928, dated February 12, from the consul\r\ngeneral at London, in which the department is advised that there\r\nexists dissatisfaction, among certain holders of the 5-20 bonds of\r\nthe issue of 1867, with the rapidity with which the government is\r\nrefunding its debt at a lower rate of interest, and that it is the\r\npurpose of such holders to demand payment of their called bonds in\r\ncoin.  I have to honor to be, sir, your obedient servant.\r\n\r\n  \"Wm. M. Evarts.\"\r\n\r\nThis demand was easily met by the sale of four per cent. bonds in\r\nLondon, and the balance of trade in our favor was increasing.  The\r\nanticipated movement of gold did not occur.\r\n\r\nCongress, by the act approved January 25, 1879, extended the process\r\nof refunding to the 10-40 bonds bearing interest at the rate of\r\nfive per cent., amounting to $195,000,000 as follows:\r\n\r\n\"AN ACT TO FACILITATE THE REFUNDING THE NATIONAL DEBT.\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury is hereby authorized, in the process of refunding\r\nthe national debt under existing laws, to exchange directly at par\r\nthe bonds of the United States bearing interest at four per centum\r\nper annum, authorized by law, for the bonds of the United States\r\ncommonly known as 5-20's, outstanding and uncalled, and, whenever\r\nall such 5-20 bonds shall have been redeemed, the provisions of\r\nthis section, and all existing provisions of law authorizing the\r\nrefunding of the national debt, shall apply to any bonds of the\r\nUnited States bearing interest at five per centum per annum or a\r\nhigher rate, which may be redeemable.  In any exchange made under\r\nthe provisions of this section interest may be allowed, on the\r\nbonds redeemed, for a period of three months.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February the following act was passed:\r\n\r\n\"AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE ISSUE OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT IN AID\r\n  OF THE REFUNDING OF THE PUBLIC DEBT.\r\n\r\n\"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed to issue, in\r\nexchange for lawful money of the United States that may be presented\r\nfor such exchange, certificates of deposit, of the denominations\r\nof ten dollars, bearing interest at the rate of four per centum\r\nper annum, and convertible at any time, with accrued interest, into\r\nthe four per centum bonds described in the refunding act; and the\r\nmoney so received shall be applied only to the payment of the bonds\r\nbearing interest at a rate of not less than five per centum in the\r\nmode prescribed by said act, and he is authorized to prescribe\r\nsuitable rules and regulations in conformity with this act.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1879, the amount of uncalled 5-20 six per\r\ncent. bonds outstanding was $88,079,800.  Anticipating that sales\r\nof four per cent. bonds would continue, I gave the following notice:\r\n\r\n\"Notice is given that when the 5-20 six per cent. bonds of the\r\nUnited States are covered by subscriptions to the four per cent.\r\nconsols, the latter will be withdrawn from sale upon the terms\r\nproposed by department circular of January 1, 1879, and upon the\r\nterms stated in the contract with the Messrs. Rothschild and others,\r\nof the date of January 21, 1879.  The amount of 5-20 six per cent.\r\nbonds outstanding and embraced in calls to this date is $88,079,800.\r\nWhen this sum is covered by subscriptions under the existing circular\r\nand contract, all further sales of four per cent. consols, to\r\nprovide for the refunding of the 10-40 five per cent. bonds, will\r\nbe made upon terms which will probably be less favorable to the\r\npurchaser, and in accordance with new proposals and contracts.\r\nThis notice is given so that all parties wishing to subscribe for\r\nconsols upon the terms stated in the circular and contract may have\r\nan opportunity to do so until the 5-20 bonds are called.\"\r\n\r\nIn giving this notice I had in view a change in the mode of refunding\r\nwhich would save to the government the whole or large part of the\r\nthree months' interest pending the call.  This notice gave an\r\nadditional spur to the market for four per cent. bonds.  Copies of\r\nit were sent to Mr. Conant and to all parties interested in pending\r\noperations, and due notice was given to all persons and corporations\r\nengaged in the sale of bonds that all existing contracts would\r\nterminate when the 5-20 bonds were covered by subscriptions.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was a good deal of anxiety as to the effect of\r\nthe large sale of four per cent. bonds.  If these could be exchanged,\r\npar for par for six per cent. bonds, the operation would be easy,\r\nbut many holders of called bonds would not accept the lower rate\r\nof interest and invested the principal of their bonds in other\r\nsecurities.  General Hillhouse, on the 8th of March, expressed the\r\ncommon feeling as follows:\r\n\r\n\"There is a good deal of speculation in the papers, as well as in\r\nbusiness circles, as to the probable effect on the money market of\r\nthe settlements to be made in April, during which month, if I am\r\nnot mistaken, about $150,000,000 of calls will mature.  It is now\r\nseen, however, that investment demand for the fours is much larger\r\nthan was anticipated by many; and the subscribing banks will be,\r\ntherefore, likely to find themselves loaded with large amounts which\r\nthey cannot dispose of.  It would not be strange, in the closing\r\nof such vast transactions, if there should be some stringency, but\r\nwith the favorable indications, that the public are taking the\r\nbonds freely, and with the power of the secretary in various ways\r\nto facilitate the settlements, it can hardly be more than\r\ntemporary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conant wrote me, on March 8, from London:\r\n\r\n\"I have called on all the members of the syndicate several times\r\nwithin the past few days, and have urged them very strongly to push\r\nthe sales of the bonds here.  I have persistently tried to persuade\r\nthem that they ought to conduct the business with far more energy,\r\nand I have said to them that, at the time the contract was entered\r\ninto, representations were made to you that $50,000,000 of the four\r\nper cent. consols could be disposed of on this side of the Atlantic,\r\nand that as they had undertaken the business they should not\r\ndisappoint you.  I have represented to them the importance of\r\npreventing the shipments of gold from New York, and that you supposed\r\nthat the sales of bonds which you expected they would make would\r\nprevent such shipments. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The feeling which I alluded to in my last letter, that when the\r\ntime arrives for the settlement of the large subscriptions made in\r\nNew York and elsewhere at home the market will be found overloaded,\r\nand that a fall in price will take place, still exists here, and\r\nhas the effect of causing certain classes of investors to delay\r\nmaking purchases, which they will ultimately make.  I have not\r\nhesitated to say to the associates here that when refunding operations\r\nshall have been completed the four per cent. consols will soon\r\nthereafter go to a premium, and good reasons can be given why such\r\nshould be the case.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after I commenced receiving prophecies of stringency and\r\ndisaster.  A long letter from Fisk & Hatch, of New York, said that\r\ngeneral apprehension had been growing up in financial circles, and\r\nwas rapidly gaining ground, that the settlements by the national\r\nbanks with the treasury department, in April and May, for the large\r\nsubscriptions of four per cent. bonds made in January and February,\r\nwould occasion serious disturbance and embarrassment in the money\r\nmarket.  They advised me to pursue a course that, whether proper\r\nor not, was not in accordance with law.  Mr. L. P. Morton., on the\r\nsame date, took a milder view of it, but still suggested a remedy\r\nnot within my power.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, General Hillhouse, in referring to the apprehensions\r\nof my correspondents in regard to the settlements in connection\r\nwith refunding, said that they might be caused in some instances\r\nby the suspicion, if not by the conviction, that their subscriptions\r\nhad been carried beyond the point of absolute safety, \"and now that\r\nsettlement day is approaching they are naturally desirous of\r\nascertaining how far they can count on the forbearance of the\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the same view I had taken of the matter.  I did not feel\r\nmyself officially bound to do anything but to require prompt payment\r\nfor the bonds subscribed.  The treasury, however, was well prepared\r\nfor any probable stringency, and I was convinced that the settlements\r\nwould not cause any serious disturbance.  The advices from London\r\ncontinued to be unfavorable.  The bonds were offered in the market\r\nin some cases at a less price than the syndicate were to pay for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the process of selling the four per cent. bonds I had frequently\r\nbeen written to by persons of limited means, who wished to invest\r\ntheir savings in government bonds of small denominations bearing\r\nfour per cent. interest.  I called the attention of the proper\r\ncommittee of each House to the expediency of issuing notes or\r\ncertificates of that description, and the act of February 26, 1879,\r\nalready quoted, was passed.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March I issued a circular relative to these\r\ncertificates, prescribing the manner in which they should be sold,\r\nand stated the purpose and probable effect of their issue, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The primary purpose of these certificates is to enable persons of\r\nlimited means to husband small savings as they accrue, and place\r\nthem where they will draw interest and become the nest egg for\r\nfuture accumulation.  The form of certificate seems better adapted\r\nfor the purpose than the French _ventes_ or the English savings\r\nbank system.  The objection to a national savings bank is that, in\r\na country so extensive as ours, the agencies would necessarily be\r\nscattered, and the cost and delay of correspondence and transferring\r\nmoney to Washington would be considerable; but, more than all, the\r\nUnited States cannot undertake the risk of repaying deposits at\r\nany time when called for.  The necessary reserve for that purpose\r\nwould make the system burdensome.  The certificate, as issued, may,\r\nat the expense of the subscriber, be either to bearer, or, by being\r\nregistered, only transferable by assignment on the books of the\r\ntreasury.  It combines, in the cheapest form, all the benefits of\r\nany system of savings banks that has been devised.  No doubt these\r\ncertificates, when first issued, will, by voluntary consent of\r\nparties, be used as currency; but, after they shall have run a\r\nshort time, the accruing interest on them will induce their sorting\r\nand holding, and thus, like the compound-interest notes, they will\r\ncease to be a currency and become an investment.  Their possible\r\nuse as currency is certainly no objection to them; for, though I\r\nadhere as strictly as anyone to a specie standard of value, I think\r\nthat, it being constantly maintained by ample reserves and prompt\r\nredemption, current money in different forms should be provided\r\nfor daily use.  Diversity of the currency, if it is always redeemable,\r\nis no objection.  These certificates will always be redeemable in\r\nthe bonds stipulated for, and can, with profit, be issued, while\r\nthe money received for them can be used in redeeming bonds bearing\r\na higher rate of interest.  They are of as low a denomination as\r\ncan be conveniently issued and bear interest.  The issue of this\r\ncertificate is a safe experiment.  I have confidence that it will\r\nbe beneficial to the holder, in begetting habits of saving, and to\r\nthe treasury, in aiding refunding; but its great benefit will be\r\nthat the people themselves will in this way have a direct interest\r\nin preserving and maintaining the public faith.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same date I wrote a note for publication to the treasurer\r\nof the United States, to facilitate the payment of called bonds,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"As it is desirable to make payment of called bonds in the mode\r\nthat will least disturb the market, you will draw from the depositary\r\nbanks the proceeds of four per cent. bonds only when required to\r\nmake payment of called bonds, and in proportion from the several\r\ndepositaries to the amounts held by them, as near as may be, in\r\nsums of $1,000.  Money in the treasury received from four per cent.\r\nbonds should be applied to the payment of called bonds before such\r\ndrafts are made.\r\n\r\n\"When practicable, drafts upon depositary banks, for transfers of\r\ndeposits on account of proceeds of four per cent. bonds, may be so\r\ndrawn as to be payable at the option of the bank, through the New\r\nYork clearing house.\r\n\r\n\"Drafts on depositary banks in cities other than New York should\r\nbe drawn a sufficient time in advance to meet payments there.\r\n\r\n\"Payment by called bonds should be treated as payment in money as\r\nof the date when it would, under this order, be required.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th I received from Conant the following cablegram:\r\n\r\n\"Would be pleased to know if subscriptions to be settled during\r\nApril can be expected without disturbing market in New York.\"\r\n\r\nI answered on the same day as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Entirely confident subscriptions during next month will be settled\r\nwithout disturbing market.  Order of the treasury department\r\nyesterday will facilitate greatly.\"\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence with Conant, the syndicate and myself\r\nthen took place:\r\n\r\n  \"London, March 28, 1879.\r\n\"Sherman, Washington.\r\n\r\n\"Rothschild & Sons request me to say they do not consider contract\r\nof January 21, 1879, requires subscription two million to be made\r\nApril 1.

C., England, March 29, 1879.}\r\n\"Dear Mr. Secretary:--On the 27th instant I had the honor to make\r\nan inquiry of you by cable dispatch, as follows:  'Would be pleased\r\nto know if subscriptions to be settled during April can be effected\r\nwithout disturbing market in New York.'  The constant decline in\r\nthe price of all descriptions of our bonds in New York, the strenuous\r\nefforts being made by certain parties to sell American bonds here\r\nat low rates on home account, particularly the four and four and\r\na half per cent. stock, the advancing rates of interest, and the\r\ncondition of the exchanges, together with the rumors concerning\r\nscarcity of money in New Orleans and elsewhere, gave rise to\r\napprehension, in the minds of many, that refunding operations had\r\nbeen carried to too great an extent; that too many bonds had been\r\nsubscribed for on speculative account, and that any forced settlement\r\nof the subscriptions falling due in April would produce a panic.\r\nPrivate telegrams sent here conveyed information to the effect that\r\narrangements would be made between yourself and the banks, by which\r\nthe deposits in them would not be drawn upon until absolutely\r\nnecessary.  The answer, however, which I received from you a few\r\nhours later was highly gratifying and reassuring, and I gave it as\r\nmuch publicity as possible without, of course, publishing it.  It\r\nreads as follows:  'Entirely confident subscriptions during the\r\nnext month will be settled without disturbing the market.  Order\r\ntreasury department yesterday will facilitate greatly.'\r\n\r\n\"The question of obligation to make a subscription on the 1st day\r\nof April to continue the contract has been under consideration by\r\nthe syndicate during the past week, and in fact ever since the\r\nbeginning of the decline in the price of the four per cent. stock.\r\nThe associates claim that they are only required to take five\r\nmillions of the bonds during the month of April, and that having\r\nalready taken three-fifths of the amount in advance, they should,\r\nin view of the impossibility of disposing of the stock at present\r\nprices, be allowed the balance of the month in which to subscribe\r\nfor the remaining two millions.  They argue that it cannot be\r\nexpected that they can afford to take the bonds and pay the government\r\none and a half per cent. above the market prices, and they add that\r\nthey do not think you would wish to have them do so.  They also\r\nsay that if they wanted the bonds for _speculative purposes only_\r\nthey should give up the contract and purchase in the open market;\r\nbut their policy is to keep the price at par and not to buy or sell\r\nwhen it is below par.  Bonds will sell more rapidly when they are\r\nat par than when below it.  It is the speculators and not the\r\ninvestors, as a rule, who deal in stocks when they are cheap.  If\r\nthe price of the bonds had remained at par, I have no doubt but\r\nthat all the bonds I have here would already have been disposed\r\nof, and that the parties would have been ready and willing to make\r\nthe subscription for five millions on April 1.\r\n\r\n\"The Messrs. Rothschild say that, owing to the high price which\r\nthey were compelled to pay for called bonds, and the reduced price\r\nat which they were compelled to part with a portion of the four\r\nper cent. bonds, they have made a slight loss on their transactions\r\nso far.  They like to have business relations and connections with\r\ngovernments, and I think that that disposition on their part is\r\nparamount to the question of profits.  The matter of the subscription\r\nwas discussed again yesterday, and deferred until Monday for further\r\nconsideration, and I was asked to send the following cable message\r\nto you:\r\n\r\n'Rothschild & Sons request me to say they do not consider contract\r\nof January 21, 1879, requires subscription $2,000,000 to be made\r\nApril 1.  On account of market price below par at the present time,\r\nthey desire delay subscription a few days.  Hope you will consent.'\r\n\r\n\"I hoped you would consent, because I think it quite important,\r\nfor many reasons, that we should dispose of bonds on this side of\r\nthe water.  They take the place of actual gold in settling exchanges,\r\nand thereby prevent the disturbances in the money market which\r\nalways result from the moving of bullion.  I have no doubt but that\r\nthe use of these bonds in this manner has stimulated purchases of\r\ngrain and produce from us which would never have left our shores\r\nif payment for the same could only have been made in bullion.  I\r\nreceived this morning your cable message in answer to the one I\r\nsent yesterday, as follows:\r\n\r\n'I think contract of January 21, 1879, very plain.  Subscriptions\r\nshould be made April 1; but, if they desire, time will be extended\r\nto April 8.'\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n  \"With great respect, I remain, yours truly,\r\n  \"Chas. F. Conant.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI have set out in full this correspondence with Rothschild and his\r\nassociates and with Conant, to show that on the eve of complete\r\nsuccess they were discouraged and asked for a postponement of, to\r\nthem, the small subscription of $1,000,000, and did not even think\r\nof taking the option of $10,000,000 of bonds subsequently claimed.\r\n\r\nWith the 1st of April all stringency disappeared.  Accounts were\r\nsettled without difficulty.  The amount of four per cent. consols\r\nsold to March 31, inclusive, was $473,443,400.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, while attending a meeting of the cabinet, I\r\nwas handed the following telegram:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, April 4, 1879.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\"National Bank of Commerce in New York subscribes for forty million\r\ndollars four per cent. bonds.  Particulars and certificates by mail.\r\n\r\n  \"Henry F. Vail, President.\"\r\n\r\nI thought the amount was a mistake, that four instead of forty was\r\nmeant.  I replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Henry F. Vail, President National Bank of Commerce, New York.\r\n \"Before making call I prefer you repeat your subscription.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments after sending this telegram I received the following\r\nfrom Mr. Vail:\r\n\r\n\"I sent you telegram to-day, which from its importance I beg you\r\nwill telegraph me acknowledgment of its receipt.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"Your telegram is received, and I have asked repetition of it before\r\nmaking call.\"\r\n\r\nThe following telegraphic correspondence then occurred:\r\n\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Please enter to-day for us a subscription for ten million dollars\r\nfour per cents. making, however, no announcement until we see you\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n  \"G. F.

Taylor, Cashier Continental National Bank, New York.\r\n\r\n\"Your subscription for three millions arrived too late; all the 5-\r\n20's have been covered by previous subscriptions.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar telegram was sent to the Continental National Bank of\r\nNew York, which subscribed $25,000,000 additional, the Hanover\r\nNational Bank of New York, $25,000,000, and the New York National\r\nBanking Association, $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nI then telegraphed to Mr. Conant as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Subscriptions have been made covering all 5-20 bonds (consols of\r\n1867 and consols of 1868) outstanding, reserving for contracting\r\nparties the one million not subscribed for.\r\n\r\n\"Inform the contracting parties and accept no new subscriptions.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, 1879, I had the satisfaction of issuing the\r\n95th and 96th calls for 5-20 bonds, covering all the bonds outstanding\r\nissued under the act of March 3, 1865, and the last of the United\r\nStates 5-20 bonds.  The early twenty year bonds, issued during the\r\nfirst two years of the Civil War, were not yet due or redeemable,\r\nand, therefore, could not be called for payment.  This was a\r\npractical illustration of the importance, in issuing government\r\nsecurities, of reserving the right to redeem them before maturity.\r\n\r\nThe rapid and irregular subscriptions made on the 4th of April\r\ninvolved the department in serious difficulty in determining who\r\nof the many subscribers were entitled to the bonds.  The aggregate\r\nof subscriptions was more than double the amount of 5-20 bonds\r\noutstanding.  By adopting a rule of accepting bids made before a\r\nfixed hour of that day, and by voluntary arrangements among the\r\nbidders, a distribution was made.\r\n\r\nThe only serious controversy in respect to this distribution was\r\nupon the claim of the Rothschilds that they had option extending\r\nto the 30th of June for ten millions of bonds, and for one million\r\nextended from April 1 to April 8.  The latter was allowed, but the\r\ndepartment held that the option for ten millions June 30 was\r\ndependent upon whether the bonds were previously sold, and this\r\noccurred on the 4th of April.  This gave rise to a controversy\r\nwhich was settled by the voluntary transfer, by the National Bank\r\nof Commerce, of ten millions of the forty millions bonds subscribed\r\nfor by it.  Rothschild, the head of the house, would not accept\r\nthis offer, but, with some show of resentment, declined to receive\r\nhis share of the bonds, but they were eagerly taken by his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nThe 5-20 bonds having been paid off or called, the department\r\nproceeded, as soon as practicable, to execute the laws of January\r\n25 \"to facilitate the refunding of the national debt,\" and February\r\n26 \"to authorize the issue of certificates of deposit in aid of\r\nthe refunding of the public debt.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April I published the offer of $150,000,000 four\r\nper cent. bonds at one-half of one per cent. above par and accrued\r\ninterest, and reserved $44,566,300 of these bonds for the conversion\r\nof ten dollar refunding certificates.\r\n\r\nThe following telegrams, addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\non the 17th of April, tell the result:\r\n\r\nFrom the Bank of New York National Banking Association, New York:\r\n\r\n\"Send two millions four per cent. bonds under terms of to-day's\r\ndispatch.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Chase National Bank, New York:\r\n\r\n\"We have subscribed for half million dollars four per cent. bonds\r\non terms just issued.

Your telegram for twenty-five million received, and\r\nentered at two o'clock.  About thirty million from other parties\r\nwere received and entered before your last telegram.  Will wait\r\ntill letters received.  What is the matter?  Are you all crazy?\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the bids were carefully analyzed and accepted in the\r\norder in which they were received.  The bid of the First National\r\nBank was made on the behalf of an association of banks and bankers.\r\nI declined their offer for refunding certificates and accepted\r\ntheir offer for $111,000,000.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Conant, April 18, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Since I wrote you the letters yesterday respecting the recent\r\ncircular of April 16, I have sold the whole of the $150,000,000 of\r\nbonds offered therein; $39,000,000 were sold to sundry banks in\r\nthe city of New York, and the residue, $111,000,000, were sold to\r\nan association of banks and bankers through First National Bank.\r\nThis unexpected and agreeable _denouement_ of our refunding operations\r\nwill supersede much that I have written you.  I received and answered\r\nyour telegram of to-day.  Arrangements will be made with the new\r\nassociates for delivery of four per cent. consols and the receipt\r\nof called bonds in London.\r\n\r\n\"Although I have given notice that I will feel at liberty to do so\r\nafter the 4th of May, I prefer that you will postpone any new\r\narrangement for delivery to other parties until the 10th; hoping\r\nthat before that time Messrs. J. S. Morgan & Co. will be able to\r\nclose out the balance of their last subscription.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day I made a call for $160,000,000 10-40 bonds, being\r\nall of such bonds outstanding, except an amount that would be\r\ncovered by the proceeds of ten dollar refunding certificates.  The\r\nsale of these certificates gave the department a great deal of\r\ntrouble.  The object and purpose of the law was to secure to persons\r\nof limited means an opportunity to purchase, at par, certificates\r\nof indebtedness bearing four per cent. interest.  As they could be\r\nconverted at pleasure into 10-40 bonds of small denominations, it\r\nwas thought they would be promptly taken by the persons for whom\r\nthey were designed.  They were sold in limited amounts to individuals\r\nat post offices, but as they were, when converted into bonds, worth\r\na premium, bankers and others hired men to stand in line and purchase\r\ncertificates.  This was a practical fraud on the law, and was mainly\r\nconducted in the cities, and where done the sale was discontinued.\r\nThe great body of the certificates were taken by the class of\r\npersons for whom they were designed.  In a brief period they were\r\nsold, and the proceeds were in the treasury.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April I made the final call for all outstanding 10-\r\n40 bonds.  With this call the refunding operations were practically\r\nat an end for the time.  A good deal of correspondence was had as\r\nto priority of bids and sales of refunding certificates, but this\r\nwas closed, at the end of ninety days, by the full payment of the\r\ncalled bonds, and the substitution of bonds bearing a lower rate\r\nof interest.  This was accomplished without the loss of a dollar,\r\nor, so far as I can recall, without a lawsuit.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate amount of bonds refunded from March 4, 1877, to July\r\n21, 1879, was $845,345,950.\r\n\r\nThe annual interest saved by this operation was $14,290,416.50.\r\n\r\nThe general approval and appreciation of these results was manifested\r\nby the public press, and especially in Europe.  Mr. Conant, in a\r\nletter dated April 19, said:\r\n\r\n\"On yesterday morning, at the stock exchange, just after the opening\r\nhour, a McLean's cable dispatch was posted up, stating that you\r\nhad entered into a contract with a syndicate for the sale of\r\n$150,000,000 of four per cent. bonds, against the outstanding 10-\r\n40 five per cent. bonds.  People were astounded at the information,\r\nand they were all the more astonished because the operation followed\r\nso closely upon the transaction of the 4th instant.  The effect of\r\nthis has been to send the price of the bonds up by three-fourths\r\nper cent., and to create a demand for them.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the date of these transactions the bonds of the United States\r\nrapidly advanced in value.  Many similar transactions of my successors\r\nin office have been made at a still lower rate of interest.\r\n\r\nAmong the agreeable incidents connected with the resumption of\r\nspecie payments was the adoption of resolutions by the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of New York, on the 2nd of July, 1879.  The second resolution\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That this Chamber tenders its congratulations to the\r\nHonorable the Secretary of the Treasury, at once the framer and\r\nexecutor of the law of 1875, upon the success which has attended\r\nhis administration of the national finances; as well in the funding\r\nof the public debt, as in the measures he has pursued to restore\r\na sound currency.\"\r\n\r\nI subsequently received, by the hands of William E. Dodge, late\r\npresident of the Chamber of Commerce of New York, a letter from\r\nthat body asking me to sit for my portrait to be placed on the\r\nwalls of their Chamber.  On the 24th of February I sent the following\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, by the\r\nhands of Wm. E. Dodge, late president of the Chamber of Commerce\r\nof New York, of your letter of the 17th instant, covering a resolution\r\nof your body, asking me to sit for my portrait to be placed upon\r\nthe walls of your Chamber.\r\n\r\n\"The kinds words of Mr. Dodge in delivering the resolution add\r\ngreatly to the compliment contained therein.  I assure you that I\r\ndeeply appreciate the honor of being designated in this manner, by\r\na body so distinguished as the one you represent, composed of\r\nmembers having so large an influence in the commercial transactions,\r\nnot only of our country, but of other nations, whose familiarity\r\nwith financial and commercial subjects gives to its opinions great\r\nrespect and authority.\r\n\r\n\"The resumption of specie payments has been brought about by the\r\nco-operation, not only of many Senators and Members of Congress,\r\nbut of the leading merchants, bankers and other business men of\r\nthe country.  It was my good fortune to be selected, by my colleagues\r\nin the Senate, to present the resumption act, which was framed with\r\ntheir aid and in their councils, and to hold my present office at\r\nthe time when, by its terms, the law was to be enforced.  The only\r\nmerit I can claim is the honest and earnest effort, with others,\r\nto secure the adoption of the policy of resumption, and to have\r\nexecuted the law according to its letter and spirit.  I feel that\r\nI cannot accept this high compliment, without acknowledging that\r\nI am but one of the many who have contributed to the accomplishment\r\nof this beneficent object.\r\n\r\n\"I will, with great pleasure, give every facility to any artist\r\nwhom you may select to carry your resolution into effect.\r\n\r\n\"Expressing to you, and the gentlemen you represent, my appreciation\r\nof a compliment so highly prized, I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Messrs. A. A. Lone, James M. Brown, Sam'l D. Babcock, Wm. E. Dodge,\r\n  Henry F. Spaulding, _Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, New\r\n  York_.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in compliance with this request, I gave to Mr.\r\nHuntington, an eminent artist selected by that body, a number of\r\nsittings, and the result was a portrait of great merit, which was\r\nplaced in the Chamber of Commerce with that of Alexander Hamilton.\r\nI regarded this as a high compliment from so distinguished a body\r\nof merchants, but I do not indulge in the vanity of a comparison\r\nwith Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nGENERAL DESIRE TO NOMINATE ME FOR GOVERNOR OF OHIO.\r\nDeath of My Brother Charles--The 46th Congress Convened in Special\r\nSession--\"Mending Fences\" at My Home in Mansfield--Efforts to Put\r\nMe Forward as a Candidate for the Governorship of Ohio--Letter to\r\nMurat Halstead on the Question of the Presidency, etc.--Result of\r\nMy Letter to John B.

Blaine to Speak in Maine--\r\nMy Speech at Portland--Victory of the Republican Party--My Speech\r\nat Steubenville, Ohio--Evidences of Prosperity on Every Hand--Visit\r\nto Cincinnati and Return to Washington--Results in Ohio.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 1, 1879, I received intelligence of the\r\nsudden death of my eldest brother, Charles T. Sherman, at his\r\nresidence in Cleveland.  In company with General Miles and Senator\r\nCameron, his sons-in-law, and General Sherman, I went to Cleveland\r\nto attend the funeral.  My respect and affection for him has already\r\nbeen stated.  As the eldest member of our family he contributed\r\nmore than any other to the happiness of his mother and the success\r\nof his brothers and sisters.  He aided and assisted me in every\r\nperiod of my life, and with uniform kindness did all he could to\r\nadvance my interests and add to my comfort and happiness.  As\r\ndistrict judge of the United States, for the northern district of\r\nOhio, he was faithful and just.  When, after twelve years service,\r\nhe was reproached for aiding in securing the reversal of an order\r\nof the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in collecting an unlawful\r\nand unjust tax in the city of New York, as he had a perfect right\r\nto do, he resigned his position rather than engage in a controversy.\r\nHe was unduly sensitive of all accusations or innuendoes touching\r\nhis honor.  He was honest and faithful to every engagement, and\r\nhad a larger personal following of intimate friends and associates\r\nthan either of his brothers.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1879, President Hayes convened the 46th Congress\r\nin special session to meet on the 18th of that month, to provide\r\nnecessary appropriations for the legislative, executive and judicial\r\nexpenses of the government, and also for the support of the army,\r\nthe 45th Congress having failed to pass bills for these objects on\r\naccount of a disagreement of the two Houses as to certain provisions\r\nrelating to the election laws.  This session continued until July\r\n1, and was chiefly occupied in political topics, such as reconstruction\r\nand elections.  The Democratic party, for the first time in twenty\r\nyears, had control of both Houses, but it neither adopted nor\r\nproposed any important financial legislation at that session, the\r\nonly law passed in respect to coin, currency or bonds which I recall\r\nbeing one to provide for the exchange of subsidiary coins for lawful\r\nmoney, and making such coins a legal tender in all sums not exceeding\r\nten dollars.  Congress seemed to be content with the operations of\r\nthe treasury department at that time, and certainly made no obstacle\r\nto their success.\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of May, Mrs. Sherman, accompanied by our adopted\r\ndaughter, Mary Sherman, then a young schoolgirl twelve years old,\r\nand Miss Florence Hoyt, of New York, Miss Jennie Dennison, of\r\nColumbus, and Miss Julia Parsons, of Cleveland, three bright and\r\naccomplished young ladies, embarked on the steamer Adriatic for a\r\nvisit to Europe.  Mrs. Sherman placed Mary in a very good school\r\nat Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and then with her companions visited\r\nthe leading cities of Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter accompanying the party to New York I went to Mansfield, and\r\nas my family was absent and the homestead occupied by comparative\r\nstrangers, I stopped at the St. James hotel where, as was natural,\r\nI met a great many of my old neighbors and friends, both Democrats\r\nand Republicans, who welcomed me home.\r\n\r\nAmong my visitors were several reporters from different parts of\r\nthe country who wanted to interview me and especially to learn if\r\nI was a candidate for governor, and why I came home.  In the\r\nafternoon I visited my farm near by and my homestead of about twenty\r\nacres adjoining the city.  I found them in the usual neglected\r\ncondition of the property of a non-resident proprietor, with many\r\nof the fences down.  In the evening I was serenaded at the hotel\r\nand made a brief speech to a large audience, commencing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am very happy to be again in your midst, to see your faces and\r\nto greet you as friends.  The shaking of your hands is more grateful\r\nto me than the music of bands or any parade.  I never felt like\r\nmaking an explanation in coming before you until now.  I found when\r\nI arrived in my old home that the papers said I came west seeking\r\nthe nomination for governor.  I came purely on private business--\r\nto repair my fences and look after neglected property.\"\r\n\r\nThe reporters seized upon the reference to my fences, and construed\r\nit as having a political significance.  The phrase \"mending fences\"\r\nbecame a byword, and every politician engaged in strengthening his\r\nposition is still said to be \"mending his fences.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to that time mention had been made of me in different\r\nparts of the country, not only for the nomination of Governor of\r\nOhio, but for President of the United States.  Charles Foster and\r\nAlphonso Taft were then spoken of as the leading candidates for\r\nnomination as governor.  Both were my personal friends and eminently\r\nqualified to perform the duties of the office.  Although I regarded\r\nthe position of governor as dignified and important, well worthy\r\nthe ambition of any citizen, still there were reasons which would\r\nprevent my accepting the nomination if it should be tendered me.\r\nI felt that to abandon my duties in the treasury department might\r\nbe fairly construed as an evasion of a grave responsibility and an\r\nimportant public duty.  I knew that President Hayes was very anxious\r\nthat I should remain in the office of secretary until the close of\r\nhis term.  I did not desire to compete with the gentlemen already\r\nnamed, and did all I could to discourage the movement short of\r\nabsolute refusal to accept the nomination.  The newspapers of the\r\nday, not only in Ohio but in other states, were full of favorable\r\ncomments upon my probable nomination for governor, and my correspondence\r\nupon the subject was very large.  I have no doubt that had I\r\nconsented to be a candidate both Foster and Taft would have acquiesced\r\nin my nomination and I, in all human probability, would have been\r\nduly elected as Foster was.\r\n\r\nAs for the nomination for the presidency I made no movement or\r\neffort to bring it about, but then believed that General Grant\r\nwould, upon his return from his tour around the world, be nominated\r\nand elected.  The following letter will explain fully my position\r\nin regard to the office of both governor and president:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., May 15, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I notice, with heartfelt thanks for your personal\r\nkindness in the matter, the course of the 'Commercial' in regard\r\nto my proposed candidacy for Governor of Ohio, and this induces me\r\nto state to you frankly and fully, in confidence, the reasons why\r\nI could not accept the nomination if tendered, and why I hope you\r\nwill give such a turn to the matter as will save me the embarrassment\r\nof declining.\r\n\r\n\"In ordinary circumstance an election as Governor of Ohio, after\r\nmy life in the Senate, would be extremely flattering and agreeable;\r\nbut at present, for several reasons, the least of which are personal,\r\nI could not accept it.\r\n\r\n\"My wife has gone to Europe on a visit of recreation greatly needed\r\nby her, my house in Mansfield is rented, and all my arrangements\r\nare made to be here during the summer.  The nomination would require\r\nme to recall her, to resume my house, and to break up my plans for\r\nthe summer.  If this alone stood in the way, I could easily overcome\r\nit, but I know from letters received that my resignation as secretary\r\nwould be regarded as a desertion of a public trust important to\r\nthe whole country, with the selfish view of promoting my personal\r\nambition, not for the governorship merely but for the presidency,\r\nwhich would impair rather than improve any chance I may have in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\n\"The President would regard this change as a great inconvenience\r\nand as defeating a desire he has frequently expressed to maintain\r\nhis cabinet intact during his term, so that my obligations to him\r\nforbid this.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"All these objections might be met except the one which I think is\r\nunanswerable, that my presence here in the completion of a public\r\nduty is far more important to the whole country and the cause we\r\nadvocate than if I were to run as a candidate for Governor of Ohio\r\nand even succeed with a large majority.\r\n\r\n\"All things now tend to our success in Ohio and that is likely to\r\nbe as complete with any other candidate for governor as myself,\r\nwhile if left here I will be able to so finish my business that no\r\none can say it is incomplete.\r\n\r\n\"As for the mention of my name for the presidency, I am not so\r\nblind as not to perceive some favorable signs for me, but I have\r\nthus far observed and intend strictly to adhere to the policy of\r\ntaking no step in that direction, doing no act to promote that\r\nobject, and using none of the influence of my office towards it,\r\nexcept so far as a strict and close attention to duty here may\r\nhelp.  I am not now, and do not intend to get, infected with the\r\npresidential fever.\r\n\r\n  \"With high regard, I am, very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"M. Halstead, Esq., Cincinnati, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nDuring 1879 and the following year I received a multitude of letters\r\nand newspaper paragraphs advocating my nomination for President.\r\nAmong the first of such letters was one from an old friend, John\r\nB. Haskin, formerly a Member of Congress from New York.  On the\r\n10th of May, 1879, I wrote him in answer a letter, not intended\r\nfor publication, but expressing what I would do in the contingency\r\nmentioned by him, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"What I would aspire to, in case public opinion should decide to\r\nmake me a candidate for President, would be to unite in co-operation\r\nwith the Republican party all the national elements of the country\r\nthat contributed to or aided in any way in the successful vindication\r\nof national authority during the war.  I would do this, not for\r\nthe purpose of irritating the south or oppressing them in any way,\r\nbut to assert and maintain the supremacy of national authority to\r\nthe full extent of all the powers conferred by the constitution.\r\nThis, as I understand it, is the Jacksonian as well as the Republican\r\nview of national powers.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"You see my general ideas would lead me to lean greatly upon the\r\nwar Democrats and soldiers in the service, who have been influenced\r\nby political events since the war to withhold support from the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\n\"The true issue for 1880 is national supremacy in national matters,\r\nhonest money and an honest dollar.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Haskin gave, or showed, this letter to a New York paper, and\r\nit was published.  I expressed my opinion, but it was not one that\r\nshould have been made public without authority.  The letter was\r\nthe subject of comment and criticism, and was treated as an open\r\ndeclaration of my candidacy for the office of President.  It was\r\nnot written with this purpose, as the context clearly shows.  This\r\nincident was a caution to me not to answer such letters, unless I\r\nwas assured that my replies would be treated as confidential.  Yet\r\nI do not see how a man in public life can refuse to answer a friendly\r\nletter, even if his meaning can be perverted.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of May and June I had a correspondence with John\r\nB. Henderson, of St. Louis, in which he expressed his great interest\r\nin my nomination.  This resulted in a conference, which he advised,\r\nwith President Hayes.  My reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, June 23, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--In compliance with your suggestion, I yesterday\r\nmentioned to the President my embarrassment from the general\r\ndiscussion of my name as a possible candidate for the Republican\r\nnomination.  The points I mentioned were how far I should commit\r\nmyself to a candidacy and what I should do to promote it, and second\r\nwhether, under certain circumstances, he would not, in spite of\r\nhis declination, become a candidate for re-election.  He was very\r\nexplicit on both points--first that I ought at once to let it be\r\nunderstood that I was a candidate in the sense stated in the Haskin\r\nletter, and no more--that great care should be taken that while a\r\ncandidate, I ought not to take part in any movement of opposition\r\nto others named--especially General Grant.  The feeling is growing\r\ndaily that General Grant will not allow his name to be used and\r\nthat, while his eminent services should be fully recognized and\r\nrewarded, it is neither right nor politic to elect him to the\r\npresidency for the third term.  The President very truly said that\r\nany appearance of a personal hostility or opposition to General\r\nGrant, would be inconsistent with my constant support of his\r\nadministration during eight years, and would induce a concentration\r\nthat would surely defeat me.  Upon the second point he was very\r\nexplicit--that he would not be a candidate under any circumstances,\r\nand as far as he could properly, without any unseemly interference,\r\nhe would favor my election.  This was the general tenor of his\r\nconversation, which he said he would repeat to General Schurz.\r\nThis relieves me from some embarrassment, but I still think it is\r\nbetter for us to remain absolutely quiet, awaiting the development\r\nof public opinion or the voluntary action of personal and political\r\nfriends.  Unless there is a clear preponderance of opinion in\r\npreference for my nomination against all others, I do not want to\r\nenter upon the scramble.  As yet I do not see any concentration.\r\nHoping to see you soon, I remain,\r\n\r\n  \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. John B. Henderson.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a brief visit to Mansfield I went to Columbus, where I met\r\nwith a hearty reception from men of both political parties.  The\r\nlegislature was in session, and the senators and members, judges\r\nof the courts, and executive officers of the state, called upon me\r\nand gave me cordial greetings.  I attended a reception at the house\r\nof Governor Dennison, where I met the leading citizens of Columbus.\r\nOn my return to the hotel I was serenaded by a band, and being\r\nintroduced by Governor Dennison made a brief speech of a non-partisan\r\ncharacter, and in closing said:\r\n\r\n\"I want to make one personal remark about myself.  Some of my\r\nnewspaper friends here have tried to make me a candidate for Governor\r\nof Ohio, but I hope none of you will vote for me in convention or\r\nbefore the people.  I propose to stick to my present place until\r\nthe question of resumption is settled beyond a doubt.  I want to\r\nconvince everybody that the experiment of resumption is a success;\r\nthat we can resume; that the United States is not bound to have\r\nits notes hawked about at a discount, but that a note of the United\r\nStates may travel about the world, everywhere received as equal to\r\ngold coin, and as good as any note ever issued by any nation, either\r\nin ancient or modern times.  I want to see that our debt shall be\r\nreduced, which will be done through four per cent. bonds.  If the\r\npresent policy prevails, we shall be able to borrow all the money\r\nneeded for national uses for less than four per cent., perhaps as\r\nlow as three.\"\r\n\r\nI returned directly to Washington.  Finding that a determined effort\r\nwould be made to force my nomination as governor, I wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to prevent it:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,     }\r\n  \"Washington, May 15, 1879.}\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--In view of the kindly interest manifested by political\r\nfriends during my recent visit home, that I should be nominated as\r\nthe Republican candidate for Governor of Ohio, I have given the\r\nsubject the most careful consideration, and have come to the\r\nconclusion that I cannot, in my present situation, accept such a\r\nnomination if tendered.\r\n\r\n\"I am now engaged in a public duty which demands my constant\r\nattention and which can clearly better be completed by me than by\r\nanyone coming freshly into the office.  To now accept the nomination\r\nfor governor, though it is an honor I would otherwise highly prize\r\nand feel deeply grateful for, would be justly regarded as a\r\nabandonment of a trust important to the whole country, to promote\r\nmy personal advancement.  I earnestly hope, therefore, that the\r\nconvention will not embarrass me by a tender of a nomination which\r\nI would be obliged to decline.\r\n\r\n\"It may be that no such purpose will be manifested, but I write\r\nyou so that if the convention should so incline, you may at once\r\nstate why I cannot accept.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"General J. S. Robinson, Chairman Republican State Committee,\r\n  Columbus, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Foster was nominated by the Republican convention in the\r\nlatter part of May, and Thomas Ewing by the Democratic convention.\r\nThese nominations necessarily made prominent the financial questions\r\nof the time.  After the close of the funding operations, I received\r\nfrom Mr. Blaine, as chairman of the Republican committee of Maine,\r\nthe following invitation, which I accepted:\r\n\r\n  \"Augusta, Me., July 3, 1879.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Secy. of Treas.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Could you speak at Portland, Tuesday, July 23, and\r\nthen during the same week at Augusta and Bangor--say 25th-27th?\r\nYour Portland speech we should expect to have printed the next day,\r\naccurately from your own slips.\r\n\r\n\"Your two other speeches, hardly less important to us, might be\r\nmade with less care and accuracy, that is, more on the order of\r\nthe general stump speech.\r\n\r\n\"In your Portland speech I hope, however, you will talk on something\r\nmore than the finance, making it, however, the leading and prominent\r\ntopic--but giving a heavy hit at the conduct of the Democrats during\r\nthe extra session.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely,\r\n  \"James G. Blaine.\"\r\n\r\nThe election in the State of Maine preceding those of other states,\r\ngreat interest was taken in it, as the result there would have much\r\ninfluence in other parts of the country.  That state in the previous\r\nyear had faltered in support of the Republican party.  In that year\r\nthere were three candidates in the field for governor, the Republican,\r\nwhose name I do not recall, the Democratic, Garcelon, for hard\r\nmoney, and the Greenback, Smith, under the lead of Solon Chase, an\r\nalleged lunatic in favor of fiat money, the repeal of the resumption\r\nlaw, and the enactment of an eight-hour law.  Smith received about\r\n40,000 votes, Garcelon about 28,000, and the Republican candidate\r\nabout 54,000.  Many Republicans either did not vote or voted the\r\nDemocratic or Greenback ticket.  By the constitution of that state\r\na majority of all the votes cast is required to elect a governor,\r\nand in case of failure the house of representatives of the state\r\nproceeds to ballot for choice.  The names are then sent to the\r\nsenate for the action of that body.  The result was the election\r\nof Garcelon, the Democratic candidate.\r\n\r\nThis was due to a strong feeling then prevailing in favor of\r\nirredeemable or fiat money, and to some discontent among Republicans\r\nwith the liberal measures adopted by President Hayes to secure\r\npeace and quiet in the south, especially the recognition of Hampton\r\nas Governor of South Carolina and of Nichols as Governor of\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nI thought it important to turn the issues of the campaign to the\r\nfinancial measures accomplished by the Republican party, and\r\ntherefore prepared with some care a speech to be delivered at\r\nPortland, and confined mainly to this subject.  This speech was\r\nmade on the 23rd of July, 1879.  I regard it as the best statement\r\nof the financial question made by me in that canvass.  In it I\r\nstated fully the action of the administration in respect to the\r\nresumption of specie payments, and the refunding of the public\r\ndebt.  The people of Maine had been greatly divided upon these\r\nmeasures.  The Greenback party was opposed to the effort to advance\r\nthe United States note to the value of coin which it represented,\r\nbut wished to make it depend upon some imaginary value given to it\r\nby law.  I said the people of Maine would have to choose between\r\nthose who strictly sought to preserve the national faith, and to\r\nmaintain the greenback at par with coin, and those who, with utter\r\ndisregard of the public faith, wished to restore the old state of\r\naffairs, when the greenback could only be passed at a discount,\r\nand could neither be received for customs duties, nor be paid upon\r\nthe public debt.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback party had embodied in their platform the following\r\ndogmas:\r\n\r\n\"The general government should issue an ample volume of full legal\r\ntender currency to meet the business needs of the country, and to\r\npromptly pay all of its debts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The national banking system should be immediately abolished.\"\r\n\r\n\"We demand the immediate calling-in and payment of all United States\r\nbonds in full legal tender money.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Members of Congress from the State of Maine, Hon. G. W.\r\nLadd, was reported to have paid his attention to me, in a speech\r\nin Portland, in the following language:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman has sold one hundred and ninety millions of four per\r\ncent. bonds in one day to bloodsuckers who were choking the country,\r\nand he should be impeached.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing my speech I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is to support such dogmas, my Republican friends, that we are\r\ninvited to desert the great party to which we belong.  It may be\r\nthat the Republican party has made in the last twenty years some\r\nmistakes.  It may not always have come up to your aspirations.\r\nSometimes power may have been abused.  To err is human; but where\r\nit has erred it has always been on the side of liberty and justice.\r\nIt led our country in the great struggle for union and nationality,\r\nwhich more than all else tended to make it great and powerful.  It\r\nhas always taken side with the poor and the feeble.  It emancipated\r\na whole race, and has invested them with liberty and all the rights\r\nof citizenship.  It never robbed the ballot box.  It has never\r\ndeprived any class of people, for any cause, of the elective\r\nfranchise.  It maintains the supremacy of the national government\r\non all national affairs, while observing and protecting the rights\r\nof the states.  It has tried to secure the equality of all citizens\r\nbefore the law.  It opposes all distinctions among men, whether\r\nwhite or black, native or naturalized.  It invites them all to\r\npartake of equal privileges, and secures them an equal chance in\r\nlife.  It has secured, for the first time in our history, the rights\r\nof a naturalized citizen to protection against claims of military\r\nduty in his native country.  It prescribes no religious test.\r\nWhile it respects religion for its beneficial influence upon civil\r\nsociety, it recognizes the right of each individual to worship God\r\naccording to the dictates of his own conscience, without prejudice\r\nor interference.  It supports free common schools as the basis of\r\nrepublican institutions.  It has done more than any party that ever\r\nexisted to provide lands for the landless.  It devised and enacted\r\nthe homestead law, and has constantly extended this policy, so that\r\nall citizens, native and naturalized, may enjoy, without cost,\r\nlimited portions of this public land.  It protects American labor.\r\nIt is in favor of American industry.  It seeks to diversity\r\nproductions.  It has steadily pursued, as an object of national\r\nimportance, the development of our commerce on inland waters and\r\non the high seas.  It has protected our flag on every sea; not the\r\nstars and bars, not the flag of a state, but the stars and stripes\r\nof the Union.  It seeks to establish in this republic of ours a\r\ngreat, strong, free government of free men.  It would, with frankness\r\nand sincerity, without malice or hate, extend the right hand of\r\nfellowship and fraternity to those who lately were at war with us,\r\naid them in making fruitful their waste places and in developing\r\ntheir immense resources, if only they would allow the poor and\r\nignorant men among them the benefits conferred by the constitution\r\nand the laws.  No hand of oppression rests upon them.  No bayonet\r\npoints to them except in their political imaginings.\r\n\r\n\"We would gladly fraternize with them if they would allow us, and\r\nhave but one creed--the constitution and laws of our country, to\r\nbe executed and enforced by our country, and for the equal benefit\r\nof all our countrymen.  If they will not accept this, but will keep\r\nup sectionalism, maintain the solid south upon the basis of the\r\nprinciples of the Confederate states, we must prepare to stand\r\ntogether as the loyal north, true to the Union, true to liberty,\r\nand faithful to every national obligation.  I appeal to every man\r\nwho ever, at any time, belonged to the Republican party, to every\r\nman who supported his country in its time of danger, to every lover\r\nof liberty regulated by law, and every intelligent Democrat who\r\ncan see with us the evil tendencies of the dogmas I have commented\r\nupon, to join us in reforming all that is evil, all the abuses of\r\nthe past, and in developing the principles and policies which in\r\ntwenty years have done so much to strengthen our government, to\r\nconsolidate our institutions, and to excite the respect and admiration\r\nof mankind.\"\r\n\r\nI made similar speeches at Lewiston, Augusta, Waterville and Bangor.\r\nGeneral Sherman's estimate of my speech at Portland, in reply to\r\nan inquiry, is characteristic of him, viz:\r\n\r\n\"General, your brother, Secretary Sherman, seems to be doing some\r\ntelling work just now in the State of Maine; in fact, it is conceded\r\nthat his recent financial triumphs have made him a power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, I think John's doing right well.  He made a good speech\r\nat Portland, one that seemed to me carefully prepared.  I think he\r\nanswered his critics quite conclusively, but if I were in John's\r\nplace I would now save my breath and make no more speeches, but\r\nsimply say in reply to other invitations, 'Read my Portland speech,'\r\nbecause whatever other efforts he may make during the campaign must\r\nbe more or less a rehash of that.\"\r\n\r\nIn the canvass that followed in Maine but little attention was paid\r\nto the sectional question, and the Republican party gained a complete\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of August the business of the treasury department,\r\nbeing confined to routine duties, was left under the management of\r\nAssistant Secretary John B. Hawley.  I determined to spend the\r\nremainder of the month in the campaign in Ohio, then actively\r\nprogressing, but confined mainly to the issue between the inflation\r\nof paper money and the solid rock of specie payments.  I made my\r\nfirst speech in that canvass at Steubenville on the 21st of August.\r\nThe meeting was a very large one.  Every available seat was occupied\r\nby an intelligent audience, and the aisles and corridors were filled\r\nwith people sitting or standing.  I opened my speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to be again among the people of Ohio, to whom I am\r\nunder the highest obligations of duty and gratitude, and especially\r\nto be here in this good county of Jefferson, whose representatives\r\nhave thrice honored me by their vote when a candidate for the Senate\r\nof the United States.  I cheerfully come to speak on matters in\r\nwhich you, as well as the whole people of the United States, have\r\na common interest; and I will best meet your wishes by stating, in\r\na plain, frank way, such facts and reasons as appear to me to\r\njustify the support you have uniformly given to the Republican\r\nparty since its organization in 1854, and to present adequate\r\ngrounds for supporting it now.\r\n\r\n\"Three parties present candidates to the people of Ohio for the\r\nhighest offices of the state.  It will not be necessary or just\r\nfor me to arraign the personal character, standing, or services of\r\neither of the candidates on either of these tickets.  They are all\r\nrespected citizens, and each would, no doubt, if elected, satisfactorily\r\nperform the duties of the office for which he is nominated.\r\n\r\n\"But the issues involved are far more important than the candidates.\r\nI assure you that upon the election in Ohio depend questions of\r\npublic policy which touch upon the framework of our government and\r\naffect the interests of every citizen of the United States.  The\r\nsame old questions about which we disputed before the war, and\r\nduring the war, and since the war, are as clearly involved in this\r\ncampaign as they were when Lincoln was elected, or when Grant was\r\nfighting the battles of his country in the Wilderness.\r\n\r\n\"There are also financial questions involved in this contest.  The\r\nRepublican party proposed, maintained, and executed the resumption\r\nact as the best remedy for the evils that followed the panic of\r\n1873.  Under that act it has brought about the resumption of specie\r\npayments.  By its policy all forms of money are equal to and\r\nredeemable in coin.  It has reduced the interest on all the public\r\ndebt that is now redeemable.  It has maintained and advanced the\r\npublic credit.  It now declares its purpose to hold fast to what\r\nit has done, to keep and maintain every dollar of paper money in\r\ncirculation as of equal value to the best coin issued from the\r\nmint, and as soon as possible to complete the work of reducing\r\ninterest on all the public debt to four per cent. or less.\r\n\r\n\"The Greenback party not only denounces all we have done, but\r\nproposes to reverse it by the issue of an almost unlimited amount\r\nof irredeemable paper money, to destroy the system of free national\r\nbanks, and to call in and pay off all the United States bonds with\r\nirredeemable money.\r\n\r\n\"The Democratic party of Ohio, both in its platform and by its\r\ncandidates, supports more or less all of these dogmas; but it does\r\nso not as a matter of principle, but for political power.  Its main\r\nobject is, by any sort of alliance on any real or pretended popular\r\nissue, to gain strength enough to unite with the solid south, so\r\nthat it may restore to power, in all departments of the national\r\ngovernment, the very same doctrines that led to the Civil War, and\r\nthe very men who waged it against the Union.  To obtain political\r\npower, the democracy seek, by party discipline, to compel their\r\nmembers to abandon the old and cherished principles of their party\r\nof having a sound currency redeemable in coin.  For this, they\r\noverthrew Governor Bishop; for this, they propose to reopen all\r\nthe wild and visionary schemes of inflation which have been twice\r\nrejected by the people of Ohio.  Our contest with them is not only\r\non financial questions, but upon the old and broad question of the\r\npower and duty of the national government to enforce the constitution\r\nand laws of the United States in every state and territory, whether\r\nin favor of or against any citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Let us first take up these financial questions, and in charity\r\nand kindness, and with due deference to opposing opinions, endeavor\r\nto get at the right, if we can.\r\n\r\n\"The great body of all parties are interested in and desirous of\r\npromoting the public good.  If they could only hear both sides\r\nfairly stated, there would be less heat and bitterness in political\r\ncontests, and more independent voting.\"\r\n\r\nI then proceeded with a full discussion of the financial questions,\r\nreferring especially to the speeches made by General Ewing, with\r\nwhose opinions I was conversant.  I closed with a brief discussion\r\nof the southern question, and especially the nullification of the\r\nelection laws in the southern states.  This speech was the best of\r\nmany made by me in different parts of the state.  I was engaged in\r\nthe canvass in Ohio for two weeks afterward, during which I visited\r\nmy home at Mansfield.\r\n\r\nIn traversing the state I was surprised at the remarkable change\r\nin the condition of business and the feelings of the people, and\r\nat the evidences of prosperity not only in the workshops but on\r\nthe farms.  It was jokingly said that the revival of industries\r\nand peace and happiness was a shrewd political trick of the\r\nRepublicans to carry the state.  As I rode through the country I\r\nsaw for miles and miles luxuriant crops of thousands of acres of\r\nwheat, corn, oats and barley.  It was said that this was merely a\r\npart of the campaign strategy of the Republicans, that really the\r\npeople were very poor and miserable and on the verge of starvation.\r\nThis was the burden of the speeches of General Ewing, who attributed\r\nthe miseries of the people to my \"wicked financial policy,\" and\r\nsaid that I was given over to the clutches of the money power and\r\nstripped and robbed the people of Ohio for the benefit of the\r\n\"bloated bondholders.\"\r\n\r\nWhile General Ewing was fighting in the shadows of the past, caused\r\nby the panic of 1873, a revolution had taken place, and he who\r\nentered into the canvass with the hope that the cry of distress\r\nwould aid him in his ambition to be governor, must have been greatly\r\ndiscouraged by the evidences of prosperity all around him.  I found\r\nin my home at Mansfield that business was prosperous, the workshops\r\nwere in full blast, and smoke was issuing from the chimney of every\r\nestablishment in the place.\r\n\r\nMy coming to Ohio naturally excited a good deal of comment and of\r\nopposition from Democratic speakers and papers.  I was charged with\r\nnepotism in appointing my relatives to office, but upon examination\r\nit was found that I had appointed none, though several, mostly\r\nremote, were holding office under appointments of General Grant.\r\nOn the 25th of August I left Mansfield for Columbus and Cincinnati,\r\nand on the train met Charles Foster and others on their way to\r\nMount Vernon.  On their arrival they were met by flags and music,\r\nand in response to the calls I made a brief speech.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August I made my usual annual visit to Cincinnati\r\nand the Chamber of Commerce of that city.  That body is composed\r\nin almost equal numbers of members of the two great parties, and\r\ntherefore, in addressing it, I carefully refrain from discussing\r\npolitical topics.  At that time there was a good deal of discussion\r\nof the order made by me on the 13th of August, addressed to the\r\ntreasurer of the United States, directing him not to withdraw from\r\nbank depositaries the money deposited for the payment of called\r\nbonds, until it was required for that purpose.  At the date of that\r\norder over $70,000,000 of called bonds were still outstanding, but\r\nonly $52,000,000 remained on deposit with national bank depositaries\r\nto pay them, thus showing that $18,000,000 United States notes had\r\nbeen withdrawn from the depositaries into the treasury in advance\r\nof their need for such payment.  These sums were fully secured by\r\nthe deposit with the government of bonds to the amount of such\r\ndeposits and a further sum of bonds to the amount of five per cent.\r\nof the deposit.\r\n\r\nI felt that the withdrawal of this great sum in advance of the\r\npresentation of the called bonds would necessarily create an\r\ninjurious contraction of the currency.  To meet this condition of\r\naffairs, upon the advice of the treasurer at Washington and the\r\nassistant treasurer at New York, and the pressing complaints of\r\nbusiness men not interested in depositary banks, I issued this\r\norder:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, August 13, 1879.\r\n\"Hon. James Gilfillan, Treasurer United States.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--With a view to closing as soon as practicable the accounts\r\nof the department with depositary banks on loan account, without\r\nunnecessary disturbance of the money market or the withdrawal of\r\nlegal tenders from current business, you will please receive from\r\nsuch depositaries in payment called bonds to be credited when passed\r\nthrough the loan division.  You will require from such depositaries\r\nsufficient money in addition to the called bonds, to insure the\r\nwithdrawal of all deposits on loan account on or before the 1st of\r\nOctober next.  The letter of the department of March 26 is modified\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nIt was said that this was done to relieve the banks, and especially\r\nthe First National and the National Bank of Commerce, of New York,\r\nwhich in closing out the refunding operations had, as already\r\nstated, made large subscriptions for themselves and others, and it\r\nwas intimated that I was interested in these banks.  This innuendo\r\nwas without foundation or excuse, and was made merely to create a\r\npolitical sensation.  This order was made, not at the request of\r\nthe banks, for they were entirely prepared to pay the money, but\r\nat the urgent demand of business men, that the currency should not\r\nbe withdrawn from the banks where it was employed in active business,\r\nand be deposited in the treasury where it would lay idle.\r\n\r\nI thus explained the matter to the Chamber of Commerce, and to the\r\npublic at large.  I felt that it would not be advisable for me to\r\ndrain the money market of legal tenders, and to hoard them in the\r\ntreasury to await the presentation of called bonds.  If such a\r\ncourse had been adopted, the clamor would have been louder and more\r\njust.  The order, no doubt, had a happy effect, as the running\r\naccounts were rapidly and quietly closed, by the payment of the\r\ncalled bonds, without any disturbance in the money market.  The\r\nclamor made was beneficial because it induced the holders of the\r\ncalled bonds to send them in for payment, in which I greatly\r\nrejoiced.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of that day a reception was given to me at the\r\nLincoln club.  While it was going on a large crowd, headed by a\r\nband, approached the clubhouse, and loudly insisted that I should\r\nspeak to them.  As this was a political club, I felt at liberty,\r\non being introduced by Warner M. Bateman, to make a political\r\nspeech, mainly devoted to my early friend, General Ewing, and his\r\npeculiar notions of finance.  This was reported in the papers at\r\nthe time.  If there was too much political feeling manifested in\r\nmy speeches at this period, it may be partly excused by the extreme\r\nviolence of denunciation of me by Democratic speakers and\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening I visited Wielert's pavilion, on Vine Street,\r\nwhere the usual evening concert was being given.  The visitors were\r\nmainly German citizens, and, as such, were known to be in favor of\r\na sound currency based upon gold and silver.  The orchestra at once\r\nstopped the piece they were playing, and played the \"Star Spangled\r\nBanner,\" amid the cheering of the assemblage.  They insisted upon\r\na speech, and I said:\r\n\r\n\"When I came here to-night I did not expect to make a speech, as\r\nI have made one already.  I only came to see the people enjoy\r\nthemselves, to drink a glass of that good old German beverage,\r\nbeer, and to listen to the music.  I am very happy to meet you,\r\nand shall carry away with me a kindly remembrance of your greeting.\r\nAll I want, and that is what we all want, is honest money.  A dollar\r\nin paper is now worth a dollar in gold or silver anywhere in this\r\ncountry, and we want affairs so shaped that the paper money issued\r\nmay be exchanged anywhere or under any circumstances for gold or\r\nsilver.  That is my idea of honest money.  [Cries, 'That is so.'\r\n'That is ours, too,' etc.]  We may be assured that such shall be\r\nthe character of the money in our country if the people will sustain\r\nthe party which has equalized the values of the paper and metal\r\nmoneys.  Again I thank you for your kind reception.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to Washington and remained there during the month of\r\nSeptember, actively employed in the duties of the department.\r\nDuring this month nearly all the outstanding called bonds were\r\npresented and paid, and all sums deposited with national banks\r\nduring the operation of refunding were paid into the treasury and\r\nthese accounts closed.\r\n\r\nFruitful crops in the United States, and a large demand for them\r\nin Europe, caused an accumulation of coin in this country.  Much\r\nof it came through the customhouse in New York, but most of it was\r\nin payment for cotton and provisions.  It was readily exchanged\r\nfor United States notes and silver certificates.  As all forms of\r\nmoney were of equal purchasing power and paper money was much more\r\nconvenient to handle than coin, the exchange of coin, by the holders\r\nof it, for notes or certificates, was a substantial benefit to them\r\nand strengthened the treasury.  I promoted these exchanges as far\r\nas the law allowed.  I deemed it wise to distribute this coin among\r\nthe several sub-treasuries of the United States, maintaining always\r\nthe reserve for the redemption of United States notes in the sub-\r\ntreasury in New York as the law required.  For this purpose I issued\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,           }\r\n  \"Washington, September 19, 1879.}\r\n\"Gold coin beyond the needs of the government having accumulated\r\nin the treasury of the United States, by the deposit in the several\r\npublic assay offices of fine bars and foreign coin, for which the\r\ndepositors have been paid, at their option, in United States notes,\r\nthe treasurer of the United States, and the several assistant\r\ntreasurers at Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati,\r\nChicago, St. Louis, New Orleans and San Francisco, are hereby\r\nauthorized to pay out gold coin as well as silver coin and notes\r\nupon the current obligations of the government, and upon advances\r\nto disbursing officers, as may be convenient and practicable.\r\nTransfers of coin for this purpose will be made to any assistant\r\ntreasurer, when necessary, by the treasurer of the United States,\r\nupon application to him.  The treasurer of the United States in\r\nthis city, upon the receipt by him of a certificate of deposit\r\nissued by the United States assistant treasurer at New York, stating\r\nthat there has been deposited with him legal tender notes in the\r\nsum of $100 or multiples thereof, will also cause to be shipped\r\nfrom the mint to the depositor, at his risk and expense, a like\r\namount of gold coin.  Standard silver dollars may also be obtained\r\nas heretofore.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this policy was beneficial, though the demand for\r\ncoin rarely existed except for foreign exchange, and this was\r\ngenerally in New York, and largely depended upon the balance of\r\ntrade.  Our people had been so accustomed to the use of paper money\r\nthat they received and paid United States notes in preference to\r\ncoin, and this more readily since these notes were equal in purchasing\r\npower to coin.\r\n\r\nSenator Thurman, my colleague and personal friend, was active in\r\nthe canvass in Ohio.  His term expired on the 4th of March, 1881,\r\nand he was a candidate for re-election by the legislature about to\r\nbe chosen.  I heard of his speeches, especially those in respect\r\nto resumption.  He commented upon the fact that United States notes\r\nwere only redeemed in the city of New York, and claimed that we\r\nhad not actually resumed, for gold was not in circulation.  He\r\nappealed to his audiences to say whether they had any gold and\r\nwhether they were not compelled to receive the same greenbacks then\r\nas they had since the period of the war, and said if they wanted\r\ngold they had to go to New York for it.  I regarded this as a piece\r\nof demagogism, for he knew the difference between the greenbacks\r\nthen and the greenbacks before resumption.  Hearing that he was to\r\nspeak in Bellaire shortly I arranged to have certain disbursements\r\nfor wages in that neighborhood made in gold coin.  When he made\r\nhis speech in Bellaire, soon afterwards, he repeated the same\r\nstatements that he had previously made, and appealed to the audience\r\nto know whether they had seen any of the gold coin they had heard\r\nso much about.  Much to his surprise and embarrassment quite a\r\nnumber of persons held up and shook gold coin.  This put a stop to\r\nhis inquiries.  The people appreciated the advance in the purchasing\r\npower of their money, and neither demanded coin nor cared for it.\r\n\r\nEarly in October I yielded to the urgent request of Mr. Foster to\r\nhelp in the closing days of the canvass, and, on the evening of\r\nthe 8th, addressed a meeting at the west front of the capitol in\r\nColumbus, far exceeding in numbers any political gathering during\r\nthe campaign.  My opening will indicate the general trend of my\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\"It is not within my power to reach with my voice all who have\r\nassembled on this occasion, and besides, for some time I have not\r\nbeen much in the habit of speaking in the open air, and don't know\r\nhow long my voice will hold out, but I think I will be able to say\r\nall that you will desire to hear from me, as I will be followed by\r\na gentleman distinguished in war and able to supply any imperfections\r\nin my address.\r\n\r\n\"When I was here in August last it appeared that the great point\r\nin the political contest in which we were about to engage was\r\nwhether the people of Ohio would stand fast to the resumption of\r\nspecie payments, which the Republicans, by a steady and patient\r\ncourage and unswerving conviction, had finally brought to a successful\r\nconsummation on the 1st day of January last, or whether the people\r\nof Ohio would yield to the wild and fanciful ideas of inflation,\r\nand desert the great good that had been accomplished after so long\r\na trial.\r\n\r\n\"The Democratic party, which had been holding the honored principles\r\nof that party, seemed to be willing to go after strange gods, and\r\nto form new alliances, to do anything to gain success, and that\r\nold party sought to form at least temporary alliances, so that the\r\npeople would forget the great issue, and follow after these strange\r\nand delusive ideas of which I will speak.  Therefore it was that\r\nmy friend General Ewing was nominated for Governor of Ohio, with\r\nthe expectation that as he had advanced some such ideas in times\r\npast, a coalition would be made between the parties naturally\r\nhostile, and that the State of Ohio would be thus gained for the\r\nDemocratic ticket.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of my remarks I read an extract from General Ewing's\r\nspeech of the year before, in which he stated that if we were out\r\nof debt to foreign countries, and if our foreign commerce floated\r\nunder our own flag, resumption in gold and silver would be impossible\r\non the then volume of paper money; that if it were attempted the\r\ndesperadoes of Wall street and the money kings of England would\r\npresent greenbacks, and take the gold as fast as it could be paid\r\nover the counter of the treasury.  I said in reply:\r\n\r\n\"Not a year rolled around until this resumption came, and these\r\nWall street desperadoes and these money kings of Europe, instead\r\nof coming and demanding our gold in exchange for greenbacks, now\r\nbring their gold to us and want greenbacks for it.\r\n\r\n\"The money kings of Europe have brought us gold--$36,900,000 in\r\ngold coin from France--and the English have brought their gold and\r\nexchanged it for United States notes.  And these Wall street\r\ndesperadoes are as eager to get our greenbacks as you are.  They\r\ndon't want the gold at all and we cannot put it on them.  Why, my\r\ncountrymen, United States notes may now travel the circuit of the\r\nworld with undiminished honor, and be everywhere redeemed at par\r\nin coin.  They are made redeemable everywhere, and at this moment\r\nthe greenback is worth a premium on the Pacific coast and in the\r\nHawaiian Islands, and in China and Japan it is worth par; and in\r\nevery capital of Europe, in Berlin, in Paris, in London, an American\r\ntraveling may go anywhere in the circuit of the civilized world,\r\nand take no money with him except United States notes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, General Ewing was mistaken.  Well, why don't General\r\nEwing come down and say 'I was mistaken?'  [A voice, 'He will come\r\ndown.']  Yes, after next Tuesday he will.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day I spoke at Springfield to an audience nearly as\r\nlarge, following the general lines of my Columbus speech.  On the\r\nfollowing day I spoke at Lancaster from a stand in front of the\r\ntown hall, in plain sight of the house in which General Ewing and\r\nI were born.  I spoke of General Ewing in very complimentary terms,\r\nsaid we had been intimate friends from boyhood, that our fathers\r\nhad been friends and neighbors, but that he and I then found\r\nourselves on opposite sides of a very important question.  I\r\nexpressed my respect for the sincerity of General Ewing's motives,\r\nbut believed that he was thoroughly and radically wrong.  I said\r\nI wished to state frankly how he was wrong, and to what dangerous\r\nconsequences the fruit of his errors would lead, and I wanted the\r\npeople of Lancaster to judge between us.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday before the election I spoke in Massillon.  By some\r\nmisunderstanding I was advertised to speak on that afternoon at\r\nboth Massillon and Mansfield, but, by an arrangement subsequently\r\nmade, I spoke at Massillon to one of the largest meetings of the\r\ncampaign, and then was taken by special train to Mansfield in time\r\nto make my closing speech in the canvass.  It was late in the\r\nafternoon, but the crowd that met to hear me remained until my\r\narrival, of which the following account was given by the local\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n\"But the grand ovation was reserved for our distinguished townsman,\r\nSecretary Sherman.  There were acres of men, women, and children\r\nand vehicles at the depot to meet him, and as he stepped from the\r\ncars he was greeted with the booming of cannon, the music of half\r\na dozen bands, and the loud and long acclaim that came from the\r\nthroats of the immense concourse of friends.  A thousand hands of\r\nold neighbors were stretched out to grasp his as he moved along\r\nwith great difficulty, piloted by the reception committee, through\r\nthe vast and surging crowd.  Cheer after cheer went up on every\r\nimaginable pretext, and many times calls for 'Three cheers for John\r\nSherman, our next President,' were honored with a power and enthusiasm\r\nthat left no room for doubt as to the intensity of the devotion\r\nfelt for him at his old home.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection I wish to say once for all that I have been\r\nunder the highest obligations to the people of Mansfield during my\r\nentire life, from boyhood to old age.  I have, with rare exceptions,\r\nand without distinction of party, received every kindness and favor\r\nwhich anyone could receive from his fellow-citizens, and if I have\r\nnot been demonstrative in exhibiting my appreciation and gratitude,\r\nit has nevertheless been entertained, and I wish in this way to\r\nacknowledge it.\r\n\r\nIn opening my address in the evening I said:\r\n\r\n\"My fellow-townsmen, I regret your disappointment of to-day, that,\r\nby some misunderstanding as to the hour of your meeting, I felt it\r\nmy duty, in obedience to the request of the state committee, to\r\nattend the great mass meeting as Massillon this afternoon, and now\r\ncome before you wearied and hoarse, to speak of the political\r\nquestions of the day.\r\n\r\n\"When I was in Ohio in August last, the chief question in the\r\npending political canvass was, whether the resumption of specie\r\npayments, so long and steadily struggled for, and happily accomplished\r\nby the Republican party, should be maintained, or whether it should\r\ngive way to certain wild and erratic notions in favor of irredeemable\r\npaper money.  Upon this issue General Ewing was nominated by the\r\nDemocratic party, in the hope that he would gain support from a\r\nthird party committed to inflation.  Since then it would appear\r\nthat the Democratic leaders seek to change the issue.  The same\r\nold questions about the rights of states to nullify the laws of\r\nthe United States--the same old policy to belittle and degrade our\r\nnational government into a mere confederacy of states--are now\r\nthrust forward into prominence.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following Tuesday I voted, and immediately started for\r\nWashington.  The news of the triumphant election of Foster and\r\nHickenlooper, by over 30,000 majority, and a Republican majority\r\nof twenty-five in the legislature, reached me while on the train.\r\n\r\nThe management by Governor Foster of his canvass, and his work in\r\nit, was as laborious and effective as any ever conducted in Ohio.\r\nHe visited every county in the state, often made four or five\r\nspeeches in a day, and kept special railroad trains in motion all\r\nthe while, carrying him from place to place.  He is not, in the\r\nusual sense, an orator, but in his numerous campaigns he has always\r\nmade clear and effective statements which the people could understand.\r\nHis manner is pleasing, without pretension or gush.  He had been\r\nelected to Congress several times in a district strongly Democratic.\r\nIn the campaign of 1879 he adopted the same plan that had been so\r\nsuccessful when he was a candidate for Congress.  He was an\r\nexperienced and efficient hand-shaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nLAST DAYS OF THE HAYES ADMINISTRATION.\r\nInvitation From General Arthur to Speak in New York--Letter to Hon.\r\nJohn Jay on the Subject--Mr. Evarts' Refined Specimen of Egotism--\r\nAn Anecdote of the Hayes Cabinet--Duty of the Government to Protect\r\nthe Election of All Federal Officers--My Speech in Cooper Institute\r\n--Offers of Support to Elect Me as a Successor of Senator Thurman\r\n--My Replies--Republican Victory in New York--President Hayes'\r\nMessage to Congress--My Report as Secretary of the Treasury--\r\nModification of My Financial Views Since that Time--Bank Notes as\r\nCurrency--Necessity for Paper Money--Mr. Bayard's Resolution\r\nConcerning the Legal Tender Quality of United States Notes--Questions\r\nAsked Me by the Finance Committee of the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of September I was invited by General Arthur,\r\nas chairman of the Republican state committee of New York, to speak\r\nto the Republicans of that state during the pending canvass, in\r\naid of election of Mr. Cornell as governor.  The circumstances of\r\nthe removal of Arthur and Cornell caused some doubt whether I should\r\naccept the invitation, as it seemed that the nomination of Cornell\r\nand the management of the canvass by Arthur was an expression of\r\ntriumph, and my acceptance would be regarded as a humiliation of\r\nthe President.  I did not think so and in this opinion the President\r\nconcurred.  I, therefore, accepted the invitation by the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,           }\r\n  \"Washington, September 29, 1879.}\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of\r\nthe 25th inst., inviting me to speak to the Republicans in New York\r\nsome time during the pending campaign.  It will give me great\r\npleasure to do my utmost in aid of the election of Mr. Cornell and\r\nthe Republican ticket at the coming election, and I wish I could\r\naccept your invitation without reserve; but in view of engagements\r\nmade in Ohio, and the official duties incumbent upon me, I cannot\r\nmake any more definite reply than to say that by the middle of\r\nOctober I hope to be able to set aside two or three days to be\r\nspent in your canvass at such places as you may think I can render\r\nthe most satisfactory service.  I have also received an invitation\r\nfrom Mr. Johnson, secretary of your committee.  Please consider\r\nthis an answer.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"To General C. A. Arthur,\r\n  \"Chairman Republican State Committee, New York.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterward I received a letter from Hon. John Jay, expressing\r\nregret at my acceptance, for the reasons I have stated.  To this\r\nI replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"October 4, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your note of the 2nd is received.\r\n\r\n\"I feel as you do that the nomination of Mr. Cornell, and the\r\nappointment of Mr. Arthur to conduct the canvass, has the look of\r\na reproach to the President for their removal.  If only their\r\npersonal interests were involved, I should feel great indifference\r\nto their success, but it so happens that Republican success in New\r\nYork is of such vital importance to the people of the United States,\r\nthat their personal interest in the matter, and even the motive of\r\nthe nomination and appointment, should be overlooked, with a view to\r\nsecure the country against the return to power of the Democratic\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"We must carry New York next year, or see all the results of the\r\nwar overthrown and the constitutional amendments absolutely nullified.\r\nWe cannot do this if our friends defeat a Republican candidate for\r\ngovernor fairly nominated, and against whom, there are no substantial\r\ncharges affecting his integrity.  Besides, the nomination of Mr.\r\nCornell could easily have been prevented if the friends of the\r\nPresident and the administration had aided to defeat it.  He was\r\nnominated by our acquiescence, and we should not now complain of\r\nit.  The expediency of holding the meeting you propose, depends\r\nentirely upon the question whether or not it would aid the Republican\r\ncause this fall.  I am inclined to think it would not, that such\r\na meeting would deter Republicans from supporting the regular ticket\r\nand, therefore, is ill advised.  I thus frankly state my opinion\r\nas you ask it, but without any desire in any way to influence that\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. John Jay, Katonah, N. Y.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the election in Ohio I received from General Arthur a list\r\nof appointments for me in New York, which if I had attempted to\r\nfill would have overtaxed my strength.  Mr. Evarts had also been\r\ninvited, but limited his acceptance to one speech to be made in\r\nCooper Institute.  I complained to him that it was not fair to\r\nrequest of me so many speeches where he, a citizen of that state,\r\nagreed to make but one.  His answer was characteristic.  He said:\r\n\"Well, Mr. Sherman, when the people of New York wish my views upon\r\npublic questions they arrange for a meeting in Cooper Institute,\r\nor some such place.  I make the speech and it is printed and is\r\nread.\"  I thought this, under the circumstances, a refined specimen\r\nof egotism, meaning that he had only to pronounce his opinion to\r\nattract universal attention and he need not therefore repeat his\r\nspeech at any other place.\r\n\r\nThis incident recalls to my mind a specimen of his keen wit.  Among\r\nthe early meetings of the cabinet President Hayes announced three\r\nor four personal appointments that he intended to make, mainly in\r\nthe foreign service, in the department of which Mr. Evarts was the\r\nhead.  Evarts seemed to be surprised at these appointments, and\r\nafter some pause he said:  \"Mr. President, I have never had the\r\ngood fortune to see the 'great western reserve' of Ohio, of which\r\nwe have heard so much.\"  For a moment Hayes did not perceive the\r\nquiet sarcasm of Mr. Evarts, which was a polite expression of his\r\nfeeling that he should have been consulted about these nominations\r\nbefore they were announced.  We all caught the idea and the President\r\njoined heartily in the laughter.  Mr. Evarts is not only a man of\r\nkeen wit, but is a great lawyer and able advocate.  I learned, from\r\nmy intimate association with him in the cabinet, and subsequently\r\nin the Senate as a member of the committee on foreign relations,\r\nto respect and love him.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of October, when on my way to New York, at the request\r\nof General Kilpatrick I made a speech at Paterson, New Jersey, on\r\nthe occasion of the ratification of the Republican nominations.\r\nIn this speech I expressed my opinions upon the subject of fraudulent\r\nelections, especially in the south, and, while the government has\r\nnot been able at any time to completely protect the ballot box in\r\nseveral states, the opinions I then expressed are still entertained.\r\nI believe the right of each lawful voter to vote in national\r\nelections should be enforced by the power of the national government\r\nin every state and territory of the Union.  I said at this time:\r\n\r\n\"Now I want to serve notice on the Democratic party, that the\r\nRepublican party has resolved upon two things, and it never makes\r\nup its mind upon anything until it is determined to put it through.\r\n_We are going to see that every lawful voter in this country has\r\na right to vote one honest ballot at every national election, and\r\nno more_.  If the Democratic party stands in the way, so much the\r\nworse for the Democratic party.  If the south, rebellious as it\r\nis, stands in the way again, we will protect every voter in his\r\nright to vote wherever the constitution gives the right to vote.\r\nLocal elections must be regulated by state laws.  Southern voters\r\nmay cheat each other as they please in local elections.  The\r\nRepublican party never trenched on the rights of states, and does\r\nnot intend to.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever national officers or Congressmen are elected, those are\r\nnational elections, and, under the plain provisions of the\r\nconstitution, the nation has the right to protect them.  The\r\nRepublican party intends, if the present law is not strong enough,\r\n_to make it stronger_.  In the south 1,000,000 Republicans are\r\ndisfranchised.  With the help of Almighty God, we intend to right\r\nthat wrong.  Congress has a right to regulate congressional elections.\r\nThe Tweed frauds, reversing the vote of New York state in 1868,\r\nled to the passage of the first federal election law, breaking up\r\nfalse counts.  Then the Mississippi plan was introduced in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n\"If Congress was purged to-day of men elected by fraud and bloodshed\r\nin the south, the Democrats would be in a pitiful minority in the\r\ncapital.  At the last session the Democrats tried to repeal the\r\nelection laws, and were met by veto after veto from the stanch\r\nRepublican President.  Then they tried to nullify existing laws.\r\nWe must as firmly resist nullification now as when Jackson threatened\r\n'by the eternal God' to hang the original nullifier, Calhoun.  _We\r\nmust have free elections_.  We are determined to assert the _supremacy\r\nof the United States in all matters pertaining to the United States_,\r\nand to _enforce the laws of the United States, come what will_.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration of mine at the time created a good deal of criticism,\r\nespecially in the New York papers, but, in spite of this, my\r\nconvictions have grown stronger with time that it is the imperative\r\nduty of the national government to protect the election of all\r\nfederal officers, including Members of Congress, by wise conservative\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of October I spoke in Cooper Institute, confining myself\r\nmainly to an exposition and defense of the financial policy of the\r\nadministration.  This was hardly needed in the city of New York\r\nthough, as Evarts said of his speech, I knew what I said would be\r\nprinted, and people who were not familiar with financial topics\r\ncould read it.  The commercial papers, while approving the general\r\ntenor of the speech, complained that I did not advocate the retirement\r\nof the legal tender notes of the government.  They seemed then, as\r\nthey do now, to favor a policy that would withdraw the government\r\nfrom all participation in furnishing a currency.  I have always\r\nhonestly entertained the opinion that the United States should\r\nfurnish the body of circulating notes required for the convenience\r\nof the people, and I do yet entertain it, but the notes should\r\nalways be maintained at parity with coin.  In the cities generally,\r\nwhere banks have great influence and where circulating notes are\r\nsuperseded in a great measure by checks, drafts and clearing house\r\ncertificates, the wants of the people for paper money secured by\r\nthe highest sanction of law and by the promise and credit of the\r\ngovernment are not appreciated.  In this speech I referred to the\r\nbanks as follows:\r\n\r\n\"They [the banks] are interwoven with all the commercial business\r\nof the country, and their loans and discounts form our most active\r\nand useful capital. . . . The abolition of the national banks would\r\ninevitably lead to the incorporation of state banks, especially in\r\nbankrupt states, where any expedient to make paper money cheap will\r\nbe quickly resorted to. . . . It will open the question of the\r\nrepeal of the provisions of the loan laws fixing a limit to the\r\namount of United States notes, and thus will shock the public credit\r\nand raise new questions of authority which the Supreme Court would\r\nprobably declare to be unconstitutional.  Free banking open to all,\r\nwith prompt and easy redemption, supplies a currency to meet the\r\nvarying wants of different periods and seasons.  Who would risk\r\nsuch a question to the changing votes of Congress?\"\r\n\r\nI must add, however, that I do not believe the banking system would\r\nbe sustained by popular opinion unless the great body of our currency\r\nwas in the form of United States notes or certificates based upon\r\ncoin.  If there is any profit in the circulation of such notes, it\r\nought to inure to the government.  The circulation of banks should\r\nonly be equal to the local demands for currency and should always\r\nbe amply secured, as now, by the deposit of United States bonds,\r\nor some substitute for these bonds equally valuable, when the\r\nnational bonds shall be redeemed.  This security ought not to extend\r\nbeyond the amount of bank notes actually outstanding, leaving the\r\nsecurity of deposits by individuals to depend upon the assets of\r\neach bank.  The duty of the government is performed when it guards\r\nwith undoubted security the payment of the circulating notes issued\r\nby the banks.  In this speech I spoke of the resumption act and\r\nthe history of resumption as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The resumption act was a Republican measure, supported, advocated\r\nand voted for by Republican Senators and Members, and without the\r\naid of a single Democrat in either House of Congress.  It has been\r\nadhered to and successfully executed by that party.  The Republican\r\nparty has won no victory more complete than the passage, execution\r\nand success of the resumption act.  This measure was adopted in\r\nJanuary, 1875, in the midst of the panic, when our paper money was\r\nworth only 85 cents on the dollar.  It was a period of wild\r\nspeculation and inflation.  The rate of interest was higher than\r\nbefore or since--the government paying six per cent. in gold,\r\ncorporations in fair credit from eight to ten per cent., and\r\nindividuals from ten to twelve per cent.  Recklessness in contracting\r\ndebts was universal.  Railroads were built where they were not\r\nneeded; furnaces were put up in excess of all possible demands;\r\nand over-production and over-trading occurred in all branches of\r\nbusiness.  The balance of trade for ten years had been steadily\r\nagainst us, with an aggregate excess of imports over exports of\r\nover $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"The panic of 1873 put an end to all these wild, visionary schemes,\r\nand left the country prostrate and in ruin.  All business enterprises\r\nwere paralyzed.  Congress, in a hopeless quandary, looked in vain\r\nfor some way of escape from the bankruptcy which threatened every\r\ninterest and every individual.  Then it was the Republican party\r\ndevised and placed upon the statute book the resumption act, and,\r\nagainst noisy opposition and continual speaking, steadily persevered\r\nin its execution.\r\n\r\n* * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Now that resumption is a success, Democrats say the Republican\r\nparty did not bring it about, but that Providence has done it; that\r\nbountiful crops here and bad crops in Europe have been the cause\r\nof all the prosperity that has come since resumption.  We gratefully\r\nacknowledge that Providence has been on the side of the Republican\r\nparty, or rather, that, having sought to do right, we find ourselves\r\nsupported by Divine Providence, and we are grateful to the Almighty\r\nfor the plentiful showers and favorable seasons that brought us\r\ngood crops; but we also remember that it was the passage of the\r\nresumption act, the steady steps toward resumption, the accumulation\r\nof the coin reserve, the economy of the people, and their adjustment\r\nof business affairs to the time fixed for resumption, that, with\r\nthe blessings of Divine Providence, brought us resumption.\r\n\r\n\"We should be, and are, thankful to the Almighty, but we are under\r\nno thanks whatever to the Democratic party.  It has not, for twenty-\r\nfive years, had Providence on its side, but we may fairly infer\r\nthat, as it has steadily resisted Providence and patriotic duty\r\nfor more than twenty years, it must have had the devil on its side.\r\nDemocrats can claim no credit, but stand convicted of a blundering\r\nmistake in abandoning the old and tried principles of their party,\r\nand following after strange gods with the hope of a brief and\r\npartial success.  They have failed, and that dogma for hard money,\r\nwhich they abandoned, has been adopted by the Republican party, as\r\nthe corner stone of its greatest success.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke at Albany, Rochester, and Syracuse, and, on my way to\r\nWashington, at New Brunswick, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nAfter the election in Ohio, I received several letters from members\r\nof the legislature, offering their support to me as a candidate\r\nfor United States Senator, to be elected in January to succeed Mr.\r\nThurman, for the term commencing on the 4th of March, 1881.  Among\r\nthem was a letter from L. M. Dayton, a member of the general assembly\r\nfrom Hamilton county, to which I replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., November 2, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your note of the 30th ult., in which you inquire\r\nwhether I will be a candidate for election as Senator of the United\r\nStates in place of Senator Thurman, is received.\r\n\r\n\"Early last summer, when this subject was first mentioned to me by\r\npersonal friends, I freely expressed my conviction that as the\r\ngeneral assembly of Ohio had three times conferred upon me this\r\nhigh and much coveted honor, I ought not to stand in the way of\r\nothers who might fairly aspire to that position.  I am of the same\r\nopinion now.  During the recent canvass I stated to several gentlemen\r\nwho had been named in the public press as probable candidates, that\r\nI would not be a candidate, and I could not now recede from that\r\nposition without just reproach.\r\n\r\n\"Please say so to your fellow members, and accept my hearty thanks\r\nfor your partiality.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. L. M. Dayton, Cincinnati, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nI also wrote the following letter to Senator A. B. Cole, of\r\nPortsmouth, in reply to a similar offer:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., November 11, 1879.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your very kind letter of the 10th inst. is received.\r\nI thank you again for your offer to support me for the Senate, but\r\nyou will have seen from the letter I wrote to Colonel Dayton, that\r\nI have determined, under the circumstances stated therein, not to\r\nbe a candidate, so that members may feel entirely free to follow\r\ntheir judgment in the selection of the Senator.  I must be impartial\r\nbetween the several candidates.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you also for what you say about the nomination for the\r\npresidency.  Such a nomination would be a very exalted honor, so\r\nmuch so that I ought not to do anything to promote or to defeat\r\nit.  I would be very glad to get the hearty cordial support of the\r\nOhio delegation, and that being granted I am perfectly willing to\r\nabide the decision of the national convention, and will be ready\r\nto support anyone who is nominated.\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to see your son, and hope you will give him a\r\nletter of introduction to me.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. A. B. Cole, Portsmouth, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nCornell was elected Governor of New York, and with him a Republican\r\nlegislature.  The elections generally that fall were in favor of\r\nthe Republican party, but, as both Houses of the 46th Congress were\r\nDemocratic, President Hayes had to conduct executive business with\r\na Congress not in political harmony with him until the 4th of March,\r\n1881, when the term of Congress and of the President expired.  I\r\nfeel bound to say that no merely obstructive financial measures\r\nwere adopted during that Congress.\r\n\r\nThe message of the President, communicated to Congress on the 1st\r\nof December, 1879, dealt with the usual topics of such a document;\r\nbut, instead of commencing with our foreign relations as usual, he\r\nbegan by congratulating Congress on the successful execution of\r\nthe resumption act and the funding of all the public debt redeemable,\r\ninto bonds bearing a lower rate of interest.  He recommended the\r\nsuspension of the coinage of the silver dollar, and the retirement\r\nfrom circulation of United States notes with the capacity of legal\r\ntender.  He held that the issue of such notes during the Civil War\r\nwas not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from\r\nimminent peril, and the protracted use of them as money was not\r\ncontemplated by the framers of the law.  While I did not concur in\r\nall the views stated by the President, especially as to the policy\r\nof retiring United States notes then in circulation, yet his general\r\nconclusions in favor of the coin standard were, in my view, sound\r\nand just.  I was very willing to hold on to the progress made in\r\nmaking United States notes equivalent to coin rather than to attempt\r\nto secure their retirement from circulation.\r\n\r\nIn the report made by me as Secretary of the Treasury I stated my\r\nopinion that the existing law was ample to enable the department\r\nto maintain resumption upon the volume of United States notes then\r\noutstanding; but added, that in view of the large inflow of gold\r\ninto the country, and the high price of public securities, it would\r\nseem to be a favorable time to invest a portion of the sinking fund\r\nin United States notes to be retired and canceled, and in this way\r\ngradually to reduce the maximum of such notes to the sum of\r\n$300,000,000, the amount named in the resumption act.\r\n\r\nI would not make such a recommendation now, as I am convinced that\r\nUnited States notes based on coin in the treasury are the best form\r\nof currency yet devised, and that the volume might be gradually\r\nincreased as the volume of business increases.  Since resumption\r\nsuch notes have been maintained at par with coin by holding in the\r\ntreasury coin to the amount of thirty per cent. of the notes\r\noutstanding.  This coin, lying idle and yielding no interest, costs\r\nthe government the interest on an equal amount of bonds, or a\r\nfraction over one per cent. on the sum of United States notes in\r\ncirculation.  These notes are a part of the debt of the United\r\nStates, and if redeemed, must be paid by the issue of $346,000,000\r\nof bonds.  I see no reason why the people of the United States\r\nshould not have the benefit of this cheap loan rather than the\r\nnational banks, and there are many reasons why the issue of a like\r\namount of notes by national banks cannot fill the place or perform\r\nthe functions of United States notes.  The issue of bank notes\r\nwould be governed by the opinions and interest of the banks, and\r\nthe amount could be increased or diminished according to their\r\ninterests and without regard to the public good.  As an auxiliary\r\nand supplement to United States notes, bank notes may be issued as\r\nnow when amply secured by United States bonds, but it would be a\r\ndangerous experiment to confine our paper money to bank notes alone,\r\nthe amount of which would depend upon the interest, hopes and fears\r\nof corporations which would be guided alone by the supposed interests\r\nof their stockholders.\r\n\r\nThere is another objection to a sole dependence on bank notes as\r\ncurrency:  They cannot be made a legal tender either by the states\r\nor the United States, while it is settled by the Supreme Court that\r\nnotes of the United States may be made a legal tender, a function\r\nthat ought to belong to money.\r\n\r\nI know that my views on this subject are not entertained by the\r\ninfluential class of our citizens who manage our banks, but in this\r\nI prefer the opinion and interest of the great body of our people,\r\nwho instinctively prefer the notes of the United States, supported\r\nby coin reserves, to any form of bank paper that has yet been\r\ndevised.  The only danger in our present currency is that the amount\r\nmay be increased to a sum that cannot be maintained at par with\r\ncoin, but the same or a greater danger would exist if the volume\r\nof paper money should be left to the interested opinion of bankers\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes claimed that neither the government nor banks should\r\nissue paper money, that coin only is money.  It is sufficient to\r\nsay that all commercial nations have been constrained by necessity\r\nto provide some form of paper money as a substitute for coin.  The\r\nexperience of the United States has proven this necessity and for\r\nmany years our people were compelled to rely upon state bank notes\r\nas a medium of exchange, with resulting loss and bankruptcy.  For\r\nthe want of paper money at the commencement of the Civil War, the\r\nUnited States was compelled to issue its notes and to make them a\r\nlegal tender.  Without this the effort to preserve the Union would\r\nhave utterly failed.  With such a lesson before us it is futile to\r\nattempt to conduct the business of a great country like ours with\r\ncoin alone.  Gold can only be a measure or standard of value, but\r\ncannot be the current money of the country.  Silver also can only\r\nbe used as money for the small transactions of life, its weight\r\nand bulk forbidding its use in commerce or trade.  The fluctuations\r\nin market value of these metals make it impossible to permit the\r\nfree coinage of both at any ratio with each other without demonetizing\r\none of them.  The cheaper money will always be the money in\r\ncirculation.  Wherever free coinage now exists silver is the only\r\nmoney, while where gold is the standard, silver is employed as a\r\nsubsidiary coin, maintained at par in gold by the mandate of the\r\ngovernment and its receipt for or redemption in gold.  The only\r\nproposed remedy for this fluctuation is an agreement by commercial\r\nnations upon a common ratio, but thus far all efforts for such an\r\nagreement have failed.  If successful the result might not be as\r\nsatisfactory as anticipated.\r\n\r\nI urged, in my report, the importance of adjusting the coinage\r\nratio of the two metals by treaties with commercial nations, and,\r\nuntil this could be done, of limiting the coinage of the silver\r\ndollar to such sum as, in the opinion of Congress, would enable\r\nthe department to readily maintain the standard dollars of gold\r\nand silver at par with each other.\r\n\r\nIn this report I stated the refunding transactions already described,\r\nand recommended the refunding of all bonds of the United States in\r\nthe same manner as they became redeemable.  This was successfully\r\nexecuted by my successors in office.  I was able to say truly of\r\nthe treasury department, in conclusion:\r\n\r\n\"The organization of the several bureaus is such, and the system\r\nof accounting so perfect, that the financial transactions of the\r\ngovernment during the past two years, aggregating $3,354,345,040.53,\r\nhave been adjusted without question, with the exception of a few\r\nsmall balances now in the process of collection, of which it is\r\nbelieved the government will eventually lose less than $13,000, or\r\nless than four mills on each $1,000 of the amount involved.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the legal tender quality of United States notes,\r\ndiscussed in my report, was followed, on the 3rd of December, by\r\nthe introduction in the Senate of a resolution by Mr. Bayard as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved, etc._, That from and after the passage of this resolution\r\nthe treasury notes of the United States shall be receivable for\r\nall dues to the United States excepting duties on imports, and\r\nshall not otherwise be a legal tender; and any of said notes\r\nhereafter reissued shall bear this inscription.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution, while pending in the committee, was debated at\r\nsome length, and reported back adversely on the 15th of January,\r\n1880, by Mr. Allison, from a majority of the committee.  Mr. Bayard\r\npresented the views of the minority in favor of the resolution.\r\nIt was subsequently discussed at considerable length by Mr. Coke,\r\nof Texas, and Mr. Bayard, on opposite sides.  No definite action\r\nwas taken and the matter rested, and I do not recall that it was\r\never again brought before the Senate.  I felt satisfied with the\r\nmajority report, as I doubted the expediency or power of Congress\r\nto deny to these notes any of the qualities conferred upon them by\r\nthe law authorizing their issue, as was the legal tender clause.\r\nThe beneficial result of resumption was appreciated by both parties\r\nand there was no disposition of Congress to pass any legislation\r\non the subject.  The speech of Mr. Bayard, made on the 27th of\r\nJanuary, 1880, was a careful and able review of the whole subject\r\nof legal tender, but it was evident that neither House of Congress\r\nagreed with him in opinion.\r\n\r\nA bill in regard to refunding the debt maturing after the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1881, was introduced in Congress on the 27th of December,\r\n1879, by Fernando Wood, chairman of the committee of ways and means\r\nof the House.  It provided for a change of existing laws so as to\r\nlimit the rate of interest upon the bonds to be issued in such\r\nrefunding to not to exceed three and a half per cent. per annum.\r\nThis bill, if it had been passed, would have prohibited the sale\r\nof all bonds for resumption, as well as for refunding, at a greater\r\nrate of interest than three and a half per cent.  I opposed this\r\nproposition, as it would impair the power of maintaining resumption\r\nin case such bonds could not be sold at par, and the existing law\r\ndid not prevent the secretary from selling those already authorized\r\nat a premium.  No action was taken upon the bill by that Congress,\r\nand Mr. Windom, my successor, found no difficulty in refunding\r\nthese bonds on more favorable terms without any change of existing\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, 1880, I appeared before the finance committee\r\nof the Senate in response to their invitation.  The committee was\r\ncomposed of Senators Bayard (chairman), Kernan, Wallace, Beck,\r\nMorrill, Allison and Ferry, all of whom were present.  Mr. Bayard\r\nstated that a number of propositions, upon which it was desired to\r\nobtain my views, had been submitted by Senator Beck, and then read\r\nthem as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1.  What reason, if any, there is for refusing to pass a bill\r\nauthorizing the receipt of legal tenders for customs dues.\r\n\r\n\"2.  Why the trade dollar should not be converted into a standard\r\ndollar.\r\n\r\n\"3.  What has been the cost of converting the interest-bearing\r\ndebt, as it stood July 14, 1870, to what it is now, including double\r\ninterest, commissions, traveling expenses of agents, etc., and the\r\nuse of public money by banks, and the value of its use, so as to\r\ndetermine whether the system should be continued or changed.\r\n\r\n\"4.  The effect of the abolition of the legal tender quality of\r\ngreenbacks upon the paper currency.\r\n\r\n\"5.  The necessity for a sinking fund and how it is managed.\r\n\r\n\"6.  Whether silver coin received in payment of customs duties has\r\nbeen paid out for interest on the public debt; and if not, why not.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Allison desired to know if this interview was to be\r\nstenographically reported, and the committee decided that it should\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nMy answers to these questions and the colloquy with the committee\r\nin respect to details cover fifty-four printed pages, and give by\r\nfar the most comprehensive statement of treasury operations during\r\nthe two or three years before that meeting, and suggestions for\r\nfuture legislation, that has been written or published.  The length\r\nof the interview prevents its introduction in full, but a statement\r\nof some portions of it may be interesting.  In answer to the first\r\nquestion I said:\r\n\r\n\"The act of February 25, 1862 (section 3694, R. S.), provides that\r\nall the duties on imported goods shall be paid in coin; and the\r\ncoin so paid shall be set apart as a special fund to be applied to\r\ntwo purposes, one of which is the payment in coin of interest on\r\nthe bonds of the United States, and the balance to the sinking fund.\r\n\r\n\"This is an obligation of the government that its coin revenue\r\nshould be applied to the payment of interest on the public debt.\r\nSo long as legal tender notes are maintained at par and parties\r\nare willing to receive them in payment of coin interest, there is\r\nno objection to receiving legal tender notes for customs dues.\r\n\r\n\"Since resumption it has been the practice of the department to\r\nthus receive them, but this practice can be kept up only as long\r\nas parties holding interest obligations are willing to accept the\r\nsame notes in payment thereof.  If, by any unforseen and untoward\r\nevent, the notes should again depreciate in value below coin, the\r\nobligations of the government would still require that interest on\r\nthe public debt be paid in coin; and if customs dues were payable\r\nin legal tender notes, the department would have no source from\r\nwhich to obtain the coin necessary to the payment of interest, for\r\nof course holders of interest obligations would not accept a\r\ndepreciated currency when they were entitled by law to coin.\"\r\n\r\nI reminded the committee that in my report of December, 1878, I\r\nstated that on the 1st of January following I would receive United\r\nStates notes for customs duties.  As these notes were redeemable\r\nin coin, it was unreasonable to require the holder of notes to go\r\nto one government officer to get coin for his notes to pay customs\r\nduties to another government officer.  I held that the United States\r\nnotes had become coin certificates by resumption, and should be\r\ntreated as such.  I informed them that I issued the order with some\r\nreluctance, and only after full examination and upon the statement\r\nof the Attorney General, who thought technically I could treat the\r\nnote as a coin certificate.  I called their attention to the fact\r\nthat I had informed Congress of my purpose to receive United States\r\nnotes for customs duties and had asked specific authority to do\r\nso, but no action was taken, and I was assured that none was needed.\r\nThe conversation that followed showed that they all agreed that\r\nwhat I did was right.  It was evidently better not to provide by\r\nspecific law that the United States notes should be receivable for\r\ncustoms dues, for in case of an emergency the law would be imperative,\r\nwhile, if the matter was left to the discretion of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, he could refuse to receive notes for customs dues\r\nand compel their payment in coin.\r\n\r\nThis led to a long colloquy as to whether the time might come when\r\nthe United States notes could not be redeemed in coin.  I entered\r\ninto a full explanation of the strength of the government, the\r\namount of reserve on hand, the nature of our ability, and said:\r\n\"Still we know that wars may come, pestilence may come, an adverse\r\nbalance of trade, or some contingency of a kind which we cannot\r\nknow of in advance may arise.  I therefore think it is wise to save\r\nthe right of the United States to demand coin for customs duties\r\nif it should be driven to that exigency.\"\r\n\r\nThe question then arose as to the propriety of confining redemption\r\nof notes to one place.  Mr. Wallace inquired whether the government\r\nnotes should not be receivable and interchangeable at every government\r\ndepositary.  I answered that the notes should be received everywhere\r\nat par with coin, but I doubted the propriety of paying coin for\r\nUnited States notes except at one place and that in New York, the\r\nnatural center for financial operations, where most of the customs\r\ndues were paid and where coin could be most safely hoarded.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck examined me at considerable length, and, with his usual\r\nScotch tenacity, insisted, in spite of the attorney general, that\r\nI was not authorized to receive legal tender notes for customs\r\ndues.  He asked me by what authority I claimed this power.  I quoted\r\nthe third section of the resumption act, and gave him a copy of my\r\ncircular letter to officers of customs, dated on the 21st of\r\nDecember, 1878, in which, after calling attention to that section,\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"By reason of this act, you are authorized to receive United State\r\nnotes, as well as gold coin and standard silver dollars, in payment\r\nof duties on imports, on and after the first day of January, 1879.\r\n\r\n\"Notes thus received will in every instance be deposited with the\r\ntreasurer, or some assistant treasurer of the United States, as\r\nare other collections of such duties, to be redeemed, from time to\r\ntime, in coin, on government account, as the convenience of the\r\nservice may demand.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beck then said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to know, Mr. Secretary, whether it is not better, in your\r\nopinion, that the Congress of the United States should prescribe\r\nthe duties of executive officers, so that they can act in pursuance\r\nof law, rather than the executive officer should be acting on his\r\nown notions of what is best?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"I say yes, decidedly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beck inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Is not that what we are proposing to do now, by the passage of\r\nthis law which I seek to have enacted, and are you not opposing\r\nthat condition of things?\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"An executive officer, when there is a doubt about the law, must\r\ngive his own construction of it, but should, of course, readily\r\nconform to the action of Congress as soon as it is declared.  The\r\nobjection I make is not to the passage of a law, but that the bill\r\nas proposed applies it to a possible future state of affairs such\r\nas did not exist when this order was made and does not now.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject then turned to the exchange of trade dollars for standard\r\ndollars.  Mr. Beck said:  \"I have introduced several bills to\r\nfacilitate the exchange of trade for standard dollars.\"  I said:\r\n\r\n\"The bill which I have here is a House bill.  There is no objection\r\nin my mind to the object of this bill; that is, to provide for the\r\nexchange of the trade dollar for the standard silver dollar; the\r\nonly point is whether the trade dollar shall be treated as bullion,\r\nor as a coined dollar of the United States.  Now, I am clearly of\r\nthe opinion that it ought to be treated as so much bullion, issued\r\nat the expense of merchants, for their convenience and benefit,\r\nand without profit to the United States, and therefore not entitled\r\nto any preference over other bullion, and we might say not to so\r\nmuch, because it was issued to private parties for their benefit\r\nand at their cost, but stamped by us merely to enable the coins to\r\nbe used to better advantage in a foreign market.  I have not,\r\ntherefore, any objection to the bill if you allow us to pay the\r\nsame for these trade dollars as for other bullion.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply led to a long examination about silver at home and in\r\nforeign markets, and the objections made to having two silver\r\ndollars, one coined for private persons, from bullion furnished by\r\nthem, and the other coined for the United States from bullion\r\npurchased by it.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck next inquired what effect the abolition of the legal tender\r\nquality of the greenbacks would have on our paper currency.  This\r\nled to a long colloquy between him and myself, in which all the\r\nlaws relating to the subject and the practice of the government,\r\nfrom its organization to that time, were discussed.\r\n\r\nOn the question whether United States notes ought still to be a\r\nlegal tender, I referred him to my report, in which I said:  \"The\r\npower of Congress to make them such was asserted by Congress during\r\nthe war, and was upheld by the Supreme Court.  The power to reissue\r\nthem in time of peace, after they are once redeemed, is still\r\ncontested in that court.\"\r\n\r\nI soon found that Mr. Bayard and Mr. Beck were quite opposed to\r\neach other on this topic, and I suggested that I thought that the\r\nargument upon it should be between them.  My own opinions were\r\nsufficiently stated in the report in which I submitted to Congress\r\nwhether the legal tender should not be repealed as to all future\r\ncontracts, and parties be left to stipulate the mode of payment.\r\nI said that United States notes should still be receivable for all\r\ndues to the government, and ample provision should be made to secure\r\ntheir redemption on demand.\r\n\r\nThe examination, or, rather, conference, took a wide range between\r\nthe members of the committee and myself.  Mr. Beck pressed me to\r\nexpress my opinion of the legal tender which was contained in the\r\nbill introduced by him, providing for a mandatory legal tender of\r\nall forms of money.  I answered:\r\n\r\n\"I do not think, Mr. Senator, you ought to ask me that question,\r\nbecause that is a matter you are called upon to decide and pass\r\nupon in your sphere as a Senator.  I would say, on the other hand,\r\nthat I do not think it ought to have any such effect.  I suppose,\r\nhowever, Mr. Bayard would very frankly tell you what the intention\r\nof the resolution is.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bayard then said:\r\n\r\n\"I know one thing:  That banks cannot compel me to receive their\r\nnotes for debts due me, nor can any man compel me to receive them.\r\nIf the government owes me my salary, I think they could, perhaps,\r\npay me in the national bank notes, under the existing law, but you\r\ncannot compel the payment of a debt between private parties with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"If you will allow me, I should like to amplify a little on one\r\npoint:  I think if Congress would take up this question of the\r\nmodification of the legal tender note and make certain rules of\r\nevidence (which would be clearly constitutional), which good lawyers\r\nundoubtedly approve, declaring that where a contract is made between\r\nparties upon the basis of United States notes, it shall be presumed\r\nby courts, in the affirmance of contracts, that the payment in\r\nUnited States notes shall be a sufficient compliance therewith,\r\nand that, in the absence of any absolute provision to the contrary,\r\npaper money, or promises to pay money, shall be a legal tender in\r\ndischarge of any obligation.\"\r\n\r\nIn respect to the cost of refunding, the next subject of inquiry,\r\nI was able to give them full details, with all the orders of the\r\ntreasury department from the 16th of January, 1878, until the close\r\nof these operations in the summer of 1879.  Many of these details\r\nhad not then been published, but I furnished the fullest information\r\navailable.  In response to an inquiry as to the amount of commissions\r\npaid to the national banks on account of the sale of the four per\r\ncent. bonds, a full table was exhibited of the subscriptions of,\r\nand commissions paid to, the twenty-six national banks chiefly\r\nengaged in this business, in which the total amount of sales made\r\nby them was shown to be $552,929,100, and the amount of commissions\r\npaid was $1,363,070.34.  In exhibiting these tables I said:\r\n\r\n\"Here is a table showing the sales and commissions of certain banks.\r\nI have taken all banks who sold over $1,000,000.  There were twenty-\r\nsix of them.  The First National Bank, having been always connected\r\nwith the national securities and having been the agent of the\r\nsyndicate, continued to be the agent of the foreign syndicate, and\r\ncontinued to have altogether the largest business.  They sold of\r\nthe four per cent. bonds $262,625,000.  The sales of the other\r\nbanks are kept here in the same way.  The Bank of New York (National\r\nBanking Association), I think, was the next.  It sold $57,259,500.\r\nThe National Bank of Commerce sold $51,684,000; the National Bank\r\nof the State of New York sold $46,915,000, and so on down.\"\r\n\r\nI called attention to the fact that in the last sale of about\r\n$200,000,000 four per cent. bonds, we received one-half of one per\r\ncent. premium, or a million dollars, which nearly covered the entire\r\ncommissions paid to the twenty-six banks named.  Full details were\r\ngiven of the various loans, and it was shown that the cost of\r\nselling the last loan was less expensive to the government, in\r\nproportion to the amount sold, than any previous loan.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the sinking fund, about which I was asked my opinion,\r\nI said it was the same old question that had been so often debated.\r\nI explained that a sinking fund is nothing but an obligation or\r\npromise, on the part of the government or an individual, to pay a\r\ncertain amount annually of the principal of the debt in addition\r\nto the interest.  In this way the debt is gradually liquidated and\r\nthe annual interest lessened.  A sinking fund promised by a government\r\nis nothing more or less than a name for the surplus revenue of the\r\ngovernment.  A government without a surplus revenue cannot possibly\r\nhave a sinking fund.  There is no way to pay a debt except by having\r\nan income above your expenditures, and you can call your surplus\r\nrevenue a sinking fund if you choose.  I said that under existing\r\nlaw the department was required to purchase one per cent. of the\r\nentire debt of the United States each fiscal year, and to set the\r\namount apart as a sinking fund, and to compute interest thereon to\r\nbe added with the amount to be subsequently purchased each year.\r\nThis act can only be construed as an authority to purchase the debt\r\nin case of surplus revenue for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn practice, while keeping a book account with the sinking fund,\r\nwe have reduced the debt by the application of surplus revenue more\r\nrapidly than if the requirements of the sinking fund had been\r\nliterally complied with.  At several periods we, in fact, did not\r\nreduce the debt, but actually increased it, and especially within\r\nthe last two years, but in other years of prosperity, when the\r\nrevenues exceeded our expenditures, we were able to pay a much\r\nlarger amount of the debt than the sinking fund required by law.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck said:  \"I propose to inquire pretty carefully, before we\r\nget through with this interview, concerning the immense reduction\r\nof the public debt which has been made, of over $700,000,000, from\r\nthe highest point down to the present, so that we may be governed\r\nin the future taxation by actual requirements of the public service.\"\r\nHe expressed his wish, after he had carefully examined the interview\r\nthus far, to continue it at a future day, but I was not again called\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN 1880.\r\nTalk of Grant for President for a Third Term--His Triumphal Return\r\nfrom a Trip Around the World--The Candidacy of Mr. Blaine and Myself\r\n--Many of My Opponents Those Who Disagreed with Me on Financial\r\nQuestions--Accused of Being a Catholic and of Using Patronage to\r\nAid in My Nomination--My Replies--Delay in Holding the Ohio State\r\nConvention--My Interview with Garfield--Resolution of the State\r\nConvention in My Favor--National Convention at Chicago, on June 2,\r\n1880--Fatal Move of Nine Ohio Delegates for Blaine--Final Nomination\r\nof Garfield--Congratulations--Letter to Governor Foster and to\r\nGarfield--Wade Hampton and the \"Ku-Klux Klan.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the entire period of this session of Congress the nomination\r\nfor President by the Republican national convention was naturally\r\nthe chief subject of interest in political circles.  General Grant\r\nreturned from his voyage around the world arriving in San Francisco\r\nin December, 1879, and from that time until he reached Washington\r\nhis progress was a grand popular ovation.  He had been received in\r\nevery country through which he passed, especially in China and\r\nJapan, with all the honors that could be conferred upon a monarch.\r\nHe made no open declaration of his candidacy, but it was understood\r\nthat he was very willing to again accept the office of President.\r\nHis friends openly avowed their intention to support him, and\r\nanswered the popular objection against a third term by the fact\r\nthat a term had intervened since he last held the office.  Mr.\r\nBlaine was also an avowed candidate and had strong supporters in\r\nevery part of the Union.  My name was mentioned as a candidate,\r\nand it was generally supposed that one of the three would be the\r\nnominee of the Republican convention.  I soon found that the fact\r\nthat I held an office which compelled me to express my opinions\r\nwas a drawback rather than a benefit, and, while I had the natural\r\nambition to attain such a distinction, I was handicapped by my\r\nofficial position.\r\n\r\nThe friends of General Grant succeeded in getting control of the\r\nnational committee and could dictate the time and place for holding\r\nthe convention.  Senator Cameron was chosen chairman of that\r\ncommittee.  He openly avowed his preference for the nomination of\r\nGeneral Grant, and exercised all his influence and power to promote\r\nit.  It was decided to hold the convention on the 2nd of June,\r\n1880, at Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe chief topic of all the newspapers and politicians was the merits\r\nand demerits of the three candidates then recognized as the persons\r\nfrom whom the choice was to be made.  Every charge against either\r\nthe personal character or conduct of each was canvassed with the\r\nbroadest license, and often with great injustice.  The life and\r\nconduct of General Grant were analyzed, and praised or blamed\r\naccording to the bias of the speaker or writer.  Mr. Blaine always\r\nhad a warm and ardent support by the younger Republicans in every\r\npart of the United States.  His brilliant and dashing manner and\r\noratory made him a favorite with all the young and active politicians,\r\nbut, as he was a bold and active fighter, he had enemies as well\r\nas friends.  My strength and weakness grew out of my long service\r\nin the House, Senate and cabinet, but, as my chief active work was\r\nconnected with the financial questions, upon which men of all\r\nparties differed widely, I had to encounter the objections of all\r\nwho were opposed to my views on these questions.  The idea was that\r\nin the certain contest between Grant and Blaine I might be nominated,\r\nin case either of them should fail to receive a majority of the\r\nvotes cast in the convention.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely worth while to point out the changes of opinion\r\nduring the popular discussion that preceded the meeting of the\r\nconvention of which every newspaper was full, the discussion being\r\nuniversal.  Votes were taken and expression of opinion sought in\r\nevery community in the United States.\r\n\r\nMy letter book at this time became a curious mixture of business\r\nand politics, so that I was early compelled to ask two of my personal\r\nfriends to take an office, which I furnished them in the Corcoran\r\nbuilding in Washington, to answer such letters as grew out of the\r\ncontest, and as a place where conferences could be held by persons\r\ninterested in my nomination.  In this way I severed all connection\r\nbetween my duties in the treasury and the necessary correspondence\r\ncaused by my being named as a candidate for President.  I was at\r\nonce charged in the newspaper and even by personal letters, with\r\nall sorts of misdemeanors, of which I was not guilty, but which I\r\nfelt it a humiliation to reply to or even to notice.  Among the\r\nfirst was a statement that in some way or other I was under the\r\ninfluence of the Catholic church, and was giving Catholics an undue\r\nshare of appointments.  My answer is here inserted, not as important,\r\nbut as a specimen of many such communications upon various subjects:\r\n\r\n  \"March 1, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your note of the 20th is received.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your kindness and frankness and will be equally frank\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n\"There is not one shadow of ground for the suspicion stated by you.\r\nI was born, bred, educated and ingrained as a Protestant and never\r\nhad any affinity, directly or indirectly, with the Catholic church,\r\nbut share the common feelings and prejudices of Protestants against\r\nthe special dogmas and rites of that church.  Still I believe the\r\nCatholics have as good a right to their opinions, their mode of\r\nworship, and religious belief as we have, and I would not weaken\r\nor impair the full freedom of religious belief, or make any contest\r\nagainst them on account of it for all the offices in Christendom.\r\nI have no sympathy whatever with the narrow dogmatic hate and\r\nprejudice of Mr. Cowles on this subject, though no doubt much of\r\nthis is caused by the unfortunate fact that his daughter has become\r\na Catholic, and I am charitable enough to take this into consideration\r\nwhen thinking of him.  Mrs. General Sherman, it is true, is a\r\nCatholic.  She was born so and will remain so.  She is a good\r\nCatholic, however, in good wishes and good works, but has also too\r\nmuch of the dogmatism and intolerance of a sectarian for my ideas.\r\nShe neither claims to have nor has any sort of influence over me.\r\n\r\n\"It is a mean business to get up such a prejudice against me when\r\nmen are so ashamed of it that they are afraid to avow it.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. Geo. H. Foster, Cleveland, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nAnother allegation made was that I was using the patronage of my\r\noffice to aid in my nomination.  In regard to this I wrote as\r\nfollows to a friend:\r\n\r\n\"I think the impression has been made upon the public mind that\r\nthe patronage of this department has been used in my favor.  This\r\nought to be met.  Of the two men who parcel out the patronage of\r\nthis department, one, General Raum, commissioner of internal revenue,\r\nis a known personal friend of General Grant, appointed by him, and\r\nthe great majority of the officers under that bureau are believed\r\nto be for General Grant.  I have not sought to control any of them.\r\nMcCormick, my first assistant secretary, was a known Blaine man.\r\nThe second, Hawley, was a known personal friend of General Grant,\r\nand recently resigned to run for nomination as Governor of Illinois.\r\nMcPherson, a known Blaine man, was chief of the bureau of engraving\r\nand printing, which employs some seven hundred people.  The officers\r\nnamed have practically made all the appointments in the treasury\r\nother than the presidential ones.  Probably no one who ever held\r\nmy position has ever been so utterly indifferent to the distribution\r\nof patronage, except that I always insisted that good Republicans\r\nshould be appointed to every position, small or great.  I never\r\ninquired who they were for for President.  In official letters, a\r\ncopy of one of which I could furnish you if desired, I gave distinct\r\ninstructions that I would not permit anyone to remain in the service\r\nwho was making himself obnoxious to citizens generally, by pressing\r\nmy claims or advocating my nomination for President by the next\r\nnational convention, or by opposing me.\"\r\n\r\nI also soon learned that nearly every applicant whose appointment\r\nI could not give or secure harbored this as a reason why I should\r\nnot be nominated for President, and in three or four cases where\r\nthe applicants were men of influence they opposed the selection of\r\ndelegates friendly to me.  I do not mention any names, for most of\r\nthese gentlemen, years afterwards, became my warm friends.\r\n\r\nI early announced that unless the State of Ohio would give me a\r\nsubstantial indorsement, my name would not be presented to the\r\nconvention.  James S. Robinson was the chairman of the state\r\ncommittee and A. L. Conger was a prominent member.  They disagreed\r\nas to the time of holding the state convention for the appointment\r\nof delegates to the national convention, which my friends were\r\nanxious to have at as early a period as possible, so that the\r\nposition of Ohio might be known to, and possibly influence the\r\naction of, other states.  The disagreement between these two\r\ngentlemen resulted in a postponement of the convention until a\r\nperiod so late that before it met most of the delegations were\r\nselected by the other states.  That was thought to be inimical to\r\nmy success, and led to ill-will and contention.  Governor Dennison\r\nand Governor Foster had frankly and openly avowed their purpose to\r\nsupport my nomination, and actively did so.  They advised me of\r\nthe condition of opinion from time to time, and early represented\r\nthat I might reasonably expect the support of all the districts,\r\nexcept perhaps those represented by Garfield and McKinley, and the\r\nToledo district.\r\n\r\nI went to Mansfield on private business about the latter part of\r\nMarch, and as usual was called upon to make a speech, which I did,\r\nat Miller's Hall, on the 31st of March, and which was reported in\r\nfull at the time.  I stated my position in regard to the nomination,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"By the course of recent events, and not by my own seeking, my name\r\nis mentioned among those from whom the Republican party will select\r\none to carry its banner in the approaching presidential contest.\r\nIt is not egotistic to state this fact, and it would not be manly\r\nto shrink from the criticism and scrutiny which such a choice\r\nnecessarily invites and provokes.\r\n\r\n\"I accepted the position without a pretense of mock modesty, because\r\nI do not think it right to allow friends to put themselves to\r\ntrouble on my account without a frank avowal that I was willing to\r\naccept, and without delaying until certain of success; but with a\r\nfirm determination not to detract from the merits or services of\r\nothers, nor to seek this lofty elevation by dishonorable means or\r\nlying evasions or pretense.  In this way, and in this way only, am\r\nI a candidate; but with great doubt whether, if nominated, I would\r\nmeet the expectation of friends, and resolved in case of failure\r\nthat I will abide, cheerfully and kindly, by the choice of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n\"There is one condition, scarcely necessary to state, upon which\r\nmy candidacy depends, and that is, if the Republicans of Ohio do\r\nnot fairly and fully, in their convention, express a preference\r\nfor me, and support me with substantial unanimity in the national\r\nconvention, my name will not be presented to that convention with\r\nmy consent.\r\n\r\n\"This, fellow-citizens, is about all, and is perhaps more than I\r\nought to say about personal matters, for in the great contest in\r\nwhich we are about to engage, the hopes, ambitions, and even the\r\nlives, of men, are of but little account compared with the issues\r\ninvolved.\"\r\n\r\nI proceeded, then, to discuss the political questions of the day.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of April delegates were selected from the different\r\ncongressional districts of the state to attend the state convention,\r\nto meet on the 28th of that month.  Prior to the convention the\r\nquestion of the nomination was the subject of discussion in every\r\ndistrict.  The sentiment in my favor was clearly expressed in nearly\r\nevery county or district of the state.  On the 8th of April I wrote\r\nthe following letter to a friend:\r\n\r\n\"McKinley is still in Ohio, and I presume will be there for some\r\ndays.  I have to-day written to him at Canton covering the points\r\nyou name.  You had better write to him yourself giving the list of\r\nappointments desired.\r\n\r\n\"There is a strong feeling that Garfield, in order to save his\r\ndistrict, should go to the Chicago convention as a delegate.  He\r\nis placed in a very awkward attitude now.  If this district should\r\nbe against my nomination it would be attributed to either want of\r\ninfluence on his part, or, what is worse, a want of sincerity in\r\nmy support.  In view of the past this would be a very unfortunate\r\nthing for him.  This is a delicate matter for me to take any part\r\nin, and I leave it entirely to your good judgment and kind\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Ohio I had a consultation, at Columbus, with Governor\r\nFoster, ex-Governor Dennison, and a number of other personal friends,\r\nall of whom expressed great confidence that by the time the state\r\nconvention met, the friendly feeling in favor of Blaine, in some\r\nof the districts of Ohio, would be waived in deference to the\r\napparent wishes of the great majority.  In that event, in case my\r\nnomination should prove impracticable, the whole delegation could\r\nbe very easily changed to Mr. Blaine.  As to General Grant, though\r\nhe had many warm personal friends in Ohio, yet, on account of\r\nobjections to a third term, very few desired his nomination.\r\n\r\nPrior to the state convention I had an interview with General\r\nGarfield which he sought at my office in the department, and he\r\nthere expressed his earnest desire to secure my nomination and his\r\nwish to be a delegate at large, so that he might aid me effectively.\r\nHe had been chosen, with little or no opposition, United States\r\nSenator, to fill the place of Thurman, whose term expired March 4,\r\n1881.  I had not a doubt of the support of Governor Foster, with\r\nwhom I had been in close correspondence, and who expressed a strong\r\ndesire for my nomination.  I was permitted practically to name the\r\nfour delegates at large, and had implicit confidence that these\r\ndelegates would take the lead in my behalf.\r\n\r\nThe state convention, which met on the 28th of April, was exceptionally\r\nlarge, and was composed of the leading Republicans of Ohio, who\r\nproceeded at once to the business before them.  The persons named\r\nby the convention as delegates at large to the national convention,\r\nto assemble in Chicago on June 2, were William Dennison, James A.\r\nGarfield, Charles Foster and Warner M. Bateman, who were instructed\r\nfor me.  The following resolution of the convention expressed the\r\npreference of the Republicans of Ohio in favor of my nomination,\r\nand recommended that the vote of the state be cast for me:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the great ability, invaluable services, long\r\nexperience, full and exalted character, and unwavering fidelity to\r\nRepublican principles of our distinguished fellow-citizen, John\r\nSherman, entitle him to the honors and confidence of the Republican\r\nparty of Ohio, and of the country.  His matchless skill and courage\r\nas a financier have mainly contributed to accomplish the invaluable\r\nand difficult work of resumption and refunding the public debt,\r\nand made him the trusted representative, in public life, of the\r\nbusiness interests of all classes of the American people.  He has\r\nbeen trained from the beginning of his public life in advocacy of\r\nthe rights of man, and no man has been more unfaltering in his\r\ndemand that the whole power of the government should be used to\r\nprotect the colored people of the south from unlawful violence and\r\nunfriendly local legislation.  And in view of his services to his\r\ncountry, and his eminent ability as a statesman, we, the Republican\r\nparty of Ohio, present him to the Republican party of the country,\r\nas a fit candidate for president, and respectfully urge upon the\r\nRepublican convention at Chicago, his nomination, and the district\r\ndelegates are respectfully requested to vote for his nomination.\"\r\n\r\nThe trend of public sentiment, as shown by the newspaper, indicated\r\nthat Grant and Blaine would each have a very strong following in\r\nthe national convention, but that the contest between them might\r\nlead to my nomination.  After the state convention, it was generally\r\nassumed that I would receive the united vote of the delegation in\r\nconformity with the expression of opinion by the convention.  During\r\nthis period a few leading men, whose names I do not care to mention,\r\nmade a combination of those unfriendly to me, and agreed to disregard\r\nthe preference declared by the state convention.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May the feeling in my favor increased, and many\r\nof the leading papers in New York and in the eastern states advocated\r\nmy nomination as a compromise candidate.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was in constant communication with General Garfield,\r\nby letters and also by interviews, as we were both in Washington.\r\nOn the 10th of May he wrote me:\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be a mistake for us to assume a division in the\r\nOhio delegation.  We should meet and act as though we were of one\r\nmind, until those delegates who are hostile to you refuse to act\r\nwith us, and if we fail to win them over, the separation will be\r\ntheir act, not ours.\"\r\n\r\nThe national convention met June 2, 1880.  It was called to order\r\nin the Exposition Hall, Chicago, by Senator J. Donald Cameron, and\r\na temporary organization, with Senator George F. Hoar as president,\r\nwas soon perfected.  An effort was made by the friends of General\r\nGrant to adopt the unit rule, which would allow a majority of each\r\nstate to determine the vote of the entire delegation.  This was\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nFour days were occupied in perfecting the permanent organization,\r\nand the nomination of candidates for President.  During this time\r\na minority of nine of the delegation of Ohio announced their\r\ndetermination to vote for Blaine.  This was a fatal move for Blaine,\r\nand undoubtedly led to his defeat.  Nearly four-fifths of the\r\ndelegation were in favor of my nomination, in pursuance of the\r\nexpress wishes of the Ohio convention, but they were all friendly\r\nto Blaine, and whenever it should have become apparent that my\r\nnomination was impracticable, the whole delegation could easily\r\nhave been carried for him without a division, and thus have secured\r\nhis nomination.  The action of those nine delegates, who refused\r\nto carry out the wishes of the state convention, prevented the\r\npossibility of the vote of Ohio being cast for Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nLong before the convention I had declared, in a published interview,\r\nthat \"Blaine is a splendid man, able and eminently fit for President.\r\nIf nominated he will find no one giving him a heartier support than\r\nmyself.\"  We were connected by early ties of association and kinship,\r\nand had been and were then warm friends.  Blaine, when confident\r\nof the nomination, said of me:  \"To no living man does the American\r\npeople owe a deeper debt of gratitude than to John Sherman, for\r\ngiving them resumption with all its blessings.  As Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury he has been the success of the age.  He is as eminently\r\nfit for President as any man in America, and should he be nominated\r\nall I am capable of doing will be done to aid in his election.\r\nShould it be my fortune to become President, or should it fall to\r\nthe lot of any Republican, no one elected could afford to do less\r\nthan invite Secretary Sherman to remain where he is.\"  The folly\r\nof a few men made co-operation impracticable.  I received opposition\r\nin Ohio from his pretended friends, and he therefore lost the Ohio\r\ndelegation, which, but for this defection, would have made his\r\nnomination sure had I failed to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe speech of General Garfield nominating me has always been regarded\r\nas a specimen of brilliant eloquence rarely surpassed, the close\r\nof which I insert:\r\n\r\n\"You ask for his monuments.  I point you to twenty-five years of\r\nnational statutes.  Not one great beneficent law has been placed\r\non our statute books without his intelligent and powerful aid.  He\r\naided to formulate the laws that raised our great armies, and\r\ncarried us through the war.  His hand was seen in the workmanship\r\nof those statutes that restored the unity of the states.  His hand\r\nwas in all that great legislation that created the war currency,\r\nand in a still greater work that redeemed the promise of the\r\ngovernment, and made our currency the equal of gold.  And when at\r\nlast called from the halls of legislation into a high executive\r\noffice, he displayed that experience, intelligence, firmness, and\r\npoise of character which has carried us through a stormy period.\r\nThe great fiscal affairs of the nation, and the great business\r\ninterests of our country, he has preserved, while executing the\r\nlaw of resumption and effecting its object, without a jar, and\r\nagainst the false prophecies of one-half the press and all the\r\nDemocracy of this continent.  He has shown himself able to meet\r\nwith calmness the great emergencies of the government for twenty-\r\nfive years.  He has trodden the perilous heights of public duty,\r\nand against all the shafts of malice has borne his breast unharmed.\r\nHe has stood in the blaze of 'that fierce light that beats upon a\r\nthrone,' but its fiercest ray has found no flaw in his armor, no\r\nstain on his shield.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot 9 of the Ohio delegation voted for Mr. Blaine,\r\n34 for me, and 1 for Edmunds.  The general result was 304 for Grant,\r\n284 for Blaine, 93 for Sherman, 34 for Edmunds, 30 for Washburne,\r\n10 for Windom.  The vote of my friends would have nominated Blaine\r\nat any period of the convention, but under the conditions then\r\nexisting it was impossible to secure this vote to either Blaine or\r\nGrant.\r\n\r\nThe final result was the selection of a new candidate and the\r\nnomination of Garfield.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that if I had received the united vote of the Ohio\r\ndelegation I would have been nominated, as my relations with both\r\nGeneral Grant and Mr. Blaine were of a friendly character, but it\r\nis hardly worth while to comment on what might have been.  The\r\ncourse of the Ohio delegation was the object of severe comment,\r\nand perhaps of unfounded suspicions of perfidy on the part of some\r\nof the delegates.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard of the movement to nominate Garfield I sent the\r\nfollowing telegram to Mr. Dennison:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, June 8, 1880.\r\n\"Hon. William Dennison, Convention, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever the vote of Ohio will be likely to assure the nomination\r\nof Garfield, I appeal to every delegate to vote for him.  Let Ohio\r\nbe solid.  Make the same appeal in my name to North Carolina and\r\nevery delegate who has voted for me.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment the nomination was made I sent the following dispatch\r\nto Garfield at Chicago:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, June 8, 1880.\r\n\"Hon. James A. Garfield, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you with all my heart upon your nomination as\r\nPresident of the United States.  You have saved the Republican\r\nparty and the country from a great peril, and assured the continued\r\nsuccess of Republican principles.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI understood that the health of Governor Dennison, who had faithfully\r\nrepresented me in the national convention, was somewhat impaired\r\nby his confinement there, and invited him to join me in a sail on\r\nthe Chesapeake Bay, spending a few days at different points.  He\r\naccepted and we had a very enjoyable trip for about ten days.\r\n\r\nDuring this trip I wrote, for the 4th of July issue of the New York\r\n\"Independent,\" an article on Virginia and state rights.  I had\r\npromised to do this some time before but could not find an opportunity,\r\nand availed myself of the quiet of the cruise to fulfill my promise.\r\nThe history of Virginia has always had for me a peculiar interest,\r\nmainly because of the leading part taken by that state in the\r\nAmerican Revolution.  The great natural resources of the state had\r\nbeen neglected, the fertility of the soil on the eastern shore had\r\nbeen exhausted, and no efforts had been made to develop the vast\r\nmineral wealth in the mountains along its western border.  The\r\ndestruction of slavery and the breaking up of the large farms and\r\nplantations had discouraged its people, and I thought, by an\r\nimpartial statement of its undeveloped resources, I might excite\r\ntheir attention and that of citizens of other states to the wealth\r\nunder its soil.  This article, written in a friendly spirit, excited\r\nthe attention and approval of many citizens of the state, and\r\nbrought me many letters of thanks.\r\n\r\nIn time I became thoroughly advised of what occurred at the Chicago\r\nconvention and had become entirely reconciled to the result, though\r\nfrequently afterwards I heard incidents and details which occasioned\r\nme great pain and which seemed to establish the want of sincerity\r\non the part of some of the delegates, and tended to show that for\r\nsome time before the meeting of the convention the nomination of\r\nGeneral Garfield had been agreed upon.  After its close I had\r\nnumerous letters from delegates of other states, complaining bitterly\r\nof the conduct of the Ohio delegation and giving this as a reason\r\nwhy they had not voted for me.  I was assured that large portions\r\nof the Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, and other delegations,\r\nhad notified General Foster that they were ready to vote for me\r\nwhenever their vote was required, but no such request came from\r\nhim.  The matter had been made the subject of public discussion in\r\nthe newspapers.  I was content with the result, but was deeply\r\nwounded by what I could not but regard as a breach of faith on the\r\npart of some of the Ohio delegation, and especially of Governor\r\nFoster, who had been fully advised of my feelings in regard to his\r\ncourse.  I received a letter from him, on the 23rd of June, answering\r\nthe allegations that had been publicly made in regard to him, and\r\nexplaining his action.  In reply I wrote him the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., June 30, 1880.\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 23rd came while I was still absent\r\non the Chesapeake Bay.  I regret that I did not see you, for a free\r\nconversation would be far more satisfactory than letter writing.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to be perfectly frank with you, as since I first became\r\nacquainted with you I have felt for you warm friendship, and have\r\nalways had entire confidence in you.  I confess, however, that the\r\ninformation I received in regard to your operations at Chicago had\r\ngreatly weakened this feeling and left a painful impression upon\r\nmy mind that you had not done by me as I would have done by you\r\nunder like circumstances.  Your letter chased away much of this\r\nimpression, and, perhaps, the better way would be for me to write\r\nno more, but to treat your letter as entirely satisfactory and\r\nconclusive.  Still I think it right for me to give you the general\r\nbasis of the impressions I had formed.\r\n\r\n\"My first impulse was to send you at once a mass of letters from\r\ndelegates and others attending the convention, but this would only\r\ncreate a controversy, and, perhaps, betray confidence, which I\r\ncould not do.  The general purport of these letters is that, while\r\nyou spoke freely and kindly of me, yet there was always a kind of\r\nreserve in favor of Blaine and a hesitation in pressing me that\r\nindicated a divided opinion, that partly by the divisions in the\r\nOhio delegation and partly by the halfway support of yourself, and,\r\nperhaps others, the Ohio delegation lost its moral strength and,\r\npractically, defeated me before any ballot was had.\r\n\r\n\"This general impression I could have passed by, but it was distinctly\r\nstated to me, by delegates and friends of delegates present at the\r\nconvention, that they proffered the votes of large portions of\r\ntheir respective delegations to you with the understanding that\r\nthey were to be cast for me whenever you indicated the proper\r\nmoment.  This was specifically said as to Indiana, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut and the Blaine portion of the Pennsylvania delegation.\r\nIt was said that you prevented Massachusetts from voting for me\r\nfrom about the tenth to the fifteenth ballot on Monday, that nine\r\nof the Connecticut delegates held themselves ready to vote for me\r\non your call, but that you put it off, and Harrison is quoted as\r\nsaying that twenty-six votes from Indiana were ready to be cast\r\nfor me on Monday, at any time after a few ballots, but they were\r\nwithheld on account of representations from the Ohio delegation.\r\nMr. Billings, of Vermont, is quoted as saying that the Vermont\r\ndelegation, with two or three exceptions, were ready to vote for\r\nme, but were discontented with the position taken by you, and\r\ndoubted whether you desired their vote for me.\r\n\r\n\"These and many other allegations of similar import, coming one\r\nafter the other, led me to believe that you had changed the position\r\nyou took in the early part of the canvass, and had come to the\r\nconclusion that it was not wise to nominate me, and that other\r\narrangements for your future influenced you in changing your opinion.\r\nThis impression caused me more pain than anything that has transpired\r\nsince the beginning of the contest.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you I have no regrets over the results of the convention.\r\nIndeed, the moment it was over, I felt a sense of relief that I\r\nhad not had for six months.\r\n\r\n\"The nomination of Garfield is entirely satisfactory to me.  The\r\nonly shade that rests on this feeling is the fact that Garfield\r\nwent there by my selection to represent me and comes from the\r\nconvention with the honor that I sought.  I will do him the justice\r\nto say that I have seen no evidence that he has contributed to this\r\nresult except by his good conduct in the presence of the convention.\r\nI had always looked with great favor upon the contingency that if\r\nI was not nominated after a fair and full trial and Blaine was,\r\nyou would be the candidate for the Vice Presidency, and had frequently\r\nsaid to mutual friends that this was my desire.  The contingency\r\nof Garfield's nomination I did not consider, for I supposed that\r\nas he was secure in the Senate for six years, he would not desire\r\nthe presidential nomination, but as it has come to him without his\r\nself-seeking it is honorable and right and I have no cause of\r\ncomplaint.  If I believed that he had used the position I gave him\r\nto supplant me, I would consider it dishonorable and would not\r\nsupport him; but, while such statements have been made to me, I\r\nfeel bound to say that I have never seen nor heard from credible\r\nsources any ground for such an imputation, and, therefore, he shall\r\nhave my earnest and hearty support.\r\n\r\n\"There are one or two features of this canvass that leave a painful\r\nimpression upon me.  The first is that the opposition to me in Ohio\r\nwas unreasonable, without cause, either springing from corrupt or\r\nbad motives, or from such trivial causes as would scarcely justify\r\nthe pouting of a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\"I receive your frank statement with confidence and act upon it,\r\nwill treat you, as of old, with hearty good will and respect, and\r\nwill give no further credence to the stories I hear.  You can have\r\nno knowledge of the extent of the accusations that have been made\r\nagainst you.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. Charles Foster, Columbus, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nWith this letter I sought to divest myself of all feeling or\r\nprejudice growing out of the recent canvass.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year and the preparation of the usual\r\nstatements made at that time, there was a period of rest, of which\r\nI availed myself by taking an excursion along our northeastern\r\ncoast.  The quiet of the voyage, the salt air, and the agreeable\r\ncompanions, were a great relief from the confinement and anxiety\r\nof the previous months.  Upon my return to New York from this\r\nouting, on the 19th of July, I found two letters from General\r\nGarfield, both relating to the progress of the canvass, and asking\r\nmy opinion of his letter of acceptance.  In reply I wrote him:\r\n\r\n  \"New York, July 19, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 16th was received by me this\r\nmorning.  When I left Washington, about the 1st of July, I felt\r\nvery much debilitated by the heat and by the long mental struggle\r\nthrough which I had passed.  I have had the benefit now of three\r\nweeks quiet and rest, mostly on the ocean, avoiding, whenever\r\npossible, all political talk, and feel, in consequence, greatly\r\nrefreshed and invigorated.  I take the outward voyage _via_ Fortress\r\nMonroe to Washington, arriving there on Thursday.\r\n\r\n\"I received the telegraphic invitation to speak at Chicago but\r\ncould not accept, as I must give some relief to French and Upton\r\nupon my return.\r\n\r\n\"I have received letters and telegrams from Nash about his proposed\r\ncanvass, and highly approve it.  I do not see, however, how it is\r\npossible for me to prepare a speech during the present month.  I\r\nnow propose to write a political letter in response to one from\r\nChicago, which I believe will have a wider circulation than a\r\ncampaign speech.  During the latter part of August or the first of\r\nSeptember, which is as early as the active campaign ought really\r\nto commence, I will be prepared to make several speeches in Ohio,\r\nand, perhaps, in other states.  This is my present plan.  I regard\r\nIndiana and New York as the pivotal states, and there the struggle\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n\"Your letter of acceptance I approve heartily, although I thought\r\nyou yielded a little too much in one or two sentences on the civil\r\nservice question.  Although politicians have undertaken to ridicule\r\nand belittle the efforts of President Hayes to bring about some\r\nsort of civil service reform, yet the necessity of such a reform\r\nis so ingrafted in the minds of the leading sensible people of the\r\nnorthern states that anything like an abandonment of that idea will\r\nnot meet favor.  I agree with you that it can only be done by the\r\nco-operation of Congress, and it would be a great stroke of public\r\npolicy if Congress could be prevailed upon to pass a law prescribing\r\na reasonable tenure for civil office, with such guards against\r\narbitrary removals as would make the incumbents somewhat independent\r\nin their opinions and actions.  I had a conversation with Fletcher\r\nHarper, at Long Beach, on Saturday, which leads me to think that\r\nhe is anxious upon this subject and also upon the financial\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"The silver law threatens to produce within a year or so a single\r\nsilver standard, and already there is a feeling of uneasiness in\r\nNew York as to whether we can maintain resumption upon the gold\r\nstandard while the silver law remains.  I could at any moment, by\r\nissuing silver freely, bring a crisis upon this question, but while\r\nI hold my present office I certainly will not do so, until the gold\r\nreserve is practically converted into silver, a process that is\r\ngoing on now at the rate of nearly two millions a month.  I have\r\nno fear, however, of being forced to this issue during my term,\r\nand I hope Congress will come together next winter in such temper\r\nthat it may arrest the coinage of the silver dollar, if it will\r\nnot change the ratio.  This question, however, is a very delicate\r\none to discuss in popular assemblages, and I propose, therefore,\r\nin my speeches, to make only the faintest allusions to it, not\r\nsurrendering, however, our views upon the subject, for upon this,\r\nI take it, we are entirely agreed.\r\n\r\n\"I feel very hopeful of success.  In this state business men are\r\ngenerally satisfied, and your support is so strong that, even if\r\ninclined, the Conkling Republicans will not dare oppose or shirk\r\nthe contest.  I hear different stories about Conkling, but believe\r\nthat in due time he will do what he can, though his influence is\r\ngreatly overrated.  A too active support by him would excite the\r\nprejudices of hosts of people here who are determined not to follow\r\nwhere he leads.\r\n\r\n  \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. James A. Garfield, Mentor, O.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the 19th of July I was at my desk, busily engaged in the\r\nroutine duties of my office, until, in accordance with the following\r\nrequest of General Garfield, I visited New York to attend a conference\r\nof Republicans, as to the conduct of the pending canvass:\r\n\r\n  \"Mentor, O., July 31, 1880.\r\n\"Dear Mr. Sherman:--I understand that the national Republican\r\ncommittee have asked you to meet with them for consultation, in\r\nNew York, on the 5th prox.\r\n\r\n\"At their unanimous and urgent request, I have reluctantly consented\r\nto attend, but I shall esteem it a great favor if you will also go.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\nMore than two hundred prominent Republicans from all parts of the\r\ncountry met on the 5th of August, among whom were Senators Blaine\r\nand Logan, Marshall Jewell, Thurlow Weed, and Edwards Pierrepont.\r\nI was called upon to make an address.  The only passage I wish to\r\nquote is this:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican party comes before the business men of this country\r\n--with all its evidences of reviving prosperity everywhere--and\r\nasks whether they will resign all these great affairs to the solid\r\nsouth, headed by Wade Hampton and the Ku-Klux Klan, and a little\r\nsegment of these northern states, calling themselves the Democratic\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a month afterwards, Governor Hampton wrote me a letter\r\ncomplaining of my connecting him with the \"Ku-Klux Klan,\" and the\r\nfollowing correspondence ensued:\r\n\r\n  \"Doggers' Springs, September 17, 1880.\r\n\"To Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--Some days ago I saw a report of your speech at a conference\r\nheld by the national Republican committee, at the Fifth Avenue\r\nHotel, New York, and you were quoted as having used the following\r\nlanguage:  'And now you are asked to surrender all you have done\r\ninto the hands of Wade Hampton and the Ku-Klux, and the little\r\nsegment in the north that is called the Democratic party.'  May I\r\nask if you used these words, and, if you did so, did you mean to\r\nconnect me, directly or indirectly, with what was known as the Ku-\r\nKlux Klan?\r\n\r\n\"Requesting an early reply, addressed to me, care of Augustus\r\nSchell, Esq., New York, I am, very respectfully, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n  \"Wade Hampton.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., September 21, 1880.\r\n\"Hon. Wade Hampton, care of Augustus Schell, Esq., New York.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--Your note of the 17th inst. is received, in which you inquire\r\nwhether, at the conference held by the national Republican committee,\r\nat the Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York, I used the language attributed\r\nto me as follows:  'And now you are asked to surrender all you have\r\ndone into the hands of Wade Hampton and the Ku-Klux, and the little\r\nsegment in the north that is called the Democratic party.'  In\r\nreply, I have to advise you, that while I do not remember the\r\nprecise language, I presume the reporter correctly stated, in a\r\ncondensed way, his idea of what I said.  I no doubt spoke of you\r\nas the leading representative of the Democratic party in the south,\r\nand referred to the Ku-Klux Klan as the representative of the\r\nbarbarous agencies by which the Democrats have subverted the civil\r\nand political rights of the Republicans of the south.\r\n\r\n\"I did not connect you personally with the Ku-Klux Klan.  Indeed,\r\nI knew that you had, in one or two important instances, resisted\r\nand defeated its worst impulses.  I appreciate the sense of honor\r\nwhich makes you shrink from being named in connection with it.\r\nStill, you and your associates, leading men in the south, now enjoy\r\nbenefits of political power derived from the atrocities of the Ku-\r\nKlux Klan, in which phrase I include all the numerous _aliases_ by\r\nwhich it has, from time to time, been known in the south.  Your\r\npower in the southern states rests upon the actual crimes of every\r\ngrade in the code of crimes--from murder to the meanest form of\r\nballot-box stuffing committed by the Ku-Klux Klan and its kindred\r\nassociates, and, as you know, some of the worst of them were\r\ncommitted since 1877, when you and your associates gave the most\r\nsolemn assurance of protection to the freedmen of the south.\r\n\r\n\"These crimes are all aimed at the civil political rights of\r\nRepublicans in the south, and, as I believe, but for these agencies,\r\nthe very state that you represent, as well as many other states in\r\nthe south, would be represented, both in the Senate and House, by\r\nRepublicans.  But for these crimes the boast attributed to you,\r\nthat one hundred and thirty-eight solid southern votes would be\r\ncast for the Democratic ticket, would be but idle vaporing; but\r\nnow we feel that it is a sober truth.\r\n\r\n\"While I have no reason to believe that you or your northern\r\nassociates personally participated in the offenses I have named,\r\nyet, while you and they enjoy the fruits of these crimes, you may,\r\nin logic and morals be classed as I classed you, as joint copartners\r\nwith the Ku-Klux Klan in the policy which thus far has been successful\r\nin seizing political power in the south, and which it is hoped, by\r\nthe aid of the small segment of the Democratic party in the north,\r\nmay be extended to all the departments of the government.  It is\r\nin this sense that I spoke of you, the Ku-Klux Klan and the northern\r\nDemocratic party.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, in conclusion, while frankly answering your question,\r\nto say the most fatal policy for the south would be by such agencies\r\nas I have mentioned to secure again political ascendency in this\r\ncountry, for I assure you that the manhood and independence of the\r\nnorth will certainly continue the struggle until every Republican\r\nin the south shall have free and unrestricted enjoyment of equal\r\ncivil and political privileges, including a fair vote, a fair count,\r\nfree speech and free press, and agitation made necessary to secure\r\nsuch results may greatly affect injuriously the interests of the\r\npeople of the south.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Charlottesville, Va., October 1, 1880.\r\n\"To Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--Your letter has been received.  As you do not disclaim the\r\nlanguage to which I called your attention, I have only to say that\r\nin using it you uttered what was absolutely false, and what you\r\nknew to be false.  My address will be Columbia, S. C.\r\n\r\n  \"I am your obedient servant,\r\n  \"Wade Hampton.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department,                }\r\n  \"Washington, D.

McKinley, a few moments ago, after my\r\nreturn from the west.  I had this morning read what purported to\r\nbe an extract of a speech made by you, published in the Charleston\r\n'News and Courier,' and upon your general reputation as a gentleman\r\nhad denied that you had made such a speech or written such a letter\r\nas is attributed to you in that paper.  What I stated to you in my\r\nletter of September 21, I believe to be true, notwithstanding your\r\ndenial, and it can be shown to be true by public records and as a\r\nmatter of history.  As you had, long before your letter was delivered\r\nto me, seen proper to make a public statement of your views of the\r\ncorrespondence, I will give it to the press without note or comment,\r\nand let the public decide between us.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThis correspondence excited a good deal of attention, and broke\r\noff all social relations between us.  We afterwards served for many\r\nyears in the Senate together, but had no intercourse with each\r\nother except formal recognition while I was president of the Senate.\r\nI always regretted this, for I did not feel the slightest enmity\r\nto General Hampton, and recognized the fact that while enjoying\r\nthe office he held as the result of the crimes of the Klan, yet he\r\nand his colleague, M. C. Butler, were among the most conservative\r\nand agreeable gentlemen in the Senate, and the offenses with which\r\nI connected his name were committed by his constituents and not by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nMY LAST YEAR IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.\r\nOpening of the 1880 Campaign in Cincinnati--My First Speech Arraigned\r\nas \"Bitterly Partisan\"--Letter from Garfield Regarding the Maine\r\nElection--Ohio Thought to Be in Doubt--Many Requests for Speeches\r\n--Republican Ticket Elected in Ohio and Indiana--A Strange Warning\r\nfrom Detroit Threatening Garfield with Assassination--The Latter's\r\nReply--My Doubts About Remaining in the Treasury Department or\r\nMaking an Effort for the Senate--Letter to Dalzell--Last Annual\r\nReport to Congress in December, 1880--Recommendations Regarding\r\nSurplus Revenue, Compulsory Coinage of the Silver Dollar, the\r\nTariff, etc.--Bills Acted Upon by Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring July and August I received many invitations to speak on\r\npolitical topics, but declined all until about the 1st of September.\r\nIn anticipation of the election of Garfield, and his resignation\r\nas Senator, I was, as early as July, tendered the support of several\r\nmembers of the legislature who had voted for him for Senator, and\r\nwho wished to vote for me in case he resigned.  I replied that I\r\nwould prefer the position of Senator to any other, that I resigned\r\nmy seat in the Senate to accept the office of Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and would be gratified by a return to my old position,\r\nbut only in case it came to me as the hearty choice of the general\r\nassembly.  During the month of August the two assistant secretaries,\r\nwho had been for a year confined to the department and upon whom\r\nthe duties of secretary had devolved during my recent absence, went\r\non their usual vacation, so that I was fully occupied during office\r\nhours with the routine business of the department.\r\n\r\nMy first speech of the campaign was made on Monday, the 30th of\r\nAugust, in Cincinnati.  It was carefully prepared, and delivered\r\nin substance as printed.  My habit has been for many years, at the\r\nbeginning of a political canvass, to write or dictate a speech and\r\nhand it to the press associations, to be printed in the newspapers\r\nonly after the speech is made.  This is done for the convenience\r\nof the press and to secure an accurate report.  The speech at\r\nCincinnati, thus prepared, was not read by me, but I spoke from\r\nbriefs which enabled me to substantially follow it.  Subsequent\r\nspeeches had to vary according to the nature and mood of the\r\naudience, or the political subject exciting local interest and\r\nattention.  At Cincinnati I gave a comparison of the principles,\r\ntendency, and achievements of the two great parties, and the reasons\r\nwhy the Democratic party wanted a change in the executive branch\r\nof the government.  I contrasted the aims and policy of that party,\r\nat each presidential election from 1860 to 1880, with those of the\r\nRepublican party, and expressed my opinion of the effects that\r\nwould have followed their success at each of those elections.  I\r\nstated in detail the results secured during the last four years by\r\nthe election of a Republican President.  These included the resumption\r\nof specie payments, the refunding and the steady reduction of the\r\npublic debt, the faithful collection of the revenue, economy of\r\npublic expenditures, and business prosperity for which I gave the\r\ncauses, all of which were opposed or denied by the Democratic party.\r\nI entered into detail on the measures proposed by the then Democratic\r\nCongress, the motive of them, and the ruinous effects they would\r\nproduce, and alleged that the changes proposed were dictated by\r\nthe same policy that was adopted by Buchanan and the active leaders\r\nof the War of the Rebellion and by the corrupt power that controlled\r\nthe city of New York.  I replied to the charges of fraud made as\r\nto the election of President Hayes, that the alleged fraud consisted\r\nin the judgment of the electoral commission created by the Democrats\r\nthat Hayes was duly elected.  I narrated the gross crimes of the\r\nKu-Klux Klan and kindred associations to control the elections in\r\nthe south, and the attempted bribery of an elector in Oregon.\r\n\r\nThis speech was arraigned as bitterly partisan, but it was justified\r\nby facts proven by the strongest evidence.  I have recently carefully\r\nread it, and, while I confess that its tone was bitter and partisan,\r\nyet the allegations were clearly justified.  At this time such\r\nfraud and violence could not be practiced in the south, for the\r\ntendency of events has quieted public sentiment.  The lapse of time\r\nhas had a healing effect upon both sections, and it is to be hoped\r\nthat hereafter parties will not be divided on sectional lines.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati speech had one merit, in that it furnished speakers\r\nand the public the exact statistics of our financial condition in\r\nadvance of my annual report to Congress in December.  I made speeches\r\neach week day in Ohio and Indiana until the 11th of September, when\r\nI returned to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe election in Maine, which occurred early in September, was\r\nunfavorable to the Republican party, and caused General Garfield\r\nsome uneasiness.  He wrote me the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Mentor, Ohio, September 17, 1880.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 15th inst. is received.  I hear in many\r\nways the same account which you give of the cause of our falling\r\noff in Maine.  The latest news indicates that we have carried the\r\nelection after all, but our people claimed too much, and the moral\r\neffect of it may be bad in some of the doubtful states.  Still, so\r\nfar as I can see, every Republican is more aroused and determined\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\"I think we should now throw all our force into Indiana and Ohio\r\nuntil the October election.  Indiana is now more thoroughly organized\r\nby our people than it has been for many years, and I believe that\r\nnothing can defeat us, except importations and purchases by the\r\nDemocracy.  I have not known the Republicans of that state so\r\nconfident in six years as they now are, and every available help\r\nshould be given them to win the fight.  I have learned certainly\r\nthat the Democrats intend to make a powerful raid upon Ohio, for\r\nthe double purpose of beating us if they can, and specially in\r\nhopes that they may draw off our forces in Indiana.\r\n\r\n\"I know you can accomplish a great deal, even while you are in\r\nWashington, but I hope you will give as much time as possible to\r\nthe canvass here and in Indiana--especially give us the last ten\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\"\r\n\r\nI replied on the 22nd of September that the assured election of\r\nPlaisted, the fusion electoral ticket in Maine, and many things in\r\nmy correspondence, made me feel exceedingly anxious about the result\r\nof the election, that my advices from Ohio were not satisfactory,\r\nand I felt that we must exert ourselves to the utmost to insure\r\nvictory at our October election.  \"I think from my standpoint here,\"\r\nI said, \"I can get more certain indications of public opinion than\r\nanyone can while canvassing.  I therefore have determined to go to\r\nOhio the latter part of this week, and to devote the balance of\r\nthe time, until the election, to the campaign.\"  I also advised\r\nhim that I had arranged to have several other speakers go to Ohio.\r\n\r\nTo this he replied:\r\n\r\n  \"Mentor, Ohio, September 25, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 22nd inst. is received.  I am glad that\r\nyou are coming back to take part in the canvass.  Within the last\r\nten days it has become evident that money is being used in large\r\namounts in various parts of this state.  Reports of this come to\r\nme in so many independent ways that I cannot doubt it.  I was in\r\nToledo on the 22nd to attend the reunion of the 'Army of the\r\nCumberland,' and my friends there were thoroughly alarmed.  They\r\nsaid the Democrats had an abundance of money, and that those in\r\nToledo were contributing more than they had done for many years.\r\n\r\n\"I think our friends should push the business aspect of the campaign\r\nwith greater vigor than they are doing, especially the tariff\r\nquestion which so deeply affects the interests of manufacturers\r\nand laborers.  The argument of the 'solid south' is well enough in\r\nits way, and ought not to be overlooked, but we should also press\r\nthose questions which lie close to the homes and interests of our\r\nown people.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this period I received an invitation to speak in New York,\r\nbut doubted the policy of accepting, and answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., September 20, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your note of the 17th, inviting me to address the\r\ncitizens of New York, under the auspices of your club, during the\r\ncampaign, is received.  Please accept my thanks for the courteous\r\nmanner in which your invitation is expressed.\r\n\r\n\"I will be compelled to remain here until the 4th of October and\r\nthen go to Ohio and Indiana to engage in the canvass, which will\r\ncarry me to the 15th or 16th of October.  I have been urged also\r\nto go to Chicago and Milwaukee, and have made promises in several\r\ncities in the eastern states, especially in Brooklyn; so that I do\r\nnot see how it is possible for me to accept your kind invitation.\r\nI have also some doubt whether it would be politic to do so.  It\r\nseems to be the determination of a certain class of Republicans in\r\nNew York to ignore or treat with dislike President Hayes and his\r\nadministration, and to keep alive the division of opinion as to\r\nthe removal of Arthur.  From my view of the canvass the strength\r\nof our position now is in the honesty and success of the administration.\r\nWhile I have no desire to contrast it with General Grant's, yet\r\nthe contrast would be greatly in favor of President Hayes.  The\r\ntrue policy is to rise above these narrow family divisions, and,\r\nwithout disparagement of any Republican, unite in the most active\r\nand zealous efforts against the common enemy.  Senator Conkling\r\ndoes not seem to have the capacity to do this, and the body of his\r\nfollowing seems to sympathize with him.  I doubt, therefore, whether\r\nmy appearance in New York would not tend to make divisions rather\r\nthan to heal them, to do harm rather than good.  I am so earnestly\r\ndesirous to succeed in the election that I would even forgo a self-\r\ndefense to advance the cause.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. B. F. Manierre, Ch. Rep. Central Campaign Club, New York.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first of October I left Washington for Mansfield and spoke\r\nat a mass meeting there on Saturday evening, the 2nd.  The canvass\r\non both sides was very active and meetings were being held in all\r\nparts of the state.  The meeting at Mansfield held in the open\r\nsquare both in the afternoon and evening, was very large.  I spoke\r\neach day except Sunday during the following week, at different\r\nplaces in Ohio and Indiana.  Confidence in Republican success grew\r\nstronger as the October election approached.  After the vote was\r\ncast it was found that the Republican state ticket was elected by\r\na large majority in both these states.  In pursuance of previous\r\nengagements, I spoke at Chicago, Racine, and Milwaukee, after the\r\nOctober election.  The speeches at Chicago and Milwaukee were\r\nreported in full and were circulated as campaign documents.  During\r\nthe latter part of the month of October I spoke at the city of\r\nWashington and in Bridgeport, Norwalk and New Haven, Connecticut,\r\nand at Cooper Institute in the city of New York, and then returned\r\nhome to vote at the November election.\r\n\r\nThe result was the election of a large majority of Republican\r\nelectors and the certainty of their voting for Garfield and Arthur\r\nas President and Vice President of the United States.  I had done\r\nall that it was possible for me to do to bring about that result\r\nand rejoiced as heartily as anyone, for I thoroughly believed in\r\nthe necessity of maintaining Republican ascendency in the United\r\nStates, at least until a time when the success of the opposite\r\nparty would not endanger any of the national results of the war or\r\nthe financial policy of President Hayes' administration.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the election General Garfield wrote me the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  \"Mentor, Ohio, November 4, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 1st inst. came duly to hand, and was\r\nread with much interest.  The success of the election is very\r\ngratifying.  The distrust of the solid south, and of adverse\r\nfinancial legislation, have been the chief factors in the contest.\r\nI think also that the country wanted to rebuke the attempt of the\r\nDemocrats to narrow the issue to the low level of personal abuse.\r\nI am sure that all our friends agree with me that you have done\r\nvery important and efficient work in the campaign.\r\n\r\n\"I may go to Washington before long to look after my personal\r\naffairs.  If I do not, I hope to have some other opportunity of\r\nseeing you.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\nI received a letter from a Mr. Hudson, of Detroit, which expressed\r\na fear that General Garfield was in serious danger of assassination,\r\ngiving particulars.  I sent it at once to Garfield, and received\r\nfrom him the following answer, very significant in view of the\r\ntragedy that occurred the following summer:\r\n\r\n  \"Mentor, O., November 16, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--The letter of Mr. Hudson, of Detroit, with your\r\nindorsement, came duly to hand.  I do not think there is any serious\r\ndanger in the direction to which he refers, though I am receiving\r\nwhat I suppose to be the usual number of threatening letters on\r\nthat subject.  Assassination can no more be guarded against than\r\ndeath by lightning; and it is not best to worry about either.  I\r\nexpect to go to Washington before long to close up some household\r\naffairs, and I shall hope to see you.\r\n\r\n  \"With kind regard, I am, very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the election of General Garfield, and until the\r\n18th of December, there was a continuous discussion as to who should\r\nbe the successor to Senator Thurman.  This was the senatorship to\r\nwhich Garfield had been elected and now declined to fill.  I received\r\nmany letters from members of the legislature expressing their wish\r\nthat I should be restored to the Senate, and offering to vote for\r\nme.  They generally assumed that I would have the choice between\r\nremaining in the treasury department under President Garfield and\r\nbecoming a candidate for the Senate.  Among the letters received\r\nby me was one from Mr. Thorpe, a member from Ashtabula county,\r\nOhio, and a personal friend.  I thought it right to tell him frankly\r\nthe dilemma in which I was placed by the discussion in the papers.\r\nThis letter expressed my feelings in regard to the matter and I\r\ntherefore insert it:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., November 15, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 11th relieves me from some\r\nembarrassment.  I am very thankful to you for the tender of your\r\nservices and continued hearty friendship.  I will avail myself of\r\nit to tell you confidentially the difficulty under which I labor.\r\n\r\n\"The letter to Dalzell was not intended for publication, but was\r\nsimply a hurried reply to one of two or three long letters received\r\nfrom him.  Still the letter stated in substance my feeling, and he\r\nprobably intended no wrong but rather thought he would benefit me.\r\nBoth before and since, I have been overwhelmed with letters\r\nremonstrating against my leaving my present position, as if I had\r\nany choice.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of course, General Garfield must decide this without\r\nhaste and free from all embarrassment, but in the meantime I am at\r\na loss what to do.  I cannot properly say to my correspondents that\r\nI would stay in the treasury if invited to do so, nor can I ask\r\ngentlemen to commit themselves until they know definitely what I\r\nwish.  I cannot afford to be a candidate unless I expect to succeed.\r\nI believe, from information already received, that I can succeed,\r\nbut only after a struggle that is distasteful to me, and which I\r\ncannot well afford.  I can only act upon the assumption that General\r\nGarfield will desire to make an entire change in his cabinet, and\r\nupon that basis I would gladly return to the Senate as the only\r\nposition I could hold, or, if there was any doubt about election,\r\nI would cheerfully and without discontent retire from public life.\r\nI have now at least a dozen unanswered letters on my table from\r\nmembers of the legislature, tendering their services, and stating\r\nthat I ought to explicitly inform them my wishes, most of them\r\nassuming that I have a choice.  I intend to answer them generally\r\nthat, if elected, I would consider it the highest honor and I would\r\nthen accept and serve.  So I say to you:  If I enter the canvass\r\nI must depend upon my friends without being able to aid them\r\nactively, and with every advantage in the possession of Foster.\r\nSuch a contest, I see, will open up trouble enough in the politics\r\nof Ohio, whatever may be the result.  With this explicit statement\r\nyou will understand best how to proceed.  I would regard the support\r\nof Senator Perkins as of the utmost importance.  After awhile I\r\ncan give you the names of a score at least of others who avow their\r\npreference for me.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\r\n\"Hon. F. Thorpe, Geneva, O.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter to Dalzell referred to was hastily and carelessly written,\r\nwithout any expectation of its publication.  It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"To Hon. J. M. Dalzell, Caldwell, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your kind note of the 4th is received, for which\r\nplease accept my thanks.  I prefer to do precisely what you recommend,\r\nawait the judgment of the general assembly of Ohio, unbiased by\r\nany expression of my wish in the matter referred to.  I do not know\r\nwhat is the desire of General Garfield, but I can see that my\r\nelection might relieve him from embarrassment and free to do as he\r\nthinks best in the formation of his cabinet.  Again thanking you\r\nfor your kind offer, I am very truly yours,\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers, while taking sides between Foster and myself, exaggerated\r\nthe danger and importance of the contest and thus unduly excited\r\nthe public mind, for either of us would have cheerfully acquiesced\r\nin the decision of the general assembly.  Strong appeals were made\r\nto Foster to withdraw, especially after it was known that I would\r\nnot be Secretary of the Treasury in the incoming administration.\r\nNo such appeals came to me, nor did I take any part in the controversy,\r\nbut maintained throughout the position taken in my letter to Mr.\r\nThorpe.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1880, I was engaged in the preparation of my annual\r\nreport sent to Congress December 6.  The ordinary receipts for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1880, were $333,526,610.98.  The total\r\nordinary expenditures were $267,642,957.78, leaving a surplus\r\nrevenue of $65,883,653.20, which, with an amount drawn from cash\r\nbalance in treasury, of $8,084,434.21, made a surplus of $73,968,087.41,\r\nwhich sum was applied to the reduction of the public debt.  The\r\nsinking fund for this year was $37,931,643.55, which, deducted from\r\nthe amount applied to the redemption of bonds, left an excess of\r\n$35,972,973.86 over the amount actually required for the year.\r\nCompared with the previous fiscal year, the receipts for 1880\r\nincreased $62,629,438.23.  The increase of expenditures over the\r\nprevious year was $25,190,360.48.  I estimated that the receipts\r\nover expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, would\r\nbe $50,198,115.52.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1874 to 1879 the United States had failed\r\nto pay on the public debt $87,317,569.21, that being the deficiency\r\nof the sum fixed by law to be paid during those years for sinking\r\nfund.  Deducting from this sum the amount paid in excess for the\r\nfiscal year 1880, there was a balance still due on account of the\r\nsinking fund of about $50,000,000.  This would be met by the\r\nestimated surplus of receipts over expenditures during the fiscal\r\nyear, 1881, thus making good the whole amount of the sinking fund\r\nas required by law.\r\n\r\nThe estimated revenue over expenditures for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1862, including the sinking fund, was $48,000,000.\r\n\r\nUpon this favorable statement I recommended to Congress that instead\r\nof applying this surplus revenue, accruing after the current fiscal\r\nyear, to the extinction of the debt, taxes be repealed or modified\r\nto the extent of such surplus.  A large portion of the surplus of\r\nrevenue over expenditures was caused by the reduction of the rate\r\nof interest and the payment on the principal of the public debt.\r\nThe reduction of annual interest caused by the refunding since\r\nMarch 1, 1877, was $14,290,453.50, and the saving of annual interest\r\nresulting from the payment of the principal of the public debt\r\nsince that date was $6,144,737.50.  The interest was likely to be\r\nstill further reduced during the following year, to an amount\r\nestimated at $12,000,000, by the funding of the bonds.  To the\r\nextent of this annual saving, amounting to $32,000,000, the public\r\nexpenditures would be permanently diminished.\r\n\r\nIn view of this statement, I recommended that all taxes imposed by\r\nthe internal revenue laws, other than those on bank circulation\r\nand on spirits, tobacco and beer, be repealed.  I urged that the\r\ntax on state banks should be maintained, not for purposes of revenue,\r\nbut as a check upon the renewal of a system of local state paper\r\nmoney, which, as it would be issued under varying state laws, would\r\nnecessarily differ as to conditions, terms and security, and could\r\nnot, from its diversity, be guarded against counterfeiting, and\r\nwould, at best, have but a limited circulation.\r\n\r\nThe public debt which became redeemable on and after the 1st of\r\nJuly, 1881, amounted to $687,350,000.  I recommended that to redeem\r\nthese bonds there should be issued treasury notes running from one\r\nto ten years, which could be paid off by the application of the\r\nsinking fund as they matured.  Such treasury notes would have formed\r\na popular security always available to the holder as they could\r\nhave been readily converted into money when needed for other\r\ninvestment or business.  They would have been in such form and\r\ndenominations as to furnish a convenient investment for the small\r\nsavings of the people, and fill the place designed by the ten dollar\r\nrefunding certificates authorized by the act of February 26, 1879.\r\nI stated my belief that with the then state of the money market a\r\nsufficient amount of treasury notes, bearing an annual interest of\r\nthree per cent., could be sold to meet a considerable portion of\r\nthe maturing bonds.\r\n\r\nCongress did not pass such a law as I recommended, but the plan\r\nadopted and executed by my successor, Mr. Windom, was the best that\r\ncould have been devised under existing law, resulting in a very\r\nlarge reduction of the amount paid for interest yearly.  He allowed\r\nthe holders of the maturing bonds to retain them at the pleasure\r\nof the government, with interest at the rate of three and a half\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nI recited the action of the department under the resumption act,\r\nbut this has already been fully described by me.  In respect to\r\nthe United States notes I said:\r\n\r\n\"United States notes are now, in form, security, and convenience,\r\nthe best circulating medium known.  The objection is made that they\r\nare issued by the government, and that it is not the business of\r\nthe government to furnish paper money, but only to coin money.\r\nThe answer is, that the government had to borrow money, and is\r\nstill in debt.  The United States note, to the extent that it is\r\nwillingly taken by the people, and can, beyond question, be maintained\r\nat par in coin, is the least burdensome form of debt.  The loss of\r\ninterest in maintaining the resumption fund, and the cost of printing\r\nand engraving the present amount of United States notes, is less\r\nthan one-half the interest on an equal sum of four per cent. bonds.\r\nThe public thus saves over seven million dollars of annual interest,\r\nand secures a safe and convenient medium of exchange, and has the\r\nassurance that a sufficient reserve in coin will be retained in\r\nthe treasury beyond the temptation of diminution, such as always\r\nattends reserves held by banks.\"\r\n\r\nI expressed the opinion that the existing system of currency, the\r\nsubstantial features of which were a limited amount of United States\r\nnotes (with or without the legal tender quality), promptly redeemable\r\nin coin, with ample reserves in coin and power if necessary to\r\npurchase coin with bonds, supplemented by the circulating notes of\r\nnational banks issued upon conditions that would guarantee their\r\nabsolute security and prompt redemption, all based on coin of equal\r\nvalue, and generally distributed throughout the country, was the\r\nbest system ever devised, and more free from objection than any\r\nother, combining the only safe standard with convenience for\r\ncirculation and security and equality of value.\r\n\r\nAfter a statement of the amount of standard silver dollars issued\r\nunder existing law, I described the measures adopted to facilitate\r\nthe general distribution and circulation of those coins, and the\r\ngreat expense incurred by the United States in transporting them.\r\nWith all these efforts it was found difficult to maintain in\r\ncirculation more than thirty-five per cent. of the amount then\r\ncoined.  While, at special seasons of the year and for special\r\npurposes, this coin was in demand, mainly in the south, it returned\r\nto the treasury, and its reissue involved an expense for transportation\r\nat an average rate of one-third of one per cent. each time.  Unlike\r\ngold coin or United States notes, it did not, to the same extent,\r\nform a part of the permanent circulation, everywhere acceptable,\r\nand, when flowing into the treasury, easily paid out with little\r\nor no cost of transportation.  At a later period, when the amount\r\nof silver dollars had largely increased, the department was never\r\nable to maintain in circulation more then $60,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated I earnestly recommended that the further\r\ncompulsory coinage of the silver dollar be suspended, or, as an\r\nalternative, that the number of grains of silver in the dollar be\r\nincreased so as to make it equal in market value to the gold dollar,\r\nand that its coinage be left as other coinage to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, or the Director of the Mint, to depend upon the demand\r\nfor it by the public for convenient circulation.  After a statement\r\nof the great cost of the coinage of these dollars, I recommended\r\nthat Congress confine its action to the suspension of the coinage\r\nof the silver dollar, and await negotiations with foreign powers\r\nfor the adoption of an international ratio.  I expressed the\r\nconviction that it was for the interest of the United States, as\r\nthe chief producer of silver, to recognize the great change that\r\nhad occurred in the relative market value of silver and gold in\r\nthe chief marts of the world, to adopt a ratio for coinage based\r\nupon market value, and to conform all existing coinage to that\r\nratio, while maintaining the gold eagle of our coinage at its\r\npresent weight and fineness.\r\n\r\nI called attention, also, to the tariff as it then existed.  It\r\nwas a compilation of laws passed during many succeeding years, and\r\nto meet the necessities of the government from time to time.  These\r\nlaws furnished the greater part of our revenue, and incidentally\r\nprotected and diversified home manufactures.  The general principle\r\nupon which they were founded was believed to be salutary.  No marked\r\nor sudden change, which would tend to destroy or injure domestic\r\nindustries built up upon faith in the stability of existing laws,\r\nshould be made in them.  I recommended that _ad valorem_ duties\r\nshould be converted into specific duties as far as practicable,\r\nand that articles which did not compete with domestic industries,\r\nand yielded but a small amount of revenue, should be added to the\r\nfree list.  I urged the importance of stability in the rates imposed\r\non spirits, tobacco and fermented liquors.  These articles were\r\nregarded by all governments as proper subjects of taxation.  Any\r\nreduction in the rates imposed a heavy loss to the owner of the\r\nstock on hand, while an increase operated as a bounty to such owner.\r\n\r\nDuring that year, the excess of exports over imports amounted to\r\n$167,683,912.  The aggregate exports amounted to $835,638,658, an\r\nincrease over the previous year of $125,199,217.\r\n\r\nThe usual statement of the operations of the different bureaus of\r\nthe department was made, and, in closing my last annual report as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The secretary takes pleasure in bearing testimony to the general\r\nfidelity and ability of the officers and employees of this department.\r\nAs a rule they have, by experience and attention to duty, become\r\nalmost indispensable to the public service.  The larger portion of\r\nthem have been in the department more than ten years, and several\r\nhave risen by their efficiency from the lowest-grade clerks to high\r\npositions.  In some cases their duties are technical and difficult,\r\nrequiring the utmost accuracy; in others, they must be trusted with\r\ngreat sums, where the slightest ground for suspicion would involve\r\ntheir ruin; in others, they must act judicially upon legal questions\r\naffecting large private and public interests, as to which their\r\ndecisions are practically final.  It is a just subject of congratulation\r\nthat, during the last year, there has been among these officers no\r\ninstance of fraud, defalcation, or gross neglect of duty.  The\r\ndepartment is a well organized and well conducted business office,\r\ndepending mainly for its success upon the integrity and fidelity\r\nof the heads of bureaus and chiefs of division.  The secretary has,\r\ntherefore, deemed it both wise and just to retain and reward the\r\nservices of tried and faithful officers and clerks.\r\n\r\n\"During the last twenty years the business of this department has\r\nbeen greatly increased, and its efficiency and stability greatly\r\nimproved.  This improvement is due to the continuance during that\r\nperiod of the same general policy and the consequent absence of\r\nsweeping changes in the public service; to the fostering of merit\r\nby the retention and promotion of trained and capable men; and to\r\nthe growth of the wholesome conviction in all quarters that training,\r\nno less than intelligence, is indispensable to good service.  Great\r\nharm would come to the public interests should the fruits of this\r\nexperience be lost, by whatever means the loss occurred.  To protect\r\nnot only the public service, but the people, from such a disaster,\r\nthe secretary renews the recommendation made in a former report,\r\nthat provision be made for a tenure of office for a fixed period,\r\nfor removal only for cause, and for some increase of pay for long\r\nand faithful service.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief measure of importance, aside from the current appropriation\r\nbills, acted upon during that session of Congress was a bill to\r\nfacilitate the refunding of the national debt.  It was pending\r\nwithout action during the two preceding sessions, but was taken up\r\nin the early part of the third session.  As the bill was originally\r\nreported, by Mr. Fernando Wood, from the committee of ways and\r\nmeans of the House of Representatives, it provided that in lieu of\r\nthe bonds authorized by the refunding act of July 14, 1870, bearing\r\nfive, four and a half, and four per cent. interest, bonds bearing\r\ninterest at the rate of three and a half per cent. to the amount\r\nof $500,000,000, redeemable at the pleasure of the United States,\r\nand also notes to the amount of $200,000,000, bearing interest at\r\nthe rate of three and a half per cent., redeemable at the pleasure\r\nof the United States after two years and payable in ten years, be\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to issue any of these\r\nbonds or notes for any of the bonds of the United States, as they\r\nbecame redeemable, par for par.  The bill further provided that\r\nthe three and a half per cents. should be the only bonds receivable\r\nas security for national bank circulation.\r\n\r\nHad this bill passed, as introduced, any time before the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1881, it would have saved the United States enormous sums of\r\nmoney and would have greatly strengthened the public credit.  It\r\nwas in harmony with the recommendations made by the President and\r\nmyself in our annual reports.  It was called up in the House of\r\nRepresentatives for definite action on the 14th of December, 1880,\r\nwhen those reports were before them.  Instead of this action\r\namendments of the wildest character were offered, and the committee\r\nwhich reported the bill acquiesced in radical changes, which made\r\nthe execution of the law, if passed, practically impossible.  The\r\nrate of interest was reduced to three per cent., and a provision\r\nmade that no bonds should be taken as security for bank circulation\r\nexcept the three per cent. bonds provided for by that bill.\r\nDiscussion was continued in the House and radical amendments were\r\nmade until the 19th of January, 1881, when the bill, greatly changed,\r\npassed the House of Representatives.  It was taken up in the Senate\r\non the 15th of February.  Mr. Bayard made a very fair statement of\r\nthe terms and objects of the bill in an elaborate speech, from\r\nwhich I quote the following paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"In little more than sixty days from this date a loan of the United\r\nStates, bearing five per cent. interest, and amounting to $469,651,050,\r\nwill, at the option of the government, become payable.  On the 30th\r\nday of June next, two other loans, each bearing six per cent.,\r\nthe first for $145,786,500, and the other $57,787,250, will also\r\nmature at the option of the government.  These facts are stated in\r\nthe last report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and will be found\r\non page ten of his report of last December.  He has informed us\r\nthat the surplus revenue accruing prior to the 1st of July, 1881,\r\nwill amount to about fifty million dollars, and can and will be\r\napplied in part to the extinguishment of that debt.  Bonds maturing\r\non the 31st of December last were paid out of the accruing revenues.\r\nSo that there will remain the sum of $637,350,000, to be provided\r\nfor and funded at the option of the government, at such rate of\r\ninterest as may be deemed advisable by Congress and can practicably\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n\"The sums that we are dealing with are enormous, affecting the\r\nwelfare of every branch of our country's industry and of our entire\r\npeople.  The opportunity for reducing the rate of interest upon\r\nthis enormous sum, and, not only that, but of placing the national\r\ndebt more under the control of the government in regard to future\r\npayments, is now before us.  The opportunity for doing this upon\r\nfavorable terms should not be lost, and the only question before\r\nus, as legislators, is how we can best and most practically take\r\nadvantage of the hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill as modified by the committee of the Senate would have\r\nenabled the treasury department to enter at once on the refunding\r\nof the public debt, and, in the then state of the money market,\r\nthere would have been no doubt of the ready sale of the bonds and\r\nnotes provided for and the redemption of the five and six per cent.\r\nbonds outstanding.  The Senate, however, after long debates,\r\ndisagreed to the amendments of the committee, and in substance\r\npassed the bill as it came from the House.  The few amendments made\r\nwere agreed to by the House, and the bill passed and was sent to\r\nthe President on the 1st of March.  On the 3rd of March it was\r\nreturned by the President with a statement of his objections to\r\nits passage.  These were based chiefly on the provision which\r\nrequired the banks to deposit in the treasury, as security for\r\ntheir circulating notes, bonds bearing three per cent. interest,\r\nwhich, in his judgment, was an insufficient security.  His message\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"To the House of Representatives:--Having considered the bill\r\nentitled 'An act to facilitate the refunding of the national debt,'\r\nI am constrained to return it to the House of Representatives, in\r\nwhich it originated, with the following statement of my objections\r\nto its passage.\r\n\r\n\"The imperative necessity for prompt action, and the pressure of\r\npublic duties in this closing week of my term of office, compel me\r\nto refrain from any attempt to make a full and satisfactory\r\npresentation of the objections to the bill.\r\n\r\n\"The importance of the passage, at the present session of Congress,\r\nof a suitable measure for the refunding of the national debt, which\r\nis about to mature, is generally recognized.  It has been urged\r\nupon the attention of Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand in my last annual message.  If successfully accomplished, it\r\nwill secure a large decrease in the annual interest payment of the\r\nnation; and I earnestly recommend, if the bill before me shall\r\nfail, that another measure for this purpose be adopted before the\r\npresent Congress adjourns.\r\n\r\n\"While in my opinion it would be wise to authorize the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, in his discretion, to offer, to the public, bonds\r\nbearing three and a half per cent. interest in aid of refunding,\r\nI should not deem it my duty to interpose my constitutional objection\r\nto the passage of the present bill if it did not contain, in its\r\nfifth section, provisions which, in my judgment, seriously impair\r\nthe value and tend to the destruction of the present national\r\nbanking system of the country.  This system has now been in operation\r\nalmost twenty years.  No safer or more beneficial banking system\r\nwas ever established.  Its advantages as a business are free to\r\nall who have the necessary capital.  It furnishes a currency to\r\nthe public which, for convenience and the security of the bill-\r\nholder, has probably never been equaled by that of any other banking\r\nsystem.  Its notes are secured by the deposit with the government\r\nof the interest-bearing bonds of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The section of the bill before me which relates to the national\r\nbanking system, and to which objection is made, is not an essential\r\npart of a refunding measure.  It is as follows:\r\n\r\n'Sec. 5.  From and after the 1st day of July, 1881, the three per\r\ncent. bonds authorized by the first section of this act shall be\r\nthe only bonds receivable as security for national bank circulation,\r\nor as security for the safekeeping and prompt payment of the public\r\nmoney deposited with such banks; but when any such bonds deposited\r\nfor the purposes aforesaid shall be designated for purchase or\r\nredemption by the Secretary of the Treasury, the banking association\r\ndepositing the same shall have the right to substitute other issues\r\nof the bonds of the United States in lieu thereof:  _Provided_,\r\nThat no bond upon which interest has ceased shall be accepted or\r\nshall be continued on deposit as security for circulation or for\r\nthe safe-keeping of the public money; and in case bonds so deposited\r\nshould not be withdrawn, as provided by law, within thirty days\r\nafter interest has ceased thereon, the banking association depositing\r\nthe same shall be subject to the liabilities and proceedings on\r\nthe part of the comptroller provided for in section 5234 of the\r\nRevised Statutes of the United States:  _And provided further_,\r\nThat section 4 of the act of June 20, 1874, entitled:  \"An act\r\nfixing the amount of United States notes, providing for a redistribution\r\nof the national bank currency, and for other purposes,\" be, and\r\nthe same is hereby, repealed; and sections 5159 and 5160 of the\r\nRevised Statutes of the United States be, and the same are hereby,\r\nre-enacted.'\r\n\r\n\"Under this section it is obvious that no additional banks will\r\nhereafter be organized, except possibly in a few cities or localities\r\nwhere the prevailing rates of interest in ordinary business are\r\nextremely low.  No new banks can be organized, and no increase of\r\nthe capital of existing banks can be obtained, except by the purchase\r\nand deposit of three per cent. bonds.  No other bonds of the United\r\nStates can be used for the purpose.  The one thousand millions of\r\nother bonds recently issued by the United States, and bearing a\r\nhigher rate of interest than three per cent., and therefore a better\r\nsecurity for the bill-holder, cannot, after the 1st of July next,\r\nbe received as security for bank circulation.  This is a radical\r\nchange in the banking law.  It takes from the banks the right they\r\nhave heretofore had under the law to purchase and deposit, as\r\nsecurity for their circulation, any of the bonds issued by the\r\nUnited States, and deprives the bill-holder of the best security\r\nwhich the banks are able to give, by requiring them to deposit\r\nbonds having the least value of any bonds issued by the government.\r\n\r\n\"The average rate of taxation of capital employed in banking is\r\nmore than double the rate of taxation upon capital employed in\r\nother legitimate business.  Under these circumstances, to amend\r\nthe banking law so as to deprive the banks of the privilege of\r\nsecuring their notes by the most valuable bonds issued by the\r\ngovernment will, it is believed, in a large part of the country,\r\nbe a practical prohibition of the organization of new banks, and\r\nprevent the existing banks from enlarging their capital.  The\r\nnational banking system, if continued at all, will be a monopoly\r\nin the hands of those already engaged in it, who may purchase\r\ngovernment bonds bearing a more favorable rate of interest than\r\nthe three per cent. bonds prior to next July.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent the further organization of banks is to put in jeopardy\r\nthe whole system, by taking from it that feature which makes it,\r\nas it now is, a banking system free upon the same terms to all who\r\nwish to engage in it.  Even the existing banks will be in danger\r\nof being driven from business by the additional disadvantages to\r\nwhich they will be subjected by this bill.  In short, I cannot but\r\nregard the fifth section of the bill as a step in the direction of\r\nthe destruction of the national banking system.\r\n\r\n\"Our country, after a long period of business depression, has just\r\nentered upon a career of unexampled prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"The withdrawal of the currency from circulation of the national\r\nbanks, and then enforced winding up of the banks in consequence,\r\nwould inevitably bring a serious embarrassment and disaster to the\r\nbusiness of the country.  Banks of issue are essential instruments\r\nof modern commerce.  If the present efficient and admirable system\r\nof banking is broken down, it will inevitably be followed by a\r\nrecurrence to other and inferior methods of banking.  Any measure\r\nlooking to such a result will be a disturbing element in our\r\nfinancial system.  It will destroy confidence and surely check the\r\ngrowing prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that a measure for refunding the national debt is not\r\nnecessarily connected with the national banking law, and that any\r\nrefunding act would defeat its own object, if it imperiled the\r\nnational banking system, or seriously impaired its usefulness; and\r\nconvinced that section 5 of the bill before me would, if it should\r\nbecome a law, work great harm, I herewith return the bill to the\r\nHouse of Representatives for that further consideration which is\r\nprovided for in the constitution.\r\n\r\n  \"Rutherford B. Hayes.\r\n\"Executive mansion, March 3, 1881.\"\r\n\r\nPreceding this message, during the last week in February, there\r\nwas a serious disturbance in the money market, especially in\r\nconnection with the national banks, caused by a fear that the bill\r\nwould become a law.  Appeals were made to me to furnish relief.\r\nAll I could do was to purchase $10,000,000 of bonds to be paid from\r\nan overflowing treasury, but the veto of the President settled the\r\nfate of the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nELECTED TO THE SENATE FOR THE FOURTH TIME.\r\nBlaine Appointed Secretary of State--Withdrawal of Governor Foster\r\nas a Senatorial Candidate--I Am Again Elected to My Old Position\r\nto Succeed Allen G. Thurman--My Visit to Columbus to Return Thanks\r\nto the Legislature--Address to Boston Merchants on Finances--Windom\r\nRecommended to Succeed Me as Secretary of the Treasury--Personal\r\nCharacteristics of Garfield--How He Differed from President Hayes\r\n--The Latter's Successful Administration--My One Day out of Office\r\nin Over Forty Years--Long Animosity of Don Piatt and His Change of\r\nOpinion in 1881--Mahone's Power in the Senate--Windom's Success in\r\nthe Treasury--The Conkling-Platt Controversy with the President\r\nOver New York Appointments.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of November, 1880, General Garfield came to\r\nWashington and called upon Mr. Blaine, who, it was understood, was\r\nto be Secretary of State.  Garfield came to my house directly from\r\nBlaine's and informed me that he had tendered that office to Blaine\r\nand that it was accepted.  He said that Blaine thought it would\r\nnot be politic to continue me as Secretary of the Treasury, as it\r\nwould be regarded as an unfriendly discrimination by other members\r\nof Hayes' cabinet.  I promptly replied that I agreed with the\r\nopinion of Blaine, and was a candidate for the Senate.  It was then\r\nunderstood that Garfield was committed to Foster for the vacancy\r\nin the Senate, but this he denied, and, whatever might have been\r\nhis preference, I am convinced he took no part in the subsequent\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of December, Thomas A. Cowgill, speaker of the House\r\nof Representatives, of Ohio, wrote a note to Governor Foster advising\r\nhis withdrawal \"for harmony in our counsels and unity in our action.\"\r\nOn the next day, after advising with leading Republicans, Foster,\r\nin a manly letter, declined further to be a candidate for Senator.\r\n\r\nPrior to the withdrawal of Foster I received a note from General\r\nGarfield from Mentor, Ohio, under date of December 15, 1880, in\r\nwhich he said:  \"I am glad to see that the unpleasant matters\r\nbetween yourself and Governor Foster have been so happily adjusted,\r\nand I am quite sure that a little further understanding will remove\r\nall dangers of a personal contest, which might disturb the harmony\r\nof the party in Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nI subsequently received the following note from Garfield:\r\n\r\n  \"Mentor, O., December 22, 1880.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 20th inst. came duly to hand.  I\r\nappreciate what you say in reference to personal and Ohio appointments.\r\nThe case of Swaim is so exceptional that I hope it will not be\r\ntaken as a precedent for what is to come.  I am greatly gratified\r\nat the happy turn which the relations between Foster and yourself\r\nhave taken.\r\n\r\n\"I will forward my declination of the senatorship in time to reach\r\nthe general assembly on the first day of its session.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will not fail to visit me on your trip to Ohio.  Mrs.\r\nGarfield joins me in the hope that Mrs. Sherman will accompany you.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"J. A. Garfield.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to this and former requests I visited General Garfield\r\nat his residence at Mentor, and discussed with him a multitude of\r\nsubjects that he suggested, among them the selection of his cabinet,\r\nand the public questions pending in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in the Republican caucus, on the 11th of January,\r\n1881, soon after the Ohio legislature met, as narrated in the public\r\npress at the time, were exceedingly flattering.  General Jones, of\r\nDelaware, made the nominating speech, reciting at considerable\r\nlength, and with high praise, my previous public service.  Peter\r\nHitchcock, a distinguished member, seconded the nomination with\r\nanother complimentary speech.  It was supposed that Judge W. H.\r\nWest, a leading lawyer and citizen, would be placed in nomination,\r\nbut his spokesman, Judge Walker, no doubt with the approval of\r\nJudge West, moved that my nomination be made unanimous, which was\r\ndone.  Upon being notified of this I sent the following telegram:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., January 11, 1881.\r\n\"Hon. J. Scott, Chairman.\r\n\r\n\"Please convey to the Republican members of the two houses of the\r\ngeneral assembly my heartfelt thanks for their unanimous nomination\r\nfor the position of United States Senator.  No words can express\r\nmy sense of grateful obligation to the people of Ohio for their\r\nlong continued partiality.  I can assure you that, if elected, I\r\nwill, with diligence and fidelity, do my utmost to discharge the\r\nduties assigned me.\r\n\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January I was duly elected Senator as successor of\r\nAllen G. Thurman, who received the Democratic vote.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an old custom in Ohio I went to Columbus on the\r\n20th of January to return my thanks to the legislature, and was\r\nreceived in the senate chamber by the two houses.  I was escorted\r\nto a chair with Governor Foster on my right and Governor Dennison\r\non my left, Governor Foster presiding.  I was introduced by Governor\r\nFoster in a generous and eloquent speech, closing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, a year ago at this time we were here present to\r\nmeet General Garfield, to greet him as United States Senator, and\r\nto listen to his words of thanks for the great honor conferred upon\r\nhim.  We are met to-night for the purpose of greeting the Senator\r\nelected to-day, and to listen to his words of thanks for the great\r\nhonor conferred upon him.  This gentleman has been in public life\r\ntwenty-six years.  For six years he served as a Member of Congress\r\nfrom the Mansfield district, with credit and with distinction.\r\nThrice elected a United States Senator before, for sixteen years\r\nhe occupied the position of United States Senator, ever in the\r\nfront rank of the intellectual giants composing that body.  Called\r\nhence to be Secretary of the Treasury, this distinguished gentleman\r\nhas filled that place with honor.  He has been at all times the\r\nfriend of resumption and of the prosperity of the people.  To him,\r\nperhaps, more than to any other one man, is due the resumption of\r\nspecie payments and the prosperity of this people to-day.  As a\r\ngreat financier he stands as a peer with Hamilton, with Chase.\r\nGentlemen, you have selected wisely and well.  I now have the\r\npleasure of presenting John Sherman, Senator-elect from the State\r\nof Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I responded, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, Senators, Members of the General Assembly:--My first\r\nduty is to return to you my grateful thanks for the high honor you\r\nhave conferred upon me in selecting me for the fourth time a Member\r\nof the Senate of the United States.  Four years ago I assumed a\r\nsomewhat different office.  And now, having been honored by you by\r\nbeing transferred to the position formerly occupied by me, I feel\r\nvery much like a traveler who has made a long journey into a far\r\ndistant country and who is returning home in safety and honor.\r\nThe place I now occupy has been one of great embarrassment and\r\ndifficulty.  I have been away from the people of my native state,\r\nwith but scarce a few fleeting, short visits, and have lost the\r\nacquaintances I have had with so many of you, and have not been\r\nable to form new acquaintances among you.  I find among the members\r\nof the general assembly but comparatively few of those whom I knew\r\nin the olden times.\r\n\r\n\"I assumed the duties of the office of which I speak under\r\ncircumstances of great embarrassment.  I was held up before the\r\npublic for a long time as one who was pursuing a policy that brought\r\nwoes unnumbered--greater than befell the Greeks between Achilles\r\nand Agamemnon.  All the evils that fell upon society in the United\r\nStates during the period, all the grave distress, was simply\r\nattributed to me as a fault.  I was compelled to say 'No' a thousand\r\ntimes where I would gladly have said 'Yes.'  I was compelled to\r\ndecline the advice of men honestly given for a good purpose, because\r\nin my judgment that advice would not promote the public good.  And\r\nnow, having been elected by you under those adverse circumstances,\r\nI feel my heart overflowing with gratitude, and have no words with\r\nwhich to utter my thanks.  I am glad, however, of the assurance\r\nyou have given me by the unanimous nomination of my Republican\r\nfriends, and by the courtesy, kindness and forbearance of my\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to know and feel the assurance that you now believe\r\nthat, under the trying circumstances, I did the best I could to\r\nadvance the common interest of our common country.\r\n\r\n\"And I am glad to approve the votes that were given by my Democratic\r\nfellow-citizens here in the contest yesterday and to-day.  If any\r\nman could be chosen from the State of Ohio to advocate in the\r\nAmerican Senate the principles of the Democratic party, there is\r\nno man in Ohio, or in the United States, more deserving of that\r\nhonor than Allen G. Thurman.  For many years he and I served together\r\nas representatives of opposing parties.  We, each with the vigor\r\nand power we could, endeavored to impress our views upon the public,\r\nto carry out the line of policy to which our political friends were\r\ndevoted.  And in all that time no words of unkindness, no words of\r\nasperity, have passed between us.  We never brought Ohio quarrels\r\nbefore the Senate of the United States, and always found that\r\nhonesty and ability were entirely consistent with gentlemanly\r\ncourtesy between political opponents.\r\n\r\n\"And I wish also to return my grateful acknowledgments to Governor\r\nFoster for the kindly language with which he has introduced me to\r\nyou, and to many distinguished citizens of Ohio who, by their kind\r\nand generous forbearance, have enabled you, without division, to\r\nsend a Senator to the Congress of the United States without a\r\nquarrel, a contest or a struggle, and I feel under obligations to\r\nthe gentleman who has introduced me largely for this distinguished\r\nhonor and courtesy.\r\n\r\n\"I can only say then, in conclusion, fellow-citizens, that I am\r\nglad that the opportunity of the office you have given me will\r\nenable me to come back here home to Ohio to cultivate again the\r\nrelations I had of old.  It is one of the happiest thoughts that\r\ncomes to me in consequence of your election that I will be able to\r\nlive again among you and to be one of you, and I trust in time to\r\novercome the notion that has sprung up within two or three years\r\nthat I am a human iceberg, dead to all human sympathies.  I hope\r\nyou will enable me to overcome that difficulty.  That you will\r\nreceive me kindly, and I think I will show you, if you doubt it,\r\nthat I have a heart to acknowledge gratitude--a heart that feels\r\nfor others, and willing to alleviate where I can all the evils to\r\nwhich men and women are subject.  I again thank you from the bottom\r\nof my heart.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many incidents in my life I recall this as one of the\r\nhappiest, when the bitterness and strife of political contests were\r\nlaid aside and kindness and charity took their place.  I am glad\r\nto say that the same friendly relations that existed between Senator\r\nThurman and myself have always been maintained with each of my\r\ncolleagues, without distinction of party.\r\n\r\nEarly in January I had accepted an invitation of the merchants of\r\nBoston to attend the annual dinner of their association on the 31st\r\nof that month.  While the dinner was the stated object, yet I knew\r\nthat the speeches to be made were the real cause of the meeting.\r\nThese were to be made by Governor Long, Stewart L. Woodford and\r\nothers, real orators, while I was expected to talk to them about\r\nmoney, debt and taxes.  I met their wishes by a careful statement\r\nof the mode of refunding, or, to define the word, the process of\r\nreducing the burden of the public debt by reducing the rate of\r\ninterest.  I stated at length the measures executed by Hamilton,\r\nGallatin and others, in paying in full the Revolutionary debt and\r\nthat created by the War of 1812, and those adopted in recent times.\r\nThe mode at each period was similar, but the amount of recent\r\nrefundings was twenty times greater than the national debt at the\r\nbeginning of the government, and our surplus revenue for that one\r\nyear just past would have paid the debt of the United States at\r\nthe close of the Revolutionary War.  In all stages of our history\r\nwe have preserved the public faith by the honest discharge of every\r\nobligation.  Long, Woodford and others made eloquent speeches, and,\r\non the whole, the \"dinner\" was a pronounced success.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to Washington, Garfield continued to write me\r\nfreely, especially about the selection of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  In a note dated February 14 he gave me the names of a\r\nnumber of prominent men and his impressions about them, but I do\r\nnot feel at liberty to insert it.  In my answer of the date of\r\nFebruary 16, after expressing my opinion of those named, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Since our last conversation in Mentor I have turned this important\r\nmatter over and over again in my mind, and I drift back pretty\r\nnearly to the opinion I then expressed, that, assuming that a\r\nwestern man is to be appointed, my judgment would lead me to select,\r\nfirst, Windom. . . . He is certainly a man of high character, of\r\npleasant manners, free from any political affiliations that would\r\nbe offensive to you, on good terms with all, yet a man of decision.\"\r\n\r\nI knew Garfield well.  From his early advent in 1861 in the\r\nlegislature of Ohio, when I was a candidate for the Senate, to the\r\ndate of his death, I had every opportunity to study his character.\r\nHe was a large, well developed, handsome man, with a pleasing\r\naddress and a natural gift for oratory.  Many of his speeches were\r\nmodels of eloquence.  These qualities naturally made him popular.\r\nBut his will power was not equal to his personal magnetism.  He\r\neasily changed his mind, and honestly veered from one impulse to\r\nanother.  This, I think, will be admitted by his warmest friends.\r\nDuring the trying period between his election and inauguration his\r\nopinions wavered, but Blaine, having similar personal qualities,\r\nbut a stronger will, gained a powerful influence with him.  When\r\nI proposed to him to be a delegate at large to the Chicago convention,\r\nhe no doubt meant in good faith to support my nomination.  When\r\nhis own nomination seemed probable he acquiesced in, and perhaps\r\ncontributed to it, but after his election he was chiefly guided by\r\nhis brilliant Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThere was a striking contrast between the personal qualities of\r\nGarfield and Hayes.  Hayes was a modest man, but a very able one.\r\nHe had none of the brilliant qualities of his successor, but his\r\njudgment was always sound, and his opinion, when once formed, was\r\nstable and consistent.  He was a graduate of Kenyon college and\r\nthe law school at Cambridge.  He had held several local offices in\r\nCincinnati, had served with high credit in the Union army, and had\r\nattained the rank of major general by conspicuous heroism in battle.\r\nHe had been twice elected a Member of Congress from Cincinnati and\r\nthree times as Governor of Ohio, and in 1876 was elected President\r\nof the United States.  The contest which was ended by his inauguration\r\nhas already been referred to.  During his entire term, our official\r\nand personal relations were not only cordial, but as close and\r\nintimate as that of brothers could be.  I never took an important\r\nstep in the process of resumption and refunding, though the law\r\nvested the execution of these measures in my office, without\r\nconsulting him.  Yet, while expressing his opinion, he said this\r\nbusiness must be conducted by me, and that I was responsible.\r\n\r\nEarly in his administration we formed the habit of taking long\r\ndrives on each Sunday afternoon, in the environs of Washington.\r\nHe was a regular attendant with Mrs. Hayes, every Sunday morning,\r\nat the Methodist Episcopal church, of which she was a member.  This\r\nduty being done we felt justified in seeking the seclusion of the\r\ncountry for long talks about current measures and policy.  Each of\r\nus was prepared with a memorandum of queries.  My coachman, who\r\nhas been with me for twenty years, could neither heed nor hear.\r\nWe did not invade any of the departments of the government outside\r\nof the treasury and his official functions as President.  This\r\nexchange of opinion was of service to the public, and gave to each\r\nof us the benefit of an impartial opinion from the other.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of public men I have met I have known no one\r\nwho held a higher sense of his duty to his country, and more\r\nfaithfully discharged that duty, than President Hayes.  He came\r\ninto his great office with the prejudice of a powerful party against\r\nhim, caused by a close and disputed election.  This was unjust to\r\nhim, for the decision was made by a tribunal created mainly by its\r\nrepresentatives.  He went out of office at the close of his term\r\nwith the hearty respect of the American people, and his administration\r\nmay be placed as among the most beneficial and satisfactory in the\r\nhistory of the republic.\r\n\r\nWhen near the close of his term, he gave the usual dinner to the\r\nmembers of the outgoing and the incoming cabinets.  It was purely\r\nan official dinner, but Hayes said that there were two gentlemen\r\npresent who were not in office.  We looked around to see who the\r\nunhappy two were, and found they were Garfield and myself.  Garfield\r\nhad not yet become President and I had resigned as secretary the\r\nday before.  This happened to be the only day that I was not in\r\npublic office since March 4, 1855.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of March I delivered to the President my resignation,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  'Washington, March 3.\r\n\"Hon. R. B. Hayes, President United States.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Having been elected a Member of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, I have the honor to resign the office of Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, to take effect this day.  In thus severing our\r\nofficial relations, I avail myself of the opportunity to express\r\nmy grateful appreciation and heartfelt thanks for the support and\r\nassistance you have uniformly given me in the discharge of the\r\nduties of that office.  I shall ever cherish with pleasant memories\r\nmy friendly association with you as a member of your cabinet, and\r\nshall follow you in your retirement from your great office with my\r\nbest wishes and highest regards.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly your friend,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nDuring my service as Secretary of the Treasury I had been arraigned\r\nin every issue of the Sunday \"Capital,\" a newspaper published in\r\nWashington, in the severest terms of denunciation, by Don Piatt,\r\nthe owner of the paper.  He was a brilliant but erratic writer,\r\nformerly a member of the Ohio legislature and a native of that\r\nstate.  I believed that his animosity to me grew out of my re-\r\nelection to the Senate in 1865, when General Schenck, who was warmly\r\nsupported by Piatt, was my competitor.  Schenck and I always\r\nmaintained friendly relations.  He served his district long and\r\nfaithfully in the House of Representatives, was a brilliant debater,\r\nhad the power of condensing a statement or argument in the fewest\r\npossible words, and uttering them with effective force.  Next to\r\nMr. Corwin, and in some respects superior to him, Schenck was ranked\r\nas the ablest Member of the House of Representatives from Ohio\r\nduring his period of active life, from 1840 to his death, at\r\nWashington, D. C., March 23, 1890.  Schenck freely forgave me for\r\nhis defeat, but Piatt never did.\r\n\r\nAt the close of my term as secretary, much to my surprise, Piatt\r\nwrote and published in his paper an article, a portion of which I\r\ntrust I will be pardoned for inserting here:\r\n\r\n\"When John Sherman took the treasury, in March, 1877, it was plain\r\nthat the _piece de resistance_ of his administration would be the\r\nexperiment of the resumption act, which John, as chairman of the\r\nSenate finance committee, had elaborated two years before, and\r\nwhich was then just coming upon the threshold of practical test.\r\nThe question at issue was whether resumption of specie payments,\r\nafter eighteen years of suspension, could be accomplished through\r\nthe operation of laws of Congress, which, if not absolutely in\r\nconflict with the laws of political economy, were, to every visible\r\nappearance, several years in advance of them.  Of course, the\r\nprimary effect of the appreciation of our paper towards par with\r\nthe standard of coin was the enhancement of the purchasing power\r\nof the circulating medium.  That made it hard to pay debts which\r\nhad been contracted on low scales of purchasing power.  That which\r\nhad been bought for a dollar worth sixty cents, must be paid for\r\nwith a dollar worth eighty, ninety, or a hundred cents, according\r\nto the date on which the contract matured.  Of course, such a\r\nproceedings created an awful squeeze.  Many men, struggling under\r\nloads of debt, found the weight of their obligations growing upon\r\nthem faster than their power to meet, and they succumbed.\r\n\r\n\"For all this John Sherman was blamed.  He was named 'The Wrecker,'\r\nand the maledictions poured upon his head during the years 1877\r\nand 1878 could not be measured.  Every day the columns of the press\r\nrecorded new failures, and every failure added to the directory of\r\nJohn Sherman's maledictors.  But the man persevered.  And now,\r\nlooking back over the record of those two years, with all their\r\nstifled ambitions and ruined hopes, the grim resolution with which\r\nJohn, deafening his ears to the cry of distress from every quarter,\r\nkept his eye fixed upon the single object of his endeavor, seems\r\nhardly human--certainly not humane.  And yet there are few reasoning\r\nmen to be found now ready to deny that it was for the best, and,\r\ntaken all in all, a benefaction to the country; one of those sad\r\ncases, in fact, where it is necessary to be cruel in order to be\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\"We were not a supporter of John Sherman's policy at any period of\r\nits crucial test.  We did not believe that his gigantic experiment\r\ncould be brought to a successful conclusion.  The absurd currency\r\ntheories which were from time to time set up in antagonism to his\r\npolicy never impressed us; our disbelief was based upon our fear\r\nthat the commercial and industrial wreckage, consequent upon an\r\nincrease of forty per cent. in the purchasing power of money within\r\nthree years, would be infinitely greater than it turned out to be,\r\nand, so being, would overwhelm the country in one common ruin.\r\nBut we were mistaken.  John Sherman was right.  And it is but common\r\nfrankness to say of him, even as one would give the devil his due,\r\nthat he builded wiser than we knew--possibly wiser than he knew\r\nhimself.  At all events, John builded wisely.\r\n\r\n\"He took the treasury at a period when it was little more than a\r\ngreat national bank of discount, with rates varying from day to\r\nday; the coin standard a commodity of speculation on Wall street;\r\nthe credit of the government a football in the markets of the world;\r\nand our bonds begging favor of European capitalists.  He leaves it\r\nwhat it ought to be--a treasury pure and simple, making no discounts,\r\noffering no concessions, asking no favors; the board that once\r\nspeculated in coin as a commodity abolished, doors closed by reason\r\nof occupation gone; the credit of our government at the head of\r\nthe list of Christendom; since we are launching at par a three per\r\ncent. consol, which even England, banking house of the universe,\r\nhas never yet been able to maintain steadily above 97.\r\n\r\n\"This is no small achievement to stand as the record of four years.\r\nIt is an achievement that entitles the man who accomplished it to\r\nrank as one of the four great American financiers who really deserve\r\nthe title--Robert Morris, Albert Gallatin, Salmon P. Chase, and\r\nJohn Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"We take off our hat to John; not because we like him personally,\r\nbut because we admire the force of character, the power of intellect\r\nand the courage of conviction that enabled him to face his\r\ndifficulties, surmount his obstacles and overcome the resistance\r\nhe met.\r\n\r\n\"The treasury he took up in 1877 was a battle ground.  The treasury\r\nhe resigns to his successor in 1881 is a well-ordered machine of\r\nred tape and routine, requiring for its future successful administration\r\nlittle else than mediocrity, method and _laissez faire_.  As we\r\nsaid before, we take off our hat to John.  He is not a magnetic\r\nman like Blaine, not a lovable man like our poor, dear friend Matt.\r\nCarpenter, not a brilliant man like our Lamar; not like any of\r\nthese--warm of temperament, captivating of presence or dazzling of\r\nintellectual luminosity; but he is a great man, strong in the cold,\r\nsteadfast nerve that he inherits from his ancestor, and respectable\r\nin the symmetry of an intellect which, like a marble masterpiece,\r\nleaves nothing to regret except the thought that its perfection\r\nexcludes the blemish of a soul.  John Sherman will figure creditably\r\nin history.  Mankind soon forgets the sentimental acrimony of the\r\nmoment, provoked by the suffering of harsh processes, and remembers\r\nonly the grand results.  Thus John Sherman will figure in history\r\nas the man who resumed specie payments; and in that the visiting\r\nstatesman of 1876 and the wrecker of 1877-78 will be forgotten.\r\nWe congratulate John upon his translation into the history of\r\nsuccess as heartily as if we had been his supporter in the midst\r\nof all his tribulations.  Bully for John.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft, the eminent historian, lived in Washington for\r\nmany years during the latter part of his life.  His house was always\r\nan attractive and hospitable one.  I had many interesting conversations\r\nwith him, mainly on historical subjects.  Both of us carefully\r\neschewed politics, for to the end of his life, I think, he always\r\nregarded himself as a Democrat.  I insert an autograph letter from\r\nhim, written at the age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\n  \"1623 H Street,                       }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., February 22, 1881.}\r\n\"My Dear Mr. Sherman:--I thank you very much for the complete\r\nstatement, you were very good to send me, of the time and amounts\r\nof payments made to Washington as President.  Congratulating you\r\non the high state of the credit of the United States, I remain,\r\never, dear Mr. Secretary,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"Geo. Bancroft.\"\r\n\r\nBefore closing my recollections of the administration of President\r\nHayes I ought to express my high appreciation of my colleagues in\r\nhis cabinet.  It was throughout his term a happy family.  I do not\r\nrecall a single incident that disturbed the sincere friendship of\r\nits members, nor any clashing of opinions that produced discord or\r\ncontention.  Neither interfered with the duties of the other.  The\r\ntrue rule was acted upon that the head of each department should\r\nsubmit to the President his view of any important question that\r\narose in his department.  If the President wished the opinion of\r\nhis cabinet on any question, he submitted it to the cabinet but\r\ntook the responsibility of deciding it after hearing their opinions.\r\nIt was the habit of each head of a department to present any\r\nquestions of general interest in his department, but as a rule he\r\ndecided it with the approbation of the President.  Evarts was always\r\ngenial and witty, McCrary was an excellent Secretary of War.  He\r\nwas sensible, industrious and prudent.  Thompson was a charming\r\nold gentleman of pleasing manners and address, a good advocate and\r\nan eloquent orator, who had filled many positions of honor and\r\ntrust.  The President regretted his resignation, to engage in the\r\nabortive scheme of De Lesseps to construct the Panama Canal.\r\nAttorney General Devens was a good lawyer and judge and an accomplished\r\ngentleman.  He frequently assisted me in my resumption and refunding\r\noperations, and, fortunately for me, he agreed with me in my opinions\r\nas to the legality and expedience of the measures adopted.  General\r\nCarl Schurz was a brilliant and able man and discharged the duties\r\nof Secretary of the Interior with ability.  I had known him in the\r\nSenate as an admirable and eloquent debater, but in the cabinet he\r\nwas industrious and practical and heartily supported the policy of\r\nthe President and was highly esteemed by him.  Key, of Tennessee,\r\nwas selected as a moderate Democrat to represent the south.  This\r\nwas an experiment in cabinet making, cabinets being usually composed\r\nof members of the same party as the President, but Key proved to\r\nbe a good and popular officer.  The two vacancies that occurred by\r\nthe resignations of McCrary and Thompson were acceptably filled by\r\nGovernor Ramsey, of Minnesota, and Goff, of West Virginia.  Each\r\nof these gentlemen contributed to the success of Hayes' administration,\r\nand each of the heartily sympathized with, and supported the measures\r\nof, the treasury department.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of March, 1881, I attended the special session of\r\nthe Senate, called by President Hayes, and took the oath prescribed\r\nby law.  In conformity with the usages of the Senate, I lost my\r\npriority on the committee on finance by the interregnum in my\r\nservice, but was made chairman of the committee on the library,\r\nand a member of the committees on finance, rules, and privileges\r\nand elections.  Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, became chairman of the\r\ncommittee on finance, and, by the courtesy of the other members,\r\nI was placed next to him on that committee.  Our relations since\r\nour entrance together, in 1854, into the House of Representatives\r\nhad been so intimate and cordial that it made no practical difference\r\nwhich of us sat at the head of the table.  When I recalled the\r\nfacts that in both the Senate and House of Representatives I had\r\nbeen chairman of the financial committee, and Mr. Morrill a member,\r\nthat my service in the treasury department did not impair my fitness\r\nas chairman, but rather improved it, and that under precisely the\r\nsame conditions I had restored to Mr. Fessenden his former position,\r\nI felt piqued, but my feelings did not extend to Mr. Morrill, for\r\nwhom I had the highest respect and confidence, and with whom I\r\nrarely differed on any public question.  He is now the Nestor of\r\nthe Senate, wonderfully vigorous in mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe chief subject of political interest in this session was the\r\nattitude of William Mahone, a Senator from Virginia.  He had been\r\na distinguished officer in the Confederate army, was a small man\r\nphysically, but of wonderful vitality, of undoubted courage and\r\ntenacity.  He had broken from the Democratic party, of which he\r\nhad been a member, and had been elected a Senator on local issues\r\nin Virginia, arising chiefly out of the debt of that state.  When\r\nhe entered the Senate, that body was so equally divided that his\r\nvote would determine which party should have the control of its\r\norganization.  He quickly made his choice.  He was viciously assailed\r\nby Senator Hill, of Georgia, who, not by name but by plain inference,\r\ncharged Mahone with disgracing the commission he held.  The reply\r\nof Mahone was dramatic and magnetic.  His long hair, his peculiar\r\ndress and person, and his bold and aggressive language, attracted\r\nthe attention and sympathy of the Senate and the galleries.  He\r\nopened his brief speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, the Senator has assumed not only to be the custodian\r\nhere of the Democratic party of this nation; but he has dared to\r\nassert his right to speak for a constituency that I have the\r\nprivilege, the proud and honorable privilege on this floor, of\r\nrepresenting without his assent, without the assent of such Democracy\r\nas he speaks for.  I owe them, sir, I owe you [addressing Mr. Hill],\r\nand those for whom you undertake to speak, nothing in this chamber.\r\nI came here, sir, as a Virginian, to represent my people, not to\r\nrepresent the Democracy for which you stand.  I come with as proud\r\na claim to represent that people as you to represent the people of\r\nGeorgia, won on field where I have vied with Georgians whom I\r\ncommanded and others in the cause of my people and of their section\r\nin the late unhappy contest, but, thank God, for the peace and good\r\nof the country that contest is over, and as one of those who engaged\r\nin it, and who has neither here nor elsewhere any apology to make\r\nfor the part taken, I am here by my humble efforts to bring peace\r\nto this whole country, peace and good will between the sections,\r\nnot here as a partisan, not here to represent the Bourbonism which\r\nhas done so much injury to my section of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate that followed soon settled the position of General\r\nMahone.  He acted with the Republican party.  During the whole of\r\nthis session, which extended to May 20, little was done except to\r\ndebate Virginia politics, of which Mahone was the center.  His vote\r\nwas decisive of nearly every question presented.  I took part in\r\nthe long debate on the election of officers of the Senate, mainly\r\nwith Senator Bayard.  My sympathy was with Mahone, as I felt that,\r\nwhatever his view of the debt question in Virginia was, he was\r\nright on the reconstruction of the south and in opposition to the\r\nbitter sectionalism of the Democratic party in that state.  In\r\nreplying to Mr. Bayard I said I agreed with him in the principle\r\nthat the majority must rule.  I claimed, however, that when the\r\naction of a minority went beyond a reasonable delay it became\r\nrevolution and, in a word, was worse than revolution, it was treason;\r\nthat under the senate rules, and in conformity with them, this\r\ngovernment might be as absolutely destroyed as the southern\r\nConfederates would have destroyed it if they had succeeded; that\r\nthe rules were intended to be construed with reason and judgment;\r\nthat the minority had certain rights to interpose dilatory motions\r\nin order to delay and weary out the will of the majority, but when\r\nit went beyond that limit it entered upon dangerous ground; that\r\nthe simple question was whether the Senate should elect its officers\r\nby a majority vote or whether the minority should force the retention\r\nof those then in office.  The session closed without electing\r\nofficers of the Senate, and was in substance a debating society\r\ndoing nothing but talk and acting upon presidential appointments.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet of President Garfield, as finally selected, was a good\r\none and was promptly confirmed.  Mr. Blaine, for the head of it,\r\nwas determined upon early after the election, but the other members\r\nwere not decided upon until near the inauguration.  Mr. Windom\r\ncertainly proved himself a very able and accomplished Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury during the short period of his tenure.  As I held\r\nmyself in a large measure responsible for his appointment, I took\r\na great interest in his success.  He conferred with me freely about\r\nthe best mode of refunding the large amount of bonds that became\r\ndue on or before the 1st of July.  Congress having failed to pass\r\nany law to provide for the refunding of this debt, he resorted to\r\nan ingenious expedient, which answered the purpose of refunding.\r\nUnder a plan which was his own device there were called in, for\r\nabsolute payment on July 1, 1881, about $200,000,000 of bonds,\r\nmainly the six per cent. bonds of 1861, but permission was given\r\nto the holders of the bonds to have them continued at the pleasure\r\nof the government, with interest at the rate of three and a half\r\nper cent. per annum, provided the holder should so request, and\r\nthe bonds should be received at the treasury for that purpose on\r\nor before the 10th of May, 1881.  The plan proved entirely\r\nsatisfactory.  There were presented in due time, for continuance\r\nat three and a half per cent., the amount of $178,055,150 of bonds,\r\nleaving to be paid off from surplus revenue $24,211,400, for which\r\nthe treasury had ample resources.  Having succeeded in disposing\r\nof the six per cent. bonds, he gave notice that the coupon five\r\nper cent. bonds of the loans of July 14, 1870, and January 20,\r\n1871, would be paid on August 12, 1881, with a like privilege of\r\ncontinuing the bonds at three and a half per cent. to such of the\r\nholders who might present them for that purpose on or before July\r\n1, 1881.  At the same time the treasurer offered to receive for\r\ncontinuance any of the uncalled registered bonds of that loan to\r\nan amount not exceeding $250,000,000, the remainder of the loan\r\nbeing reserved with a view to its payment from the surplus revenues.\r\n\r\nThe annual saving in interest by the continuance of these bonds\r\namounted to $10,473,952.25.  I heartily approved this plan.  In a\r\nreported interview of the 14th of April I said:\r\n\r\n\"I see no difficulty in fully carrying out Secretary Windom's\r\npolicy, as far as developed.  He has ample means for reducing the\r\ninterest on the five and six per cent. bonds.  He can pay off all\r\nthose who wish to be paid in money, in strict accordance with the\r\nterms of these bonds, leaving the mass of them at three and a half\r\nper cent. interest, payable at the pleasure of Congress.  This is\r\nnot only for the public interest, but is on the clear line of his\r\npower and duty.  Indeed, I think it is better for the country than\r\nany refunding plan that would be carried out under a new law.  The\r\nold securities remain as redeemable bonds, bearing as low a rate\r\nof interest as any new bonds would bear, which could be now sold\r\nat par, and they are more readily payable with surplus revenue than\r\nany new bonds could be.  If it should appear next session that a\r\nthree per cent. bond would sell at par, that can be authorized.\r\nSecretary Windom is cautious and careful, and has done the very\r\nbest for the public that is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the public will be likely to respond largely to his\r\nefforts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have no doubt about it, unless an unforseen or sudden\r\nrevulsion occurs.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Windom demonstrated his ability, not only in the plan of\r\nrefunding the debt, but in the general conduct and management of\r\nhis department.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Garfield encountered the same difficulty as\r\nthat of Hayes in the selection of officers in the State of New\r\nYork.  The question was whether appointments in New York should be\r\nmade by the President or by a Senator from that state.  E. A.\r\nMerritt, collector of the port of New York, having been nominated\r\nfor consul general at London, William H. Robertson was nominated\r\nto the Senate in his place.  When the Senate considered this\r\nnomination Senator Conkling and his colleague, Senator Platt,\r\nopposed it, not for unfitness, but for the reason that they had\r\nnot been consulted in this matter, and that the selection was an\r\ninsult and in violation of pledges given Conkling by the President.\r\nWhen this opposition was known, the President withdrew previous\r\nappointments from that state, in order that the Senate might act\r\nupon the nomination of collector and definitely determine whether\r\nhe or the Senators should appoint United States officers in New\r\nYork.  Finding the nomination of Robertson would be confirmed, both\r\nSenators resigned on the 16th of May, and made their appeal to the\r\nlegislature of New York for re-election.  If they had been returned\r\nto the Senate, the President would have been powerless to appoint\r\nanyone in New York without consulting the Senators, practically\r\ntransferring to them his constitutional power.  Fortunately for\r\nthe country the legislature of New York elected E. C. Lapham and\r\nWarner Miller in the places of Conkling and Platt.\r\n\r\nHow far, if at all, the excitement of this contest led to the\r\nassassination of Garfield by Guiteau cannot be known; yet, this\r\ntragedy occurring soon after the contest, the popular mind connected\r\nthe two events, and the horror and detestation of the murder\r\nemphasized the rejection of Conkling and Platt.\r\n\r\nThe action of the President and of the New York legislature\r\ncontributed to check the interference of Senators in appointments\r\nto office, which had grown up, under what is called \"the courtesy\r\nof the Senate,\" to be a serious abuse.  The nomination of Stanley\r\nMatthews, eminently fitted for the office of justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt, was confirmed by a majority of only one vote, the objections\r\nto him being chiefly as did not relate to his fitness or qualifications\r\nfor that great office, but grew out of his intimate relations with\r\nHayes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nASSASSINATION OF GARFIELD AND EVENTS FOLLOWING.\r\nI Return to Mansfield for a Brief Period of Rest--Selected as\r\nPresiding Officer of the Ohio State Convention--My Address to the\r\nDelegates Indorsing Garfield and Governor Foster--Kenyon College\r\nConfers on Me the Degree of Doctor of Laws--News of the Assassination\r\nof the President--How He Differed from Blaine--Visit of General\r\nSherman--Reception by Old Soldiers--My Trip to Yellowstone Park--\r\nSpeechmaking at Salt Lake City--Visit to Virginia City--Placer\r\nMining in Montana--The Western Hunter Who Was Lost in a \"St. Louis\r\nCañon\"--Sunday in Yellowstone Park--Geysers in the Upper Basin--\r\nRolling Stones Down the Valley--Return Home--Opening of the Ohio\r\nCampaign--Death of Garfield.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the Senate I went to Mansfield, and enjoyed\r\nthe comfort and quiet of home life after the turbulence and anxiety\r\nof four years of severe labor as Secretary of the Treasury.  The\r\nstate convention was to be held at Cleveland on the 18th of June.\r\nThere were signs of disaffection growing out of the events of the\r\npast year, which threatened to disturb the harmony of the Republican\r\nparty.  I determined to do all I could to allay this, and for that\r\npurpose to attend the convention as a delegate and promote, as far\r\nas I could, the renomination of Governor Foster.  When the convention\r\nmet I was selected as its president, and in my speech I took care\r\nto express my support of Governor Foster and the administration of\r\nGarfield.\r\n\r\nI said that Governor Foster was entitled to renomination, and I\r\nbelieved would receive it at the hands of the convention, that his\r\nable and earnest canvass two years before had laid the foundation\r\nfor a great victory, culminating in the election of Garfield as\r\nPresident.  I called attention to the achievements of the Republican\r\nparty during the past twenty-five years in war and in peace.  I\r\nwarned the convention that there was no room in Ohio, or in this\r\ncountry, for a \"boss,\" or a leader who commands and dictates, and\r\nsaid:  \"The man who aspires to it had better make his will beforehand.\"\r\nI congratulated the convention upon the auspicious opening of the\r\nadministration of President Garfield and said:\r\n\r\n\"We know office-seeking is undoubtedly the proper pursuit of mankind.\r\nThere may be some disappointments, because there are fewer places\r\nto fill than men willing to fill them.  But, in the main, the\r\ngeneral principles and policy of this administration are in harmony\r\nwith the aspirations of the Republican party.  The financial policy\r\nof the last administration has been supplemented by the reduction\r\nof the rate of interest on $500,000,000 of the public securities\r\nfrom five and six per cent. to three and a half per cent.  This\r\nwise measure has been carefully and most skillfully managed by\r\nSecretary Windom, an Ohio boy. . . . They are saving $15,000,000\r\na year, and now the debt which frightened brave men fifteen years\r\nago has melted away like snow before a summer sun, no longer\r\nfrightening the timid.  And now the tax on whisky will pay the\r\ninterest on the public debt.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Ohio are satisfied with the administration, I believe,\r\nas it now stands.  I believe I can say, in advance of the resolution\r\nthat has been, or that will be, offered, that President Garfield\r\nhas the emphatic approval of the Republicans of Ohio in the course\r\nhe has pursued thus far.  Let him further advance the public credit;\r\nlet him punish all who do wrong; let him give us an administration\r\npure, simple and republican, worthy of a nation like ours, and we\r\nwill send him our approval twice over again.  But, we have something\r\nto do in this task.  We have got to emphasize our approval by\r\nindorsing this administration in the election of the Republican\r\nticket this fall.  This is no child's play.  We know of the good\r\nwork of the Republican party, that it has a powerful constituency\r\nbehind it, we dare not do anything wrong, or they will push us from\r\nour positions, if we do not behave ourselves.  Let us, then, do\r\nour part; work as Republicans of Ohio know how to work, and victory\r\nwill perch upon our banners.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the convention, from beginning to end, were\r\nconducted without any serious division or excitement.  The threatened\r\noutbreak against Foster did not occur.  Upon the close of my speech\r\nI announced that the first business in order was the nomination of\r\na candidate for governor.  Foster was nominated by acclamation,\r\nwithout a dissenting voice.  The rest of the ticket was composed\r\nof popular candidates, and an exceptionally good platform was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of June, I attended alumni day of Kenyon college,\r\nin company with ex-President Hayes and many leading men of Ohio.\r\nDelano Hall, the gift of Columbus Delano, and Hubbard Hall were\r\ndedicated with appropriate services, conducted by Bishop Bedell\r\nand President Bodine.  On this occasion the degree of Doctor of\r\nLaws was conferred upon me, and I told the faculty how earnestly\r\nI had wished to graduate in their college, and why I could not do\r\nso.  Frank Hurd and Mr. Hayes, both graduates, made interesting\r\naddresses.  This college was founded mainly upon liberal contributions\r\nto Bishop Chase, by Lord Kenyon and other Englishmen.  Its governing\r\npower was the Episcopal church.  It has had many vicissitudes of\r\nprosperity and depression, but has never realized the hopes of its\r\nfounders.  It is one of the colleges of Ohio, excellent in their\r\nway, but if their limited resources had been combined in one great\r\nuniversity, free from sectarian influence, the result would, in my\r\nopinion, have been much better for the youth of Ohio.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I was busy putting my country house in order.\r\nI was literally \"repairing the fences.\"  The absence, during four\r\nyears, of Mrs. Sherman and myself made a great change in the\r\ncondition of my house, grounds and farm.  The work of restoration\r\nwas a pleasant one, and I was relieved from appeals for appointments,\r\nfrom the infinite details of an exacting office, and still more\r\nfrom the grave responsibility of dealing with vast sums, in which,\r\nhowever careful I might be, and free from fault, I was subject to\r\nimputations and innuendoes by every writer who disapproved of my\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nI was arranging for a trip to Yellowstone Park, was receiving\r\nvisitors from abroad daily, and mixing with my neighbors and fellow-\r\ntownsmen, congratulating myself upon a period of rest and recreation,\r\nwhen, on the 2nd of July, I received from General Sherman the\r\nannouncement, by telegram, that Garfield had been shot by Guiteau,\r\nand that the wound was dangerous, and perhaps fatal.  The full\r\ndetails of this crime were soon given.  I started to go to Washington,\r\nbut returned when advised that I could be of no service, but\r\ncontinued to receive from General Sherman frequent bulletins.  The\r\nposition of the fatal bullet could not be ascertained, and Garfield\r\nlingered in suffering until the 19th of September, when he died.\r\n\r\nThe death of Garfield, by the hand of a half crazy crank, created\r\na profound impression throughout the civilized world.  To rise to\r\nsuch a height as he had attained, and then to become the victim of\r\nsuch a wretch, was a calamity that excited profound sympathy for\r\nthe President, and unusual detestation for the murderer.  The\r\npersonal qualities of Garfield have been already mentioned.  After\r\nhis untimely death his enemies became silent.  At this distance of\r\ntime we can properly fix his place in the calendar of those who\r\nhave gone before.  In many respects, Garfield was like Blaine, but\r\nin his personal intercourse with men, and in the power of will, he\r\nwas not the equal of Blaine, while, in style of oratory, in imagery\r\nand expression, he was superior to him.  Both were eminent in their\r\nday and generation.  They were my juniors about eight years, yet\r\nthey lived long enough to permanently stamp their names upon the\r\nhistory of the country.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July General Sherman arrived at Mansfield as my\r\nvisitor.  There was much curiosity to see him, especially by soldiers\r\nwho had served under his command.  I invited them to call at my\r\nhouse.  On the evening of the 21st a large procession of soldiers\r\nand citizens, headed by the American band, marched to my grounds.\r\nThe general and I met them at the portico, when Colonel Fink stepped\r\nforward and made a brief speech, saying:\r\n\r\n\"General Sherman:--We, the old soldiers of the war for the Union,\r\nof Richland county and its surroundings, together with our citizens,\r\nhave come to-day to pay our respects to you.\r\n\r\n\"We come, with feelings of profound regard, to see and welcome you,\r\nour great strategic war chief, and the hero fo the glorious 'March\r\nto the sea.'\r\n\r\n\"We greet you as the general and leader of all the armies of our\r\ncountry; we greet you as the gallant defender of the flag; we greet\r\nyou as the brother of our beloved Senator; we greet you as an Ohio\r\nman, but, above all, we have come to greet and honor you for your\r\nworth; the man that you are.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman replied briefly, and as this is the first speech\r\nI ever heard him make I insert it here.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-Soldiers of the late war and Fellow-Citizens:--It gives me\r\npleasure to meet you here to-night, in this beautiful grove; in\r\nthis inclosure, at my own brother's home.  I am glad to meet you,\r\nhis neighbors and his friends.  The situation is a novel one to\r\nme, and I am deeply moved by it.  As I look over you I do not\r\nrecognize the faces that I used to know, and when riding about your\r\ncity to-day, I only found some of the names I then knew--your\r\nHedges, your Parkers, and your Purdys; for the rest I had to go to\r\nyour cemetery, over yonder, and read their names on the tombstones.\r\nBut you have them still among you in their children and their\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot distinguish to-night who are and who are not soldiers,\r\nbut let me say to you, soldiers, I am very glad to meet you again,\r\nafter so many years, in this time of peace, when yet the recollection\r\nof the hardships of war is a bond of comradeship among us.  We\r\nfought, not for ourselves alone, but for those who are to come\r\nafter us.  The dear old flag we carried through the storms of many\r\nbattles, ready to die, if need be, that it might still wave over\r\nthe government of our fathers.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not the time nor place to recount the events of the\r\npast.  I could not now do the subject justice if I should try.  I\r\nam not accustomed to addressing mixed audiences.  My brother here\r\nknows how to do that better than I, and he understands you better.\r\nBut I want to say to you:  Teach your children to honor the flag,\r\nto respect the laws, and love and understand our institutions, and\r\nour glorious country will be safe with them.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, I heartily appreciate this splendid tribute of your\r\nfriendship and respect.  I thank you.  Good night.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of General Sherman's speech he was cheered\r\nvociferously, after which calls were made for me.  I made a few\r\nremarks and announced that the general would be glad to take them\r\nall by the hand, and as he did so they passed into the dining-room,\r\nwhere refreshments awaited them.  The greetings and hand-shaking\r\nlasted over an hour.  In the meantime the \"soldier boys\" and others\r\nwere enjoying the good cheer within.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July General Sherman, with Colonel Bacon, left for\r\nClyde, Ohio, and I at the same time started for Chicago, there to\r\nbe joined by Justice Strong, late of the Supreme Court, who had\r\nrecently retired at the age of 70, the artist Bierstadt, and Alfred\r\nM. Hoyt, of New York, for a trip to Yellowstone Park.  We had\r\narranged for this trip months before.  Our plan was a simple one,\r\nto go at our convenience by the Union Pacific, the only railroad\r\nroute then open, to Salt Lake City, and thence to Virginia City,\r\nthence through the Yellowstone Park, and by another route to return\r\nto Virginia City, and thence home.  We were to take the usual route\r\nand means of conveyance until we arrived at Virginia City.  From\r\nthere we were to have an escort, to and through the park, of ten\r\nUnited States soldiers from Fort Ellis.\r\n\r\nThe party met at Chicago and proceeded to Ogden and Salt Lake City.\r\nAt the latter place we casually met several gentlemen of our\r\nacquaintance, especially General Harrison, Eli Murray, Governor of\r\nthe Territory of Utah, and General McCook, who commanded the post\r\nin Salt Lake City.  We spent a day or two in visiting the post and\r\ncity, and found a great improvement since my former visit.  In the\r\nevening we were serenaded by a band from the post, and several\r\ngentlemen were called out for speeches by the gathering crowd.  I\r\nhad been met during my stay there by many people who claimed to\r\nhail from Ohio, so that I began to think it was quite an Ohio\r\nsettlement.  In the few remarks I made at the serenade I eulogized\r\nOhio and spoke of the number of Ohio people I had met in that city.\r\nGeneral McCook was called out, and as he was from Ohio he had\r\nsomething to say for that state.  General Harrison was called upon,\r\nand he said that while he lived in Indiana he was born in Ohio and\r\nwas proud of it.  General Murray was next called for and he said\r\nthat while he was born in Kentucky he lived so close to Ohio that\r\nhe could throw a stone into the state.  So much had been said about\r\nOhio that Judge Strong took offense.  They called upon him to\r\naddress the crowd from the balcony, but he would not.  Finally,\r\nupon my urging him to speak, he rushed forward and said:  \"I want\r\nyou to understand distinctly that I am not from Ohio, I was not\r\nborn in Ohio, I never lived in Ohio, and don't want to hear anything\r\nmore about Ohio!\"  This was vociferously cheered, and the old\r\ngentleman closed with very proper remarks about love for the Union\r\ninstead of for the state.\r\n\r\nSince that time I have visited Salt Lake City and have always been\r\nimpressed with the great value of that region, not only for its\r\nmineral wealth, but for the possibility of great agricultural\r\ndevelopment with proper irrigation.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay we bathed in Salt Lake.  The water was so impregnated\r\nwith salt that our bodies floated upon the surface and there was\r\nno danger of drowning.  The history of Salt Lake City, which owes\r\nits existence and wonderful development and prosperity to Brigham\r\nyoung, is like an improbable romance.  I have already mentioned\r\nYoung, having met him on my former visit with Thomas A. Scott.  In\r\nthe nine years that had elapsed the city had nearly doubled its\r\npopulation.  Pure water was flowing in all the streets and the city\r\nlooked fresh and clean.  The air, at an elevation of 4,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, was exhilarating.  From Salt Lake City we returned\r\nto Ogden, and on, or about, the 1st of August took passage on the\r\nUtah Northern railroad.  Our route lay along the Beaver River,\r\npassing Eagle Rock, thence through Beaver Cañon into Idaho, thence\r\nthrough a mountainous range, at about an elevation of 6,800 feet,\r\ninto Montana as far as the frontier town of Dillon.  There we left\r\nthe cars and took wagons to Virginia City, Montana, where we were\r\nto meet our military escort and arrange for horses and mules to\r\ncarry us and our camp outfit into the park.\r\n\r\nOur drive from Dillon to Virginia City was very picturesque, skirting\r\nthe Ruby mountains and crossing the Stinking Water River.  Virginia\r\nCity was at one time the center and thriving business place of the\r\nlarge population that was drawn to that valley by the very rich\r\nplacer gold mines there, discovered between 1865 and 1870.  It is\r\nestimated that $90,000,000 of gold was taken from that stream that\r\nruns through a valley about eighteen miles long.  The city had many\r\nsubstantial buildings, a large brick courthouse, five churches,\r\nmany large business stores, dwellings and hotels.  At the time we\r\nwere there the placer mining had been abandoned, except by some\r\nChinamen who were washing over the tailings and making good wages\r\nat it; and the population had been reduced from 20,000 people to\r\n1,400.  Here we spent Sunday.  It was a gala day for the saloons,\r\nranchmen and cowboys, typical of how Sunday is observed in all\r\nthese mining and ranch towns.  We met here, as everywhere in Montana,\r\nwandering gold-seekers who explored from mountain to valley in\r\nsearch of the precious metal, often making exaggerated statements\r\nin regard to the undeveloped wealth not yet discovered, with stories\r\nabout gold which were never realized.  It was the common belief\r\nthat the gold found in the placer mines must have been washed from\r\nthe mountains near by, and seekers for gold were looking for the\r\nsource of the gold field in such mountains, but it was never\r\ndiscovered.  Mines were discovered in other parts of Montana, but\r\nnone about Virginia City.\r\n\r\nOn Monday we met Lieutenant Swigert with a dozen troopers from Fort\r\nEllis, who, by orders from the war department, were to escort us\r\nthrough Yellowstone Park.  Here we obtained horses and mules for\r\nour own use and for carrying our packs, camp traps, etc.  When all\r\nwas ready we started for our camping in the wilderness.  Our first\r\nday's march was about twenty miles, when we went into camp.  We\r\nproceeded each day about this same rate, following along the valley\r\nof the Madison River until we reached the park.  When we were there\r\nthe park was truly a wilderness, with no evidences of civilization.\r\nGame was very abundant.  Elk, deer, antelope and bear were plentiful,\r\nand we had no difficulty in getting all the fresh meat we wanted.\r\n\r\nAmong our employees was a man by the name of Beam, a typical hunter.\r\nHe had spent most of his life in the mountains.  He started out\r\nevery morning in advance of us and was always sure to be at the\r\nagreed camping ground when he arrived.  I asked him at one time if\r\nhe was not afraid of being lost.  He said no, he could not be lost\r\nfor he could go to the top of any hill or mountain and determine\r\nhis course.  He said he had never been lost but once, and that was\r\nin St. Louis; when he went out from the hotel he was in a \"cañon\"\r\nand he could not tell which way to go.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in the lower geyser basin on Saturday.  The next day\r\n(Sunday) was bright and beautiful.  We knew that our revered\r\ncompanion, Justice Strong, was a religious man and we felt that he\r\nwould have scruples about traveling on Sunday.  Still, we wished\r\nto move on that afternoon to the upper geyser basin, but were at\r\na loss how to approach him with the Sunday question.  It was left\r\nto me to confer with him.  Before doing so I arranged to have\r\neverything in order for a proper observance of the Sabbath day.\r\nI found after inquiry that there was no Bible in the large party,\r\nbut that the officer in command of the troops had an Episcopal\r\nprayer book.  I went with that to Justice Strong and suggested that\r\nwe should have religious services, to which he readily assented.\r\nI gave him the prayer book and he carefully marked out a selection\r\nof scripture and prayers, saying that he was not familiar with the\r\nbook, but it contained ample material for a proper religious service.\r\nWe gathered all the soldiers, wagoners and cowboys, including the\r\nhunter, belonging to our party.  Justice Strong was furnished a\r\nbox to sit on in front of his tent, and the rest of us stood or\r\nlay in scattered groups on the ground around him.  He read from\r\nthe prayer book the passages he had selected, making together a\r\nmost impressive and interesting service.  Many of those who gathered\r\naround him had not shared in religious services for years, and were\r\nduly impressed with them.  After this was over and we had taken\r\ndinner, I suggested to him that there were so many horses that the\r\nteamsters complained that the grass was not sufficient for them to\r\nremain there all day, and that I thought it would be well for us\r\nto move to the upper geyser basin a few miles away, to which he at\r\nonce assented.  I throughly sympathized with his feelings in this\r\nmatter, but thought that under the circumstances our action was\r\nexcusable and he doubtless saw through the scheme.\r\n\r\nDuring our visit to the geysers in the upper basin, we encamped\r\nnear \"Old Faithful.\"  From this camp we could reach, by an easy\r\nwalk, nearly all the grand geysers of this wonderful basin.  I have\r\nsometimes undertaken to describe these geysers, but never could\r\nconvey my idea of their grandeur.  Bierstadt made a sketch of \"Old\r\nFaithful,\" showing Mr. Hoyt and myself in the foreground, with the\r\ngeyser in full action.  He subsequently expanded this picture into\r\na painting, which I now own and greatly prize.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our march, passing by Sulphur Mountain, the Devil's\r\nCaldron, mud geysers, the \"paint pots,\" and through this marvelous\r\nland, to the shores of Yellowstone Lake.  We were amazed at the\r\nbeautiful scenery that stretched before us.  This large lake is in\r\nthe midst of snow-clad mountains; its only supply of water is from\r\nthe melting snows and ice that feed the upper Yellowstone River.\r\nIts elevation is 7,741 feet above the sea.  The ranges and peaks\r\nof snow-clad mountains surrounding the lake, the silence and majesty\r\nof the scene, were awe-inspiring--the only life apparent being the\r\nflocks of pelicans.  We fished successfully in this mountain lake,\r\nbut of the fishes caught many were spoiled by worms that had eaten\r\ninto and remained in them.\r\n\r\nWe visited the great falls of the Yellowstone, the immense and\r\nwonderful cañon so often described and illustrated.  We remained\r\nencamped near this cañon a whole day, and amused ourselves chiefly\r\nin exploring its wonderful depths and in rolling stones from\r\nprojecting points down into the valley.  They generally bounded\r\nfrom point to point until we could hear them dashing into the waters\r\nfar below.\r\n\r\nOur march down the valley of the Yellowstone was very interesting.\r\nThe military escort and Justice Strong did not pass over Mount\r\nWashburn, but went by a nearer and easier route along the valley\r\nto the next camping ground.  Bierstadt, Hoyt and I, with a guide,\r\nrode on horseback to the top of Mount Washburn, a long, difficult\r\nand somewhat dangerous feat, but we were amply repaid by the splendid\r\nview before us.  We crossed the mountain at an elevation of 12,000\r\nfeet, in the region of perpetual snow.  From its summit one of the\r\ngrandest and most extensive views of mountain scenery lay before\r\nand around us, range after range of snowpeaks stretching away for\r\none hundred miles.  To the south was the valley of Wind River and\r\nStinking Water, and encircling these, the Shoshone and Wind River\r\nranges with their lines of perpetual snow, the Bear Tooth Mountain\r\nand Pilot Knob and Index Peak, the great landmarks of the Rockies.\r\nThe ascent was fatiguing and almost exhausting.  We remained on\r\nthe mountain two or three hours for needed rest.  When we arrived\r\nin the camp about sundown I was so fatigued that I was utterly\r\nunable to dismount from my horse, and was lifted bodily from it by\r\nthe soldiers.\r\n\r\nWe continued our journey through grassy parks until we reached\r\nLower Falls.  From there we continued until we arrived at Mammoth\r\nHot Springs, where there was a house, the first sign of civilization\r\nwe had seen since we began our journeyings in the park.  From here\r\nwe took our way to Fort Ellis and Bozeman, where we left our escort\r\nand horses and mules.  We returned from here to Virginia City, and\r\nat Dillon took cars for Ogden and thence for home, where I arrived\r\nabout the 25th of August.\r\n\r\nDuring my absence in the Yellowstone Park we had frequent bulletins\r\nin respect to President Garfield, sometimes hopeful but generally\r\ndespondent.  When I returned it was generally supposed that he\r\ncould not recover, but might linger for weeks or months.  The public\r\nsympathy excited for him suspended by common consent all political\r\nmeetings.  As the Ohio election was to occur on the second Tuesday\r\nof October, George K. Nash, chairman of the Republican state\r\ncommittee, having charge of the canvass, made a number of appointments\r\nfor several gentlemen during September.  Among them was one for me\r\nto speak in Mansfield, on the 17th of that month, in aid of the\r\nelection of Foster and the Republican ticket.  Preparations were\r\nmade and the meeting was actually convened on the afternoon of that\r\nday, but, as the bulletins from Elberton indicated that Garfield\r\nmight die at any moment, I declined to speak.  More favorable\r\nadvices coming, however, I was urged by the committee to speak to\r\nWooster on Monday evening, September 19, and consented with some\r\nhesitation.  In opening my speech I referred to the condition of\r\nthe President and my reluctance to speak; I said:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-Citizens:--I am requested by the Republican state committee\r\nto make a political speech to you to-night, in opening here the\r\nusual discussion that precedes the election of a governor and other\r\nstate officers.  If I felt at liberty to be guided by my own\r\nfeelings, I would, in view of the present condition of the President\r\nof the United States, forego all political discussion at this time.\r\n\r\n\"The President is the victim of a crime committed without excuse\r\nor palliation, in a time of profound peace and prosperity, not\r\naimed at him as an individual, but at him as the President of the\r\nUnited States.  It was a political crime, made with the view of\r\nchanging, by assassination, the President chosen by you.  It has\r\nexcited, throughout the civilized world, the most profound horror.\r\nThe President has suffered for more than two months, and is still\r\nsuffering, from wounds inflicted by an assassin.  His life still\r\nhangs by a thread.  The anxious inquiry comes up morning, noon and\r\nnight, from a whole people, with fervid, earnest prayers for his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n\"Under the shadow of this misfortune, I do not feel like speaking,\r\nand I know you do not feel like hearing a political wrangle.  It\r\nis but just to say that the members of all parties, with scarce an\r\nexception, Democrats as well as Republicans, share in sympathy with\r\nthe President and his family, and in detestation of the crime and\r\nthe criminal, and the evidence of this sympathy tends to make\r\npolitical dispute irksome and out of place.\"\r\n\r\nI then entered into a general discussion of the issues of the\r\ncampaign.  Soon after the close of my speech I received intelligence\r\nof the death of Garfield, and at once revoked all my appointments,\r\nand by common consent both parties withdrew their meetings.  Thus\r\nmine was the only speech made in the campaign.  I immediately went\r\nto Washington with ex-President Hayes to attend the funeral, and\r\naccompanied the committee to the burial at Cleveland.  The sympathy\r\nfor Garfield in his sad fate was universal and sincere.  The\r\ninauguration of President Arthur immediately followed, and with it\r\nan entire change of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nBEGINNING OF ARTHUR'S ADMINISTRATION.\r\nSpecial Session of the Senate Convened by the President--Abuse of\r\nMe by Newspapers and Discharged Employees--Charges Concerning\r\nDisbursement of the Contingent Fund--My Resolution in the Senate--\r\nSecretary Windom's Letter Accompanying the Meline Report--Investigation\r\nand Complete Exoneration--Arthur's Message to Congress in December\r\n--Joint Resolutions on the Death of Garfield--Blaine's Tribute to\r\nHis Former Chief--Credit of the United States at \"High Water Mark\"\r\n--Bill Introduced Providing for the Issuing of Three per Cent.\r\nBonds--Corporate Existence of National Banks Extended--Bill to\r\nReduce Internal Revenue Taxes--Tax on Playing Cards--Democratic\r\nVictory in Ohio.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of September, 1881, President Arthur convened the Senate\r\nto meet in special session on the 10th of October.  Mr. Bayard was\r\nelected its president _pro tempore_.  On the 13th of October, when\r\nthe Senate was full, David Davis, of Illinois, was elected president\r\n_pro tempore_, and the usual thanks were given to Mr. Bayard, as\r\nthe retiring president _pro tempore_, for the dignity and impartiality\r\nwith which he had discharged the duties of his office.\r\n\r\nAt this period of my life I was the object of more abuse and\r\nvituperation than ever before or since.  The fact that the new\r\nadministration of Arthur was not friendly to me was no doubt the\r\npartial cause of this abuse.  The intense bitterness manifested by\r\ncertain papers, and by discharged employees, indicated the origin\r\nof most of the petty charges against me.  One of these employees\r\nstated that he had been detailed for work on a house built by me\r\nin 1880.  This was easily answered by the fact that the house was\r\nbuilt under contract with a leading builder and the cost was paid\r\nto him.  I neither knew the man nor ever heard of him since.\r\n\r\nI was blamed for certain irregularities in the disbursement of the\r\ncontingent fund of the treasury, although the accounts of that fund\r\nwere by law approved by the chief clerk of the department and were\r\nsettled by the accounting officers without ever coming under my\r\nsupervision, and the disbursement had been made by a custodian who\r\nwas in the department before I entered it.  My wife was more annoyed\r\nthan I with the petty charges which she knew were false, but which\r\nI did not dignify by denying.\r\n\r\nMr. Windom, soon after his appointment as secretary, directed an\r\ninquiry to be made by officers of the treasury department into\r\nthese abuses and it was charged that he, at my request, had suppressed\r\nthis inquiry.  The \"Commercial Advertiser,\" on the 11th of October,\r\nalleged that I was as much shocked by the disclosures as my successor,\r\nMr. Windom; that I did not want any further publicity given to\r\nthem, and was desirous that Mr. Windom should not allow the report\r\nto get into the public prints.  I, therefore, on the 14th of October,\r\noffered in the Senate this resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed\r\nto transmit to the Senate a copy of the report of James F. Meline\r\nand others, made to the treasury department during the recess of\r\nthe Senate, and of any papers received by him based upon such\r\nreport.\"\r\n\r\nIn offering the resolution, after reading the article in the\r\n\"Commercial Advertiser,\" I said:\r\n\r\n\"The writer of this paragraph is very much mistaken in supposing\r\nthat I have in any way sought or wished to withhold from the public\r\nthe report referred to.  I neither have nor will I oppose or delay\r\nany investigation of the treasury department while I was its chief\r\nofficer.  The only wish I have is to see that every officer accused\r\nof improper conduct shall have a fair chance to defend himself,\r\nand then he must stand or fall according to the rectitude or wrong\r\nof his conduct.\r\n\r\n\"The only doubt I have in calling for this report now is the fact\r\nthat Mr. Windom did not order its publication lest injustice might\r\nbe done to worthy and faithful officers who had no opportunity to\r\ncross-examine witnesses or answer charges made against them.  I\r\nhave no doubt that he either has given or will give them this\r\nopportunity.  At all events the Senate can do so.  I, therefore,\r\noffer this resolution and hope the Senate will promptly pass it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edmunds objected to the resolution as being unnecessary, and\r\nunder the rules of the Senate it went over.  I called it up on the\r\n18th of October, when Mr. Farley, of California, asked that it be\r\npostponed a few days.  On the 22nd I again called it up, when Mr.\r\nFarley stated that he could not see what Congress had to do with\r\nthe report of such a commission appointed by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and asked me for an explanation.  In reply I said:\r\n\r\n\"I stated, on introducing this resolution, that the investigation\r\nwas one of a character not usually communicated to Congress, but\r\nthat certain public prints had contained unfounded imputations\r\nagainst several officers of the government, and that there was\r\nsomething in the report which reflected on a Member of this body\r\nformerly a cabinet officer.  Under the circumstances, as I was\r\nplainly the person referred to, having been Secretary of the Treasury\r\nat the time stated, I deemed it my right, as well as my duty to my\r\nfellow-Senators, to call out this information.  If the statements\r\ncontained in the papers be true, they are proper matters for the\r\nSenate to examine in every sense.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, I have been accustomed to newspaper abuse all my\r\nlife and very rarely notice it.  This is probably the first time\r\nin my political life that I have ever read to this body a newspaper\r\nattack upon me or upon anyone else; but when any paper or any man\r\nimpugns in the slightest degree my official integrity I intend to\r\nhave it investigated, and I wish it tested not only by the law but\r\nby the strictest rules of personal honor.\r\n\r\n\"For this reason, when this imputation is made by a leading and\r\nprominent paper, that there is on the files of the treasury department\r\na document which reflects upon me, I think it right that it should\r\nbe published to the world, and then the Senate can investigate it\r\nwith the power to send for persons and papers.  That is the only\r\nreason why I offered the resolution, and not so much in my own\r\ndefense as in defense of those accused in this document.  If the\r\naccusation is true it is the duty of the Senate to examine into\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some further discussion the resolution was adopted, and on\r\nthe same day Mr. Windom transmitted the report of James F. Meline,\r\nand other officers of the treasury department, made to the department\r\nduring the recess of the Senate.  His letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Treasury Department, Office of the Secretary,}\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., October 22, 1881.         }\r\n\"Sir:--I am in receipt of the resolution of the Senate of the 21st\r\ninstant, as follows:\r\n\r\n'_Resolved_, That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed\r\nto transmit to the Senate a copy of the report of James F. Meline\r\nand others, made to the treasury department during the recess of\r\nthe Senate, and of any papers received by him based upon such\r\nreport.'\r\n\r\n\"In reply thereto I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of\r\nthe report called for, with the accompanying statements of Mr. J.\r\nK. Upton and J. T. Power, who occupied the position of chief clerk\r\nand _ex officio_ superintendent of the treasury building for the\r\nperiod covered by the report.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after assuming the duties of Secretary of the Treasury my\r\nattention was called to alleged abuses in the disbursement of the\r\ncontingent fund of the department, which was under the immediate\r\ncharge of a custodian, and the general supervision of the chief\r\nclerk of the department, and I appointed a committee to look into\r\nthe matter, as has been the custom of the department in such cases.\r\nThe law, somewhat conflicting in its terms in relation to the\r\nrelative duties of these two officers, will be found fully set\r\nforth in the report.  On considering this report I am convinced\r\nthat certain irregularities and abuses existed in this branch of\r\nthe service, and as I had some doubts as to the legality of the\r\nappointment of a custodian I abolished that office June 18, 1881,\r\nand by general order of July 1, 1881, reorganized the office.\r\n\r\n\"A copy of this order is herewith transmitted, from which it will\r\nappear that all the changes necessary to a complete and thorough\r\ncorrection of the irregularities and abuses referred to have been\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\"It was my intention, as my more pressing public duties would\r\npermit, to have pursued this general policy in other branches of\r\nthe treasury, by the appointment of competent committees to collect\r\nthe necessary data on which to base proper action to secure economy\r\nand promote the best interests of the public service, but the\r\nassassination of the President suspended further action in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully,\r\n  \"William Windom, Secretary.\r\n\"Hon. David Davis, President of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th I offered a resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the committee on appropriations of the Senate\r\nbe, and they are hereby, authorized and directed to investigate\r\nthe accounts for the expenditure of the appropriations for contingent\r\nor other expenses of the several executive departments, including\r\nthe methods of making such disbursements, the character and\r\ndisposition of the purchases made, and the employment of labor paid\r\nfrom such appropriations, and to report on the subject at as early\r\na day as practicable, and whether any further legislation is\r\nnecessary to secure the proper disbursement of such appropriations;\r\nand that the committee have leave to send for persons and papers,\r\nand have leave to sit during the recess of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThis led to a thorough investigation into the disbursement of the\r\ncontingent fund of the treasury department, the report of which,\r\naccompanied by the testimony, covering over 1,200 printed pages,\r\nwas submitted to the Senate on the 15th of March, 1882.  This\r\nexamination was chiefly conducted by Francis M. Cockrell, of\r\nMissouri, a Senator distinguished for his fairness and thoroughness.\r\nThe report was concurred in unanimously by the committee on\r\nappropriations.  It showed that certain irregularities had entered\r\ninto the management of the fund and that certain improper entries\r\nhad been made in the account, but that only a trifling loss had\r\nresulted to the government therefrom.\r\n\r\nI was before the committee and stated that I never had any knowledge\r\nof any wrongdoing in the matter until it had been brought out by\r\nthe investigation.  The report fairly and fully relieved me from\r\nthe false accusations made against me.  It said:  \"Touching the\r\nstatements of Senator Sherman, that he had no knowledge of its\r\nirregularities, etc., established by the evidence, no witness states\r\nthat Mr. Sherman knew that any funds of the treasury department\r\nwere ever used for his individual benefit or otherwise misapplied.\"\r\n\r\nI could not have asked for a more favorable ending of the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the examination the committee addressed to the head\r\nof each department of Arthur's administration an inquiry whether\r\nthe laws then in force provided ample safeguards for the faithful\r\nexpenditure of its contingent appropriation, and each of them\r\nreplied that no change in existing law was necessary.  The committee\r\nconcurred in the views of the heads of the departments, and suggested\r\nthat they keep a constant supervision over the acts of their\r\nsubordinates; that the storekeeper of the treasury department should\r\nbe required to give a bond, and that careful inventories of the\r\nproperty of each department should be made, and that annual reports\r\nof the expenditures from the contingent fund should be made by each\r\ndepartment at the commencement of each regular session.  While this\r\ninvestigation imposed a severe labor upon the committee on\r\nappropriations, it had a beneficial effect in securing a more\r\ncareful control over the contingent expenses of the departments,\r\nand it silenced the imputations and innuendoes aimed at me.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these accusations, I no doubt exhibited more resentment\r\nand gave them more importance than they deserved.  I felt that, as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, I had rendered the country valuable\r\nservice, that I had dealt with vast sums without receiving the\r\nslightest benefit, and at the close was humiliated by charges of\r\npetty larceny.  If I had recalled the experience of Washington,\r\nHamilton, Jefferson, Jackson and Blaine, and many others, under\r\nlike accusations, I would have been content with answering as\r\nWashington and Jackson did, or by silent indifference, but my\r\ntemperament led me to defy and combat with my accusers, however\r\nformidable or insignificant they might be.\r\n\r\nThe annual message of President Arthur, submitted to Congress on\r\nthe 6th of December, was a creditable, businesslike statement of\r\nthe condition of the government.  It commenced with a very proper\r\nannouncement of the appalling calamity which had fallen upon the\r\nAmerican people by the untimely death of President Garfield.  He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The memory of his exalted character, of his noble achievements,\r\nand of his patriotic life, will be treasured forever as a sacred\r\npossession of the whole people.\r\n\r\n\"The announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and\r\npeoples tributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will record\r\nas signal tokens of the kinship of nations and the federation of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nOur friendly relations with foreign nations were fully described,\r\nand the operations of the different departments of the government\r\nduring the past year were clearly and emphatically stated.  In\r\nclosing he called attention to the second article of the constitution,\r\nin the fifth clause of its first section, that \"in case of the\r\nremoval of the President from office, or of his death, resignation,\r\nor inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office,\r\nthe same shall devolve on the Vice President,\" and asked that\r\nCongress should define \"what is the intendment of the constitution\r\nin its specification of 'inability to discharge the powers and\r\nduties of said office,' as one of the contingencies which calls\r\nfor the Vice President to the exercise of presidential functions?\r\nIs the inability limited in its nature to long continued intellectual\r\nincapacity, or has it a broader import?  What must be its extent\r\nand duration?  How must its existence be established?\"\r\n\r\nThese and other questions connected with the subject were not acted\r\nupon by Congress, as it could not foresee the conditions of the\r\ninabilities in advance of their occurrence.  He closed with the\r\nfollowing sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Deeply impressed with the gravity of the responsibilities which\r\nhave so unexpectedly devolved upon me, it will be my constant\r\npurpose to co-operate with you in such measures as will promote\r\nthe glory of the country and the prosperity of its people.\"\r\n\r\nAt the regular meeting of the House of Representatives, on the 5th\r\nof December, 1881, J. Warren Keifer was elected speaker by a small\r\nmajority.  Both Houses were almost equally divided on partisan\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session, on the motion of William McKinley, the House\r\npassed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a committee of one Member from each state\r\nrepresented in this House be appointed on the part of the House to\r\njoin such committee as may be appointed on the part of the Senate,\r\nto consider and report by what token of respect and affection it\r\nmay be proper for the Congress of the United States to express the\r\ndeep sensibility of the nation to the event of the decease of their\r\nlate President, James Abram Garfield; and that so much of the\r\nmessage of the President as refers to that melancholy event be\r\nreferred to said committee.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, on my motion, a similar resolution, limiting the\r\ncommittee to eight, passed the Senate.  The committees were duly\r\nappointed.  On the 21st of December the two Houses, upon the report\r\nof the two committees, adopted the following concurrent preamble\r\nand resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, The melancholy event of the violent and tragic death of\r\nJames Abram Garfield, late President of the United States, having\r\noccurred during the recess of Congress, and the two Houses sharing\r\nin the general grief and desiring to manifest their sensibility\r\nupon the occasion of the public bereavement:  Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Be it resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate\r\nconcurring)_, That the two Houses of Congress will assemble in the\r\nhall of the House of Representatives on a day and hour to be fixed\r\nand announced by the joint committee, and that in the presence of\r\nthe two Houses there assembled an address upon the life and character\r\nof James Abram Garfield, late President of the United States, be\r\npronounced by Hon. James G. Blaine; and that the president of the\r\nSenate _pro tempore_ and the speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nbe requested to invite the President and ex-Presidents, of the\r\nUnited States, the heads of the several departments, the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, the representatives of the foreign governments\r\nnear this government, the governors of the several states, the\r\ngeneral of the army and the admiral of the navy, and such officers\r\nof the army and have as have received the thanks of Congress who\r\nmay then be at the seat of government, to be present on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\"_And be it further resolved_, That the President of the United\r\nStates be requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions to Mrs.\r\nLucretia R. Garfield, and to assure her of the profound sympathy\r\nof the two Houses of Congress for her deep personal affliction and\r\nof their sincere condolence for the late national bereavement.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February, 1882, Mr. Blaine, in response to the\r\nresolution of the two Houses, delivered an address, in the hall of\r\nHouse of Representatives, on the life and character of President\r\nGarfield, worthy of the occasion, of the distinguished audience\r\nbefore him, and of his reputation as an orator.  From the beginning\r\nto the end it was elevated in tone, eloquent in the highest sense\r\nof that word, and warm in expression of his affection for the friend\r\nhe eulogized.  His delineation of Garfield as a soldier, an orator,\r\nand a man, in all the relations of life, was without exaggeration,\r\nbut was tinged with his personal friendship and love.  He described\r\nhim on the 2nd of July, the morning of his wounding, as a contented\r\nand happy man, not in an ordinary degree, but joyfully, almost\r\nboyishly, happy.  \"Great in life, he was surpassingly great in\r\ndeath.\"  He pictured the long lingering illness that followed that\r\nfatal wound, the patience of the sufferer, the unfaltering front\r\nwith which he faced death, and his simple resignation to the divine\r\ndecree.  His peroration rose to the full measure of highest oratory.\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As the end drew near, his early craving for the sea returned.\r\nThe stately mansion of power had been to him the wearisome hospital\r\nof pain, and he begged to be taken from its prison walls, from its\r\noppressive, stifling air, from its homelessness and its hopelessness.\r\nGently, silently, the love of a great people bore the pale sufferer\r\nto the longer-for healing of the sea, to live or to die, as God\r\nshould will, within sight of its heaving billows, within sound of\r\nits manifold voices.  With wan, fevered face tenderly lifted to\r\nthe cooling breeze, he looked out wistfully upon the ocean's changing\r\nwonders; on its far sails, whitening in the morning light; on its\r\nrestless waves, rolling shoreward to break and die beneath the\r\nnoonday sun; on the red clouds of evening, arching low to the\r\nhorizon; on the serene and shining pathway of the stars.  Let us\r\nthink that his dying eyes read a mystic meaning which only the rapt\r\nand parting soul may know.  Let us believe that in the silence of\r\nthe receding world he heard the great waves breaking on a further\r\nshore, and felt already upon his wasted brow the breath of the\r\neternal morning.\"\r\n\r\nBlaine died January 27, 1893.  Who now living could pronounce such\r\na eulogy?\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions were adopted by both Houses of Congress:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved (the Senate concurring)_, That the thanks of Congress\r\nbe presented to the Hon. James G. Blaine, for the appropriate\r\nmemorial address delivered by him on the life and services of James\r\nAbram Garfield, late President of the United States, in the\r\nRepresentatives' Hall, before both Houses of Congress and their\r\ninvited guests, on the 27th day of February, 1882; and that he be\r\nrequested to furnish a copy for publication.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the chairman of the joint committee appointed to\r\nmake the necessary arrangements to carry into effect the resolutions\r\nof this Congress, in relation to the memorial exercises in honor\r\nof James Abram Garfield, be requested to communicate to Mr. Blaine\r\nthe foregoing resolution, receive his answer thereto, and present\r\nthe same to both Houses of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the commencement of this session the credit of the\r\nUnited States had reached high-water mark.  It was apparent that,\r\nwith judicious management, a three per cent. bond of the United\r\nStates could be sold at par.  On the first day of the session,\r\nDecember 5, 1881, I introduced a bill to provide for the issue of\r\nthree per cent. bonds.  It was referred to the committee on finance,\r\nand on the 15th of December, by direction of that committee, I\r\nreported the bill with certain amendments, and gave notice that I\r\nwas directed to seek the action of the Senate upon it immediately\r\nafter the holidays.  It was taken up for consideration on the 11th\r\nof January, and, much to my surprise, met with opposition from\r\nthose who a year before had favored a similar bill.  They said it\r\nwas a mere expedient on my part, that President Hayes had, at my\r\nrequest, vetoed a similar bill; but I was able to truly answer that\r\nthe veto of President Hayes was not against the three per cent.\r\nbond, but against the compulsory provision that no other than three\r\nper cent. bonds should be deposited in the treasury as security\r\nfor the circulating notes of, and deposits with, national banks;\r\nthat President Hayes, in fact, approved of the three per cent. bond.\r\n\r\nI made a speech in support of this measure on the 26th of January,\r\nreviewing our financial condition, with many details in respect to\r\nour different loans, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I say now, as I said at the commencement, that the passage of this\r\nbill seems to me a matter of public duty.  I care nothing for it\r\npersonally.  I have been taunted with my inconsistency.  I feel\r\nlike the Senator from Kentucky about an argument of that kind.  If\r\nI did not sometimes change my mind I should consider myself a\r\nblockhead or a fool.  But in this matter, fortunately, I have not\r\nchanged my mind.  In 1866 I anticipated the time when we could sell\r\nthree per cent. bonds and said that was a part of the funding\r\nscheme, and so continued, year in and year out, as I could show\r\nSenators, that that was the _ultima thule_, the highest point of\r\ncredit to which I looked in these refunding operations.  I believed\r\nlast year it could not be done, because I did not believe the state\r\nof the money market would justify the attempt, and, besides that,\r\nthe great mass of the indebtedness was so large that it might\r\nprevent the sale of three per cent. bonds at par.  Therefore, I\r\nwanted a three and a half per cent. bill then.  But then we secured\r\nthe three and a half in spite of Congress, by the operations of\r\nthe treasury department and the consent of the bondholders, now we\r\nought to do a little better.\r\n\r\n\"Let Congress do now what it proposed to do last year, offer to\r\nthe people a three per cent. bond.  If they do not take it no harm\r\nis done, no expense is incurred, no commissions are paid, no\r\nadvantage is taken.  If they do take it, they enable you to pay\r\noff more rapidly still your three and a half per cent. bonds.\r\nThere was no express and no implied obligation made by the Senator\r\nfrom Minnesota, as he will himself say, that the people of the United\r\nStates have the right to pay every dollar of these three and a half\r\nper cent. bonds.  He had no power to make such an intimation even,\r\nnor has he made it, as he states himself.  We are not restrained\r\nby any sense of duty, we have the right to take advantage of our\r\nimproved credit, of our advanced credit, and make the best bargain\r\nwe can for the people of the United States, and the doctrine is\r\nnot 'let well enough alone,' but always to advance.\r\n\r\n\"We are advancing in credit, in population, in strength, in power,\r\nin reason.  The work of to-day is not the work of to-morrow; it is\r\nbut the preparation for the future.  And, sir, if I had my way in\r\nregard to these matters I certainly would repeal taxes; I would\r\nfortify ourselves in Congress by reducing this large surplus revenue;\r\nI would regulate, by wise and separate laws, fully and fairly\r\nconsidered, all the subjects embraced in these amendments as separate\r\nand distinct measures, pass this bill which, to the extent it goes\r\nand to the extent it is successful, will be beneficial to the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the bill and upon amendments to it continued until\r\nthe 3rd of February, when it passed the Senate by the decided vote\r\nof 38 yeas, 18 nays.\r\n\r\nThe bill was referred to the committee of ways and means, but the\r\nHouse, instead of passing a separate bill, accomplished the same\r\nobject by section 11 of the national bank act of July 12, 1882, by\r\nwhich the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to receive at\r\nthe treasury any bonds of the United States bearing three and a\r\nhalf per cent. interest, and to issue in exchange therefor an equal\r\namount of registered bonds of the United States bearing interest\r\nat the rate of three per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nMr. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury, in his annual report of\r\nDecember 4, 1882, stated that on July 1, 1882, the amount of three\r\nand a half per cent. bonds outstanding was $449,324,000, and that\r\nunder the section referred to he had exchanged to the date of his\r\nreport $280,394,750 of three per cent. bonds for a like amount of\r\nthree and a half per cent. bonds, thus reducing the annual interest\r\ncharge by reason of these exchanges $1,401,973.75.\r\n\r\nBy his report of 1883, it was shown that the total amount of such\r\nexchanges was $305,581,250, making an annual saving of interest,\r\neffected by these exchanges, of $1,527,906.25.  These bonds were\r\nsubsequently paid from time to time by surplus revenue.\r\n\r\nThe whole process of refunding was perhaps as favorable a financial\r\ntransaction as has ever been executed in any country in the world.\r\n\r\nA revision of the tariff was greatly needed, but the only measure\r\nadopted at that session was an act to provide for the appointment\r\nof a commission to investigate the question of the tariff.  I made\r\na speech on this bill in which I advocated the appointment of a\r\ncommission.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, I have called attention to these defects in the\r\npresent tariff, nearly all of which have grown out of amendments\r\nthat have been ingrafted on the Morrill tariff, by the confusion\r\ncaused by the difference between _ad valorem_ and specific duties,\r\nby the great fall in prices, by important changes in the mode of\r\nmanufacturing, by, you may say, the revolution in trade and prices\r\nthat has occurred in the last twenty years, during which these laws\r\nhave existed.  Therefore, coming back to the first question stated\r\nby me, how best to get at a revision of the tariff, I say the\r\nquickest way is the best way.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Now, it does seem to me, with due deference to the opinion of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky, that the quickest mode of revision is by a\r\ncommission.  At the beginning of this session I believed it was\r\nbetter to do it through the committees of the two Houses; but the\r\ncommittee on ways and means of the House of Representatives alone\r\nhas the power to report a bill, and until then we in the Senate\r\nare as helpless as children in this matter.  The committee on ways\r\nand means have declared in favor of a commission, and have reported\r\na bill to that effect; and they are the only power in this government\r\nthat can report a tariff bill under the rules of the House.  The\r\nHouse is the only body that can originate it under the constitution.\r\nAs they have decided in favor of a commission, why should we insist\r\nupon it that they shall do the work themselves?\r\n\r\n\"Besides, half the session has passed away, and the committee on\r\nways and means is burdened with other duties.  We know that as the\r\nsession approaches an end, they probably cannot devote time to the\r\ngeneral tariff question.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"If they will give us a bill about sugar and these other items, it\r\nis all we can reasonably ask them to do.  When Congress adjourns,\r\nyou cannot expect the committee on ways and means, or any other\r\ncommittee of Congress, to devote all their recess to public business.\r\nElections are coming off for Members of Congress, and they will\r\nlook after the elections.  They must have a little rest.  Therefore,\r\nthe idea of waiting for the committees of Congress to act, is\r\npreposterous in my judgment.  It is too late.  If the committee\r\nhad commenced on the first Monday of December, they might by this\r\ntime probably had prepared a bill.  They have made no such preparation,\r\nand, therefore, it is utterly idle to wait.\r\n\r\n\"I think, then, and I submit it to the good, cool sense and judgment\r\nof my friend from Kentucky, that the better way is as early as\r\npossible to organize a commission; let it be constituted, as I have\r\nno doubt the President will take care to constitute it, of fair\r\nand impartial men.  They will be fresh at least.  Let them frame\r\na bill with the aid of officers of the treasury department, so that\r\nby the next session we may have a general revision of the tariff.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the main question there appears to be no substantial difference\r\nof opinion.  We agree that the tariff should be revised and the\r\ntaxes be reduced.  The only pertinent question involved in this\r\nbill is whether it is best to organize a commission of experts, not\r\nMembers of Congress, to examine the whole subject and to report\r\nsuch facts and information to Congress as the commission can gather,\r\nor whether the proposed revision should be made directly, without\r\nthe delay of a commission, by the aid of committees of Congress\r\nand the officers of the government familiar with the workings of\r\nthe customs laws.  It does seem to me that to decide this question\r\nwe need no long arguments about protection or free trade, watchwords\r\nof opposing schools of political economy, nor does it seem to me\r\nthat the political bearings of the tariff question are involved\r\nwhen we all agree that the tariff ought to be revised, and are now\r\nonly finding out the best way to get at it.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever a tariff bill is reported to us we will have full time\r\nto discuss the theoretical and political aspects of the subject,\r\nand no doubt the arguments already made will be repeated and\r\namplified.  I prophesy that then we will have a strange mingling\r\nof political elements, and a striking evidence of the changes of\r\ninterest and principle on this subject in different parts of the\r\ncountry, caused by the revolution of the industry of our people by\r\nthe abolition of slavery during the Civil War.  The only mitigation\r\nof my desire for a prompt revision of the tariff is the confidence\r\nI have that delay and discussion will make the sectional revolution\r\nmore thorough and universal, and leave the tariff question a purely\r\nbusiness and not a political or sectional issue.\"\r\n\r\nThe nine commissioners appointed by President Arthur were well\r\nselected, and they were, under the law, required to report on that\r\nsubject to the following session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary at this session to extend the corporate existence\r\nof national banks.  By the terms of the original national banking\r\nact, banks organized under it continued for but twenty years, which\r\nwould expire within two years.  A bill for the extension of the\r\ntime was introduced and a long discussion followed about silver,\r\ncertificates of deposit, clearing house certificates and other\r\nfinancial matters.  There was but little if any opposition to the\r\nextension of national banks and the bill passed.  It was approved\r\nJuly 12, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe most important financial measure passed by this Congress was\r\nthe bill to reduce internal revenue taxes, reported March 29, 1882,\r\nby William D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, from the committee of ways\r\nand means.  After a debate extending to June 27, a motion to recommit\r\nwas rejected and the bill passed the House.  It was sent to the\r\nSenate and reported with amendments by Mr. Morrill, from the\r\ncommittee on finance, July 6.  On July 11 it was recommitted to\r\nthe committee on finance and immediately reported back with\r\namendments, which consisted of a change in the tariff duties on\r\nsugar and an increase of the duties on cotton, ties and a few other\r\nthings.  It was not a general revision of the tariff.  Mr. Beck\r\nantagonized the amendments proposed by the committee and sought to\r\ndelay the passage of the bill.  I replied to him as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If this Congress shall adjourn, whether the weather be hot or\r\ncold, without a reduction of the taxes now imposed upon the people,\r\nit will have been derelict in its highest duty.  There is no\r\nsentiment in this country stronger now than that Congress has\r\nneglected its duty thus far in not repealing taxes that are obnoxious\r\nto the people and unnecessary for the public uses; and if we should\r\nstill neglect that duty we should be properly held responsible by\r\nour constituents.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the long debate Mr. Vance, of North Carolina, who\r\nwas the acknowledged wit of the Senate, moved to except playing\r\ncards from the general repeal of stamp taxes.  I objected to keeping\r\nup the system of stamp taxes and said:\r\n\r\n\"If Senators want to insist on a piece of what I call demagogism,\r\nby keeping a small stamp tax on playing cards, I am perfectly\r\nwilling that they should do so.  If it is desired now to show our\r\nvirtuous indignation against card-playing, to single out this tax,\r\nwhich probably yields but three or four thousand dollars a year--\r\nto show our virtuous indignation against people who play cards and\r\nagainst card-playing, let it be done in the name of Heaven.  Let\r\nus keep this as a monument of our virtue and intelligence and the\r\nhorror of the Senate of the United States against playing whist\r\nand euchre.  I hope that no such vote will be given.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Vance replied in his peculiarly humorous way, and concluded by\r\nsaying:  \"I have no doubt that not a men in the United States, but\r\nwho, when he 'stands pat' with three jacks, or draws to two aces,\r\nwill glorify the name of the Senator from Ohio; and if there is\r\ngratitude in human nature, I expect the see the next edition of\r\nplaying cards bearing a fullsized portrait of the Senator from Ohio\r\nas the distinguishing mark of the 'yerker.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate was equally divided on this question of retaining the\r\ntax on playing cards, the vote being 28 for and 28 against.  As\r\nthere was not a majority in favor of the amendment of Mr. Vance it\r\nwas rejected and the tax was repealed.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck undertook to amend the bill by a general revision and\r\nreduction of the tariff duties in long schedules introduced by him.\r\nI took an active part in the discussion of this bill in the hope\r\nthat by it we might secure a logical and desirable revenue law.\r\nNo final action was taken on it before the adjournment of Congress\r\non the 8th of August, after an eight months' session, and it went\r\nover to the next session.\r\n\r\nAfter the long and wearisome session I returned to Mansfield.  The\r\ncongressional canvass in Ohio was then in full operation.  The\r\nfailure of Congress to pass the bill relieving the people from the\r\nburden of internal taxes no longer required, the shadow of the\r\nmurder of Garfield, the dislike and prejudice against Arthur's\r\nadministration, the temporary stringency in money matters, the liquor\r\nor license question, the Sunday observance, and the discontent of\r\nGerman Republicans, greatly weakened the Republican party in the\r\nstate and foreboded defeat.  R. A. Horr was the Republican candidate\r\nfor Congress in the district in which I reside, and on the 17th of\r\nAugust he spoke at Mansfield.  I also made a brief speech covering\r\nthe chief subjects under discussion.  I explained the causes of\r\nthe failure to pass the revenue reduction bill, blaming it, as a\r\nmatter of course, on the Democratic party, but assured my hearers\r\nthat it would pass at the next session, and that the surplus revenue\r\nwould not be wasted, but would be applied to the reduction of the\r\npublic debt, and to increase pensions to Union soldiers, their\r\nwidows and orphans.  The opposition to the immigration of Chinese\r\ninto this country was then strong.  I could only promise that\r\nCongress would do all it could to exclude them consistently with\r\ntreaty stipulations.  I favored the proper observance of the Sabbath\r\nday, claiming that it was a day of rest and should not be desecrated,\r\nbut each congregation and each citizen should be at liberty to\r\nobserve it in any way, consistent with good order and noninterference\r\nwith others.  Touching on the liquor question, I said that many\r\nof our young men were brought to disgrace and crime by indulgence\r\nin intoxicating liquors, and I therefore believed in regulating\r\nthe evil.  Why should all other business be suspended, and saloons\r\nonly be open?  I was in favor of a law imposing a large tax on all\r\ndealers in liquor, which would tend to prevent its use.  I believed\r\nin a policy that would protect our own laborers from undue competition\r\nwith foreign labor, and would increase and develop our home\r\nindustries.  This position was chiefly a defensive one, and experience\r\nhas proven that it is not a safe one.  The Republican party is\r\nstronger when it is aggressive.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August I attended the state fair as usual, and on\r\nthe morning of that day made a full and formal political address\r\ncovering both state and national interests.  I quote a few passages\r\non the liquor question, then the leading subject of state policy.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"All laws are a restraint upon liberty.  We surrender some of our\r\nnatural rights for the security of the rest.  The only question\r\nis, where is the boundary between rights reserved and those given\r\nup?  And the only answer is, wherever the general good will be\r\npromoted by the surrender.  In a republic the personal liberty of\r\nthe citizen to do what he wishes should not be restricted, except\r\nwhen it is clear that it is for the interest of the public at large.\r\nThere are three forms of legislative restriction:  Prohibition,\r\nregulation and taxation, of which taxation is the mildest.  We\r\nprohibit crime, we regulate and restrain houses of bad fame.  We\r\ntax whisky and beer.  I see no hardship in such restraints upon\r\nliberty.  They are all not only for the public good, but for the\r\ngood of those affected.  If certain social enjoyments are prolific\r\nof vice and crime they must give way, or submit to restraints or\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n\"I know it is extremely difficult to define the line between social\r\nhabits and enjoyments perfectly innocent and proper and those that\r\nare injurious to all concerned.  It is in this that the danger\r\nlies, for the law ought never to interfere with social happiness\r\nand innocent enjoyments.  The fault of Americans is that they are\r\nnot social enough.  I have seen on the banks of the Rhine, and in\r\nBerlin, old and young men, women, children of all conditions of\r\nsocial life, listening to music, playing their games and drinking\r\ntheir beer, doing no wrong and meaning none.  I have seen in the\r\nvillages of France the young people dancing gayly, with all the\r\nanimation of youth and innocence, while the old people, looking\r\non, were chatting and joking and drinking their native wines, and\r\nI could see no wrong in all this.\r\n\r\n\"But there were other scenes in these and other countries:  Ginshops\r\nand haunts of vice where the hand of authority was seen and felt.\r\nWhat I contend for is that the lawmaking power shall be authorized\r\nto make the distinction between innocent and harmful amusements\r\nand the places and habits of life which eventually lead to\r\nintemperance, vice and crime.  Surely we can leave to our general\r\nassembly, chosen by the people and constantly responsible to them,\r\nthe framing of such wise regulations, distinction and taxes as will\r\ndiscriminate between enjoyment and vicious places of resort.\r\n\r\n\"It is a reproach to our legislative capacity to allow free whisky\r\nto be sold, untaxed and without regulation, at tens of thousands\r\nof groggeries and saloons, lest some law should be passed to restrain\r\nthe liberty of the citizen.  What we want is a wise, discriminating\r\ntax law on the traffic in intoxicating liquors, and judicious\r\nlegislation to restrain, as far as practicable, the acknowledged\r\nevils that flow from this unlimited traffic.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech expressed my convictions in respect to temperance, and\r\nhow far this and kindred subjects should be regulated by legislative\r\nauthority.  This was a delicate subject, but I believe the opinions\r\nexpressed by me were generally entertained by the people of Ohio\r\nand would have been fully acted upon by the legislature but for\r\nrevenue restrictions in the constitution of Ohio.\r\n\r\nAfter I closed Governor Foster and Speaker Keifer spoke briefly.\r\nThe general canvass then continued over the state until the election.\r\nAs the only state officers to be elected were the secretary of\r\nstate, a supreme judge and a member of the board of public works,\r\nthe chief interest centered in the liquor question and in the\r\nelection of Members of Congress in doubtful districts.  I spoke in\r\nseveral districts, especially in Elyria, Warren, Wauseon, Tiffin\r\nand Zanesville.  I spent several days in Cincinnati, socially, and\r\nin speaking in different parts of the city.  The result of the\r\nelection was that James W. Newman, the Democratic candidate for\r\nsecretary of state, received a majority of 19,000 over Charles\r\nTownsend, the Republican candidate.  This was heralded as a Democratic\r\nvictory.  In one sense this was true, but it was properly attributed\r\nby the Republicans to the opposition to prohibition.  It grew out\r\nof the demand of a portion of our people for free whisky and no\r\nSunday. THey were opposed to the liquor law, and believed it went\r\ntoo far, and voted the Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\nA few days after the election I went with two friends to Lawrence,\r\nKansas, arriving about the 15th of October.  I have always retained\r\na kindly feeling for the people of that state since I shared in\r\nthe events of its early history.  With each visit I have marked\r\nthe rapid growth of the state and the intense politics that divided\r\nits people into several parties.  This was the natural outgrowth\r\nof conditions and events before the Civil War.  As usual I was\r\ncalled upon to make a speech in Lawrence, which, in view of our\r\nrecent defeat in Ohio, was not a pleasant task.  However, I accepted,\r\nand spoke at the opera house, chiefly on the early history of Kansas\r\nand the struggle in that territory and state, which resulted in\r\ntransforming the United States from a confederacy of hostile states\r\ninto a powerful republic founded upon the principles of universal\r\nliberty and perpetual union.\r\n\r\nFrom Lawrence we went into Texas, and for the first time traversed\r\nthat magnificent state, going from Denison to Laredo on the Rio\r\nGrande, stopping on the way at Austin and San Antonio.  On the\r\nroute I met Senator Richard Coke and his former colleague, Samuel\r\nB. Maxey.  I have studied the history of Texas and its vast\r\nundeveloped resources, and anticipated its growth in wealth and\r\npopulation.  It is destined to be, if not the first, among the\r\nfirst, of the great states of the Union.  We returned via Texarkana\r\nto St. Louis and thence home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nSTEPS TOWARDS MUCH NEEDED TARIFF LEGISLATION.\r\nNecessity of Relief from Unnecessary Taxation--Views of the President\r\nas Presented to Congress in December, 1882--Views of the Tariff\r\nCommission Appointed by the President--Great Changes Made by the\r\nSenate--Regret That I Did Not Defeat the Bill--Wherein Many Sections\r\nWere Defective or Unjust--Bill to Regulate and Improve the Civil\r\nService--A Mandatory Provision That Should be Added to the Existing\r\nLaw--Further Talk of Nominating Me for Governor of Ohio--Reasons\r\nWhy I Could Not Accept--Selected as Chairman of the State Convention\r\n--Refusal to Be Nominated--J. B. Foraker Nominated by Acclamation\r\n--His Career--Issues of the Campaign--My Trip to Montana--Resuming\r\nthe Canvass--Hoadley Elected Governor--Retirement of Gen. Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe President was able to present, in his annual message to Congress\r\non the 4th of December, 1882, a very favorable statement of the\r\ncondition of the United States during the preceding year.  He\r\nrecalled the attention of Congress to the recommendation in his\r\nprevious message on the importance of relieving the industry and\r\nenterprise of the country from the pressure of unnecessary taxation,\r\nand to the fact that the public revenues had far exceeded the\r\nexpenditures, and, unless checked by appropriate legislation, such\r\nexcess would continue to increase from year to year.  The surplus\r\nrevenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, amounted to\r\n$100,000,000, and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, it\r\namounted to more than $145,000,000.  This was applied to the payment\r\nof the public debt.  He renewed the expression of his conviction\r\nthat such rapid extinguishment of the national indebtedness as was\r\ntaking place was by no means a cause for congratulation, but rather\r\nfor serious apprehension.  He therefore urged upon Congress the\r\npolicy of diminishing the revenue by reducing taxation.  He then\r\nstated at length his opinion of the reductions that ought to be\r\nmade.  He felt justified in recommending the abolition of all\r\ninternal taxes except those upon tobacco in its various forms, and\r\nupon distilled spirits and fermented liquors.  The message was a\r\nclear and comprehensive statement of the existing tariff system,\r\nand the unequal distribution of both its burdens and its benefits.\r\nHe called attention to the creation of the tariff commission, and\r\nto the report of that commission as to the condition and prospects\r\nof the various commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, mining and\r\nother interests of the country, and recommended an enlargement of\r\nthe free list, so as to include within it numerous articles which\r\nyielded inconsiderable revenue, a simplification of the complex\r\nand inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures,\r\nparticularly those of cotton, iron and steel, and a substantial\r\nreduction of the duties upon those and various other articles.\r\nThe subsequent action of Congress did not, in my opinion, conform\r\nto this, in some respects, wise recommendation of the President.\r\nIn his closing paragraph he stated:\r\n\r\n\"The closing year has been replete with blessings for which we owe\r\nto the Giver of all good our reverent acknowledgment.  For the\r\nuninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations, for the decay of\r\nsectional animosities, for the exuberance of our harvests and the\r\ntriumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for the\r\nprevalence of health, the spread of intelligence and the conservation\r\nof the public credit, for the growth of the country in all the\r\nelements of national greatness--for these and countless other\r\nblessings--we should rejoice and be glad.  I trust that under the\r\ninspiration of this great prosperity our counsels may be harmonious,\r\nand that the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice and economy\r\nmay lead to the adoption of measures in which the Congress and the\r\nExecutive may heartily unite.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury emphasized and elaborated\r\nthe recommendations of the President.\r\n\r\nThe real cause of the delay of the Senate at the previous session,\r\nin acting upon the internal revenue bill, was the desire to await\r\nthe action of the tariff commission appointed under the act approved\r\nMay 15, 1882.  To secure a comprehensive scheme of taxation it was\r\nnecessary to include in a revenue bill duties on imported goods as\r\nwell as taxes on internal productions.  The members of the tariff\r\ncommission appointed by the President, and who signed the report,\r\nwere John L. Hayes, Henry W. Oliver, A. M. Garland, J. A. Ambler,\r\nRobert P. Porter, J. W. H. Underwood, Alexander R. Boteler, and\r\nDuncan F. Kenner.  These gentlemen were of high standing, representing\r\ndifferent parts of the country, of both political parties, and\r\nnotably familiar with our internal and external commerce and\r\nproductions.  In their report they said:\r\n\r\n\"In performance of the duty devolved upon them, all the members of\r\nthe commission have aimed, and, as they believe, with success, to\r\ndivest themselves of political bias, sectional prejudice, or\r\nconsiderations of personal interest.  It is their desire that their\r\nrecommendations shall serve no particular party, class, section,\r\nor school of political economy.\"\r\n\r\nThey transmitted their report to the speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the 4th of December, 1882.  It was a clear and\r\nbusiness-like statement of their action, accompanied with schedules\r\nof duties on imported goods recommended by them, with suggested\r\namendments to existing customs laws, with testimony taken by them,\r\nand with tables and reports covering, in all, over 2,500 printed\r\npages.  It was by far the most comprehensive exposition of our\r\ncustoms laws and rates of duty that, so far as I know, had been\r\npublished.  It was quickly printed for the use of the finance\r\ncommittee of the Senate, before whom the bill to reduce internal\r\nrevenue taxation was pending.  If the committee had embodied, in\r\nthis bill, the recommendations of the tariff commission, including\r\nthe schedules without amendment or change, the tariff would have\r\nbeen settled for many years.  Unfortunately this was not done, but\r\nthe schedules prescribing the rates of duty and their classification\r\nwere so radically changed by the committee that the scheme of the\r\ntariff commission was practically defeated.  Many persons wishing\r\nto advance their particular industries appeared before the committee\r\nand succeeded in having their views adopted.  The Democratic members\r\nseemed to take little interest in the proceedings, as they were\r\nopposed to the adoption of the tariff as a part of the bill.  I\r\ndid all I could to prevent these changes, was very much discouraged\r\nby the action of the committee, and doubted the propriety of voting\r\nfor the bill with the tariff provisions as proposed by the committee\r\nand adopted by the Senate.  I have always regretted that I did not\r\ndefeat the bill, which I could readily have done by voting with\r\nthe Democrats against the adoption of the conference report, which\r\npassed the Senate by the vote of yeas 32, nays 30.  However, the\r\npropriety and necessity of a reduction of internal taxes proposed\r\nby the bill were so urgent that I did not feel justified in denying\r\nrelief from burdensome and unnecessary taxes on account of provisions\r\nin the bill that I did not approve.  With great reluctance I voted\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nOne reduction made by the committee against my most strenuous\r\nefforts was by a change in the classification and rates of the duty\r\non wool.  When I returned to Ohio I was violently assailed by the\r\nDemocratic newspapers for voting for a bill that reduced the existing\r\nduty on wool about twenty per cent., and I had much difficulty in\r\nexplaining to my constituents that I opposed the reduction, but,\r\nwhen the Senate refused to adopt by view, did not feel justified,\r\non account of my opposition to this one item, in voting against\r\nthe bill as a whole.  The conference report was agreed to by the\r\nHouse of Representatives on the 2nd of March, and the bill was\r\napproved by the President on the 3rd.\r\n\r\nI did not conceal my opposition to the tariff sections of the\r\nrevenue bill.  I expressed it in debate, in interviews and in\r\nletters.  When the bill was reported to the Senate it was met by\r\ntwo kinds of opposition, one the blind party opposition of free\r\ntraders, led by Senators Beck and Vance, the other (much more\r\ndangerous), the conflict of selfish and local interests, mainly on\r\nthe part of manufacturers, who regarded all articles which they\r\npurchased as raw material, on which they wished the lowest possible\r\nrate of duty, or none at all, and their work, as the finished\r\narticle, on which they wished the highest rate of duty.  In other\r\nwords, what they had to buy they called raw material to be admitted\r\nwithout protection, and what they had to sell they wanted protection.\r\nIt was a combination of the two kinds of opposition that made the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Senators, with a few exceptions, voted steadily and\r\nblindly for any reduction of duty proposed; but they alone could\r\nnot carry their amendments, and only did so when re-enforced by\r\nRepublican Senators, who, influenced by local interest, could reduce\r\nany duty at their pleasure.  In this way, often by a majority of\r\none, amendments were adopted that destroyed the harmony of the\r\nbill.  In this way iron ore, pig iron, scrap iron and wool were\r\nsacrificed in the Senate.  They were classed as raw materials for\r\nmanufactures and not as manufactures.  For selfish and local reasons\r\ntin plates, cotton, ties and iron and steel rods for wire were put\r\nat exceptionally low rates, and thus were stricken from the list\r\nof articles that could be manufactured in this country.  This local\r\nand selfish appeal was the great defect of the tariff bill.  I do\r\nnot hesitate to say that the iron and wool sections of the bill,\r\nas it passed the Senate, were unjust, incongruous and absurd.  They\r\nwould have reduced the iron and steel industries of the United\r\nStates to their condition before the war, and have closed up two-\r\nthirds of the furnaces and rolling mills in this country.  They\r\nwere somewhat changed in the committee of conference, but if they\r\nhad not been, the only alternative to the manufacturers would have\r\nbeen to close up or largely reduce the wages of labor.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake made in the Senate was to strike out all the\r\ncarefully prepared legislative provisions simplifying the mode of\r\ncollecting customs duties, and the provisions for the trial of\r\ncustoms cases.  The tariff commission proposed to repeal the _ad\r\nvalorem_ duty on wool, and leave on it only the specific duty of\r\nten and twelve cents a pound.  The chairman of the tariff commission\r\nwas himself the president or agent of the woolen manufacturers and\r\nmade the report.  The manufacturers of woolens, however, were\r\ndissatisfied, and demanded an entire change in the classification\r\nof woolens, and, on some important grades, a large increase of\r\nrates, but insisted upon a reduction of the duty on wool.\r\n\r\nI hoped when the bill passed the Senate that a conference committee\r\nwould amend it, but, unfortunately Senators Bayard and Beck withdrew\r\nfrom the conference and the Senate was represented by Senators\r\nMorrill, Aldrich and Sherman.  My colleagues on the conference were\r\npart of the majority in the Senate, and favored the bill, and the\r\nHouse conferees seemed concerned chiefly in getting some bill of\r\nrelief, some reduction of taxes, before the close of the session.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March, 1883, in reply to a question of a correspondent\r\nwhether I had any objection to having my views reported, I said:\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; the contest is now over, and I see no reason why the\r\nmerits and demerits of the law should not be stated.  I worked at\r\nit with the finance committee for three months, to the exclusion\r\nof other business.  Taken as a whole, I think the law will do a\r\ngreat deal of good and some harm.  The great body of it is wise\r\nand just, but it contains some serious defects.  The metallic and\r\nwool schedules are unequal and unjust.  The great merit of the bill\r\nis that it reduces taxes.  I would not have voted for it, if any\r\nother way had been open to reduce taxes.\r\n\r\n\"Was there any urgent necessity for reducing taxes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  The demand for a reduction of taxes was general, and, in\r\nrespect to some taxes, pressing and imperative.  The failure of\r\nCongress to reduce taxes was one of the chief causes of the defeat\r\nof the Republican party last fall, though it was not really the\r\nfault of our party.  The bill was talked to death by Democratic\r\nSenators.  The taxes levied by the United States are not oppressive,\r\nbut they are excessive.  They tempt extravagance.  We could not go\r\nhome without reducing the internal taxes.  What I want you to\r\nemphasize is, that the tariff sections could not have passed in\r\ntheir present shape but for their connection with the internal\r\nrevenue sections.  We could not separate them; therefore, though\r\nI voted against the tariff sections of the Senate bill, I felt\r\nconstrained to vote for the bill as a whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not the bill, as it passed, substantially the bill of the tariff\r\ncommission?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; the tariff commission had nothing to do with internal\r\ntaxes.  The internal revenue sections were in the House bill of\r\nlast session, and were then amended by the Senate.  That bill gave\r\nthe Senate jurisdiction of the subject.  It was only under cover\r\nof amendment to that bill that the Senate could pass a tariff.  At\r\nthe beginning of this session, the finance committee of the Senate\r\nhad before it the tariff commission report, which was an admirable\r\nand harmonious plan for a complete law fixing the rates of duty on\r\nall kinds of imported merchandise, and, what was better, an admirable\r\nrevision of the laws for the collection of duties and for the trial\r\nof customs cases.  If the committee had adopted this report, and\r\neven had reduced the rates of duty proposed by the commission, but\r\npreserved the harmony and symmetry of the plan, we would have had\r\na better tariff law than has existed in this country.  But, instead\r\nof this, the committee unduly reduced the duties on iron and steel,\r\nand raised the duties on cotton and woolen manufactures, in some\r\ncases higher than the old tariff.  The committee restored nearly\r\nall the inequalities and incongruities of the old tariff, and\r\nyielded to local demands and local interests to an extent that\r\ndestroyed all symmetry or harmony.  But still the bill reported to\r\nthe Senate was a passable tariff except as to iron and wool; but\r\nit was not in any respect an improvement on the tariff commission\r\nreport.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Morrill, in a long letter to the New York \"Tribune\" of the\r\ndate of April 28, 1883, made a reply to my objections to the tariff\r\namendment, but it did not change my opinion, and now, after the\r\nlapse of many years, I am still of the same opinion.  The tariff\r\nact of 1883 laid the foundation for all the tariff complications\r\nsince that time.\r\n\r\nDuring this session a bill to regulate and improve the civil service\r\nof the United States was reported by my colleague, Mr. Pendleton,\r\nand was made the subject of an interesting debate in the Senate,\r\nwhich continued most of the month of December, 1882.  It was referred\r\nto the committee on reform in the civil service in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, was promptly reported, and, after a brief debate,\r\npassed that body and was approved by the President.  This important\r\nmeasure provided for a nonpartisan civil service commission composed\r\nof three persons, and defined their duties.  It withdrew from party\r\npolitics the great body of the employees of the government.  Though\r\nnot always wisely executed it has been the basis of reforms in the\r\ncivil service, and, with some amendments to promote its efficiency,\r\nis now in successful operation.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of all parties is to include under civil service rules\r\nall employments in the executive branch of the government, except\r\nthose that, by the constitution, are appointed by the President by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate.  If to this should\r\nbe added an imperative provision of law forbidding any Member of\r\nCongress from applying for the appointment of any person to an\r\nexecutive office, the abuses of the old system would be corrected\r\nand the separate departments of the government would be independent\r\nof each other.  My experience as an executive officer convinced me\r\nthat such a mandatory provision would not only break up the \"spoils\r\nsystem,\" but would relieve the President and heads of departments,\r\nas well as Members of Congress, from much of the friction that\r\noften disturbs them in the discharge of their separate duties.\r\n\r\nBefore I returned home in the spring of 1883, the nomination of a\r\ncandidate for governor was being canvassed in the press and among\r\nthe people of Ohio.  My name, among others, was mentioned, but I\r\ndid not take any interest in the suggestion of my nomination,\r\nsupposing it was a passing thought that, upon reflection, would be\r\nabandoned.  No one could then foresee how the legislature to be\r\nelected in the fall would stand politically, and my friends would\r\nhardly risk the loss of a Republican Senator, through my resignation,\r\nto compliment me with an election as governor.\r\n\r\nI returned to Ohio early in April, and, as usual, paid my respects\r\nto the general assembly, then in session at Columbus.  I was kindly\r\nreceived and expressed my thanks as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the general assembly, I thank you for this hearty\r\nreception.  In this house of speechmakers I will be pardoned for\r\nnot making an address.  You are the representatives of the people,\r\nand to you I owe my first allegiance, doing as best I can the will\r\nof the people of Ohio and of the United States, without respect to\r\nparty, creed or condition.  In the closing hours of your session\r\nyou are too much engaged for me to indulge in any remarks, and so\r\nI bid you good-bye.  Again, gentlemen, I return my warmest thanks.\"\r\n\r\nI was received in the same manner in the senate.  I found a much\r\nstronger feeling in favor of my nomination for governor than I\r\nexpected.  I therefore stated definitely that I could not be a\r\ncandidate, and a few days afterwards, in reply to an editor who\r\nwas entitled to a frank answer, as to whether my name was to be at\r\nthe head of the state ticket, I said:\r\n\r\n\"I am not a candidate, never have been, and could not accept the\r\ngubernatorial nomination under any circumstances.  It is out of\r\nthe question.  There was a manifest disposition at one time to run\r\nme _nolens volens_, but my friends now understand my position fully,\r\nand will not press the point.  It is as though the possibility had\r\nnever been suggested, and the less said about it the better.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration was variously regarded by the newspapers; by one\r\nas a proclamation of a panic, by another as a doubt of success, by\r\nanother as a selfish desire to hold on to a better office, neither\r\nof which was true.  While I did not wish the nomination, I would\r\nhave felt it my duty to accept it if the convention had determined\r\nthat my acceptance was necessary for success.  Upon my return to\r\nMansfield in May, in an interview with a reporter, I mentioned\r\nseveral able men in the state who were well qualified for that\r\noffice.  I spoke of Judge Foraker as one who would make an acceptable\r\ncandidate.  I did not then know him personally, but from what I\r\nhad heard of him I preferred him to any other person named.  He\r\nwas young, active, eloquent and would make a good canvass.  At that\r\ntime there was a movement to push the nomination of Thurman and\r\nSherman as competing candidates.  The state convention was approaching\r\nand I had been invited to attend.  I went to Columbus on the 5th\r\nof June.  All sorts of rumors were being circulated.  The general\r\ntrend of them was thus stated by a leading Republican journal:\r\n\r\n\"The question is being quietly discussed by a number of prominent\r\nRepublicans, and the movement promises to assume such proportions\r\nbefore the day of the convention, that it will result in the\r\nnomination of Senator Sherman for governor.  It has been stated\r\nthat Mr. Sherman would not accept, yet one of the most prominent\r\nof Ohio Republicans says, with emphasis:  'Mr. John Sherman has\r\nbeen honored for the last thirty years by the Republican party,\r\nand he could not afford to decline the nomination, and he would\r\nnot.'  The great interest manifested throughout the country in\r\nOhio, is such that it is deemed wise, owing to existing circumstances,\r\nto insist on the nomination of Mr. Sherman, thereby avoiding all\r\ncontest in the convention, and giving a national prominence to the\r\ncampaign.  Should this be done, as it is now believed that it will\r\nbe, the nomination of ex-Senator Thurman, by the Democrats, would\r\nbe a foregone conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nAs the delegates arrived it was apparent that there was a general\r\ndesire that I should be nominated, and several delegations came to\r\nmy room to urge me to accept.  Among others who came to me were\r\nMessrs. Jones, Johnson and Fassett, of the Mahoning county delegation.\r\nAfter some general conversation they said that in order that they\r\nmight act with a full knowledge of the situation, and with reference\r\nto the best interests of the party, they desired to ask me if I\r\nwas or would be a candidate for the nomination of governor.  I\r\nanswered directly, and plainly, that I was not a candidate; would\r\nnot and could not become one.  I said I was sorry that matters had\r\nshaped themselves as they had, as I was put in the position of\r\nrefusing to obey the call of my party, that I believed it was the\r\nplace of every man to take any responsibility that could be put\r\nupon him, but that, in my case, my duty was in another direction,\r\nthat I thought my place then was in the Senate, and that the possible\r\ndanger of a Democratic successor there ought to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe convention met on the morning after my arrival, and I was\r\nselected as chairman.  I was not aware until I arrived in Columbus\r\nthat I was to preside over the convention, but, as customary on\r\ntaking the chair, I made an address thanking the convention for\r\nthe honor conferred upon me, briefly reviewed the history of the\r\nRepublican party, spoke of the tariff, the liquor and other questions\r\nwhich would have to be met in the canvass, and appealed to all\r\npresent to unite and use their utmost endeavors for success.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my repeated statements that I could not accept the\r\nnomination, J. M. Dalzell arose from the ranks of the delegation\r\nfrom his district, in the rear part of the hall, and, mounting his\r\nseat, made an enthusiastic speech nominating me for governor.  I\r\ndeclined in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Convention:--I have not been insensible to the\r\ndesire of many gentlemen and personal friends to put my name in\r\nnomination for governor.  But let me say frankly but firmly that\r\nI cannot be your candidate.  In order that I may not be misunderstood,\r\nI desire your attention for a few moments, to state my reasons for\r\ndeclining the nomination.  I have been under so many obligations\r\nto the Republican party of Ohio, that, if this was merely a matter\r\nof personal interest or feeling, I would say 'yes!'  But, I cannot\r\naccept this nomination.  First, because you have charged me with\r\nthe duty of a Member of the Senate of the United States; and I\r\ncould not surrender that, with my sense of what is just, not only\r\nto the people of Ohio, but to the people of the United States.\r\nAnd I will say that that view is shared by many of my associates\r\nin the Senate.  They deprecate any movement of this kind on account\r\nof the condition of affairs there.  But, aside from that, there is\r\none consideration that would prevent me from becoming a candidate\r\nnow.  When early applied to on this subject, I stated to the\r\ngentlemen whose names were mentioned to come before this convention,\r\nthat I was not a candidate and would not be a candidate.  I could\r\nnot accept your nomination without a feeling of personal dishonor,\r\nand that you certainly do not wish to bring upon me.  Although all\r\nof you, my Republican friends, would know I was sincere in that\r\ndeclaration, yet the censorious world at large would say that I\r\nhad not acted a manly part; I could not bear an imputation of that\r\nkind.  So that, even if the nomination were presented to me with\r\na unanimous feeling in this convention, yet I would feel bound, by\r\na feeling of personal honor, which is the higher law, especially\r\namong Republicans, to decline.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention then nominated Joseph R. Foraker for governor by\r\nacclamation.  He was introduced to the convention and made a long\r\nand pleasant address.  His speech was well received and he was\r\noften interrupted with cheers.  He was then about thirty-seven\r\nyears old, and was but little known throughout the state, but his\r\nappearance, manner, and address satisfied the convention and he\r\nwas at once recognized as a man of ability, who would take and hold\r\na prominent place in the political history of the state.  He had\r\nenlisted as a boy at Camp Dennison at the early age of sixteen,\r\nand rapidly rose through the military grades until, at Mission\r\nRidge, he commanded two companies and led them over the ridge into\r\nthe enemy's works, being the first man of his regiment over the\r\nridge.  He was with Sherman on his celebrated march to the sea.\r\nMy brother spoke of him in the highest terms of praise.  After the\r\nwar he entered college at Delaware, rapidly advanced through college\r\nand completed his study of law, and at an early age was elected to\r\na five years' term as a judge of the superior court of Cincinnati.\r\nHe is now in the meridian of his intellectual strength, and will,\r\nin all human probability, attain higher distinction.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ticket was soon completed by the nomination of\r\nstrong candidates for each of the offices to be filled at that\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of this canvass it was known that the result\r\nwas doubtful, not only on national issues, but, on the recent\r\nlegislation in Ohio, on the much mooted liquor question.\r\n\r\nThe \"Scott\" law imposed a tax on dealers in liquors and beer, and\r\nalso proposed two temperance amendments which were submitted to\r\nthe people.  The constitution of Ohio declares that \"no license to\r\ntraffic in intoxicating liquors shall hereafter be grated in this\r\nstate, but the general assembly may, by law, provide against evils\r\nresulting therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the status of the legislation in Ohio in 1883, I said during\r\nthis canvass that, under this provision, the legislature of Ohio\r\nfor thirty years had, from time to time, passed laws to prevent\r\nthe evils that arose from the sale of intoxicating liquors, but\r\nwithout effect.  The constitution so limited the powers of the\r\ngeneral assembly that it could only pass prohibitory and punitive\r\nlaws.  It could not regulate by money license the sale of liquors.\r\nBoth parties joined in this kind of legislation, but it was safe\r\nto say that all the laws on the subject were substantially nullified\r\nby popular opinion, or by inability in cities and large towns to\r\nenforce them.  Thus, in Ohio, we had, for more than thirty years,\r\nfree whisky, without restraint, without taxation, to a degree that\r\nprobably did not exist in any other state of the Union, or any\r\nother Christian or civilized country.  Two years before, the\r\nRepublican party, in convention at Cleveland, declared itself in\r\nfavor of an amendment to the constitution which would give the\r\ngeneral assembly full legislative power over the traffic, free from\r\nthe restraint of the old constitution.  The legislature, instead\r\nof acting upon this proposition, postponed it, and passed what was\r\nknown as the Pond bill.  The supreme court declared that law\r\nunconstitutional, as being within the meaning of the inhibition of\r\nthe constitution.  Thus, at the previous election, the Republican\r\nparty appeared before the people of the state when they were\r\ndiscontented alike with the action of the general assembly and of\r\nCongress for its failure to reduce taxes, and so we were badly\r\nbeaten by the staying from the polls of 70,000 Republican voters.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this defeat were apparent to every intelligent man.\r\nThe general assembly, however, at the next session, met the temperance\r\nquestion in a different spirit.  It submitted to the people two\r\nproposed amendments to the constitution, one providing for full\r\nlegislative control over the traffic in spirits, and the other\r\nproviding for the absolute prohibition of the traffic.  Pending\r\nthe action of the people on these two amendments, the legislature\r\nprovided by a law, called the Scott law, for a tax of $200 annually\r\non the sale of spirituous liquors and $100 on the sale of beer.\r\nThis law was held to be constitutional by the supreme court of\r\nOhio.  This action of the legislature had been approved by the\r\nRepublican state convention.\r\n\r\nUpon the question thus presented there was a division of opinion\r\nin the Republican party.  On the one hand, a large body of Republicans,\r\nmostly Germans in the large cities, regarded this legislation as\r\nan attempt to interfere with their habit of drinking beer, which\r\nthey regarded as a harmless beverage.  On the other hand, the\r\ndisciples of total abstinence were opposed to the \"Scott\" law as\r\na license to sell and drink intoxicating liquors, which license,\r\nthey alleged, was wrong and against public policy.  They were for\r\nprohibition outright; they regarded the tax law as a covenant with\r\nhell, and nominated a ticket to represent their principles.  The\r\nDemocratic party occupied a position of opposition to every\r\nproposition about the liquor laws.  They placed in nomination, as\r\ntheir candidate for governor, George H. Hoadley, an eminent lawyer,\r\nand able speaker and a man of good character and standing.  He had\r\nbeen an earnest Republican during and since the war, but had followed\r\nthe wake of Chase, and joined the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe tariff issue also entered into this canvass.  The farmers of\r\nOhio complained that the duty on wool had been reduced, while the\r\nduties on woolen goods were increased; that protection was given\r\nto the manufacturer and denied to the farmer.  A great outcry was\r\nmade by Democratic orators and newspapers in farming communities\r\nagainst this injustice, and I was selected as the leader and author\r\nof it.  Handbills were freely demonstrated by the Democratic\r\ncommittee in public places, denouncing me as the wicked destroyer\r\nof the sheep industry of Ohio farmers.  I replied that it was true\r\nthat in the recent tariff act there was a reduction of the duty on\r\nwool of about two cents a pound, but that I had opposed it, and\r\ndid all I could to prevent it, but it was carried by the united\r\nvote of the Democratic party in both Houses, aided by a few Republican\r\nSenators and Members from New England.  I denounced the hypocrisy\r\nof those who assailed me, whose representatives voted for even a\r\ngreater reduction, and some of them for free wool.  To all this\r\nthey answered:  \"Did you not vote for the bill on its passage?\"\r\nI had to say yes, but gave the reasons why, as already stated.  No\r\ndoubt, in spite of the unfairness of this accusation, it had some\r\nadverse influence on the election.\r\n\r\nThis canvass was in many respects a peculiar one.  Foraker was\r\nactive and spoke in nearly every county in the state, and gave\r\ngeneral satisfaction, but Hoadley was equally able and, having been\r\nuntil recently a Republican, could not be held responsible for the\r\ncourse of the Democratic party during and since the war.  Both the\r\ncandidates for governor being from Cincinnati, the struggle there\r\nwas more intense than usual, and was made to turn on the liquor\r\nquestion more than on general politics.  When I was asked about\r\nthe German vote, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The Germans are, generally speaking, good Republicans, and are\r\nreally a temperate people.  They have always claimed to be willing\r\nto pay a tax on the sale of beer and other kinds of liquor.  The\r\nScott bill is very moderate--more so than the bills that are being\r\npassed in other states.  If they mean what they say, I don't think\r\nthere will be any trouble about electing our ticket.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the convention, in company with my townsmen,\r\nGeorge F. Carpenter, Henry C. Hedges and M. Hammond, I started on\r\na trip to Helena, Montana.  The object was simply recreation and\r\nsight-seeing.  We stopped on the way at Chicago, St. Paul and other\r\npoints.  Everywhere we went we met interviewers who wanted to know\r\nabout the Ohio convention and politics in general, but I preferred\r\nto talk about the great northwest.  Interviews were sought by\r\nreporters and were fully given and printed in local papers.  Hedges\r\nand Carpenter were intelligent gentlemen interested, like myself,\r\nin Chicago and St. Paul, and more familiar than I was with the\r\nlocal geography of Wisconsin and Minnesota.  With their assistance\r\nI became conversant with the topography and productions of these\r\nstates.  I was especially impressed with the growth of St. Paul\r\nand Minneapolis.  I had purchased, in connection with Mr. Cullen,\r\nsome years before, forty acres of land adjoining St. Paul.  Upon\r\nmy arrival on this trip he showed me the land, worth then more\r\nthousands than the hundreds we paid for it.  This was but a specimen\r\nof the abnormal growth of these sister cities, destined, in some\r\nnot far distant day, to be a single city.  From St. Paul, we went\r\nto Helena, then the terminus of the Northern Pacific railroad, and\r\nthe newly made capital of Montana.  This was the second time I had\r\nvisited this territory, now a state.  I studied, as well as I could,\r\nits wonderful resources, both mineral and agricultural.  It is\r\nproperly named Montana.  Its mountains are not only filled with\r\nminerals of every grade from gold to iron, but they contain, more\r\nthan any other part of the country, the freaks of nature and in\r\nbolder form, such as geysers, sink pots, mountain lakes, deep\r\nravines, and they are surrounded by vast valleys and plains, the\r\nnative home of the buffalo, now the feeding ground of vast droves\r\nof horses, herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep.\r\n\r\nThe strangely varied surface of the different states of the Union\r\nwould, in case of war with any power, enable us, from our own soil\r\nand from the riches buried under it, to support and maintain our\r\npopulation.  Already more than nine-tenths of the articles needed\r\nfor life and luxury in the United States are the product of the\r\nindustry of our countrymen.  The remaining tenth consists mainly\r\nof tea, coffee and other tropical or semi-tropical productions,\r\nthe products of nations with whom we can have no occasion for war.\r\nArticles of luxury and virtu are mainly the production of European\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nOur partial state of isolation is our greatest strength, our varied\r\nresources and productions are our greatest wealth, and unity in\r\nnational matters, independence in local matters, are the central\r\nideas of our system of government.\r\n\r\nOn our return we stopped for a day at Bismarck, Dakota, then a\r\nscattered village, but already putting on airs as the prospective\r\ncapital.  We passed through St. Paul, Milwaukee, Grand Rapids and\r\nDetroit on our way to Mansfield.  This trip, leisurely taken,\r\noccupied about one month.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the summer, until the canvass commenced,\r\nI had a period of rest and recuperation.  It was interrupted only\r\nby the necessity of making some preparation for the canvass, which\r\nit was understood was to commence on the 25th of August.  I carefully\r\ndictated my opening speech, which was delivered at Findlay on that\r\nday to a large audience.  It was printed and circulated, but most\r\nof the points discussed have been settled by the march of time.\r\nSome of them it may be of interest to recall.  I contrasted the\r\ncondition of Findlay then to Findlay when I first saw it, but if\r\nthe contrast was to be made now it would be more striking.  I\r\ndescribed the formation and history of parties as they then existed,\r\nand assumed that as Hoadley, who had been an Abolitionist or\r\nRepublican and a supporter of the war, was then the Democratic\r\ncandidate for governor, and that as Ewing and Bookwalter, the latest\r\nDemocratic candidates for governor, had also been Republicans, we\r\ncould assume this as a confession that the measures of the Republican\r\nparty were right.  I said:  \"All these distinguished and able\r\ngentlemen have been Republican partisans, as I have; and Judge\r\nHoadley has, I think, been rather more free in his denunciation of\r\nthe Democratic party than I have.  To the extent, therefore, of\r\nacquiescence in the great issues that have divided us in the past,\r\n_the Democratic party concedes that we were right_.\"\r\n\r\nI then presented the liquor question and the Scott law.  I defended\r\nthe tax imposed by this law as a wise tax, the principle of which\r\nhad been adopted in most of the states and in the chief countries\r\nof Europe.  Hoadley, instead of meeting this argument fairly,\r\nattacked the proposed amendments to the constitution prohibiting\r\nthe sale of spirits and beer as a part of the creed of the Republican\r\nparty, instead of a mere reference to the people of a disputed\r\npolicy.  This was the display of the skill of the trained lawyer\r\nto evade the real issue of the \"Scott\" bill.  He treated the\r\nreduction of the duty on wool with the same dexterity, charging it\r\nupon the Republican party, when he knew that every Democratic vote\r\nhad been cast for it, and for even a greater reduction, and that\r\nnearly every Republican vote had been cast against it.  The entire\r\ncanvass of Hoadley was an ingenious evasion of the real issues,\r\nand in its want of frankness and fairness was in marked contrast\r\nwith the speeches of Foraker.\r\n\r\nAfter the Findlay meeting I went to Cincinnati and attended the\r\nharvest home festival in Green township, and read an address on\r\nthe life and work of A. J. Downing, a noted horticulturalist and\r\nwriter on rural architecture.  I have always been interested in\r\nsuch subjects and was conversant with Downing's writings and works,\r\nespecially with his improvement of the public parks in and about\r\nWashington.  He was employed by the President of the United States\r\nin 1851, to lay out and superintend the improvement of the extensive\r\npublic grounds between the capitol and the executive mansion at\r\nWashington, commonly known as the \"Mall.\"  This important work was\r\nentered upon by him, with the utmost enthusiasm.  Elaborate plans\r\nof the Mall and other public squares were made by him, walks and\r\ndrives laid out; the place for each tree, with its kind and variety\r\ndetermined, and the work of planning mainly executed.  He, with an\r\nartist's eye, saw the then unadorned beauties of the location of\r\nthe capital; the broad sweep of the Potomac, the valley and the\r\nplain environed by its rim of varied hills, broken here and there\r\nby glens and ravines.  He spoke of it with enthusiasm, and no doubt,\r\nabove other hopes, wished, by his skill, to aid in making the city\r\nof Washington as magnificent in its views and surroundings as any\r\ncity in Europe.  But man proposes and God disposes.  It was not to\r\nbe the good fortune of Mr. Downing to complete his magnificent\r\nplans for converting the filthy, waste commons of the capital into\r\ngardens of delight; but they have been executed by others, and have\r\ncontributed largely to making Washington what he wished it to be,\r\na beautiful city, parked and planted with specimens of every American\r\ntree worthy of propagation, and becoming adorned with the best\r\nmodels of architecture, not only of public edifices, fitted for\r\nthe great offices of the nation, but of many elegant private houses.\r\n\r\nI had been invited by the Lincoln club, of Cincinnati, to attend\r\na reception at their clubhouse on the evening of the 1st of September.\r\nIt is a political as well as a social club, and I was expected to\r\nmake a political speech.  I did so, and was followed by Foraker\r\nand H. L. Morey.  The usual \"refreshments\" were not forgotten.  I\r\ntake this occasion to express my hearty approval of the organization\r\nand maintenance of political clubs in every city containing 10,000\r\nor more inhabitants.  The Republicans of Cincinnati have for many\r\nyears maintained two notable organizations, the Lincoln and the\r\nBlaine clubs, which have been places of social intercourse, as well\r\nas centers for political discussion.  Both have had a beneficial\r\ninfluence, not only in instructing their members on political\r\ntopics, but in disseminating sound opinion throughout the state.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit I was elected a member of the Chamber of Commerce\r\nin Cincinnati.  I regarded this as an honor, and returned to its\r\nmembers my sincere thanks.  Although I have not been engaged in\r\ncommercial pursuits, yet in my public duties I have often been\r\ncalled upon to act upon commercial questions and interests.  I have\r\nhabitually, in my annual visits to that city, visited the chamber\r\nof commerce, and said a few words on the topic of the times in\r\nwhich its members were interested, but never on politics.  Every\r\ndiversity of opinion was there represented.\r\n\r\nCincinnati, situated on the north bank of the Ohio River, with\r\nKentucky on the other side, and Indiana near by, with a large part\r\nof its population of German birth or descent, with every variety\r\nof race, creed and color, is thoroughly a cosmopolitan city, subject\r\nto sudden outbreaks and notable changes.  At the time of my visit\r\nit was especially disturbed by the agitation of the temperance\r\nquestion.  In discussing this, I took the same position as at\r\nFindlay, and found but little objection to it, but the opinions\r\nexpressed by speakers in other parts of the state in favor of\r\nprohibition had, as the election proved, a very bad effect upon\r\nthe Republican ticket.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of September I attended the state fair at Columbus.  It\r\nwas estimated that there were at least 40,000 people on the ground\r\nthat day.  It has been the habit to gather around the headquarters\r\nand press any public man who appeared to make a speech.  Governor\r\nFoster and I were together.  Mr. Cowden, the president of the fair,\r\nintroduced Foster and he made a brief address.  I was then introduced\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen:--It has been my good fortune to be able to\r\nvisit the state fair for many years in succession, but, from the\r\ngreat multitude of people, and the vast concourse before me, I\r\nshould say that Ohio is rapidly pressing onward in the march of\r\nprogress.  The gray beards I see before me, and I am among them now,\r\nremind me of the time when we were boys together; when, after a\r\nseason's weary labor, we were compelled to utilize our surplus\r\ncrops to pay our taxes.\"\r\n\r\nI contrasted the early days of Ohio with its condition then, and\r\nclosed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"But this is no time for speechmaking, nor the occasion for further\r\nremarks.  We have come out to show ourselves, and you do not desire\r\nspeeches, but you do most want to see the horses, cattle, sheep,\r\nhogs, and the implements that make the life of a farmer easier.\r\nThis is a progress that I love to see.  My countrymen, you are\r\ncrowned with blessings.  Enjoy them freely and gratefully, returning\r\nthanks to the Giver of all good gifts.  This is a free land, and\r\nthe agricultural masses are the freest, the noblest, and the best\r\nof all our race.  Enjoy your privileges to the highest point, and\r\nbe worthy followers of the great race of pioneers who came before\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of this canvass I spoke nearly every week day\r\nuntil the election, and in most of the congressional districts of\r\nthe state.  Some of these speeches were reported and circulated as\r\ncampaign documents.  As the election day approached the interest\r\nincreased, and the meetings grew to be immense gatherings.  This\r\nwas notably so at Toledo, Dayton, Portsmouth, Cleveland, Circleville\r\nand Zanesville.  I believed the Republican state ticket would be\r\nelected, but feared that the prohibition amendment would prevent\r\nthe election of a Republican legislature.  The result of the election\r\nfor governor was Hoadley 359,693, Foraker 347,164, and the general\r\nassembly elected contained a majority of Democrats in each branch.\r\nHenry B. Payne was, on the meeting of the legislature, elected\r\nSenator in the place then held by Geo. H. Pendleton.\r\n\r\nAfter the election I went to New York and was met everywhere with\r\ninquiries as to the causes of Republican defeat in Ohio.  I said\r\nthe Republicans were defeated because of the prohibition question\r\nand the law reducing the tariff on wool; that many Germans feared\r\nan invasion of their rights and an interference with their habits,\r\nand the farmers objected to the discrimination made by our tariff\r\nagainst their industries.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November, 1883, General Sherman relinquished command\r\nof the army, with the same simplicity and lack of display which\r\nhad characterized his official life at army headquarters.  He wrote\r\nthe following brief order:\r\n\r\n  \"Headquarters of the Army,    }\r\n  \"Washington, November 1, 1883.}\r\n\"_General Orders No. 77_.\r\n\r\n\"By and with the consent of the President, as contained in General\r\nOrders No. 71, of October 16, 1883, the undersigned relinquishes\r\ncommand of the army of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"In thus severing relations which have hitherto existed between\r\nus, he thanks all officers and men for their fidelity to the high\r\ntrust imposed on them during his official life, and will, in his\r\nretirement, watch with parental solicitude their progress upward\r\nin the noble profession to which they have devoted their lives.\r\n\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman, General.\r\n  \"Official:  R. C. Drum, Adjutant General.\"\r\n\r\nHe then rose from his desk, gave his seat to Sheridan, who at once\r\nissued his orders assuming his new duties, and the transfer was\r\ncompleted.  I know that when the bill for the retirement of officers\r\nat a specified age was pending, there was a strong desire in the\r\nSenate to except General Sherman from the operation of the law,\r\nbut the general, who was absent on the plains, telegraphed me not\r\nto allow an exception to be made in his favor, insisting that it\r\nwould be a discrimination against other officers of high merit.\r\nThereupon the Senate reluctantly yielded, but with a provision that\r\nhe should retain his salary as general, notwithstanding his\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nAt this period mention was again made in the newspapers of my name\r\nas the nominee of the Republican party for President in the next\r\nyear.  I promptly declared that I was not a candidate and had no\r\npurpose or desire to enter into the contest.  This discussion of\r\nmy name continued until the decision of the national convention,\r\nbut I took no part or lot in it, made no requests of anyone to\r\nsupport my nomination, and took no steps, directly or indirectly,\r\nto promote it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nEFFECT OF THE MARINE NATIONAL BANK AND OTHER FAILURES.\r\nContinued Prosperity of the Nation--Arthur's Report to Congress--\r\nResolution to Inquire into Election Outrages in Virginia and\r\nMississippi--Reports of the Investigating Committee--Financial\r\nQuestions Discussed During the Session--Duties and Privileges of\r\nSenators--Failure of the Marine National Bank and of Grant and Ward\r\nin New York--Followed By a Panic in Which Other Institutions Are\r\nWrecked--Timely Assistance from the New York Clearing House--Debate\r\nin the Senate on the National Bank System--Dedication of the John\r\nMarshall Statue at Washington--Defeat of Ingalls' Arrears of Pensions\r\nAmendment to Bill to Grant Pensions to Soldiers and Sailors of the\r\nMexican War--The Senate Listens to the Reading of the Declaration\r\nof Independence on July 4.\r\n\r\nThe message of President Arthur, submitted to Congress on the 4th\r\nof December, 1883, presented a condition of remarkable prosperity\r\nin the United States.  We were at peace and harmony with all nations.\r\nThe surplus revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883,\r\namounted to $134,178,756.96, all of which was applied to the\r\nreduction of the public debt.  It was estimated that the surplus\r\nrevenue for the then fiscal year would be $85,000,000, and for the\r\nnext fiscal year $60,000,000.  The President called the attention\r\nof Congress to the revenue act of July, 1883, which had reduced\r\nthe receipts of the government fifty or sixty million dollars.\r\nWhile he had no doubt that still further reductions might be wisely\r\nmade, he did not advise at that session a large diminution of the\r\nnational revenues.  The whole tenor of the message was conservative\r\nand hopeful.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, upon representations made to me and after full\r\nreflection, I felt compelled, by a sense of public duty, to institute\r\nan inquiry into events connected with recent elections held in the\r\nStates of Virginia and Mississippi.  I did so with extreme reluctance,\r\nfor I did not care to assume the labor of such an investigation.\r\nOn the 23rd of January, 1884, I introduced a preamble setting out\r\nin detail the general charges made as to events currently reported\r\nin the public press prior to the election in November, 1883, in\r\nDanville, Virginia, and Copiah county, Mississippi, with the\r\nfollowing resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the committee on privileges and elections be,\r\nand is hereby, instructed to inquire into all the circumstances of,\r\nand connected with, the said alleged events, and into the condition\r\nof the constitutional rights and securities before named of the\r\npeople of Virginia and Mississippi, and that it report, by bill or\r\notherwise, as soon as may be; and that it have the power to send\r\nfor persons and papers, and to sit during the sittings of the\r\nSenate, and that it may employ a stenographer or stenographers.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January I called up the resolution, and made the\r\nfollowing remarks explaining why I introduced the resolution and\r\nrequested an investigation:\r\n\r\n\"Since the beginning of the present session, I have felt that the\r\nrecent events in the States of Virginia and Mississippi were of\r\nsuch importance as to demand a full and impartial investigation of\r\nthe causes which led to them, of the real facts involved, and of\r\nthe proper constitutional remedy to prevent their recurrence, and,\r\nif necessary, to further secure to all American citizens freedom\r\nof speech in the open assertion of their political opinions and in\r\nthe peaceful exercise of their right to vote.\r\n\r\n\"Now that sufficient time has elapsed to allay to some extent the\r\nexcitement caused by these events, I hope the Senate will make this\r\ninvestigation, so that our citizens in every state may understand\r\nhow far the national government will protect them in the enjoyment\r\nof their rights, or, if it is helpless or listless, that, no longer\r\nrelying upon the barren declarations of the constitution, each man\r\nfor himself may appeal to the right of self-defense, or to the\r\nboasted American right of migration to more friendly regions.\r\n\r\n\"The allegations in this resolution as to the Danville riot, or\r\nmassacre, are founded upon statements in the public prints, supported\r\nby the oaths of witnesses, and their substantial truth is also\r\nverified by the published statement of a Member of this body, a\r\nSenator from the State of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"The allegations as to Mississippi are founded upon copious narratives\r\nin the public prints, the proceedings of public meetings, and the\r\nactions and failure to act of officers of the state government,\r\nincluding governors, judges, courts, and juries.\r\n\r\n\"I have not deemed it proper, at this stage of the investigation,\r\nif it is to be made, to enter into the details of the facts, although\r\nI have before me a voluminous collection of all these various\r\nstatements published in the papers of different political parties\r\nand from different persons.\r\n\r\n\"If these statements are true, then in both these states there have\r\nbeen organized conspiracies to subvert the freedom of elections,\r\naccompanied by murder and violence in many forms.  The crimes\r\ndepicted are not ordinary crimes, common in all societies where\r\nthe criminal falls under the ban of public justice, and is pursued\r\nby the officers of the law, tried, convicted, or acquitted; but\r\nthe crimes here alleged are that a prevailing majority subverts by\r\nviolence the highest constitutional rights and privileges of\r\ncitizens, and cannot, from their nature, be inquired of or punished\r\nby ordinary tribunals.  If they are true, then in those communities\r\nthe members of our party and one race have no rights which the\r\nprevailing party is bound to respect.\r\n\r\n\"It is not well to assume these allegations to be true without the\r\nfullest investigation and inquiry by the legislative power, for,\r\nif true, the gravest questions of public policy arise that we have\r\nbeen called upon to consider since the close of the Civil War.  I\r\nhave no desire to open up sectional questions or renew old strifes,\r\nbut would be glad to turn my back upon the past and devote myself\r\nto questions of peace, development, and progress.  Still, if these\r\nallegations are true, it would be a cowardly shrinking from the\r\ngravest public duty to allow such events to deepen into precedents\r\nwhich would subvert the foundation of republican institutions and\r\nconvert our elections into organized crimes.  I do not say these\r\nallegations are true, but they come to us with such apparent seeming\r\nof truth that we are bound to ascertain their truth or falsehood\r\nby the most careful and impartial inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"If the events at Danville were the results of a chance outbreak\r\nor riot between opposing parties or different races of men, they\r\nmay properly be left to be dealt with by the local authorities;\r\nbut if the riot and massacre were part of machinery, devised by a\r\nparty to deter another party, or a race, from the freedom of\r\nelections, or the free and open expression of political opinions,\r\nthen they constitute a crime against the national government, the\r\nhighest duty of which is to maintain, at every hazard, the equal\r\nrights and privileges of citizens.\r\n\r\n\"If the events in Copiah county, Mississippi (which is a large and\r\npopulous county containing twenty-seven thousand inhabitants, and\r\nevidently a very productive county), were merely lawless invasions\r\nof individual rights, then, though they involved murder as well as\r\nother crimes, they should be left to local authority, and if justice\r\ncannot be administered by the courts, and the citizen is without\r\nremedy from lawless violence, then he must fall back upon his right\r\nof self-defense, or, failing in that, he must seek a home where\r\nhis rights will be respected and observed.  But if these individual\r\ncrimes involve the greater one of an organized conspiracy of a\r\nparty, or a race, to deprive another party or race of citizens of\r\nthe enjoyment of their unquestioned rights, accompanied with overt\r\nacts, with physical power sufficient to accomplish their purpose,\r\nthen it becomes a national question which must be dealt with by\r\nthe national government.\r\n\r\n\"The war emancipated and made citizens of five million people who\r\nhad been slaves.  This was a national act, and whether wisely or\r\nimprudently done it must be respected by the people of all the\r\nstates.  If sought to be reversed in any degree by the people of\r\nany locality it is the duty of the national government to make\r\ntheir act respected by all its citizens.  It is not now a question\r\nas to the right to stop at an inn, or to ride in a car, or to cross\r\na bridge, but it is whether the people of any community can, by\r\norganized fraud, terror, or violence, prevent a party or a race of\r\ncitizens from voting at an election, or the expression of opinions,\r\nor deny to them the equal protection of the law.  No court has ever\r\ndenied the power of the national government to protect its citizens\r\nin their essential rights as freemen.  No man should be allowed to\r\nhold a seat in either House of Congress whose election was secured\r\nby crimes such as are depicted here.\r\n\r\n\"Nor is it sufficient to say that the elections referred to were\r\nnot national elections in the sense that they did not involve the\r\nelection of a President or a Member of Congress.  While the power\r\nof Congress over the election of Senators, Representatives, and\r\nthe President extends to making and altering laws and regulations\r\npassed by the respective states, and therefore is fuller than in\r\nrespect to state elections, yet the constitution provides that 'The\r\nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\r\nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\r\nbe violated;' that 'All persons born or naturalized in the United\r\nStates, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of\r\nthe United States;' that 'No state shall make or enforce any law\r\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of\r\nthe United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any\r\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws;'\r\nand that 'The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall\r\nnot be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any state,\r\non account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.'\r\nIt was also declared that 'Congress shall have power to make all\r\nlaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\r\nthe foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution\r\nin the government of the United States, or in any department or\r\noffice thereof.'  Power is also given to Congress to enforce the\r\nrecent amendments by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n\"If the essential rights of citizenship are overthrown by a state\r\nor by the people of a state, with the sanction of the local\r\nauthorities within the limits of a state, then Congress, as the\r\nlegislative power of the United States, is bound to provide additional\r\nsafeguards, and should exhaust all the powers of the United States\r\ngovernment to maintain these essential rights of citizenship within\r\nthe limits of all the states, in as full and complete a manner as\r\nit will guard and protect the unquestioned rights of citizens of\r\nthe United States within the domains of the most powerful nations\r\nof the world.  Surely a citizen of the United States has as much\r\nright in any one of the states as he would have in a foreign land,\r\nhowever remote or however powerful its government may be.  Protection\r\nat home in the secure enjoyment of the rights of person and property\r\nis the foundation of all human government, without which its forms\r\nare a mockery and with which mere forms of government become a\r\nmatter of indifference.  Protection goes with allegiance, and\r\nallegiance ceases to be a duty when protection is denied.\r\n\r\n\"I can appreciate the great change that has occurred in the southern\r\nstates, the natural antagonisms which would raise by the emancipated\r\nslaves mingling in the same community with their former masters,\r\nwith equal civil and political rights with those who had held them\r\nas slaves; I can pardon the prejudices of race, of caste, and even\r\nof local ties; and the American people have, I think, waited with\r\ngreat forbearance, waited patiently for the time when constitutional\r\nrights would be respected without regard to race, or color, or\r\ncreed, or party.  If the time has come, as alleged in the papers\r\nbefore me, when members of the Republican party, through whose\r\nagency largely the existence of the government has been maintained\r\nintact over the broad extent of our country, cannot express their\r\nfree opinions, cannot enjoy their constitutional rights, are murdered\r\nat the ballot box without fear on the part of their murderers of\r\npunishment, and driven from their homes by outrage and terror, and\r\nthat white and black alike are subject to ostracism and injustice,\r\nand as a party are disfranchised in large portions of the regions\r\nwhere in war they asserted and maintained the powers of the national\r\ngovernment, then indeed is patient inquiry demanded, and a full,\r\nopen, and manly assertion that the rights and equalities of citizens\r\nshall be maintained and enforced at every hazard.\r\n\r\n\"If the Copiah resolutions are the creed of the Democratic party\r\nin the south, then indeed the war is a failure, and we must expect\r\nagain the fierce sectional excitement, deepened by injury and\r\ndisappointment.  Written in the light of the events alleged to have\r\ntranspired in the presence of the men who wrote and adopted these\r\nresolutions, they seem to me the very germ of despotism and barbarity,\r\nand yet I am assured by a gentleman friendly to them that they are\r\nthe creed of nine-tenths of the party in power in Mississippi.  I\r\nshould like to know--it is right that we should learn--the groundwork\r\nof opinions so utterly repugnant to republican institutions.\r\n\r\n\"In this investigation I would seek every palliation or excuse for\r\nthe conduct of the people complained of.  I would give to their\r\nmotives and to the natural feelings of mankind in their situation\r\nthe most charitable construction.  I would give to them all political\r\npower they ever enjoyed, and, without unkindness, or pains, or\r\npenalties, or even reproaches, I would extend to them every right,\r\nfavor, or facility, that is enjoyed by any citizen in any part of\r\nour country; but when this concession is made to them I would demand\r\nthat in the states under their control the freedom and equality of\r\nrights and privileges guaranteed by the constitution and the laws\r\nto all citizens, white or black, native or naturalized, poor or\r\nrich, ignorant or learned, Republican or Democrat, shall be secured\r\nby the state government, or, if not, that their rights and privileges\r\nshall be asserted and maintained by the national government.  Upon\r\nthis issue I would appeal to every generous-minded man, to every\r\nlover of his country, to everyone who wishes to enjoy his own rights\r\nby his own fireside, free from embarrassment, to stand by those\r\nwho, yielding to others the protection of the laws in the enjoyment\r\nof equal rights, will demand the same for themselves and for their\r\nassociates.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Mahone made a long and interesting speech in respect to\r\nthe Danville election.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted by a party vote, yeas 33, nays 29.  As\r\nthe investigation ordered embraced two distinct series of events,\r\nthey were separately considered and reported upon by the committee\r\non privileges and elections.  Mr. Hoar was chairman of the committee.\r\nI was a member of the committee and assumed the chief work in the\r\nexamination of witnesses as to the events in Danville.  Mr. Lapham\r\nprepared the majority report, and Mr. Vance the report of the\r\nminority.  These reports, with the testimony taken, were printed\r\nin a document containing 1,300 pages.  The Copiah county matter\r\nwas referred to another sub-committee.  As no affirmative action\r\nwas taken on these reports, I do not care to recite at any length\r\neither the report or the evidence, but it is sufficient to say that\r\nthe allegations made in the preamble of the resolution were\r\nsubstantially sustained by the testimony.  There was a deliberate\r\neffort on the part of the Democrats at Danville, and in other parts\r\nof Virginia, to prevent the negroes from voting, and preceding the\r\nNovember election this movement was organized by the formation of\r\nclubs, and every means were adopted to intimidate and suppress the\r\nRepublican vote.  A letter, called the Danville circular, was\r\nprepared and issued to the southwest valley of Virginia, containing\r\nthe most inflammatory language, evidently intended to deter the\r\nnegroes from voting.\r\n\r\nThe incidents connected with the Danville massacre preceding the\r\nelection were very fully stated in the report, and established\r\nclearly that the massacre was planned at a Democratic meeting at\r\nthe opera house, at which five hundred or more had assembled.  A\r\nscuffle grew out of a pretended quarrel between Noel and Lawson,\r\ntwo white men, and revolvers were drawn and warning given to the\r\ncolored men to stand back or they would every one of them be killed.\r\nA colored policeman endeavored to separate the two men who were\r\nfighting, and soon after there was a general firing from pistols\r\nand guns by white men at the negroes, the number of shots being\r\nvariously estimated at from 75 to 250.  The negroes fled.  There\r\nwas no evidence that the negroes fired a shot until after the whites\r\nfired a general volley at them, and the weight of the evidence was\r\nthat very few had any weapons, that they had gathered there in\r\ntheir working clothes as they had come out of the factories, of\r\nall ages and both sexes, unquestionably from curiosity and not with\r\nany view of violence or preparation for it.  The whites, on the\r\ncontrary, were generally armed, were expecting an outbreak and\r\nobviously seeking a pretext for resorting to violence.  Many of\r\nthe whites emptied their revolvers and the evidence showed that\r\nCaptain Graves reloaded his.  There was conflicting evidence as to\r\nthe negroes having arms.  Only one was shown to have exhibited any\r\nbefore the firing, and the colored witnesses and many of the whites,\r\nincluding some of the policemen, said they saw no arms in the hands\r\nof the colored men except the one named, and there was no reliable\r\nevidence that he fired.  There was no evidence to be relied upon\r\nthat any of the colored men fired, except some witnesses stated\r\nthat the colored men, as they were running, fired over their\r\nshoulders.  The evidence tended to show that the violence was\r\npremeditated, with the avowed purpose of intimidation.\r\n\r\nI do not follow this investigation further, as no doubt the condition\r\nof affairs which led to it is now changed.  The result was the\r\nmurder of four unoffending colored men and the wounding of many\r\nothers.  The evidence seemed entirely clear that it was the\r\nconsummation of a deliberate purpose, for which the Democratic\r\nclubs had fully prepared.\r\n\r\nI believe that the investigation, while it led to no important\r\nmeasure, had a good effect, not only in Danville, but throughout\r\nthe south.  The problem of the two races living together in the\r\nsame community with equal political rights is a difficult one, and\r\nhas come to be regarded by men of all parties as one that can only\r\nbe settled by each state or community for itself.  It is impossible\r\nfor a government like ours, with limited powers, to undertake the\r\nprotection of life and property in any of the states except where\r\nresistance is made to national authority.  All the signs indicate\r\nthat a better feeling now exists between the two races, and their\r\ncommon interests will lead both to divide on questions of public\r\npolicy, without regard to race or color.\r\n\r\nAmong the bills passed on this Congress was one introduced by Mr.\r\nBlair, of New Hampshire, and chiefly advocated by him, to aid in\r\nthe establishment and temporary support of common schools.  It\r\nprovided for the appropriation of $120,000,000 to be distributed\r\namong the states upon the basis of illiteracy, $15,000,000 for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year, and a smaller sum each year for fifteen years,\r\nuntil the total sum was exhausted.  The apportionment proposed\r\nwould have given to the southern states $11,318,394 out of the\r\n$15,000,000.  The money was not to be disbursed by the United\r\nStates, but was to be placed in the hands of state authorities.\r\nThe object designed of diminishing illiteracy in the south, especially\r\namong the freedmen, was no doubt a laudable one, but the measure\r\nproposed was so radical and burdensome, and so unequal in its\r\napportionment among the states, that I assumed it would be defeated,\r\nbut it passed the Senate by a large majority.  The advocates of a\r\nstrict construction of the constitution voted for it in spite of\r\ntheir theories.  The bill, however, was defeated in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nAn interesting debate arose between Mr. Beck and myself, during\r\nthis session, upon the question of the sinking fund, which he seemed\r\nto regard as a part of the public debt.  It is, in fact, only a\r\ntreasury statement of the debt to be paid each year, and the amount\r\nactually paid.  In 1862, when the war was flagrant, Congress provided\r\nthat one per cent. of the principal of the public debt should be\r\npaid each year as a \"sinking fund.\"  While the United States was\r\nborrowing large sums and issuing its bonds, it was folly to pay\r\noutstanding bonds, and this was not done until 1868, when the\r\ntreasury was receiving more money than it disbursed.  In the\r\nmeantime, the treasury charged to the \"sinking fund,\" annually,\r\nthe sum of one per cent. of the amount of outstanding securities\r\nof the United States.  When the receipts exceeded expenditures, so\r\nmuch of the balance on hand as was not needed was applied to the\r\npurchase of bonds, and such bonds were canceled and the amount paid\r\nwas placed to the credit of this fund.  In the general prosperity\r\nthat followed, and until 1873, the sums thus credited increased so\r\nthat the amount of bonds paid was equal to, if not in excess of,\r\nthe annual charge against that fund, and the amount charged against\r\nit prior to 1868.  When the financial panic of 1873 occurred, the\r\nrevenues fell off so that they were insufficient to meet current\r\nexpenditures.  This prevented any credits to the sinking fund until\r\n1878, when the pendulum swung the other way, and the fund was\r\nrapidly diminished by the bonds purchased from the surplus revenue,\r\nand credited to the fund, so that when Mr. Beck interrogated me I\r\nwas able to say that the sinking fund had to its credit a considerable\r\nsum; in other words, the United States had paid its debt more\r\nrapidly than it had agreed to pay it.  The term \"sinking fund,\" as\r\napplied to the national accounts, is a misleading phrase.  It is\r\na mere statement whether we have or have not paid one per centum\r\nof the public debt each year.  There is no actual fund of the kind\r\nin existence for national purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother financial question was presented at this session and before\r\nand since.  The national banking act, when it passed in 1863,\r\nprovided that the circulating notes of national banks should be\r\nissued for only ninety per cent. of the amount of United States\r\nbonds deposited in the treasury for their security.  At that time\r\nbonds were worth in the market about fifty per cent. in coin, or\r\npar in United States notes.  Soon after the war, bonds advanced\r\nfar above par in coin and have been worth thirty per cent. premium.\r\nYet, in spite of this, Congress has repeatedly refused to allow\r\nnotes to be issued by national banks, to the par value of bonds\r\ndeposited on security, thus limiting the amount of bank notes\r\nunreasonably.  I introduced a bill early at this session to correct\r\nthis.  It passed the Senate, but was ignored in the House.  The\r\nsame result has happened at nearly every Congress since, even when\r\nthe bonds were so high as to deter the issue of bank notes when\r\nthey were greatly needed.\r\n\r\nDuring this session a delicate question arose whether a Senator\r\ncould refuse to vote when his name was called, and he was present\r\nin the Senate.  The Senate being so closely divided a few Senators\r\nmight, by refusing to answer to their names, suspend the business\r\nof the Senate when a quorum was present.  Mr. Bayard and myself\r\nagreed that such a practice would be a breach of public duty, which\r\nthe Senate might punish.  Senators may retire from the Chamber,\r\nbut the Senate can compel their attendance.  If a case should arise\r\nwhere a Senator, being present, and not paired, should, without\r\ngood reason, refuse to vote, he should be censured.  The increase\r\nin the number of Senators makes this question one of importance,\r\nbut I hope the time will never come when it practically shall arise.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is properly a very conservative body, and never yields\r\na custom until it is demonstrated to be an abuse.  The committee\r\non appropriations is a very important one.  It is always composed\r\nof experienced Senators, who are careful in making appropriations,\r\nbut there are appropriations which ought not to be referred to\r\nthem.  Their chief duty is performed in the closing days of the\r\nsession, when all business is hurried, and they have little time\r\nto enter into details.  They are entirely familiar with the great\r\nappropriations for the support of the government, and can best\r\njudge in respect to them, but there are other appropriations which\r\nought to be passed upon by committees specially appointed for\r\nspecific duties, like that of the District of Columbia.  No reason\r\ncan be given why these appropriations should not be acted upon by\r\nsuch committees.  It is true that the appropriation committee ought\r\nto simply report such sums as are necessary to carry into execution\r\nexisting laws.  That is their function, according to the rules,\r\nand that function they can perform very well in regard to such\r\nexpenditures; but the expenditures of the government for the\r\nDistrict, rivers and harbors, fortifications, pensions, and certain\r\nother objects, are not defined or regulated by law.  In the case\r\nof the District of Columbia, a few officers named in the appropriation\r\nbill are provided for by law, but the great body of the expenditures\r\nis for streets, alleys and public improvement, nine-tenths of all\r\nthe appropriations made for the District being, in their nature,\r\nnew items not fixed by existing law.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of May, 1884, the country was startled by the failure\r\nof the Marine National Bank of New York, an institution that had\r\nbeen in high credit and standing.  The circumstances connected with\r\nthe failure excited a great deal of interest and profound surprise.\r\nImmediately in connection with the failure of this bank the banking\r\nfirm of Grant & Ward, in the city of New York, failed for a large\r\namount.  Their business was complicated with that of the Marine\r\nNational Bank, and disclosures were made which not only aroused\r\nindignation but almost created a panic in the city of New York.\r\n\r\nAlmost contemporaneous with this the insolvency of the Second\r\nNational Bank of New York, for a very large sum, became public,\r\nand the alleged gross misconduct of the president of that bank,\r\nJohn C. Eno, became a matter of public notoriety.  Steps were taken\r\nby the officers and stockholders of the bank, including the father\r\nof the president, to relieve it from bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAlso, and in connection with the failure of the Marine National\r\nBank, there were disclosed financial operations of a strange and\r\nextraordinary character of the president of that bank, James D.\r\nFish.  All these events coming together caused much excitement and\r\ndisturbance in New York.  They led to a great fall of securities,\r\nto a want of confidence, and to a general run, as it is called,\r\nupon banks and banking institutions, including the savings banks.\r\nIt appeared as if there were to be a general panic, a financial\r\nrevulsion, and wide-reaching distress.\r\n\r\nAt that time also, and in connection with the other events, came\r\nthe temporary suspension of the Metropolitan National Bank, one of\r\nthe oldest, largest, and in former times considered among the best,\r\nof all the banks in the city of New York.  This was partly caused\r\nby rumors and stories of large railroad operations and indebtedness\r\nof Mr. Seney, the president of the bank, which resulted in a gradual\r\ndrawing upon the bank.\r\n\r\nAt once the Secretary of the Treasury did what he could to relieve\r\nthe money market, by prepaying bonds which had been called in the\r\nprocess of the payment of the public debt; but the principal relief\r\ngiven to the market at that time was the action of the Clearing\r\nHouse Association of New York, by the issue of over $24,000,000 of\r\nclearing house certificates.  This was purely a defensive operation\r\nadopted by the associated banks of New York, fifteen of which are\r\nstate institutions and the balance national banks.\r\n\r\nAll that was done in New York to prevent a panic was done by the\r\nbanks themselves.  The government of the United States had no lot\r\nor parcel in it except so far as the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nprepaid bonds that had already been called, a transaction which\r\nhas been done a hundred times.  So far as the government was\r\nconcerned it had nothing to do with these banks; the measures of\r\nrelief were furnished by the banks themselves.\r\n\r\nThis condition of financial affairs led to a long debate in the\r\nSenate, commencing on the 17th of June, on the merits and demerits\r\nof the system of national banks, and especially of the clearing\r\nhouse of the city of New York.  The comptroller of the currency\r\nhad taken active and efficient measures to protect the interests\r\nof the United States.  He was called before the committee on finance\r\nand gave a full statement of these measures.  It was apparent that\r\nthe temporary panic grew out of the reckless and criminal conduct\r\nof a few men and not from defects in the national bank system or\r\nthe clearing house.  The debate that followed, in the Senate, was\r\nmainly between Morgan, Beck and myself.  I stated fully the methods\r\nof conducting the business of the clearing house, a corporation of\r\nthe State of New York, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As the prosecution against John C. Eno is now pending in Canada,\r\na foreign country, as a matter of course no one can state what will\r\nbe the result of it.  We only know that proper legal proceedings\r\nare now being urged to have an extradition, and if he is brought\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the courts as a matter of course the\r\nprosecution can then be pushed.  So with James D. Fish.  Indictments\r\nhave been had and are now pending against him for a violation, not\r\nonly of the national banking act, but I believe also for a violation\r\nof the state law; and the same is to be said of Ferdinand Ward.\r\nThese three persons are the only ones who have been charged with\r\nfraudulent and illegal transactions leading to these financial\r\ndisasters.  The Metropolitan bank, thanks to the agency and the\r\naid that was given in a trying time, in now going on and doing\r\nbusiness as of old, no doubt having met with large losses.\r\n\r\n\"It is a matter of satisfaction that with the single exception of\r\nthe Marine Bank, of New York, no national bank has been overwhelmed\r\nby this disaster.  It is true that the Second National Bank was\r\nbankrupted by the crimes and wrongs of John C. Eno, but his father,\r\nwith a sensitive pride not to allow innocent persons to suffer from\r\nthe misconduct of his son, with a spirit really worthy of commendation,\r\nhere or anywhere else, threw a large sum of money into the maelstrom\r\nand saved not only the credit of the bank and advanced his own\r\ncredit, but to some extent, as far as he could at least, expiated\r\nthe fault, the folly, and the crime of his son.  The Metropolitan\r\nBank is relieved from its embarrassments by its associate banks.\r\nThe losses caused by the speculations of its president did not\r\nentirely fall upon the bank.  That bank, now relived from the\r\npressure of unexpected demands, is pursuing its even tenor.  It\r\nseems to me that all these facts taken together show the strength\r\nand confidence that may well be reposed in the national banking\r\nsystem.  The law cannot entirely prevent fraud and crime, but it\r\nhas guarded the public from the results of such offense far better\r\nthan any previous system.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, 1884, which happened to be my birthday, the\r\nstatue of John Marshall, formerly Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates, was dedicated.  This is a bronze statue in a sitting posture,\r\nerected by the bar of Philadelphia and the Congress of the United\r\nStates.  A fund had been collected shortly after the death of\r\nMarshall, but it was insufficient to erect a suitable monument,\r\nand it was placed in the hands of trustees and invested as \"The\r\nMarshall Memorial Fund.\"  On the death of the last of the trustees,\r\nPeter McCall, it was found that the fund had, by honest stewardship,\r\nincreased sevenfold its original amount.  This sum, with an equal\r\namount appropriated by Congress, was applied to the erection of a\r\nstatue to the memory of Chief Justice Marshall, to be placed in a\r\nsuitable reservation in the city of Washington.  The artist who\r\nexecuted this work was W. W. Story, a son of the late Justice Story\r\nof the Supreme Court.  I was chairman of the joint committee on\r\nthe library and presided on the occasion.  Chief Justice Waite\r\ndelivered an appropriate address.  He was followed by William Henry\r\nRawle, of Philadelphia, in an eloquent oration, closing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"And for what in his life he did for us, let there be lasting\r\nmemory.  He and the men of his time have passed away; other\r\ngenerations have succeeded them; other phases of our country's\r\ngrowth have come and gone; other trials, greater a hundredfold than\r\nhe or they could possibly have imagined, have jeoparded the nation's\r\nlife; but still that which they wrought remains to us, secured by\r\nthe same means, enforced by the same authority, dearer far for all\r\nthat is past, and holding together a great, a united and happy\r\npeople.  And all largely because he whose figure is now before us\r\nhas, above and beyond all others, taught the people of the United\r\nStates, in words of absolute authority, what was the constitution\r\nwhich they ordained, 'in order to form a perfect union, establish\r\njustice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,\r\npromote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty\r\nto themselves and their posterity.'\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore, with all gratitude, with fitting ceremony and circumstance;\r\nin the presence of the highest in the land; in the presence of those\r\nwho make, of those who execute, and of those who interpret, the\r\nlaws; in the presence of those descendants in whose veins flows\r\nMarshall's blood, have the bar and the Congress of the United States\r\nhere set up this semblance of his living form, in perpetual memory\r\nof the honor, the reverence and the love which the people of this\r\ncountry bear to the great chief justice.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this session Mr. Ingalls offered to a House bill granting\r\na pension to soldiers and sailors of the Mexican War, the following\r\namendment:\r\n\r\n\"That all pensions which have been or which may hereafter be granted\r\nin consequence of death occurring from a cause which originated in\r\nthe service since the 4th day of March, 1861, or in consequence of\r\nwounds or injuries received or disease contracted since that date\r\nin the service and in the line of duty, shall commence from the\r\ndeath or discharge of the person on whose account the claim has\r\nbeen or is hereafter granted, if the disability occurred prior to\r\ndischarge, and if such disability occurred after the discharge,\r\nthen from the date of actual disability, or from the termination\r\nof the right of the party having prior title to such pension.\"\r\n\r\nI opposed this sweeping provision with much reluctance, as I have\r\nalways favored the granting of the most liberal pensions consistent\r\nwith the public interests.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"I regret very much to oppose any proposition that is favored by\r\nthe Union soldiers of the American army; and I perhaps should feel\r\nsome hesitation in doing it, only that I know very well that the\r\nsoldiers themselves, like all other citizens, are divided in opinion\r\nas to this measure.\r\n\r\n\"This proposition repeals all restrictions as to time upon applications\r\nto be made for arrears of pensions, and extends to all persons back\r\nto the war or date of discharge or disability, not only of those\r\nwho have heretofore applied, but of those who may hereafter apply.\r\nIt removes absolutely all restrictions upon the applications for\r\narrears of pensions.  And if this only involved ten or even twenty\r\nmillion dollars, I might still hesitate, because I have always,\r\nsince the close of the war, voted for every measure that has been\r\noffered in good faith for the benefit of the Union soldiers.  My\r\nheart, my feelings are all with them.  I appreciate the value of\r\ntheir services, the enormous benefits they have conferred upon the\r\npeople of the America for generations yet unborn, and I hesitate\r\ntherefore to oppose any wish that they may express through their\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\"This measure involves an immense sum of money.  That alone would\r\nnot be conclusive.  But here is a motion made by a Senator, without\r\nthe report or sanction of any committee of this body, to put upon\r\nthe people of the United States a great demand, ranging anywhere\r\nup to $246,000,000, a proposition so indefinite in character that\r\nthe commissioner of pensions is utterly unable to give us any\r\napproximate estimate, but gives his guess as near as he can.  He\r\nsays that this proposition will involve the expenditure of\r\n$246,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ingalls made a sturdy effort for his amendment, and quoted a\r\ndeclaration of the Republican national convention in favor of\r\narrears of pensions, to which I replied that, when I remembered\r\nthat the platform of the last Republican convention had been made\r\nup in a few hours, on a sweltering hot day, by forty-two men hastily\r\ncalled together, most of whom never saw each other before, I did\r\nnot think it ought to be taken as a guide for Senators in the\r\nperformance of their public duties.\r\n\r\nAfter full discussion the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMy position was highly commended by the public press and by many\r\ndistinguished soldiers, including Governor Foraker, who wrote me,\r\nsaying:  \"It may be some gratification to you to know that your\r\ncourse, in regard to the pension bill, meets with the earnest\r\napproval of all right-minded men in this part of the state.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of July the following resolution was adopted by the\r\nSenate on my motion:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Senate will meet at the usual hour on Friday,\r\nthe 4th day of July instant, and, after the reading of the journal\r\nand before other business is done, the secretary of the Senate\r\nshall read the Declaration of American Independence.\"\r\n\r\nOn introducing the resolution, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Never till during our Civil War, so far as the records show or as\r\nis known or is recollected, did Congress meet on the 4th of July.\r\nDuring the Civil War we did meet habitually on the 4th of July,\r\nbut it was only on the ground that those who had control then\r\nbelieved that the business then requiring attention was proper to\r\nbe done on the 4th of July.  We have only met once since on the\r\n4th of July, and that was in 1870, at a time of great political\r\nexcitement.  An effort was made to adjourn when the Senate met that\r\nday, but the session was continued--a long, exciting, and unpleasant\r\nsession--on the 4th of July, 1870.\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt that to-morrow it will be well to sit, because the\r\ncommittees of conference are carrying on their business and I have\r\nno objection to sitting; but I think we ought to recognize, by\r\ncommon consent, the importance of the day and the fact that it is\r\na national anniversary celebrated all over the United States, by\r\nreading that immortal paper which is the foundation of American\r\nindependence.\"\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned July 7, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nMY PARTICIPATION IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 1884.\r\nAgain Talked of as a Republican Candidate for the Presidency--I\r\nHave no Desire for the Nomination--Blaine the Natural Candidate of\r\nthe Party--My Belief that Arthur Would be Defeated if Nominated--\r\nSpeech at Washington, D. C., for Blaine and Logan--Opening of the\r\nOhio Campaign at Ashland--Success of the Republican State Ticket\r\nin October--Speeches in Boston, Springfield, Mass., New York and\r\nBrooklyn--Address to Business Men in Faneuil Hall--Success of the\r\nNational Democratic Ticket--Arthur's Annual Message to Congress--\r\nSecretary McCulloch's Recommendations Concerning the Further Coinage\r\nof Silver Dollars--Statement of My Views at This Time--Statue to\r\nthe Memory of General Lafayette--Controversy Between General Sherman\r\nand Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of June, 1884, during the session of Congress, the\r\nnational Republican convention to nominate Republican candidates\r\nfor President and Vice President, was held at Chicago.  Prior to\r\nthat time the papers had been full of the merits and demerits of\r\ncandidates, and my name was mentioned among them.  I had early\r\nannounced, in interviews and letters, that I was not a candidate.\r\nThe following statement was generally published in Ohio:\r\n\r\n\"I am in no sense a candidate, and would not make an effort for\r\nthe nomination.  I would not even express my opinion as to who\r\nshould be delegates from my own district or what their action should\r\nbe.  Four years ago I thought it best to be a candidate.  I believed\r\nthat the logic of events at that time justified such action.  The\r\nreasons I need not state.  Now there is no such condition and I\r\nwould not enter a contest even for the indorsement of my own\r\nconstituency.  Many of my friends write me complaining letters\r\nbecause I refuse to make such an issue.  Believing that the\r\nconvention, when it meets, should be free, uninstructed, and in\r\nshape to do the very best thing for the whole party, I have counseled\r\nby friends to that end.  A united and enthusiastic party is more\r\nimportant than one man, and hence I am for bending every energy to\r\nthe first purpose, and am not a candidate.\"\r\n\r\nI had not expressed the slightest desire to make such a contest.\r\nWhen approached by personal friends I dissuaded them from using my\r\nname as a candidate.  I neither asked nor sought anyone to be a\r\ndelegate.  When the convention met, the Ohio delegation was divided\r\nbetween Blaine and myself, and this necessarily prevented any\r\nconsiderable support of me outside of the state.  I was not sorry\r\nfor it.  I regarded the nomination of Blaine as the natural result\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Arthur, his principal competitor, grew out of his\r\npower and patronage as President.  He was a gentleman of pleasing\r\nmanners, but I thought unequal to the great office he held.  He\r\nhad never been distinguished in political life.  The only office\r\nhe had held of any importance was that of collector of the port of\r\nNew York, from which he was removed for good causes already stated.\r\nHis nomination as Vice President was the whim of Roscoe Conkling\r\nto strike at President Hayes.  If nominated he would surely have\r\nbeen defeated.  In the then condition of political affairs it is\r\nnot certain that any Republican would have been elected.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the nomination of Blaine was the strong opposition\r\nto him in the State of New York.  The selection by the Democratic\r\nconvention of Grover Cleveland as the candidate for President, and\r\nof Thomas A. Hendricks for Vice President, was made in view of the\r\nnecessity of carrying the two doubtful States of New York and\r\nIndiana, which it was well understood would determine the election.\r\n\r\nI promptly took an active part in support of the Republican ticket.\r\nA meeting to ratify the nomination of James G. Blaine and John A.\r\nLogan was held at Washington, D. C., on the 19th of June, at which\r\nI made a speech, which, as reported, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the curious customs of American politics that when\r\nanybody is nominated for office, his competitors are the first to\r\nbe called upon to vouch for the wisdom of the choice.  Perhaps that\r\nis the reason I am called upon now.  Though I did not consider\r\nmyself as much of a candidate, I am ready to accept, approve and\r\nratify the action of the Chicago convention.  I will support the\r\nnomination of Blaine and Logan as heartily as I have done those of\r\nFremont and Lincoln and Grant and Hayes and Garfield.  And this I\r\nwould do, fellow-citizens, even if they were less worthy than I\r\nknow them to be of the distinguished honor proposed for them.  I\r\nwould do it for my own honor.  I have no patience with any man who,\r\nfor himself or any other person, would take his chances for success\r\nin a political convention, and when disappointed would seek to\r\nthwart the action of the convention.  Political conventions are\r\nindispensable in a republican government, for it is only by such\r\nagencies, that opposing theories can be brought to the popular\r\njudgment.  These can only be presented by candidates chosen as\r\nstandard bearers of a flag, or a cause, or a party.\r\n\r\n\"That Blaine and Logan have been fairly nominated by the free choice\r\nof our 800 delegates, representing the Republicans of every state,\r\ncounty and district in the broad extent of our great country, is\r\nadmitted by every man whose voice has been heard.  They are not\r\n'dark horses.'  Their names are known to fame; the evil and good\r\nthat men could say of them have been said with a license that is\r\na shame to free discussion.  Traveling in peace and in war through\r\nthe memorable events of a quarter of a century, they have kept\r\ntheir place in the busy jostling of political life well in the\r\nforeground.  And now they have been selected from among millions\r\nof their countrymen to represent--not themselves, but the Republican\r\nparty of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"They represent the American Union, one and indivisible, snatched\r\nby war from the perils of secession and disunion.  They represent\r\na strong national government, able, I trust, in time, not only to\r\nprotect our citizens from foreign tyranny, but from local cruelty,\r\nintolerance, and oppression.\r\n\r\n\"They represent that party in the country which would scorn to\r\nobtain or hold power by depriving, by crime and fraud, more than\r\na million of men of their equal rights as citizens.  They represent\r\na party that would give to the laboring men of our country the\r\nprotection of our revenue laws against undue competition with\r\nforeign labor.\r\n\r\n\"They represent the power, the achievements, and the aspirations\r\nof the Republican party that now for twenty-four years has been\r\ngreatly trusted by the people, and in return has greatly advanced\r\nyour country in strength and wealth, intelligence, courage and\r\nhope, and in the respect and wonder of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow Republicans, we are about to enter into no holiday contest.\r\nYou have to meet the same forces and principles that opposed the\r\nUnion army in war; that opposed the abolition of slavery; that\r\nsought to impair the public credit; that resisted the resumption\r\nof specie payment.  They are recruited here and there by a deserter\r\nfrom our ranks, but meanwhile a generation of younger men are coming\r\nto the front, in the south as well as in the north.  They have been\r\neducated amidst memorable events with patriotic ardor, love of\r\ncountry, pride in its strength and power.  They are now determined\r\nto overthrow the narrow Bourbon sectionalism of the Democratic\r\nparty.  They live in the mountains and plains of the west.  They\r\nbreathe the fresh air of Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.\r\nThey are the hardy, liberty-loving laborers of every state.\r\n\r\n\"They come from the fatherland, they come from old Ireland.  They\r\nare the active spirits, native and naturalized, of a generation of\r\nfree men who never felt the incubus of slavery, and who wish only\r\nas Americans to make stronger and plant deeper the principles of\r\nthe Republican party.  It is to these men we who have grown old in\r\nthis conflict wish now to hand over the banner we have borne.  Let\r\nthem take it and advance it to higher honors.  Let them spread the\r\ninfluence of our republican institutions north and south, until\r\nthe whole continent of America shall be a brotherhood of republics.\r\n\r\n\"Let them assert the rights of American citizenship, so that they\r\nwill be respected as were the rights of citizens of the Roman\r\nrepublic.  Let them deal with this most difficult and subtle problem\r\nof social politics so as to secure to the man who labors his just\r\nshare of the fruits of his labor.  Let them improve even upon the\r\nprotective policy we have pursued, so as to diversify our industries\r\nand plant in all parts of our country the workshops of millions of\r\nwell-paid contented citizens.  Let them do what we have not been\r\nable to do since the war--restore our commerce to every port and\r\nprotect it under our flag in every sea.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen, I regret to say it, you cannot accomplish any of\r\nthese great objects of national desire through the agency of the\r\nDemocratic party.  It cannot be made an instrument of progress and\r\nreform.  Its traditions, its history for twenty-five years, and\r\nits composition, forbid it.  You may punish us for our shortcomings\r\nby its success, but you will punish yourselves as well and stay\r\nthe progress of your country.  A party that with seventy majority\r\nin the House cannot pass a bill on any subject of party politics,\r\ngreat or small, is not fit to govern the country.\r\n\r\n\"Every advance, every reform, every improvement, the protection of\r\nyour labor, the building of your navy, the assertion of your rights\r\nas a free man, the maintenance of good money--a good dollar, good\r\nin every land, worth a dollar in gold--all these objects of desire\r\nmust await the movements of the Republican party.  It may be slow,\r\nbut if you turn to the Democratic party you will always find it\r\nwatching and waiting, good, steady citizens of the olden time,\r\ngrounded on the resolutions of '98 and the 'times before the wah.'\r\n\r\n\"It is said that Blaine is bold and aggressive; that he will obstruct\r\nthe business interests of the country.  I would like to try such\r\na President.  He might shake off some of the cobwebs of diplomacy\r\nand invite the attention of mankind to the existence of this country.\r\nThere will always be conservatism enough in Congress, and inertness\r\nenough in the Democratic party, to hold in check even as brilliant\r\na man as James G. Blaine.  What we want now is an American policy\r\nbroad enough to embrace the continent, conservative enough to\r\nprotect the rights of every man, poor as well as rich, and brave\r\nenough to do what is right, whatever stands in the way.  We want\r\nprotection to American citizens and protection to American laborers,\r\na free vote and a fair count, an assertion of all the powers of\r\nthe government in doing what is right.  It is because I believe\r\nthat the administration of Blaine and Logan will give us such a\r\npolicy, and that I know the Democratic party is not capable of it,\r\nthat I invoke your aid and promise you mine to secure the election\r\nof the Republican ticket.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the adjournment of Congress, I took an active part in the\r\ncampaign, commencing with a speech at Ashland, Ohio, on the 30th\r\nof August, and from that time until the close of the canvass I\r\nspoke daily.  The meetings of both parties were largely attended,\r\nnotably those at Springfield, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAfter the October election in Ohio, which resulted in the success\r\nof the Republican ticket, I engaged in the canvass in other states,\r\nspeaking in many places, among others in Faneuil Hall, Boston, in\r\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, in Chickering Hall, New York, and in\r\nthe Brooklyn Grand Opera House.\r\n\r\nI felt greater timidity in speaking in Faneuil Hall than anywhere\r\nelse.  The time, place, and manner of the meeting were so novel,\r\nthat a strong impression was made upon my mind.  In the middle of\r\nthe day, when the streets were crowded, I was conducted up a narrow,\r\nspiral passageway that led directly to a low platform on one side\r\nof the hall, where were the officers of the meeting, and there I\r\nfaced an audience of men with their hats and overcoats on, all\r\nstanding closely packed, with no room for any more.  It was a\r\nmeeting of business men of marked intelligence, who had no time to\r\nwaste, and whose countenances expressed the demand, \"Say what you\r\nhave to say, and say it quickly.\"  I was deeply impressed with the\r\nhistorical associations of the place, recalling the Revolutionary\r\nscenes that had occurred there, and Daniel Webster and the great\r\nmen whose voices had been heard within its walls.  I condensed my\r\nspeech into less than an hour, and, I believe, gave the assemblage\r\nsatisfaction.  I was followed by brief addresses from Theodore\r\nRoosevelt and others, and then the meeting quietly dispersed.\r\n\r\nWhile in Springfield, I heard of the unfortunate remark of Dr.\r\nBurchard to Blaine about \"Rum, Romanism and Rebellion,\" and felt\r\nthat the effect would be to offend a considerable portion of the\r\nIrish voters, who had been very friendly to Blaine.  After that\r\nincident, I met Mr. Blaine at the Chickering Hall meeting, and went\r\nwith him to Brooklyn, where we spoke together at the Academy of\r\nMusic.\r\n\r\nThe election, a few days afterward, resulted in the success of the\r\nDemocratic ticket.  The electoral vote of New York was cast for\r\nCleveland and Hendricks.  It was believed at the time that this\r\nresult was produced by fraudulent voting in New York city, but the\r\nreturns were formal, and there was no way in which the election\r\ncould be contested.\r\n\r\nCongress met on the 1st of December, 1884.  President Arthur promptly\r\nsent his message to each House.  He congratulated the country upon\r\nthe quiet acquiescence in the result of an election where it had\r\nbeen determined with a slight preponderance.  Our relations with\r\nforeign nations had been friendly and cordial.  The revenues of\r\nthe government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, had been\r\n$348,519,869.92.  The expenditures for the same period, including\r\nthe sinking fund, were $290,916,473.83, leaving a surplus of\r\n$57,603,396.09.  He recommended the immediate suspension of the\r\ncoinage of silver dollars and of the issuance of silver certificates,\r\na further reduction of internal taxes and customs duties, and that\r\nnational banks be allowed to issue circulating notes to the par\r\namount of bonds deposited for their security.  He closed with these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service,\r\nI cannot refrain from expressing to Members of the national\r\nlegislature, with whom I have been brought into personal and official\r\nintercourse, my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy,\r\nand of their harmonious co-operation with the Executive in so many\r\nmeasures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation.\r\n\r\n\"And to my fellow-citizens generally, I acknowledge a deep sense\r\nof obligation for the support which they have accorded me in my\r\nadministration of the executive department of this government.\"\r\n\r\nHugh McCulloch, upon the death of Mr. Folger, had become Secretary\r\nof the Treasury.  His report contained the usual statements in\r\nregard to government receipts and expenditures and the public debt,\r\nbut the chief subject discussed was the coinage of silver dollars.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"There are some financial dangers ahead which can only be avoided\r\nby changes in our financial legislation.  The most imminent of\r\nthese dangers, and the only one to which I now ask the attention\r\nof Congress, arises from the continued coinage of silver and the\r\nincreasing representation of it by silver certificates.  I believe\r\nthat the world is not in a condition, and never will be, for the\r\ndemonetization of one-third of its metallic money; that both gold\r\nand silver are absolutely necessary for a circulating medium; and\r\nthat neither can be disused without materially increasing the burden\r\nof debt, nor even temporarily degraded by artificial means without\r\ninjurious effect upon home and international trade.  But I also\r\nbelieve that gold and silver can only be made to maintain their\r\ncomparative value by the joint action of commercial nations.  Not\r\nonly is there now no joint action taken by these nations to place\r\nand keep silver on an equality with gold, according to existing\r\nstandards, but it has been by the treatment it has received from\r\nEuropean nations greatly lessened in commercial value.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"After giving the subject careful consideration, I have been forced\r\nto the conclusion that unless both the coinage of silver dollars\r\nand the issue of silver certificates are suspended, there is danger\r\nthat silver, and not gold, may become our metallic standard.  This\r\ndanger may not be imminent, but it is of so serious a character\r\nthat there ought not to be delay in providing against it.  Not only\r\nwould the national credit be seriously impaired if the government\r\nshould be under the necessity of using silver dollars or certificates\r\nin payment of gold obligations, but business of all kinds would be\r\ngreatly disturbed; not only so, but gold would at once cease to be\r\na circulating medium, and severe contraction would be the result.\"\r\n\r\nThe first important subject considered by the Senate was the coinage\r\nof silver dollars and the consequent issue of silver certificates.\r\nThe debate was founded upon a resolution offered by Senator Hill,\r\nof Colorado, against the views expressed by the President in his\r\nmessage and by Secretary McCulloch in his report.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December I made a speech covering, as I thought,\r\nthe silver question, not only of the past but of the probable\r\nresults in the future.  The amount of silver dollars then in the\r\ntreasury was $184,730,829, and of silver certificates outstanding\r\n$131,556,531.  These certificates were maintained at par in gold\r\nby being received for customs duties.  They were redeemable in\r\nsilver dollars, but were in fact never presented for redemption.\r\nThe silver dollars could only be used in the redemption of certificates\r\nor by issue in payment of current liabilities.  With the utmost\r\nexertions to put the silver dollars in circulation only fifty\r\nmillion could be used in this way.  To have forced more into\r\ncirculation would have excited a doubt whether any of our paper\r\nmoney could be maintained at par with gold.\r\n\r\nWhen urged to express a remedy for this condition I said that if\r\nI had the power to dictate a law I would ascertain by the best\r\nmeans the exact market value of the two metals, and then put into\r\neach silver dollar as many grains of standard silver as would be\r\nequal in market value to 25.8 grains of standard gold.  I said that\r\nif the price of silver fell the coin would still circulate upon\r\nthe fiat of the government.  If silver advanced in relative value\r\nthe amount of silver in the coin could, at stated periods, be\r\ndecreased.  Bimetallism could only exist where the market value of\r\nthe two metals approached the coinage value, or where a strong\r\ngovernment, with a good credit, received and paid out coins of each\r\nmetal at parity with each other.  The only way to prevent a variation\r\nin the value of the two metals, and the exportation of the dearer\r\nmetal, would be, by an international agreement between commercial\r\nnations, to adopt a common ratio somewhat similar in substance to\r\nthat of the Latin Union, each nation to receive as current money\r\nthe coins of the other and each to redeem its own coins in gold.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck replied to my argument, and the debate between us continued\r\nduring two or three days.  The weakness of the silver advocates\r\nwas that they were not content with the coinage of more silver coin\r\nthan ever before, but were determined that the holder of silver in\r\nany form might deposit it in the mint and have it coined into\r\ndollars for his benefit at the ratio of sixteen to one, when its\r\nmarket value had then fallen so that twenty ounces of silver were\r\nworth but one ounce in gold, and since has fallen in value so that\r\nthirty ounces of silver are worth but one ounce in gold.\r\n\r\nWith free coinage in these conditions no gold coins would be minted\r\nand all the money of the United States would be reduced in value\r\nto the sole silver standard, and gold would be hoarded and exported.\r\nThis debate has been continued from that date to this, not only in\r\nCongress, but in every schoolhouse in the United States, and in\r\nall the commercial nations of the world.  I shall have occasion\r\nhereafter to recur to it.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December I reported, from the joint committee on\r\nthe library, an amendment to an appropriation bill providing for\r\nthe construction of a statue to the memory of General Lafayette,\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n\"That the president _pro tempore_ of the Senate and the speaker of\r\nthe House of Representative do appoint a joint committee of three\r\nSenators and three Representatives, with authority to contract for\r\nand erect a statue to the memory of General Lafayette and his\r\ncompatriots; and said statue shall be placed in a suitable public\r\nreservation in the city of Washington, to be designated by said\r\njoint committee.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment was agreed to by both Houses.  The result was the\r\nerection, on the southeast corner of Lafayette Square in Washington,\r\nof the most beautiful and artistic bronze monument in that city.\r\n\r\nA somewhat sharp and combative controversy had taken place in the\r\nnewspapers between General Sherman and Jefferson Davis, in regard\r\nto the position of the latter on the rights of the Confederate\r\nstates in the spring of 1865.  General Sherman, in a letter to me\r\ndated December 4, 1884, published in the \"Sherman Letters,\" narrated\r\nhis remarks at a meeting of the Frank Blair Post, G. A. R., No. 1,\r\nin St. Louis, in which he said that he had noticed the tendency to\r\ngloss over old names and facts by speaking of the Rebellion as a\r\nwar of secession, while in fact it was a conspiracy up to the firing\r\non Fort Sumter, and a rebellion afterwards.  He described the\r\nconspiracy between Slidell, Benjamin and Davis, and the seizure of\r\nthe United States arsenal at Baton Rouge, and other acts of war,\r\nand then said:\r\n\r\n\"I had seen a letter of Mr. Davis showing that he was not sincere\r\nin his doctrine of secession, for when some of the states of the\r\nConfederacy, in 1865, talked of 'a separate state action,' another\r\nname for 'secession,' he stated that he, as president of the\r\nConfederacy, would resist it, even if he had to turn Lee's army\r\nagainst it.  I did see such a letter, or its copy, in a captured\r\nletter book at Raleigh, just about as the war was closing.\"\r\n\r\nDavis called for the production of the identical letter.  General\r\nSherman said he could not enter into a statement of the controversy,\r\nbut he believed the truth of his statement could be established,\r\nand that he would collect evidence to make good his statement.  I\r\nreplied to his letter as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Senate,                }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., December 10, 1884.}\r\n\"Dear Brother:--. . . I can see how naturally you spoke of Jeff.\r\nDavis as you did, and you did not say a word more than he deserved.\r\nStill, he scarcely deserves to be brought into notice.  He was not\r\nonly a conspirator, but a traitor.  His reply was a specimen of\r\nimpotent rage.  It is scarcely worth your notice, nor should you\r\ndignify it by a direct rejoinder.  A clear, strong statement of\r\nthe historical facts that justified the use of the word 'conspirator,'\r\nwhich you know very well how to write, is all the notice required.\r\nDo not attempt to fortify it by an affidavit, as some of the papers\r\nsay you intend to do, but your statement of the letters seen by\r\nyou, and the historical facts known by you, are enough.  I have\r\nhad occasion, since your letter was received, to speak to several\r\nSenators about the matter, and they all agree with me that you\r\nought to avoid placing the controversy on letters which cannot now\r\nbe produced.  The records have been pretty well sifted by friendly\r\nrebels, and under the new administration it is likely their further\r\npublication will be edited by men who will gladly shield Davis at\r\nthe expense of a Union soldier.  The letter of Stephens to Johnson\r\nis an extraordinary one.  Its publication will be a bombshell in\r\nthe Confederate camp.  I will deliver the copy to Colonel Scott to-\r\nmorrow.  One or two paragraphs from it go far to sustain your stated\r\nopinion of Jeff. Davis. . . .\r\n\r\n  \"Very affectionately yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThis controversy came before the Senate by a resolution offered by\r\nSenator Hawley, calling upon the President to communicate to the\r\nSenate an historical statement concerning the public policy of the\r\nexecutive department of the Confederate states during the late War\r\nof the Rebellion, reported to have been lately filed in the war\r\ndepartment by General William T. Sherman.  Upon this resolution a\r\nsomewhat acrimonious debate occurred, participated in by Senators\r\nHarris, Hawley, Vest, George, Ingalls and others.  During the debate\r\nI felt constrained, on account of my relationship with General\r\nSherman, to give his version of the controversy between himself\r\nand Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\nI disliked the introduction of such a controversy twenty years\r\nafter the war was over, but still, as the matter was before us, I\r\nentered at considerable length into a history of the controversy,\r\nand expressed my decided opinion that General Sherman was entirely\r\njustified in denouncing Davis and his associates, before the Civil\r\nWar commenced, as conspirators and traitors.  I closed my remarks\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry this debate has sprung up.  I was in hope, with the\r\nSenator from Connecticut, who introduced the resolution, that these\r\npapers would be published, and nothing more would be said about\r\nthem here, but let the people determine the issue and let this\r\nmatter go down in history.  But, sir, whenever, in my presence, in\r\na public assemblage, Jefferson Davis shall be treated as a patriot,\r\nI must enter my solemn protest.  Whenever the motives and causes\r\nof the war, the beginning and end of which I have seen, are brought\r\ninto question, I must stand, as I have always stood, upon the firm\r\nconviction that it was a causeless rebellion, made with bad motives,\r\nand that all men who led in that movement were traitors to their\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Lamar answered my speech with some heat, and closed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"One other thing.  We, of the south, have surrendered upon all the\r\nquestions which divided the two sides in that controversy.  We have\r\ngiven up the right of the people to secede from the Union; we have\r\ngiven up the right of each state to judge for itself of the\r\ninfractions of the constitution and the mode of redress; we have\r\ngiven up the right to control our own domestic institutions.  We\r\nfought for all these, and we lost in that controversy; but no man\r\nshall, in my presence, call Jefferson Davis a traitor, without my\r\nresponding with a stern and emphatic denial.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Vest closed the debate in a few remarks, and the subject-\r\nmatter was displaced by the regular order.  While I regretted this\r\ndebate, I believed that the speeches made by the Republican Senators\r\nproperly defined the Rebellion as, first, a conspiracy; second,\r\ntreason; third, a rebellion subdued by force, finally followed by\r\nthe most generous treatment of those engaged in the Rebellion that\r\nis found in the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nDuring this session there was a very full debate upon the subject\r\nof regulating interstate commerce, in which I participated.  The\r\ncontest was between what was known as the Reagan bill, which passed\r\nthe House of Representatives, and the Senate bill.  I expressed\r\nthe opinion that the Senate bill was better than the Reagan bill,\r\nand, although much popular favor had been enlisted from time to\r\ntime in favor of the Reagan bill, because it grappled with and\r\ndealt with the railroad corporations, the Senate bill did more; it\r\nnot only grappled with them, but laid a broad and deep foundation\r\nfor an admirable system of railroad law, which should govern all\r\nthe railroads of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nDEDICATION OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.\r\nResolution of Senator Morrill Providing for Appropriate Dedicatory\r\nCeremonies--I Am Made Chairman of the Commission--Robert C. Winthrop's\r\nLetter Stating His Inability to Attend the Exercises--Letters of\r\nRegret from General Grant and John G. Whittier--Unfavorable Weather\r\nfor the Dedication--My Address as Presiding Officer--The President's\r\nAcceptance of the Monument for the Nation--Mr. Winthrop's Address\r\nRead in the House by John D. Long--Inauguration of the First\r\nDemocratic President Since Buchanan's Time--Visit to Cincinnati\r\nand Address on the Election Frauds--Respects to the Ohio Legislature\r\n--A Trip to the West and Southwest--Address on American Independence.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1884, the President approved the following\r\njoint resolution, introduced by Mr. Morrill, from the committee on\r\npublic buildings and grounds:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, The shaft of the Washington monument is approaching\r\ncompletion, and it is proper that it should be dedicated with\r\nappropriate ceremonies, calculated to perpetuate the fame of the\r\nillustrious man who was 'first in war, first in peace, and first\r\nin the hearts of his countrymen:'  Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That a commission to\r\nconsist of five Senators appointed by the president of the Senate,\r\neight Representatives appointed by the speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, three members of the Washington Monument Society,\r\nand the United States engineer in charge of the work be, and the\r\nsame is hereby, created, with full powers to make arrangements for,--\r\n\r\n\"First.  The dedication of the monument to the name and memory of\r\nGeorge Washington, by the President of the United States, with\r\nappropriate ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  A procession from the monument to the capitol, escorted\r\nby regular and volunteer corps, the Washington Monument Society,\r\nrepresentatives of cities, states, and organizations which have\r\ncontributed blocks of stone, and such bodies of citizens as may\r\ndesire to appear.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  An oration in the hall of the House of Representatives,\r\non the twenty-second day of February, _anno Domini_ eighteen hundred\r\nand eighty-five, by the Honorable Robert C. Winthrop, who delivered\r\nthe oration at the laying of the corner stone of the monument in\r\neighteen hundred and forty-eight, with music by the Marine Band.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  Salutes of one hundred guns from the navy yard, the\r\nartillery headquarters, and such men-of-war as can be anchored in\r\nthe Potomac.\"\r\n\r\nI was chairman of the commission appointed under this resolution,\r\nand, in compliance with it, invited Mr. Winthrop to deliver the\r\noration.  He expressed his deep sense of the honor conferred upon\r\nhim, but had a doubt whether he ought not to decline on account of\r\nhis failing health.  Mr. Morrill and I strongly insisted upon his\r\nacceptance and he eventually consented, though not without misgivings\r\nwhich were unhappily justified.\r\n\r\nA short time before the day appointed for the dedication I received\r\nfrom him the following autograph letter, which is interesting, not\r\nonly on account of the eminence of its author, but of the important\r\nevent about to be celebrated:\r\n\r\n  \"90 Marlborough Street, Boston, February 13, 1885.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Chairman, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Senator Sherman:--It is with deep regret that I find myself\r\ncompelled to abandon all further hope of being at the dedication\r\nof the Washington monument on the 21st instant.  I have been looking\r\nforward to the possibility of being able to run on at the last\r\nmoment, and to pronounce a few sentences of my oration before\r\nhanding it to Governor Long, who has so kindly consented to read\r\nit.  But my recovery from dangerous illness has been slower than\r\nI anticipated, and my physician concurs with my family in forbidding\r\nme from any attempt to leave home at present.\r\n\r\n\"I need not assure the commissioners how great a disappointment it\r\nis to me to be deprived of the privilege of being present on this\r\nmost interesting occasion.  I am sure of their sympathy without\r\nasking for it.\r\n\r\n\"Please present my respectful apologies to your associates, and\r\nbelieve me,\r\n\r\n  \"With great regard, very faithfully yours,\r\n  \"Robt. C. Winthrop.\r\n\"P. S.--This is the first letter I have attempted to write with my\r\nown pen since my illness.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous regrets received by the commission was the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  \"Oak Knoll, Danvers, Mass., Second Month 8, 1885.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Chairman of Committee.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Friend:--The state of my health will scarcely permit me to\r\navail myself of the invitation of the commission to attend the\r\nceremonies of the dedication of the Washington monument.\r\n\r\n\"In common with my fellow-citizens I rejoice at the successful\r\ncompletion of this majestic testimonial of the reverence and\r\naffection which the people of the United States, irrespective of\r\nparty, section, or race, cherish for the 'Father of his Country.'\r\nGrand, however, and imposing as that testimonial may seem, it is,\r\nafter all, but an inadequate outward representation of that mightier\r\nmonument, unseen and immeasurable, builded of the living stones of\r\na nation's love and gratitude, the hearts of forty millions of\r\npeople.  But the world has not outlived its need of picture writing\r\nand symbolism, and the great object lesson of the Washington monument\r\nwill doubtless prove a large factor in the moral and political\r\neducation of present and future generations.  Let us hope that it\r\nwill be a warning as well as a benediction; and that while its\r\nsunlit altitude may fitly symbolize the truth that 'righteousness\r\nexalteth a nation,' its shadow falling on the dome of the capitol\r\nmay be a daily remainder that 'sin is a reproach to any people.'\r\nSurely it will not have been reared in vain if, on the day of its\r\ndedication, its mighty shaft shall serve to lift heavenward the\r\nvoice of a united people that the principles for which the fathers\r\ntoiled and suffered shall be maintained inviolate by their children.\r\n\r\n  \"With sincere respect, I am thy friend,\r\n  \"John G. Whittier.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter, received about two weeks earlier from General Grant,\r\nseems to me worthy of a reproduction.  It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"New York City, January 27, 1885.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--I regret very much that my physical condition prevents\r\nme from accepting the invitation of the commissioners, appointed\r\nby Congress to provide suitable ceremonies for the dedication of\r\nthe Washington monument, to be present to witness the same on the\r\n21st of February next.  My throat still requires the attention of\r\nthe physician daily, though I am encouraged to believe that it is\r\nimproving.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n  \"U. S. Grant.\"\r\n\r\nAn engraved card of invitation was sent to a great number of civil\r\nand military organizations throughout the United States, the regents\r\nof Mount Vernon, relatives of General Washington and other\r\ndistinguished persons.\r\n\r\nThe commission invited Lieutenant General Sheridan to act as marshal\r\nof the day, with an aid-de-camp from each state and territory.\r\nThis invitation was accepted, and arrangements were made for a\r\nprocession from the monument to the capitol and proceedings there\r\nafter the dedication by the President.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution prescribed that the monument be dedicated \"to\r\nthe name and memory of George Washington, by the President of the\r\nUnited States, with appropriate ceremonies\" on the 22nd of February.\r\nThe day selected was among the coldest of the year.  The ground\r\nwas covered with snow and a high keen wind was blowing.  I was\r\ndirected to preside over the proceedings at the base of the monument,\r\nand in the performance of this duty made the following address:\r\n\r\n\"The commission authorized by the two Houses of Congress to provide\r\nsuitable ceremonies for the dedication of the Washington monument,\r\ndirect me to preside and announce the order of ceremonies deemed\r\nproper on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\"I need not say anything to impress upon you the dignity of the\r\nevent you have met to celebrate.  The monument speaks for itself--\r\nsimple in form, admirable in proportions, composed of enduring\r\nmarble and granite, resting upon foundations broad and deep, it\r\nrises into the skies higher than any work of human art.  It is the\r\nmost imposing, costly and appropriate monument ever erected in the\r\nhonor of one man.\r\n\r\n\"It had its origin in the profound conviction of the people,\r\nirrespective of party, creed or race, not only of this country,\r\nbut of all civilized countries, that the name and fame of Washington\r\nshould be perpetuated by the most imposing testimonial of a nation's\r\ngratitude to its hero, statesman and father.  This universal\r\nsentiment took form in a movement of private citizens, associated\r\nunder the name of the Washington National Monument Association,\r\nwho, on the 31st day of January, 1848, secured, from Congress, an\r\nact authorizing them to erect the proposed monument on this ground,\r\nselected, as the most appropriate site, by the President of the\r\nUnited States.  Its corner stone was laid on the 4th day of July,\r\n1848, by the Masonic fraternity, with imposing ceremonies, in the\r\npresence of the chief officer of the government and a multitude of\r\ncitizens.  It was partially erected by the National Monument\r\nAssociation, with means furnished by the voluntary contributions\r\nof the people of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"On the 5th day of July, 1876, one hundred years after the declaration\r\nof American Independence, Congress, in the name of the people of\r\nthe United States, formally assumed and directed the completion of\r\nthe monument.  Since then the foundation has been strengthened,\r\nthe shaft has been steadily advanced, and the now completed structure\r\nstands before you.\r\n\r\n\"It is a fit memorial of the greatest character in human history.\r\nIt looks down upon scenes most loved by him on earth, the most\r\nconspicuous object in a landscape full of objects deeply interesting\r\nto the American people.  All eyes turn to it, and all hearts feel\r\nthe inspiration of its beauty, symmetry and grandeur.  Strong as\r\nit is, it will not endure so long as the memory of him in whose\r\nhonor it was built, but while it stands it will be the evidence to\r\nmany succeeding generations of the love and reverence of this\r\ngeneration for the name and fame of George Washington, 'first in\r\nwar, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen'--\r\nmore even than this, the prototype of purity, manhood and patriotism\r\nfor all lands and for all time.  Without further preface, I proceed\r\nto discharge the duty assigned me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter prayer by the Rev. Henderson Suter, Dr. James C. Welling read\r\nan address which had been prepared by W. W. Corcoran, first vice\r\npresident of the Washington National Monument Society, giving a\r\ndetailed history of the structure in its various stages.  Washington\r\nhaving been a Freemason, appropriate Masonic ceremonies were\r\nperformed, the address being delivered by Grand Master Myron M.\r\nParker.  Colonel Thomas L. Casey, of the engineer corps, United\r\nStates army, the chief engineer and architect of the monument, then\r\nformally delivered the structure to the President of the United\r\nStates, in an address describing the work done by him on it.\r\nPresident Arthur received the monument with the following well-\r\nchosen words:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-Countrymen:--Before the dawn of the century whose eventful\r\nyears will soon have faded into the past, when death had but lately\r\nrobbed this republic of its most beloved and illustrious citizen,\r\nthe Congress of the United States pledged the faith of the nation\r\nthat in this city, bearing his honored name, and then, as now, the\r\nseat of the general government, a monument should be erected 'to\r\ncommemorate the great events of his military and political life.'\r\n\r\n\"The stately column that stretches heavenward from the plain whereon\r\nwe stand bears witness to all who behold it that the covenant which\r\nour fathers made, their children have fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"In the completion of this great work of patriotic endeavor there\r\nis abundant cause for national rejoicing; for while this structure\r\nshall endure it shall be to all mankind a steadfast token of the\r\naffectionate and reverent regard in which this people continue to\r\nhold the memory of Washington.  Well may he ever keep the foremost\r\nplace in the hearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"The faith that never faltered, the wisdom that was broader and\r\ndeeper than any learning taught in schools, the courage that shrank\r\nfrom no peril and was dismayed by no defeat, the loyalty that kept\r\nall selfish purpose subordinate to the demands of patriotism and\r\nhonor, the sagacity that displayed itself in camp and cabinet alike,\r\nand, above all, that harmonious union of moral and intellectual\r\nqualities which has never found its parallel among men; these are\r\nthe attributes of character which the intelligent thought of this\r\ncentury ascribes to the grandest figure of the last.\r\n\r\n\"But other and more eloquent lips than mine will to-day rehearse\r\nto you the story of his noble life and its glorious achievements.\r\n\r\n\"To myself has been assigned a simpler and more formal duty, in\r\nfulfillment of which I do now, as President of the United States,\r\nand in behalf of the people, receive this monument from the hands\r\nof its builder, and declare it dedicated from this time forth to\r\nthe immortal name and memory of George Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe exercises at the monument concluded, General Sheridan and his\r\naids formed the procession, consisting of regular and state troops,\r\nthe Masonic fraternity, Grand Army posts, and other organizations,\r\nwith the invited guests, in carriages, and proceeded to the capitol,\r\nwhile the cannon at the navy yard, at the artillery headquarters\r\nand at Fort Meyer fired minute guns.\r\n\r\nAs previously arranged, the address of Mr. Winthrop, which has ever\r\nsince been regarded as equal to the occasion, was read by John D.\r\nLong, in the hall of the House of Representatives, before a most\r\ndistinguished audience, embracing all the principal officers of\r\nthe government and the invited guests.  John W. Daniel, of Virginia,\r\nalso delivered an eloquent oration.\r\n\r\nThus the Congress celebrated the completion of monuments in enduring\r\nform to two of the greatest men in American history--Washington\r\nand Marshall.\r\n\r\nThe Congress expired by limitation March 4, 1885.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, there was inaugurated the first Democratic President\r\nof the United States since the time of James Buchanan.  The election\r\nof Cleveland, though not disputed, turned upon a very narrow majority\r\nin New York, and the practical exclusion of the majority of the\r\nlegal voters in several of the southern states.  This naturally\r\nled to the inquiry, \"What will you do about it?\"  My answer was\r\nthat we must quietly acquiesce in the result of the official returns\r\nand give to Mr. Cleveland such fair treatment as we asked for Hayes.\r\nI said that we should confirm his appointments made in pursuance\r\nof the law and custom.  I was a member of the committee that\r\nconducted him to the stand where he was inaugurated.  I heard his\r\ninaugural address, carefully studied it, and felt sure that if he\r\nfaithfully observed the policy he defined, the bitterness of party\r\nstrife would be greatly diminished.  He carefully avoided contested\r\nquestions of public policy, and especially omitted all reference\r\nto the substantial overthrow of the political rights of a majority\r\nof the legal voters in many of the southern states, by which alone\r\nhe was elected.\r\n\r\nThe usual call for an executive session at the close of a presidential\r\nterm was issued by President Arthur, and the Senate met on the 4th\r\nof March, Vice President Hendricks presiding.  But little business\r\nof general interest was done during that session except action on\r\npresidential appointments, few in number, which were confirmed\r\nwithout objection.  The Senate adjourned on the 2nd of April.\r\n\r\nSoon after I went to Mansfield, and, on the 12th of April, to\r\nCincinnati, to witness the inauguration of my friend, Amor Smith,\r\nJr., as mayor of that city.  He had fought and overcome the grossest\r\nfrauds that had been or could be committed by penitentiary convicts.\r\nA crowd gathered around his residence, which, with those of his\r\nneighbors, was brilliantly illuminated.  The Blaine club, headed\r\nby a band and followed by many citizens, filled his yard.  His\r\nhouse was full of his personal friends.  After music by the band,\r\nMiller Outcalt, president of the club, escorted Mr. Smith to the\r\npiazza and introduced him to the citizens.  His speech was modest\r\nand appropriate, but he took care to denounce, in fitting language,\r\nthe open and reckless frauds practiced by his enemies to defeat\r\nhim, and promised that while he was mayor no such frauds should be\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nI was introduced to the crowd, and, after rendering my thanks and\r\ncongratulations and my appeal to the young men of the club, said:\r\n\r\n\"I think the foulest crime in the decalogue of crime, worse than\r\nany named in the Ten Commandments of the Mosaic law, lower far than\r\nstealing, worse than burglary, as bad as murder, is the crime that\r\nhas been perpetrated here in your city openly, in the face of day,\r\ntrying to break down the elective franchise and rob the people of\r\ntheir right to govern themselves.  I might forgive a man who would\r\nsteal because he was in need of bread; he might commit other crimes\r\nbecause of some reason, but a man who seeks to rob his neighbors\r\nof their right to govern themselves, and practices the tricks of\r\nthe wily electioneer to deprive the people of this right, commits\r\na meaner crime than any that can be named in the list of crime.\r\n\r\n\"I am told that dozens--aye, hundreds--of men have gone to the\r\npolls and there voted over and over again; that they have given\r\nfalse names, and sometimes, in the presence of the very guardians\r\nof the public peace, they have openly violated the law.  I say that\r\nworse men cannot be found than those who do this, or those viler\r\ncreatures who protect them in doing it or justify them in their\r\nacts.  Every power of the nation should be utilized to punish them\r\nwith the penitentiary; they ought to be made to wear the stripes\r\nof the convict.\"\r\n\r\nForaker followed with an eloquent speech, which greatly pleased\r\nthe audience, and after much hand-shaking the crowd gradually\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nMy remarks about frauds at elections did not please the \"Enquirer.\"\r\nWhile strongly censuring me for violence in language it did not\r\ntry to controvert what I said.  I have always entertained the\r\nopinion that frauds in elections are more dangerous crimes than\r\ncheating, theft and robbery, because they are committed against\r\nthe whole people and sap and undermine republican institutions.\r\nI have always denounced them, or anything approaching them, when\r\ncommitted by friend or foe.\r\n\r\nFrom Cincinnati I went to Columbus to pay my respects to the Ohio\r\nlegislature, about to adjourn.  A majority of both houses was\r\nDemocratic.  They convened in the hall of the house of representatives,\r\nwhere I addressed them.  I thanked them for their courtesy, which\r\nwas the more gracious because it came from gentlemen who did not\r\nagree with me in political opinion.  I told them I was pleased to\r\nsee that in Ohio and elsewhere the interests of our country and\r\nour state were regarded of vastly more importance than the factious\r\nquarrels of bitter partisans, which feeling I was glad to say I\r\nhad always encouraged.  I alluded to my having served in the Senate\r\nof the United States with colleagues representing different political\r\nopinions from myself, including Allen G. Thurman, George H. Pendleton\r\nand, at that time, Henry B. Payne, and to the fact that whenever\r\nthe interests of the people of Ohio were concerned our political\r\ndifferences disappeared and we were shoulder to shoulder as friends.\r\nI said I thought this spirit ought to be observed by the representatives\r\nof the people of Ohio and of the United States, that whenever the\r\ninterests of the people were under consideration party spirit should\r\nsink into insignificance.\r\n\r\nAfter hand-shaking all around I returned to my hotel.  In the\r\nevening I was invited to attend the board of trade, and, being\r\nkindly introduced by President Miles, I, as usual, was called upon\r\nfor a speech.  I first alluded to the remarkable growth of Columbus\r\nto which the members of the board had contributed, and then discussed\r\nbriefly the silver question, about which they also felt an interest.\r\nI then exploited into electricity, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, you will be called upon hereafter to deal with forces\r\nyet undiscovered.  The developments of science have brought to your\r\naid things as mysterious as life, which no mind can penetrate.\r\nYou are now called upon to use electricity as a motive power and\r\nas light.  You must develop these secrets of nature, and you will\r\nhave no more fear of the exhaustion of gold, for these new powers\r\nwill contribute to the wealth and power of this country.  The\r\nbusiness men must carry out these, and so I say, as I said in\r\nCincinnati, that if business men would carry their honest methods\r\ninto government, then the scale and grade of our politics would\r\nrise higher and higher.  We have had advancement under these\r\nprinciples in everything except the government of the country.\r\nWhat we want is honest government by honest men.  The United States\r\nwill then be looked on no longer as an experiment, but it will\r\nbecome the greatest of the great governments since Adam was created.\r\n\r\n\"If I can induce the young men, who have contributed so much to\r\nthe growth of this city, to see to this--if you will do this much\r\nto promote honest government and honest methods, we won't care\r\nwhether you call yourself Democrat or Republican.\"\r\n\r\nI closed with thanks for the honor done me.  I was also invited to\r\nvisit the city council, and as soon as the reception in the board\r\nof trade was over I accompanied a committee to the council chamber,\r\nwhere I was again called upon for a speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor, the president of the council, by a slip of the tongue,\r\nintroduced me as \"Senator Thurman.\"  I said:\r\n\r\n\"I see that our friend, your president, mixes me up with Judge\r\nThurman on account of the fact that our names sound very much alike.\r\nI consider such a mistake the highest compliment that could be paid\r\nme; for the great ability, intense sagacity and entire purity of\r\nyour distinguished fellow-citizen, in the highest offices of the\r\nland, have placed him, in my estimation, in the first rank of able\r\nand noble men.  I like to have my name called Thurman.  It is my\r\nopinion that the duties of city officers are of the very highest\r\nimportance.  The most serious embarrassments of this or any other\r\ncountry lie with the municipal governments.  National government\r\nis clearly defined.  The government of the State of Ohio ought to\r\npresent no difficulties when administered by fair men of business\r\nhabits.  But the eyes of the people are upon the difficulties of\r\nmunicipal government.  The scenes that occurred in Paris, in London,\r\nin New York, and, to come nearer home, the scenes that occurred in\r\nCincinnati, all show the importance of good city government.  I\r\nsay to you, although a Member of the Senate of the United States,\r\nthat the real difficulties of our government are no more serious\r\nthan the problems of city management and government.  When Rome\r\nbecame the scene of wrongs, crimes, and usurpation, the republic\r\ncrumbled.  If ever this government be in danger, it will be because\r\nof the misgovernment of our cities.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of April, 1885, I arranged for a trip via Chicago,\r\nDes Moines, St. Louis, Texas and California, thence along the\r\nPacific coast to Tacoma and Seattle, and thence by the Northern\r\nPacific railroad to St. Paul, and home again.  The party was composed\r\nof Henry C. Hedges, George F. Carpenter, both citizens of Mansfield,\r\nmy nephew Frank Sherman, of Des Moines, and myself.  It was arranged\r\nthat we were to meet in St. Louis.  In the meantime I proceeded to\r\nDes Moines, where I met my brother, Hoyt, and his son, Frank.  Here\r\nI met a reporter of the \"Register\" published in that city.  He said\r\nin his report that I seemed to feel happy at the prospect that for\r\ntwo months at least I was going to be free from public cares, and\r\nthat I acted like a man who had absolutely thrown worry aside for\r\nthe time being.  I told him my business was purely of a private\r\ncharacter, and that I had dismissed all politics from my mind.  I\r\ndeclined to answer his questions about Mr. Cleveland.  He made out\r\nof small materials an interview which answered his purpose.  He\r\nasked my view of the silver question.  I told him I hoped to see\r\nthe people abandon the idea, which prevailed a few years previous,\r\nof having silver money of less value than gold.  We had gone through\r\na struggle of some years to make our paper money equal to gold,\r\nand the next struggle ought to be to do the same with silver money.\r\nI said we should have all kinds of money of equal value whether\r\nUnited States notes, bank bills, silver or gold; that if we had\r\nthis our silver would circulate in all parts of the world the same\r\nas our gold, that we could use both silver and gold as the basis\r\nof our certificates, which would then be regarded as money by every\r\ncommercial nation of the world.  I said I was in favor of both\r\nsilver and gold, and of using both to be coined upon the basis of\r\nmarket value, that in this way the volume of money would be increased\r\ninstead of being diminished, and our money would become the standard\r\nmoney of the world.  In his report he said that I spoke very\r\nfeelingly of General Grant, expressing a hope for his recovery,\r\nbut that I feared his apparent improvement was only characteristic\r\nof that disease and not substantial.\r\n\r\nI was surprised as well as gratified at the rapid growth of Des\r\nMoines, which I first knew as an insignificant village.  From Des\r\nMoines Frank Sherman and I went to St. Louis, and there met Messrs.\r\nHedges and Carpenter.  During the two or three days we remained in\r\nSt. Louis I stayed at the house of General Sherman, who then resided\r\nin that city.  He took great interest in my proposed trip, and one\r\nevening wrote out, without a change or erasure of a single word,\r\non three pages of foolscap, and under the head of \"Memorandum for\r\nJohn Sherman,\" a complete and detailed statement of the route I\r\nwas to follow, and the names of the cities and places I was to\r\nvisit, including the persons whom I ought to see, to several of\r\nwhom he gave me letters of introduction.  I have regarded this\r\n\"memorandum,\" which we found accurate in every particular, as a\r\nstriking evidence of his mastery of details.  We followed the route\r\nwith scarcely a change.  Among the letters given me by him was one\r\nto his friend, F. F. Low, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"St. Louis, Mo., May 3, 1885.\r\n\"Hon. F. F. Low, Anglo California Bank.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--My brother John, the Senator, is on the point of starting\r\nfor San Francisco via the southern route and intends to come back\r\nby the north.  He will be in your city some days, and I am anxious\r\nyou should become acquainted, also that he should meet your wife\r\nand daughter.\r\n\r\n\"If you are with the Pacific club please introduce him to some of\r\nthe old set--Hoffman, Tevis, Haggin, Rowie, etc., etc.  Nearly all\r\nmy old banking friends have passed away, but I am sure he would be\r\npleased to meet Alvord and Brown, of the Bank of California, and\r\nalso Flood, of the Nevada Bank.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly your friend,\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in St. Louis, the \"Evening Chronicle\" of May 1, published\r\nquite a long interview with me.  General Sherman, during this\r\ninterview, sat somewhat aside, now and then putting in an emphatic\r\nassent or suggestion.  The general inquired of me if there was any\r\nlate news from Washington concerning General Sheridan.  The reporter\r\nthen asked him what his opinion was as to the controversy between\r\nGeneral Sheridan and Secretary of War Endicott.  The general\r\nanswered:  \"There is no controversy.  It is simply an incident of\r\nthe conflict of authority which has existed between the Secretary\r\nof War and the General of the Army since the days of Washington.\r\nGeneral Scott had to leave Washington on that account.  I had to\r\nleave there for the same reason, and Sheridan will have to go away.\"\r\n\r\nEarly Monday morning, May 4, we left on the St. Louis, Iron Mountain\r\n& Southern railway.  I had heard and read a great deal in St. Louis\r\nabout the mineral resources of the southeastern part of Missouri,\r\nthrough which we passed, but from the cars we could gain no\r\ninformation.  We saw, on every side, herds of cattle, flocks of\r\nsheep, and bands of horses and mules.  For miles the forest woods\r\nstretched away.  We passed through the low lands of Arkansas,\r\ncovered with valuable timber.  We passed through Texarkana, a city\r\nlocated partly in Arkansas and partly in Texas, and not far from\r\nLouisiana.  We proceeded across the State of Texas, only catching\r\nglimpses, here and there, of towns springing up, and broad fields\r\nalready planted with cotton.\r\n\r\nIn passing through Dallas, we met my old boyhood friend, A. Banning\r\nNorton, who was there called Judge Norton.  In 1844 he was so\r\nearnest in his zeal and enthusiasm for Henry Clay that he vowed he\r\nwould not cut his hair until Clay was elected President of the\r\nUnited States.  Clay's defeat was a sad blow to Norton, but he\r\nreligiously kept his vow, and until the day of his death wore his\r\nhair unshorn.  He was thoroughly loyal during the war, and was\r\ncompelled to leave Texas and remain in Ohio until after the war\r\nwas over, when he returned and published a newspaper, and was kindly\r\ntreated by his Texas neighbors.  In his paper, he said that receiving\r\na telegram from me at six o'clock, at his residence, just before\r\nthe arrival of the train, he hurried to the Union Depot, and there\r\nhad the satisfaction of meeting our party.  He said that his chief\r\nregret at the delay in receiving this telegram was that he did not\r\nhave time enough to give notice to his neighbors, who would have\r\nbeen glad to give us an ovation.  He went with us as far as Fort\r\nWorth, and we had a chance to revive the memories of early times,\r\nwhen we were schoolboys at Mount Vernon, Ohio.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at El Paso and Paso del Norte, the first a Texan and\r\nthe second a Mexican town, opposite each other on the Rio Grande\r\nRiver, which, from its mouth to this point, is the boundary line\r\nbetween Mexico and the United States.  El Paso must, in all human\r\nprobability, become a place of great importance.  From there we\r\nproceeded to Deming and entered Arizona.  Here we began again to\r\nhear of rich mines, of thriving mining towns, and of the inexhaustible\r\nores of silver and gold, but how much was truth and how much\r\nexaggeration we had no means of knowing.  From the cars the whole\r\ncountry appeared to be a wilderness.  Arizona, as viewed from the\r\ncars, does not present a pleasing prospect, though we heard that\r\nback beyond the mountains on either side were plains and valleys\r\nirrigated by mountain streams, where perennial grasses existed and\r\ngrain was raised.  We passed through Tucson, the capital of the\r\nterritory.  It is an old city, having been in existence, it is\r\nsaid, 300 years.  Here we saw fields of barley, wheat, rye and\r\ntimothy, and a large orchard, all enriched by irrigation.  We soon\r\ncrossed the Colorado River and entered California.\r\n\r\nFrom Yuma to San Bernardino is an absolute desert.  For over one\r\nhundred miles the track is one hundred feet, or more, below the\r\nlevel of the sea, and the country is absolutely naked of bird or\r\ngrass.  At San Bernardino we entered California proper, and there\r\nfound a beautiful country, with nothing to obstruct the view, the\r\nCalifornia mountains being on the right all the way into Los Angeles.\r\nUpon my arrival in this city I was pleasantly surprised.  I had\r\nbeen there thirteen years before, but everything was changed.  I\r\ncould find none of the old landmarks I had formerly seen.  They\r\nhad disappeared, but in their place were great improvements and\r\nsigns of progress and prosperity.  I was asked the occasion of my\r\nvisit.  I answered truly that I proposed to remain in the southern\r\npart of the state for a week or more, for rest and recreation.\r\nHere, again, I had inquiries about the silver question.  I was\r\naverse to giving any expression of opinion, but the topic was\r\nirrepressible, and I finally said to the representative of one of\r\nthe leading papers:  \"I am in favor of a silver dollar, equal, in\r\nmarket value, to the gold dollar--actually equal.  In other words,\r\nlet the silver dollar have enough grains of silver in it to make\r\nit intrinsically worth, in the market, the gold dollar.  As it is,\r\nthe government buys the silver at a certain valuation and then\r\ncoins it at another valuation, to make a profit on the difference.\r\nThis is not protecting the silver producer at all.  It really is\r\nan injury to him and his industry.\"\r\n\r\nOur stay in Los Angeles was a very pleasant one.  We drove to many\r\ninteresting towns and settlements within fifteen or twenty miles\r\nof the city.  I do not remember, in my many travels, any part of\r\nthe earth's surface that is more attractive in the spring of the\r\nyear, the season when I was there, than the region about Los Angeles.\r\nI met there many friends of General Sherman, who inquired for him,\r\nand I informed them he was living very pleasantly in St. Louis,\r\nthat I had spent the last Sunday with him, that he traveled a great\r\ndeal, and attended reunions with old army comrades, which he enjoyed\r\nvery much, that he was fond of the Pacific coast and liked to go\r\nthere, and that I almost persuaded him to come with me on this\r\ntrip, had not other engagements existed which he could not annul.\r\n\r\nWe met several Ohio people while here, among them two or three\r\ngentlemen whom we had known as boys in Mansfield.  We drove to\r\nWolfskill's orange grove, and to many handsome places in, and\r\naround, Los Angeles, to Sierra Madre Villa, to Baldwin's place, to\r\nRose's wine establishment, and to Passadena, where we found Senator\r\nCameron and his wife pleasantly situated, and where they spent the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nFrom Los Angeles we departed by stage and passed through the Los\r\nAngeles valley, the San Fernando valley, and after crossing the\r\ncoast range saw the sea.  For the first time we were at the Pacific\r\ncoast proper.  On the way we met a settlement of Ohio men, most of\r\nthem from Richland county, whom we knew.  San Buenaventura is the\r\ncounty seat of Ventura county, with about 2,000 inhabitants.  It\r\nis an interesting place, its chief ornament being an old mission\r\nbuilt in 1784.  We there visited a loan exhibition and floral\r\ndisplay under the management of the ladies of the village and\r\nsurrounding country, and saw the evidences of a semi-tropical\r\nclimate, magnificent palm tress, and the orange, the lemon and the\r\nlime.  From this place to Santa Barbara the drive was mainly along\r\nthe beach.  Passing from the beach we entered upon a beautiful\r\ncountry, and so proceeded all the way into Santa Barbara, through\r\ncharming valleys and under pleasant skies.\r\n\r\nAt Santa Barbara we were welcomed by Colonel Hollister, a native\r\nof Ohio and a ranchero of California, whom, as already related, I\r\nhad met under similar circumstance thirteen years previous.  We\r\nstopped at a hotel owned by him and for four days were his guests.\r\nHe had settled on a tract of country west of Santa Barbara, and\r\nhad become the owner of a ranch of 48,000 acres as well as extensive\r\nproperty in Santa Barbara and other places.  We visited him at Glen\r\nAnnie after a drive of a few miles in an open carriage, all the\r\nway within view of the sea and the mountains, through valleys\r\ncultivated like gardens, under a bright sky in pure air.  On the\r\nfoot hills were grazing herds of cattle, flocks of sheep and droves\r\nof horses.  On either side of the carriage road were groves of the\r\nEnglish walnut, orange, lemon, lime, apricot, peach, apple, cherry,\r\nthe date palm and olive trees, with acres and acres of vineyards,\r\nand now and then a park of live oak.  The mansion of Glen Annie\r\nwas surrounded by a bower of flowers and vines.  From the porch we\r\ncould see the sea.  This was the second time I had been at Santa\r\nBarbara and I always remember it as perhaps the most pleasing\r\ncombination of scenery I have ever witnessed.  We spent a very\r\npleasant hour with Mr. Stoddard and family, who had removed from\r\nOhio some years before to that delightful part of our country.\r\nFrom Santa Barbara we went by steamer to Wilmington and San Pedro\r\nand then returned to Los Angeles through a beautiful country.  From\r\nthence we went to San Francisco by rail through a country that\r\nseemed absolutely worthless except now and then there were small\r\nvalleys highly cultivated.  In the early morning we were in the\r\nvalley of the San Joaquin, where wide fields extend all along both\r\nsides.  Here we saw thousands of acres of land covered by growing\r\nwheat without a fence to protect it.\r\n\r\nArriving at Oakland we crossed the bay to San Francisco on the 18th\r\nof May, stopping at the Palace hotel.  There I was called upon by\r\nreporters of the several papers and was asked to tell them where\r\nI came from, where I was going, and my opinions upon various\r\nsubjects.  All manner of questions were asked and answered about\r\nmatters of no present interest.  Our party visited many places of\r\ninterest in and about San Francisco.  I visited General Pope, at\r\nhis residence at Black Point, the fort at the entrance of the Golden\r\nGate, the seal rocks and park.  While here I met a great number of\r\nvery agreeable gentlemen and ladies, some of whom were from Lancaster,\r\nOhio.  The letters given me by General Sherman introduced me to\r\nprominent men, who were very kind and courteous.  On the 25th, a\r\npublic reception was tendered me at the rooms of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce, by the members of that body, the Board of Trade and the\r\nManufacturers' Association.  This was an act of courtesy that I\r\ndid not expect, but greatly appreciated.  The usual speech making\r\noccurred.  I was introduced by Henry L. Dodge, president of the\r\nchamber, in flattering terms, and responded in a brief speech.  I\r\nrecalled to them my visit to California with Colonel Scott in\r\nconnection with the Texas Pacific railroad, and the early connection\r\nof General Sherman with the history of California.  I expressed my\r\nappreciation of the importance of California, and its enormous\r\ndevelopment and influence upon the country since it became part of\r\nthe United States.  I stated my views in respect to the silver\r\nquestion, and the importance of maintaining all forms of money at\r\nparity with each other, so that coins of both silver and gold might\r\n\"travel all over the world equal to each other in every land and\r\nin every part.\"  I insert two passages from this speech, which,\r\nthough it did not conform to their opinions and interests, was\r\nkindly received by the intelligent body of merchants present.  I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It is due to frankness and manhood for me to say that in the\r\ncountry there is a feeling now, that if the present system should\r\nbe continued unchanged, the result would be that gold would be\r\ndemonetized, being worth more than silver as coined by the government\r\nof the United States.  The opinion prevails that the only thing to\r\nremedy this is to buy the silver and gold, or take them from the\r\nminer and coin them at the same rate, of equal market value, in\r\ncoins, one for the other, so that they would travel, side by side,\r\nwithout depreciation or discount.  There is an inclination in the\r\neastern states, not of hostility to silver, but of hostility to\r\nthat system which would take from the miner the fruit of his labor\r\nat its market rate and issue it at a depreciated rate; so that even\r\ncautious people would doubt whether or not this silver money will\r\nhereafter be as good as gold money.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you success in all your business enterprises.  I know your\r\nsuccess will contribute to the happiness of our country.  I am glad\r\nto be able to congratulate the merchants of San Francisco upon the\r\nenormous growth and prosperity of our country, not only of California,\r\nnot only of San Francisco, Los Angeles and the other beautiful\r\ntowns you have in your midst, but the whole country; for although\r\nwe have sometimes here and there waves of dejection, after all,\r\nour country is moving forward in bounding prosperity.  We have now\r\nthe best currency that exists on the globe.  Our credit is unrivaled\r\nin all the world, for no nation can borrow money at so low a rate\r\nas our United States bonds now bear.  Our general prosperity is\r\nincreasing and abounding, and although, as I have said, there may\r\nbe waves here and there, the progress is onward and upward and\r\nhopeful.  I trust you will be prosperous in your enterprises, that\r\nyou will share in the common prosperity of our whole country, for,\r\nafter all, the energy of your people of San Francisco and California\r\nshould not be expended entirely alone on the Pacific coast.  This\r\nwhole boundless continent is ours, and only awaits the time when\r\nwe choose to assert our right to take it and hold it.\"\r\n\r\nAt the invitation of Senator John F. Miller I spent a day on his\r\nranch in Napa valley.  It was a beautiful country, neither a prairie\r\nnor a woodland, but more like a fine cultivated park, with here\r\nand there groups of trees planted by nature.  I made several\r\nexcursions around the bay, accompanied by General Pope and members\r\nof his staff.  I was delighted with my visit in and around San\r\nFrancisco, not only for the natural beauty of the country, but also\r\non account of the kindness of its inhabitants.  I was no doubt\r\nindebted for this to my connection with General Sherman, who seemed\r\nto be known and greatly beloved by everyone.\r\n\r\nI have a pleasant recollection of a reception given at the Dirigo\r\nclub.  The gentlemen present were not all young men, though they\r\nchose to regard themselves as such.  Major Chamberlain delivered\r\na brief address of welcome, in which he referred to the \"martial\r\nservices of General Sherman and the pacific achievements of the\r\nSenator,\" and drew a comparison highly complimentary to both of\r\nthe brothers.  William W. Morrow, Member of Congress, formally\r\nwelcomed me as a guest of the club and delivered a short but eloquent\r\nspeech.  I made a brief reply and then the company was served with\r\nrefreshments, entertained with music and had a free and friendly\r\ntime.  The reception was a decided success as was to be expected\r\nfrom the high reputation of the club.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May we started northward towards Sacramento and\r\nPortland, Oregon.  Senator Leland Stanford was kind enough to\r\nfurnish us a car and accompanied us to his ranch at Vina.  We\r\nstopped at Chico long enough to visit the ranch of John Bidwell,\r\ncontaining 20,000 acres.  He met us at the station and we were soon\r\nconveyed to his mansion such as is seldom built on a farm.  We\r\ndrove through orchards of peach, apricot, cherry, apple, pear and\r\nalmond trees, while in his gardens were all kinds of berries and\r\nvegetables.  After this brief visit we proceeded along the line of\r\nrailroad to Vina, the extensive possession of Senator Stanford,\r\ncontaining 56,000 acres.  Here is said to be the largest vineyard\r\nin the world, 3,600 acres.  On leaving Mr. Stanford we proceeded\r\nto the terminus of the railroad, from which point we crossed the\r\ncoast range of mountains in a stage, and were for three days in\r\nsight of Mt. Shasta.  This mountain rising from the plains stands\r\nout by itself 14,400 feet above the level of the sea.  Between\r\nShasta and the Sierras proper there is no continuity, nor is there\r\nwith the coast range.  More properly it is a butte, a lone mountain.\r\nShortly after leaving Southern's the castle rocks came in view,\r\nthe highest and boldest mountains in close proximity, or within\r\nour view.  Shasta was crowned with snow, the snow line beginning\r\n7,000 feet from its base.  The scene all day had been rugged and\r\nbold, and as we traveled by the Sacramento River, here a rapid\r\nmountain stream, its waters rushed along the rocky bottom, now\r\nconfined within narrow banks, now widening out into a wide deep\r\nbed as clear as crystal and cold and pure.  For thirty miles of\r\nour travel that day we had been in a good timbered country.  Within\r\na circle of fifty feet in diameter we counted a dozen pines, every one\r\nof which would have yielded ten to twelve thousand feet of sawed\r\ntimber.  Flowers of the richest colors were found in the woods,\r\nand the range afforded feed for thousands of cattle.  At Southern's\r\nwe took a spring-top wagon in which to ride sixteen miles over the\r\nmountains.  We spent three days in the journey between Delta,\r\nCalifornia, and Ashland, Oregon, the two ends of the railway\r\napproaching towards each other.  I recall it as the most charming\r\nmountain ride I ever took.  While crossing the mountain I occupied\r\na seat with the driver and much of the time I held the reins.  The\r\nascent of the Siskiyou mountain was very tedious.  Much of the way\r\nthe load was too heavy for our six horses to pull, and many dismounted\r\nfrom the coach, among them the driver; the reins were placed in my\r\nhands and we transferred most of the baggage from the boot to the\r\nbody of the coach.  So we climbed the Siskiyou 5,000 feet to the\r\nsummit of the pass.  Then on a gallop, with the coach full, we\r\nturned downward.  At one time, as the lead team turned a sharp\r\ncurve, it was nearly opposite the stage.  Down, still down, and on\r\nthe full gallop, we arrived at Ashland on the evening of the 31st\r\nof May, and remained there one day.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June we followed the line of the Willamette valley,\r\na productive region for the cultivation of wheat and other cereals.\r\nAt Albany we were met by Governor Moody and Secretary Earnhart,\r\nwho welcomed us to Oregon.  With these officials we went to Salem,\r\nthe capital city of the state.  My visit in Salem was a very pleasant\r\none and I was especially indebted to Governor Moody for his courtesy\r\nand kindness.  On the morning of the next day, the 2nd of June, we\r\nleft Salem and rode down the valley to Portland.  This, the principal\r\ncity of Oregon, then contained a population of nearly 40,000, of\r\nwhom 6,000 or 7,000 were Chinese.  It was the natural head of\r\nnavigation of the Columbia River, and was a flourishing handsome\r\ncity of the American type, in this respect unlike the cities of\r\nCalifornia.  General Miles was then in command of the military\r\ndistrict, with his residence at Fort Vancouver, Washington Territory.\r\nThe military post of Vancouver was then on the north bank of the\r\nColumbia River, but a few miles from Portland.  Mrs. Miles is the\r\ndaughter of my brother Charles, and I remained with their family\r\nin Vancouver during my two or three days stay there, my traveling\r\ncompanions making their headquarters at Portland.\r\n\r\nWhen visiting Tacoma and Seattle our party had been increased to\r\nthe number of seventeen gentlemen, some of them connected with the\r\narmy, some with the railroads, and others who joined us in our\r\nprogress around the waters of Puget Sound and strait of Juan de\r\nFuca.  These waters furnish perhaps the finest harbors in the world.\r\nThey are deep, with high banks rising in some places to mountains,\r\nand capable of holding all the navies of the world.  In a military\r\nsense Puget Sound can be easily defended from an enemy coming from\r\nthe sea, and, though the country is mountainous, it is capable of\r\nsustaining a large population in the extensive valleys both east\r\nand west of the coast range.  I have visited this portion of the\r\nUnited States on three occasions, and am always more and more\r\nimpressed with its great importance and its probably rapid increase\r\nof population and wealth.  I will not dwell longer on this interesting\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nWe left Portland on the 7th of June and proceeded on the Northern\r\nPacific railroad to Tacoma.  On the train we met Charles Francis\r\nAdams, Jr., with a party of railway managers, and in Tacoma we met\r\nan old friend, a gallant and able officer, General John W. Sprague,\r\nformerly from Erie county, Ohio, and more recently connected with\r\nthe Northern Pacific Railway Company.  On Sunday, our party, including\r\nMr. Adams, dined with General Sprague.  We had not as yet been able\r\nto see Mount Tacoma in its glory, as it was constantly shrouded by\r\nclouds.  In the course of the dinner, Mr. Adams said humorously to\r\nMrs. Sprague that he had some doubts whether there was a Mount\r\nTacoma, that he had come there to see it and looked in the right\r\ndirection, but could not find it.  I saw that this nettled Mrs.\r\nSprague, but she said nothing.  In a few moments she left the table\r\nand soon came back with a glowing face, saying, \"You can see Tacoma\r\nnow!\"  We all left our places at the tables and went out on the\r\nporch, and there was Mount Tacoma in all its glory.  The clouds\r\nwere above the head of the mountain and it stood erect, covered\r\nwith snow, one of the most beautiful sights in nature.  Mr. Adams\r\nsaid:  \"Tacoma--yes Mount Tacoma is there and is very beautiful!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of June we visited Victoria in British Columbia.  On\r\nour return we stopped at Port Townsend and Seattle.  I received\r\nmany courtesies from gentlemen at Seattle, many of whom had been\r\nnatives or residents of Ohio, and among them Governor Squire, who\r\nhad read law in Cleveland and was admitted to the bar in Mansfield,\r\nwhere I resided. Among other events we were tendered a reception\r\nand a banquet at Tacoma, at which seventy persons sat at the table.\r\nI was introduced in complimentary terms and expressed my surprise\r\nat the rapid growth of Tacoma and Seattle and that part of our\r\ncountry.  It was a wonder, I said, that such a scene could occur\r\nin a place that had so recently been without an inhabitant except\r\nIndians, and where, but a few years before, the Walla Wallas and\r\nthe Nez Percés were on the war path and General Miles was in pursuit\r\nof them.  I referred to the unrivaled body of water, Puget Sound,\r\nand said that in the geography of the world it was not equaled.\r\nI referred, also, to the coal fields and other elements of wealth\r\nscattered through the then territory.  I carefully avoided the\r\nsubject of the rivalry between Tacoma and Seattle, but after all\r\nI found there was no ill-will between the two places.  Speeches\r\nwere also made by Governor Squire, Mr. Adams, General Miles and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Portland on the 12th of June, but before that we\r\nvisited Astoria, looked into the great industry of salmon packing,\r\nand were greeted by quite a number of old Ohioans.  On our return\r\nwe visited Walla Walla and there saw wheat growing that yielded\r\nfifty bushels to the acre.  We remained over, also, at Spokane\r\nFalls, then a mere village with a few houses, since become quite\r\na city.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miles and I drove in a buggy from Spokane to Fort Coeur\r\nd'Alène, a military post which he wished to visit and inspect.  It\r\nis situated on a lake which is famous for the abundance of its\r\nfish.  From there we took the cars to Helena, where we remained a\r\nday, and then proceeded to St. Paul, where we arrived on the 21st\r\nof June.  Here again we found the interviewer, who wanted to know\r\nmy opinion about Cleveland, the silver question, the Chinese and\r\nvarious other topics.  I pleaded ignorance on all these matters,\r\nbut told the reporter that if he would call upon me in the course\r\nof a month I would be able to answer his questions.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Paul we went to Milwaukee and there crossed Lake Michigan\r\nand thence by rail to Grand Rapids, where I had a number of\r\nacquaintances and some business.  We then proceeded by way of\r\nDetroit and Sandusky to our home at Mansfield about the 24th of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nREUNION OF THE \"SHERMAN BRIGADE.\"\r\nPatriotic Address Delivered at Woodstock, Conn., On My Return from\r\nthe Pacific Coast--Meeting of the Surviving Members of the Sherman\r\nFamily at Mansfield--We Attend the Reunion of the \"Sherman Brigade\"\r\nat Odell's Lake--Addresses of General Sherman and Myself to the\r\nOld Soldiers and Others Present--Apathy of the Republican Party\r\nDuring the Summer of 1885--Contest Between Foraker and Hoadley for\r\nthe Governorship--My Speech at Mt. Gilead Denounced as \"Bitterly\r\nPartisan\"--Governor Hoadley Accuses Me of \"Waving the Bloody Shirt\"\r\n--My Reply at Lebanon--Election of Foraker--Frauds in Cincinnati\r\nand Columbus--Speeches Made in Virginia.\r\n\r\nUpon my return from the Pacific coast I found a mass of letters to\r\nbe answered, and many interviewers in search of news, and I had\r\nsome engagements to speak for which I had made no preparations.\r\nAmong the latter was a promise to attend a celebration of the\r\napproaching 4th of July at Woodstock, Connecticut, under the auspices\r\nof Henry C. Bowen of the New York \"Independent.\"  He had for several\r\nyears conducted these celebrations at his country home at much\r\nexpense, and made them specially interesting by inviting prominent\r\nmen to deliver patriotic addresses suitable for Independence Day.\r\nGeneral Logan and I were to attend on this occasion.  I selected\r\nas my theme \"America of to-day as contrasted with America of 1776.\"\r\nI prepared an address with as much care as my limited time would\r\nallow, giving an outline of the history of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and the prominent part taken by the sons of Connecticut\r\nin this and other great works of the American Revolution.  The\r\naddress was published in the \"Independent.\"  I have read it recently,\r\nand do not see where it could be improved by me.  The outline of\r\nthe growth of the United States presents the most remarkable\r\ndevelopment in the history of mankind.  I closed with the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"It has been my good fortune, within the last two months, to traverse\r\neleven states and territories, all of which were an unbroken\r\nwilderness in the possession of savage tribes when the declaration\r\nwas adopted, now occupied by 15,000,000 people--active, intelligent,\r\nenterprising citizens, enjoying all the advantages of modern\r\ncivilization.  What a change!  The hopeful dreams of Washington\r\nand Jefferson and Franklin could not have pictured, as the probable\r\nresult of their patriotic efforts, such scenes as I saw; cities\r\nrivaling in population and construction the capitals of Europe;\r\ntowns and villages without number full of active life and hope;\r\nwheat fields, orchards, and gardens in place of broad deserts\r\ncovered by sage brush; miners in the mountains, cattle on the\r\nplains, the fires of Vulcan in full blast in thousands of workshops;\r\nall forms of industry, all means of locomotion.\r\n\r\n\"Who among us would not be impressed by such scenes?  Who can look\r\nover our broad country, rich in every resource, a climate and soil\r\nsuited to every production, a home government for every community,\r\na national government to protect all alike, and not feel a profound\r\nsentiment of gratitude, first of all to the great Giver of all\r\ngifts, and next to our Revolutionary fathers who secured, by their\r\nblood and sacrifices, the liberty we enjoy, and by their wisdom\r\nmoulded the people of the United States into one great nation, with\r\na common hope and destiny?\r\n\r\n\"And this generation may fairly claim that it has strengthened the\r\nwork of the fathers, has made freedom universal, and disunion\r\nimpossible.  Let the young men of to-day, heirs of a great heritage,\r\ntake up the burden of government, soon to fall upon their shoulders,\r\nanimated by the patriotic fire of the Revolution and the love of\r\nliberty and union that inspired our soldiers in the Civil War,\r\nturning their back upon all the animosities of that conflict, but\r\nclinging with tenacious courage to all its results, and they will,\r\nin their generation, double the population and quadruple the wealth\r\nand resources of our country.  Above all, they should keep the\r\nUnited States of American in the forefront of progress, intelligence,\r\neducation, temperance, religion, and in all the virtues that tend\r\nto elevate, refine, and ennoble mankind.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan delivered an eloquent and patriotic speech that was\r\nreceived by his audience with great applause.  He was personally\r\na stranger to the Connecticut people, but his western style and\r\nmanner, unlike the more reserved and quiet tone of their home\r\norators, gave them great pleasure.  Senators Hawley and Platt also\r\nspoke.  It is needless to say that our host provided us with\r\nbountiful creature comforts.  On the whole we regarded the celebration\r\nas a great success.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of August, 1885, my surviving brothers and\r\nsisters visited my wife and myself at our residence in Mansfield.\r\nColonel Moulton and the wives of General and Hoyt Sherman were also\r\npresent.  Several of my numerous nephews and nieces visited us with\r\ntheir parents.  The then surviving brothers were W. T. Sherman,\r\nLampson P. Sherman, John Sherman, and Hoyt Sherman, and the surviving\r\nsisters were Mrs. Elizabeth Reese and Mrs. Fanny B. Moulton.  The\r\nbrothers and sisters who died before this meeting were Charles T.\r\nSherman, James Sherman, Mrs. McComb, Mrs. Willock and Mrs. Bartley.\r\nAll of the family attended with me the reunion of the \"Sherman\r\nBrigade,\" at its camp at Odell's Lake.  On the arrival of the train\r\nat the lake we found a great crowd of soldiers and citizens waiting\r\nto meet General Sherman.  The brigade had served under his command\r\nfrom Chattanooga to Atlanta.  They received him with great respect\r\nand affection and he was deeply moved by their hearty greetings.\r\nHe shook hands with all who could reach him, but the crowd of\r\nvisitors was so great that many of them could not do so.  The\r\nencampment was located at the west end of the lake, justly celebrated\r\nfor the natural beauty of its scenery, and a favorite resort for\r\npicnic excursions from far and near.  We arrived at about twelve\r\no'clock and were at once conducted to a stand in the encampment\r\ngrounds, where again the hand-shaking commenced, and continued for\r\nsome time.  General Sherman and I were called upon for speeches.\r\nHe was disinclined to speak, and said he preferred to wander around\r\nthe camp but insisted that I should speak.  I was introduced by\r\nGeneral Finley, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers and Citizens, Ladies and Gentlemen:--I saw in one of your\r\npublished statements that I was to make an address on this occasion.\r\nThat is not exactly according to the fact.  I did not agree to make\r\na speech.  One year ago, when the Sherman Brigade met at Shelby,\r\nI did, according to promise, make a prepared speech, giving the\r\nhistory of the organization of the 'Sherman Brigade,' and a copy\r\nof that, I understand, was sent to surviving members of that brigade.\r\nBut few will care for this, but it may interest the wives or children\r\nof these soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Now I do not intend to make a speech, but only a few remarks\r\npreliminary to those that will be made to you by one more worthy\r\nto speak to soldiers than I am.\r\n\r\n\"I have always understood that at soldiers' reunions the most\r\nagreeable portion of the proceedings is to have the old soldiers\r\ngather around the campfire to tell their stories of the war, to\r\nexchange their recollections of the trying period through which\r\nthey passed from 1861 to 1865; to exchange greetings, to exhibit\r\ntheir wives and children to each other, and to meet with their\r\nneighbors in a social way and thus recall the events of a great\r\nperiod in American history.  And this is really the object of these\r\nreunions.\r\n\r\n\"You do not meet here to hear speeches from those, who, like myself,\r\nwere engaged in civil pursuits during the war, and therefore, I\r\nnever am called before a soldiers' reunion but I feel compelled to\r\nmake an apology for speaking.\"\r\n\r\nI referred to General Grant and his recent death, and then to\r\nGeneral Sherman as follows:\r\n\r\n\"There is another of those commanders, who is here before you to-\r\nday.  What is he?  He is now a retired army officer.  When the war\r\nwas over he became the General in Chief of the army, served until\r\nthe time fixed by the law for his retirement, and now he is a\r\nprivate citizen, as plain and simple in his bearing and manners as\r\nany other of the citizens who now surround him.  These are the kind\r\nof heroes a republic makes, and these are the kind of heroes we\r\nworship as one free man may worship another.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman was then introduced to the vast audience, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Comrades and Friends:--A few days ago I was up on the banks of\r\nLake Minnetonka, and was summoned here to northern Ohio to participate\r\nin a family reunion.  I knew my brother's house in Mansfield was\r\nlarge and commodious, sufficient to receive the survivors of the\r\nfirst generation of the family, but I also knew that if he brought\r\nin the second and third generations he would have to pitch a camp\r\nsomewhere, and I find he has chosen this at Odell's Lake.  So, for\r\nthe time being, my friends, you must pass as part of the Sherman\r\nfamily, not as 'the Sherman Brigade,' and you must represent the\r\nsecond and third generations of a very numerous family.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it is not my trade or vocation to make orations or\r\nspeeches.  I see before me many faces that look to me as though\r\nthey were once soldiers, and to them I feel competent to speak; to\r\nthe others I may not be so fortunate.\r\n\r\n\"But, very old comrades of the war, you who claim to be in 'Sherman's\r\nBrigade' or in any other brigade, who took a part in the glorious\r\nCivil War, the fruits of which we are now enjoying, I hail and\r\nthank you for the privilege of being with you this beautiful day\r\nin this lovely forest and by the banks of yonder lake, not that I\r\ncan say anything that will please you or profit you, but there is\r\na great pleasure in breathing the same air, in thinking the same\r\nthoughts, in feeling the same inspirations for the future, which\r\nevery member of the 'Sherman Brigade' and the children who have\r\nsucceeded them must, in contemplating the condition of our country\r\nat this very moment of time.  Peace universal, not only at home\r\nbut abroad, and America standing high up in the niche of nations,\r\nenvied of all mankind and envied because we possess all the powers\r\nof a great nation vindicated by a war of your own making and your\r\nown termination.  Yes, my fellow-soldiers, you have a right to sit\r\nbeneath your own vine and fig tree and be glad, for you can be\r\nafraid of no man.  You have overcome all enemies, save death, which\r\nwe must all meet as our comrades who have gone before us have done,\r\nand submit.  But as long as we live let us come together whenever\r\nwe can, and if we can bring back the memories of those glorious\r\ndays it will do us good, and, still more, good to the children who\r\nwill look up to us as examples.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to speak for fifteen minutes or more, and closed with\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, of course I am an old man now, passing off the stage\r\nof life.  I realize that, and I assure you that I now think more\r\nof the days of the Mexican War, the old California days, and of\r\nthe early days of the Civil War, than I do of what occurred last\r\nweek, and I assure you that, let it come when it may, I would be\r\nglad to welcome the old 'Sherman Brigade' to my home and my fireside,\r\nlet it be either in St. Louis or on the banks of the Columbia River\r\nin Oregon.  May God smile upon you, and give you his choicest\r\nblessings.  You live in a land of plenty.  I do not advise you to\r\nemigrate, but I assure you, wherever you go, you will find comrades\r\nand soldiers to take you by the hand and be glad to aid you as\r\ncomrades.\"\r\n\r\nThe gathering was a thoroughly enjoyable one, and was often recalled\r\nby those present.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1885 there was much languor apparent in the\r\nRepublican party.  President Cleveland was pursuing a conservative\r\npolicy, removals from office were made slowly, and incumbents were\r\nallowed to serve out their time.  Foraker and Hoadley were again\r\nnominated in Ohio for governor by their respective parties, and\r\nthe contest between them was to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThere was a feeling among Republicans of humiliation and shame that\r\nthe people had placed in power the very men who waged war against\r\nthe country for years, created a vast public debt, and destroyed\r\nthe lives of hundreds of thousands of people.  This feeling was\r\nintensified by the fact that Republicans in the south were ostracised\r\nand deprived of all political power or influence.  In the Democratic\r\nparty there were signs of dissension.  Charges of corruption in\r\nOhio, in the election of Payne as Senator in the place of Pendleton,\r\nwere openly made, and the usual discontent as to appointments to\r\noffice that follows a change of administration was manifest.  Under\r\nthese conditions I felt it to be my duty to take a more active part\r\nin the approaching canvass than ever before.  On the 13th of August,\r\nI met at Columbus with Foraker and the state Republican committee,\r\nof which Asa S. Bushnell was chairman, and we prepared for a thorough\r\ncanvass in each county, the distribution of documents and the\r\nholding of meetings.  In addition to the state ticket there were\r\nto be elected members of the legislature.  There was no contest as\r\nto the selection of a United States Senator, as, by general\r\nacquiescence, it was understood that if the legislature should be\r\nDemocratic Thurman would be elected, and if it should be Republican\r\nI would be elected.  Governor Foster, when spoken to upon this\r\nsubject, very kindly said:\r\n\r\n\"As long as John Sherman desires to be Senator, or is willing to\r\ntake the office, there is no use for me or any other man with\r\nsenatorial aspirations to be a candidate against him.  Sherman is\r\nyet young.  He is not much over sixty, and it would be idle to\r\ndispute that he is the best equipped man in the Republican party\r\nin Ohio for that position.  He has the learning, the ability, the\r\nexperience, the popularity.\"\r\n\r\nThe organization of both parties was completed and a vigorous\r\ncanvass inaugurated.  Foraker soon after commenced a series of\r\npublic meetings extending to nearly every county in the state, and\r\neverywhere made friends by his vigorous and eloquent speeches.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th I attended a pioneer picnic at Monroe, near the division\r\nline between the counties of Butler and Warren.  This mode of\r\nreunion, mainly confined to farmers, is quite common in Ohio, and\r\nis by far the most pleasing and instructive popular assemblage held\r\nin that state.  The discussion of politics is forbidden.  The people\r\nof the country for miles around come in wagons, carriages, on\r\nhorseback and on foot, men, women and children, with their baskets\r\nfull of food and fruit, and gather in a well-shaded grove, in\r\nfamilies or groups, and discuss the crops and the news, and make\r\nnew or renew old acquaintance.  When the scattered picnic is going\r\non everyone who approaches is invited to eat.  When the appetite\r\nis satisfied all gather around a temporary platform, and speeches,\r\nlong and short, upon every topic but politics, are made.  I have\r\nattended many such meetings and all with sincere pleasure.  This\r\nparticular picnic was notable for its large attendance--estimated\r\nto be over three thousand--and the beauty of the grove and the\r\nsurrounding farms.  I made an address, or rather talked, about the\r\nearly times in Ohio, and especially in the Miami valley, a section\r\nwhich may well be regarded as among the fairest and most fruitful\r\nspots in the world.  The substance of my speech was reported and\r\npublished.  The sketch I was able to give of incidents of Indian\r\nwarfare, of the expeditions of St. Clair and Wayne, of the early\r\nsettlement in that neighborhood, and of the ancestors, mainly\r\nRevolutionary soldiers, of hundreds of those who heard me, seemed\r\nto give great satisfaction.  At the close of my remarks I was\r\nrequested by the Pioneer Society to write them out for publication,\r\nto be kept as a memorial, but I never was able to do so.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of August I made, at Mt. Gilead, Morrow county, my\r\nfirst political speech of the campaign.  The people of that county\r\nwere among my first constituents.  More than thirty years before,\r\nin important and stirring times, I had appeared before them as a\r\ncandidate for Congress.  I referred to the early history of the\r\nRepublican party and to the action of Lincoln and Grant in the\r\nprosecution of the war, and contrasted the opinion expressed of\r\nthem by the Democratic party then and at the time of my speech.\r\nDuring the war our party was the \"black abolition party,\" Lincoln\r\nwas an \"ape,\" Grant was a \"butcher,\" and Union soldiers were \"Lincoln\r\nhirelings.\"  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Our adversaries now concede the wisdom and success of all prominent\r\nRepublican measures, as well as the merits of the great leaders of\r\nthe Republican party.  Only a few days since I heard my colleague,\r\nSenator Payne, in addressing soldiers at Fremont, extol Lincoln\r\nand Grant in the highest terms of praise and say the war was worth\r\nall it cost and he thanked God that slavery had been abolished.\r\nOnly recently, when the great procession conveyed the mortal remains\r\nof Grant to their resting place, I heard active Confederates extol\r\nhim in the highest terms of praise and some of them frankly gloried\r\nin the success of Republican measures, and, especially, in the\r\nabolition of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nI said that the Republican party, within six years after its\r\norganization, overthrew the powerful dominant Democratic party,\r\nand for twenty-four years afterwards conducted the operations of\r\na great government in war and peace, with such success as to win\r\nthe support and acquiescence of its enemies, and could fairly claim\r\nto be worthy of the confidence and support of the great body of\r\nthe people.  The defection of a few men in three Republican states\r\nhad raised our old adversaries to power again in the national\r\ngovernment.  I continued:\r\n\r\n\"Some of the very men who boastfully threatened to break up the\r\nUnion, and, with the oath of office in support of the constitution\r\nfresh upon their lips, conspired and confederated to overthrow it,\r\nwaged war against it, and were the cause of the loss of half a\r\nmillion of lives and thousands of millions of treasure, have been\r\nplaced in high office again, in the very seats of power which they\r\nabandoned with scorn and defiance.  Two members of the Confederate\r\ncongress, and one man who sympathized with them, are at the head\r\nof great departments of the government.  I saw the Union flag at\r\nhalf-mast, floating over the interior department in sign of honor\r\nand mourning for the death of Jacob Thompson, whom we regarded as\r\na defaulter and a conspirator.  This country is now represented\r\nabroad by men, who, within twenty-five years, were in arms to\r\noverthrow it, and the governing power in the executive branch of\r\nthe government is in sympathy with the ideas of, and selects the\r\nchief officers of the government from, the men who were in war\r\nagainst it.  This strange turn in events has but one example in\r\nhistory, and that was the restoration of Charles II, after the\r\nbrilliant but brief Protectorate of Cromwell, and, like that\r\nrestoration, is a reproach to the civilization of the age.\"\r\n\r\nI referred to the \"solid south,\" and the means by which it was held\r\ntogether in political fellowship by crimes, violence and fraud\r\nwhich, if continued, would as surely renew all the strifes of the\r\nCivil War as that the sun would roll around in its course.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the Republican party and its liberality I said:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican party was certainly liberal and just to the rebels\r\nlately in arms against the country.  We deprived them of no political\r\npower, no blood was shed; no confiscation was had; and more generous\r\nterms were conceded to them than ever before had been extended to\r\nan unsuccessful party in a civil war.  Their leaders emphasized\r\nthat at the burial of our great commander, General Grant.  The\r\nresult of the settlement by the constitutional amendments at the\r\nclose of the war was to give them increased political power, upon\r\ncondition that the slaves should be free and should be allowed to\r\nvote, and that all political distinction growing out of race, color\r\nor previous condition of servitude shall be abolished; and yet to-\r\nday, the Republican party is faced by a 'solid south,' in which\r\nthe negro is deprived, substantially, of all his political rights,\r\nby open violence or by frauds as mean as any that have been committed\r\nby penitentiary convicts, and as openly and boldly done as any\r\nhighway robbery.  By this system, and by the acquiescence of a few\r\nnorthern states, the men who led in the Civil War have been restored\r\nto power, and hope, practically, to reverse all the results of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"This is the spectre that now haunts American politics, and may\r\nmake it just as vital and necessary to appeal to the northern states\r\nto unite again against this evil, not so open and arrogant as\r\nslavery, but more dangerous and equally unjust.  The question then\r\nwas the slavery of the black man.  Now the question is the equality\r\nof the white man, whether a southern man in Mississippi may, by\r\ndepriving a majority of the legal voters in the state of their\r\nright to vote, exercise twice the political power of a white man\r\nin the north, where the franchise is free and open and equal to all.\r\n\r\n\"When we point out these offenses committed in the south, it is\r\nsaid that we are raising the bloody shirt, that we are reviving\r\nthe issues of the war--that the war is over.  I hope the war is\r\nover, and that the animosities of the war will pass away, and be\r\ndead and buried.  Anger and hate and prejudice are not wise counselors\r\nin peace or in war.  Generosity, forgiveness and charity are great\r\nqualities of the human heart, but, like everything else that is\r\ngood, they may be carried to excess, and may degenerate into faults.\r\nThey must not lead us to forget the obligations of duty and honor.\r\nWhile we waive the animosities of the war, we must never fail to\r\nhold on, with courage and fortitude, to all the results of the\r\nwar.  Our soldiers fought in no holiday contest, not merely to test\r\nthe manly qualities of the men of the north and the south, not for\r\npower or plunder, or wealth or title.  They fought to secure to\r\nthemselves and their posterity the blessings of a strong national\r\ngovernment; the preservation of the Union--a Union not of states,\r\nbut of the people of the United States; not a confederate government,\r\nbut a national government.  The preservation of the Union was the\r\ncentral idea of the war.  The Confederate soldier fought for what\r\nhe was led to think was the right of a state to secede from the\r\nUnion at its pleasure.  The Union soldiers triumphed.  The Confederate\r\nsoldiers were compelled to an unconditional surrender.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, the line drawn between the two parties is now as\r\ndistinct as it was during the war, but we occupy a different field\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\n\"Then we fought for the preservation of the Union, and, as a means\r\nto that end, for the abolition of slavery.  Now the Union is saved\r\nand slavery is abolished, we fight for the equal political rights\r\nof all men, and the faithful observance of the constitutional\r\namendments.  We are for the exercise of national authority, for\r\nthe preservation of rights conferred by the constitution, and upon\r\nthis broad issue we invite co-operation from the south as well as\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this issue we intend to make our appeal to the honest and\r\nhonorable people of the southern states.  We think they are bound\r\nin honor to faithfully observe the conditions of peace granted to\r\nthem by General Grant and prescribed by the constitutional amendments.\r\nIf they do this we will have peace, union and fraternity.  Without\r\nit we will have agitation, contests and complaints.  Upon this\r\nissue I will go before the people of the south, and, turning my\r\nback upon all the animosities of the war, appeal only to their\r\nsense of honor and justice.\"\r\n\r\nI contrasted the policy and tendencies of the two parties on the\r\nquestion of protection to American industry, on good money redeemable\r\nin coin, on frauds in elections, on our pension laws, and on all\r\nthe political questions of the day.  I stated and approved the\r\npolicy of the Republican party on the temperance question.  I closed\r\nwith an exhortation to support Governor Foraker and the Republican\r\nticket and to elect a legislature that would place Ohio where she\r\nhad usually stood, in the fore front of Republican states, for the\r\nUnion, for liberty and justice to all, without respect of race,\r\nnativity and creed.\r\n\r\nThis speech was denounced by the Democratic press as \"bitterly\r\npartisan;\" and so it was and so intended.  The Republican party\r\nduring its long possession of power had divided into factions, as\r\nthe Democratic party had in 1860.  We had the Blaine, the Conkling\r\nand other factions, and many so-called third parties, and the\r\ndistinctive principles upon which the Republican party was founded\r\nwere in danger of being forgotten.  It was my purpose to arouse\r\nthe attention to the Republicans in Ohio to the necessity of union\r\nand organization, and I believe this speech contributed to that\r\nresult.  It was the text and foundation of nearly all I uttered in\r\nthe canvass that followed.\r\n\r\nEarly in September Governor Hoadley, in commencing his campaign in\r\nHamilton, assailed by speech at Mt. Gilead, charging me with waving\r\nthe bloody shirt, and reviving the animosities of the war.  He\r\nclaimed to be a friend of the negro, but did not deny the facts\r\nstated by me.  He allowed himself to be turned from local questions,\r\nsuch as temperance, schools, economy, and the government of cities,\r\nin all of which the people of Ohio had a deep interest, and as to\r\nwhich the Democratic party had a defined policy, to national\r\nquestions, and, especially, to reconstruction and the treatment of\r\nfreedmen in the south.  He thanked God for the \"solid south.\"\r\nThough an Abolitionist of the Chase school in early life, and,\r\nuntil recently an active Republican, he ignored or denied the\r\nsuppression of the negro vote, the organized terror and cruelty of\r\nthe Ku-Klux Klan, and the almost daily outrages published in the\r\npapers.  On the evening of the 8th of September I made a speech at\r\nLebanon, in which I reviewed his speech at Hamilton in the adjoining\r\ncounty.  I said I would wave the bloody shirt as long as it remained\r\nbloody.  I referred to the copious evidence of outrage and wrong,\r\nincluding many murders of negroes and of white Republicans, published\r\nin official reports, and challenged him to deny it.  I said that\r\nby these crimes the south was made solid, and the men who had waged\r\nwar against the United States, though they failed in breaking up\r\nthe Union, then held the political power of the Confederate states,\r\nstrengthened by counting all the negroes as free men, though\r\npractically denying them the right of suffrage.  I said this was\r\nnot only unjust to the colored man but unjust to the white men of\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I said:\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-eight Members of Congress, and of the electoral college,\r\nare based upon the six million of colored people in the south.\r\nThe effect of the crimes I have mentioned is to confer upon the\r\nwhite people of the south, not only the number of votes to which\r\nthey are entitled for the white population, but also the thirty-\r\neight votes based upon the colored population, and, in this way,\r\nin some of the southern states, every white voter possesses the\r\npolitical power of two white voters in the northern states.  The\r\ncolored people have, practically, no voice in Congress and no voice\r\nin the electoral college.  Mr. Cleveland is now President of the\r\nUnited States, instead of James G. Blaine, by reason of these\r\ncrimes.  I claim that this should be corrected.  An injustice so\r\ngross and palpable will not be submitted to by the colored people\r\nof the south, nor by fair-minded white men in the south who hate\r\nwrong and injustice; nor by the great northern people, by whose\r\nsacrifices in the Union cause the war was brought to a successful\r\ntermination.  It will not be submitted to, and Governor Hoadley,\r\nfrom his former position, ought to be one of the first to demand\r\nand insist upon a remedy, and not seek to avoid or belittle it by\r\ncant phrases.\"\r\n\r\nAfter I had spoken in the opera house at Lebanon I was told that\r\nthe stage I occupied was within a few feet of the place where my\r\nfather died.  The room in the old hotel in which he was taken sick,\r\nand in which he died within twenty-four hours, covered the ground\r\nnow occupied by the east end of the opera house.  As already stated,\r\nhe died while a member of the supreme court holding court at\r\nLebanon.\r\n\r\nThis debate at long range continued through the canvass.  Governor\r\nHoadley is an able man with many excellent traits, but in his\r\npolitical life he did not add to his reputation, and wisely chose\r\na better occupation, the practice of his profession in the city of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to enter into details as to the many speeches\r\nmade by me in this canvass.  I spoke nearly every day until the\r\nelection on the 13th of October.  While Foraker and Hoadley continued\r\ntheir debate I filled such appointments as were made for me by Mr.\r\nBushnell.  At Toledo, when conversing with a gentleman about the\r\ncondition of affairs in the south, I was asked \"What are you going\r\nto do about it?\"  In reply to this inquiry I said in my speech, at\r\nthat place:  \"I do not know exactly how we are going to do it, but\r\nwith the help of God we are going to arrange that the vote of the\r\nman who followed Lee shall no longer have, in national affairs,\r\nthree times the power of the vote of the man who followed Grant.\r\nThe tendency of events guided by a growing popular opinion will,\r\nI believe, secure this condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe meetings grew in number and enthusiasm.  The largest meeting\r\nI ever witnessed within four walls was at the Music Hall in\r\nCincinnati, on the 22nd of September.  The auditorium, the balcony,\r\nthe gallery, even the windows were filled, and thousands outside\r\nwere unable to enter.  This and similar scenes in Cleveland and\r\nother cities indicated the success of the Republican ticket.  Great\r\ninterest was taken in the canvass in Ohio by many other states, as\r\nthe vote in Ohio would indicate the current of popular opinion.\r\nThe result was the election of Foraker by a majority of 17,451,\r\nand of Robert P. Kennedy as lieutenant governor.  The legislature\r\nelected was Republican by a decided majority, the size of which\r\ndepended upon the official returns from Hamilton county, where\r\nfrauds had been committed by the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nSoon after the election I was urged by Senator Mahone to take part\r\nin the canvass in Virginia in which he was interested.  I doubted\r\nthe policy of accepting, but, assuming that he knew best, I agreed\r\nto speak in Petersburg and Richmond.  Governor Foraker accepted a\r\nlike invitation and spoke in the Shenandoah valley.  On my way I\r\naddressed a spontaneous crowd in Washington, the only place in the\r\nUnited States where no elections are held, and there I could talk\r\nabout frauds at elections.  I had denounced fraud and violence in\r\nelections in the south, and at Washington I had to confess recent\r\nfrauds attempted or practiced in Cincinnati.  The worst feature\r\nthat the frauds in Ohio were forgery and perjury, committed by\r\ncriminals of low degree for money, while in the south the crimes\r\nwere shared by the great body of the people and arose from the\r\nembers of a war that had involved the whole country.  I gave as a\r\nsample of the frauds in the 4th ward of Cincinnati this instance:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the recent election was over an organized gang stopped\r\nthe counting in fifteen precincts.  Nobody but the gang knew what\r\nthe vote was.  This could be for no motive but to commit fraud,\r\nand frauds enough were committed in Hamilton county to change the\r\nresult on the legislative ticket of four senators and nine\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\"There were probably 500 or 600 voters in the 4th ward, and according\r\nto previous elections about one-fourth were Republicans and the\r\nrest were Democrats.  Well, they made up a registration of 700.\r\nWhen the day of the election came they tore up the registration\r\npapers and let every fellow vote as many times as he wanted until\r\nthey got 996 votes in the ballot box.  Then that was not all.  The\r\nRepublican judge got angry and went away, but he took the key.\r\nThen they broke open the box, tied it up with a rope, and took it\r\nto the police officer, and then changed it so that when it was\r\ncounted over 900 votes were Democratic and only 48 Republican!\"\r\n\r\nA similar fraud was attempted at Columbus in sight of the penitentiary.\r\nThe returns of elections had been filed with the county records.\r\nBetween Saturday night and Monday morning thieves stole one of the\r\nreturns and added three hundred tallies for every Democratic\r\ncandidate, thus changing the number of ballots from 208 to 508.\r\nThe judges were about to count this return, knowing it was a forgery,\r\nwhen public indignation was aroused in the city of Columbus, shared\r\nin by its most distinguished Democratic citizens, and fraud was\r\nprevented.  I felt, and so declared, that these mean crimes were\r\ninfinitely more despicable than the violence in the south, which\r\nsprang from a fear of the southern people that their institutions\r\nwould be impaired by the votes of men debased by slavery and\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nI went from Washington to Petersburg, where I was hospitably\r\nentertained by General Mahone.  He had been greatly distinguished\r\nfor his courage, ability and success, as a Confederate general in\r\nthe Civil War, and had long been a popular favorite in Virginia.\r\nHe took the lead on questions affecting the debt of Virginia in\r\nopposition to the Democratic party, and a legislature in favor of\r\nhis opinions having been elected, he became a Senator of the United\r\nStates.  He voted as a rule with Republican Senators, but maintained\r\na marked independence of political parties.  I admired him for his\r\ncourage and fidelity, and was quite willing to speak a good word\r\nfor him in the election of a legislature that would designate his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at Petersburg was held in a large opera house on the\r\nevening of the 29th of October.  When I faced my audience the\r\ncentral part of the house and the galleries seemed to be densely\r\npacked by negroes, while in the rear was a fringe of white men.\r\nThe line of demarkation was clearly indicated by color, most of\r\nthe white men standing and seeming ill at ease.  The speech was\r\nfairly well received.  In opening I said my purpose was to demonstrate\r\nthat what the Republican party professed in Ohio as to national\r\nquestions was the same that it professed in Virginia, and that the\r\npractical application of the principles of the Republican party\r\nwould be of vast benefit to the State of Virginia, while Democratic\r\nsuccess would tend more and more to harden the times and prevent\r\nthe industrial development of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"Not only your newspaper,\" I said, \"but the distinguished gentleman\r\nwho is the Democratic candidate for Governor of the State of\r\nVirginia, has said to you that I was waving the bloody shirt while\r\nhe was contending under the Union flag.  If he meant, by waving\r\nthe bloody shirt, that I sought, in any way, to renew the animosities\r\nof the war, then he was greatly mistaken, for in the speech to\r\nwhich he refers, and in every speech I made in Ohio, I constantly\r\nsaid that the war was over and the animosities of the war should\r\nbe buried out of sight; that I would not hold any Confederate\r\nsoldier responsible for what he did during the war, and that all\r\nI wished was to maintain and preserve the acknowledged results of\r\nthe war.  Among these, I claim, is the right of every voter to cast\r\none honest vote and have it counted; that every citizen, rich or\r\npoor, native or naturalized, white or black, should have equal\r\ncivil and political rights, and that every man of lawful age should\r\nbe allowed to exercise his right to vote, without distinction of\r\nrace or color or previous condition.  I charge, among other things,\r\nthat these constitutional rights and privileges have been disregarded\r\nby the Democratic party, especially in the southern states.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was largely historical in its character and evidently\r\nrather beyond the comprehension of the body of my audience.  The\r\nscene and the surroundings made a vivid impression on my mind.\r\nHere, I felt, were two antagonistic races widely differing in every\r\nrespect, the old relations of master and slave broken, with new\r\nconditions undeveloped, the master impoverished and the slave free\r\nwithout the knowledge to direct him, and with a belief that liberty\r\nmeant license, and freedom idleness.  William McKinley, then a\r\nMember of the House of Representatives, and Green B. Raum then\r\nspoke, Mr. McKinley confining his speech mainly to a simple exposition\r\nof the tariff question, which his audience could easily understand.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at the invitation of John S. Wise, then the Republican\r\ncandidate for Governor of Virginia, I went to Richmond, and spent\r\na pleasant day with him.  In the evening I attended a mass meeting\r\nin the open air, at which there was a very large attendance.  There\r\nwas no disorder in the large crowd before me, but off to the right,\r\nat some distance, it was evident that a party of men were endeavoring\r\nto create some disturbance, and to distract attention from the\r\nspeeches.  While I was speaking Wise rose and, in terms very far\r\nfrom polite, denounced the people making the noise.  He succeeded\r\nin preventing any interruption of the meeting.  The speech was made\r\nwithout preparation, but, I think, better for the occasion that\r\nthe one in Petersburg.  I stated that I had been born and lived in\r\na region where a large portion of the population was from Virginia\r\nand Kentucky; that I had always been taught to believe in the\r\ndoctrines of the great men illustrious in Virginia history.  To\r\nthe charge made that I was engaged in waving the bloody shirt I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"If it means that I said anything in Ohio with a view to stir up\r\nthe animosities of the Civil War, then, I say, it is greatly\r\nmistaken.  I never uttered an unkind word about the people of\r\nVirginia that mortal man can quote.  I have always respected and\r\nloved the State of Virginia, its memories, its history, its record,\r\nand its achievements.\r\n\r\n\"Again, although I was a Union man from my heart and every pulsation,\r\njust as my friend Wise was a Confederate soldier, yet I never heard\r\nin Ohio a man call in question either the courage or purity of\r\nmotive of any Confederate soldier who fought in the Confederate\r\nranks.  I never uttered such a sentiment.  I disclaim it.  What I\r\ndid say was this--what I say here in Richmond, and what I said in\r\nPetersburg is--that the war is over and all animosities of the war\r\nshould be buried out of sight; that I would not hold any Confederate\r\nsoldier responsible for what he did in the war, and all I ask of\r\nyou is to carry out the acknowledged results of the war; to do what\r\nyou agreed to, when Grant and Lee made their famous arrangement\r\nunder the apple tree at Appomattox; to stand by the constitution\r\nand laws of the land, to see that every man in this country, rich\r\nand poor, native and naturalized, white and black, shall have equal\r\ncivil and political rights, and the equal protection of the law.\r\nI said also, that by constitutional amendment agreed to by Virginia,\r\nevery man of proper age in this country was armed for his protection\r\nwith the right to cast one honest vote, and no more, and have that\r\nvote counted, and you, as well as I, are bound to protect every\r\nman in the enjoyment of that right.\r\n\r\n\"There is the ground I stood on in Ohio, and the ground I stand on\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nI closed my address as follows:\r\n\r\n\"And now a word to the best citizens of Richmond.  If the criminal\r\nclasses can deprive a colored man or a white Republican of his\r\nright to vote, as soon as they have accomplished it, then these\r\nrascals--because every man who resorts to this policy is a rascal\r\n--then these rascals will soon undermine their own party.  They\r\nwill begin to cheat each other after they have cheated the Republicans\r\nout of their political power.  My countrymen, there is no duty so\r\nsacred resting upon any man among you, I don't care what his politics\r\nare.  It is honesty that I like to appeal to.  I say there is no\r\nman who can be deprived of his right to vote without injuring you,\r\nfrom the wealthiest in the city of Richmond down to the humblest\r\nman among you, white or black.\r\n\r\n\"There is no crime that is meaner, there is no crime that is so\r\ndestructive to society, there is no crime so prejudicial to the\r\nman who commits it as the crime of preventing a citizen from\r\nparticipating in the government.  Here I intend to leave the\r\nquestion.  I appeal to you, of whatever party, or color, or race,\r\nor country, to give us in Virginia at this election an honest vote\r\nand an honest count, and if Lee is elected, well and good; if Wise\r\nis elected, better yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democrats carried the state and Wise was defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nELECTED PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE.\r\nDeath of Vice President Hendricks--I Am Chosen to Preside Over the\r\nUnited States Senate--Letter of Congratulation from S. S. Cox--\r\nCleveland's First Annual Message to Congress--His Views on the\r\nTariff and Condition of Our Currency--Secretary Manning's Report--\r\nGarfield's Statue Presented to the Nation by the State of Ohio--I\r\nAm Elected a Senator from Ohio for the Fifth Time--I Go to Columbus\r\nto Return Thanks to the Legislature for the Honor--Business of this\r\nSession of Congress--Attempt to Inquire Into the Methods of Electing\r\nMr. Payne to the Senate from Ohio--My Address on \"Grant and the\r\nNew South\"--Address Before the Ohio Society of New York.\r\n\r\nCongress convened on the 7th of December, 1885.  The death of Vice\r\nPresident Thomas A. Hendricks, on the 25th of November, was announced\r\nby Senator Voorhees, who offered appropriate resolutions, the\r\nconsideration of which was postponed until January 26, 1886, when\r\neloquent orations by Senators Voorhees, Hampton, Saulsbury, Evarts,\r\nRansom, Spooner and Harrison were delivered in commemoration of\r\nhis life and death.  I added my sincere tribute to his marked\r\nability and personal worth.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the session after the opening prayer, Mr.\r\nEdmunds offered the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That John Sherman, a Senator from the State of Ohio,\r\nbe and he hereby is, chosen president _pro tempore_ of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the usual form Mr. Voorhees moved to strike out the words\r\n\"John Sherman, a Senator from the State of Ohio,\" and insert \"Isham\r\nG. Harris, a Senator from the State of Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\nThis was decided in the negative by the vote of 29 yeas and 34\r\nnays, and thereupon the resolution was adopted.  I was escorted to\r\nthe chair by Senators Edmunds and Voorhees and, having taken the\r\noath prescribed by law, said:\r\n\r\n\"Senators, I return you my grateful thanks for the high honor you\r\nhave conferred upon me.\r\n\r\n\"In common with all the people of the United States I share in\r\nprofound sorrow for the death of the Vice President, especially\r\ndesignated by the constitution to act as president of the Senate.\r\nIt is an impressive lesson of the uncertain tenure by which we all\r\nhold office and life.  The contingency had happened which compels\r\nyou now, at the beginning of the session, to choose a president\r\n_pro tempore_.\r\n\r\n\"In assuming this position, without special aptitude or experience\r\nas a presiding officer, I feel that for a time, at least, I shall\r\nhave often to appeal to the habitual courtesy and forbearance of\r\nSenators.  Fortunately the rules of the Senate are simple and clear.\r\nMy aim will be to secure the ready and kindly obedience and\r\nenforcement of them, so that in an orderly way the sense of the\r\nmajority may be ascertained and the rights of the minority may be\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n\"I can only say, Senators, that while I hold this position I will\r\nendeavor, to the utmost of my ability, to be just and impartial,\r\nand I invoke from each of you assistance and forbearance.\"\r\n\r\nThis honor was unsought by me.  The public prints had, as usual,\r\ndiscussed the choice of president of the Senate, but I made no\r\nmention of it to any Senator.  I was gratified with the choice,\r\nchiefly because it would, in a measure, relieve me from burdensome\r\ndetails, and was an evidence of the good will of my associates.\r\n\r\nI received many letters of congratulation on this event, one of\r\nwhich, from Mr. Cox, I insert:\r\n\r\n  \"United States Legation,          }\r\n  \"Constantinople, January 23, 1886.}\r\n\"Dear Mr. Senator:--I am reminded by my wife of a courtesy I have\r\nneglected.  It is that of congratulation upon your accession to\r\nthe post lately held by my friend (from Muskingum county) Thomas\r\nA. Hendricks.  You have associations with that valley also, and\r\nthey are connected with the best friend I ever had in Congress,\r\nGeneral Samuel R. Curtis, with whom I used to associate in my callow\r\ncongressional days.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, I never forget the kindness with which my father used to\r\nregard C. R. Sherman, your father, for making him clerk of the\r\nsupreme court of Muskingum, in early days.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, aloof from all old Muskingum memories, or rather,\r\nscenes.  As I look out of my balcony, on this spring day in midwinter,\r\nI see the Golden Horn brimming full of ships and other evidences\r\nof interchange; and far beyond it, 'clear as a fountain in July,\r\nwhen we see each grain of gravel,' Mt. Olympus lifts a double crown\r\nof snow.\r\n\r\n\"But I only meant to testify to you, from these remote nations,\r\nthe pardonable pride of an Ohioan, and a veteran Congressman--in\r\nyour elevation.\r\n\r\n\"When you write to the general, remember me to him kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cox desired to be kindly regarded to your wife and yourself.\r\nShe joins me in felicitations.\r\n\r\n  \"With esteem, etc.,\r\n  \"S. S. Cox.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland's first annual message was delivered to the\r\nSenate on the 8th of December.  He stated that:\r\n\r\n\"The fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of\r\nan economical administration of the government justifies a reduction\r\nin the amount exacted from the people in its support.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction of\r\nthe revenue received from the government, and indirectly paid by\r\nthe people from customs duties.  The question of free trade is not\r\ninvolved, nor is there now any occasion for the general discussion\r\nof the wisdom or expediency of a protective system.\r\n\r\n\"Justice and fairness dictate that, in any modification of our\r\npresent laws relating to revenue, the industries and interests\r\nwhich have been encouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens\r\nhave large investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed.\r\nWe should also deal with the subject in such manner as to protect\r\nthe interests of American labor, which is the capital of our\r\nworkingmen; its stability and proper remuneration furnish the most\r\njustifiable pretext for a protective policy.\"\r\n\r\nThis specific principle, if fairly and justly applied to all\r\nindustries alike, would be a basis for customs duties that all\r\nwould agree to, but, when made, a struggle arises in determining\r\nthe articles to be protected, and those to be free of duty.  The\r\nPresident said that the reduction should be made of duties upon\r\nthe imported necessaries of life.  Such articles are not imported;\r\nthey are mainly produced by our own people.  By common consent the\r\nfew articles that are imported, classed as necessaries of life,\r\nand which cannot be produced in this country, are already free of\r\nduty.  When Congress undertook to reduce the revenue it was found\r\ndifficult to apply the rule suggested by the President.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more important than the present condition of our currency\r\nand coinage can claim your attention.\r\n\r\n\"Since February, 1878, the government has, under the compulsory\r\nprovisions of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at\r\nthe rate of more than $2,000,000 every month.  By this process, up\r\nto the present date, 215,759,431 silver dollars have been coined.\"\r\n\r\nHe properly stated that the mere desire to utilize the silver\r\nproduct of the country should not lead to a coinage not needed for\r\na circulating medium.  Only 50,000,000 of the silver dollars so\r\ncoined had actually found their way into circulation, leaving more\r\nthan 165,000,000 in the possession of the government, the custody\r\nof which had entailed a considerable expense for the construction\r\nof vaults for its safe deposit.  At that time the outstanding silver\r\ncertificates amounted to $93,000,000, and yet every month $2,000,000\r\nof gold from the public treasury was paid out for two millions or\r\nmore silver dollars to be added to the idle mass already accumulated.\r\nHe stated his view of the effect of this policy, and in clear and\r\nforcible words urged Congress to suspend the purchase of silver\r\nbullion and the coinage of silver dollars until they should be\r\nrequired by the business of the country.  This is the same question\r\nnow pending, but under circumstances of greater urgency.\r\n\r\nThe President enlarged fully upon this vital subject and has adhered\r\nto his opinions tenaciously.  He was re-elected with full knowledge\r\nof these opinions and now, no doubt, will soon again press them\r\nupon Congress.  The efforts made to carry into effect the policy\r\nof the President will be more fully stated hereafter.  He closed\r\nhis message by calling attention to the law relating to the succession\r\nto the presidency in the event of the death, disability or removal\r\nof both the President and Vice President, and his recommendation\r\nhas been carried into effect by law.  In conclusion he said:\r\n\r\n\"I commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of Congress\r\nthe needs, the welfare, and the aspirations of an intelligent and\r\ngenerous nation.  To subordinate these to the narrow advantages of\r\npartisanship, or the accomplishment of selfish aims, is to violate\r\nthe people's trust and betray the people's interests.  But an\r\nindividual sense of responsibility on the part of each of us, and\r\na stern determination to perform our duty well, must give us place\r\namong those who have added, in their day and generation, to the\r\nglory and prosperity of our beloved land.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, David Manning, in his report to\r\nCongress, amplified the statement made of the receipts and expenditures\r\nof the government and gave estimates for the then current and the\r\nnext fiscal year.  He was much more explicit than the President in\r\nhis statement of reform in taxation.  He expressed more at length\r\nthan the President the objections to the further coinage of the\r\nsilver dollars.  He stated the superior convenience of paper money\r\nto coins of either gold or silver, but that it should be understood\r\nthat a sufficient quantity of actual coin should be honestly and\r\nsafely stored in the treasury to pay the paper when presented.  He\r\nentered into an extended and interesting history of the two metals\r\nas coined in this country and the necessity of a monetary unit as\r\nthe standard of value.  His history of the coinage of the United\r\nStates is as clear, explicit and accurate as any I have read.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, 1885, I received from Governor Hoadley an\r\nofficial letter notifying me, as president of the Senate, that a\r\nmarble statue of General Garfield had been placed in the hall of\r\nthe old House of Representatives, in pursuance of the law inviting\r\neach state to contribute statues of two of its eminent citizens,\r\nand saying:\r\n\r\n\"It is hoped that it may be found worthy of acceptance and approval\r\nas a fit contribution from this state to the United States, in\r\nwhose service President Garfield passed so much of his life and\r\nwhose chief executive officer he was at the time of his death.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1886, I submitted to the Senate, in connection\r\nwith Governor Hoadley's letter, concurrent resolutions returning\r\nthe thanks of Congress to the Governor, and through him to the\r\npeople of Ohio, for the statue, and accepting it in the name of\r\nthe nation.  In presenting these resolutions I expressed at\r\nconsiderable length the estimate of the people of Ohio of the\r\ncharacter and public services of Garfield, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The people of Ohio, among whom he was born and bred, placed his\r\nimage in enduring marble in the silent senate of the dead, among\r\nthe worthies of every period of American history, not claiming for\r\nhim to have been the greatest of all, but only as one of their\r\nfellow-citizens, whom, when living, they greatly loved and trusted,\r\nwhose life was spent in the service of his whole country at the\r\nperiod of its greatest peril, and who, in the highest places of\r\ntrust and power, did his full duty as a soldier, a patriot, and a\r\nstatesman.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were then adopted.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Ohio that convened on the 3rd of January, 1886,\r\nwas required to elect a Senator, as my successor, to serve for six\r\nyears following the expiration of my term on the 4th of March,\r\n1887.  The Republican members of the legislature held an open joint\r\ncaucus on the 7th of January, and nominated me for re-election, to\r\nbe voted for at the joint convention of the two houses on the\r\nfollowing Tuesday.  The vote in the caucus was unanimous, there\r\nbeing no other name suggested.  The legislature was required to\r\nmeet an unexampled fraud at the recent election, practiced in\r\nHamilton county, where, four Republican senators and eleven Republican\r\nmembers had been chosen.  A lawless and desperate band of men got\r\npossession of the ballot boxes in two or three wards of the city\r\nof Cincinnati, broke open the boxes and changed the ballots and\r\nreturns so as to reverse the result of the election of members of\r\nthe legislature.  These facts were ascertained by the finding and\r\njudgment of the circuit and supreme courts, but the supreme court\r\nheld that the power to eliminate such frauds and forgeries did not\r\nreside in the courts but only in the senate and house of representatives\r\nof the state, respectively.  Each house was the judge of the election\r\nof its members.  This palpable and conceded fraud had to be acted\r\nupon promptly.  The house of representatives, upon convening,\r\nappointed a committee to examine the returns, and on the fifth day\r\nof the session reported that the returns were permeated with fraud\r\nand forgeries, and that the persons elected and named by the\r\ncommittee were entitled to seats instead of those who held the\r\nfraudulent certificates of election.  Without these changes the\r\nRepublican majority was three on joint ballot.  The report was\r\nadopted after a full and ample hearing, and the Republican members\r\nwere seated.\r\n\r\nIn the senate a committee was also appointed and came to the same\r\nconclusion.  The senators holding the fraudulent certificates\r\nclaimed the right to vote on their own cases, which was denied by\r\nLieutenant Governor Kennedy, the presiding officer, and the Republican\r\nsenators were awarded their seats, but this did not occur until\r\nsome months after the election of United States Senator, which took\r\nplace on the 13th of January, when I was duly elected, receiving\r\nin the senate 17 votes and Thurman 20, and in the house 67 votes\r\nand Thurman 42, making a majority of 22 for me on joint ballot.\r\n\r\nI was notified at Washington of my election and was invited to\r\nvisit the legislature, members of the senate and house of both\r\nparties concurring.  It so happened that at this time I had accepted\r\nan invitation from President Cleveland to attend a diplomatic dinner\r\nat the White House.  I called upon him to withdraw my acceptance,\r\nand, on explaining the cause, he congratulated me on my election.\r\n\r\nThe reception by the two houses was arranged to be at 4 o'clock p.\r\nm. on the day after the election.  I arrived in Columbus at 3:30,\r\nand, accompanied by Governor Foraker and a committee of the two\r\nhouses, proceeded immediately to the hall of the House, where the\r\nlegislature and a great company had assembled.  I was introduced\r\nby Lieutenant Governor Kennedy.  George G. Washburn delivered an\r\neloquent address of welcome in behalf of the legislature, closing\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your return to the Senate in 1881 was only additional evidence of\r\nour continued confidence and esteem, and on this, the occasion of\r\nyour fifth election to that honored position, I tender to you the\r\nhearty congratulations of the general assembly and of the citizens\r\nof this great commonwealth.  Conscious that you have rendered far\r\ngreater service to the people of your native state than it will be\r\npossible for them to repay by any honors they can confer upon you,\r\nI again bid you a most cordial welcome and invoke the continued\r\nguidance and protection of the same Almighty Being who has led you\r\nthus far to well merit the exalted title of 'good and faithful\r\nservant.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter the applause which followed Mr. Washburn's address had\r\nsubsided, I responded in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My first duty on this occasion, after the magnificent reception\r\nyou have given me, it to express to you my profound sense of the\r\nhigh honor you have conferred upon me.  I have often, in a somewhat\r\nbusy life, felt how feeble are words to express the feelings of\r\nthe heart.  When all has been said that one can say, there is still\r\nsomething wanting to convey an adequate expression of gratitude\r\nand obligation.  This I feel now more than ever before, when you\r\nhave selected me for the fifth time to serve as a Member of the\r\nSenate of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Such trust and confidence reposed in me by the people of Ohio,\r\nthrough their chosen representatives, imposes upon me an obligation\r\nof duty and honor, more sacred than any words or promises can\r\ncreate.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen, for the future term of service to which you\r\nhave elected me, I can only, with increased experience, do what I\r\nhave done in the past, and, with every motive that can influence\r\nany man, seek to preserve the favor and confidence of a people as\r\nintelligent as any on the face of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"As many of you know, I did not seek re-election to the Senate.\r\nI sincerely felt that there were many citizens of the State of Ohio\r\nof my political faith who might rightfully aspire to the dignity\r\nof the office of Senator of the United States.  I was very willing\r\nto give way to any of them, but you have thought it best to continue\r\nme in this position.  It comes to me without solicitation or\r\nintrigue, or any influence that is not honorable to you and to me.\r\nI trust it will not prove injurious to any portion of the people\r\nof the State of Ohio, whether they agree with me in political\r\nopinions or not.\r\n\r\n\"I accept the office as a trust to be performed under the active\r\nvigilance of political adversaries and the partial scrutiny of\r\nfriends, but with the sole object of promoting the honor and\r\nprosperity of the United States.  I can have no motive of selfishness\r\nor ambition to turn me from a faithful performance of every duty\r\nattached to the office.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, gentlemen, that, without recalling that I am elected\r\nby a party, I will go back to Washington with the earnest desire\r\nto perform the duties that you have assigned me, with the hope to\r\ncontribute, to the best of my abilities, not merely to the success\r\nof my party, but to the good of the whole country.\r\n\r\n\"To me the national government in our system is the _father_, the\r\nprotector of our national honor, our defender against enemies at\r\nhome and abroad, while the state is the _good mother_ who guards\r\nsacredly the home, the family and the domestic interests of life,\r\nto be beloved by every good citizen of the state, the fountain and\r\nsource of the greatest blessings of domestic life.  Ohio can justly\r\nclaim to be the equal of any other in the sisterhood of states,\r\ncentral in location, rich in resources, the common pathway of all\r\nthe states, containing over three millions of people as happy in\r\ntheir surroundings as those of any community in the world.  We must\r\ndo our part to advance and improve our condition by wise legislation\r\nand by the moral influences of education and religion.  In this\r\nway only can Ohio sustain her high and honorable standing as a part\r\nof a great country, eloquently and truly described by Canon Farrar\r\nas 'in numbers the greatest, in strength the most overwhelming, in\r\nwealth the most affluent, of all the great nations of the world.'\"\r\n\r\nMy speech was well received by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a general reception of ladies and gentlemen was held\r\nin the senate chamber, when hand shaking and social congratulations\r\noccurred, participated in by citizens of Columbus and other places.\r\nThe next day I returned to Washington.\r\n\r\nI observed closely the course pursued by the press of the country\r\nin respect to my election.  As a rule it was received with favor\r\nby papers of both parties.  The election of a Senator of the United\r\nStates by such frauds as had been practiced by Democrats in Cincinnati\r\nwould be a bad example that might be followed by other crimes,\r\nviolence or civil war.  The weakness in our system of government\r\nis likely to be developed by a disputed election.  We touched the\r\nline of danger in the contest between Hayes and Tilden.  Some guards\r\nagainst fraud at elections have been adopted, notably the Australian\r\nballot, but the best security is to impress succeeding generations\r\nwith the vital importance of honest elections, and to punish with\r\nrelentless severity all violations of election laws.\r\n\r\nDuring this Congress, by reason of my position as presiding officer,\r\nI participated only occasionally in the current debate, introduced\r\nonly private bills, and had charge of no important measure.\r\n\r\nMr. Eustis, on the 8th of February, introduced a resolution\r\ninstructing the committee on finance to inquire whether it had been\r\nthe custom for the assistant treasurer at New Orleans to receive\r\ndeposits of silver dollars and at a future period issue silver\r\ncertificates therefor.  This led to a long and rambling debate, in\r\nwhich I took part.  I stated my efforts, as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and those of my successors in that office, to put the\r\nsilver dollars in circulation; that they were sent to the different\r\nsub-treasuries to be used in payment of current liabilities, but\r\nsilver certificates were exchanged for them when demanded.  Also,\r\nwhen gold coin or bullion came into the United States in the course\r\nof trade, and was inconvenient to transport or to use in large\r\npayments for cotton or other products, the treasurer of the United\r\nStates, or his assistants in all parts of the country, issued silver\r\ncertificates in exchange for gold, that in this way the coin reserve\r\nin the treasury was maintained and increased without cost, that\r\nduring one season $80,000,000 gold was in this way acquired by the\r\ntreasury.  I could have said later on, that, until within three\r\nyears, when the receipts of the government were insufficient to\r\npay its current expenditures, there was no difficulty in securing\r\ngold and silver coin in exchange for United States notes, treasury\r\nnotes and silver certificates.  The greater convenience of paper\r\nmoney in large commercial transactions created a demand for it,\r\nand gold and silver were easily obtained at par for all forms of\r\npaper money issued by the government.  The exchange was temporarily\r\ndiscontinued by Secretary McCulloch.  It is a proper mode of\r\nfortifying the gold reserve and ought to be continued, but cannot\r\nbe when expenditures exceed the revenue, or when there is the\r\nslightest fear that the treasury will not be able to pay its notes\r\nin coin.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March John F. Miller, a Senator from California,\r\ndied, and funeral services were conducted in the Senate on the\r\n13th, when I announced that:\r\n\r\n\"By order of the Senate, the usual business will be suspended this\r\nday, to enable the Senate to participate in the funeral ceremonies\r\ndeemed appropriate on the death of John F. Miller, late an honored\r\nMember of this body from the State of California.\"\r\n\r\nThe services were conducted in the Senate Chamber by Rev. William\r\nA. Leonard, rector of St. John's church, the chaplain of the Senate,\r\nDr. Huntley, pronouncing the benediction, after which the following\r\nstatement was made by me, as president of the Senate:\r\n\r\n\"The funeral ceremonies deemed appropriate to this occasion in the\r\nSenate Chamber are now terminated.  We consign all that is mortal\r\nof our brother to the custody of an officer of the Senate and a\r\ncommittee of its Members, to be conveyed to his home on the Pacific,\r\nand there committed for burial to those who have honored him and\r\nloved him so much when living.  The Senate, as a body, will now\r\nattend the remains to the station.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Miller was highly esteemed by his associates in the Senate.\r\nHe was born in Indiana a few miles from Cincinnati, Ohio.  After\r\ngraduating as a lawyer he went to California, in 1853, but returned\r\nto his native state, and at the outbreak of the war entered the\r\nUnion army with the rank of colonel.  That he was a gallant soldier\r\nis shown by the fact that on his return to Indiana, at the close\r\nof the war, Governor Morton presented him a sword which he had\r\npromised the soldier of the state who had distinguished himself\r\nmost and reflected the greatest credit on his state and country.\r\nAt the close of the war he returned to California, and, after a\r\nfew years, was elected, by a Republican legislature, to the United\r\nStates Senate.  He was not a frequent or lengthy speaker, but was\r\na man of thought, of attention, of industry and practical sagacity,\r\nand brought to every question patient and persistent energy and\r\nintelligence.  In his manner he was quiet, dignified and courteous.\r\nFor years he suffered greatly from wounds received in the war,\r\nwhich no doubt shortened his life.  He held the position of chairman\r\nof the committee on foreign relations, to which I succeeded him.\r\n\r\nDuring April and May interstate commerce was the subject of an\r\nextended debate in which I participated.  Amendments to the bill\r\npassed two years previously, involving \"the long haul and the short\r\nhaul\" and whether Congress should attempt to legislate as to\r\ntransportation within a single state, were debated, and no problems\r\nof legislation have been more difficult.  The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission organized under these laws was invested with extraordinary\r\npowers and its action has been beneficial to the public, but in\r\nmany cases has seriously crippled many railroad corporations, and\r\nbankrupted some of them.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of this session I was called upon to perform\r\na very disagreeable duty.  The election of my colleague, Mr. Payne,\r\nas a Member of the Senate, after an active contest with Mr. Pendleton,\r\ngave rise to charges of corruption, not against him personally,\r\nbut against those who had charge of his canvass in the legislature.\r\nThe succeeding legislature of Ohio was Republican and undertook to\r\nexamine these charges by a committee of its house of representatives.\r\nThe charges made and the testimony taken were sent by the house to\r\nthe Senate of the United States, with a resolution requesting\r\nfurther examination and that the election be vacated.  The papers\r\nwere referred to the committee on privileges and elections, the\r\nmajority of whom reported that the charges were not proven, and\r\nasked that the committee be discharged from further consideration\r\nof the matter.  The minority of the committee reported in favor of\r\nthe inquiry proposed.  I felt it to be my duty to the people of\r\nOhio to insist upon an investigation, but in no spirit of unkindness\r\nto my colleague.  It was the first and only time I had occasion to\r\nbring before the Senate the politics of Ohio.  My relations with\r\nMr. Payne were friendly.  I knew him, and respected him as a\r\nprominent citizen of Cleveland and regarded well by his neighbors.\r\nI believed that whatever corruption occurred at his election he\r\nhad no personal knowledge of it, and that his honor would not be\r\ntouched by the testimony to be produced.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July I made a long speech upon the report of the\r\ncommittee, reviewing the evidence presented by the Ohio legislature\r\nand insisting that it was ample to justify and require a full and\r\nthorough examination by the committee.  I disclaimed any desire to\r\nreflect upon the motives, or the honor, or the conduct, or the\r\nopinions, of the Senators who differed with me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I believe from my own knowledge of the history of events in Ohio,\r\nas well as from the papers sent to us, that there is a profound\r\nconviction in the minds of the body of the people of Ohio of all\r\npolitical parties that in the election of my colleague there was\r\ngross corruption, by the use of large sums of money to corrupt and\r\npurchase the votes of members of the general assembly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that is a fact.  Whether sufficient evidence has been produced\r\nbefore you to justify this belief is for you to say.  Whether\r\nsufficient has been said here to put you upon an inquiry, the fact\r\nremains that the people of Ohio believe, that in the election of\r\nmy colleague, there was the corrupt use of money sufficient to\r\nchange the result.\"\r\n\r\nI then entered upon the details of the charges and testimony\r\nsubmitted to the committee, and concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is not sufficient for us to state that the case made by this\r\nprinted testimony is not strong enough to convict.  It is a question\r\nwhether it is sufficient to excite a suspicion, because upon a\r\nsuspicion a Senator's seat and his right to hold a seat here may\r\nbe inquired into.  Therefore, with due deference to the distinguished\r\nand eminent gentlemen who treat this case as if we were now passing\r\nupon the guilt or innocence of an accused with the view of a lawyer\r\nand the strictness of a lawyer, it seems to me they have confounded\r\nthe stage of this inquiry.  It is now an inquiry only in the hands\r\nof a committee of our body to advise whether or not, in these papers\r\nor in any that can be produced, there is cause for investigation,\r\nor whether there is reasonable and probable cause that can be\r\nproduced.  If so, then the inquiry goes on.  The final judgement,\r\nhowever, is only arrived at when we shall have completed testimony\r\nof a legal character, when, with grave and deliberate justice, and\r\nwith the kindness that we always give to our colleagues here, we\r\nproceed to render our judgment.\r\n\r\n\"I have said more than I intended to say when I rose.  I will now\r\nadd, in conclusion, that I consider that I perform a duty to my\r\nstate, and especially to the party that I represent here, and all\r\nwe can say to you is that we have believed and do now believe,\r\nmainly upon the statements made by Democratic editors and Democratic\r\ncitizens, for they know more about it than we do, that upon the\r\nbelief generally held in the State of Ohio that fraud and corruption\r\ndid supervene in this election we ask you to make such inquiries\r\nas will satisfy your conscience whether that charge is true or\r\nfalse.  If it is true, you alone are the judges of it.  If it is\r\nfalse, then you should punish the men who started these charges\r\nand you should vindicate the men who have been unjustly arraigned.\r\n\r\n\"In any view I can take of it, I believe it is the duty of the\r\nSenate of the United States, as it regards its own honor and the\r\nfuture of our country, never the leave this matter in its present\r\ncondition, to be believed by some and disbelieved by others, to be\r\nmade the subject of party contest and party chicanery, but let us\r\nhave a fair, judicial, full investigation into the merits of these\r\naccusations.  If they are false, stamp them with the brand of\r\nignominy; if they are true, deal with the facts proven as you think\r\nis just and right.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the report attracted much attention and was\r\nparticipated in by many Senators.  The motion of the majority of\r\nthe committee was adopted by the vote of 44 yeas and 17 nays.  The\r\nSenate thus denied that the case made by the legislature of Ohio\r\ndid justify an inquiry into the election of Senator Payne.  He\r\nfilled out the measure of his term and still lives at his home in\r\nCleveland, honored and respected, at the age of eighty-five.\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned August 5, 1886.\r\n\r\nI had been invited to deliver an address, upon the celebration of\r\nthe sixty-fourth anniversary of the birth of General U. S. Grant,\r\nat the Metropolitan church in Washington on the 27th of April,\r\n1886.  The text given me was \"Grant and the New South.\"  As this\r\nbrief speech expressed my appreciation of the character of General\r\nGrant soon after his death, and my presage of the new south, I\r\ninsert it here:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen:--Our friends have given me a very great\r\ntheme and very little time in which to present it to you.  The new\r\nsouth is one of the mysteries which time only can unfold.  It is\r\nto us, and, I fear, will be for generations to come, one of those\r\nproblems which tax the highest abilities of statesmen.  It is like\r\nthe Irish question to England and the Eastern question to Europe.\r\nWe can only judge of the future by the past.  I can base my hope\r\nfor the new south only upon the probable results of the changed\r\nconditions grafted upon the old south by the war; more a matter of\r\nhope and expectation than as yet of realization.  Still we may hope\r\nvery much even from the present signs of the times and upon what\r\nthe south ought to be if not upon what it is.\r\n\r\n\"We know what the old south was.  It was an oligarchy called a\r\ndemocracy.  I do not speak this word in an offensive sense, but\r\nsimply as descriptive of the character of the government of the\r\nsouth before the war.  One-third of the people of the south were\r\nslaves.  More than another third were deprived, by the nature of\r\nthe institutions among which they lived, of many of the advantages\r\nabsolutely indispensable to the highest civilization.  Less than\r\none-fourth of the population were admirably trained, disciplined\r\nand qualified for the highest duties of mankind.  The south was\r\nvery much such a democracy as Rome and Greece were at some periods\r\nof their history; a democracy founded upon the privileges of the\r\nfew and the exclusion of the many.  Very much like the democracy\r\nof the barons of Runnymede, who, when they met together to dictate\r\nMagna Charta to King John, guarded fully their own privileges as\r\nagainst the king, but cared but little for the rights of the people.\r\nAnd so with the south--the old south.  But it was an able oligarchy.\r\n\r\n\"Among the brightest names in the American diadem were many men of\r\nthe south--at the head of whom, and at the head of all mankind,\r\nwas the name of Washington.  And so, in all our history, the south,\r\nmisnamed a democracy, did furnish to the United States many of\r\ntheir leading lights, and the highest saints in our calendar.  They\r\nwere able men.  All who came in contact with them felt their power\r\nand their influence.  Trained, selected for leading pursuits, they\r\nexercised a controlling influence in our politics.  They held their\r\nslaves in subjection and the middle classes in ignorance, but\r\nextended their power and influence, so as to control, in the main,\r\nthe policy of this country, at home and abroad.  They disciplined\r\nour forces, led our parties, and made our law.\r\n\r\n\"General Grant, in the popular mind, represents the impersonation\r\nof the forces that broke the old south.  Not that thousands of men\r\ndid not do as much as he within the limits of their opportunities.\r\nNot that every soldier who followed his flag did not perform his\r\nduty in the same sense as General Grant.  But General Grant was\r\nthe head, the front, the selected leader; and therefore his name\r\nis the impersonation of that power in the war which broke the old\r\nsouth, and preserved our Union to your children, and I trust your\r\nchildren's children, to the remotest posterity.  But, while we\r\npraise Grant and the Union soldiers, we must remember that Abraham\r\nLincoln was the genius of the times.  He pointed out the way.  He\r\nforesaw the events that came.  He did not like war.  He hated war.\r\nHe loved the south as few men did.  He was born of the south--in\r\nhis early life reared in the south.  All his kin were in the south.\r\nHe belonged to that middle or humble class of men in the south who\r\nwere most seriously oppressed by all their surroundings--by the\r\nslavery of the south.  He hated slavery, if he hated anything, but\r\nI do not believe he hated the owners of slaves.  He loved all\r\nmankind.  No man better than he could have uttered those words:\r\n'Malice towards none, charity for all.'  That was Abraham Lincoln.\r\nHe was driven into the war reluctantly.  At first, he tried to\r\nprevent it, and would not see the necessity for it.  He ridiculed\r\nit, and believed that the time would speedily come when all the\r\nexcitement springing up in the south would pass away.\r\n\r\n\"But the inevitable and irrepressible conflict was upon him, and\r\nhe met the responsibility with courage and sagacity.  A higher\r\npower than Abraham Lincoln, a power that rules and governs the\r\nuniverse of men, decreed the war as a necessary and unavoidable\r\nevent, to prepare the way for a new south and a new north, and a\r\nmore perfect Union.  The war did come as a scourge and a resurrection.\r\nGrant was the commander of the Union armies, and at the close of\r\nthe war more than what we had hoped for at the beginning was\r\naccomplished.  When the war commenced no man among those in public\r\nlife contemplated or expected the speedy abolition of slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia, and in the United States of America.  I\r\ncan say that, the winter before the war commenced, no man in public\r\nlife in Washington expected the untold benefits and good that have\r\ncome to mankind as the result of the war, by the Act of Emancipation\r\n--unforeseen then, but thankfully appreciated now, by the whole\r\nAmerican people; even by the masters of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Now fellow-citizens, the new south is founded upon the ruins of\r\nthe old.  It inherits the prejudices, the institutions and some of\r\nthe habits of the old south.  No wise man will overlook this, and\r\nshould not expect that the southern people will at once yield to\r\nthe logic of events; but every patriotic man ought to do his utmost\r\nto bring about, as soon as possible, a cheerful acquiescence in\r\nthe results of the war.  You cannot in a single generation, much\r\nless a single decade, change the ideas of centuries.  And, therefore,\r\nwe must not be impatient with the new south.  And we who come from\r\nthe north must not expect them at once to lay aside all ideas with\r\nwhich they were born and which they inherited from their ancestors\r\nfor generations.  Therefore, it was to be expected that the south\r\nwould be somewhat disturbed, and would be somewhat slow in their\r\nmovements; that it must be born again and live an infancy and take\r\nits ordinary course in human life.  It must grow as Topsy grew.\r\nRemember, at that time, before the war, this country was a confederacy,\r\nnot of states, but a confederacy of sections.  There were but two\r\nparties to that confederacy, one was the north and the other was\r\nthe south.  On every question, great and small, that division in\r\nAmerican life and American politics arose.  Before the war and\r\nduring the war party lines were drawn on the sectional line, north\r\nand south.  The parties in this country were sectional parties,\r\nand even up to this time we have not broken down the asperity which\r\nexisted, growing out of this sectional condition of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Now that slavery is gone, parties ought to be based on other\r\nconditions than sectional lines.  There is no question now existing\r\nbetween the north and the south, and politicians will soon find\r\nthat they must base their divisions of party lines upon some other\r\nquestion than between the north and the south.  I see growing up\r\nevery day the evidence of that feeling that this sectional controversy\r\nis at an end.  Although the ghost is not buried--the dead body lies\r\nmouldering in the grave.\r\n\r\n\"What then, is the first duty of both sections, now that slavery\r\nis abolished.  It is to base party divisions upon other than\r\nsectional lines.  It is to adopt a policy approved by the patriotic\r\nmen of both sections, that will develop the resources, improve the\r\nconditions, and advance the interests of the whole people.  The\r\nnorth is ready for this consummation.  There never was a time in\r\nthe history of this government, from the time the constitution was\r\nframed to this hour, when there was less party spirit among the\r\nmass of the people of the United States.  Nearly all that is left\r\nis among mere politicians.  The people of the United States desire\r\nto see these differences buried, and new questions, living questions\r\nof the present and future, form the line of demarkation between\r\nparties.  The north has made enormous growth and development since\r\nthe war.  Immense capital is seeking investment, and millions of\r\nidle men are seeking employment.  The south, from a state of chaos,\r\nis showing marked evidence of growth and progress, and these two\r\nsections, no longer divided by slavery, can be united again by the\r\nsame bonds that united our fathers of the revolution.\r\n\r\n\"Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me state briefly the conditions\r\nupon which the new south can secure the greatest amount of good\r\nfor its people--conditions that can be accepted by men who served\r\nin either army (who wore the blue or the gray), both Confederate\r\nand Union soldiers.  If these elemental conditions are accepted\r\nfairly, as I hope they will be by the south, the union will be\r\ncomplete without either north or south or sectional or party lines.\r\n\r\n\"First, there must be recognized in every part of this country,\r\nwithout respect to race or color or condition, the equality of\r\nrights and privileges between man and man.  This fundamental\r\nprinciple is now ingrafted upon our constitution.  It can never be\r\nerased.  There it stands; and although, from time to time, parties\r\nand men may refuse to observe the spirit of that great provision\r\nin the constitution, there it will stand, and in time--and I trust\r\na not far distant time--it will be recognized by every man and\r\nwoman and child in this broad land, white or black, north or south.\r\nIt is not safe for it to be otherwise.  A right plainly given by\r\nthe constitution and the laws, withheld or denied, is an uneasy\r\ngrievance which will never rest.  And, therefore, the time is not\r\nfar distant, when those now strongly actuated by the prejudices\r\nand feelings of race will recognize this important doctrine.  They\r\nwill feel that it is for their own safety and for their own good.\r\nBlacks and whites are spread all over the south.  They cannot be\r\nseparated without the fiat of the Almighty, and such a fiat has\r\nnever been issued except once, when the Israelites marched out from\r\nslavery in Egypt, and it took them about forty years to travel a\r\nshort way.\r\n\r\n\"One-third of the population of the south is of the negro race,\r\nand two-thirds of the white race.  Whatever may have been thought\r\nof the wisdom of the policy of emancipation, it was the logical\r\nresult of the war, has been finally adopted, and will never be\r\nchanged.  It is idle to discuss schemes to separate these races\r\nexcept by voluntary and individual movement, but they will live\r\nand increase, generation after generation, the common occupants of\r\nthe new south.  What is needed above all else is to secure the\r\nharmonious living and working of these two elements, to secure to\r\nboth the peaceful enjoyment of their rights and privileges.  As long\r\nas any portion or race or class of the people of the new south are\r\ndeprived of the rights which the constitution and law confer upon\r\nthem, there will be unrest and danger.  All history teaches us that\r\nthose who suffer a wrong will sooner or later find means to correct\r\nand avenge it.\r\n\r\n\"There is another condition that the new south must find out.  The\r\nhonorable gentleman who preceded me (Senator Brown) has found it\r\nout already.  The system of production which was admirably adapted\r\nto the old south will not answer for the new south.  Under the old\r\ninstitution of slavery they raised a few leading crops, cotton,\r\nrice, sugar and tobacco--but not much else.  Why?  Because these\r\narticles could be raised by the labor of slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in the new south, it is manifest that the chief sources of\r\nwealth and prosperity lie in the development of their natural\r\nresources, in the production of coal and iron and other minerals\r\nand phosphates, and in the manufacture of cotton and other textile\r\nfabrics, and in the development of railroads and other means of\r\ncommunication.  In other words, they will find it to their interest\r\nto adopt and compete with the north in all its industries and\r\nemployments.  That this can be successfully done is shown in Alabama,\r\nGeorgia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia.  All the states\r\ntouching on the Alleghany range have facilities for varied manufactures\r\nfully equal to any of the northern states, and with some advantages\r\nas to climate and labor.  A diversity of production will be wealth\r\nto the south, break down its exclusion, open its doors to immigration,\r\nand assimilate its institutions with those of the north.\r\n\r\n\"The north is ready for this competition.  Although the south will\r\nprobably deprive us of some of the markets we now have, yet no man\r\nin the north will complain; but, on the contrary, we have in the\r\nnorth millions of dollars in capital to invest, and millions of\r\nhardy men to work north or south, wherever they can get fair wages\r\nfor a fair day's work.  When this competition comes we will have\r\na diversity of industry, and a country rich in developed as well\r\nas in undeveloped resources.  This is the second great want of the\r\nnew south which I trust their able men may bring about; and Governor\r\nBrown is one of their leaders, and has seen that this is the road\r\nnot only for the improvement of his section, but for the betterment\r\nof his fortune.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other thing I wish to say in regard to the south.\r\nThat is, that it must mainly work out its own salvation.  That is\r\none of the last things that we in the north have found out.  We\r\nhave striven in various ways to assist the south in managing their\r\nlocal affairs; and I must confess that although I participated in\r\nthat kind of business I am afraid it did not turn out very well.\r\nThe north cannot rule the south any more than England can rule\r\nIreland, or Europe can govern Greece and Turkey.  According to the\r\nprinciples of our government it is not possible for us to keep\r\nsoldiers enough down south to guard all their ballot boxes, and\r\nindeed we need a good many up north to guard our own sometimes.\r\nAt all events it is not consistent with the principles of our\r\ngovernment that we should undertake to rule in local affairs, and,\r\ntherefore, while we should give to those who are oppressed, in our\r\nown country as well as in others, every kindly aid which the\r\nconstitution and the law allow, yet, after all, the people of the\r\nsouth must work out their own salvation.\r\n\r\n\"I am inclined to think that the blacks, having the labor and the\r\nmuscle and industry on their side, will not be far behind the white\r\nrace in the future in the south.  It is now conceded on all hands\r\nthat, under our system of government, we cannot by external force\r\nmanage or interfere with the local affairs of a state or community,\r\nunless the authorities of the state call for aid to resist domestic\r\nviolence.  Wrongs inflicted upon citizens by mobs are beyond redress\r\nby the general government.  The only remedy is migration and public\r\nopinion; but these, though slow and very discouraging, will in time\r\nfurnish a remedy and also a punishment.  Neither capital nor labor,\r\nprosperity nor hope, will go or linger long where human rights and\r\nlife are unsafe.  The instinctive love of justice and fair play\r\nwill, in time, dissipate the prejudice of race or caste and point\r\nthe finger of scorn to the man who robs another of his rights, as\r\nit now does to the man who cheats, or steals the property of his\r\nneighbor.  With the power of the colored people to migrate, whenever\r\nthey are unjustly treated, to a place where law and justice prevail,\r\nwith the capacity for labor and to acquire property, with reasonable\r\nopportunity for education, they will in time make sure their rights\r\nas citizens.  I believe this is the growing feeling in the new\r\nsouth.  I am willing to trust it, and I will be glad to aid it\r\nwhenever and wherever I can see the way.\r\n\r\n\"What the new south wants now more than all else is education!\r\neducation!! education!!!  The statistics with which we have been\r\nmade familiar recently in the debate in the Senate, of illiteracy\r\nin the south, are appalling, but not much more so than was the\r\ncondition of the western states fifty years ago.  The negroes being\r\nslaves were, of necessity, without education.  The great mass of\r\nthe white people were in the same condition, not because it was\r\ndesired in the south, but because, from the sparseness of the\r\npopulation and the existence of plantations instead of farms, it\r\nwas difficult to establish a system of public schools.  A change\r\nin this respect cannot be brought about suddenly, but it is apparent\r\nthat every southern state appreciates the importance of education\r\nof both white and black.  It is the bounden duty of the national\r\ngovernment to extend the aid of its large resources.  If the action\r\nof the Senate is sanctioned by the House, and fairly and justly\r\nexecuted by the people of the southern states, there need be no\r\ndanger from the ignorance of the next generation.  I believe that\r\nthese conditions will be the solution of the troubles of the south\r\nand make a great step on the road to prosperity and union in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n\"Now, but a few words in conclusion.  It is not merely common school\r\neducation in the south that is needed, but it is higher education.\r\nIt is all the learning of the schools, all that science has taught,\r\nall that religion teaches, all that medicine has found in its alchemy,\r\nall the justice which the law points out and seeks to administer;\r\nthe south wants opportunity for that higher education which cannot\r\nbe obtained from common schools, but which exists in no country\r\nexcept where common schools abound.  It wants in its midst the\r\nplaces where the active leading young men of the south can gather\r\nin colleges and universities and there gain that higher education\r\nwhich prepares them to be leaders among men.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you, my countrymen, here in Washington, that, under\r\nthe authority of the Methodist Episcopal church, a Christian\r\ndenomination, under the name of the illustrious hero General Grant,\r\nthere has been founded in the mountains of Tennessee, away up among\r\nthe clouds and in the pure air of Heaven, in the midst of a loyal\r\nand patriotic population, an institution of learning which will be\r\na blessing to all the people of the south, and I trust to all the\r\npeople of the north.  Every aid possible should be showered down\r\nfrom the north and south alike.  Let them light their fires at this\r\nmodern Athens upon the mountain top and they will shine forth all\r\nover our land.  Here the young men of the south will fit themselves\r\nto lead in the march of progress and improvement.  They will learn\r\nto vary their production, to develop their resources, to advance\r\nevery race and generation in education, intelligence and patriotism,\r\nand with charity broad enough to secure all the people, of every\r\nrace and tribe, the peaceful and unquestioned enjoyment of their\r\ncivil and political rights.  There is now no disturbing question\r\nof a sectional character which should prevent the north and south\r\nfrom moving in harmonious union.  The two streams have united, and\r\nthough for a time their waters may be divided by the color line,\r\nlike the Mississippi and the Missouri at and after their junction,\r\nyet, in the end they will mingle in a great republic, not of sections,\r\nbut of friendly states and a united people.\"\r\n\r\nI attended a meeting of the members of the Ohio Society of New\r\nYork, on the occasion of their first annual dinner at Delmonico's,\r\non the 7th of May.  It was a remarkable assemblage, composed almost\r\nexclusively of men born in Ohio, then living in New York, all of\r\nwhom had attained a good standing there, and many were prominent\r\nin official or business life.  There were over two hundred persons\r\npresent.  Thomas Ewing was president of the society, and Mr. Payne\r\nand myself sat on either side of him.  I insert the remarks of\r\nGeneral Ewing and myself as reported in the papers the next morning.\r\nMany speeches were made by others, including Senators Payne and\r\nHarrison.  General Ewing, after the dinner had received ample\r\nattention, called the company to order and made a brief address,\r\nwhich was repeatedly applauded.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"I hail and congratulate you, guests and members of the Ohio Society\r\nof New York, on our delightful and auspicious reunion.  It is good\r\nthat we are here.  This large assemblage of Ohio's sons, coming\r\nfrom far and near, attests how strong and vital are the ties that\r\nbind us to our mother state.  We have every reason to love and be\r\nproud of her.  If American citizenship be a patent of nobility, it\r\nadds to the honor to have been born of that state which, almost in\r\nthe forenoon of the first century of her existence, has shed such\r\nluster on the republic; which has given to it so long a roll of\r\nPresident, chief justices, judges of the Supreme Court and statesmen\r\nin the cabinet and in Congress--among whom is found not one dishonored\r\nname, but many that will shine illustrious in our country's annals\r\nforever; a state which, in the supreme struggle by which the Union\r\nwas established as indissoluble and the plague of human slavery\r\ndestroyed, gave to the republic even more than her enormous quota\r\nof noble troops, and with them those great captains of the war:\r\nGrant, Sherman, Rosecrans, McPherson.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, we have not formed our society from a desire to culture\r\nstate pride in any spirit of divided allegiance.  No, no!  There\r\nhas been far too much of that in the past, and can't be too little\r\nin the future.  We are first Americans--then Buckeyes.  The blessings\r\nand misfortunes of our sister states are ours as well as theirs.\r\nThe love of our own state and pride in her history spring largely\r\nfrom the fact that she and her institutions, in birth and growth,\r\nare purely American.  She is the oldest and, so far, the best\r\ndeveloped of all the typically American states.  Neither Roundhead\r\nnor Cavalier stood sponsor at her cradle.  She never wore the collar\r\nof colonial subserviency.  Her churches and colleges are not endowed\r\nof King Charles or Queen Anne.  Her lands are not held by grant or\r\nprescription under the Duke of York, Lord Fairfax or Lord Baltimore,\r\nbut by patents under the seal of the young republic and the hand\r\nof George Washington, whose name will continue to be loved and\r\nhonored throughout the world long after the memory of the last king\r\nand peer of Great Britain shall have sunk in oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"The early generation of her sons were not reared amid distinctions\r\nof wealth and rank and class, but in the primeval forest and prairie,\r\nwhere all stood equal and had no aid to eminence but strenuous\r\nefforts; where recollections of the sufferings and sacrifices of\r\nRevolutionary sires became inspirations of patriotism in their\r\nsons; and where nature threw around all her pure, loving and\r\nbenignant influences to make them strong and great.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I now have the pleasure to present to you a typical\r\nBuckeye--the architect of his own fame and fortune--who stands\r\nbelow only one man in the republic in official station, and below\r\nnone in the respect of his countrymen--John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nAs General Ewing closed, there was a tumultuous scene.  There were\r\nrepeated cheers, and Colonel W. L. Strong called for three cheers\r\nin my honor, which were given.  When I could be heard, I spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, Brethren All:--I give you my grateful thanks for\r\nthis greeting.  If you receive every Buckeye from Ohio in this\r\nmanner, you will have the hordes of Ararat here among you.  Such\r\na reception as this, I think, would bring every boy from every farm\r\nin the State of Ohio, and what would become of New York then?  You\r\nhave gathered the sons of Ohio, and those who have been identified\r\nwith its history, into a society where you may meet together and\r\npreserve and revive the recollections of Ohio boyhood and Ohio\r\nmanhood.  Why should you not do that?  Why should you not have an\r\nOhio society as well as a New England society, or any other kind\r\nof society?  Our friends and fellow-citizens from old England's\r\nshore, from Ireland and Scotland and Germany, form their societies\r\nof the city of New York; and why should not the State of Ohio, more\r\nimportant than any of these countries by this represented?\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, there is one characteristic of Ohio people which\r\nhas marked them from the beginning of their history, and marks them\r\nnow.  We are a migratory race.  We are the Innocents Abroad.  No\r\nArab in his tent, restless and uneasy, feels more uncertain and\r\nmovable than a man from Ohio, who can better his condition anywhere\r\nelse.  We are a migratory race, and why should we not be?  Do we\r\nnot deserve the best of every land?  When we go to any other country,\r\nwe don't go to rob them of anything, but to add to their wealth.\r\nIf I want to prove that Ohio people are migratory, what better\r\nevidence can I have than is afforded by the men who are here around\r\nme?  Here is my friend, General Ewing, born in one of the garden\r\nspots of Ohio, under circumstances when it would be supposed that\r\nhe ought to be content with his lot; but he goes walking off to\r\nKansas, and then to the war, and then into Washington, and finally\r\nsettles down near New York here, under the shadow of the Sage of\r\nGreystone!  Among others here around me I see a grandson of old\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison.  I see here innumerable representatives of\r\nthe Puritan fathers, with all the virtues of the old fathers and\r\nsome besides.  I see here representatives not only of Virginia and\r\nNew England, but of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania--all from\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen, in the early days Ohio was the camping ground of\r\nall the old states.  Ohio is the first fruit of the Federal Union.\r\nIt is true that Vermont and Kentucky and Tennessee were admitted\r\ninto the union of these states before Ohio was, but they were\r\noffshoots of New York and Virginia, while Ohio was the first fruit\r\nof that great commonwealth.  Every state of the old states had a\r\ncamping ground in the State of Ohio, either by reservation, by\r\npurchase or by settlement.  Nearly all of the early descendants of\r\nOhio were sons of Revolutionary fathers who came out to Ohio.  They\r\nwent there to redeem that land from a wilderness, and they made of\r\nOhio the most prosperous, the richest and fairest commonwealth the\r\nworld has ever known.  In Ohio was the beginning of that magnificent\r\nmarch of progress which adds luster to the history of the northwest,\r\nas an evidence of growth and progress unexampled in the previous\r\nhistory of mankind.  Think of it, my countrymen!  Within one hundred\r\nyears, more than 30,000,000 people have grown up in a country once\r\npeople alone by Indian tribes, and that 30,000,000 of people are\r\namong the most prosperous and powerful peoples of the whole world.\r\n\r\n\"I want to defend our Ohio people against another charge that is\r\nvery often made against them, especially in this city of New York.\r\nThey charge us with being fond of office.  Why, my countrymen, I\r\ncan show by statistics--and statistics never lie--that Ohio never\r\nhad her fair share of the public offices.  I have not brought any\r\nof the statistics with me, for fear some know-nothing might cry at\r\nour after-dinner speech 'Figures.'  Still we never had our share\r\nof the public offices, or if we had we always filled them well,\r\nand performed our duties honorably.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, only one or two other thoughts, and then I will\r\nleave you.  In the early times, migration was always to the westward.\r\nNobody thought of coming east.  Therefore it is that out of the\r\neight sons of Ohio who are now Members of the United States Senate,\r\nall moved westward; and out of some thirty or forty or fifty Members\r\nof the House of Representatives who were born in Ohio, and who\r\ndidn't stay in Ohio--and they are only a small part of them--all\r\nwent westward.  The reason was that 'Westward the star of empire\r\nwends its way.'  But latterly the star of empire seems to have\r\nsettled about this city of New York, until more than 200 Ohio men\r\ncan sit down to an Ohio feast in the city of New York.  There is\r\nanother reason--there is more money in New York than anywhere else\r\nin the country.  Not that our people have a fondness for money,\r\nbut they have come here to better their condition--and I hope in\r\nGod they will.  They not only better their own condition, but the\r\ncondition of all around them, and I can pick out from all over this\r\ncommunity, and from this little dinner party, men who came from\r\nOhio poor, but with an honest endeavor to do what was best for\r\nthemselves and their families, and here they are, rich and happy.\r\n\r\n\"One word more, worthy fellow-citizens.  We love Ohio.  We love\r\nOhio as our mother who nurtured us and fed us in our in our infancy;\r\nand, under any circumstances, although we may hear ill of Ohio, we\r\nnever fail to remember all that is good that can be said of Ohio,\r\nand to be true and honorable for the love of Ohio.  But we love\r\nour country more, and no man from Ohio would ever be true to his\r\nmother unless he were more true to his country all around, from\r\none end of the land to the other.  Our country forever from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific; from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canada\r\nline, and away around this continent in due time, when the pear\r\nwill ripen and fall in this Federal Union; in the whole round of\r\nthe country!\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you upon this happy meeting, upon this successful\r\nfeast, and I trust you may go on prospering and to prosper, until\r\nyou will gather all the men of Ohio who are deserving of their\r\nnativity into the fold of this social union, not only that you may\r\nmeet each other again as kinsmen born of the same soil, but that\r\nyou may aid and assist each other, as other kindred societies have\r\ndone, and I trust that the Ohio society, though the junior members\r\nat the table of these societies of New York, may yet be the foremost\r\nand leading members in charity and good works to the sons of Adam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nA PERIOD OF POLITICAL SPEECH MAKING.\r\nOrganization of the \"Sherman Club\" at Mansfield, Ohio--My Experiences\r\nwith Newspaper Reporters--Address at the State Fair in Columbus on\r\nAgricultural Implements--Other Speeches Made in the Campaign of\r\nthat Year--Address at Louisville, Ky.--Courteous Treatment by Henry\r\nWatterson, of the \"Courier Journal\"--Hon.

Logan--Tributes to His Memory--His Strong\r\nCharacteristics--My Reason for Resigning the Presidency of the\r\nSenate--Succeeded by John J. Ingalls.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of Congress I returned home.  I was not\r\nfatigued by the labors of the session, as the duties of presiding\r\nofficer were lighter than those of an active Member on the floor.\r\nThe usual canvass had already commenced for state officers and\r\nMembers of Congress.  A club called the \"Sherman club\" had been\r\norganized at Mansfield, and soon after my return having been invited\r\nto attend it, I did so, and made a brief political address.  During\r\nthis month I was visited by many interviewers, and while sometimes\r\ntheir calls were inopportune, yet I uniformly received them, answered\r\ntheir questions, and furnished them any information in my power.\r\nI knew that they were seeking information not for their own\r\nconvenience, but to gratify a public interest, and, therefore, I\r\nwas entirely willing to answer such questions as were put to me.\r\nThe case was very rare where I was misrepresented, and then it was\r\neither unintentional or to brighten a story or to exaggerate a\r\nfact.  I recall one interview in respect to courts of arbitration\r\nand the universal labor question.  My opinions were expressed\r\noffhand, and, although not taken down at the time by the interviewer,\r\nmy words uttered during a half hour's interview were quoted with\r\ngreat exactness.  I know this is not the common opinion in respect\r\nto the interviewer, and in some cases gross misrepresentations are\r\nmade, but in the very few instances where this has occurred in my\r\nexperience I have always carefully remembered the reporters who\r\nmade them and declined any further interview with them.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of August, Judge Thurman and I were invited to make\r\nbrief addresses at the state fair in Columbus.  After he had spoken\r\nwith his usual ability and directness, I made a speech mainly about\r\nnew devices in agricultural implements.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"From the fact that Judge Thurman and I have been invited to address\r\nyou I infer that you did not expect us to tell you what we knew\r\nabout farming.  He has been recognized as a standard authority as\r\nto the law--not only as to what it is but as to what it ought to\r\nbe--but I never heard that he was eminent as a farmer, either of\r\nthe theoretical sort who know how things ought to grow, or of the\r\npractical sort who know how to make them grow.  I have had more\r\nexperience as a farmer than he has had, but somehow my crops always\r\ncost me more than I could get for them.  If the many millions of\r\nfarmers in the United States have had my experience in farming they\r\nwould have to get more than seventy-five cents a bushel for wheat\r\nto make the two ends meet.  Still, Judge Thurman and I have learned\r\nenough to know that farming is the chosen employment of a large\r\nproportion of the human race, and is, besides, the chosen recreation\r\nof nearly all who have been successful in other pursuits.  Every\r\nlawyer especially, from Cicero to Webster, has delighted in the\r\nhealthful pleasure of rural pursuits--and if they have not made\r\ntheir money by farming they have spent their money in farming--and\r\nhave enriched the language of every age and clime with eloquent\r\nand beautiful tributes to this noblest occupation of man.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps this is the reason you call upon lawyers to speak on\r\noccasions like this, when the varied products of the farm, in their\r\nrich profusion and excellence, are spread before us.  Besides, it\r\nis the common opinion that lawyers can talk as well about things\r\nthey don't know as things they do know--and on either side of the\r\nquestion, without respect to the merits or morals of the topic.\r\nYour worthy secretary, in inviting me to speak for a few minutes\r\non this occasion, said that I was quite at liberty to choose the\r\nsubject of my remarks.  So I have chosen as a text a discovery I\r\nhave made very much like that of Benjamin Franklin, who advised\r\nthe people of Paris that he had made a great discovery--that being\r\nwakeful one morning he discovered that the sun rose at Paris at\r\nfive o'clock, and that if they would rise with the sun and go to\r\nbed with the sun they would save an enormous sum--millions of francs\r\n--in the cost of candles and lamps, and greatly improve their health\r\nand morals.  So I have discovered that our farmers have become\r\nmachinists, and, instead of working themselves, they make the\r\nhorses, mules, and especially the machines, do nearly all the work\r\nof the farm.\r\n\r\n\"I have observed in the numerous fairs I have attended since they\r\nwere first introduced in Ohio, and especially since the war, a\r\nmarked change in the articles exhibited.  Formerly the chief\r\nattraction was the varied exhibition of fruits, grain, cattle,\r\nhorses, sheep, hogs, poultry--all the productions of the farm--and\r\nthe chief benefit then derived from our state and county fairs was\r\nto excite competition in the size, excellence and abundance of\r\nthese purely animal or agricultural productions.  Formerly the\r\ntools and implements of husbandry were few, simple and plain, the\r\nchief of which were the plow, the scythe, the cradle, the sickle.\r\n\r\n\"Later by degrees there appeared new devices--new implements of\r\nhusbandry--the mower, the reaper, the thresher, the binder, the\r\nsulky plow, an infinite variety of mechanical contrivances to make\r\nthe labor of the farmer easier, or rather to dispense with a\r\nmultitude of laborers, and substitute in their places the horse,\r\nthe mule and the steam engine.  In other words, to convert the\r\nbusiness of farming from an agricultural pursuit, where the labor\r\nof men and women was the chief factor of production, to a mechanical\r\npursuit, in which the chief element of cost and power were machines,\r\nthe invention of a single generation.\r\n\r\n\"This striking change in an employment, which in all ages has been\r\npursued by a greater number of human beings than any other, is\r\nshown in every fair now held in the United States, and especially\r\nin this.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke of the changed condition of the farmer since Ohio was a\r\nnew state, covered by a great forest, when the home was a cabin,\r\nand about the only implements were the plow and the axe, and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"After what has been said by others, and especially so eloquently\r\nsaid by Judge Thurman, I need not express the high value I place\r\nupon the magnificent work of the state board of agriculture in\r\npreparing these grounds as a permanent place for the exhibition of\r\nthe industrial products of Ohio, not only of the farm but of the\r\nworkshop.  It is this day dedicated by appropriate ceremonies for\r\nthe use of the present and future generations of Buckeyes, and, I\r\nhope, as time rolls on, there may be here exhibited, not only stock\r\nand grains and vegetables, not only ingenious machinery and\r\ninventions, but men, high-minded men and noble women, and that with\r\nthe many advantages in education and culture secured to them by\r\ntheir ancestors they will maintain and advance with manly vigor\r\nand sturdy virtue the work of the generations before them, who have\r\nplanted and founded here in Ohio a model republic.\"\r\n\r\nI attended the thirteenth Industrial exposition at Music Hall,\r\nCincinnati, on the 2nd of September, where fully six thousand people\r\nwere gathered,  I entered the building with Governor Foraker, and\r\nwe were received with rounds of applause and made brief remarks,\r\nthe substance of which was reported, but I can only remember the\r\nmagnitude of the audience and the difficulty of being heard.  The\r\ncity was crowded with men, women and children, all in holiday dress,\r\nand everybody in good humor at the success of the exposition.\r\nDuring September, and until the day of the election, I was engaged\r\nin making speeches.  The one at Portsmouth, on the 28th of September,\r\nwas carefully prepared and reported, and contained the substance\r\nof what I said in that canvass.  It was a review of the political\r\nquestions of the day.  I always feel more at home in that part of\r\nOhio then in any other.  The river counties are associated with my\r\nearly recollections and the people are uniformly generous and kind.\r\nWith rare exceptions they have heartily supported me during my\r\nentire political life.\r\n\r\nI attended a meeting conducted by the Blaine club in Cincinnati.\r\nThe procession that marched through the streets was an immense one,\r\nand seemed to include all the men and boys in the city.  The\r\nclubhouse, brilliantly illuminated, was surrounded by a great crowd,\r\ntoo large to hear the speeches, nor did it matter, for their\r\nenthusiasm and cheers showed that they needed no exhortation.\r\n\r\nI attended a reception of the Sherman club of the 24th ward, at\r\nthe head of which was my old friend, Governor Thomas L. Young.  I\r\nthere made a strong appeal for the election of Benjamin Butterworth\r\nand Charles Brown to Congress, the former being one of the ablest\r\nand most promising men in congressional life, and the latter a\r\ngallant soldier, who had lost a leg in the service of his country.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"Their election is more important than anything else.  The election\r\nof a Republican House of Representatives is of vital importance,\r\nbecause if we can have not only a Republican Senate, but a Republican\r\nHouse of Representatives, we will tie up Cleveland and his\r\nadministration so that he and it can do no harm to anybody.  If we\r\ncan get a good Republican House of Representatives we will be able\r\nto maintain the system of protection of American labor, which is\r\nthe pride and glory of the Republican party.  We will maintain all\r\nthese great measures of Republican policy which tend to develop\r\nour country, to increase its happiness, diversify its pursuits,\r\nand build up its industries; to give you a good currency; to protect\r\nyour labor; and generally to promote the common good and welfare\r\nof our common country.\"\r\n\r\nAt the invitation of the Republicans of Louisville, Ky., I went to\r\nthat city.  In the afternoon I made a short address at the laying\r\nof the corner stone of the new customhouse, and in the evening made\r\na long political speech.  It was my first visit there, and I was\r\nmuch gratified as well as surprised, at the great numbers which\r\nattended a Republican meeting and the enthusiasm with which I was\r\ngreeted.  I referred to the long and intimate association of Ohio\r\nand Kentucky since the days of the Indian wars, when Kentucky sent\r\nher best and bravest men to fight the battles of Ohio, under Harrison\r\nand Taylor at Fort Meigs and Sandusky.  In a later time, when Henry\r\nClay was their favorite, Ohio steadily and heartily supported him,\r\nand now that the war was over, there was no reason why Kentucky\r\nand Ohio might not stand side by side in maintaining the principles\r\nof the Republican party.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"You might naturally inquire why I came to the city of Louisville\r\nto make a Republican speech, when I knew that the majority of your\r\npopulation belong to a different school of politics, and that I\r\ncould scarcely hope to make any impression upon the Democratic vote\r\nof the city of Louisville or the State of Kentucky.  Still, I have\r\nalways thought it strange that your people, who through many long\r\nyears followed the fortunes and believed in the doctrines of Henry\r\nClay, should willingly belong to a party opposed to all his ideas,\r\nand I was curious to learn why the same great events that led the\r\npeople of Ohio into the ranks of the Republican party should lead\r\nthe people of Kentucky into the ranks of the Democratic party.  It\r\nis to make this discovery that I come here to-night, and I will\r\nspeak to you, not for the purpose of reviving past controversies,\r\nbut to see whether, after all, the people of Ohio and Kentucky\r\nought not now to stand side by side in their political action, as\r\nthey did in the days of old.\r\n\r\n\"When approaching manhood I, in common with the people of Ohio,\r\nwas in ardent sympathy with the political opinions of the people\r\nof Kentucky.  I was reared in a school which regarded Henry Clay,\r\nJohn J. Crittenden, Thomas Ewing and Thomas Corwin as the brightest\r\nlights in the political firmament, chief of whom was Henry Clay.\r\nI need not remind a Kentucky audience with what pride and love your\r\npeople followed him in his great career, and with rare intermissions\r\nsupported and sustained him to the close of his life.  And so, too,\r\nwith John J. Crittenden, who represented the people of Kentucky in\r\nboth Houses of Congress, in the cabinet of two administrations,\r\nand, to the close of his eventful life in the midst of the Civil\r\nwar, retained the confidence and support of the people of Kentucky.\r\nIt may be said, also, that Thomas Ewing and Thomas Corwin, the warm\r\nand lifelong friends of Clay and Crittenden, represented the people\r\nof Ohio in the highest official positions, and that these great\r\nmen, united in counsel, in political opinions and in ardent\r\nfriendship, were the common standards of political faith to the\r\npeople of these neighboring states.\r\n\r\n\"I had the honor to cast my first vote for Henry Clay for President\r\nof the United States, and supported him with all the natural\r\nenthusiasm of youth, and remember yet my sorrow when it was at last\r\nknown that he was defeated.  I also knew Mr. Crittenden from 1846,\r\nwhen, as a young lawyer, I visited Washington, and saw much of him\r\nin the later years of his life.  I also held close personal relations\r\nwith Mr. Ewing and Mr. Corwin since my early boyhood, and shared,\r\nas much as youth can share, the benefits of their council and\r\nconfidence.  I am justified in saying that during the memorable\r\nperiod of thirty years of political conflict through which we have\r\npassed, I have steadily adhered to the lessons they have taught,\r\nby supporting the measures adopted from time to time by the Republican\r\nparty, while the majority of the people of Kentucky, with equal\r\nsincerity, no doubt, pursuing their convictions, have landed in\r\nthe Democratic party.  What I would like to find out is whether it\r\nis you or I who have switched off from the councils of our political\r\nfathers, and whether the causes of the difference of opinion still\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\nI closed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I freely confess that the great mass of the Democratic party are\r\npatriotic, law-abiding citizens, yet I believe the elements that\r\ncontrol that party, especially in the northern states, are unworthy\r\nof the confidence and trust of a brave and free people, and that\r\nthe Republican party, although it may not always have met the hopes\r\nand expectations of its friends, does contain within it the elements\r\nof order, safety, obedience to law and respect for the rights of\r\nothers, with well-grounded principles of public policy, and can\r\nfairly be trusted again to manage our national affairs.\r\n\r\n\"My heartiest sympathies go with the gallant Republicans of Kentucky,\r\nwho, in an unequal fight, have shown the courage of their race and\r\nthe patriotism of their ancestors.  Let them persevere in appealing\r\nto their neighbors for co-operation, and they can fairly hope that,\r\nas the passions of the war pass away, Kentucky will be, as of old,\r\non the side of the Union, the constitution and the impartial\r\nenforcement of the laws.\r\n\r\n\"Is not this a good time to try the experiment of a Republican\r\nrepresentative from the Louisville district?  Our Democratic friends\r\nseem to be in a bad way about the choice of a candidate.  If what\r\nthe opposing factions say of their candidates is half true, you\r\nhad better take shelter under a genuine and fearless Republican\r\nlike Mr. Wilson, who will be impartial to the factions and true to\r\nthe great interests of American labor and American production.\r\nSuch a light shining from Louisville will be a star of hope, a\r\nbeacon light of safety and prosperity to the extreme bounds of our\r\ncountry.  Why not try the experiment?  I hope that my visit among\r\nyou will be a message of good will, and I thank you with all my\r\nheart for your kindly reception.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Courier Journal\" was much more fair to me on this occasion\r\nthan the Democratic papers in Ohio.  In consequence of this I have\r\nalways entertained a kindly feeling for its editor, Henry Watterson,\r\nwho, notwithstanding his strong political opinions, is always bold,\r\nfrank and courteous in his criticisms.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Kentucky I spoke to a large meeting at Wilmington,\r\nOhio, on the 7th of October.  I had frequently addressed meetings\r\nat that place and always received a very cordial and hearty welcome.\r\nIt so happened that John Q. Smith, one of the leading citizens of\r\nClinton county, who had been a Member of Congress, had changed his\r\npolitical relations and become a warm supporter of the administration\r\nof Cleveland.  He had prepared a large number of questions, to be\r\nput to me, which were printed and scattered broadcast in handbill\r\nform.  I was glad of the opportunity to answer his questions, as\r\nthey gave me a text for a general review of a Democratic administration.\r\nI said that the handbill was issued by a gentleman whom I esteemed\r\nvery highly, and for whom I had the greatest good will and friendship,\r\none of their own citizens, who had served in the legislature and\r\nin Congress with credit, and had been a representative of our\r\ngovernment abroad.  I then read the questions one by one and answered\r\nthem, and, as I think, clearly showed to the satisfaction of my\r\nhearers, that, although Mr. Smith was generally sound on other\r\nmatters, he was a little cracked on the question of American\r\nprotection.  My answers were received with great applause by the\r\naudience, and I think my old friend made nothing by his questions.\r\n\r\nAfter making a number of other speeches in Ohio, I spoke in Grand\r\nRapids on the 18th of October; in Indianapolis on the 21st; at Fort\r\nWayne on the 24th, and at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, on\r\nthe 27th.  I closed my speaking in this campaign at Toledo on the\r\n30th.  The time of the fall elections had been changed to the first\r\nTuesday after the first Monday of November.  During the period from\r\nmy return home after the adjournment of Congress until the day of\r\nelection, I spoke almost daily.  The election resulted in a victory\r\nfor the Republican party, the head of the ticket, James S. Robinson,\r\nSecretary of State, receiving about 11,000 majority.\r\n\r\nThe second session of the 49th Congress passed but little important\r\nlegislation except the appropriation bills.  The two Houses were\r\nso widely divergent that they could not agree upon measures of\r\npolitical importance.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December I made an impromptu speech on the revision\r\nof the tariff, in reply to Senator Beck, but as no action was taken\r\nupon the subject at that session, it is useless to quote what I\r\nsaid.  Mr. Beck was a man of great mental as well as physical power.\r\nA Scotchman by birth, he came at an early age to the United States\r\nand settled in Kentucky, where he practiced law, and in due time\r\nbecame a Member of Congress, and afterwards a Senator of the United\r\nStates.  He was aggressive, affirmative and dogmatic, and seemed\r\nto take special delight in opposing me on all financial questions.\r\nHe and I were members of the committee on finance, and had many\r\nverbal contests, but always with good humor.  On the 9th of December,\r\nas I entered the Senate Chamber after a temporary absence, I heard\r\nthe familiar voice of Beck begging, in the name of the Democratic\r\nparty, a chance to reduce taxation.  I promptly replied to him,\r\nand the colloquy between us extended to considerable length.  He\r\nwas, in fact, a free trader, believed in the policy in force in\r\nGreat Britain, and opposed every form of protection to American\r\nindustries.  Our debate brought out the salient arguments on both\r\nsides, though no measure on the subject-matter was pending before\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the holiday recess Senator John A. Logan died at his residence,\r\nCalumet Place, in Washington.  This was announced, in the Senate,\r\nby his colleague, Shelby M. Cullom, on January 4, 1887, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'The angel of death has been abroad throughout the land.'  His\r\nvisitation has been most unexpected during the recent brief recess\r\nof the Senate, and has imposed upon me a duty which I have scarcely\r\nthe heart to perform--the duty of announcing the death of my late\r\ndistinguished colleague.  At his home, which overlooks this capital\r\ncity, at three minutes before three o'clock on Sunday afternoon,\r\nthe 26th of December, the spirit of John A. Logan took its flight\r\ninto the unknown realms of eternity.  On Friday last, the funeral\r\nceremonies were conducted, by the Senators and Representatives\r\npresent, in this Senate Chamber, and his mortal remains were conveyed\r\nto the silent tomb.\r\n\r\n\"We are called upon to mourn the loss of one of the bravest and\r\nnoblest of men--a man loved by the patriotic people of his state\r\nand of the nation, known to his country and to the civilized world\r\nas great in war and in peace, and for nearly fourteen years a\r\ndistinguished Member of this Senate.\"\r\n\r\nLogan is buried in the cemetery of the Soldiers' Home in Washington,\r\nin a conspicuous and beautiful marble tomb erected to his memory\r\nby his widow.  On the 9th of February the business of the Senate\r\nwas suspended, and many Senators, the associates of the deceased,\r\npaid fitting and eloquent tribute to his public and private virtues\r\nin addresses of marked ability and interest.\r\n\r\nHe was a striking character, bold, fearless and aggressive, but\r\nsensitive as a child.  I knew him well when he was a Member of the\r\nHouse before the war.  He was a devoted friend and admirer of\r\nDouglas, and, like him, when the war commenced, threw his whole\r\nsoul into the Union cause.  He was a good soldier, and, of those\r\nwho entered the army from civil life, was among the most distinguished.\r\nHe was a model of the volunteer soldiery.  After the war was over\r\nhe was returned to Congress and served in the House and Senate\r\nuntil his death.  He was a positive man; there were no negative\r\nqualities about him.  Thoroughly honest in his convictions he was\r\nregarded as a strong debater, though somewhat too urgent in presenting\r\nhis opinions, and disposed to take a personal view of controverted\r\nquestions.  I had great respect for Logan, and never had any\r\ncontroversies with him except upon financial questions, upon which\r\nI thought he took at one time erroneous views.  For a long time he\r\nadopted the ideas prevailing in the west in regard to paper money.\r\nUpon further reflection he became satisfied that the policy of\r\nresumption was the right one and adhered to it.  He was a member\r\nof the committee that framed the resumption act, and from the time\r\nthat measure was agreed upon, he, so far as I know, supported it\r\nfirmly and warmly.  He was a good party man; he stood by the judgment\r\nof his political friends.  I never saw the slightest hesitation or\r\ndoubt on his part in supporting a measure which was agreed upon by\r\nhis political associates.  One interesting feature of Logan's life\r\nwas the interest felt by his wife in his public career, and her\r\nhelpfulness to him.  She was the model of a helpmate.  She is in\r\nevery way a good woman.  She has the very qualities that he lacked,\r\nand I might illustrate by many instances her great aid to him in\r\nhis political purposes.\r\n\r\nI had accepted an invitation of the merchants of Boston to attend\r\nthe annual banquet of the Mercantile Association on the 29th of\r\nDecember, but was compelled to withdraw my acceptance, so that, as\r\npresident of the Senate, I could perform certain duties in respect\r\nto Logan's funeral that I could not delegate to others, and which\r\nwere requested of me by the committee on arrangements, through a\r\nnotice sent me by Senator Cullom, the chairman, as follows, and\r\nupon which I acted:\r\n\r\n\"The committee on arrangements at the funeral ceremonies of John\r\nA. Logan, late a Senator of the United States from the State of\r\nIllinois, respectfully request the Honorable John Sherman, a Senator\r\nof the United States from the State of Ohio, to preside at the\r\nfuneral exercises on Friday, December 31, 1886.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Boston invitation it was intimated that some remarks on the\r\nnational banking system would be acceptable.  In declining I wrote\r\na letter expressing my opinion of that system, which I said had\r\nrealized all the good that had ever been claimed for it by its\r\nauthors, that it had furnished the best paper money ever issued by\r\nbanking corporations, that the system was adopted only after the\r\nfullest consideration and had won its way into public favor by slow\r\nprocess, and that I regarded it as the best that had ever been\r\ncreated by law.  The remarkable success of this system, I said,\r\nwas not appreciated by those not familiar with the old state banks.\r\nIt had been adopted by many countries, especially in the far off\r\nisland of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe bill to regulate interstate commerce became a law on the 4th\r\nof February, 1887.  It had passed both Houses at the previous\r\nsession, but, the Senate having disagreed to amendments of the\r\nHouse, the bill and amendments were sent to a committee of conference.\r\nThe report of this committee was fully debated.  I had taken great\r\ninterest in this bill, but had not participated in the debate until\r\nthe 14th of January, when I supported the conference report, while\r\nnot agreeing to some of the amendments made.  Senator Cullom is\r\nentitled to the chief credit for its passage.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February I laid before the Senate the following\r\ncommunication, which was read:\r\n\r\n\"To the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Senators:--My office as president _pro tempore_ of the Senate will\r\nnecessarily terminate on the 4th of March next, with my present\r\nterm as Senator.  It will promote the convenience of the Senate\r\nand the public service to elect a Senator as president _pro tempore_\r\nwhose term extends beyond that date, so that he may administer the\r\noath of office to Senators-elect and aid in the organization.  I,\r\ntherefore, respectfully resign that position, to take effect at\r\none o'clock p. m., on Saturday next, February 26.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, in doing so, to express my heartfelt thanks for the\r\nuniform courtesy and forbearance shown me, while in discharge of\r\nmy duties as presiding officer, by every Member of the Senate.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI said that if there was no objection the communication would be\r\nentered in the journal and placed among the files of the Senate.\r\nOn the 25th John J. Ingalls was elected president _pro tempore_,\r\nto take effect the next day.  On that day I said:\r\n\r\n\"Before administering the oath of office to his successor the\r\noccupant of the chair desires again to return to his fellow Senators\r\nhis grateful acknowledgments for their kind courtesy and forbearance\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a difficult duty to preside over the Senate of the United\r\nStates.  From the establishment of our government to this time the\r\nSenate has always been noted for its order, decorum, and dignity.\r\nWe have but few rules, and they are simple and plain; but we have,\r\nabove all and higher than all, that which pervades all our proceedings\r\n--the courtesy of the Senate, which enables us to dispose of nearly\r\nall of the business of the Senate without question or without\r\ndivision.  I trust that in the future, as in the past, this trait\r\nof the Senate of the United States will be preserved intact, and\r\nI invoke for my successor the same courtesy and forbearance you\r\nhave extended to me.  I now invite him to come forward and take\r\nthe oath of office prescribed by law.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ingalls advanced to the desk of the president _pro tempore_,\r\nand, the oath prescribed by law having been administered to him,\r\nhe took the chair, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Senators, I must inevitably suffer disparagement in your estimation,\r\nby contrast with the parliamentary learning and skill, the urbanity\r\nand accomplishments of my illustrious predecessor, but I shall\r\nstrive to equal him in devotion to your service, and I shall\r\nendeavor, if that be possible, to excel him in grateful appreciation\r\nof the distinguished honor of your suffrages.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harris offered the following resolution, which was unanimously\r\nadopted;\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the thanks of the Senate are hereby tendered to\r\nHon. John Sherman, for the able and impartial manner in which he\r\nhas administered the duties of the office of president _pro tempore_\r\nduring the present Congress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nVISIT TO CUBA AND THE SOUTHERN STATES.\r\nDeparture for Florida and Havana--A Walk Through Jacksonville--\r\nImpressions of the Country--Visit to Cigar Factories and Other\r\nPlaces of Interest--Impressions of Cuba--Experience with Colored\r\nMen at a Birmingham Hotel--The Proprietor Refuses to Allow a\r\nDelegation to Visit Me in my Rooms--Sudden Change of Quarters--\r\nJourney to Nashville and the Hearty Reception Which Followed--Visit\r\nto the Widow of President Polk--My Address to Nashville Citizens--\r\nComment from the Press That Followed It--An Audience of Workingmen\r\nat Cincinnati--Return Home--Trip to Woodbury, Conn., the Home of\r\nMy Ancestors--Invitation to Speak in the Hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives at Springfield, Ill.--Again Charged with \"Waving\r\nthe Bloody Shirt.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session of Congress, early in March, a congenial\r\nparty was formed to visit Florida and Havana.  It was composed of\r\nSenator Charles F. Manderson, wife and niece, Senator T. W. Palmer\r\nand niece, General Anson G. McCook and wife, and myself and daughter.\r\nWe were accompanied by E. J. Babcock, my secretary, and A. J.\r\nGalloway and son, in the employ of the Coast Line road, over which\r\nwe were to pass.  We stopped at Charleston, where the ravages of\r\na recent earthquake were everywhere visible.  Fort Sumter, which\r\nwe visited, was a picture of desolation.  Such a large party\r\nnaturally attracted attention.  At Jacksonville we encountered our\r\nfirst reporter.  He showed me an article in which it was stated\r\nthat we were on a political trip.  This I disclaimed and said we\r\nhad not heard politics mentioned since we left Washington, that we\r\nwere tired out after Congress completed its work and made up a\r\nparty and started off merely for rest and recreation.  I remarked\r\nthat I had been in every state in the Union but one, and wanted to\r\nfinish up the list by seeing Florida.  A colloquy as given by the\r\nreporter was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Senator, my errand was for the purpose of getting your\r\nopinion on matters political.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am out of politics just now.  I want to rest and I do not want\r\npolitics to enter my head for two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you say positively that you are not down here to look after\r\nyour fences for a presidential boom in 1888?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most decidedly not.  I will not say a word about politics until\r\nI reach Nashville on my return.  There I take up the political\r\nstring again and will hold to it for some time.\"\r\n\r\nManderson proposed a walk through the city, the reporter being our\r\nguide.  Orange trees were to be seen on every side.  We were\r\nsurprised to find so large and prosperous a city in Florida, with so\r\nmany substantial business houses and residences.  The weather was\r\ndelightful, neither too hot nor too cold, and in striking contrast\r\nwith the cold and damp March air of Washington.  From Jacksonville\r\nwe went in a steamboat up the St. John's River to Enterprise.\r\nFlorida was the part of the United States to be first touched by\r\nthe feet of white men, and yet it seemed to me to be the most\r\nbackward in the march of progress.  It was interesting chiefly from\r\nits weird and valueless swamps, its sandy reaches and its alligators.\r\nIt is a peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Mexico from the ocean, and\r\na large part of it is almost unexplored.  The part we traversed\r\nwas low, swampy, with dense thickets, and apparently incapable of\r\nreclamation by drainage.  The soil was sandy and poor and the\r\nimpression left on my mind was that it could not be made very\r\nproductive.  There were occasional spots where the earth was far\r\nenough above the sea to insure the growth of orange trees, but even\r\nthen the soil was thin, and to an Ohio farmer would appear only to\r\nbe a worthless sand bank.  This, however, does not apply to all\r\npoints in Florida, especially not to the Indian River region, where\r\nfine oranges and other semitropical fruits are raised in great\r\nabundance.  The Indian River is a beautiful body of water, really\r\nan arm of the sea, on the eastern coast of Florida, separated from\r\nthe Atlantic by a narrow strip of land.  The water is salt and\r\nabounds in game and fish.\r\n\r\nAt Sanford our party was joined by Senator Aldrich and his wife,\r\nand we proceeded by way of Tampa and Key West to Havana, where we\r\narrived on the 17th of March.  The short sail of ninety miles from\r\nKey West transported us to a country of perpetual summers, as\r\ndifferent from the United States as is old Egypt.  After being\r\ncomfortably installed in a hotel we were visited by Mr. Williams,\r\nour consul general, who brought us an invitation from Captain\r\nGeneral Callejas to call upon him.  We did so, Mr. Williams\r\naccompanying us as interpreter.  We were very courteously received\r\nand hospitably entertained.  The captain general introduced us to\r\nhis family and invited us to a reception in the evening, at which\r\ndancing was indulged in by the younger members of the party.  We\r\nspent four very pleasant days in the old city, visiting several of\r\nthe large cigar factories, a sugar plantation in the neighborhood\r\nand other scenes strange to our northern eyes.  The ladies supplied\r\nthemselves with fans gaily decorated with pictures of bull fights,\r\nand the men with Panama hats, these being products peculiar to the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAmong the gentlemen of the party, as already stated, was Frank G.\r\nCarpenter, a bright young man born at Mansfield, Ohio, who has\r\nsince made an enviable reputation as a copious and interesting\r\nletter writer for the press.  His description of Havana is so true\r\nthat I insert a few paragraphs of it here:\r\n\r\n\"Havana has about 300,000 inhabitants.  It was a city when New York\r\nwas still a village, and it is now 100 years behind any American\r\ntown of its size.  It is Spanish and tropical.  The houses are low\r\nstucco buildings put together in block, and resting close up to\r\nnarrow sidewalks.  Most of them are of one or two stories, and\r\ntheir roofs are of red tile which look like red clay drain pipes\r\ncut in two and so laid that they overlap each other.  The residences\r\nare usually built around a narrow court, and their floors are of\r\nmarble, tile or stone.  This court often contains plants and flowers,\r\nand it forms the loafing place of the family in the cool of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\"These streets of Havana are so narrow that in some of them the\r\ncarriages are compelled to go in one direction only.  When they\r\nreturn they must go back by another street.  The sidewalks are not\r\nover three feet wide, and it is not possible for two persons to\r\nwalk abreast upon them.  The better class of Cubans seldom walk,\r\nand the cabbys are freely called upon.  The cab of Havana is a\r\nlow Victoria holding two or three persons.  Their tops come down\r\nso as to shade the eyes, and they have springs which keep every\r\nmolecule of your body in motion while you ride in them.  The horses\r\nuse are hardy mongrel little ponylike animals, who look as though\r\nthey were seldom fed and never cleaned.\r\n\r\n\"The traffic of Havana is largely done by oxen, and the two-wheeled\r\ncart is used exclusively.  This cart is roughly made and it has a\r\ntongue as thick as a railroad tie, nailed to the body of the cart,\r\nand which extends to the heads of the oxen and is there fastened\r\nby a great yoke directly to the horns.  The Cuban ox pulls by his\r\nhead and not his shoulders.  This yoke is strapped by ropes across\r\nthe foreheads of the oxen, and they move along with their heads\r\ndown, pushing great loads with their foreheads.  They are guided\r\nby rope reins fastened to a ring in the nose of the ox.  Some of\r\nthe carts are for a single ox, and these have shafts of about the\r\nsame railroad tie thickness, which are fastened to a yoke which is\r\nput over the horns in the same manner.  Everything is of the rudest\r\nconstruction and the Egyptians of to-day are as well off in this\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\"Prices of everything here seem to me to be very high, and the\r\nmoney of the country is dirty, nasty paper, which is always below\r\npar, and of which you get twelve dollars for five American ones.\r\nA Cuban dollar is worth about forty American cents, and this Cuban\r\nscrip is ground out as fast as the presses can print it.  The lower\r\ndenominations are five, ten, twenty and fifty cent pieces, and you\r\nget your boots blacked for ten Spanish cents.  Even the gold of\r\nCuba is below par, about six per cent. below the American greenback,\r\nand most of it and the silver in use has been punched or chipped\r\nto make money off of the pieces thus cut out.  The country is deeply\r\nin debt, and the taxes are very heavy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the return voyage a strong northwest wind sprang up, and most\r\nof the party, especially the ladies, experienced the disagreeable\r\neffects of being on a small steamer in a rough sea.  They had,\r\nhowever, all recovered by the time we reached Tampa, and as soon\r\nas we landed we started for Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nIn an interview shortly after my return from Cuba, I thus gave the\r\nimpression made upon my mind as to its condition:\r\n\r\n\"And how did you enjoy your visit to Cuba?\"\r\n\r\n\"We spent four days in Havana.  Nobody could be treated with greater\r\ncourtesy.  You know Spanish courtesy is never surpassed anywhere.\r\nBut that cannot prevent me from saying that Cuba is in a deplorable\r\ncondition.  I should judge from what I heard from intelligent Cuban\r\nAmericans living there, and even Spaniards themselves, that the\r\nisland is in a condition of ill-suppressed revolt.  Natives are\r\nnearly to a man in favor of annexation to us.  I think they have\r\ngiven over the idea of independence, for they begin to recognize\r\nthat they are incapable of self-government.  Their condition is\r\nindeed pitiable.  No serfs in Russia were ever greater slaves than\r\nthe Cubans are to Spain.  The revenue they must raise yearly for\r\nSpain, and for which they get no benefit whatever, except the name\r\nof a national protection and the aegis of a flag, is $16,000,000.\r\nThey have no self-government of any kind.  From captain general\r\ndown to the tide-waiter at the docks, the official positions are\r\nheld by Spaniards.  I venture to say that not a single native Cuban\r\nholds an office or receives public emolument.  In addition to the\r\n$16,000,000 sent annually to Spain, Cuba has to pay the salaries\r\nof all the Spanish horde fastened upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the native planters, the wealthier classes, that is,\r\nfavor annexation to the United States?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am told all of them are anxious for it, but I don't think\r\nwe want Cuba as an appendage to the United States.  I would not\r\nfavor annexation.  In spite of the drains upon her, Cuba is enormously\r\nrich in resources, and is a large consumer of our products, on\r\nwhich at present the heavy Spanish duties rest.  What I would favor\r\nwould be a reciprocity treaty with Spain, as to Cuba, so that we\r\nmight send our goods there instead of forcing the Cubans to buy of\r\nEngland, France and Germany.  We could do the island much more good\r\nby trading with her on an equal basis than we ever can by annexing\r\nher.  Cuba, to some extent, is under our eye, we would probably\r\nnever let any other nation than Spain own the island, but so long\r\nas Spain does own it she is welcome to it if she will only let us\r\nsell our goods on equal or better terms than the Cubans can get\r\nthem for elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nI had some time previously accepted an invitation of the members\r\nof the Tennessee legislature to address them, and, therefore, at\r\nJacksonville left the remainder of the party to pursue their way\r\nto Washington at their leisure, while I started for Nashville,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Babcock and Mr. Mussey.  Having a few days to\r\nspare before my appointment at that place, and having heard much\r\nof the wonderful progress and development of the iron industry at\r\nBirmingham, Alabama, I determined to stop at that place.  On our\r\narrival we went to the Hotel Florence, and at once met the \"ubiquitous\r\nreporter.\"  My arrival was announced in the papers, and I was soon\r\ncalled upon by many citizens, who proposed that an informal reception\r\nbe held in the dining room of the hotel that evening, to which I\r\nhad no objection.  Among those present were ex-Senator Willard\r\nWarner, and a number of the leading men who had so quickly transformed\r\nan open farm into the active and progressive city of Birmingham.\r\nThe reception was held and was a very pleasant affair.  Being called\r\nupon for a speech I made a few remarks, which were well received,\r\nand as the gentlemen present expressed a desire to have a larger\r\nmeeting I consented to speak on the following evening at the opera\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, when my room was thronged with callers, most of\r\nwhom were Democrats, I was handed the following note:\r\n\r\n  \"Birmingham, Ala., March 20, 1887.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, U. S. Senator.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--The undersigned, citizens of Birmingham, Alabama, take\r\nthis method of writing you to extend your visit from Nashville,\r\nTennessee, to our growing city, and bear witness to its development\r\nand progress in the prospective mining, manufacturing and business\r\nmetropolis of the state.  Feeling confident that you are naturally\r\ninterested in our welfare and happiness, American citizens in every\r\ncapacity and relation in life, we earnestly trust that you will\r\ncomply with our solicitation.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours respectfully,\r\n  \"Sam'l R. Lowery, Editor 'Southern Freemen.'\r\n  \"A. L. Scott, Real Estate Agent.\r\n  \"W. R. Pettiford, J. M. Goodloe, A. J. Headon, A. D. Jemison and\r\nR. Donald, Pastors of Colored Churches in Birmingham, Ala.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was written to be sent me at Nashville, when it was not\r\nknown that I was at Birmingham, and was indorsed as follows;\r\n\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, U. S. Senator.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--A colored delegation, as given above, desires to call\r\nupon you to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock or at 3.  Please do us\r\nthe kindness to say if we may see you, and when.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours faithfully,\r\n  \"A. L. Scott.\"\r\n\r\nI at once sent word to the delegation that I would see them in my\r\nroom the next morning at 10 o'clock, having already arranged to\r\naccompany some gentlemen on an excursion among the mines and other\r\nevidences of Birmingham's boom at 11 a. m.  The next morning I\r\nwaited in my room with General Warner, Judge Craig and others until\r\n11 o'clock, and, the delegation not appearing, was about to start\r\non my visit to the mines, when the following note was handed me by\r\none of the colored servants of the house:\r\n\r\n  \"Birmingham, Ala.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--In accordance with arrangement, a committee of colored\r\ncitizens of the United States and the State of Alabama came to see\r\nyou at 10 o'clock this morning.  The proprietor of the Florence\r\nhotel declined to allow us to visit your room, and said if we\r\ndesired to see you we must see you outside of the Florence hotel.\r\nWe regret the occurrence, as the committee is composed of the best\r\ncolored citizens of the community.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours respectfully,\r\n  \"A. L. Scott,\r\n  \"W. R. Pettiford,\r\n  \"Samuel R. Lowery,\r\n  \"R. C. D. Benjamin,\r\n  \"Albert Boyd.\"\r\n\r\nI requested General Warner and Judge Craig to go to the proprietor\r\nof the hotel and ask him if it was true that he had forbidden\r\ncertain men going to my room.  The proprietor informed them that\r\nit was true; it was against his rules to allow any colored people\r\nto go upstairs except the servants.  I said I would not allow a\r\nhotel proprietor to say whom I should or should not receive in my\r\nroom.  That was a question I chose to decide for myself.  I therefore\r\nimmediately paid my bill and went to the Metropolitan hotel, where\r\nthe delegation made their call.  Their only object was to read to\r\nme an address of welcome to the city in behalf of the colored\r\npeople.  Their address was well expressed and they were evidently\r\nintelligent and respectable men.  They welcomed me cordially in\r\nbehalf of their race and countrymen, and said:\r\n\r\n\"While we respect your political and statesmanlike life, not an\r\nevent has equaled your manly and heroic conduct in Birmingham,\r\nAlabama, in respect to the persecuted, proscribed and downtrodden\r\nblack citizens, on account of their race, color and proscription\r\nin this city and state.\r\n\r\n\"When you stated to the tavern keeper, if the black citizens were\r\nnot permitted to visit you there, you would go to another tavern,\r\nand if not permitted, you would stop with your baggage in the street\r\nand receive them, shows a sympathy and sentiment that you, though\r\nhonored and able, feel bound with them and to them.  And every\r\nblack man, woman and child thenceforward in our state will pray\r\nHeaven's favor shall follow you and yours to a throne of grace for\r\nSherman, Ohio's noblest, heroic and patriotic statesman.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply I expressed pleasure at meeting the colored people, and,\r\ntouching the Florence hotel affair, advised forbearance.  \"Be true\r\nto yourselves,\" I said, \"be industrious, maintain your own manhood,\r\nand they day will come when you can command recognition as men and\r\ncitizens of the United States, free and equal with all others.\"\r\nI assured them that I entertained as high respect for colored people\r\nas I did for any other citizens.\r\n\r\nI mention this incident at some length because, at the time, it\r\nexcited much comment in the press throughout the United States.\r\nIt is but fair to say that the action of the hotel proprietor was\r\ncondemned by the leading Democrats of Birmingham, prominent among\r\nwhom was the editor of the \"Iron Age.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening I spoke at the opera house, which was well filled\r\nwith representative citizens.  I was introduced by Rufus M. Rhodes,\r\npresident of the News Publishing Company.  My speech was confined\r\nmainly to nonpartisan subjects, to the industries in that section,\r\nand the effect of national legislation upon them.  I had read of\r\nthe vast deposits of coal and iron in that section, and had that\r\nday seen them for myself.  I said:  \"You have stored in the\r\nsurrounding hills elements of a wealth greater than all the banks\r\nof New York.\"  In speaking of the effect of national legislation\r\nupon the development of their resources, I said I would not allude\r\nto politics, because, though a strict party man, as they all knew,\r\nI believed that men who differed with me were as honest as I was;\r\nthat whatever might have occurred in the past, we were a reunited\r\npeople; that we had had our differences, and men of both sides\r\nsought to have their convictions prevail, but I would trust the\r\npatriotism of an ex-Confederate in Alabama as readily as an ex-\r\nUnionist in Ohio; that I was not there to speak of success in war,\r\nbut of the interests and prosperity of their people.  My nonpartisan\r\nspeech was heartily approved.  General Warner made a brief address\r\nto his former constituents, and the meeting then adjourned.\r\n\r\nI went the next day to Nashville, arriving early in the evening.\r\nA committee of the legislature met me on my way.  On my arrival I\r\nmet many of the members of both political parties, and was the\r\nrecipient of a serenade at which William C. Whitthorne, a Democratic\r\nMember of Congress, made a neat speech welcoming me to the hospitality\r\nof the state.  None of the speeches contained any political\r\nsentiments, referring mainly to the hopeful and prosperous outlook\r\nof the interests of Tennessee.  During the next day I visited with\r\nthe committee, at the head of which was Mr. Kerchival, the mayor\r\nof the city, several manufacturing establishments, and the Fisk\r\nand Vanderbilt universities, and also a school for colored boys.\r\nAmong the more agreeable visits that day was one made at the\r\nresidence of Mrs. Polk, the widow of President Polk.  I remembered\r\nher when she was the honored occupant and mistress of the White\r\nHouse, at the time of my first visit to Washington in the winter\r\nof 1846-47.  She was still in vigorous health, and elegant and\r\ndignified lady.\r\n\r\nI wish here to express my grateful appreciation of the reception\r\ngiven me by the people of Nashville on this occasion.  There was\r\nno appearance of mere form and courtesy due to a stranger among\r\nthem, but a hearty general welcome, such as would be extended to\r\none representing their opinions and identified with their interests.\r\nI met there several gentlemen with whom I had served in Congress,\r\nmost of whom had been in the Confederate service.  One of them paid\r\nme a compliment after hearing my speech by saying:  \"Sherman, your\r\nspeech will trouble the boys some, but I could answer you.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was made on the evening of the 24th of March, 1887, in\r\nthe hall of the house of representatives.  It was carefully prepared\r\nwith the expectation that it would be delivered to an unsympathetic\r\naudience of able men.  I delivered it with scarcely a reference to\r\nmy notes, and substantially in the language written.  Tennessee\r\nand Kentucky had been Whig states, strongly in favor of protection,\r\nand before the war were represented by John Bell and Henry Clay.\r\nI claimed my fellowship with the people of Tennessee in the old\r\nWhig times, and, aside from the questions that grew out of the war,\r\nassumed that they were still in favor of the policy of protection\r\nof American industries by tariff laws.  I did not evade the slavery\r\nquestion or the War of the Rebellion, but said of them what I would\r\nhave said in Ohio.  I made an appeal on behalf of the negro, and\r\nquoted what Senator Vest had eloquently said, that \"the southern\r\nman who would wrong them deserves to be blotted from the roll of\r\nmanhood.\"  All we asked for the negro was that the people of\r\nTennessee would secure to him the rights and privileges of an\r\nAmerican citizen, according to the constitution of the United\r\nStates.  I then presented the questions of the hour, taxation,\r\ncurrency, public credit, foreign and domestic commerce, education\r\nand internal improvements.  On these questions I said the people\r\nof Tennessee had like interests and opinions with the people of\r\nOhio, that the past was beyond recall, that for evil or good the\r\nrecord was made up and laid away.  I discussed each of these\r\nsubjects, dwelling mainly on taxation and currency; in the one was\r\nthe protection and promotion of home industries, and in the other\r\nwas the choice between bank notes of the olden time, and United\r\nStates notes and national bank notes secured by the bonds of the\r\nUnited States.  I closed with these words:\r\n\r\n\"But I do, in the presence of you all, claim for the Republican\r\nparty, and defy contradiction, that in the grandeur of its\r\nachievements, in the benefits it has conferred upon the people, in\r\nthe patriotic motives that have animated it, and the principles\r\nthat have guided it, in the fidelity, honesty, and success of its\r\nadministration of great public trusts, it will compare favorably\r\nwith the record of any administration of any government in ancient\r\nor modern times.  We ask you to aid us, to help us.  We make this\r\nappeal in the same words to the Confederate gray as to the Union\r\nblue--to whoever in our great country is willing in the future to\r\nlend a helping hand or vote to advance the honor, grandeur and\r\nprosperity of this great republic.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech, being made by a Republican at the capital of a southern\r\nDemocratic state, attracted great attention from the public press,\r\nand, much to my surprise, several of the leading Democratic and\r\nindependent papers commended it highly.  This was notably the case\r\nwith the Louisville \"Courier Journal,\" the Washington \"Evening\r\nStar,\" and the New York \"Herald.\"  A brief extract from the latter\r\nis given as an indication of public sentiment:\r\n\r\n\"Senator Sherman's Nashville speech is the first address on national\r\npolitics ever spoken by a Republican of national reputation to a\r\nsouthern audience.  He was welcomed by the prominent citizens of\r\nthe Tennessee capital, and spoke to a crowded and attentive audience\r\nin the hall of representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Both the speech and the welcome the speaker received are notable\r\nand important events.  Mr. Sherman spoke as a Republican in favor\r\nof Republican politics, and what he said was frankly and forcibly\r\nput.  If the Republican leaders are wise they will take care to\r\ncirculate Mr. Sherman's Nashville speech all over the south, and\r\nthrough the north as well.  He spoke for high protection, for\r\ninternal improvements, for liberal expenditures on public buildings,\r\nfor the Blair education bill, for the maintenance of the present\r\ncurrency system, and for spending the surplus revenue for public\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\"All that is the straightest and soundest Republican doctrine.  He\r\ntold his hearers, also, that the war is over, and that the interests\r\nof Tennessee and other southern states must naturally draw them to\r\nthe Republican party.  He spoke to attentive ears.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was reprinted and had considerable circulation, but,\r\nlike the shadows that pass, it is probably forgotten by all who\r\nheard or read it.  I consider it as one of the best, in temper,\r\ncomposition and argument, that I ever made.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that I was to be driven to Saint Paul's chapel\r\nafter the meeting.  The occasion was the assemblage of the educational\r\nassociation of the African Methodist Episcopal church, and their\r\nfriends.  The chapel was a large, handsome, well-furnished room,\r\nand was crowded to the door with well-dressed men and women.  Dr.\r\nBryant made an address of welcome, and Bishop Turner introduced me\r\nto the audience.  I made a brief response and excused myself from\r\nspeaking further on account of fatigue.  General Grosvenor and ex-\r\nSenator Warner made short speeches.  Our party then returned to\r\nthe hotel.  To me this meeting was a surprise and a gratification.\r\nHere was a body of citizens but lately slaves, who, in attendance\r\non religious services and afterward remaining until a late hour\r\nlistening to us, behaved with order, attention and intelligence.\r\nThe report of my remarks, as given in their newspapers, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Senator Sherman said that the praise of himself had been too high.\r\nHe had voted for the emancipation of the negro race in the District\r\nof Columbia, an event which had preceded the emancipation proclamation\r\nof Abraham Lincoln.  He supported it as a great act of national\r\nauthority and of justice.  Therefore, he could appear as a friend\r\nof the race and of liberty.  He had not voted for it because they\r\nwere negroes, but he had voted for it because they were men and\r\nwomen.  He would have voted for the whites as well.  He spoke of\r\nthe society and said any measure that would tend to elevate the\r\nrace he was in favor of.  What the race wanted was not more rights\r\nbut more education.  Their rights were secured to them by the\r\nconstitution of the United States, and the time would come when\r\nthey would enjoy them as freely as anyone.  They should not be\r\nimpatient to advance.  Prejudice could not be overcome in a short\r\nperiod.  He said the best way to overcome all prejudice was by\r\nelevating themselves; but not by gaudy extravagance, groans, abuse,\r\nwar, or tumult of war.  They had the same right to become lawyers,\r\ndoctors, soldiers and heroes as the white man had.\r\n\r\n\"When they became as advanced as the whites around them there would\r\nbe no trouble about their franchises.  Now they were free men and\r\nthey should become freeholders.  After they had got education they\r\nshould accumulate property.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next morning I left Nashville for Cincinnati, where I arrived\r\non the evening of the 25th of March and took lodgings at the Gibson\r\nHouse.  I was to speak at Turner Hall on the next evening, under\r\nthe auspices of the Lincoln and Blaine clubs.  It was a busy day\r\nwith me in receiving calls and in visiting the chamber of commerce\r\nand the two clubs where speeches were made and hand shaking done.\r\nStill, I knew what I was to say at the meeting, and the composition\r\nof the audience I was to address.  The hall is large, with good\r\nacoustic qualities, and in it I had spoken frequently.  It is situated\r\nin the midst of a dense population of workingmen, and was so crowded\r\nthat night in every part that many of the audience were compelled\r\nto stand in the aisles and around the walls.  On entering I mentally\r\ncontrasted my hearers with those at Faneuil Hall and Nashville.\r\nHere was a sober, attentive and friendly body of workingmen, who\r\ncame to hear and weigh what was said, not in the hurry of Boston\r\nor with the criticism of political opponents as in Nashville, but\r\nwith an earnest desire to learn and to do what was best for the\r\ngreat body of workingmen, of whom they were a part.  I was introduced\r\nin a kindly way by ex-Governor Noyes.  After a brief reference to\r\nmy trip to Florida and Cuba, I described the country lying southwest\r\nof the Alleghany mountains, about two hundred miles wide, extending\r\nfrom Detroit to Mobile, destined to be the great workshop of the\r\nUnited States, where coal and iron could be easily mined, where\r\nfood was abundant and cheap, and in a climate best fitted for the\r\ndevelopment of the human race.  In this region, workingmen, whether\r\nfarmers, mechanics or laborers, would always possess political\r\npower as the controlling majority of the voters.  I claimed that\r\nthe Republican party was the natural home of workingmen, that its\r\npolicy, as developed for thirty years, had advanced our industrial\r\ninterests and diversified the employments of the people.  This led\r\nto a review of our political policy, the homestead law, the abolition\r\nof slavery, good money always redeemable in coin, the development\r\nof manufactures and the diversity of employments.  I discussed the\r\ncreation of new parties, such as the labor party and the temperance\r\nparty, and contended that their objects could better be attained\r\nby the old parties.  I referred to the organization of a national\r\nbureau of labor, to a bill providing for arbitration, and other\r\nmeasures in the interest of labor.  I stated the difficulties in\r\nthe way of the government interposing between capital and labor.\r\nThey were like husband and wife; they must settle their quarrels\r\nbetween them, but the law, if practicable, should provide a mode\r\nof adjustment.  I closed with the following appeal to them as\r\nworkingmen:\r\n\r\n\"Let us stand by the Republican party, and we will extend in due\r\ntime our dominion and power into other regions; not by annexation,\r\nnot by overriding peaceable and quiet people, but by our commercial\r\ninfluence, by extending our steamboat lines into South America,\r\nby making all the Caribbean Sea one vast American ocean; by planting\r\nour influence among the sister republics, by aiding them from time\r\nto time, and thus, by pursuing an American policy, become the ruler\r\nof other dominions.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Cincinnati, after a brief visit to Mansfield, I returned to\r\nWashington to await the opening of spring weather, which rarely\r\ncomes in the highlands of Ohio until the middle of May.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman and I had been invited several times to visit\r\nWoodbury, Connecticut, for nearly two centuries the home of our\r\nancestors.  In April, both being in Washington, we concluded to do\r\nso, and advised Mr. Cothron, the historian of Woodbury, of our\r\npurpose.  We arrived in the evening at Waterbury, and there found\r\nthat our coming was known.  Several gentlemen met us at the depot\r\nand conducted us to the hotel, some of them having served with\r\nGeneral Sherman in the Civil War.  Among them was a reporter.  We\r\nexplained to him that we were on our way to Woodbury, had no plans\r\nto execute, intended to erect no monuments, as was stated, and only\r\nwished to see where our ancestors had lived and died.  General\r\nSherman was rather free in his talk about the steep hills and cliffs\r\nnear High Rock grove.  These he admired as scenery, but he said:\r\n\"I cannot see how this rocky country can be converted into farming\r\nlands that can be made profitable;\" also \"I am indeed pleased to\r\nthink that my ancestors moved from this region to Ohio in 1810.\"\r\nAmong the callers was S. M. Kellogg, who had served with me in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we went to Woodbury, called on William Cothron,\r\nand proceeded to the cemetery and other places of note in the\r\nneighborhood.  In this way the day was pleasantly spent.  I thought\r\nthere were signs of decay in the old village since my former visit,\r\nbut this may have been caused by the different seasons of the year\r\nat which these visits were made.  Woodbury looks more like an\r\nEngland shire town than any other in Connecticut.  Its past history\r\nwas full of interest, but the birth and growth of manufacturing\r\ntowns all around eclipsed it and left only its memories.  After\r\nvisiting the site of the old Sherman homestead, about a mile from\r\ntown, and the famous Stoddard house, in which my grandmother was\r\nborn, we returned to New York.\r\n\r\nI had been invited by the officers and members of the Illinois\r\nlegislature, then in session at Springfield, to speak in the hall\r\nof the house of representatives on the political issues of the day.\r\nI accepted with some reluctance, as I doubted the expediency of a\r\npartisan address at such a place.  My address at Nashville, no\r\ndoubt, led to the invitation; but the conditions were different in\r\nthe two cities.  At Nashville it was expected that I would make a\r\nconciliatory speech, tending to harmony between the sections, while\r\nat Springfield I could only make a partisan speech, on lines well\r\ndefined between the two great parties, and, as I learned afterwards,\r\nby reason of local issues, to a segment of the Republican party.\r\nHad I known this in advance I would have declined the invitation.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of June was the day appointed.  I arrived in Chicago, at\r\na late hour, on the 29th of May, stopping at the Grand Pacific\r\nhotel, and soon after received the calls of many citizens in the\r\nrotunda.  On the evening of the 30th I was tendered a reception by\r\nthe Union League club in its library, and soon became aware of the\r\nfact that one segment of the Republican party, represented by the\r\nChicago \"Tribune,\" was not in attendance.  The reception, however,\r\nwas a very pleasant one, greatly aided by a number of ladies.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, accompanied by Senator Charles B. Farwell and a\r\ncommittee of the club, I went to Springfield.  I have often traversed\r\nthe magnificent State of Illinois, but never saw it clothed more\r\nbeautifully than on this early summer day.  The broad prairies\r\ncovered with green, the wide reaches of cultivated land, rich with\r\ngrowing corn, wheat and oats, presented pictures of fertility that\r\ncould not be excelled in any portion of the world.  I met Governor\r\nOglesby and many leading citizens of Illinois on the way, and on\r\nmy arrival at Springfield was received by Senator Cullom and other\r\ndistinguished gentlemen, and conducted to the Leland hotel, but\r\nsoon afterward was taken to the residence of Senator Cullom, where\r\nseveral hours were spent very pleasantly.  Later in the evening I\r\nattended a reception tendered by Governor and Mrs. Oglesby, and\r\nthere met the great body of the members of the legislature and many\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June an elaborate order of arrangements, including\r\na procession, was published, but about noon there came a heavy\r\nshower of rain that changed the programme of the day.  A platform\r\nhad been erected at the corner of the statehouse, from which the\r\nspeaking was to be made.  This had to be abandoned and the meeting\r\nwas held in the hall of the house of representatives, to which no\r\none could enter without a ticket.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 2:40 p. m. that we entered the hall, when Governor\r\nOglesby, taking the speaker's chair, rapped for order and briefly\r\naddressed the assembly.  I was then introduced and delivered the\r\nspeech I had prepared, without reading or referring to it.  It was\r\npublished and widely circulated.  The following abstract, published\r\nin the Chicago \"Inter-Ocean,\" indicates the topics I introduced:\r\n\r\n\"The Senator began first to awaken applause at the mention of the\r\nname of Lincoln, repeated soon after and followed by a popular\r\nrecognition of the name of Douglas.  He quoted from Logan, and\r\ncheers and applause greeted his words.  There was Democratic applause\r\nwhen he proclaimed his belief 'that had Douglas lived he would have\r\nbeen as loyal as Lincoln himself,' and again it resounded louder\r\nstill when Logan received a hearty tribute.  He touched upon the\r\nsuccesses of our protective policy, and again the applause accentuated\r\nhis point.  He exonerated the Confederate soldier from sympathy\r\nwith the atrocities of reconstruction times, and his audience\r\nappreciated it.  He charged the Democratic party in the south with\r\nthese atrocities and the continual effort to deprive the negro of\r\nhis vote, and the audience appreciated that.  His utterance that\r\nhe would use the power of Congress to get the vote of a southern\r\nRepublican counted at least once, excited general applause.  They\r\nlaughed when he asked what Andrew Jackson would have thought of\r\nCleveland, and they laughed again when he declared the Democrats\r\nwanted to reduce the revenue, but didn't know how.  He read them\r\nthe tariff plank in the Confederate platform, and they laughed to\r\nsee how it agreed with the same plank in the Democratic platform.\r\nFrom discussion of the incapacity of the Democrats to deal with\r\nthe tariff question, from their very construction of the constitution,\r\nthe Senator passed to the labor question, thence carrying the\r\ninterest of his hearers to the purpose of the Republicans to educate\r\nthe masses, and make internal improvements.  His audience felt the\r\npoint well made when he declared the President allowed the internal\r\nimprovement bill to expire by a pocket veto because it contained\r\na $5,000 provision for the Hennepin Canal.  In excellent humor the\r\naudience heard him score the Democracy for its helplessness to meet\r\nthe currency question, and finally pass, in his peroration, to an\r\nelaboration of George William Curtis' eulogy of the achievements\r\nof the Republican party.  He read the twelve Republican principles,\r\nand each utterance received its applause like the readoption of a\r\npopular creed.  'The Democrats put more jail birds in office in\r\ntheir brief term than the Republicans did in the twenty-four years\r\nof our magnificent service,' exclaimed Senator Sherman, and his\r\naudience laughed, cheered, and applauded.  Applause followed each\r\nclosing utterance as the Senator outlined the purposes of the party\r\nfor future victory, and predicted that result, the Democrats under\r\nthe Confederate flag, the Republicans under the flag of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nI returned the next day to Chicago, and in the evening was tendered\r\na public reception in the parlors of the Grant Pacific hotel.\r\nAlthough Chicago was familiar to me, yet I was unknown to the people\r\nof Chicago.  One or two thousand people shook hands with me and\r\nwith them several ladies.  Among those I knew were Justice Harlan,\r\nRobert T. Lincoln and Walker and Emmons Blaine.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Mansfield I soon observed, in the Democratic and\r\nconservative papers, hostile criticism of my Springfield speech,\r\nand especially of my arraignment of the crimes at elections in the\r\nsouth, and of the marked preference by Cleveland in the appointments\r\nto office of Confederate soldiers rather than Union soldiers.  A\r\ncontrast was made between the Nashville and Springfield speeches,\r\nand the latter was denounced as \"waving the bloody shirt.\"  Perhaps\r\nthe best answer to this is the following interview with me, about\r\nthe middle of June:\r\n\r\n\"So much fault is found with the Springfield speech by the opponents\r\nof the Republican party, and so many accusations made of inconsistency\r\nwith the Nashville speech, that perhaps you may say--what you meant\r\n--what the foremost purpose was in both cases?\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant my Springfield speech to be an historical statement of\r\nthe position of the two parties and their tendencies and aims in\r\nthe past and for the future.  In this respect it differed from the\r\nNashville speech, which was made to persuade the people of the\r\nsouth, especially of Tennessee, that their material interests would\r\nbe promoted by the policy of the Republican party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you find anything in the Springfield speech to moderate or\r\nmodify?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I said a word in the Springfield speech but what\r\nis literally true, except, perhaps, the statement that 'there is\r\nnot an intelligent man in this broad land, of either party, who\r\ndoes not know that Mr. Cleveland is now President of the United\r\nStates by virtue of crimes against the elective franchise.'  This\r\nmay be too broad, but upon a careful analysis I do not see how I\r\ncould modify it if fair force is given to the word 'intelligent.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You stand by the speech, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, since the speech has been pretty severely handled by several\r\neditors whom I am bound to respect, I have requested it to be\r\nprinted in convenient form, and intend to send it to these critics\r\nwith a respectful request that they will point out any error of\r\nfact contained in it, or any inconsistency between it and my\r\nNashville speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not admit that the two speeches are in two voices?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can discover no inconsistency.  And now, after seeing and\r\nweighting these criticisms, I indorse and repeat every word of both\r\nspeeches.  It may be that the speech was impolitic, but, as I have\r\nnot usually governed my speeches and conduct by the rule of policy,\r\nas distinguished from the rule of right, I do not care to commence\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the persistent charge of unfriendliness to southern\r\npeople and the accusation that you are shaking the bloody shirt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how the arraignment of election methods that confessedly\r\ndestroy the purity or the sanctity of the ballot box, and deprive\r\na million of people of their political rights, can be ignored or\r\nsilenced in a republic by the shoo-fly cry of 'bloody shirt.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no hope of persuasion of the southern people at large to\r\nsee the justice of the demand for equal political rights?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot see any reason why the Confederate cause, which was\r\n'eternally wrong,' but bravely and honestly fought out, should be\r\nloaded down with the infamy of crimes which required no courage,\r\ncommitted long since the war, by politicians alone, for political\r\npower and for the benefit of the Democratic party.  I can find some\r\nexcuse for these atrocities in the strong prejudice of caste and\r\nrace in the south, growing out of centuries of slavery, but I can\r\nfind no excuse for any man of any party in the north, who is willing\r\nto submit to have his political power controlled and overthrown by\r\nsuch means.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nINDORSED FOR PRESIDENT BY THE OHIO STATE CONVENTION.\r\nI Am Talked of as a Presidential Possibility--Public Statement of\r\nMy Position--Unanimous Resolution Adopted by the State Convention\r\nat Toledo on July 28, 1887--Text of the Indorsement--Trip Across\r\nthe Country with a Party of Friends--Visit to the Copper and Nickel\r\nMining Regions--Stop at Winnipeg--A Day at Banff--Vast Snowsheds\r\nAlong the Canadian Pacific Railroad--Meeting with Carter H. Harrison\r\non Puget Sound--Rivalry Between Seattle and Tacoma--Trying to Locate\r\n\"Mount Tacoma\"--Return Home After a Month's Absence--Letter to\r\nGeneral Sherman--Visit to the State Fair--I Attend a Soldiers'\r\nMeeting at Bellville--Opening Campaign Speech at Wilmington--Talk\r\nto Farmers in New York State--Success of the Republican Ticket in\r\nOhio--Blaine Declines to Be a Candidate.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of June and July, 1887, the question of the\r\nselection of the Republican candidate for President in the following\r\nyear was discussed in the newspapers, in the conventions, and among\r\nthe people.  The names of Blaine and myself were constantly canvassed\r\nin connection with that office, and others were named.  I was\r\nrepeatedly written to and talked with about it, and uniformly said,\r\nto warm personal friends, that in view of my experience at previous\r\nnational conventions I would not be a candidate without the support\r\nof a united delegation from Ohio, and the unanimous indorsement of\r\na state convention.  I referred to the fact that in every period\r\nof my political career I had been supported by the people of Ohio,\r\nand would not aspire to a higher position without their hearty\r\napproval.  This statement was openly and publicly made and published\r\nin the newspapers.  The \"Commercial Gazette,\" of Cincinnati was\r\nauthorized to make this declaration:\r\n\r\n\"If the Republicans of Ohio want Mr. Sherman for their presidential\r\ncandidate they can say so at the Toledo convention.  If not, Mr.\r\nSherman will be entirely content with the position he now occupies,\r\nand will not be in the field as a presidential candidate.\"\r\n\r\nI also wrote the following to a friend, and it was afterwards\r\npublished:\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to be held up to the people of the United States as\r\na presidential candidate if there is any doubt about Ohio.  I do\r\nnot, as many think, seek for the high honor, nor do I ask anyone to\r\naid me in securing the nomination.  I am as passive about it as\r\nany man can be whose merits or demerits are discussed in that\r\nconnection.  I do not desire the nomination, nor shall I encourage\r\nanyone to secure it for me until Ohio Republicans, who have conferred\r\nupon me the honors I have enjoyed, shall, with substantial unanimity,\r\nexpress their wish for my nomination.\"\r\n\r\nThis led my friends to determine to present this question to the\r\napproaching state convention at Toledo.  It was said that, as this\r\nwould be held in a year in advance of the national convention, it\r\nwas too soon to open the subject, but the conclusive answer was\r\nthat no other state convention would be held prior to the national\r\nconvention, and that it was but fair that I should have the chance\r\nto decline if there should be a substantial difference of opinion\r\nin the convention, and should have the benefit of its approval if\r\nit should be given.\r\n\r\nIt was understood that Governor Foraker would be unanimously\r\nrenominated for governor.  He doubted the policy of introducing in\r\nthat contest a resolution in favor of my nomination for President,\r\nbut said it if should be passed he would support it.  The press of\r\nthe state was somewhat divided as to the policy of the convention\r\nmaking a declaration of a choice for President, but indicated an\r\nalmost universal opinion that there should be an undivided delegation\r\nin favor of my nomination.  As the convention approached, the\r\nfeeling in favor of such declaration grew stronger, and when it\r\nmet at Toledo, on the 28th of July, there was practically no\r\nopposition.  After the preliminary organization ex-Governor Foster\r\nreported a series of resolutions, which strongly indorsed me for\r\nPresident, and highly commended Foraker for renomination as governor.\r\nThe convention called for the rereading of these resolutions and\r\nthey were applauded and unanimously adopted.  The committee on\r\npermanent organization nominated me as chairman of the convention.\r\nIn assuming these duties I made a speech commending the nomination\r\nof Governor Foraker and the action of the recent general assembly,\r\nand closed with these words:\r\n\r\n\"I have but one other duty to perform, and that I do with an\r\noverflowing heart.  I thank you with all my heart for the resolution\r\nthat you have this day passed in respect to your choice for a\r\nPresident of the United States.  I know, my fellow-citizens, that\r\nthis is a matter of sentiment.  I know that this resolution is of\r\nno importance unless the voters of the States of Ohio and of the\r\nseveral states should, in their free choice, elect delegates who\r\nwill agree with you in your opinion.  I recognize the district\r\nrule, and the right of every district to speak its own voice.  I\r\nstood by that rule in 1880, when I knew that its adoption would\r\ncut off all hopes of my friends at that time.  I also knew that\r\nthere was another rule, that no man ought to be held as a candidate\r\nfor that high office unless he has the substantial, unanimous voice\r\nof his party friends behind him.  I believe that is a true rule,\r\nand it ought to be exercised to promote harmony and good will and\r\nfriendship among Republicans.  Now, my countrymen, again thanking\r\nyou for this expression, I tell you with all frankness that I think\r\nmore of your unanimous praise this day uttered than I do of the\r\noffice of President of United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution, as adopted, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Recognizing, as the Republicans of Ohio always have, the gifted\r\nand tried statesmen of the Republican party of other states, loyal\r\nand unfaltering in their devotion to the success of the organization\r\nin 1888, under whatever standard bearer the Republican national\r\nconvention may select, they have just pride in the record and career\r\nof John Sherman, as a member of the Republican party, and as a\r\nstatesman of fidelity, large experience and great ability.  His\r\ncareer as a statesman began with the birth of the Republican party;\r\nhe has grown and developed with the growth of that organization;\r\nhis genius and patriotism are stamped upon the records of the party\r\nand the statutes and constitution of the country, and, believing\r\nthat his nomination for the office of President would be wise and\r\njudicious, we respectfully present his name to the people of the\r\nUnited States as a candidate, and announce our hearty and cordial\r\nsupport of him for that office.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention then proceeded to form a state ticket.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer vacation of 1887, I made a trip across the\r\ncontinent from Montreal to Victoria, Vancouver Island, and from\r\nthe Sound to Tacoma, going over the Canadian Pacific railroad, and\r\nreturning by that line to Port Arthur, at the head of Lake Superior\r\nthen, by one of the iron steamers of the Canadian Pacific road,\r\nthrough Lake Superior and Lake Huron to Owen Sound, and from there\r\nby rail to Toronto and home.\r\n\r\nI had for many years desired to visit that country and to view for\r\nmyself its natural resources and wonders, and to inspect the\r\nachievement of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nI was accompanied on this journey by James S. Robinson, formerly\r\nsecretary of state of Ohio, ex-Congressman Amos Townsend, for many\r\nyears Member from Cleveland, and Charles H. Grosvenor, Member of\r\nCongress from Athens, Ohio.  We met at Cleveland and spent the next\r\nnight at Toronto.  Thence we proceeded to Montreal, and there\r\nreceived many courtesies from gentlemen distinguished in private\r\nand public life.  We left Toronto on the night of the 1st of August,\r\nin a special car attached to the great through train which then\r\nmade its journey to Vancouver in about six days.  We halted at\r\nSudbury, the point on the Canadian Pacific from which the Sault\r\nSte. Marie line of railway diverges from the main track.  We spent\r\ntwenty-four hours at Sudbury, visiting the copper and nickel mining\r\noperations, then in their infancy.  Proceeding, we passed the head\r\nof Lake Superior, and thence to Winnipeg.  At this place the officers\r\nof the provincial government showed us many attentions, and I was\r\nespecially delighted by a visit I made to Archbishop Taché of the\r\nCatholic church, a very aged man.  He had been a missionary among\r\nthe Indians at the very earliest period of time when missionary\r\nwork was done in that section.  He had been a devoted and faithful\r\nman, and now, in the evening of his life, enjoyed the greatest\r\nrespect and received the highest honors from the people of his\r\nneighborhood, regardless of race or religion.\r\n\r\nProceeding from Winnipeg, we entered the great valley of the\r\nSaskatchewan, traversed the mighty wheat fields of that prolific\r\nprovince, and witnessed the indications of the grain producing\r\ncapacity in that portion of Canada, alone quite sufficient, if\r\npushed to its utmost, the furnish grain for the whole continent of\r\nAmerica.  We spent one night for rest and observation at a point\r\nnear the mouth of the Bow River, and then proceeded to Calgary.\r\nThis is the westernmost point where there is arable and grazing\r\nlands before beginning the ascent of the Rocky mountains.  Here we\r\ninspected a sheep ranch owned by a gentleman from England.  It is\r\nlocated at Cochrane, a few miles west of Calgary.  It was managed\r\nby a young gentleman of most pleasing manners and great intelligence,\r\nwho was surrounded at the time of our visit by numerous Scotch\r\nherdsmen, each of whom had one or more collie dogs.  The collie,\r\nas everybody knows, is a Scotch production, and it has been imported\r\ninto the country largely for the service of the great sheep and\r\ncattle ranches of the west.  One shepherd was about to depart from\r\nCanada to reoccupy his home in Scotland, and among his other effects\r\nwas a collie, passing under the name of Nellie.  She was a beautiful\r\nanimal, and so attracted my attention that at my suggestion General\r\nGrosvenor bought her, and undertook to receive her at the train as\r\nwe should pass east a week or ten days later.  The train, on our\r\nreturn, passed Calgary station at about two o'clock in the morning\r\nin the midst of a pouring rain storm, but the shepherd was on hand\r\nwith the dog, and her pedigree carefully written out, and the\r\ncompliments of Mr. Cochrane, and his assurance that the pedigree\r\nwas truthful.  Nellie was brought to Ohio, and her progeny is very\r\nnumerous in the section of the state where she lived and flourished.\r\n\r\nLeaving Calgary, we followed the valley of the Bow River.  The\r\ncurrent of this river is very swift in the summer, fed as it is by\r\nthe melting of the snows of the Rocky mountains.  We soon began to\r\nrealize that we were ascending amid the mighty peaks of the great\r\ninternational chain.  We spent one day at Banff, the National Park\r\nof the Dominion.  Here we found water, boiling hot, springing out\r\nfrom the mountain side, and a magnificent hotel--apparently out of\r\nall proportion to the present or prospective need--being erected,\r\nwith every indication of an effort, at least, to make the Canadian\r\nNational Park a popular place of resort.\r\n\r\nAll about this region of country it is claimed there are deposits\r\nof gold and silver, and at one point we saw the incipient development\r\nof coal mining, coal being produced which it was claimed, and it\r\nseemed to me with good reason, to be equal in valuable qualities\r\nto the Pennsylvania anthracite.\r\n\r\nPassing from the National Park and skirting the foot of the Giant\r\nmountains, we entered the mighty valley of the great Fraser River.\r\nThe scenery between Calgary and Kamloops is indescribably majestic.\r\nWe were furnished by the railroad company with a time-table in the\r\nform of a pamphlet, and a description of the principal railway\r\nstations and surrounding country written by Lady Smith, the wife\r\nof Sir Donald Smith, of Montreal, one of the original projectors\r\nof the Canadian Pacific railroad.  This lady was an artist, a poet,\r\nwith high literary attainment, and her descriptions of the mountains,\r\nof the glaciers, of the rivers and scenery were exceedingly well\r\ndone.  We stopped at one of the company hotels, at the foot of one\r\nof the mightiest mountains, whose peak ascends thousands of feet\r\ninto the air, and at whose base, within a few rods of the entrance\r\nto the hotel, was the greatest of the mighty glaciers, almost equal\r\nin beauty and grandeur, as seen by us, with the far-famed glacier\r\nof the Rhone.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this railroad through the mountains is a marvel\r\nof engineering skill and well illustrates what the persistence and\r\nindustry of man can accomplish.  More than seventy miles of this\r\nline, as I remember it, are covered by snowsheds, constructed of\r\nstanch timbers along the base of the mountain in such a manner that\r\nthe avalanches, which occasionally rush down from the mountain top\r\nand from the side of the mountain, strike upon the sheds and so\r\nfall harmless into the valley below, while the powerful locomotives\r\ngo rushing through the snowsheds, heedless of the dangers overhead.\r\n\r\nThe Fraser River was full of camps of men engaged in the business\r\nof catching, drying and canning the salmon of that stream.  The\r\ntimber along this river is of great importance.  The Canadian fir\r\nand other indigenous trees line the banks and mountain sides in a\r\nquantity sufficient to supply the demand of the people of that\r\ngreat country for many years to come.  But it was unpleasant to\r\nwitness the devastation that the fires had made by which great\r\nsections of the forests had been killed.  The Canadian government\r\nhas made a determined effort to suppress these fires in their\r\nforests and upon their plains, and it is one of the duties of the\r\nmounted police force, which we saw everywhere along the line of\r\nthe road, to enforce the regulations in regard to the use of fire,\r\nbut, naturally and necessarily, nearly all these efforts are abortive\r\nand great destruction results.\r\n\r\nVancouver, at the mouth of the Fraser, is the terminus of the\r\nCanadian Pacific railway.  At this point steamers are loaded for\r\nthe China and Japan trade and a passenger steamer departs daily,\r\nand perhaps oftener, for Victoria, an important city at the point\r\nof Vancouver Island.  We had a delightful trip on this steamer,\r\nrunning in and out among the almost numberless islands.  It was an\r\ninteresting and yet most intricate passage.\r\n\r\nAt Victoria we were entertained by gentlemen of public position\r\nand were also shown many attentions by private citizens.  We were\r\ninvited to attend a dinner on board of a great British war vessel,\r\nthen lying at Esquimault.  A canvass of our party disclosed the\r\nfact that our dress suits had been left at Vancouver, and being on\r\nforeign soil and under the domination of her British majesty's\r\nflag, we felt it was impossible to accept the invitation, and so,\r\nwith a manifestation of great reluctance on the part of my associates,\r\nthe invitation was declined.\r\n\r\nWe went by steamer to Seattle, Washington Territory, where we\r\nremained over night and were very kindly received and entertained\r\nby the people.  Among the persons who joined in the reception were\r\nWatson C. Squire and his wife, then residents of the territory.\r\nMr. Squire, after the admission of Washington as a state, became\r\none of her Senators.\r\n\r\nWe were joined on this part of our journey by Carter H. Harrison,\r\nof Chicago, whose fourth term of office as mayor had just closed,\r\nand who was escorting his son and a young friend on a journey around\r\nthe world.  While waiting for the departure of the Canadian Pacific\r\nsteamer from Vancouver, he joined in this excursion through the\r\nsound.  He was a most entertaining conversationalist, and we enjoyed\r\nhis country greatly.\r\n\r\nThere was much rivalry at that time between the growing cities of\r\nSeattle and Tacoma.  At a reception in Seattle, one of the party,\r\nin responding to a call for a speech, spoke of having inquired of\r\na resident of Seattle as to the whereabouts of Mount Tacoma.  He\r\nsaid he was informed by the person to whom he applied that there\r\nwas no Mount Tacoma.  On stating that he had so understood from\r\ncitizens of Washington Territory, he was informed that there was\r\nnot then and never had been a Mount Tacoma.  The gentleman was\r\ninformed, however, that in the distance, enshrouded in the gloom\r\nof fog and smoke, there was a magnificent mountain, grand in\r\nproportion and beautiful in outline, and the mountain's name was\r\nRainier.  Later on he said he had inquired of a citizen of Tacoma\r\nas to the whereabouts, from that city, of Mount Rainier, and the\r\ngentleman, with considerable scorn on his countenance, declared\r\nthat there was no such mountain, but in a certain direction at a\r\ncertain distance was Mount Tacoma.  The gentleman closed his speech\r\nby saying, whether it was Mount Tacoma or Mount Rainier, our party\r\nwas unanimously in favor of the admission of Washington Territory\r\ninto the Union.\r\n\r\nWe visited some sawmills at Tacoma where lumber of monstrous\r\nproportions and in great quantities was being produced by a system\r\nof gang saws.  This is a wonderful industry and as long as the\r\nmaterial holds out will be a leading one of that section.  The deep\r\nwaters of Puget Sound will always offer to the industrious population\r\nof Washington ample and cheap means of transportation to the outside\r\nmarket, and I predict a great future for the state.\r\n\r\nWe returned east more hastily and with fewer stops than in the\r\nwestern journey.  We spend a night at Port Arthur, and the next\r\nday, embarking upon one of the great steamers of the Canadian\r\nPacific line, found among our fellow-passengers Goldwin Smith, the\r\ndistinguished Canadian writer and statesman.  We had a most pleasant\r\ntrip, arriving at Owen Sound without special incident; thence to\r\nToronto, and by steamer to Niagara, where we remained until the\r\nnext day, when our party separated for their several homes.  The\r\ntrip occupied exactly a month and was full of enjoyment from the\r\nbeginning to the end.\r\n\r\nAfter my return home I wrote a note to General Sherman, describing\r\nmy impressions of the country.  In this I said:\r\n\r\n\"My trip to the Pacific over the Canadian railroad was a great\r\nsuccess.  We traveled 7,000 miles without fatigue, accident or\r\ndetention.  We stopped at the chief points of interest, such as\r\nToronto, Montreal, Sudbury, Port Arthur, Winnipeg, Calgary, Banff,\r\nDonald, Glacier House, Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle and Tacoma,\r\nand yet made the round trip within the four weeks allowed.  We did\r\nnot go to Alaska, because of the fogs and for want of time.  The\r\ntrip was very instructive, giving me an inside view of many questions\r\nthat may be important in the future.  The country did not impress\r\nme as a desirable acquisition, though it would not be a bad one.\r\nThe people are hardy and industrious.  If they had free commercial\r\nintercourse with the United States, their farms, forests, and mines\r\nwould become more valuable, but at the expense of the manufactures.\r\nIf the population of Mexico and Canada were homogenous with ours,\r\nthe union of the three countries would make the whole the most\r\npowerful nation in the world.\"\r\n\r\nI then entered into the canvass.  I attended the state fair at\r\nColumbus on the 2nd of September, first visiting the Wool Growers'\r\nAssociation, and making a brief speech in respect to the change in\r\nthe duty on wool by the tariff of 1883.  I reminded the members of\r\nthat association that they were largely responsible for the action\r\nof Congress on the wool schedule, that while all the other interests\r\nwere largely represented before the committees of Congress, they\r\nwere only represented by two gentlemen, Columbus Delano and William\r\nLawrence, both from the State of Ohio, who did all they could to\r\nprevent the reduction.  Later in the day I attended a meeting of\r\nthe state grange, at which several speeches had been made.  I\r\ndisclaimed the power to instruct the gentlemen before me, who knew\r\nso much more about farming that I, but called their attention to\r\nthe active competition they would have in the future in the growth\r\nof cereals in the great plains of the west.  I described the wheat\r\nfields I had seen far west of Winnipeg, ten degrees north of us in\r\nCanada.  I said the wheat was sown in the spring as soon as the\r\nsurface could be plowed, fed by the thawing frosts and harvested\r\nin August, yielding 25 to 40 bushels to the acre, that our farms\r\nhad to compete in most of their crops with new and cheap lands in\r\nfertile regions which but a few years before were occupied by\r\nIndians and buffaloes.  \"We must diversify our crops,\" I said, \"or\r\nmake machines to work for us more and more.  New wants are created\r\nby increased population in cities.  This is one lesson of many\r\nlessons we can learn from the oldest nations in Europe.  With large\r\ncities growing up around us the farmer becomes a gardener, a demand\r\nis created for dairy products, for potatoes, and numerous articles\r\nof food which yield a greater profit.  In Germany, France and Italy\r\nthey are now producing more sugar from beets than is produced in\r\nall the world from sugar cane.  The people of the United States\r\nnow pay $130,000,000 for sugar which can easily be produced from\r\nbeets grown in any of the central states.\"  I said much more to\r\nthe same purport.\r\n\r\nI visited all parts of the state fair, and tried to avoid talking\r\npolitics, but wherever I went on the ground I found groups engaged\r\nin talking about the Toledo convention, and the prospects of\r\nRepublican or Democratic success.  I had been away so long that I\r\nsupposed the embers left by the convention were extinguished, but\r\nnothing, I think, can prevent the Ohio man from expressing his\r\nopinion about parties and politics.  I met William Lawrence, one\r\nof the ablest men of the state as a lawyer, a judge and a Member\r\nof Congress.  An interview with him had recently been published in\r\nrespect to the resolution indorsing my candidacy.  This was frequently\r\ncalled to my attention, and though I had not then read it, my\r\nconfidence in him was so great I was willing to indorse anything\r\nhe had said.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September I attended a soldiers' meeting at Bellville,\r\nin Richland county, where it was said upwards of 4,000 people took\r\npart.  I made quite a long talk to them, but was far more interested\r\nin the stories of men who had served in the war, many of whom gave\r\ngraphic accounts of scenes and incidents in which they had taken\r\npart.  I have attended many such meetings, but do not recall any\r\nthat was more interesting.  The story of the private soldier is\r\noften rich in experience.  It tells of what he saw in battle, and\r\nthese stories of the soldiers, told to each other, form the web\r\nand woof out of which history is written.  It was useless to preach\r\nto these men that Providence directly controls the history of\r\nnations.  A good Presbyterian would find in our history evidence\r\nof the truth of his theory that all things are ordained beforehand.\r\nCertain it is that the wonderful events in our national life might\r\nbe cited as an evidence of this theory.  I do reverently recognize\r\nin the history of our war, the hand of a superintending Providence\r\nthat has guided our great nation from the beginning to this hour.\r\nThe same power which guided our fathers' fathers through the\r\nRevolutionary War, upheld the arms of the soldiers of the Union\r\nArmy in the Civil War, and I trust that the same good Providence\r\nwill guide our great nation in the years to come.\r\n\r\nI made my opening political speech in this campaign at Wilmington,\r\non the 15th of September.  Clinton county is peopled almost exclusively\r\nby a farming community, whose rich upland is drained by the waters\r\nof the Scioto and Miami Rivers.  My speech, not only on this\r\noccasion, but during the canvass in other parts of the state, was\r\nchiefly confined to a defense of the Republican party and its policy\r\nwhile in power, which I contrasted with what I regarded as the\r\nfeebleness of Mr. Cleveland's administration.  I touched upon state\r\nmatters with brevity, but complimented our brilliant and able\r\ngovernor, Foraker.  I referred to the attacks that had been made\r\nupon me about my speech in Springfield, Illinois, and said that no\r\none had answered by arraignment, except by the exploded cry of \"the\r\nbloody shirt,\" or claimed that a single thing stated by me as fact\r\nwas not true.  I referred to the \"tenderfoot\" who would not hurt\r\nanyone's feelings, who would banish the word \"rebel\" from our\r\nvocabulary, who would not denounce crimes against our fellow-citizens\r\nwhen they occurred, who thought that, like Cromwell's Roundheads,\r\nwe must surrender our captured flags to the rebels who bore them,\r\nand our Grand Army boys, bent and gray, must march under the new\r\nflag, under the flag of Grover Cleveland, or not hold their camp\r\nfires in St. Louis.  In conclusion, I said:\r\n\r\n\"But I will not proceed further.  The immediate question is whether\r\nyou will renew and ratify the brilliant administration of Governor\r\nForaker, and support him with a Republican legislature.  I feel\r\nthat it is hardly necessary to appeal to the good people of Clinton\r\ncounty for an overwhelming vote in favor of a man so well known\r\nand highly respected among you, and whose associates on the state\r\nticket are among the most worthy and deserving Republicans of Ohio.\r\nI call your attention to the special importance of the election of\r\nyour candidates for senator and members of the house.  It is of\r\nvital importance to secure a Republican legislature to secure and\r\ncomplete the good work of the last.  Our success this fall by a\r\ngood majority will be a cheering preparation for the grand campaign\r\nof the next year, when we shall have an opportunity again to test\r\nthe question of whether the Republican party, which conducted\r\nseveral administrations in the most trying period of American\r\nhistory with signal success, shall be restored to power to renew\r\nthe broad national policy by which it preserved the Union, abolished\r\nslavery and advanced the republic, in strength, wealth, credit and\r\nvaried industries, to the foremost place among the nations of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of September, I made an address to the farmers\r\nof Wayne county, at Lyons, New York.  The county borders on Lake\r\nOntario.  Its surface is undulating, its soil generally fertile,\r\nand beneath are iron ore, limestone, gypsum, salt and sulphur\r\nsprings.  Its chief products are dairy and farm produce and live\r\nstock.  I said that my experience about a farm was not such as\r\nwould justify me in advising about practical farming, that I was\r\nlike many lawyers, preachers, editors and Members of Congress, who\r\ninstinctively seek to get possession of a farm, not to show farmers\r\nhow to cultivate land, but to spend a good portion of their income\r\nin a healthy recreation, that Horace Greeley and Henry Ward Beecher\r\nwere, when living, good specimens of this kind of farmer, that they\r\nall soon learned by sad experience that--\r\n\r\n  \"He that by the plow would thrive,\r\n   Himself must either hold or drive.\"\r\n\r\nI claimed to be one of the farmers whose potatoes and chickens cost\r\nmore than the market price.  Still, those engaged in professional\r\npursuits, and especially Members of Congress, have to study the\r\nstatistics of agriculture because upon the increase and diversity\r\nof its varied productions depend the wealth and progress of the\r\ncountry for which we legislate.  I will not undertake to repeat in\r\nany detail what I said.  I drew the distinction between the work\r\nof a mechanic and the work of a farmer; the mechanic had but a\r\nsingle employment and sometimes confined himself to the manufacture\r\nof a single article, but the farmer must pursue the opposite course.\r\nHe must diversify his crops each year, and the nature of his labors\r\nvaries with the seasons.  His success and profit depend upon the\r\ndiversity of his productions, and the full and constant occupation\r\nof his time.  I described what I had seen in the far-off region\r\nnear the new city of Tacoma on Puget Sound, where the chief employment\r\nof the farmer is in raising hops, and also the mode of producing\r\nwheat in the vast plains of Canada, which, now that the buffalo is\r\ngone, are plowed in the spring, sown in wheat and left unguarded\r\nand untended until ready for the great machines which cut and bind\r\nthe crop and thresh it ready for the market.  I described the\r\nproduction of the celery plant in the region of Kalamazoo, Michigan,\r\nwhere a large portion of the soil is devoted to this vegetable.\r\nAs each region varied in climate, soil and market, the occupations\r\nof farmers had to vary with the conditions that surrounded them.\r\nThe great cereals, such as wheat, corn, oats and barley, can be\r\nproduced in most parts of the United States.  Our farmers ought\r\nconstantly to diversity their crops and add to the number of their\r\nproductions.  Attention had been recently turned to the possibility\r\nof producing beet sugar in the northern states, the great obstacle\r\nbeing the cost of the factory and machinery which, to secure\r\nprofitable results, could not be erected for less than $200,000,\r\nbut I predicted that this industry would be established and sugar\r\nsufficient for our wants would be produced in our own country.  I\r\nreferred to the great advance made in the methods of farming, during\r\nthe past forty years, with the aid of new inventions of agricultural\r\nimplements and new modes of transportation, and the wonderful\r\nprogress that had been made in other fields of invention and\r\ndiscovery, and in conclusion said:\r\n\r\n\"And so in mental culture, in the knowledge of chemistry, in granges\r\nand fairs, in books, magazines and pamphlets devoted to agriculture,\r\nthe farmer of to-day has the means of information which lifts his\r\noccupation to the dignity of a science.  The good order of society\r\nnow rests upon the intelligence and conservatism of the farmers of\r\nthe United States, for to them all classes must look for safety\r\nagainst the dogmas and doctrines that threaten the social fabric,\r\nand sacred rights of persons and property, and I believe the trust\r\nwill not be in vain.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke nearly every day during the month of October, in different\r\nparts of the State of Ohio.  I do not recall a town of importance\r\nthat I did not visit, nor a congressional district in which I did\r\nnot speak.  Governor Foraker was even more active than I was.  His\r\nspeeches were received with great applause, and his manners and\r\nconduct made him popular.  The only danger he encountered was in\r\nthe active movement of the Prohibition party.  This party ran a\r\nseparate ticket, the votes of which, it was feared, would mainly\r\ncome from the Republican party.  In a speech I made at Oberlin, on\r\nthe 4th of November, I made an appeal to our Prohibition friends\r\nto support the Republican ticket.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"There are but two great parties in this country, one or the other\r\nof which is to be put in power.  You have a perfect right to vote\r\nfor the smaller Prohibition party, and thus throw away your vote,\r\nbut you know very well that either a Republican or a Democratic\r\nlegislature will be elected, and that there will not be a single\r\nProhibition candidate elected.  Will it not be better to choose\r\nbetween these two parties and give your assistance to the one that\r\nhas done the most for the success of your principles?  We think\r\nthe Republican party is still entitled, as in the past, to your\r\nhearty support.  Among other of its enactments there is the 'Dow\r\nlaw,' looked upon you with suspicion, yet it has done more for\r\ntemperance than your 'prohibition laws' at present could have done.\r\nThat law enables you to exclude the sale of liquor in more than\r\n400 Ohio towns.  It was passed by a Republican legislature.  By it\r\nmore than 3,000 saloons have been driven out of existence.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have the repeated declaration of the Republican party,\r\na party that never deceived the people with false promises, that\r\nthey will do anything else that is necessary, or all that is possible\r\nby law, to check the evils that flow from intoxicating drinks.\r\n\r\n\"Is there not a choice between that party and the Democratic party,\r\nwhich has always been the slave of the liquor party, and whose\r\nopposition to the enforcement of the Dow law cost the state\r\n$2,000,000?  The Democratic party, if put in power, will repeal\r\nthat law and will do nothing for prohibition that you will accept.\r\nThey say they want license, but they know it can never be brought\r\nabout without a change in the constitution.  They want the liquor\r\ntraffic to go unrestrained.  It does seem to me that with all the\r\nintelligence of this community it is the duty of all its candid\r\nmen, who are watching the tendencies of these two parties in this\r\ncountry, not to throw their votes away.\r\n\r\n\"It is much better to do our work by degrees, working slowly in\r\nthe right direction, than to attempt to do it prematurely by\r\nwholesale, and fail.  More men have been broken up by attempting\r\ntoo much than by 'going slow.'\r\n\r\n\"Your powerful moral influence, if kept within the Republican party,\r\nwill do more good, a thousandfold, than you can do losing your vote\r\nby casting it for a ticket that cannot be elected.  Next year will\r\npresent one of the most interesting spectacles in our history.\r\nThe Republican party will gather its hosts of progressive and\r\npatriotic citizens into one grand party at its national convention,\r\nand I trust that when that good time comes our Prohibition friends\r\nand neighbors who stand aloof from us will come back and join the\r\nold fold and rally around the old flag of our country, the stars\r\nand stripes, and help us to march on to a grand and glorious\r\nvictory.\"\r\n\r\nI closed my part of the canvass on the 5th of November, at Music\r\nHall, Cleveland, one of the finest meetings that I ever attended.\r\nGeneral E. S. Meyer and D. K. Watson shared in the speaking.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election, on the following Tuesday, gave Governor\r\nForaker a plurality of 23,329 over Thomas E. Powell, and the\r\nlegislature was Republican in both branches.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass I felt specially anxious for the election of\r\nGovernor Foraker and a Republican legislature.  Some doubts had\r\nbeen expressed by members of the Toledo convention whether the\r\nresolution favoring my nomination for President would not endanger\r\nthe election of Governor Foraker, and his defeat would have been\r\nattributed to that resolution.  I did not believe it could have\r\nthat effect, yet the fear of it led to my unusual activity in the\r\ncanvass.  I was very much gratified with the result.  Before and\r\nafter the election the general discussion was continued in the\r\nnewspapers for and against my nomination, upon the presumption that\r\nthe contest would lie between Mr. Blaine and myself.\r\n\r\nThe election in New York was adverse to the Republican party, and\r\nthis and his feeble health no doubt largely influenced Mr. Blaine\r\nin declining to be a candidate for the nomination.  Upon the surface\r\nit appeared that I would probably be the nominee, but I took no\r\nstep whatever to promote the nomination and resumed my duties in\r\nthe Senate with a firm resolve not to seek the nomination, but to\r\nrest upon the resolution adopted at Toledo.  When letters came to\r\nme, as many did, favoring my nomination, I referred them to Green\r\nB. Raum, at that time a resident in Washington, to make such answer\r\nas he thought expedient.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\nCLEVELAND'S EXTRAORDINARY MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\nFirst Session of the 50th Congress--The President's \"Cry of Alarm\"\r\n--Troubled by the Excess of Revenues over Expenditures--My Answer\r\nto His Doctrines--His Refusal to Apply the Surplus to the Reduction\r\nof the Public Debt--The Object in Doing So--My Views Concerning\r\nProtection and the Tariff--In Favor of a Tariff Commission--\"Mills\r\nBill\" the Outcome of the President's Message--Failure of the Bill\r\nDuring the Second Session--My Debates with Senator Beck on the\r\nCoinage Act of 1873, etc.--Omission of the Old Silver Dollar--Death\r\nof Chief Justice Waite--Immigration of Chinese Laborers--Controversy\r\nwith Senator Vest--Speech on the Fisheries Question--Difficulties\r\nof Annexation with Canada.\r\n\r\nThe 50th Congress convened on the 5th of December, 1887, and was\r\npromptly organized, the Senate being Republican, and the House\r\nDemocratic.  During this long session of about eleven months, nearly\r\nevery question of political or financial importance in American\r\npolitics was under discussion, and I was compelled, by my position\r\non the committees on foreign relations and finance, to take an\r\nactive part in the debates.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th the President sent to Congress his annual message, in\r\nwhich he departed from the established usage of his predecessors,\r\nwho had presented in order the subjects commented upon, commencing\r\nwith a summary of our relations with foreign nations, and extending\r\nto the business of all the varied departments of the government.\r\nInstead of this he abruptly opened with a cry of alarm, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"To the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"You are confronted, at the threshold of your legislative duties,\r\nwith a condition of the national finances which imperatively demands\r\nimmediate and careful consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThis threatening announcement of a great national danger startled\r\nthe general public, who had settled down into the conviction that\r\nall was going on very well with a Democratic administration.  The\r\nPresident said that the amount of money annually exacted largely\r\nexceeded the expenses of the government.  This did not seem so\r\ngreat a calamity.  It was rather an evidence of good times, especially\r\nas he could apply the surplus to the reduction of the national\r\ndebt.  Then we were told that:\r\n\r\n\"On the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of revenues over public\r\nexpenditures, after complying with the annual requirement of the\r\nsinking fund act, was $17,859,735.84; during the year ended June\r\n30, 1886, such excess amounted to $49,405,545.20; and during the\r\nyear ended June 30, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,567,849.54.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, we had an excess of revenue over expenditures for\r\nthree years of about $122,000,000.  The sinking fund during that\r\nthree years, as he informed us, amounted in the aggregate to\r\n$138,058,320; that is, we had stipulated by law to pay of the public\r\ndebt that sum during three years, and had been able to pay all we\r\nagreed to pay, and had $122,000,000 more.  He did not state that\r\nduring and subsequent to the panic of 1873 the United States did\r\nnot pay the sinking fund, and this deficiency was made good during\r\nthe prosperous years that followed 1879.  Upon the facts stated by\r\nhim he based his extraordinary message.  The only recommendation\r\nmade by him was a reduction of taxation.  No reference to the vast\r\ninterests intrusted to departments other than the treasury was made\r\nby him except in a brief paragraph.  He promised that as the law\r\nmakes no provision for any report from the department of state, a\r\nbrief history of the transactions of that important department\r\nmight furnish the occasion for future consideration.\r\n\r\nI have a sincere respect for President Cleveland, but I thought\r\nthe message was so grave a departure from the customary annual\r\nmessage of the President to Congress that it ought to be answered\r\nseriatim.  I did so in a carefully prepared speech.  The answer\r\nmade can be condensed in a few propositions:  An increase of revenue\r\n(the law remaining unchanged) is an evidence of unusual trade and\r\nprosperity.  The surplus revenue, whatever it might be, could and\r\nought to be applied to the reduction of the public debt.  The law\r\nunder which the debt was created provided for this, by requiring\r\na certain percentage of the debt to be paid annually, and appropriating\r\nthe surplus revenue for that purpose.  Under this policy it was\r\nestimated that the debt would be paid off prior to 1907.\r\n\r\nBut experience soon demonstrated that, whatever might be the law\r\nin force, the revenues of the government would vary from year to\r\nyear, depending, not upon rates of taxation, but upon the financial\r\ncondition of the country.  After the panic of 1873, the revenues\r\nwere so reduced that the sinking fund was practically suspended by\r\nthe fact that there was no surplus money in the treasury to meet\r\nits requirements.  At periods of prosperity the revenues were in\r\nexcess of the current expenses and the sinking fund, and in such\r\nconditions the entire surplus revenue, was applied to the reduction\r\nof the public debt and thus made good the deficiency in the sinking\r\nfund in times of financial stringency.  This was a wise public\r\npolicy, fully understood and acted upon by every Secretary of the\r\nTreasury since the close of the war and prior to Mr. Manning.\r\n\r\nAnother rule of action, founded upon the clearest public policy,\r\nhad been observed prior to the incumbency of Mr. Cleveland, and\r\nthat was not to hold in the treasury any form of money in excess\r\nof a reasonable balance, in addition to the fund held to secure\r\nthe redemption of United States notes.  All sums in excess of these\r\nwere promptly applied to the payment of the public debt, and, if\r\nnone of it was redeemable, securities of the United States were\r\npurchased in the open market.  It was the desire of Congress and\r\nevery Republican Secretary of the Treasury, in order to comply with\r\nthe sinking fund law, to apply the surplus to the gradual reduction\r\nof the debt.  While I was secretary I heartily co-operated with\r\nthe committees of Congress in reducing appropriations, and in this\r\nway was enabled to maintain the reserve, and to reduce the interest-\r\nbearing public debt.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Mr. Cleveland and Secretary Manning was to hoard in\r\nthe treasury as much of the currency of the country as possible,\r\namounting sometimes to more than $200,000,000, and this created a\r\nstringency which affected injuriously the business of the country.\r\nIt was the policy of all the early Presidents to apply any surplus\r\nrevenue either to the reduction of the public debt or to public\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, in his message of 1806, says:  \"To what object shall\r\nthe surplus be appropriated?  Shall we suppress the impost, and\r\nthus give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufacturers?\"\r\nHe believed that the patriotism of the people would \"prefer its\r\ncontinuance and application for the purpose of the public education,\r\nroads, rivers and canals.\"  This was in exact opposition to the\r\npolicy proposed by Mr. Cleveland, who refused to apply the surplus\r\nrevenue to the reduction of the debt, and in his extraordinary\r\nmessage demanded a reduction of duties on foreign goods.  A larger\r\nsurplus revenue had frequently, from time to time, been wisely\r\ndealt with by Republican administrations.  It had either been\r\napplied by the executive authorities to the payment of the public\r\ndebt, or its accumulation had been prevented by Congress, from time\r\nto time, by the reduction or repeal of taxes.  In the administration\r\nof each of Mr. Cleveland's predecessors since the close of the war,\r\nthis simple remedy had been applied without neglecting other matters,\r\nor raising a cry of alarm.  It was apparent that the object of the\r\nPresident was to force the reduction of duties on imported goods,\r\nwhich came into competition with domestic products, and that the\r\naccumulation of money in the treasury was resorted to as a means\r\nto compel such a reduction.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, 1886, I had called the attention of the Senate\r\nto the difficulty and danger of hoarding in the treasury surplus\r\nrevenue, and the readiness of the Senate to provide for the reduction\r\nof taxes and the application of the surplus.  The revenues could\r\nhave been reduced without endangering domestic industries.  At the\r\ndate of his extraordinary message both Houses of Congress were\r\nquite ready to reduce taxes.  Full authority had been given to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to apply surplus revenue to the purchase\r\nof United States bonds.  But the President, set in his opinion,\r\nwas not satisfied with such measures, but demanded the reduction\r\nof duties which protected American industries.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of my speech in reply to the President's message\r\nwas a discussion of the different forms of taxation imposed by the\r\nUnited States and especially the duties imposed on imported goods.\r\nI never was an extreme protectionist.  I believed in the imposition\r\nof such a duty on foreign goods which could be produced in the\r\nUnited States as would fairly measure the difference in the cost\r\nof labor and manufacture in this and foreign countries.  This was\r\na question not to be decided by interested capitalists, but by the\r\ncareful estimate of business men.  The intense selfishness exhibited\r\nby many of those who demanded protection, and the error of those\r\nwho opposed all protection, were alike to be disregarded.\r\n\r\nI believe that no judicious tariff can be framed by Congress alone,\r\nwithout the help of a commission of business men not personally\r\ninterested in the subject-matter, and they should be aided by\r\nexperienced officers in the revenue service.  I have participated\r\nin a greater or less degree in the framing of every tariff law for\r\nforty years.  I have spoken many times on the subject in the Senate\r\nand on the rostrum.  My reply to the President's message is the\r\nbest exposition I have made as to the principles and details of a\r\nprotective tariff.  If I had my way I would convene such a tariff\r\ncommission as I have discussed, give it ample time to hear and gain\r\nall information that could aid it, and require it to report the\r\nrates of duty proposed in separate schedules so that the rate of\r\neach schedule or paragraph might be raised or lowered from time to\r\ntime to meet the wants of the treasury.  If Congress would allow\r\nsuch a bill to become a law we could dismiss the tariff free from\r\nparty politics and lay the foundation for a durable system of\r\nnational taxation, upon which domestic industries may be founded\r\nwithout the hazard which they now encounter every year or two by\r\n\"tinkering with the tariff.\"\r\n\r\nThe real controversy raised by the President's message was not\r\nwhether taxes should be reduced, but what taxes should be reduced\r\nor abolished.  I stated the position of the two parties in a debate\r\nwith Mr. McKenna, as follows;\r\n\r\n\"There is a broad line of division between the two parties as they\r\nexist now and as they will exist in the future.  The President\r\nsays, 'retain all internal taxes and reduce the duties on imported\r\nmerchandise that comes in competition with home industries.'  We\r\nsay we will not strike down any prospering industry in this country;\r\nthat where manufactures have sprung up in our midst by aid of a\r\nduty, this protection, as you call it, we will not reduce; we will\r\nnot derange contracts, industries, or plans, or lower the prices\r\nof labor, or compel laborers or manufacturers to meet any sudden\r\nchange or emergency.  We say that we are willing to join with you\r\nin reducing the taxes.  We will select those taxes that bear most\r\nheavily upon the people, especially internal taxes, and repeal\r\nthose.  We will maintain the policy of protection by tariff duties\r\njust as long as it is necessary to give our people the benefit of\r\na home market, and diversified productions a fair chance in the\r\ntrade and commerce of our country, but we will not invite into our\r\ncountry foreign importations to compete with and break down our\r\nhome industries.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill entitled \"A bill to reduce taxation and simplify the laws\r\nin relation to the collection of the revenue,\" known as the Mills\r\nbill, was the outcome of the President's message.  It was reported\r\nto the House of Representatives by Roger Q. Mills, of Texas, and\r\nthus obtained its name.  Mr. Mills, on the 17th of April, called\r\nit up for consideration, and it was debated and amended, and passed\r\nthe House on the 21st of July, more than seven months after the\r\nPresident's cry of alarm, by the close vote of 162 yeas to 149\r\nnays.  Samuel J. Randall, then absent and sick, desired his colleague\r\nto pair him against the bill, as, if present, he would record his\r\nvote in opposition to the bill.  It came to the Senate and was\r\nreferred to the committee on finance.  On the 8th of October Mr.\r\nAllison, from that committee, reported back the Mills bill with a\r\nsubstitute for the entire bill.  This substitute was a careful and\r\nelaborate protective tariff bill, containing some provisions I did\r\nnot approve, but, in its general provisions, was, in my opinion,\r\na far better bill than the Mills bill.  The debate on these rival\r\nbills continued until the close of the session on the 19th of\r\nOctober, when the Senate, by a resolution, authorized and directed\r\nthe committee on finance to continue during the recess of Congress\r\nthe investigation of such revenue measures, including the Senate\r\nand House bills, as had been referred to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe history of the bills during the second session of this Congress\r\nis easily told.  They were debated in the Senate nearly every day\r\nuntil the 22nd of January, 1889, when the amendment of the Senate\r\nwas adopted as a substitute for the entire Mills bill, by the close\r\nvote of 32 yeas to 30 nays.  It was debated in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and referred to its committee of ways and means.\r\nIt was reported by the committee to the House of Representatives,\r\nwith a resolution declaring that the action of the Senate in\r\nsubstituting an entire bill for the House bill was in violation of\r\nthe constitution.  No action was taken on this resolution, and then\r\nall tariff legislation was defeated for that Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March, 1888, Senator Beck made a rambling speech\r\ncommencing with a fierce denunciation of a bill then pending to\r\ngrant pensions to certain disabled soldiers of the Union army.  He\r\nthen veered off on the tariff and the great trusts created by it.\r\nI ventured, in a mild-mannered way, to suggest to him a doubt\r\nwhether trusts were caused by the tariff, whether they did not\r\nexist as to domestic as well as to foreign productions.  I named\r\nto him the whisky trust, the cotton-seed trust and other trusts of\r\nthat kind, and wanted to know how these grew out of the tariff.\r\nThereupon he changed his ground and took up the silver question\r\nand commenced assailing me for the coinage act of 1873, saying I\r\nwas responsible for it.  He said it was secretly passed, surreptitiously\r\ndone, that I did it, that I knew it.\r\n\r\nI promptly replied to that charge by showing from the records that\r\nthe act referred to, and especially the part of it relating to the\r\nsilver dollar, was recommended by Mr. Boutwell, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, and all the officers connected with coinage and the\r\nmints, that it was debated at great length for three successive\r\nsessions in both Houses, that it was printed thirteen times, and\r\nthat the clause omitting the old silver dollar was especially\r\nconsidered and the policy of it fully debated, and a substitute\r\nfor the old dollar was provided for by each House.  I can say with\r\nconfidence that every Member of the Senate but Beck felt that he\r\nhad been worsted in the debate, and that the charge aimed at me,\r\nbut which equally applied to Morrill and Bayard, and especially to\r\nall the Senators from the silver states who earnestly and actively\r\nsupported the bill, was thoroughly refuted.\r\n\r\nSenator Beck, chafed by his defeat, on the 13th of March made in\r\nthe Senate a three hours' speech in support of his position.\r\nInstead of going to the public records and showing by them whether\r\nor not the law was put through the Senate in a secret way, he quoted\r\nwhat several Senators and Members said they did not know, what\r\nGrant did not know, a mode of argument that if of effect would\r\ninvalidate the great body of the legislation of Congress.\r\n\r\nI replied in a speech occupying less than half an hour, producing\r\nthe original bill as it came from the treasury department with the\r\ndollar omitted from the silver coins, with the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury calling attention to its omission, and\r\nthe opinion of Knox, LInderman, Patterson, Elliott, all of whom\r\nwere prominent officers of the treasury department in charge of\r\ncurrency and coinage, giving fully the reasons why the old silver\r\ndollar was omitted.  I also quoted from the records of each House\r\nof Congress, showing that special attention was called to the\r\nomission of the old silver dollar by Mr. Hooper, having charge of\r\nthe bill.  The House of Representatives, in compliance with the\r\nadvice of Comptroller Knox, did authorize in its bill, which it\r\npassed, a subsidiary dollar containing 384 grains of standard\r\nsilver, the same weight as two half dollars, but these dollars\r\nwere, like the subsidiary fractional coins, a legal tender for only\r\nfive dollars.  When this bill came to the Senate it was thoroughly\r\ndebated.  The legislature of California petitioned Congress for a\r\nsilver dollar weighing more than the Mexican dollar instead of the\r\nsubsidiary dollar provided for by the House.  In compliance with\r\nthis petition, the Senate so amended the bill as to authorize the\r\nowner of silver bullion to deposit the same at any mint, to be\r\nformed into bars or into dollars of the weight of 420 grains,\r\ndesignated as \"trade dollars.\"  These dollars were intended solely\r\nfor the foreign trade, and were worth in the market only the value\r\nof 420 grains of standard silver.  It was the dollar desired by\r\nthe silver producing states, and but for the rapid decline in the\r\nprice of silver, which made this dollar worth less than its face\r\nin gold, the mint would probably be coining them to-day; but before\r\nthe mint was closed to their coinage more than 35,000,000 pieces\r\nhad been made.  No unprejudiced persons could claim that the charges\r\nof Mr. Beck were not completely answered.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of March Chief Justice Waite, of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, died at his residence in Washington.  Upon the\r\n27th, upon my motion, the Senate adopted a resolution that a\r\ncommittee of five Senators be appointed by the chair, whose duty\r\nit should be to accompany the remains of the chief justice to\r\nToledo, in the State of Ohio, and attend the funeral there.  The\r\ncommittee appointed were Messrs. Sherman, Allison, Evarts, George\r\nand Gray.  They attended the funeral as directed.  Chief Justice\r\nWaite was born in Connecticut, but lived all his manhood life in\r\nToledo, Ohio, until appointed by President Grant as chief justice.\r\nHe was an able lawyer and a patient, conscientious and learned\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March I was directed by the committee on foreign\r\nrelations to report the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved by the Senate of the United States_, That, in view of\r\nthe difficulties and embarrassments that have attended the regulation\r\nof the immigration of Chinese laborers to the United States, under\r\nthe limitations of our treaties with China, the President of the\r\nUnited States be requested to negotiate a treaty with the Emperor\r\nof China, containing a provision that no Chinese laborer should\r\nenter the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a brief debate, participated in by Senators Morgan, Stewart,\r\nMitchell and others, I made a few remarks, commencing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever differences there may have been in the Senate or in the\r\ncountry, with regard to the restriction of Chinese immigration,\r\nthe time has come when I believe the general sentiment of the people\r\nis, that the law on the subject should be fairly enforced; that\r\nthe Chinese laborer should be excluded from enjoying the benefits\r\nof our country, because he will not adapt himself to the civilization\r\nof our country.  That feeling is most strongly expressed by Senators\r\nand Representatives from the Pacific coast, among whom the 100,000\r\nor more Chinese in the country live, and they have expressed that\r\nopinion to the committee on foreign relations so decidedly and\r\nunanimously, and supported by such potent reasons, that I believe\r\nevery member of that committee is of the opinion that the object\r\nof the law to exclude the immigration of Chinese laborers should\r\nbe effectively carried out.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted.\r\n\r\nDuring this Congress the question of excluding Chinese immigration\r\nby treaty and by law was pending and copiously debated.  There\r\nseemed to be a general concurrence that such immigration was not\r\ndesirable, and that Chinese coolies should be absolutely excluded.\r\nA treaty was negotiated providing for such exclusion, but, as there\r\nwas a long dely by the Chinese government in ratifying it, and the\r\ncoolies still continued to come, bills were introduced in Congress\r\nprohibiting, under severe penalties, the immigration of all Chinese\r\nlaborers.  Before the bill became a law the treaty was ratified.\r\nNow, both by treaty and by law, such immigrants are excluded, but\r\nin spite of law and treaty they still come in lessening numbers,\r\nand it does not appear how they can be entirely excluded.  I have\r\nbeen in favor of the exclusion of Chinese laborers when practically\r\nthey are slaves, but have sought to moderate the legislation\r\nproposed, so as not to disturb our friendly relations with China,\r\nor to exclude educated Chinamen engaged in commercial pursuits.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April I made a speech on a bill for the admission\r\nof Dakota, as a state, into the Union.  That territory had more\r\nthan the usual population of a new state, but its admission had\r\nbeen postponed, year after year, by the action of the Democratic\r\nparty.  This speech led to a long debate between Mr. Vest and myself\r\non the election in Louisiana in 1876.  It is not an unusual occurrence\r\nto change the subject of discussion in the Senate where debate is\r\nunlimited.  I made a long review of the events in Louisiana, mainly\r\nin reply to a question put by Mr. Vest as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have never understood, and the people of this country have never\r\nbeen able to understand, why Packard was not elected governor with\r\na larger number of votes than Hayes received for President.  But\r\nPackard was thrown out and sent as consul to Liverpool, and Hayes\r\nwas sworn in as President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied that the returning board was invested with the\r\npower to pass upon the election of electors and they did perform\r\nthat duty, but the question of the election of a governor and a\r\nlegislature of Louisiana could only be passed upon by the legislature\r\nitself, each house being the judge of its own elections, and the\r\ntwo houses, when organized, had the sole and exclusive power to\r\npass upon the election of a governor.  This condition of affairs\r\nled to a controversy which endangered the public peace and involved\r\nthe use of United States troops to prevent civil war.  President\r\nHayes thereupon had selected five gentlemen, Charles B. Lawrence,\r\nJoseph R. Hawley, John M. Harlan, John C. Brown and Wayne MacVeagh,\r\neach of whom was a man of marked distinction in the community in\r\nwhich he lived.  They were sent to Louisiana to inquire and report\r\nupon the existing condition of affairs bordering on a state of\r\ncivil war between the opposing factions.  They were instructed to\r\npromote, as far as possible, the organization of a legislature, so\r\nthat it might pass upon the question of who was governor of the\r\nstate.  The result of their inquiry led to the organization of the\r\nlegislature, and when so organized it recognized Nichols as Governor\r\nof Louisiana, as it clearly had the right to do.  The returning\r\nboard had the unquestioned right to pass upon the election of\r\nelectors for President, but it was equally clear that the legislature\r\nwas invested with the sole power of passing upon the election of\r\nthe governor.  The returning board certified to the election of\r\nthe Hayes electors, and the legislature determined that Nichols\r\nwas elected governor.  Although these decisions were inconsistent\r\nwith each other yet each was legal and binding.  I took occasion\r\nin this speech to defend the action of the returning board, and\r\nespecially the two leading members, J. Madison Wells and Thomas A.\r\nAnderson, both of whom were men of high character and standing in\r\nthat state.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this debate Vest and Butler charged me with\r\ninconsistency in my speeches at Nashville and Springfield.  This\r\nallegation had been frequently made in the newspapers of the time.\r\nIn reply I said:\r\n\r\n\"I am much obliged to my friend from Missouri for his kindness in\r\nreading extracts from my speeches.  They sound much better to me\r\nread by him than when spoken by myself.  The speeches speak for\r\nthemselves, particularly the one at Nashville.  Every word I uttered\r\non that night I utter now.  If I could repeat it over, I would add\r\nemphasis to give force and effect to it, and so I feel about the\r\nsouth.  I have not the slightest feeling of hostility against the\r\nsouth, and no desire in regard to it, except to preserve and protect\r\nthe rights of all the people of the south.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in regard to my speech at Springfield, every word of that is\r\ntrue.  Why does not the Senator dispute some fact stated in that\r\nspeech?  That was a review made to a legislature--indeed, both\r\nspeeches were made to legislative assemblies, dignified and honorable\r\nmen.  I was speaking in sight of the monument of Lincoln; I was\r\nrecalling the incidents of Lincoln's life, the period of the war,\r\nand referred, of course, to the Democratic party north and south.\r\nI could not truthfully draw a more flattering picture.  The one\r\nwas a speech as to the future to men who, I believed, were hopefully\r\nlooking forward to the disappearance of the feelings of the war.\r\nThe other was a recapitulation and review of the past.  Every word\r\nof it was true.  If the Senator can point out the inconsistency in\r\nthese speeches, he will oblige me.  There is not a single word in\r\none inconsistent with the other.  I did denounce the course of the\r\nDemocratic party north and south, during and since the war, especially\r\nin regard to the reconstruction measures.  I did, at Nashville,\r\nspeak hopefully, and I feel hopefully, of the future, but it is\r\nonly upon the basis of the recognized rights of every American\r\ncitizen.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of July I made a speech in favor of the passage of a\r\nbill for the erection of a monument to General George Rogers Clark,\r\nof the American Revolution.  His march through the wilderness and\r\nattack upon the British posts in the northwestern territory was\r\none of the most brilliant events in the Revolutionary War.  The\r\nbill passed the Senate and was reported to the House, but was not\r\nacted upon.  It is one of the obligations of honor and duty which,\r\nI trust, will be discharged by the United States before many years.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of August a message from the President, in regard to\r\nthe fishing rights of the United States, was read in the Senate.\r\nI moved that the message be referred to the committee on foreign\r\nrelations.  Before this motion was put an extended debate took\r\nplace mainly between Senators Edmunds and Morgan, though several\r\nother Senators took part.  I made a speech expressing my opinion\r\nof the President's position on the fishery question, and then took\r\noccasion to refer to the surplus in the treasury in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that the position taken by the President is a good\r\ndeal like that held by him as to the payment of the public debt.\r\nMy former old and honored colleague [Mr. Thurman] is going around\r\nthrough the country talking about surplus money in the treasury,\r\nthere accumulated all because we Republicans will not let it out.\r\nOf all the financial management that I have read or know of, the\r\nworst is that by the present administration.  Here there was an\r\naccumulating surplus in the treasury, day by day and year by year,\r\nsince the first day Mr. Cleveland entered the presidential chair.\r\nWhat did he do with that surplus revenue?  He did not make proclamation\r\nof it for two or three years, but let it accumulate and accumulate\r\nuntil he did not know what to do with it.  Finally the attention\r\nof the administration was called to the fact that they ought to\r\nbuy bonds with it.  Well, Mr. Cleveland, with his sharp construction,\r\nthought he had not the power to buy bonds; he thought he could not\r\ndo it legally.  The law confers the power upon the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"The President had no more power over it than the Senator from\r\nConnecticut before me [Mr. Platt] has.  The law confers it upon\r\nthe secretary; it was his duty to buy bonds.  What untold sums have\r\nbeen lost by his failure to comply with that law.  Until recently,\r\nduring nearly all the administration of Mr. Cleveland, the four\r\nper cent. bonds have been sold in the market about 123.  I have\r\nhere the American almanac giving the value of the four per cent.\r\nbonds during his administration, and they have usually sold at 123.\r\nIf the United States had quietly watched its opportunities in the\r\nway the present secretary's predecessors had done, he could have\r\ngone into the market and absorbed those bonds, to the amount of\r\nhalf a million or a million at a time, and bought them at the market\r\nprice, 123, and then how much money would have been saved to the\r\ngovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"My former colleague says they have over $100,000,000 of surplus.\r\nIf they had applied that one hundred million in the purchase of\r\nbonds they would have saved four per cent. per annum for three\r\nyears--that is, twelve per cent.  And besides, they would have\r\nsaved six or seven per cent. lost by the advance of bonds.  At any\r\ntime during the administration of Mr. Cleveland, if his Secretary\r\nof the Treasury had exercised the power conferred on him by the\r\nlaw, he might have saved the government of the United States from\r\ntwelve to sixteen per cent. on the whole hundred million of dollars,\r\nif he had invested it in bonds of the United States.  But he would\r\nnot do it because he had not the power.  So the President sent to\r\nCongress and asked for power, just as he has done in this case,\r\nwhen he had ample power, and both Houses declared unanimously that\r\nhe had the power, and then, after the bonds had gone up to 127 or\r\n128, when he had lost three years' interest on a large portion of\r\nthis accumulation, he commenced to buy bonds and complains that\r\nthey are too high, and that he calls wise financial management.\r\n\r\n\"So now here is a law, on the statute book for over a year, to\r\nenforce a demand on the Canadian authorities that our fishermen,\r\nwho are there carrying on their hazardous enterprise, should have\r\nthe right to enter the port of Halifax and ship their goods under\r\nthe plain provisions of the treaty or the law, and, if that right\r\nwas denied, then here was the law expressly prepared for the\r\nparticular case, to authorize the President not to do any violent\r\nact of retaliation, not to involve us in any dangerous or delusive\r\nmeasure which would excite the public mind and probably create\r\nanimosities between these two great countries.  But suppose he had\r\nsimply said:  'Well, if you deny to the Yankee fishermen the right\r\nto transship their fish, we deny you the right to bring fresh fish\r\ninto Maine, Boston, and New York, and scatter them all over, cured\r\nby ice,' for that is the effect of it--ice takes the place of salt.\"\r\n\r\nMy allusion to the finances as usual excited the ire of Mr. Beck,\r\nwho said:\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Ohio gets away from the treaty and talks about\r\nthis administration not buying bonds and how much we could have\r\nsaved because they have raised the price; but I want to say that\r\nhe himself was the man, both as Secretary of the Treasury and as\r\nchairman of the committee on finance, who arranged our debts in\r\nsuch a way that we could not pay them.\"\r\n\r\nIn my reply I again called attention to the fact that the House,\r\nof which Mr. Beck was a Member at the time of the passage of the\r\nfour per cent. bond bill, and not the Senate, was responsible for\r\nthe long period of the bonds.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Kentucky says I am responsible for the fact that\r\nthere is the prolonged period of thirty years to the four per cent.\r\nbonds.  He knows, because he was here the other day when I showed\r\nfrom the public record, that the Senate of the United States proposed\r\nto pass a bill to issue bonds running only twenty years, with the\r\nright of redemption after ten years; and if the law had been passed\r\nin that form in which it was sent from the Senate none of this\r\ntrouble would have existed; but it was changed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, of which the Senator from Kentucky was then a\r\nMember.  I believe he voted for the House proposition against the\r\nSenate proposition, by which the time was extended to thirty years,\r\nand they were not redeemable during that time.  Yet I am charged\r\nwith the responsibility of lengthening these bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever my sins, I can claim to have always favored the right to\r\nredeem the bonds of the United States as the 5-20's and the 10-40's\r\nwere issued to be redeemed; and if I had had my way we would have\r\nhad the same kind of bonds issued instead of the thirty-year bonds.\"\r\n\r\nThe relation of Canada with the United States, especially in\r\nconnection with the fisheries, became at this period dangerously\r\nstrained.  This led me, on the 18th of September, to offer in the\r\nSenate the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the committee on foreign relations be directed\r\nto inquire into, and report at the next session of Congress, the\r\nstate of the relations of the United States with Great Britain and\r\nthe Dominion of Canada, with such measures as are expedient to\r\npromote friendly commercial and political intercourse between these\r\ncountries and the United States, and for that purpose have leave\r\nto sit during the recess of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of this resolution I said in opening:\r\n\r\n\"The recent message of the President recommending a line of\r\nretaliation against the Dominion of Canada involves the consideration\r\nof our relations with that country in a far more important and\r\ncomprehensive way than Congress has ever before been called upon\r\nto give.  The recent treaty rejected by the Senate related to a\r\nsingle subject, affecting alone our treaty rights on her northeastern\r\ncoast.  The act of retaliation of 1887 was confined to the same\r\nsubject-matter.  This message, however, treats of matters extending\r\nacross the continent, affecting commercial relations with every\r\nstate and territory on our northern boundary.  Under these\r\ncircumstances I feel it is my duty to present my views of all these\r\ncognate subjects, and in doing so I feel bound to discard, as far\r\nas possible, all political controversy, for in dealing with foreign\r\nrelations, and especially those with our nearest neighbor, we should\r\nthink only of our country and not of our party.\"\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty of dealing with Canada is its dependence on\r\nGreat Britain.  Our negotiations must be with the English government,\r\nwhile the matters complained of are purely Canadian, and the consent\r\nof Canada is necessary to the ratification of any treaty.  The\r\nPresident complained that Canadian authorities and officers denied\r\nto our fishermen the common privileges freely granted to friendly\r\nnations to enter their ports and harbors, to purchase supplies and\r\ntransship commodities.  He said that they subjected our citizens,\r\nengaged in fishing enterprises in waters adjacent to their northeastern\r\nshore, to numerous vexatious interferences and annoyances, had\r\nseized and sold their vessels upon slight pretexts, and had otherwise\r\ntreated them in a rude, harsh, and oppressive manner.  He further\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"This conduct has been justified by Great Britain and Canada, by\r\nthe claim that the treaty of 1818 permitted it, and upon the ground\r\nthat it was necessary to the proper protection of Canadian interests.\r\nWe deny that treaty agreements justify these acts, and we further\r\nmaintain that, aside from any treaty restraints, of disputed\r\ninterpretation, the relative positions of the United States and\r\nCanada as near neighbors, the growth of our joint commerce, the\r\ndevelopment and prosperity of both countries, which amicable\r\nrelations surely guaranty, and, above all, the liberality always\r\nextended by the United States to the people of Canada, furnished\r\nmotives for kindness and consideration higher and better than treaty\r\ncovenants.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed with the President in his arraignment of the Canadian\r\nauthorities for denying to our fishing vessels the benefit of the\r\nenlightened measures adopted in later years by commercial nations,\r\nespecially by the United States and Great Britain.  We admitted\r\nfish free of duty into our country, while Canada refused to our\r\nfishermen the right to purchase bait and other supplies in Canadian\r\nports, thus preventing our fishermen from competing with the\r\nCanadians on the open sea.  The President undertook, by treaty, to\r\ncorrect this injustice, but the Senate thought that the provisions\r\nof the treaty were not adequate for that purpose, and declined to\r\nratify it.  He thereupon recommended that Congress provide certain\r\nmeasures of retaliation, which, in the opinion of the Senate, would\r\nhave inflicted greater injury to the United States than to Canada.\r\nThis honest difference of opinion, not based upon party lines,\r\nopened up the consideration of all our commercial relations with\r\nCanada.  The speech made by me dealt with the policy of the United\r\nStates with Canada in the past and for the future, and led me to\r\nthe expression of my opinion that Canada should be, and would be,\r\nrepresented in the parliament of Great Britain or the Congress of\r\nthe United States, with the expression of my hope of its being\r\nannexed to our country.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"And now I submit if the time has not come when the people of the\r\nUnited States and Canada should take a broader view of their\r\nrelations to each other than has heretofore seemed practicable.\r\nOur whole history, since the conquest of Canada by Great Britain\r\nin 1763, has been a continuous warning that we cannot be at peace\r\nwith each other except by a political as well as commercial union.\r\nThe fate of Canada should have followed the fortunes of the colonies\r\nin the American Revolution.  It would have been better for all,\r\nfor the mother country as well, if all this continent north of\r\nMexico had participated in the formation, and shared in common the\r\nblessings and prosperity of the American Union.\r\n\r\n\"So, evidently, our fathers thought, for among the earliest military\r\nmovements by the Continental Congress was the expedition for the\r\noccupation of Canada, and the capture of the British forces in\r\nMontreal and Quebec.  The story of the failure of the expedition,\r\nthe heroism of Arnold and Burr, the death of Montgomery, and the\r\nfearful suffering borne by the Continental forces in the march and\r\nretreat, is familiar to every student of American history.  The\r\nnative population of Canada were then friendly to our cause, and\r\nhundreds of them, as refugees, followed our retiring forces and\r\nshared in the subsequent dangers and triumphs of the war.  It was\r\nthe earnest desire of Franklin, Adams, and Jay, at the treaty of\r\npeace, to secure the consent of Great Britain to allow Canada to\r\nform a part of the United States, and at one time it appeared\r\npossible, but for the influence of France and Spain, then the\r\nacknowledged sovereigns of large parts of the territory now included\r\nwithin the United States.  The present status of Canada grew out\r\nof the activities and acquisitions of European powers after the\r\ndiscovery of this continent.  Spain, France, and England especially\r\ndesired to acquire political jurisdiction over this newly discovered\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Without going into the details so familiar to the Senate, it is\r\nsufficient to say that Spain held Florida, France held all west of\r\nthe Mississippi, Mexico held Texas west to the Pacific, and England\r\nheld Canada.  The United States held, subject to the Indian title,\r\nonly the region between the Mississippi and the Atlantic.  The\r\nstatesmen of this government early discerned the fact that it was\r\nimpossible that Spain, France, and Mexico should hold the territory\r\nthen held by them without serious detriment to the interests and\r\nprosperity of the United States, and without the danger that was\r\nalways present of conflicts with the European powers maintaining\r\ngovernments in contiguous territory.  It was a wise policy and a\r\nnecessity to acquire these vast regions and add them to this country.\r\nThey were acquired and are now held.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely the same considerations apply to Canada, with greater\r\nforce.  The commercial conditions have vastly changed within twenty-\r\nfour years.  Railroads have been built across the continent in our\r\nown country and in Canada.  The seaboard is of such a character,\r\nand its geographical situation is such on both oceans, that perfect\r\nfreedom as to transportation is absolutely essential, not only to\r\nthe prosperity of the two countries, but to the entire commerce of\r\nthe world; and as far as the interests of the two people are\r\nconcerned, they are divided by a mere imaginary line.  They live\r\nnext door neighbors to each other, and there should be a perfect\r\nfreedom of intercourse between them.\r\n\r\n\"A denial of that intercourse, or the withholding of it from them,\r\nrests simply and wholly upon the accident that a European power,\r\none hundred years ago, was able to hold that territory against us;\r\nbut her interest has practically passed away and Canada has become\r\nan independent government to all intents and purposes, as much so\r\nas Texas was after she separated herself from Mexico.  So that all\r\nthe considerations that entered into the acquisition of Florida,\r\nLouisiana, and the Pacific coast and Texas, apply to Canada, greatly\r\nstrengthened by the changed condition of commercial relations and\r\nmatters of transportation.  These intensify not only the propriety,\r\nbut the absolute necessity, of both a commercial and a political\r\nunion between Canada and the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis was my opinion then, but further reflection convinces me that\r\nthe annexation of Canada to the United States presents serious\r\ndifficulties, and that the best policy for the other English-speaking\r\ncountries is that Canada should constitute an independent republic,\r\nfounded upon the model of the United States, with one central\r\ngovernment, and provinces converted into states with limited powers\r\nfor local governments.  The United States already embraces so vast\r\na country, divided into forty-four states and four territories,\r\nexclusive of Alaska and the Indian Territory, that any addition to\r\nthe number of states would tend to weaken the system, and the\r\nconversion of the provinces of Canada into states of our Union\r\nwould introduce new elements of discord, while with Canada as an\r\nindependent and friendly republic we could, by treaties or concurrent\r\nlegislation, secure to each the benefit of free trade and intercourse\r\nwith the other, and without the danger of weakening the United\r\nStates.  Great Britain, the common mother of both republics, could\r\ntake pride in her progeny and be relieved from the cares and\r\ncontroversies that have arisen and will arise in her guardianship\r\nof Canada.  Her policy in recent years has been to surrender, as\r\nmuch as possible, her legislative power over Canada, but, as Canada\r\nis not represented in parliament and cannot be represented by a\r\nminister at Washington, the spectacle of a British minister of the\r\nhighest rank engaged in an effort to negotiate a treaty for the\r\nbenefit of Canada about bait and fish and fisheries, imposing\r\nrestrictions of trade in direct opposition to the policy of the\r\nmother country.  This condition of Canada constantly invites a\r\nbreach of the peace between the United States and Great Britain,\r\nbut with Canada governed by a parliament and by local assemblies in\r\nthe provinces on a plan similar to our own, the two republics would\r\nbe independent of each other, and could arrange their matters\r\nwithout any other country to interfere.\r\n\r\nThere were many other measures of interest and importance in the\r\ndiscussing and framing of which I participated at this session,\r\nbut as this is not a general history of Congress, I do not deem it\r\nnecessary to mention them in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION OF 1888.\r\nMajority of the Ohio Delegates Agree to Support Me for President--\r\nCleveland and Thurman Nominated by the Democrats--I Am Indorsed by\r\nthe State Convention Held at Dayton, April 18-19--My Response to\r\na Toast at the Americus Club, Pittsburg, on Grant--Meeting with\r\nProminent Men in New York--Foraker's Reply to Judge West's Declaration\r\nConcerning Blaine--Blaine's Florence Letter to Chairman Jones--His\r\nOpinion of My Qualifications for the Honorable Position--Meeting\r\nof the Convention in Chicago in June--I Am Nominated by General D.\r\nH.

It was settled early in the year that a large\r\nmajority of the delegates from Ohio would support me for President,\r\nand several weeks before the convention was held it was announced\r\nthat I would receive the unanimous support of the delegates from\r\nOhio.  The Democratic party nominated Grover Cleveland and Allen\r\nG. Thurman for President and Vice President.\r\n\r\nThe Republican state convention was held at Dayton, Ohio, on the\r\n18th and 19th of April, and selected Foraker, Foster, McKinley and\r\nButterworth as delegates at large to the national convention.\r\nForty-two delegates were nominated by the twenty-one districts,\r\nand all of them were known to favor my nomination.  The convention\r\nunanimously adopted this resolution:\r\n\r\n\"Seventh.  The Republicans of Ohio recognize the merits, services\r\nand abilities of the statesmen who have been mentioned for the\r\nRepublican nomination for the presidency, and, loyal to anyone who\r\nmay be selected, present John Sherman to the country as eminently\r\nqualified and fitted for the duties of that exalted office, and\r\nthe delegates to the Republican national convention this day selected\r\nare directed to use all honorable means to secure his nomination\r\nas President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe speeches made at the convention by the delegates at large, and\r\nby other members, expressed without qualification the hearty and\r\nunanimous support of my nomination.  The condition upon which alone\r\nI would become a candidate for so exalted a position as President\r\nof the United States had been complied with, and I therefore felt\r\nthat I might fairly aspire to the nomination.  Mr. Blaine had\r\ndeclined it on account of his health, and no one was named who had\r\na longer record of public service than I had.\r\n\r\nThe movement for my nomination was heartily indorsed by the people\r\nof Ohio and was kindly received in the different states.  Many of\r\nthe leading newspapers assumed that it was assured.  Sketches of\r\nmy life, full of errors, appeared.  My old friend, Rev. S. A.\r\nBronson, issued a new edition of his \"Life of John Sherman.\"\r\nComments favorable and unfavorable, some of them libelous, appeared\r\nin print.  Mrs. Sherman, much more sensitive than I of calumny,\r\nbegged me not to be a candidate, as the office of President had\r\nkilled Lincoln and Garfield, and the effort to attain it had broken\r\ndown Webster, Clay and Blaine, and would do the same with me.\r\nHowever, I remained at my duties in Washington as calmly awaiting\r\nthe action of the Chicago convention as any one of my associates\r\nin the Senate.  I read the daily reports of what was to be--\"that\r\nI was to be nominated on the first ballot,\" and \"that I had no\r\nchance whatever,\" and became alike indifferent as to the one or\r\nthe other result.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Ohio convention, I was invited to attend a banquet\r\nof the Americus club at the Monongahela House, in Pittsburg, on\r\nthe 28th of April, at which Senator Harrison and Colonel Fred.\r\nGrant were guests.  The lobby of the hotel looked as if a political\r\nconvention was in session, many prominent men from Pennsylvania\r\nand other states being present.\r\n\r\nAt the banquet I was called upon to respond to the toast \"Grant;\r\nHe Was Great to the End.\"  I insert a portion of my remarks:\r\n\r\n\"I saw General Grant when he arrived in Washington.  He soon took\r\ncommand of the Army of the Potomac.  His plan of campaign was soon\r\nformed.  His objective point was Lee's army.  Where Lee went he\r\nwent, and if Lee moved too slowly Grant flanked him.  After the\r\nfearful and destructive battles of the Wilderness, Washburne wanted\r\nto carry some consoling message to Lincoln, and Grant wrote 'I\r\npropose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.'  And\r\nso he did, and all winter.  He never loosed his tenacious grip of\r\nLee's army until Lee surrendered at Appomattox.  If you ask me the\r\nsecret of his success I say tenacity, tenacity.  He never was\r\ndiscouraged.  He knew how to hold on.  And when his object was\r\nattained, and not till then, he knew how to be generous.\r\n\r\n\"He carried the same traits into civil life.  He was always the\r\nsame plain, simple, confiding, brave, tenacious and generous man\r\nin war and peace, as when the leader of vast armies, President of\r\nthe United States, the guest of kings and emperors, and in his\r\nfinal struggle with grim-visaged death.  Gentlemen, you do right\r\nto commemorate his birthday.  It was his good fortune to be the\r\nchief instrument of Divine Power to secure to you and your posterity\r\nthe blessing of a free, strong and united country.  He was heroic\r\nto the end, and you should be equally heroic in maintaining and\r\npreserving the rights and privileges and policy for which he\r\ncontended.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I deem it an honor to be called upon by your club, on this sixty-\r\nsixth anniversary of the birthday of General Grant, to present in\r\nbrief words this typical American citizen, this illustrious soldier,\r\nthis patriotic President.  By his tenacious courage and skill the\r\narmies of the Union were led from victory to victory, from Belmont\r\nto Appomattox, until every enemy of the republic laid down his arms\r\nin unconditional surrender.  He won from foreign nations reparation\r\nfor injuries done to us during the war.  He did more than anyone\r\nelse to preserve untarnished the public credit and honor.  Heroic\r\nto the end, in the hours of death he won his greatest victory by\r\nthe story of his life, told in words so plain, truthful, charitable\r\nand eloquent that it will become as classic as the commentaries of\r\nCaesar, but more glorious as the record of a patriot who saved his\r\ncountry, instead of a conqueror who overthrew its liberties.  When\r\nspeaking of General Grant I do not know where to begin and where\r\nto end, whether with his personal traits of character, his achievements\r\nas a commander of armies, or his services as an untried magistrate\r\nin civil life; I can only make a mere reference to each of these\r\nelements of his fame.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the month of May I remained in Washington, and\r\nattended constantly the sessions of the Senate.  I was greatly\r\ninterrupted by visits of persons from different parts of the country,\r\nwho wished to converse with me in regard to the approaching\r\nconvention.  I treated them kindly, but referred them to General\r\nRaum for any information he could give them.  I was called to New\r\nYork on the 8th of June, to attend a meeting of the directors of\r\nthe Fort Wayne Railway Company.  I stopped at the Fifth Avenue\r\nhotel, where great numbers of politicians called upon me, but I\r\nwas charged with having interviews with many persons whom I did\r\nnot see.  I met the leading politicians of the state, including ex-\r\nSenator Platt, Senators Hiscock and Quay, Charles Emory Smith, of\r\nPhiladelphia, and many others.  The newspapers had a good many\r\nalleged interviews which never occurred.  I then became satisfied\r\nthat I would not probably receive more than five or six of the\r\nvotes of the New York delegation, as they had generally committed\r\nthemselves to Mr. Depew, who was understood to be a candidate.\r\n\r\nIt was already asserted in the papers that I would not be nominated,\r\nbut that Blaine would be, in spite of his declination in his Florence\r\nand Paris letters.  Among others, this was asserted by Judge West,\r\nof Ohio.  Governor Foraker, who was at the head of the Ohio delegation\r\nto Chicago, was reported to have said in reply to West:\r\n\r\n\"I do not attach much importance to Judge West's recent speech.\r\nHe is not a delegate this year, and he only speaks for himself.\r\nMr. Sherman will have the united and hearty support of the delegates\r\nfrom this state, and I think his nomination is reasonably assured.\r\nI received a letter from him yesterday in which he expressed himself\r\nas being very confident of getting the nomination.  It certainly\r\nlooks that way to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you account for the circulation of the reports that you\r\nare not entirely loyal to Sherman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they originated in the breasts of mischief-makers who\r\nwould like to make trouble.  There never was the slightest foundation\r\nfor them.  I have paid no heed to them, for if my character is not\r\nsufficiently established in this state to make my attitude towards\r\nMr. Sherman perfectly clear, nothing I could say would alter the\r\nsituation.  It has been practically settled that General Hastings,\r\nthe adjutant general of Pennsylvania, will present Mr. Sherman's\r\nname to the convention.  He is an excellent speaker, and will, no\r\ndoubt, acquit himself with credit.  Yes, I shall probably make the\r\nspeech seconding his nomination from this state.  It is customary,\r\nI believe, to have a candidate presented by a delegate from some\r\nother state than his own, and in Sherman's case it seems eminently\r\nproper that he should be presented in this way, as he is in such\r\na broad sense a national candidate.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a common opinion prevailing that the relations of Blaine\r\nand myself were not friendly.  This was a grave mistake.  We had\r\nnever had any controversy of a personal character.  He had spoken\r\nof me in terms of the highest eulogy in his book \"Twenty Years of\r\nCongress,\" in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"It seldom happens that the promoter of a policy in Congress has\r\nan opportunity to carry it out in an executive department.  But\r\nMr. Sherman was the principal advocate of the resumption bill in\r\nthe Senate, and during the two critical years preceding the day\r\nfor coin payment he was at the head of the treasury department.\r\nHe established a financial reputation not second to that of any\r\nman in our history.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to our state convention, while Mr. Blaine was abroad, I wrote\r\nto a friend of his, who was with him, that if Blaine desired to be\r\na candidate I would withdraw and advocate his nomination.  This\r\nletter was handed to Murat Halstead, who was about to proceed to\r\nEurope.  He showed it to Blaine, who insisted that he could not\r\nand would not be a candidate, and wrote a letter to B. F. Jones,\r\nchairman of the Republican national committee, in which he stated,\r\nin terms that could not be mistaken, his position in regard to the\r\npresidency, and settled for good the question of his candidacy.\r\nIn neither of his previous epistles did he state positively he\r\nwould not accept the nomination if tendered him.  In the letter to\r\nChairman Jones this declaration was most emphatically made.  Under\r\nno circumstances, Mr. Blaine said, would he permit the use of his\r\nname in Chicago, nor would he accept a presidential nomination\r\nunanimously tendered him.  He further went on to say that Senator\r\nJohn Sherman was his preference, and advised the convention to\r\nplace his name at the head of the Republican national ticket.\r\n\r\nMr. Halstead said to a correspondent of the New York \"World,\" in\r\nregard to Mr. Blaine's position, that he had achieved the greatest\r\nplace in our political history--above that of Henry Clay--that the\r\nnomination would have come to him unsought, but he had smothered\r\nany personal ambition he may have had for the good of his party.\r\nMr. Blaine's name, he declared, would not come before the Chicago\r\nconvention as a candidate in any contingency we have a right to\r\nassume.  \"Mr. Blaine told me,\" he said, \"when I met him in Europe\r\nin August last, that he was not a Tichborne claimant for the\r\npresidency, and he wanted his friends to understand it.  Mr. Blaine\r\nwill have as distinguished a place in history as he could have\r\nobtained had he been elected to the presidency.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was asked:  \"Do you think Mr. Sherman could be elected?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied:  \"Mr. Sherman represents the principles of the Republican\r\nparty from its beginning.  He has never wavered in his allegiance\r\nto the party.  If we cannot elect a man on the principles of the\r\nRepublican party we will not be able to pull anyone through on\r\npersonal popularity.  I think Mr. Sherman is as strong as the\r\nRepublican party, and that if nominated he can be elected, and also\r\nthat he has great personal strength.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the question, \"Will the Ohio delegates remain true to\r\nSherman?\" Mr. Blaine said:  \"Of that there can be no doubt.  They\r\nare riveted and double-bolted to him.  The talk of Foraker's scheming\r\nfor himself is nonsense and malice.  Foraker is a young man and\r\nhas a great future before him.  He may go to the Senate and be\r\nPresident later on.  No, the Garfield miracle cannot be repeated\r\nthis year.  It is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention met at Chicago on the 19th of June.  The delegation\r\nfrom Ohio was promptly in attendance, and was to all appearances\r\nunited, and determined to carry out the instructions and requests\r\nof the state convention to support my nomination.  There appeared\r\nto be some needless delay in the report of the committee on\r\nresolutions.  Mr. McKinley, as chairman of the committee, reported\r\nthe resolutions and they were unanimously adopted by the convention\r\nby a standing vote amid great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nI was nominated by General D. H. Hastings, of Pennsylvania, in a\r\nspeech of remarkable power and eloquence.  When he closed, enthusiastic\r\nand prolonged cheering and waving of flags greeted him from the\r\ngalleries, which was joined in my many delegations.\r\n\r\nGovernor Foraker seconded the nomination.  His opening words were:\r\n\"Ohio is sometimes like New York.  She occasionally comes to a\r\nnational Republican convention divided as to her choice for the\r\npresidency, and sometimes she comes united.  She has so come on\r\nthis occasion.  Her forty-six delegates are here to speak as one\r\nman.\"  His speech throughout was received with great applause, and\r\nit and that of General Hastings were regarded as the most eloquent\r\nnominating addresses of the convention.  They were followed by\r\nspeeches made by John M. Langston, of Virginia, and Mr. Anson, of\r\nNorth Carolina.  There certainly could be no fault found with either\r\nthe manner or the matter of these addresses.\r\n\r\nThere was a constant effort made to produce jealousy between the\r\nmembers of the Ohio delegation, and perhaps it may be admitted that\r\nthe natural divisions in a body of forty-six members would give rise\r\nto suspicion and misunderstanding, but I have no right to complain\r\nof anything done by the members of the delegation during the\r\nconvention.  There was a natural rivalry between Foraker and\r\nMcKinley, as they were both young, able and eloquent men.  Rumors\r\nprevailed at times that the Ohio delegation could be held solid no\r\nlonger, but if there was any ground for these rumors it did not\r\ndevelop into a breach, as the delegation, from beginning to end,\r\ncast the entire vote of Ohio for me on every ballot except the last\r\ntwo or three, when one of the delegates, J. B. Luckey, voted for\r\nHarrison, placing his action on the ground that he had served with\r\nhim in the army and felt bound to vote for him.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening I was telegraphed by different persons that I\r\nwould certainly be nominated on Monday.  That was the confident\r\nbelief in Washington.  On Sunday the following dispatch was published,\r\nwhich, though I do not recall any such conversation, expresses my\r\nfeeling on that day:\r\n\r\n\"Senator Sherman says he does not believe that Foraker, or any\r\nother Ohio man, will desert him.  He spent three hours Sunday at\r\nthe capitol, in his committee room, and received many telegrams\r\nfrom Chicago, and also sent dispatches to that great central point\r\nof interest.  He has received some unauthorized dispatches advising\r\nhim to withdraw in favor of McKinley, but he refuses absolutely to\r\ninterfere with his managers.  His invariable answer to all advising\r\nhim to pull out is that he is in the fight to stay.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 25th of June, I did not anticipate a change on the\r\nfirst ballot from the last one on Saturday.  I did expect, from my\r\ndispatches, that the nomination would be made that day and in my\r\nfavor, but, as the result proved, an arrangement had been made on\r\nSunday that practically secured the nomination of General Harrison.\r\nThis became obvious in the course of the vote on Monday and, as\r\nHarrison was practically assured of the nomination, Pennsylvania\r\nvoted solid for him and ended the contest.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information I could gather from many persons with\r\nwhom I conversed, I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion\r\nthat I was defeated for the nomination by New York.  I was assured\r\nbefore the meeting of the convention that I would have six votes\r\nfrom the beginning from that state, and could reasonably hope for\r\na large addition to that vote in the progress of the balloting.\r\nInstead of this I did not receive a single vote, although three or\r\nmore of the delegates had been distinctly selected in my favor and\r\nhad given pledges to their constituents that they would vote for\r\nme, but they did not on a single ballot do so, except I was advised\r\nthat at one ballot one of them voted for me.\r\n\r\nI believed then, as I believe now, that one of the delegates from\r\nthe State of New York practically controlled the whole delegation,\r\nand that a corrupt bargain was made on Sunday which transferred\r\nthe great body of the vote of New York to General Harrison, and\r\nthus led to his nomination.  It is to the credit of General Harrison\r\nto say that if the reputed bargain was made it was without his\r\nconsent at the time, nor did he carry it into execution.\r\n\r\nI believe and had, as I thought, conclusive proof that the friends\r\nof General Alger substantially purchased the votes of many of the\r\ndelegates from the southern states who had been instructed by their\r\nconventions to vote for me.\r\n\r\nThere were eight ballots taken in the convention, in all of which\r\nI had a large plurality of the votes until the last one.\r\n\r\nWhen General Harrison was nominated I assured him of my hearty\r\nsupport.  I have no respect for a man who, because he is disappointed\r\nin his aspirations, turns against the party to which he belongs.\r\nI believe that both honor and duty require prompt and ready\r\nacquiescence in the choice made, unless it is produced by corruption\r\nand fraud.\r\n\r\nI had no reason to believe, however, that General Harrison resorted\r\nin the slightest degree to any improper or corrupt combination to\r\nsecure his nomination.  In answer to a letter from me expressing\r\nmy congratulations and tendering my support, I received from him\r\na very cordial reply, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Indianapolis, July 9, 1888.\r\n\"My Dear Senator:--Your very frank and kind letter of June 30th\r\nhas remained unanswered so long only because it was impossible for\r\nme to get time to use the pen myself.  Some friends were asking\r\n'have you heard from Sherman,' and my answer always was, 'have no\r\nconcern about him.  His congratulations and assurances of support\r\nwill not be withheld, and they will not be less sincere than the\r\nearlier and more demonstrative expressions from other friends.'\r\nYou will recall our last conversation at Pittsburg, in which I very\r\nsincerely assured you that except for the situation of our state\r\nmy name would not be presented at Chicago in competition with yours.\r\nI have always said to all friends that your equipment for the\r\npresidency was so ample and your services to the party so great\r\nthat I felt there was a sort of inappropriateness in passing you\r\nby for any of us.  I absolutely forbade my friends making any\r\nattempt upon the Ohio delegation, and sent word to an old army\r\ncomrade in the delegation that I hoped he would stand by you to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n\"I shall very much need your service and assistance, for I am an\r\ninexperienced politician as well as statesman.  My desire is to\r\nhave a Republican campaign and not a personal one, and I hope a\r\ngood start will be made in that direction in the organization of\r\nthe committee.  I have not and shall not attempt to dictate the\r\norganization, but have made some very general suggestions.  I will\r\nconfidently hold you to your promise to give me frankly any\r\nsuggestions that you may think valuable, and assure you that\r\ncriticism will always be kindly received.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Harrison joins me in kind regards to Mrs. Sherman.\r\n\r\n  \"Very sincerely your friend,\r\n  \"Benj. Harrison.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, U. S. Senate.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad to see you when you come.\"\r\n\r\nI had many letters from him during the canvass and gave him a hearty\r\nand I think effective support.  After his election he wrote me the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Indianapolis, Ind., November 22, 1888.\r\n\"Hon. John Sherman, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Senator:--You will understand, without any explanation\r\nfrom me, that my little home bureau was entirely inadequate to deal\r\nwith the immense flood of telegrams and letters that poured in upon\r\nme after the election.  It has happened, that some of those that\r\nshould have had earliest attention have been postponed, by reason\r\nof the fact that the associated press carried off the telegrams\r\nand they were not returned for some times.  But you did not need\r\nto be assured that I appreciate very highly your friendly words,\r\nand rely implicitly upon that friendly spirit that has not only\r\nprompted them, but so much besides that was useful to me.\r\n\r\n\"I have, up to this time, given my whole attention to visiting\r\nfriends and to my correspondence with those who have addressed me\r\nby wire or mail.  We are just now torn up a little in our household\r\nby reason of the work necessary to introduce the natural gas; but\r\nwill after a little while be settled again.  I wish that you would\r\nfeel that I desire you to deal with me in the utmost frankness,\r\nwithout any restraints at all, and in the assurance that all you\r\nmay say will be kindly received and will have the weight which your\r\nlong experience in public life and your friendship for me entitles\r\nit to.  I know the embarrassments that now attend any intercourse\r\nwith my friends, on their part, rather than on mine; but you will\r\nfind some method of communicating with me if you desire, and after\r\nawhile I will have the pleasure of a personal conference.  With\r\nkind regards to Mrs. Sherman, I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n  \"Benj. Harrison.\"\r\n\r\nI sent him the following answer:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., November 26, 1888.\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 22nd is received.  I appreciate the\r\nembarrassments of your position and feel that the highest mark of\r\nfriendship is to let you alone, and have therefore refrained from\r\nwriting to or visiting you.  Still I wish you to feel that I have\r\nno hope or ambition higher than to see your administration a complete\r\nsuccess.  The victory is a Republican victory and that I think is\r\na victory for the whole country.  Any advice or aid I can give will\r\nbe freely rendered on call, but not tendered until needed.  I notice\r\nthat every scribbler is making a cabinet for you, but your observation\r\nmust have led you to the conviction that this is a duty you only\r\ncan perform.  Advice in this matter is an impertinence.  Your\r\ncomfort and success will largely depend upon this, and if I were\r\nto offer advice it would be to consult alone your own judgment,\r\ntaking care to choose those who above all will be faithful and\r\nhonorable to you and administer the patronage of the departments,\r\nnot in their own selfish interests, but for the good of the country.\r\nThe cabinet should be fairly distributed among the different\r\nsections, but this is not the prime necessity, nor is it vital that\r\ncliques or factions be represented, but only the general average\r\nof Republican ideas and policy.\r\n\r\n\"As to the broader questions of public policy the rule of action\r\nis very different than the one suggested as to cabinet officers.\r\nThe President should 'touch elbows' with Congress.  He should have\r\nno policy distinct from that of his party, and this is better\r\nrepresented in Congress than in the Executive.  Cleveland made his\r\ncardinal mistake in dictating a tariff policy to Congress.  Grant\r\nalso failed to cultivate friendly relations with Congress, and was\r\nconstantly thwarted by it.  Lincoln had a happy faculty in dealing\r\nwith Members and Senators.\r\n\r\n\"As to visiting you, I will do so with pleasure if you think it\r\nnecessary, but I dread, on your account as well as my own, the\r\nnewspaper talk and gabble that will follow.  It might embarrass\r\nyou with others.  With the modern facility of dictating you can\r\nconverse with me without restraint, and all letters passing between\r\nus can be returned to the writer.  In conclusion permit me to say,\r\nand perhaps I am justified in saying by what appears in the papers,\r\nthat you must not feel embarrassed or under the slightest restraint\r\nby seeing my name in connection with office.  I am not seeking or\r\nexpecting any position, nor have I ever determined in my own mind\r\nwhether I could, consistently with my duties to Ohio, accept any\r\nexecutive office.  You should fell like a gallant young gentleman\r\nentering upon life with a world of girls about him, free to choose\r\n--to propose, but not to dispose.\r\n\r\n\"Give my kind regards, in which Mrs. Sherman and Mamie join, to\r\nMrs. Harrison and your children, especially the little grandson.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of the nomination at Chicago did not in the least disturb\r\nmy equanimity or my allegiance to the great party to which I\r\nbelonged, and for the success of which I had devoted my life since\r\n1854.  I listened with complaisance to the explanations made as to\r\nthe wavering of the Ohio delegation on the Saturday previous to\r\nthe nomination, and as to the unexpected action of the New York\r\ndelegation and the curious reasoning which held them together in\r\nthe hope that they could persuade their leader to vote for me.\r\nThe only feeling of resentment I entertained was in regard to the\r\naction of the friends of General Alger in tempting with money poor\r\nnegroes to violate the instructions of their constituents.  I have\r\nsince read many of the revelations made subsequently as to the\r\naction of the Ohio delegation, and came to the conclusion that they\r\ndid what they thought best to promote my nomination, and had just\r\nground for discouragement when my vote fell below the number\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July I attended the national exposition in progress\r\nin Cincinnati at that time, and made a speech mainly confined to\r\nthe remarkable growth of the northwestern states.  On the next day\r\nI visited the chamber of commerce, and the Lincoln club.  I then\r\nwent to Mansfield.  On the evening of the day of my arrival I was\r\ncalled upon by a great number of my townsmen, who seemed to feel\r\nmy recent defeat with more regret than I did.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit to Ohio I heard a great deal about the Chicago\r\nconvention, but paid little attention to it, and said I was content\r\nwith the result, that my friends had done what they could, that\r\nHarrison was nominated and ought to be elected.  As quoted by a\r\nnewspaper reporter, I said:  \"Henceforth, I can say what I please,\r\nand it is a great pleasure.  This feeling of freedom is so strong\r\nwith me that I am glad I did not get the nomination.\"  Whether I\r\nuttered these words or not, they expressed my feeling of relief at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThe 100th anniversary of the first permanent settlement in the\r\nState of Ohio, at Marietta, was celebrated on the 7th of April,\r\n1888.  There was a difference of opinion among the people whether\r\nthe proper day was the 7th of April or the 15th of July, as the\r\nlanding of the settlers was on the 7th of April, but on the 15th\r\nof July General Arthur St. Clair entered upon the discharge of his\r\nduties as governor of the northwestern territory.  The result was,\r\nthe people of Marietta concluded to celebrate on both days.  Senator\r\nEvarts made an eloquent address on the 7th of April, and I was\r\ninvited to deliver one on the last day of the second celebration,\r\ncommencing on the 15th of July.  The ceremonies, visiting and\r\nfeasting continued during five days.  The fifth day was called\r\n\"Ohio day,\" and was intended as the finale of a great celebration.\r\nIt was said that 20,000 persons thronged the streets and participated\r\nin the memorial ceremonies on that day.  This vast crowd, gathered\r\nfrom many different states, were hospitably entertained by the\r\ncitizens of Marietta.  The exercises commenced in the morning at\r\nten o'clock, with Governor Foraker presiding.  Among the distinguished\r\nguests were the governors or lieutenant-governors of the states\r\nthat were carved out of the northwestern territory.  I had not\r\nprepared a speech, but knew what I intended to talk about.  I was\r\nintroduced by Governor Foraker in an eloquent address, which he\r\nknew how to make.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen:--The very flattering manner in which our\r\ngovernor has introduced me to you rather disturbs the serenity of\r\nmy thoughts, for I know that the high panegyric that he gives to\r\nme is scarcely justified to mortal man.  We have faults, all have\r\nfailings, and no one can claim more than a fair and common average\r\nof honest purpose and noble aim.  I come to-day as a gleaner on a\r\nwell-reaped field, by skillful workmen who have garnered the crop\r\nand placed it in stacks so high that I cannot steal a sheaf without\r\nbeing detected.  I cannot utter a thought without having it said\r\nthat I copied from some one else.  I thank fortune I have no framed\r\nspeech made, for, if I had, the speech would have been read or\r\nspoken to you in eloquent terms, but I only come with thoughts\r\ninspired by the great history we are called upon to review--a\r\nhundred years of this northwest territory.  What a theme it is!\r\nWhy is it that this favored country of 260,000 square miles and\r\nabout 160,000,000 acres of land had been selected as the place\r\nwhere the greatest immigration of the human race has occurred in\r\nthe history of the whole world?  There is no spot in this world of\r\nours of the size of this western territory, where, within a hundred\r\nyears, 15,000,000 of free people are planted, where, at the beginning\r\nof the century, there was scarcely a white man living.  I am glad\r\nit has been spoken of by such eminent men as Senators Hoar, Evarts,\r\nDaniel, Tucker, General Ewing and many other distinguished men;\r\nand remember, citizens of Marietta, when I speak of this centennial\r\ncelebration, I do not mean that on the 15th of July only, but on\r\nthe 7th of April and the 15th of July bound together in a noble\r\nwedlock.\"\r\n\r\nI referred to the claims made by several of the old states, based\r\nupon their so-called titles to the whole or to portions of the\r\nnorthwestern territory.  Senator Daniel, who was on the stand with\r\nme, had claimed that Virginia owned all the territory south of the\r\n41st degree of north latitude and westward to the \"South Sea.\"\r\nConnecticut claimed all north of that line.  New York made a similar\r\nclaim, all based upon grants by King James or King Charles, neither\r\nof whom knew where the South Sea was, and had no conception of or\r\ncontrol over the vast territory covered by these grants.  Neither\r\nof these states had either title to or possession of any part of\r\nthe northwest territory.  The only title based on European law was\r\nthat acquired by Great Britain from France in 1763, and that title\r\nwas transferred to the United States at the close of the Revolutionary\r\nwar.  There was no just title to this region except that held by\r\nthe Indian tribes of America.  They owned and possessed it.  Before\r\nthe constitution of the United States was, or could have been,\r\nadopted the imaginary claim of the several states was ceded to the\r\nUnited States for the common use and benefit of them all.  Virginia\r\nand Connecticut reserved large portions of Ohio from their several\r\ngrants, and these reservations were conceded to them.  There is\r\none title which has always been acknowledged by civilized nations,\r\nand that is the title by conquest.  The only valid title of the\r\nUnited States was that based upon the conquest by George Rogers\r\nClark, who conquered this country from Great Britain.  It was not\r\nVirginia that did it.  And, yet, among the illustrious names that\r\nhave been furnished by that magnificent state, in the history of\r\nthis country, that of George Rogers Clark will be gratefully\r\nremembered.  He, with his two or three hundred Kentuckians, marched\r\nthrough that country, as Senator Daniel described, and subdued the\r\nBritish.  Virginia is entitled to the honor of having this son;\r\nbut it was George Rogers Clark who gave the United States its title\r\nto the northwest.  The Indians, however, had possession, and how\r\nwas their title to be disposed of?  A treaty was made at Fort\r\nHarmar, and plans were adopted to get possession of the Indian\r\nland.  The Indians always claimed they were cheated in the treaty,\r\ndefining the boundary line between them and the white men.  Therefore,\r\nIndian wars came on.  St. Clair was defeated by the British and\r\nIndians combined.  The British were always at the back of every\r\nhostile movement that has been made in the history of our country.\r\nIn Judge Burnett's \"Notes of the Northwest Territory\" there is a\r\nfull account of how white men, step by step, gained possession of\r\nthis territory.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes made bold and aggressive efforts to hold Ohio.\r\nThey defeated in succession the armies of St. Clair and Harmar,\r\nbut were compelled to yield to the invincible force of General\r\nWayne and his army.  It is painful and pathetic to follow the futile\r\nefforts of the Indians to hold the northwest, their favorite hunting\r\ngrounds.  They were told that only a little land was wanted for\r\nsome poor white settlers to keep them from starving.  They were\r\noffered $50,000 in money, and $50,000 annually for twenty years,\r\nfor the southern part of Ohio.  The council adjourned until the\r\nnext day.  When it convened an old chief said that \"Great Spirit\"\r\nhad appeared to them and told them a way in which all their troubles\r\ncould be ended.  \"Let our Great Father give to the few poor white\r\nsettlers among us the money you offer to us and let them go back\r\nfrom whence they came and be rich and happy.\"  Colonel Wayne could\r\nnot answer this logic, and the Indians were compelled to submit to\r\ntheir fate and ceded one-half of Ohio.  In concluding I said:\r\n\r\n\"In the history of Ohio we have passed through three or four stages.\r\nFirst was the struggle with the Indians.  This generation has not\r\nrealized it, but I have lived long enough to know something about\r\nit in the northern part of Ohio.  I saw the last Indian tribe leave\r\nthe soil of Ohio in 1843, the Wyandotte Nation.  There was but the\r\nfeeble remnant of the most powerful tribe in the world.  The next\r\nperiod was the clearing of log cabins.  Every homestead was a log\r\ncabin--no brick houses, no frame houses, except in town.  The log\r\nhouses in the clearing, the toilsome and exciting time.  You talk\r\nabout hard times now--I have seen the time when a man was glad to\r\nget thirty-two cents for a bushel of wheat; when eggs could not be\r\nsold, when the only way to get 'York money' was to drive horses\r\nand cattle and sheep over the Alleghanies.  The next step was the\r\ncanal system, which brought laborers into the country.  Then came\r\nthe railroads and telegraphs, when the canals ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I am done.  I shall think, however, that I am not through\r\nunless I reverently and devoutly give thanks to the Ruler of the\r\nuniverse for all this great good that has come upon this great\r\ncontinent.  Here we see the most wonderful republic in the world,\r\nborn within a hundred years, a great community peopling a continent,\r\nhaving every facility in the world for homes--no land-locked\r\nmonopoly, closing the door to the poor acquiring homes, or if it\r\ndoes, it should be broken down at every hazard by wise laws passed\r\nfrom time to time.  I reverently thank God for our homes, for our\r\ngreat cities, for our state and, more than all else, for our\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October, while Congress was still in session, I went\r\nto Cincinnati and joined in celebrating \"Republican day\" at the\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the adjournment of Congress I went to Cleveland\r\nto attend a meeting in the Music Hall, where I made my first speech\r\nin the political campaign.  It was carefully prepared and was\r\nconfined mainly to a full discussion of the tariff question.  From\r\nthat time until the day of the election I was constantly occupied\r\nin making speeches in different parts of the state and in Indiana.\r\nAmong the many places in which I spoke in Ohio were Lancaster,\r\nDefiance, Toledo and Mansfield.  My first speech in Indiana was at\r\nPortland.  I referred to a statement made in the newspapers that\r\nthe Republicans had given up Indiana, and denied this emphatically.\r\nI said that since I had come among them and felt the enthusiasm\r\nexhibited by them I was entirely confident that they would give to\r\ntheir own \"most gallant citizen for President of the United States\"\r\na hearty and enthusiastic support.  I discussed at length the Mills\r\nbill and the tariff bill of the Senate, and closed with an appeal\r\nto the \"Hoosier voter\" in behalf of Ben. Harrison, \"the hero of\r\nPeach Tree Creek, and the man that honored Indiana in the Senate\r\nof the United States for six years.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day I spoke at Huntington, opening my speech as follows;\r\n\r\n\"When I was traveling over the State of Ohio, recently, I was\r\noccasionally asked 'what about Indiana?' and now, since I have been\r\nin Indiana, I will be able to answer more accurately than I could\r\nhave done, although I believed the people of Indiana were loyal,\r\nand brave, and true, and would never turn their backs upon their\r\nmost eminent citizen when he had been designated by the Republican\r\nparty as a candidate for chief magistrate of the Union.  But I have\r\nno longer any doubt about Indiana.  I saw yesterday 10,000 to 15,000\r\npeople, excited by the highest enthusiasm, marching in the bright\r\nsun and warm atmosphere in a county supposed to be Democratic.  To-\r\nday, although the weather is inclement, I see your streets filled\r\nwith ardent and enthusiastic people, shouting for Harrison and\r\nMorton and the Republican ticket.  No rain disturbs you; no mud\r\nstops you.  I shall go back to Ohio and tell them that the Buckeyes\r\nand Hoosiers will march together.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Indiana I received a request from Harrison to speak at\r\nIndianapolis, but my engagement at Toledo prevented this, much to\r\nmy regret.\r\n\r\nMy part in the canvass closed at home on the evening of the 5th of\r\nNovember.  I concluded my speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Benjamin Harrison possesses many qualities of the highest character.\r\nHe is an able lawyer, an honest man and a good citizen.  Benjamin\r\nHarrison is a man for whom every American citizen should vote.  He\r\nwould stand like a wall of fire on every question of honor with a\r\nforeign country.  If you want to do your country a valuable service\r\nyou will go to the polls and give a good square honest vote for\r\nHarrison.\"\r\n\r\nHarrison received in Ohio a majority over Cleveland of 19,000 votes,\r\nand a majority of the electoral vote in the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the period immediately following the election, the papers\r\nwere, as usual, full of conjectures as to cabinet appointments.\r\nAll sorts of cabinets were formed for General Harrison and in many\r\nof them I was mentioned for the office of Secretary of State.  It\r\nwas because of this that I wrote to Harrison the letter already\r\ninserted of the date of November 26.  I wished to relieve him from\r\nall embarrassments, as I had made up my mind not to hold any office\r\nexcept such as might be given to me by the people of Ohio.  I\r\ngratefully acknowledge that all the political favor I have received\r\nhas been from the people of my native state.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of November Mrs. Ellen Ewing Sherman, wife of General\r\nSherman, died at her home in New York.  She had been in feeble\r\nhealth, but was taken seriously ill about three weeks before her\r\ndeath.  She was an accomplished woman of marked ability inherited\r\nfrom her father, a devout Christian of the Catholic faith.  Her\r\nlife had been devoted to the relief of suffering and want.  This\r\nsad calamity was a source of great grief to her own family and that\r\nof her husband.  She was married to General Sherman on the 1st of\r\nMay, 1850, at Washington, when her father was a member of the\r\ncabinet of President Taylor.  Throughout her entire life she was\r\nan affectionate wife and a devoted mother.  Her remains were removed\r\nto St. Louis, and were there buried beside those of two sons and\r\nthree grandchildren.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1888-89, after the political excitement of the year\r\nbefore, seemed a tranquil period of rest.  The coming change of\r\nadministration excited some interest, especially the selection of\r\na cabinet.  Blaine and I were frequently mentioned in the public\r\nprints for appointment as Secretary of State, but I gave no attention\r\nto the rumors.  I did not care to decline an office not tendered\r\nto me, though I had definitely made up my mind not to accept any\r\nexecutive office.  The duties of a Senator were familiar and\r\nagreeable to me.  I doubted the wisdom of competing presidential\r\ncandidates accepting cabinet appointments under a successful rival.\r\nThe experiment of Lincoln, with Chase and Seward as his principal\r\nadvisers, was not a good example to follow.\r\n\r\nThe short session of the 50th Congress, commencing December 3,\r\n1888, was mainly occupied with the tariff question, already referred\r\nto, but without hope of passing any tariff bill.  Many other\r\nquestions of public policy were also discussed, but as a rule were\r\npostponed to the next Congress, which it was known would be Republican\r\nin both branches.  Perhaps the most interesting topic of debate\r\nwas the condition of affairs in Samoa.  As chairman of the committee\r\non foreign relations, on the 29th of January, 1889, I presented\r\nto the Senate a full statement of the complications in that far\r\ndistant group of islands.  In opening I said:\r\n\r\n\"The time has arrived when Congress, and especially the Senate,\r\nmust give intelligent attention to the questions involved in the\r\noccupation and settlement of the Samoan Islands.  These questions\r\nare now exciting profound attention, not only in this country, but\r\nin Great Britain and Germany.  While supporting the amendments\r\nproposed by the committee on foreign relations, reported now from\r\nthe committee on appropriations, I think it is due to the Senate\r\nand the people of the United States that I should state, in a\r\nskeleton form, the chief facts in regard to this matter, and that,\r\ntoo, without any feeling whatever, without any desire to interfere\r\nwith our diplomatic negotiations, or to disturb the harmony of our\r\nrelations with Germany or Great Britain.  I hope that the action\r\nof the Senate will be unanimous upon the adoption of these amendments,\r\nand that a frank and open debate will tend to this result.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to follow the line of events that resulted\r\nin making Great Britain, Germany, and the United States the guardians\r\nof these far distant, half-civilized, mercurial, and combative\r\norientals.  The only interest the United States had in these islands\r\nwas the possession and ownership of the Bay of Pago-Pago, acquired\r\nby a treaty in 1878 between the United States and the King of Samoa.\r\nThe repeated wars on a small scale that have occurred since that\r\ntime, and the complications and expense caused by the tripartite\r\nprotectorate of the islands, furnish another example of the folly\r\nof the United States in extending its property rights to lands in\r\na far distant sea.  Our continental position ought to dissuade us\r\nfrom accepting outside possessions which in case of war would cost\r\nthe United States more to defend than their value.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1889, my youngest sister, Fanny Sherman\r\nMoulton, the widow of Colonel Charles W. Moulton, died at her\r\nresidence at Glendale, Ohio, after a brief illness.  Her husband\r\ndied in January, 1888.  She was buried by his side in Spring Grove\r\nCemetery, near Cincinnati.  In the hurry of the close of the session\r\nI could not attend her funeral.  She was always kind and affectionate,\r\nnot only to her children, but to all her kindred.  I felt her death\r\nkeenly, for as the youngest of our family she had lived with me\r\nuntil her marriage, and was regarded by me more as a daughter than\r\na sister.\r\n\r\nThe called session of the Senate convened on the 4th of March,\r\n1889.  President Harrison's message was well delivered and well\r\nreceived.  It was longer than the usual inaugural.  It was free\r\nfrom any studied rhetoric, but was sensible, logical and satisfactory.\r\nThe nominations of the cabinet officers were made and immediately\r\nconfirmed.  Those of Blaine and Windom were anticipated but the\r\nremainder of the cabinet excited some surprise.  They were\r\ncomparatively new men, without much, if any, experience in\r\ncongressional life, but were well known in their respective states\r\nas gentlemen of ability and high character.  A bare majority of\r\nthe Senate were classed as Republicans.  They retained the organization\r\nof the committees and no material changes were made.  The Senate\r\nacted upon its general custom to confine its business to that which\r\nit could do alone without the action of the House.  It adjourned\r\non the 2nd of April, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\nFOUR AND A HALF MONTHS IN EUROPE.\r\nOur Party Takes Its Departure on the \"City of New York\" on May 1--\r\nPersonnel of the Party--Short Stop in London--Various Cities in\r\nItaly Visited--Sight-Seeing in Rome--Journey to Pompeii and Naples\r\n--Impressions of the Inhabitants of Southern Italy--An Amusing\r\nIncident Growing Out of the Ignorance of Our Courier--Meeting with\r\nMr. Porter, Minister to Rome--Four Days in Florence--Venice Wholly\r\nUnlike Any Other City in the World--Favorable Impression of Vienna\r\n--Arrival at Paris--Reception by the President of the Republic of\r\nFrance--Return Home--My Opinion Concerning England and Englishmen\r\n--Reception at Washington--Campaigning Again for Foraker--Ohio Ballot\r\nBox Forgery and Its Outcome--Address at Cleveland on \"The Congress\r\nof American States\"--Defeat of Foraker for Governor.\r\n\r\nSoon after the close of the called session in April, 1889, Mrs.\r\nSherman and I concluded to make a trip to Europe.  Both of us had\r\nbeen confined more than usual for over a year, and needed recreation\r\nand a change of scene.  We went to New York on the 27th of April,\r\nstopping with my niece, Mrs. Alfred M. Hoyt.  On the next day we\r\nwitnessed from the battery the naval parade in honor of the centennial\r\nof the inauguration of Washington.  On the first of May my little\r\nparty, composed of Mrs. Sherman, Miss May Hoyt, my daughter Mary\r\nand myself, were driven to the steamer \"City of New York,\" and\r\nthere met Senator Cameron and his wife, with their infant child\r\nand nurse, Mrs. Colgate Hoyt, a niece of mine, with four children\r\nand nurse, and Mrs. Henry R. Hoyt, child and nurse.  With this\r\nlarge party we had a joyous and happy voyage.  Among the passengers\r\nwe found many agreeable companions and had the usual diversions,\r\nsuch as music, singing and card playing.  We arrived at Queenstown\r\non the 8th of May without any special incident, proceeding thence\r\nto Liverpool and London, where we stopped at the Hotel Metropole.\r\nHere all our companions except our family party of four left us.\r\nAs it was our desire to visit Italy before the hot weather set in,\r\nwe determined to push on as rapidly as convenient to Naples.  We\r\nspent a day or two in London.  We pushed on to Paris via Folkestone\r\nand Boulogne.  We remained three days at the Hotel Liverpool in\r\nParis and there met several friends, among them Mrs. William Mahone\r\nand daughter, and Major and Mrs. Rathbone.  On the 14th we went to\r\nLyons, the 15th to Marseilles, and the 16th to Nice.  On the 17th\r\nwe visited Monte Carlo, and on the 18th went to Genoa.  Here we\r\nspent two days in visiting the most interesting places in that\r\nancient and interesting city.  From thence, on the 20th, we went\r\nto Rome.  The city had already been abandoned by most of the usual\r\nvisitors, but we did not suffer from the heat, and leisurely drove\r\nor walked to all the principal places of interest, such as the\r\nruins of the Roman forum, the Colosseum, the baths of Caracalla\r\nand St. Peter's, and the many churches in that ancient city.  In\r\nthe six days in Rome we had, with the aid of maps and a good guide,\r\nvisited every interesting locality in that city, and had extended\r\nour drives over a large part of the Campagna.  At Liverpool I had\r\nemployed a Swiss with the awkward name of Eichmann as my courier.\r\nHe had a smattering knowledge of many languages, but could not\r\nspeak any well; he proved to be faithful, and, so far as I could\r\ndiscover, was honest.  He relieved us from petty cares and could\r\ngenerally find the places I wished to see.  On the 27th we went to\r\nNaples, and on the 28th by steamer to Sorrento and Capri.  On the\r\n29th we traveled by carriage to Pompeii and thence to Naples.  On\r\nthe 30th we drove about Naples as well as we could, but here we\r\nbegan to feel the heat, which was damp and depressing.  It is the\r\nmisfortune of this city that, although surrounded on all sides by\r\nthe most beautiful and picturesque scenery of sea and mountain, in\r\na land rich in historical and poetical annals, yet a large portion\r\nof the inhabitants impress a stranger with the conviction that they\r\nare the poorest, and perhaps the most ignorant, population in\r\nEurope.  It is a sad reflection, that applies especially to all\r\nparts of southern Italy, that the descendants of the Romans, once\r\nthe rulers of the world, are now classed among the lowest in\r\nintelligence in the Christian and civilized world.  I remember two\r\nthings about Naples, one that Mount Vesuvius was in partial action\r\nduring our stay, and that we had a full opportunity to explore the\r\nruins of Pompeii.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there occurred an amusing incident growing out of\r\nthe ignorance of a common American phrase on the part of my courier.\r\nMr. Oates, of Alabama, a leading Member of the House of Representatives,\r\nwas traveling with his wife and friends on the same general route\r\nthat I was.  We frequently met and had pleasant and friendly chats.\r\nEichmann noticed our intimacy and was very polite to Mr. Oates.\r\nOne day, as my party and I were about to enter a car, some one\r\nsaid:  \"Is not that John Sherman?\"  Mr. Oates said, in the hearing\r\nof Eichmann:  \"Yes, that is Sherman,\" and added as a compliment:\r\n\"He was a good watchdog in the treasury.\"  Eichmann catching the\r\nphrase \"watchdog\" applied to me regarded it as a gross insult.  He\r\nrushed into my car, his face aflame with passion and his English\r\nmore confused than usual, and said:  \"That man,\" pointing to Oates,\r\n\"was not your friend; he called you, sir, a watchdog; yes, sir, a\r\nwatchdog.  He has but one arm, sir, one arm, or I would have\r\nchastised him.\"  I had great difficulty in persuading him what a\r\n\"watchdog\" meant, that it was intended as a compliment, not as an\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st we returned to Rome.  During my stay there I had the\r\npleasure of meeting Mr. Porter, our minister to Rome.  He was hardly\r\nyet installed in his duties, as the king had been absent, but\r\nreturned from Germany the day I arrived.  Porter and I had been in\r\nCongress together, and boarded at the same house.  He was not only\r\na man of ability, but of pleasing address and manners.\r\n\r\nEverybody I saw in Rome was talking about the heat and moving out\r\nof town.  On June 1, I went to Florence.  There we spent four days\r\nvery pleasantly.  The hotel was good, the weather all we could\r\ndesire, and the people we met, looked contented and comfortable.\r\nThey were in striking contrast with their countrymen in Naples.\r\nThere was an air about the place that indicated prosperity.  Florence\r\nis an art gallery.  Several of our countrymen, famous as artists,\r\nof whom I can recall Powers, Meade and Turner, were not only\r\npursuing, but learning, their art.  I was told that a considerable\r\npart of the population were engaged in painting and sculpture.  No\r\ndoubt their wages were small but food and clothing were also low.\r\n\r\nWe would gladly have remained longer in Florence if my plan of\r\ntravel would have allowed it.  Not only was the city and all the\r\ntreasures of art interesting, but the country around was picturesque\r\nand highly cultivated.  We could ride in any direction over admirable\r\nroads and almost every place had an historical interest.  I witnessed\r\nthere a review of several thousand troops, but was especially\r\ninterested in a body of small men well drilled for rapid movements.\r\nThe parade was on Sunday and the ladies objected to a parade on\r\nthat day.  I observed that in the Latin states I visited, Sunday\r\nwas generally selected for such displays.  I purchased two works\r\nof art from American artists.  I commend the wisdom of their choice\r\nof location, for in Florence the love of art, especially of sculpture,\r\nis more highly appreciated than in any other city of Europe that\r\nI have visited.\r\n\r\nOur next stopping place was Venice.  The chief attraction of this\r\ncity is that it is unlike any other city in the world in its\r\nlocation, its architecture, its history and in the habits and\r\noccupation of its people.  It is literally located in the sea; its\r\nstreets are canals; its carriages are gondolas and they are peculiar\r\nand unlike any other vessel afloat.  Magnificent stone palaces rise\r\nfrom the waters, and the traveler wonders how, upon such foundations,\r\nthese buildings could rest for centuries.  Its strange history has\r\nbeen the basis of novels, romances, dramas and poetry, by writers\r\nin every country and clime.  Its form of government was, in the\r\ndays of the Doges, a republic governed by an aristocracy, and its\r\nwealth was the product of commerce conducted by great merchants\r\nwhose enterprise extended to every part of the known habitable\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nWe visited St. Mark's cathedral, the palace of the Doges, and the\r\nnumerous places noted in history or tradition.  We chartered a\r\ngondola and rode by moonlight through the Grand Canal and followed\r\nthe traditional course of visitors.  The glory of Venice is gone\r\nforever.  We saw nothing of the pomp and panoply of the ancient\r\ncity.  The people were poor and the palaces were reduced to tenement\r\nhouses.  Venice may entice strangers by its peculiar situation and\r\npast history, but in the eye of an American traveler it is but a\r\ngreat ruin.  The wages paid for labor were not sufficient to supply\r\nabsolute necessities.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the railroad to Vienna is a remarkable feat of\r\nengineering.  The route over the Semmerling pass presents difficulties\r\nfar greater than any encountered in the United States.  We spent\r\nfour days in and about Vienna.  Its location on the River Danube\r\nwas a good one for a great city.  The surrounding country was\r\ninteresting and well cultivated.  The comparison between the people\r\nof Vienna and Venice was very much in favor of Vienna.  The city\r\nwas clean, well built, with many signs of growth and prosperity.\r\nThe people were comfortably clad, and the crowds that gathered in\r\nthe parks and gardens to hear the music of the military bands were\r\norderly and polite.  Among the European cities I have visited, I\r\nrecall none that made a more favorable impression on my mind than\r\nVienna.  I found no difficulty in making my English understood,\r\nand it was said of the people of that city that they generally knew\r\nenough of the English and French languages, in addition to their\r\nnative German, to sustain a conversation in either.  We visited\r\nColonel Fred. Grant, then our minister to Austria, at Vosben, about\r\ntwenty miles by rail from Vienna.  I did not seek to make acquaintances\r\nin Vienna, as my time would not allow it, but, from a superficial\r\nview, I believed that the people of that city were intelligent,\r\nsocial and friendly, with more of the habits of Frenchmen than of\r\nthe Germans of Berlin, or of the English of London.\r\n\r\nFrom Vienna we followed the line of railroad through Salzburg,\r\nInnsbruck, to Zurich, stopping at each place for a day.  This a\r\nvery interesting country, generally picturesque, and in some places\r\nmountainous.  Here we see the southern German in his native hills.\r\nA vein of superstition colors their creed as good Catholics.  They\r\nare, as a rule, loyal to their emperor, and content with their\r\ncondition.  The passage from the Tyrol into Switzerland is not\r\nmarked by national boundaries, such as rivers or mountains, nor\r\ndoes the population vary much until one reaches Zurich.  In our\r\nprogress thus far, from Nice through Italy and Austria, our party\r\nhad been traveling over, to us, a new and strange land.  At Zurich\r\nwe entered within a region visited by Mrs. Sherman and myself in\r\n1859.  The cities and mountains of Switzerland seemed familiar to\r\nus.  Great changes, however, had occurred in modes of travel in\r\nthis short period in these old countries.  Railroads traversed the\r\nvalleys and crossed the mountains, where we had traveled in the\r\nstage coach.  At Lucerne I went up a tramway to the top of Mt.\r\nPilatus, at a grade of from 25 to 35 degrees.  I did not feel this\r\nin ascending, but in descending I confess to experiencing real\r\nfear.  The jog-jog of the cogwheels, the possibility of their\r\nbreaking, and the sure destruction that would follow, made me very\r\nnervous.  I would have been less so but for a lady unknown to me,\r\nsitting by my side, who became frightened and turned deathly pale.\r\nI was glad indeed when we reached the lake.\r\n\r\nFrom Lucerne Mrs. Sherman went to Neuchâtel to meet my niece, Mrs.\r\nHuggins, then sick at that place.  The remainder of the party went\r\nto Interlaken and the valley in which it is situated.  I have no\r\nroom for the description of mountain scenery, and no language can\r\nproperly convey a sense of its grandeur.  I have mentally contrasted\r\nMt. St. Bernard and the Simplon with Pike's Peak and Mt. Washburn,\r\nand feel quite sure that in grandeur and in extent of view the\r\nAmerican mountains are superior to those named in Europe, but the\r\nlarger population in easy reach of the mountains of Switzerland\r\nwill give them the preference for a generation or more.  Then Mt.\r\nShasta will take its place as the most beautiful isolated mountain\r\nin the world, and the Rocky Mountain range will furnish a series\r\nof mountains surpassing the mountains of Switzerland; but both\r\nSouth America and Asia contain mountains thousands of feet higher\r\nthan either or any of the mountains of Europe or North America.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details of travels over familiar ground all our\r\nparty arrived safely at Paris on the 2nd of July, 1889.  Unfortunately,\r\nMrs. Sherman was called back to Neuchâtel on the 4th of July, on\r\naccount of the continued serious illness of Mrs. Huggins, the\r\nbalance of the party remaining in Paris.  We were in that city two\r\nweeks and attended the international exposition many times.  The\r\nFrench people know better than any other how to conduct such a\r\nshow.  The great building in which it was held was so arranged that\r\nsimilar articles were grouped together, and yet all productions of\r\na country were in convenient proximity.  The French are artists in\r\nalmost every branch of human industry.  They are cheerful, gay and\r\nagreeable.  They are polite and therefore sensitive of any slight,\r\nneglect or rudeness and promptly resent it.\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris we formed some agreeable acquaintances.  Whitelaw\r\nReid, our minister to France, entertained elegantly his countrymen\r\nand his associates in the diplomatic corps.  From him our little\r\nparty, especially the two young ladies, received many courtesies,\r\nand through him we had invitations from the President of the French\r\nRepublic and officers of the exposition.  The reception at the\r\npalace of the president was in striking and pleasing contrast with\r\nthat given by the emperor in 1867, already referred to.  The later\r\nreception was simple in form, something like a reception by the\r\nPresident of the United States, but where it differed it was an\r\nimprovement upon our custom.  The invitation was quite general and\r\nextended to the diplomatic corps, to all persons representing any\r\narticle in the exposition, and to many citizens and visitors in\r\nParis, who were named by the diplomatic corps or by the officers\r\nof the French government.  I think that fully as many persons were\r\npresent as usually attend the receptions of our President.  Each\r\ninvited guest, as he entered the reception room, gave his name,\r\nand, if escorting others, gave their names to the officer in charge.\r\nThe name was announced to the president, who stood a few paces in\r\nthe rear, the guests and the president bowed but did not shake\r\nhands and the guests passed on through a suite of rooms or into\r\nthe garden.  Miss Hoyt, my daughter and I attended the reception\r\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Reid.  As Mr. Reid entered the room his name and\r\noffice were announced, and the president and he advanced towards\r\neach other, shook hands, and I and my party were introduced and we\r\nshook hands.  This occupied but a moment and the reception of others\r\nwent on, only occasionally interrupted by the president when he\r\nchose to recognize some one by handshaking.  When we were received,\r\nas stated, we were introduced by Mr. Reid to several persons on\r\nattendance on the president, and then retired with the passing\r\ncompany.  In this way the president and his wife escaped the extreme\r\nfatigue of shaking hands with thousands of people in rapid succession,\r\noften producing soreness and swelling of hands and arms.  I hope\r\nsome President of the United States will be bold enough to adopt,\r\nas he can, this simple measure of relief practiced by the President\r\nof the French Republic.  The French government also furnishes a\r\nhouse ample enough for a large reception, which the United States\r\ndoes not do, but I trust will.\r\n\r\nWe left Paris on the 15th of July and joined Mrs. Sherman at\r\nNeuchâtel.  After two days at this delightful place we went to\r\nBasle and thence down the Rhine, stopping at places of interest on\r\nthe way, but this is a journey I had taken before.\r\n\r\nWe made a brief visit to Amsterdam and the Hague, and then went to\r\nBrussels, with which city we had become acquainted on our previous\r\nvisit.  We arrived in England about the 1st of August and remained\r\nin London, or its environs, a week, most of the time in the country.\r\nDuring my stay I did not seek to form new acquaintances and most\r\nof the people I knew were absent in the country.  From London we\r\nwent to Oxford and remained several days visiting the colleges and\r\nthe country around, especially the beautiful palace of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough.  From there we went to Leamington, and made short\r\nexcursions to Warwick Castle, Kenilworth, Stratford and Coventry.\r\nWe then visited the English lakes, including Windermere.  I was\r\nespecially interested in the games, races and wrestling at Grasmere.\r\nFrom there we went to Chester spending several days in that city\r\nand surrounding country.  We visited the magnificent estate of the\r\nDuke of Westminster, a few miles from Chester, and drove through\r\nGladstone's place, but he was then absent.  In Chester we met\r\nJustice Gray and his wife, and Bancroft Davis and his wife.  With\r\nthem we drove in the old-fashioned coach in and about the environs\r\nof Chester.  From thence we went to Liverpool, remaining about a\r\nweek in that city.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that such a rapid, transient\r\nvisit could hardly convey a proper conception of England or\r\nEnglishmen.  Our view was like that of the English traveler in\r\nAmerica when he undertakes to describe our vast country on a trip\r\nof a month from New York to San Francisco.  My idea of Great Britain\r\nis based, not upon flying visits, but upon my study of English\r\nhistory and literature.  The political institutions of Great Britain\r\nare rapidly approaching our own.  While progressive, the people of\r\nthat country are also conservative, but with each successive decade\r\nthey extend the power of the House of Commons so that already in\r\nsome respects it represents better the public sentiment than the\r\nCongress of the United States.  It responds quickly to a change of\r\npopular opinion.  The functions of the crown are now more limited\r\nthan those of our President, while the House of Commons can at any\r\nmoment put an end to the ministry, and if necessary a new House of\r\nCommons can be convened within a brief period, and a new ministry\r\nbe formed or the old one confirmed according to the popular will.\r\nAll the governments of Europe are following in the same path, so\r\nthat we may fairly hope that in a brief time Europe will become\r\nrepublican in substance if not in form.\r\n\r\nWe returned in the steamer \"City of New York,\" the vessel on which\r\nwe went over, and arrived in New York on the 12th of September.\r\nMy wife, daughter and myself returned to Washington, improved in\r\nhealth and strength.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the next day after my arrival a large company,\r\nestimated at 1,500 people, led by the Marine band, marched to my\r\nhouse.  The report given by the \"Republican\" of Washington the next\r\nmorning is substantially correct and is here inserted:\r\n\r\n\"To General Grosvenor had been assigned the duty of formally\r\nwelcoming the Senator, and he did so in a very pleasant speech.\r\nHe spoke of the thirty-five years of faithful service which had\r\nbeen rendered Ohio by John Sherman, as Representative, Senator,\r\ncabinet officer and citizen; touched upon the eagerness with which\r\nOhio looked for the Senator's return; referred happily to the\r\nSenator's wife and daughter, and then launched out upon the broad\r\nocean of Ohio politics.  He closed by saying that one of the chief\r\ncauses of Ohio Republican exultation on this occasion lay in the\r\nfact that the Senator had returned to do nobly his part toward the\r\nre-election of Governor Foraker and the election of a Republican\r\nSenator to succeed Mr. Payne.\r\n\r\n\"The welcome was punctuated with applause, and when the speech and\r\nthe uproar had ceased the band played 'Home Again.'  The crowd\r\ncheered once more as Senator Sherman stepped forward and commenced\r\nhis reply.\r\n\r\n\"Appreciation of the welcome which had been extended to him by\r\nfriends from Ohio and friends in Washington brightened his opening\r\nremarks, and he said that, although his home was in Ohio, yet he\r\nhad been so long a resident of this city that he felt himself almost\r\nentitled to the rights of citizenship here, without, of course,\r\nlosing his allegiance to the people of his native state.  The joys\r\nof home and the pleasures of foreign lands were dilated upon, and\r\nthe Senator said:  'No American can travel anywhere without having\r\na stronger love and affection for his native land.  This is the\r\nfeeling of every American, and it is sometimes too strongly and\r\nnoisily expressed to be acceptable abroad.  We do sometimes carry\r\nthe flag too high and flaunt it offensively.'\r\n\r\n\"Previous visits to Europe were referred to, and the Senator went\r\non:  'And now let me say to you that while we boast in America of\r\nthe rapid progress we have made in growth, population, wealth and\r\nstrength, yet it is equally true that some of the oldest nations\r\nin the world are now keeping pace with us in industry, progress\r\nand even in liberal institutions.  Everywhere in these old countries\r\nthe spirit of nationalism is growing stronger and stronger.\r\n\r\n'Thirty years ago Italy had at least five different forms of\r\ngovernment; now it is under one rule.  Twenty-two years ago France\r\nwas an empire, under the almost absolute dominion of Napoleon III;\r\nnow it is a republic, with all the forms of republican institutions,\r\nbut without the stability of our government.  The kingdom of Prussia\r\nhas been expanded into the great German empire, among the strongest,\r\nif not the strongest, of the military powers in the world.  The\r\ninstitutions of Great Britain have become liberalized until it is\r\na monarchy only in name, the queen exercising far less power than\r\nthe President of the United States.  The whole tendency of events\r\nis to strengthen and at the same time popularize government.'\r\n\r\n\"The popularity of Americans in Europe was mentioned, and it was\r\nsaid of them that while abroad they were not partisans, but patriots;\r\nthey believed that any party at home was better than all parties\r\nin foreign lands.  The signs of war abroad and of peace in the\r\nUnited States were sketched, and the veterans who fought for the\r\nUnion were eulogized and said to be entitled to the most liberal\r\ntreatment.  The Republican party, having saved the Union should be\r\nthe governing party, and it should be heartily supported by all\r\ntrue patriots.\"\r\n\r\nAs I concluded, the audience came forward and shook hands with me.\r\nLater addresses were delivered by Thomas B. Coulter, ex-Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Wm. C. Lyons, of Ohio, Rev. Wm. Warring, J. H. Smyth and\r\nex-Speaker Warren J. Keifer.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of callers were received in the house by Mrs. and\r\nMiss Sherman.\r\n\r\nDuring the balance of the month of September I remained in Washington\r\nengaged in writing letters, dictating interviews, and preparing\r\nfor the gubernatorial contest in Ohio, then in active progress.\r\nGovernor Foraker was the Republican candidate for re-election, and\r\nJames E. Campbell, formerly a Republican and recently a Democratic\r\nMember of Congress, was the opposing candidate.  Both of these\r\ngentlemen were lawyers of ability, in the prime of life and living\r\nin adjoining counties.  The canvass had become interesting before\r\nmy return and I desired to do all I could in aid of Foraker.  He\r\nwas nominated while I was still in Europe, for the third term, and\r\nunder conditions that weakened him somewhat.  Still, his ability\r\nas a debater, his popular manners, and his interesting history,\r\nseemed to assure his success.  I returned to Ohio with my family\r\nabout the 1st of October, and made my first speech in this canvass\r\nat the Wayne county fair, at Orrville, on the 10th.  I was introduced\r\nto the audience by M. L. Smyser, the Member of Congress from that\r\ndistrict, in terms too complimentary to quote.  He gave notice that\r\nCampbell would speak to them on the next day on behalf of the\r\nDemocratic party.  In explanation of my appearance there where\r\npolitics were generally excluded I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is rather unusual at a county fair, where men of all parties\r\nare invited to exhibit and compare their productions, to discuss\r\nparty politics.  Therefore, I hesitated to accept your invitation\r\nto speak here in behalf of the Republican party; but upon being\r\nadvised by my friend, Mr. Smyser, your Representative in Congress,\r\nthat the same invitation was extended to Governor Foraker and Mr.\r\nCampbell, the two candidates for governor, that Governor Foraker\r\ncould not attend, but Mr. Campbell had accepted, I concluded also\r\nto accept, and am now here to give you the reasons for my political\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was prepared for the occasion, and was chiefly on the\r\nchoice between the Mills tariff bill and the Senate bill, both of\r\nwhich failed to pass in the preceding Congress.  I discussed state\r\nissues briefly, including recent frauds at elections, the alleged\r\nbribery and corruption in the election of Mr. Payne as Senator,\r\nand the importance of nonpartisan boards of election.  I closed by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"This is not a contest between Governor Foraker and Mr. Campbell.\r\nI have the highest regard for both of these gentlemen.  Governor\r\nForaker is one of the ablest, one of the most brilliant, men in\r\npublic life.  He was one of the youngest soldiers in the Union\r\narmy, and, though young, rendered important services at critical\r\nperiods of the war.  He has made his own way in the world, and has\r\nfilled with distinction every place assigned him.  He has made an\r\nefficient governor, and I can see no force in the objection that\r\nhe is running for a third term.  If he has performed his duties\r\nexceptionally well in the past, it is good reason why he should be\r\ncontinued in office in the future.  I have also the pleasure of a\r\nvery kindly acquaintance with Mr. Campbell, whom I regard as a\r\ngentleman of merit and ability.  Either of these gentlemen will\r\nperform the personal duties of the office with credit to the state,\r\nbut the contest is not between them, but between the two parties\r\nthey represent.  Governor Foraker represents the principles and\r\ntendencies of the Republican party, its progressive national policy,\r\nthe purity of elections, state and national, and its willingness\r\nto take the lead in Ohio in all proper measures to promote good\r\norder, temperance and morality, so far as they can be promoted by\r\nhuman laws and popular opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Campbell represents the aims and tendencies of the Democratic\r\nparty, its jealousy of national authority, its want of genuine\r\npatriotism, its reactionary policy as to tariff laws, its lawless\r\ndisregard of fair elections, both north and south, the criminal\r\ngangs that disgrace our cities, and its low tone on all questions\r\naffecting good order and morals.  In my view the choice is as plain\r\nas the sunlight of heaven in favor of the Republican party.  It\r\nmay falter for a time in meeting new questions, it may be disturbed\r\nby passing clouds, and, like all human agents, may yield to expediency\r\nor be tarnished with the corruption and faults of individuals, yet\r\nit is the best organized guide in state and national affairs, and\r\nshould, and I confidently trust will, receive the hearty support\r\nof the people of Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nThe reporter, in his description of the meeting, said:\r\n\r\n\"Senator Sherman was in excellent form to-day; his voice was clear,\r\nstrong and its carrying power excellent.  He spoke with uncommon\r\nvigor and, of course, without notes or manuscript.  There was\r\nsomething in his manner that seemed to carry conviction with it.\r\nThe people knew they were listening to an honest man who was a\r\nthorough master of every subject upon which he touched.  He spoke\r\nas one having authority, and the weight of forty years of sturdy\r\npublic life went into his utterances.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this period that the Ohio ballot box forgery matter\r\nbecame a subject of discussion.  On the 11th of September, Richard\r\nG. Wood appeared in Columbus, and delivered to Foraker the following\r\npaper, and received the governor's recommendation for the smoke\r\ninspectorship in Cincinnati:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D.

The\r\nmerit claimed for the box was that it was constructed in such a\r\nmanner as to prevent fraudulent voting.  This alleged agreement\r\nand contract, taken in connection with a bill introduced July 23,\r\n1888, by Mr. Campbell, in the House of Representatives, \"regulating\r\nFederal elections and to promote the purity of the ballot,\" which\r\nrequired the purchase by the government of the ballot box mentioned,\r\nwould of course, if true, present a clear case of corruption on\r\nthe part of the Members of Congress signing the agreement, so grave\r\nas to justify their expulsion.\r\n\r\nA copy of this paper was handed by Governor Foraker to Murat Halstead\r\non the 28th of September, and on the evening of that day the governor\r\nmade a speech at the Music Hall, Cincinnati, in which he referred\r\nto Mr. Campbell having introduced the bill for the purchase of the\r\nballot box.  On the 4th of October, Halstead published in the\r\n\"Commercial-Gazette\" a fac-simile of the false paper, with the name\r\nof Campbell alone, the names of the other apparent signers not\r\nbeing given in the fac-simile and nothing being said about them.\r\nOn the 8th of October I was informed that it was whispered about\r\nCincinnati that my name, with many others, was attached to the\r\npaper.  I at once telegraphed that if this were so the signature\r\nwas a forgery.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke at Orrville two days later I did not allude to the\r\nsubject, regarding the whole thing as an election canard which\r\nwould correct itself.  In a brief time this became true.  The whole\r\npaper was proven to be a forgery.  The alleged signatures were made\r\non tracing paper, from franks on documents distributed by Congressmen.\r\nAll this was done by Wood, or by his procurement, in order to get\r\nan office through Governor Foraker.  Halstead, on the 11th of\r\nOctober, published in his paper, over his own name, a statement\r\nthat Mr. Campbell's signature was fraudulent, no mention being made\r\nof the other alleged signers of the paper.  Subsequently, on the\r\n10th of November, after the election, Foraker wrote a letter to\r\nHalstead giving a narrative of the mode by which he was misled into\r\nbelieving the paper to be genuine.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed strange to me that Foraker, having in his\r\npossession a paper which implicated Butterworth, McKinley and\r\nmyself, in what all men would regard as a dishonorable transaction,\r\ndid not inform us and give us an opportunity to deny, affirm or\r\nexplain our alleged signatures.  An inquiry from him to either of\r\nthe persons named would have led to an explanation at once.  No\r\ndoubt Foraker believed the signatures genuine, but that should not\r\nhave deterred him from making the inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November, I wrote the following letter to Halstead:\r\n\r\n  \"Senate Chamber,               }\r\n  \"Washington, November 12, 1889.}\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Now that the election is over, I wish to impress\r\nupon you the importance of making public the whole history of the\r\n'forged paper' about ballot boxes.\r\n\r\n\"While you believed in the genuineness of Campbell's signature you\r\nwere entirely right in exposing him and the signers of the paper,\r\nfor if it was genuine it was a corrupt and illegal transaction.\r\nI only wonder that seeing the names upon it did not excite your\r\ndoubt and cause inquiry, but, assuming they were genuine, you had\r\nno right to suppress the paper because it involved your friends in\r\na criminal charge.  But now, since it is shown to be a forgery, a\r\ncrime of the greatest character, it seems to me you ought at once\r\nto exercise your well-known energy and independence in exposing\r\nand denouncing, with equal severity, the man or men who forged, or\r\ncirculated, or had anything to do with, the paper referred to.  No\r\ndelicacy or pity ought to shield them from the consequences of a\r\ncrime infinitely greater than the signing of such a paper would\r\nhave been.  I know in this I speak the general sentiment of many\r\nprominent men, and you will appreciate the feeling of honor and\r\nfairness which appeals to you to denounce the men who, directly or\r\nindirectly, were connected with the fabrication of this paper.  If\r\nmy name was forged to it I will consider it my duty to prosecute\r\nall men who took that liberty.  I will certainly do so whenever I\r\nhave tangible evidence that my name was forged.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nA fac-simile of the paper was then published with all the alleged\r\nsignatures.  The subject-matter was fully investigated by a committee\r\nof the House of Representatives, during which all the persons named\r\nin connection with it were examined under oath.  It resulted in\r\nthe unanimous finding of the committee as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In response to the first inquiry directed by the resolution, viz.:\r\n\r\n'By whom said alleged contract was prepared, and whether the several\r\nsignatures appended thereto are forged or genuine,'\r\n\r\n\"We find that said alleged contract was dictated (prepared) by\r\nRichard G. Wood, and that all the signatures thereto are forged.\r\n\r\n\"In response to the second inquiry directed by the resolution, viz.:\r\n\r\n'If forged, what person or persons, if any, were directly or\r\nindirectly aiding, abetting, assisting, or knowingly consenting to\r\nthe preparation and uttering of said forgery, and for what purpose,'\r\n\r\n\"We find that Richard G. Wood, Frank and L. Milward, and Frank S.\r\nDavis were the only persons directly or indirectly aiding, abetting,\r\nassisting, or knowingly consenting to the preparation of said\r\nforgery with knowledge of its character.\r\n\r\n\"We further find that J. B. Foraker and Murat Halstead aided in\r\nuttering said forgery, Mr. Foraker by exhibiting the paper to\r\nseveral persons and thereafter delivering it to Mr. Halstead, and\r\nMr. Halstead aided in uttering said forgery by publishing the forged\r\npaper on October 4, 1889, in the Cincinnati 'Commercial Gazette;'\r\nbut we find that neither of said parties, Foraker and Halstead, in\r\nuttering said paper, knew the same was a forgery.\r\n\r\n\"In response to the third inquiry directed by the resolution, viz.:\r\n\r\n'Whether any of the Members whose names appeared on said alleged\r\ncontract had or have, either directly or indirectly, any unlawful,\r\ncorrupt or improper connection with, or interest in, the ballot\r\nboxes which are the subject-matter of said alleged contract.'\r\n\r\n\"We find that no one of the persons whose names appear on said\r\nalleged contract had or has, either directly or indirectly, any\r\nunlawful, corrupt, or improper, or any other connection with, or\r\ninterest in, the ballot boxes which are said to be the subject of\r\nsaid alleged contract, and that there never was any other contract\r\nrelating to said ballot boxes in which either of these persons,\r\nalone or jointly with others, was in any way interested.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Mason, chairman of the committee, added to the report\r\nquoted the following just and true statement, which relieved Foraker\r\nand Halstead from the implication stated in the report:\r\n\r\n\"If our unanimous finding is correct that Messrs. Halstead and\r\nForaker did not know the paper was forged when the uttered it, then\r\nthey were deceived by some one, for we have found it was a forgery.\r\nBeing deceived, then, is their only offense.\r\n\r\n\"They each have made reputation and character equal perhaps to any\r\nof the gentlemen who were outraged by the forgery.  Since they\r\nfound they were deceived, they have done all in their power, as\r\nhonorable men, to make amends.  To ask more seems to me to be most\r\nunjust, and, believing as I do that the evidence does not warrant\r\nthe censure indulged in by my associates on the committee in their\r\nabove additional findings, I most respectfully, but most earnestly,\r\nprotest.\"\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate incident, not fully explained before the election,\r\ncreated sympathy for Campbell and naturally displeased friends of\r\nMcKinley, Butterworth and myself.  I did not feel the least resentment\r\nafter Halstead denounced the forgery, but entered with increased\r\nenergy into the canvass.  During this period I had promised to\r\nattend, on the 15th of October, a banquet given by the citizens of\r\nCleveland to the delegates to the Pan-American Congress, then making\r\na progress through the United States, to be presided over by my\r\ncolleague, Senator Payne.  As this speech is outside of the line\r\nof my usual topics, the toast being \"The Congress of American\r\nStates,\" and yet relates to a subject of vital importance, I\r\nintroduce it as reported in the Cleveland \"Leader:\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen:--The toast you ask me to respond to\r\nis the expression of a hope indulged in by many of the ablest\r\nstatesmen of the United States ever since our sister American states\r\ndissolved their political connections with European powers.  Henry\r\nClay, as early as 1818, when proposing to acknowledge the independence\r\nof the South American states, eloquently depicted the mutual\r\nadvantage of closer commercial relations with those states.  Mr.\r\nMonroe proclaimed to the world the determination of the United\r\nStates not to suffer any European power to interfere with the\r\ninternal concerns of independent American states.  Still no effective\r\nmeasures were adopted to promote intercourse between them.  The\r\nhope of closer union has not been realized, mainly because of the\r\nneglect of the government of the United States.  We have been too\r\nmuch engaged in political disputes and in the development of our\r\nown resources.  Then we have had a serious unpleasantness among\r\nourselves, which, if it had terminated differently, would have made\r\nus very unacceptable partners.  But, now, all this is past and\r\ngone, and I can give assurance to our guests that not only the\r\ngovernment of the United States, but the people of the United\r\nStates, all parties and of every section, have united heartily in\r\ninviting you here, that they will do their full share in carrying\r\nout your recommendations, and sincerely hope that your conference\r\nwill lead to a congress of American nations.\r\n\r\n\"I look upon this conference as having the same relation to the\r\nfuture of America as the conference of the thirteen British colonies,\r\nin 1774, had to the declaration of American independence.  That\r\nconference led to the constitution of the United States and was\r\nthe beginning of the independence of all the American states.  Your\r\nconference is of infinitely greater importance, for your deliberations\r\naffect the interests of more than one hundred million people, while\r\ntheirs only affected three million.  But, more important still,\r\nyour conference contemplates only peaceful aids for mutual benefit;\r\ntheirs provided for war and a desperate struggle with superior\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall, in the annals of man, a meeting of the selected\r\nrepresentatives of any nations with nobler aims or with greater\r\nopportunity for good than this conference of American states.  You\r\nseek to prevent war by peaceful negotiations and arbitration; you\r\nseek to promote intercourse with each other by land and by sea;\r\nyou seek, as far as the wants and interests of each nation will\r\npermit, to remove unnecessary restrictions to trade and commerce;\r\nyou seek to bring into closer union sixteen republics and one\r\nempire, all of them governed by free institutions.  You do not\r\nunite to conquer, but to help each other in developing your resources\r\nand in exchanging your productions.\r\n\r\n\"If your conference deals wisely with your opportunity you will\r\nlight a torch that will illuminate the world.  You will disband\r\narmies, you will convert ships of war into useful agencies of\r\ncommerce; you will secure the construction of a continuous line of\r\nrailways from New York to Buenos Ayres, with connections to the\r\ncapital city of every American country; you will contribute to the\r\nconstruction of the Nicaraguan Canal and all other feasible methods\r\nof transportation between the Atlantic and Pacific; you will unite\r\nin a generous rivalry of growth and progress all the American\r\nstates.  And, more important than all, you will pave the way for\r\na congress in which all these states will be represented in a\r\ngreater than an Amphictyonic council, with broader jurisdiction\r\nand scope than the rulers of ancient Greece conceived of.\r\n\r\n\"Is this to be only a dream?  I do not think so.  The American\r\nstates are now more closely united in interest than any other part\r\nof the world.  Our institutions are similar.  We nourish no old-\r\ntime feuds to separate us.  Our productions do not compete with,\r\nbut supplement, each other.  Their direct exchange in American\r\nvessels is the natural course of trade.  The diversity of language\r\nis less marked than in any other continent.  The sentiment is\r\nuniversal in America that America belongs to Americans, that no\r\nEuropean power should vex us with its policy or its wars; that all\r\nparts of America have been discovered and are not open to further\r\ndiscovery; each country belongs to the people who occupy it, with\r\nthe clear and unquestioned right of home rule.  Such, at least, is\r\nthe feeling in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"And now, looking back with pride over a century of growth, exhibiting\r\nto you, as we are doing by a rather tiresome journey, what we have\r\ndone, and appreciating fully the rapid progress and enormous\r\nresources of our sister American states, recognizing your equality\r\nand absolute independence, whatever may be your population or extent\r\nof territory, we say to you, in all frankness, that we are ready\r\nand willing to join you in an American congress devoted exclusively\r\nto the maintenance of peace, the increase of commerce, and the\r\nprotection and welfare of each and all the states of the American\r\ncontinents.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October I addressed a great audience in Music Hall,\r\nCincinnati, at which Butterworth and Grosvenor also made speeches.\r\nIn this speech I especially urged the election of Governor Foraker\r\nand answered the cry against him for running for a third term.  I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now, you have a good ticket, as I said, from top to bottom.  I\r\nneed not add anything more with respect to Governor Foraker, who,\r\nI believe, ought to be elected, not only because he has been a good\r\nsoldier, but because he has been a good governor.  Nor do I fear\r\nthat cry about a third term.  How should I fear it, when I am an\r\nexample of a man serving on the fifth term of six years each?  If\r\nForaker has done his duty well for two terms, it is a good reason\r\nwhy he would do better the next time.  If he made any mistakes in\r\nthe past, he will have a chance to correct them in the future, and\r\nI believe he will do so if he has made any; and I don't believe he\r\nhas.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of October I was to address a meeting in Columbus, and\r\nhearing that Governor Foraker was sick, at his residence, I called\r\nupon him, and we had a free and friendly conversation.  I did not\r\nintroduce the subject of the ballot box forgery, but assured him\r\nthat I was doing, and intended to do, all I could to promote his\r\nelection.  He thanked me heartily, expressed his regret that he\r\nwas unable to take part in the canvass, but hoped to do so before\r\nits close.  At one of the largest indoor meetings ever held in\r\nColumbus, that evening, I especially urged the importance of Governor\r\nForaker's election, and ridiculed, to the best of my ability, the\r\ncry that was made for a third term.  I called attention to the fact\r\nthat all that could be said against Governor Foraker was that he\r\nwas running for a third term.  Continuing, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Why for a third term?  Because he did so well in both his previous\r\nterms that the Republican party of Ohio was willing to sanction\r\nhim as its candidate for a third term--and intend to elect him.\r\nWhy should not a man be nominated by the Republicans for a third\r\nterm as Governor of Ohio?  What is there in the office that prevents\r\nhis full and free and complete performance of all the duties imposed\r\nupon him as Governor of Ohio?  Why, they say the President, by a\r\nprescriptive rule that has been established since the time of\r\nWashington, cannot be nominated for a third term.  What of that?\r\nThe powers of the Governor of Ohio and the President of the United\r\nStates are as different as a and z, and are as wide apart as heaven\r\nand earth.  The President of the United States is armed with more\r\npower during his four years than any prince or potentate of Europe;\r\nhe exercises a power greater than any man in any country of the\r\nworld, whether a monarchy or empire.  But is there any similitude\r\nbetween the Governor of Ohio and the President of the United States?\r\nWhat power has he?  The Governor of Ohio has less power than almost\r\nany other governor of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke on the 2nd of November in the Music Hall at Cleveland, and\r\nthere again urged the election of Foraker.  I give a short extract\r\nof the description of the speech as it appeared in the papers of\r\nthat city:\r\n\r\n\"He ridiculed the third term scare of the Democracy and then paid\r\na glowing tribute to the worth and integrity of Governor Foraker.\r\n'Has any man said,' he asked, 'that Governor Foraker is a bad man;\r\nthat he is not a good man?  My countrymen, no one has said that.\r\nHe was a brave soldier.  He is a self-made man; the son of good,\r\nplain people.  He is self-educated.  By integrity and toil he\r\nmounted, step by step, on the ladder of fame.  Nearly every man\r\nwho has arisen to prominence in our country has arisen from the\r\nranks by toil.  Such a man is Governor Foraker.'\"\r\n\r\nI spoke daily during the last two weeks of the canvass and everywhere\r\nmade the same appeal in behalf of Governor Foraker and the state\r\nticket.  The result of the election was that Campbell received a\r\nplurality of 10,872 votes and was elected.  A majority of the\r\nlegislature was Democratic, and subsequently elected Calvin S.\r\nBrice United States Senator.\r\n\r\nElbert L. Lampson, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor,\r\nwas elected by a plurality of 22.  The other candidates on the\r\nRepublican state ticket were elected by an average plurality of\r\nabout 3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\nHISTORY OF THE \"SHERMAN SILVER LAW.\"\r\nPresident Harrison's First Annual Message--His Recommendations\r\nRegarding the Coinage of Silver and Tariff Revisions--Bill Authorizing\r\nthe Purchase of $4,500,000 Worth of Silver Bullion Each Month--\r\nSenator Plumb's \"Free Silver\" Amendment to the House Bill--Substitute\r\nFinally Agreed Upon in Conference--Since Known as the \"Sherman\r\nSilver Law\"--How It Came to Be so Called--Chief Merit of the Law--\r\nSteady Decline of Silver After the Passage of the Act--Bill Against\r\nTrusts and Combinations--Amendments in Committee--The Bill as Passed\r\n--Evils of Unlawful Combinations--Death of Representative Wm. D.\r\nKelley and Ex-Member S. S. Cox--Sketch of the Latter--My Views\r\nRegarding Immigration and Alien Contract Labor--McKinley Tariff\r\nLaw--What a Tariff Is--Death of George H. Pendleton--Republican\r\nSuccess in Ohio--Second Session of the 51st Congress--Failure of\r\nSenator Stewart's \"Free Coinage Bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe first session of the 51st Congress convened on the 2nd of\r\nDecember, 1889, both branches being Republican.  President Harrison,\r\nin his message, reported a very favorable condition of the national\r\nfinances.  The aggregate receipts from all sources, for the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1889, were $387,050,058.  The total expenditures,\r\nincluding the sinking fund for that year, were $329,579,929.  The\r\nexcess of receipts over expenditures was $57,470,129.  The estimated\r\nsurplus for the current year was $43,678,883.  This would justify,\r\nand the President recommended, a reduction of taxation to that\r\namount.  He called attention to the reduction of the circulation\r\nof national banks amounting to $114,109,729, and the large increase\r\nof gold and silver coin in circulation and of the issues of gold\r\nand silver certificates.  The law then in force required the purchase\r\nof two million dollars worth of silver bullion each month, to be\r\ncoined into silver dollars of 412½ grains of standard silver nine-\r\ntenths fine.  When this law was enacted, on the 28th of February,\r\n1878, the price of silver in the market was $1.20 per ounce.  Since\r\nthat time to the date of his message the price had fallen to 70.6\r\ncents an ounce.  He expressed a fear of a further reduction of the\r\nvalue of silver, and that it would cause a difference in the value\r\nof the gold and silver dollars in commercial transactions.  He\r\ncalled the attention of Congress to these three subjects of national\r\nimportance--the reduction of taxation, the circulation of the\r\nnational banks, and the further issue of silver coin and silver\r\ncertificates, and invoked for them the considerate action of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nHe recommended the revision of the tariff law in such a way as not\r\nto impair the just and reasonable protection of our home industries,\r\nthe free list to be extended to such domestic productions as our\r\nhome industries did not supply.  He referred approvingly to a plan\r\nfor the increased use of silver, which would be presented by\r\nSecretary Windom.\r\n\r\nThe plan, submitted by Secretary Windom in his report, for increasing\r\nthe use of silver in the circulation, provided that the treasury\r\ndepartment should purchase silver bullion every month to a limited\r\nextent, paying therefor treasury notes receivable for government\r\ndues and payable on demand in gold, or in silver bullion at the\r\ncurrent market rate at the time of payment, and that the purchase\r\nof silver bullion and the compulsory coinage of silver dollars\r\nunder the act of 1878 should cease.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1890, Senator Morrill introduced, by request,\r\na bill which had been prepared by, and embodied the views of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  This bill was referred to the committee\r\non finance, and was reported back by Senator Jones, of Nevada,\r\nFebruary 25, with amendments.  The first section of the amended\r\nbill authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase $4,500,000\r\nworth of silver bullion each month, and to issue in payment therefor\r\ntreasury notes receivable for customs and all public dues, and when\r\nso received they might be reissued.  They were also redeemable on\r\ndemand in lawful money of the United States, and when so redeemed\r\nshould be canceled.  Such portion of the silver was to be coined\r\nas might be necessary to meet the redemptions authorized.  Other\r\nsections provided for details by which the plan was to be effected.\r\n\r\nTo this bill I proposed an additional section authorizing the\r\ndeposits of legal tender notes by national banks with the United\r\nStates treasurer, to meet the redemption of the notes of such banks\r\nwhich had failed, gone into liquidation, or were reducing their\r\ncirculation, to be covered into the treasury to the credit of an\r\nappropriation from which the money could be withdrawn as necessary\r\nto meet the payments of the notes for which the deposits had been\r\nmade.  The deposits of this character often exceeded $50,000,000,\r\nbut under the plan proposed the money became immediately available\r\nin current disbursements, thus avoiding a hoarding of the notes in\r\nthe treasury or the creating of a stringency in the circulation,\r\nand, at the same time, giving the government the use of the deposits\r\nuntil needed, by which the issue of bonds to a considerable extent\r\nwould be avoided.  This arrangement was accepted and eventually\r\nbecame section 6 of the law which is now in satisfactory operation.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the debate on this bill every question connected\r\nwith the financial operations of the government for twenty years\r\nwas introduced and made the subject of debate, and especially the\r\ncoinage act of 1873, and the dropping of the old silver dollar from\r\ncoinage.  Although this coin has been restored by the act of 1878,\r\nand hundreds of millions of such dollars had been coined, yet the\r\nSenators from the silver producing states, and especially Stewart,\r\nwere continually harping on \"the crime of 1873,\" as they called\r\nthe coinage act of that year, a careful statement of which has\r\nalready been made in these volumes.\r\n\r\nThe only new allegation made was that the amendment recommended by\r\nthe Senate committee on finance, to strike out the franc dollar of\r\n384 grains, provided for in the bill as it came from the House,\r\nand insert the trade dollar, was not agreed to in the Senate, but\r\nthat the change was made in committee of conference, and passed\r\nwithout the knowledge of the Senate.  A conclusive answer was made\r\nto this statement by the production, from the files of the secretary's\r\noffice, of the original bill as it stood after its passage in the\r\nSenate and before it was sent to conference.  As similar statements\r\nhave been frequently made, I reproduce the portion of this original\r\nbill showing the section in question, with the printer's note\r\naccompanying the bill explaining the different type used in printing\r\nit.  The word \"AGREED\" on the bill is in the handwriting of the\r\njournal clerk of the Senate, Mr. McDonald, who held that position\r\nmany years until his death.  It shows that the Senate adopted the\r\nrecommendation of the committee on finance before the bill was sent\r\nto conference.  This amendment was agreed to by the House conferees.\r\n\r\n[Note in explanation of the bill (H. R. 2934).]\r\n1.  The body of the bill, printed in brevier, is as it came from\r\nthe House.\r\n2.

I said:\r\n\r\n\"I approach the discussion of this bill, and the kindred bills and\r\namendments pending in the two Houses, with unaffected diffidence.\r\nNo problem is submitted to us of equal importance and difficulty.\r\nOur action will affect the value of all property of the people of\r\nthe United States, and the wages of labor of every kind, and our\r\ntrade and commerce with all the world.  In the consideration of\r\nsuch a question we should not be controlled by previous opinions\r\nor bound by local interests, but, with the lights of experience\r\nand full knowledge of all the complicated facts involved, we should\r\ngive to the subject the best judgment which imperfect human nature\r\nallows.  With the wide diversity of opinion that prevails, each of\r\nus must make concessions in order to secure such a measure as will\r\naccomplish the objects sought for without impairing the public\r\ncredit or the general interests of our people.  This is no time\r\nfor visionary theories of political economy.  We must deal with\r\nfacts as we find them and not as we wish them.  We must aim at\r\nresults based upon practical experience, for what has been probably\r\nwill be.  The best prophet of the future is the past.\r\n\r\n\"To know what measures ought to be adopted we should have a clear\r\nconception of what we wish to accomplish.  I believe a majority of\r\nthe Senate desire, first, to provide an increase of money to meet\r\nthe increasing wants of our rapidly growing country and population,\r\nand to supply the reduction in our circulation caused by the retiring\r\nof national bank notes; second, to increase the market value of\r\nsilver, not only in the United States, but in the world, in the\r\nbelief that this is essential to the success of any measure proposed,\r\nand in the hope that our efforts will advance silver to its legal\r\nratio with gold, and induce the great commercial nations to join\r\nwith us in maintaining the legal parity of the two metals, or in\r\nagreeing with us in a new ratio of their relative value; and, third,\r\nto secure a genuine bimetallic standard, one that will not demonetize\r\ngold or cause it to be hoarded or exported, but that will establish\r\nboth gold and silver as standards of value, not only in the United\r\nStates, but among all the civilized nations of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that these are the chief objects aimed at by us all,\r\nand that we differ only as to the best means to obtain them, I will\r\ndiscuss the pending propositions to test how far they tend, in my\r\nopinion, to promote or defeat these objects.\"\r\n\r\nThose of us who were in favor of good money, whether of gold or\r\nsilver, or whether issued by the government in the form of notes\r\nor currency by the national banks, all to be maintained at par with\r\neach other and of equal purchasing power, were constantly charged\r\nwith reducing the volume of money.  I showed that since the resumption\r\nof specie payments, January 1, 1879, there had been a constant\r\nannual increase in the total circulating medium of the country.\r\nI furnished a table showing the steady increase of circulation\r\nduring the period named, which I here insert:\r\n\r\nTHE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF MONEY IN ACTUAL CIRCULATION ON CERTAIN\r\nDATES FROM 1878 TO 1889.\r\n\r\nYear.

When this bill reached the Senate\r\nit was, by unanimous consent, accepted as a substitute for the\r\nSenate bill, and the discussion of the measure continued, occupying\r\nmuch of the time and attention of the Senate until June 17, 1890,\r\nwhen a vote was taken on an amendment proposed by Senator Plumb to\r\nstrike out the first section authorizing the issue of notes and\r\ninserting the following:\r\n\r\n\"That from and after the date of the passage of this act, the unit\r\nof value in the United States shall be the dollar, and the same may\r\nbe coined of 412½ grains of standard silver, or of 25.8 grains of\r\nstandard gold, and the said coins shall be legal tender for all\r\ndebts, public and private.\r\n\r\n\"That hereafter any owner of silver or gold bullion may deposit\r\nthe same in any mint of the United States, to be formed into standard\r\ndollars, or bars, for his benefit, and without charge, but it shall\r\nbe lawful to refuse any deposit of less value than $100, or any\r\nbullion so base as to be unsuitable for the operations of the mint.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was adopted by a vote of 43 to 24, the yeas being\r\nmade up of Democrats and the Republicans from the silver producing\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of this free silver amendment clearly indicated that\r\na large majority of the Senate favored the free coinage of silver\r\nat the ratio of sixteen to one.\r\n\r\nThe other sections of the bill were then made to harmonize with\r\nthis new provision, and the bill was passed and returned to the\r\nHouse, where the amendments were nonconcurred in, and a conference\r\nasked for.\r\n\r\nThe Senate granted this request, and Senators Sherman, Jones, of\r\nNevada, and Harris were appointed to meet Representatives Conger,\r\nWalker, and Bland, of the House, in conference, to adjust the wide\r\ndisagreements.  On July 7 a bill agreed upon in conference was\r\nreported to the Senate, Messrs. Harris and Bland not joining in\r\nthe report.  The bill agreed to became a law July 12, 1890, and\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed to purchase,\r\nfrom time to time, silver bullion to the aggregate amount of\r\n4,500,000 ounces, or as much thereof as may be offered in each\r\nmonth, at the market price thereof, not exceeding one dollar for\r\n371.25 grains of pure silver, and to issue, in payment for such\r\npurchases of silver bullion, treasury notes of the United States\r\nto be prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury, in such form and\r\nof such denominations, not less than one dollar nor more than\r\n$1,000, as he may prescribe, and a sum sufficient to carry into\r\neffect the provisions of this act is hereby appropriated out of\r\nany money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  That the treasury notes issued in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of this act shall be redeemable on demand, in coin, at\r\nthe treasury of the United States or at the office of any assistant\r\ntreasurer of the United States, and when so redeemed may be reissued;\r\nbut no greater or less amount of such notes shall be outstanding\r\nat any time than the cost of the silver bullion, and the standard\r\nsilver dollars coined therefrom, then held in the treasury, purchased\r\nby such notes; and such treasury notes shall be a legal tender in\r\npayment of all debts, public and private, except where otherwise\r\nexpressly stipulated in the contract, and shall be receivable for\r\ncustoms, taxes, and all public dues, and when so received may be\r\nreissued; and such notes, when held by any national banking\r\nassociation, may be counted as a part of its lawful reserve.  That,\r\nupon demand of the holder of any of the treasury notes herein\r\nprovided for, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, under such\r\nregulations as he may prescribe, redeem such notes in gold or silver\r\ncoin, at his discretion, it being the established policy of the\r\nUnited States to maintain the two metals on a parity with each\r\nother upon the present legal ratio, or such ratio as may be provided\r\nby law.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 3.  That the Secretary of the Treasury shall each month coin\r\n2,000,000 ounces of the silver bullion purchased under the provisions\r\nof this act into standard silver dollars until the 1st day of July,\r\n1891, and after that time he shall coin of the silver bullion\r\npurchased under the provisions of this act as much as may be\r\nnecessary to provide for the redemption of the treasury notes herein\r\nprovided for, and any gain or seigniorage arising from such coinage\r\nshall be accounted for and paid into the treasury.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 4.  That the silver bullion purchased under the provisions\r\nof this act shall be subject to the requirements of existing law\r\nand the regulations of the mint service governing the methods of\r\ndetermining the amount of pure silver contained, and the amount of\r\ncharges or deductions, if any, to be made.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 5.  That so much of the act of February 28, 1878, entitled\r\n'An act to authorize the coinage of the standard silver dollar and\r\nto restore its legal tender character,' as requires the monthly\r\npurchase and coinage of the same into silver dollars of not less\r\nthan $2,000,000 nor more than $4,000,000 worth of silver bullion,\r\nis hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 6. That upon the passage of this act the balances standing\r\nwith the treasurer of the United States to the respective credits\r\nof national banks, for deposits made to redeem the circulating\r\nnotes of such banks, and all deposits thereafter received for like\r\npurpose, shall be converted into the treasury as a miscellaneous\r\nreceipt, and the treasurer of the United States shall redeem, from\r\nthe general cash in the treasury, the circulating notes of said\r\nbanks which may come into his possession subject to redemption;\r\nand upon the certificate of the comptroller of the currency that\r\nsuch notes have been received by him, and that they have been\r\ndestroyed and that no new notes will be issued in their place,\r\nreimbursement of their amount shall be made to the treasurer, under\r\nsuch regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe,\r\nfrom an appropriation hereby created, to be known as 'National bank\r\nnotes:  Redemption account,' but the provisions of this act shall\r\nnot apply to the deposits received under section 3 of the act of\r\nJune 20, 1874, requiring every national bank to keep in lawful\r\nmoney, with the treasurer of the United States, a sum equal to five\r\nper cent. of its circulation, to be held and used for the redemption\r\nof its circulating notes; and the balance remaining of the deposit\r\nso covered shall, at the close of each month, be reported on the\r\nmonthly public debt statement as debt of the United States bearing\r\nno interest.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 7.  That this act shall take effect thirty days from and\r\nafter its passage.\"\r\n\r\nThe authorship of this law has been generally credited to me, and\r\nit was commonly called the \"Sherman silver law,\" though I took but\r\nlittle part in framing the legislation until the bill got into\r\nconference.  The situation at that time was critical.  A large\r\nmajority of the Senate favored free silver, and it was feared that\r\nthe small majority against it in the other House might yield and\r\nagree to it.  The silence of the President on the matter gave rise\r\nto an apprehension that if a free coinage bill should pass both\r\nHouses he would not feel at liberty to veto it.  Some action had\r\nto be taken to prevent a return to free silver coinage, and the\r\nmeasure evolved was the best obtainable.  I voted for it, but the\r\nday it became a law I was ready to repeal it, if repeal could be\r\nhad without substituting in its place absolute free coinage.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the act varied greatly from the House bill\r\nbefore the free coinage amendment was attached.  The amount of\r\nsilver bullion to be purchased was changed from $4,500,000 worth\r\nper month to 4,500,000 ounces per month.  This change, owing to\r\nthe fall in price of silver, not then anticipated, greatly reduced\r\nthe quantity to be purchased.  The House conferees yielded reluctantly\r\nto the striking out of the section in the bill providing for the\r\nredemption of the notes in bullion, a plan that had been urged by\r\nSecretary Windom.  In lieu thereof, however, a clause declaring\r\nthat it was the purpose of the government to maintain the parity\r\nof the metals was inserted.  This was a most important amendment\r\nand one that has been generally accepted as indicating the purpose\r\nof the country to maintain all dollars at par with each other.\r\n\r\nThe chief merit of this law was that it suspended the peremptory\r\ncoinage of the silver purchased under it into silver dollars which\r\ncould not be circulated, but were hoarded in the treasury at great\r\ncost and inconvenience.  It required the monthly purchase of a\r\ngreater amount of silver than before, but that could be held in\r\nthe form of bullion, and could be paid for by treasury notes equal\r\nin amount to the cost of the bullion, the whole of which was held\r\nin the treasury as security for the payment of the notes.  If silver\r\nbullion did not decline in market value it could, if necessary, be\r\ncoined without loss, and thus the parity of the notes with gold\r\ncould be readily maintained according to the declared policy of\r\nthe law.  The friends of free coinage stoutly asserted that this\r\npurchase of silver bullion would not only prevent its depreciation,\r\nbut would advance its market value, and thus be a gain to the\r\ngovernment.  I did not believe this but hoped that it would not\r\ndecline in value, and, in any event, it was better to stop the\r\ncompulsory coinage of the bullion into dollars, as to force them\r\ninto circulation would reduce the purchasing power of the dollar\r\nand bring the United States to the single standard of silver.\r\nBeing compelled to choose between the measure proposed and the free\r\ncoinage of silver I preferred the former, and voted for the bill\r\nand, thus, with others, became responsible for it.\r\n\r\nContrary to the expectation of the friends of silver it steadily\r\ndeclined in market value.  The compulsory purchase of the enormous\r\naggregate of fifty-four million ounces, or 2,250 tons Troy, each\r\nyear, did not maintain the market value of silver, but it steadily\r\ndeclined so that the silver purchased each year entailed an annual\r\nloss of more than $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhen the result became apparent I was anxious to arrest the purchase\r\nof silver, and I never could comprehend why anyone not directly\r\ninterested in the mining of silver could favor a policy involving\r\nso heavy a loss to the people of the United States.  Long before\r\nthe second election of Mr. Cleveland I advocated the repeal of what\r\nbecame known as the \"Sherman act,\" and heartily supported and voted\r\nfor the repeal he recommended.\r\n\r\nIn the previous Congress I had introduced a bill \"to declare\r\nunlawful, trusts and combinations in restraint of trade and\r\nproduction,\" but no action was taken upon it.  On the 4th of December\r\nI again introduced this bill, it being the first Senate bill\r\nintroduced in that Congress.  It was referred to the committee on\r\nfinance, and, having been reported back with amendments, I called\r\nit up on the 27th of February, and said that I did not intend to\r\nmake any extended remarks upon it unless it should become necessary\r\nto do so.  Senator George made a long and carefully prepared speech,\r\nfrom which it appeared that while he favored the general purpose\r\nof the bill he objected to it on the ground that it was not\r\nconstitutional.  This objection was shared by several Senators.\r\nI subsequently reported from the committee on finance a substitute\r\nfor the bill, and on the 21st of March made a long speech in support\r\nof it in which I said:\r\n\r\n\"I did not originally intend to make any extended argument on the\r\ntrust bill, because I supposed that the public facts upon which it\r\nis founded and the general necessity of some legislation were so\r\nmanifest that no debate was necessary to bring those facts to the\r\nattention of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"But the different views taken by Senators in regard to the legal\r\nquestions involved in this bill, and the very able speech made by\r\nthe Senator from Mississippi [Mr. George] relative to the details\r\nof the bill, led me to the conclusion that it was my duty, having\r\nreported the bill from the committee on finance, to present, in as\r\nclear and logical a way as I can, the legal and practical questions\r\ninvolved in the bill.\r\n\r\n\"The object of the bill, as shown by the title, is 'to declare\r\nunlawful, trusts and combinations in restraint of trade and\r\nproduction.'  It declares that certain contracts are against public\r\npolicy, null and void.  It does not announce a new principle of\r\nlaw, but applies old and well-recognized principles of the common\r\nlaw to the complicated jurisdiction of our state and federal\r\ngovernment.  Similar contracts in any state in the Union are now,\r\nby common or statute law, null and void.  Each state can and does\r\nprevent and control combinations within the limit of the state.\r\nThis we do not propose to interfere with.  The power of the state\r\ncourts has been repeatedly exercised to set aside such combinations\r\nas I shall hereafter show, but these courts are limited in their\r\njurisdiction to the state, and, in our complex system of government,\r\nare admitted to be unable to deal with the great evil that now\r\nthreatens us.\r\n\r\n\"Unlawful combinations, unlawful at common law, now extend to all\r\nthe states and interfere with our foreign and domestic commerce\r\nand with the importation and sale of goods subject to duty under\r\nthe laws of the United States, against which only the general\r\ngovernment can secure relief.  They not only affect our commerce\r\nwith foreign nations, but trade and transportation among the several\r\nstates.  The purpose of this bill is to enable the courts of the\r\nUnited States to apply the same remedies against combinations which\r\ninjuriously affect the interests of the United States that have\r\nbeen applied in the several states to protect local interests.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"This bill, as I would have it, has for its single object to invoke\r\nthe aid of the courts of the United States to deal with the\r\ncombinations described in the first section, when they affect\r\ninjuriously our foreign and interstate commerce and our revenue\r\nlaws, and in this way to supplement the enforcement of the established\r\nrules of the common and statute law by the courts of the several\r\nstates in dealing with combinations that affect injuriously the\r\nindustrial liberty of the citizens of these states.  It is to arm\r\nthe federal courts within the limits of their constitutional power,\r\nthat they may co-operate with the state courts in checking, curbing,\r\nand controlling the most dangerous combinations that now threaten\r\nthe business, property, and trade of the people of the United\r\nStates.  And for one I do not intend to be turned from this course\r\nby finespun constitutional quibbles or by the plausible pretexts\r\nof associated or corporate wealth and power.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that this bill will interfere with lawful trade, with\r\nthe customary business of life.  I deny it.  It aims only at unlawful\r\ncombinations.  It does not in the least affect combinations in aid\r\nof production where there is free and fair competition.  It is the\r\nright of every man to work, labor, and produce in any lawful\r\nvocation, and to transport his production on equal terms and\r\nconditions and under like circumstances.  This is industrial liberty,\r\nand lies at the foundation of the equality of all rights and\r\nprivileges.\"\r\n\r\nI then recited the history of such legislation in England, from\r\nthe period of Coke and Littleton to the present times.  I also\r\nquoted numerous decisions in the courts of the several states, and\r\nexplained the necessity of conferring upon the courts of the United\r\nStates jurisdiction of trusts and combinations extending over many\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nVarious amendments were offered, and a long debate followed, until,\r\non the 25th of March, Mr. George moved to refer the whole subject\r\nto the committee on the judiciary.  I opposed this motion on the\r\nground that such a reference would cause delay and perhaps defeat\r\nall action upon the bill.  I stated that I desired a vote upon it,\r\ncorrected and changed as the Senate deemed proper.  The motion was\r\ndefeated by the vote of yeas 18, nays 28.  Subsequently, however,\r\nthe bill was referred to the committee on the judiciary, with\r\ninstructions to report within twenty days.  On the 2nd of April\r\nMr. Edmunds, chairman of that committee, reported a substitute for\r\nthe bill, and stated that, while it did not entirely meet his views,\r\nhe was willing to support it.  Mr. Vest, Mr. George and Mr. Coke,\r\nmembers of the committee, also made statements to the same effect.\r\nWhen the bill was taken up on the 8th of April I said I did not\r\nintend to open any debate on the subject, but would state that\r\nafter having fairly and fully considered the substitute proposed\r\nby the committee on the judiciary, I would vote for it, not as\r\nbeing precisely what I wanted, but as the best thing, under all\r\nthe circumstances, that the Senate was prepared to give in that\r\ndirection.  The bill passed by the vote of 52 yeas and 1 nay,\r\nSenator Blodgett, of New Jersey, alone voting in the negative.  It\r\nwas passed by the House and after being twice referred to committees\r\nof conference was finally agreed to, its title having been changed\r\nto \"An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints\r\nand monopolies,\" and was approved by the President June 26, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe law as finally agreed to is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 1.  Every contract, combination in the form of a trust or\r\notherwise or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among\r\nthe several states, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to\r\nbe illegal.  Every person who shall make any such contract, or\r\nengage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty\r\nof a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by\r\nfine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not\r\nexceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize,\r\nor combine or conspire with any other person, or persons, to\r\nmonopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several\r\nstates, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine\r\nnot exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding\r\none year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 3.  Every contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise,\r\nor conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any territory\r\nof the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in restraint\r\nof trade or commerce between any such territory and another, or\r\nbetween any such territory or territories and any state or states\r\nor the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between\r\nthe District of Columbia and any state or states or foreign nations,\r\nis hereby declared illegal.  Every person who shall make any such\r\ncontract, or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall\r\nbe deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof,\r\nshall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars,\r\nor by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments,\r\nin the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 4.  The several circuit courts of the United States are hereby\r\ninvested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of\r\nthis act; and it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys\r\nof the United States, in their respective districts, under the\r\ndirection of the attorney general, to institute proceedings in\r\nequity to prevent and restrain such violations.  Such proceedings\r\nmay be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that\r\nsuch violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited.  When\r\nthe parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such\r\npetition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing\r\nand determination of the case; and pending such petition, and before\r\nfinal decree, the court may at any time make such temporary\r\nrestraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed just in the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 5.  Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any\r\nproceeding under section four of this act may be pending, that the\r\nends of justice require that other parties should be brought before\r\nthe court, the court may cause them to be summoned, whether they\r\nreside in the district in which the court is held or not; and\r\nsubpoenas to that end may be served in any district by the marshal\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 6.  Any property owned under any contract of any combination,\r\nor pursuant to any conspiracy (and being the subject thereof)\r\nmentioned in section one of this act, and being in the course of\r\ntransportation from one state to another, or to a foreign country,\r\nshall be forfeited to the United States, and may be seized and\r\ncondemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the\r\nforfeiture, seizure, and condemnation of property imported into\r\nthe United States contrary to law.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 7.  Any person who shall be injured in his business or property\r\nby any other or corporation, by reason of anything forbidden or\r\ndeclared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor in any circuit\r\ncourt of the United States in the district in which the defendant\r\nresides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy,\r\nand shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the\r\ncosts of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 8.  That the word 'person,' or 'persons,' wherever used in\r\nthis text, shall be deemed to include corporations and associations\r\nexisting under or authorized by the laws of either the United\r\nStates, the laws of any of the territories, the laws of any state,\r\nor the laws of any foreign country.\"\r\n\r\nSince the passage of this act I have carefully studied and observed\r\nthe effect, upon legitimate trade and production, of the combination\r\nof firms and corporations to monopolize a particular industry.  If\r\nthis association is made merely to promote production or to create\r\nguilds for friendly intercourse between persons engaged in a common\r\npursuit, it is beneficial, but such is not the object of the great\r\ncombinations in the United States.  They are organized to prevent\r\ncompetition and to advance prices and profits.  Usually the capital\r\nof several corporations, often of different states, is combined\r\ninto a single corporation, and sometimes this is placed under the\r\ncontrol of one man.  The power of this combination is used to\r\nprevent and destroy all competition, and in many cases this has\r\nbeen successful, which has resulted in enormous fortunes and\r\nsometimes a large advance in prices to the consumer.  This law may\r\nnot be sufficient to control and prevent such combinations, but,\r\nif not, the evil produced by them will lead to effective legislation.\r\nI know of no object of greater importance to the people.  I hope\r\nthe courts of the United States and of the several states, will\r\ndeal with these combinations so as to prevent and destroy them.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1890, I was drawn into a casual debate with\r\nMr. Eustis, of Louisiana, which extended to others, on the relations\r\nof the north and south, or, rather, between Union and Confederate\r\nsoldiers.  The subject before the Senate was a bill to aid the\r\nilliterate in obtaining a common school education.  The chief\r\nbenefit of the measure would have inured to the south, especially\r\nto the negroes of the south.  Mr. Eustis complained of the 15th\r\namendment to the constitution.  I explained to him that this\r\namendment would never have been adopted but for the action of the\r\nsouth in depriving the enfranchised voter, not only of his rights\r\nof citizenship, but of the ordinary rights of humanity.  I gave\r\nthe history of the reconstruction acts, the first of which was\r\nframed by a committee of which I was chairman.  It was based upon\r\nthe restoration of the southern states to all the rights and\r\nprivileges they enjoyed before the war, subject to such changes as\r\nwere made necessary by the abolition of slavery as the result of\r\nthe war.  There was then no feeling of hostility to the people of\r\nthe south.  I had heard at that time no expression of opinion except\r\nof kindness to them.  There was a universal appreciation of the\r\nfact that while they were wrong--radically wrong, as we thought,\r\nin waging a useless and bloody war against the Union of this country\r\n--yet they were honest in their convictions, they believed the\r\ndoctrines they fought for were the doctrines of the constitution,\r\nand there was, therefore, a spirit of generosity, of forbearance,\r\nof kindness, to these people, and everything they could ask for in\r\nreason would have been granted to them.\r\n\r\nIt was not then contemplated to arm the negroes with suffrage.  A\r\nfew, and but a few, Senators made such a proposition, but it was\r\nscouted and laid aside.  It was at this time that the Ku-Klux crimes\r\nand violence broke out, and the laws of the southern states were\r\nso cruel, so unjust, so wrong in our view of the rights of the\r\ncolored people, and of white Republicans as well, that the people\r\nof the north resented this injustice.  These laws burned like coals\r\nof fire in the northern breast.  This led to the reconstruction\r\nacts, and the adoption of the 15th amendment.  The 14th amendment\r\nwas the act of the conservative Senators and Members, such as\r\nFessenden, Trumbull and Doolittle.  The 15th amendment was the\r\nnatural result of cruelty and outrage in the south.  This amendment\r\nhas been practically nullified by the conservatives of the north,\r\nand now the people of the south have increased political power by\r\nreason of the abolition of slavery, while, backed by public opinion\r\nin the south, they deprive the colored people, by whom they gained\r\nthis power, of their political rights, and that by processes that\r\nare denounced as criminal by every free state.  Time, no doubt,\r\nwill correct this evil.  If justice is done to the negroes they\r\nwill advance in intelligence with the improvement of their condition,\r\nand with the benefit of their labor the south will become more\r\nprosperous by the diversity of employments.  There is reason to\r\nbelieve that in a brief period the south will engage in manufactures\r\nand become more prosperous than in the days of slavery.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of May, the death of William D. Kelley was announced\r\nin the Senate.  He entered the House of Representatives as I left\r\nit to take my seat in the Senate, but our frequent meetings in the\r\nconsideration of bills of a financial character led to a friendship\r\nwhich was unbroken, and which imposed on me the duty of responding\r\nto the usual resolutions presented on the death of a Member.  When\r\nMr. Kelley entered the House as a Member from the city of Philadelphia,\r\nhe had arrived at the mature age of forty-six, and had an established\r\nreputation for ability, industry, and fidelity to duty.  He had\r\nbeen trained in the school of poverty, making his own way in the\r\nworld, gathering knowledge by the wayside.  He labored for several\r\nyears at his trade as a mechanic, but, prompted by a restless thirst\r\nfor knowledge, studied law, and for several years practiced the\r\nlegal profession.  In due time he became a judge and served as such\r\nfor ten years, so that when he entered public life as a Member of\r\nthe House he was a trained lawyer, with strong convictions upon\r\neconomic questions, and bold and earnest on all the stern issues\r\nof the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe creed to which he devoted himself consisted of but three\r\narticles:  That the Union must be preserved at all hazards, that\r\nthe national government should exercise its exclusive power to\r\nprovide money for the people of the United States, and that the\r\nlaborer of our country should be protected in his industry from\r\nundue competition.  To the establishment of each of these theories\r\nas the public policy of the country he contributed his full measure\r\nof effort and success.  By instinct he was opposed to slavery.\r\nAll his early struggles and his innate perceptions of the rights\r\nof man made him an enemy to all forms of oppression.  Still, he\r\nwould have respected the right of each state to deal with this\r\nquestion, but when it became manifest that slavery was the real\r\ncause of the attempt at secession, he was among the first and\r\nforemost to demand that it should be abolished.  But especially as\r\nthe recognized leader in the support of protection to American\r\nindustry he exercised commanding influence and authority.\r\n\r\nWhatever opinions might be honestly entertained by others as to\r\nthe nature and extent of this protection, Judge Kelley had no doubt,\r\nbut impartially and freely extended it to every industry, without\r\nregard to its nature, or the section in which it was pursued.  On\r\nall economic questions he had accurate knowledge of details.  His\r\npatient industry enabled him to master every shade and side of such\r\na question, and especially so as to the policy of protection by\r\ndiscriminating duties.  On other matters he was a follower, but in\r\nthis always a leader.  His writings and speeches upon this and\r\nkindred questions constitute a storehouse of information, and\r\nfurnish the best evidence of his industry and ability.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he entered public life until the hour of his death\r\nhe commanded the full confidence of his people.  No fluctuation of\r\nopinion, no personal rivalries, no contests for patronage or office,\r\ncould weaken their confidence in his integrity and justice.  These\r\nobstructions in the paths of public men, often fatal, did not affect\r\nhim.  For thirty years he was the chosen Representative of one\r\nconstituency, in our country an unexampled event.  In the House of\r\nRepresentatives, famous for its sudden changes, he was for many\r\nyears \"the father of the House,\" and no doubt, if his life had been\r\nprolonged to the extreme period allotted to man, his seat in the\r\nHouse would have been safe for him.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July a similar announcement was made of the death of\r\nSamuel S. Cox, late a Representative of the city of New York.  He\r\nhad been a Member of Congress from Ohio before the Civil War, and\r\nshared in the exciting and dangerous scenes in Congress at that\r\ntime, and I felt it became my duty, as one of the few surviving\r\nactors in those events, to pay a just tribute to the qualities of\r\nhead and heart that made him and kept him a leader among the public\r\nmen of our country for a period of more than thirty-three years,\r\nlonger than the average life of a generation.  This duty was the\r\nmore imperative upon me as he was a native of Ohio, for forty years\r\na resident, and for eight years a Representative in Congress from\r\nthat state, honored and respected by all of whatever party or creed,\r\nand beloved by his associates as but few in political life can hope\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nI could also speak of him from a longer personal acquaintance than\r\nanyone in either House, for I had known him or his kindred from\r\nalmost the days of my boyhood.  We were born in neighboring counties,\r\nhe one year later than I.  My father and his were associated as\r\njudge and clerk of the supreme court of Ohio.  I knew of him as\r\nearly as 1853, as the editor of the \"Ohio Statesman,\" a Democratic\r\npaper published at Columbus, the organ of that party in Ohio, but\r\nmy personal acquaintance and association with him commenced with\r\nhis election, in 1856, as a Member of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Cox was a successful leader in political life, and rendered\r\nhis party due fealty on purely political questions, he was not\r\nalways in harmony with the majority of his party.  In his first\r\nspeech in Congress, which was the first one made in the new hall\r\nof the House of Representatives, an opportunity carefully chosen\r\nby him with the skill of an actor, he took ground against the\r\nLecompton constitution, strongly recommended by Mr. Buchanan's\r\nadministration.  He supported several measures during the war not\r\napproved by his political associates.  He spoke in favor of the\r\namendment abolishing slavery, though he did not vote for it.  By\r\ninstinct, education and association, especially by family ties, he\r\nwas against slavery.  On all other questions of a political character\r\nhe was, by inheritance, and no doubt by conviction, a Democrat,\r\nand faithfully followed the tenets of his party.  I do not consider\r\nthis a fault, but a virtue.\r\n\r\nWe constantly forget in our political contests that the great body\r\nof the questions we have to decide are nonpolitical.  Upon these\r\nwe divide without feeling and without question of motives.  On all\r\nsuch matters Mr. Cox was always on the humanitarian side.  He has\r\nlinked his name in honorable association with many humane, kindly,\r\nand reformatory laws.  If not the founder or father of our life-\r\nsaving service, he was at least its guardian and guide.  He took\r\nan active part in promoting measures of conciliation after the war.\r\nHe supported the policy of the homestead law against the veto of\r\nMr. Buchanan.  He was the advocate of liberal compensation to letter\r\ncarriers, of reducing the hours of labor, and of liberal pensions\r\nto Union soldiers.  I doubt if there was a single measure placed\r\non the statute book, during his time, which appealed to sympathy,\r\ncharity, justice, and kindness for the poor, the distressed or the\r\nunfortunate, which did not receive his hearty support.  If kindness\r\nbestowed is never lost, then Mr. Cox has left an inheritance to\r\nthousands who will revere his memory while life lasts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his most pleasing trait was his genial, social manner.\r\nAlways gay, cheerful, and humorous, he scattered flowers on the\r\npathway of his friends and acquaintances.  His wit was free from\r\nsting.  If in the excitement of debate he inflicted pain, he was\r\nready and prompt to make amends, and died, as far as I know, without\r\nan enemy or an unhealed feud.  I had with him more than one political\r\ndebate and controversy, but they left no coolness or irritation.\r\nIn our last conversation in the spring of 1889, we talked of old\r\ntimes and early scenes more than thirty years past and gone, and\r\nhe recalled them only to praise those who differed with him.  He\r\nhad malice for none, but charity for all.  In that endearing tie\r\nof husband and wife, which, more than any other, tests the qualities\r\nof a man, both he and his wife were models of unbroken affection\r\nand constant help to each other.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of travel, and wrote several books descriptive of scenes\r\nand incidents of his journeys.  He also wrote historical works.\r\nHe entered, as an author, a lecturer, and a speaker, many fields\r\nof research, and in all sustained his reputation as a brilliant\r\nwriter and speaker, always interesting and often eloquent, a close\r\nstudent who fully mastered his subject, and withal a man of generous\r\nimpulses, kind and cheerful nature, a true friend, and a faithful\r\npublic servant.  This all can be said truly and without exaggeration\r\nof Mr. Cox.  He did not contemplate death when I saw him last.\r\nHis untimely death was the first news I received on my arrival in\r\nNew York from a journey abroad.  I am told that he met the common\r\nfate of all with patient confidence and an assured hope and belief\r\nin the doctrines of the Christian faith and the promise of future\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that man cannot know the future, and especially\r\nthat future beyond human life.  Socrates, when condemned to death,\r\nconsoled himself with the inconceivable happiness in a future state\r\nwhen he would converse and associate with and question the mighty\r\narray of heroes, patriots, and sages who had preceded him.  He said\r\nto his judges, \"It is now time to depart--for me to die, for you\r\nto live.  But which of us is going to a better state is unknown to\r\neveryone but God.\"  We cannot lift the veil, but may we not share\r\nthe hope of the wisest of men that our farewell to associates who\r\ngo before us is but a brief parting for a better life?\r\n\r\nI have been frequently assailed for my part in the passage, in the\r\nspring of 1864, of a law to encourage immigration.  In reporting\r\nthis bill from the committee on finance, on the 18th of February\r\nof that year, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The special wants for labor in this country at the present time\r\nare very great.  The war has depleted our workshops, and materially\r\nlessened our supply of labor in every department of industry and\r\nmechanism.  In their noble response to the call of their country,\r\nour workmen in every branch of the useful arts have left vacancies\r\nwhich must be filled, or the material interest of the country must\r\nsuffer.  The immense amount of native labor occupied by the war\r\ncalls for a large increase of foreign immigration to make up the\r\ndeficiency at home.  The demand for labor never was greater than\r\nat present, and the fields of usefulness were never so varied and\r\npromising.\r\n\r\n\"The south, having torn down the fabric of its labor system by its\r\nown hands, will, when the war shall have ceased, present a wide\r\nfield for voluntary white labor, and it must look to immigration\r\nfor its supply.\r\n\r\n\"The following may be mentioned as the special inducements to\r\nimmigration:\r\n\r\n\"First.  High price of labor and low price of food compared with\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  Our land policy, giving to every immigrant, after he\r\nshall have declared his intentions to become a citizen, a home and\r\na farm substantially as a free gift, charging him less for 160\r\nacres in fee-simple than is paid as the annual rent of a single\r\nacre in England.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  The political rights conferred upon persons of foreign\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  Our system of free schools, melting in a common crucible\r\nall differences of religion, language, and race, and giving to the\r\nchild of the day laborer and the son of the millionaire equal\r\nopportunities to excel in the pursuit and acquirement of knowledge.\r\nThis is an advantage and a blessing which the poor man enjoys in\r\nno other country.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee rejected several plans to aid immigration, and closed\r\nits report as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your committee are of the opinion that the only aid to immigration\r\nthe United States can now render would be, first, to disseminate\r\nin Europe authentic information of the inducements to immigration\r\nto this country; second, to protect the immigrant from the impositions\r\nnow so generally practiced upon him by immigrant runners and the\r\nlike, and, third, to facilitate his transportation from New York\r\nto the place of his destination, or to the place where his labor\r\nand skill will be most productive.  These objects may be accomplished\r\nwithout great expenditure, and without changing the relation\r\nheretofore held by the United States to the immigrant.\r\n\r\n\"With this view your committee report the following bill and\r\nrecommend its passage.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 27th of September, 1890, a bill was pending to restrict\r\nalien contract labor, I heartily supported it, and, after referring\r\nto the conditions which justified the act of 1864, said that since\r\nthat time the class of immigration coming from some foreign countries\r\nhad been such as would make it proper to exclude a portion of it,\r\nand therefore I was in favor of the bill or any other bill that\r\nwould prevent the poisoning of the blood of our people in any way\r\nwhatever by the introduction of either disease, crime, or vice into\r\nour midst, and would vote to exclude all paupers or persons who\r\nwere unable to earn an honest livelihood by labor.  That is the\r\ncorrect principle.  I think we did, during the war, go to the\r\nextreme in one direction to induce people to come among us to share\r\nour benefits and advantages, and we gave the reasons why we did\r\nso; but now the period has arrived when men of all parties, all\r\nconditions of life, all creeds, ought to be willing to limit and\r\nregulate immigration, so that only those who are able to labor and\r\ntoil in the ordinary occupations of life and to earn a livelihood\r\nshould be allowed to come.  It is a high privilege to enter into\r\nAmerican citizenship.  Neither a pauper, in the strict legal sense\r\nof the word, nor an imbecile, nor one who has a defect or imperfection\r\nof body or mind which lowers him below the standard of American\r\ncitizenship should be allowed to immigrate to this country.\r\n\r\nThe most important measure adopted during this Congress was what\r\nis popularly known as the McKinley tariff law.  I had not given as\r\nmuch care and attention to this bill as other Senators on the\r\ncommittee on finance had, nor did I participate in its preparation\r\nas fully as they.  When the Mills bill came to the Senate in 1888,\r\nthe work of preparing amendments to, or a substitute for, that bill\r\nwas intrusted to Messrs. Allison, Aldrich and Hiscock.  Their work\r\nwas submitted to the full committee on finance, and, after careful\r\nexamination, was reported to the Senate, and was known as \"the\r\nSenate bill\" to distinguish it from the \"Mills bill,\" for which it\r\nwas substituted.  When the McKinley tariff bill came to the Senate\r\non the 21st of May, 1890, it was referred to the committee on\r\nfinance and was there submitted to the same sub-committee that had\r\nconsidered the Mills bill.  The McKinley bill, as amended by the\r\ncommittee on finance, was in substance the Senate bill of 1888.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to refer to the long debate in the Senate\r\non the McKinley tariff bill and the amendments proposed in the\r\nSenate.  The result was a disagreement between the two Houses and\r\nthe reference of the disagreeing votes to a committee of conference,\r\nof which I was a member.  When the report of the committee of\r\nconference came before the Senate I made a long speech justifying,\r\nas I thought, the public policy involved in the proposed tariff\r\ntaxation.  I stated that the sub-committee named was entitled to\r\nthe credit of all the labor expended on the bill, that as a member\r\nof the committee of ways and means or on finance I had participated\r\nin framing all the former revenue laws since 1858, but as to this\r\nbill I had only done what I thought was my duty in keeping pace\r\nwith the labor of the sub-committee, and in examining the bill as\r\nfar as I could consistently with other duties, and giving my judgment\r\nupon its details whenever I thought it necessary.\r\n\r\nMy speech was turned into a colloquial debate by the interruptions\r\nof several Senators, among whom were Gray, Carlisle, Gibson and\r\nPaddock, but this enabled me to meet the chief objections to the\r\nconference report.  More than four-fifths of the provisions of the\r\nbill, as reported by the conference, were precisely in the language\r\nof the bill as passed by the House.  The residue was chiefly taken\r\nfrom the Senate bill, fully discussed in the previous session.\r\nThe rates of duties must necessarily be changed from time to time\r\nto meet the change in prices, the course and balance of trade, the\r\nrelative amounts of exports and imports, and the amount of revenue\r\nrequired.  These changes are rapid and unforseen, so that under\r\nany system of taxation the revenue may rise or fall, whatever may\r\nbe the rates of duty or taxes.  Parties and politicians, in defining\r\ntheir political creeds, talk about a tariff for revenue and a tariff\r\nfor protection.  These are misleading phrases, for every tariff\r\nfor revenue imposed on any imported article necessarily protects\r\nor favors the same article produced in the United States, which is\r\nnot subject to the tariff tax.\r\n\r\nThe real struggle in tariff legislation is one of _sections_, or,\r\nas General Hancock truly said, it is \"a local question.\"  The\r\nRepublican party affirms that it is for a protective tariff.  The\r\nDemocratic party declares that it is for a tariff for revenue only;\r\nbut generally, when Republicans and Democrats together are framing\r\na tariff, each Member or Senator consults the interest of his\r\n\"deestrict\" or state.  It so happens that by the constitutional\r\norganization of the Senate, two sections have an unequal allotment\r\nof Senators in proportion to population.  The New England States\r\nhave twelve able and experienced Senators, with a population,\r\naccording to the census of 1890, of 4,700,745, or one Senator for\r\nless than 400,000 inhabitants.  The nine states west of the Missouri,\r\ncommonly classified as the silver or western states, have eighteen\r\nSenators, with a population of 2,814,400, or one Senator for less\r\nthan 160,000 inhabitants.  This representation in the Senate gives\r\nthese groups of states a very decided advantage in tariff legislation.\r\nThe average of Senators to the whole population is one for 712,000\r\ninhabitants.  This inequality of representation cannot be avoided.\r\nIt was especially manifest in framing the tariff of 1883, when New\r\nEngland carried a measure that was condemned by public opinion from\r\nthe date of its passage.\r\n\r\nI undertook, in my speech, to define the condition of tariff\r\nlegislation, and the position of each party in regard to it.  I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"A change and revision has been demanded by both parties since\r\n1883.  The tariff law of 1883 did not give satisfaction to the\r\npeople of the United States.  It had many imperfections in it.  I\r\nalways thought the great error was made in 1883 in not making, as\r\nthe substantial basis, as the real substance of the tariff law of\r\nthat year, the report of the tariff commission.  Whether that was\r\nwise or unwise, it is certain that the tariff of 1883 never gave\r\nsatisfaction.  There were defects found in it in a short time, and\r\nfrom then till now the subject of the revision of the tariff has\r\nbeen a matter of constant debate in both Houses.  It has been the\r\nsubject of political debate before the people of the United States\r\nin two several presidential campaigns, and the election of at least\r\ntwo Congresses depended upon questions arising out of the tariff,\r\nuntil finally the Republican party, controlling in the Senate, and\r\nthe Democratic party, controlling in the other House, undertook to\r\nbring before the people of the United States their rival theories\r\nas to the tariff.  We had the Mills bill two years ago.  It was\r\nvery carefully examined and sent to us as a Democratic production.\r\nIt came here and in place of it there was substituted what was\r\ncalled the Senate bill of 1888.  That was sent back to the House,\r\nand the House disagreed to it, and thus this controversy was at\r\nonce cast into the presidential election.  Here were the platforms\r\nof the two great parties embodied in the form of bills, and the\r\nchoice between them, not having been decided in Congress, was\r\nsubmitted to the people, and the people of the United States passed\r\ntheir judgment upon the general principles involved in these bills.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what are those general principles?  I think I can state them\r\nvery clearly and very briefly.  On the one hand, the Democratic\r\nparty believe in a tariff for revenue only, sometimes, as they say,\r\nwith incidental protection, but what they mean is a tariff intended\r\nsolely to raise money to carry on the operations of the government.\r\nOn the other hand, the Republican party believes that we should do\r\nsomething more besides merely providing revenue, but that we should\r\nso levy the duties on imported goods that they would not only yield\r\nus an ample revenue to carry on the operations of the government,\r\nbut that they would do more; that they would protect, foster and\r\ndiversify American industry.  This broad line of demarkation entered\r\ninto the presidential contest.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. president, the result of it all is that the Republican party\r\ncarried not only both Houses of Congress, but they carried the\r\npopular voice, elected the President, and now all branches of the\r\ngovernment are governed by the Republican ideas and not by the\r\nDemocratic ideas.\r\n\r\n\"What then was done?  The House of Representatives took up the\r\nSenate bill of 1888, revised it, modified it, and changed it so as\r\nto suit the popular will of the present day, and sent it to us,\r\nand we made some changes in it, and that is the bill now before\r\nus.  To say that anyone can be misled or may be deceived or does\r\nnot know the contents of this bill is to confess a degree of\r\nignorance that I would not impute to any Senator of the United\r\nStates or to any Member of Congress.\r\n\r\n\"There are two or three principles involved in this bill; first,\r\nthat it is the duty of Congress to foster, protect and diversify\r\nAmerican industry.  We believe that whenever a new industry can be\r\nstarted in our country with a successful hope of living, with a\r\nreasonable protection against foreign manufactures, we ought to\r\nestablish it here, and that this is a good policy for the country.\r\nIt is not necessary for me to show that this policy is as old as\r\nour constitution; that Washington proclaimed it; that even Jefferson\r\nand Madison and the old Republican Presidents of the former times\r\nwere in favor of that doctrine, and that General Jackson advocated\r\nit in the most emphatic way in many different forms of speech.  It\r\nhas come down to us, and we are trying now to carry out that idea,\r\nto encourage home productions by putting a tax upon foreign\r\nproductions.  As this tax does not apply to home production,\r\ntherefore it is a protection against the importation of foreign\r\ngoods to the extent of the tax levied.  We think that this tax\r\nought to be put at such a rate as will give to our people here a\r\nchance to produce the articles and pay a fair return for the\r\ninvestment made and for the labor expended at prices higher in this\r\ncountry than in any country in the world.  That is the first rule,\r\nand I believe that that rule has been carried out, and I think\r\nliberally, and so as to secure increased production at home and a\r\nlarger market.\"\r\n\r\nI am not entirely content with this statement of the position of\r\nthe two great parties, nor do I believe that any line of demarkation\r\nbetween them can be made, nor ought it to be made.  If any proof\r\nof this is required I need only refer to the unhappy result of the\r\ntariff law of the last Congress, which left the country without\r\nsufficient revenue to meet current expenses of the government, and\r\ncaused the absorption for such expenses of the gold reserved for\r\nthe maintenance of resumption, which now endangers our financial\r\nsystem.  I will have occasion to refer to this subject hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe conference report was adopted by the Senate on the 30th of\r\nSeptember by the vote of yeas 33 and nays 27.  The bill was approved\r\nby the President on the 1st of October, and on the same day Congress\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\nMany other measures of importance were considered during this long\r\nsession of ten months, but my space will not allow me to refer to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen in Frankfort, in the summer of 1889, I learned that George H.\r\nPendleton, my former colleague in the Senate and then our minister\r\nin Berlin, was sick at Homburg.  I called upon him there, and,\r\nthough he was able to receive me at his lodgings, I noticed the\r\nmarks of death on his face.  He was cheerful, and still preserved\r\nthe kindly manners that gave him the name of \"Gentleman George.\"\r\nHe still hoped that he would be able to return home, and inquired\r\nin regard to mutual friends, but his hope was delusive and he died\r\non November 24, 1889.  In February, 1890, his body was conveyed to\r\nhis home in Cincinnati and was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery.\r\nI was invited to his funeral but was compelled to decline, which\r\nI did in the following note, which faintly expressed my high respect\r\nand affection for him:\r\n\r\n  \"U. S. Senate,                        }\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., February 26, 1890.}\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Your note of the 24th, in respect to the funeral of\r\nMr. Pendleton, has been received.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, when Mayor Mosby invited me to attend the funeral\r\nceremonies at Cincinnati, I felt both willing and eager to express\r\nmy warm affection and appreciation of my old colleague.  I know no\r\none among the living or the dead of whom I could speak more kindly,\r\nand for whom I felt a more sincere respect; but find that I have\r\nengagements and public duties that I cannot avoid, and, besides,\r\nwhile reasonably well, the lingering effects of the grippe still\r\nhang on me, and my doctor advises against a long and wearisome\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances I felt compelled, though reluctantly, to\r\ntelegraph Mayor Mosby the withdrawal of my acceptance, and proffered\r\nto assist him in every way to find some acceptable person to perform\r\nthe gracious duty assigned to me.  This I will do.  Lengthy orations\r\nin the presence of the dead are out of place and out of time.  A\r\nbrief, warm, hearty, kindly statement of the character and life of\r\nMr. Pendleton is all that is needed.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th day of May, 1890, I reached the age of sixty-seven\r\nyears.  My wife determined to celebrate the event and invited a\r\ndistinguished party, among whom were President Harrison, Vice\r\nPresident Morton, Sir Julian Pauncefote and General Sherman, to\r\ndine with us on the evening of that day, the dinner to be followed\r\nby a general reception.  I was accustomed to pass each milestone\r\nof my journey in life without notice, but as we were both in good\r\nhealth I readily yielded to her wish.  Undue importance was given\r\nby the papers to the social gathering and I received many letters\r\nof congratulation and read many kindly notices in papers representing\r\neach of the two great parties.  I looked upon this as evidence that\r\nI had arrived at that period of life when a difference in political\r\nopinions was no longer regarded as a ground of personal disfavor.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adjournment of Congress I returned to Ohio and\r\nentered actively into the political canvass.  The election was for\r\nsecretary of state and a few state officers, but the chief contest\r\nwas upon the election of Members of Congress.  I made my first\r\nspeech in the Ohio canvass at Wilmington on the 16th of October.\r\nIt was a prepared speech and dealt mainly with the recent acts of\r\nCongress.  I opened with a general comparison of the two great\r\nparties of the country.  The subjects discussed were the trust law,\r\nthe pension legislation, the silver law and the McKinley tariff\r\nlaw.  I defended the latter as a protective measure that, while\r\nreducing taxation, maintained the protection of all American\r\nindustries impartially.  I continued in the canvass diligently,\r\nspeaking almost every day until the election.  Among the largest\r\nmeetings was one at Findlay on the 28th of October and one at Music\r\nHall, Cincinnati, on the 31st, where Governor Foraker and I spoke\r\ntogether.  The meeting at Music Hall was especially notable for\r\nthe number and enthusiasm of those present.\r\n\r\nDuring this canvass, on the 25th of October, I attended a meeting\r\nat the city hall, Pittsburg, which was largely attended.  The chief\r\ninterest in this busy, thriving city was the tariff question, to\r\nwhich I mainly confined my speech.  In opening I said:\r\n\r\n\"While on my way here I wondered what in the world the people of\r\nPittsburg wanted to hear me for--why they should invite a Buckeye\r\nfrom Ohio to talk to them about Republican principles?  This city\r\nof Pittsburg is the birthplace of the Republican party.  Here that\r\ngrand party commenced its series of achievements which have\r\ndistinguished it more than any other party that ever existed in\r\nancient or modern times; because it has been the good fortune of\r\nthe Republican party to confer upon the people of the United States\r\ngreater benefits than were ever conferred by any other political\r\norganization on mortal men.  We have had periods in our existence\r\nwhich demonstrated this.  When, in 1853, you or your ancestors\r\norganized the Republican party, our only object was to resist the\r\nextension of slavery over our western territory.  Afterward, in\r\n1861, the only object of the Republican party was to maintain the\r\nunion of these states, to preserve our country as an inheritance\r\nfor your children and your children's children.  In 1876 the object\r\nof the Republican party was to make good the promises contained in\r\nour notes, and to make all our money as good as gold and silver\r\ncoin.  Now, the great issue between the parties, not so great as\r\nin the past, but still worthy of discussion, is how shall we levy\r\nthe taxes to support the national government?  That is the question\r\nthat is to be discussed mainly to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe mention of the McKinley tariff law was received with immense\r\napplause and cheers.  Continuing, I said:\r\n\r\n\"That bill is very well named.  It is named after Wm. McKinley, a\r\nkind of Pennsylvania-Ohio Dutchman, with a little Scotch-Irish\r\nmixed in him, too--a brilliant neighbor of mine, whom, I am told,\r\nyou have had the pleasure of hearing.  It is true that this bill\r\nwas made up largely of what was called the Senate bill of the year\r\nbefore, and new lines had contributed toward the formation of that\r\nbill; but it was properly named after Mr. McKinley because of his\r\nindomitable pluck, his ability, his energy.\r\n\r\n\"It was pushed through the House after great opposition, because\r\nthe Democrats, as usual, opposed that, as they opposed everything\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nThe election in Ohio resulted in Republican success, Daniel J.\r\nRyan, the head of the ticket, being elected secretary of state by\r\nabout 11,000 majority.\r\n\r\nShortly after the election I was in the city of New York, and was\r\nthere interviewed.  I was reported to have said:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican defeats do not bother me at all, I have seen many\r\nsuch revulsions before and we get around all right again.  It does\r\nus good, we become more active and careful.  It will be all right.\r\n\r\n\"I will cite an instance in my own state, Ohio.  Last year we lost\r\nour governor, this year we carry the state by a splendid majority.\r\nThe Democrats fixed up the congressional districts so we would get\r\nsix Congressmen only, but we got eight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of Major McKinley's election to Congress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Major McKinley is, I fear, defeated, though when I left Ohio it\r\nwas thought that he had succeeded by a small majority.  If he should\r\nhave run in his old district his majority would have been 3,500 or\r\n4,000 against 2,000 received by him two years ago.  But they placed\r\nhim in a district of three Democratic counties and only one Republican\r\ncounty, in which the Democratic majority is upward of 2,000.  It\r\nlooks now as if he is defeated by about 130 votes.  It simply means\r\nthat the major will be the next Governor of Ohio.  He made a splendid\r\ncanvass and a magnificent run, and defeat is not the proper name\r\nfor the result.  Mr. McKinley told me before the election that he\r\ndid not expect to succeed with such odds against him.\r\n\r\n\"As to the general result of the congressional elections, I have\r\nseen such convulsions a dozen times or more, but they have had no\r\npermanent effect.  In 1878, when I was Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwe lost the House and Senate both, but two years later, in 1880,\r\nwe rallied and recovered all that we had lost and elected a Republican\r\nPresident besides.  I do not regard the present situation with\r\napprehension.  The country will be wiser by next year and better\r\nable to pass upon the issues.\"\r\n\r\nThe second session of the 51st Congress met on the 1st of December,\r\n1890.  The annual message of the President dealt with the usual\r\ntopics.  The surplus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890,\r\nincluding the amount applied to the sinking fund, was $105,344,496.\r\nIn referring to the act \"directing the purchase of silver bullion\r\nand the issue of treasury notes thereon,\" approved July 14, 1890,\r\nthe President said:\r\n\r\n\"It has been administered by the Secretary of the Treasury with an\r\nearnest purpose to get into circulation, at the earliest possible\r\ndates, the full monthly amount of treasury notes contemplated by\r\nits provisions, and at the same time to give to the market for\r\nsilver bullion such support as the law contemplates.  The recent\r\ndepression in the price of silver has been observed with regret.\r\nThe rapid rise in price which anticipated and followed the passage\r\nof this act was influenced in some degree by speculation, and the\r\nrecent reaction is in part the result of the same cause and in part\r\nof the recent monetary disturbances.  Some months of further trial\r\nwill be necessary to determine the permanent effect of the recent\r\nlegislation upon silver values, but it is gratifying to know that\r\nthe increased circulation secured by the act has exerted, and will\r\ncontinue to exert, a most beneficial influence upon business and\r\nupon general values.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December I reported, from the committee on finance,\r\na bill to provide against the contraction of the currency, and for\r\nother purposes.  This bill embodied several financial bills on the\r\ncalendar which had been reported by the committee, and it was deemed\r\nbest to include them in a single measure.  The bill was recommitted\r\nand again reported by me on the 23rd of December, when Mr. Stewart\r\ngave notice of and had read an amendment he intended to offer\r\nproviding for the free coinage of silver.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1891, at the expiration of the morning hour, Mr.\r\nStewart moved to proceed to the consideration of this bill.  By a\r\ncombination of seven Republican with the Democratic Senators the\r\nmotion was carried, thus displacing the regular order of business,\r\nwhich was a bill relating to the election of Members of Congress,\r\nand which had been under discussion for several days.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart than offered, as an amendment to the amendment of the\r\ncommittee, then pending, the following provision:\r\n\r\n\"That any owner of silver bullion, not too base for the operations\r\nof the mint, may deposit the same in amount of the value of not\r\nless than $100, at any mint of the United States, to be formed into\r\nstandard dollars or bars, for his benefit and without charge, and\r\nthat, at the said owner's option, he may receive therefor an\r\nequivalent of such standard dollars in treasury notes of the same\r\nform and description, and having the same legal qualities, as the\r\nnotes provided for by the act approved July 14, 1890, entitled,\r\n'An act directing the purchase of silver bullion, and the issue of\r\ntreasury notes thereon, and for other purposes.'  And all such\r\ntreasury notes issued under the provisions of this act shall be a\r\nlegal tender for their nominal amount in payment of all debts,\r\npublic and private, and shall be receivable for customs, taxes,\r\nand all public dues, and when so received may be reissued in the\r\nsame manner, and to the same extent, as other treasury notes.\"\r\n\r\nThis being an amendment to an amendment, no further modification\r\nor change could be made to the bill until it was disposed of.  Mr.\r\nStewart made some remarks, and in conclusion said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend further to comment, at this time, on the amendment\r\nto the bill which I have offered.  If it shall be adopted, then\r\nthere are other portions of the bill which can be stricken out.\r\nThe amendment I have offered presents the question naked and simple.\r\nWill you remonetize silver and place it back where it was before\r\nit was excluded from the mints of the United States and Europe?\"\r\n\r\nI was taken by surprise at the sudden presentation of the question,\r\nbut promptly took the floor and said:\r\n\r\n\"The sudden and unexpected change of the scene, the introduction\r\nof an entirely new topic into our debate, must not pass by without\r\nthe serious and sober attention of every Senator on the floor to\r\nthe revolutionary measure now proposed.  I do not wish to, nor will\r\nI, nor can I, regard this as a political question, because we know\r\nthat the local interests of a certain portion of our number--and\r\nI do not object to Senators representing the interest of their\r\nconstituents--lead them to opinions different from the opinions of\r\nSenators from the larger states containing the great mass of the\r\npopulation of this country, not only in the north, but in the south;\r\nand therefore, while the Republican party may be weakened by the\r\nunexpected defection of a certain portion of our number who agree\r\nwith us in political opinions generally, yet that will not relieve\r\nthe minority in this body, our Democratic associates, from the\r\nsober responsibility which they will assume in aiding in the adoption\r\nof this measure.  At the very outset of this discussion I appealed\r\nto the sober judgment of Senators to consider the responsibility\r\nwhich they take in adopting what I regard as a revolution more full\r\nof injury, more dangerous in its character, and more destructive\r\nin its results, than any measure which has been proposed for years.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what is this question?  The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Stewart],\r\nrepresenting a state whose chief production is silver, offers an\r\namendment to change entirely the standard of valuation of all the\r\nproperty of the United States.  At present all contracts are founded\r\nupon what is called the gold standard.  Every particle of property\r\nwe enjoy, every obligation of contract, whether by the national\r\ngovernment or by each individual, is now based in actual fact upon\r\nthe gold standard of 25.8 grains.  That is the standard of all the\r\ncommercial nations of the world.  It is the standard of France,\r\nwhich, like ourselves, has used silver to a large extent.  It is\r\nthe standard of value of France and every country of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nI then, at considerable length, stated the objections to the free\r\ncoinage of silver and the revolution it would create in the financial\r\ncondition of the country.  This led to a long debate, participated\r\nin by many Senators.  On the 13th of January I made a long and\r\ncarefully considered speech, extending through fourteen pages of\r\nthe \"Record,\" in which I entered into detail in reply to the speeches\r\nthat had been made, and stated the objections to the free coinage\r\nof silver.  It is too long to insert even an abstract of it here.\r\nI have carefully read this speech and refer to it as the first of\r\nthree speeches, the second being delivered on the 30th of June,\r\n1892, and the third on August 30, 1893, as the best presentation\r\nI have ever made of the question involved, and as containing all\r\nthe material facts bearing upon the question of free coinage and\r\nthe folly of its adoption.\r\n\r\nIt was manifest that the combination that had been made intended\r\nto force the adoption of the amendment.  The vote on it was taken\r\non the 14th of January and the result was yeas 42 and nays 30.\r\nNearly all the Senators from the western group of states, though\r\nRepublicans, voted for the amendment in favor of free coinage.\r\nOnly four voted against it.  So the amendment of Mr. Stewart was\r\nagreed to.  The bill was further discussed and changed to conform\r\nto the amendment and finally passed the Senate by the vote of yeas\r\n39, nays 27, but failed to pass the House.\r\n\r\nThus the debate and the adoption by the Senate of free coinage\r\ndefeated all financial legislation during that session.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\nEFFORTS TO CONSTRUCT THE NICARAGUAN CANAL.\r\nEarly Recognition of the Need of a Canal Across the Isthmus\r\nConnecting North and South America--M. de Lesseps Attempts to Build\r\na Water Way at Panama--Feasability of a Route by Lake Nicaragua--\r\nFirst Attempts in 1825 to Secure Aid from Congress--The Clayton-\r\nBulwer Convention of 1850--Hindrance to the Work Caused by This\r\nTreaty--Report of the Committee on Foreign Relations in 1891--\r\nFailure to Secure a Treaty Between the United States and Nicaragua\r\nin 1884--Cleveland's Reasons for Withdrawing This Treaty--Incorporation\r\nof the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua--Inevitable Failure of\r\nTheir Attempts Unless Aided by the Government--Why We Should Purchase\r\nOutright the Concessions of the Maritime Company--Brief Description\r\nof the Proposed Canal--My Last Letter from General Sherman--His\r\nDeath from Pneumonia After a Few Days' Illness--Messages of President\r\nHarrison--Resolution--My Commemorative Address Delivered Before\r\nthe Loyal Legion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important subjects considered by the Senate within\r\nthe last ten years, to which I have given special attention, is\r\nthe construction of a ship canal across Central America.  The\r\nAmerican continents, stretching from the polar regions of the north\r\nto the Straits of Magellan, south of the 50th parallel of south\r\nlatitude, present a barrier to navigation from the east to the\r\nwest, to overcome which has been the anxious desire of mankind ever\r\nsince the discovery of America by Columbus.  It was the object of\r\nhis memorable voyage to find a water way from Spain to China and\r\nIndia.  While his discovery was an event of the greatest importance,\r\nyet it was a disappointment to him, and in all his subsequent\r\nvoyages he sought to find a way through the newly-found land to\r\nthe Indian Ocean.  The spirit of enterprise that was aroused by\r\nhis reports led many adventurers to explore the new world, and\r\nbefore many years the peculiar formation of the long strip of land\r\nconnecting North and South America was clearly defined.  The\r\nSpaniards conquered Mexico and Peru, and at this early period\r\nconceived the idea of a canal across the isthmus, but the obstruction\r\ncould not be overcome by the engineering of that day.  The region\r\nof Central America was soon occupied by Spain, and was divided into\r\nmany colonies, which, in process of time, became independent of\r\nSpain, and of each other.\r\n\r\nDuring the four centuries that have elapsed since the discovery,\r\nthe construction of a canal across the isthmus has been kept in\r\nview, and by common consent the routes at Panama and through Lake\r\nNicaragua have been regarded as the best.  That at Panama is the\r\nshortest, but is impracticable, as was shown by the abortive attempt\r\nof M. de Lesseps.  The route by Lake Nicaragua was early regarded\r\nby the American people as the only adequate, efficient and practicable\r\npassage.  Though burdened with the delays of lockage, it is more\r\npractical, less costly, and more useful than the one at Panama\r\nwould have been, and will accomplish the same object.  When, in\r\n1825, the independence of the republic of Nicaragua was secured,\r\nthat government appealed to the United States for assistance in\r\nexecuting the work of a canal by that route.  Mr. Clay, then\r\nSecretary of State, took an active interest in the subject, and\r\nsaid, in a letter to the commissioners of the United States to the\r\ncongress of Panama:\r\n\r\n\"A canal for navigation between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\r\nshould form a proper subject of consideration at the congress.\r\nThe vast object, if it should ever be accomplished, will be\r\ninteresting in a greater or less degree to all parts of the world;\r\nbut especially to this continent will accrue its greatest benefits;\r\nand to Colombia, Mexico, Central America, Peru, and the United\r\nStates, more than any other of the American nations.\"\r\n\r\nNo action was taken, as the discordant interests of the several\r\nCentral American states prevented.  When California was acquired\r\nas the result of the Mexican War, and gold was discovered in its\r\nsoil, the necessity for some means of speedy transit from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific coast became imperative.  The route by\r\nPanama, being the shortest line across the isthmus, was naturally\r\ntaken by the eager gold seekers and a railroad was soon after\r\nconstructed over this route.  The movement of travel and transportation\r\nacross the isthmus tempted M. de Lesseps and his associates to\r\nundertake the task of constructing a canal, with the result already\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1850 the movements of the British government to seize the\r\ncountry at the mouth of the San Juan River in Nicaragua, with the\r\nevident view of controlling the construction of a canal by way of\r\nLake Nicaragua, excited in this country the deepest interest and\r\napprehension.  This led to the Clayton-Bulwer convention of 1850,\r\nby which the United States and Great Britain stipulated that neither\r\nof the governments \"will ever obtain for itself any exclusive\r\ncontrol over the canal or colonize or assume or exercise any domain\r\nover Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast, or any part of\r\nCentral America.\"\r\n\r\nIt provided for the exertion of the influence of the two governments\r\nin facilitating the construction of the work by every means in\r\ntheir power, and that after completion they would defend its\r\nneutrality, with the privilege of withdrawing such guaranty on\r\nnotice.  It also provided for inviting other governments to come\r\ninto the same arrangement, and that each party should enter into\r\ntreaty stipulations with such of the Central American states as\r\nmight be deemed advisable for carrying out the great design of the\r\nconvention.  It declared that no time should be unnecessarily lost\r\nin commencing and constructing the canal, and, therefore, that the\r\ntwo governments would give their support and encouragement to such\r\npersons as might first offer to commence the same with the necessary\r\ncapital, and that, if any persons then already had obtained the\r\nright to build it from the Central American government and should\r\nfail, each of the two governments should be free to afford its\r\nprotection to any other company that should be prepared to proceed\r\nwith the work.\r\n\r\nThis treaty has given rise to much discussion, and has ever since\r\nbeen a hindrance to the great work it proposed to advance.  The\r\nBritish government has repeatedly violated the treaty by extending\r\nits possessions and strengthening its influence in that part of\r\nthe world.  The report made by me, as chairman of the committee on\r\nforeign relations, on the 10th of January, 1891, in response to a\r\nresolution of the Senate, contains a full statement of the results\r\nof that treaty.  As this report has been widely circulated and was\r\nconsidered an important document, it is but just for me to say\r\nthat, while I presented it, two other members of the committee\r\nparticipated in its preparation.  The first part, relating to\r\nnegotiations, was written by Senator Edmunds; the second part,\r\nrelating to the then condition of the work on the Nicaragua Canal\r\nand its value, tonnage and business, by Senator Morgan; and the\r\nresidue, in respect to the financial aspect of the subject, the\r\ncost of the work proposed and the aid that should be given by the\r\nUnited States in its construction, by me.  The framing of a bill\r\nto carry into effect the recommendations of the committee was the\r\nwork of the full committee.  I do not think it necessary to restate\r\nhere the position of the committee, as no definite action has been\r\ntaken by Congress on the bill reported.  The report was signed by\r\neach member of the committee, as follows:  John Sherman, Chairman,\r\nGeo. F. Edmunds, Wm. P. Frye, Wm. M. Evarts, J. N. Dolph, John T.\r\nMorgan, Joseph E. Brown, H. B. Payne, J. B. Eustis.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, questions connected with this subject which\r\nare of vital interest to the United States, and not presented in\r\nthat report.  By the treaty negotiated in 1884, between the United\r\nStates and Nicaragua, the canal was to be built by the United\r\nStates.  This treaty was sent to the Senate on December 10, 1884,\r\nby President Arthur, who, in strong and earnest language, recommended\r\nits ratification.  It had been frequently debated, but was still\r\npending in the Senate when Mr. Cleveland became President.  I do\r\nnot feel at liberty to state the causes of delay, nor the ground\r\ntaken, nor the votes given either for or against it, as the injunction\r\nof secrecy in respect to it has not been removed, but I have regarded\r\nas a misfortune its practical defeat by the want of a two-thirds\r\nvote, required by the constitution to ratify a treaty.  The terms\r\ngranted in it by Nicaragua were liberal in the broadest sense.\r\nThe complete control of the canal and its appurtenances, and the\r\nmanner of its construction, were invested in the United States.\r\nThe conditions proposed would have made it an international work\r\nof great importance to all commercial nations, while ample authority\r\nwas reserved on the part of the United States to protect its\r\ninvestment with tolls sufficient to pay the interest and refund\r\nthe principal.\r\n\r\nAt the called session of March, 1885, Mr. Cleveland withdrew the\r\ntreaty, not from opposition to its general purposes, but because,\r\nas he stated in his annual message in December, 1885, it was \"coupled\r\nwith absolute and unlimited engagements to defend the territorial\r\nintegrity of the states where such interests lie.\"  He held that\r\nthis clause was an \"entangling alliance inconsistent with the\r\ndeclared policy of the United States.\"  This objection to the treaty\r\ncould have been easily removed by negotiation, as Mr. Bayard, a\r\nMember of the Senate when the treaty was pending, and Secretary of\r\nState under President Cleveland, very well knew.  Thus, by an\r\nunfortunate division in the Senate and the action of the President,\r\nthe construction of the canal by the United States was prevented.\r\nSubsequently, in 1887, concessions were made by Nicaragua and Costa\r\nRica to a private association of citizens of the United States,\r\nwhich led to the incorporation, by Congress, of the Maritime Canal\r\nCompany of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of a private corporation between the United States\r\nand Nicaragua has created all the delays and embarrassments that\r\nhave followed.  Such a corporation can obtain money only be selling\r\nits bonds bearing a high rate of interest, secured by a mortgage\r\nof all its property and concessions, and its stock must accompany\r\nthe bonds.  Experience has shown that such a work cannot be executed,\r\nespecially on foreign soil, without the support and aid of a powerful\r\ngovernment.  If such aid is rendered it must be to the full cost\r\nof the work, and all the benefits should inure to the people and\r\nnot to the corporation or its stockholders.  The experience of the\r\nUnited States in the construction of the Pacific railroads is an\r\nexample of the inevitable result of copartnership.  The attempt of\r\nthe Maritime Company to construct such a work as the Nicaraguan\r\ncanal without the aid of the government will end either in failure\r\nor at a cost, in bonds and stock, the interest of which would be\r\nso great that the cost of the transit of vessels through the canal\r\nwould deter their owners from using it, and goods would be, as now,\r\ntransferred by rail to and from Panama.\r\n\r\nThe method of aiding the Maritime Canal Company proposed in the\r\nbill reported by me, and again recently by Senator Morgan, is as\r\ngood as any that can be devised, but I greatly prefer the direct\r\nand absolute purchase of the concessions of that company, and the\r\nnegotiation of new treaties with Nicaragua and Costa Rica upon the\r\nbasis of the former treaty, and the execution of the work under\r\nthe supervision of the engineer corps of the United States in the\r\nsame manner that internal improvements are made in this country.\r\nThe credit of the United States will secure a loan at the lowest\r\npossible rate of interest, and with money thus obtained, and with\r\nthe confidence of contractors that they will receive their pay for\r\nwork done, the cost will be reduced to the actual sum needed.  It\r\nis the interest of the commercial world as well as of the United\r\nStates that the tolls charged on the passage of vessels should be\r\nas low as possible, and this will be secured by the construction\r\nof the work by the government.\r\n\r\nIf the present owners of the concessions from Nicaragua and Costa\r\nRica will not accept a reasonable price for their privileges and\r\nfor the work done, to be fixed by an impartial tribunal, it is\r\nbetter for the United States to withdraw any offer of aid; but if\r\nthey will accept such an award the United States should take up\r\nthe work and realize the dream and hopes of Columbus.  At present\r\nthe delay of action by Congress grows out of the fact that no\r\ndetailed scientific survey of the route has been made by the engineer\r\ncorps of the United States.  The only approach to such a survey\r\nwas the one made by A. G. Menocal, an accomplished civil engineer\r\nof the navy, but it was felt that this was not sufficient to justify\r\nthe United States in undertaking so great and expensive a work.\r\nIn accordance with this feeling the 53rd Congress directed the\r\nSecretary of War to cause a thorough survey to be made and to submit\r\na full report to the next Congress, to convene December 2, 1895.\r\nThis survey is now in progress and will no doubt largely influence\r\nthe future action of Congress.\r\n\r\nA brief description of the canal proposed may be of interest to\r\nthose who have not studied the geography and topography of its\r\nsite, though it is difficult to convey by writing and without maps\r\nan adequate conception of the work.  It is apparent, according to\r\nMenocal's surveys, that the physical difficulties to be overcome\r\nare not greater than those of works of improvement undertaken within\r\nour own country, for the highest part of the water way is to be\r\nonly 110 feet above the two oceans--a less altitude than that of\r\nthe base of the hills which surround the city of Washington.  The\r\nworks proposed include a system of locks, similar in character to\r\nthe one built by the United States at the falls of Sault Ste. Marie\r\nand to those constructed by Canada around the falls of Niagara.\r\nA single dam across the San Juan River, 1,250 feet long and averaging\r\n61 feet high, between two steep hills, will insure navigable water,\r\nof sufficient depth and width for the commerce of the world, to a\r\nlength of 120 miles.  The approaches to this level, though expensive,\r\nare not different from similar works, and will be singularly\r\nsheltered from floods and storms.  Of the distance of 169.4 miles\r\nfrom ocean to ocean, 142.6 miles are to be accomplished by slack-\r\nwater navigation in lake, river, and basins, and only 26.8 miles\r\nby excavated canal.  The greatest altitude of the ridge which\r\ndivides Lake Nicaragua from the Pacific Ocean does not exceed, at\r\nany point, 42 feet above the lake.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief engineering difficulty is in the construction of\r\nharbors at the Pacific and Atlantic termini of the canal, but that\r\nat Greytown, on the Atlantic coast, which is considered the most\r\nformidable, has already been partially built.  The obstacles are\r\nnot to be compared with those encountered in the attempted construction\r\nof the Panama canal, or with those which were easily overcome in\r\nthe construction of the Suez Canal; and the whole work, from ocean\r\nto ocean, is free from the dangers of moving sand and destroying\r\nfreshets.  Lake Nicaragua itself is one of the most remarkable\r\nphysical features of the world.  It fills a cavity in the midst of\r\na broken chain of mountains, whose height is reduced, at this point,\r\nnearly to the level of the sea, and it furnishes not only the means\r\nof navigation at a low altitude, but enormous advantages as a safe\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nIf the survey ordered and now (1895) being made should confirm the\r\nreports of Menocal there is no reason why the United States should\r\nnot assume and execute this great work without ultimate loss, and\r\nwith enormous benefit to the commerce of the world.  It will be a\r\nmonument to our republic and will tend to widen its influence with\r\nall the nations of Central and South America.\r\n\r\nThe last letter I received from General Sherman was as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"No. 75 West 71st Street, New York,}\r\n  \"Tuesday, February 3, 1891.        }\r\n\"Dear Brother:--I am drifting along in the old rut--in good strength,\r\nattending about four dinners out per week at public or private\r\nhouses, and generally wind up for gossip at the Union League club.\r\nLast night, discussing the effect of Mr. Windom's death and funeral,\r\nseveral prominent gentlemen remarked that Windom's fine speech just\r\npreceding his death was in line with yours on the silver question\r\nin the Senate, and also with a carefully prepared interview of you\r\nby George Alfred Townsend which I had not seen.  I have ordered of\r\nmy book man the New York 'Sun' of Sunday, February 1st, which\r\ncontains the interview.\r\n\r\n\"You sent me a copy of your speech in pamphlet form which was begged\r\nof me, and as others naturally apply for copies, I wish you would\r\nhave your secretary send me a dozen, that I may distribute them.\r\n\r\n\"All well here and send love.\r\n\r\n  \"Your brother,\r\n  \"W. T. Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the receipt of this letter I was notified of the dangerous\r\nillness of my brother at his residence in the city of New York.\r\nI at once went to his bedside, and remained with him until his\r\ndeath, at two o'clock of Saturday, the 14th of February.  In his\r\nlater years, after his removal to New York, he entered into the\r\nsocial life of that city.  He was in demand at weddings, dinners,\r\nparties, reunions of soldiers, and public meetings, where his genial\r\nnature and ready tact, his fund of information and happy facility\r\nof expression, made him a universal favorite.  He was temperate in\r\nhis eating and drinking, but fond of companionship, and always\r\nhappy when he had his old friends and comrades about him.  He\r\nenjoyed the society of ladies, and did not like to refuse their\r\ninvitations to social gatherings.  In conversation with men or\r\nwomen, old or young, he was always interesting.  He was often warned\r\nthat at three score and ten he could not endure the excitement of\r\nsuch a life, and he repeatedly promised to limit his engagements.\r\nEarly in February he exposed himself to the inclement weather of\r\nthat season, and contracted a cold which led to pneumonia, and in\r\na few days to death.  He was perfectly conscious of his condition\r\nand probable fate, but had lost the power of speech and could only\r\ncommunicate his wishes by signs.  His children were with him, and\r\nhundreds daily inquired about him at his door; among them were\r\nsoldiers and widows whom he had aided.\r\n\r\nDuring the last hours of General Sherman, his family, who had been\r\nbred in the Catholic faith, called in a Catholic priest to administer\r\nextreme unction according to the ritual of that church.  The New\r\nYork \"Times,\" of the date of February 13, made a very uncharitable\r\nallusion to this and intimated that it was done surreptitiously,\r\nwithout my knowledge.  This was not true but the statement deeply\r\nwounded the feelings of his children.  I promptly sent to the\r\n\"Times\" the following letter, which was published and received with\r\ngeneral satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\"A paragraph in your paper this morning gives a very erroneous view\r\nof an incident in General Sherman's sick chamber, which wounds the\r\nsensitive feelings of his children, now in deep distress, which,\r\nunder the circumstances, I deem it proper to correct.  Your reporter\r\nintimates that advantage was taken of my temporary absence to\r\nintroduce a Catholic priest into General Sherman's chamber to\r\nadminister the rite of extreme unction to the sick man, in the\r\nnature of a claim that he was a Catholic.  It is well known that\r\nhis children have been reared by their mother, a devoted Catholic,\r\nin her faith, and now cling to it.  It is equally well known that\r\nGeneral Sherman and myself, as well as all my mother's children,\r\nare, by inheritance, education, and connection, Christians, but\r\nnot Catholics, and this has been openly avowed, on all proper\r\noccasions, by General Sherman; but he is too good a Christian, and\r\ntoo humane a man, to deny to his children the consolation of their\r\nreligion.  He was insensible at the time and apparently at the\r\nverge of death, but if he had been well and in the full exercise\r\nof his faculties, he would not have denied to them the consolation\r\nof the prayers and religious observances for their father of any\r\nclass or denomination of Christian priests or preachers.  Certainly,\r\nif I had been present, I would, at the request of the family, have\r\nassented to and reverently shared in an appeal to the Almighty for\r\nthe life here and hereafter of my brother, whether called a prayer\r\nor extreme unction, and whether uttered by a priest or a preacher,\r\nor any other good man who believed what he spoke and had an honest\r\nfaith in his creed.\r\n\r\n\"I hear that your reporter uttered a threat to obtain information\r\nwhich I cannot believe you would for a moment tolerate.  We all\r\nneed charity for our frailties, but I can feel none for anyone who\r\nwould wound those already in distress.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison announced General Sherman's death to both Houses\r\nof Congress in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_  The death of William\r\nTecumseh Sherman, which took place to-day at his residence in the\r\ncity of New York, at 1 o'clock and 50 minutes p. m., is an event\r\nthat will bring sorrow to the heart of every patriotic citizen.\r\nNo living American was so loved and venerated as he.  To look upon\r\nhis face, to hear his name, was to have one's love of country\r\nintensified.  He served his country, not for fame, not out of a\r\nsense of professional duty, but for love of the flag and of the\r\nbeneficent civil institutions of which it was the emblem.  He was\r\nan ideal soldier, and shared to the fullest the _esprit de corps_\r\nof the army; but he cherished the civil institutions organized\r\nunder the constitution, and was a soldier only that these might be\r\nperpetuated in undiminished usefulness and honor.  He was in nothing\r\nan imitator.\r\n\r\n\"A profound student of military science and precedent, he drew from\r\nthem principles and suggestions, and so adapted them to novel\r\nconditions that his campaigns will continue to be the profitable\r\nstudy of the military profession throughout the world.  His genial\r\nnature made him comrade to every soldier of the great Union army.\r\nNo presence was so welcome and inspiring at the camp-fire or\r\ncommandery as his.  His career was complete; his honors were full.\r\nHe had received from the government the highest rank known to our\r\nmilitary establishment, and from the people unstinted gratitude\r\nand love.  No word of mine can add to his fame.  His death has\r\nfollowed in startling quickness that of the Admiral of the Navy;\r\nand it is a sad and notable incident that, when the department\r\nunder which he served shall have put on the usual emblems of\r\nmourning, four of the eight executive departments will be simultaneously\r\ndraped in black, and one other has but to-day removed the crape\r\nfrom its walls\r\n\r\n  \"Benj. Harrison.\r\n\"Executive Mansion, February 14, 1891.\"\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions were offered in the Senate and unanimously\r\nagreed to:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Senate received with profound sorrow the\r\nannouncement of the death of William T. Sherman, late general of\r\nthe armies of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Senate renews its acknowledgments of the\r\ninestimable services he rendered its country in the day of its\r\nextreme trial, laments the great loss the country has sustained,\r\nand deeply sympathizes with his family in their bereavement.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the presiding officer is requested to appoint a\r\ncommittee of five Senators to attend the funeral of the late General\r\nSherman.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the\r\nfamily of the deceased.\"\r\n\r\nEloquent and appropriate speeches were made by Senators Hawley,\r\nManderson, Morgan and Pierce.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives the message of the President was\r\nreferred to the committee on military affairs, for appropriate\r\naction thereon and the following resolutions were reported by Mr.\r\nMcCutcheon and adopted:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the House of Representatives has heard with\r\nprofound sorrow of the death, at his home in New York City, on the\r\n14th instant, of William Tecumseh Sherman, the last of the generals\r\nof the armies of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That we mourn him as the greatest soldier remaining\r\nto the republic and the last of that illustrious trio of generals\r\nwho commanded the armies of the United States--Grant, Sherman, and\r\nSheridan--who shed imperishable glory upon American arms, and were\r\nthe idolized leaders of the Union army.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That we hereby record the high appreciation in which\r\nthe American people hold the character and services of General\r\nSherman, as one of the greatest soldiers of his generation, as one\r\nof the grandest patriots that our country has produced, and as a\r\nnoble man in the broadest and fullest meaning of the word.\r\n\r\n\"We mingle our grief with that of the nation, mourning the departure\r\nof her great son, and of the survivors of the battle-scarred veterans\r\nwhom he led to victory and peace.  We especially tender our sympathy\r\nand condolence to those who are bound to him by the ties of blood\r\nand strong personal affection.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the speaker appoint a committee of nine Members\r\nof the House to attend the funeral of the late general as\r\nrepresentatives of this body.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a copy of these resolution be forwarded by the\r\nclerk of the House to the family of General Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nEloquent tributes were paid to his memory by Messrs. Cutcheon,\r\nGrosvenor, Outhwaite, Henderson, Cogswell, Vandever, Wheeler and\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman had expressed the desire that his body be buried\r\nby the side of his wife in a cemetery in St. Louis.  In February,\r\n1890, on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, the members of\r\nRansom Post, Grand Army of the Republic, of which he was the first\r\ncommander, sent him many congratulatory letters and telegrams.  In\r\nreplying to these, among other things he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I have again and again been urged to allow my name to be transferred\r\nto the roster of some one of the many reputable posts of the Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic in New York, but my invariable answer has been\r\n'no;' that Ransom Post has stood by me since its beginning and I\r\nwill stand by it to my end, and then that, in its organized capacity,\r\nit will deposit my poor body in Calvary Cemetery alongside my\r\nfaithful wife and idolized 'soldier boy.'  My health continues\r\ngood, so my comrades of Ransom Post must guard theirs, that they\r\nmay be able to fulfill this sacred duty imposed by their first\r\ncommander.  God bless you all.\"\r\n\r\nI vividly recall the impressive scene in the city of New York when\r\nhis body was started on its long journey.  The people of the city,\r\nin silence and sadness, filled the sidewalks from 71st to Courtland\r\nstreet, and watched the funeral train, and a countless multitude\r\nin every city, town and hamlet on the long road to St. Louis\r\nexpressed their sorrow and sympathy.  His mortal remains were\r\nreceived with profound respect by the people of that city, among\r\nwhom he had lived for many years, and there he was buried by the\r\nside of his wife and the children who had gone before him.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1892, I was requested, by the New York Commandery of\r\nthe Military Order of the Loyal Legion, to deliver an address\r\ncommemorative of General Sherman.  I did so, on the 6th of April\r\nof that year but, as many of the incidents therein mentioned have\r\nbeen already stated, I only add a few paragraphs from its close:\r\n\r\n\"And here I might end, but there are certain traits and characteristics\r\nof General Sherman upon which I can and ought to speak with greater\r\nknowledge and confidence than of his military career.  He was\r\ndistinguished, first of all, from his early boyhood, for his love\r\nand veneration for, and obedience to, his mother.  There never was\r\na time--since his appointment as a cadet, to her death--that he\r\ndid not insist upon sharing with her his modest pay, and gave to\r\nher most respectful homage and duty.  It is hardly necessary in\r\nthis presence to refer to his devotion to his wife, Ellen Ewing\r\nSherman.  They were born in neighboring households, reared from\r\nchildhood in the same family, early attached and pledged to each\r\nother, married when he reached the grade of captain, shared in\r\naffection and respect the joys and sorrows of life, and paid the\r\nlast debt to nature within a few months of each other.\r\n\r\n\"The same affection and care were bestowed upon his children.  Many\r\nof his comrades will recall the visit of his wife and his son\r\nWillie, a lad of thirteen, at his camp on the Big Black, after the\r\nsurrender of Vicksburg.  Poor Willie believed he was a sergeant in\r\nthe 13th United States Infantry.  He sickened and died at Memphis\r\non his way home.  No one who reads it but will remember the touching\r\ntribute of sorrow his father wrote, a sorrow that was never dimmed,\r\nbut was often recalled while life lasted.\r\n\r\n\"General Sherman always paid the most respectful attention to women\r\nin every rank and condition of life--the widow and the orphan, the\r\nyoung and the old.  While he was often stern and abrupt to men, he\r\nwas always kind and gentle to women, and he received from them the\r\nhomage they would pay to a brother.  His friendship for Grant I\r\nhave already alluded to, but it extended in a lesser degree to all\r\nhis comrades, especially those of West Point.  No good soldier in\r\nhis command feared to approach him to demand justice, and everyone\r\nreceived it if in his power to grant it.  He shared with them the\r\nhardships of the march and the camp, and he was content with the\r\nsame ration given to them.  Simple in his habits, easy of approach,\r\nconsiderate of their comfort, he was popular with his soldiers,\r\neven while exacting in his discipline.  The name of 'Uncle Billy,'\r\ngiven to him by them, was the highest evidence of their affection.\r\n\r\n\"He was the most unselfish man I ever knew.  He did not seek for\r\nhigh rank, and often expressed doubts of his fitness for high\r\ncommand.  He became a warm admirer of Abraham Lincoln as the war\r\nprogressed, and more than once expressed to him a desire for\r\nsubordinate duty.  He never asked for promotion, but accepted it\r\nwhen given.  His letters to me are full of urgent requests for the\r\npromotion of officers who rendered distinguished service, but never\r\nfor his own.  When the bill for the retirement of officers at the\r\nage of sixty-three was pending, he was excepted from its operation.\r\nHe telegraphed me, insisting that no exception should be made in\r\nhis favor, that General Sheridan should have the promotion and rank\r\nof general, which he had fairly earned.  This was granted, but\r\nCongress with great kindness continued to General Sherman the full\r\npay of a general when he was placed on the retired list.\r\n\r\n\"In his business relations he was bound by a scrupulous sense of\r\nhonor and duty.  I never knew of him doing anything which the most\r\nexacting could say was dishonorable, a violation of duty or right.\r\nI could name many instances of this trait, which I will not, but\r\none or two cases will suffice.  When a banker in California, several\r\nof his old army friends, especially from the south, trusted him\r\nwith their savings for investment.  He invested their money in good\r\nfaith in what were considered the very best securities in California,\r\nbut when Page, Bacon & Co., and nearly every banker in San Francisco,\r\nfailed in 1855, all securities were dishonored, and many of them\r\nbecame worthless.  General Sherman, though not responsible in law\r\nor equity for a loss that common prudence could not foresee, yet\r\nfelt that he was 'in honor' bound to secure from loss those who had\r\nconfided in him, and used for that purpose all, or nearly all, of\r\nhis own savings.\r\n\r\n\"So, in the settlements of his accounts in Louisiana, when he had\r\nthe entire control of expenditures, he took the utmost care to see\r\nthat every dollar was accounted for.  He resigned on the 18th of\r\nJanuary, and waited until the 23rd of February for that purpose.\r\nThe same exact accountability was practiced by him in all accounts\r\nwith the United States.  In my personal business relations with\r\nhim, I found him to be exact and particular to the last degree,\r\ninsisting always upon paying fully every debt, and his share of\r\nevery expense.  I doubt if any man living can truly say that General\r\nSherman owes him a dollar, while thousands know he was generous in\r\ngiving in proportion to his means.  He had an extreme horror of\r\ndebt and taxes.  He looked upon the heavy taxes now in vogue as in\r\nthe nature of confiscation, and in some cases sold his land, rapidly\r\nrising in value, because the taxes assessed seemed to him\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\n\"While the war lasted, General Sherman was a soldier intent upon\r\nputting down what he conceived to be a causeless rebellion.  He\r\nsaid that war was barbarism that could not be refined, and the\r\nspeediest way to end it was to prosecute it with vigor to complete\r\nsuccess.  When this was done, and the Union was saved, he was for\r\nthe most liberal terms of conciliation and kindness to the southern\r\npeople.  All enmities were forgotten; his old friendships were\r\nrevived.  Never since the close of the war have I heard him utter\r\nwords of bitterness against the enemies he fought, nor of the men\r\nin the north who had reviled him.\r\n\r\n\"To him it was a territorial war; one that could not have been\r\navoided.  Its seeds had been planted in the history of the colonies,\r\nin the constitution itself, and in the irrepressible conflict\r\nbetween free and slave institutions.  It was a war by which the\r\nsouth gained, by defeat, enormous benefits, and the north, by\r\nsuccess, secured the strength and development of the republic.  No\r\npatriotic man of either section would willingly restore the old\r\nconditions.  Its benefits are not confined to the United States,\r\nbut extend to all the countries of America.  Its good influence\r\nwill be felt by all the nations of the world, by opening to them\r\nthe hope of free institutions.  It is one of the great epochs in\r\nthe march of time, which, as the years go by, will be, by succeeding\r\ngenerations of freemen, classed in importance with the discovery\r\nof America and our Revolutionary War.  It was the good fortune of\r\nGeneral Sherman to have been a chief actor in this great drama,\r\nand to have lived long enough after its close to have realized and\r\nenjoyed the high estimate of his services by his comrades, by his\r\ncountrymen, and by mankind.  To me, his brother, it is a higher\r\npride to know and to say that in all the walks of private life--as\r\na son, a brother, a husband, a father, a soldier, a comrade, or a\r\nfriend--he was an honorable gentleman, without fear and without\r\nreproach.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF 1890-91 IN OHIO.\r\nPublic Discussion of My Probable Re-election to the Senate--My\r\nVisit to the Ohio Legislature in April, 1891--Reception at the\r\nLincoln League Club--Address to the Members--Appointed by the\r\nRepublicans as a Delegate to the State Convention at Columbus--Why\r\nMy Prepared Speech Was Not Delivered--Attack on Me by the Cincinnati\r\n\"Enquirer\"--Text of the Address Printed in the \"State Journal\"--\r\nBeginning of a Canvass with Governor Foraker as a Competitor for\r\nthe Senatorship--Attitude of George Cox, a Cincinnati Politician,\r\nTowards Me--Attempt to Form a \"Farmers' Alliance\" or People's Party\r\nin Ohio--\"Seven Financial Conspiracies\"--Mrs. Emery's Pamphlet and\r\nMy Reply to It.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1890-91 the question of my re-election to the\r\nSenate was the subject of newspaper discussion not only in Ohio,\r\nbut in other states.  As a rule the leading newspapers in the\r\neastern states strongly favored my return to the Senate, and much\r\nthe larger number of Republican papers in Ohio expressed the same\r\ndesire.  In the west, wherever the free coinage of silver was\r\nfavored, a strong opposition to me was developed.  I had not\r\nexpressed any wish or intention to be a candidate and turned aside\r\nany attempt to commit me on the subject.  I could quote by the\r\nscore articles in the public prints of both political parties highly\r\ncomplimentary to me, but most of these turned upon free coinage of\r\nsilver, which I did not regard as a political issue.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of Congress on the 4th of March the Cincinnati\r\n\"Enquirer\" formally announced, as \"upon the assurance of the Senator\r\nhimself,\" that I would not again be a candidate for re-election.\r\nThe next day that paper repeated that a well-known Sherman man,\r\nwhose name was not given, said:  \"Your article is correct.  Mr.\r\nSherman is not, nor will he be again, a candidate for the Senate.\"\r\nBoth declarations were without foundation, and I supposed the\r\nintention of the \"Enquirer\" was to force a contest among Republicans\r\nfor the nomination.  I paid no attention to these publications,\r\nbut they were the basis of comment in the newspapers in Ohio.  The\r\ndiscussion of this question extended to other states, and indicated\r\nthe desire of a large majority of the papers, east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, that I be re-elected.  I insert an extract from a long\r\narticle in the Chicago \"Inter-Ocean\" of the 22nd of March, 1891:\r\n\r\n\"The most important event looked for in 1892 is that of a successor\r\nto John Sherman in Ohio, and already the matter is being discussed,\r\nas well it might be, and the interest is by no means confined to\r\nthat state.  John Sherman belongs to the whole country, and it is\r\nno reflection upon the usefulness of any other public man to say\r\nthat his retirement to private life would be the greatest strictly\r\npersonal loss the nation could now maintain.\"\r\n\r\nI do not care to quote the many kindly opinions expressed of me at\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nI returned to Ohio early in April on a brief visit to Mansfield,\r\nand to pay my respects to the general assembly, then in session at\r\nColumbus.  At Mansfield I was met by a correspondent of the \"Enquirer\"\r\nand answered a multitude of questions.  Among others I was asked\r\nif I would respond to the call of the members of the Ohio legislature\r\nto meet them at Columbus.  I answered:  \"Yes, I will go to Columbus\r\non Tuesday next, and from there to Washington, to return here with\r\nmy family in May for the summer.\"  He said:  \"Is there any significance\r\nin this Columbus visit?\"  I answered:  \"None whatever so far as I\r\nknow.\"  In leaving he said:  \"Tell me, did your trip here at this\r\ntime have any reference to your fences, their building or repair?\"\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"I came here to build a barn.  I am just about to\r\ncommence it.\"  He bade me good-bye without saying a word about my\r\ndeclining or being elected as Senator.\r\n\r\nI went to Columbus on the 7th, arriving late in the evening, but\r\nnot too late to meet many gentlemen and to give to a correspondent\r\nof the \"Commercial Gazette\" an interview.  On the next day, in\r\npursuance of a custom that has existed in Ohio for many years, I,\r\nas a Senator elected by the legislature, was expected to make a\r\nformal call upon that body when in session, and during my visit to\r\neschew politics.  Accompanied by a committee of the senate I called\r\nupon Governor Campbell.  We were then and had always been personal\r\nfriends.  He accompanied me to the senate, which took a recess,\r\nwhen brief and complimentary addresses were made, and I thanked\r\nthe senate for the reception.  After handshaking and pleasant talk\r\nI was escorted to the house of representatives, where the same\r\nsimple ceremony was observed.  I visited the state board of\r\nequalization, then engaged in the important duty of equalizing the\r\ntaxes imposed in the several counties and cities of the state.  At\r\ntheir request I expressed my opinion of the system of taxation in\r\nexistence in Ohio, which I regarded as exceedingly defective by\r\nreason of restrictive clauses in the constitution of the state\r\nadopted in 1851.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of this day I was invited to a reception at the\r\nLincoln League club.  I insert the report published the next morning\r\nin the \"State Journal.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reception to Senator John Sherman at the Lincoln League club\r\nrooms last night was a rousing enthusiastic affair.  The rooms were\r\ncrowded with members of the league and their friends, while most\r\nof the state officials, members of the general assembly and the\r\nstate board of equalization were present.  Several Democrats were\r\nconspicuous in the crowd, and all parties, old men and young, vied\r\nwith each other in doing honor to Ohio's great statesman.  During\r\nthe evening Governor Campbell, accompanied by his daughter, came\r\nin to pay his respects to the distinguished guest and was cordially\r\nreceived.  He was called upon for a speech and responded briefly\r\nin his usual happy vein.  He expected to meet with the Republicans\r\nthis fall again and would assist at some one's obsequies, but just\r\nwhose it would be he did not know.\r\n\r\n\"During the short visit the governor's daughter was the recipient\r\nof marked attention, and divided honors with her father in\r\nhandshaking.\r\n\r\n\"The feature of the evening was the welcome accorded Senator Sherman\r\nand his speech.  Everybody was eager to shake hands with him, and\r\nfor over an hour he was so engaged.\r\n\r\n\"He was introduced by President Huling in his usual happy manner,\r\nand responded feelingly in a short speech, which was received with\r\nenthusiasm.  Senator Sherman said:\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen:--I appear before you to-night, not as a partisan, not\r\nas a Republican, although I do not deny my fraternity, nor as a\r\nDemocrat, but simply as a native son of Ohio.  My friend has made\r\na very eloquent speech to you, but I have come to greet you all,\r\nto thank you for the support that has been extended to me by the\r\npeople of Ohio, not only by those of my political faith, but also\r\nthose who have differed from me.  I have often been brought in\r\ncontact with Democrats whom I cherish as my friends.  You all know\r\nyour honored and venerable statesman, Allen G. Thurman.  We differed\r\non political issues, but we never quarreled with each other.  When\r\nany question affecting the interests or prosperity of Ohio was\r\nconcerned we were like two brothers aiding each other.  When we\r\ncame to discuss political questions, upon which parties divided,\r\nwe put on our armor.  I knew that if I made the slightest error,\r\nhe would pick me up and handle me as roughly as anyone else, and\r\nhe expected the same of me.  And so with Mr. Pendleton, who is now\r\ndead.  I regarded him as one of the most accomplished men I ever\r\nmet; always kind, always genial, possessing all the attributes of\r\na gentleman.  When discussing any question affecting the interest\r\nor honor of Ohio there was no difference of opinion between us.\r\nWhen I met him a short time before his death, at Homburg, I felt\r\nthat I would not see him again.  In politics there ought to be\r\nkindness and fairness.  Men of adverse opinions may be true friends\r\nwhile they honestly differ on great public questions.\r\n\r\n'Now, gentlemen, I think I have said all I ought to say.  This is\r\na social meeting and, as I understand it, you came here to greet\r\nme as one of your public servants.  I wish to express my obligations\r\nto the people of Ohio for their generosity and for their long-\r\ncontinued support.  I am glad indeed to greet you and give you a\r\ngood Buckeye greeting.  All I can do is to thank you.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June I was appointed by the Republicans of Richland\r\ncounty as a delegate to the state convention.  In a brief speech\r\nto the county convention, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The next state convention will be a very important one in many\r\nrespects.  In one or two matters the business has already been done.\r\nIt has been settled that Major McKinley will be nominated Governor\r\nof Ohio, and that he will be elected.  Of the balance of the ticket\r\nI say nothing.  There are so many good men for candidates that we\r\ncan make no mistake in any of them.\"\r\n\r\nResolutions were adopted indorsing the platforms of the last state\r\nand national conventions, declaring a belief in the doctrine of\r\nprotection to labor and American industries, and indorsing the\r\nwisdom of the Republican party in continuing the advocacy of the\r\nprotective tariff.  I was remembered by resolutions thanking me\r\nfor services rendered to the country, and Senators W. S. Kerr and\r\nW. Hildebrand were complimented for their efficiency in the state\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nA resolution indorsing William McKinley for unanimous nomination\r\nfor governor passed amidst enthusiastic applause.\r\n\r\nUpon attending the state convention at Columbus, on the 17th of\r\nJune, I was advised that objection would be made to my designation\r\nas chairman, and that Mr. Bushnell would be pressed for that honor.\r\nI promptly said I did not wish the position, and urged the selection\r\nof Bushnell, who was fairly entitled to it for his active agency\r\nas chairman of the state committee.  The central committee had\r\ninvited me to address the convention, and I was prepared to do so,\r\nbut, feeling that after McKinley was unanimously nominated for\r\ngovernor my speech would delay the convention in completing the\r\nticket, I declined to speak, but the convention insisted upon it,\r\nand I did respond very briefly, saying I would hand my speech to\r\nthe \"State Journal.\"  Out of this incident the \"Enquirer\" made the\r\nstory that I had been \"snubbed\" by the convention, through the\r\ninfluence of Governor Foraker and other gentlemen named by it.\r\nThe correct account of my action was stated in the \"State Journal\"\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"After Major McKinley had finished speaking there were enthusiastic\r\ncalls for Senator Sherman.  The demand became so vigorous that\r\nGeneral Bushnell was unable to secure quiet.  Senator Sherman\r\nmarched down the middle aisle from his seat in his delegation just\r\nunder the balcony.  Perhaps no one received such generous recognition\r\nas did the senior Senator from Ohio.  Although Senator Sherman had\r\nprepared a speech he did not attempt to deliver it.  He said he\r\nhad intended to insist on his right as a delegate not to hear any\r\nmore oratory, but, to proceed with the business of the convention.\r\nHe gave the 'State Journal' an appreciated compliment by advising\r\nall the delegates who desired to know what his speech contained to\r\nbuy this morning's 'State Journal.'  His remarks were felicitous\r\nand he was frequently interrupted by applause.\"\r\n\r\nThe prepared speech as published in the \"Journal\" gave satisfaction,\r\nnot only to the Republicans in Ohio, but was printed in many of the\r\nleading journals of the United States.  My refusal to deliver it\r\nin the sweltering heat of the convention enabled that body to\r\nrapidly clear the business it met to transact, and the unfounded\r\nimputations about leading Republicans fell harmless.  I insert this\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n\"My Fellow Republicans:--When I was invited with others to address\r\nthis convention, I felt that the best speech that could be made\r\nwas the convention itself.  You are here to speak the voice of Ohio\r\nin the choice of the chief officers of the state and to announce\r\nthe creed of a great party.  Such bodies as this are the convenient\r\nagencies of a free people to mark out the line of march and to\r\nselect their leaders.\r\n\r\n\"When I look upon this great body of representative Republicans,\r\nanimated by a common purpose and inspired by a common faith in the\r\nparty to which we belong, my mind instinctively reverts to the\r\nfirst Republican convention of Ohio, held in this city thirty-six\r\nyears ago.  Then, under the impulse of a great wrong--the repeal\r\nof the restriction of slavery north and west of Missouri--that\r\nconvention, remarkable in numbers and ability, composed of\r\nrepresentatives of all parties then in existence, pledged themselves,\r\nthat come what may, they would resist the extension of slavery over\r\nevery foot of territory where it was not then established by law.\r\nThere was no doubt or hesitation or timidity in their resolution,\r\nthough they knew they were entering into a contest with an enemy\r\nthat had never been defeated, that had dominated all parties, and\r\nwould resist to the uttermost, even to war, any attempt to curb\r\nthe political power of the most infamous institution that ever\r\nexisted among men.  This was the beginning of the Republican party.\r\n\r\n\"It was also the beginning of the most remarkable events of American\r\nhistory.  Since that day the Republican party has abolished slavery,\r\nnot only in the United States, but, by its reflected influence, in\r\nnearly all the countries of the world.  It has conducted a war of\r\ngigantic proportions with marked success, demonstrating in the\r\nstrongest way the ability of a free people to maintain and preserve\r\nits government against all enemies, at home and abroad.  It has\r\nestablished the true theory of national authority over every citizen\r\nof the republic, without regard to state lines, and has forever\r\nput at rest the pretense of the right of secession by a state or\r\nany portion of our people.  It has placed our country, in its\r\nrelations to foreign nations, in so commanding a position that none\r\nwill seek a controversy with us, while empires and kingdoms profit\r\nby our example.  It has, for the necessities of the time and the\r\nwarnings and follies of the past, marked out a financial system\r\nwhich secures us a currency safe beyond all possibility of loss,\r\na coinage of silver and gold received at par in every commercial\r\nmart of the world, and a public credit equal, if not superior, to\r\nthat of the oldest, richest and most powerful nations.  It has, by\r\na policy of fostering and protecting our home industries, so\r\ndiversified our productions that every article of necessity, luxury,\r\nart or refinement can be made by American labor, and the food and\r\nfruits of a temperate climate, and cotton, wool and all the textile\r\nfibres, can be raised on the American farm.\r\n\r\n\"Under Republican policy, sometimes embarrassed but never changed,\r\nour country has become _free_, without a slave; strong, without\r\nstanding armies or great navies; rich, with wealth better distributed,\r\nlabor better paid, and equality of rights better secured, than in\r\nany country in the world.  All the opportunities of life, without\r\ndistinction of birth or rank or wealth, are open to all alike.\r\nEducation is free, without money or price.  Railroads, telegraphs\r\nand all the wonderful devices of modern civilization are at our\r\ncommand.  Many of these blessings are the natural results of our\r\nfree institutions, the work of our fathers, but they have been in\r\nevery case promoted and fostered by the policy of the Republican\r\nparty.  We, therefore, can honestly claim that our party has been\r\na faithful servant of the people and is fairly entitled to their\r\nconfidence and support.\r\n\r\n\"But we do not rest our claims upon this fact alone.  We do not\r\nneed to muster the great names that have marched at the head of\r\nour columns to their final rest to invoke your approval.  We invite\r\nthe strictest scrutiny into the conduct of the present Republican\r\nadministration of Benjamin Harrison.  He was not as well known to\r\nthe people at large, at the time of his election, as many former\r\nPresidents, for the politics of Indiana do not give a Republican\r\nof that state a fair chance to demonstrate his capacity and ability,\r\nbut my intimate acquaintance and companionship with him, sitting\r\nside by side for six years in the Senate Chamber, impressed me with\r\nthe high intellectual and moral traits which he has exhibited in\r\nhis great office.\r\n\r\n\"The issues now involved are not so great and pressing as in the\r\ndays of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant, but they do directly\r\naffect the life, comfort and happiness of every citizen of the\r\nUnited States.  The recent Republican Congress, in connection with\r\nPresident Harrison, has dealt with all leading domestic questions\r\nof the time and with the most important questions with foreign\r\nnations.  Every one of these has either been settled or is in the\r\nway of settlement.\r\n\r\n\"The administration of Mr. Cleveland settled nothing but the sublime\r\negotism of Mr. Cleveland, his opposition to the protection policy,\r\nhis want of sympathy for the Union soldiers and his narrow notions\r\nof finance and the public credit.  He devised nothing and accomplished\r\nnothing.  A Democratic House passed the Mills tariff bill, but it\r\nwas rejected by the Senate and by the people in the election of\r\n1888.  It was neither a protective tariff nor a revenue tariff,\r\nbut a mongrel affair made up of shreds and patches furnished here\r\nand there by Democratic Members to suit their local constituencies.\r\nThis abortive measure was the only one of any mark or importance\r\nproposed by Mr. Cleveland, or passed by a Democratic House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\"In marked contrast with this is the Republican administration of\r\nHarrison and the recent Republican Congress.  Mr. Harrison, with\r\nthe slow, thoughtful, conservative tendencies of his mind, gave\r\ncareful consideration to every proposition that came before him,\r\nand announced his opinion in his messages to Congress.  The House\r\nof Representatives, having cleared the way by the decision and\r\ncourage of Speaker Tom Reed that the majority should rule, proceeded\r\nto transact the public business, and the Senate, in hearty concurrence\r\nand co-operation, acted upon every important measure pending before\r\nCongress.  The first in importance, though not in point of time,\r\nwas an entire revision of our revenue laws.  This bill was subjected\r\nto the most careful scrutiny in both Houses, and was passed as a\r\nRepublican measure, and approved by the President.  It is the law\r\nof the land, though some of its provisions have not yet taken\r\neffect.  It is, in my judgment, a wise law, and will bear the most\r\ncareful scrutiny.  It may be that in its details, in the rates of\r\nduty, the precise line between enough to protect and more than is\r\nnecessary, is not observed, but this error in detail does not weaken\r\nthe essential merits of this great measure.  I do not intend to\r\ndiscuss it in the presence of a gentleman now before me, who had\r\ncharge of the bill in the House, who is, in a great measure, the\r\nauthor of it, and whose effective advocacy carried it over the\r\nshoals and rocks in the House of Representatives.  You will greatly\r\nand justly honor him this day, but not more than he deserves, and\r\nyou will have a chance to hear from him as to its merits.  It is\r\nsufficient now for me to state, very briefly, why I heartily\r\nsupported it in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place it is a clear-cut, effective measure that will\r\nmake explicit the rates of duties proposed; will prevent, as far\r\nas the law can, any evasion or undervaluation.  It is in every line\r\nand word a protective tariff.  It favors, to the extent of the\r\nduty, the domestic manufacturer, and will induce the production\r\nhere of every article suited to our condition and climate.  It is\r\na fair law, for it extends its benefits not only to the artisan,\r\nbut, to the farmer and producer in every field of employment.  I\r\nknow, by my long experience in passing upon tariff bills, that the\r\nMcKinley bill more carefully and beneficially protects the farmer\r\nin his productions than any previous measures of the kind.  And\r\nits inevitable effect in encouraging manufactures will give to the\r\nfarmer the best possible market for his crops.  The bill has\r\nreceived, and will bear, discussion, and will improve on acquaintance.\r\nThe new features of the bill relating to sugar and tin plate will\r\nsoon demonstrate the most satisfactory results.  Sugar will be\r\ngreatly lowered in cost to the consumer, while the bounty given to\r\nthe domestic producer will soon establish the cultivation of beet\r\nand sorghum sugar in the United States, as the same policy has done\r\nin Germany and France.  The increased duty soon to be put upon tin\r\nplate will develop, and has already developed, tin mines in several\r\nstates and territories, so that we may confidently hope that in a\r\nshort period we will be sweetened by untaxed home sugar, and\r\nprotected by untaxed tin plate.  The arts of the demagogue, which\r\nwere at the last election played upon the credulous to deceive them\r\nas to the effects of the McKinley bill, will return to plague the\r\ninventors, and this Republican measure, with its kindred measures,\r\nreciprocity and fair play to American ships, will be among the\r\nboasted triumphs of our party, in which our Democratic friends\r\nwill, as usual, heartily acquiesce.\r\n\r\n\"There is another question in which the people are vitally interested,\r\nand that is the currency question.  They want good money and plenty\r\nof it.  They want all their money of equal value, so that a dollar\r\nwill be the same whether it is made of gold or silver or paper.\r\nWe have had this kind of money since the resumption of specie\r\npayments in January, 1879.  Nobody wants to go back to the old\r\ncondition of things when it was gold to the bondholders and paper\r\nto the pensioners.  When the outstanding government bonds were\r\nfifteen hundred millions, and banks could issue paper money upon\r\nthe deposit of bonds, the volume of currency could expand upon the\r\nincrease of business.  But that condition is passing away.  The\r\nbonds are being paid, and the time is coming, and has come, when\r\nthe amount of bonds is so reduced and their value is so increased\r\nthat banks cannot afford to buy bonds upon which to issue circulating\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n\"We must contemplate the time when the national banks will not\r\nissue their notes, but become banks of discount and deposit.  The\r\nbanks are evidently acting upon this theory, for they have voluntarily\r\nlargely reduced their circulation.  How shall this currency be\r\nreplaced?  Certainly not by the notes of state banks.  No notes\r\nshould circulate as money except such as have the sanction, authority\r\nand guarantee of the United States.  The best for of these is\r\ncertificates based upon gold and silver of value equal to the notes\r\noutstanding.  Nor should any distinction be made between gold and\r\nsilver.  Both should be received at their market value in the\r\nmarkets of the world.  Their relative value varies from day to day\r\nand there is no power strong enough to establish a fixed ratio of\r\nvalue except the concurrence of the chief commercial nations of\r\nthe world.  We coin both metals at a fixed ratio, but we maintain\r\nthem at par with each other by limiting the amount of the cheaper\r\nmetal to the sum needed for subsidiary coin and receiving and\r\nredeeming it.\r\n\r\n\"The demand for the free coinage of silver without limit, is a\r\ndemand that the people of the United States shall pay for silver\r\nbullion more than its market price; a demand that is not and ought\r\nnot to be made by the producer of any commodity.  There is no\r\njustice or equity in it.  If granted by the United States alone it\r\nwill demonetize gold and derange all the business transactions of\r\nour people.  What we ought to do, and what we now do under the\r\nsilver law of the last Congress, a conservative Republican measure,\r\nis to buy the entire product of silver mined in the United States\r\nat its market value, and, upon the security of that silver deposited\r\nin the treasury, issue treasury notes to the full amount of the\r\ncost of the bullion.  In this way we add annually to our national\r\ncurrency circulating notes of undoubted value, equal to gold to an\r\namount equal to or greater than the increase of our population and\r\nthe increasing business for our growing country.\r\n\r\n\"There is another measure to which the Republican party is bound\r\nby every obligation of honor and duty, and that is to grant to the\r\nUnion soldiers of the late war, their widows and orphans, liberal\r\npensions for their sacrifices and services in the preservation of\r\nthe Union.  In the language of Lincoln, 'To bind up the nation's\r\nwounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for\r\nhis widow and his orphan.'  Impressed with this obligation, the\r\nRepublican party has gone as far as prudence will allow.  We\r\nappropriate $135,000,000 a year for this purpose.  Though the sum\r\nis large, it is not the measure of our obligation.  The rising\r\ngeneration who will bear this burden must remember the immeasurable\r\nblessings they enjoy by the sacrifices and services of Union soldiers\r\nin the preservation of the Union and in a strong republican government\r\nand free institutions.\r\n\r\n\"There is another obligation which we, as Republicans, cannot ignore\r\nwithout being false to our party pledges, and that is to use every\r\nlegal means to secure all citizens their constitutional rights and\r\nprivileges as such, without respect to race and color.  Fortunately,\r\ntime is promoting this great duty, but it must never be forgotten\r\nor neglected until every lawful voter shall freely exercise his\r\nright to vote without discrimination or favor.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the time for a fuller discussion of the many political\r\nquestions which will enter into the canvass.  The great tribunal\r\nof the people must pass upon them in their assemblages.  I hope we\r\nwill go back to the old-fashioned mass meetings in the beautiful\r\ngroves of our state, where old and young, women as well as men,\r\ncan gather together with their baskets well-filled, their minds\r\nopen to conviction, their hearts full of patriotism, to listen and\r\njudge for themselves the path of duty, the lines of wisdom, the\r\nproper choice between the parties claiming their suffrages.\r\nFortunately, there is now no bitterness between parties, nothing\r\nthat can justify abuse, or reproach, for we must all concede the\r\nhonesty and desire of members of all parties to do what is best\r\nfor the common good.  We must not meet as farmers, mechanics, or\r\npartisans, but as fellow-citizens and patriots, alike interested\r\nin all measures of national or state legislation.  If any public\r\nmeasure bears unjustly upon any class of our population we are all\r\ninterested in providing a remedy.  The farmers of our country\r\nsometimes complain that they do not share in the common prosperity,\r\nthat the prices they receive for their products are too low, that\r\nthey pay more than their share of the taxes.\r\n\r\n\"So far as these complaints may be met by wise legislation it should\r\nbe done by Congress and our state legislature.  The Republican\r\nparty is wise enough and liberal enough to meet the just demands\r\nof all classes, and, especially, of the farmers, the great conservative\r\nand controlling portion of our population, and they are patriotic\r\nenough not to demand measures not sanctioned by reason and experience,\r\nand not consistent with the common good or the credit and honor of\r\nour country.  The Republican party has shown its capacity to deal\r\nwisely with many more difficult questions of the past, and may be\r\nrelied upon to solve wisely the questions of a peaceful and prosperous\r\nfuture.  Strong now at home our country may extend its moral\r\ninfluence to neighboring republics, encourage trade and intercourse\r\nwith them, and invite a broader union founded upon common interests,\r\nsympathies, and free institutions.\r\n\r\n\"The State of Ohio is an important factor in this great union of\r\nstates and people.  Ohio is a Republican state, one that has taken\r\na conspicuous part in the great drama of the past.  In an evil\r\nhour, and under wild delusions, Ohio elected the recent Democratic\r\nlegislature.  With this warning behind us let us not be backward\r\nor laggard in the civic contest in November; but, with a ticket\r\nworthy of our choice, let us appeal to our fellow-citizens to place\r\nagain our honored state at the head of the Republican column.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the statement in the \"Enquirer\" and in other Democratic papers\r\nwas not, in my opinion, true, yet the charge of a purpose on the\r\npart of the members of the convention to humiliate or \"snub\" me,\r\nby inviting me to address the convention and then denying me the\r\nopportunity, led to a very general popular discussion of the\r\nselection of United States Senator by the legislature then to be\r\nelected.  The choice seemed, by general acquiescence, to rest\r\nbetween Governor Foraker and myself in case the Republicans should\r\nhave a majority of the legislature.  There could be no difference\r\nas to the weight of public opinion outside of Ohio, as represented\r\nby the leading journals of both political parties.  Even such\r\nindependent papers as the Chicago \"Evening Post,\" the \"Boston\r\nHerald,\" the Springfield (Massachusetts) \"Republican\" and the New\r\nYork \"Evening Post,\" and I can say the great body of the Republican\r\njournals in the State of Ohio, warmly urged my re-election.  With\r\nthis general feeling prevailing I considered myself a candidate,\r\nwithout any announcement, and entered into the canvass as such.\r\nI also regarded Governor Foraker as my competitor fairly entitled\r\nto aspire to the position of Senator, though he did not, at first,\r\npublicly announce his candidacy.  Young, active and able, with a\r\nbrilliant military record vouched for by General Sherman, twice\r\nelected Governor of Ohio, he was justified in entering the contest.\r\nIn the latter part of June he was reported to have said that I\r\nwould be re-elected, but this was regarded in a Pickwickian sense.\r\nCandidates for the legislature were chosen in many counties according\r\nto senatorial preferences, but, so far as I recall, there was no\r\ncontest over such nominations bitter enough to cause the defeat of\r\nany nominee.\r\n\r\nNo serious difficulty arose until the latter part of July, when I\r\nwas advised that George B. Cox, a well-known politician in Cincinnati,\r\nwho, it was understood, controlled the Republican primaries in that\r\ncity, would not allow any man to be nominated for either branch of\r\nthe legislature who did not specifically agree to vote for whoever\r\nhe (Cox) should designate as United States Senator.  This I regarded,\r\nif the statement were true, as a corrupt and dangerous power to be\r\nconferred upon any man, which ought not to be submitted to.  I went\r\nto Cincinnati, partly to confer with Foraker, and chiefly in\r\npursuance of a habit of visiting that city at least once a year.\r\nI met Foraker, and he promptly disclaimed any knowledge of such a\r\nrequirement in legislative nominations.  Cox also called upon me,\r\nand said the delegation would probably be divided between Foraker\r\nand myself.  I could say nothing more to him.  Foraker gave a\r\nwritten answer to an inquiry of the \"Commercial Gazette,\" in which\r\nhe said he was a candidate, and no one knew it better than I.  This\r\nwas quite true and proper.  In a published interview I said:\r\n\r\n\"Governor Foraker and I have always been friends, and I am always\r\nglad to see him.  He has a right to the position he has taken in\r\nregard to the senatorship, and it is a proper one.  One man has\r\njust as much right to try it as another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are McKinley and Butterworth candidates for Senator?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, but they have a right to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe only question that remained was whether Cox had a delegation\r\npledged to obey his wish, and this was to be ascertained in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1891 there was an attempt to organize\r\na new party in Ohio, under the name of the Farmers' Alliance, or\r\nPeople's party, based mainly upon what were alleged to be \"seven\r\nfinancial conspiracies.\"  These so-called \"conspiracies\" were the\r\ngreat measures by which the Union cause was maintained during and\r\nsince the war.  The Alliance was greatly encouraged by its success\r\nin defeating Senator Ingalls and replacing him by Senator Peffer,\r\nand proposed that I should follow Ingalls.  Pamphlets were freely\r\ndistributed throughout the state, the chief of which was one written\r\nby a Mrs. Emery, containing ninety-six pages.  I was personally\r\narraigned in this pamphlet as the \"head devil\" of these conspiracies,\r\nand the chief specifications of my crimes were the laws requiring\r\nthe duties on imported goods to be paid in coin, the payment in\r\ncoin of the principal and interest of the public debt, the act to\r\nstrengthen the public credit, the national banking system, and, in\r\nher view, the worst of all, the resumption of specie payments.\r\n\r\nAt first I paid no attention to this pamphlet, but assumed that\r\nintelligent readers could and would answer it.  In October I received\r\na letter calling my attention to it and asking me to answer it.\r\nThis I did by the following letter which I was advised had a\r\nbeneficial effect in the western states, where the pamphlet was\r\nbeing mainly circulated:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, O., October 12, 1891.\r\n\"Mr. Charles F. Stokey, Canton, O.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of the 8th, accompanied by Mrs. S. E. V.\r\nEmery's pamphlet called 'Seven Financial Conspiracies Which Have\r\nEnslaved the American People,' is received.\r\n\r\n\"Some time since, this wild and visionary book was sent to me, and\r\nI read it with amusement and astonishment that anyone could approve\r\nof it or be deceived by its falsehoods.\r\n\r\n\"The 'seven financial conspiracies' are the seven great pillars of\r\nour financial credit, the seven great financial measures by which\r\nthe government was saved from the perils of war and by which the\r\nUnited States has become the most flourishing and prosperous nation\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\"The first chapter attributes the Civil War to an infamous plot of\r\ncapitalists to absorb the wealth of the country at the expense of\r\nthe people, when all the world knows that the Civil War was organized\r\nby slaveholders to destroy the national government and to set up\r\na slaveholding confederacy in the south upon its ruins.  The\r\n'Shylock,' described by Mrs. Emery, is a phantom of her imagination.\r\nThe 'Shylocks of the war' were the men who furnished the means to\r\ncarry on the government, and included in their number the most\r\npatriotic citizens of the northern states, who, uniting their means\r\nwith the services and sacrifices of our soldiers, put down the\r\nrebellion, abolished slavery, and preserved and strengthened our\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\"The first of her 'conspiracies' she calls the exception clause in\r\nthe act of February 25, 1862, by which the duties on imported goods\r\nwere required to be paid in coin in order to provide the means to\r\npay the interest on coin bonds in coin.  This clause had not only\r\nthe cordial support of Secretary Chase, but of President Lincoln,\r\nand proved to be the most important financial aid of the government\r\ndevised during the war.  Goods being imported upon coin values, it\r\nwas but right that the duty to the government should be paid in\r\nthe same coin.  Otherwise the duties would have been constantly\r\ndiminishing with the lessening purchasing power of our greenbacks.\r\nIf the interest of our debt had not been paid in coin, we could\r\nhave borrowed no money abroad, and the rate of interest, instead\r\nof diminishing as it did, would have been largely increased, and\r\nthe volume of our paper money would necessarily have had to be\r\nincreased and its value would have gone down lower and lower, and\r\nprobably ended, as Confederate money did, in being as worthless as\r\nrags.  This exception clause saved our public credit by making a\r\nmarket for our bonds, and the coin was paid by foreigners for the\r\nprivilege of entering our markets.\r\n\r\n\"As for the national banking system--the second of her 'conspiracies'\r\n--it is now conceded to have produced the best form of paper money\r\nissued by banks that has ever been devised.  It was organized to\r\ntake the place of the state banks, which, at the beginning of the\r\nwar, had outstanding over $200,000,000 of notes, of value varying\r\nfrom state to state, and most of them at a discount of from five\r\nto twenty-five per cent.  It was absolutely necessary to get rid\r\nof these state bank notes and to substitute for them bank notes\r\nsecured beyond doubt by the deposit of United States bonds, a system\r\nso perfect that from the beginning until now no one has lost a\r\ndollar on the circulating notes of national banks.  The system may\r\nhave to give way because we are paying off our bonds, but no sensible\r\nman will ever propose in this country to go back to the old system\r\nof state banks, and if some security to take the place of United\r\nStates bonds can be devised for national bank notes, the system\r\nwill be and ought to be perpetuated.\r\n\r\n\"The third 'conspiracy' referred to is contraction of the currency.\r\nIt has been demonstrated by official documents that from the\r\nbeginning of the war to this time the volume of our currency has\r\nbeen increasing, year by year, more rapidly than our population.\r\nIn 1860 the total amount of all the money in circulation was\r\n$435,000,000, when our population was 31,000,000, and half of this\r\nwas money of variable and changing value.  Now we have in circulation\r\n$1,500,000,000, with a population of 64,000,000, and every dollar\r\nof this money is good as gold, all kinds equal to each other,\r\npassing from hand to hand and paid out as good money, not only in\r\nthe United States but among all the commercial countries of the\r\nworld.  Our money has increased nearly fourfold, while our population\r\nhas only doubled.\r\n\r\n\"The statements made by Mrs. Emery about the contraction of our\r\ncurrency are not only misleading but they are absolutely false.\r\nShe states that in 1868 $473,000,000 of our money was destroyed,\r\nand in 1869 $500,000,000 of our money passed into a cremation\r\nfurnace, and in 1870 $67,000,000 was destroyed.  Now these statements\r\nare absolutely false.  What she calls money in these paragraphs\r\nwas the most burdensome form of interest-bearing securities, treasury\r\nnotes bearing seven and three-tenths per cent. interest, and compound\r\ninterest notes.  These were the chief and most burdensome items of\r\nthe public debt.  They were paid off in the years named and were\r\nnever at any time for more than a single day money in circulation.\r\nWhen issued they were received as money, but, as interest accrued\r\nthey became investments and were not at all in circulation.\r\n\r\n\"These statements of Mrs. Emery are palpable falsehoods, which if\r\nstated by a man would justify a stronger word.  It is true that in\r\n1866 Mr. McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury under the administration\r\nof Andrew Johnson, wished to bring about resumption by contraction,\r\nand a bill was passed providing for a gradual reduction of the\r\ngreenbacks to $300,000,000, but this was very soon after repealed\r\nand the greenbacks retained in circulation.  I was not in favor of\r\nthe contraction of the greenbacks, and the very speech that she\r\nquotes, in which I described the effects of contraction and the\r\ndifficulty of resuming, was made against the bill providing for\r\nthe reduction of the greenbacks.\r\n\r\n\"The next 'conspiracy' to which she refers was the first act of\r\nGeneral Grant's administration 'to strengthen the public credit.'\r\nA controversy had existed whether the 5-20 bonds could be paid in\r\ngreenbacks.  I maintained and still believe that by a fair construction\r\nof the loan laws we had a right to pay the principal of the bonds\r\nas they matured in greenbacks of the kind and character in existence\r\nwhen the bonds were issued, but I insisted that it was the duty of\r\nthe government to define a time when the greenbacks should be either\r\nredeemed or maintained at par in coin, that this was a plain\r\nobligation of honor and duty which rested upon the United States,\r\nand that it was not honorable or right to avail ourselves of our\r\nown negligence in restoring these notes to the specie standard in\r\norder to pay the bonds in the depreciated money.  This idea is\r\nembodied in the credit-strengthening act.\r\n\r\n\"The fifth 'conspiracy' of what she calls 'this infernal scheme'\r\nwas the refunding of the national debt.  This operation of refunding\r\nis regarded by all intelligent statesmen as of the highest value,\r\nand was conducted with remarkable success.  At the date of the\r\npassage of the refunding act, July 14, 1870, we had outstanding\r\nbonds bearing five and six per cent. interest for about $1,500,000,000.\r\nBy the wise providence of Congress, we had reserved the right of\r\nredeeming a portion of this debt within five years, and a portion\r\nof it within ten years, so that the debt was, in the main, then\r\nredeemable at our pleasure.  It was not possible to pay it in coin\r\nand it was not honorable to pay it in greenbacks, especially as\r\nthat could only have been done by issuing new greenbacks far beyond\r\nthe volume existing during the war, and which would at once depreciate\r\nin value and destroy the public credit and dishonor the country.\r\nWe, therefore, authorized the exchange, par for par, of bonds\r\nbearing four, four and a half, and five per cent. interest for the\r\nbonds bearing a higher rate of interest.  The only contest in\r\nCongress upon the subject was whether the new bonds should run\r\nfive, ten and fifteen years, or ten, fifteen and thirty years.  I\r\nadvocated the shorter period, but the House of Representatives,\r\nbelieving that the new bonds would not sell at par unless running\r\nfor a longer period, insisted that the four per cent. bonds should\r\nrun for thirty years.  Greenbackers, like Mrs. Emery, who now\r\ncomplain that the bonds run so long and cannot be paid until due,\r\nare the same people who insisted upon making the bonds run thirty\r\nyears.  It required some ten years to complete these refunding\r\noperations--of which the larger part was accomplished when I was\r\nSecretary of the Treasury--and they resulted in a saving of one-\r\nthird of the interest on the debt.  So far from it being in the\r\ninterest of the bondholders, it was to their detriment and only in\r\nthe interest of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The next 'conspiracy' complained of is the alleged demonetization\r\nof silver.  By the act revising the coinage in 1873, the silver\r\ndollar, which had been suspended by Jefferson in 1805 and practically\r\ndemonetized in 1835 and suspended by minor coins in 1853, and which\r\nwas issued only in later years as a convenient form in which to\r\nexport silver bullion, and the whole amount of which, from the\r\nbeginning of the government to the passage of the act referred to,\r\nwas only eight million dollars, was, by the unanimous vote of both\r\nHouses of Congress, without objection from anyone, dropped from\r\nour coinage, and in its place, upon the petition of the legislature\r\nof California, was substituted the trade dollar containing a few\r\nmore grains of silver.  A few years afterwards, silver having fallen\r\nrapidly in market prices, Congress restored the coinage of the\r\nsilver dollar, limiting the amount to not exceeding four million\r\nnor less than two million a month, and under ths law in a period\r\nof twelve years we issued over 400,000,000 silver dollars, fifty\r\ntimes the amount that had been coined prior to 1873.  And now under\r\nexisting law we are purchasing 54,000,000 ounces of silver a year;\r\nso that what she calls the demonetization of silver has resulted\r\nin its use in our country to an extent more than fiftyfold greater\r\nthan before its demonetization.\r\n\r\n\"In spite of this, in consequence of the increased supply of silver\r\nand the cheapening processes of its production, it is going down\r\nin the market and is only maintained at par with gold by the fiat\r\nof the different governments coining it.  Now the deluded people\r\nbelonging to the class of Mrs. Emery are seeking to cheapen the\r\npurchasing power of the dollar, in the hands of the farmer and\r\nlaborer, by the free coinage of silver and the demonetization of\r\ngold.  Silver and gold should be used and maintained as current\r\nmoney, but only on a par with each other, and this can only be done\r\nby treating the cheaper metal as subsidiary and coining it only as\r\ndemanded for the use of the people.\r\n\r\n\"The seventh 'financial conspiracy' is the pride and boast of the\r\ngovernment of the United States, the restoration of our notes, long\r\nafter the war was over, to the standard of coin; in other words,\r\nthe resumption of specie payments.  This measure, which met the\r\nviolent opposition of such wild theorists as Mrs. Emery, has\r\ndemonstrated its success, in the judgment of all intelligent people,\r\nnot only in the United States, but in all the countries of the\r\nworld.  There is no standard for paper money, except coin.  The\r\nUnited States postponed too long the restoration of its notes to\r\ncoin standards.  Since it had the courage to do this under the\r\nresumption act, on the 1st day of January, 1879, we have had in\r\nthe United States a standard of gold with coins of silver, nickel\r\nand copper, maintained at that standard by the fiat of the government,\r\nand paper money in various forms, as United States notes, national\r\nbank notes, gold certificates, silver certificates, and treasury\r\nnotes, all at par with gold.\r\n\r\n\"To call this a 'conspiracy' or an 'infamous plot' is a misnomer\r\nof terms which will not deceive any intelligent man, but it is\r\nrather the glory and pride of the people of the United States that\r\nit not only has been able, in the past thirty years, to put down\r\na great rebellion and to abolish slavery, but to advance the credit\r\nof the United States to the highest rank among nations, to largely\r\nincrease the currency of the country, to add enormously to our\r\nproductive interests, and to develop the resources of the mine,\r\nthe field, and the workshop, to a degree unexampled in the history\r\nof nations.  Intelligent people, who reason and observe, will not\r\nbe deceived or misled by the wild fanaticism and the gloomy prophecies\r\nof Mrs. Emery.  Temporary conditions growing out of the failure of\r\nany portion of our crops will not discourage them; the exaggerations\r\nof the morbid fancy will not mislead them.\r\n\r\n\"A candid examination of the great financial measures of the last\r\nthirty years will lead people to name what Mrs. Emery calls 'the\r\nseven financial conspiracies' as the seven great, wise and\r\nstatesmanlike steps which have led the people of the United States,\r\nthrough perils and dangers rarely encountered by any nation, from\r\na feeble confederacy with four millions of slaves, and discordant\r\ntheories of constitutional power, to a great, free republic, made\r\nstronger by the dangers it has passed, a model and guide for the\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\n\"As for Mrs. Emery's criticisms upon me personally, I do not even\r\ndeem them worthy of answer.  She repeats the old story that I was\r\ninterested in the First National Bank of New York and gave it the\r\nfree use of the people's money.  This is a plain lie, contradicted\r\nand disproved over and over again.  I never had the slightest\r\ninterest in the bank, direct or indirect, and, as the public records\r\nwill show, gave it no favors, but treated it like all other\r\ndepositaries of public money and held it to the most rigid\r\naccountability; nor have I in any case derived the slightest\r\npecuniary benefit from any measure either pending in or before\r\nCongress since I have been in public life.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI had faith in the good sense and conservative tendencies of the\r\npeople, and believed they would not be deluded by such fantasies\r\nand fallacies as were contained in the platform of the People's\r\nparty.  That party made a very active canvass, and expected, as a\r\nprominent member of it said, \"to hold the balance of power in the\r\nlegislature and dictate who the next United States Senator from\r\nOhio shall be, and you may depend upon it that that man will not\r\nbe John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nThis Alliance subsequently changed its ground from irredeemable\r\npaper money to the free coinage of silver.  Professing to care\r\nfor the farmers and laborers it sought in every way to depreciate\r\nthe purchasing power of their money.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\nFREE SILVER AND PROTECTION TO AMERICAN INDUSTRIES.\r\nMy Views in 1891 on the Free Coinage of Silver--Letter to an Ohio\r\nNewspaper on the Subject--A Problem for the Next Congress to Solve\r\n--Views Regarding Protection to American Industries by Tariff Laws\r\n--My Deep Interest in This Campaign--Its Importance to the Country\r\nat Large--Ohio the Battle Ground of These Financial Questions--\r\nOpening the Campaign in Paulding Late in August--Extracts from My\r\nSpeech There--Appeal to the Conservative Men of Ohio of Both Parties\r\n--Address at the State Fair at Columbus--Review of the History of\r\nTariff Legislation in the United States--Five Republican Principles\r\nPertaining to the Reduction of Taxes--Speeches at Cleveland, Toledo,\r\nCincinnati and Elsewhere--McKinley's Election by Over 21,000\r\nPlurality.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the canvass of 1891 it was apparent that the\r\nfarmers of Ohio would not agree to free coinage of silver, and\r\ndivided as usual between the two great parties.  In the heat of\r\nthis contest I wrote to the \"Cyclone\" the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, O., July 7, 1891.\r\n\"Editors 'Cyclone,' Washington C. H.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sirs:--In answer to your letter of the 6th, I can only\r\nsay that my views on the question of the free coinage of silver\r\nare fully stated in the speech I made at the last session of the\r\nSenate, a copy of which I send you, and I can add nothing new to it.\r\n\r\n\"I can appreciate the earnest demand of the producers of silver\r\nbullion, that the United States should pay $1.29 an ounce for silver\r\nbullion which in the markets of the world has been for a series of\r\nyears worth only about one dollar an ounce--sometimes a little\r\nmore, sometimes a little less, but I cannot appreciate why any\r\nfarmer or other producer should desire that the government should\r\npay for any article more than its market value.  The government\r\nshould purchase the articles it needs, like all other purchasers,\r\nat the market price.  The distinction sought to be made in favor\r\nof silver is without just foundation.  The government now buys in\r\nthe open market more than the entire domestic production of silver\r\nbullion, because it needs it for coinage and as the basis of treasury\r\nnotes.  I gladly contributed my full share to this measure, and\r\nwould do anything in my power to advance the market value of silver\r\nto its legal ratio to gold, but this can only be done in concert\r\nwith other commercial nations.  The attempt to do it by the United\r\nStates alone would only demonstrate our weakness.\r\n\r\n\"To the extent that the enormous demand made by the existing law\r\nadvances the price of silver, the producer receives the benefit,\r\nand to-day the production of silver is probably the most profitable\r\nindustry in the United States.  To ask more seems to me unreasonable,\r\nand, if yielded to, will bring all our money to the single silver\r\nstandard alone, demonetize gold and detach the United States from\r\nthe standards of the great commercial nations of the world.  The\r\nunreasonable demand for the free coinage of silver has nothing to\r\ndo with the reasonable demand for the increase of the volume of\r\nmoney required by the increase of business and population of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"We have provided by existing laws for the increase of money to an\r\namount greater than the increase of business and population; but,\r\neven if more money is required, there are many ways of providing\r\nit without cheapening its purchasing power, or making a wide\r\ndifference between the kinds of money in circulation based on silver\r\nand gold.  More than ninety-two per cent. of all payments is now\r\nmade in checks, drafts and other commercial devices.  All kinds of\r\ncirculating notes are now equal to each other and are kept at the\r\ngold standard by redemption and exchange.  Our money and our credit\r\nare now equal to or better than those of the most civilized nations\r\nof the world, our productions of every kind are increasing, and it\r\nseems to me almost a wild lunacy for us to disturb this happy\r\ncondition by changing the standard of all contracts, including\r\nspecial contracts payable in gold, and again paying gold to the\r\ncapitalists, and silver (at an exaggerated price) to the farmer,\r\nlaborer and pensioner.\r\n\r\n\"I would not be true to my conviction of what is best for the good\r\nof my constituents if I did not frankly and firmly stand by my\r\nopinions, whatever may be the effect upon me personally.  My greatest\r\nobligations have been to the farmers of Ohio, and I would be unworthy\r\nof their trust and confidence if I did not beseech them to stand\r\nby the financial policy which will secure them the best results\r\nfor their labor and productions, and the comfort and prosperity of\r\nall classes alike.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this letter was written the demand for the free coinage of\r\nsilver was at its height.  I knew that my position was not a popular\r\none, yet felt confident that in the end the people would become\r\nconvinced that no change should be made in the standard of value\r\nthen existing, and that the use of silver as money should be\r\ncontinued and it should be maintained at par with gold, but that\r\nwhen the volume of it became so great as to threaten the demonetization\r\nof gold, its coinage should be discontinued and silver bullion in\r\nthe treasury should be represented by treasury notes in circulation\r\nequal in amount to the cost of the silver bullion.  This was the\r\nbasis of the act of 1890, but, unfortunately, the amount of silver\r\nbullion produced in the United States and in the world at large so\r\nrapidly increased that it continually declined in market value.\r\nEvery purchase of it entailed great loss to the United States.\r\nHow to deal with this condition was the problem for the next Congress\r\nto solve.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August, in response to an inquiry from the editor\r\nof the \"Citizen,\" a newspaper published in Urbana, Ohio, I wrote\r\nthe following letter in regard to the policy of protection to\r\nAmerican industries by tariff laws:\r\n\r\n\"A protective tariff was the first measure provided by the first\r\nCongress of the United States.  No nation can be independent without\r\na diversity of industries.  A single occupation may answer for an\r\nindividual, but a nation must be composed of many men of many\r\nemployments.  Every nation ought to be independent of other nations\r\nin respect to all productions necessary for life and comfort that\r\ncan be made at home.  These are axioms of political economy so\r\nmanifestly true that they need no demonstration.  The measure of\r\nprotection is a proper subject of dispute, but there should be no\r\ndispute as to the principle of protection in a country like ours,\r\npossessing almost every raw material of nature and almost every\r\nvariety of productions.  We have prospered most when our industries\r\nhave been best protected.  The vast variety of our manufactures,\r\nnow rivaling in quantity those of countries much older than ours,\r\nis the result of protection.\r\n\r\n\"Every President, from Washington down to Jackson, inclusive,\r\ndeclared in favor of the principle of protection.  Every eminent\r\nstatesman of the early period, including Calhoun, favored this\r\npolicy.  The owners of slaves, engaged chiefly in the production\r\nof cotton, became hostile to protection, and, with those engaged\r\nin foreign commerce, were the representative free traders of the\r\nUnited States.  Now that slavery is abolished and the south has\r\nentered upon the development of her vast natural resources, and it\r\nhas been proven that our foreign commerce is greater under protective\r\nlaws, there should be no opposition in any portion of our country\r\nto the protection of American industry by wise discriminating\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\"The principle of protection should be applied impartially and\r\nfairly to all productions, whether of the workshop or the farm.\r\nThe object is to diversify employment and to protect labor, and\r\nthis protection should be impartially applied without respect to\r\nthe nature of the production.  All experience has established the\r\ninvariable fact that domestic production, by inducing competition,\r\nin a brief period, lowers the price of all protected articles.  In\r\nthe whole range of productions this result has been universal.\r\nWhenever it is apparent that a new industry can be established, as\r\nis the case now with the manufacture of tin plate, it is good policy\r\nto give to the industry a liberal degree of protection, with the\r\nassurance that if we have the raw material on equal conditions we\r\ncan after a time compete with the imported article.\r\n\r\n\"The policy of a nation upon economic questions should be fixed\r\nand stable.  The McKinley law, as now framed, though it may be open\r\nto criticism as to details, is a strictly protective measure, fair\r\nand just as applied to all industries, with ample provisions to\r\nsecure reciprocity in the exchange of domestic productions for\r\narticles we cannot produce.  It ought to be thoroughly tested by\r\nthe experience of several years.  It is not good policy to disturb\r\nit or keep the public mind in suspense about it.  It will, as I\r\nthink, demonstrate its wisdom, but if not, with the light of\r\nexperience, it can be modified.  The highest policy and the greatest\r\ngood to our people lie in the full trial of this effort, to establish,\r\nupon a firm foundation, the domestic production of every article\r\nessential to American life and independence.\"\r\n\r\nThese two letters, on the \"free coinage of silver\" and the \"McKinley\r\ntariff law,\" frankly expressed my opinions on the salient questions\r\nof the day.  With respect to the principles that underlie the policy\r\nof protection, I have already stated my opinions in commenting upon\r\nthe Morrill tariff law.  No general tariff bill has passed during\r\nmy service in Congress that met my entire approval.  It is easy to\r\nformulate general principles, but when we come to apply them to\r\nthe great number of articles named on the tariff list, we find that\r\nthe interests of their constituents control the action of Senator\r\nand Members.  The McKinley tariff bill was not improved in the\r\nSenate.  The compact and influential delegation from New England\r\nmade its influence felt in support of industries pursued in that\r\nsection, while the delegations from other sections were divided on\r\nparty lines.  The tariff law was not, therefore, consistent with\r\nany general principle, but it was nearer so than the one in force\r\nbefore its passage, and the necessity of passing some law that\r\nwould reduce taxation was so imperative that the differences between\r\nthe two Houses were readily compromised.  The execution of the\r\nMcKinley law under President Harrison demonstrated that it would\r\nfurnish ample revenue to support the government, and it should have\r\nremained on the statute book with such slight changes as experience\r\nmight have shown to be necessary.  The Democratic party, however,\r\nwas opposed to the protective features of this law, took advantage\r\nof its defects, and, subsequently, when that party came into power,\r\nit unwisely undertook to make a new tariff which has proven to be\r\ninsufficient to yield the needed revenue, and thus created the\r\nnecessity of using, for current expenses, the reserve of gold\r\nspecially accumulated in the treasury for the redemption of United\r\nStates notes.\r\n\r\nI felt the deepest interest in this campaign, not from the selfish\r\ndesire to hold longer an office I had held for nearly thirty years,\r\nbut I thought that in Ohio we were to have a great financial battle,\r\nupon the result of which might depend the monetary system of the\r\nUnited States.  On the 17th of August I said to a reporter:\r\n\r\n\"The people of the east do not seem to understand this campaign.\r\nThey do not appear to have any comprehension of what it means to\r\nthem as well as the country.  No matter what their differences upon\r\nthe tariff question may be, every Republican who wishes the success\r\nof his party should be made to understand that there is another\r\nand perhaps a graver question to be settled in Ohio this year.\r\nWhile our politics for the past few campaigns have hinged upon\r\nminor questions, we are to-day brought back to the financial problem\r\nwhich we all thought had been settled, in 1875, when Mr. Hayes won\r\nthe fight for an honest dollar against Governor Allen, who represented\r\nthe liberal currency idea.  Then it came in the guise of greenbacks,\r\nand now it comes in the garb of free silver.  That conflict made\r\nMr. Hayes President of the United States.  What the decision may\r\nbe this year no man can tell.\"\r\n\r\nI further said the arguments that year were identically the same\r\nas in the Hayes and Allen contest if the word \"silver\" were\r\nsubstituted for \"greenbacks.\"  The Democrats had declared for\r\nunlimited coinage, and we had declared against it.  The Farmers'\r\nAlliance came in as allies of the Democracy, but, while they were\r\nan unknown quantity, they did not appear to be very dangerous.  I\r\ncould not find that they made much impression on Republican farmers.\r\nIt had fallen to the lot of Ohio to be the battle ground on which\r\nthese financial question were fought, but we had never been saddled\r\nwith so grave a conflict as that year, not merely for the reason\r\nthat we had both the financial and economic questions depending\r\nupon the result, but because of the lack of action and moral force\r\nwhich did not seem to come to us from outside the state, as it\r\nshould and had years before.  I had too much faith in the Republicans\r\nof the country to believe that when they understood the situation\r\nthey would fail to arouse themselves to the necessities of the hour.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question as to how the canvass would be conducted,\r\nI said that Major McKinley and those close to him were perfectly\r\ncompetent to deal with the management of the campaign and would do\r\nso.  I should in my opening speech devote myself entirely to a\r\npresentation of the financial part of the contest, which was equal\r\nin importance with the tariff.  It was perhaps unfortunate for both\r\nthat two such questions should come up for discussion at the same\r\ntime, but they did and the issue had to be met.  The only thing\r\nthat was necessary to insure a crowning success was that the\r\nRepublicans of the country should understand that, no matter what\r\ntheir differences upon the tariff were, they had a vital interest\r\nin settling the financial question for all time at the next election\r\nin the State of Ohio.  The prosperity in Ohio was a great aid to\r\nthe Republicans.  The crops in that state and the west were larger\r\nthan for many years.  Prices were good and the farmers as a rule\r\nprosperous.  This naturally made them regard with grim humor the\r\ntalk of the Alliance lecturers about poverty and distress.  Another\r\nthing which helped us was the fact that short crops were the rule\r\nin Europe.  In reply to a question as to the senatorial issue, I\r\nsaid in one of my speeches:\r\n\r\n\"I have no regret that this character of battle is prominent.  I\r\nam rather complimented than otherwise to be again selected as the\r\ntarget of this crusade against a sound currency.  It is a question\r\nthat has been nearest my heart for a good many years, and I am\r\nperfectly willing to abide the result upon my position thereon.\r\nAs I said before, I have no fears as to the decision for the right.\r\nI have less opposition to encounter than I have ever had before,\r\nand should we carry the legislature, which I believe we will, I am\r\ncontent to stand by the judgment of the Republicans of that body,\r\nno matter what it may be.\"\r\n\r\nI made my opening speech in this campaign at Paulding, on the 27th\r\nof August.  It was mainly confined to the silver question.  I quote\r\na few extracts from it:\r\n\r\n\"It has been said by many persons of both political parties that\r\nthis is to be a campaign of education.  I believe it ought to be\r\nso, for the leading questions involved are purely business questions,\r\naffecting material interests common alike to men of all parties.\r\n\r\n\"Upon two great measures of public policy the Republican and\r\nDemocratic parties have made a formal and distinct issue, and these\r\nare to be submitted to the people of Ohio in November, and your\r\ndecision will have a marked effect upon public opinion throughout\r\nthe United States.  One is whether the holder of silver bullion\r\nmay deposit it in the treasury of the United States, and demand\r\nand receive for it one dollar of coined money for every 371 grains\r\nof fine silver deposited.  The market value of so much silver\r\nbullion is now about 77 cents, varying, however, from day to day,\r\nlike other commodities, sometimes more and sometimes less.  The\r\nother question is whether the policy of taxing imported goods by\r\nthe government of the United States, embodied in our existing tariff\r\nlaw, known as the McKinley tariff, is a wise public policy, or\r\nwhether it should be superseded by what is called a tariff for\r\nrevenue only, as embodied in what is known as the Mills bill, which\r\npassed the House of Representatives in 1888, and was rejected by\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"I propose upon this occasion to confine myself mainly to a frank\r\nand homely discussion of the money question, as the most pressing,\r\nnot that the tariff question is not equally important, but for the\r\nreason that I can only do one thing at a time, and the money question\r\nis a newer one, is now before us, upon which Republicans and\r\nDemocrats alike are somewhat divided.  I wish to appeal to the\r\nreason and common sense of the people who hear me, for that is said\r\nto be the highest wisdom.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Now, you all know that the money in circulation in the United\r\nStates--all of it--is good, good as gold.  It will pass everywhere\r\nand buy as much as the same amount of any other money in the world.\r\nOur money is of many kinds--gold, silver, nickel and copper are\r\nall coined into money.  Then we have United States notes, or\r\ngreenbacks, gold certificates, silver certificates, treasury notes\r\nand national bank notes.  But the virtue of all these many kinds\r\nof money is that they are all good.  A dollar of each is as good\r\nas a dollar of any other kind.  All are as good as gold.  But, and\r\nhere comes the first difficulty, the silver in the silver dollar\r\nis not worth as much as the gold in the gold dollar.  The nickel\r\nin that coin is worth but a small part of five cents' worth of\r\nsilver.  And the copper in the cent is not worth one-fifth of the\r\nnickel in a five cent piece.  How then, you may ask me, can these\r\ncoins be made equal to each other?  The answer is that coinage is\r\na government monopoly, and though the copper in five cents is not\r\nworth a nickel, and the nickel in twenty pieces is not worth a\r\nsilver dollar, and the silver in sixteen dollars is not worth\r\nsixteen dollars in gold, yet, as the government coins them, and\r\nreceives them, and maintains them at par with gold coin, they are,\r\nfor all purposes, money equal to each other, and wherever they go,\r\neven into foreign countries, they are received and paid out as\r\nequivalents.\r\n\r\n\"The reason of all this is that the United States limits the amount\r\nof all the coins to be issued except gold, which, being the most\r\nvaluable, is coined without limit.  If coinage of all these metals\r\nwas free, and any holder of copper, nickel, silver or gold could\r\ncarry it to the mint to be coined, we would have no money but copper\r\nand nickel, because they are the cheaper metals, worth less than\r\none-fourth of what, as coin, they purport to be.  For the same\r\nreason, if the coinage of silver was free at the ratio of sixteen\r\nof silver to one of gold, no gold would be coined, because sixteen\r\nounces of silver are not worth one ounce of gold.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The one distinctive, striking feature of the law of 1890 is, that\r\nthe United States will not pay for silver bullion more than its\r\nmarket value.  And why should we?  What is there about silver\r\nbullion that distinguishes it from any other product of industry\r\nthat the government needs?  When the government needs food and\r\nclothing for the army and navy it pays only the market price to\r\nthe farmer and manufacturer.  The value of silver produced is\r\ninsignificant compared with the value of any of the articles produced\r\nby the farmer, the miner and manufacturer.  Nearly all the silver\r\nproduced in the United States is by rich corporations in a few new\r\nstates, and its production at market price is far more profitable\r\nthan any crop of the farmer, and yet it is the demand of the producer\r\nof silver bullion that the United States should pay him twenty-five\r\nper cent. more than its market value that lies at the foundation\r\nof the difference between the Republican and Democratic parties.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Our Democratic friends differ from us in this particular.  They\r\nare in favor of allowing any holder of silver bullion, foreign or\r\ndomestic, any old silverware or melted teapot, any part of the vast\r\naccumulated hoard of silver in India, China, South America and\r\nother countries of the world, estimated by statisticians to be\r\n$3,810,571,346, to present it to the treasury of the United States\r\nand demand one dollar of our money, or our promises to pay money,\r\nfor 371 grains of silver, or any multiple of that sum, though this\r\namount of silver is now worth only 77 cents, and has for a period\r\nof years been as low as 70 cents.  If with free silver we receive\r\nonly the quantity of silver we are required to purchase by existing\r\nlaw, the United States would pay over $13,000,000 a year more than\r\nif purchased at the market value, and this vast sum would be paid\r\nannually as a bounty to the producers of silver bullion.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not the worst of it.  Free coinage means that we shall\r\npurchase not merely four and a half million ounces a month, but\r\nall the silver that is offered, come from where it may, if presented\r\nin quantities of one hundred ounces at a time.  We are to give the\r\nholder either coin or treasury notes, at his option, at the rate\r\nof one dollar for every 371 grains, now worth in the market 77\r\ncents.  Who can estimate the untold hoards of silver that will come\r\ninto the treasury if this policy is adopted?\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"But it is said that free coinage will not have the effect I have\r\nstated; that the silver in sight is so occupied where it is that\r\nit will not come to us.  They said the same when the present law\r\nwas passed, that foreign silver would not come to us.  Yet our\r\npurchase of 4,500,000 ounces, troy weight, or 187 tons, of silver\r\na month, at market price, brought into the United States large\r\namounts of silver from all parts of the world.  If that is the\r\neffect of limited purchases at one dollar an ounce, the market\r\nprice, what will be the effect of unlimited purchases at 29 cents\r\nan ounce more than market price?  It would inundate us with the\r\nvast hoards of silver in countries where silver alone is the current\r\nmoney, and draw to us all the rapidly-increasing production of\r\nsilver mines in the world.\r\n\r\n\"But they say with free coinage the price of silver will rise to\r\nthe old ratio with gold.  The experience of all the world belies\r\nthis statement.  In no country in the world where free coinage\r\nexists is sixteen ounces of silver equal to one ounce of gold.\r\nFrance and the United States maintain the parity between the two\r\nby carefully limiting the coinage and receiving and redeeming silver\r\ncoins as the equivalent of gold.  But wherever free coinage exists\r\nthat is impossible.  With free coinage the market value of the\r\nbullion fixes the value of the dollar.  The Mexican dollar contains\r\nmore silver than the American dollar, and yet the Mexican dollar\r\nis worth about 78 cents, because in Mexico coinage is free.  And\r\nthe American dollar is worth 100 cents because in the United States\r\ncoinage is limited.  So in all free coinage countries where silver\r\nalone is coined it is worth its market value as bullion.  In all\r\ncountries where gold circulates the coinage of silver is limited,\r\nbut is used as money in even greater amounts than in countries\r\nwhere coinage is free.  This is the case in France and the United\r\nStates.  The free coinage of silver in either would stop the coinage\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"It is claimed that if we adopt the silver standard we will get\r\nmore money for our labor and productions.  This does not follow,\r\nbut, even if it be true, the purchasing power of our money will be\r\ndiminished.  All experience proves that labor and the productions\r\nof the farm are the last to advance in price.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Some say that we want more money to transact the business of the\r\ncountry.  Do we get more money be demonetizing one-half of all we\r\nhave?--for the gold now in circulation is more than one-half of\r\nthe coin in circulation.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing this speech I said:\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the conservative men of Ohio of both parties to repeat\r\nnow the service they rendered the people of the United States in\r\n1875, by the election of Governor Hayes, in checking the wave of\r\ninflation that then threatened the country.  You can render even\r\na greater service now in the election of Governor McKinley, in\r\ndefeating the free coinage of silver, and strengthening the hands\r\nof President Harrison and the Republican Senate in maintaining\r\nAmerican industries, a full dollar for all labor and productions,\r\nthe untarnished credit of the American people, and the advancing\r\ngrowth and prosperity of our great republic.  I have endeavored in\r\na feeble way to promote these objects of national policy, and now\r\nthat I am growing old, I have no other wish or ambition than to\r\ninspire the young men of Ohio to take up the great work of the\r\ngeneration that is passing away, and to do in their time as much\r\nas, or more than, the soldiers and citizens of the last forty years\r\nhave been able to do to advance and elevate our government to the\r\nhighest standard and example of honor, courage and industry known\r\namong men.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts give an imperfect idea of the speech, which entered\r\ninto many details, and stated the effect of the cheapening of the\r\ndollar on the wages of men employed as laborers, and on farmers\r\nwho would be cheated by the diminished power of money.\r\n\r\nBeing confined to one subject, and that one which at the time\r\nexcited the attention of the people, this speech was widely copied,\r\nand received general approbation from the press of the north and\r\neast, and was commented upon favorably in countries in Europe,\r\nwhere the fall in the price of silver was the subject of anxious\r\ninterest.  It also excited the denunciation of the free silver states\r\nin the west.  The Democratic platform of Ohio had unfortunately\r\ncommitted that great party to the ideas of the new party calling\r\nitself the People's party, represented mainly by the disciples of\r\nthe old greenback fiat money craze, some of whom, while claiming\r\nto be farmers, do their planting in law offices, and whose crops,\r\nif they have any, are thistles and ragweeds.  That part of the\r\nplatform had been adopted by but a bare majority of the Democratic\r\nconvention, and Campbell, their candidate, tried to evade it.\r\n\r\nMcKinley promptly recognized the importance of the money question\r\nin the pending canvass, and at once presented in all his speeches\r\nthe two vital measures of his party--good money and a protective\r\ntariff.  On these two issues the Republican party was united and\r\nthe Democratic party divided.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, I was invited by the managers of the state fair\r\nto make a speech on the 17th of that month at their grounds in\r\nColumbus, on the political issues of the day, and accepted the\r\ninvitation.  As usual during the fair great crowds assembled, most\r\nof whom no doubt felt more interested in the horse races and sight-\r\nseeing than in coinage or tariff, but many thousands, mostly farmers\r\nfrom all parts of the state, were gathered around the east front\r\nof the main building.  At the time appointed I was introduced by\r\nE. W. Poe, the state auditor, with the usual flattering remarks,\r\nand commenced my speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When I was invited to speak to you here I was informed that I was\r\nexpected to present my views on the leading issues of the day, and\r\nthat a like invitation had been given to Governor Campbell and\r\nother gentlemen holding public trusts from the people of Ohio.\r\nWhile this invitation relieves me from the charge of impropriety\r\nin introducing a political question on the fair grounds, yet I am\r\nadmonished by the presence of gentlemen of all parties and all\r\nshades of opinion that common courtesy demands that, while frankly\r\nstating my convictions, I will respect the opinions of others who\r\ndiffer from me.  I propose, therefore, in a plain way to give you\r\nmy views on the tariff question, now on trial between the two great\r\npolitical parties of the United States.  It is somewhat unfortunate\r\nthat this purely business question of public policy is being\r\ndiscussed on party lines, but it is made a party question by the\r\nState conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties of Ohio,\r\nand we must accept it as such, though I would greatly prefer, and\r\nI intend to treat it here, as far as I can, as a purely economic\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nI briefly stated the history of tariff legislation in the United\r\nStates, what was meant by a tariff and the objects sought by it,\r\nand that for the first fifty years of our history the lines were\r\nnot drawn between a revenue tariff and a protective tariff.  It\r\nwas in those days the common desire of all sections to obtain\r\nrevenue and to encourage domestic industries.  This unity of purpose\r\nexisted until 1831, when the south had become almost exclusively\r\nan agricultural region, in which cotton was the chief product of\r\nthe plantation with negro slaves as the laborers, and when the\r\nnorth, under the protective policy, had largely introduced\r\nmanufactures, and naturally wished to protect and enlarge their\r\nindustries.  The tariff question grew out of a contest between free\r\nand slave labor.  I referred to the various measures adopted, the\r\ncompromise measure of 1833, the Whig tariff of 1842, the Walker\r\ntariff of 1846, and the Morrill tariff of 1861.  During and after\r\nthe war, for many years, any tariff that would produce enough\r\nrevenue to meet current expenditures and pay the interest of the\r\npublic debt, would necessarily give ample protection to domestic\r\nindustries.  To meet these demands we had to levy not only high\r\nduties on nearly all imported goods, but to add internal taxes,\r\nyielding $300,000,000 annually, on articles produced in this country.\r\nWhen this large revenue was no longer necessary, many of these\r\ntaxes were repealed, and then the tariff again became a political\r\nquestion between the Republican and Democratic parties.  I then\r\nstated the five principles or rules of action adopted by the\r\nRepublican party in the reduction of taxes, all of which were\r\napplied in the framing of the McKinley tariff law, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"First.  To repeal all taxes on home production, except on spirits,\r\ntobacco, and beer.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  To levy the highest rates of duties that will not encourage\r\nsmuggling, on articles of luxury which enter into the consumption\r\nof the rich.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  To place on imported articles which compete with articles\r\nthat can be manufactured or produced in the United States, such a\r\nrate of duty as will secure to our farmers and laborers fair prices,\r\nfair wages, and will induce our people to engage in such manufacture\r\nand production.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  To repeal all duties on articles of prime necessity which\r\nenter into the consumption of the American people and which cannot\r\nbe produced in sufficient quantity in this country.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  To grant to foreign nations the reciprocal right of free\r\nimportation into our ports of articles we cannot produce, in return\r\nfor the free introduction into their ports of articles of American\r\nproduction.\"\r\n\r\nI entered into full details of the tariff and contrasted the McKinley\r\nact with the Mills bill proposed by the Democratic party, but which\r\nnever became a law, and in conclusion said:\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen, it is for you to say whether it is better for\r\nyou, as farmers, or producers, or consumers, to give this law a\r\nfair trial, with the right at all times to make amendments, or to\r\nopen it up and keep it in a contest between two political parties.\r\nIf we could all divest ourselves of the influence of party feeling\r\nwe would have no difficulty in agreeing that either bill is better\r\nthan a constant agitation and change of our tariff system.  I say\r\nto you that if the Mills bill had become a law in 1888, I should\r\nhave been disinclined to agitate its repeal until it had a fair\r\ntrial, though my study, both in the Senate and committee on finance,\r\nled me to oppose it.  It seemed to me a retrograde measure, born\r\nof the ideas of the south, narrow in its scope, and not suited to\r\na great country of unbounded but undeveloped resources.  Still, as\r\nI say, if it was the law, I would not repeal it without trial.\r\nNow, this McKinley bill does meet, substantially, my views of public\r\npolicy.  Some items I would like to change, but, on the whole, it\r\nis a wise measure of finance.  It will give enough revenue to\r\nsupport the government.  It is an American law, looking only to\r\nAmerican interests.  It is a fair law, dealing justly by all\r\nindustries.  It is an honest law, preventing, as far as law can,\r\nfraud and evasion.  It is a comprehensive law covering the whole\r\nground.  It will undoubtedly establish new branches of industry in\r\nour country not now pursued.  It will strengthen others now in\r\noperation.  It will give to thousands of our people now idle,\r\nemployment at fair wages.  It will give to our farmers a greatly\r\nenlarged market for their productions, and encourage them in\r\nproducing articles not now produced, and to increase their flocks,\r\nherds and horses to meet the new demands.\"\r\n\r\nMy speech was as free from partisanship as I could make it, and I\r\nam quite willing to stand upon the policy I defined.\r\n\r\nI visited Cleveland a few days later and met many of the active\r\nRepublicans of that city, and was glad to learn that they were\r\npractically unanimous for my re-election.  Among other callers was\r\na correspondent of the \"Plain Dealer\" of that city, who treated me\r\nfairly in stating correctly what I said in answer to his questions.\r\nThe \"Commercial Gazette\" and the \"Enquirer,\" of Cincinnati, also\r\npublished long interviews with me, and incidents of my life given\r\nby my neighbors.  I began to believe that these interviews, fairly\r\nreported, were better modes of expressing my opinions than formal\r\nspeeches, and were more generally read.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October I made many speeches in different parts\r\nof the state, several of which were reported in full, but the\r\ngeneral tenor of all may be gathered from those already referred to.\r\n\r\nAmong the largest meetings I attended in this canvass was one at\r\nToledo, on the evening of the 14th of October.  Here again I\r\ndiscoursed about currency and the tariff, but the salient points\r\nhad become so familiar to me that I could speak with ease to my\r\naudience and to myself.  As soon as this meeting was over, I took\r\nthe midnight train for Dayton, where a \"burgoo\" feast was to be\r\nheld the next day on the fair grounds.  This was by far the largest\r\nmeeting of the campaign.  There was an immense crowd on the grounds,\r\nbut it was a disagreeable day, with a cloudy sky, a chilly atmosphere\r\nand a cold raw wind.  McKinley, Foraker and I spoke from the same\r\nstand, following each other.  As I was the first to speak I had\r\nthe best of it, and as soon as I finished left the grounds, but\r\nthey held the great audience for several hours.  I insert what the\r\nDayton \"Journal\" reported of the speakers as a specimen of friendly\r\njournalism:\r\n\r\n\"Sherman renewed his youth and even exceeded the best efforts of\r\nhis earlier days.  Neither man nor woman left their place while\r\nSherman was speaking.  At 2 o'clock, when McKinley, our gallant\r\nleader, took the platform, the crowd seemed so great that no man's\r\nvoice could reach them, but they listened for every syllable and\r\nmade the hills echo with their appreciative applause.  Then came\r\nForaker.  It seemed as if the great meeting had been magnetized\r\nwith an electric power of ten thousand volts.  There were continuous\r\nshouts of approbation and applause from his beginning to the close.\r\nHis mingling of wit and wisdom, a burgoo combination of powerful\r\nand telling arguments, with sandwiches of solid facts, completed\r\na political barbecue which will be a historical memory that will\r\nbe almost as famous as the gathering of the people of this splendid\r\nvalley in 1842, when Henry Clay spoke to our fathers on the same\r\nsod and under the shade of the same trees on the same subjects.\r\nThe memory of the magnificent Republican demonstration at the\r\nMontgomery fair grounds on the 15th day of October, 1891, will\r\nremain with all who participated in it as long as they shall live.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of October 17, Foraker and I appeared together before\r\na great audience in Music Hall, Cincinnati.  I insert a few sentences\r\nof a long description in the \"Commercial Gazette\" of the next day:\r\n\r\n\"Music Hall was the scene last night of the greatest Republican\r\ngathering of the campaign.  Senator Sherman and Governor Foraker\r\nwere the speakers.\r\n\r\n\"The meeting was an immense one.  That was a magnificent assemblage.\r\nIt was an ovation.  It was a recognition of brains and integrity.\r\nIt was an evidence that honesty and justice prevail.  It showed\r\nthat the people believe in the Republican party.  It proved that\r\nthey appreciate that the party still has a mission.  It evinced an\r\nappreciation of the past and a hope for, and a belief in, the\r\nfuture.  It was a great outpouring of Republicans.  It was a\r\ngathering of the supporters of right as against wrong.  It was a\r\nregular Republican crowd.  Personal feeling and personal ambition\r\nwere laid aside.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Sherman and Foraker were on the stage together.  Their presence\r\non the same stage was a noteworthy fact.  It was an evidence of\r\nharmony and of strength.  Then, again, the united marching of the\r\nLincoln and Blaine clubs was a further proof of harmony.  In fact,\r\nthe entire meeting, and the pleasant feeling manifest, proved that\r\nthe party is united as one man against its old foe, the Democracy;\r\nthat, as many a time before, it is ready and anxious to do battle\r\nwith the ancient enemy.  No deceits, no frauds, can defeat it--the\r\nRepublican party.  This the meeting proved conclusively.\"\r\n\r\nI closed my part in this canvass at Toledo and Cleveland in the\r\nweek before the election, and these speeches were fairly and fully\r\nreported.  During the whole contest between Foraker and myself\r\nthere was nothing said to disturb our friendly relations.  The\r\nelection resulted in the success of the Republican ticket and a\r\nRepublican legislature, McKinley receiving over 21,000 plurality.\r\nImmediately after the election it was announced that the members\r\nof the legislature from Hamilton county were unanimously in favor\r\nof Foraker for Senator.  This announcement, and especially the\r\nmanner of it, created a good deal of bad feeling in the state,\r\nespecially as it was alleged and believed that George Cox had full\r\ncontrol of the delegation and had required the pledges of each\r\nsenator and member to vote for United States Senator as he dictated.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire canvass there was a full and free discussion,\r\nnot only in Ohio but throughout the United States, as to the choice\r\nbetween Foraker and myself.  It was known that the vote in the\r\nlegislature would be close and the friends of each were claiming\r\na majority for their favorite.  It is not necessary to follow the\r\nprogress of the contest, but I became satisfied that I would be re-\r\nelected, although the most positive assurances were published that\r\nForaker, with the aid of his solid delegation from Hamilton county,\r\nwould be successful.  Many things were said during the brief period\r\nbefore the election that ought not to have been said, but this is\r\nunavoidable in choosing between political friends as well as between\r\nopposing parties.  Every Republican paper in Ohio took sides in\r\nthe contest.  Meetings were held in many of the counties and cities\r\nof the state, and resolutions adopted expressing their preference.\r\n\r\nI was urged by some friends to go to Columbus some time before the\r\nmeeting of the legislature on the first Monday in January, but\r\ndelayed my departure from Washington until after the wedding of my\r\nniece, on the 30th of December, a narrative of which was given by\r\nthe \"Ohio State Journal\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The marriage of Miss Rachel Sherman, daughter of the late General\r\nWilliam T. Sherman, and Dr. Paul Thorndike, of Boston, was solemnized\r\nat high noon to-day at the residence of Senator Sherman, in the\r\npresence of a distinguished audience of relatives and officials.\r\nIt was a gathering composed chiefly of intimate friends of the late\r\nGeneral Sherman, many of whom came from afar to witness the nuptials\r\nof the favorite daughter of the deceased chieftain.\r\n\r\n\"The house was gay with music and fragrant with flowers.  The\r\nceremony took place in the front parlor of the residence.  A canopy\r\nof asparagus and smilax was twined over the recess where the ceremony\r\nwas performed.  A background of foliage and palms massed together\r\nmade the couple standing in front all the more effective and\r\nattractive.  On the mantel were banked white blossoms in profusion,\r\nand hanging from the chandeliers wreaths of smilax intertwined with\r\nwhite chrysanthemums and carnations.  The ushers were Mr. Allen\r\nJohnston, of the British legation, Mr. Ward Thorou, Mr. William\r\nThorndike, Dr. Augustine Thorndike and Mr. Tecumseh Sherman, the\r\nbride's brother.  Preceding the bride came her little niece, Miss\r\nElizabeth Thackara, in a gown of white muslin, carrying a basket\r\nof white lilies.  Senator Sherman escorted the bride, who was met\r\nby the groom and his best man, Mr. Albert Thorndike.  The party\r\ngrouped about Father Sherman, brother of the bride, who, with much\r\nimpressiveness, performed the marriage rites of the Catholic church.\r\n\r\n\"After the ceremony the bride and groom held a reception.  A wedding\r\nbreakfast was next served to the invited guests.  Among those\r\npresent were the President and Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. McKee, the Vice\r\nPresident and Mrs. Morton, Secretary Blaine, Mr. and Mrs. Damrosch,\r\nSecretaries Rusk and Tracy, Senator and Mrs. Stanford, Sir Julian\r\nPauncefote and others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\nELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOR THE SIXTH TIME.\r\nI Secure the Caucus Nomination for Senator on the First Ballot--\r\nForaker and Myself Introduced to the Legislature--My Address of\r\nThanks to the Members--Speech of Governor Foraker--My Colleague\r\nGiven His Seat in the Senate Without Opposition--Message of President\r\nHarrison to the 52nd Congress--Morgan's Resolutions and Speech for\r\nthe Free Coinage of Silver--Opening of the Silver Debate by Mr.\r\nTeller--My Speech on the Question--Defeat of the Bill in the House\r\n--Discussion of the Chinese Question--My Opposition to the Conference\r\nReport on Mr. Geary's Amended Bill--Adopted by the Senate After a\r\nLengthy Debate--Effect of the Tariff Laws Upon Wages and Prices--\r\nSenator Hale's Resolution--Carlisle's Speech in Opposition to High\r\nPrices--My Reply--Résumé of My Opinions on the Policy of Protection\r\n--Reception by the Ohio Republican Association--Refutation of a\r\nNewspaper Slander Upon H.

There was much excitement and great diversity\r\nof opinion as to the result of the senatorial election.  Several\r\nof the members, whose preference I knew, would not declare their\r\nvote, with the mistaken idea that to remain silent would relieve\r\nthem from importunity, but before the decisive vote was taken in\r\ncaucus I was confident of success.\r\n\r\nThe caucus met on Wednesday evening, the 6th of January.  It was\r\ncomposed of the Republican members of both houses.  L. C. Laylin,\r\na friend of mine, who had been elected speaker of the house of\r\nrepresentatives, was made chairman of the caucus.  An attempt was\r\nmade by the friends of Foraker to secure a secret ballot, but this\r\nwas defeated.  The decisive vote was then taken, in which I received\r\n53 votes, Foraker 38, Foster 1 and McKinley 1.  My nomination was\r\nthen made unanimous, and I was subsequently elected by the legislature\r\nfor the term ending March 4, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe caucus appointed a committee of its members to escort Foraker\r\nand myself to the hall of the house of representatives, where we\r\nwere received with hearty applause.  We were introduced by Speaker\r\nLaylin, and our speeches will show that if we were combatants we\r\nappreciated the merits of our respective adversaries.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Senators, Representatives and Fellow Citizens:--I return to you\r\nmy most grateful thanks for the very high honor you have conferred\r\nupon me.  Long trusted by the people of Ohio, I am under obligations\r\nthat I cannot express in any language at my command.  I owe to them\r\n--I owe to you--all that could be said from a heart overflowing.\r\n\r\n\"We have just passed through quite a contest, the most formidable\r\nthat I have ever encountered in Ohio, and I hope more formidable\r\nthan I will ever be called upon to encounter hereafter.  I know,\r\ngentlemen, that you have been called upon to make a choice which\r\nwas unpleasant to you because you would have liked to vote for both\r\nof us, and would have been glad to have two Senators to elect\r\ninstead of one.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to say that in this contest I have held, in my language\r\nand in my heart, the highest feelings of respect and honor for the\r\ngentleman who was my competitor, and who is now before you.  He is\r\nentitled to the love and affection of the people of Ohio, and if\r\nyou have given me this high honor because of my experience, you\r\nhave not underrated the high qualities, mental and moral, of Governor\r\nForaker.  Although you have been engaged in this friendly contest,\r\nwe are all Republicans and I trust ever will be Republicans, true\r\nto our cause, and true to the principles we advocate.  I again\r\nreturn to you, as the senators and representatives of our state,\r\nmy thanks for this almost unequaled honor.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Foraker said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Caucus and Fellow Citizens:--I\r\nam informed that, so far as you are concerned, the senatorial\r\ncontest is ended, and I have come here in response to your kind\r\ninvitation to say that so far as I am concerned it is ended also.\r\n\r\n\"You did not end it as I had hoped you might, but you are the duly\r\naccredited and authorized representatives of the Republicans of\r\nOhio, and your will is law unto me and mine.\r\n\r\n\"As Senator Sherman has said, we have been having something of a\r\ncontest.  For the last ten days we have been divided into Sherman\r\nmen and Foraker men, and we have been striving against each other.\r\nThere has been possibly some rasping and some friction, but at this\r\nhour it is our highest duty to remember that from now on henceforth,\r\nin the language again of the Senator, we must remember that we are\r\nno longer Sherman men nor Foraker men, but Republicans all.\r\n\r\n\"Let us here and now put behind us, with the contest to which it\r\nbelongs, whatever unkindliness of feeling, if there be any at all,\r\nthat may have been engendered.  So far as I am concerned, I am glad\r\nto be able to say to you, gentlemen of the 70th general assembly,\r\nthat I have not an unkind thought toward any one of you, no matter\r\nwhether he has been friend or foe.  I have no resentments, no\r\nbitterness of feeling to carry with me.  On the contrary, I shall\r\ngo back to the pursuit of my profession with my mind and my heart\r\nfilled with only grateful recollection and a pleasurable, and I\r\ntrust a pardonable, pride for the gallant, intrepid band who have\r\nhonored me with their support in this contest.  Without any\r\ndisposition to criticise or find fault in the slightest degree,\r\nbut only as an excuse in so far as that may be necessary for\r\nenlisting in a cause than has been crowned, not with success, but\r\nwith defeat, let me say to these friends that when we entered upon\r\nit I did not foresee some of its features.  I was not aware then,\r\nas we have since come to know, that we have had to fight, not only\r\nthe Republicans of Ohio who were against us, but, because it was\r\ngrand old John Sherman on the other side, and with him the whole\r\nUnited States of America.  The Senator has said he don't want any\r\nmore contests like this.  I thank him for the compliment, and vouch\r\nto you that I don't want ever against to cross swords with a\r\nSherman.\"\r\n\r\nThe 52nd Congress met on the 7th of December, 1891.  The credentials\r\nof my colleague, Calvin S. Brice, in the usual form, were presented\r\nand upon them he was entitled to be sworn into office.  If his\r\nright to a seat was to be contested the grounds of the contest\r\nmight be afterwards presented, when the case would be decided on\r\nits merits, but, until it should be determined by the Senate that\r\nhe was not duly elected, he could perform the duties of a Senator.\r\nI was urged to object to his taking the oath of office on the ground\r\nthat he was not a resident of the State of Ohio when elected.  This\r\nI declined to do, but simply gave notice of his alleged disability,\r\nso that it would not be waived in the case the legislature or\r\ncitizens of Ohio should establish the fact that he was not an\r\ninhabitant of that state when elected.  This was not done and no\r\nattempt was made to contest his seat, but I was reproached by\r\nunreasonable partisans for the neglect to do so.\r\n\r\nThe annual message of President Harrison, sent to Congress on the\r\n9th of December, strongly recommended the aid of the government in\r\nthe construction of he Nicaragua Canal.  He highly commended the\r\nMcKinley tariff bill, and said that its results had disappointed\r\nthe evil prophecies of its opponents, and, in a large measure,\r\nrealized the predictions of its friends.  He referred to the large\r\nincrease of our exports and imports, and, generally, gave a hopeful\r\nview of our financial condition.  He recommended that the experiment\r\nof purchasing 4,500,000 ounces of silver bullion each month, under\r\nthe act of July 14, 1890, be continued.  Though silver had fallen\r\nin value from $1.20 an ounce to 96 cents, yet he hoped a further\r\ntrial would more favorably affect it.  He was still of opinion that\r\nthe free coinage of silver under existing conditions would disastrously\r\naffect our business interests at home and aborad.  He approved the\r\napplication of the surplus revenue to the reduction of the public\r\ndebt, and stated that since the 1st of March, 1889, there had been\r\nredeemed of interest-bearing securities $259,079,350, resulting in\r\na reduction of the annual interest charge of $11,684,675.  On the\r\nwhole the message of the President and the report of Secretary\r\nFoster presented a favorable state of our national finances.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the 52nd Congress was not to engage in political\r\ndebate, especially on financial questions, as it was divided on\r\npolitical lines, the Senate being Republican, and the House\r\nDemocratic.  The current business did not present such questions\r\nuntil Senator Morgan, on the 30th of March, 1892, introduced\r\nresolutions directing the committee on finance to make examinations\r\nand report upon six different propositions, embracing the whole\r\nfinancial system of the United States, and to do it promptly.  I\r\nhad no objection to the passage of the resolutions, though they\r\nwere imperative in tone, but naturally supposed they were brought\r\nin merely as a text for a speech, and suggested to Morgan that he\r\nprepare a bill that would carry out his views and have that referred\r\nto the committee.  He said:  \"I do not expect to refer them.  I\r\nexpect to instruct your committee what to do. That is what I\r\npropose.\"  In introducing his resolutions he said:  \"There is an\r\nevil in the land, a difficulty of most serious embarrassment. . . .\r\nThe people cannot afford to wait without encountering all the\r\nhardships of bankruptcy and ruin. . . . Our differences will not\r\npermit our people to wait further adjustment when they are in a\r\ndeath struggle with poverty and wretchedness.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:  \"If there is such distress as the Senator imagines it\r\nought to be met by specific measures and not by a debating school.\"\r\nI knew that what he wanted was the free coinage of silver.  Upon\r\nthis question both parties were divided.  The states producing\r\nsilver were represented by Republicans who favored a measure that,\r\nin my opinion, would lead to the single standard of silver, and if\r\nthe Senate was to consider that subject I wished it to be distinctly\r\npresented and debated, rather than to enter upon the discussion of\r\na multitude of theories that would lead to no result.  He expressed\r\nthe desire that he and others should have an opportunity to speak\r\non the resolutions, and, in conformity with the usages of the\r\nSenate, they were left on the table for indefinite debate.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of April, Morgan made an elaborate speech covering\r\ntwelve pages of the \"Record,\" in which, as I expected, he elaborated\r\nhis views in favor of the free coinage of silver, and closed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"We are very nearly out of the woods now, and if you will add the\r\nfree coinage of silver on equal terms with gold, and will cause\r\nthe treasury of the United States to coin the silver that is there\r\non the same terms that it does gold, I believe that we shall soon\r\nmaster every difficulty in our way.  Then the honorable Senator\r\nfrom Ohio would have the right to rejoice, and, contrary to his\r\nwill, he would be led up into such high positions that he would be\r\nable, at last, to bless the country when he did not expect to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBelieving, as I did, that to continue this debate would be a\r\nfruitless waste of time, and interfere with the current business\r\nof Congress, I said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend to engage in this discussion, but still I wish to\r\nascertain the sense of the Senate.  If we are to have a general\r\nsilver debate now, to the displacement of all other business, I\r\nshould like to have that point tested; and, in order to settle it\r\ndefinitely, without engaging in the debate at all, I move to lay\r\nthe pending resolutions on the table.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Teller, the leader of the \"silver Senators,\" as they are called,\r\nwith some excitement, said:\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Ohio, flushed, perhaps, with the victory apparently\r\nin the other House against silver, seems to think he can down the\r\ndebate in this body on the subject.  I want to say to the Senator\r\nthat we spent some time during the last session to prevent him,\r\nand others who thought with him, from securing a rule that would\r\ncut off debate in this body, and the Senator might as well meet\r\nthe question now as at any time; that this question will be debated,\r\nand if not upon this, upon some other resolution. . . . I give\r\nnotice that, under the rules of the Senate, we are able to be heard,\r\nand that we will be heard, in despite of the honorable Senator from\r\nOhio, who appears to be so anxious to stifle debate.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied:\r\n\r\n\"I deny, in the most emphatic terms, that I have endeavored to\r\nstifle debate.  There is no ground for such an assertion.  There\r\nis not an iota of ground upon which such an assertion can be made.\r\nI never objected in my life, and I have been here longer than any\r\nof you, to any Senator speaking at any time when he chose upon any\r\nsubject; and every man here knows it. . . . I am willing to discuss,\r\nand I never shrink from debate on, the silver question, or the gold\r\nquestion, or the currency question.  I have not been willing, at\r\nall times, to talk at all hours, and reply to every gentleman who\r\nmight choose to make a speech; but whenever the Senate undertakes\r\nto engage in this debate, I will take my share of it, and I will\r\ntake my responsibility for it.\"\r\n\r\nI then proceeded at some length to reply to Morgan.  The debate\r\nwas suspended by the order of business, but it continued from day\r\nto day as opportunity offered, on a motion to refer the resolutions\r\nto the committee on finance, until the 25th of May, when the Senate\r\nrejected the motion by a vote of 17 yeas to 28 nays.  This vote\r\nwas a clear indication that a majority of the Senate favored the\r\nfree coinage of silver.  I then, while criticising the terms of\r\nthe resolutions, expressed my desire that they should be adopted.\r\nThis led to a desultory debate in which I took part, and on the\r\nmorning of the next day, having the floor, said:\r\n\r\n\"I regret as much as anyone can the unusual and remarkable\r\ninterposition of this question, by the Senator from Alabama, at\r\nevery stage of our business.  Now, the whole of the morning hour\r\nhad been wasted except the ten minutes which I shall occupy, and\r\nprobably nothing could have been done in that time.\r\n\r\n\"An arraignment has been made of the committee on finance as if it\r\nhad neglected to perform its duty.  I am not authorized to speak\r\nfor the committee except as one of its members.  Its chairman, the\r\nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Morrill, is here to speak for it, but\r\nthe committee on finance has never for a moment evaded or avoided\r\nthe issue of the free coinage of silver.  It has never delayed a\r\nbill, so far as my knowledge extends, upon that subject.  Very soon\r\nafter the bill of the Senator from Nevada was introduced it was\r\nconsidered and reported adversely.  I believe two-thirds of the\r\nmembers of the committee were opposed to the bill as it stood.\r\nThere has not been a day nor an hour, in the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness of the Senate, when, upon the motion of anyone, that bill\r\ncould not have been taken up if a majority of Senators were in\r\nfavor of it, but, unfortunately for the Senator, a majority of the\r\nSenators were not in favor of taking it up and interposing it in\r\nplace of all the other business.  Therefore, this mode is adopted\r\nto bring it here before the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock I gave way to the regular order of business.  Mr.\r\nStewart then moved to take up his bill, introduced early in the\r\nsession, to provide for the free coinage of gold and silver bullion.\r\nIt had been referred to the committee on finance, reported adversely,\r\nand was on the calendar, subject to a motion to take it up at any\r\ntime.  This again presented directly to the Senate the policy of\r\nthe free coinage of silver.  The motion was agreed to by the vote\r\nof yeas 28, nays 20.  The resolutions of Morgan were practically\r\nsuspended and the vote on taking up the silver bill indicated its\r\npassage.  Mr. Teller opened the debate for free coinage.  On the\r\n31st of May I commenced a very long speech, opening as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I do not regard the bill for the free coinage of silver as a party\r\nmeasure or a political measure upon which parties are likely to\r\ndivide.  It is in many respects a local measure, not exactly in\r\nthe sense in which General Hancock said in regard to the tariff\r\nthat it was a local question, but it is largely a local question.\r\nYet, at the same time, it is a question of vast importance.  No\r\nquestion before the Senate of the United States at this session is\r\nat all to be compared with it in the importance of its effects upon\r\nthe business interests of the country.  It affects every man, woman\r\nand child in our broad land, the rich with his investments, the\r\npoor with his labor.  Everybody is deeply interested in the standard\r\nof value by which we measure all the productions of the labor and\r\nall the wealth of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"Five states largely interested in the production of silver are\r\nvery ably and zealously represented on this floor.  They are united\r\nby their delegations, ten Senators, in favor of the free coinage\r\nof silver.  The south seems also to have caught something of the\r\nspirit which actuates the mining states, because they desire, not\r\nexactly the free coinage of silver, but an expansion of the currency,\r\ncheaper money, and broader credit, and they also are largely\r\nrepresented on this floor in support of the proposition in favor\r\nof the free coinage of silver.  So in other parts of the country,\r\nthose who have been taught to believe that great good can come to\r\nour country by an unlimited expansion of paper credit, with money\r\nmore abundant than it is now, also believe in the free coinage of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\"I, representing a state nearly central in population, have tested\r\nthe sense of the people of Ohio, and they, I believe, are by a\r\ngreat majority, not only of the party to which I belong but of the\r\nDemocratic party, opposed to the free coinage of silver.  They\r\nbelieve that that will degrade the money of our country, reduce\r\nits purchasing power fully one-third, destroy the bi-metallic system\r\nwhich we have maintained for a long period of time, and reduce us\r\nto a single monometallic standard of silver measured by the value\r\nof 371¼ grains of pure silver to the dollar.\"\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to give an epitome of this speech.  It covered\r\nseventeen pages of the \"Record,\" and dealt with every phase of the\r\nquestion of silver coinage, and, incidentally, of our currency.\r\nNo part of it was written except the tables and extracts quoted.\r\nIts delivery occupied parts of two days, May 31 and June 1.  After\r\na careful reading I do not see what I could add to the argument,\r\nbut I might have condensed it.  The question involved is still\r\nbefore the people of the United States, and will again be referred\r\nto by me.  I closed with the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, closing as I began, let me express my earnest belief\r\nthat this attempt to bring this great and powerful nation of ours\r\nto the standard of silver coin alone is a bad project, wrong in\r\nprinciple, wrong in detail, injurious to our credit, a threat to\r\nour financial integrity, a robbery of the men whose wages will be\r\ndiminished by its operation, a gross wrong to the pensioner who\r\ndepends upon the bounty of his government, a measure that can do\r\nno good, and, in every aspect which it appears to me, a frightful\r\ndemon to be resisted and opposed.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate continued with increasing interest until the 1st of July,\r\nwhen the bill passed the Senate by the vote of yeas 29, nays 25.\r\nIt was sent to the House of Representatives for concurrence, but\r\na resolution providing for its consideration was there debated,\r\nand rejected by a vote of yeas 136, nays 154.\r\n\r\nDuring this session of Congress the policy of restricting Chinese\r\nimmigration was strongly pressed by the Senators and Representatives\r\nfrom California and Oregon.  They were not content with an extension\r\nof the restrictions imposed by the act of 1882, which, by its terms,\r\nexpired in ten years from its approval, but demanded a positive\r\nexclusion of all Chinese except a few merchants and travelers\r\nespecially defined and excepted, to be enforced with severe penalties\r\nalmost savage in their harshness.  The position of the two countries\r\nin respect to migration from one to the other had been directly\r\nreversed.  In common with European nations the United States had,\r\nseveral years before, compelled the opening of Chinese ports to\r\nAmericans, insured the protection of its citizens in that country,\r\nand had invited and encouraged Chinese laborers to migrate to the\r\nUnited States.  This was especially so as to the Pacific states,\r\nwhere Chinese were employed in large numbers in the grading and\r\nconstruction of railways and as farmers in cultivating the soil.\r\nThese people were patient, economical and skillful.  Very many of\r\nthem flocked to San Francisco, but they soon excited the bitter\r\nopposition of laborers from other countries, and no doubt of some\r\nAmerican laborers.  This led to the restriction act of 1882 and to\r\na treaty with China, by which that country consented to the exclusion\r\nof Chinese laborers, a degraded class of population known as\r\n\"coolies.\"  It was complained in 1892, and for several years\r\npreviously, that the provisions of the law of 1882 and of the treaty\r\nwere evaded by fraud and perjury.  Senator Dolph, of Oregon, had\r\nintroduced a bill extending the restriction to all Chinese laborers,\r\nwith provisions to prevent evasion and fraud.  A number of other\r\nbills were introduced in each House of a like character.  The\r\ncommittee on foreign relations considered the subject-matter very\r\ncarefully and directed Mr. Dolph to report a bill extending for\r\nfive years the act of 1882, with several amendments providing\r\nagainst frauds.  This bill was passed and sent to the House, but\r\nwas not acted upon there.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February, Thomas J. Geary, a Member from California,\r\nreported to the House of Representatives, from the committee on\r\nforeign affairs, a bill to absolutely prohibit the coming of Chinese\r\npersons into the United States.  On the 4th of April he moved to\r\nsuspend the rules and pass the bill.  After a debate of one hour,\r\nand without amendment, this drastic bill passed.  It came to the\r\nSenate and was referred to the committee on foreign relations,  On\r\nthe 13th of April it was reported to the Senate with an amendment\r\nin the nature of a substitute, which was the bill that had previously\r\npassed the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April I made a full statement of the action of the\r\ncommittee and the scope of the amendment proposed by it.  I had no\r\nsympathy with the outcry against the Chinese, but was quite willing\r\nto restrict their migration here to the extent proposed by the\r\ncommittee.  On the 25th of April the amendment was agreed to after\r\nfull debate, by the strong vote of yeas 43 and nays 14.  In this\r\nform the bill passed.  The House disagreed to the Senate amendment\r\nand a committee of conference was appointed, consisting of Dolph,\r\nSherman and Morgan on the part of the Senate, and Geary, Chipman\r\nand Hall on the part of the House.  This committee recommended the\r\nadoption of the House bill with certain amendments.  The report\r\nwas signed by Dolph and Morgan on the part of the Senate, and Geary\r\nand Chipman on the part of the House.  I stated my dissent from\r\nthe conference report, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Though a member of the conference committee, I was not able to\r\nget the consent of my own judgment to sign this report.  I simply\r\nwish to state very briefly the reasons why I did not do it.\r\n\r\n\"I was very willing to provide for any legislation necessary to\r\ncontinue in force the existing restrictions against Chinese laborers\r\ncoming to this country.  The Senate bill did this, I thought, very\r\nbroadly.  It continued in force the old laws.  It provided some\r\npenal sections to punish Chinamen coming into the country in\r\nopposition to the law, especially through Canada.  I look upon the\r\nintroduction of Chinese laborers through Canada as not only an\r\ninsult to our country, but it seems to me an almost designed insult\r\nby the Canadian authorities to allow a class of people who are\r\nforbidden by our laws to come here, to enter a port right on our\r\nborder.  They are charged $50 for the privilege of landing on\r\nCanadian soil with the privilege to enter our country in violation\r\nof our laws.  It is not courteous treatment by the Canadian\r\nauthorities, and it is incidents like this which tend to create\r\nexcitement all along the border, and which some time or other will\r\nno doubt be the cause of great difficulty, because unfriendly\r\nlegislation of that kind, constantly repeated, must tend to create\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n\"The objection I have to this measure is in the addition that has\r\nbeen made to the Senate bill, which provides for a certificate to\r\nbe taken out by every Chinaman lawfully in this country, here under\r\nvirtue of our treaty and by our laws; that they must apply to the\r\ncollector of internal revenue of their respective districts, within\r\none year after the passage of this act, for a certificate of\r\nresidence, and severe penalties are provided for neglect or refusal\r\nto do so.  This inaugurates in our system of government a new\r\ndeparture, one I believe never before practiced, although it was\r\nsuggested in conference that some such rules had been adopted in\r\nthe old slavery times to secure the peaceful and quiet condition\r\nof society.  It is suggested that we act daily upon the same rule\r\nin regard to the Indian tribes on reservations, but that is upon\r\nvery different ground.  The Indians are in our country, they are\r\nconfined to reservations, and treaties have been made, and those\r\ntreaties require them to stay on their reservations.  So we are\r\nsimply enforcing the treaties, and the Indians do not have to get\r\na certificate or be punished.\r\n\r\n\"Now, whether this exceptional legislation, never before introduced\r\ninto our country, except in the possible cases I have mentioned,\r\nis in violation of the treaty, is the real question and the real\r\ndoubt upon which I stand.  I care nothing about the exclusion of\r\nChinese laborers from our country, because I believe their habits\r\nare inconsistent with our civilization, and, as soon as we can get\r\nrid of them properly, according to the treaty, I am willing to do\r\nso.  The question is now whether, in the fact of the language of\r\nthe treaty of 1880, it is our right--not our power, but our right\r\naccording to the treaty--to make this exceptional legislation for\r\npeople who are now here under existing law.  The treaty provides\r\nthat the United States may, whenever in its opinion the coming or\r\nresidence of Chinese laborers injuriously affects the interests of\r\nthis country, 'regulate, limit or suspend such coming or residence,\r\nbut may not absolutely prohibit it.'  In violation of that article\r\nof the treaty we expressly provide that these people shall only\r\nhave the right to remain here upon applying, on certain terms and\r\nconditions, for a certificate; that if they lose their certificate\r\nthey are not to be governed by the laws as to other persons; they\r\nare here ticket-of-leave men.  Precisely as under Australian law\r\na convict is allowed to go at large upon a ticket-of-leave, these\r\npeople are allowed to go at large and earn their livelihood, but\r\nthey must have this ticket-of-leave in their possession.  We have\r\nagreed by this treaty not only that we would not discriminate\r\nagainst them in our legislation, but that we would permit these\r\nlaborers to remain in the position of persons 'of the most favored\r\nnation.' . . . Here is a treaty by which China, the most populous\r\nnation in the world, agreed that the United States may exclude the\r\nclass of people of China that we do not want here, making a\r\ndiscrimination against them among all nations of the world.  But\r\nit is done upon certain terms and conditions, that in respect to\r\nthose who are here now they shall be treated as all other peoples\r\nare treated; that no discrimination shall be made against them;\r\nthat no prejudicial mark shall be put upon them.  By the terms of\r\nthis bill I think the treaty is violated, and I, for one, do not\r\npropose to vote for the conference report on that ground.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy debate in the Senate the report of the conference\r\ncommittee was agreed to, and the bill became a law.\r\n\r\nAn interesting debate occurred during this session in respect to\r\nthe effect of the tariff laws upon wages and prices.  No tariff\r\nbill was then pending, but a sub-committee of the committee on\r\nfinance had been engaged for the past year in investigating this\r\nsubject, and had accumulated a mass of testimony in regard to it.\r\nSenator Eugene Hale, on the 27th of June, offered the following\r\nresolution, which gave rise to the debate:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, At no time has so large a proportion of the American\r\npeople been employed at so high wages, and purchasing the necessities\r\nand comforts of life at so low prices, as in the year 1892; and\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, The balance of the trade with foreign countries has never\r\nbeen so large in favor of the United States as in the last year; and\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, Those conditions exist and are largely due to the Republican\r\npolicy of 'protection:'  Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the committee on finance be, and is hereby,\r\ndirected to inquire into the effect of a policy of 'tariff for\r\nrevenue only' upon the labor and the industries of the United\r\nStates, and to report upon the same to the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Hale made a brief speech upon the resolution, and\r\nwas followed by Senator Vest, who quoted many documents, which were\r\nprinted in the \"Record,\" in support of his views.  Several other\r\nSenators participated in the debate which continued from day to day.\r\n\r\nThe full report of the committee referred to, embracing three\r\nvolumes of over six hundred pages each, was submitted to the Senate\r\non the 19th of July, and on the 29th Senator John G. Carlisle, who,\r\nas a member of the committee, had taken much interest in the inquiry,\r\nand had participated in the conversational debate during the\r\npreceding month, made an elaborate speech upon the resolution and\r\nmainly upon the proposition advanced by him, that the result of\r\nthe McKinley law was to increase the prices of commodities, while\r\nit did not increase wages.  His speech was certainly a good specimen\r\nof logic by a well trained mind.  His first proposition was that\r\nit was the unanimous opinion of scientists and statisticians, in\r\nall the great industrial and commercial countries of the world,\r\nthat the prices of commodities had been decreasing, and the rates\r\nof wages, especially in those occupations requiring skill and\r\nintelligence, had been increasing; that capital had been receiving,\r\nyear after year, a smaller percentage of the total proceeds of the\r\nproduct, and labor a larger percentage.  He insisted that the\r\ntendency toward a decline in prices of commodities and an increase\r\nin the rates of wages is the necessary result of our improved\r\nmethods of production, transportation and exchange.  He said that\r\nanyone who contends in this day that high prices of commodities\r\nare beneficial to the community at large, is at war with the spirit\r\nof the age in which he lives, and with the genius of discovery and\r\ninvention, which, during the last half century, has ameliorated\r\nthe condition of mankind by bringing all the necessaries of life,\r\nand many of its luxuries, within the reach of every man who is\r\nwilling to work.  He then entered into an elaborate argument to\r\nshow that the McKinley act interfered with this natural tendency\r\ntowards a decline in the prices of commodities and a rise in the\r\nrates of wages, and made it harder and more expensive for the masses\r\nof the people of the United States to live.\r\n\r\nI do not follow his argument, as, to treat him fairly, it would be\r\nnecessary to state it in full.  It was illustrated by carefully\r\nprepared tables.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, without preparation, I said I would not undertake\r\nto reply to the precise and fair argument made by the Senator from\r\nKentucky, but took exception to the basis of his argument, that\r\nthe cheapness of things is the great object of desire.  I did not\r\nthink so, though the report of the committee did not bear out his\r\nargument as to the effect of the McKinley law, but, on the contrary,\r\nshowed that prices had declined and wages increased since its\r\nenactment.  When cheapness comes by discoveries, by inventions, or\r\nby new industrial processes, the people ought to share in those\r\nbenefits, but as a rule mere cheapness of things is not a benefit\r\nto the people of the United States, especially when they are the\r\nproductions of the people of the United States.  When the wheat of\r\na farmer is worth only fifty cents a bushel or his cotton only\r\nseven cents a pound it is to him a calamity, not an object of desire\r\nbut a misfortune.  I proceeded at some length to answer the points\r\nmade by Mr. Carlisle as I recalled them.  I insisted that the\r\nmagnitude of domestic production and the opportunities to labor\r\nwere matters of greater importance than the prices of commodities.\r\nIf our needs can be supplied by American labor it is a mutual\r\nadvantage to both the laborer and producer.  The larger the product\r\nof American labor the greater is the wealth and comfort of American\r\ncitizens.  If American labor is actively employed there can be no\r\ndifficulty in the laborer obtaining the necessaries of life.  I\r\nquoted the opinions of the Presidents of the United States, including\r\nJefferson, Madison, Monroe and Jackson, as the friends and supporters\r\nof the doctrine of the present Republican party on the subject of\r\nprotection.  Mr. Jefferson, especially, announced, as among the\r\nfirst and vital principles of his party, the protection of American\r\nindustries, the diversity of employment and the building up of\r\nmanufactures.  Andrew Jackson repeatedly made the same declaration.\r\nThe platform upon which he was elected was \"That an adequate\r\nprotection to American industry is indispensable to the prosperity\r\nof this country; and that an abandonment of the policy at this\r\nperiod would be attended with consequences ruinous to the best\r\ninterest of the nation.\"\r\n\r\nI insisted that the object of protection--the employment of American\r\nlabor--was of more importance than the price of food or clothing,\r\nthough I believed, with Mr. Carlisle, that the tendency of a constant\r\nfalling of the prices of the necessaries of life would go on without\r\nregard to the duties on imported goods, as the natural result of\r\ninvention and skill.\r\n\r\nMy speech of an hour or two was frequently interrupted, but it\r\ncontains the substance of opinions I have always entertained in\r\nrespect to protective duties.  My object has always been to seek\r\nto advance the interests of American workingmen in all kinds of\r\nindustries, whether mechanical, agricultural, scientific or otherwise.\r\nWhether the cost of the necessities are increased or diminished by\r\nthis policy is a matter of comparative indifference, so that the\r\npeople are employed at fair wages in making or producing all the\r\narticles that can be profitably produced in the United States.\r\nThe gist of my opinions on the policy of protection is contained\r\nin the following paragraphs of this speech:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever tariff duties are levied at a higher rate than sufficient\r\nto compensate our laboring men in the different rates of wages they\r\nare fairly entitled to receive, then I am against the tariff act.\r\nI have never favored any tariff that, in my judgment, did not\r\nfurnish sufficient and ample protection to American labor.  As to\r\nAmerican capital, it needs no protection.  The capital of our\r\ncountry has grown so fast, so large, so great, that it does not\r\nneed protection.  We are able to engage in any kind of manufacturing\r\nindustry.  We are able, so far as the capital of our country is\r\nconcerned, to compete with foreign production.  The rates of interest\r\non money in this country have fallen very nearly, though not quite,\r\nto the European rates.  Therefore, capital needs no protection.\r\nIt ought to demand no protection, but it ought to demand, and it\r\nought to receive, in every branch of American industry which can\r\nbe carried on here with profit, that degree of protection which\r\nwill enable the manufacturer to pay to the American laborer American\r\nwages, according to American standards, to satisfy the wants which\r\nare required by the average American citizen, and that is all that\r\nis desired.\"\r\n\r\nHaving referred to the principal measures of Congress during the\r\nlong session of 1891-92, I recur to some of the personal events\r\nthat followed my re-election.  It was received with general approval\r\nby the press of the United States.  On the evening of the 30th of\r\nJanuary, 1892, the Ohio Republican Association, at Washington,\r\nextended to me a reception at the National Rifles' Armory.  Several\r\nhundred invitations had been issued, and very few declined.  The\r\nhall was beautifully decorated with flags, and in the gallery the\r\nMarine Band was stationed and rendered patriotic airs.  I was\r\nintroduced to the audience by Thomas B. Coulter, the president of\r\nthe association.  He deplored the illness of Secretary Charles\r\nFoster, who was to have delivered the address of welcome, and then\r\nintroduced S. A. Whitfield, who made a complimentary address,\r\nclosing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"You have gone through all these years of public life without a\r\nstain upon your honored name.  The recent election in Ohio demonstrated\r\nthe honor in which you are held by the people of your state.  It\r\nwas that which has given us this opportunity to pay you this respect,\r\nwe, of the Ohio Association, who are here to welcome you.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I made a brief reply, expressing my hearty thanks.  John\r\nWanamaker, Postmaster General, made an interesting address, full\r\nof humor and kindness, and was followed by several Members of\r\nCongress, among whom was my neighbor, Michael D. Harter.\r\n\r\nThe only incident of an unpleasant nature growing out of the\r\nsenatorial contest was an unfounded charge against H. M. Daugherty,\r\nan active and able member of the house of representatives of Ohio,\r\nwho was accused by a newspaper with being corruptly influenced to\r\ncast his vote for me.  He promptly denounced the slander, and\r\ndemanded an investigation.  Noticing the publication and his denial,\r\nI wrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Senate Chamber,              }\r\n  \"Washington, January 18, 1892.}\r\n\"Hon. H. M. Daugherty.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--I notice in Saturday's 'Journal' that you intend to\r\npush to a trial some of the men who most unjustly libeled you, and\r\nindirectly libeled me.  I think so clear and strong a case of gross\r\ninjustice ought to be punished if the law can furnish any relief,\r\nand I sympathize with you, and will stand by you in the effort to\r\nreach the guilty parties.\r\n\r\n\"No one can know better than I the frank, manly and disinterested\r\ncourse you pursued in the contest for the organization of the house,\r\nand the election of Senator, and no one can know better than I how\r\nfalse the imputation made against you was.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to say that in the whole contest I never used one dollar\r\nof money to corrupt or influence the vote or judgment of any member\r\nof the legislature, and that the charge that you received, or were\r\nto receive, $3,500, or any other sum of money, is absolutely false\r\nand malicious.  Whenever you desire me to testify to this, I will\r\ngladly do so.\r\n\r\n  \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed by the general assembly, who examined\r\nwitnesses, and, after reciting the evidence, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are unable to find one iota of evidence that would lead us to\r\nbelieve that the said H. M. Daugherty either received, or asked,\r\nor was offered, any consideration for his vote for John Sherman,\r\nfor United States Senator, or that anyone received, or asked, or\r\nwas offered, the same for him, or that he was in any way unduly or\r\ncorruptly influenced to cast his vote for the said John Sherman,\r\nbut that, in voting for the said John Sherman, Mr. Daugherty followed\r\nthe instructions received by him from his constituents.  We herewith\r\nsubmit all the evidence taken by us in this examination, and make\r\nthe same a part of this report.\r\n\r\n  \"Respectfully submitted,\r\n  \"A. H. Strock,\r\n  \"J. C. Heinlein,\r\n  \"W. A. Reiter,\r\n  \"John D. Beaird.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"State Journal\" said:\r\n\r\n\"After the report was read and adopted members crowded around Mr.\r\nDaugherty and congratulated him.  These expressions of good will\r\nwere too much for Mr. Daugherty's composure, and tears came unbidden\r\nto his eyes.  He felt the stigma placed upon his good name by the\r\ninsinuations of the Democratic newspapers very keenly, although\r\nnot one member of the house believed the stories.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period many interviews with me were published.  It is the\r\ncustom of newspaper letter writers, who are generally bright\r\nintelligent men, to call upon a Senator or Member with some current\r\nstory of the hour and then interview him.  A brief interview is\r\noften expanded into a long article in a newspaper, founded sometimes\r\nnot upon the conversation but upon speeches, writings and known\r\nopinions of the person interviewed.  When this is fairly and truly\r\ndone it answers the purpose of the letter writer, and the person\r\ninterviewed has no cause of complaint.  This was especially the\r\ncase with the letters of George Alfred Townsend.  His letter of\r\nFebruary 26, 1892, was but one of many which entered into details\r\nthat I could not deny, embracing anecdotes and incidents hardly\r\nworthy of preservation, but forming a part of the gossip of the\r\nhour.  The newspaper reporter, as distinguished from the letter\r\nwriter, does not seek as a rule to verify his views, but flashes\r\nby telegraph the current report of the moment.  In this way it was\r\nstated in the New York \"World,\" on the 29th of February, that I\r\nwas about to resign and that Foster was to take my place, that I\r\nwas to edit General Sherman's letters, and ample details were given\r\nof arrangements for the future--not a word of which was true.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of February, I received a letter from the\r\nCitizens' Republican Association of Cincinnati, of which Lewis\r\nVoigt was president, the occasion of which is stated in my reply.\r\nI knew, from my observation in the summer and fall previous, that\r\na single man held and controlled the Republican nominations in\r\nHamilton county and that he, in effect, had cast ten votes in the\r\nOhio house of representatives--one refusing to obey instructions--\r\nand three votes in the senate on the election of a United States\r\nSenator, when I knew and they knew that the people of that county\r\nwere divided in opinion between Foraker and myself, but they had\r\ncommitted themselves to their \"boss\" to vote for Senator as he\r\nshould direct, in order to secure his \"influence\" in the primaries.\r\nI knew that if I answered the letter of the association truly I\r\nwould be reproached by the timid with the cry \"Hush,\" \"Hush,\" but\r\nI felt it was my duty to answer and I did, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Washington, D. C., February 29, 1892.\r\n\"Messrs. Lewis Voigt, Chairman; Evan Evans, Secretary, and others:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--Your note of the 22nd inst. is received.  You state\r\nthat you were appointed by a Republican meeting, held at the Lincoln\r\nclub, that had 'for its object' the overthrow of a gang in Hamilton\r\ncounty who have seized and degraded the 'Republican organization.'\r\nYou inclose the circular of your executive committee to the\r\nRepublicans of Hamilton county, proposing an organization of the\r\n'Citizens' Republican Association,' with a view of rebuking corruption\r\nand purifying our party 'affairs from offenses and scandalous\r\nmethods,' and request me to give my opinion of your movement.\r\n\r\n\"While I do not wish to interfere in any way with the methods\r\nadopted by the people of Hamilton county to ascertain the popular\r\nwill, yet I cannot refuse to answer frankly the inquiry of so\r\nrespectable a body of Republicans who complain that the popular will\r\nis defeated by a corrupt gang, using offensive and scandalous\r\nmethods.  My opinion is founded upon information gathered from many\r\nof your citizens and the public press of Cincinnati, as well as\r\nfrom your own statement.  If I am in error as to existing methods\r\nfor the control of nominations and the corrupt practices of political\r\nmanagers, your people can correct me and I will be gladly convinced\r\nof my error.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how any self-respecting Republican can differ with\r\nyou in your effort to secure to the Republican voters of Hamilton\r\ncounty the free and unimpeded selection of candidates for office,\r\nwithout the intervention of a boss or the corrupt use of money to\r\npurchase the nominations.  As I understand, the substantial control\r\nof all local Republican appointments, and nominations to public\r\noffices or employments of every grade in Hamilton county, is\r\npractically in one man, that it is rare that anyone can secure any\r\nplace on the Republican ticket, from judge of the highest court in\r\nyour county, to the least important office, without his consent,\r\nthat this consent is secured in most cases by the payment of a\r\nspecific sum of money, that the money so collected is apportioned\r\nbetween the 'boss' and what is called the 'gang,' and used to\r\ncontrol the primaries for the election of delegates to your county,\r\nstate and congressional conventions, and that when any office\r\ncarries with it patronage it is made the express and implied\r\ncondition in the nomination of the candidate that this patronage\r\nmust be transferred to the 'boss.'\r\n\r\n\"I understand also that the appointments made by your local boards,\r\nand even some federal offices, are in effect transferred to the\r\nsame person to whom applicants are sent and whose recommendation\r\ndecides the appointment, so that one man controls by corrupt methods\r\nnearly all nominations and appointments in Hamilton county, and\r\nthis rule is only tempered by occasional respect to public opinion,\r\nwhen the boss thinks it unsafe to disregard it.  These methods were\r\nstrikingly exemplified in the last county convention, when a decided\r\nmajority of a delegation of ten representatives and three senators\r\nwere nominated for the Ohio legislature, pledged beforehand to vote\r\nfor the person to be designated by the boss when the time came for\r\nthe election of the Senator of the United States.  His decision\r\nwas carefully withheld until the election was over and was then\r\nannounced.  In this way the vote for United States Senator of the\r\nmost populous city and county in Ohio was, during the canvass,\r\nheld, as I believe, for sale, not by the persons nominated as\r\nSenators and Representatives, who are highly reputable citizens,\r\nbut by a corrupt organization which was able to control the\r\nnominations and practically to exercise the power to vote for United\r\nStates Senator intrusted to its nominees.\r\n\r\n\"Surely such a condition of public affairs in Hamilton county not\r\nonly justifies, but makes it imperative, that the Republicans of\r\nthe county should promptly and fearlessly correct these practices.\r\nIt does not diminish their responsibility that similar methods are\r\nadopted by the Democratic party.  A reform by Republicans will\r\ncompel a reform by Democrats, or leave them in a hopeless minority.\r\nPublic attention has been called by you to these conditions, but\r\nthe people alone can furnish the remedy; that is, by general\r\nattendance of lawful voters at the primaries, and by the election\r\nof delegates who will be controlled in their votes by the wishes\r\nof their constituents, and not by the dictates of a boss for a\r\nslate ticket prepared and arranged by him, as was done in the last\r\ncounty conventions.  There is no rule so obnoxious, so easy to\r\nbreak, as boss rule, and there is no rule so enduring, or so wise,\r\nas the unbiased choice and action of a popular assemblage.  Since\r\nI have been in public life, I have not sought to influence nominations\r\nand conventions, and do not wish by this letter to do so, except\r\nto join in your appeal to the electors of Hamilton county to assert\r\ntheir right to make nominations and hold conventions, a right too\r\nsacred to be delegated to anyone, and especially to one who would\r\nsell nominations to elective offices.  When the innumerable offices,\r\nemployments, contracts and labor of a great city, and all the public\r\nimprovements, are made to contribute to a great corruption fund\r\nwhich is used by a single manager, or, as is apt to be the case,\r\nby two managers, one of each party, it tends to destroy the power\r\nof the people, to promote extravagance, to increase taxes, and\r\nfinally to produce riots and violence.  Whenever such methods appear\r\nin municipal governments, it is the duty of good citizens, without\r\nrespect to party, to depose the boss and enthrone the people.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI have never regretted writing this letter and its broad publication.\r\nWhether a reform has been effected in Hamilton county I do not\r\nknow, but my caution against bossism in politics may be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\nSECOND ELECTION OF GROVER CLEVELAND.\r\nOpposition to General Harrison for the Presidential Nomination--My\r\nBelief That He Could Not Be Elected--Preference for McKinley--\r\nMeeting of the National Republican Convention at Minneapolis--\r\nMeeting of Republicans at Washington to Ratify the Ticket--Newspaper\r\nComment on My Two Days' Speech in the Senate on the Silver Question\r\n--A Claim That I Was Not in Harmony with My Party on the Tariff--\r\nMy Reply--Opening Speeches for Harrison and Reid--Publication of\r\nMy \"History of the Republican Party\"--First Encounter with a \"Kodak\"\r\n--Political Addresses in Philadelphia, New York, Cincinnati, Chicago\r\nand Milwaukee--Return to Ohio--Defeat of Harrison.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1892, prior to the renomination of\r\nGeneral Harrison for President and Whitelaw Reid for Vice President,\r\nthe choice of candidates was the general subject of comment.  A\r\ngood deal of opposition to General Harrison was developed, mainly,\r\nI think, from his cold and abrupt manners in his intercourse with\r\nthose who had business with him.  His ability and integrity were\r\nconceded, but he was not in any sense popular.  This was apparent\r\nespecially in New York, that state that nominated him in 1888.\r\nDuring all the period mentioned many names were canvassed, mine\r\namong others, but I uniformly declined to be a candidate, and said\r\nif I had a vote in the convention it would be cast for Harrison.\r\nSome of his friends, especially Charles Foster, complained in\r\npublished interviews that I had not taken a more active part in\r\nsecuring his nomination.  From later developments I became satisfied\r\nthat Harrison could not be elected, that Platt and a powerful New\r\nYork influence would defeat him if nominated.  I therefore preferred\r\nthe nomination of a new man, such as William McKinley, but he had\r\ncommitted himself to Harrison, and, according to my code of honor,\r\ncould not accept a nomination if tendered him.\r\n\r\nThe Republican national convention met at Minneapolis on the 7th\r\nof June.  On the first ballot, Harrison received 535 votes, Blaine\r\n182, McKinley 182, Reed 4, Lincoln 1.  The southern states gave\r\nHarrison 229 votes and other candidates 69, thus securing to Harrison\r\nthe nomination.  Both Blaine and McKinley promptly acquiesced in\r\nthe result.  I did not think the nomination wise, but was reported,\r\nno doubt correctly, as saying to an interviewer:\r\n\r\n\"The nomination is one I expected to be made in the natural order\r\nof things.  The attempt to bring out a dark horse against two\r\npersons evenly matched, or supposed to be so, is an extremely\r\ndifficult feat, because any break from one of the leaders would\r\nnaturally carry a portion of his followers to the other leader.\r\nTherefore, the nomination of Harrison seemed to be the natural\r\nsequence as soon as it appeared that he had a majority over Blaine,\r\nwhich, I think, was apparent from the very beginning.  I think that\r\nthe nomination being made, all will acquiesce in it and try to\r\nelect the ticket.  There was far more discontent with the nomination\r\nfour years ago than there is now.  Then there were rapid changes\r\nmade that were to be accounted for only by agreements and compacts\r\nmade among leading delegates, but that was impossible in this case\r\nbecause the convention was divided between prominent candidates.\r\nI think the Republicans in every state will cheerfully acquiesce\r\nin the result, and hope and expect that we can elect the ticket.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the nominations were made, Ohio Republicans in Washington,\r\nheld a ratification meeting.  Alphonso Hart acted as president of\r\nthe meeting.  He said it was not a matter of surprise that there\r\nhad been a difference of opinion as to candidates at Minneapolis,\r\nwhen the choice was to be made between Harrison, Blaine, McKinley,\r\nReed and Lincoln.  To-day their followers were all Harrison men.\r\nI entered the hall as he was closing and was loudly called upon\r\nfor a speech.  I said I had come to hear the young Republicans,\r\nMcKinley and Foster.  I congratulated my hearers upon the bright\r\nprospect of Republican success, and declared that Harrison would\r\nbe elected because he ought to be.  The following synopsis of what\r\nI said was published in the papers:\r\n\r\n\"President Harrison was all right.  Personally, perhaps, he (the\r\nSenator) would have been in favor of McKinley, but there was time\r\nenough ahead for him; the future would witness his exaltation.  He\r\neulogized McKinley most eloquently and declared him to be one of\r\nthe greatest and best men in public life.  It was the best thing\r\nto nominate Benjamin Harrison and the next thing to do would be to\r\nelect him.  It made no difference whom the Democrats trotted out\r\nagainst him, he could and would win.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator said he was getting old now and did not feel like\r\nworking as he once did.  He wanted to take things easy and let the\r\nyoung men exert themselves.  'Let me,' he said, 'play the part of\r\nNestor and talk to you in a garrulous sort of a way; give you good\r\nadvice, which you do not always heed.  Let me wander around like\r\nthe old farmer and watch the young men toil, but if I can mend an\r\nold spoke or repair a broken wheel call upon John Sherman--he will\r\ndo his best.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July I started from Baltimore, by boat, for Boston,\r\nfor the recreation and air of a short sea voyage.  I arrived on\r\nthe 3rd, and met, as usual, a reporter who asked many questions,\r\namong others as to the condition of the silver bill and whether\r\nHarrison would approve it if it should pass.  I answered, I believed\r\nHarrison would veto it, and also believed that if Cleveland was in\r\nthe chair he would do the same.\r\n\r\nPending this presidential nomination, my mind was fully occupied\r\nby my duties in the Senate.  I made my two days' speech on the\r\nsilver question, already referred to, when the active politicians\r\nwere absorbed in what was to happen in the convention at Minneapolis.\r\nI quote what was said in papers of different politics, not only as\r\ntheir estimates of the speech, but also of the state of my mind\r\nwhen it was made:\r\n\r\n\"The two days' speech of Senator Sherman on the Stewart silver bill\r\nis undoubtedly the greatest speech he has ever made.  More than\r\nthat, it is probably the greatest speech that ever was made in the\r\nSenate on any financial question.  It is interesting to note that\r\nMr. Sherman, after speaking two hours and a half on Tuesday, said\r\nthat he was not at all tired, and was ready to go on and finish\r\nthen.  This was said in reply to a suggestion that the Senate should\r\nadjourn.  For one who has passed his sixty-ninth year, this is\r\nsurely a remarkable exhibition of mental and physical powers.\r\n\r\n\"Such a speech, covering not only the silver question, but the\r\nwhole range of national finance, cannot be reviewed in detail within\r\nthe limits of a newspaper article.  All that can be said about\r\ndetails is that Mr. Sherman has not merely a well furnished mind\r\non the whole range of topics embraced in his discourse, but so well\r\nfurnished that there is no point too small to have escaped his\r\nattention or his memory.\r\n\r\n\"Give him a clear field, such as the statesmen and financiers of\r\nEurope have, where there are no wrongheaded and befooled constituencies\r\nto be reckoned with, and he would be _facile princeps_ among them.\"\r\n--New York \"Evening Post,\" June 2, 1892.\r\n\r\n\"In his latest great speech on free coinage, Senator Sherman, after\r\ndepicting the inevitable disaster which the silver standard would\r\nbring upon the United States--drawing an impressive lesson from\r\nthe experience of countries having a depreciated silver currency--\r\ndeals with the subject of bimetallism in his usual lucid way.  He\r\nhas been called a 'gold bug,' and is no doubt willing to accept\r\nthe epithet if it signifies a belief in the gold standard under\r\npresent conditions.  But he declares himself to be a bimetallist\r\nin the true sense of the term.\r\n\r\n\"What the Senator means by bimetallism is the use of gold and silver\r\nand paper money maintained at par with each other; more definitely,\r\nthe different forms of money of different temporary values must be\r\ncombined together by the law in some way to make them circulate as\r\nequal with each other.  This is accomplished now by our laws and\r\nthe pledge of the government to keep all forms of money at a parity\r\nwith that form having the greatest intrinsic value.  Whether, under\r\nthe law requiring the purchase of 54,000,000 ounces of silver a\r\nyear, silver and gold could permanently be maintained at the same\r\nvalue as money, at the existing ratio of sixteen to one, is a matter\r\nconcerning which the Senator expresses doubt.  He would repeal or\r\nmaterially amend the law of 1890.  Furthermore, he would change\r\nthe ratio.  The increased production of silver and the consequent\r\ndecline in price warrant this course, and it is a financial and\r\nbusiness necessity if silver is to enter more largely into circulation\r\nor into use as the basis of paper.\"--Cincinnati \"Times Star,\" June\r\n4, 1892.\r\n\r\n\"In a conspicuous degree Senator Sherman, of Ohio, represents the\r\nnoblest principles and traditions of the Republican party.  He is\r\nan astute politician; but, much better than that, he is a wise,\r\npublic-spirited, broad-minded statesman.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the financial and economic principles, which are\r\nvital ones, and which must be made the dominating ones of the\r\nRepublican campaign, Mr. Sherman's opinions and convictions are\r\nknown to be in harmony with those of shrewdest judgment and wisest,\r\nsafest counsel.  Mr. Sherman is the strongest, most effective\r\ndefender of the principle of honest money now in public life, and\r\na consistent supporter of the policy of protection.\r\n\r\n\"Within the last few days Mr. Sherman, in one of the most masterly\r\nand cogent arguments ever made in the Senate, has indisputably\r\nproved the length, depth and breadth of his perception of true,\r\njust, safe financial principles and his unconquerable loyalty to\r\nthem.  At a time when the enemies of an honest, stable currency\r\nare seeking to destroy it and to set up in its place a debased,\r\nunstable, dishonest currency, the country would accept this exponent\r\nof sound, wise finance and a reliable, steadfast currency with\r\nextraordinary satisfaction.\"--Philadelphia \"Ledger and Transcript,\"\r\nJune 8, 1892.\r\n\r\n\"While Senator John Sherman's mail is loaded down with letters from\r\nall parts of the country in reference to the presidency, while a\r\nthousand suggestions reach him from all quarters that after all\r\n_he_ is not unlikely to be the man upon whom the Minneapolis\r\nnomination will light, and while the mass of people are listening\r\nwith feverish interest for news from the convention, Sherman calmly\r\nrises in his place in the Senate and delivers a five hours' speech\r\nupon the coinage and the currency, which will not only rank as\r\nperhaps the greatest effort of his own life, but will constitute\r\na text-book upon the subject for half a dozen generations to come.\r\n\r\n\"Men will not read the speech this week; but the unusual circumstances\r\nunder which it was delivered and the curious spectacle of a great\r\nmind discussing so abstract a subject amid the fervid heat and\r\nexcitement attending a national convention of his own party, will\r\nmake everybody look up the speech after the convention is over and\r\ngive it more readers, perhaps, than any speech upon the coinage\r\nand the currency ever had since the foundation of the government.\"\r\n--\"Ohio State Journal,\" June 9, 1892.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adjournment of Congress, on the 5th of August, I\r\nreturned to Mansfield.  At this time the Boston \"Herald\" alleged\r\nthat I was not in harmony with my party on the tariff.  This was\r\nfounded upon an erroneous construction of my reply to Carlisle.\r\nThe article was called to my attention by W. C. Harding, of Boston,\r\nto whom, in reply, I sent the following letter on August 29:\r\n\r\n\"Your note of the 27th is received.  In answer I have to say that\r\nthe Boston 'Herald' in the article you inclose, has totally\r\nmisconstrued my position on the tariff.  I am decidedly in favor\r\nof a protective tariff; one framed with a view not only to secure\r\nample revenue for the support of the government, but with a distinct\r\npurpose to encourage and protect all productions which can be\r\nreadily produced in our country.  I do not believe that a tariff\r\nframed under the doctrine now announced and proclaimed by the\r\nDemocratic party in its national platform can protect and foster\r\nour home industries.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Tilden, and the men of his school, believed that the old\r\ndoctrines of the Democratic party, proclaimed in former national\r\nplatforms and supported by the declarations of Jefferson, Madison\r\nand Jackson, was a wise and constitutional exercise of national\r\npower.  This doctrine has been abandoned and denounced by the\r\nDemocratic platform recently adopted by the Chicago convention.\r\nA tariff framed in accordance with this new doctrine would be\r\nconfined simply to levying revenue duties, excluding the idea of\r\nprotection, and that is the purpose and object of the men who made\r\nthe platform, and of the men in the Democratic convention that\r\nadopted it by a large majority.\r\n\r\n\"Such a tariff might be levied exclusively on articles we cannot\r\nproduce in this country, such as sugar, coffee and tea.  I have\r\nbelieved that as to certain items in different tariffs we have gone\r\nbeyond the line of protection which is necessary to foster American\r\nindustries.  A few rates have been adopted that I think will exclude\r\ncompetition between foreign and American productions and secure a\r\nmonopoly to the American manufacturer.  This I do not believe to\r\nbe a wise policy.  There are some details of the McKinley tariff\r\nbill that may be subject to this objection, but on the whole it is\r\nthe fairest and best tariff, not only for revenue, for the protection,\r\nthat has had a place on our statute book.  The tariff plank of the\r\nRepublican convention at Minneapolis is the clearest statement of\r\nthe extent of protection favored by the great mass of the Republicans\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\n\"The actual result of the McKinley bill has been not only to give\r\nto all American industries reasonable protection, but has increased\r\nour foreign trade, enlarged our exports and our imports, and greatly\r\nencouraged and added to all kinds of American productions, whether\r\nof the field or of the workshop.  I fear the Boston 'Herald' has\r\noverlooked the striking difference between the old position of the\r\nDemocratic party and the one now proclaimed by that party.  The\r\ntendency and drift of the Democratic party is now more and more in\r\nfavor of free trade, and in open opposition to any favor shown by\r\ndiscriminating duties to foster, encourage and diversify American\r\nindustries.\"\r\n\r\nI attended the state fair at Columbus early in September and met\r\nthe leading Republicans of the state.  I noticed an apparent apathy\r\namong them.  The issue between the parties was for or against the\r\nMcKinley tariff.  The parties did not differ materially on the\r\nsilver question, but did differ as between national and state banks.\r\nThe Democratic party had resolved in favor of the repeal of the\r\ntax on state bank circulation, but it was believed that Cleveland\r\nwould repudiate or evade this dogma.  There seemed to be no enthusiasm\r\non either side, but there was less dissatisfaction with the existing\r\nadministration than is usual during the incumbency of a President.\r\nThe country was prosperous.  The people had confidence in Harrison\r\nand the general drift seemed to be in his favor.\r\n\r\nIn September I wrote an article for the New York \"Independent\" on\r\n\"The History of the Republican Party.\"  It was confined chiefly to\r\nthe contention that the Republican party was an affirmative party,\r\nadopting, declaring and executing great public measures of vital\r\nimportance, while the Democratic party was simply a negative party,\r\nopposing all the Republican party's measures but acquiescing in\r\nits achievements.  I insert the closing paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Republicanism, on the other hand, holds fast to everything that\r\nis ennobling and elevating in its history.  It is the party of\r\nnational honor, which has removed the foul reproach of slavery,\r\nand redeemed the plighted faith of the government in financial\r\nlegislation and administration.  It is the party of equal rights,\r\nan unsullied ballot and honest elections.  It is the party of\r\nnational policies, of comprehensive scope and enlightened self-\r\ninterest, by which industry is diversified, labor systematically\r\nprotected, and the prosperity of all classes and sections promoted.\r\nBetween its present policies and the traditions of its glorious\r\npast there is unbroken continuity of patriotic action.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of September, I made my first speech in this canvass\r\nat North Fairfield.  The place, audience, and surroundings gave me\r\na special interest in the meeting.  Thirty-eight years before, I,\r\nthen a young man, spoke at the same place, before a similar audience,\r\nas a candidate for Congress, nominated by a party then without a\r\nname.  Now I was about to address an audience chiefly composed of\r\nmen and women, the children of my old constituents, who had been\r\nborn since my first appearance there.  It is a farming region, well\r\ncultivated, and but little changed in appearance by the lapse of\r\nyears.  The great change was the absence, in the grave, of the\r\nleading men I had met on my first visit, but they were represented\r\nby descendants so numerous that they had to meet in the open grove\r\ninstead of the simple meeting-house of the olden time.  The\r\ncomparatively few old settlers present who had attended the former\r\nmeeting, many of whom had been soldiers in the army, greeted me\r\nwarmly and reminded me of incidents that then occurred.  It was\r\nnatural, under these circumstances, that my speech should be\r\nreminiscent; but, in addition to the history of events, I stated--\r\nI think fairly--the issues immediately involved--of tariff, currency\r\nand coin.  I closed my speech with the following reference to the\r\npresidency:\r\n\r\n\"As to your vote for President I do not believe any Republican has\r\nany doubt.  It does not follow that because a man is President, or\r\nnominated as such, he ought to be lauded to the skies.  We have in\r\nthis republic no gods or demigods.  I know General Harrison as well\r\nas one man ever knew another after an intimate acquaintance for\r\nten years.  He is a man of fine character, so far as I understand,\r\nwithout blemish or reproach.  His ability is marked and is now\r\nrecognized by all parties, I may say, in all parts of the world.\r\nHe has the lawyer's habit of taking the opposite side of a question,\r\nbut before he acts he is apt to be on the right side.  When in the\r\nSenate he did not show the versatility of talent he has exhibited\r\nas President.  All his utterances have been marked with dignity\r\nsuited to his high position, yet with delicate appropriateness and\r\nprecision that will admit no criticism.  I have no controversy with\r\nMr. Cleveland.  I think he is better than his party.  On important\r\nand critical questions he has been firmly right.  But in the choice\r\nbetween them for the high office to which they aspire no Republican\r\nshould hesitate to vote for Harrison, and an honest Democrat should,\r\nin view of the tendencies of the Democratic party on the questions\r\nI have discussed, decide to go and do likewise.\"\r\n\r\nThe next meeting of note that I attended was at the Academy of\r\nMusic in Philadelphia.  I do not recall any meeting that I ever\r\naddressed within four walls more striking and impressive than this,\r\nnot only in numbers and intelligence, but in apparent sympathy with\r\nthe speaker.  Of the persons mentioned by me those who received\r\nthe loudest applause were in their order Blaine, McKinley and\r\nHarrison.  In opening I said:\r\n\r\n\"When I was invited to speak to you I was told that this was to be\r\na meeting of business men, to consider business questions involved\r\nin a presidential election.  I will, therefore, confine myself to\r\nbusiness issues distinctly made between the two great political\r\nparties of our country.  The people of this city of Philadelphia,\r\nthe greatest manufacturing city on the American continent, are as\r\nwell, or better, prepared to decide these issues wisely as any\r\nother equal number of American citizens.  I assume you are not much\r\ntroubled with third parties.  The temperance question will be\r\nsettled by each individual to suit himself.  The only Farmers'\r\nAlliance I know of here is the Farmers' club, who dine sumptuously\r\nwith each other as often as they can and differ with each other on\r\nevery subject.  I assume that you are either Republicans or Democrats,\r\nthat you are for Benjamin Harrison or Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"The questions involved, in which you are deeply interested, are\r\nwhether duties on imported goods should be levied solely with a\r\nview for revenue to support the government, or with a view, not\r\nonly to raise revenue, but to foster, encourage and protect American\r\nindustries; whether you are in favor of the use of both gold and\r\nsilver coins as money, always maintained at parity with each other\r\nat a fixed ratio, or of the free coinage of silver, the cheaper\r\nmoney, the direct effect of which is to demonetize gold and reduce\r\nthe standard of value of your labor, productions and property\r\nfully one-third; whether you are in favor of the revival and\r\nsubstitution of state bank paper money in the place of national\r\nmoney now in use in the form of United States notes, treasury notes\r\nand certificates, and the notes of national banks.\r\n\r\n\"These are business questions of vital interest to every wage\r\nearner, to every producer and to every property owner, and they\r\nare directly involved in the election of a President and a Congress\r\nof the United States.  Surely they demand the careful consideration\r\nof every voter.  They are not to be determined by courts or lawyers\r\nor statesmen, but by you and men like you, twelve million in number,\r\neach having an equal voice and vote.\"\r\n\r\nThe body of my speech was confined to the topics stated.  I closed\r\nwith the following reference to Harrison and Cleveland:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican party has placed Benjamin Harrison in nomination\r\nfor re-election as President of the United States.  He is in sympathy\r\nwith all the great measures of the Republican party.  He fought as\r\na soldier in the ranks.  His sympathies are all with his comrades\r\nand the cause for which they fought.\r\n\r\n\"He has proven his fitness for his high office by remarkable ability\r\nin the discharge of all its duties.  He heartily supports the\r\nprinciples, past and present, of his party.  He has met and solved\r\nevery question, and performed every duty of his office.  His\r\nadministration has been firm, without fear and without reproach.\r\nI do not wish to derogate in the slightest degree from the merits\r\nof Mr. Cleveland.  His highest merit is that he has checked, in\r\nsome respects, the evil tendencies of his party; but he was not in\r\nactive sympathy with the cause of the Union in the hour of its\r\nperil, or with the men who fought its battles.  He is opposed to\r\nthe protection of American industries.  He supports, in the main,\r\nthe doctrines and tendencies of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that the honor, safety, and prosperity of our country\r\ncan be best promoted by the election of a Republican President and\r\nVice President, and a Republican Congress, and, therefore, I appeal\r\nto you to give to Benjamin Harrison and Whitelaw Reid, his worthy\r\nassociate, and to your candidates for Congress, your hearty and\r\ndisinterested support.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this meeting that for the first time I encountered the\r\nkodak.  The next morning the \"Press,\" of Philadelphia, illustrated\r\nits report of the speech with several \"snap shots\" presenting me\r\nin various attitudes in different parts of the speech.  I thought\r\nthis one of the most remarkable inventions of this inventive age,\r\nand do not yet understand how the pictures were made.  The comments\r\nof the daily papers in Philadelphia were very flattering, and\r\nperhaps I may be excused for inserting a single paragraph from a\r\nlong editorial in the \"Press\" of the next day, in respect to it:\r\n\r\n\"His speech is a calm, luminous and dispassionate discussion of\r\nthe business questions of the canvass.  It is pre-eminently an\r\neducational speech which any man can hear or read with pride.\r\nSenator Sherman excels in the faculty of lucid and logical statement.\r\nHis personal participation in all our fiscal legislation gives him\r\nan unequaled knowledge both of principles and details, and he is\r\nremarkably successful in making them clear to the simplest\r\nintelligence.  The contrast between his candid, sober and weighty\r\ntreatment of questions, and the froth and fustian which supply the\r\nlack of knowledge with epithets of 'fraud' and 'robbery' and 'cheat,'\r\nis refreshing.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening, the 11th of October, I spoke in Cooper Union in\r\nthe city of New York.  It was an experiment to hold a political\r\nmeeting on the eve of a day devoted to Columbian celebrations and\r\na night to magnificent fireworks, but the great auditorium was\r\nfilled, and among the gathering was a large number of bankers and\r\nbusiness men interested in financial topics.  I was introduced to\r\nthe audience in a very complimentary manner by Mr. Blanchard,\r\npresident of the Republican club, and was received with hearty\r\napplause by the audience.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Republicans of the State\r\nof New York that at last we have brought the Democratic party to\r\na fair and distinct issue on questions involved in the presidential\r\ncampaign.  Now for more than thirty years that party has been merely\r\nan opposition party, opposed to everything that we proposed, and\r\nhaving no principles or propositions of their own to present.  They\r\ndeclared the war a failure; they were opposed to the homestead law,\r\nthey were opposed to the greenback; they were opposed to everything\r\nthat we did, but now, thank God, they have agreed to have one or\r\ntwo or three issues to be determined by the people.\"\r\n\r\nI then stated the issues involved in the canvass in very much the\r\nsame terms as in Philadelphia, but the speech in New York was made\r\nwithout notes and was literally reported in the \"Tribune,\" while\r\nthe Philadelphia speech was prepared and followed as closely as\r\npossible, without reference to manuscript.  I have now read the\r\ntwo speeches carefully, and while the subject-matter is the same\r\nin both, the language, form and connection are as different as if\r\ndelivered by two distinct persons who had not conferred with each\r\nother.  My long experience convinces me that while it is safe for\r\na person to write what he intends to say, yet it is better to\r\ncarefully study the subject and then to speak without reference to\r\nnotes or manuscript.  This depends, however, upon the temperament\r\nand poise of the speaker.  Nothing is more discouraging to an\r\naudience than to hear a speech read, except it be the attempt to\r\nspeak offhand by a person who has not acquired a full knowledge of\r\nthe subject-matter and does not possess the art of recalling and\r\narranging the method of his address.\r\n\r\nI believe my speech in New York covered all the issues involved in\r\nthe canvass fairly and fully stated.  I arraigned the Democratic\r\nparty, especially for its declaration in 1864 that the war was a\r\nfailure, when Grant was holding on with his deadly grip, and when\r\nSherman and Sheridan were riding to battle and to victory.  This\r\ndeclaration was more injurious to the Union cause than any victory\r\nby the Confederates during the war.  I closed with the following\r\nreference to the respective candidates:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican party has nominated for President, Benjamin Harrison.\r\nWhen a lawyer in full practice, the sound of the enemy's guns came\r\nto his ears, the call of Lincoln filled his heart, and he entered\r\nthe army.  He fought through the war, a brave and gallant soldier.\r\nHe returned again to his profession and to his wife and child,\r\nliving in a quiet suburb of Indianapolis.  He gradually became\r\nrecognized as an able lawyer, and was finally sent to the Senate.\r\nFor six years he sat by my side.  I know him as well as I know any\r\nman.  He is without stain or blemish.  He is a man of marked ability,\r\nan able debater.  He has grown greatly since he has been President\r\nof the United States.  His speeches are models of propriety and\r\neloquence.  In every act of his life while President he had come\r\nup to the full standard and measure of that great office.  If there\r\nwas a controversy with foreign powers, the strongest in the world\r\nor the weakest, he was fair and just, but firm and manly.\r\n\r\n\"His worthy associate is Whitelaw Reid, of your city.  He has been\r\nplaced on the ticket by the side of Harrison.  He is an honorable\r\nman.  I knew him when he was a young reporter, making his living\r\nas best he could, and helping his father and mother.  He has shown\r\nhimself worthy the honor conferred upon him by the Republican party.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I have nothing to say against Mr. Cleveland.  I am not here\r\nto belittle any man.  I have sometimes thought he is better than\r\nhis party, because he has stood up firmly on occasion in resistance\r\nof some of their extreme demands; but there is this to be said of\r\nhim, that he was a man full grown at the opening of the war, an\r\nable-bodied man when the war was on.  I have never known, nor has\r\nit ever been proved, that he had any heart for or sympathies with\r\nthe Union solider or the Union cause.\r\n\r\n\"I know Harrison, from the top of his head to the bottom of his\r\nfeet, was in that cause.  I do not see how any patriotic man, who\r\nwas on the side of his country in the war, can hesitate to choose\r\nHarrison rather than Cleveland.\"\r\n\r\nI returned from New York to Cincinnati, where I had agreed to speak\r\nin Turner Hall on the 14th of October.  This hall had long been a\r\nplace for public meetings.  It is situated in the midst of a German\r\npopulation and is their usual place for rendezvous.  They had\r\nrecently greatly improved and enlarged it, and wished me to speak\r\nin it as I had frequently spoken in the old hall.  It was well\r\nfilled by an intelligent audience, nearly all of whom were of German\r\nbirth or descent.  They were, as a rule, Republicans, but they were\r\nrestive under any legislation that interfered with their habits.\r\nThey drank their beer, but rarely consumed spirituous liquors, and\r\nconsidered this as temperance.  With their wives and children, when\r\nthe weather was favorable, they gathered in open gardens and listened\r\nto music, in which many of them were proficient.  Such was my\r\naudience in Turner Hall.  I spoke to them on the same topics I did\r\nto purely American audiences, and to none who had a better\r\ncomprehension and appreciation of good money of uniform value,\r\nwhether of gold, silver or paper.\r\n\r\nFrom Cincinnati I went to Chicago.  I had been invited by Jesse\r\nSpaulding, a leading business man of that city, to make an address\r\nat Central Music Hall on the evening of the 22nd of October.  As\r\nI was to attend the dedication, on that day, of the Ohio building\r\nin the grounds of the World's Columbian Exposition, I accepted the\r\ninvitation of Mr. Spaulding.  I regarded it as a bold movement on\r\nthe part of business men to call such a meeting in the midst of\r\nthe excitement and hurry of the dedication of the great buildings\r\nof the World's Fair.  Still, that was their business and not mine.\r\nI carefully outlined the points I wished to make, something like\r\na lawyer's brief, and had the order of topics clearly arranged and\r\nengraved on my mind.  I determined to use no word that would not\r\nbe understood by every man who heard me, and to avoid technical\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour appointed arrived I was escorted to the place assigned\r\nme, and faced an audience that filled the hall, composed of men of\r\nmarked intelligence who could and would detect any fault of logic\r\nor fact.  The speech was fairly reported in the Chicago papers,\r\nand was kindly treated in their editorial columns.  After a brief\r\nreference to the Exposition buildings and the great crowd that had\r\nwitnessed their dedication, and the wonderful growth of Chicago,\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"You will be called upon in a short time to elect a President of\r\nthe United States who will be armed with all the executive authority\r\nof this great government, and also a Congress which will have the\r\ndelegated power, for two years, to make laws for the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there is a contest in this country, not between small parties,\r\nbut between great parties.  I take it that in this intelligent\r\naudience it is not necessary for me to discuss the temperance party\r\nor the farmers' party.  The best temperance party is the individual\r\nconscience of each citizen and inhabitant of the United States.\r\nAs for the farmers' party, the Republican party has been the farmers'\r\nparty as well as the people's party since the beginning of its\r\norganization in 1856.  The controversy is between the two, the\r\nDemocratic and Republican parties, as they have named themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The Democratic party has a very popular name.  It means a government\r\nthrough the people.  But the Republican party has a still more\r\npopular name.  It is a government by the representatives of the\r\npeople, and that name expresses more distinctly the true nature of\r\nour government than the name Democratic, but the Democratic party\r\nhas forfeited for more than thirty years the very name of the\r\nDemocratic party, and ought now to be christened the Confederate\r\nDemocracy of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Tribune\" and \"Inter-Ocean\" had friendly editorial articles\r\nabout the meeting, and the \"Tribune\" especially, which in times\r\npast was very far from being partial to me, expressed this opinion\r\nof the meeting and speech:\r\n\r\n\"It was a test of the capacity of Chicago for great popular\r\ngatherings, and a demonstration of its interest in political affairs,\r\nthat, after a week of civic celebration, upon a scale more colossal\r\nthan this country has ever witnessed before and calling for a\r\nmaximum of effort and endurance, Central Music Hall was crowded\r\nfrom gallery to parquet, Saturday night, with thousands of business\r\nmen and others who are interested in the great issues of the\r\npolitical campaign, to listen to the address of the Hon. John\r\nSherman, of Ohio.  It was something more than an exposition of\r\nChicago's vital interest in these issues.  It was a personal\r\ncompliment and a rare expression of the popular confidence in the\r\nveteran Senator, this immense and enthusiastic gathering of\r\nsubstantial citizens after the absorbing and exacting duties of\r\nthe week.  It testifies eloquently to the enthusiasm and determination\r\nof Chicago Republicans in the pending campaign.\r\n\r\n\"It is no derogation of Senator Sherman's abilities to say one does\r\nnot look to him for the eloquent periods of the orator that carry\r\naway audiences on waves of enthusiasm.  His strength lies in his\r\nconvincing statement, his cogency of argument, his array of facts,\r\nand his powerful logic.  No man in the United States, perhaps, is\r\nbetter qualified to speak upon the issues of this campaign than\r\nSenator Sherman.  He appeals to the thought and reason of his\r\nhearers, and he never appeals in vain, and rarely has he made a\r\nstronger appeal than in his Music Hall speech.  The three issues\r\ndiscussed by him were wildcat currency, the silver question, and\r\nthe protective tariff question.  His discussion of the wildcat\r\ncurrency was exhaustive, and he pictured the evils that must flow\r\nfrom its resumption in forcible and convincing terms.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of October, Senator W. P. Frye, of Maine, and I spoke\r\nat Schlitz's amphitheater in Milwaukee.  The notice had been brief,\r\nbut the attendance was large.  The audience was composed chiefly\r\nof German Republicans.  Frye and I had divided the topics between\r\nus.  He spoke on the tariff and I on good money.  On the latter\r\nsubject the people before us were united for a sound currency, all\r\nas good as gold and plenty of it.  I made my speech first, but Frye\r\nmade a better one on the tariff, upon which they were somewhat\r\ndivided.  Such a division of opinion is an advantage to the speaker,\r\nand Frye availed himself of it by making an excellent and interesting\r\naddress.  The speeches were well reported the next morning, an\r\nevidence of enterprise I did not expect.\r\n\r\nAfter my return from Milwaukee to Ohio I made several speeches\r\nprior to the election.  While the Republican meetings were large,\r\nI could not overlook the fact that the Democratic meetings were\r\nalso large, that the personality of Cleveland, and his autocratic\r\ncommand of his party, kept it in line, while his firm adherence to\r\nsound financial principles, in spite of the tendency of his party\r\nto free coinage and irredeemable money, commanded the respect of\r\nbusiness men, and secured him the \"silent vote\" of thousands of\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio the Republican party barely escaped defeat, the head of\r\nthe ticket, Samuel M. Taylor, the candidate for secretary of state,\r\nreceiving but 1,089 plurality.  The national ticket did not fare\r\nquite so well, receiving but 1,072 plurality, and, for the first\r\ntime since the election of Franklin Pierce in 1852, Ohio cast one\r\nDemocratic electoral vote, the remaining twenty-two being Republican.\r\nCleveland and Stevenson received 277 electoral votes, and Harrison\r\nand Reid 145.\r\n\r\nHarrison did not receive the electoral vote of any one of the\r\nsouthern states that were mainly responsible for his nomination,\r\nnor any one of the doubtful states in the north that contributed\r\nto his result, including Indiana, where he resided, and which went\r\nDemocratic by a plurality of 7,125.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the states that voted in the convention for Blaine and\r\nMcKinley gave Harrison their electoral vote.  The Democrats elected\r\n220 Members of the House of Representatives, the Republicans 126\r\nand the People's party 8.\r\n\r\nThe result was so decisive that no question could be made of the\r\nelection of Cleveland.  The causes that contributed to it might\r\nhave defeated any Republican.  It is not worth while to state them,\r\nfor a ready acquiescence in the result of an election by the American\r\npeople is the conservative element of our form of government that\r\ndistinguishes it from other republics of ancient or modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\nATTEMPTS TO STOP THE PURCHASE OF SILVER BULLION.\r\nMy Determination to Press the Repeal of the Silver Purchasing Clause\r\nof the \"Sherman Act\"--Reply to Criticisms of the Philadelphia\r\n\"Ledger\"--Announcement of the Death of Ex-President Hayes--Tribute\r\nto His Memory--Efforts to Secure Authority to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to Sell Bonds to Maintain the Resumption of United States\r\nNotes--The Senate Finally Recedes from the Amendment in Order to\r\nSave the Appropriation Bill--Loss of Millions of Dollars to the\r\nGovernment--Cleveland Again Inducted Into Office--His Inaugural\r\nAddress--Efforts to Secure an Appropriation for the \"World's Fair\"\r\n--Chicago Raises $1,000,000--Congress Finally Decides to Pay the\r\nExposition $2,500,000 in Silver Coin--I Attend the Dedication of\r\nthe Ohio Building at the Fair--Address to the Officers and Crew of\r\nthe Spanish Caravels.\r\n\r\nSoon after the election, and before the meeting of Congress, I\r\nannounced my purpose to press the repeal, not of the entire law\r\nmisnamed the \"Sherman act,\" but of the clause of that act that\r\nrequired the purchase by the United States of 4,500,000 ounces of\r\nsilver bullion each month.  I had, on July 14, 1892, introduced a\r\nbill for that purpose which was referred to the committee on finance.\r\nI feared to press it pending the presidential election, lest the\r\nagitation of the subject at that time should lead to the adoption\r\nof free coinage.  During the short session of that Congress, which\r\nmet on the 5th of December, I did not think it wise to urge this\r\nbill though strongly pressed to do so.  A majority of the Senate\r\nwere in favor of free coinage, and I was not sure but the House,\r\ndisorganized by the recent election, might not concur, and the\r\nPresident either approve it or permit it to become a law without\r\nhis signature.  When criticised for my delay by the \"Ledger\" of\r\nPhiladelphia, I replied, on the 14th of January, 1893, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is as well known as anything can be that a large majority of\r\nthe Republican Senators, including myself, are decidedly in favor\r\nof the repeal or suspension of the purchase of silver bullion.\r\nThey are ready to-day, to-morrow, or at any moment, to vote for\r\nsuch repeal.  It is equally well known that not more than one-fourth\r\nor one-fifth of the Democratic Senators are in favor of such repeal,\r\nand they will resort to extreme measures to prevent it.  They are\r\nopenly pronounced for the free coinage of silver or the continuation\r\nof the existing law.  The pretense made that Republican Senators\r\nwould sacrifice the public interests for a mere political scheme\r\nis without foundation, and I feel like denouncing it.  If the\r\nDemocratic party will furnish a contingent of ten Senators in\r\nsupport of the repeal of the silver act of 1890, it will pass the\r\nSenate within ten days.  The Democratic party as now represented\r\nin the Senate is, and has been, for the free coinage of silver.\r\nI hope the eastern Democracy and Mr. Cleveland may have some\r\ninfluence in changing their opinions.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent events proved the wisdom of this delay.\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1893, I reported from the committee on finance the\r\nbill referred to.  On the 3rd of February the question of the repeal\r\nof this silver purchasing clause was incidentally brought to the\r\nattention of the Senate by Mr. Teller, who announced that it was\r\nnot among the possibilities that it would be repealed at that\r\nsession.  I took this occasion to explain that the reason why I\r\nhad not previously moved to take this bill up was that I was not\r\nsatisfied there was a majority in favor of its passage.  The question\r\nwhy it was not taken up had been frequently discussed in the\r\nnewspapers, but I did not consider it my duty to make such a motion\r\nwhen it would merely lead to debate and thus consume valuable time,\r\nthough any other Senator was at liberty to make the motion if he\r\nchose to do so.  A motion to take it up was subsequently made by\r\nSenator Hill and defeated by a vote of yeas 23, nays 42.\r\n\r\nNo action was taken on the bill, and I only mention it in view of\r\nsubsequent events.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Senate convened on the 18th of January, 1893,\r\nI arose and announced the death of ex-President Hayes in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\"It becomes my painful duty to announce to the Senate the death of\r\nRutherford Birchard Hayes, at his residence in Fremont, Ohio, last\r\nevening at eleven o'clock.  By the usage of the Senate, when one\r\nwho has been President of the United States dies during the session\r\nof the Senate, it has been, as a mark of respect to his memory,\r\nrecorded his death upon its journal and suspended its duties for\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\"President Hayes held high and important positions during his life,\r\nhaving been a gallant and distinguished Union soldier during the\r\nwar, a Member of Congress, three times Governor of the State of\r\nOhio, and President of the United States.  He was a man of marked\r\nability, untarnished honor, unblemished character, and faithful in\r\nthe discharge of all his duties in every relation of life, against\r\nwhom no word of reproach can be truthfully uttered.\r\n\r\n\"It was my good fortune to know President Hayes intimately from\r\nthe time we were law students until his death.  To me his death is\r\na deep personal grief.  All who had the benefit of personal\r\nassociation with him were strengthened in their attachment to him\r\nand in their appreciation of his generous qualities of head and\r\nheart.  His personal kindness and sincere, enduring attachment for\r\nhis friends, was greater than he displayed in public intercourse.\r\nHe was always modest, always courteous, kind to everyone who\r\napproached him, and generous to friend or foe.  He had no sympathy\r\nwith hatred or malice.  He gave every man his due according to his\r\njudgment of his merits.\r\n\r\n\"I, therefore, as is usual on such occasions, move that the Senate,\r\nout of respect to the memory of President Hayes, do now adjourn.\"\r\n\r\nIn this formal announcement of the death of ex-President Hayes, I\r\nfollowed the usual language, but it did not convey my high appreciation\r\nof his abilities, nor my affectionate regard for him.  This I have\r\ndone in previous pages.  His life was stainless; his services in\r\nthe army and in civil life were of the highest value to his state\r\nand country; he was an affectionate husband, father and friend,\r\nand, in all the relations of life, was a honorable man and a\r\npatriotic citizen.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, I offered an amendment to the sundry civil\r\nappropriation bill authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury, at\r\nhis discretion, to sell three per cent. bonds, redeemable in five\r\nyears from date, to enable him to provide for and maintain the\r\nredemption of United States notes, according to the provisions of\r\nthe resumption act of January 14, 1875, to the extent necessary to\r\ncarry that act into full effect.  I stated in explanation of this\r\nprovision that its object was to enable the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, in case an emergency should arise making a sale of bonds\r\nnecessary, to issue a three per cent. bond redeemable at the pleasure\r\nof the United States after five years instead of a four per cent.\r\nbond running thirty years, or a four and a half per cent. bond\r\nrunning fifteen years, or a five per cent. bond running ten years,\r\nwhich were the only bonds he could sell under existing law.\r\n\r\nAfter a long debate the amendment was agreed to by the vote of 30\r\nyeas and 16 nays.  It was not agreed to by the House and the question\r\npresented was whether the Senate would recede from the amendment.\r\nI regarded this provision as of vital importance, and urged the\r\nSenate to insist upon the amendment, not only as an act of wise\r\npublic policy, but as one of justice to the incoming administration.\r\nIn discussing this proposition, on the 1st of March, I said:\r\n\r\n\"This conference report presents for our consideration again a\r\nquestion of the importance, necessity, and propriety of the amendment\r\nknown as the bond amendment which I had the honor to offer, and\r\nwhich had the sanction of the committee on finance of this body\r\nand of a very large majority of the Senate; but for want of time\r\nand the multitude of amendments pending there has been no vote in\r\nthe House of Representatives which enables us to know what is the\r\nreal opinion of that body on the subject.  I can say no more on\r\nthat point except to express the confident belief that if the vote\r\nhad been taken the House would have concurred in the amendment.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is due to us and due to the committee of which I am a\r\nmember that the exact history of that amendment shall be stated,\r\nand then the Senate may act upon it as it sees proper.\"\r\n\r\nI then quoted the amendment as follows:\r\n\r\n\"To enable the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for and to\r\nmaintain the redemption of United States notes according to the\r\nprovisions of the act approved January 14, 1875, entitled 'An act\r\nto provide for the resumption of specie payments,' and, at the\r\ndiscretion of the secretary, he is authorized to issue, sell, and\r\ndispose of, at not less than par in coin, either of the description\r\nof bonds authorized in said act, or bonds of the United States\r\nbearing not to exceed three per cent. interest, payable semi-annually\r\nand redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after five\r\nyears from their date, with like qualities, privileges, and exemptions\r\nprovided in said act for the bonds therein authorized, to the extent\r\nnecessary to carry said resumption act into full effect, and to\r\nuse the proceeds thereof for the purposes provided in said act and\r\nnone other.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing, I said that the resumption act referred to in the\r\namendment contained an important stipulation, the clause of the\r\nresumption act which enabled the secretary to maintain specie\r\npayments, and which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"To enable the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and provide\r\nfor the redemption in this act authorized or required, he is\r\nauthorized to use any surplus revenues, from time to time, in the\r\ntreasury, not otherwise appropriated, and to issue, sell, and\r\ndispose of, at not less than par, in coin, either of the descriptions\r\nof bonds of the United States described in the act of Congress\r\napproved July 14, 1870, entitled 'An act to authorize the refunding\r\nof the national debt,' with like qualities, privileges, and\r\nexemptions, to the extent necessary to carry this act into full\r\neffect, and to use the proceeds thereof for the purposes aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nI then had read to the Senate the character and description of\r\nbonds authorized to be issued under what is called the refunding\r\nact, referred to in the resumption act, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to issue,\r\nin a sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate $200,000,000, coupon\r\nor registered bonds of the United States, in such form as he may\r\nprescribe, and of denominations of $50, or some multiple of that\r\nsum, redeemable in coin of the present standard value, at the\r\npleasure of the United States, after ten years from the date of\r\ntheir issue, and bearing interest, payable semi-annually in such\r\ncoin, at the rate of five per cent. per annum; also, a sum or sums\r\nnot exceeding in the aggregate $300,000,000 of like bonds, the same\r\nin all respects, but payable, at the pleasure of the United States,\r\nafter fifteen years from the date of their issue, and bearing\r\ninterest at the rate of four and a half per cent. per annum; also,\r\na sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate $1,000,000,000 of like\r\nbonds, the same in all respects, but payable, at the pleasure of\r\nthe United States, after thirty years from the date of their issue,\r\nand bearing interest at the rate of four per cent. per annum.\"\r\n\r\nResuming my argument, I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is apparent from these laws, which are fundamental in their\r\ncharacter, that the secretary has imposed upon him not merely the\r\nprivilege but the duty of maintaining or providing for the resumption\r\nof specie payments and the maintenance of the specie standard in\r\ngold and silver coin.  He is also authorized by a subsequent act,\r\nwhich I do not care to have read because it is not necessary, to\r\nmaintain $100,000,000 in gold in the nature of a redemption fund,\r\nor rather that was the minimum limit provided in the law.  In order\r\nto perform this grave duty the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nauthorized, at his discretion, whenever necessary to obtain the\r\ncoin required, to issue a bond bearing four per cent. interest\r\nrunning for thirty years, or a bond bearing four and a half per\r\ncent. interest running fifteen years, or a bond bearing five per\r\ncent. interest running ten years.\r\n\r\n\"It has been feared--I do not say that there has been occasion for\r\nthis fear--that the Secretary of the Treasury cannot maintain the\r\nnecessary resumption fund; that he may have to resort to the credit\r\nof the government, upon which all the greenback issues of the United\r\nStates notes and bonds are founded; that he might have to resort\r\nto the sale of bonds to obtain money, in order to maintain the\r\nparity of the different forms of money in this country and the\r\nredemption or payment in coin, when demanded, of the obligations\r\nof the United States, especially the United States notes, commonly\r\ncalled greenbacks.\r\n\r\n\"When I came, in examining this question, to see whether or not\r\nthe law enacted in 1875 was applicable to the condition of affairs\r\nin 1893, it was apparent to me, as it must have been to every man,\r\nhowever ignorant he might be of the principles of finance, that\r\nthe conditions of our country were such that we would not be\r\njustified, by public opinion or by the interests of our people, to\r\nsell a bond bearing four or four and a half or five per cent.\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, it was manifest to me, as it would be manifest to anyone\r\nwho would look at the question without any feeling about it at all,\r\nthat if we could borrow money at three per cent. on bonds running\r\nfor five years or for a short period of time, always reserving our\r\nright to redeem these bonds within a short period, it would save\r\na vast sum to the people of the United States, at least one-fourth\r\nof the interest on the bonds, and we would save more by the right\r\nto redeem them if a favorable turn in the market should enable us\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that it is a matter of public duty which I am bound to\r\nperform, as being connected with the refunding laws and the resumption\r\nact, that I should endeavor to make suitable provision for the next\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  I knew this law could not take effect\r\nuntil about the time the present secretary would go out, when the\r\nnew secretary would come in.  Therefore, I drew this amendment as\r\nit now stands, and it was submitted to the incoming Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.  He having been formerly a member of the committee\r\non finance and a Member of the Senate, and being familiar with us\r\nall, came before the committee on finance and there stated the\r\nreasons why, in his judgment, it might become, in case of exigency,\r\nimportant for him to have the power to issue a cheaper bond.\r\n\r\n\"He expressed the hope and belief, and I am inclined to agree with\r\nhim, that it might not be necessary to issue these bonds at all,\r\nbut that when the emergency came he must meet it as quickly as a\r\nstroke of lightning; there must be no hesitation or delay; if there\r\nshould be a disparity between the two metals, or a run upon the\r\ngovernment for the payment of the United States notes, he must be\r\nprepared to meet this responsibility in order to obtain coin with\r\nwhich to redeem the notes.  That statement was submitted to the\r\ncommittee on finance in the presence of the honorable gentleman\r\nwho is to hold the high and distinguished office of Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nI proceeded at considerable length to state the difficulties the\r\ntreasury must meet in consequence of the large increase of treasury\r\nnotes issued for the purchase of silver bullion.  The Senate fully\r\nappreciated the importance of the amendment, but in the hurry of\r\nthe closing days of the session it was said that to attempt to\r\nreach a vote upon it in the House of Representatives would endanger\r\nthe passage of the appropriation bill, and therefore the Senate\r\nreceded from the amendment.  It is easy now to see that its defeat\r\ngreatly embarrassed the new administration and caused the loss of\r\nmany millions by the sale of long term bonds at a higher rate of\r\ninterest than three per cent.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1893, Grover Cleveland was sworn into office\r\nas President of the United States, and delivered his inaugural\r\naddress.  It was a moderate and conservative document, dealing\r\nchiefly with axioms readily assented to.  Its strongest passages\r\nwere in favor of a sound and stable currency.  He said that the\r\ndanger of depreciation in the purchasing power of the wages paid\r\nto toil should furnish the strongest incentive to prompt and\r\nconservative precaution.  He declared that the people had decreed\r\nthat there should be a reform in the tariff, and had placed the\r\ncontrol of their government, in its legislative and executive\r\nbranches, with a political party pledged in the most positive terms\r\nto the accomplishment of such a reform, but in defining the nature\r\nor principles to be adopted he was so vague and indefinite that\r\neither a free trader or a protectionist might agree with him.  He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The oath I now take to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution\r\nof the United States, not only impressively defines the great\r\nresponsibility I assume, but suggests obedience to constitutional\r\ncommands as a rule by which my official conduct must be guided.\r\nI shall, to the best of my ability, and within my sphere of duty,\r\npreserve the constitution by loyally protecting every grant of\r\nfederal power it contains, by defending all its restraints when\r\nattacked by impatience and resentment, and by enforcing its\r\nlimitations and restrictions in favor of the states and the people.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a promise broad enough to cover the McKinley bill or the\r\nWilson bill.  I do not criticise the address, for an inaugural\r\nshould contain nothing but thanks and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest at this period centered in the World's Fair at\r\nChicago, to celebrate the quadro-centennial of the discovery of\r\nAmerica by Columbus.  Such a celebration was first proposed as\r\nearly as 1887, to be in the nature of an intellectual or scientific\r\nexposition that would exhibit the progress of our growth, and to\r\ntake place at Washington, the political capital, under the charge\r\nof the national authorities.  As the matter was discussed the\r\nopinion prevailed that the exposition should be an industrial one,\r\nand the choice of location lay between Chicago, New York and St.\r\nLouis.  I was decidedly in favor of Chicago as the typical American\r\ncity which sprang from a military post in 1837, survived the most\r\ndestructive fire in history, and had become the second city of the\r\ncontinent, and, more than any other, represented the life, vigor\r\nand industry of the American people.  The contention about the site\r\ndelayed the exposition one year, so that the discovery of 1492 was\r\nnot celebrated in 1892, but in the year following.  This was the\r\nfirst enterprise undertaken by Chicago in which it was \"behind\r\ntime,\" but it was not the fault of that city, but of Congress,\r\nwhich delayed too long the selection of the site.  I was a member\r\nof a select committee on the quadro-centennial appointed in January,\r\n1890, composed of fifteen Members of the Senate.  On the 21st of\r\nApril, 1890, a bill was pending in the Senate appropriating $1,500,000\r\nfrom the treasury of the United States to pay the expense of\r\nrepresenting the government of the United States in an exposition\r\nin Chicago, in 1893.  I made a speech in defense of the appropriation\r\nand stated the benefits of such an exposition as shown by the one\r\nin London and two in Paris that I had attended.  While the receipts\r\nat the gates for attendance did not in either case cover the expense,\r\nyet the benefits derived greatly exceeded all expenses and left\r\ngreat buildings of permanent value, such as the Crystal Palace at\r\nSydenham, and still more valuable buildings at Paris.  I referred\r\nto the centennial exposition at Philadelphia in 1876, and to the\r\ninnumerable state, county and city fairs in all parts of the United\r\nStates, all of which were of great value to the places where held.\r\nThese gatherings had revolutionized the social habits and greatly\r\nimproved the manners and intelligence of our people, and are likely\r\nto increase in number in the future.  The bill passed, but not\r\nwithout serious opposition, and upon terms extremely onerous to\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nThis course of opposition continued until August, 1892.  The people\r\nof Chicago had raised the enormous sum of $11,000,000 without the\r\ncertainty of any return.  All nations had been invited, and were\r\npreparing to be represented at this exposition.  The attention of\r\nmankind was excited by the enterprise of a city only fifty years\r\nold, of more than a million inhabitants, erecting more and greater\r\nbuildings than had ever been constructed for such a purpose.  The\r\nUnited States had not contributed to the general expense, but had\r\nappropriated a sum sufficient to provide for its own buildings in\r\nits own way, precisely on the footing of foreign powers.  It became\r\nnecessary to borrow more money, and Congress was requested to loan\r\nthe exposition the sum of $5,000,000, to be refunded out of receipts,\r\nin the same proportion as to other stockholders.  This was declined,\r\nbut it was enacted that the United States would coin $2,500,000 in\r\nsilver, and pay the exposition that coin.  Whether this was done\r\nbecause silver bullion could be purchased for about $1,500,000\r\nsufficient to coin $2,500,000, or to make a discrimination against\r\nthe fair, I do not know.  On the 5th of August, 1892, I expressed\r\nmy opposition to this measure.  Both Houses were remaining in\r\nsession to settle the matter, and the President was delayed in\r\nWashington, when, by reason of domestic affliction, he ought to\r\nhave been elsewhere.  I said:  \"Under the circumstances, I do not\r\nsee anything better to be done than to allow the bill to pass.  If\r\nI was called upon on yea and nay vote I should vote against it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of October, 1892, I attended the dedication of the\r\nbuilding erected by the State of Ohio, on the exposition grounds.\r\nThe structure, though not entirely completed, was formally dedicated,\r\nand the keys were duly delivered to Governor McKinley.  On receiving\r\nthe keys he made a very appropriate address.  I was called for by\r\nthe crowd, and was introduced by Major Peabody, president of the\r\nState Board of Managers.  I do not recall the words of my speech,\r\nnor was it, or the various speeches made on this occasion, reported;\r\nbut I no doubt said that the United States was the greatest power\r\non earth, and Ohio was its garden spot.  I made a political speech\r\nthat evening at Central Music Hall, as previously stated.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of the greatest interest at the exposition were\r\nthree Spanish caravels, the exact counterparts of the Santa Maria,\r\nthe Nina and the Pinta, the vessels with which Columbus made his\r\nmemorable voyage of discovery.  These reproductions were made by\r\nSpaniards at the place from which the original vessels sailed, and,\r\nmanned by Spanish sailors, followed the same course pursued by\r\nColumbus to the islands he discovered and from thence sailed to\r\nthe mouth of the St. Lawrence, and following up that stream passed\r\nthrough Lake Ontario, the Welland Canal, Lakes Erie, Huron and\r\nMichigan, to Chicago, more than 1,000 miles from the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nI had been invited by the managers of the exposition to deliver an\r\naddress of welcome to the officers and sailors of these vessels,\r\non their arrival at Chicago on the 7th of July, 1893.  They were\r\nreceived by the managers and a great crowd, and conducted to a\r\nstand in the park of the exposition, where I made my address, too\r\nlong to insert here, but I quote a few paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, Captain Concas and the Officers and Mariners Under\r\nHis Command:--You have before you men and women of all races and\r\nclimes.  They have met to share in this great exposition of the\r\nindustries of all nations.  To-day they celebrate the discovery of\r\nAmerica by Christopher Columbus and the arrival here of the marine\r\nfleet under your command, manned by the countrymen of those who\r\nmade the discovery of the new world.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"We have before us the reproduction of the Santa Maria, the Pinta\r\nand the Nina, the three vessels that made this memorable voyage.\r\nThey are sent to us by the same chivalrous and gallant people who\r\nbuilt the original craft and manned and sailed them under the\r\ncommand of Columbus.  They are striking object lessons that speak\r\nmore eloquently than voice or words.  We welcome them to this\r\nexposition of the industries of the world.  Here, on the waters of\r\nthis inland sea, 1,000 miles from the ocean traversed by Columbus,\r\nin this city, the most marvelous result of the industry and energy\r\nof mankind, we place this mimic fleet side by side with the monsters\r\nthat have come from the inventive genius of the American people,\r\nnot to extol our handiwork, but to extol the men who, four hundred\r\nyears ago, with such feeble means and resources, opened the way to\r\nall the achievements of succeeding generations.  You can look at\r\nthem where they quietly rest upon the waters of the great northwest.\r\nIn such as these one hundred and twenty men sailed on an unknown\r\nocean, they knew not where.  They lived where for two thousand\r\nyears the pillars of Hercules had marked the end of the world.\r\nThey had been taught to believe in the four corners of the earth,\r\nand that all beyond was a boundless waste of waters, into which no\r\none had ventured beyond the Canary Islands and the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"We welcome all the peoples of the earth, with their varied\r\nproductions, to the full and free enjoyment of their habits at\r\nhome, and in return exhibit to them the results of our growth and\r\nindustry.

He said:\r\n\r\n\"This legislation is embodied in a statute passed on the 14th day\r\nof July, 1890, which was the culmination of much agitation on the\r\nsubject involved, and which may be considered a truce, after a long\r\nstruggle, between the advocates of free silver coinage and those\r\nintending to be more conservative.\"\r\n\r\nHe ascribed the evil of the times to the monthly purchase of\r\n4,500,000 ounces of silver bullion, and the payment therefor with\r\ntreasury notes redeemable in gold or silver coin at the discretion\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury, and to the reissue of said notes\r\nafter redemption.  He stated that up to the 15th of July, 1893,\r\nsuch notes had been issued for the purpose mentioned to the amount\r\nof more than $147,000,000.  In a single year over $40,000,000 of\r\nthese notes had been redeemed in gold.  This threatened the reserve\r\nof gold held for the redemption of United States notes, and the\r\nwhole financial system of the government.  No other subject was\r\npresented in the message of the President, and Congress had to face\r\nthe alternative of the single standard of silver, or the suspension\r\nof the purchase of silver bullion.\r\n\r\nI had foreseen this inevitable result and had sought, as far as\r\npossible, to avoid it by the inserting of sundry provisions in the\r\nact of July 14, 1890.  No portion of that act was objected to by\r\nthe President except the clause requiring the purchase of silver\r\nbullion and the issue of treasury notes in payment for it.  In this\r\nI heartily concurred with him.  From the date of the passage of\r\nthat law, to its final repeal, I was opposed to this compulsory\r\nclause, but yielded to its adoption in preference to the free\r\ncoinage of silver, and in the hope that a brief experience under\r\nthe act would dissipate the popular delusion in favor of free\r\ncoinage.  Joseph H. Walker, of Massachusetts, a prominent Member\r\nof the House of Representatives, who was one of the conferees with\r\nme on the bill referred to, and agreed with me in assenting to it,\r\nwrote me a letter, my reply to which was in substantial accordance\r\nwith the subsequent message of the President and with the action\r\ntaken by Congress.  I insert it here:\r\n\r\n  \"Mansfield, O., July 8, 1893.\r\n\"Hon. J. H. Walker.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir:--Yours of 28th ult., inclosing a copy of your statement\r\nof the causes that led Mr. Conger, yourself and me to agree with\r\nreluctance to the silver act of 1890, is received.  An answer had\r\nbeen delayed by my absence at Chicago.  You clearly and correctly\r\nstate the history of that act.  The bill that passed the House\r\nprovided for the purchase of $4,500,000 worth of silver at gold\r\nvalue.  The Senate struck out this provision and provided for the\r\nfree coinage of silver or the purchase of all that was offered at\r\nthe rate of 129 cents an ounce.  As conferees acting for the two\r\nHouses, it was our duty to bring about an agreement, if practicable,\r\nwithout respect to individual opinion.  The result of the conference\r\nwas to reject free coinage and to provide for the purchase of four\r\nmillion five hundred thousand ounces of silver at its gold price--\r\na less amount than was proposed by the House, the provisions\r\ndeclaring the public policy of the United States to maintain the\r\nparity of the two metals or the authority to stipulate on the\r\ncontracts for payments in gold, the limit of the issue of treasury\r\nnotes to the actual cost of silver bullion at gold value, and the\r\nrepeal of the act providing for the senseless coinage of silver\r\ndollars when we already had 300,000,000 silver dollars in the\r\ntreasury we could not circulate, were all in the line of sound\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\"Another object I had in view was to secure a much needed addition\r\nto our currency, then being reduced by the compulsory retirement\r\nof national bank notes in the payment of United States bonds.  This\r\nwould have been more wisely provided by notes secured by both gold\r\nand silver, but such a provision could not then be secured.  These\r\nreasons fully justified the compromise.\r\n\r\n\"But the great controlling reason why we agreed to it was that it\r\nwas the only expedient by which we could defeat the free coinage\r\nof silver.  Each of us regarded the measure proposed by the Senate\r\nas a practical repudiation of one-third of the debts of the United\r\nStates, as a substantial reduction of the wages of labor, as a\r\ndebasement of our currency to a single silver standard, as the\r\ndemonetization of gold and a sharp disturbance of all our business\r\nrelations with the great commercial nations of the world.  To defeat\r\nsuch a policy, so pregnant with evil, I was willing to buy the\r\nentire product of American silver mines at its gold value.\r\n\r\n\"And that was what we provided, guarded as far as we could.  To\r\naccomplish our object we had to get the consent of the Republican\r\nRepresentatives from the silver-producing states.  This we could\r\nonly do by buying the silver product of those states.  It was a\r\ncostly purchase.  The silver we purchased is not worth as much as\r\nwe paid for it, but this loss is insignificant compared to our gain\r\nby the defeat of the free coinage of silver.  It is said there was\r\nno danger of free coinage, that the President would have vetoed\r\nit.  We had no right to throw the responsibility upon him.  Besides,\r\nhis veto would leave the Bland act in force.  We did not believe\r\nthat his veto would dispel the craze that then existed for free\r\ncoinage.  Many people wanted the experiment tried.  The result of\r\nthe experiment of buying four and a half million ounces of silver\r\na month at its market value will be the best antidote against the\r\npurchase of the silver of the world at one-third more than its\r\nmarket value.\r\n\r\n\"I never for a moment regretted the passage of the act of 1890,\r\ncommonly called the 'Sherman act,' though, as you know, I had no\r\nmore to do with it than the other conferees.  There is but one\r\nprovision in it that I would change and that is to strike out the\r\ncompulsory purchase of a given quantity of silver and give authority\r\nto the Secretary of the Treasury to buy silver bullion at its market\r\nprice when needed for subsidiary coinage.  The only position we\r\ncan occupy in the interests of our constituents at large is one\r\nfixed standard of value and the use of both metals at par with each\r\nother, on a ratio as near as possible to their market value.\r\n\r\n\"Such a policy I believe is right.  With reserves both of gold and\r\nsilver in the proper proportions we can maintain the entire body\r\nof our paper money, including coin, at par with each other.  For\r\none I will never agree to the revival of state bank paper money,\r\nwhich cannot be made legal tender, and which, on the first sign of\r\nalarm, will disappear or be lost in the hands of the holder.\r\n\r\n  \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n  \"John Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nI had expressed similar views in speeches in Congress and before\r\nthe people and in numerous published interviews, and in the previous\r\nCongress had introduced a bill to suspend the purchase of silver\r\nbullion, substantially similar in terms to the bill that became a\r\nlaw in November, 1893.  During the month of August I took a more\r\nactive part in the proceedings than usual.  On the 8th, the 16th\r\nand the 18th I made speeches in the current debate.\r\n\r\nA brief statement of the passage of this law of 1893 may be of\r\ninterest.  It was introduced as a bill by William L. Wilson, of\r\nWest Virginia, in the House of Representatives, in the words of\r\nthe bill introduced by me in the Senate on the 14th of July, 1892,\r\nas already stated, and passed the House on the 28th of August, by\r\nthe decisive vote of 239 yeas and 108 nays.  It was referred in\r\nthe Senate to the committee on finance, of which Daniel W. Voorhees\r\nwas then chairman.  It was on the next day reported by him from\r\nthat committee, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute,\r\nbut substantially similar in legal effect to the House bill.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, August 30, I took the floor and made one of the\r\nlongest speeches in my congressional life, covering more than forty\r\nclosely printed pamphlet pages.  I quote a few of the opening\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\"The immediate question before us is whether the United States\r\nshall suspend the purchase of silver bullion directed by the act\r\nof July 14, 1890.  It is to decide this question the President has\r\ncalled Congress together in special session at this inconvenient\r\nseason of the year.  If this was the only reason for an extraordinary\r\nsession it would seem insufficient.  The mere addition of eighteen\r\nhundred million ounces of silver to the vast hoard in the treasury,\r\nand the addition of fourteen millions of treasury notes to the one\r\nthousand millions of notes outstanding, would hardly justify this\r\ncall, especially as Congress at the last session neglected or\r\nrefused to suspend the purchase of silver.  The call is justified\r\nby the existing financial stringency, growing out of the fear that\r\nthe United States will open its mints to the free coinage of silver.\r\nThis is the real issue.  The purchase of silver is a mere incident.\r\nThe gravity of this issue cannot be measured by words.  In every\r\nway in which we turn we encounter difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"If we adopt the single standard of gold without aid from silver,\r\nwe will greatly increase the burden of national and individual\r\ndebts, disturb the relation between capital and labor, cripple the\r\nindustries of the country, still further reduce the value of silver,\r\nof which we now have in the treasury and among our people over\r\n$593,000,000, and of which we are the chief producers, and invite\r\na struggle with the great commercial nations for the possession of\r\nthe gold of the world.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, if we continue the purchase of 54,000,000 ounces\r\nof silver a year, we will eventually bring the United States to\r\nthe single standard of silver--a constantly depreciating commodity,\r\nnow rejected by the great commercial nations as a standard of value;\r\na commodity confessedly inconvenient, by its weight, bulk, and\r\nvalue, for the large transactions of foreign and domestic commerce,\r\nand detach us from the money standard now adopted by all European\r\nnations, with which we now have our chief commercial and social\r\nrelations.  In dealing with such a question we surely ought to\r\ndismiss from our minds all party affinities or prejudices; all\r\nlocal or sectional interests, and all preconceived opinions not\r\njustified by existing facts and conditions.\r\n\r\n\"Upon one thing I believe that Congress and our constituents agree:\r\nThat both these extreme positions shall be rejected; that both\r\nsilver and gold should be continued in use as money--a measure of\r\nvalue; that neither can be dispensed with.  Monometallism, pure\r\nand simple, has never gained a foothold in the United States.  We\r\nare all bimetallists.  But there are many kinds of bimetallism.\r\nOne kind favors the adoption of the cheaper metal for the time\r\nbeing as the standard of value.  Silver being now the cheaper metal,\r\nthey favor its free coinage at the present ratio, with the absolute\r\ncertainty that silver alone will be coined at our mints as money;\r\nthat gold will be demonetized, hoarded at a premium, or exported\r\nwhere it is maintained as standard money.  The result would be\r\nmonometallism of silver.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The two metals, as metals, never have been, are not now, and never\r\ncan be, kept at par with each other for any considerable time at\r\nany fixed ratio.  This necessarily imposes upon the government the\r\nduty of buying the cheaper metal and coining it into money.  The\r\ngovernment should only pay for the bullion its market value, for\r\nit has the burden of maintaining it at par with the dearer metal.\r\nIf the bullion falls in price the government must make it good; if\r\nit rises in value the government gains.\r\n\r\n\"The government is thus always interested in advancing the value\r\nof the cheaper metal.  This is the kind of bimetallism I believe\r\nin.  It is the only way in which two commodities of unequal value\r\ncan be maintained at parity with each other.  The free coinage of\r\nsilver and gold at any ratio you may fix means the use of the\r\ncheaper metal only.  This is founded on the universal law of\r\nhumanity, the law of selfishness.  No man will carry to the mint\r\none ounce of gold to be coined into dollars when he can carry\r\nsixteen ounces of silver, worth but little more in the market than\r\nhalf an ounce of gold, and get the same number of dollars.\r\n\r\n\"The free coinage of silver means the single standard of silver.\r\nIt means a cheaper dollar, with less purchasing power.  It means\r\na reduction in the wages of labor; not in the number of dollars,\r\nbut in the quantity of bread, meat, clothes, comforts he can purchase\r\nwith his daily wage.  It means a repudiation of a portion of all\r\ndebts, public and private.  It means a bounty to all banks, savings\r\ninstitutions, trust companies that are in debt more than their\r\ncredits.  It means a nominal advance in the prices of the produce\r\nof the farmer, but a decrease in the purchasing power of his money.\r\nIts chief attraction is that it enables a debtor to pay his debt\r\ncontracted upon the existing standard with money of less value.\r\nIf Senators want cheap money and to advance prices, free coinage\r\nis the way to do it; but do not call it bimetallism.  The problem\r\nwe have to solve is how to secure to our people the largest use of\r\nboth gold and silver without demonetizing either.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let us examine the situation in which we are placed.  Our\r\ncountry is under the pressure of a currency famine.  Industries,\r\ngreat and small, all suspended by the owners, not because they\r\ncannot sell their products, but because they cannot get the money\r\nto pay for raw material and the wages of their employees.  Banks\r\nconducted fairly are drained of their deposits and are compelled\r\nnot only to refuse all loans, but to collect their bills receivable.\r\nThis stringency extends to all trades and businesses; it affects\r\neven your public revenues, all forms of public and private securities,\r\nand, more than all, its stops the pay of a vast army of laboring\r\nmen, of skilled mechanics, and artisans, and affects the economy\r\nand comfort of almost every home in the land.\r\n\r\n\"The strange feature of this stringency is unlike that of any of\r\nthe numerous panics in our past history.  They came from either an\r\nirredeemable currency, which became worthless in the hands of the\r\nholder, or from expanded credit, based upon reckless enterprises\r\nwhich, failing, destroyed confidence in all industries.  Stringency\r\nfollowed failure and reckless speculation.  This panic occurs when\r\nmoney is more abundant than ever before.  Our circulating notes to-\r\nday are sixty millions more than one year ago.  It is all good--as\r\ngood as gold.  No discrimination is made between the gold and silver\r\ndollar, or between the United States note, the treasury note, the\r\nsilver certificate, or the gold certificate.  All these are\r\nindiscriminately hoarded, and not so much by the rich as by the\r\npoor.  The draft is upon the savings bank, as well as the national\r\nor state bank.  It is the movement of fear, the belief that their\r\nmoney will be needed, and that they may not be able to get it when\r\nthey want it.  In former panics, stringency followed failures.  In\r\nthis, failures follow stringency.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as representatives of the people, we are called here in\r\nCongress to furnish such measures of relief as the law can afford.\r\nIn the discharge of this duty I will sweep away all party bias,\r\nall pride of opinion, all personal interest, and even the good will\r\nof my constituents, if it were necessary; but, fortunately, I\r\nbelieve their opinions concur with my own.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is said that if we stop the coinage of silver it will be the\r\nend of silver.  I have heard that moan from some of my friends near\r\nme.  I do not think it will be the end of silver.  We have proven\r\nby our purchases that the mere purchase of silver by us in a\r\ndeclining market, when all the nations of Europe are refusing to\r\nbuy silver and throwing upon us their surplus, is an improvident\r\nuse of the public money, and it ought to be abandoned, or at least\r\nsuspended until a time should come when we may, by an international\r\nratio or by some other provision of law, prevent the possible coming\r\nto the single standard of silver.  Now, that can be done.\r\n\r\n\"What do we propose to do now?  We simply propose to stop the\r\npurchase.  We do not say when we will renew it again, but we simply\r\nsay we believe, in view of a panic or any possibilities of a panic,\r\nthat it would be idle for us to waste either our credit money or\r\nour actual money to buy that which must be put down into the cellar\r\nof our treasury and there lie unused, except as it is represented\r\nby promises to pay gold.  I say that such a policy as that would\r\nbe foolish and delusive.\r\n\r\n\"Senators say that this is a blow at silver.  Why, silver is as\r\nmuch a part of the industry of my country as it is a part of the\r\nindustry of the state of the Senator from Colorado, the able exponent\r\nof this question.  The production of silver is a great interest,\r\nand the people of Ohio are as deeply interested in the success of\r\nthat interest as the people of Colorado.  It is true we have not\r\nthe direct ownership of the property, but it enters into measures\r\nof value of our property.  There could be no desire on the part of\r\nany portion of the people of the United States to strike down\r\nsilver.  That idea ought to be abandoned at once.  Therefore, in\r\norder to at least give the assurance of honest men that we do not\r\nintend to destroy an industry of America, we put upon this bill a\r\nprovision proposed now by the Senator from Indiana.\r\n\r\n\"I say that instead of desiring to strike down silver we will likely\r\nbuild it up; and any measure that could be adopted for an international\r\nratio that will not demonetize gold will meet my approbation and\r\nfavor.  But I would not dissever the financial business of this\r\ngreat country of ours, with its 65,000,000 of people, from the\r\nstandards that are now recognized by all the Christian nations of\r\nEurope.  I would not have our measure less valuable than the measure\r\nof the proudest and haughtiest country of the world.\r\n\r\n\"This is not a question of the mere interest of Nevada or Colorado.\r\nIt is not a question about what Wall street will do.  They will\r\nalways be doing some deviltry or other, it makes no difference who\r\nis up or who is down.  We take that as a matter of course.  The\r\nquestion is what ought to be done for the people of the United\r\nStates in their length and breadth.  If Congress should say that\r\nin its opinion it is not now wise, after our experience, to continue\r\nthe purchase of silver bullion, is any injustice done to Colorado\r\nor Nevada?  Are we bound to build up the interest of one section\r\nor one community at the expense of another or of the whole country?\r\n\r\n\"No.  I heartily and truly believe that the best thing we can now\r\ndo is to suspend for time, at least, the purchase of silver bullion.\r\nWe should then turn our attention to measures that are demanded\r\nimmediately to meet the difficulties of the hour.  Let this be done\r\npromptly and completely.  It involves a trust to your officers and\r\ngreat powers over the public funds.  I am willing to trust them.\r\nIf you are not, it is a strange attitude in political affairs.  I\r\nwould give them power to protect the credit of the government\r\nagainst all enemies at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\"If the fight must be for the possession of gold, we will use our\r\ncotton and our corn, our wheat and other productions, against all\r\nthe productions of mankind.  We, with our resources, can then enter\r\ninto a financial competition.  We do not want to do it now.  We\r\nprefer to wait awhile until the skies are clear and see what will\r\nbe the effect of the Indian policy, and what arrangements may be\r\nmade for conducting another international conference.  In the\r\nmeantime let the United States stand upon its strength and credit,\r\nmaintaining its money, different kinds of money, at a parity with\r\neach other.  If we will do that I think soon all these clouds will\r\nbe dissipated and we may go home to our families and friends with\r\na conscientiousness that we have done good work for our country at\r\nlarge.\"\r\n\r\nI was frequently interrupted, and this led to the discussion of\r\ncollateral questions and especially the dropping of the silver\r\ndollar by the act of 1873, the history of which I have heretofore\r\nstated.  This speech was a temperate and nonpartisan presentation\r\nof a business question of great importance, and I can say without\r\negotism that it was well received and commended by the public press\r\nand by my associates in the Senate.  Though I sought to repeal a\r\nsingle clause of a bill of which I was erroneously alleged to be\r\nthe author, I was charged with inconsistency, and my speech was\r\nmade the text of the long debate that followed.  The \"silver\r\nSenators,\" so called, attacked it with violence, and appeals were\r\nmade to Democratic Senators to stand by those who had defeated the\r\nelection law, and by the position the Democratic Senators had\r\npreviously taken in favor of free coinage.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of September, and on the 2nd, 13th, 17th and 28th of\r\nOctober, I made speeches in the current debate, which extended to\r\nevery part of the financial legislation of the United States since\r\nthe formation of the government.  I insert here the description\r\ngiven by the Washington \"Post\" of the scene on the 17th:\r\n\r\n\"The climax of the remarkable day was now at hand.  There is no\r\nman in the Senate for whom a deeper feeling of esteem is felt than\r\nJohn Sherman.  He saw the Republican party born, he has been its\r\nsoldier as well as its sage, he has sat at the council table of\r\nPresidents.  His hair is white, and his muscles have no longer the\r\nelasticity of youth, but age has not dimmed the clearness of his\r\nintellectual vision, while it has added to the wisdom of his\r\ncouncils.  Upon Mr. Sherman, therefore, as he arose, every eye was\r\nturned.  Personalities were forgotten, the bitterness of strife\r\nwas laid aside.  In a picture which must live in the memory of him\r\nwho saw it, the spare and bowed form of Mr. Sherman was the central\r\nfigure.  There was not the slightest trace of feebleness in his\r\nimpassioned tones.  Except once or twice, as he hesitated a moment\r\nor two for a word to express his thought, there was not a reminder\r\nthat the brain at seventy may be inert or the fire be dampened in\r\nthe veins.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman spoke, as he himself said, neither in reproach nor\r\nanger.  It was the appealing tones that gave his speech its power\r\n--its convincing earnestness, its lack of rancor, its sober truth\r\nthat gave it weight.  Elsewhere it is printed in detail.  Suffice\r\nit to say here that he predicted that the rules would have to be\r\nchanged since they had been made the instrument of a revolutionary\r\nminority.  Never before had he seen such obstruction in the Senate,\r\nnever before the force bill had he known of a measure which failed,\r\nafter due deliberation, to come to a vote.  The Republicans had\r\nremained steadfast to the President, although under no obligation\r\nto him, and now the time had come when the Democrats must take the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\"In times past, when the Republicans were in the majority, they\r\nnever shrank from responsibility.  They were Republicans because\r\nthey believed in Republican principles and Republican men and\r\nRepublican measures, and whenever a question was to be decided they\r\nnever pleaded the 'baby act' and said 'we could not agree.'  They\r\nmet together and came to an agreement, and in that way they passed\r\nall the great measures which have marked the history of the last\r\nthirty years of our country, and it was not done by begging votes\r\non the other side.\r\n\r\n\"'They say they cannot agree,  They must agree,' thundered Mr.\r\nSherman, drawing himself to his full height, and pointing his\r\nquivering finger to the Democratic side, 'or else surrender their\r\npolitical power!'\r\n\r\n\"Then Mr. Sherman pointed out the important legislation that was\r\nso sadly needed, not the least being some provision for the deficit\r\nof the government, which, he quoted Secretary Carlisle as saying,\r\nwould be $50,000,000 this year.  'These things cannot be evaded,'\r\nhe said, while the Senate lingered on his words.  'We must decide\r\nthe silver question one way or the other.  If you,' he added,\r\nlooking the Democrats in the fact, 'cannot do it, then retire from\r\nthe Senate Chamber, and we will fix it on this side, and do the\r\nbest we can with our silver friends who belong to us, who are blood\r\nof our blood, and bone of our bone.  But yours is the proper duty,\r\nand, therefore, I beg of you, not in reproach or anger, to perform\r\nit.  You have the supreme honor of being able to settle this question\r\nnow, and you ought to do it.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman ceased, but the thrall of his words remained long\r\nafter his venerable form had disappeared.  No Democrat answered\r\nhim.  Mr. Voorhees, who had sat within arm's reach of him on the\r\nRepublican side, crossed the Chamber to his own seat, and sank down\r\nas a man laden with deep care.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate continued in the Senate until the 30th of October, when\r\nthe Senate substitute was adopted by the vote of 43 yeas and 32\r\nnays.  Of the yeas 22 were Republicans, and of the nays 20 were\r\nDemocrats; so that the bill in the Senate was supported by a majority\r\nof Republicans and opposed by a majority of Democrats.  On this\r\nimportant question the President was acting with a majority of\r\nRepublicans and a minority of Democrats, and it is to his credit\r\nthat he firmly held his ground in spite of the opposition in his\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November, when the amended bill came to the House,\r\nMr. Wilson moved to concur in the amendment of the Senate.  A casual\r\ndebate followed, mostly by Bland and Bryan against the bill, and\r\nWilson and Reed for it.  The Senate amendment was agreed to and\r\nthe bill as amended passed by the decisive vote of yeas 194 and\r\nnays 94, and was approved by the President on the same day.  The\r\nlaw thus enacted is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That so much of the act approved July 14, 1890, entitled 'An act\r\ndirecting the purchase of silver bullion and issue of treasury\r\nnotes thereon, and for other purposes,' as directs the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to purchase from time to time silver bullion to\r\nthe aggregate amount of 4,500,000 ounces, or so much thereof as\r\nmay be offered in each month at the market price thereof, not\r\nexceeding one dollar for 371.25 grains of pure silver, and to issue\r\nin payment for such purchases treasury notes of the United States,\r\nbe, and the same is hereby, repealed.  And it is hereby declared\r\nto be the policy of the United States to continue the use of both\r\ngold and silver as standard money, and to coin both gold and silver\r\ninto money of equal intrinsic and exchangeable value, such equality\r\nto be secured through international agreement or by such safeguards\r\nof legislation as will insure the maintenance of the parity in\r\nvalue of the coins of the two metals, and the equal power of every\r\ndollar at all times, in the markets and in the payment of debts.\r\nAnd it is hereby further declared that the efforts of the government\r\nshould be steadily directed to the establishment of such a safe\r\nsystem of bimetallism as will maintain at all times the equal power\r\nof every dollar coined or issued by the United States, in the\r\nmarkets and in the payment of debts.\"\r\n\r\nThus the vital principles of the act of July 14, 1890, remained in\r\nforce, and the provisions for the purchase of silver bullion and\r\nfor the issue of treasury notes were repealed.  The maintenance of\r\nthe gold standard, the parity of all money whether of gold, silver\r\nor paper, and the payment of all bonds of the United States in\r\ncoin, were preserved.\r\n\r\nThe free coinage of silver is still upheld by a large body of those\r\nwho are interested in mining it, or who want to pay their debts\r\nwith a depreciated coin; but the danger of the adoption of this\r\npolicy is lessening daily.  It received a severe blow by the action\r\nof the Ohio Democratic convention in 1895 in rejecting it by a vote\r\nof more than two to one.  The bimetallic system of maintaining all\r\nforms of money at par with gold will probably soon be fully\r\nestablished.  To complete this system and to extend it to our paper\r\nmoney it would be wise to gradually withdraw treasury notes and\r\nsilver certificates and replace them with United States notes\r\nsupported and maintained by large reserves of gold.  Thus all kinds\r\nof paper money issued by the United States would be of the same\r\nform and value.  The great mass of standard silver dollars, amounting\r\non August 1, 1895, to $371,542,531, now held in the treasury\r\nrepresented by $320,355,188 of silver certificates in circulation,\r\nis the one great disturbing element in our finances.  But 51,746,706\r\nstandard silver dollars are in circulation, and experience has\r\nshown that a greater amount cannot be kept out among the people.\r\nThe certificates representing the silver dollars are in circulation\r\nand a legal tender for customs dues as well as for all debts, public\r\nand private.  They must be treated as United States notes, and\r\nmaintained at par with gold coin, or the parity of our coin and\r\ncurrency will be endangered.  They now enter into the general\r\naggregate of our legal tender money and are largely used in the\r\npayment of customs duties, and when received are paid out for the\r\ncurrent expenses of the government.  While supported by the aggregate\r\nsilver dollars in the treasury, and the pledge of the public faith\r\nto maintain them at par with gold coin and United States notes,\r\nthey are a safe and useful currency, but any measure to increase\r\nthese certificates, based upon the coining of more silver dollars\r\nfrom bullion alleged to be gain or seigniorage, would seriously\r\nimpair the ability of the government to maintain their parity with\r\ngold.  The great depreciation of silver bullion has resulted in a\r\nvast loss to the government and its disposition is the most serious\r\nproblem pending in Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire extra session of 1893 the body of the Democratic\r\nSenators and Members were placed in an awkward position.  They were\r\ndesirous of aiding the President, but their constituents behind\r\nthem were generally in favor of the free coinage of silver.  In\r\nsome of the northern states, especially in Ohio, the Democratic\r\nparty had declared, in its convention, in favor of free coinage,\r\nand now their President demanded, in the strongest language, the\r\nrepeal of the only provision of law for the purchase or coinage of\r\nsilver.  The House promptly responded to the appeal, but the\r\nDemocratic Senators hesitated and delayed action until after three\r\nmonths of weary debate.  Their party had a majority in each House,\r\nand should have disposed of the only question submitted by the\r\nPresident in thirty days.  Voorhees was the first Democratic Senator\r\nto announce his purpose to vote for the repeal, although previously\r\nan advocate of free coinage, and he, as chairman of the committee\r\non finance, reported the bill of the committee, while others lingered\r\nin doubt.  The Republican Senators, except those representing silver\r\nstates, as a rule, promptly avowed their purpose to vote for repeal,\r\nalthough they had voted for the law.\r\n\r\nAfter the call for the extra session was issued, I had expressed\r\nmy opinion of silver legislation, but I did not wish to embarrass\r\nthe President.  When interviewed I refused to answer, saying the\r\npeople had called upon the present administration to handle these\r\nquestions, and neither I nor anyone should do aught to add\r\nembarrassment, when so much already existed.  When Congress met,\r\nthe Republicans remained quiet, and did not seek to embarrass the\r\nadministration, but it was soon ascertained that a decided majority\r\nof them would vote for the repeal of the purchasing clause of the\r\nact of 1890, but against any modification of any other provision\r\nof that act.  The position of the Republican Senators from the\r\nstates west of the Mississippi River was also known.  They would\r\nvote against any change of the law, unless they could secure the\r\nfree coinage of silver.  During this period the position of the\r\nDemocratic Senators was unknown, but it was rapidly developed, with\r\nthe result already stated.\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned on the 3rd of November.  The closing days were\r\nmemorable for their excitement.  For fourteen consecutive days the\r\nSenate did not adjourn, but from time to time took recesses.  On\r\nthe 31st of October the journal had not been read for fourteen days.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I was requested by Governor McKinley to take\r\npart in the pending canvass in Ohio, which involved his re-election\r\nas governor.  In the condition of the Senate I did not feel justified\r\nin leaving, but immediately upon the passage of the repeal bill\r\nstarted for Columbus to render such service as I could.  It had\r\nbeen falsely stated that I was indifferent about McKinley's election,\r\nwhich I promptly denied.  But a few days intervened before the\r\nelection.  On the day of my arrival in Ohio, I spoke at Springfield.\r\nOn the evening of the next day, the 3rd of November, at Central\r\nTurner Hall in Cincinnati, I spoke to a very large meeting.  This\r\nspeech was fully reported.  It was mostly devoted to the tariff,\r\na struggle over which was anticipated.  After paying my usual visit\r\nto the chamber of commerce and the Lincoln club, I proceeded to\r\nToledo, where I spoke at Memorial Hall on the evening before the\r\nelection, and then returned home to Mansfield, where I voted.  The\r\nresult was even more decisive than expected.  The 81,000 plurality\r\nfor McKinley was the best evidence of his popularity, and was\r\nregarded as an indorsement of the McKinley tariff law.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of November I returned to Washington.  Many interviews\r\nwith me were reported, in which I expressed my satisfaction with\r\nthe overwhelming victory gained by the Republicans all over the\r\nUnited States, and especially with their success in New York.  In\r\nresponse to a request by a leading journal, before the meeting of\r\nCongress, I carefully prepared a statement of the causes that led\r\nto these results.  I undertook to review the political changes in\r\nthe past four years, but will insert only two paragraphs of this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\"It is manifest that the causes of the defeat of the Democratic\r\nparty in the recent election were general and not local.  They\r\nextended to Colorado, Dakota, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York,\r\nand Massachusetts.  If the opposition to the Democratic party in\r\nVirginia had been organized and conducted by the Republican party,\r\nthe results in that state would have been very different.  The\r\nideas of the Populists are too visionary and impracticable to be\r\nmade the basis of a political organization.  A canvass conducted\r\nin Virginia upon the issues that prevailed in Ohio would, in my\r\njudgment, have greatly changed the results in that state.  Aside\r\nfrom the memories of the war, the economic principles of the\r\nRepublican party have great strength in the southern states, and\r\nwhenever the images of the war fade away the people of those states\r\nwill be influenced by the same ideas that prevail in the northern\r\nstates.  The leading cause of the enormous Republican majorities\r\nin northern states I have mentioned was the united protest of the\r\nunemployed against radical changes of our tariff laws.  Whatever\r\ntheories may be proposed, it may be regarded as an axiom that the\r\nprotective principle is a well established principle in the United\r\nStates.  It has been recommended by all the Presidents from Washington\r\nto Harrison, and by none more emphatically than Jefferson, Madison,\r\nMonroe, and Jackson.  This is and has been the natural and instinctive\r\npolicy of a new nation with enormous undeveloped resources.  While\r\nthe terms of our tariff laws provided for revenue, their foundation\r\nand background were to encourage domestic manufactures and diversify\r\nproductions.  The extent of protection was limited to the want of\r\nrevenue, but the duties were uniformly so adjusted as, while\r\nproducing revenue, to encourage manufactures.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"But, after all, we must place as the chief cause of Democratic\r\ndefeat the profound and settled distrust that the Democratic party\r\nwill now, having the President and a majority in both Houses,\r\ndisturb the enormous industries of our country developed by, and\r\ndependent upon, our tariff laws, and will seek to substitute the\r\npolicy of Great Britain, of free trade, as against the example of\r\nthe leading nations of Europe as well as our own, of a wise and\r\ncareful protection, and encouragement by tariff laws of all forms\r\nof domestic industry that can be conducted with a reasonable hope\r\nof profit in this country.  The future of parties will depend more\r\nlargely upon the manner in which this condition of things is met\r\nby the present Congress than upon all other causes combined.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\nPASSAGE OF THE WILSON TARIFF BILL.\r\nSecond Session of the 53rd Congress--Recommendations of the President\r\nConcerning a Revision of the Tariff Laws--Bill Reported to the\r\nHouse by the Committee of Ways and Means--Supported by Chairman\r\nWilson and Passed--Received in the Senate--Report of the Senate\r\nCommittee on Finance--Passes the Senate with Radical Amendments--\r\nThese are Finally Agreed to by the House--The President Refuses to\r\nApprove the Bill--Becomes a Law After Ten Days--Defects in the Bill\r\n--Not Satisfactory to Either House, the President or the People--\r\nMistakes of the Secretary of the Treasury--No Power to Sell Bonds\r\nor to Borrow Money to Meet Current Deficiencies--Insufficient\r\nRevenue to Support the Government--A Remedy That Was Not Adopted--\r\nGross Injustice of Putting Wool on the Free List--McKinley Law\r\nCompared with the Wilson Bill--Sufficient Revenue Furnished by the\r\nFormer--I Am Criticized for Supporting the President and Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe second session of the 53rd Congress commenced on the 4th of\r\nDecember, 1893.  The President in his message was especially urgent\r\nin his recommendation of a revision of the tariff laws.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us.  Nothing\r\nso important claims our attention, and nothing so clearly presents\r\nitself as both an opportunity and a duty--an opportunity to deserve\r\nthe gratitude of our fellow-citizens, and a duty imposed upon us\r\nby our oft-repeated professions, and by the emphatic mandate of\r\nthe people.  After a full discussion our countrymen have spoken in\r\nfavor of this reform, and they have confided the work of its\r\naccomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it.\r\n\r\n\"If there is anything in the theory of a representation in public\r\nplaces of the people and their desires, if public officers are\r\nreally the servants of the people, and if political promises and\r\nprofessions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief\r\nso long awaited will be sheer recreancy.  Nothing should intervene\r\nto distract our attention or disturb our effort, until this reform\r\nis accomplished by wise and careful legislation.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Not less closely related to our people's prosperity and well-being\r\nis the removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw\r\nmaterials necessary to our manufactures.  The world should be open\r\nto our national ingenuity and enterprise.  This cannot be while\r\nfederal legislation, through the imposition of high tariffs, forbids\r\nto American manufactures as cheap materials as those used by their\r\ncompetitors.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of this message, it was manifest that the tariff would be\r\nthe chief subject of legislation during the session.  It was\r\nunderstood that a bill had been prepared by the committee of ways\r\nand means, which had been submitted to the President and Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and approved by them.  It was reported to the House\r\nof Representatives, December 19, 1893.  On the 8th of January,\r\n1894, Mr. Wilson, chairman of the committee, made an elaborate\r\nspeech in its support.  The debate continued until the 1st of\r\nFebruary, when, with some amendments, it passed the House.  In the\r\nSenate, on the next day, it was referred to the committee on finance.\r\nOn the 20th of March it was reported to the Senate, with amendments,\r\nby Mr. Voorhees.  Mr. Morrill said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to say that so far as the Republican members of the\r\ncommittee on finance are concerned they did not object to the\r\nreporting of the bill, while they are opposed not only to the\r\nproposed income tax, but to the many changes of specifics to _ad\r\nvalorems_, and to the great bulk of the provisions of the bill.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of April Voorhees made a carefully prepared speech in\r\nsupport of the bill.  The debate continued, occupying much the\r\nlarger part of the time until the 3rd day of July, when the bill\r\npassed with radical amendments, which changed it in principle and\r\ndetails.  Two conferences of the two Houses were held on amendments\r\ndisagreed to, but failed to agree, and it appeared, after the long\r\nstruggle, that he bill would be defeated, when, on the 13th of\r\nAugust, upon motion of Mr. Catchings, the House agreed to the Senate\r\namendments in gross and thus the bill passed Congress.  The President\r\nrefused to approve it and it became a law after ten days without\r\nhis approval.\r\n\r\nThis skeleton history of what is now known as the Wilson tariff\r\npartly discloses its imperfections.  Framed in the House as a tariff\r\nfor revenue only, and radically changed in the Senate to a tariff\r\nwith protection to special industries, it was not satisfactory to\r\neither House, to the President or to the people.  So far as it\r\ncopied the schedules and the legislative provisions of the McKinley\r\nlaw, it met with approval.  Its new features were incongruous, were\r\ndecidedly sectional, and many of its provisions were inconsistent\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\nThe vital defect of this bill is that it does not provide sufficient\r\nrevenue to carry on the government.  This is the primary and almost\r\nthe only cause of the financial difficulties of the present\r\nadministration.  The election of Mr. Cleveland in 1892, upon the\r\nplatform framed by him, naturally created distrust as to the ability\r\nof the government to maintain the parity of the different forms of\r\nmoney in circulation.  Added to this, the broad declaration of the\r\npurpose to reduce taxation led to the reduction of importations\r\nand the diminution of the revenue from the McKinley tariff.  Importers\r\nand dealers naturally reduced their imports in view of the expectation\r\nthat duties would be reduced.  By the 1st of July, 1893, when the\r\nWilson bill was in embryo, the revenues had been so diminished as\r\nto yield a surplus of only $2,341,074 during the previous year.\r\nIt was apparent, when Congress met in August, that the administration,\r\nhaving a majority in each House of Congress, was determined to\r\nreduce duties, and yet it made no effort to reduce expenditures.\r\nSoon after there was a large deficiency in the revenue, and the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury was compelled either to refuse to pay\r\nappropriations made by law in excess of receipts or to borrow money\r\nto meet the deficiencies.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the better way for him would have been not to pay\r\nappropriations not needed to meet specific contracts, for an\r\nappropriation of money by Congress is not mandatory, but is\r\npermissive, an authority but not a command to pay, nor does an\r\nappropriation in itself authorize the borrowing of money.  When\r\nthis authority is required Congress must grant it, and, upon its\r\nfailure to do so, all the Secretary of the Treasury should do is\r\nto pay such appropriations as the revenues collected by the government\r\nwill justify.  It is for Congress to provide such sums, by taxation\r\nor loans, as are necessary to meet all appropriations made in excess\r\nof revenue.  If it refuses or neglects to do this, the responsibility\r\nis on it, not on the secretary.  All he can do is choose what\r\nappropriations he will pay.  This is a dangerous and delicate power,\r\nbut it has frequently been employed and has never been abused.\r\nHis failure to exercise this discretion was a grave mistake.\r\n\r\nAs revenues diminished deficiencies increased.  A doubt arose\r\nwhether, under the then existing conditions, the government would\r\nbe able to pay gold coin for United States notes and treasury notes.\r\nThese were supported by a reserve of $100,000,000 in gold coin and\r\nbullion, but this reserve fund was not segregated from the general\r\nbalance in the treasury, as it ought to have been, but was liable\r\nto be drawn upon for all appropriations made by Congress.  There\r\nwas not then, and there is not now, any specific authority invested\r\nin the Secretary of the Treasury to sell bonds or to borrow money\r\nto meet current deficiencies, and he felt called upon to pay these\r\nout of the general fund, embracing that created for the redemption\r\nof United States notes under the act of 1875.  The result was to\r\ncreate an alarm that the government could not or would not pay such\r\nnotes and thus maintain the gold standard.  The timid, and those\r\nwhose patriotism is in their purse, were making inroads on the gold\r\nreserve, which fell below $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nBy the resumption act of 1875 the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nauthorized, to enable him to pay United States notes on demand, to\r\nsell either of three classes of bonds bearing respectively five,\r\nfour and a half and four per cent. interest, but the question arose,\r\nin 1894, whether he could sell these bonds to meet current\r\nexpenditures.  All of them were worth a premium in the market.\r\nBonds bearing three per cent. running a short period could then\r\nhave been sold at par.  In common with many others I foresaw, in\r\nFebruary, 1893, that the tariff policy of the then incoming\r\nadministration would reduce our revenue below our expenditures,\r\nand sought to have Congress authorize the sale of bonds bearing\r\nthree per cent. interest instead of those at a higher rate already\r\nauthorized.  I saw plainly that the incoming administration would\r\nenter on precisely the same course as that adopted by Buchanan, of\r\nproviding insufficient revenue for the support of the government,\r\nresulting in the gradual increase of the public debt and the\r\ndisturbance of our financial system.  During each year of Buchanan's\r\nadministration the public debt increased, as it has been steadily\r\nincreasing during Cleveland's administration, and great embarrassment\r\ngrows out of this fact.  My friendly suggestion was defeated and\r\nthe result has been the sale of four per cent. bonds at a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe President recommended the removal of restrictions upon the\r\nimportation of the raw materials necessary to our manufactures.\r\nThe tariff bill, as it passed, imposed duties on nearly all raw\r\nmaterials except wool.  This important product of the farmer was\r\nmade duty free.  I made every effort to prevent this injustice.\r\nFree wool was the culminating atrocity of the tariff law.  By it\r\na revenue of over eight millions a year was surrendered for the\r\nbenefit of woolen manufacturers.  I appealed to the Senate to give\r\nsome protection to this great industry of our country.  It was\r\ngenerally classed as the fifth of the industries of the United\r\nStates, including the manufacture of woolens, and I have no doubt\r\nit fully came up to that grade.  Over a million farmers were engaged\r\nin the growth of wool.  It involved an annual product estimated at\r\n$125,000,000 under the former prices, but probably under the prices\r\nafter the passage of the Wilson bill it was reduced to about eighty\r\nor ninety million dollars.  It was, therefore, a great industry.\r\nAnd yet it was left solitary and alone without the slightest\r\nprotection given to it directly or indirectly.  The manufacture of\r\nwoolen goods was amply protected.  Amendments were proposed and\r\nadopted without dissent, adding largely to the protection at first\r\nproposed on manufactures of wool.\r\n\r\nThe value of the wool in woolen goods as a rule is equal to the\r\ncost of manufacturing the cloth.  The duty on cloth under this law\r\naverages 40 per cent., so that the domestic manufacturer of cloth\r\ngets the benefit not only of a duty of 40 per cent. on the cost of\r\nmanufacture, but he gets a duty of 40 per cent. on the cost of the\r\nwool in the cloth, thus getting a protection of 80 per cent. on\r\nthe cost of manufacture, while the farmer gets no protection against\r\nforeign competition for his labor and care.  This gross injustice\r\nis done under the name of free raw materials.  When I appealed to\r\nthe Senate for a duty on wool I was answered by one Senator that\r\nfree wool was all that was left in the bill of the Democratic\r\ndoctrines of free raw materials, and, if only for this reason, must\r\nbe retained.  I made two speeches in support of a duty, but was\r\nmet by a united party vote, every Democrat against it and every\r\nRepublican for it.  In the next tariff bill I hope this decision\r\nwill be reversed.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May, 1894, I made a long speech in favor of the\r\nMcKinley law and against the Wilson bill.  While the McKinley law\r\nlargely reduced the taxes and duties under pre-existing laws, yet\r\nit furnished ample revenue to support the government.  The object\r\nof the act was declared to be to reduce the revenue.  It was\r\nimpartial to all sections and to all industries.  The south was\r\nwell cared for in it, and every reasonable degree of protection\r\nwas given to that section.  In growing industries in the north,\r\nwhich it is desirable to encourage, an increase of duty was given.\r\nIn nearly all the older industries the rates were reduced, and the\r\nresult was a reduction of revenue to the extent of $30,000,000.\r\nThere was no discrimination made in the McKinley act between\r\nagriculture and mechanical industries.  The Wilson bill sacrificed\r\nthe interests of every farmer in the United States, except probably\r\nthe growers of rice and of fruit in the south.  The McKinley act,\r\nI believe, was the most carefully framed, especially in its operative\r\nclauses and its classification of duties, of any tariff bill ever\r\npassed by the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the McKinley act was the cause of the deficiency\r\nof revenue that commenced about three years after its passage.\r\nThat is a mistake.  Until Mr. Cleveland was sworn into office,\r\nMarch 4, 1893, there was no want of revenue to carry on the operations\r\nof the government.  Until July, 1893, there was a surplus of revenue,\r\nand not a deficiency.  The receipts during the fiscal years ending\r\nJune 30, 1891, 1892, 1893, under the McKinley act, furnished ample\r\nmeans for the support of the government, and it was not until after\r\nCleveland had been elected, and when there was a great fear and\r\ndread all over the country that our industries would be disturbed\r\nby tariff legislation, that the revenues fell off.  The surplus in\r\n1891 was $37,000,000; in 1892, in the midst of the election, it\r\nwas $9,914,000, and in 1893, up to June 30, the surplus revenue\r\nwas $2,341,000.  Yet in a single year afterwards, after this attempt\r\nto tinker with the tariff had commenced, after the announcement as\r\nto the tariff had been made by Mr. Cleveland, after the general\r\nfear that sprang up in the country in regard to tariff legislation,\r\nthe revenues under the McKinley act fell off over $66,000,000, and\r\nthe deficiency of that year was $66,542,000.\r\n\r\nI believe that if Harrison had been elected President of the United\r\nStates the McKinley act would have furnished ample revenue for the\r\nsupport of the government, because then there would have been no\r\nfear of disturbance of the protected industries of our country.\r\nCleveland's election created the disturbances that followed it.\r\nThe fear of radical changes in the tariff law was the basis of\r\nthem.  That law caused the falling of prices, the stagnation of\r\nsome industries, and the suspension of others.  No doubt the fall\r\nin the value of silver and the increased demand for gold largely\r\nprecipitated and added to the other evils that I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf when Congress met in December, 1893, there had been a disposition\r\non the part of both sides to take up the tariff question and discuss\r\nit and consider it as a pure question of finance, there would have\r\nbeen no difficulty with the Republicans.  We were all ready to\r\nrevise the rates contained in the McKinley tariff act.  The body\r\nof that act had been embodied in the Wilson bill as part of the\r\nproposed law.  Nearly all of the working machinery of the collection\r\nof customs, framed carefully under the experienced eye of Senator\r\nAllison, is still retained.  All the schedules, the formal parts\r\nof the act, which are so material, and the designation into classes\r\n--all those matters which are so complicated and difficult to an\r\nordinary lawyer or an ordinary statesman, have been retained.\r\n\r\nIf the bill had been taken up in the spirit in which it should have\r\nbeen, and if an impartial committee of both parties in the Senate\r\nand the House had gone over it, item by item, it would have passed\r\nin thirty days without trouble.  That was not the purpose; it was\r\nnot the object, and it was not the actual result.\r\n\r\nDuring the long session of 1893-94 I was the subject of much\r\ncontroversy, debate, censure and praise.  While distinctly a\r\nRepublican, and strongly attached to that party, I supported, with\r\nthe exception of the tariff law, the financial policy of the\r\nPresident and Secretary Carlisle.  Mr. Cleveland was a positive\r\nforce in sustaining all measures in support of the public credit.\r\nMr. Carlisle, who as a Member and Senator had not been always\r\nequally positive on these measures, yet was regarded as a conservative\r\nadvocate of a sound financial policy, readily and heartily supported\r\nthe President in his recommendations.  As these were in harmony\r\nwith my convictions I found myself indorsing them as against a\r\nmajority of the Democratic Senators.  My Republican colleagues,\r\nwith scarcely an exception, favored the same policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\nSENIORITY OF SERVICE IN THE SENATE.\r\nNotified That My Years of Service Exceed Those of Thomas Benton--\r\nCelebration of the Sons of the American Revolution at the Washington\r\nMonument--My Address to Those Present--Departure for the West with\r\nGeneral Miles--Our Arrival at Woodlake, Nebraska--Neither \"Wood\"\r\nnor \"Lake\"--Enjoying the Pleasures of Camp Life--Bound for Big\r\nSpring, South Dakota--Return via Sioux City, St. Paul and Minneapolis\r\n--Marvelous Growth of the \"Twin Cities\"--Publication of the \"Sherman\r\nLetters\" by General Sherman's Daughter Rachel--First Political\r\nSpeech of the Campaign at Akron--Republican Victory in the State\r\nof Ohio--Return to Washington for the Winter of 1894-95--Marriage\r\nof Our Adopted Daughter Mary with James Iver McCallum--A Short\r\nSession of Congress Devoted Mainly to Appropriations--Conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of June, 1894, I was notified by William E. Spencer,\r\nthe experienced journal clerk of the Senate, that I that day had\r\nreached a term of service in the Senate equal in length to that of\r\nThomas Benton, whose service had previously held first rank in\r\nduration, covering the period from December 6, 1821, to March 3,\r\n1851, making 29 years, 2 months and 27 days.  I had entered the\r\nSenate March 23, 1861, and served continuously until March 8, 1877,\r\nmaking 15 years, 11 months and 15 days, when I entered the cabinet\r\nof President Hayes.  My second term of service in the Senate began\r\nMarch 4, 1881, and has continued until the present time.  My service\r\nsince June 16, 1894, is in excess of that of Benton.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1894, the Sons of the American Revolution\r\ncelebrated the day by a ceremony held literally in the shadow of\r\nthe Washington monument.  There, at the base of the great shaft,\r\nthe members and friends of this organization and several chapters\r\nof the Daughters of the Revolution gathered at 10 o'clock to listen\r\nto patriotic addresses.  The societies had been escorted from the\r\nArlington hotel by the Marine Band, and gathered in seats around\r\na grand stand while a battery of artillery welcomed them with a\r\nsalute.  The band played national hymns, and the audience sang\r\n\"America.\"  General Breckinridge introduced me and I was heartily\r\ngreeted.  After narrating the principal events of the American\r\nRevolution, and especially incidents connected with the Declaration\r\nof American Independence, I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is a marvel of the world that these humble colonies, composed\r\nof plain men, for there were no nobles or rich men in those times,\r\nfurnished genius which brought to mankind greater wisdom in the\r\nframing of a government than ever elsewhere existed.  It was of\r\nthese men that Lord Chatham said that they had prepared papers\r\nstronger than ever emanated from any court of Europe.  Our country\r\nwas built up on intelligence, obedience to law, desire for freedom\r\nand the equal enjoyment of rights.  Those who are gathered here to-\r\nday are classified as sons and daughters of the Revolution, and\r\ntherefore they are under deeper obligations to be true and patriotic\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nI then spoke of the character of our people and our institutions,\r\nand the Civil War, happily ended, and the increasing strength and\r\npower of the republic.  I narrated how the Washington monument came\r\nto be completed.  I said it was true it cost a million of dollars,\r\nbut what was that to 65,000,000 people!  The occasion was enjoyable,\r\nthe speeches were suitable for the 4th of July, patriotism and love\r\nof country being the watchwords.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of August, 1894, the second session of the 53rd Congress\r\nclosed.  It was a laborious session.  Its principal act was a\r\nmeasure that did not satisfy anyone.  It laid the foundations for\r\ninsufficient revenue, an increase of the public debt and the general\r\ndefeat of the party in power.\r\n\r\nI was much fatigued, and had already arranged to accompany General\r\nNelson A. Miles and his party on a military inspection in Nebraska\r\nand South Dakota.  I arrived in Chicago on the 2nd of September,\r\nwhere General Miles was stationed.  There I was met by the reporters\r\nand told them all I knew about the intended trip.  I got as much\r\ninformation from them as they did from me.  What they wanted was\r\nprophecy of the future, and I wanted to get into the wilderness.\r\nHere our little party was made up, consisting of General Miles,\r\nhis wife, daughter and son, a lad about thirteen years old, Dr.\r\nDaly and brother, two staff officers, and myself.  We had a car\r\nand lived in it, and the cook supplied us bountifully with good\r\nhealthy food, largely of game.  I cannot imagine a more delightful\r\nchange to a man weary with talk in the hot chambers of the capitol\r\nat Washington in August than the free, fresh air of the broad plains\r\nof Nebraska, with congenial company in a palace car, and with no\r\none to bother him.  Our first stopping place was called Woodlake,\r\na small village on the railroad in the northwestern part of Nebraska.\r\nWe arrived there in the afternoon; our car was detached from the\r\ntrain and became our home for a week.  Around us in every direction\r\nwas a broad rolling plain as dry as a powder horn, with scarcely\r\nany signs of habitation, but the air was pure and exhilarating and\r\nimparted a sense of health and energy.  My first inquiry to one of\r\nthe denizens was \"Where is your wood and your lake which gave a\r\nname to your town?\"  He said that when the railroad was located\r\nthere was a grove near by, and water in the low ground where we\r\nstood, but the trees had been cut and utilized in constructing the\r\nrailroad, and the lake was dried up by a long drouth.  Woodlake\r\nhad neither wood nor lake in sight!  We took long walks without\r\nfatigue, and our hunters, of whom General Miles was chief, supplied\r\nus with prairie chickens, the only game of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days thus spent we left our car and followed after a\r\ncompany of United States Infantry, from Fort Niobrara, then engaged\r\nin their usual drill, to a lake about twenty-five miles away, where\r\nwe lived in tents and had a taste of real camp life.  With the\r\nconsent of the owner of the land we pitched our tents near his\r\nhouse on the banks of the lake about three miles long and perhaps\r\nhalf a mile wide.  This sight of water was pleasing, but we were\r\nwarned not to drink it.  We had a bountiful supply of pure healthy\r\nwater, however, from an artesian well driven over a hundred feet\r\ninto the earth and pumped by almost continuous winds into a great\r\nbasin, which furnished water in abundance for man and beast.  The\r\nonly house in sight besides the one near our camp was occupied by\r\nthe brother of our host, three miles away at the other end of the\r\nlake.  The two brothers were the lords of all they surveyed.  They\r\nowned large herds of cattle that ranged over the plains around,\r\ndrank of the waters of the lake and fed upon the sparse herbage.\r\nA few hundred of them were kept in a corral near the homesteads\r\nfor sale, but the larger portion roamed under the care of herdsmen\r\nwherever the herbage seemed the best.\r\n\r\nHere our hunters, with a fine pack of dogs, pursued prairie chickens,\r\nand not only supplied our table but contributed to the soldiers in\r\ntheir shelter tents near by.  Mrs. Miles and I, escorted by her\r\nyoung son, Sherman Miles, on horseback, had the benefit of a horse\r\nand buggy with which we could drive in any direction.  There was\r\nno fence or bog or obstruction in the way.  We generally kept in\r\nsight of our hunters, but if we lost the trail we could go to the\r\nhills and soon locate our camp.  This free and easy life soon cured\r\nmy languor and weariness and I was able to walk or ride long\r\ndistances as well as any of the party.\r\n\r\nReturning to Woodlake we attached our car to the train for Big\r\nSpring in South Dakota.  Here we spent two or three days, mainly\r\nin riding through the picturesque country around.  We intended to\r\nextend our journey to Deadwood but the duties of General Miles\r\nrequired him to visit St. Paul and the military post at Fort\r\nSnelling.  We returned by way of Sioux City, and thence to St.\r\nPaul.  This city and its sister Minneapolis, were familiar ground.\r\nI had seen them when they were small towns, and had by frequent\r\nvisits kept pace with their growth, but the change noticed on my\r\nlast visit was a surprise to me.  The two cities, but a few miles\r\napart when rival rural villages, were approaching each other and\r\nno doubt are destined to blend into one great city of the north.\r\nHere I met many friends, chief of whom I am glad to place Senator\r\nCushman K. Davis, of Minnesota.  After a brief stay our little\r\nparty returned to Chicago and dispersed, I going back to Mansfield\r\nto engage in the political campaign.\r\n\r\nAt this period \"The Sherman Letters\" was published, and at once\r\nattracted attention and general commendation.  I though the experiment\r\nwas a risky one, but it was the desire of General Sherman's children\r\nto publish them, and especially of his daughter, Rachel Thorndike,\r\nwho undertook to compile them.  I have been in the habit of preserving\r\nletters written to me on personal matters, or by members of my\r\nfamily, and, as General Sherman was a copious writer, I placed his\r\nletters in separate books.  He did the same with mine, but many of\r\nthese had been lost by fire in California.  Rachel arranged in\r\nchronological order such letters as she thought worth preserving,\r\nand they were published in a handsome volume.  I have a multitude\r\nof letters from almost every man with whom I have been associated\r\nin political life, but will not publish them while the writers live\r\nwithout their consent, nor even after their death if the letters\r\nwould tend to wound the feelings of surviving friends or relatives.\r\nLetters are the best evidence of current thought or events, but\r\nthey ought to be guarded by the person to whom they are written as\r\nconfidential communications, not to be disclosed to the injury of\r\nthe writer.  General Sherman's inmost thoughts could be disclosed\r\nwithout fear of injury to him, and his letters, though rapidly\r\nwritten, did not indicate a dishonorable thought or action.  I have\r\nseen nothing in the comments of the press on these letters but what\r\nis kindly to the \"two brothers.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October I made my usual annual visit to Cincinnati.\r\nI called at the chamber of commerce, and had the same hearty welcome\r\nits members have always given me.  I made the usual short speech,\r\nand it was all about \"King Corn.\"  General surprise was expressed\r\nat my healthy appearance.  The remark was frequently made that I\r\nwas looking better and healthier than for years.  The impression\r\nof my failing health was gathered from the newspaper descriptions\r\nof \"the old man\" in the debates in the Senate.  The effect of the\r\npure, open air of Nebraska was apparent.  While on this visit I\r\nwas greatly pleased with a drive to Fort Thomas, and the high lands\r\non the Kentucky side of the river.\r\n\r\nMy first political speech of the campaign was made on the 12th of\r\nOctober at Akron.  It was confined almost exclusively to the tariff\r\nand silver questions.  The meeting was very large, composed chiefly\r\nof men employed in the numerous factories and workshops of that\r\nactive and flourishing city.  On the 18th I spoke at Sandusky upon\r\nthe same general topics as at Akron.  Here I visited the Soldiers'\r\nHome near that city.  It is an interesting place, where I think\r\nthe old soldiers are better cared for than in the larger national\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nI continued in the canvass, speaking at several places, until the\r\nelection on the first Tuesday of November.  The result was the re-\r\nelection of Samuel M. Taylor, the Republican candidate for Secretary\r\nof State, by the abnormal plurality of 137,086, and nineteen\r\nRepublicans were elected to Congress out of the twenty-one.  Though\r\nthis was a state election, it turned mainly upon national issues,\r\nand especially evidenced strong opposition to the Wilson tariff\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nI was often asked by reporters, after my return to Washington, as\r\nto the meaning of the election in Ohio.  I uniformly expressed the\r\nopinion that it meant the adoption of a nonpartisan tariff that\r\nwould, with a few internal taxes, yield revenue enough to pay\r\ncurrent expenses and the interest of the public debt and a portion\r\nof the principal.  I still hope that will be the result.  The\r\nframework of the McKinley law, with such changes as experience may\r\nshow to be essential, would remove the tariff from among the\r\npolitical questions of the day and give reasonable encouragement\r\nto American industries.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November my family and I returned to Washington for\r\nthe winter.  The chief interest and occupation of my wife and\r\nmyself, for the time being, was the preparation for the approaching\r\nmarriage of our adopted daughter, Mary Stewart Sherman, to James\r\nIver McCallum, of Washington.  This was fixed for noon, the 12th\r\nof December.  Full details of all the preparations made, of the\r\ndresses worn, of the members of the family in attendance, and of\r\nthe distinguished guests present, were given in the city papers.\r\nIt is sufficient for me to say that Mary has been carefully educated\r\nand trained by us, and never for a moment has given us anxiety as\r\nto her prudence, deportment and affection.  We gave her in marriage\r\nto a young gentleman, a native of Washington, and a clerk in the\r\nsupreme court, and entertain for her all the affection and solicitude\r\nthat a father or mother can bestow.\r\n\r\nCongress convened on the 3rd of December, 1894.  The languor that\r\nfollowed the excitement of the two previous sessions, and the defeat\r\nsuffered by the administration in the recent elections, no doubt\r\ncaused an indifference to political questions during the short\r\nremaining session.  But little was done except to consider and pass\r\nthe appropriations for the support of the government.  I was often\r\nannoyed by unfounded assertions that I had influence with the\r\nadministration, and especially with Carlisle, that I was in frequent\r\nconference with the President and secretary.  These stories were\r\nentirely unfounded.  Neither of these gentlemen ever consulted me\r\nas to the business of their offices, nor did I ever seek to influence\r\nthem or even to converse with them on political questions.  It was\r\na delicate matter for either of them or myself to deny such statements\r\nwhen our personal relations were so friendly.\r\n\r\nAnd now these memoirs must end.  I know there are many events not\r\nnoted that should have been referred to, and many persons whose\r\nnames should not have been omitted.  I would be glad to mention\r\nwith honor and credit hundreds of men who participated with me in\r\nthe political events of public life, but this seemed impracticable\r\nwithin reasonable limits.  I might have omitted many events and\r\nspeeches as of not sufficient consequence to be preserved, but if\r\nI had I would not have written the recollections of my public life.\r\nThe life of a civilian is in what he says or writes, that of a\r\nsoldier in what he does.  What I have written is no doubt clouded\r\nwith partisanship, but I would not be honest if I did not express\r\nmy attachment to my party.  This, however, never impaired my\r\npatriotism or swerved me from the path of duty.\r\n\r\nTo the people of Ohio I owe all the offices and honors that have\r\nbeen conferred upon me.  No constituency could have been more\r\nforbearing and kind.  During forty years of public life, though\r\nmany able men have aspired to the office I hold, the people of\r\nOhio, through their general assembly, have preferred me to represent\r\nthem.  Though my grateful thanks are due to them and have been\r\noften expressed, yet I have felt, as they do, that my duty was to\r\nthe whole country.  Proud of Ohio, of its history and people,\r\nwilling at all times to sound its praise in the sisterhood of\r\nstates, yet, according to my convictions, the United States is\r\nentitled to my allegiance, and all parts of it should receive equal\r\ncare and consideration.  \"Our country, our whole country, and\r\nnothing but our country\" has been the watchword and creed of my\r\npublic life.  It was the opposite doctrine of \"states' rights,\"\r\nallegiance to a state, that led to the Civil War.  It was settled\r\nby this war that we have a country limited in its powers by the\r\nconstitution of the United States fairly construed.  Since that\r\ntime our progress and development have been more rapid than any\r\nother country's.\r\n\r\nThe events of the future are beyond the vision of mankind, but I\r\nhope our people will be content with internal growth, and avoid\r\nthe complications of foreign acquisitions.  Our family of states\r\nis already large enough to create embarrassment in the Senate, and\r\na republic should not hold dependent provinces or possessions.\r\nEvery new acquisition will create embarrassments.  Canada and Mexico\r\nas independent republics will be more valuable to the United States\r\nthan if carved into additional states.  The Union already embraces\r\ndiscordant elements enough without adding others.  If my life is\r\nprolonged I will do all I can to add to the strength and prosperity\r\nof the United States, but nothing to extend its limits or to add\r\nnew dangers by acquisition of foreign territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n[omitted]",
