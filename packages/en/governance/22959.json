Miami, Florida\r\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number:\r\n78-83885\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe following chapters are devoted mainly to facts and incidents\r\nconnected with the development of anti-slavery politics from the\r\nyear 1840 to the close of the work of Reconstruction which followed\r\nthe late civil war.  Other topics, however, are occasionally noticed,\r\nwhile I have deemed it proper to state my own attitude and course\r\nof action respecting various public questions, and to refer more\r\nparticularly to the political strifes of my own State.  In doing\r\nthis, I have spoken freely of conspicuous personalities in connection\r\nwith their public action, or their peculiar relations to myself;\r\nbut my aim has been to deal fairly and state only the truth, while\r\nstriving to weave into my story some reminiscences of the men and\r\nevents of by-gone times, which may interest the reader.  In the\r\nendeavor to elucidate the orderly progress of anti-slavery opinions\r\nand their translation into organized action, I have summarized and\r\nre-stated many of the familiar facts of current American politics\r\nduring the period embraced; but I hope I have also made a slight\r\ncontribution to the sources of history bearing upon a world-famous\r\nmovement, touching which we should \"gather up the fragments that\r\nnothing be lost.\"\r\n\r\n  G.

Harrison--\r\nPersonal defamation--Mass-meetings and songs--Crushing defeat of\r\nthe Democrats--First appearance of the slavery issue in politics--\r\nPro-slavery attitude of Harrison and Van Buren--Events favoring\r\nthe growth of anti-slavery opinion--Clay and Mendenhall--Texas\r\nannexation and John Tyler.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of early associations, I began my political\r\nlife as a Whig, casting my first presidential ballot for General\r\nHarrison, in 1840.  I knew next to nothing of our party politics;\r\nbut in the matter of attending mass-meetings, singing Whig songs\r\nand drinking hard cider, I played a considerable part in the\r\nmemorable campaign of that year.  So far as ideas entered into my\r\nsupport of the Whig candidate, I simply regarded him as a poor man,\r\nwhose home was a log cabin, and who would in some way help the\r\npeople through their scuffle with poverty and the \"hard times\";\r\nwhile I was fully persuaded that Van Buren was not only a graceless\r\naristocrat and a dandy, but a cunning conspirator, seeking the\r\noverthrow of his country's liberties by uniting the sword and the\r\npurse in his own clutches, as he was often painted on the party\r\nbanners.  In these impressions I was by no means singular.  They\r\nfilled the air, and seemed to be wafted on every breeze.  Horace\r\nGreeley's famous campaign organ, \"The Log Cabin,\" only gave them\r\nvoice and fitting pictorial effect, and he frankly admitted in\r\nlater years that his Whig appeals, with his music and wood engravings\r\nof General Harrison's battle scenes, were more \"vivid\" than \"sedately\r\nargumentative.\"  No one will now seriously pretend that this was\r\na campaign of ideas, or a struggle for political reform in any\r\nsense.  It was a grand national frolic, in which the imprisoned\r\nmirth and fun of the people found such jubilant and uproarious\r\nexpression that anything like calmness of judgment or real seriousness\r\nof purpose was out of the question in the Whig camp.\r\n\r\nAs regards party issues, General Harrison, singularly enough, was\r\nnot a Whig, but an old fashioned States-Rights Democrat of the\r\nJeffersonian school.  His letters to Harmar Denny and Sherrod\r\nWilliams committed him to none of the dogmas which defined a Whig.\r\nNo authentic utterance of his could be produced in which he had\r\never expressed his agreement with the Whig party on the questions\r\nof a protective tariff, internal improvements, or a national bank.\r\nThere was very high Whig authority for saying that the bank question\r\nwas not an issue of the canvass, while Van Buren's great measure\r\nfor separating the currency from the banks became a law pending\r\nthe Presidential struggle.  In fact, it was because no proof of\r\nGeneral Harrison's party orthodoxy could be found, that he was\r\nnominated; and the Whig managers of the Harrisburg Convention felt\r\nobliged to sacrifice Henry Clay, which they did through the basest\r\ndouble-dealing and treachery, for the reason that his right angled\r\ncharacter as a party leader would make him unavailable as a candidate.\r\nAs to John Tyler, he was not a Whig in any sense.  It is true that\r\nhe had opposed the removal of the deposits, and voted against\r\nBenton's expunging resolutions, but on all the regular and recognized\r\nparty issues he was fully committed as a Democrat, and was, moreover,\r\na nullifier.  The sole proof of his Whiggery was the apocryphal\r\nstatement that he wept when Clay failed to receive the nomination,\r\nwhile his political position was perfectly understood by the men\r\nwho nominated him.  There was one policy only on which they were\r\nperfectly agreed, and that was the policy of avowing no principles\r\nwhatever; and they tendered but one issue, and that was a change\r\nof the national administration.  On this issue they were perfectly\r\nunited and thoroughly in earnest, and it was idle to deny that on\r\ntheir own showing the spoils alone divided them from the Democrats\r\nand inspired their zeal.\r\n\r\nThe demand of the Whigs for a change was well-founded.  Samuel\r\nSwartwout, the New York Collector of Customs, had disgraced the\r\nGovernment by his defalcations; and, although he was a legacy of\r\nMr. Van Buren's \"illustrious predecessor,\" and had been \"vindicated\"\r\nby a Senate committee composed chiefly of his political opponents,\r\nhe was unquestionably a public swindler, and had found shelter\r\nunder Mr. Van Buren's administration.  He was the most conspicuous\r\npublic rascal of his time, but was far from being alone in his\r\nodious notoriety.  The system of public plunder inaugurated by\r\nJackson was in full blast, and an organized effort to reform it\r\nwas the real need of the hour; but here was the weak point of the\r\nWhigs.  They proceeded upon the perfectly gratuitous assumption\r\nthat the shameless abuses against which they clamored would be\r\nthoroughly reformed should they come into power.  They took it for\r\ngranted that a change would be equivalent to a cure, and that the\r\npeople would follow them in thus begging the very question on which\r\nsome satisfactory assurance was reasonably required.  They seemed\r\ntotally unconscious of the fact that human nature is essentially\r\nthe same in all parties, and that a mere change of men without any\r\nchange of system would be fruitless.  They laid down no programme\r\nlooking to the reform of the civil service.  They did not condemn\r\nit, and their sole panacea for the startling frauds and defalcations\r\nof Van Buren's administration was the imagined superior virtue and\r\npatriotism of the Whigs.  In the light of this fact alone, it is\r\nimpossible to account for the perfectly unbounded and irrepressible\r\nenthusiasm which swept over the land during the campaign, and so\r\nsignally routed the forces of Democracy.  Something more than empty\r\npromises and windy declamation was necessary, and that something,\r\nin an evil hour, was supplied by the Democrats themselves.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison was a man of Revolutionary blood.  He commanded\r\nthe confidence of the chief Fathers of the Republic.  He was a man\r\nof undoubted bravery, and had made a most honorable record, both\r\nas a soldier and a civilian, upon ample trial in both capacities.\r\nHe was unquestionably honest and patriotic, and the fact that he\r\nwas a poor man, and a plain farmer of the West, could properly form\r\nno objection to his character or his fitness for the Presidency.\r\nBut the Democratic orators and newspapers assailed him as an\r\n\"imbecile.\"  They called him a \"dotard\" and a \"granny.\"  They said\r\nhe had distinguished himself in war by running away from the enemy.\r\nOne Democratic journalist spoke of him, contemptuously, as a man\r\nwho should be content with a log cabin and a barrel of hard cider,\r\nwithout aspiring to the Presidency.  The efforts to belittle his\r\nmerits and defile his good name became systematic, and degenerated\r\ninto the most unpardonable personal abuse and political defamation.\r\nThis was exactly what the Whigs needed to supplement their lack of\r\nprinciples.  It worked like a charm.  It rallied the Whig masses\r\nlike a grand battle-cry.  Mass-meetings of the people, such as had\r\nnever been dreamed of before, became the order of the day.  The\r\npeople took the work of politics into their own keeping, and the\r\nleaders became followers.  The first monster meeting I attended\r\nwas held on the Tippecanoe battle-ground, on the 29th and 30th of\r\nMay.  In order to attend it I rode on horseback through the mud\r\nand swamps one hundred and fifty miles; but I considered myself\r\namply compensated for the journey in what I saw and enjoyed.  The\r\ngathering was simply immense; and I remember that James Brooks,\r\nsince conspicuous in our national politics, tried to address the\r\nmultitude from the top of a huge log cabin.  Large shipments of\r\nhard cider had been sent up the Wabash by steamer, and it was\r\nliberally dealt out to the people in gourds, as more appropriate\r\nand old-fashioned than glasses.  The people seemed to be supremely\r\nhappy, and their faces were so uniformly radiant with smiles that\r\na man who was detected with a serious countenance was at once\r\nsuspected as an unrepentant \"Loco-foco.\"  But by far the largest\r\nmeeting of the campaign was that held at Dayton, on the 12th day\r\nof September, where General Harrison spoke at length.  He was the\r\nfirst \"great man\" I had seen; and, while gazing into his face with\r\nan awe which I have never since felt for any mortal, I was suddenly\r\nrecalled from my rapt condition by the exit of my pocket-book.\r\nThe number in attendance at this meeting was estimated at two\r\nhundred thousand, and I think it could not have been far out of\r\nthe way.  I am sure I have never seen it equaled, although I have\r\nwitnessed many great meetings within the past forty years.  The\r\nmarked peculiarity of all the gatherings of this campaign was a\r\ncertain grotesque pomp and extravagance of representation suggestive\r\nof a grand carnival.  The banners, devices and pictures were\r\ninnumerable, while huge wagons were mounted with log cabins, cider\r\nbarrels, canoes, miniature ships, and raccoons.\r\n\r\nBut the most distinguishing feature of the campaign was its music.\r\nThe spirit of song was everywhere, and made the whole land vocal.\r\nThe campaign was set to music, and the song seriously threatened\r\nto drown the stump speech.  Whiggery was translated into a tune,\r\nand poured itself forth in doggerel rhymes which seemed to be born\r\nof the hour, and exactly suited to the crisis.  I give a few\r\nspecimens, partly from memory, and partly from \"The Harrison and\r\nLog Cabin Song Book\" of 1840, a copy of which is before me:\r\n\r\n  What has caused the great commotion, motion, motion,\r\n  Our country through?\r\n  It is the ball a-rolling on, on,\r\n  For Tippecanoe and Tyler too--Tippecanoe and Tyler too;\r\n  And with them we'll beat little Van, Van, Van;\r\n  Van is a used up man;\r\n  And with them we'll beat little Van.\r\n\r\n  Like the rushing of mighty waters, waters, waters,\r\n  On it will go,\r\n  And in its course will clear the way\r\n  For Tippecanoe and Tyler too--Tippecanoe and Tyler too;\r\n  And with them we'll beat little Van, Van, Van;\r\n  Van is a used up man;\r\n  And with them we'll beat little Van.\r\n\r\nThe famous \"ball\" alluded to in this song originated with the Whigs\r\nof Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and was sent by them to a Mass\r\nConvention held at Baltimore.  It was ten or twelve feet in diameter,\r\nand upon the ends of it, on blue ground, were stars corresponding\r\nin number with the States of the Union.  On its wide spaces of red\r\nand white stripes various inscriptions were made, including the\r\nfollowing, which belongs to the poetry and music of the campaign:\r\n\r\n  With heart and soul\r\n  This ball we roll;\r\n  May times improve\r\n  As on we move.\r\n\r\n  This Democratic ball\r\n  Set rolling first by Benton,\r\n  Is on another track\r\n  From that it first was sent on.\r\n\r\n  Farewell, dear Van,\r\n  You're not our man;\r\n  To guide the ship,\r\n  We'll try old Tip.\r\n\r\nThe following, sung to the tune of \"Old Rosin the Bow,\" was quite\r\nas popular:\r\n\r\n  Come ye who, whatever betide her,\r\n  To Freedom have sworn to be true,\r\n  Prime up with a cup of hard cider,\r\n  And drink to old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\n  On top I've a cask of as good, sir,\r\n  As man from the tap ever drew;\r\n  No poison to cut up your blood, sir,\r\n  But liquor as pure as the dew.\r\n\r\n  Parched corn men can't stand it much longer,\r\n  Enough is as much as we'll bear;\r\n  With Tip at our head, in October,\r\n  We'll tumble Van out of the chair.\r\n\r\n  Then ho! for March fourth, forty-one, boys,\r\n  We'll shout till the heavens' arched blue\r\n  Shall echo hard cider and fun, boys,\r\n  Drink, drink, to old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\nThe following kindred verses will be familiar to everybody who\r\nremembers the year 1840:\r\n\r\n  Ye jolly young lads of Ohio,\r\n  And all ye sick Vanocrats, too,\r\n  Come out from among the foul party,\r\n  And vote for old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\n  Good men from the Van jacks are flying,\r\n  Which makes them look kinder askew,\r\n  For they see they are joining the standard\r\n  With the hero of Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\n  They say that he lived in a cabin,\r\n  And lived on old cider, too;\r\n  Well, what if he did?  I'm certain\r\n  He's the hero of Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\nI give the following verses of one of the best, which used to be\r\nsung with tremendous effect:\r\n\r\n  The times are bad, and want curing;\r\n  They are getting past all enduring;\r\n  Let us turn out Martin Van Buren,\r\n  And put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n  The best thing we can do,\r\n  Is to put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\n  It's a business we all can take part in,\r\n  So let us give notice to Martin\r\n  That he must get ready for sartin',\r\n  For we'll put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n  The best thing we can do\r\n  Is to put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\n  We've had of their humbugs a plenty;\r\n  For now all our pockets are empty;\r\n  We've a dollar now where we had twenty,\r\n  So we'll put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n  The best thing we can do,\r\n  Is to put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\nThe following verses are perfectly characteristic:\r\n\r\n  See the farmer to his meal\r\n  Joyfully repair;\r\n  Crackers, cheese and cider, too,\r\n  A hard but homely fare.\r\n\r\n  Martin to his breakfast comes\r\n  At the hour of noon;\r\n  Sipping from a china cup,\r\n  With a golden spoon.\r\n\r\n  Martin's steeds impatient wait\r\n  At the palace door;\r\n  Outriders behind the coach\r\n  And lackeys on before.\r\n\r\nAfter the State election in Maine, a new song appeared, which at\r\nonce became a favorite, and from which I quote the following:\r\n\r\n  And have you heard the news from Maine,\r\n  And what old Maine can do?\r\n  She went hell bent for Governor Kent,\r\n  And Tippecanoe and Tyler too,\r\n  And Tippecanoe and Tyler too.\r\n\r\nSuch was this most remarkable Whig campaign, with its monster\r\nmeetings and music, its infinite drolleries, its rollicking fun,\r\nand its strong flavor of political lunacy.  As to the canvass of\r\nthe Democrats, the story is soon told.  In all points it was the\r\nreverse of a success.  The attempt to manufacture enthusiasm failed\r\nsignally.  They had neither fun nor music in their service, and\r\nthe attempt to secure them would have been completely overwhelmed\r\nby the flood on the other side.  It was a melancholy struggle, and\r\nconstantly made more so by the provoking enthusiasm and unbounded\r\ngood humor of the Whigs.  It ended as a campaign of despair, while\r\nits humiliating catastrophe must have awakened inexpressible\r\ndisappointment and disgust both among the leaders and masses of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nThis picture of party politics, forty-three years ago, is not very\r\nflattering to our American pride, but it simply shows the working\r\nof Democratic institutions in dealing with the \"raw material\" of\r\nsociety and life at that time.  The movement of 1840 was necessarily\r\ntransient and provisional, while underneath its clatter and nonsense\r\nwas a real issue.  It was unrecognized by both parties, but it made\r\nits advent, and the men who pointed its way quietly served notice\r\nupon the country of their ulterior purposes.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as the year 1817, Charles Osborn had established an\r\nanti-slavery newspaper in Ohio, entitled \"The Philanthropist,\"\r\nwhich was followed in 1821 by the publication of Benjamin Lundy's\r\n\"Genius of Universal Emancipation.\"  In 1831 the uprising of slaves\r\nin Southampton County, Virginia, under the lead of Nat. Turner,\r\nhad startled the country and invited attention to the question of\r\nslavery.  In the same year Garrison had established \"The Liberator,\"\r\nand in 1835 was mobbed in Boston, and dragged through its streets\r\nwith a rope about his neck.  In 1837 Lovejoy had been murdered in\r\nAlton, Illinois, and his assassins compared by the Mayor of Boston\r\nto the patriots of the Revolution.  In 1838 a pro-slavery mob had\r\nset fire to Pennsylvania Hall, in Philadelphia, and defied the city\r\nauthorities in this service of slavery.  President Jackson and Amos\r\nKendall, his Postmaster General, had openly set the Constitution\r\nat defiance by justifying the rifling of the mails and the suppression\r\nof the circulation of anti-slavery newspapers in the South.  The\r\n\"gag\" resolutions had been introduced in the House of Representatives\r\nin 1836, which provoked the splendid fights of Adams, Giddings and\r\nSlade for the right of petition and the freedom of speech.  Dr.\r\nChanning had published his prophetic letter to Henry Clay, on the\r\nannexation of Texas, in 1837, and awakened a profound interest in\r\nthe slavery question on both sides of the Atlantic.  We had been\r\ndisgraced by two Florida wars, caused by the unconstitutional\r\nespousal of slavery by the General Government.  President Van Buren\r\nhad dishonored his administration and defied the moral sense of\r\nthe civilized world by his efforts to prostitute our foreign policy\r\nto the service of slavery and the slave trade.  In February, 1839,\r\nHenry Clay had made his famous speech on \"Abolitionism,\" and thus\r\nrecognized the bearing of the slavery question upon the presidential\r\nelection of the following year.  The Abolitionists had laid siege\r\nto the conscience and humanity of the people, and their moral\r\nappeals were to be a well-spring of life to the nation in its final\r\nstruggle for self-preservation; but as yet they had agreed upon no\r\norganized plan of action against the aggressions of an institution\r\nwhich threatened the overthrow of the Union and the end of Republican\r\ngovernment.  But now they were divided into two camps, the larger\r\nof which favored political action, organized as a party, and\r\nnominated, as its candidate for President, James G. Birney, who\r\nreceived nearly seven thousand votes.\r\n\r\nThis was a small beginning, but it was the beginning of the end.\r\nThat slavery was to be put down without political action in a\r\ngovernment carried on by the ballot was never a tenable proposition,\r\nand the inevitable work was at last inaugurated.  It was done\r\nopportunely.  Harrison and Van Buren were alike objectionable to\r\nanti-slavery men who understood their record.  To choose between\r\nthem was to betray the cause.  Van Buren had attempted to shelter\r\nthe slave trade under the national flag.  He had allied himself to\r\nthe enemies of the right of petition and the freedom of debate, as\r\nthe means of conciliating the South.  He had taken sides with\r\nJackson in his lawless interference with the mails at the bidding\r\nof slave-holders.  In a word, he had fairly earned the description\r\nof \"a Northern man with Southern principles.\"  General Harrison,\r\non the other hand, was a pro-slavery Virginian.  While Governor of\r\nIndiana Territory he had repeatedly sought the introduction of\r\nslavery into that region through the suspension of the ordnance of\r\n1787, which had forever dedicated it to freedom.  He had taken\r\nsides with the South in 1820 on the Missouri question.  He had no\r\nsympathy with the struggle of Adams and his associates, against\r\nthe gag and in favor of the right of petition, and regarded the\r\ndiscussion of the slavery question as unconstitutional.  The first\r\ndraft of his inaugural was so wantonly offensive to the anti-slavery\r\nWhigs who had aided in his election, that even Mr. Clay condemned\r\nit, and prevailed on the General to modify it.  He had declared\r\nthat \"the schemes of the Abolitionists were fraught with horrors,\r\nupon which an incarnate devil only could look with approbation.\"\r\nWith such candidates the hour had fairly struck for anti-slavery\r\nmen, who believed in the use of the ballot, to launch the grand\r\nmovement which was finally to triumph over all opposition; while\r\nto oppose this movement, however honestly, was to encourage men to\r\nchoose between parties equally untrustworthy, and by thus prolonging\r\ntheir rule to defeat all practical anti-slavery work.  It was the\r\nsingular mistake of the non-voting Abolitionists at this time,\r\nthat, while they looked forward to political action as the ultimate\r\nresult of their moral agitation, they vehemently opposed the\r\nformation of an anti-slavery political party, and either withheld\r\ntheir votes or divided them between these pro-slavery chieftains,\r\nthough giving by far the larger proportion to the Whig candidate.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward anti-slavery progress was more marked.  The\r\nstruggle over the right of petition in Congress continued, and was\r\ncharacterized by a constantly increasing measure of fierceness on\r\nthe part of the South.  This is vividly depicted in a passage from\r\nthe diary of Mr. Adams, in March, 1841, in which he declares that\r\n\"The world, the flesh, and all the devils in hell are arrayed\r\nagainst any man who now, in this North American Union, shall dare\r\nto join the standard of Almighty God to put down the African slave\r\ntrade; and what can I, upon the verge of my seventy-fourth birthday,\r\nwith a shaking hand, a darkening eye, a drowsy brain, and with all\r\nmy faculties dropping from me one by one as the teeth are dropping\r\nfrom my head, what can I do for the cause of God and man, for the\r\nprogress of human emancipation, for the suppression of the African\r\nslave-trade?  Yet my conscience presses me on; let me but die upon\r\nthe breach.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated trial of Mr. Adams the following year, for presenting\r\na petition from the citizens of Haverhill, requesting Congress to\r\ntake steps toward a peaceable dissolution of the Union, was a great\r\nnational event, and his triumph gave a new impulse to the cause of\r\nfreedom.  The censure of Mr. Giddings which followed, for offering\r\nresolutions in the House embodying the simplest truisms respecting\r\nthe relations of the General Government to slavery, and the elaborate\r\nState paper of Mr. Webster, which provoked these resolutions, in\r\nwhich he attempted to commit the Government to the protection of\r\nslavery on the high seas, in accordance with the theories of Mr.\r\nCalhoun, still further kept alive the anti-slavery agitation, and\r\nawakened the interest of Northern men.  A kindred aid, unwittingly\r\nrendered the anti-slavery cause, was the infamous diplomacy of\r\nGeneral Cass, our Ambassador to France in 1842, in connection with\r\nthe Quintuple Treaty for the suppression of the African slave trade.\r\nHis monstrous effort to shield that trade under the flag of the\r\nUnited States was characterized by Mr. Adams as \"a compound of\r\nYankee cunning, of Italian perfidy, and of French _légéreté_,\r\ncemented by shameless profligacy unparalleled in American diplomacy.\"\r\nIn October, 1842, Henry Clay himself became an anti-slavery agitator\r\nthrough his famous \"Mendenhall Speech\" at Richmond, Indiana.  In\r\nresponse to a petition asking him to emancipate his slaves, he told\r\nthe people \"that whatever the law secures as property _is_ property,\"\r\nand described his slaves as \"being well fed and clad,\" and as\r\nlooking \"sleek and hearty.\"  \"Go home, Mr. Mendenhall,\" said he,\r\n\"and mind your own business, and leave other people to take care\r\nof theirs.\"  Mr. Mendenhall was an anti-slavery Quaker; but Mr.\r\nClay, while rebuking him severely, took pains to compliment the\r\nsociety itself on its practically pro-slavery attitude, and thus\r\nstung into redoubled earnestness and zeal the men who had recently\r\nbeen driven out of it on account of their \"abolitionism.\"  On the\r\nday following this speech, which was the Sabbath, he was escorted\r\nto the yearly meeting by Elijah Coffin, its clerk, seated in a very\r\nconspicuous place, honored by every mark of the most obsequious\r\ndeference, and thus made the instrument of widening the breach\r\nalready formed in the society, while feeding the anti-slavery fires\r\nwhich he was so anxious to assuage.\r\n\r\nThe work of agitation was still further kept alive by conflicts\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern States respecting the reclamation\r\nof fugitives from crime.  Virginia had demanded of New York the\r\nsurrender of three colored sailors who were charged with having\r\naided a slave to escape.  Governor Seward refused to deliver them\r\nup, for the reason that the Constitutional provision on the subject\r\nmust be so understood as that States would only be required to\r\nsurrender fugitives accused of an offense considered a crime in\r\nthe State called upon to make the surrender as well as in the State\r\nasking for it.  Similar controversies occurred between other States,\r\nin all of which the South failed in her purpose.  The anti-slavery\r\nspirit found further expression in 1843 in Massachusetts, whose\r\nLegislature resolved to move, through the Representatives of the\r\nState in Congress, an Amendment to the Constitution, basing\r\nrepresentation on the free population only of the States; which\r\nproposition gave rise to a most memorable debate in the national\r\nHouse of Representatives.  It was in the August of the same year\r\nthat the voting Abolitionists held a National Convention in Buffalo,\r\nin which all the free States, except New Hampshire, were represented;\r\nwhile in the following year the Methodist Episcopal Church was rent\r\nin twain by the same unmanageable question, which had previously\r\ndivided other ecclesiastical communions.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the question of Texan annexation had been steadily\r\nadvancing to the political front, and stirring the blood of the\r\npeople both North and South.  This \"robbery of a realm,\" as Dr.\r\nChanning had styled it, was the unalterable purpose and unquenchable\r\ndesire of the slave-holding interest, and its accomplishment was\r\nto be secured by openly espousing the principle that the end\r\njustifies the means, and setting all consequences at defiance.\r\nThis is exactly what the Government did.  The diplomacy through\r\nwhich the plot was prosecuted was marked by a cunning, audacity,\r\nand perfidy, which, in these particulars, leave the administration\r\nof John Tyler unrivalled in its ugly pre-eminence, and form one of\r\nthe blackest pages in the history of the Republic.  The momentous\r\nquestion was now upon us; and on the dawning of the year 1844, all\r\nparties saw that it was destined to be the overshadowing issue in\r\nthe ensuing presidential campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF 1844--ANNEXATION AND SLAVERY.\r\nThe nomination of Clay--His position on the slavery question and\r\nannexation--Van Buren's letter to Hammet, and its effect upon the\r\nSouth--His repudiation, and the nomination of Polk--The surprise\r\nof the country--Unbounded confidence of the Whigs--The course of\r\nthe New York Democrats--The \"Kane Letter\"--Trouble among the Whigs\r\non the annexation question--Fierceness of the contest, and singular\r\nability of the leaders--The effect of Clay's defeat upon the Whigs\r\n--Causes of the defeat--The Abolitionists, and the abuse heaped\r\nupon them--Cassius M. Clay--Mr. Hoar's mission to South Carolina--\r\nElection of John P. Hale--Annexation and war with Mexico--Polk's\r\nmessage, and the Wilmot proviso--The Oregon question, and Alex. H.\r\nStephens.\r\n\r\nThe times were serious.  The fun and frolic of 1840 had borne no\r\nfruit, and that part of our history could not be repeated.  The\r\ncampaign of 1844 promised to be a struggle for principle; and among\r\nthe Whigs all eyes were turned for a standard-bearer to Mr. Clay,\r\nwho had been so shabbily treated four years before.  He was\r\nunanimously nominated on the first of May, with Theodore Frelinghuysen\r\nas the candidate for Vice President.  The party issues were not\r\nvery sharply defined, but this was scarcely necessary with a\r\ncandidate who was proverbially regarded as himself \"the embodiment\r\nof Whig principles.\"  On the subject of annexation, he clearly\r\ndefined his position in his letter of the 17th of April to the\r\n\"National Intelligencer.\"  He declared that annexation and war with\r\nMexico were identical, and placed himself squarely against it,\r\nexcept upon conditions specified, which would make the project of\r\nimmediate annexation impossible.  On the slavery question, he had\r\nnot yet seriously offended the anti-slavery element in his own\r\nparty, and was even trusted by some of the voting anti-slavery men.\r\nIn a speech at Raleigh, in April of this year, he declared it to\r\nbe \"the duty of each State to sustain its own domestic institutions.\"\r\nHe had publicly said that the General Government had nothing to do\r\nwith slavery, save in the matters of taxation, representation, and\r\nthe return of fugitive slaves.  He had condemned the censure of\r\nMr. Giddings in 1842 as an outrage, and indorsed the principles\r\nlaid down in his tract, signed \"Pacificus,\" on the relations of\r\nthe Federal Government to slavery, and the rights and duties of\r\nthe people of the free States.  In his earlier years, he had been\r\nan outspoken emancipationist, and had always frankly expressed his\r\nopinion that slavery was a great evil.  These considerations, and\r\nespecially his unequivocal utterances against the annexation scheme,\r\nwere regarded as hopeful auguries of a thoroughly united party,\r\nand its triumph at the polls; while Mr. Webster, always on the\r\npresidential anxious-seat, and carefully watching the signs of the\r\npolitical zodiac, now cordially lent his efforts to the Whig cause.\r\n\r\nWith the Democracy, Mr. Van Buren was still a general favorite.\r\nHis friends felt that the wrong done him in 1840 should now be\r\nrighted, and a large majority of his party undoubtedly favored his\r\nrenomination.  But his famous letter to Mr. Hammet, of Mississippi,\r\ndated March 27th, on the annexation of Texas, placed a lion in his\r\npath.  In this lengthy and elaborate document he committed himself\r\nagainst the project of immediate annexation, and the effect was at\r\nonce seen in the decidedly unfriendly tone of Democratic opinion\r\nin the South.  He had been faithful to the Slave oligarchy in many\r\nthings, but his failure in one was counted a breach of the whole\r\nlaw.  By many acts of patient and dutiful service he had earned\r\nthe gratitude of his Southern task-masters; but now, when driven\r\nto the wall, he mustered the courage to say, \"Thus far, no farther\";\r\nand for this there was no forgiveness.  General Jackson came to\r\nhis rescue, but it was in vain.  The Southern heart was set upon\r\nimmediate annexation as the golden opportunity for rebuilding the\r\nendangered edifice of slavery, and Mr. Van Buren's talk about\r\nnational obligations and the danger of a foreign war was treated\r\nas the idle wind.  The Southern Democrats were bent upon his\r\noverthrow, and they went about it in the Baltimore Convention of\r\nthe 27th of May as if perfectly conscious of their power over the\r\nNorthern wing of the party.  They moved and carried the \"two-thirds\r\nrule,\" which had been acted on in the National Convention of 1832,\r\nand afterward in that of 1835, although this could not have been\r\ndone without the votes of a majority of the convention, which was\r\nitself strongly for Van Buren.  The rule was adopted by a considerable\r\nmajority, the South being nearly unanimous in its favor, while the\r\nNorth largely \"supplied the men who handed Van Buren over to his\r\nenemies with a kiss.\"  Even General Cass, the most gifted and\r\naccomplished dough-face in the Northern States, failed to receive\r\na majority of the votes of the Convention on any ballot, and James\r\nK. Polk was finally nominated as the champion of immediate annexation,\r\nwith George M. Dallas as the candidate for Vice President.\r\n\r\nThe nomination was a perfect surprise to the country, because Mr.\r\nPolk was wholly unknown to the people as a statesman.  Like Governor\r\nHayes, when nominated in 1876, he belonged to the \"illustrious\r\nobscure.\"  The astonished native who, on hearing the news, suddenly\r\ninquired of a bystander, \"Who the devil is Polk?\" simply echoed\r\nthe common feeling, while his question provoked the general laughter\r\nof the Whigs.  For a time the nomination was somewhat disappointing\r\nto the Democrats themselves; but they soon rallied, and finally\r\nwent into the canvass very earnestly, and with a united front.\r\nThe Whigs began the campaign in high hopes and in fact with unbounded\r\nconfidence in their success.  Their great captain was in command,\r\nand they took comfort in his favorite utterance that \"truth is\r\nomnipotent, and public justice certain.\"  To pit him against such\r\na pigmy as Polk seemed to them a miserable burlesque, and they\r\ncounted their triumph as already perfectly assured.  They claimed\r\nthe advantage on the question of annexation, and still more as to\r\nthe tariff, since the act of 1842 was popular, and Polk was known\r\nto be a free-trader of the Calhoun school.  As the canvass proceeded,\r\nhowever, it became evident that the fight was to be fierce and\r\nbitter to the last degree, and that the issue, after all, was not\r\nso certain.  Mr. Polk, notwithstanding his obscurity, was able to\r\nrouse the enthusiasm of his party, North and South, to a very\r\nremarkable degree.  The annexation pill was swallowed by many\r\nDemocrats whose support of him had been deemed morally impossible.\r\nIn New York, where the opposition was strongest, leading Democrats,\r\nwith William Cullen Bryant as their head, denounced the annexation\r\nscheme and repudiated the paragraph of the National platform which\r\nfavored it, and yet voted for Polk, who owed his nomination solely\r\nto the fact that he had committed himself to the policy of immediate\r\nand unconditional annexation, thus anticipating the sickly political\r\nmorality of 1852, when so many men of repute tried in vain to save\r\nboth their consciences and their party orthodoxy by \"spitting upon\r\nthe platform and swallowing the candidate who stood upon it.\"\r\nHistory will have to record that the action of these New York\r\nDemocrats saved the ticket in that State, and justly attaches to\r\nthem the responsibility for the very evils to the country against\r\nwhich they so eloquently warned their brethren.  The power of the\r\nspoils came in as a tremendous make-weight, while the party lash\r\nwas vigorously flourished, and the \"independent voter\" was as\r\nhateful to the party managers on both sides as we find him to-day.\r\nThose who refused to wear the party collar were branded by the\r\n\"organs\" as a \"pestiferous and demoralizing brood,\" who deserved\r\n\"extermination.\"  Discipline was rigorously enforced, and made to\r\ntake the place of argument.  As regards the tariff question, Mr.\r\nPolk's letter to Judge Kane, of Philadelphia, of the 19th of June,\r\nenabled his friends completely to turn the tables on the Whigs of\r\nPennsylvania, where \"Polk, Dallas, and the tariff of 1842,\" was\r\nblazoned on the Democratic banners, and thousands of Democrats were\r\nactually made to believe that Polk was even a better tariff man\r\nthan Clay.  This letter, committing its free-trade author to the\r\nprinciple of a revenue tariff, with \"reasonable incidental protection\r\nto our home industries,\" was translated into German and printed in\r\nall the party papers; and as a triumphant effort to make the people\r\nbelieve a lie, and a masterpiece of political duplicity employed\r\nby the great party as a means of success, it had no precedent in\r\nAmerican politics.  In later times, however, it has been completely\r\neclipsed by the scheme of \"tissue ballots,\" and other wholesale\r\nmethods of balking the popular will in the South, by the successful\r\neffort to cheat the nation out of the right to choose its Chief\r\nMagistrate in 1876, and by the startling bribery of a great\r\ncommonwealth four years later, now unblushingly confessed by the\r\nparty leaders who accomplished it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the spirit of discontent began to manifest itself\r\namong the Whigs of the South respecting Mr. Clay's attitude on the\r\nquestion of annexation, and in a moment of weakness he wrote his\r\nunfortunate \"Alabama letter,\" of the 27th of July.  In that letter\r\nhe said:  \"I do not think the subject of slavery ought to affect\r\nthe question one way or the other.  Whether Texas be independent\r\nor incorporated into the United States, I do not believe it will\r\nprolong or shorten the duration of that institution.\"  He also\r\ndeclared that he would be \"glad to see it, without dishonor, without\r\nwar, with the common consent of the Union, and upon just and fair\r\nterms.\"  These words were perfectly chilling to his anti-slavery\r\nsupporters, who were utterly opposed to annexation on _any_ terms,\r\nbecause the power of slavery would thus inevitably be extended and\r\nstrengthened in the United States.  The letter was an irreparable\r\nmistake.  It was a fresh example of his besetting tendency to\r\nmediate between opposing policies, and undoubtedly drove from his\r\nsupport many who would otherwise have followed the Whig banner to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nBut the Whigs kept up the fight.  The issues were joined, and it\r\nwas too late to change front.  The real question in dispute was\r\nthat of annexation, and the election of Polk was certain to secure\r\nit, and to involve the nation in war.  Clay was unquestionably\r\nright in saying that annexation and war were identical; and, although\r\non the slavery question he might be feared as a compromiser, there\r\nwas no reason to doubt that, if elected, he would vigorously resist\r\nthe annexation scheme, except upon conditions already stated, which\r\ncould not fail to defeat it as a present measure and avoid the\r\ncalamities of war.  I was inexpressibly disappointed and grieved\r\nby his letter; but I agreed with Cassius M. Clay, that opposition\r\nto annexation except \"with the common consent of the Union\" was\r\npractically absolute opposition, and I therefore kept up the fight\r\nin which I had enlisted in the beginning and made my first venture\r\nas a stump speaker.  I cared little about the old party issues.\r\nI had outgrown the teachings of the Whigs on the subject of\r\nprotection, and especially their pet dogma of \"the higher the duty\r\nthe lower the price of the protected article.\"  As to a national\r\nbank, I followed Webster, who had pronounced it \"an obsolete idea\";\r\nand I totally repudiated the land policy of the Whigs, having at\r\nthat early day espoused the principle that the public lands should\r\ncease to be a source of revenue, and be granted in small homesteads\r\nto the landless poor for actual settlement and tillage.  But on\r\nthe subject of slavery, though it had escaped my attention in the\r\nhurrah of 1840, I was thoroughly aroused.  This came of my Quaker\r\ntraining, the speeches of Adams and Giddings, the anti-slavery\r\nnewspapers, and the writings of Dr. Channing, all of which I had\r\nbeen reading with profound interest since the Harrison Campaign.\r\nBeing perfectly sure that annexation would lead to slavery-extension\r\nand war, I thought it my clear and unhesitating duty to resist the\r\nelection of Polk with all my might.  This I did to the end, and in\r\ndoing it I employed substantially the same arguments on which I\r\njustified my separation from the Whigs four years later.\r\n\r\nThe contest proceeded with its variety of charges and counter-\r\ncharges, and was prosecuted on both sides with extraordinary vigor\r\nand zeal in every part of the Union.  I think it was everywhere\r\nand pre-eminently a struggle between the men of brains on either\r\nside.  I am quite sure this was true in my own State.  Indiana was\r\nremarkable at that time, not only for her gifted stump orators,\r\nbut for her men of real calibre and power of argument.  On the side\r\nof the Whigs were such men as Oliver H. Smith, Joseph G. Marshall,\r\nGeorge G. Dunn, Joseph L. White, Richard W. Thompson, Caleb B.\r\nSmith, George H. Proffit, Henry S. Lane, Samuel W. Parker, and\r\nJames H. Cravens.  The Democrats could boast of Tilghman A. Howard,\r\nJames Whitcomb, Edward A. Hannegan, William W. Wick, John Law,\r\nJoseph A. Wright, Jesse D. Bright, John W. Davis, Thomas J. Henly,\r\nand John L. Robinson.  The best talking talent of the nation was\r\ncalled into service, including such Democratic giants as Thomas H.\r\nBenton, William Allen, Silas Wright, Robert J. Walker, James\r\nBuchanan, and Daniel S. Dickinson; and such Whigs to match them as\r\nDaniel Webster, Rufus Choate, Thomas F. Marshall, Thomas Corwin,\r\nS. S. Prentiss, Thomas Ewing, and W. C. Preston.  The fight was\r\nmore ably if not more hotly contested than any preceding national\r\nstruggle, raging and blazing everywhere, while the forces marshaled\r\nagainst each other were more evenly balanced than in any contest\r\nsince the year 1800.  The race was so close that the result hung\r\nin agonizing doubt and suspense up to the evening following the\r\nelection.  Party feeling rose to a frenzy, and the consuming desire\r\nof the Whigs to crown their great Chief with the laurels of victory\r\nwas only equaled by that of the Democrats for the triumph of the\r\nunknown Tennessean whose nomination had provoked the aggravating\r\nlaughter of the enemy in the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to describe the effect of Mr. Clay's defeat upon\r\nthe Whigs.  It was wholly unexpected, and Mr. Clay especially\r\nremained sanguine as to his triumph up to the last moment.  When\r\nthe result became known, it was accepted by his friends as a great\r\nnational calamity and humiliation.  It shocked and paralyzed them\r\nlike a great tragedy.  I remember very vividly one zealous Whig,\r\nafterward a prominent Free Soiler and Republican leader, who was\r\nso utterly overwhelmed that for a week he lost the power of sleep,\r\nand gave himself up to political sorrow and despair.  Letters of\r\nthe most heart-felt condolence poured in upon Mr. Clay from all\r\nquarters, and the Whigs everywhere seemed to feel that no statesman\r\nof real eminence could ever be made President.  They insisted that\r\nan overwhelming preponderance of the virtue, intelligence and\r\nrespectability of the country had supported their candidate, while\r\nthe larger element of ignorance and \"unwashed\" humanity, including\r\nour foreign-born population, gave the victory to Mr. Polk.  Their\r\nfaith in republican government was fearfully shaken, while the\r\ncauses of the great disaster were of course sought out, and made\r\nthe text of hasty but copious moralizings.  One of these causes\r\nwas the Kane letter, which undoubtedly gave Mr. Polk the State of\r\nPennsylvania.  Another was the baneful influence of \"nativism,\"\r\nwhich had just broken out in the great cities, and been made the\r\noccasion of such frightful riot and bloodshed in Philadelphia as\r\nto alarm our foreign-born citizens, and throw them almost unanimously\r\nagainst the Whigs.  The Abolitionists declared that Mr. Clay's\r\ndefeat was caused by his trimming on the annexation question, which\r\ndrew from him a sufficient number of conscientious anti-slavery\r\nmen to have turned the tide in his favor.  The famous Plaquemine\r\nfrauds in Louisiana unquestionably lost that State to Mr. Clay.\r\nThis infamous conspiracy to strangle the voice of a sovereign State\r\nwas engineered by John Slidell, and it consisted of the shipment\r\nfrom New Orleans to Plaquemine of two steamboats loaded with roughs\r\nand villains, whose illegal votes were sufficient to turn the State\r\nover to the Democrats.\r\n\r\nBut the cause of Mr. Clay's defeat which was dwelt upon with most\r\nemphasis and feeling was the action of the Liberty party.  Birney,\r\nits candidate for President, received 66,304 votes, and these, it\r\nwas alleged, came chiefly from the Whig party.  The vote of these\r\nmen in New York and Michigan was greater than the Democratic\r\nmajority, so that if they had united with the Whigs, Clay would\r\nhave been elected in spite of all other opposition.  Mr. Polk's\r\nplurality over Clay in New York was only 5,106, while Birney received\r\nin that State 15,812; and Horace Greeley insisted that if only one\r\nthird of this vote had been cast for Mr. Clay, he would have been\r\nPresident.  The feeling of the Whigs against these anti-slavery\r\nmen was bitter and damnatory to the last degree.  The Plaquemine\r\nfrauds, the Kane letter, and everything else, were forgotten in\r\nthe general and abounding wrath against these \"fanatics,\" who were\r\ndenounced as the betrayers of their country and of the cause which\r\na very great and critical opportunity had placed it in their power\r\nto save.  \"The Abolitionists deserve to be damned, and they will\r\nbe,\" said a zealous Whig to an anti-slavery Quaker; and this was\r\nsimply the expression of the prevailing feeling at this time, at\r\nleast in the West.\r\n\r\nBut this treatment of the Abolitionists was manifestly unjust.\r\nTheir organization four years before was neither untimely nor\r\nunnecessary, but belonged to the inevitable logic of a great and\r\ndominating idea.  A party was absolutely necessary which should\r\nmake this idea paramount, and utterly refuse to be drawn away from\r\nit by any party divisions upon subsidiary questions.  It should be\r\nremembered, too, that the Liberty party was made up of Democratic\r\nas well as Whig deserters, and that if it had disbanded, or had\r\nnot been formed, the result of this election would have been the\r\nsame.  The statement of Mr. Greeley, that one third of Birney's\r\nvote in New York would have elected Clay, was unwarranted, unless\r\nhe was able to show what would have been the action of the other\r\ntwo thirds.  In justice to these Abolitionists it should also be\r\nremembered and recorded, to say the very least, that Mr. Clay\r\nhimself divided with them the responsibility of his defeat by his\r\nAlabama letter, and that now, in the clear perspective of history,\r\nthey stand vindicated against their Whig assailants, whose fevered\r\nbrains and party intolerance blinded their eyes to the truth.\r\nDoubtless there were honest differences of opinion as to the best\r\nmethod of serving the anti-slavery cause in this exasperating\r\ncampaign, and these differences may still survive as an inheritance;\r\nbut abolitionism, as a working force in our politics, had to have\r\na beginning, and no man who cherishes the memory of the old Free\r\nSoil party, and of the larger one to which it gave birth, will\r\nwithhold the meed of his praise from the heroic little band of\r\nsappers and miners who blazed the way for the armies which were to\r\nfollow, and whose voices, though but faintly heard in the whirlwind\r\nof 1840, were made significantly audible in 1844.  Although they\r\nwere everywhere totally misunderstood and grossly misrepresented,\r\nthey clearly comprehended their work and courageously entered upon\r\nits performance.  Their political creed was substantially identical\r\nwith that of the Free Soilers of 1848 and the Republicans of 1856\r\nand 1860.  They were anything but political fanatics, and history\r\nwill record that their sole offense was the espousal of the truth\r\nin advance of the multitude, which slowly and finally followed in\r\ntheir footsteps.\r\n\r\nBut the war against slavery was not at all intermitted by the\r\nvictory of the Democrats.  Events are schoolmasters, and this\r\ntriumph only quickened their march toward the final catastrophe.\r\nCassius M. Clay, who had espoused the Whig cause in this canvass\r\nwith great vigor and zeal, and on anti-slavery grounds, re-enlisted\r\nin the battle against slavery, and resolved to prosecute it by new\r\nmethods.  He had been sorely tried by Mr. Clay's Alabama letter\r\nand the Whig defeat, but he was now armed with fresh courage, and\r\nresolved to \"carry the war into Africa\" by the establishment of\r\nhis newspaper, the \"True American,\" in Lexington, in his own State.\r\nHis arraignment of slavery was so eloquent and masterly that a\r\nlarge meeting of slave-holders appointed a committee to wait on\r\nhim, and request the discontinuance of his paper.  His reply was:\r\n\"Go, tell your secret conclave of cowardly assassins that Cassius\r\nM. Clay knows his rights, and how to defend them.\"  These words\r\nthrilled all lovers of liberty, and sounded to them like a trumpet\r\ncall to battle.  Another fruitful event was the effort of Massachusetts,\r\nin the fall of this year, to protect her colored seamen in the\r\nports of Charleston and New Orleans, where they were seized on\r\nmerchant ships and sold into slavery under local police regulations.\r\nWhen Mr. Hoar visited Charleston as the accredited agent of his\r\nState for the purpose of taking measures to test the constitutionality\r\nof these regulations, the Legislature of South Carolina, by a vote\r\nof one hundred and nineteen against one, passed a series of outrageous\r\nresolutions culminating in a request to the Governor to expel him\r\nfrom the State as a confessed disturber of the peace.  He was\r\nobliged summarily to depart, as the only means of escaping the\r\nvengeance of the mob.  This open and insolent defiance of the\r\nnational authority could not fail to strengthen anti-slavery opinion\r\nin the Northern States.  The same end was served by an unexpected\r\nmovement in New Hampshire.  This State, like Massachusetts and\r\nVermont, had taken ground against annexation, but it wheeled into\r\nline after Polk was nominated.  John P. Hale, however, then a\r\nDemocratic member of Congress from that State, refused to follow\r\nhis party, and for this reason, after he had been formally declared\r\nits choice for re-election, he was thrown overboard, and another\r\ncandidate nominated.  No election, however, was effected, and his\r\nseat remained vacant during the 29th Congress, but he obtained a\r\nseat in the Legislature in 1846, and the following year was chosen\r\nUnited States Senator, while Amos Tuck, afterward a prominent Free\r\nSoiler, was elected to the Lower House of Congress.  These were\r\npregnant events, and especially the triumph of Hale, who became a\r\nvery formidable champion of freedom, and a thorn in the side of\r\nslavery till it perished.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the hunger for immediate annexation had been whetted\r\nby the election of Mr. Polk, and its champions hurried up their\r\nwork, and pushed it by methods in open disregard of the Constitution\r\nand of our treaty obligations with Mexico.  In the last hours of\r\nthe administration of John Tyler the atrocious plot received its\r\nfinishing touch and the Executive approval, and, in the apt words\r\nof the ablest and fairest historian of the transaction, \"the bridal\r\ndress in which Calhoun had led the beloved of the slaveocracy to\r\nthe Union was the torn and tattered Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\"  War with Mexico, as prophesied by the Whigs, speedily\r\nfollowed.  As early as August, 1845, General Taylor was ordered by\r\nPresident Polk to advance to a position on the Nueces.  In March\r\nof the following year, in pursuance of further orders, his army\r\nagain advanced, taking its position on the east bank of the Rio\r\nGrande, and, of course, on the soil of Mexico.  Hostilities naturally\r\nfollowed, and after two battles the President, in his message to\r\nCongress, declared that \"American blood has been shed on American\r\nsoil.\"  This robust Executive falsehood, with which the slave power\r\ncompelled him to face the civilized world, must always hold a very\r\nhigh rank in the annals of public audacity and crime.  It is what\r\nThomas Carlyle might have styled \"the second power of a lie,\" and\r\nis only rivaled by the parallel falsehood of Congress in declaring\r\nthat \"by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists\r\nbetween that Government and the United States.\"  In the message of\r\nthe President referred to, he recommended that a considerable sum\r\nof money be placed at his disposal for the purpose of negotiating\r\na peace, and it was on the consideration of this message that David\r\nWilmot fortunately obtained the floor, and moved his memorable\r\nproviso for the interdiction of slavery in any territory which\r\nmight be wrested from Mexico by our arms.  This was the session of\r\nCongress for 1846-47, and the proposition passed the House with\r\ngreat unanimity as to the Northern members.  At the following\r\nsession of Congress, on the 28th of February, 1848, the proviso\r\nagain came before the House, and the motion to lay it on the table\r\nfailed, all the Whigs and a large majority of the Democrats from\r\nthe free States voting in the negative.  It passed the House on\r\nthe 13th of December following, on a similar division of parties\r\nand sections, but the Senate refused to concur, and the Thirtieth\r\nCongress adjourned without any provisions whatever for the organization\r\nor government of our recently acquired Territories.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to notice in passing that on the first introduction\r\nof the Wilmot proviso, in August, 1846, General Cass was decidedly\r\nin its favor, and regretted that it had been talked to death by\r\nthe long speech of John Davis; but on the 24th of December, 1847,\r\nhe wrote his famous \"Nicholson letter,\" proclaiming his gospel of\r\n\"popular sovereignty\" in the Territories, which proved the seed-\r\nplot of immeasurable national trouble and disaster.  \"I am strongly\r\nimpressed with the opinion,\" said he, \"that a great change is going\r\non in the public mind on this subject--in my own mind as well as\r\nothers\"; and he had before declared, on the 19th of February, that\r\nthe passage of the Wilmot proviso \"would be death to the war, death\r\nto all hope of getting an acre of territory, death to the\r\nadministration, and death to the Democratic party.\"  This was\r\nthoroughly characteristic, and in perfect harmony with his action,\r\nalready referred to, respecting the Quintuple treaty; but it showed\r\nhow the political waters were being troubled by the slavery question,\r\nand how impossible it was to accommodate the growing anti-slavery\r\nfeeling of the country by any shallow expedients.\r\n\r\nBut another conspiracy against freedom was now hatched; and if the\r\nSenate had strangled the Wilmot proviso, it was gratifying to find\r\nthe House ready to strangle this monster of senatorial birth.  I\r\nallude to the now almost forgotten \"Clayton Compromise,\" which\r\npassed the Senate by a decided majority on the 26th of July.  By\r\nsubmitting the whole question of slavery in all our Territories to\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, as then constituted, it\r\nwould almost certainly have spawned the curse in all of them,\r\nincluding Oregon, which had long been exposed to peril and massacre\r\nby the reckless opposition of our slave-masters to a government\r\nthere without the recognition of slavery.  The defeat of this\r\nnefarious proposition, which was happily followed by the passage\r\nof a bill giving Oregon a territorial government, is largely due\r\nto Alexander H. Stephens, whose motion to lay it on the table in\r\nthe House prevailed by a small majority.  In this action he had\r\nthe courage to separate himself from the great body of the leading\r\nmen of his own section; but in doing so he was prompted by his\r\nsupreme devotion to slavery.  This he has since denied and labored\r\nto explain in his private correspondence and published works, but\r\nthe record is fatally against him.  He was unwilling to trust the\r\ninterests of the South in the hands of the Supreme Court, and his\r\nspeech of August 7th, in the House of Representatives, in defense\r\nof his motion, gave very plausible reasons for his apprehensions;\r\nbut the Dred Scott decision of a few years later showed how completely\r\nhe misjudged that tribunal, and how opportunely his blindness came\r\nto the rescue of freedom.  It seems now to have been providential;\r\nfor in this Continental plot against liberty the superior sagacity\r\nof Calhoun and his associates was demonstrated by subsequent events,\r\nwhile Mr. Stephens, with his great influence in the South, could\r\nalmost certainly have secured its triumph if he had become its\r\nchampion instead of its enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF 1848--ITS INCIDENTS AND RESULTS.\r\nThe approach of another presidential campaign--Party divisions\r\nthreatened by the Wilmot proviso--Nomination of Gen. Cass--The\r\n\"Nicholson Letter\"--Democratic division in New York--The nomination\r\nof Gen. Taylor--Whig divisions--Birth of the Free Soil party--The\r\nBuffalo Convention--Nomination of Van Buren and Adams--Difficulty\r\nof uniting on Van Buren--Incidents--Rev. Joshua Leavitt--The work\r\nof the campaign--Mr. Webster and Free Soil--Greeley and Seward--\r\nAbuse of Whig bolters--Remarkable results of the canvass.\r\n\r\nThe approach of another presidential year was thus marked by a\r\nsteadily growing interest in the question of slavery.  The conflict\r\nwith it seemed far more irrepressible than ever before.  The Liberty\r\nparty had nominated John P. Hale as its candidate in 1847.  The\r\nWhigs in Massachusetts were threatened with an incurable division\r\ninto \"Conscience Whigs\" and \"Cotton Whigs,\" growing out of the\r\nquestion of annexation and the government of our new Territories.\r\nThe same causes were dividing the Democrats of New York, and the\r\nfeud was seriously aggravated by remembering the defeat of Mr. Van\r\nBuren in 1844, for the one sin of opposing the immediate annexation\r\nof Texas, while a large majority of the party favored his nomination.\r\nThe Van Buren element in the Democratic party threatened revolt in\r\nother States, while both Whigs and Democrats in the North were\r\ncommitted to the policy of the Wilmot proviso.  This was to be the\r\ngreat question of the ensuing national canvass, and the roused\r\nspirit of the people of the free States seemed clearly to foreshadow\r\nthe triumph of freedom in the organization and government of our\r\nMexican acquisitions.\r\n\r\nBut the virtue and courage of our politicians were now to be severely\r\ntried.  The power of party discipline and the tempting bait of the\r\nspoils were to be employed as never before in swerving men from\r\ntheir convictions.  The South, of course, was a perfect unit, and\r\nfully resolved upon the spread of slavery over our Territories.\r\nIt had always been the absolute master of the Northern Democracy,\r\nand had no dream of anything less than the supremacy of its own\r\nwill.  Its favorite candidate was now Gen. Cass, and he was nominated\r\nby the Baltimore National Convention on the 22d day of May.  It\r\nwas a fit nomination for the party of slavery.  He had been thirsting\r\nfor it many years, and had earned it by multiplied acts of the most\r\nobsequious and crouching servility to his Southern overseers.\r\nAgain and again he had crawled in the dust at their feet, and, if\r\nthey could not now reward him with the presidency, it seemed utterly\r\nuseless for any Northern man to hope for their favor.  The \"Nicholson\r\nletter\" was not all that the South wanted, but it was a very\r\nimportant concession, and with Gen. Cass as its interpreter it\r\nmeant the nearest thing possible to a complete surrender.  In this\r\nNational Convention the State of New York had two sets of delegates,\r\nboth of which were formally admitted, as a compromise; but the\r\nmembers of the Van Buren or Free Soil wing refused to take their\r\nseats, and thus held themselves in reserve for such revolutionary\r\nwork as should afterward seem to them advisable.\r\n\r\nThe Whig National Convention met in Philadelphia on the 7th of\r\nJune.  The party seemed completely demoralized by the defeat of\r\nMr. Clay in the previous canvass, and was now in search of \"an\r\navailable candidate,\" and inspired by the same miserable policy of\r\nexpediency which had been so barren of results in 1840.  The Northern\r\nWhigs appeared to be unanimously and zealously committed to the\r\nprohibition of slavery in our Territories, but equally unanimous\r\nand zealous in the determination to succeed in the canvass.  For\r\nmore than a year Gen. Taylor had been growing into favor with the\r\nparty as a candidate, and he had now become decidedly formidable.\r\nThe spectacle was a melancholy one, since it demonstrated the\r\nreadiness of this once respectable old party to make complete\r\nshipwreck of everything wearing the semblance of principle, for\r\nthe sake of success.  General Taylor had never identified himself\r\nin any way with the Whig party.  He had spent his life as a mere\r\nsoldier on the frontier, and had never given a vote.  He had frankly\r\nsaid he had not made up his mind upon the questions which divided\r\nthe parties.  He not only refused to be the exponent of Whig\r\nprinciples, but accepted the nomination of bodies of men not known\r\nas Whigs, who scouted the idea of being bound by the acts of any\r\nnational convention.  He was a very large slave-owner, and thus\r\nidentified in interest, and presumably in sympathy, with the South;\r\nbut he could not be induced to define his position.  His active\r\nsupporters were chiefly from the slave-holding States and those\r\nfree States which had generally given Democratic majorities, while\r\nthe men most violent in their opposition to the Wilmot proviso were\r\nhis most conspicuous followers; but the Whigs from the free States\r\nvouched for his soundness on the slavery issue.  His letters\r\ncontained nothing but vague generalities, and he utterly declined\r\nto commit himself on the question that was stirring the nation to\r\nits depths.  To the different sections of the Union he wore a\r\ndifferent face, and each section seemed confident that the other\r\nwould be duped, while cordially joining in a common struggle for\r\nthe spoils of office which constituted the sole bond of union.\r\nHis early letters, before he fell into the hands of the politicians,\r\nwere frank and unstudied, reflecting his character as a plain old\r\nsoldier without any political training; but his later letters were\r\ndiplomatic, not wanting in style and finish, and obviously written\r\nby others.  His second letter to Allison, on which the campaign\r\nwas finally fought, was written in the room of Alexander H. Stephens,\r\nin Washington, after consulting with Toombs and Crittenden, and\r\nafterward forwarded to Taylor, who gave it to the world as his own.\r\nHe had constantly about him a sort of political body-guard, or\r\n\"committee of safety,\" to direct his way during the canvass, and\r\nno one could reasonably pretend that any principle whatever would\r\nbe settled by the election.  He had whipped the Mexicans, and the\r\nWhig platform was \"Rough and Ready,\" \"A little more Grape, Captain\r\nBragg,\" and political success.\r\n\r\nThe nomination, moreover, was accomplished by methods which made\r\nit exceedingly exasperating to Mr. Clay and his friends.  The\r\ntreachery of the Whig managers to their great leader exceeded that\r\nwhich had sacrificed him at the Harrisburg Convention of 1839.\r\nThe Whigs of Virginia nominated Taylor on the credit of a forged\r\ndispatch, to the effect that Kentucky had decided in his favor,\r\nand thus abandoned her favorite son.  General Scott had expressed\r\nhis willingness to run for Vice President if Clay should be nominated\r\nfor President, but the member of Congress who had been authorized\r\nto make this known kept it a secret.  Clay allowed his name to go\r\nbefore the Convention on the assurance of Governor Bebb that Ohio\r\nwould stand by him, but the delegation voted for Scott.  On the\r\nfirst ballot, even seven delegates from Kentucky voted for Taylor,\r\nand he was nominated by 171 votes, with 63 for Scott, and only 32\r\nfor Clay.  Of the votes for Taylor, on the first ballot, 97 were\r\ncast by States that had voted for Polk in 1844; and of the 94 Whig\r\ndelegates from the Free States he received the votes of only four.\r\nHe was nominated as the candidate of the Whigs who believed in the\r\nextension of slavery, by a Convention which repeatedly and\r\ncontemptuously voted down the Wilmot proviso, already endorsed by\r\nall the Whig Legislatures of the Free States, while no platform of\r\nprinciples was adopted; and Horace Greeley was thus perfectly\r\njustified in branding it as \"the slaughter-house of Whig principles.\"\r\nSuch an exhibition of shameless political prostitution has rarely\r\nbeen witnessed, and three of the leading Whigs of Massachusetts--\r\nCharles Allen, Henry Wilson, and Stephen C. Phillips--left the\r\nConvention in disgust, and severed their connection with the party\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nIn this state of the country, and of the old parties, a new\r\norganization and another nomination became inevitable.  The followers\r\nof Mr. Van Buren, in New York and other States, were aching for\r\nthe opportunity to make themselves felt in avenging the wrong done\r\nto their chief in 1844, and were quite ready to strike hands with\r\nthe members of the Liberty party.  The members of that party were\r\ngenerally ready to withdraw their candidate for President and unite\r\nwith the anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats of the Northern States,\r\nif an honorable basis of action could be agreed upon.  The \"Conscience\r\nWhigs\" of Massachusetts, and thousands of Whigs in other States,\r\nwho regarded the freedom of our Territories as a vital issue, and\r\nwere thoroughly soured by the nomination of General Taylor, were\r\nequally anxious to fuse with the other elements of political\r\ndiscontent, and make their voices heard in a new and independent\r\norganization.  There was little time for delay, and as soon as the\r\ntroubled political elements would permit, a call was issued for a\r\nNational Free Soil Convention, at Buffalo, on the 9th of August.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was historic.  It marked a new and significant\r\ndeparture in party politics, and was a conspicuous milestone in\r\nthe anti-slavery journey.  It met in a spacious pavilion, and was\r\none of the largest political gatherings ever assembled in the\r\ncountry, and animated by unbounded earnestness and enthusiasm.\r\nIts leading spirits were men of character and undisputed ability.\r\nThe \"Barnburners\" of New York were largely in attendance, including\r\nsuch veteran leaders as Preston King, Benjamin F. Butler, David\r\nDudley Field, Samuel J. Tilden, and James W. Nye.  Ohio sent a\r\nformidable force headed by Joshua R. Giddings, Salmon Chase, and\r\nSamuel Lewis.  The \"Conscience Whigs\" of Massachusetts were well\r\nrepresented, with Charles Francis Adams, Stephen C. Phillips, and\r\nFrancis W. Bird, in the front.  The Liberty party sent its delegates,\r\nincluding such men as the Rev. Joshua Leavitt, Samuel Lewis, and\r\nHenry B. Stanton.  The disappointed Clay Whigs were there, led by\r\nsuch representative men as Joseph L. White, who were eager to lay\r\nhold of any weapon by which they could hope to strike down the\r\nbetrayers of the Whig cause.  The \"Land Reformers\" and \"Workingmen\"\r\nof New York were represented, as also the special advocates of\r\n\"Cheap postage for the people,\" who longed to be rid of the tariff\r\nof twenty-five cents on the privilege of sending a single letter\r\nthrough the mails, and whose wishes afterward found expression in\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\nCould these elements be harmonized?  Could the bolters from the\r\nWhig party overcome their traditional hatred of Martin Van Buren?\r\nIf so, could the Liberty party men be prevailed upon to give up\r\ntheir chosen candidate, and labor for the election of the \"foxy\r\nold politician\" whose reputation for tricky and ambidextrous\r\npolitical methods had become proverbial?  If not, could the\r\nBarnburners, with their large following, be united on the candidate\r\nof the Liberty party, or some new man?  These questions had to be\r\nmet; but preliminary to the nomination was the construction of a\r\nplatform.  This was accomplished without serious difficulty, and,\r\nconsidering the circumstances of the country, it was perhaps the\r\nmost admirable declaration of principles ever promulgated by any\r\nparty.  It was chiefly the work of Mr. Chase, assisted by Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, Benjamin F. Butler, and others, and it declared,\r\namong its pregnant and telling sentences, that \"Congress has no\r\nmore power to make a slave than to make a king,\" and that \"it is\r\nthe duty of the Federal Government to relieve itself of all\r\nresponsibility for the existence or continuance of slavery wherever\r\nthat Government possesses authority to legislate and is thus\r\nresponsible for its existence.\"  The reading of these declarations\r\ncalled forth thunders of applause, while the last plank in the\r\nplatform \"resolved, that we inscribe on our banner free soil, free\r\nspeech, free labor, and free men, and under it we will fight on\r\nand fight ever, until a triumphant victory shall reward our\r\nexertions.\"\r\n\r\nThe nominating Convention assembled in the large Universalist Church\r\nin Buffalo.  Mr. Van Buren was not understood as desiring the\r\nnomination, but it was now authoritatively stated that he would\r\naccept it if tendered, and that he would, without hesitation or\r\nevasions, accept the platform of the Convention.  The different\r\nelements of this movement had been in conference, and the time for\r\naction was at hand.  In common with my Whig associates, I had all\r\nalong felt that I could not support Mr. Van Buren under any\r\ncircumstances; but the pervading tone of earnestness in the\r\nConvention, and the growing spirit of political fraternity, had\r\nmodified our views.  We saw that several of the great leaders of\r\nthe Liberty party were quite ready to meet the \"Barnburners\" on\r\ncommon ground.  It seemed very desirable to combine with so large\r\na body of helpers, and to profit by their experience and training\r\nin the school of practical politics.  Mr. Van Buren had certainly\r\ngone great lengths as the servant of the slave power, but there\r\nwas _one_ great and vital issue to freedom on which he had taken\r\nthe right side, and maintained it without flinching in the presence\r\nof a great temptation; and for this he had been anathematized by\r\nthe South, and driven into retirement.  If nominated by the anti-\r\nslavery men of the free States, and squarely committed to their\r\nprinciples, it was altogether improbable, if not morally impossible,\r\nthat he would again lend himself to the service of slavery.  Besides,\r\nthe whole country had been so demoralized by this evil that it was\r\nnot easy to find any public man of eminence whose record had been\r\nspotless; and it was a part of the work of earnest anti-slavery\r\nmen to forget party memories and prejudices for the sake of the\r\ncause, and to cultivate the virtues of hope and trust, rather than\r\nthe spirit of doubt and suspicion, in dealing with a man who was\r\nnow ready to unfurl the flag of freedom, and had been stricken down\r\nby her foes.  The nomination of Mr. Van Buren would undoubtedly\r\nmean the freedom of our Territories and the denationalization of\r\nslavery, and this was the great point.  In this movement there was\r\nno element of compromise.  It was wholly unhampered by a Southern\r\nwing; and even should the nominee betray the men who now trusted\r\nhim, their choice of him, as their standard bearer, would be\r\nvindicated by the circumstances of the hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase, then in the prime of his manhood, and a splendid figure,\r\nwas the president of this nominating Convention, and its work\r\nproceeded.  There was a feeling of intense anxiety about the result,\r\nand an earnestness and real seriousness which I have never witnessed\r\nin any other Convention.  There were leading Whigs and Liberty\r\nparty men, whose action in respect to Mr. Van Buren was not yet\r\ngenerally known.  Several delegates remarked, \"I want to know what\r\nSamuel Lewis will do before I decide,\" or, \"I want to hear from\r\nJoshua Leavitt.\"  After the nomination of Mr. Van Buren had been\r\nmoved, Mr. Leavitt rose from his seat, and all eyes were instantly\r\nturned upon him.  He was then in middle life, and his tall and\r\nerect form and fine physiognomy were singularly striking.  He was\r\nfull of emotion, and seemed at first to lack the power of utterance,\r\nwhile the stillness of death prevailed in the Convention.  He began\r\nby saying:  \"Mr. Chairman, this is the most solemn experience of\r\nmy life.  I feel as if in the immediate presence of the Divine\r\nSpirit.\"  He paused here for a few moments, while there did not\r\nseem to be a dry eye in the Convention; but he proceeded grandly\r\nwith his speech, defined his position, and seconded the motion for\r\nMr. Van Buren's nomination, upon which the mingled political\r\nenthusiasm and religious fervor of the Convention broke over all\r\nbounds, and utterly defied description.  Men laughed and cried at\r\nthe same time, and gave themselves up to the perfect abandon of\r\ntheir feelings.  All divisions had completely died away, and the\r\nnomination of Mr. Van Buren by acclamation became a matter of\r\ncourse.  Charles Francis Adams was then nominated for Vice President,\r\nwhen the Convention adjourned, and its members returned to their\r\nhomes to prepare for the coming canvass under the banner of \"Van\r\nBuren and Free Soil--Adams and Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe new national party was now launched, and the work of the\r\npresidential canvass began in earnest.  John A. Dix, then one of\r\nthe United States Senators from New York, was nominated for Governor,\r\nwith Seth M. Gates, the anti-slavery colleague of Adams and Giddings\r\nin Congress, for Lieutenant-Governor.  The Free Soil State Convention\r\nof Ohio set the ball in motion in that State, and the new party,\r\nby securing the balance of power in the Legislature, was able to\r\nplace Mr. Chase in the Senate of the United States.  Stephen C.\r\nPhillips was nominated for Governor in Massachusetts, where the\r\nmovement was very formidable, and exceedingly annoying to the\r\n\"Cotton Whigs.\"  Like conventions were held in Indiana and other\r\nfree States, organizations effected, and candidates nominated,\r\nwhile the movement extended to the border slave states, in which\r\nit afterward did excellent service.  The canvass of the Democrats\r\nwas not remarkably enthusiastic.  The division of the party and\r\nthe probable loss of the State of New York had a very depressing\r\ninfluence.  The Whig canvass was perhaps marked by still less\r\nearnestness and spirit.  It was hollow and false, and the best men\r\nin the party felt it.  The only enthusiasm of the campaign was in\r\nthe new party, and it was perfectly spontaneous and fervid.  The\r\nmost remarkable feature of this contest was the bitterness of the\r\nWhigs toward the Free Soilers, and especially those who had deserted\r\nfrom the Whig ranks.  They seemed to be maddened by the imputation\r\nthat they were not perfectly sound on the Free Soil issue.  This\r\nwas particularly true of Mr. Webster, who had been branded by Mr.\r\nAdams as a \"Traitor to freedom,\" as far back as the year 1843, and\r\nwho afterward justified these strong words in his \"Seventh of March\r\nSpeech.\"  In the Whig State Convention of Massachusetts, held at\r\nSpringfield, in 1847, Mr. Webster, speaking of the Wilmot proviso,\r\nhad said:  \"Did I not commit myself to that in the year 1838, fully,\r\nentirely?  I do not consent that more recent discoverers shall take\r\nout a patent for the discovery.  Allow me to say, sir, it is not\r\ntheir thunder.\"  He then claimed Free Soil as a distinctive Whig\r\ndoctrine, and in a speech at Abingdon, he now said:  \"The gentlemen\r\nwho have joined this new party, from among the Whigs, pretend that\r\nthey are greater lovers of liberty and greater haters of slavery\r\nthan those they leave behind them.  I do not admit it.  I do not\r\nadmit any such thing.  I think we are as good Free Soil men as they\r\nare.\"  The same ground was urged by Washington Hunt, James Brooks,\r\nand other leading Whigs; and Mr. Greeley declared that \"at no time\r\npreviously had Whig inculcations throughout the free States been\r\nso decidedly and strongly hostile to the extension of slavery, and\r\nso determined in requiring its inhibition by Congress, as during\r\nthe canvass of 1848.\"  These statements appear very remarkable,\r\nwhen it is remembered that the Whig nominee was a Louisiana planter,\r\nand that he was nominated at the bidding of the slave-holding wing\r\nof the party, and by a convention which not only contemptuously\r\nvoted down the Wilmot proviso, but treated its advocates as\r\n\"fanatics.\"  But even Governor Seward strangely clung to the old\r\nparty after the death and burial of its conscience, and seriously\r\nbrought his personal integrity into question by urging the support\r\nof General Taylor upon those who favored the abolition of slavery.\r\nIn a speech at Cleveland, Ohio, in October of that year, he said:\r\n\"Freedom insists on the emancipation and development of labor;\r\nslavery demands a soil moistened with tears and blood--freedom a\r\nsoil that exults under the elastic tread of man in his native\r\nmajesty.  These elements divide and classify the American people\r\ninto two parties,\" and he proceeded to argue as if the Whigs and\r\nDemocrats were thus divided, when he knew that both were in the\r\nabsolute control of the slave power.\r\n\r\nThe Free Soilers, of course, did not particularly relish these\r\nmoral lectures on slavery by men who had sold their principles at\r\npublic auction for the chance of office and plunder through the\r\nelevation of a mere military chieftain to the Presidency.  But the\r\nWhigs were not content with claiming the complete monopoly of anti-\r\nslavery virtue, and parading it before the country; they became\r\nabusive and insulting to the full measure of their insincerity.\r\nTheir talk about \"renegades\" and \"apostates\" anticipated the abuse\r\nheaped upon the Greeley men of 1872, when the Republican party had\r\nso completely triumphed over the integrity of its earlier life.\r\nThe course of the Whigs in Indiana supplies a striking illustration.\r\nAfter the presidential election of 1844, I resolved that I would\r\nnever vote for another slaveholder, and the course of events and\r\nmy own reflections had constantly strengthened this purpose.  I\r\nsaw no honorable way of escape, and my position was well known to\r\nmy Whig brethren; but, as soon as General Taylor was nominated,\r\nthe policy of browbeating and threats was invoked.  I had no taste\r\nfor politics, and had determined to devote myself entirely to my\r\nprofession.  I was especially anxious to avoid any strife with the\r\nWhigs, who were overwhelmingly in the ascendant in Eastern Indiana,\r\nand in whose ranks were most of my clients and best friends.  But\r\nthe party leaders talked to me in the imperative mood.  They saw\r\nmy embarrassment, and seemed determined to coerce me into submission\r\nby the supposed extremity of my situation; and I was obliged to\r\noffer them open defiance.  I was made an elector for Van Buren and\r\nAdams in the Fourth Indiana District, and entered upon the contest\r\nwith a will; and from that time forth I was subjected to a torrent\r\nof billingsgate which rivalled the fish market.  Words were neither\r\nminced nor mollified, but made the vehicles of political wrath and\r\nthe explosions of personal malice.  The charge of \"abolitionism\"\r\nwas flung at me everywhere, and it is impossible now to realize\r\nthe odium then attaching to that term by the general opinion.  I\r\nwas an \"amalgamationist\" and a \"woolly-head.\"  I was branded as\r\nthe \"apostle of disunion\" and \"the orator of free-dirt.\"  It was\r\na standing charge of the Whigs that I carried in my pocket a lock\r\nof the hair of Frederick Douglass, to regale my senses with its\r\naroma when I grew faint.  They declared that my audiences consisted\r\nof \"eleven men, three boys, and a negro,\" and sometimes I could\r\nnot deny this inventory was not very far from the truth.  I was\r\nthreatened with mob violence by my own neighbors, and treated as\r\nif slavery had been an established institution of the State, with\r\nits machinery of overseers and background of pauperized whites;\r\nwhile these same Whigs, as if utterly unconscious of the irony of\r\ntheir professions, uniformly resolved, in their conventions, that\r\n\"the Whig party is the only true Free Soil party.\"\r\n\r\nI was not, of course, a non-resistant in the warfare, and for two\r\nmonths I gave myself up to the work absolutely.  I was seriously\r\nembarrassed in the outset by the question of transportation, having\r\nneither horse nor carriage, nor the financial ability to procure\r\neither; but an anti-slavery Quaker, and personal friend, named\r\nJonathan Macy, came to my rescue.  He furnished me an old white\r\nhorse, fully seventeen hands high, and rather thin in flesh, but\r\nwhich served my purpose pretty well.  I named him \"Old Whitey,\" in\r\nhonor of General Taylor's famous war steed, and sallied forth in\r\nthe work of the campaign.  Having a first-class pair of lungs and\r\nmuch physical endurance, I frequently spoke as often as three times\r\na day, and generally from two to three hours at each meeting.  I\r\nspoke at cross-roads, in barns, in pork houses, in saw-mills, in\r\nany place in which a few or many people would hear me; but I was\r\nrarely permitted to enter any of the churches.  I was so perfectly\r\nswallowed up in my work and dominated by the singleness of my\r\npurpose, that I took no thought of anything else; and the vigor of\r\nmy invective in dealing with the scurrilous attacks of my assailants\r\nwas very keenly realized, and, I believe, universally acknowledged.\r\nWith the truth on my side, I was delighted to find myself perfectly\r\nable, single-handed, to fight my battle against the advantages of\r\nsuperior talent and the trained leadership of men of established\r\nreputations on the stump.  But the fight, as I have said, was\r\nunspeakably relentless, vitriolic and exhausting, and nothing could\r\nredeem it but an overmastering sense of duty and self-respect.\r\nThe worst passions of humanity were set on fire among the Whigs by\r\nthis provoking insurrection against their party as the mere tool\r\nof slavery, while animosities were engendered that still survive,\r\nand which many men have carried to their graves.  This is only a\r\nsingle illustration of the spirit of the canvass, for similar\r\nconflicts marked the struggle in Ohio, Massachusetts and other\r\nStates, and they were made inevitable by the desperation of a party\r\nalready dead in its trespasses, and which deserved a funeral instead\r\nof a triumph.\r\n\r\nThe results of this contest were most remarkable.  General Taylor\r\nwas elected but his triumph was the death of the Whig party.  The\r\nlong-coveted prize of the presidency was snatched from General\r\nCass, and the Democratic party divided and humiliated by its struggle\r\nto serve two masters, while the friends of Mr. Van Buren had their\r\nlonged-for revenge.  The Free Soil ticket received a little less\r\nthan three hundred thousand votes, and failed to carry the electoral\r\nvote of a single State; but the effect of the movement was inestimably\r\nimportant.  It seated Chase in the United States Senate from Ohio,\r\nand sent to the lower branch of Congress a sufficient number of\r\nanti-slavery men from different States to hold the balance of power\r\nin that body.  It was very savingly felt in Congress in July of\r\nthis year, on the vote by which Oregon, with a territory nearly\r\nequal to that of the thirteen original States, narrowly escaped\r\nthe damnation of slavery.  It emphasized the demand of the million\r\nfor \"cheap postage,\" and the freedom of the public domain, and thus\r\nhelped stereotype these great measures into law; and it played its\r\npart in creating the public opinion which compelled the admission\r\nof California as a free State.  These were great achievements, but\r\nthey were mere preliminaries to the magnificent and far-reaching\r\nwork of succeeding years, of which the revolt of 1848 was the\r\npromise and pledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nREMINISCENCES OF THE THIRTY-FIRST CONGRESS.\r\nNovel political complications--The Compromise Measures--First\r\nelection to Congress--Sketch of the \"immortal nine\"--The speakership\r\nand Wm. J. Brown--Gen. Taylor and the Wilmot proviso--Slave-holding\r\nbanter--Compromise resolutions of Clay, and retreat of Northern\r\nWhigs--Visit to Gen. Taylor--To Mr. Clay--His speeches--Webster's\r\nseventh of March speech--Character of Calhoun--Speech on the slavery\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of \"pacification\" and \"final settlement,\" which was\r\nlaunched in 1850, under the leadership of Henry Clay, constitutes\r\none of the chief landmarks in the history of the great conflict\r\nbetween freedom and slavery.  It was the futile attempt of legislative\r\ndiplomacy to escape the fatal logic of antecedent facts.  The war\r\nwith Mexico, like the annexation of Texas which paved the way for\r\nit, was inspired by the lust for slave territory.  No sophistry\r\ncould disguise this fact, nor could its significance be overstated.\r\nThe prophets of slavery saw clearly that restriction meant destruction.\r\nThey girded themselves for battle on this issue, and were not at\r\nall placated by Northern disclaimers of \"abolitionism,\" and reiterated\r\ndisavowals of any right or purpose to intermeddle with slavery as\r\nthe creature of State law.  Its existence was menaced by the policy\r\nof confinement and ultimate suffocation; and therefore no compromise\r\nof the pending strife over its prohibition in New Mexico, Utah and\r\nCalifornia was possible.\r\n\r\nThis strife was aggravated by its peculiar relations to the dominant\r\npolitical parties.  The sacrifice of Martin Van Buren in 1844,\r\nbecause of his manly letter on the annexation of Texas, had been\r\na sore trial to his devoted friends.  They could neither forgive\r\nnor forget it; and when the opportunity for revenge finally came\r\nin 1848, they laid hold of it with the sincerest and most heartfelt\r\nsatisfaction.  As we have seen, they bolted from their party, threw\r\nthemselves into the Free Soil movement, and thus made the defeat\r\nof Gen. Cass inevitable by the election of Gen. Taylor.  Thousands\r\nof these bolting Democrats, particularly in the State of New York,\r\ncared more for the personal and political fortunes of Mr. Van Buren\r\nthan for the slavery question, as their subsequent return to their\r\nparty allegiance made manifest; but their action was none the less\r\ndecisive in the emergency which called it forth.  The trouble in\r\nthe Whig camp was also serious.  The last hopes of Mr. Clay and\r\nhis worshipers had perished forever in the nomination of the hero\r\nof the Mexican war and the owner of two hundred slaves, by a\r\nConvention which became famous as \"the slaughter house of Whig\r\nprinciples.\"  Very many of these Clay Whigs, like the devotees of\r\nMr. Van Buren, would have been satisfied with almost any dispensation\r\nof the slavery issue if their chief had been nominated, but they\r\nwere now enlisted in the anti-slavery army, and, like Joseph L.\r\nWhite, of Indiana, vociferously shouted for \"liberty and revenge.\"\r\nMr. Webster and his friends were also profoundly disgusted, and\r\nlent a strong hand to the work of party insubordination, while the\r\nelection of Gen. Taylor was quite naturally followed by formidable\r\nparty coalitions.  One of these, as already stated, made Salmon P.\r\nChase a senator of the United States from Ohio, as John P. Hale\r\nhad been chosen from New Hampshire some time before, and Charles\r\nSumner came in a little later from Massachusetts; and the House of\r\nRepresentatives now contained nine distinctly anti-slavery men,\r\nchosen from different States by kindred combinations, who had\r\ncompletely renounced their allegiance to the old parties, and were\r\nable to wield the balance of power in that body.  Such were the\r\ncomplications of the great problem which confronted the Thirty-\r\nfirst Congress at the opening of its first session, on the third\r\nday of December, 1849.\r\n\r\nIn this Congress I was a representative, for the first time, of\r\nthe Fourth Indiana District.  This district contained a large Quaker\r\npopulation, and in the matter of liberality and progress was in\r\nadvance of all other portions of the State; and yet the immeasurable\r\nwrath and scorn which were lavished upon the men who deserted the\r\nWhig party on account of the nomination of General Taylor can\r\nscarcely be conceived.  The friends of a life-time were suddenly\r\nturned to enemies, and their words were often dipped in venom.  It\r\nseemed as if a section of Kentucky or Virginia had in some way\r\nusurped the geography of Eastern Indiana, bringing with it the\r\ndiscipline of the slave-master, and a considerable importation of\r\n\"white trash.\"  The contest was bitter beyond all precedent; but\r\nafter a hard fight, and by a union of Free Soilers, Democrats, and\r\nIndependent Whigs, I was elected by a small majority.  Owing to\r\nserious illness, resulting from the excitement and overwork of the\r\ncanvass, I did not reach Washington till the 19th of December--just\r\nin time to cast my vote for speaker on the fifty-sixth ballot in\r\nthis first important \"dead-lock\" in the organization of the House.\r\nWith the exception of two Indiana members, I had no personal\r\nacquaintance in either branch of Congress, and, on entering the\r\nold Hall of Representatives, my first thought was to find the Free\r\nSoil members, whose political fortunes and experience had been so\r\nsimilar to my own.  The seat of Mr. Giddings was pointed out to me\r\nin the northwest corner of the Hall, where I found the stalwart\r\nchampion of free speech busy with his pen.  He received me with\r\nevident cordiality, and at once sent a page for the other Free Soil\r\nmembers.  Soon the \"immortal nine,\" as we were often sportively\r\nstyled, were all together:  David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, then\r\nfamous as the author of the \"Provsio,\" short and corpulent in\r\nperson, and emphatic in speech; Preston King, of New York, with\r\nhis still more remarkable rotundity of belt, and a face beaming\r\nwith good humor; the eccentric and witty \"Jo Root,\" of Ohio, always\r\nready to break a lance with the slave-holders; Charles Allen, of\r\nMassachusetts, the quiet, dignified, clear-headed and genial\r\ngentleman, but a good fighter and the unflinching enemy of slavery;\r\nCharles Durkee, of Wisconsin, the fine-looking and large-hearted\r\nphilanthropist, whose enthusiasm never cooled; Amos Tuck, of New\r\nHampshire, amiable and somewhat feminine in appearance, but firm\r\nin purpose; John W. Howe, of Pennsylvania, with a face radiant with\r\nsmiles and good will, and full of anti-slavery fervor; and Joshua\r\nR. Giddings, of Ohio, with his broad shoulders, giant frame,\r\nunquenchable love of freedom, and almost as familiar with the\r\nslavery question, in all its aspects, as he was with the alphabet.\r\nThese, all now gone to their reckoning, were the elect of freedom\r\nin the lower branch of this memorable Congress.  They all greeted\r\nme warmly, and the more so, perhaps, because my reported illness\r\nand doubtful recovery had awakened a peculiar interest in my fortunes\r\nat that time, on account of the political situation, and the possible\r\nsignificance of a single vote.  John P. Hale happened to enter the\r\nhall during these congratulations, and still further lighted up\r\nthe scene by his jolly presence; while Dr. Bailey, of the \"National\r\nEra,\" also joined in the general welcome, and at once confirmed\r\nall the good opinions I had formed of this courageous and single-\r\nminded friend of the slave.  I was delighted with all my brethren,\r\nand at once entered fully into their plans and counsels.\r\n\r\nAn incident connected with the organization of the House, which\r\ncaused intense excitement at the time, seems to deserve some notice.\r\nIt occurred on the 12th of December, while William J. Brown, of\r\nIndiana, was being voted for as the Democratic candidate for Speaker.\r\nHe was a pro-slavery Democrat, through and through, and commanded\r\nthe entire and unhesitating confidence of Southern members; and\r\nyet, on the last ballot for him, he received the votes of Allen,\r\nDurkee, Giddings, King, and Wilmot, and came within two votes of\r\nan election.  The support of Mr. Brown by the leading Free Soilers\r\nwas a great surprise to both sides of the House, and the suspicion\r\nthat some secret arrangement had been made gave birth to a rumor\r\nto that effect.  After the balloting, while Mr. Bailey, of Virginia,\r\nwas on the floor, Mr. Ashmun, of Massachusetts, asked him whether\r\na secret correspondence had not taken place between some member of\r\nthe Free Soil party and Mr. Brown, by which the latter had agreed\r\nto constitute the Committees on the Judiciary, on Territories, and\r\non the District of Columbia, in a manner satisfactory to that party.\r\nMr. Bailey scouted the idea, and asked Mr. Ashmun what authority\r\nhe had for the statement.  Mr. Ashmun replied, \"Common rumor\"; to\r\nwhich Mr. Bailey rejoined, \"Does not the gentleman know that common\r\nrumor is a common liar?\"  Turning to Mr. Brown, he said, \"Has any\r\nsuch correspondence taken place?\"  Mr. Brown shook his head, and\r\nMr. Bailey became more emphatic than ever in his denial.  But the\r\nfever was now up, and the Southern members scented treason.  Several\r\nof them withheld their votes from Mr. Brown because of his Free\r\nSoil support, and thus prevented his election.  He was in a very\r\ntrying dilemma with his Southern friends, while the Free Soilers\r\nwho had supported him were also placed in a novel predicament, and\r\nsubjected to catechism.  The fact was finally revealed in the course\r\nof a long and exciting debate, that Mr. Wilmot _had_ entered into\r\na correspondence with Mr. Brown on the subject of the organization\r\nof the Committees named, and that the latter _had_ promised in\r\nwriting to constitute them as stated in Mr. Ashumn's inquiry--\r\ndeclaring that he had \"always been opposed to the extension of\r\nslavery,\" and believed that \"the Federal Government should be\r\nrelieved from the responsibility of slavery where it had the\r\nconstitutional right to abolish it.\"  This, in substance, was the\r\nwhole Free Soil gospel; and the disappointment and rage of Southern\r\nmembers, when the letter was produced, can be more easily imagined\r\nthan described.  Mr. Brown labored very painfully to explain his\r\nletter and pacify his Southern friends, but the effort was utterly\r\nvain.  He was branded with treachery and duplicity by Bailey,\r\nHarris, Burt, Venable, Stanton, and McMullen, while no man from\r\nthe South pretended to excuse him.  In the midst of great excitement\r\nhe withdrew from the contest for Speaker, and the catastrophe of\r\nhis secret maneuver was so unspeakably humiliating that even his\r\nenemies pitied him.  But he was unjustly dealt with by his Southern\r\nbrethren, whose fear of betrayal and morbid sensitiveness made all\r\ncoolness of judgment impossible.  While he possessed very social\r\nand kindly personal traits of character, no man in this Congress\r\nwas more inflexibly true to slavery, as his subsequent career amply\r\ndemonstrated.  If he had been chosen Speaker he would doubtless\r\nhave placed some of the Free Soil members on the Committees specified,\r\nbut the whole power of his office would have been studiously\r\nsubservient to the behests of the slave oligarchy; and nothing\r\ncould excuse the conduct of Mr. Wilmot and his associates but their\r\nentire ignorance of his political character and antecedents.  I\r\nregretted this affair most sincerely, for I knew Mr. Brown well,\r\nand could undoubtedly have prevented the negotiation if I had been\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe Speakership was obviously the first question on which the slave\r\npower must be met in the Thirty-first Congress.  No question could\r\nmore completely have presented the entire controversy between the\r\nfree and slave States which had so stirred the country during the\r\nprevious eighteen months.  In view of the well-nigh autocratic\r\npower of the Speaker over legislative measures, no honest Free\r\nSoiler could vote for a candidate who was not known to be sound on\r\nthe great issue.  We could not support Howell Cobb, of Georgia,\r\nthe nominee of the Democratic party, however anxious our Democratic\r\nconstituents might be to have us do so; nor could we vote for Robert\r\nC. Winthrop, of Massachusetts, to please the Whigs and semi-Free\r\nSoilers who affiliated with them, since Giddings, Palfrey and others\r\nhad demonstrated that he was wholly untrustworthy in facing the\r\nragged issue of slavery.  This had been proved by his acts as\r\nSpeaker in the preceding Congress.  We therefore united in the\r\ndetermination to vote for neither of these candidates.  The contest\r\nwas protracted till December 22d, when, on the sixty third ballot,\r\nMr. Cobb was chosen.  The result was effected, by adopting, at the\r\ninstigation of the Whigs, what was called the \"plurality rule,\"\r\nthe operation of which enabled a minority to choose the speaker.\r\nThe Whigs, when they entered upon this proceeding, well knew that\r\nthe Free Soilers were willing and anxious to vote for Thaddeus\r\nStevens, or any other reliable member of the party.  They well knew\r\nthat none of us would vote for Mr. Winthrop, under any circumstances,\r\nand for excellent reasons which we had announced.  Further, they\r\nwell knew that without Free Soil votes Mr. Cobb would certainly be\r\nchosen; and yet the angry cry went up from the Whigs in Congress\r\nand throughout the Northern States that the Free Soilers had elected\r\na slave-holder to be speaker of the House!  For a time the ridiculous\r\ncharge served the purpose of its authors, but the subsequent career\r\nof Mr. Winthrop finally and entirely vindicated the sagacity of\r\nthe men whose resolute opposition had thwarted his ambition.\r\n\r\nIn the further organization of the House Mr. Campbell, a Tennessee\r\nslave-holder, was chosen clerk on the twentieth ballot, by the help\r\nof Southern Democrats, over John W. Forney, who was then the\r\nparticular friend of James Buchanan, and who had made himself so\r\nconspicuous by his abuse of anti-slavery men that the Free Soil\r\nmembers could not give him their support.  On the eighth ballot\r\nMr. Glossbrenner, of Pennsylvania, the nominee of the Democrats,\r\nwas chosen sergeant-at-arms, and after fourteen ineffectual ballots\r\nfor doorkeeper, Mr. Horner, the Whig incumbent in the preceding\r\nCongress, was continued by resolution of the House.  This was on\r\nJanuary 18th, and the organization of the House was not yet completed,\r\nbut further proceedings in this direction were now postponed till\r\nthe first of March.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the slavery question had been receiving daily\r\nattention.  The strife over the Speakership had necessarily involved\r\nit, and constantly provoked its animated discussion.  The great\r\nissue was the Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories,\r\nthen popularly known as the \"Wilmot proviso\"; and the first vote\r\non it was taken December 31st, upon the motion to lay on the table\r\nMr. Root's resolution which embodied it.  The yeas were 83, nays\r\n101; being a majority of only 18 in its favor.  The Southern men\r\nseemed to gather hope and courage from this vote.  On January 4th,\r\nthe President sent in his special message relative to California\r\nand New Mexico, announcing his famous \"Non-action\" policy, which\r\nwas simply another name for the \"Non-intervention\" dogma of Gen.\r\nCass.  A year before he had declared that the new Territories must\r\nnot be \"surrendered to the pistol and the bowie-knife\"; but a new\r\nlight now dawned upon him, and he advised Congress to leave the\r\nTerritories to themselves till their people should be prepared to\r\nask admission into the Union as States.  He talked glibly about\r\n\"geographical parties\" and the \"operation of natural causes\" as\r\nany trained Whig politician, and seemed to have totally forgotten\r\nhis repeated pledges not to interfere with the action of Congress\r\nrespecting \"domestic questions.\"  While the hand of the Executive\r\nwas thus at work, extreme men in both Houses led the way in violent\r\nand inflammatory speeches.  \"When we ask for justice, and to be\r\nlet alone,\" said Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina, \"we are met by\r\nthe senseless and insane cry of Union, Union!  Sir, I am disgusted\r\nwith it.  When it comes from Northern gentlemen who are attacking\r\nus, it falls on my ear as it would do if a band of robbers had\r\nsurrounded a dwelling, and when the inmates attempted to resist,\r\nthe assailants should raise the cry of peace, union, harmony!\"  He\r\ngave out the threat, that unless the slave-holders were allowed to\r\nextend their system over the virgin soil of our Territories, they\r\nwould block the wheels of Government, and involve the nation in\r\nthe horrors of civil war.  He charged that the free States \"keep\r\nup and foster in the bosoms Abolition Societies, whose main purpose\r\nis to scatter fire-brands throughout the South, to incite servile\r\ninsurrections, and stimulate by licentious pictures our negroes to\r\ninvade the persons of our white women.\"  Mr. Brown, of Mississippi,\r\nsaid he regarded slavery \"as a great moral, social and _religious_\r\nblessing,--a blessing to the slave, and a blessing to the master.\"\r\nHe graciously admitted that Northern people thought slavery an\r\nevil; but he added, \"Very well, think so; _but keep your thoughts\r\nto yourselves_.\"  Jefferson Davis, then as ever afterward, the\r\napostle of disunion, declared that \"slavery existed in the tents\r\nof the patriarchs, and in the households of His own chosen people\";\r\nthat \"it was established by the decree of Almighty God,\" and\r\n\"sanctioned in the Bible--in both Testaments--from Genesis to\r\nRevelations.\"  Southern members pointed to the battle-fields of\r\nthe Revolution, and warned the people of the free States to beware;\r\nwhile the menace was uttered that if the representatives of the\r\nNorthern States should vote California into the Union as a free\r\nState, without some compensating measures to the South, their\r\nnumbers would be decimated by violence.  Mr. Toombs, in referring\r\nto the exclusion of slavery from the common territory, said \"I will\r\nthen, if I can, bring my children and my constituents to the altar\r\nof liberty, and like Hamilcar, I will swear them to eternal hostility\r\nto your foul domination.\"  On January 29th, Mr. Clay introduced\r\nhis eight resolutions of compromise, which still further weakened\r\nthe anti-slavery policy of Northern Whigs; and when, on February\r\n4th, another vote was taken on the Wilmot proviso, it was laid on\r\nthe table by yeas 104, noes 75;--showing a majority of 29, and a\r\nchange of 47 votes in a little more than one month!  Thus began\r\nthe sickening career of political apostacy, which so gathered\r\nmomentum during the spring and summer months that it became impossible\r\nto admit the free State of California into the Union until the\r\npassage of the Texas Boundary Bill and the new Fugitive Slave Act\r\nhad been made certain.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session I called on President Taylor with Mr. Giddings\r\nand Judge Allen.  I had a very strong curiosity to see the man\r\nwhose name I had used so freely in two exasperating political\r\ncampaigns, and desired to stand corrected in my estimate of his\r\ncharacter, if I should find such correction to be demanded by the\r\ntruth.  Our interview with the old soldier was exceedingly interesting\r\nand amusing.  I decidedly liked his kindly, honest, farmer-like\r\nface, and his old-fashioned simplicity of dress and manners.  His\r\nconversation was awkward and labored, and evinced a lack of self-\r\npossession; while his whole demeanor suggested his frontier life,\r\nand that he had reached a position for which he was singularly\r\nunfitted by training and experience, or any natural aptitude.  In\r\nthe few remarks he addressed to me about farming in the West, he\r\ngreatly amused us by saying, \"I would like to visit Indiana, and\r\nsee your plows, hoes--and other reaping implements\"; failing, as\r\nhe often did, to find the word he wanted.  He frequently mispronounced\r\nhis words, hesitated and stammered, and sometimes made a breakdown\r\nin the middle of a sentence.  But although he seemed to be in the\r\nhands of the slave-holders, and was about to proclaim his policy\r\nof non-intervention with slavery in the Territories, he impressed\r\nme as being personally honest and patriotic.  In this impression\r\nI was fully confirmed later in the session, when he sorrowfully\r\nbut manfully resisted the attempt of Senator Davis, his son-in-law,\r\nand other extreme men, to bully him into their measures, and avowed\r\nhis sympathy with the anti-slavery sentiment of the country.  I\r\nbelieve his dying words in July, \"I have tried to do my duty,\" were\r\nthe key-note of his life, and that in the Presidential campaign of\r\n1848, I did him much, though unintentional, injustice.\r\n\r\nIt was about the same time that I called with other Western members\r\nto see Mr. Clay, at the National Hotel.  He received us with the\r\nmost gracious cordiality, and perfectly captivated us all by the\r\npeculiar and proverbial charm of his manners and conversation.  I\r\nremember nothing like it in the social intercourse of my life.\r\nOne of our party was Hon. L. D. Campbell, then a prominent Whig\r\npolitician of Ohio, and an old friend of Mr. Clay, who seemed\r\nanxious to explain his action in supporting Gen. Scott in the\r\nNational Convention of 1848.  He failed to satisfy Mr. Clay, whose\r\neye kindled during the conversation, and who had desired and counted\r\non the nomination himself.  Mr. Clay, addressing him, but turning\r\nto me, said:  \"I can readily understand the position of our friend\r\nfrom Indiana, whose strong opinions on the slavery question governed\r\nhis action; but your position was different, and, besides, General\r\nScott had no chance for the nomination, and you were under no\r\nobligation to support him.\"  He spoke in kindly terms of the Free\r\nSoil men; said they acted consistently in supporting Van Buren in\r\npreference to Taylor, and that the election of the latter would\r\nprove the ruin of the Whigs.  I heard Mr. Clay's great speech in\r\nthe Senate on the Compromise Measures, and although I believed him\r\nto be radically wrong, I felt myself at times drawn toward him by\r\nthat peculiar spell which years before had bound me to him as my\r\nidolized political leader.  I witnessed his principal encounters\r\nwith Col. Benton during this session, in which I thought the latter\r\nhad the better of the argument; but his reply to Mr. Barnwell, of\r\nSouth Carolina, on July 22d, in which he said:  \"I owe a paramount\r\nallegiance to the whole Union, a subordinate one to my State,\" and\r\ndenounced the treasonable utterances of Mr. Rhett, was altogether\r\ninimitable and unsurpassed.  In the same speech he showed as little\r\nquarter to the Abolitionists.  Turning to Mr. Hale, he said, \"They\r\nlive by agitation.  It is their meat, their bread, the air which\r\nthey breathe; and if they saw in its incipient state, a measure\r\ngiving them more of that food, and meat, and bread, and air, do\r\nyou believe they would oppose themselves to its adoption?  Do you\r\nnot believe that they would _hail_ [Hale] it as a blessing? * * *\r\nThey see their doom as certain as there is a God in heaven, who\r\nsends his providential dispensations to calm the threatening storm,\r\nand to tranquilize agitated men.  As certain as God exists in\r\nheaven, your business, your vocation, is gone.\"  His devotion to\r\nthe Union was his ruling passion, and in one of his numerous speeches\r\nduring this session he held up a fragment of Washington's coffin,\r\nand with much dramatic effect pleaded for reconciliation and peace\r\nbetween the warring sections.\r\n\r\nHis scheme of compromise, or \"omnibus bill,\" was the darling child\r\nof his political ambition and old age; and when, after lovingly\r\nnursing it and gallantly fighting for it through seven or eight\r\nweary months, he saw it cruelly dismembered on July 31st, and his\r\nsovereign remedy for our national troubles insulted by the separate\r\npassage of the bill providing a Territorial Government for Utah,\r\nI could not help feeling a profound personal sympathy with him.\r\nBeaten at last on every point, deserted by some senators in whom\r\nhe had trusted implicitly, crushed and exhausted by labors which\r\nfew young and vigorous men could have endured, he bowed to the\r\ninevitable, and retired from the Senate Chamber.  But in the next\r\nmorning, prior to his departure for the sea-shore, he was in his\r\nseat; and with lightning in his eye, and figure erect as ever, he\r\npaid his respects to the men whose work of political havoc he\r\ndeplored.  His impassioned arraignment of the disunionists was\r\nloudly applauded by the galleries, and clearly indicated the part\r\nhe would have played in the late Rebellion had his life been spared\r\nto witness that direful event.  \"So long,\" said he, \"as it pleases\r\nGod to give me a voice to express my sentiments, or an arm, weak\r\nand enfeebled as it may be by age, that voice and that arm will be\r\non the side of my country, for the support of the general authority,\r\nand for the maintenance of the powers of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the famous \"Seventh of March Speech\" of Mr. Webster.  To\r\nme his oratory was a perfect surprise and curiosity.  He not only\r\nspoke with very unusual deliberation, but with pauses having no\r\nrelation whatever to the sense.  His sentences were broken into\r\nthe oddest fragments, and the hearer was perplexed in the endeavor\r\nto gather his meaning.  In declaring, for example, that he \"would\r\nput in no Wilmot proviso for the purpose of a taunt,\" etc., he made\r\na long pause at \"Wilmot,\" perhaps half a minute, and finally, having\r\napparently recovered his breath, added the word \"proviso\"; and\r\nthen, after another considerable pause, went on with his sentence.\r\nHis speaking seemed painfully laborious.  Great drops of perspiration\r\nstood upon his forehead and face, notwithstanding the slowness of\r\nhis utterance, suggesting, as a possible explanation, a very recent\r\nand heavy dinner, or a greatly troubled conscience over his final\r\nact of apostasy from his early New England faith.  The latter was\r\nprobably the truth, since he is known to have long and seriously\r\npondered the question of his ultimate decision; and with his\r\nnaturally great and noble traits of character he could not have\r\nannounced it without manifest tokens of uneasiness.  I was greatly\r\ninterested in the brief dialogue between him and Mr. Calhoun, which\r\nfollowed this speech.  Reference was made to their famous passage-\r\nat-arms twenty years before; and Mr. Calhoun, while taking exception\r\nto some of Mr. Webster's positions, congratulated him on his strong\r\ndeliverance in the interest of slavery.  The great Carolinian was\r\nthen wrestling with the disease which soon afterward terminated\r\nhis life, and was thin, pale, and feeble of step; but his singularly\r\nintellectual face, and the peculiar light which flashed from his\r\neye while speaking, made him the most strikingly picturesque figure\r\nin the Senate.  No man can compute the evils wrought by his political\r\ntheories; but in private life he was thoroughly upright and pure,\r\nand no suspicion of political jobbery was ever whispered in connection\r\nwith his name.  In his social relations he was most genial and\r\nkindly, while he always welcomed the society of young men who sought\r\nthe aid of his friendly counsel.  Politically, he has been singularly\r\nmisunderstood.  He was not, as has been so generally thought, a\r\ndisunionist.  He was the champion of State Sovereignty, but he\r\nbelieved that this was the sure basis and bond of Union.  He thought\r\nthe right of State nullification, if recognized, would hold the\r\ncentral power in check, and thus cement the Union; while his devotion\r\nto African slavery as a defensible form of society, and a solution\r\nof the conflict between capital and labor, was doubtless as sincere\r\nas it was fanciful.\r\n\r\nDuring the first months of this session my spare time was devoted\r\nto the preparation of a speech on the slavery question.  My\r\nconstituents expected this, and so did my anti-slavery and Free\r\nSoil friends generally.  It was my darling purpose, and I resolved\r\nto do my best upon it.  I not only meant that they should not be\r\nashamed of it, but that, if possible, it should stand the test of\r\ncriticism, both as to matter and diction.  I re-examined the question\r\nin its various aspects, and more thoroughly than I had been able\r\nto do before, giving special attention to the speeches of Southern\r\nmembers in both Houses, and carefully noting their vulnerable\r\npoints.  I overhauled the question of \"Northern aggression\" pretty\r\nthoroughly, and endeavored to expose the absurdity of that complaint,\r\nwhile crowding into my task such facts and arguments as would help\r\neducate the people in right thinking.  I had my task completed in\r\nMarch, and now anxiously waited the opportunity for its delivery.\r\nI was very curious to know how it would sound, and what would be\r\nthought of it, while my constitutional self-distrust made me dread\r\nthe experiment unspeakably.  My scuffle for the floor was a sore\r\ntrial of patience, and it was not until the fourteenth of May that\r\nthe competitive contest was ended.  I got through with the work\r\nbetter than I anticipated, was handsomely listened to, and went\r\nhome in triumph.  A great burden of anxiety had been lifted, while\r\nI received letters from the leading Abolitionists of New England\r\nand elsewhere, very cordially complimenting the speech, which was\r\ncopied into the principal anti-slavery newspapers, and quite\r\nfavorably noticed.  I was flattered beyond measure, and found my\r\nself-esteem germinating into new life under these fertilizing dews.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nREMINISCENCES OF THE THIRTY-FIRST CONGRESS (CONTINUED).\r\nFracas between Col. Benton and Senator Foote--Character of Benton\r\n--Death of Gen. Taylor--The funeral--Defeat of the \"Omnibus Bill\"\r\n--Its triumph in detail--Celebration of the victory--\"Lower law\"\r\nsermons and \"Union-saving\" meetings--Slave-holding literature--\r\nMischievous legislation--Visit to Philadelphia and Boston--Futile\r\nefforts to suppress agitation--Andrew Johnson and the homestead\r\nlaw--Effort to censure Mr. Webster--Political morality in this\r\nCongress--Temperance--Jefferson Davis and other notable men--John\r\nP. Hale--Thaddeus Stevens--Extracts from speeches--The famous men\r\nin both Houses--The Free Soilers and their vindication.\r\n\r\nI happened to be in the Senate on April 17th, just before the\r\nmemorable fracas between Foote, of Mississippi, and Col. Benton.\r\nThey had had an unfriendly encounter not long before, and it was\r\nwell understood that Benton had made up his mind that Foote should\r\nnot henceforward name him or allude to him in debate.  Foote had\r\nsaid:  \"I do not denounce him as a _coward_--such language is\r\nunfitted for this audience--but if he wishes to be blackguarded in\r\nthe discharge of his duty, and the culprit go unpunished?  Is\r\nlanguage to be used here which would not be permitted to be used\r\nin the lowest pot-house, tavern, or oyster cellar, and for the use\r\nof which he would be turned out of any tavern by a decent landlord?\"\r\nBenton's wrath had not in the least cooled since this altercation.\r\nFoote was on the floor, and in speaking of the late \"Southern\r\naddress,\" referred to Benton in terms which everybody understood.\r\nIn an indirect way he became more and more personal as he proceeded.\r\nCol. Benton finally arose from his seat with every appearance of\r\nintense passion, and with a quick pace moved toward Foote, who was\r\naddressing the Senate from his desk near the main aisle.  The Vice\r\nPresident demanded \"order,\" and several senators tried to hold\r\nBenton back, but he broke loose from his keepers, and was moving\r\nrapidly upon his foe.  When he saw Benton nearing him, Foote sprang\r\ninto the main aisle, and retreated toward the Vice President,\r\npresenting a pistol as he fled, or, as he afterward expressed it,\r\n\"advanced backward.\"  In the meantime Benton had been so obstructed\r\nby the sergeant-at-arms and others that Foote, if disposed to shoot,\r\ncould not have done so without firing through the crowd.  But\r\nBenton, with several senators hanging to him, now proceeded round\r\nthe lobby so as to meet Foote at the opposite side of the Chamber.\r\nTearing himself away from those who sought to hold him, and throwing\r\nopen his bosom, he said:  \"Let him shoot me!  The cowardly assassin\r\nhas come here to shoot me; let him shoot me if he dares!  I never\r\ncarry arms, and he knows it; let the assassin fire!\"  He was an\r\nembodied fury, and raged and raved, the helpless victim of his\r\npassions.  I had never seen such an uproar in a legislative body;\r\nbut the sergeant-at-arms at last restored order, when Mr. Clay\r\nsuggested that both parties should voluntarily enter into bonds to\r\nkeep the peace, upon which Benton instantly rose and said:  \"I'll\r\nrot in jail, sir, before I will do it!  No, sir!  I'll rot in jail\r\nfirst.  I'll rot, sir!\" and he poured forth a fresh torrent of\r\nbitter words upon the man who was then so well known throughout\r\nthe Northern States as \"Hangman Foote.\"*  Benton was not only a\r\nman of tremendous passion, but unrivalled as a hater.  Nor did his\r\nhatred spend itself entirely upon injustice and meanness.  It was\r\nlargely personal and unreasoning.  He was pre-eminently unforgiving.\r\nHe hated Calhoun with a real vengeance, styling him \"John Cataline\r\nCalhoun,\" and branding him as a \"coward cur that sneaked to his\r\nkennel when the Master of the Hermitage blew his bugle horn.\"  He\r\nseemed to relent a little, however, when he saw the life of the\r\ngreat Carolinian rapidly ebbing away, and on one occasion declared\r\nthat, \"When God lays his hand on a man, I take mine off.\"  His wit\r\nwas sometimes as pungent as his invective.  In his famous speech\r\non the Compromise measures, he gave Mr. Clay a telling hit by\r\ncomparing the boasted panacea of his \"Omnibus Bill,\" or \"five old\r\nbills tacked together,\" to \"old Dr. Jacob Townsend's sarsaparilla,\"\r\nand contrasting it with the alleged worthlessness of the same\r\nmeasures when separately proposed, which he likened to \"young Dr.\r\nSamuel Townsend's\" extract from the same vegetable.  \"Sarsaparilla\"\r\nwas thus more widely advertised than ever before, but it aided the\r\ntriumph of the \"young Dr.,\" and the defeat of Mr. Clay's pet scheme.\r\n\r\n[* So named because of his declaration in the Senate the year\r\nbefore, that if John P. Hale would come to Mississippi he would be\r\nhung to \"one of the tallest trees of the forest,\" and that he\r\n(Foote) would himself \"assist in the operation.\"]\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of Gen. Taylor, July 9, 1850, produced a very\r\nprofound impression.  The shock to the people of the Northern States\r\nwas felt the more keenly because of the peculiarly threatening\r\naspect of public affairs, and of the unexpectedly manly course of\r\nthe President in withstanding the imperious and insolent demands\r\nof the extreme men of his own section.  Millard Fillmore then stood\r\nwell before the country, and was quite as emphatically committed\r\nto the growing anti-slavery sentiment of the Free States as Gov.\r\nSeward himself; but he was now to be severely tried, and no one\r\ncould tell whether he would be true to the policy of his predecessor\r\nin resisting the ultra demands of the South, or repeat the perfidy\r\nof John Tyler by flagrantly turning his back on his past life.\r\nFor the time, however, the national bereavement seemed too absorbing\r\nfor any political speculations.  The funeral pageant, which took\r\nplace on the 13th, was very imposing.  The funeral car was a long-\r\ncoupled running gear, with wheels carved from solid blocks of wood.\r\nOver this was raised a canopy covered with broadcloth, and surmounted\r\nby a magnificent eagle.  Curtains of black and white silk in\r\nalternating festoons hung from the canopy, with rosettes, fringes,\r\nand tassels.  The car was drawn by eight white horses, richly\r\ncaparisoned, and led by as many grooms, who were all white men.\r\n\"Old Whitey,\" the venerable war steed of the President, followed\r\nimmediately behind the remains of his master, and attracted universal\r\nattention.  The procession was accompanied by the tolling of bells,\r\nthe firing of heavy ordnance, and plaintive strains of music; and\r\nthe whole affair exceeded anything of the kind that had ever taken\r\nplace in Washington, although the outpouring of the people would\r\nbear no comparison with that of several notable funerals of later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful heat of the summer months, and the monotonous \"ding-\r\ndong\" of the debate on the Compromise measures, made life dreary\r\nenough.  The \"rump-session,\" as it was then called, became more\r\nand more dismal as it dragged its slow length into the fall months.\r\nMembers grew pale and thin, and sighed for their homes; but the\r\nCongressional mill had to be kept running till the grists of the\r\nslave-power could be got fully ready for the hopper, and ground in\r\ntheir regular order.  Mr. Clay's Omnibus Bill having gone to pieces,\r\nthe \"five gaping wounds\" of the country, about which he had talked\r\nso eloquently, called for treatment in detail; and by far the most\r\nthreatening of these was the dispute between Texas and New Mexico.\r\nThe remedy was the Texas Boundary Bill, which surrendered a large\r\nbelt of country to Texas and slavery, and gave her ten million\r\ndollars besides.  It was vehemently opposed in the House, and its\r\nfate seemed to hang in doubt up to the final vote upon it; but\r\nits passage was really assured from the beginning by the corrupt\r\nappliances of its friends.  Texas bonds, which were then worth ten\r\ncents on the dollar, would be lifted nearly to par by this measure,\r\nand its success was undoubtedly secured by the bribery of members.\r\nThe territorial question was disposed of by the legislative covenant\r\nthat new States might be admitted from our Mexican acquisitions,\r\neither with or without slavery, as their people might determine.\r\nThis was not only an open abandonment of the Wilmot proviso, but\r\na legislative condemnation of the Missouri compromise line, as a\r\nviolation of the principle of \"popular sovereignty,\" and was sure\r\nto breed the mischiefs which followed four years later.  But of\r\nthe several compromise or \"healing measures\" of this session, the\r\nFugitive Slave Bill was by far the most atrocious.  It made the\r\n_ex parte_ interested oath of the slave-hunter final and conclusive\r\nevidence of the fact of escape, and of the identity of the party\r\npursued, while the simplest duties of humanity were punished as\r\nfelonies by fine and imprisonment.  The method of its enactment\r\nperfectly accorded with its character.  It was reached on the\r\nSpeaker's table on September 12th, and on motion of Mr. Thompson,\r\nof Pennsylvania, who served as the parliamentary hangman of his\r\nemployers, the previous question was seconded on its passage; and\r\nthus, without reference to any committee, without even being printed,\r\nand with no opportunity whatever for debate, it became a law.  It\r\nis needless to say that these pretended measures of final adjustment\r\npaved the way for the repeal of the Missouri restriction, the bloody\r\nraid into Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and the final chapter\r\nof the Civil War; while they completely vindicated the little party\r\nof Independents in this Congress in standing aloof from the Whig\r\nand Democratic organizations, and warning the country against\r\nfurther submission to their rule.  One hundred guns were fired in\r\nWashington over the final triumph of slavery in this memorable\r\nstruggle; and Congress adjourned, at last, on September 30th, the\r\nsession having lasted nearly ten months, and being considerably\r\nthe longest thus far since the formation of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe adjournment was followed by great \"Union-saving\" meetings\r\nthroughout the country, which denounced \"abolitionism\" in the\r\nseverest terms, and endorsed the action of Congress.  Multitudes\r\nof \"lower law\" sermons by conservative Doctors of Divinity were\r\nscattered over the Northern States through the mails, and a regular\r\nsystem of agitation to _suppress_ agitation was inaugurated.  The\r\nsickly air of compromise filled the land, and for a time the deluded\r\nmasses were made to believe that the Free Soilers had brought the\r\ncountry to the verge of ruin.  Both clergy and laity zealously\r\ndedicated themselves to the great work of sectional pacification.\r\nThe labors of Dr. Nehemiah Adams and Dr. Lord in this direction\r\nwill not be forgotten.  The Rev. Moses Stuart, of Andover Theological\r\nSeminary, in a work in the interest of peace, spoke of the \"blessings\r\nand comforts\" of slavery, and declared that \"Christ doubtless felt\r\nthat slavery might be made a very tolerable condition--aye, even\r\na blessing, to such as were shiftless and helpless.\"  Another book,\r\nentitled \"Aunt Phillis's Cabin; or Southern Life as it is,\" was\r\nissued from the press, in which it was said that slavery was\r\n\"authorized by God, permitted by Jesus Christ, sanctioned by the\r\nApostles, and maintained by good men in all ages.\"  A very remarkable\r\nbook made its appearance, entitled \"A Choice of Evils; or Thirteen\r\nYears in the South.  By a Northern man.\"  Its author was a Mr.\r\nHooker, of Philadelphia.  In this work he announced the discovery\r\nthat slavery is not only an unspeakable blessing, but a great\r\n\"missionary institution for the conversion of the heathen.\"  One\r\nof the chapters of this book is on \"The Pleasures of Slavery.\"  He\r\ndeclared that the Southern slave is not merely contented, but a\r\n\"joyous fellow\"; and that \"in willing and faithful subjection to\r\na benignant and protecting power, and that visible to his senses,\r\nhe leans upon it in complete and sure confidence, as a trusting\r\nchild holds on to the hand of his Father, and passes joyously along\r\nthe thronged and jostling way, where he would not dare to be left\r\nalone.\"  Mr. Hooker declared that \"his are the thoughts that make\r\nglad the cared-for child, led by paternal hand\"; and that \"of all\r\nthe people in the world, the pleasures of the Southern slaves seem,\r\nas they really are, most unalloyed.\"  The press teemed with kindred\r\npublications, while \"Graham's Magazine,\" Harper's \"Journal of\r\nCivilization,\" the \"Literary World,\" \"Godey's Ladies' Book,\" and\r\nother periodicals, joined in the united effort to shout the anti-\r\nslavery agitation into silence.\r\n\r\nDuring this session some laws were passed having no connection with\r\nthe slavery question, which were pregnant with very great mischief,\r\nand have only yielded up their meaning as they have been practically\r\napplied and extended.  The act of September 28th, granting land\r\nbounties to the soldiers of the Mexican war, opened the way for\r\nthe monopoly of many millions of acres of the public domain by\r\nsharks and speculators, while proving a wretched mockery of the\r\njust claims of the men in whose name it was urged.  The Swamp Land\r\nAct of the same date, owing to its loose and unguarded provisions\r\nand shameful mal-administration, has been still more fruitful of\r\nwide-spread spoilation and plunder.  The act of September 20th,\r\ngranting alternate sections of land in aid of the Illinois Central\r\nRailway, inaugurated our famous land-grant policy, which, becoming\r\nmore and more reckless and improvident in its exactions, and\r\ncunningly combining the power of great corporations with vast\r\nmonopolies of the public domain, has signally eclipsed all other\r\nschemes of commercial feudalism, and left to coming generations a\r\nproblem involving the very life of our popular institutions.  The\r\nfruits of this legislation were not foreseen at the time, but the\r\nlegislation itself fitly belongs to the extraordinary work of this\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe events of this session formed a new band of union among anti-\r\nslavery men everywhere, and naturally strengthened the wish I had\r\nlong cherished to meet some of the famous people with whose names\r\nI had been most familiar.  Accordingly, I paid a visit to James\r\nand Lucretia Mott in Philadelphia, which I greatly enjoyed, meeting\r\nthere Dr. Elder, J. Miller McKim, Dr. Furness, and other well known\r\nfriends of freedom.  Oddly enough, I was invited to dine with Judge\r\nKane, then conspicuous through his remarkable rulings in fugitive\r\nslave cases, and I found his manners and hospitality as charming\r\nas his opinions about slavery were detestable.  From Philadelphia\r\nI went to Boston, and attended the Free Soil State Convention which\r\nmet there early in October, 1850, where Sumner and Burlingame were\r\nthe principal speakers.  The latter was extremely boyish in\r\nappearance, but was counted a marvel in native eloquence.  Mr.\r\nSumner was then comparatively a young man, apparently somewhat\r\nfastidious, with a winning face, commanding figure, and a voice\r\nsingularly musical.  At this time he was only famous through his\r\norations, and I think knew relatively little of American life and\r\nsociety outside of Boston and his books.  He told me he had recently\r\nbeen lecturing at several points out of the city, and had been\r\ndelighted to find the people so intelligent and so capable of\r\nunderstanding him.  He seemed much surprised when I told him how\r\nmany admirers he had in Indiana, and I found that others shared\r\nhis unflattering impressions respecting the general intelligence\r\nof the West.  At this convention I met Dr. Palfrey, then actively\r\ninterested in anti-slavery politics, and Charles Francis Adams,\r\nthe Free Soil nominee for Vice President in 1848, with whom I dined\r\nat the old Adams mansion in Quincy a few days later.  I enjoyed\r\nthe honor of a call from Theodore Parker while in the city, but\r\nfailed to meet Mr. Garrison, who was absent.  At the \"Liberator\"\r\noffice, however, I met Stephen S. Foster, who entertained me with\r\nhis views on \"non-resistance.\"  I attended a spirited anti-fugitive-\r\nslave-law meeting in Lynn, where I first met Wendell Phillips, and\r\nenjoyed the long-coveted pleasure of hearing him speak.  The music\r\nof his voice so charmed me that I became completely his captive.\r\nFrom Boston I went to Worcester, and after a delightful visit with\r\nmy excellent friend, Judge Allen, returned to my home in the West.\r\n\r\nAfter a vacation of two months, the work of the Thirty-first Congress\r\nwas resumed at the opening of its second session.  Members returned\r\nso refreshed and invigorated that they did not appear like the same\r\nmen.  All parties seemed more friendly, but the agitation of the\r\nslavery question had not been suppressed.  Thousands of fugitive\r\nslaves had fled to Canada or to remote sections of the Northern\r\nStates, through the fear of recapture under the harsh features of\r\nthe new Fugitive Slave Act.  The method of enforcing it in different\r\nStates, involving the intervention of the army and navy, had stirred\r\nthe blood of thousands who had else remained unmoved by the slavery\r\nissue.  The effort of the National Government to make the harboring\r\nof a fugitive constructive treason, was the farthest thing possible\r\nfrom a peace-offering to the Abolitionists, but the friends of the\r\nCompromise measures failed to see that their scheme had proved\r\nentirely abortive, and made one further effort to silence the voice\r\nof humanity.  They entered into a solemn compact in writing to\r\nsupport no man for President or Vice President of the United States,\r\nor for senator or representative in Congress, or member of a State\r\nlegislature, who was not known to be opposed to disturbing their\r\n\"final settlement\" of the slavery question.  The signature of Henry\r\nClay was the first on this document, and was followed by those of\r\nvarious prominent men of the free and slave States, and of different\r\npolitical parties.  But the extreme men of the South and most of\r\nthe moderate men of the North refused to assume this obligation,\r\nwhile the Free Soilers felt perfectly sure that their cause would\r\nbe advanced by the very measures which had been taken to defeat\r\nit.  In this they were not mistaken.  \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" born of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Act, was then making its first appearance in\r\nweekly numbers of Dr. Bailey's \"National Era.\"  Hildreth's \"White\r\nSlave\" and Sumner's \"White Slavery in the Barbary States\" were\r\nwidely circulated, and exerted a powerful influence.  The writings\r\nof Judge Jay and William Goodell on the slavery question found more\r\nreaders than ever before, while the pro-slavery literature and\r\n\"south side\" theology, already referred to, called forth replies\r\nfrom various writers, and contributed largely to the general ferment\r\nwhich the friends of the Compromise measures were so anxious to\r\ntranquilize.  Indeed, while the champions of slavery were exerting\r\nthemselves as never before to stifle the anti-slavery spirit of\r\nthe free States, the Abolitionists were delighted with the tokens\r\nof progress which everywhere saluted their vision and animated them\r\nwith new courage and hope.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the first session of this Congress that several\r\nmembers of the House introduced bills providing homesteads of one\r\nhundred and sixty acres each to actual landless settlers, without\r\ncost, on prescribed conditions of occupancy and improvement.  The\r\nfirst of these bills in the order of time was that of Andrew Johnson,\r\nwhich was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and subsequently\r\nreported favorably, and debated at different times.  Similar\r\npropositions were offered in the Senate by Mr. Webster, and by\r\nSenator Walker, of Wisconsin.  The fact is also worthy of note,\r\nthat Horace Greeley, during his short term of service in the previous\r\nCongress, had offered a bill giving landless men the right to pre-\r\nempt one hundred and sixty acres for seven years, and, on condition\r\nof occupancy and improvement, the \"right of unlimited occupancy\"\r\nto forty acres of the same, without price, by a single man, or\r\neighty acres by the married head of a family.  But the legislative\r\ninitiation of the Homestead law, substantially as we now have it,\r\nbelongs to the House of Representatives of the Thirty-first Congress,\r\nand its policy was borrowed from the Free Soil platform of 1848\r\nand the Land Reformers of New York.  This measure completely reversed\r\nthe early policy of the Government, when settlers on the public\r\nlands were dealt with as trespassers, while its triumph, years\r\nafterward, marked an epoch in our legislation, and has done more\r\nto make the American name honored and loved at home and abroad than\r\nany single enactment since the year 1789.  Having earnestly espoused\r\nthis policy years before, I sought the acquaintance of Mr. Johnson\r\nfor the purpose of co-operating with him in urging it, and found\r\nhim its sincere friend.  Although loyal to his party, he seemed to\r\nhave little sympathy with the extreme men among its leaders, and\r\nno unfriendliness to me on account of my decided anti-slavery\r\nopinions.  When my homestead speech was ready for delivery, although\r\nthe slave-holders hated its doctrines as heartily as they hated\r\n\"abolitionism\" itself, and it was through his friendly tactics that\r\nI finally obtained the floor, in opposition to the earnest wish\r\nand determined purpose of Speaker Cobb.\r\n\r\nNear the close of this session, at the instance of Charles Allen,\r\nof Massachusetts, a man of real ability and stainless life, a\r\npreamble and resolutions were offered by myself calling for a\r\ncommittee to inquire into the alleged corrupt conduct of Daniel\r\nWebster in accepting the office of Secretary of State as the\r\nstipendary of Eastern capitalists.  On the motion to suspend the\r\nrules to allow this to be done, the yeas were only thirty-five;\r\nbut this vote was quite as large as could have been expected,\r\nconsidering the excellent standing of Mr. Webster at that time with\r\nthe pro-slavery sentiment of the country.  I think it is not doubted\r\nthat, being then poor, he accepted office, as he had done before,\r\non condition of pecuniary indemnity by his rich friends in Wall\r\nstreet and State street; but in the light of the far greater\r\nimmoralities and profligacies of later times, it now seems a\r\nrelatively small matter.\r\n\r\nPolitical morality was at a very low ebb during the period covered\r\nby the Thirty-first Congress.  The Whigs, now that they were in\r\npower, saw nothing amiss in the spoils system inaugurated by Gen.\r\nJackson, which was in full blast.  The President had declared that\r\nhe had \"no friends to reward and no enemies to punish,\" but under\r\nthe party pressure he totally lost sight of these words, and seemed\r\nalmost as powerless to withstand it as did Gen. Grant in later\r\nyears.  Thousands of officials were turned adrift for no other than\r\nparty reasons, while political nepotism was the order of the day.\r\nUnder the brief administration of Gen. Taylor, unprecedented\r\npolitical jobbery prevailed, both in the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments of the Government, and these evils seemed to be aggravated\r\nby the accession of Mr. Fillmore, and to gather strength as the\r\nspirit of liberty declined.  Nor was the personal morality of\r\nmembers more to be commended than their political.  The vice of\r\nintemperance was not, as now, restricted to a few exceptional cases,\r\nbut was fearfully prevalent.  A glass of wine could sometimes be\r\nseen on the desk of a senator while engaged in debate, and the free\r\nuse of intoxicating drinks by senators was too common to provoke\r\nremark.  It was still more common in the House; and the scenes of\r\ndrunkenness and disorder in that body on the last night of the last\r\nsession beggared description.  Much of the most important legislation\r\nof the session, involving the expenditure of many millions, remained\r\nto be disposed of at that sitting; and, as a preparation for the\r\nwork, a large supply of whisky had been deposited in a room\r\nimmediately connected with the Hall of Representatives, which was\r\nthronged by members at all hours of the night.  The chairman of\r\nthe Ways and Means Committee became so exhilarated that he had to\r\nbe retired from his post; and some of his brethren, who had been\r\ncalling him to order in a most disorderly manner, were quite as\r\nincapable of business as himself, while order had sought her\r\nworshipers elsewhere.  The exhibition was most humiliating, but it\r\nnow pleasantly reminds us of the wonderful changes which have been\r\nwrought by thirty years.\r\n\r\nIn this Congress, the men who afterward became the chief leaders\r\nof the Rebellion were conspicuous, and foreshadowed their future\r\ncourse.  Jefferson Davis had a military and magisterial look.  His\r\nestimate of himself was so exalted that his ordinary demeanor toward\r\nothers seemed like a personal condescension, if not an insinuation\r\nof contempt.  One of the most striking personalities in the Senate\r\nwas A. P. Butler, the colleague of Mr. Calhoun, and uncle of Preston\r\nS. Brooks, of infamous memory.  His robust physique, florid\r\ncomplexion, sparkling eye, heavy bushy suit of snow-white hair,\r\nand a certain indefinable expression of mischievous audacity, made\r\nhim a very attractive figure.  In his eulogy upon Calhoun he marred\r\nthe solemnity of the occasion by pronouncing the world \"always\" as\r\nif written \"allers,\" and by kindred evidences of \"life among the\r\nlowly.\"  The wit of John P. Hale was effective and unfailing, and\r\ngave him a decided advantage over Mr. Chase, who had nothing but\r\nhis dignity and power of argument with which to confront the\r\ntremendous odds against him.  This was happily illustrated early\r\nin the first session of this Congress, in his reply to Mr. Clemens,\r\nof Alabama, who, in a furious tirade against the Abolitionists,\r\nhad pronounced the Union dissolved already.  \"There are many timid\r\npeople at the North,\" said Hale, \"who have looked forward with\r\nexcited nerves and trembling fears at the 'wreck of matter and the\r\ncrush of worlds' which they believed would be the result of the\r\ndissolution of this Union.  I think they will be exceedingly quiet\r\nnow, when they find it has already taken place and they did not\r\nknow it, for the honorable senator from Alabama tells us it is\r\nalready dissolved.  If it is not a matter too serious for pleasant\r\nillustration, let me give you one.  Once in my life, in the capacity\r\nof a justice of the peace--for I held that office before I was a\r\nsenator--I was called on to officiate in uniting a couple in the\r\nbonds of matrimony.  They came up, and I made short work of it.\r\nI asked the man if he would take the woman whom he held by the hand\r\nto be his wedded wife; he replied, 'To be sure I will, I came here\r\nto do that very thing.'  I then put the question to the lady,\r\nwhether she would have the man for her husband.  And when she\r\nanswered in the affirmative, I told them they were man and wife.\r\nShe looked up with apparent astonishment, and inquired 'Is that\r\nall?'  'Yes,' I said, 'that is all.'  'Well,' said she, 'it is not\r\nsuch a mighty affair as I expected it to be, after all.'\"\r\n\r\nSome of the finest of Mr. Seward's speeches were delivered during\r\nthe first session of this Congress, but in the same husky voice\r\nwhich marked his later efforts.  Decidedly the finest looking man\r\nin the Senate was General Shields, of Illinois, then in his prime,\r\nand crowned with the laurels he had won in the Mexican War.  The\r\nappearance of Mr. Douglas, familiarly known as the \"little giant,\"\r\nwas in striking contrast with that of his colleague.  He cared\r\nnothing about dignity and refinement, and had a slovenly and\r\n\"unwashed\" appearance.  The towering and erect form of General\r\nHouston always commanded attention in the Senate, and he added to\r\nhis attractiveness by wearing an old-fashioned knit cap, and always\r\ndevoting a portion of his time to whittling a pine board.  The most\r\nfascinating member of the Senate was Soule, of Louisiana.  There\r\nwas a tropical charm about his oratory, which was heightened by\r\nhis foreign accent and his singularly striking presence and\r\nphysiognomy.  Winthrop was the most accomplished gentleman in the\r\nHouse.  Edward D. Baker, since so famous, was a member from Illinois,\r\nbut made no mark.  Stephens, of Georgia, looked like a corpse, but\r\nhis clear and ringing voice always commanded attention, and his\r\nwords went directly to the mark.  Toombs was recognized as a leader\r\nof Southern opinion, but disfigured his speeches by his swagger\r\nand defiance.  Among the notable men from the Northern States,\r\nHannibal Hamlin, lately retired from public life, was in the Senate.\r\nHe was then a young man, erect, fine looking, a thorough Democrat,\r\nbut not the tool of slavery.  Thaddeus Stevens was in the House,\r\nand just at the beginning of his remarkable congressional life;\r\nbut the slave power, then in full sweep of its despotism, took good\r\ncare to keep him in the background in the organization of the\r\ncommittees.  He made several speeches, in which he displayed his\r\nrare powers of invective, irony, and sarcasm, in dealing with the\r\nSouthern leaders; and no one who listened to his speech of Feb.\r\n20, 1850, could ever forget his withering reply to Mr. Mead, of\r\nVirginia, who had argued against the prohibition of slavery in the\r\nTerritories because it would conflict with the interests of Virginia\r\nas a breeder of slaves.  I quote the following:\r\n\r\n\"Let us pause for a moment over this humiliating confession.  In\r\nplain English, what does it mean?  That Virginia is now only fit\r\nto be the breeder, not the employer, of slaves!  That she is reduced\r\nto the condition that her proud chivalry are compelled to turn\r\nslave-traders for a livelihood!  Instead of attempting to renovate\r\nthe soil, and by their own honest labor compelling the earth to\r\nyield her abundance; instead of seeking for the best breed of cattle\r\nand horses to feed on her hills and valleys, and fertilize the\r\nland, the sons of that great State must devote their time to\r\nselecting and grooming the most lusty sires and the most fruitful\r\nwenches, to supply the slave barracoons of the South!  And the\r\nlearned gentleman pathetically laments that the profits of this\r\ngenteel traffic will be greatly lessened by the circumscription of\r\nslavery!  This is his picture, not mine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was equally merciless in dealing with the tribe of\r\n\"dough-faces.\"  This was illustrated in a speech later in the\r\nsession, in which he alluded to his colleague from Bucks County,\r\nMr. Ross, who had attacked him in a violent pro-slavery harangue:\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"in the natural world, a little,\r\nspotted, contemptible animal, which is armed by nature with a fetid,\r\nvolatile, penetrating _virus_, which so pollutes whoever attacks\r\nit as to make him offensive to himself and all around him for a\r\nlong time.  Indeed, he is almost incapable of purification.  Nothing,\r\nsir, no insult, shall provoke me to crush so filthy a beast.\"  As\r\nthese words were being uttered, Mr. Ross was seen precipitately\r\nmaking his way out of the hall under the return fire of his foe.\r\nBut Mr. Stevens then gave no clear promise of the wonderful career\r\nas a parliamentary leader which awaited him in later years, when\r\nperfectly unshackled by the power that at first held him in check.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-first Congress was not alone remarkable for the great\r\nquestions it confronted and its shameless recreancy to humanity\r\nand justice; it was equally remarkable for its able and eminent\r\nmen.  In the Senate, the great triumvirate of Webster, Clay, and\r\nCalhoun, appeared in public life for the last time.  With them were\r\nassociated Benton, Cass, Douglas, Seward, Chase, Bell, Berrien,\r\nSoule, Davis of Mississippi, Dayton, Hale, Ewing, Corwin, Hamlin,\r\nButler, Houston, and Mason.  In the House were Thaddeus Stevens,\r\nWinthrop, Ashmun, Allen, Cobb of Georgia, McDowell, Giddings,\r\nPreston King, Horace Mann, Marshall, Orr, Schenck, Stanley, Toombs,\r\nAlexander H. Stephens, and Vinton.  If mere talent could have\r\nsupplemented the lack of conscience, the slave power might have\r\nbeen overborne in 1850, and the current of American history turned\r\ninto the channels of liberty and peace.  But the better days of\r\nthe Republic, when high integrity and unselfish devotion to the\r\ncountry inspired our statesmen, were past, and we had entered upon\r\nthe era of mean ambitions and huckstering politics.  \"The bulk of\r\nthe nation,\" as Harriet Martineau said, a little later, \"was below\r\nits institutions,\" and our fathers \"had laid down a loftier program\r\nthan their successors were able to fulfill.\"  It was not strange,\r\ntherefore, that the little band of Free Soilers in this Congress\r\nencountered popular obloquy and social outlawry at the Capital.\r\nTheir position was offensive, because it rebuked the ruling influences\r\nof the times, and summoned the real manhood of the country to its\r\nrescue.  They were treated as pestilent fanatics because they\r\nbravely held up the ideal of the Republic, and sought to make it\r\nreal.  But they pressed forward along the path of their aspirations.\r\nThey found a solace for their social ostracism in delightful\r\ngatherings which assembled weekly at the residence of Dr. Bailey,\r\nwhere they met philanthropists, reformers, and literary notables.\r\nThey had the courage of their opinions, and the genuine satisfaction\r\nwhich accompanies manliness of character; and they lived to see\r\ntheir principles vindicated, and the political and social tables\r\nturned upon the men who had honored them by their scorn and contempt.\r\nThe anti-slavery revolt of 1848, which they represented, saved\r\nOregon from slavery, made California a free State, and launched\r\nthe policy of free homes on the public domain which finally prevailed\r\nin 1862; and it was the prophecy and parent of the larger movement\r\nwhich rallied under Fremont in 1856, elected Lincoln in 1860, and\r\nplayed its grand part in saving the nation from destruction by the\r\narmed insurgents whom it had vanquished at the ballot-box.  This\r\nwill be the sure award of history; but history will find another\r\nparentage for the party despotism and political corruption which\r\nhave since disgraced the administration of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\nPro-slavery reaction--Indiana and Ohio--Race for Congress--Free\r\nSoil gains in other States--National Convention at Cleveland--\r\nNational canvass of 1852--Nomination of Pierce and Scott, and the\r\n\"finality\" platforms--Free Soil National Convention--Nomination of\r\nHale--Samuel Lewis--The Whig canvass--Webster--Canvass of the\r\nDemocrats--Return of New York \"Barnburners\" to the party--The Free\r\nSoil campaign--Stumping Kentucky with Clay--Rev. John G. Fee--\r\nIncidents--Mob law in Indiana--Result of the canvass--Ruin of the\r\nWhigs--Disheartening facts--The other side of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe reaction which followed the passage of the compromise acts of\r\n1850 was quite as remarkable as the anti-slavery revolt of 1848,\r\nwhich frightened the champions of slavery into the espousal of\r\nthese desperate measures.  Immense meetings were held in Philadelphia,\r\nNew York, Boston, and other cities and towns throughout the country,\r\nin which leading Whigs and Democrats united in pledging themselves\r\nto make the suppression of abolitionism paramount to any question\r\nof party allegiance.  These demonstrations were vigorously seconded\r\nby leading clergymen and doctors of divinity, whose sermons were\r\nplentifully scattered over the land under the frank of members of\r\nCongress and otherwise.  The press put forth its whole power on\r\nthe side of anti-slavery submission and peace, while the Executive\r\nand Judicial departments of the Government made haste to abase\r\nthemselves by their super-serviceable zeal in the enforcement of\r\nthe new Fugitive Slave law.  The tables seemed to be completely\r\nturned, and the time-honored rule of our slave-masters impregnably\r\nre-established.  The anti-slavery commotion which a little while\r\nbefore had rocked the country from one end of the Union to the\r\nother was hushed in the restored order which succeeded, and gave\r\npromise of that longed-for \"finality\" for which the two great\r\nparties had so ardently labored.\r\n\r\nIn no section of the non-slaveholding States was this reaction more\r\nstrikingly felt than in the West, and especially in Illinois and\r\nIndiana.  These States were outlying provinces of the empire of\r\nslavery.  Their black codes and large Southern population bore\r\nwitness to their perfect loyalty to slave-holding traditions.\r\nIndiana, while a Territory, had repeatedly sought the introduction\r\nof slavery into her borders.  Her black laws had disfigured her\r\nlegislation from the beginning, and in 1850 were made still blacker\r\nby her new Constitution, the 13th article of which, forbidding\r\nnegroes from coming into the State and white men from encouraging\r\nthem to remain, was submitted to the people separately, and ratified\r\nby a popular majority of nearly ninety thousand votes.  Ten years\r\nbefore, in the Harrison campaign, Mr. Bigger, the Whig candidate\r\nfor Governor, made himself very popular by proving that Van Buren\r\nhad favored negro suffrage in New York.  In 1842, four of the\r\nIndiana delegation in Congress--namely, Lane, Wallace, Thompson,\r\nand Kennedy--voted for the censure of Mr. Giddings, which Mr. Clay\r\nindignantly denounced at the time, and two only--namely, White and\r\nCravens--voted in the negative.  Although the execution of the\r\nFugitive Slave Act of 1793 was a matter of Federal cognizance\r\nexclusively, yet the State code made the harboring of a fugitive\r\nan offense against its peace and dignity, punishable by fine and\r\nimprisonment.  The colored people were denied any share in the\r\nschool fund, but were taxed for its support; and under the law\r\nforbidding them to testify in cases where white men were parties,\r\nthey were at the mercy of any white villain who might take the\r\nprecaution of perpetrate an outrage upon them in the absence of\r\nwhite witnesses.  Of course, the organization of an anti-slavery\r\nparty strong enough to rule such States as these, was to be the\r\nwork of time, toil, and patience.  It was only possible to lay the\r\nfoundation, and build as the material could be commanded; but the\r\nFree Soilers, whether in the east or in the West, were undismayed\r\nby the crisis, and fully resolved upon keeping up the fight.  In\r\ncompliance with the wishes of my anti-slavery friends, and by way\r\nof doing my part in the work, I decided to stand for a re-election\r\nfrom the Fourth Indiana District in the spring of 1851.  The Wilmot\r\nproviso Democrats who had been chosen with me two years before on\r\nthe strength of their Free Soil pledges, including such men as\r\nJoseph E. McDonald and Graham N. Fitch, now stood squarely on the\r\nCompromise measures.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs of the State, following the lead of Webster and Clay,\r\nand including Edward W. McGaughey, their only delegate in Congress,\r\nhad also completely changed their base.  My competitor, Samuel W.\r\nParker, whom I had defeated two years before, and who had then\r\ninsisted that the Whigs were better anti-slavery men than the Free\r\nSoilers themselves, now made a complete somersault, fully committing\r\nhimself to the Compromise acts, and especially the Fugitive Slave\r\nlaw, which he declared he approved without changing the dotting of\r\nan _i_ or the crossing of a _t_.  Foote, Cass, and Webster were\r\nnow the oracles of the Whig faith; but, oddly enough, the Democrats,\r\nwho had formed by far the larger portion of my support two years\r\nbefore, now stood firm, and I would undoubtedly have been re-elected\r\nbut for very vigorous outside interference.  Wm. J. Brown, who had\r\nintrigued with the leading Free Soilers for the Speakership in\r\n1849, as I have already shown, and favored the passage of the Wilmot\r\nproviso in order to \"stick it at old Zach,\" was now the editor of\r\nthe \"Sentinel,\" the State organ of the Democracy, which was\r\nsufficiently orthodox on the slavery question to pass muster in\r\nSouth Carolina.  It was this organ which afterward insisted that\r\nmy abolitionism entitled me to at least five years service at hard\r\nlabor in the penitentiary.  Mr. Brown's dread of this fearful heresy\r\nseemed as intense as it was unbounded, and he resolved at all\r\nhazards to avert any further alliance with it by Democrats in any\r\nportion of the State.  By very hard work and the most unscrupulous\r\nexpedients he succeeded in enlisting a few ambitious local magnates\r\nof his party in the district, who were fully in sympathy with his\r\nspirit and aims, and of whom Oliver P. Morton was the chief; and\r\nby thus drawing away from the democracy from two to three hundred\r\npro-slavery malcontents and turning them over to my Whig competitor,\r\nmy defeat was accomplished.\r\n\r\nBut the effort to stem the tide of slavery fared better elsewhere.\r\nWhile Mr. Webster was publicly ridiculing the \"higher law,\" and\r\nblurting his contempt upon one of the noted anti-slavery strongholds\r\nof the country as \"a laboratory of abolitionism, libel, and treason,\"\r\nMassachusetts sent Charles Sumner to the Senate of the United\r\nStates, and elected Horace Mann, Charles Allen and Robert Rantoul\r\nas members of the House.  Amos Tuck was returned from New Hampshire,\r\nPreston King from New York, Thaddeus Stevens and John W. Howe from\r\nPennsylvania, Charles Durkee from Wisconsin, and Giddings and\r\nTownsend from Ohio.  These events were exceedingly gratifying, and\r\nlent new life to the cause throughout the Northern States.  During\r\nthe summer of this year Mr. Sumner moved the repeal of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Act, and although it received but ten votes, it led to an\r\nangry and protracted discussion, which showed how signally the\r\nattempt to suppress anti-slavery agitation had failed.  In the\r\nlatter part of September of this year a Free Soil National Convention\r\nmet at Cleveland, to take into consideration the state of the country\r\nand the duty of anti-slavery men.  It was large and enthusiastic.\r\nIt adopted a series of spirited resolutions and a timely public\r\naddress, and admirable speeches were made by Cassius M. Clay, Joshua\r\nR. Giddings, Samuel Lewis, George Bradburn, and others.  The only\r\ndrawback to the prevailing spirit of hopefulness and courage was\r\nthe absence of Mr. Chase, who had just withdrawn from the Free Soil\r\nparty and united his fortunes with the Democrats of Ohio, who had\r\nadopted a platform which admitted an interpretation covering,\r\nsubstantially, the principles of the Free Soil creed.\r\n\r\nAs the time for another Presidential election drew near, Whigs and\r\nDemocrats were alike engrossed with the consideration of their\r\n\"final settlement\" of the slavery question, and their attitude\r\nrespecting it in the impending struggle.  Among the latter there\r\nwas substantially no division.  Their experience in 1848 with Gen.\r\nCass and his \"Nicholson letter,\" had convinced them that nothing\r\nwas to be gained by mincing matters, and that a hearty, complete\r\nand unhesitating surrender to slavery was the surest means of\r\nsuccess.  The Democrats in Congress, both North and South, had very\r\ngenerally favored this \"settlement,\" and there was now no division\r\nin the party except as to men.  The candidates were Cass, Buchanan,\r\nDouglas, and Marcy; and the National Convention assembled on the\r\nfirst of June.  The platform of the party began with the declaration\r\nof its \"trust in the intelligence, the patriotism, and the\r\ndiscriminating justice of the American people\"; and then, in the\r\nfourth and fifth resolutions, pronounced the Fugitive Slave Act\r\nequally sacred with the Constitution, and pledged the party to\r\n\"resist all attempts at renewing, in Congress or out of it, the\r\nagitation of the slavery question, under whatever shape or color\r\nthe attempt may be made.\"  So far as slavery was concerned it thus\r\nbecame a recognized and authoritative principle of American Democracy\r\nto muzzle the press and crush out the freedom of speech, as the\r\nmeans of upholding and perpetuating its power.  On this platform\r\nFranklin Pierce was nominated on the forty-ninth ballot; and in\r\nhis letter of acceptance he declared that \"the principles it embraces\r\ncommand the approbation of my judgment, and with them I believe I\r\ncan safely say that no word nor act of my life is in conflict.\"\r\nIt is difficult to conceive of any words by which he could more\r\ncompletely have abdicated his manhood and self-respect, and sounded\r\nthe knell of his own conscience.  There was no lower deep, and he\r\nwas evidently the right man in the right place.\r\n\r\nThe Whig National Convention assembled on the sixteenth of June,\r\nwith Scott, Fillmore and Webster as the candidates.  There was yet\r\na considerable anti-slavery element in the party, but it was\r\nparalyzed and powerless.  It had made a fatal mistake in submitting\r\nto the nomination of Gen. Taylor, and became still more completely\r\ndemoralized by the accession of Fillmore, who turned his back upon\r\nhis past life, and threw himself into the arms of the slave-holders.\r\nThe old party had gone astray too long and too far to return, and\r\nnow determined to seek its fortunes in the desperate effort to\r\noutdo the Democrats in cringing servility to the South.  The platform\r\nof the Convention expressed the reliance of the Whigs \"upon the\r\nintelligence of the American people,\" but in its eighth resolution\r\ndeclared their acquiescence in the Compromise Acts of 1850 \"as a\r\nfinal settlement, in principle and substance, of the subjects to\r\nwhich they relate\"; and it deprecated \"all further agitation of\r\nthe questions thus settled, as dangerous to our peace,\" and pledged\r\nthe party \"to discountenance all efforts to continue or renew such\r\nagitation, whenever, wherever, or however made.\"  On this platform,\r\nwhich is well understood to have been the work of Mr. Webster, Gen.\r\nScott was nominated on the fifty-ninth ballot by a vote of two\r\nhundred and twenty-seven to sixty-six, while the highest vote\r\nreceived by Mr. Webster was twenty-nine.  Here at last, the Whig\r\nparty had made a complete surrender of its integrity, and verified\r\nall that had ever been said by Free Soilers as to its treachery to\r\nfreedom; and here, finally, these rival parties were tumbled together\r\ninto the ditch of slavery, and wallowing in the mire of their\r\ndegradation and shame.  The only issue of the canvass was slavery,\r\nand on this they were perfectly agreed, while each, for the sake\r\nof the spoils of office, was trying to surpass the other in the\r\ndamning proofs of its treason to humanity and contempt for the\r\nfundamental truths of republican government.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle was most pitiably humiliating, but I counted it an\r\nomen of progress.  The old parties were now unequivocally committed\r\nto the policy of nationalizing the sectional interest of slavery,\r\nand the way thus opened for a fair fight.  The lines were clearly\r\ndrawn, and the issue unmistakably made between freedom and free\r\nspeech on the one side, and slavery and the gag on the other.  I\r\nthought we should have no more anti-slavery professions from Whigs\r\nand Democrats, no further courting of Free-Soilers, and no more\r\nmutual upbraidings of servility to the South; and that thus the\r\nway would be smoothed for intelligent and effective anti-slavery\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Free Soil National Convention met in Pittsburg on the eleventh\r\nof August, and I believe an assemblage of purer men never convened\r\nfor any political purpose.  All the compromising and trading elements\r\nthat had drifted into the movement in 1848 had now gravitated back\r\nto the old parties, leaving a residuum of permanent adherents of\r\nthe cause, who were perfectly ready to brave the frowns of public\r\nopinion and the proscription and wrath of the old parties.  Henry\r\nWilson was made president of the convention, and the platform\r\nadopted was substantially that of 1848.  A few additional resolves,\r\nhowever, were added, including the declaration \"that emigrants and\r\nexiles from the old world should find a cordial welcome to homes\r\nof comfort and fields of enterprise in the new,\" and that \"every\r\nattempt to abridge their privilege of becoming citizens and owners\r\nof the soil among us ought to be resisted with inflexible\r\ndetermination.\"  It was also declared \"that the Free Democratic\r\nparty was not organized to aid either the Whig or Democratic wing\r\nof the great Slave Compromise party of the Nation, but to defeat\r\nthem both; and that, repudiating and renouncing both as hopelessly\r\ncorrupt and utterly unworthy of confidence, the purpose of the Free\r\nDemocracy is to take possession of the Federal Government, and\r\nadminister it for the better protection of the rights and interests\r\nof the whole people.\"  On this platform John P. Hale was nominated\r\nfor the Presidency.  My own nomination for the second place on the\r\nticket was to me a complete surprise.  I fully expected this honor\r\nwould fall upon Samuel Lewis, of Ohio, and the delegation from my\r\nown State was unitedly for him.  He coveted the nomination, and so\r\ndid his many devoted friends, simply as a fitting recognition of\r\nhis faithful service in the cause of freedom, to which he had been\r\nunselfishly devoted since the year 1841.  He had made himself a\r\npublic benefactor by his long and powerful championship of the\r\ncause of education in Ohio.  He was a man of brains, and enthusiastically\r\ndevoted to every work of practical philanthropy and reform.  As an\r\nimpassioned, eloquent, and effective popular orator, he had no\r\nequal in the country.  His profound earnestness, perfect sincerity,\r\nand religious fervor conquered all hearts, and made his anti-slavery\r\nappeals irresistible.  He was a strong and brave old man, who richly\r\ndeserved whatever distinction his nomination could confer; but for\r\nreasons unknown to me he encountered in the convention the formidable\r\nopposition of Mr. Chase, and he wrote me very touchingly a few days\r\nafterward that \"among the thousands who have given their lives and\r\nfortunes to this cause, my name will be forgotten, while those who\r\nhave coolly stood by and watched the signs of the times, and filled\r\ntheir sails with the wind that others have raised, will go down to\r\nhistory as heroes and martyrs in a cause for which they never fought\r\na battle nor suffered a sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe canvass of the Whigs was totally without heart or enthusiasm.\r\nThe Southern wing of the party had dictated the platform, but did\r\nnot like Gen. Scott.  Stephens and Toombs, of Georgia, and Jones\r\nand Gentry, of Tennessee, refused to support him.  The Northern\r\nWhigs were greatly embarrassed, and while they felt constrained to\r\nsupport the candidate, tried to relieve their consciences by\r\n\"spitting upon the platform\" on which he stood.  Mr. Webster did\r\nnot disguise his hostility to the ticket, and predicted the speedy\r\ndissolution of the party.  The Democrats were united in this contest.\r\nNotwithstanding their atrocious platform they succeeded in persuading\r\nthe leading Barnburners of 1848 to return to the party and muster\r\nagain in the army of slavery.  Dix, the Van Burens, David Dudley\r\nField, Tilden, and a host of others, including even Robert Rantoul\r\nand Preston King, were now fighting for Pierce, while Bryant's\r\n\"Evening Post\" and Greeley's \"Tribune\" cravenly submitted to the\r\nshackles of slavery.  In the light of such facts as these it was\r\neasy to forecast the result of the contest.\r\n\r\nThe real enthusiasm of this campaign was in the ranks of the Free\r\nSoilers.  They had, of course, no dream of success, or even of\r\ncarrying a single electoral vote; but they were profoundly in\r\nearnest, and united as one man against the combination of the old\r\nparties in behalf of slavery.  I took the stump, and early in the\r\ncampaign accepted an invitation to join Cassius M. Clay in the\r\ncanvass of the counties of Lewis, Bracken, and Mason, in Kentucky.\r\nOn my way to our first appointment I stopped at Maysville, where\r\nI found myself in the midst of a considerable excitement about some\r\nthirty or forty slaves who had just crossed the Ohio on their way\r\nto Canada.  I met Mr. Clay at the residence of the Rev. John G.\r\nFee, some eight miles distant in Lewis county, where we talked over\r\nthe plan of our campaign.  Mr. Fee was the founder of an anti-\r\nslavery colony, a free school, and a free church, in that region,\r\nand was a scholar, philanthropist, and reformer.  His whole heart\r\nwas in the anti-slavery cause, and his courage had never failed\r\nhim in facing the ruffianism and brutality which slavery employed\r\nin its service; but I would not have felt very safe in this enterprise\r\nwithout the presence of Mr. Clay, who was known in Kentucky, and\r\neverywhere else, as \"a fighting Christian,\" who would defend the\r\nfreedom of speech at any hazard.  Our first meeting was in Mr.\r\nFee's church, in the rocky and mountainous region of the county,\r\nwhere we had perfect order and an attentive and sympathetic audience.\r\nFrom this point we proceeded the next day to our appointment in\r\nMaysville, finding a good deal of excitement in the city as to the\r\npropriety of allowing us to speak in the court house.  It was\r\nfinally thrown open to us, and in the afternoon I was handsomely\r\nintroduced by Mr. Clay to a fine audience, speaking at length, and\r\nwith great plainness, on the issues of the canvass, and being\r\nfrequently applauded.  Mr. Clay spoke at night to a still larger\r\naudience, while perfect order prevailed.  So far our success seemed\r\ngratifying, and Mr. Fee was delighted; and we proceeded the following\r\nmorning to our next appointment at Brooksville, in Bracken county.\r\nHere we found assembled a large crowd of that brutalized rabble\r\nelement which formed the background of slavery everywhere.  The\r\naboriginal creatures gazed at us like so many wild animals, but\r\nshowed not the slightest disposition to enter the house in which\r\nwe were to speak.  Mr. Clay remarked that they must be Whigs, since\r\nthey did not seemed inclined to \"resist,\" but only to \"discountenance\"\r\nour agitation; but we had come to speak, and with Mr. Fee's family\r\nand a few friends who had come with us for an audience, we spoke\r\nabout an hour and a half each, just as if the house had been filled.\r\nA few straggled in during the speaking, and several hung about the\r\nwindows and listened, though they tried to seem not to do so; but\r\nthe most remarkable and praiseworthy thing about this congregation\r\nof Yahoos was that they did not mob us.  It must have seemed to\r\nthem a strange waste of power to spare such notorious disturbers\r\nof the peace, and return to their homes without any laurels.  This\r\nended our work in Kentucky, where we could boast that the \"finality\"\r\nplatform had been openly set at defiance, and I returned to my work\r\non the other side of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nLater in the canvass, on my return from Wisconsin and Illinois, I\r\nlearned that Andrew L. Robinson, the Free Soil candidate for Governor\r\nof Indiana, had been mobbed in the city of Terre Haute, and prevented\r\nfrom making an anti-slavery speech.  This was not surprising, as\r\nthis section of the State was largely settled by people from\r\nMaryland, Virginia, and Kentucky, who were as intolerant of\r\nabolitionism as those of Bracken county already described.  I\r\nimmediately sent a telegram making an appointment to speak in that\r\ncity, and on the day appointed reported for duty.  I found my\r\nfriends uneasy and apprehensive.  They evidently regretted my\r\ncoming, and some of them advised me quietly to return home.  The\r\ntown was full of rumors that I was not to be allowed to speak, and\r\nwas to be \"wabashed,\" as the rowdies phrased it.  But I had no\r\nthought of returning without being heard; and accordingly, at the\r\nappointed hour, I repaired to the court house, where I found a\r\nsmall crowd assembled, with restless countenances, and a gang of\r\nruffians outside, armed with stones and brickbats.  The audience\r\ngradually increased, and as I began to speak I noticed that the\r\nroughs themselves began to listen, which they continued to do during\r\nthe hour and a half I devoted to the most unmistakable utterances\r\non the slavery question.  The ringleader of the mob, for some\r\nreason, failed to give the signal of attack, and free speech was\r\nvindicated.  Timid men grew brave, and boasted of the love of order\r\nthat had prompted the people of the town to stand by my rights;\r\nyet the mob would probably have triumphed but for the presence of\r\nJoseph O. Jones, the post-master of the city, himself a Kentuckian,\r\nbut a believer in the right of free speech and the duty of defending\r\nit at all hazards.\r\n\r\nThe result of this Presidential canvass was a surprise to all\r\nparties.  The triumph of the Democrats was anticipated, but it was\r\nfar more signal than they expected.  Pierce received two hundred\r\nand fifty-four electoral votes, and Scott only forty-two, representing\r\nonly four States of the Union.  So far as the Whig party was\r\nconcerned, the result was overwhelming and final.  The party was\r\nburied forever in the grave it had dug for itself.  Hale received\r\na little more than one hundred and fifty-six thousand votes, being\r\nabout one-twentieth of the entire popular vote cast at this election;\r\nso that nineteen-twentieths of the people of the United States in\r\n1852, and only a little more than a dozen years before slavery was\r\nswept from the land, voted themselves bound and dumb before this\r\nMoloch of American politics, while only one-twentieth had the\r\ncourage to claim their souls as their own.  These were very startling\r\nfacts after more than a quarter of a century of anti-slavery agitation,\r\nand they were naturally interpreted by the victorious party everywhere\r\nas clearly foreshadowing the complete triumph of the \"final\r\nsettlement\" made by Congress in 1850.  Certainly they seemed very\r\ndisheartening to anti-slavery men; for, however confidently they\r\nmight believe in the final success of their struggle, they could\r\nnot fail to see the immense odds and fearful obstacles against\r\nwhich they would have to contend.  The debauched masses who had\r\nbeen molded and kneaded by the plastic touch of slavery into such\r\nbase uses, were the only possible material from which recruits\r\ncould be drawn for a great party of the future, which should\r\nregenerate our politics and re-enthrone the love of liberty; and\r\nthis should be remembered in estimating the courage and faith of\r\nthe men who in that dark hour held aloft the banner of freedom, in\r\nspite of all temptations to go with the multitude.\r\n\r\nBut there was another view of the situation which thoughtful anti-\r\nslavery men did not fail to enforce.  The overwhelming triumph of\r\nPierce was not an unmixed victory for slavery.  It had another\r\nexplanation.  It was to be remembered, to the credit of the Whig\r\nparty, that thousands of its members, notwithstanding their dislike\r\nof Pierce and their admiration of Gen. Scott as a man and a soldier,\r\nand despite the attempted drill of their leaders and the influence\r\nof Greeley and Seward, could not be induced to support the ticket,\r\nand were now ready for further acts of independence.  It was likewise\r\nto be remembered that in the complete rout and ruin of the party\r\na great obstacle to anti-slavery progress had been removed.  The\r\nslave-holders at once recognized this fact.  They had aimed to\r\ndefeat the party, not to annihilate it.  They saw clearly what\r\nslavery needed was two pretty evenly divided parties, pitted against\r\neach other on economic issues, so that under cover of their strife\r\nit could be allowed to have its way; and they were justly alarmed\r\nat the prospect of a new movement, having its action upon moral\r\ngrounds, and gathering into its ranks the unshackled conscience\r\nand intelligence of the Northern States.  The \"Washington Union,\"\r\nthen the national organ of the Democracy, deplored the death of\r\nthe Whig party, and earnestly hoped for its resurrection.  The fact\r\nhad always been patent to anti-slavery men that these parties were\r\nalike the bulwarks of slavery, since the Southern wing of each gave\r\nlaw to the whole body, and that until one or the other could be\r\ntotally destroyed, a really formidable anti-slavery party was\r\nimpossible.  There was also great cause for encouragement in the\r\nevident signs of a growing anti-slavery public opinion.  \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin\" had found its way to the millions on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, and the rage for it among all classes was without parallel\r\nin the history of literature.  It was served up for the masses in\r\nsixpenny editions, dramatized and acted on the stage, and coined\r\ninto poetry and song.  Slave-holders were alarmed at its wonderful\r\nsuccess, because they saw the grand part it was playing in creating\r\nthat \"public opinion of the civilized world\" which Mr. Webster had\r\ndeclared to be \"the mightiest power on earth.\"  The replies to this\r\nwonderful book, and the anti-slavery and pro-slavery literature to\r\nwhich it gave birth, largely contributed to the progress of freedom,\r\nand the final repudiation of the \"finality\" which the great parties\r\nhad combined to establish.\r\n\r\nNor was the small vote for Hale a matter of serious discouragement.\r\nIt was much smaller than that cast for Van Buren in 1848; but that\r\nwas a deceptive epoch.  Multitudes, and especially in the State of\r\nNew York, then voted the Free Soil ticket who had never before\r\nshown any interest in the slavery question, and did not manifest\r\nit afterward.  They were not Free Soil men, but Van Buren men, who\r\nhated Gen. Cass.  The vote for Hale represented the _bona fide_\r\nstrength of our cause after this element had been eliminated, and\r\nits quality went far to atone for its quantity.  The proper test\r\nof anti-slavery progress was a comparison of the anti-slavery vote\r\nof 1844 with that of 1852, and this showed an increase of nearly\r\nthree-fold in the intervening space of eight years.  This steady\r\nevolution of anti-slavery opinion from the deadening materialism\r\nand moral inertia of the times could not go backward, but in the\r\nvery nature of things would repeat itself, and gather fresh momentum\r\nfrom every effort put forth to stay its advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (CONTINUED).\r\nA notable fugitive slave case--Inauguration of Pierce--Repeal of\r\nthe Missouri compromise--Its effect upon the parties--The Free Soil\r\nposition--Know-Nothingism--The situation--First steps in the\r\nformation of the Republican party--Movements of the Know-Nothings\r\n--Mistake of the Free Soilers--Anti-slavery progress--Election of\r\nBanks as Speaker--Call for a Republican National Convention at\r\nPittsburg--Organization of the party--The Philadelphia convention\r\nand its platform--Nomination of Fremont--Know-Nothing and Whig\r\nnominations--Democratic nomination and platform--The grand issue\r\nof the campaign--The Democratic canvass--The splendid fight for\r\nFremont--Triumph of Buchanan--Its causes and results--The teaching\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the year 1853 that a notable fugitive slave case\r\noccurred in Indiana.  The alleged fugitive was John Freeman, who\r\nhad once resided in Georgia, but for many years had been a resident\r\nof Indianapolis and had never been a slave.  The marshal of the\r\nState, though he had voted against the passage of the Fugitive Act\r\nof 1850, entered upon the service of Ellington, the claimant, with\r\na zeal and alacrity which made him exceedingly odious to anti-\r\nslavery men.  He accompanied Ellington into the jail in which\r\nFreeman was confined, and compelled him to expose his shoulders\r\nand legs, so that the witnesses could identify him by certain marks,\r\nand swear according to the pattern, which they did.  The case became\r\ncritical for Freeman; but the feeling in Indianapolis was so strong\r\nin his favor that a continuance of the hearing was granted to enable\r\nhim to prepare his proofs.  He hired friends to go to Georgia, who\r\nsucceeded in bringing back with them several men who had known him\r\nthere many years before, and testified that he was a free man.  On\r\nthe day of the trial Ellington became the fugitive, while Freeman\r\nwas preparing his papers for a prosecution for false imprisonment.\r\nThe large crowd in attendance was quite naturally turned into an\r\nanti-slavery meeting, which was made to do good service in the way\r\nof \"agitation.\"  The men from Georgia were on the platform, and\r\nwhile they were complimented by the speakers on their love of\r\njustice and humanity in coming to the rescue of Freeman, no quarter\r\nwas given to the Northern serviles and flunkeys who had made haste\r\nto serve the perjured villains who had undertaken to kidnap a\r\ncitizen of the State under the forms of an atrocious law.  The\r\nmeeting was very enthusiastic, and the tables completely turned on\r\nthe slave-catching faction.\r\n\r\nWhen President Pierce was inaugurated, on the fourth of March,\r\n1853, the pride and power of the Democratic party seemed to be at\r\ntheir flood.  In his inaugural message he expressed the fervent\r\nhope that the slavery question was \"forever at rest,\" and he\r\ndoubtless fully believed that this hope would be realized.  In his\r\nannual message, in December following, he lauded the Compromise\r\nmeasures with great emphasis, and declared that the repose which\r\nthey had brought to the country should receive no shock during his\r\nterm of office if he could avert it.  The anti-slavery element in\r\nthe Thirty-third Congress was scarcely as formidable as in the\r\npreceding one, though there were some accessions.  Benjamin F. Wade\r\nwas now in the Senate, and De Witt of Massachusetts, Gerrit Smith\r\nof New York, and Edward Wade of Ohio, were members of the House.\r\nIn the beginning the session gave promise of a quiet one, but on\r\nthe twenty-third of January the precious repose of the country, to\r\nwhich the President had so lovingly referred in his message, was\r\nrudely shocked by the proposition of Senator Douglas to repeal the\r\nMissouri compromise.  This surprising demonstration from a leading\r\nfriend of the Administration and a champion of the compromise\r\nmeasures marked a new epoch in the career of slavery, and rekindled\r\nthe fires of sectional strife.  After a very exciting debate in\r\nboth houses, which lasted four months, the measure finally became\r\na law on the thirtieth of May, 1854.  It was a sprout from the\r\ngrave of the Wilmot proviso; for if, under the Constitution, it\r\nwas the duty of Congress to abandon the policy of restriction in\r\n1850, and provide that Utah and New Mexico should be received into\r\nthe Union, with or without slavery, according to the choice of\r\ntheir people, the Missouri compromise line should never have been\r\nestablished, and was a rock of offense to the slave-holders.  The\r\nCompromise Acts of 1850 had not abrogated that line, and related\r\nonly to our Mexican acquisitions; but they had affirmed a principle,\r\nand if that principle was sound, the Missouri restriction was\r\nindefensible.  The whole question of slavery was thus reopened,\r\nfor the sacredness of the compact of 1820 and the wickedness of\r\nits violation depended largely upon the character of slavery itself,\r\nand our constitutional relations to it.\r\n\r\nOn all sides the situation was exceedingly critical and peculiar.\r\nThe Whigs, in their now practically disbanded condition, were free\r\nto act as they saw fit, and were very indignant at this new\r\ndemonstration in the interest of slavery, while they were yet in\r\nno mood to countenance any form of \"abolitionism.\"  Multitudes of\r\nDemocrats were equally indignant, and were quite ready to join\r\nhands with the Whigs in branding slavery with the violation of its\r\nplighted faith.  Both made the sacredness of the bargain of 1820\r\nand the crime of its violation the sole basis of their hostility.\r\nTheir hatred of slavery was geographical, spending its force north\r\nof the Missouri restriction.  They talked far more eloquently about\r\nthe duty of keeping covenants, and the wickedness of reviving\r\nsectional agitation, than the evils of slavery, and the cold-blooded\r\nconspiracy to spread it over an empire of free soil.  Their watch-\r\nword and rallying cry was \"the restoration of the Missouri compromise\";\r\nbut this demand was not made merely as a preliminary to other\r\nmeasures, which would restore the free States to the complete\r\nassertion of their constitutional rights, but as a means of\r\npropitiating the _spirit_ of compromise, and a convenient retreat\r\nto the adjustment acts of 1850 and the \"finality\" platforms of\r\n1852.  In some States and localities the anti-slavery position of\r\nthese parties was somewhat broader; but as a general rule the ground\r\non which they marshaled their forces was substantially what I have\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Free Soilers was radically different.  They\r\nopposed slavery upon principle, and irrespective of any compact or\r\ncompromise.  They did not demand the restoration of the Missouri\r\ncompromise; and although they rejoiced at the popular condemnation\r\nof the perfidy which had repealed it, they regarded it as a false\r\nissue.  It was an instrument on which different tunes could be\r\nplayed.  To restore this compromise would prevent the spread of\r\nslavery over soil that was free; but it would re-affirm the binding\r\nobligation of a compact that should never have been made, and from\r\nwhich we were now offered a favorable opportunity of deliverance.\r\nIt would be to recognize slavery as an equal and honorable contracting\r\nparty, waiving its violated faith, and thus precluding us from\r\npleading its perfidy in discharge of all compromises.  It would\r\ndegrade our cause to the level of those who washed their hands of\r\nall taint of abolitionism, and only waged war against the Administration\r\nbecause it broke up the blessed reign of peace which descended upon\r\nthe country in the year 1850.  These Free Soilers insisted that\r\nthe breach of this compact was only a single link in a great chain\r\nof measures aiming at the absolute supremacy of slavery in the\r\nGovernment, and thus inviting a resistance commensurate with that\r\npolicy; and that this breach should be made the exodus of the people\r\nfrom the bondage of all compromises.  They argued that to cut down\r\nthe issue between slavery and freedom to so narrow, equivocal, and\r\nhalf-hearted a measure, at a time when every consideration pleaded\r\nfor radical and thorough work, was practical infidelity to the\r\ncause and the crisis.  It was sporting with humanity, and giving\r\nto the winds a glorious victory for the right when it was within\r\nour grasp.\r\n\r\nThe situation was complicated by two other political elements.\r\nOne of these was Temperance, which now, for the first time, had\r\nbecome a most absorbing political issue.  The \"Maine Law\" agitation\r\nhad reached the West, and the demand of the temperance leaders was\r\n\"search, seizure, confiscation, and destruction of liquors kept\r\nfor illegal sale.\"  Keenly alive to the evils of drunkenness, and\r\ntoo impatient to wait for the inevitable conditions of progress,\r\nthey thought the great work could be accomplished by a legislative\r\nshort-cut.  They insisted that the \"accursed poison\" of the\r\n\"rumseller,\" wherever it could be found, should be poured into the\r\ngutter along with other filth, while he should be marched off to\r\nanswer to the charge of a crime against society, and take his rank\r\namong other great offenders.  Instead of directing their chief\r\nattack against the appetite for drink and seeking to lessen the\r\ndemand, their effort was to destroy the supply.  They had evidently\r\ngiven no thought to the function of civil government in dealing\r\nwith the problem, nor did they perceive that the vice of drunkenness\r\nis an effect, quite as much as a cause, having its genesis in the\r\nunequal laws, in the domination of wealth over the poor, in the\r\nlack of general education, in inherited infirmities, physical and\r\nmental, in neglected household training; in a word, in untoward\r\nsocial conditions which must be radically dealt with before we can\r\nstrike with effect at the root of the evil.  They did not see that\r\nthe temperance question is thus a many-sided one, involving the\r\ngeneral uplifting of society, and that no legislation can avail\r\nmuch which loses sight of this truth.  For these very reasons the\r\nagitation for a time swept everything before it.  Its current was\r\nresistless, because it was narrow and impetuous.  If the leaders\r\nhad comprehended the logic of their work and its unavoidable\r\nlimitations, and had only looked forward to the overthrow of the\r\nfabric of intemperance by undermining its foundations, the regular\r\ncurrent of politics would not have been perceptibly affected, while\r\nthe way would have been left open for a more perfect union on the\r\nreally vital and overshadowing issue of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe other element referred to made its appearance in the closing\r\nmonths of 1853, and took the name of the Know-Nothing party.  It\r\nwas a secret oath-bound political order, and its demand was the\r\nproscription of Catholics and a probation of twenty-one years for\r\nthe foreigner as a qualification for the right of suffrage.  Its\r\ncareer was as remarkable as it was disgraceful.  Thousands were\r\nmade to believe that the Romish hierarchy was about to overthrow\r\nour liberties, and that the evils of \"foreignism\" had become so\r\nalarming as to justify the extraordinary measures by which it was\r\nproposed to counteract them.  Thousands, misled by political knaves\r\nthrough the arts of the Jesuits believed that the cause of freedom\r\nwas to be sanctified and saved by this new thing under the sun.\r\nThousands, through their unbridled credulity, were persuaded that\r\npolitical hacks and charlatans were to lose their occupation under\r\nthe reign of the new Order, and that our debauched politics were\r\nto be thoroughly purified by the lustration which it promised\r\nforthwith to perform.  Thousands, eager to bolt from the old parties,\r\nbut fearful of being shot down on the way as deserters, gladly\r\navailed themselves of this newly devised \"underground railroad\" in\r\nescaping from the service of their old masters.  Under these various\r\ninfluences the Whigs generally, and a large proportion of the Free\r\nSoilers and Democrats, were enlisted in the service of this remarkable\r\nmovement.  Pretending to herald a new era in our politics in which\r\nthe people were to take the helm and expel demagogues and traders\r\nfrom the ship, it reduced political swindling to the certainty and\r\nsystem of a science.  It drew to itself, as the great festering\r\ncentre of corruption, all the known rascalities of the previous\r\ngeneration, and assigned them to active duty in its service.  It\r\nwas an embodied lie of the first magnitude, a horrid conspiracy\r\nagainst decency, the rights of man, and the principle of human\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nIts birth, simultaneously with the repeal of the Missouri compromise,\r\nwas not an accident, as any one could see who had studied the\r\ntactics of the slave-holders.  It was a well-timed scheme to divide\r\nthe people of the free States upon trifles and side issues, while\r\nthe South remained a unit in defense of its great interest.  It\r\nwas the cunning attempt to balk and divert the indignation aroused\r\nby the repeal of the Missouri restriction, which else would spend\r\nits force upon the aggressions of slavery; for by thus kindling\r\nthe Protestant jealousy of our people against the Pope, and enlisting\r\nthem in a crusade against the foreigner, the South could all the\r\nmore successfully push forward its schemes.\r\n\r\nOn this ground, as an anti-slavery man, I opposed it with all my\r\nmight from the beginning to the end of its life.  For a time it\r\ncarried everything with a high hand.  It was not only irresistible\r\nin numbers, but it fought in the dark.  It pretended to act openly\r\nand in friendly conference with its enemies as to questions which\r\nit had already settled in secret conclave.  Its opponents did not\r\nknow how to wage war against it, because they did not know who were\r\ntheir friends.  If a meeting was called to expose and denounce its\r\nschemes, it was drowned in the Know-Nothing flood which, at the\r\nappointed time, completely overwhelmed the helpless minority.  This\r\nhappened in my own county and town, where thousands of men, including\r\nmany of my old Free Soil brethren, assembled as an organized mob\r\nto suppress the freedom of speech; and they succeeded by brute\r\nforce in taking possession of every building in which their opponents\r\ncould meet, and silencing them by savage yells.  At one time I\r\nthink I had less than a dozen political friends in the State, and\r\nI could see in the glad smile which lighted up the faces of my old-\r\ntime enemies that they considered me beyond the reach of political\r\nresurrection.  But I never for a moment intermitted my warfare, or\r\ndoubted that in the end the truth would be vindicated, although I\r\ndid not dream that in less than two years I would be the recognized\r\nleader of the men composing this mob, who would be found denying\r\ntheir membership of this secret order, or confessing it with shame.\r\nIt was a strange dispensation; and no record of independent journalism\r\nwas ever more honorable than that of the \"New York Tribune\" and\r\n\"National Era,\" during their heroic and self-sacrificing fight\r\nagainst this organized scheme of bigotry and proscription, which\r\ncan only be remembered as the crowning and indelible shame of our\r\npolitics.  It admits of neither defense or palliation, and I am\r\nsorry to find Henry Wilson's \"History of the Rise and Fall of the\r\nSlave Power\" disfigured by his elaborate efforts to whitewash it\r\ninto respectability, and give it a decent place in the records of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nSuch were the elements which mingled and commingled in the political\r\nferment of 1854, and out of which an anti-slavery party was to be\r\nevolved capable of trying conclusions with the perfectly disciplined\r\npower of slavery.  The problem was exceedingly difficult, and could\r\nnot be solved in a day.  The necessary conditions of progress could\r\nnot be slighted, and the element of time must necessarily be a\r\nlarge one in the grand movement which was to come.  The dispersion\r\nof the old parties was one thing, but the organization of their\r\nfragments into a new one on a just basis was quite a different\r\nthing.  The honor of taking the first step in the formation of the\r\nRepublican party belongs to Michigan, where the Whigs and Free\r\nSoilers met in State convention on the sixth of July, formed a\r\ncomplete fusion into one party, and adopted the name Republican.\r\nThis action was followed soon after by like movements in the States\r\nof Wisconsin and Vermont.  In Indiana a State \"fusion\" convention\r\nwas held on the thirteenth of July, which adopted a platform,\r\nnominated a ticket, and called the new movement the \"People's\r\nParty.\"  The platform, however, was narrow and equivocal, and the\r\nticket nominated had been agreed on the day before by the Know-\r\nNothings, in secret conclave, as the outside world afterward learned.\r\nThe ticket was elected, but it was done by combining opposite and\r\nirreconcilable elements, and was not only barren of good fruits\r\nbut prolific of bad ones, through its demoralizing example; for\r\nthe same dishonest game was attempted the year following, and was\r\noverwhelmingly defeated by the Democrats.  In New York the Whigs\r\nrefused to disband, and the attempt to form a new party failed.\r\nThe same was true of Massachusetts and Ohio.  The latter State,\r\nhowever, in 1855, fell into the Republican column, and nominated\r\nMr. Chase for Governor, who was elected by a large majority.  A\r\nRepublican movement was attempted this year in Massachusetts, where\r\nconservative Whiggery and Know-Nothingism blocked the way of\r\nprogress, as they did also in the State of New York.  In November\r\nof the year 1854 the Know-Nothing party held a National Convention\r\nin Cincinnati, in which the hand of slavery was clearly revealed,\r\nand the \"Third Degree\" or pro-slavery obligation of the order, was\r\nadopted; and it was estimated that at least a million and a half\r\nof men afterward bound themselves by this obligation.  In June of\r\nthe following year another National Convention of the order was\r\nheld in Philadelphia, and at this convention the party was finally\r\ndisrupted on the issue of slavery, and its errand of mischief\r\nhenceforward prosecuted by fragmentary and irregular methods; but\r\neven the Northern wing of this Order was untrustworthy on the\r\nslavery issue, having proposed, as a condition of union, to limit\r\nits anti-slavery demand to the restoration of the Missouri restriction\r\nand the admission of Kansas and Nebraska as free States.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the outlook as to the formation of a triumphant anti-slavery\r\nparty was not so promising towards the close of the year 1855 as\r\nit had seemed in the spring of the preceding year.  If the Free\r\nSoilers had been clear-sighted enough to distinguish between that\r\nwhich was transient and that which was permanent in the forces\r\nwhich had roused the people of the free States, and, availing\r\nthemselves of the repeal of the Missouri restriction as a God-send\r\nto their cause, had summoned the manhood of the country to their\r\nhelp, a powerful impulse would have been given in the right direction.\r\nBut in the general confusion and bewilderment of the times many of\r\nthem lost their way, and were found mustering with the mongrel\r\nhordes of Know-Nothingism, and under captains who were utterly\r\nunworthy to lead them.  Instead of inflexibly maintaining their\r\nground and beckoning the people to come up and possess it, they\r\nmeanly deserted it themselves, while vainly expecting others to\r\noccupy it.  The Whigs were totally powerless to render any service\r\nwithout first disbanding their party, and this, in many localities,\r\nthey declined to do.  Both wings of the Know-Nothing movement were\r\norganized obstacles to the formation of a new party, while the\r\nbolters from the Democrats were as unprepared for radical anti-\r\nslavery work as the Whigs or Know-Nothings.  But notwithstanding\r\nall these drawbacks, real progress had been made.  In the Thirty-\r\nfourth Congress, Wilson, Foster, Harlan, Trumbull, and Durkee were\r\nchosen senators.  In the House were Burlingame, Buffington, Banks,\r\nHickman, Grow, Covode, Sherman, Bliss, Galloway, Bingham, Harlan,\r\nStanton, Colfax, Washburn, and many others.  These were great gains,\r\nand clearly pointed to still larger accessions, and the final\r\nsubordination of minor issues to the grand one on which the people\r\nof the free States were to take their stand.  An unprecedented\r\nstruggle for the Speakership began with the opening of the Thirty-\r\nfourth Congress, and lasted till the second day of February, when\r\nthe free States finally achieved their first victory in the election\r\nof Banks.  Northern manhood at last was at a premium, and this was\r\nlargely the fruit of the \"border ruffian\" attempts to make Kansas\r\na slave State, which had stirred the blood of the people during\r\nthe year 1855.  In the meantime, the arbitrary enforcement of the\r\nFugitive Slave Act still further contributed to the growth of an\r\nanti-slavery opinion.  The famous case of Anthony Burns in Boston,\r\nthe prosecution of S. M. Booth in Wisconsin, and the decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court of that State, the imprisonment of Passmore\r\nWilliamson in Philadelphia, and the outrageous rulings of Judge\r\nKane, and the case of Margaret Garner in Ohio, all played their\r\npart in preparing the people of the free States for organized\r\npolitical action against the aggressions of slavery.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the year 1855, the chairmen of the Republican\r\nState Committees of Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vermont,\r\nand Wisconsin, issued a call for a National Republican Convention\r\nto be held at Pittsburg, on the 22d of February, 1856, for the\r\npurpose of organizing a National Republican party, and making\r\nprovision for a subsequent convention to nominate candidates for\r\nPresident and Vice President.  It was very largely attended, and\r\nbore witness to the spirit and courage which the desperate measures\r\nof the slave oligarchy had awakened throughout the Northern States.\r\nAll the free States were represented, and eight of the slave-holding,\r\nnamely:  Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee,\r\nNorth Carolina, and Texas.  The convention assembled in Lafayette\r\nHall, and the Hon. John A. King, of New York, a son of Rufus King,\r\nwas made temporary chairman, and Francis P. Blair, of Maryland,\r\nthe intimate friend of President Jackson, was made its permanent\r\npresident.  He was most enthusiastically greeted on taking the\r\nchair, and began his address with the remark that this was the\r\nfirst time he had ever been called on to make a speech.  His views\r\nwere too conservative in tone to satisfy the demands of the crisis,\r\nbut he was most cordially welcomed as a distinguished delegate from\r\na slave State.  The convention was opened by a prayer from Owen\r\nLovejoy, and there was a suppressed murmur of applause when he\r\nasked God to enlighten the mind of the President of the United\r\nStates, and turn him from his evil ways, and if this was not\r\npossible, to take him away, so that an honest and God-fearing man\r\nmight fill his place.  Horace Greeley was seen in the audience,\r\nand was loudly and unitedly called on for a speech.  He spoke\r\nbriefly, saying that he had been in Washington several weeks, and\r\nfriends there \"counseled extreme caution in our movements.\"  This\r\nwas the burden of his exhortation.  At the close of his remarks\r\nMr. Giddings was tumultuously called for, and responded by saying\r\nthat Washington was the last place in the world to look for counsel\r\nor redress, and related an anecdote of two pious brothers, named\r\nJoseph and John, who in early times had begun a settlement in the\r\nWest.  Joseph prayed to the Lord:  \"O, Lord! we have begun a good\r\nwork; we pray thee to carry it on thus,\"--giving specific directions.\r\nBut John prayed:  \"O, Lord, we have begun a good work; carry it on\r\nas you think best, and don't mind what Joe says.\"  Mr. Giddings\r\nthen introduced the Rev. Owen Lovejoy, of Illinois,--\"not Joe, but\r\nJohn.\"  Mr. Lovejoy delighted the audience, and was followed by\r\nPreston King and other speakers; and it was quite manifest that\r\nthis was a _Republican_ convention, and not a mere aggregation of\r\nWhigs, Know-Nothings, and dissatisfied Democrats.  It contained a\r\nconsiderable Know-Nothing element, but it made no attempt at\r\nleadership, while Charles Remelin and other speakers were\r\nenthusiastically applauded when they denounced Know-Nothingism as\r\na mischievous side issue in our politics, which the new movement\r\nshould openly repudiate.  The convention was in session two days,\r\nand was singularly harmonious throughout.  Its resolutions and\r\naddress to the people did not fitly echo the feeling and purpose\r\nof its members, but this was a preliminary movement, and it was\r\nevident that nothing could stay the progress of the cause.  As\r\nchairman of the committee on organization, I had the honor to report\r\nthe plan of action through which the new party took life, providing\r\nfor the appointment of a National Executive Committee, the holding\r\nof a National Convention in Philadelphia on the 17th of June, for\r\nthe nomination of candidates for President and Vice President, and\r\nthe organization of the party in counties and districts throughout\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia convention was very large, and marked by unbounded\r\nenthusiasm.  The spirit of liberty was up, and side issues forgotten.\r\nIf Know-Nothingism was present, it prudently accepted an attitude\r\nof subordination.  The platform reasserted the self-evident truths\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, and denied that Congress, the\r\npeople of a Territory, or any other authority, could give legal\r\nexistence to slavery in any Territory of the United States.  It\r\nasserted the sovereign power of Congress over the Territories, and\r\nits right and duty to prohibit it therein.  Know-Nothingism received\r\nno recognition, and the double-faced issue of the restoration of\r\nthe Missouri compromise was disowned, while the freedom of Kansas\r\nwas dealt with as a mere incident of the conflict between liberty\r\nand slavery.  On this broad platform John C. Fremont was nominated\r\nfor President on the first ballot, and Wm. L. Dayton was unanimously\r\nnominated for Vice-President.  The National Republican party was\r\nthus splendidly launched, and nothing seemed to stand in the way\r\nof its triumph but the mischievous action of the Know-Nothing party,\r\nand a surviving faction of pro-slavery Whigs.  The former party\r\nmet in National Convention in Philadelphia, on the twenty-second\r\nof February, and nominated Millard Fillmore for President and Andrew\r\nJ. Donelson for Vice President.  Some bolters from this convention\r\nsubsequently nominated Nathaniel P. Banks and William F. Johnson\r\nas their candidates, and a remnant of the Whig party held a convention\r\nat Baltimore on the seventeenth of September, and endorsed Fillmore\r\nand Donelson; but a dissatisfied portion of the convention afterward\r\nnominated Commodore Stockton and Kenneth Raynor.  All these factions\r\nwere destined soon to political extinction, but in a hand-to-hand\r\nfight with the slave power they yet formed a considerable obstacle\r\nto that union and harmony in the free States which were necessary\r\nto success.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic National Convention met at Cincinnati on the second\r\nof June.  The candidates were Buchanan, Pierce, and Douglas.  On\r\nthe seventeenth ballot Buchanan was unanimously nominated for\r\nPresident, and on the second ballot John C. Breckenridge was\r\nnominated for Vice President.  The platform re-affirmed the action\r\nof Congress respecting the repeal of the Missouri compromise and\r\nthe compromises of 1850, and recognized the right of the people of\r\nall the Territories, including Kansas and Nebraska, whenever the\r\nnumber of their inhabitants justified it, to form a Constitution\r\nwith or without domestic slavery, and to be admitted into the Union\r\nupon terms of equality with the other States.  These declarations,\r\ntogether with the express denial to Congress of the right to\r\ninterfere with slavery in the Territories, were accepted as\r\nsatisfactory to the South, and were fairly interpreted to mean that\r\nthe people of the Territories, pending their territorial condition,\r\nhad no power to exclude slavery therefrom.  In Mr. Buchanan's letter\r\nof acceptance, he completely buried his personality in the platform,\r\nand Albert G. Brown of Mississippi, and Governor Wise of Virginia,\r\npronounced him as true to the South as Mr. Calhoun himself.  These\r\nwere the tickets for 1856, but the real contest was between Buchanan\r\nand Fremont.  It was pre-eminently a conflict of principles.  The\r\nissues could hardly have been better defined, and they were vital.\r\nIt was a struggle between two civilizations, between reason and\r\nbrute force, between the principles of Democracy and the creed of\r\nAbsolutism; and the case was argued with a force, earnestness, and\r\nfervor, never before known.  No Presidential contest had ever so\r\ntouched the popular heart, or so lifted up and ennobled the people\r\nby the contagion of a great and pervading moral enthusiasm.  The\r\ncampaign for Buchanan, however, was not particularly animated, at\r\nleast in the Northern States.  It illustrated the power of party\r\nmachinery, and the desperate purpose to press forward along a path\r\nwhich had been followed too far to call a halt.  It was a struggle\r\nfor party ascendancy by continual and most humiliating concessions\r\nto the ever-multiplying demands of slavery; and the ardor of the\r\nstruggle must have been cooled by many troublesome misgivings as\r\nto the final effect of these concessions, and the policy of purchasing\r\na victory at such a price.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the canvass was aggravated by very exasperating\r\ncircumstances.  The brutal and cowardly assault of Brooks upon\r\nSumner was the counterpart of border ruffianism in Kansas, and\r\nperhaps did more to stir the blood of the people of the Northern\r\nStates than any of the wholesale outrages thus far perpetrated in\r\nthat distant border.  These outrages, however, were now multiplied\r\nin all directions, and took on new shapes.  They were legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial, cropping out in private pillage and\r\nassassination, in organized marauding and murder, and in armed\r\nviolence; and these horrid demonstrations enlivened the canvass to\r\nthe end.  Republican enthusiasm reached its white heat, borrowing\r\nthe self-forgetting devotion and dedicated zeal of a religious\r\nconversion.  Banks and tariffs and methods of administration were\r\ncompletely forgotten, while thousands of Democrats who had been\r\ntrained in the school of slavery, and hundreds of thousands of\r\nconservative Whigs, caught the spirit of liberty which animated\r\nthe followers of Fremont and Dayton.  The canvass had no parallel\r\nin the history of American politics.  No such mass-meetings had\r\never assembled.  They were not only immense in numbers, but seemed\r\nto come together spontaneously, and wholly independent of machinery.\r\nThe processions, banners, and devices were admirable in all their\r\nappointments, and no political campaign had ever been inspired by\r\nsuch charming and soul-stirring music, or cheered by such a following\r\nof orderly, intelligent, conscientious and thoroughly devoted men\r\nand women.  To me the memory of this first great national struggle\r\nfor liberty is a delight, as the part I played in it was a real\r\njubilee of the heart.  I was welcomed by the Republican masses\r\neverywhere, and the fact was as gratifying to me as it proved\r\nmortifying to the party chiefs who, a little while before, had\r\nfound such comfort in the assurance that henceforward they were\r\nrid of me.  With many wry faces they submitted, after all sorts of\r\nmanoeuvers early in the canvass to keep me in the background, varied\r\nby occasional threats to drive me out of the party.  As their own\r\nparty standing became somewhat precarious they completely changed\r\ntheir base, and often amused the public by super-serviceable displays\r\nof their personal friendship.  Even the ring-leader of the Know-\r\nNothing mob of two years before, standing up to his full height of\r\n\"six feet six,\" used to introduce me at mass meetings as \"Your\r\nhonored representative in Congress, and war-worn veteran in the\r\ncause of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nBut Buchanan triumphed.  The baleful interposition of Know-Nothingism\r\nstood in the way of that union of forces which the situation\r\ndemanded, and was thus chiefly responsible for the Republican\r\ndefeat.  The old Whigs who had so recently stepped from their\r\n\"finality\" platform, could not be unitedly rallied, and the Democratic\r\nbolters were only half converted.  In my own State the opposition\r\nto the Democracy repudiated even the name Republican, and entered\r\nthe field as \"the People's party.\"  It was a combination of\r\nweaknesses, instead of a union of forces.  All the Fillmore Know-\r\nNothings and Silver-Grey Whigs of the State were recognized as\r\nbrethren.  At least one man on the State ticket, of which Oliver\r\nP. Morton was the head, was a Fillmore man, while both Fillmore\r\nand anti-Fillmore men had been chosen as delegates to Philadelphia\r\nand electors for the State.  The political managers even went so\r\nfar as to suppress their own electoral ticket during the canvass,\r\nas a peace-offering to old Whiggery and Know-Nothingism, while the\r\nadmission of Kansas as a free State was dealt with as the sole\r\nissue, and border ruffian outrages and elaborate disclaimers of\r\n\"abolitionism\" were the regular staple of our orators, who openly\r\ndeclared that the Republican party was a \"white man's party.\"  Anti-\r\nslavery speakers like Clay and Burlingame were studiously kept out\r\nof Southern Indiana, where the teachings of Republicanism were\r\nespecially needed, and Richard W. Thompson, then the professed\r\nchampion of Fillmore, but in reality the stipendary of the Democrats,\r\ntraversed that region on the stump, denounced the Republicans as\r\n\"Abolitionists,\" \"disunionists,\" and \"incendiaries,\" and was\r\neverywhere unchallenged in his course.  Similar tactics, though\r\nnot so deplorably despicable, prevailed in several of the other\r\nStates, giving unmistakable evidence of the need of a still further\r\nand more thorough enlightenment of the people as to the spirit and\r\naims of slavery.  In the light of these facts, I was not at all\r\ncast down by the defeat of Fremont.  He was known as an explorer,\r\nand not as a statesman.  If he had succeeded, with mere politicians\r\nin his cabinet, a Congress against him, and only a partially\r\ndeveloped anti-slavery sentiment behind him, the cause of freedom\r\nwould have been in fearful peril.  The revolution so hopefully\r\nbegun might have been arrested by half-way measures, promoting the\r\nslumber rather than the agitation of the truth, while the irritating\r\nnostrums of Buchanan Democracy, so necessary to display the\r\nabominations of slavery, would have been lost to us.  The moral\r\npower of the canvass for Fremont was itself a great gain,\r\nnotwithstanding the cowardice of some of its leaders.  The Republican\r\nmovement could not now go backward, and with a probation of four\r\nyears to prepare for the next conflict, unembarrassed by the\r\nresponsibilities of power, and free to profit by the blunders and\r\nmisdeeds of its foe, it was pretty sure of a triumph in 1860.\r\nFremont had received a popular vote of one million three hundred\r\nand forty-one thousand two hundred and sixty-four, carrying eleven\r\nStates and one hundred and fourteen electoral votes; while only\r\nfour years before, John P. Hale, standing on substantially the same\r\nplatform, had received only a little more than one hundred and\r\nfifty-seven thousand, and not a single electoral vote.  This showed\r\na marvelous anti-slavery progress, considering the age of the\r\nmovement, the elements it forced into combination, and the difficulties\r\nunder which it struggled into life; and no one could misinterpret\r\nits significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nPROGRESS OF REPUBLICANISM.\r\nThe Dred Scott decision--The struggle for freedom in Kansas--\r\nInstructive debates in Congress--Republican gains in the Thirty-\r\nfifth Congress--The English bill--Its defeat and the effect--\r\nDefection of Douglas--Its advantages and its perils--Strange course\r\nof the New-York Tribune and other Republican papers--Republican\r\nretreat in Indiana--Illinois Republicans stand firm, and hold the\r\nparty to its position--Gains in the Thirty-sixth Congress--Southern\r\nbarbarism and extravagance--John Brown's raid--Cuba and the slave\r\ntrade--Oregon and Kansas--Aids to anti-slavery progress--The\r\nSpeakership and Helper's book--Southern insolence and extravagance\r\n--Degradation of Douglas--Slave code for the Territories--Outrages\r\nin the South--Campaign of 1860--Charleston convention and division\r\nof the Democrats--Madness of the factions--Bell and Everett--\r\nRepublican National Convention and its platform--Lincoln and Seward\r\n--Canvass of Douglas--The campaign for Lincoln--Conduct of Seward\r\n--Republican concessions and slave-holding madness.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans, however, were sorely disappointed by their defeat;\r\nbut this second great victory of slavery did not at all check the\r\nprogress of the anti-slavery cause.  It had constantly gathered\r\nstrength from the audacity and recklessness of slave-holding\r\nfanaticism, and it continued to do so.  On the 6th of March, 1857,\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States harnessed itself to the car\r\nof slavery by its memorable decision in the case of Dred Scott,\r\naffirming that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the\r\nTerritories, and, inferentially, that the Constitution carried with\r\nit the right to hold slaves there, even against the will of their\r\npeople.  The point was not before the court, and the opinion of\r\nChief Justice Taney was therefore purely extra-judicial.  It was\r\nsimply a political harangue in defense of slavery.  It created a\r\nprofound impression throughout the free States, and became a powerful\r\nweapon in the hands of Republicans.  It was against the whole\r\ncurrent of adjudications on the subject, and they denounced it as\r\na vile caricature of American jurisprudence.  They characterized\r\nit as the distilled diabolism of two hundred years of slavery,\r\nstealthily aiming at the overthrow of our Republican institutions,\r\nwhile seeking to hide its nakedness under the fig-leaves of judicial\r\nfairness and dignity.  They branded it as the desperate attempt of\r\nslave-breeding Democracy to crown itself king, by debauching the\r\nFederal judiciary and waging war against the advance of civilization.\r\nTheir denunciations of the Chief Justice were unsparing and\r\nremorseless; and they described him as \"pouring out the hoarded\r\nvillainies of a life-time into a political opinion which he tried\r\nto coin into law.\"  When Senator Douglas sought to ridicule their\r\nclamor by inquiring whether they would take an appeal from the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States to a town meeting, they answered:\r\n\"Yes, we appeal from the court to the people, who made the\r\nConstitution, and have the right, as the tribunal of last resort,\r\nto define its meaning.\"  Nothing could more clearly have marked\r\nthe degradation to which the power of slavery had reduced the\r\ncountry than this decision, and no other single event could have\r\nso prepared the people for resistance to its aggressions.  It was\r\nthoroughly cold-blooded in its letter and spirit, and no Spanish\r\nInquisitor ever showed less sympathy for his victim than did the\r\nChief Justice for the slave.\r\n\r\nBut the Dred Scott iniquity did not stand alone.  It had been\r\nprocured for the purpose of fastening slavery upon all the Territories,\r\nand it had, of course, a special meaning when applied to the\r\ndesperate struggle then in progress to make Kansas a slave State.\r\nThe conduct of the Administration during this year, in its treatment\r\nof the free State men of that Territory, forms one of the blackest\r\npages in the history of slavery.  The facts respecting their labors,\r\ntrials, and sufferings, and the methods employed to force upon them\r\nthe Lecompton Constitution, including wholesale ballot-stuffing\r\nand every form of ruffianism, pillage, and murder, need not be\r\nrecalled; but all these were but the outcroppings and counterpart\r\nof the Dred Scott decision, and the horrid travesty of the principle\r\nof popular sovereignty in the Territories.  The whole power of the\r\nAdministration, acting as the hired man of slavery, was ruthlessly\r\nemployed for the purpose of spreading the curse over Kansas, and\r\nestablishing it there as an irreversible fact; and all the departments\r\nof the Government now stood as a unit on the side of this devilish\r\nconspiracy.  Everybody knew the Lecompton constitution was the work\r\nof outside ruffians, and not of the people of the Territory, whose\r\nLegislature in February, 1858, solemnly protested against their\r\nadmission under that Constitution, and whose protest was totally\r\nunheeded.  The Congressional debates during this period greatly\r\ncontributed to the anti-slavery education of the people, by more\r\nclearly unmasking the real spirit and designs of the slaveholders.\r\nWe were treated to the kind of talk then becoming current about\r\n\"Northern mud-sills,\" \"filthy operatives,\" the \"ownership of labor\r\nby capital,\" and the beauties and beatitudes of slavery.  Such\r\nmaddened extremists as Hammond and Keitt of South Carolina, and such\r\nblatant doughfaces as Petit of Indiana, became capital missionaries\r\nin the cause of freedom.  Their words were caught up by the press\r\nof the free States, and added their beneficent help to the work so\r\nsplendidly going forward through the providential agency of \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, freedom had made large gains in the composition\r\nof the Thirty-fifth Congress, which now had charge of the Lecompton\r\nswindle.  The Senate contained twenty Republican members and the\r\nHouse ninety-two.  Kansas had not been forced into the Union as a\r\nslave State, but she was helpless at the feet of the Executive.\r\nIn the midst of the angry debate a new proposition was brought\r\nforward, on the twenty-third of April, which was even more detestable\r\nthan the Lecompton bill itself.  This was known as the \"English\r\nbill,\" which offered Kansas a very large and tempting land grant,\r\nif she would come into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution,\r\nbut provided that if she voted to reject the land grant she should\r\nneither receive the land nor be admitted as a State until the\r\nTerritory acquired a population sufficient to elect a representative\r\nto the House.  The infamy of this proposition was heightened by\r\nthe fact that these long-suffering pioneers, weary and harassed by\r\ntheir protracted struggle and longing for peace, were naturally\r\ntempted to purchase it at any price.  It was a proposition of\r\ngigantic bribery, after bluster and bullying had been exhausted.\r\nIt was, in fact, both a bribe and a menace, and measured at once\r\nthe political morality of the men who favored it, and the extremity\r\nto which the slave-holders were driven in the prosecution of their\r\ndesperate enterprise.  After a protracted debate in both Houses,\r\nand at the end of a struggle of five months, the bill was passed\r\nand received the Executive approval; but the rejoicing of the slave-\r\nholders and their allies was short-lived.  The people of Kansas\r\nwere not in the market.  They had suffered too much and too long\r\nin the battle for freedom to make merchandise of their convictions\r\nand sacrifice the future of a great commonwealth.  They spurned\r\nthe bribe, and took the chances of triumph through an indefinitely\r\nprolonged conflict, while recruits to the ranks of freedom were\r\nnaturally falling into line throughout the Northern States.\r\n\r\nIn December of this year I attended another fugitive slave case in\r\nIndianapolis.  The claimant was one Vallandingham, of Kentucky,\r\nwhose agent caught the alleged fugitive in Illinois, and was passing\r\nthrough Indianapolis on his way home.  The counsel for the negro,\r\nEllsworth, Coburn, Colley, and myself, brought the case before\r\nJudge Wallace, on _habeas corpus_, and had him discharged.  The\r\nclaimant immediately had him arrested and taken before Commissioner\r\nRea, for trial.  We asked for the continuance of the case on the\r\naffidavit of the negro that he was free, and could prove it if\r\nallowed three weeks' time in which to procure his witnesses; but\r\nthe Commissioner ruled that the proceeding was a summary _ex-parte_\r\none, and that the defendant had no right to any testimony.  Of\r\ncourse we were forced into trial, and after allowing secondary\r\nproof where the highest was attainable, and permitting hearsay\r\nevidence and mere rumor, the Commissioner granted his certificate\r\nfor the removal of the adjudged fugitive.  We again brought the\r\ncase before Judge Wallace, on _habeas corpus_, when the negro denied\r\nall the material facts of the marshal's return, under oath, and\r\nasked to be allowed to prove his denial; but the Judge refused\r\nthis, and he was handed over to the marshal for transportation\r\nSouth.  On the trial he was shown to have been free by the act of\r\nhis master in sending him into a free State; but under cover of an\r\ninfamous law, and by the help of truculent officials, he was remanded\r\ninto slavery.  The counsel for the negro, with a dozen or more who\r\njoined them, resolved upon one further effort to save him.  The\r\nproject was that two or three men selected for the purpose were to\r\nask of the jailer the privilege of seeing him the next morning and\r\ngiving him good-bye; and while one of the party engaged the jailer\r\nin conversation, the negro was to make for the door, mount a horse\r\nhitched near by, and effect his escape.  The enterprise had a\r\nfavorable beginning.  The negro got out, mounted a horse, and might\r\nhave escaped if he had been a good horseman; but he was awkward\r\nand clumsy, and unfortunately mounted the wrong horse, and a very\r\npoor traveler; and when he saw the jailer in pursuit, and heard\r\nthe report of his revolver, he surrendered, and was at once escorted\r\nSouth.  Walpole and his brother were for the claimant.  This is\r\nthe only felony in which I was ever involved, but none of the\r\nparties to it had any disposition whatever to confess it at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party gathered fresh courage and strength in the\r\nyear 1858 from the defection of Douglas.  His unmistakable ability\r\nand hitherto unquestioned devotion to slavery had singled him out\r\nas the great leader and coming man of his party.  He was ambitious,\r\nand by no means scrupulous in his political methods.  The moral\r\ncharacter of slavery gave him not the slightest concern, ostentatiously\r\ndeclaring that he did not care whether it was \"voted up or voted\r\ndown\" in the Territories, and always lavishing his contempt upon\r\nthe negro.  He was the great champion of popular sovereignty, but\r\nat the same time fully committed himself to the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, whatever it might be; and after\r\nthat decision had been given, and, in effect, against his particular\r\nhobby, he defended it, while vainly striving to vindicate his\r\nconsistency.  But the Lecompton swindle was so revolting a mockery\r\nof the right of the people of Kansas, that his own Democratic\r\nconstituents would not endorse it, and he was obliged, contrary to\r\nhis strong party inclinations, to take his stand against it.  It\r\nwas an event of very great significance, both North and South, and\r\ngave great comfort to anti-slavery men of all shades of opinion;\r\nbut it brought with it, at the same time, a serious peril to the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\nHis accession to the Anti-Lecompton ranks was deemed so important\r\nthat many leading Republicans, of different States, thought he\r\nshould be welcomed and honored by the withdrawal of all party\r\nopposition to his re-election to the Senate.  They argued that in\r\nno other way could the despotic power of the Democratic power be\r\nso effectually broken, and the real interests of republicanism\r\nadvanced.  This feeling, for a time, prevailed extensively, and\r\nthreatened to put in abeyance or completely supersede the principles\r\nso broadly laid down in the national platform of 1856.  The \"New\r\nYork Tribune\" took the lead in beating this retreat.  It sympathized\r\nwith Douglas to the end of his canvass, and in connection with\r\nkindred agencies probably saved him from defeat.  It urged the\r\ndisbanding of the Republican party, and the formation of a new\r\ncombination against the Democrats, composed of Republicans, Douglas\r\nDemocrats, Know-Nothings, and old Whigs, but without any avowal of\r\nprinciples.  It proposed that by the common consent of these parties\r\nthe Republicans should be allowed to name the next candidate for\r\nthe Presidency, and the other parties the candidate for the Vice\r\nPresidency; or that this proposition should be reversed, if found\r\nadvisable, with a view to harmony.  The different wings of this\r\ncombination were to call themselves by such names and proclaim such\r\nprinciples in different States and localities as might seem to them\r\nmost conducive to local success and united ascendancy.  This\r\nabandonment of republicanism was likewise favored by such papers\r\nas the \"Cincinnati Gazette,\" which pronounced the policy of\r\nCongressional prohibition worthless as a means of excluding slavery\r\nfrom the Territories, and openly committed itself to the admission\r\nof more slave States, whenever demanded by a popular majority in\r\nany Territory.  \"The Indianapolis Journal\" and other leading\r\nRepublican organs spoke of Congressional prohibition as \"murdered\r\nby Dred Scott,\" and as having no longer any practical value.  In\r\nthe spring of this year the Republicans of Indiana, in their State\r\nconvention, not only surrendered the policy of Congressional\r\nprohibition, and adopted the principle of popular sovereignty, but\r\nmade opposition to the Lecompton Constitution the sole issue of\r\nthe canvass.  Under such leaders as Oliver P. Morton and his Whig\r\nand Know-Nothing associates, Republicanism simply meant opposition\r\nto the latest outrage of slavery, and acquiescence in all preceding\r\nones; but this shameful surrender of the cause to its enemies was\r\ndeservedly condemned in the election which followed.  The Legislature\r\nof the State, however, at its ensuing session, overwhelmingly\r\nendorsed the Douglas dogma, and even the better class of Republican\r\npapers urged the abandonment of the Republican creed.  But, very\r\nfortunately for the cause, the Republicans of Illinois could not\r\nbe persuaded to take Mr. Douglas into their embrace on the score\r\nof a single worthy act, and forget, if not forgive, his long career\r\nof effective and untiring hostility to the principles they cherished;\r\nand his nomination by the Democrats, on a platform very offensive\r\nto Republicans, fully justified their course.  The result was the\r\nnomination of Mr. Lincoln as a candidate for the succession to Mr.\r\nDouglas, and the great joint debate which did so much to educate\r\nthe mind of the free States and prepare the way for Mr. Lincoln's\r\nnomination the following year, while revealing the moral unworthiness\r\nof his great rival, and justifying the policy which made necessary\r\nthis memorable contest in Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe steady march of the Republican party toward ascendancy was\r\nshown in the Thirty-sixth Congress, which met in December, 1859.\r\nThere were now twenty-four Republican senators, and one hundred\r\nand nine representatives.  Early in the first session of this\r\nCongress an interesting debate occurred in the Senate on a proposition\r\nto provide for the education of the colored children of the District\r\nof Columbia.  Mr. Mason condemned the proposition, and said it was\r\nwise to prohibit the education of the colored race.  Jefferson\r\nDavis declared that the Government was not made for them, and that\r\n\"we have no right to tax our people to educate the barbarians of\r\nAfrica.\"  These and kindred utterances were very well calculated\r\nto aid the work of anti-slavery progress.  John Brown's raid into\r\nVirginia kindled the ire of the slave-holders to a degree as yet\r\nunprecedented, and although his act found few defenders in the\r\nNorthern States, the heroism with which he met his fate, the pithy\r\ncorrespondence between Gov. Wise and Mrs. Child, the language of\r\nSouthern senators in dealing with the subject, and the efforts made\r\nto ferret out Brown's associates, all tended to strengthen the\r\ngrowing hostility to slavery and prepare the way for the final\r\nconflict.  The designs of the slaveholders upon Cuba, which were\r\navowed in this Congress, and their purpose to acquire it for the\r\nextension of slavery, by purchase if they could, but if not by war,\r\nserved the same purpose.  The growing demand for the revival of\r\nthe African slave trade, as shown by the avowals of leading men in\r\nboth houses of Congress, and their cold-blooded utterances on the\r\nsubject, produced a profound impression on the country, and called\r\nforth the startling fact that the city of New York was then one of\r\nthe greatest slave-trading marts in the world, and that from thirty\r\nto sixty thousand persons a year were taken from Africa to Cuba by\r\nvessels from that single port.  Such facts as these, and that the\r\nlaws of the Union for the suppression of the traffic were not only\r\na dead letter but that the slave masters and their allies sullenly\r\nrefused to take any steps whatever for the remedy of this organized\r\ninhumanity, were capital arguments for the Republicans, which they\r\nemployed with telling effect.  The refusal to admit Oregon as a\r\nState without a constitutional provision excluding people of color,\r\nthe rejection of Kansas on her application with a Constitution\r\nfairly adopted by her people, and the great speech of Sumner on\r\n\"The Barbarism of Slavery,\" which this last application called\r\nforth, all served their purpose in the growth of anti-slavery\r\nopinion.  So did the attempt to divide California for the purpose\r\nof introducing slavery into the southern portion; the veto of an\r\nAct of the Territorial Legislature of Kansas abolishing slavery,\r\nand of a similar act in Nebraska; the acts of several Southern\r\nStates permitting free colored persons to sell themselves as slaves\r\nif they chose to do so in preference to expulsion from the land of\r\ntheir birth and their homes; the decision of the courts of Virginia\r\nthat slaves had no social or civil rights, and no legal capacity\r\nto choose between being emancipated or sold as slaves; the refusal\r\nof the Government to give a passport to a colored physician of\r\nMassachusetts, for the reason that such privileges were never\r\nconferred upon persons of color; and the revolutionary sentiments\r\nuttered by governors and legislatures of various Southern States,\r\nsome of which declared that the election of a Republican President\r\nwould be sufficient cause for withdrawal from the Union.  That\r\nthese were important aids to the progress of freedom was shown by\r\nthe passage of laws in various Northern States for the protection\r\nof personal liberty, forbidding the use of local jails for the\r\ndetention of persons claimed as fugitive slaves, and securing for\r\nthem the right of trial by jury and the benefit of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_.  This healthy reaction was still further shown in\r\nwholesome judicial decisions in several Northern States affirming\r\nthe citizenship of negroes, and denying the right of transit of\r\nslave-holders with their slaves over their soil.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for the Speakership in this Congress, which lasted\r\neight weeks, was also a first-rate training school for Republicanism.\r\nHelper's famous book, \"The Impending Crisis,\" had made a decided\r\nsensation throughout the country, and John Sherman, the principal\r\ncandidate of the Republicans for Speaker, had endorsed it, though\r\nhe now denied the fact.  Mr. Millson of Virginia, declared that\r\nthe man who \"consciously, deliberately, and of purpose, lends his\r\nname and influence to the propagation of such writings, is not only\r\nnot fit to be Speaker, but he is not fit to live.\"  De Jarnette,\r\nof the same State, said that Mr. Seward was \"a perjured traitor,\r\nwhom no Southerner could consistently support or even obey, should\r\nthe nation elect him President.\"  Mr. Pryor said that eight million\r\nSouthern freemen could not be subjugated by any combination whatever,\r\n\"least of all by a miscellaneous mob of crazy fanatics and conscience-\r\nstricken traitors.\"  Mr. Keitt said that \"should the Republican\r\nparty succeed in the next Presidential election, my advice to the\r\nSouth is to snap the cords of the Union at once and forever.\"  Mr.\r\nCrawford of Georgia said, \"we will never submit to the inauguration\r\nof a black Republican President\"; and these and like utterances\r\nwere applauded by the galleries.  The growing madness and desperation\r\nin the Senate were equally noteworthy.  This was shown by the\r\nremoval of Mr. Douglas from the chairmanship of the Committee on\r\nTerritories, and the determined purpose to read him out of the\r\nparty for refusing to violate the principle of popular sovereignty\r\nin the Territory of Kansas.  The attempt to hunt down a man who\r\nhad done the South such signal service in dragooning the Northern\r\nDemocracy into its support could not fail to divide the party, and\r\nat the same time completely unmask the extreme and startling designs\r\nwhich the slave power had been stealthily maturing.  But that power\r\nwas now absolutely bent upon its purpose, and morally incapable of\r\npausing in its work.  Its demand was a slave code for the Territories,\r\nand it would accept nothing less.  Jefferson Davis was the champion\r\nof this policy, which he embodied in a series of resolutions and\r\nmade them the text of an elaborate argument; and Mr. Douglas replied\r\nin a speech which at once vindicated himself and overwhelmingly\r\ncondemned the party with which he had so long acted.  The resolutions,\r\nhowever, were adopted by the Senate, which thus proclaimed its\r\npurpose to nationalize slavery.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime these remarkable legislative proceedings had their\r\ncounterpart in increasing lawlessness and violence throughout the\r\nSouth.  This was illustrated in such facts as the expulsion of\r\nmembers of the Methodist Church North from Texas, the imprisonment\r\nof Rev. Daniel Worth, in North Carolina, for circulating Helper's\r\n\"Impending Crisis\"; the exile from Kentucky of the Rev. John G.\r\nFee and his colony of peaceable and law-abiding people, on account\r\nof their anti-slavery opinions; and the espionage of the mails by\r\nevery Southern postmaster, who under local laws had the power to\r\ncondemn and \"burn publicly\" whatever he deemed unfit for circulation,\r\nwhich laws had been pronounced constitutional by Caleb Cushing,\r\nwhile Attorney General of the United States under Mr. Pierce, and\r\nwere \"cheerfully acquiesced in\" by Judge Holt, Postmaster General\r\nunder Buchanan.  In Virginia the spirit of lawlessness became such\r\na rage that one of her leading newspapers offered a reward of fifty\r\nthousand dollars for the head of Wm. H. Seward, while another paper\r\noffered ten thousand dollars for the kidnapping and delivery in\r\nRichmond of Joshua R. Giddings, or five thousand dollars for his\r\nhead.  In short, the reign of barbarism was at last fully ushered\r\nin, and the whole nation was beginning to realize the truth of Mr.\r\nLincoln's declaration, which he borrowed from St. Mark, that \"a\r\nhouse divided against itself can not stand.\"  The people of the\r\nfree States were at school, with the slaveholders as their masters;\r\nand the dullest scholars were now beginning to get their lessons.\r\nEven the Know-Nothings and Silver-Grey Whigs were coming up to the\r\nanxious seat, under the enlightening influence and saving-grace of\r\nslaveholding madness and crime.  The hour was ripe for action, and\r\nthe dawn of freedom in the South was seen in the coming emancipation\r\nof the North.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential Campaign of 1860 was a very singular commentary\r\non the Compromise measures of 1850 and the \"finality\" platforms of\r\n1852.  The sectional agitation which now stirred the country\r\noutstripped all precedent, and completely demonstrated the folly\r\nof all schemes of compromise.  The Democratic National Convention\r\nmet in the city of Charleston on the twenty-third day of May.  Its\r\naction now seems astounding, although it was the inevitable result\r\nof antecedent facts.  The Democratic party had the control of every\r\ndepartment of the Government, and a formidable popular majority\r\nbehind it.  It had the complete command of its own fortunes, and\r\nthere was no cause or even excuse for the division which threatened\r\nits life.  The difference between the Southern Democrats and the\r\nfollowers of Douglas was purely metaphysical, eluding entirely the\r\npractical common sense of the people.  Both wings of the party now\r\nstood committed to the Dred Scott decision, and that surrendered\r\neverything which the extreme men of the South demanded.  It was \"a\r\nquarrel about goats' wool,\" and yet the Southern Democrats were\r\nmaddened at the thought of submitting to the nomination of Douglas\r\nfor the Presidency.  His sin in the Lecompton affair was counted\r\nunpardonable, and they seemed to hate him even more intensely than\r\nthey hated the Abolitionists.  A committee on resolutions was\r\nappointed, which submitted majority and minority, or Douglas and\r\nanti-Douglas, reports.  These were hotly debated, but the Douglas\r\nplatform was adopted, which led to the secession of the Southern\r\ndelegates.  On the fifty-seventh ballot Mr. Douglas received a\r\nclear majority of the Electoral College, but the Convention then\r\nadjourned till the eighteenth of June, in the hope that harmony\r\nmight in some way be restored.  On reassembling this was found\r\nimpossible, and the balloting was resumed, which finally gave Mr.\r\nDouglas all the votes cast but thirteen, and he was declared the\r\nDemocratic nominee.  The Convention then nominated for the Vice\r\nPresidency Herschel V. Johnson, of Georgia, a disciple of Calhoun,\r\nwhose extreme opinions were well known.  He was unequivocally\r\ncommitted to the doctrine that neither the General Government nor\r\na Territorial Government can impair the right of slave property in\r\nthe common Territories.  This illustration of the political profligacy\r\nof the Douglas managers, and burlesque upon popular sovereignty,\r\nwas as remarkable as the madness of the seceders in fighting him\r\nfor his supposed anti-slavery prejudices.  The bolters from this\r\nconvention afterward nominated John C. Breckenridge as their\r\ncandidate for President and Joseph Lane for Vice President.  The\r\nDemocratic canvass was thus inaugurated, and the overthrow of the\r\nparty provided for in the mere wantonness of political folly.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of May what was called the Constitutional Union Party\r\nheld its convention at Baltimore, and nominated John Bell for\r\nPresident and Edward Everett for Vice President.  It adopted no\r\nplatform, and owing to its neutrality of tint, its action had no\r\nsignificance aside from its possible effect on the result of the\r\nstruggle between the Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention met at Chicago on the sixteenth\r\nof May.  It was attended by immense numbers, and its action was\r\nregarded with profound and universal solicitude.  The platform of\r\nthe Convention affirmed the devotion of the party to the union of\r\nthe States and the rights of the States; denounced the new dogma\r\nthat the Constitution carried slavery into the Territories; declared\r\nfreedom to be their normal condition; denied the power of Congress\r\nor of a Territorial Legislature to give legal existence to slavery\r\nin any territory; branded as a crime the reopening of the African\r\nslave trade; condemned the heresy of Know-Nothingism, and demanded\r\nthe passage of a Homestead law.  The principles of the party were\r\nthus broadly stated and fully re-affirmed, and the issues of the\r\ncanvass very clearly presented.  The leading candidates were Seward\r\nand Lincoln, who pretty evenly divided the Convention, and thus\r\ncreated the liveliest interest in the result.  The friends of Mr.\r\nSeward had unbounded confidence in his nomination, and their devotion\r\nto his fortunes was intense and absolute.  The radical anti-slavery\r\nelement in the party idolized him, and longed for his success as\r\nfor a great and coveted national blessing.  The delegates from New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Illinois, representing a\r\nsuperficial and only half-developed Republicanism, labored with\r\nuntiring and exhaustless zeal for the nomination of Mr. Lincoln,\r\nfervently pleading for \"Success rather than Seward.\"  Henry S. Lane\r\nand Andrew G. Curtin, then candidates for Governor in the States\r\nof Indiana and Pennsylvania, respectively, were especially active\r\nand persistent, and their appeals were undoubtedly effective.  When\r\nSeward was defeated many an anti-slavery man poured out his tears\r\nover the result, while deploring or denouncing the conservatism of\r\nold fossil Whiggery, which thus sacrificed the ablest man in the\r\nparty, and the real hero of its principles.  Time, however, led\r\nthese men to reconsider their estimate both of Seward and Lincoln,\r\nand convinced them that the action of the convention, after all,\r\nwas for the best.  On the second ballot Hamlin was nominated for\r\nVice President over Clay, Banks, Hickman, and others, and the\r\nRepublican campaign thus auspiciously inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe canvass for Douglas was prosecuted with remarkable energy and\r\nzeal.  He was himself the great leader of his party on the stump,\r\nand his efforts evinced singular courage, audacity, and will.  It\r\nsoon became evident, however, that his election was impossible;\r\nbut this did not cool his ardor or relax his efforts.  He kept up\r\nthe fight to the end; and after his defeat, and when he saw the\r\npower that had destroyed him organizing its forces for the destruction\r\nof the Union, he espoused the side of his country, and never faltered\r\nin his course.  But as to slavery he seemed to have no conscience,\r\nregarding it as a matter of total moral indifference, and thus\r\ncompletely confounding the distinction between right and wrong.\r\nDuring the closing hours of his life he probably saw and lamented\r\nthis strange infatuation; and he must, at all events, have deplored\r\nthe obsequious and studied devotion of a life-time to the service\r\nof a power which at last demanded both the sacrifice of his country\r\nand himself.  The canvass for Lincoln was conducted by the ablest\r\nmen in the party, and was marked by great earnestness and enthusiasm.\r\nIt was a repetition of the Fremont campaign, with the added difference\r\nof a little more contrivance and spectacular display in its\r\ndemonstrations, as witnessed in the famous organization known as\r\nthe \"Wide-Awakes.\"  The doctrines of the Chicago platform were very\r\nthoroughly discussed, and powerfully contributed to the further\r\npolitical education of the people.  The speeches of Mr. Seward were\r\nsingularly able, effective and inspiring, and he was the acknowledged\r\nleader of his party and the idol of the Republican masses everywhere.\r\nThis was the day of his glory, and nothing yet foreshadowed the\r\npolitical eclipse which awaited him in the near future.  The triumph\r\nof the Republicans in this struggle was not, however, final.  A\r\ngreat work yet remained to be done.  A powerful anti-slavery party\r\nhad at last appeared, as the slow creation of events and the fruit\r\nof patient toil and endeavor; but it had against it a popular\r\nmajority of nearly a million.  Both Houses of Congress and the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States disputed its authority and\r\nopposed its advance.  The President-elect could not form his cabinet\r\nwithout the leave of the Senate, which was controlled by slavery,\r\nnor could he set the machinery of his Administration in motion, at\r\nhome or abroad, through the exercise of his appointing power,\r\nwithout the consent of his political opponents.  As Mr. Seward\r\ndeclared in the Senate, \"he could not appoint a minister or even\r\na police agent, negotiate a treaty or procure the passage of a law,\r\nand could hardly draw a musket from the public arsenal to defend\r\nhis own person.\"  The champions of slavery had no dream of surrender,\r\nand no excuse whatever for extreme measures; and with moderate\r\ncounsels and the prudent economy of their advantages, they were\r\nthe undoubted masters of their own fortunes for indefinite years\r\nto come.  But their extravagant and exasperating demands, and the\r\nsplendid madness of their latter day tactics as illustrated in\r\ntheir warfare against Douglas, were the sure presages of their\r\noverthrow.  There was method in their madness, but it was the method\r\nof self-destruction.  This was made still more strikingly manifest\r\nduring the months immediately preceding the inauguration of Mr.\r\nLincoln.  The Republicans, notwithstanding their great victory, so\r\nrecoiled from the thought of sectional strife that for the sake of\r\npeace they were ready to forego their demand for the Congressional\r\nprohibition of slavery in the Territories.  They were willing to\r\nabide by the Dred Scott decision and the enforcement of the Fugitive\r\nSlave law.  They even proposed a Constitutional amendment which\r\nwould have made slavery perpetual in the Republic; but the pampered\r\nfrenzy of the slave oligarchy defied all remedies, and hurried it\r\nheadlong into the bloody conspiracy which was to close forever its\r\ncareer of besotted lawlessness and crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE WAR.\r\nVisit to Mr. Lincoln--Closing months of Mr. Buchanan's Administration\r\n--Efforts to avoid war--Character of Buchanan--Lincoln's Inauguration\r\n--His war policy--The grand army of office seekers--The July session\r\nof Congress--The atmosphere of Washington--Battle of Bull Run--\r\nApologetic resolve of Congress--First confiscation act--Regular\r\nsession of Congress--Secretary Cameron--Committee on the conduct\r\nof the war--Its conference with the President and his Cabinet--\r\nSecretary Stanton and General McClellan--Order to march upon\r\nManassas.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1861, I paid a visit to Mr. Lincoln at his home\r\nin Springfield.  I had a curiosity to see the famous \"rail splitter,\"\r\nas he was then familiarly called, and as a member-elect of the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress I desired to form some acquaintance with\r\nthe man who was to play so conspicuous a part in the impending\r\nnational crisis.  Although I had zealously supported him in the\r\ncanvass, and was strongly impressed by the grasp of thought and\r\naptness of expression which marked his great debate with Douglas,\r\nyet as a through-going Free Soiler and a member of the radical wing\r\nof Republicanism, my prepossessions were against him.  He was a\r\nKentuckian, and a conservative Whig, who had supported General\r\nTaylor in 1848, and General Scott four years later, when the Whig\r\nparty finally sacrificed both its character and its life on the\r\naltar of slavery.  His nomination, moreover, had been secured\r\nthrough the diplomacy of conservative Republicans, whose morbid\r\ndread of \"abolitionism\" unfitted them, as I believed, for leadership\r\nin the battle with slavery which had now become inevitable, while\r\nthe defeat of Mr. Seward had been to me a severe disappointment\r\nand a real personal grief.  The rumor was also current, and generally\r\ncredited, that Simon Cameron and Caleb B. Smith were to be made\r\nCabinet Ministers, in recognition of the important services rendered\r\nby the friends of these gentlemen in the Chicago Convention.  Still,\r\nI did not wish to do Mr. Lincoln the slightest injustice, while I\r\nhoped and believed his courage and firmness would prove equal to\r\nthe emergency.\r\n\r\nOn meeting him I found him far better looking than the campaign\r\npictures had represented.  His face, when lighted up in conversation,\r\nwas not unhandsome, and the kindly and winning tones of his voice\r\npleaded for him like the smile which played about his rugged\r\nfeatures.  He was full of anecdote and humor, and readily found\r\nhis way to the hearts of those who enjoyed a welcome to his fireside.\r\nHis face, however, was sometimes marked by that touching expression\r\nof sadness which became so generally noticeable in the following\r\nyears.  On the subject of slavery I was gratified to find him less\r\nreserved and more emphatic than I expected.  The Cabinet rumor\r\nreferred to was true.  He felt bound by the pledges which his\r\nleading friends had made in his name pending the National Convention;\r\nand the policy on which he acted in these and many other appointments\r\nwas forcibly illustrated on a subsequent occasion, when I earnestly\r\nprotested against the appointment of an incompetent and unworthy\r\nman as Commissioner of Patents.  \"There is much force in what you\r\nsay,\" said he, \"but, in the balancing of matters, I guess I shall\r\nhave to appoint him.\"  This \"balancing of matters\" was a source of\r\ninfinite vexation during his administration, as it has been to\r\nevery one of his successors; and its most deplorable results have\r\nbeen witnessed in the assassination of a president.  Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, I was much pleased with our first Republican Executive,\r\nand I returned home more fully inspired than ever with the purpose\r\nto sustain him to the utmost in facing the duties of his great\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe closing months of Mr. Buchanan's Administration were dismal\r\nand full of apprehension.  One by one the slaveholding States were\r\nseceding from the Union.  The President, in repeated messages,\r\ndenied their right to secede, but denied also the right of the\r\nGovernment to coerce them into obedience.  It should be remembered,\r\nto his credit, that he did insist upon the right to enforce the\r\nexecution of the laws in all the States, and earnestly urged upon\r\nCongress the duty of arming him with the power to do this; but\r\nCongress, much to its discredit, paid no attention to his wishes,\r\nleaving the new Administration wholly unprepared for the impending\r\nemergency, while strangely upbraiding the retiring President for\r\nhis non-action.  For this there could be no valid excuse.  The\r\npeople of the Northern States, now that the movement in the South\r\nwas seen to be something more than mere bluster, were equally\r\nalarmed and bewildered.  The \"New York Herald\" declared that\r\n\"coercion, if it were possible, is out of the question.\"  The\r\n\"Albany Argus\" condemned it as \"madness.\"  The \"Albany Evening\r\nJournal\" and many other leading organs of Republicanism, East and\r\nWest, disowned it, and counseled conciliation and further concessions\r\nto the demands of slavery.  The \"New York Tribune\" emphatically\r\ncondemned the policy of coercion, and even after the cotton States\r\nhad formed their Confederacy and adopted a provisional Government,\r\nit declared that \"whenever it shall be clear that the great body\r\nof the Southern people have become conclusively alienated from the\r\nUnion and anxious to escape from it, we will do our best to forward\r\ntheir views.\"  The \"Tribune\" had before declared that \"whenever a\r\nconsiderable section of our Union shall deliberately resolve to go\r\nout, we shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep it in.\r\nWe hope never to live in a Republic whereof one section is pinned\r\nto the other by bayonets.\"  It is true, that it justified the\r\nsecession of the Southern States as a revolutionary right; but\r\nalthough these States defended it as a constitutional one, the\r\nbroader and higher ground of Mr. Greeley necessarily gave powerful\r\naid and comfort to their movement.  In the meantime, great meetings\r\nin Philadelphia and New York strongly condemned the Abolitionists,\r\nand urged the most extravagant additional concessions to slavery\r\nfor the sake of peace.  On the 12th of January Mr. Seward made his\r\ngreat speech in the Senate, declaring that he could \"afford to meet\r\nprejudice with conciliation, exaction with concession which surrenders\r\nno principle, and violence with the right hand of peace.\"  He was\r\nwilling to give up Congressional prohibition of slavery in the\r\nTerritories, enforce the Fugitive Slave law, and perpetuate slavery\r\nin our Republic by amending the Constitution for that purpose.\r\nThe Crittenden compromise, which practically surrendered everything\r\nto slavery, only failed in the Senate by one vote, and this failure\r\nresulted from the non-voting of six rebel senators, who were so\r\nperfectly devil-bent upon the work of national dismemberment that\r\nthey would not listen to any terms of compromise, or permit their\r\nadoption.  The Peace Congress, assembled for the purpose of devising\r\nsome means of national pacification, agreed upon a series of measures\r\ncovering substantially the same ground as the Crittenden compromise,\r\nwhile both Houses of Congress agreed to a constitutional amendment\r\ndenying any power to interfere with slavery \"until every State in\r\nthe Union, by its individual State action, shall consent to its\r\nexercise.\"  The feverish dread of war which prevailed throughout\r\nthe Northern States was constantly aggravated by multiplying\r\nevidences of slaveholding desperation.  The general direction of\r\npublic opinion pointed to the Abolitionists as the authors of these\r\nnational troubles, while the innocent and greatly-abused slaveholders\r\nwere to be petted and placated by any measures which could possibly\r\nserve their purpose.  Indeed, the spirit of Northern submission\r\nhad never, in the entire history of the anti-slavery conflict, been\r\nmore strikingly exhibited than during the last days of the Thirty-\r\nsixth Congress, when the Capital of the Republic was threatened by\r\narmed treason, and the President-elect reached Washington in a\r\ndisguise which baffled the assassins who had conspired against his\r\nlife.  To the very last the old medicine of compromise and conciliation\r\nseemed to be the sovereign hope of the people of the free States;\r\nand although it had failed utterly, and every offer of friendship\r\nand peace had been promptly spurned as the evidence of weakness or\r\ncowardice, they clung to it till the guns of Fort Sumter roused\r\nthem from their perilous dream.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of the President was awaited with great anxiety\r\nand alarm.  The capture of Washington by the rebels was seriously\r\napprehended, and had undoubtedly been meditated.  The air was filled\r\nwith rumors respecting the assassination of the President, and the\r\nstories told of the various methods of his taking off would have\r\nbeen amusing if the crisis had not been so serious.  General Scott\r\ntook all the precautions for the preservation of the peace which\r\nthe small force at his command, and the District militia, enabled\r\nhim to do.  The day was beautiful, and the procession to the Capitol\r\nquite imposing.  Mr. Lincoln and ex-President Buchanan entered the\r\nSenate chamber arm in arm; and the latter was so withered and bowed\r\nwith age that in contrast with the towering form of Mr. Lincoln he\r\nseemed little more than half a man.  The crowd which greeted the\r\nPresident in front of the east portico of the Capitol was immense,\r\nand has never been equaled on any similar occasion with the single\r\nexception of General Garfield's inauguration.  Mr. Lincoln's voice,\r\nthough not very strong or full-toned, rang out over the acres of\r\npeople before him with surprising distinctness, and was heard in\r\nthe remotest parts of his audience.  The tone of moderation,\r\ntenderness, and good-will, which marked his address, made an evident\r\nimpression, and the most heartfelt plaudits were called forth by\r\nthe closing passage:\r\n\r\n\"We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not be enemies.  Though\r\npassion may have strained, it must not break, our bonds of affection.\r\nThe mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and\r\npatriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this\r\nbroad land, will yet swell the chorus of union, when again touched,\r\nas they surely will be, by the better angels of their nature.\"\r\n\r\nBut as an offering of friendship and fair dealing to the South,\r\nthis speech failed of its purpose as signally as all kindred\r\nendeavors had done from the beginning.  The \"Richmond Enquirer\"\r\nand \"Whig,\" the \"Charleston Mercury,\" and other leading organs of\r\nsecession, denounced the inaugural, and seemed to be maddened by\r\nthe very kindliness of its tone and the moderation of its demands.\r\nTheir purpose was disunion and war, and every passing day multiplied\r\nthe proofs that no honorable escape from this fearful alternative\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the new Administration prior to the attack upon Sumter\r\nforms perhaps the most remarkable chapter in the history of the\r\nwar.  All the troubles of the previous Administration were now\r\nturned over to Mr. Lincoln, and while no measures had been provided\r\nto aid him in their settlement the crisis was constantly becoming\r\nmore imminent.  The country was perfectly at sea; and while all\r\nhope of reconciliation was fading from day to day, Mr. Seward\r\ninsisted that peace would come within \"sixty days.\"  His optimism\r\nwould have been most amusing, if the salvation of the country had\r\nnot been at stake.  The President himself not only still hoped,\r\nbut believed, that there would be no war; and notwithstanding all\r\nthe abuse that had been heaped upon Mr. Buchanan by the Republicans\r\nfor his feeble and vacillating course, and especially his denial\r\nof the right of the government to coerce the recusant States, the\r\npolicy of the new Administration, up to the attack upon Sumter,\r\nwas identical with that of his predecessor.  In Mr. Seward's official\r\nletter to Mr. Adams, dated April 10, 1861, he says the President\r\n\"would not be disposed to reject a cardinal dogma of theirs (the\r\nsecessionists), namely, that the Federal Government could not reduce\r\nthe seceding States to obedience through conquest, even though he\r\nwere disposed to question that proposition.  But in fact the\r\nPresident willingly accepts it as true.  Only and imperial and\r\ndespotic Government could subjugate thoroughly disaffected and\r\ninsurrectionary members of the State. * * * The President, on the\r\none hand, will not suffer the Federal authority to fall into\r\nabeyance, nor will he, on the other hand, aggravate existing evils\r\nby attempts at coercion, which must assume the direct form of war\r\nagainst any of the revolutionary States.\"  These are very remarkable\r\navowals, in the light of the absolute unavoidableness of the conflict\r\nat the time they were made; and they naturally tended to precipitate\r\nrather than avert the threatened catastrophe.  It will not do to\r\nsay that Secretary Seward spoke only for himself, and not for the\r\nAdministration; for the fact has since been established by the\r\nevidence of other members of the Cabinet that Mr. Lincoln, while\r\nhe had great faith in Mr. Seward at first, was always himself the\r\nPresident.  No member of it was his dictator.  I do not say that\r\nhe endorsed all Mr. Seward's peculiar views, for the latter went\r\nstill further, as the country has since learned, and favored the\r\nabandonment of Fort Sumter and other Southern forts, as a part of\r\na scheme of pacification looking to an amendment to the Constitution\r\nin the interest of slavery.  During this early period Mr. Chase\r\nhimself, with all his anti-slavery radicalism and devotion to the\r\nUnion, became so far the child of the hour as to deprecate the\r\npolicy of coercion and express his belief that if the rebel States\r\nwere allowed to go in peace they would soon return.  But \"war\r\nlegislates,\" and the time had now come when nothing else could\r\nbreak the spell of irresolution and blindness which threatened the\r\nUnion even more seriously than armed treason itself.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this strange epoch of Republican feebleness and\r\nindecision, the warfare against Mr. Buchanan was never intermitted.\r\nIt had been prosecuted with constantly increasing vigor since the\r\nyear 1856, and had now become so perfectly relentless and overwhelming\r\nthat he was totally submerged by the waves of popular wrath; and\r\nfor twenty odd years no political resurrection has been thought\r\npossible.  Although his personal integrity was as unquestionable\r\nas that of John C. Calhoun or George III, and his private life as\r\nstainless, yet his public character has received no quarter from\r\nhis enemies and but little defense from his friends.  One of his\r\nmost formidable critics, writing long years after the war, describes\r\nhim as \"hungry for regard, influence, and honor, but too diminutive\r\nin intellect and character to feel the glow of true ambition--a\r\nman made, so to speak, to be neither loved nor hated, esteemed nor\r\ndespised, slighted nor admired; intended to play an influential\r\npart in the agitation of parties, and by history to be silently\r\nnumbered with the dead, because in all his doings there was not a\r\nsingle deed; a man to whom fate could do nothing worse than place\r\nhim at the helm in an eventful period.\"  While there is a measure\r\nof truth in this picture, I believe any fair-minded man will\r\npronounce it over-drawn, one-sided, and unjust, after reading the\r\nrecently published life of Mr. Buchanan by George Ticknor Curtis,\r\ndealing fully with his entire public career in the clear, cold\r\nlight of historic facts.  The most pronounced political foe of Mr.\r\nBuchanan can not go over the pages of this elaborate and long-delayed\r\ndefense without modifying some of his most decided opinions; but\r\none thing remains obviously true, and that is in dealing with the\r\nquestion of slavery Mr. Buchanan was wholly without a conscience.\r\nThe thought seems never to have dawned upon him that the slave was\r\na man, and therefore entitled to his natural rights.  In a public\r\nspeech on the ninth of July, 1860, defining his position, and\r\nreferring to the Dred Scott decision, he says:  \"It is to me the\r\nmost extraordinary thing in the world that this country should now\r\nbe distracted and divided because certain persons at the North will\r\nnot agree that their brethren at the South should have the same\r\nrights in the Territories which they enjoy.  What would I, as a\r\nPennsylvanian, say or do, supposing any one was to contend that the\r\nLegislature of any Territory could outlaw iron or coal within the\r\nTerritory?  The principle is precisely the same.  The Supreme Court\r\nof the United States has decided, what was known to us all to have\r\nbeen the existing state of affairs for fifty years, that slaves\r\nare property.  Admit that fact, and you admit everything.\"\r\n\r\nIn this passage, as in all that he has written on the subject of\r\nslavery, humanity is totally ignored.  The right of property in\r\nman is just as sacred to him, \"as a Pennsylvanian,\" as the right\r\nof property in iron or coal.  He unhesitatingly accepts the Dred\r\nScott decision as law, which the moral sense of the nation and its\r\nablest jurists pronounced a nullity.  Mr. Jefferson, in speaking\r\nof slavery, said he trembled for his country, and declared that\r\none hour of bondage is fraught with more misery than whole ages of\r\nour colonial oppression.  Such a sentiment in the mouth of Mr.\r\nBuchanan would have been as unnatural as a voice from the dead.\r\nHe saw nothing morally offensive in slavery, or repugnant to the\r\nprinciples of Democracy.  He reverenced the Constitution, but always\r\nforgot that its compromises were agreed to in the belief that the\r\ninstitution was in a state of decay, and would soon wear out its\r\nlife under the pressure of public opinion and private interest.\r\nThroughout his public life he never faltered in his devotion to\r\nthe South, joining hands with alacrity in every measure which sought\r\nto nationalize her sectional interest.  The growing anti-slavery\r\nopinion of the free States, which no power could prevent, and the\r\ngreat moral currents of the times, which were as resistless as the\r\ntides of the sea, had no meaning for him, because the Democracy he\r\nbelieved in had no foundation in the sacredness of human rights.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, in spite of the troubled state of the country, was\r\nobliged to encounter an army of place-seekers at the very beginning\r\nof his administration.  I think there has been nothing like it in\r\nthe history of the Government.  A Republican member of Congress\r\ncould form some idea of the President's troubles from his own\r\nexperience.  I fled from my home in the later part of February, in\r\nthe hope of finding some relief from these importunities; but on\r\nreaching Washington I found the business greatly aggravated.  The\r\npressure was so great and constant that I could scarcely find time\r\nfor my meals, or to cross the street, and I was obliged to give my\r\ndays and nights wholly to the business, hoping in this way I should\r\nbe able in a while to finish it; but it constantly increased.  I\r\nmet at every turn a swarm of miscellaneous people, many of them\r\nlooking as hungry and fierce as wolves, and ready to pounce upon\r\nmembers as they passed, begging for personal intercession, letters\r\nof recommendation, etc.  During my stay in Washington through the\r\nmonths of March and April, there was no pause in this business.\r\nAfter Fort Sumter had been taken and the armory at Harper's Ferry\r\nhad been burned; after a Massachusetts regiment had been fired on\r\nin passing through Baltimore, and thirty thousand men were in\r\nWashington for defensive purposes; after the President had called\r\nfor seventy-five thousand volunteers, and the whole land was in a\r\nblaze of excitement, the scuffle for place was unabated, and the\r\npressure upon the strength and patience of the President unrelieved.\r\nThis was not very remarkable, considering the long-continued monopoly\r\nof the offices by the Democrats; but it jarred upon the sentiment\r\nof patriotism in such a crisis, and to those who were constantly\r\nbrought face to face with it, it sometimes appeared as if the love\r\nof office alone constituted the animating principle of the party.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled in special session on the Fourth of July,\r\nthe atmosphere of the Northern States had been greatly purified by\r\nthe attack on Fort Sumter.  The unavoidableness of war was now\r\nabsolute, and the tone of the President's message was far bolder\r\nand better than that of his inaugural.  The policy of tenderness\r\ntowards slavery, however, still revealed itself, and called forth\r\nthe criticism of the more radical Republicans.  They began to\r\ndistrust Mr. Seward, who no longer seemed to them the hero of\r\nprinciple they had so long idolized, while his growing indifference\r\nto the virtue of temperance was offensive to many.  He impressed\r\nhis old anti-slavery friends as a deeply disappointed man, who was\r\nin danger of being morally lost.  Their faith was even a _little_\r\nshaken in Secretary Chase.  Of course, they did not believe him\r\nfalse to his long-cherished anti-slavery convictions, but he was\r\namazingly ambitious, and in the dispensation of his patronage he\r\nseemed anxious to make fair weather with some of his old conservative\r\nfoes, while apparently forgetting the faithful friends who had\r\nstood by him from the very beginning of his career, and were\r\nconsidered eminently fit for the positions they sought.  The rumor\r\nwas afloat that even Charles Sumner was urging the claims of Mr.\r\nCrittenden to a place on the Supreme Bench, as a means of conciliating\r\nthe State of Kentucky.  Washington was largely a city of secessionists,\r\nand the departments of the Government were plentifully supplied by\r\nsympathizers with treason, while the effort put forth at this\r\nsession to dislodge them was not responded to by the Administration.\r\nWhat became known as the Border State policy was beginning to assert\r\nitself everywhere, and was strikingly illustrated in the capture\r\nof fugitive slaves and their return to their rebel masters by our\r\ncommanding generals, and by reiterated and gratuitous disavowals\r\nof \"abolitionism\" by prominent Republicans.\r\n\r\nBut the war spirit was fully aroused, and active preparations were\r\non foot for an advance upon the enemy.  The confidence in General\r\nScott seemed to be unbounded, and I found everybody taking it for\r\ngranted that when the fight began our forces would prove triumphantly\r\nvictorious.  On the day before the battle of Bull Run I obtained\r\na pass from General Scott, intending to witness the engagement,\r\nbelieving I could do so, of course, with perfect safety, as our\r\narmy would undoubtedly triumph.  I had a very strong curiosity to\r\nsee a great battle, and was now gratified with the prospect of\r\ndoing so; but a lucky accident detained me.  The battle was on\r\nSunday, and about eleven o'clock at night I was roused from my\r\nslumber by Col. Forney, who resided on Capitol Hill near my lodgings,\r\nand who told me our army had been routed, and that the rebels were\r\nmarching upon the capital and would in all probability capture it\r\nbefore morning.  No unmiraculous event could have been more startling.\r\nI was perfectly stunned and dumbfounded by the news; but I hastened\r\ndown to the Avenue as rapidly as possible, and found the space\r\nbetween the Capitol and the Treasury Building a moving mass of\r\nhumanity.  Every man seemed to be asking every man he met for the\r\nlatest news, while all sorts of rumors filled the air.  A feeling\r\nof mingled horror and despair appeared to possess everybody.  The\r\nevent was so totally unlooked for, and the disappointment so\r\nterrible, that people grew suddenly sick at heart, and felt as if\r\nlife itself, with all its interests and charms, had been snatched\r\nfrom their grasp.  The excitement, turmoil and consternation\r\ncontinued during the night and through the following day; but no\r\none could adequately picture or describe it.  Our soldiers came\r\nstraggling into the city, covered with dirt and many of them wounded,\r\nwhile the panic which led to the disaster spread like a contagion\r\nthrough all classes.\r\n\r\nOn the day following this battle Congress met as usual, and\r\nundoubtedly shared largely in the general feeling.  A little before\r\nthe battle General Mansfield had issued an order declaring that\r\nfugitive slaves would under no circumstances whatever be permitted\r\nto reside or be harbored in the quarters and camps of the troops\r\nserving in his department; and now, both Houses of Congress promptly\r\nand with great unanimity and studious emphasis declared that the\r\npurpose of the war was not the \"conquest\" or \"subjugation\" of the\r\nconspirators who were striking at the Nation's life, or the overthrow\r\nof their \"established institutions,\" but to defend \"the supremacy\r\nof the Constitution,\" and to \"preserve the Union\"; and that \"as\r\nsoon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease.\"\r\nTo through-going anti-slavery men this seemed like an apology for\r\nthe war, and a most ill-timed revival of the policy of conciliation,\r\nwhich had been so uniformly and contemptuously spurned by the enemy.\r\nIt failed utterly of its purpose, and this historic resolve of\r\nCongress was only useful to the rebels, who never failed to wield\r\nit as a weapon against us, after the teaching of events had compelled\r\nus to make slavery the point of attack.  The Confiscation Act of\r\nthe 6th of August was regarded as a child of the same sickly\r\nancestry.  The section of the Act making free the slaves employed\r\nagainst us by the rebels in their military operations was criticised\r\nas a bribe to them to fight us, rather than a temptation to espouse\r\nour cause.  If they engaged in the war at all, they were obliged\r\nto do so as our enemies; but if they remained at home on their\r\nplantations in the business of feeding the rebel armies, they would\r\nhave the protection of both the loyal and Confederate Governments.\r\nThe policy of both parties to the struggle was thus subordinated\r\nto the protection of slavery.\r\n\r\nBut on the 31st of August a new war policy was inaugurated by the\r\nproclamation of General Fremont, giving freedom to the slaves of\r\nrebels in his department.  It was greeted by the people of the\r\nNorthern States with inexpressible gladness and thanksgiving.  The\r\nRepublican press everywhere applauded it, and even such Democratic\r\nand conservative papers as the \"Boston Post,\" the \"Detroit Free\r\nPress,\" the \"Chicago Times,\" and the \"New York Herald\" approved\r\nit.  During the ten days of its life all party lines seemed to be\r\nobliterated in the fires of popular enthusiasm which it kindled,\r\nand which was wholly unprecedented in my experience.  I was then\r\non the stump in my own State, and I found the masses everywhere so\r\nwild with joy, that I could scarcely be heard for their shouts.\r\nAs often as I mentioned the name of \"Fremont,\" the prolonged hurrahs\r\nof the multitude followed, and the feeling seemed to be universal\r\nthat the policy of \"a war on peace principles\" was abandoned, and\r\nthat slavery, the real cause of the war, was no longer to be the\r\nchief obstacle to its prosecution.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of this great exultation and joy the President\r\nannulled the proclamation because it went beyond the Confiscation\r\nAct of the 6th of August, and was offensive to the Border States.\r\nIt was a terrible disappointment to the Republican masses, who\r\ncould not understand why loyal slaveholders in Kentucky should be\r\noffended because the slaves of rebels in Missouri were declared\r\nfree.  From this revocation of the new war policy, dated the pro-\r\nslavery reaction which at once followed.  It balked the popular\r\nenthusiasm which was drawing along with it multitudes of conservative\r\nmen.  It caused timid and halting men to become cowards outright.\r\nIt gave new life to slavery, and encouraged fiercer assaults upon\r\n\"abolitionism.\"  It revived and stimulated Democratic sympathy for\r\ntreason wherever it had existed, and necessarily prolonged the\r\nconflict and aggravated its sorrows; while it repeated the ineffable\r\nfolly of still relying upon a policy of moderation and conciliation\r\nin dealing with men who had defiantly taken their stand outside of\r\nthe Constitution and laws, and could only be reached by the power\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, the policy of deference to slavery\r\nstill continued.  The message of the President was singularly\r\ndispassionate, deprecating \"radical and extreme measures,\" and\r\nrecommending some plan of colonization for the slaves made free by\r\nthe Confiscation Act.  Secretary Cameron, however, surprised the\r\ncountry by the avowal of a decidedly anti-slavery war policy in\r\nhis report; but in a discussion in the House early in December, on\r\nGeneral Halleck's \"Order No. Three,\" I took occasion to expose his\r\ninsincerity by referring to his action a little while before in\r\nrestoring to her master a slave girl who had fled to the camp of\r\nColonel Brown, of the Twentieth Indiana regiment, who had refused\r\nto give her up.  On the nineteenth of December, a joint select\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War was appointed, composed of\r\nthree members of the Senate and four members of the House.  The\r\nSenators were B. F. Wade, of Ohio; Z. Chandler, of Michigan, and\r\nAndrew Johnson, of Tennessee; and the House members were John\r\nCovode, of Pennsylvania; M. F. Odell, of New York; D. W. Gooch, of\r\nMassachusetts, and myself.  The committee had its birth in the\r\npopular demand for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, and less\r\ntenderness toward slavery; and I was gratified with my position on\r\nit because it afforded a very desirable opportunity to learn\r\nsomething of the movements of our armies and the secrets of our\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of January, by special request of the President, the\r\ncommittee met him and his Cabinet at the Executive Mansion, to\r\nconfer about the military situation.  The most striking fact revealed\r\nby the discussion which took place was that neither the President\r\nnor his advisers seemed to have any definite information respecting\r\nthe management of the war, or the failure of our forces to make\r\nany forward movement.  Not a man of them pretended to know anything\r\nof General McClellan's plans.  We were greatly surprised to learn\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln himself did not think he had any _right_ to know,\r\nbut that, as he was not a military man, it was his duty to defer\r\nto General McClellan.  Our grand armies were ready and eager to\r\nmarch, and the whole country was anxiously waiting some decisive\r\nmovement; but during the delightful months of October, November\r\nand December, they had been kept idle for some reason which no man\r\ncould explain, but which the President thought could be perfectly\r\naccounted for by the General-in-Chief.  Secretary Cameron said he\r\nknew nothing of any plan for a forward movement.  Secretary Seward\r\nhad entire confidence in General McClellan, and thought the demand\r\nof the committee for a more vigorous policy uncalled for.  The\r\nPostmaster-General made no definite avowals, while the other members\r\nof the Cabinet said nothing, except Secretary Chase, who very\r\ndecidedly sympathized with the committee in its desire for some\r\nearly and decisive movement of our forces.  The spectacle seemed\r\nto us very disheartening.  The testimony of all the commanding\r\ngenerals we had examined showed that our armies had been ready to\r\nmarch for months; that the weather and roads had been most favorable\r\nsince October; and that the Army of the Potomac was in a fine state\r\nof discipline, and nearly two hundred thousand strong, while only\r\nabout forty thousand men were needed to make Washington perfectly\r\nsafe.  Not a general examined could tell why this vast force had\r\nso long been kept idle, or what General McClellan intended to do.\r\nThe fate of the nation seemed committed to one man called a \"General-\r\nin-Chief,\" who communicated his secrets to no human being, and who\r\nhad neither age nor military experience to justify the extraordinary\r\ndeference of the President to his wishes.  He had repeatedly appeared\r\nbefore the committee, though not yet as a witness, and we could\r\nsee no evidence of his pre-eminence over other prominent commanders;\r\nand it seemed like a betrayal of the country itself to allow him\r\nto hold our grand armies for weeks and months in unexplained\r\nidleness, on the naked assumption of his superior wisdom.  Mr.\r\nWade, as Chairman of the committee, echoed its views in a remarkably\r\nbold and vigorous speech, in which he gave a summary of the principal\r\nfacts which had come to the knowledge of the committee, arraigned\r\nGeneral McClellan for the unaccountable tardiness of his movements,\r\nand urged upon the Administration, in the most undiplomatic plainness\r\nof speech, an immediate and radical change in the policy of the\r\nwar.  But the President and his advisers could not yet be disenchanted,\r\nand the conference ended without results.\r\n\r\nWhen General McClellan was placed at the head of our armies the\r\ncountry accepted him as its idol and hero.  The people longed for\r\na great captain, and on very inadequate grounds they assumed that\r\nthey had found him, and that the business of war was to be carried\r\non in earnest.  But they were doomed to disappointment, and the\r\npopular feeling was at length completely reversed.  The pendulum\r\nvibrated to the other extreme, and it is not easy to realize the\r\nwide-spread popular discontent which finally revealed itself\r\nrespecting the dilatory movements of our forces.  The people became\r\ninexpressibly weary of the reiterated bulletins that \"all is quiet\r\non the Potomac\"; and the fact that General McClellan was in full\r\nsympathy with the Border State policy of the President aggravated\r\ntheir unfriendly mood.  A majority of the members of the committee\r\nbecame morbidly sensitive, and were practically incapable of doing\r\nGeneral McClellan justice.  They were thoroughly discouraged and\r\ndisgusted; but when Secretary Cameron left the Cabinet and Stanton\r\ntook his place, their despondency gave place to hope.  He had faith\r\nin the usefulness of the committee, and co-operated with it to the\r\nutmost.  He agreed with us fully in our estimate of General McClellan,\r\nand as to the necessity of an early forward movement.  We were\r\ndelighted with him, and had perfect confidence in his integrity,\r\nsagacity and strong will.  We worked from five to six hours per\r\nday, including the holiday season, and not excepting the Sabbath,\r\ngoing pretty thoroughly into the Bull Run disaster, the battle of\r\nBall's Bluff, and the management of the Western Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of January and February, the committee made\r\nrepeated visits to the President for the purpose of urging the\r\ndivision of the Army of the Potomac and its organization into army\r\ncorps.  We insisted upon this on the strength of the earnest\r\nrecommendations of our chief commanders, and with a view to greater\r\nmilitary efficiency; but the President said General McClellan was\r\nopposed to it, and would, he believed, resign his command in the\r\nalternative of being required to do it.  Mr. Lincoln said he dreaded\r\n\"the moral effect of this\"; but in the latter part of February, he\r\nbegan to lose his faith in the General, and finally, after nearly\r\ntwo months of perseverance by the committee, he gave his order\r\nearly in March, which General McClellan obeyed with evident hesitation\r\nand very great reluctance.  A few days later the long-tried patience\r\nof the President became perfectly exhausted.  He surprised and\r\ndelighted the committee by completely losing his temper, and on\r\nthe 11th relieved General McClellan from the command of all our\r\nforces except the Army of the Potomac.  The rebels, in the meantime,\r\nhad evacuated their works at Centreville and Manassas, and retreated\r\nwith their munitions in safety.  A majority of the committee at\r\nthis time strongly suspected that General McClellan was a traitor,\r\nand they felt strengthened in this suspicion by what they afterward\r\nsaw for themselves at Centreville and Manassas, which they visited\r\non the thirteenth of March.  They were certain, at all events, that\r\nhis heart was not in the work.  He had disregarded the President's\r\ngeneral order of the nineteenth of January, for a movement of all\r\nour armies, which resulted in the series of victories of Fort Henry,\r\nFort Donelson, etc., which so electrified the country.  He had\r\nprotested against the President's order of the thirty-first of\r\nJanuary, directing an expedition for the purpose of seizing a point\r\nupon the railroad southwest of Manassas Junction.  He had opposed\r\nall forward movements of the Army of the Potomac, and resolutely\r\nset his face against the division of our forces into army corps,\r\nas urged by all our chief commanders.  And he had again and again\r\nrefused to co-operate with the navy in breaking up the blockade of\r\nthe Potomac, while his order to move in the direction of the enemy\r\nat Centreville and Manassas was given after the evacuation of these\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nOur journey to Manassas was full of interest and excitement.  About\r\nten miles from Washington we came in sight of a large division of\r\nthe Grand Army of the Potomac, which had started toward the enemy\r\nin obedience to the order of General McClellan.  The forest on\r\neither side of the road was alive with soldiers, and their white\r\ntents were to be seen in all directions through the pine forests,\r\nwhile in the adjacent fields vast bodies of soldiers in their\r\nuniforms were marching and counter-marching, their bayonets glittering\r\nin the sunlight.  Large bodies of cavalry were also in motion, and\r\nthe air was filled with the sound of martial music and the blasts\r\nof the bugle.  Soldiers not on drill were running races, playing\r\nball, and enjoying themselves generally in every sort of sport.\r\nThe spectacle was delightfully exhilarating, and especially so to\r\nmen just released from the dreary confinement and drudgery of their\r\ncommittee rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE WAR (CONTINUED).\r\nThe wooden guns--Conference with Secretary Stanton--His relations\r\nto Lincoln--Strife between Radicalism and Conservatism--Passage of\r\nthe Homestead Law--Visit to the President--The Confiscation Act\r\nand rebel landowners--Greeley's \"prayer of twenty millions,\" and\r\nLincoln's reply--Effort to disband the Republican party--The battle\r\nof Fredericksburg and General Burnside--The Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation--Visit to Mr. Lincoln--General Fremont--Report of the\r\nWar Committee--Visit to Philadelphia and New York--Gerrit Smith--\r\nThe Morgan Raid.\r\n\r\nOn approaching Centreville the first object that attracted our\r\nattention was one of the huge earthworks of the enemy, with large\r\nlogs placed in the embrasures, the ends pointing toward us, and\r\npainted black in imitation of cannon.  The earthworks seemed very\r\nimperfectly constructed, and from this fact, and the counterfeit\r\nguns which surmounted them, it was evident that no fight had been\r\nseriously counted on by the absconding forces.  The substantial\r\ncharacter of their barracks, bake-ovens, stables, and other\r\nimprovements, confirmed this view; and on reaching Manassas we\r\nfound the same cheap defenses and the same evidences of security,\r\nwhile the rebel forces were much less than half as great as ours,\r\nand within a day's march from us.  What was the explanation of all\r\nthis?  Why had we not long before, driven in the rebel pickets,\r\nand given battle to the enemy, or at least ascertained the facts\r\nas to the weakness of his position?  Could the commander be loyal\r\nwho had opposed all the previous forward movements of our forces,\r\nand only made this advance after the enemy had evacuated?  These\r\nwere the questions canvassed by the members of the committee in\r\ntheir passionate impatience for decisive measures, and which they\r\nafterward earnestly pressed upon the President as a reason for\r\nrelieving General McClellan of his command.  They were also greatly\r\nmoved by the fact already referred to, that General McClellan had\r\nneglected and repeatedly refused to co-operate with the navy in\r\nbreaking up the blockade of the Potomac, which could have been done\r\nlong before according to the testimony of our commanders, while he\r\nhad disobeyed the positive order of the President respecting the\r\ndefenses of Washington by reserving only nineteen thousand imperfectly\r\ndisciplined men for that service, through which the capital had\r\nbeen placed at the mercy of the enemy.  Meanwhile the flame of\r\npopular discontent had found further fuel in the threats of McClellan\r\nto put down slave insurrections \"with an iron hand,\" and his order\r\nexpelling the Hutchinsons from the Army of the Potomac for singing\r\nWhittier's songs of liberty.  Of course I am not dealing with the\r\ncharacter and capacity of General McClellan as a commander, but\r\nsimply depicting the feeling which extensively prevailed at this\r\ntime, and which justified itself by hastily accepting merely apparent\r\nfacts as conclusive evidence against him.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th day of March, Secretary Stanton sent for the committee\r\nfor the purpose of having a confidential conference as to military\r\naffairs.  He was thoroughly discouraged.  He told us the President\r\nhad gone back to his first love as to General McClellan, and that\r\nit was needless for him or for us to labor with him, although he\r\nhad finally been prevailed on to restrict McClellan's command to\r\nthe Army of the Potomac.  The Secretary arraigned the General's\r\nconduct in the severest terms, particularizing his blunders, and\r\nbranding them.  He told us the President was so completely in the\r\npower of McClellan that he had recently gone to Alexandria in person\r\nto ask him for some troops from the Army of the Potomac for General\r\nFremont, which were refused.  He said he believed there were traitors\r\namong the commanders surrounding General McClellan, and if he had\r\nhad the power he would have dismissed eight commanders when the\r\nwooden-gun discovery was made; and he fully agreed with us as to\r\nthe disgraceful fact that our generals had not long before discovered,\r\nas they could have done, the real facts as to the rebel forces and\r\ntheir defences.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident from these facts that Stanton, with all his\r\nforce of will, did not rule the President, as the public has\r\ngenerally supposed.  He would frequently overawe and sometimes\r\nbrowbeat others, but he was never imperious in dealing with Mr.\r\nLincoln.  This I have from Mr. Watson, for some time Assistant\r\nSecretary of War, and Mr. Whiting, while Solicitor of the War\r\nDepartment.  Lincoln, however, had the highest opinion of Stanton,\r\nand their relations were always most kindly, as the following\r\nanecdote bears witness:  A committee of Western men, headed by\r\nLovejoy, procured from the President an important order looking to\r\nthe exchange and transfer of Eastern and Western soldiers with a\r\nview to more effective work.  Repairing to the office of the\r\nSecretary, Mr. Lovejoy explained the scheme, as he had before done\r\nto the President, but was met with a flat refusal.\r\n\r\n\"But we have the President's order, sir,\" said Lovejoy.\r\n\r\n\"Did Lincoln give you an order of that kind?\" said Stanton.\r\n\r\n\"He did, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"The he is a d----d fool,\" said the irate secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say the President is a d----d fool?\" asked Lovejoy,\r\nin amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, if he gave you such an order as that.\"\r\n\r\nThe bewildered Illinoisan betook himself at once to the President,\r\nand related the result of his conference.\r\n\r\n\"Did Stanton say I was a d----d fool?\" asked Lincoln at the close\r\nof the recital.\r\n\r\n\"He did, sir, and repeated it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's pause, and looking up, the President said, \"If\r\nStanton said I was a d----d fool, then I must be one, for he is\r\nnearly always right, and generally says what he means.  I will step\r\nover and see him.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this anecdote is literally true or not, it illustrates the\r\ncharacter of the two men.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the thirteenth of April, we were again summoned to meet\r\nSecretary Stanton, and he had also invited Thaddeus Stevens, of\r\nthe House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Fessenden, of the Senate\r\nFinance Committee, and Mr. Wilson and Colonel Blair, of the Senate\r\nand House Military Committees.  The business of this conference\r\nwas to consider the necessity of immediate measures for raising\r\nthirty million dollars to pay the troops unwisely accepted by the\r\nPresident in excess of the number called for by Congress, and the\r\nproper action to be taken relative to the sale of Austrian guns by\r\na house in New York for shipment to the enemy.  The Secretary was\r\nthis time in fine spirits, and I was much interested in the free\r\ntalk which occurred.  Mr. Stevens indulged in his customary bluntness\r\nof speech, including a little spice of profanity by way of emphasis\r\nand embellishment.  He declared that not a man in the Cabinet, the\r\npresent company excepted, was fit for his business.  Mr. Fessenden\r\nsaid he fully endorsed this, while sly glances were made to Colonel\r\nBlair, whose brother was thus palpably hit.  Mr. Stevens said he\r\nwas tired of hearing d----d Republican cowards talk about the\r\nConstitution; that there _was_ no Constitution any longer so far\r\nas the prosecution of the war was concerned; and that we should\r\nstrip the rebels of all their rights, and given them a reconstruction\r\non such terms as would end treason forever.  Secretary Stanton\r\nagreed to every word of this, and said it had been his policy from\r\nthe beginning.  Fessenden denounced slave-catching in our army,\r\nand referred to a recent case in which fugitives came to our lines\r\nwith most valuable information as to rebel movements, and were\r\nordered out of camp into the clutches of their hunters.  Stanton\r\nsaid that ten days before McClellan marched toward Manassas,\r\ncontrabands had come to him with the information that the rebels\r\nwere preparing to retreat, but that McClellan said he could not\r\ntrust them.  Wade was now roused, and declared that he had heard\r\nMcClellan say he had uniformly found the statements of these people\r\nreliable, and had got valuable information from them.  But McClellan\r\nwas still king, and the country was a long way yet from that vigorous\r\nwar policy which alone could save it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the strife between the radical and conservative\r\nelements in the Republican party found expression in other directions.\r\nSecretary Seward, in his letter to Mr. Dayton, of the 22d of April,\r\ndeclared that \"the rights of the States and the condition of every\r\nhuman being in them will remain subject to exactly the same laws\r\nand forms of administration, whether the revolution shall succeed\r\nof whether it shall fail.\"  Secretary Smith had previously declared,\r\nin a public speech, that \"this is not a war upon the institution\r\nof slavery, but a war for the restoration of the Union,\" and that\r\n\"there could not be found in South Carolina a man more anxious,\r\nreligiously and scrupulously, to observe all the features of the\r\nConstitution, than Abraham Lincoln.\"  He also opposed the arming\r\nof the negroes, declaring that \"it would be a disgrace to the people\r\nof the free States to call upon four millions of blacks to aid in\r\nputting down eight millions of whites.\"  Similar avowals were made\r\nby other members of the Cabinet.  This persistent purpose of the\r\nAdministration to save the Union and save slavery with it, naturally\r\nprovoked criticism, and angered the anti-slavery feeling of the\r\nloyal States.  The business of slave-catching in the army continued\r\nthe order of the day, till the pressure of public opinion finally\r\ncompelled Congress to prohibit it by a new article of war, which\r\nwas approved by the President on the 13th of March.  The repressive\r\npower of the Administration, however, was very formidable, and\r\nalthough the House of Representatives, as early as the 20th of\r\nDecember, 1861, had adopted a resolution offered by myself,\r\ninstructing the Judiciary Committee to report a bill so amending\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 as to forbid the return of fugitives\r\nwithout proof first made of the loyalty of the claimant, yet on\r\nthe 26th of May, 1862, the House, then overwhelmingly Republican,\r\nvoted down a bill declaring free the slaves of armed rebels, and\r\nmaking proof of loyalty by the claimant of a fugitive necessary to\r\nhis recovery.  This vote sorely disappointed the anti-slavery\r\nsentiment of the country.  On this measure I addressed the House\r\nin a brief speech, the spirit of which was heartily responded to\r\nby my constituents and the people of the loyal States generally.\r\nThey believed in a vigorous prosecution of the war, and were sick\r\nof \"the never-ending gabble about the sacredness of the Constitution.\"\r\n\"It will not be forgotten,\" I said, \"that the red-handed murderers\r\nand thieves who set this rebellion on foot went out of the Union\r\nyelping for the Constitution which they had conspired to overthrow\r\nby the blackest perjury and treason that ever confronted the\r\nAlmighty.\"  This speech was the key-note of my approaching\r\nCongressional canvass, and I was one of the very few men of decided\r\nanti-slavery convictions who were able to stem the conservative\r\ntide which swept over the Northern States during this dark and\r\ndismal year.  I had against me the general drift of events; the\r\nintense hostility of Governor Morton and his friends throughout\r\nthe State; nearly all the politicians in the District, and nine of\r\nits twelve Republican newspapers, and the desperate energy and\r\ncunning of trained leaders in both political parties, who had\r\npursued me like vultures for a dozen years.  My triumph had no\r\ntaint of compromise in it, and nothing saved me but perfect courage\r\nand absolute defiance of my foes.\r\n\r\nOne of the great compensations of the war was the passage of the\r\nHomestead Act of the 20th of May.  It finally passed the House and\r\nSenate by overwhelming majorities.  Among the last acts of Mr.\r\nBuchanan's administration was the veto of a similar measure, at\r\nthe bidding of his Southern masters; and the friends of the policy\r\nhad learned in the struggle of a dozen years that its success was\r\nnot possible while slavery ruled the government.  The beneficent\r\noperation of this great and far-reaching measure, however, was\r\nseriously crippled by some unfortunate facts.  In the first place,\r\nit provided no safeguards against speculation in the public domain,\r\nwhich had so long scourged the Western States and Territories, and\r\nwas still extending its ravages.  Our pioneer settlers were offered\r\nhomes of one hundred and sixty acres each on condition of occupancy\r\nand improvement, but the speculator could throw himself across\r\ntheir track by buying up large bodies of choice land to be held\r\nback from settlement and tillage for a rise in price, and thus\r\nforce them further into the frontier, and on to less desirable\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, under the new and unguarded land-grant policy,\r\nwhich was simultaneously inaugurated, millions of acres fell into\r\nthe clutches of monopolists, and are held by them to-day, which\r\nwould have gone to actual settlers under the Homestead law, and\r\nthe moderate land grant policy originated by Senator Douglas in\r\n1850.  This was not foreseen or intended.  The nation was then\r\nengaged in a struggle for its existence, and thus exposed to the\r\nevils of hasty legislation.  The value of the lands given away was\r\nnot then understood as it has been since, while the belief was\r\nuniversal that the lands granted would be restored to the public\r\ndomain on failure to comply with the conditions of the grants.\r\nThe need of great highways to the Pacific was then regarded as\r\nimperative, and unattainable without large grants of the public\r\nlands.  These are extenuating facts; but the mischiefs of this ill-\r\nstarred legislation are none the less to be deplored.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, under our new Indian treaty policy, invented\r\nabout the same time, large bodies of land, when released by our\r\nIndian tribes, were sold at low rates to individual speculators\r\nand monopolists, or to railway corporations, instead of being\r\nconveyed, as before, to the United States, and thus subjected to\r\ngeneral disposition, as other public land.  These evils are now\r\nremedied, but for nearly ten years they were unchecked.  The title\r\nto Indian lands was secured through treaties concocted by a ring\r\nof speculators and monopolists outside of the Senate, and frequently\r\nratified by that body near the close of a long session, when less\r\nthan half a dozen members were in their seats, and the entire\r\nbusiness was supervised by a single Western senator acting as the\r\nagent of his employers and the sharer in their plunder.  These\r\nfatal mistakes in our legislation have made the Homestead law a\r\nhalf-way measure, instead of that complete reform in our land policy\r\nwhich was demanded, and they furnish a remarkable commentary upon\r\nthe boasted friendship of the Republican party for the landless\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nThe conservative war-policy of the Administration continued to\r\nassert itself.  The action of the President in promptly revoking\r\nthe order of General Hunter, of the ninth of May, declaring free\r\nthe slaves of the States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina,\r\naggravated the growing impatience of the people.  On the ninth day\r\nof June I submitted a resolution instructing the judiciary committee\r\nto report a bill repealing the Fugitive Slave Act, which was laid\r\non the table by a vote of sixty-six to fifty-one, sixteen Republicans\r\nvoting in the affirmative.  On the second of July I called to see\r\nthe President, and had a familiar talk about the war.  He looked\r\nthin and haggard, but seemed cheerful.  Although our forces were\r\nthen engaged in a terrific conflict with the enemy near Richmond,\r\nand everybody was anxious as to the result, he was quite as placid\r\nas usual, and could not resist his \"ruling passion\" for anecdotes.\r\nIf I had judged him by appearances I should have pronounced him\r\nincapable of any deep earnestness of feeling; but his manner was\r\nso kindly, and so free from the ordinary crookedness of the politician\r\nand the vanity and self-importance of official position, that\r\nnothing but good-will was inspired by his presence.  He was still\r\nholding fast his faith in General McClellan, and this was steadily\r\nwidening the breach between him and Congress, and periling the\r\nsuccess of the war.  The general gloom in Washington increased till\r\nthe adjournment, but Mr. Sumner still had faith in the President,\r\nand prophesied good things as to his final action.\r\n\r\nThe Confiscation Act of this session, which was approved by the\r\nPresident on the seventeenth day of July, providing that slaves of\r\nrebels coming into our lines should be made free, and that the\r\nproperty of their owners, both real and personal, should be\r\nconfiscated, would have given great and wide-spread satisfaction;\r\nbut the President refused to sign the bill without a modification\r\nfirst made exempting the fee of rebel land-owners from its operation,\r\nthus powerfully aiding them in their deadly struggle against us.\r\nThis action was inexpressibly provoking; but Congress was obliged\r\nto make the modification required, as the only means of securing\r\nthe important advantages of other features of the measure.  This\r\nanti-republican discrimination between real and personal property\r\nwhen the nation was struggling for its life against a rebellious\r\naristocracy founded on the monopoly of land and the ownership of\r\nnegroes, roused a popular opposition which thus far was altogether\r\nunprecedented.  The feeling in Congress, however, was far more\r\nintense than throughout the country.  No one at a distance could\r\nhave formed any adequate conception of the hostility of Republican\r\nmembers toward Mr. Lincoln at the final adjournment, while it was\r\nthe belief of many that our last session of Congress had been held\r\nin Washington.  Mr. Wade said the country was going to hell, and\r\nthat the scenes witnessed in the French Revolution were nothing in\r\ncomparison with what we should see here.\r\n\r\nJust before leaving Washington I called on the President again,\r\nand told him I was going to take the stump, and to tell the people\r\nthat he would co-operate with Congress in vigorously carrying out\r\nthe measures we had inaugurated for the purpose of crushing the\r\nrebellion, and that now the quickest and hardest blows were to be\r\ndealt.  He told me I was authorized to say so, but said that more\r\nthan half the popular clamor against the management of the war was\r\nunwarranted; and when I referred to the movements of General\r\nMcClellan he made no committal in any way.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of August Horace Greeley wrote his famous anti-\r\nslavery letter to the President, entitled \"The Prayer of Twenty\r\nMillions.\"  It was one of the most powerful appeals ever made in\r\nbehalf of justice and the rights of man.  In his reply Mr. Lincoln\r\nsaid:  \"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I\r\nwould do it; if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would\r\ndo it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others\r\nalone, I would do that.\"  These words served as fresh fuel to the\r\nfires of popular discontent, and they were responded to by Mr.\r\nGreeley with admirable vigor and earnestness.  The anti-slavery\r\ncritics of the President insisted that in thus dealing with slavery\r\nas a matter of total indifference he likened himself to Douglas,\r\nwho had declared that he didn't care whether slavery was voted up\r\nor voted down in the Territories.  They argued that as slavery was\r\nthe cause of the war and the obstacle to peace, it was the duty of\r\nthe Government to lay hold of the conscience of the quarrel, and\r\nstrike at slavery as the grand rebel.  Not to do so, they contended,\r\nnow that the opportunity was offered, was to make the contest a\r\nmere struggle for power, and thus to degrade it to the level of\r\nthe wars of the Old World, which bring with them nothing for freedom\r\nor the race.  They insisted that the failure of the Government to\r\ngive freedom to our millions in bondage would be a crime only to\r\nbe measured by that of putting them in chains if they were free.\r\nThey reminded the President of his declaration that a house divided\r\nagainst itself can not stand, and that the Republic can not\r\npermanently exist half slave and half free; and they urged that\r\nthis baptism of fire and blood would be impious if the cause which\r\nproduced it should be spared to canker the heart of the nation\r\nanew, and repeat its diabolical deeds.  A Union with slavery spared\r\nand reinstated would not be worth the cost of saving it.  To argue\r\nthat we were fighting for a political abstraction called the Union,\r\nand not for the destruction of slavery, was to affront common sense,\r\nsince nothing but slavery had brought the Union into peril, and\r\nnothing could make sure the fruits of the war but the removal of\r\nits cause.  It was to delude ourselves with mere phrases, and\r\nconduct the war on false pretenses.  It was to rival the folly of\r\nthe rebels, who always asservated that they were not fighting for\r\nslavery, but only for the right of local self government, when the\r\nwhole world knew the contrary.  These ideas, variously presented\r\nand illustrated, found manifold expression in innumerable Congressional\r\nspeeches and in the newspapers of the Northern States, and a month\r\nlater brought forth the President's proclamation of the twenty-\r\nsecond of September, giving the insurgents notice that on the first\r\nday of January following he would issue his proclamation of general\r\nemancipation, if they did not in the meantime lay down their arms.\r\nThe course of events and the pressure of opinion were at last\r\nforcing him to see that the nation was wrestling with slavery in\r\narms; that its destruction was not a debatable and distant alternative,\r\nbut a pressing and absolute necessity; and that his Border State\r\npolicy, through which he had so long tried to pet and please the\r\npower that held the nation by the throat, was a cruel and fatal\r\nmistake.  This power, however, had so completely woven itself into\r\nthe whole fabric of American society and institutions, and had so\r\nlong fed upon the virtue of our public men, that the Administration\r\nwas not yet prepared to divorce itself entirely from the madness\r\nthat still enthralled the conservative element of the Republican\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIt was during this year that a formidable effort was made by the\r\nold Whig element in the Republican party to disband the organization\r\nand form a new one, called the \"Union party.\"  They were disposed\r\nto blame the Abolitionists for the halting march of events, and to\r\nrun away from the real issues of the conflict.  They were believers\r\nin the Border State policy, and favored the colonization of the\r\nnegroes, while deprecating \"radical and extreme measures.\"  They\r\nforgot that the Republican principle was as true in the midst of\r\nwar as in seasons of peace, and that instead of putting it in\r\nabeyance when the storm came, we should cling to it with redoubled\r\nenergy and purpose.  They forgot that the contest of 1860 was not\r\nonly a struggle between slavery and freedom, but a struggle of life\r\nand death, inasmuch as the exclusion of slavery from all federal\r\nterritory would not only put the nation's brand upon it in the\r\nStates of the South, and condemn it as a public enemy, but virtually\r\nsentence it to death.  They forgot that the charge of \"abolitionism,\"\r\nwhich was incessantly hurled at the Republican party, was thus by\r\nno means wanting in essential truth, and that when the slaveholders\r\nwere vanquished in the election of Mr. Lincoln, their appeal from\r\nthe ballot to the bullet was the logical result of their insane\r\ndevotion to slavery, and their conviction that nothing could save\r\nit but the dismemberment of the Republic.  They forgot that the\r\nRebellion was simply an advanced stage of slaveholding rapacity,\r\nand that instead of tempting us to cower before it and surrender\r\nour principles, it furnished an overwhelming argument for standing\r\nby them to the death.  This movement was fruitful of great mischief\r\nthroughout the loyal States, and on my return to Washington in the\r\nfall of this year I was glad to find this fact generally admitted,\r\nand my earnest opposition to it fully justified by the judgment of\r\nRepublican members of Congress.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle of Fredericksburg, on the 13th of\r\nDecember, the Committee on the Conduct of the War visited that\r\nplace for the purpose of inquiring into the facts respecting that\r\nfearful disaster.  The country was greatly shocked and excited,\r\nand eager to know who was to blame.  We examined Burnside, Hooker,\r\nSumner, and Woodbury; but prior to this, in a personal interview\r\nwith General Burnside, he frankly told me that _he_ was responsible\r\nfor the attack.  He seemed to be loaded down with a mountain of\r\ntrouble and anxiety, and I could see that he felt just as a patriotic\r\nman naturally would, after sacrificing thousands of men by a mistaken\r\nmovement.  He said he had no military ambition, and frankly confessed\r\nhis incapacity to command a large army, as he had done to the\r\nPresident and Secretary of War, when they urged him to assume this\r\ngreat responsibility; and that he was very sorry he had ever\r\nconsented to accept it.  His conversation disarmed all criticism,\r\nwhile his evident honesty decidedly pleased me.  It was a sad\r\nthought, while standing on the banks of the Rappahannock, that here\r\nwere more than a hundred thousand men on either side of a narrow\r\nriver, brethren and kindred, and naturally owing each other nothing\r\nbut good will, who were driven by negro slavery into the wholesale\r\nslaughter of each other.  But General Burnside told me our men did\r\nnot feel toward the rebels as they felt toward us, and he assured\r\nme that this was the grand obstacle to our success.  Our soldiers,\r\nhe said, were not sufficiently fired by resentment, and he exhorted\r\nme, if I could, to breathe into our people at home the same spirit\r\ntoward our enemies which inspired them toward us.  As I approached\r\none of the principal hospitals here, I was startled by a pile of\r\narms and legs of wounded soldiers, and on entering the building I\r\nfound scores of men in the last stages of life, stretched on the\r\nfloor with nothing under them but a thin covering of hay, and\r\nnothing over them but a coarse blanket or quilt, and without a\r\nspark of fire to warm them, though the weather was extremely cold\r\nand they were literally freezing to death.  Some of them were too\r\nfar gone to speak, and looked at me so pleadingly that I can never\r\nforget the impression it made.  Arrangements were made for their\r\ncomfort as soon as it was possible.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's day I joined the immense throng of callers at the\r\nWhite House, but did not enjoy the delay of the President in issuing\r\nhis Proclamation of Emancipation.  It came late in the day, and\r\nbrought relief to multitudes of anxious people.  Perhaps no subject\r\nhas ever been more widely misunderstood than the legal effect of\r\nthis famous document, and the circumstances under which it was\r\nissued.  Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed to the measure, and when\r\nhe very reluctantly issued his preliminary proclamation in September,\r\nhe wished it distinctly understood that the deportation of the\r\nslaves was, in his mind, inseparably connected with the policy.\r\nLike Mr. Clay and other prominent leaders of the old Whig party,\r\nhe believed in colonization, and that the separation of the two\r\nraces was necessary to the welfare of both.  He was at that time\r\npressing upon the attention of Congress a scheme of colonization\r\nin Chiriqui in Central America, which Senator Pomeroy espoused with\r\ngreat zeal, and in which he had the favor of a majority of the\r\nCabinet, including Secretary Smith, who warmly endorsed the project.\r\nSubsequent development, however, proved that it was simply an\r\norganization for land-stealing and plunder, and it was abandoned;\r\nbut it is by no means certain that if the President had foreseen\r\nthis fact, his preliminary notice to the rebels would have been\r\ngiven.  There are strong reasons for saying that he doubted his\r\nright to emancipate under the war power, and that he meant what he\r\nsaid when he compared an executive order to that effect to the\r\n\"Pope's Bull against the Comet.\"\r\n\r\nBut he saw no way of escape.  The demand for such an edict was wide-\r\nspread and rapidly extending in the Republican party.  The power\r\nto issue it was taken for granted.  All doubts on the subject were\r\nconsumed in the burning desire of the people, or forgotten in the\r\ntravail of war.  The anti-slavery element was becoming more and\r\nmore impatient and impetuous.  Opposition to that element now\r\ninvolved more serious consequences than offending the Border States.\r\nMr. Lincoln feared that enlistments would cease, and that Congress\r\nwould even refuse the necessary supplies to carry on the war, if\r\nhe declined any longer to place it on a clearly defined anti-slavery\r\nbasis.  It was in yielding to this pressure that he finally became\r\nthe liberator of the slaves through the triumph of our arms which\r\nit ensured.\r\n\r\nThe authority to emancipate under the war power is well settled,\r\nbut it could only be asserted over territory occupied by our armies.\r\nEach Commanding General, as fast as our flag advanced, could have\r\noffered freedom to the slaves, as could the President himself.\r\nThis was the view of Secretary Chase.  A paper proclamation of\r\nfreedom, as to States in the power of the enemy, could have no more\r\nvalidity than a paper blockade of their coast.  Mr. Lincoln's\r\nproclamation did not apply to the Border States, which were loyal,\r\nand in which slavery was of course untouched.  It did not pretend\r\nto operate upon the slaves in other large districts, in which it\r\nwould have been effective at once, but studiously excluded them,\r\nwhile it applied mainly to States and parts of States within the\r\nmilitary occupation of the enemy, where it was necessarily void.\r\nBut even if the proclamation could have given freedom to the slaves\r\naccording to its scope, their permanent enfranchisement would not\r\nhave been secured, because the _status_ of slavery, as it existed\r\nunder the local laws of the States prior to the war, would have\r\nremained after the re-establishment of peace.  All emancipated\r\nslaves found in those States, or returning to them, would have been\r\nsubject to slavery as before, for the simple reason that no military\r\nproclamation could operate to abolish their municipal laws.  Nothing\r\nshort of a Constitutional amendment could at once give freedom to\r\nour black millions and make their re-enslavement impossible; and\r\n\"this,\" as Mr. Lincoln declared in earnestly urging its adoption,\r\n\"is a king's cure for all evils.  It winds the whole thing up.\"\r\nAll this is now attested by high authorities on International and\r\nConstitutional law, and while it takes nothing from the honor so\r\nuniversally accorded to Mr. Lincoln as the great Emancipator, it\r\nshows how wisely he employed a grand popular delusion in the salvation\r\nof his country.  His proclamation had no present legal effect within\r\nterritory not under the control of our arms; but as an expression\r\nof the spirit of the people and the policy of the Administration,\r\nit had become both a moral and a military necessity.\r\n\r\nDuring this month I called with the Indiana delegation to see the\r\nPresident respecting the appointment of Judge Otto, of Indiana, as\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Interior.  He was afterward appointed,\r\nbut Mr. Lincoln then only responded to our application by treating\r\nus to four anecdotes.  Senator Lane told me that when the President\r\nheard a story that pleased him he took a memorandum of it and filed\r\nit away among his papers.  This was probably true.  At any rate,\r\nby some method or other, his supply seemed inexhaustible, and always\r\naptly available.  Early in February General Burnside came before\r\nthe War Committee, and gave the most startling testimony as to the\r\ndemoralization of the Army of the Potomac, the bickerings and\r\njealousies of the commanding generals, and the vexations of the\r\nPresident in dealing with the situation.  On the 18th of March I\r\ncalled on Mr. Lincoln respecting the appointments I had recommended\r\nunder the conscription law, and took occasion to refer to the\r\nfailure of General Fremont to obtain a command.  He said he did\r\nnot know where to place him, and that it reminded him of the old\r\nman who advised his son to take a wife, to which the young man\r\nresponded, \"Whose wife should I take?\"  The President proceeded to\r\npoint out the practical difficulties in the way by referring to a\r\nnumber of important commands which might suit Fremont, but which\r\ncould only be reached by removals he did not wish to make.  I\r\nremarked that I was very sorry if this was true, and that it was\r\nunfortunate for our cause, as I believed his restoration to duty\r\nwould stir the country as no other appointment could.  He said,\r\n\"it would stir the country on one side, and stir it the other way\r\non the other.  It would please Fremont's friends, and displease\r\nthe conservatives; and that is all I can see in the _stirring_\r\nargument.\"  \"My proclamation,\" he added, \"was to stir the country;\r\nbut it has done about as much harm as good.\"  These observations\r\nwere characteristic, and showed how reluctant he was to turn away\r\nfrom the conservative counsels he had so long heeded.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of April the final report of the Committee on the\r\nConduct of the War was completed, and the portion of it relating\r\nto the Army of the Potomac was in the hands of the Associated Press,\r\nand awaited by the public with a curiosity which it is not easy\r\nnow to realize.  The formation of the committee, as already stated,\r\ngrew out of the popular demand for a more vigorous war policy, and\r\nits action was thus exposed to the danger of hasty conclusions;\r\nbut the press and public opinion of the loyal States, with remarkable\r\nunanimity, credited it with great usefulness to the country, through\r\nits labors to rescue the control of the war from incompetent and\r\nunworthy hands.\r\n\r\nI returned home by way of Philadelphia and New York, and had a\r\ndelightful visit in the former place with James and Lucretia Mott,\r\nwhom I had not seen since 1850.  In New York I attended the great\r\n\"Sumter meeting\" of the 13th, and spoke at one of the stands with\r\nGeneral Fremont and Roscoe Conkling.  While in the city I met Mr.\r\nBryant, Phebe Carey, Mr. Beecher and other notables, and on my way\r\nhome tarried two days with Gerrit Smith, at his hospitable home in\r\nPeterboro.  According to his custom he invited a number of his\r\nneighbors and friends to breakfast, and by special invitation I\r\naddressed the people in the evening, at the \"free church\" of the\r\ntown, on topics connected with the war.  I could see that Mr. Smith\r\ndid not approve the severity of my language, and that this was a\r\nsource of amusement to some of his neighbors, but the course of\r\nevents afterward radically changed his views, and he admitted that\r\nin his public addresses he was greatly aided by the imprecatory\r\npsalms.  I had several delightful rambles with him, our conversation\r\nturning chiefly upon reformatory and theological topics, and I\r\nfound myself more than ever in love with this venerable philanthropist\r\nwhom I had only met once before, on his visit to Washington the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 8th of July the fire-bells of the town of\r\nCentreville, in which I resided, roused the people, who rushed into\r\nthe streets to learn that General John Morgan, with six thousand\r\ncavalry and four pieces of artillery, had crossed the Ohio, and\r\nwas moving upon the town of Corydon.  The Governor had issued a\r\ncall for minute men for the defense of the State, and within forty-\r\neight hours sixty five thousand men tendered their services.\r\nMessengers were at once dispatched to all parts of Wayne County\r\nconveying the news of the invasion, and the next morning the people\r\ncame pouring in from all directions, while the greatest excitement\r\nprevailed.  The town had eighty muskets, belonging to its Home\r\nGuard, and I took one of them, which I afterward exchanged for a\r\ngood French rifle; and having put on the military equipments, and\r\nsupplied myself with a blanket and canteen, I was ready for marching\r\norders.  The volunteers who rallied at Centreville were shipped to\r\nIndianapolis, and were about seven hours on the way.  I was a member\r\nof Company C, and the regiment to which I belonged was the One\r\nHundred and Sixth, and was commanded by Colonel Isaac P. Gray.  Of\r\nthe force which responded to the call of the Governor, thirteen\r\nregiments and one battalion were organized specially for the\r\nemergency, and sent into the field in different directions, except\r\nthe One Hundred and Tenth and the One Hundred and Eleventh, which\r\nremained at Indianapolis.  The One Hundred and Sixth was shipped\r\nby rail to Cincinnati, and but for a detention of several hours at\r\nIndianapolis, caused by the drunkenness of an officer high in\r\ncommand, it might possibly have encountered Morgan near Hamilton,\r\nthe next morning, on the way South.  Our reception in Cincinnati\r\nwas not very flattering.  The people there seemed to feel that Ohio\r\nwas able to take care of herself; and, in fact, nothing could have\r\nbeen more unreasonable than sending a body of infantry one hundred\r\nmiles in pursuit of a cavalry force in that vicinity, where an\r\nample body of cavalry was in readiness, and the river well guarded\r\nby gun-boats.\r\n\r\nWe were re-shipped to Indianapolis by rail, where we were mustered\r\nout of service and returned to our homes after a campaign of eight\r\ndays.  This was the sum of my military experience, but it afforded\r\nme some glimpses of the life of a soldier, and supplied me with\r\nsome startling facts respecting the curse of intemperance in our\r\narmies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nINCIDENTS AND END OF THE WAR.\r\nCampaigning in Ohio--Attempted repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law--\r\nOrganized movement in favor of Chase for the Presidency--Confiscation\r\nof rebel lands--Fort Pillow and the treatment of Union soldiers at\r\nRichmond--Mr. Lincoln's letter to Hodges--Southern Homestead Bill\r\nand controversy with Mr. Mallory--Nomination of Andrew Johnson--\r\nEnforcement of party discipline--Mr. Lincoln's change of opinion\r\nas to confiscation of rebel lands--Opposition to him in Congress--\r\nGeneral Fremont and Montgomery Blair--Visit to City Point--Adoption\r\nof the XIII Constitutional Amendment--Trip to Richmond and incidents\r\n--Assassination of the President--Inauguration of Johnson and\r\nannouncement of his policy--Feeling toward Mr. Lincoln--Capitulation\r\nwith Gen. Johnston.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of July of this year I addressed several meetings\r\nin Ohio, in company with Gov. Brough, beginning at Toledo.  His\r\nspeeches were too conservative for the times, as he soon discovered\r\nby their effect upon the people; but I found him singularly genial\r\nand companionable, and full of reminiscences of his early intimacy\r\nwith Jackson, Van Buren and Silas Wright.  Early in September I\r\nreturned to Ohio to join Hon. John A. Bingham in canvassing Mr.\r\nAshley's district under the employment of the State Republican\r\nCommittee.  Mr. Vallandigham, then temporarily colonized in Canada,\r\nwas the Democratic candidate for Governor, and the canvass was \"red-\r\nhot.\"  At no time during the war did the _spirit_ of war more\r\ncompletely sway the loyal masses.  It was no time to mince the\r\ntruth, or \"nullify damnation with a phrase,\" and I fully entered\r\ninto the spirit of General Burnside's advice already referred to,\r\nto breathe into the hearts of the people a feeling of animosity\r\nagainst the rebels akin to that which inspired their warfare against\r\nus.  I remember that at one of the mass-meetings I attended, where\r\nCol. Gibson was one of the speakers, a Cincinnati reporter who had\r\nprepared himself for his work dropped his pencil soon after the\r\noratorical fireworks began, and listened with open mouth and the\r\nmost rapt attention till the close of the speech; and he afterward\r\nwrote to his employer an account of the meeting, in which he said\r\nthat reporting was simply impossible, and he could only say the\r\nspeaking was \"beautifully terrible.\"  As a stump-speaker Col. Gibson\r\nwas then without a rival in the West.  His oratory was an irresistible\r\nfascination, and no audience could ever grow tired of him.  The\r\nspeeches of Mr. Bingham were always admirable.  His rhetoric was\r\nsingularly charming.  He was an artist in his work, but seldom\r\nrepeated himself, while gathering fresh inspiration, and following\r\nsome new line of thought at every meeting.  After our work was done\r\nin the Toledo district I accompanied Mr. Ashley to Jefferson, where\r\nhe and others were to address a mass-meeting, which we found\r\nassembled in front of the court house.  The day was rainy and\r\ndismal, and the meeting had already been in session for hours; but\r\nafter additional speeches by Ashley and Hutchins I was so loudly\r\ncalled for a little while before sunset, that I responded for about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, when I proposed to conclude, the people\r\nhaving been detained already over four hours while standing in a\r\ncold drizzling rain; but the cry of \"go on\" was very emphatic, and\r\nseemed to be unanimous.  \"Go ahead,\" said a farmer, \"we'll hear\r\nyou; it's past milking time anyhow!\"  It seemed to me I had never\r\nmet such listeners.  I was afterward informed that the test of\r\neffective speaking on the Reserve is the ability to hold an audience\r\nfrom their milking when the time for it comes, and I thought I\r\npassed this test splendidly.  After my return from Ohio I made a\r\nbrief canvass in Iowa, along with Senator Harlan and Governor\r\nStone, and spent the remainder of the fall on the stump in my own\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn the 38th Congress, Speaker Colfax made me Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Public Lands, which gratified me much.  It opened a\r\ncoveted field of labor on which I entered with zeal.  On the 14th\r\nof December I introduced a bill for the repeal of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, and in order to test the sense of the House on the\r\nquestion, I offered a resolution instructing the Judiciary Committee\r\nto report such a bill.  Greatly to my astonishment it was laid on\r\nthe table by a vote of yeas eighty-two, nays seventy-four.  Many\r\nRepublicans declined to vote, and we were evidently still under\r\nthe lingering spell of slavery.  Early in January an organized\r\nmovement was set on foot in the interest of Mr. Chase for the\r\nPresidency, and I was made a member of a Central Committee which\r\nwas appointed for the purpose of aiding the enterprise.  I was a\r\ndecided friend of Mr. Chase, and as decidedly displeased with the\r\nhesitating military policy of the Administration; but on reflection\r\nI determined to withdraw from the committee and let the presidential\r\nmatter drift.  I had no time to devote to the business, and I found\r\nthe committee inharmonious, and composed, in part, of men utterly\r\nunfit and unworthy to lead in such a movement.  It was fearfully\r\nmismanaged.  A confidential document known as the \"Pomeroy circular,\"\r\nassailing Mr. Lincoln and urging the claims of Mr. Chase, was sent\r\nto numerous parties, and of course fell into the hands of Mr.\r\nLincoln's friends.  They became greatly excited, and by vigorous\r\ncounter measures created a strong reaction.  A serious estrangement\r\nbetween the President and his Secretary was the result, which lasted\r\nfor several months.  The Chase movement collapsed, and when the\r\nRepublican members of the Ohio Legislature indorsed the re-nomination\r\nof Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Chase withdrew from the contest.  The opposition\r\nto Mr. Lincoln, however, continued, and was secretly cherished by\r\nmany of the ablest and most patriotic men in the party.  The extent\r\nof their opposition in Congress can never be known, and it was\r\ngreatly aggravated by successive military failures; but it lacked\r\nboth courage and leadership, and culminated in the nomination of\r\nGeneral Fremont in the latter part of May.\r\n\r\nIn this Congress a new joint select committee on the \"conduct of\r\nthe war\" was organized, armed with new powers, and authorized to\r\nsit in vacation; and in common with most of the members of the\r\nformer committee I was re-appointed.  During the latter part of\r\nJanuary I reported from the Committee on Public Lands a proposition\r\nto extend the Homestead Law of 1862 to the forfeited and confiscated\r\nlands of Rebels.  It was a very radical proposition, proposing to\r\ndeal with these lands as _public_ lands, and parcel them out into\r\nsmall homesteads among the poor of the South, black and white.\r\nThe subject was a large one, involving many important questions,\r\nand I devoted much time and thought to the preparation of a speech\r\nin support of the measure.  In the month of April a portion of the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War visited Fort Pillow, for the\r\npurpose of taking testimony respecting the rebel atrocities at that\r\nplace; and this testimony and that taken at Annapolis, early in\r\nMay, respecting the treatment of our soldiers in the prisons at\r\nRichmond was published, as a special instalment of our proceedings,\r\nfor popular use, accompanied by photographs of a number of prisoners\r\nin their wasted and disfigured condition.  The report produced a\r\npowerful effect on the public mind, and caused unspeakable trouble\r\nand vexation to the enemy.  I assisted in the examination of our\r\nprisoners at Annapolis, and never before had been so touched by\r\nany spectacle of human suffering.  They were in the last stages of\r\nlife, and could only answer our questions in a whisper.  They were\r\nliving skeletons, and it seemed utterly incredible that life could\r\nbe supported in such wasted and attenuated shadows of themselves.\r\nThey looked at us, in attempting to tell their story, with an\r\nexpression of beseeching tenderness and submission which no words\r\ncould describe.  Not one of them expressed any regret that he had\r\nentered into the service of the country, and each declared that he\r\nwould do so again, if his life should be spared and the opportunity\r\nshould be offered.  In examining one of these men I was perfectly\r\nunmanned by my tears; and on retiring from the tent to give them\r\nvent I encountered Senator Wade, who had fled from the work, and\r\nwas sobbing like a child.  It was an altogether unprecedented\r\nexperience, and the impression it produced followed me night and\r\nday for weeks.\r\n\r\nThe conservative policy of the Administration found a new and\r\ncareful expression in Mr. Lincoln's letter to A. G. Hodges, of the\r\n4th of April.  It showed great progress as compared with previous\r\nutterances, but his declaration that \"I claim not to have controlled\r\nevents, but confess plainly that events have controlled me,\" was\r\ndispleasing to the more anti-slavery Republicans.  They insisted\r\nthat the Administration had no right to become the foot-ball of\r\nevents.  It had no right, they said, at such a time, to make itself\r\na negative expression or an unknown quantity in the Algebra which\r\nwas to work out the great problem.  It had no right, they insisted,\r\nto take shelter beneath a debauched and sickly public sentiment,\r\nand plead it in bar of the great duty imposed upon it by the crisis.\r\nIt had no right, certainly, to lag behind that sentiment, to magnify\r\nits extent and potency, and then to become its virtual ally, instead\r\nof endeavoring to control it, and to indoctrinate the country with\r\nideas suited to the emergency.  It was the duty of the President,\r\nlike John Bright and the English Liberals, to lead, not follow\r\npublic opinion.  These criticisms found every variety of utterance\r\nthrough Congressional speeches and the press, and met with a cordial\r\nresponse from the people; and they undoubtedly played their part\r\nin preparing the country and the Administration for the more vigorous\r\npolicy which was to follow.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May the House passed my Southern Homestead Bill by\r\nthe strictly party vote of seventy-five to sixty-four.  In my\r\nclosing speech on the subject I was frequently interrupted by Wood\r\nof New York, and Mallory of Kentucky, and the debate ran into very\r\nsharp personalities, but the opposition of these members only tended\r\nto strengthen the measure.  On the 19th I was drawn into an\r\nexceedingly angry altercation with Mr. Mallory, who charged me with\r\nforging some very personal remarks about himself, and interpolating\r\nthem into the \"Congressional Globe\" as a part of my speech of the\r\n12th.  He was exceedingly insolent and overbearing in his manner,\r\ngrowing more and more so as he proceeded, and strikingly recalling\r\nthe old days of slavery.  He summoned a number of friends as\r\nwitnesses, who testified that they did not _hear_ me use the language\r\nin question, and several of them, like Kernan of New York, declared\r\nthat they had occupied positions very near me, had given particular\r\nattention to my words, and would certainly have remembered them if\r\nthey had been uttered.  I kept cool, but asserted very positively\r\nthat I did use the exact words reported, and in proof of my statement\r\nI appealed to a number of my friends, who sustained me by their\r\ndistinct and positive recollections.  Here was a conflict of\r\ntestimony in which every witness recollected the facts according\r\nto his politics; but pending the proceedings I was fortunate enough\r\nto find the notes of the \"Globe\" reporter, which perfectly vindicated\r\nme from Mr. Mallory's charges, and suddenly put his bluster and\r\nbillingsgate to flight.  He unconditionally retracted his charges,\r\nwhile his swift witnesses were sufficiently rebuked and humiliated\r\nby this unexpected catastrophe.  I was heartily complimented on my\r\ntriumph, and my dialogue with Mr. Mallory was put in pamphlet as\r\na campaign document by his opponents and liberally scattered over\r\nhis district, where it did much service in defeating his re-election\r\nto the House.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Southern Homestead Bill, however, could only\r\nprove a very partial measure without an enactment reaching the fee\r\nof rebel land owners, and I confidently anticipated the endorsement\r\nof such a measure by the Republican National Convention, which was\r\nto meet in Baltimore, on the seventh of June.  I was much gratified\r\nwhen the National Union League approved it, in its Convention in\r\nthat city the day before; and a resolution embodying it was also\r\nreported favorably by the sub-committee on resolutions of the\r\nNational Republican Convention the next day.  But the General\r\nCommittee, on the motion of McKee Dunn of Indiana, always an\r\nincorrigible conservative, struck it out, much to the disappointment\r\nof the Republican masses.  To me it was particularly vexatious, as\r\nthe measure was a pet one of mine, having labored for it with much\r\nzeal, and in the confidence that the National Convention would\r\napprove it.  Mr. Dunn was a Kentuckian of the Border State School,\r\nand although a friend of mine, and an upright and very gentlemanly\r\nman, he had a genius for being on the wrong side of vital questions\r\nduring the war.  Speaker Colfax used to say, laughingly, that in\r\ndetermining his own course he first made it a point to find out\r\nwhere McKee Dunn stood; and then, having ascertained Julian's\r\nposition, he always took a middle ground, feeling perfectly sure\r\nhe was right.\r\n\r\nBut to me the nomination of Andrew Johnson for Vice President was\r\na still greater disappointment.  I knew he did not believe in the\r\nprinciples embodied in the platform.  I had become intimately\r\nacquainted with him while we were fellow-members of the Committee\r\non the Conduct of the War, and he always scouted the idea that\r\nslavery was the cause of our trouble, or that emancipation could\r\never be tolerated without immediate colonization.  In my early\r\nacquaintance with him I had formed a different opinion; but he was,\r\nat heart, as decided a hater of the negro and of everything savoring\r\nof abolitionism, as the rebels from whom he had separated.  His\r\nnomination, however, like that of Mr. Lincoln, seemed to have been\r\npreordained by the people, while the intelligent, sober men, in\r\nCongress and out of Congress, who lamented the fact, were not\r\nprepared to oppose the popular will.  Mr. Lincoln's nomination was\r\nnearly unanimous, only the State of Missouri opposing him; but of\r\nthe more earnest and through-going Republicans in both Houses of\r\nCongress, probably not one in ten really favored it.  It was not\r\nonly very distasteful to a large majority of Congress but to many\r\nof the most prominent men of the party throughout the country.\r\nDuring the month of June the feeling against Mr. Lincoln became\r\nmore and more bitter and intense, but its expression never found\r\nits way to the people.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the divisions which existed in the Republican ranks,\r\nparty discipline was vigorous and absolute.  \"Civil Service Reform\"\r\nwas in the distant future, and the attempt to inaugurate it would\r\nhave been counted next to treasonable.  Loyalty to Republicanism\r\nwas not only accepted as the best evidence of loyalty to the country,\r\nbut of fitness for civil position.  After my nomination for re-\r\nelection this year, Mr. Holloway, who was still holding the position\r\nof Commissioner of Patents, and one of the editors of a Republican\r\nnewspaper in my district, refused to recognize me as the party\r\ncandidate, and kept the name of my defeated competitor standing in\r\nhis paper.  It threatened discord and mischief, and I went to the\r\nPresident with these facts, and on the strength of them demanded\r\nhis removal from office.  He replied, \"If I remove Mr. Holloway I\r\nshall have a quarrel with Senator Lane on my hands.\"  I replied\r\nthat Senator Lane would certainly not quarrel with him for turning\r\na man out of office who was fighting the Republican party and the\r\nfriends of the Administration.  \"Your nomination,\" said he, \"is as\r\nbinding on Republicans as mine, and you can rest assured that Mr.\r\nHolloway shall support you, openly and unconditionally, or lose\r\nhis head.\"  This was entirely satisfactory, but after waiting a\r\nweek or two for the announcement of my name I returned to Mr.\r\nLincoln with the information that Mr. Holloway was still keeping\r\nup his fight, and that I had come to ask of him decisive measures.\r\nI saw in an instant that the President now meant business.  He\r\ndispatched a messenger at once, asking Mr. Holloway to report to\r\nhim forthwith, in person, and in a few days my name was announced\r\nin his paper as the Republican candidate, and that of my competitor\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nHaving understood that Mr. Lincoln had changed his position respecting\r\nthe power of Congress to confiscate the landed estates of rebels,\r\nI called to see him on the subject on the 2d of July, and asked\r\nhim if I might say to the people that what I had learned on this\r\nsubject was true, assuring him that I could make a far better fight\r\nfor our cause if he would permit me to do so.  He replied that when\r\nhe prepared his veto of our law on the subject two years before,\r\nhe had not examined the matter fully, but that on further reflection,\r\nand on reading Solicitor Whiting's law argument, he had changed\r\nhis opinion, and thought he would now sign a bill striking at the\r\nfee, if we would send it to him.  I was much gratified by this\r\nstatement, which was of service to the cause in the canvass; but,\r\nunfortunately, constitutional scruples respecting such legislation\r\ngained ground, and although both Houses of Congress at different\r\ntimes endorsed the principle, it never became a law, owing to\r\nunavoidable differences between the President and Congress on the\r\nquestion of reconstruction.  The action of the President in dealing\r\nwith the rebel land owners was of the most serious character.  It\r\nparalyzed one of the most potent means of putting down the Rebellion,\r\nprolonging the conflict and aggravating its cost, and at the same\r\ntime left the owners of large estates in full possession of their\r\nlands at the end of the struggle, who naturally excluded from the\r\nownership of the soil the freedmen and poor whites who had been\r\nfriendly to the Union; while the confiscation of life estates as\r\na war measure was of no practical advantage to the Government or\r\ndisadvantage to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the President to sign the Reconstruction Act which\r\npassed near the close of the session, and his proclamation and\r\nmessage giving his reasons therefor, still further exasperated a\r\nformidable body of earnest and impatient Republicans.  A scathing\r\ncriticism of the President's position by Henry Winter Davis, which\r\nwas signed by himself and Senator Wade, fitly echoed their feelings.\r\nMr. Davis was a man of genius.  Among the famous men in the Thirty-\r\neighth Congress he had no superior as a writer, debater and orator.\r\nHe was a brilliant man, whose devotion to his country in this crisis\r\nwas a passion, while his hostility to the President's policy was\r\nas sincere as it was intense; but the passage of the somewhat\r\nincongruous bill vetoed by the President, would probably have proved\r\na stumbling-block in the way of the more radical measures which\r\nafterward prevailed.  This could not then be foreseen, and as the\r\nmeasure was an advanced one, the feeling against Mr. Lincoln waxed\r\nstronger and stronger among his opposers.  They had so completely\r\nlost their faith in him that when Congress adjourned they seriously\r\nfeared his veto of the bill just enacted, repealing the Fugitive\r\nSlave law; while the independent movement in favor of General\r\nFremont threatened a serious division in the Republican ranks, and\r\nthe triumph of General McClellan.  \"These,\" as Mr. Lincoln said on\r\nanother occasion, \"were dark and dismal days,\" and they were made\r\nstill more so by the course of military events.  The capture of\r\nRichmond, which General Grant had promised, had not been accomplished,\r\nalthough he had been furnished with all the troops he wanted.  Our\r\nGrand Army of the Potomac made advances in that direction, but with\r\ngreat slaughter and no actual results; while the Administration\r\nwas blamed for his failures.  General Grant finally reached the\r\nposition occupied by McClellan in 1862, but with terrific losses,\r\nand Richmond still in possession of the rebels.  His delay and\r\ninaction at this point created great popular discontent in the\r\nNorth; but while Lincoln supplied him with ample reinforcements,\r\nand he now had an army twice as large as that of General Lee, which\r\nwas costing the nation over a million dollars per day, he continued\r\nidle during the summer.  It was evident that nothing could save us\r\nbut military success; and most fortunately for the Republican cause\r\nit came in due season, rallied and reunited its supporters, and\r\nthus secured their triumph at the polls.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the canvass, while on a visit to Washington, I\r\nlearned how it happened that Montgomery Blair had finally been got\r\nout of the Cabinet, and General Fremont induced to leave the track\r\nas the candidate of the Cleveland Convention.  The radical pressure\r\nupon Mr. Lincoln for the removal of Blair was very formidable, and\r\nthe emergency seemed so critical that it finally resulted in a\r\ncompromise, by which Fremont agreed to retire from the race, if\r\nBlair should be required to leave the Cabinet.  This was carried\r\nout, and thus, at last, the President was obliged to make terms\r\nwith the \"Pathfinder,\" who achieved a long-coveted victory over an\r\nold foe.  The election of Mr. Lincoln was followed by a remarkable\r\nmeasure of party union and harmony, and the tone of his message in\r\nDecember was encouraging.  The appointment and confirmation of Mr.\r\nChase as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court met the most cordial\r\napproval of Republicans everywhere.  As a healing measure, following\r\nhis retirement from the treasury for valid reasons, it was most\r\ntimely.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of December, the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\nWar visited City Point, for the purpose of taking testimony respecting\r\nthe explosion of the mine at Petersburg.  General Grant spent\r\nseveral hours with the Committee, speaking very freely and familiarly\r\nof the faults and virtues of our various commanders, and impressing\r\nevery one by his strong common sense.  While at dinner with us on\r\nour steamer, he drank freely, and its effect became quite manifest.\r\nIt was a painful surprise to the Committee, and was spoken of with\r\nbated breath; for he was the Lieutenant-General of all our forces,\r\nand the great movements which finally strangled the Rebellion were\r\nthen in progress, and, for aught we knew, might possibly be deflected\r\nfrom their purpose by his condition.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1865, the Committee on the Conduct of the War investigated\r\nthe famous Fort Fisher expedition, in which three hundred tuns of\r\npowder were to be exploded in the vicinity of the Fort as a means\r\nof demolishing it, or paralyzing the enemy.  The testimony of\r\nGeneral Butler in explanation and defense of the enterprise was\r\ninteresting and spicy, and he was subsequently contradicted by\r\nGeneral Grant on material points.  On the last day of this month\r\none of the grandest events of the century was witnessed in the\r\nHouse of Representatives in the final passage of the Constitutional\r\nAmendment forever prohibiting slavery.  Numerous propositions on\r\nthe subject had been submitted, but the honor of drafting the one\r\nadopted belongs to Lyman Trumbull, who had introduced it early in\r\nthe first session of this Congress.  It passed the Senate on the\r\n8th of April, 1864, only six members voting against it, namely,\r\nDavis, Hendricks, McDougall, Powell, Riddle and Saulsbury, but\r\nfailed in the House on the 15th of June following.  It now came up\r\non the motion of Mr. Ashley to reconsider this vote.  Congress had\r\nabolished slavery in the District of Columbia, and prohibited it\r\nin all the Territories.  It had repealed the Fugitive Slave law,\r\nand declared free all negro soldiers in the Union armies and their\r\nfamilies; and the President had played his grand part in the\r\nProclamation of Emancipation.  But the question now to be decided\r\ncompletely overshadowed all others.  The debate on the subject had\r\nbeen protracted and very spirited, the opposition being led by\r\nPendleton, Fernando Wood, Voorhees, Mallory and Eldridge, who all\r\ndenied that the power to amend the Constitution conferred the right\r\nto abolish slavery, as Garrett Davis and Saulsbury had done in the\r\nSenate.  The time for the momentous vote had now come, and no\r\nlanguage could describe the solemnity and impressiveness of the\r\nspectacle pending the roll-call.  The success of the measure had\r\nbeen considered very doubtful, and depended upon certain negotiations,\r\nthe result of which was not fully assured, and the particulars of\r\nwhich never reached the public.  The anxiety and suspense during\r\nthe balloting produced a deathly stillness, but when it became\r\ncertainly known that the measure had prevailed the cheering in the\r\ndensely-packed hall and galleries surpassed all precedent and\r\nbeggared all description.  Members joined in the general shouting,\r\nwhich was kept up for several minutes, many embracing each other,\r\nand others completely surrendering themselves to their tears of\r\njoy.  It seemed to me I had been born into a new life, and that\r\nthe world was overflowing with beauty and joy, while I was\r\ninexpressibly thankful for the privilege of recording my name on\r\nso glorious a page of the nation's history, and in testimony of an\r\nevent so long only dreamed of as possible in the distant future.\r\nThe champions of negro emancipation had merely hoped to speed their\r\ngrand cause a little by their faithful labors, and hand over to\r\ncoming generations the glory of crowning it with success; but they\r\nnow saw it triumphant, and they had abundant and unbounded cause\r\nto rejoice.  It has been aptly said that the greatest advantage of\r\na long life is the opportunity it gives of seeing moral experiments\r\nworked out, of being present at the fructification of social causes,\r\nand of thus gaining a kind of wisdom which in ordinary cases seems\r\nreserved for a future life; but that an equivalent for this advantage\r\nis possessed by such as live in those critical periods of society\r\nwhen retribution is hastened, or displayed in clear connection with\r\nthe origin of events.  It strengthens faith to observe the sure\r\noperation of moral causes in ripening into great and beneficent\r\nresults.  To be permitted to witness the final success of the\r\ngrandest movement of ancient or modern times was a blessed opportunity.\r\nTo have labored for it in the goodly fellowship of its confessors\r\nand martyrs was cause for devout thanksgiving and joy.  To be\r\naccredited to share in the great historic act of its formal\r\nconsummation was a priceless privilege.  A few days after the\r\nratification of this Amendment, on the motion of Mr. Sumner, Dr.\r\nRock, a colored lawyer of Boston, was admitted to practice in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, which had pronounced the Dred\r\nScott decision only a few years before; and this was followed a\r\nfew days later by a sermon in the hall of the House by Rev. Mr.\r\nGarnett, being the first ever preached in the Capitol by a colored\r\nman.  Evidently, the negro was coming to the front.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of March I visited New York, where I witnessed\r\nthe immense throngs of shouting people on Wall Street, called\r\ntogether by the news of the fall of Richmond.  Broadway, robed in\r\nits innumerable banners, was one of the finest sights I had ever\r\nbeheld.  On the tenth of April the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\nWar left Washington for South Carolina, for the purpose of taking\r\nfurther testimony, and intending to be present at the great\r\nanniversary of the thirteenth at Charleston.  We reached Fortress\r\nMonroe the next evening, where we learned that the \"Alabama,\" which\r\nthe Navy Department had furnished us, would be detained twenty-four\r\nhours to coal, by reason of which we proceeded directly to Richmond\r\non the \"Baltimore.\"  At City Point, Admiral Porter furnished us\r\nwith a pilot, as there was some danger of torpedoes up the James\r\nRiver.  Our steamer reached the city about bedtime, but we remained\r\non board till morning, lulled into a sweep sleep by the music of\r\nthe guitar and the singing of the negroes below.  At eight o'clock\r\nin the morning our party went out sight-seeing, some in carriages,\r\nbut most of us on horseback, with an orderly for each to show him\r\nthe way.  The first notable place we visited was General Weitzel's\r\nheadquarters, just vacated by Jefferson Davis.  The building was\r\na spacious three-story residence, with a large double parlor, a\r\nladies' parlor, and a small secluded library attached, in which\r\nall sorts of treason were said to have been hatched.  We next\r\nvisited the capitol, an ancient-looking edifice, which would bear\r\nno comparison with our modern State Capitols in size or style of\r\narchitecture.  The library made a respectable appearance, but I\r\nthink it contained few modern publications, especially of our own\r\nauthors.  I noticed, however, a liberal supply of theological works\r\nof the most approved orthodoxy.  The view of the city from the top\r\nof the building was admirable.  We could see Libby Prison, Castle\r\nThunder and Belle Isle, the former of which we afterward visited.\r\nAfter seeing the rebel fortifications we were glad to get back to\r\nour steamer.  Before starting the next morning we saw the \"Richmond\r\nWhig,\" containing an order signed by General Weitzel, inviting\r\nHunter, McMullen and other noted rebel leaders, including members\r\nof the rebel legislature, to meet in Richmond on the twenty-fifth\r\nto confer with our authorities on the restoration of peace,\r\ntransportation and safe conduct being ordered for the purpose.  We\r\nwere all thunderstruck, and fully sympathized with the hot indignation\r\nand wrathful words of the chairman of our committee.  We soon\r\nafterwards learned that the order had been directed by the President,\r\nand while we were thoroughly disgusted by this display of misguided\r\nmagnanimity we saw rebel officers strutting around the streets in\r\nfull uniform, looking as independent as if they had been masters\r\nof the city.  We left on the afternoon of the twelfth, and were\r\ninterested in seeing Drury's Landing, Dutch-Gap Canal, Malvern\r\nHill and other points of historic interest.  Before reaching\r\nFortress Monroe the next day, Senators Wade and Chandler changed\r\ntheir minds respecting our journey to Charleston, which was abandoned,\r\nand after spending a few hours very pleasantly at that place and\r\nPoint Lookout, we reached Washington on the evening of the\r\nfourteenth.\r\n\r\nSoon after retiring I was roused from a deep sleep by loud raps at\r\nmy door.  W. L. Woods, clerk of my committee, entered in the greatest\r\nexcitement, and told me that Lincoln had just been assassinated,\r\nand Seward and son probably, and that rebel assassins were about\r\nto take the town.  Supposing all this to be true I grew suddenly\r\ncold, heart-sick and almost helpless.  It was a repetition of my\r\nexperience when the exaggerated stories about the Bull Run disaster\r\nfirst reached me in the summer of 1861.  I soon rallied, however,\r\nand joined the throng on the street.  The city was at once in a\r\ntempest of excitement, consternation and rage.  About seven and a\r\nhalf o'clock in the morning the church bells tolled the President's\r\ndeath.  The weather was as gloomy as the mood of the people, while\r\nall sorts of rumors filled the air as to the particulars of the\r\nassassination and the fate of Booth.  Johnson was inaugurated at\r\neleven o'clock on the morning of the 15th, and was at once surrounded\r\nby radical and conservative politicians, who were alike anxious\r\nabout the situation.  I spent most of the afternoon in a political\r\ncaucus, held for the purpose of considering the necessity of a new\r\nCabinet and a line of policy less conciliatory than that of Mr.\r\nLincoln; and while everybody was shocked at his murder, the feeling\r\nwas nearly universal that the accession of Johnson to the Presidency\r\nwould prove a god-send to the country.  Aside from Mr. Lincoln's\r\nknown policy of tenderness to the Rebels, which now so jarred upon\r\nthe feelings of the hour, his well-known views on the subject of\r\nreconstruction were as distasteful as possible to radical Republicans.\r\nIn his last public utterance, only three days before his death, he\r\nhad declared his adherence to the plan of reconstruction announced\r\nby him in December, 1863, which in the following year so stirred\r\nthe ire of Wade and Winter Davis as an attempt of the Executive to\r\nusurp the powers of Congress.  According to this plan the work of\r\nreconstruction in the rebel States was to be inaugurated and carried\r\non by those only who were qualified to vote under the Constitution\r\nand laws of these States as they existed prior to the Rebellion.\r\nOf course the negroes of the South could have no voice in framing\r\nthe institutions under which they were to live, and the question\r\nof negro suffrage would thus have been settled by the President,\r\nif he had lived and been able to maintain this policy, while no\r\ndoubt was felt that this calamity had now been averted and the way\r\nopened for the radical policy which afterward involved the impeachment\r\nof Johnson, but finally prevailed.  It was forgotten in the fever\r\nand turbulence of the moment, that Mr. Lincoln, who was never an\r\nobstinate man, and who in the matter of his Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation had surrendered his own judgment under the pressure\r\nof public opinion, would not have been likely to wrestle with\r\nCongress and the country in a mad struggle for his own way.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, in pursuance of a previous engagement, the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War met the President at his quarters\r\nin the Treasury Department.  He received us with decided cordiality,\r\nand Mr. Wade said to him:  \"Johnson, we have faith in you.  By the\r\ngods, there will be no trouble now in running the government!\"\r\nThe President thanked him, and went on to define his well-remembered\r\npolicy at that time.  \"I hold,\" said he, \"that robbery is a crime;\r\nrape is a crime; murder is a crime; _treason_ is a crime, and\r\n_crime_ must be punished.  Treason must be made infamous, and\r\ntraitors must be impoverished.\"  We were all cheered and encouraged\r\nby this brave talk, and while we were rejoiced that the leading\r\nconservatives of the country were not at Washington, we felt that\r\nthe presence and influence of the committee, of which Johnson had\r\nbeen a member, would aid the Administration in getting on the right\r\ntrack.  We met him again the next day and found the symptoms of a\r\nvigorous policy still favorable, and although I had some misgivings,\r\nthe general feeling was one of unbounded confidence in his sincerity\r\nand firmness, and that he would act upon the advice of General\r\nButler by inaugurating a policy of his own, instead of administering\r\non the political estate of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the prevailing excitement was greatly aggravated\r\nby the news of the capitulation between General Sherman and General\r\nJohnston on the 16th of April.  Its practical surrender of all the\r\nfruits of the national triumph so soon after the murder of the\r\nPresident, produced an effect on the public mind which can not be\r\ndescribed.  General Sherman had heard of the assassination when\r\nthe capitulation was made, and could not have been ignorant of the\r\nfeeling it had aroused.  On the face of the proceeding his action\r\nseemed a wanton betrayal of the country to its enemies; but when\r\nthis betrayal followed so swiftly the frightful tragedy which was\r\nthen believed to have been instigated by the Confederate authorities,\r\nthe patience of the people became perfectly exhausted.  For the\r\ntime being, all the glory of his great achievements in the war\r\nseemed to be forgotten in the anathemas which were showered upon\r\nhim from every quarter of the land; but the prompt repudiation of\r\nhis stipulations by the Administration soon assuaged the popular\r\ndiscontent, while it provoked an estrangement between Secretary\r\nStanton and himself which was never healed.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of the people at Mr. Lincoln's funeral was wholly\r\nunprecedented, and every possible arrangement was made by which\r\nthey could manifest their grief for their murdered President; but\r\ntheir solicitude for the state of the country was too profound to\r\nbe intermitted.  What policy was now to be pursued?  Mr. Lincoln's\r\nlast utterances had been far from assuring or satisfactory.  The\r\nquestion of reconstruction had found no logical solution, and all\r\nwas confusion respecting it.  The question of negro suffrage was\r\nslowly coming to the front, and could not be much longer evaded.\r\nThe adequate punishment of the rebel leaders was the demand of the\r\nhour.  What would the new President do?  He had suddenly become\r\nthe central figure of American politics, and both radicals and\r\nconservatives were as curious to know what line of policy he would\r\nfollow as they were anxious to point his way.  His demeanor, at\r\nfirst, seemed modest and commendable, but his egotism soon began\r\nto assert itself, while his passion for stump-speaking was pampered\r\nby the delegations which began to pour into the city from various\r\nStates and flatter him by formal addresses, to which he replied at\r\nlength.  This business was kept up till the people became weary of\r\nthe din and clatter of words, and impatient for action.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nRECONSTRUCTION AND SUFFRAGE--THE LAND QUESTION.\r\nVisit of Indianans to the President--Gov. Morton and reconstruction\r\n--Report of Committee on the Conduct of the War--Discussion of\r\nnegro suffrage and incidents--Personal matters--Suffrage in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia--The Fourteenth Constitutional Amendment--\r\nBreach between the President and Congress--Blaine and Conkling--\r\nLand bounties and the Homestead Law.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of April I joined a large crowd of Indianans\r\nin one of the calls on the President referred to at the close of\r\nthe last chapter.  Gov. Morton headed the movement, which I now\r\nfound had a decidedly political significance.  He read a lengthy\r\nand labored address on \"The Whole Duty of Man\" respecting the\r\nquestion of Reconstruction.  He told the President that a State\r\ncould \"neither secede nor by any possible means be taken out of\r\nthe Union\"; and he supported and illustrated this proposition by\r\nsome very remarkable statements.  He elaborated the proposition\r\nthat the loyal people of a State have the right to govern it; but\r\nhe did not explain what would become of the State if the people\r\nwere all disloyal, or the loyal so few as to be utterly helpless.\r\nThe lawful governments of the South were overthrown by treason;\r\nand the Governor declared there was \"no power in the Federal\r\nGovernment to punish the people of a State collectively, by reducing\r\nit to a territorial condition, since the crime of treason is\r\nindividual, and can only be treated individually.\"  According to\r\nthis doctrine a rebellious State become independent.  If the people\r\ncould rightfully be overpowered by the national authority, that\r\nvery fact would at once re-clothe them in all their rights, just\r\nas if they had never rebelled.  In framing their new governments\r\nCongress would have no right to prescribe any conditions, or to\r\ngovern them in any way pending the work of State reconstruction,\r\nsince this would be to recognize the States as Territories, and\r\nviolate the principle of State rights.  The Governor's theory of\r\nreconstruction, in fact, made our war for the Union flagrantly\r\nunconstitutional.  The crime of treason being \"individual,\" and\r\nonly to \"be treated individually,\" we had no right to hold prisoners\r\nof war, seize property, and capture and confiscate vessels, without\r\na regular indictment and trial; and this being so, every Rebel in\r\narms was in the full legal possession of his political rights, and\r\nno power could prevent him from exercising them except through\r\njudicial conviction of treason in the district in which the overt\r\nact was committed.  Singularly enough, he seemed entirely unaware\r\nof the well-settled principle which made our war for the Union a\r\nterritorial conflict, like that of a war with Mexico or England;\r\nthat the Rebels, while still liable to be hung or otherwise dealt\r\nwith for treason, had taken upon themselves the further character\r\nof public enemies; and that being now conquered they were conquered\r\nenemies, having simply the rights of a conquered people.  The\r\nGovernor further informed the President that if the revolted\r\ndistricts should be dealt with as mere Territories, or conquered\r\nprovinces, the nation would be obliged to pay the debts contracted\r\nby them prior to the war.  These remarkable utterances, which he\r\nrepudiated in less than a year afterward, were emphatically endorsed\r\nby the President, who entered upon the same theme at a dismal\r\nlength, freely indulging in his habit of bad English and incoherence\r\nof thought.  I was disgusted, and sorry that the confidence of so\r\nmany of my radical friends had been entirely misplaced.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of April and early part of May the Committee\r\non the Conduct of the War completed its final report, making eight\r\nconsiderable volumes, and containing valuable material for any\r\ntrustworthy history of the great conflict.  Its opinions were\r\nsometimes colored by the passions of the hour, and this was especially\r\ntrue in the case of General McClellan; but subsequent events have\r\njustified its conclusions generally as to nearly every officer and\r\noccurrence investigated, while its usefulness in exposing military\r\nblunders and incompetence, and in finally inaugurating the vigorous\r\nwar policy which saved the country, will scarcely be questioned by\r\nany man sufficiently well-informed and fair-minded to give an\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May, a caucus of Republicans was held at the National\r\nHotel to consider the necessity of taking decisive measures for\r\nsaving the new Administration from the conservative control which\r\nthen threatened it.  Senators Wade and Sumner both insisted that\r\nthe President was in no danger, and declared, furthermore, that he\r\nwas in favor of negro suffrage; and no action was taken because of\r\nthe general confidence in him which I was surprised to find still\r\nprevailed.  In the meantime, pending the general drift of events,\r\nthe suffrage question was constantly gaining in significance, and\r\ndemanding a settlement.  It was neither morally nor logically\r\npossible to escape it; and on my return to my constituents I prepared\r\nfor a thorough canvass of my district.  The Republicans were\r\neverywhere divided on the question, while the current of opinion\r\nwas strongly against the introduction of the issue as premature.\r\nThe politicians all opposed it on the plea that it would divide\r\nthe Republicans and restore the Democrats to power, and that we\r\nmust wait for the growth of a public opinion that would justify\r\nits agitation.  Governor Morton opposed the policy with inexpressible\r\nbitterness, declaring, with an oath, that \"negro suffrage must be\r\nput down,\" while every possible effort was made to array the soldiers\r\nagainst it.  His hostility to the suffrage wing of his party seemed\r\nto be quite as relentless as to the Rebels, while the great body\r\nof the Republicans of the district deferred strongly to his views.\r\nIn the beginning of the canvass I even found a considerable portion\r\nof my old anti-slavery friends unprepared to follow me; but feeling\r\nperfectly sure I was right, and that I could revolutionize the\r\ngeneral opinion, I entered upon the work, and prosecuted it with\r\nall my might for nearly four months.  My task was an arduous one,\r\nbut I found the people steadily yielding up their prejudices, and\r\nready to lay hold of the truth when fairly and dispassionately\r\npresented, while the soldiers were among the first to accept my\r\nteachings.  The tide was at length so evidently turning in my favor\r\nthat on the 28th of September Governor Morton was induced to make\r\nhis elaborate speech at Richmond, denouncing the whole theory of\r\nRepublican reconstruction as subsequently carried out, and opposing\r\nthe policy of negro suffrage by arguments which he seemed to regard\r\nas overwhelming.  He made a dismal picture of the ignorance and\r\ndegradation of the plantation negroes of the South, and scouted\r\nthe policy of arming them with political power.  But their fitness\r\nfor the ballot was a subordinate question.  A great national\r\nemergency pleaded for their right to it on other and far more\r\nimperative grounds.  The question involved the welfare of both\r\nraces, and the issues of the war.  It involved not merely the fate\r\nof the negro, but the safety of society.  It was, moreover, a\r\nquestion of national honor and gratitude, from which no escape was\r\nmorally possible.  To leave the ballot in the hands of the ex-\r\nrebels, and withhold it from these helpless millions, would be to\r\nturn them over to the unhindered tyranny and misrule of their\r\nenemies, who were then smarting under the humiliation of their\r\nfailure, and making the condition of the freedmen more intolerable\r\nthan slavery itself, through local laws and police regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Governor referred to the Constitution and laws of Indiana,\r\ndenying the ballot to her intelligent negroes, and subjecting\r\ncolored men to prosecution and fine for coming into the State; and\r\nasked with what face her people could insist upon conferring the\r\nsuffrage upon the negroes of the Southern States?  But this was an\r\nevasion of the question.  The people of Indiana had no right to\r\ntake advantage of their own wrong, or to sacrifice the welfare of\r\nfour million blacks on the altar of Northern consistency.  He should\r\nhave preached the duty of practical repentance in Indiana, instead\r\nof making the sins of her people an excuse for a far greater\r\ninhumanity to the negroes of the South.\r\n\r\nHe urged that the policy of negro suffrage would give the lie to\r\nall the arguments that had ever been employed against slavery as\r\ndegrading and brutalizing to its victims.  He said it was \"to pay\r\nthe highest compliment to the institution of slavery,\" and \"stultify\r\nourselves.\"  But this was belittling a great national question, by\r\nthe side of which all considerations of party consistency were\r\nutterly trivial and contemptible.  The ballot for the negro was a\r\nlogical necessity, and it was a matter of the least possible\r\nconsequence whether the granting of it would \"stultify ourselves\"\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nHe insisted that the true policy was to give the Southern negroes\r\na probation of fifteen or twenty years to prepare for the ballot.\r\nHe would give them \"time to acquire a little property; time to get\r\na little education; time to learn something about the simplest\r\nforms of business, and to prepare themselves for the exercise of\r\npolitical power.\"  But he did not explain how all this was to be\r\ndone, under the circumstances of their condition.  He declared that\r\nnot one of them in five hundred could read, or was worth five\r\ndollars in property of any kind, owning nothing but their bodies,\r\nand living on the plantations of white men upon whom they were\r\ndependent for employment and subsistence.  How could such men\r\nacquire \"education,\" and \"property,\" under the absolute sway of a\r\npeople who regarded them with loathing and contempt?  Who would\r\ngrant them this \"probation,\" and help them turn it to good account?\r\nWas some miracle to be wrought through which the slave-masters were\r\nto be transfigured into negro apostles and devotees?  Besides,\r\nunder Governor Morton's theory of reconstruction and State rights,\r\nneither Congress nor the people of the loyal States had anything\r\nto do with the question.  It was no more their concern in South\r\nCarolina than in Massachusetts.  His suggestion of a probation for\r\nSouthern negroes was therefore an impertinence.  If not, why did\r\nhe not recommend a \"probation\" for the hordes of \"white trash\" that\r\nwere as unfit for political power as the negroes?\r\n\r\nHe was very earnest and eloquent in his condemnation of Mr. Sumner\r\nfor proposing to give the ballot to the negroes and disfranchise\r\nthe white Rebels, but his moral vision failed to discern anything\r\namiss in his own ghastly policy of arming the white Rebels with\r\nthe ballot and denying it to the loyal negroes.\r\n\r\nHe argued that the right to vote carried with it the right to hold\r\noffice, and that negro suffrage would lead to the election of negro\r\nGovernors, negro judges, negro members of Congress, a negro balance\r\nof power in our politics, and a war of races.  He seemed to have\r\nno faith at all in the beneficent measures designed to guard the\r\nblack race from outrage and wrong, while full of apprehension that\r\nthe heavens would fall if such measures were adopted.\r\n\r\nThis speech was published in a large pamphlet edition and extensively\r\nscattered throughout the country; but it proved a help rather than\r\na hindrance to my enterprise.  I replied to it in several incisive\r\nnewspaper articles, and made its arguments a text for a still more\r\nthorough discussion of the issue on the stump, and at the close of\r\nmy canvass the Republicans of the district were as nearly a unit\r\nin my favor as a party can be made respecting any controverted\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nI now extended my labors briefly outside of my district, and by\r\nspecial invitation from citizens of Indianapolis and members of\r\nthe Legislature, then in session, I spoke in that city on the 17th\r\nof November.  Every possible effort was made by the Johnsonized\r\nRepublicans to prevent me from having an audience, but they failed\r\nutterly; and I analyzed the positions of Governor Morton in a speech\r\nof two hours, which was reported for the \"Cincinnati Gazette\" and\r\nsubsequently published in a large pamphlet edition.  The political\r\nrage and exasperation which now prevailed in the ranks of the Anti-\r\nSuffrage faction can be more readily imagined than described.\r\nTheir organ, the \"Indianapolis Journal,\" poured out upon me an\r\nincredible deliverance of vituperation and venom for scattering my\r\nheresies outside of my Congressional district, declaring that I\r\nhad \"the temper of a hedgehog, the adhesiveness of a barnacle, the\r\nvanity of a peacock, the vindictiveness of a Corsican, the hypocrisy\r\nof Aminadab Sleek and the duplicity of the devil.\"  I rather enjoyed\r\nthese paroxysms of malignity, which broke out all over the State\r\namong the Governor's conservative satellites, since my only offense\r\nwas fidelity to my political opinions, the soundness of which I\r\nwas finding fully justified by events; for the friends of the\r\nGovernor, in a few short months, gathered together and cremated\r\nall the copies of his famous speech which could be found.  But the\r\ndisowned document was printed as a campaign tract by the Democrats\r\nfor a dozen successive years afterward, and circulated largely in\r\nseveral of the Northern States, while the Governor himself, by a\r\nsudden and splendid somersault, became the champion and exemplar\r\nof the very heresies which had so furiously kindled his ire against\r\nme.  These performances are sufficiently remarkable to deserve\r\nnotice.  They did much to make Indiana politics spicy and picturesque,\r\nand showed how earnestly the radical and conservative wings of the\r\nRepublican party could wage war against the common enemy without\r\nin the least impairing their ability or disposition to fight each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI have referred to these facts because they form a necessary part\r\nof the story I am telling.  The question of Negro Suffrage was a\r\nvery grave one, and the circumstances connected with its introduction\r\nas a political issue are worthy of record; while Governor Morton\r\nwas a sort of phenomenal figure in American politics during the\r\nwar period, and played a very remarkable part in the affairs of\r\nIndiana.  It has aptly been said of him, and not by an enemy, that\r\nhis inconsistencies, in a study of his character, form the most\r\ncharming part of it, and that no man in public life ever brought\r\nsuch magnificent resources to the support of both sides of a\r\nquestion.  His force of will was as matchless as his ambition for\r\npower was boundless and unappeasable.  He was made for revolutionary\r\ntimes, and his singular energy of character was pre-eminently\r\ndestructive; but it can not be denied that his services to the\r\ncountry in this crisis were great.  Mr. Von Holst, in his\r\n\"Constitutional and Political History of the United States,\" has\r\na chapter on \"The Reign of Andrew Jackson.\"  When the history of\r\nIndiana shall be written, it might fitly contain a chapter on \"The\r\nReign of Oliver P. Morton.\"  He made himself not merely the master\r\nof the Democratic party of the State, and of its Rebel element,\r\nbut of his own party as well.  His will, to a surprising extent,\r\nhad the force of law in matters of both civil and military\r\nadministration.  His vigor in action and great personal magnetism\r\nso rallied the people to his support, that with the rarest exceptions\r\nthe prominent leaders of his party quietly succumbed to his ambition,\r\nand recoiled from the thought of confronting him, even where they\r\nbelieved him in the wrong.\r\n\r\nHis hostility to me began with my election to Congress in 1849, in\r\nwhich, as a Free Soiler, I had the united support of the Democratic\r\nparty of my district, of which he was then a member.  I never\r\nobtained his forgiveness for my success in that contest, and his\r\nunfriendliness was afterward aggravated by his failure as a Republican\r\nleader to supplant me in the district, and it continued to the end.\r\nI knew him from his boyhood.  We resided in the same village nearly\r\ntwenty years, and began our acquaintance as members of the same\r\ndebating club.  For years we were intimate and attached friends,\r\nand I believe no man was before me in appreciating his talents and\r\npredicting for him a career of political distinction and usefulness.\r\nDuring the war, earnest efforts were made by his friends and mine\r\nlooking to a reconciliation, and the restoration of that harmony\r\nin the party which good men on both sides greatly coveted; but all\r\nsuch efforts necessarily failed.  If I had been willing to subordinate\r\nmy political convictions and sense of duty to his ambition, peace\r\ncould at once have been restored; but as this was impossible, I\r\nwas obliged to accept the warfare which continued and increased,\r\nand which I always regretted and deplored.  I only make these\r\nstatements in justice to the truth.\r\n\r\nThe bill providing for negro suffrage in the District of Columbia\r\nwas among the first important measures of the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\nThe debate upon it in January, 1866, was singularly able and\r\nthorough, and gave strong evidence of political progress.  All\r\nefforts to postpone the measure, or make the suffrage restrictive,\r\nwere voted down, and on the announcement of its passage the cheering\r\nwas tremendous.  Beginning on the floor, it was quickly caught up\r\nby the galleries, and the scene resembled that which followed the\r\npassage of the Constitutional Amendment already referred to.  The\r\nmajority was over two to one, thus clearly foreshadowing the\r\nenfranchisement of the negro in the insurrectionary districts.  I\r\nbelieve only two of my colleagues voted with me for its passage.\r\n\r\nThe question of reconstruction was brought directly before Congress\r\nby the report of the joint select committee on that subject,\r\nsubmitting the Fourteenth Constitutional Amendment.  The second\r\nsection of the Amendment was a measure of compromise, and attempted\r\nto unite the radical and conservative wings of the party by\r\nrestricting the right of representation in the South to the basis\r\nof suffrage, instead of extending that basis in conformity to the\r\nright of representation.  It was a proposition to the Rebels that\r\nif they would agree that the negroes should not be counted in the\r\nbasis of representation, we would hand them over, unconditionally,\r\nto the tender mercies of their old masters.  It sanctioned the\r\nbarbarism of the Rebel State Governments in denying the right of\r\nrepresentation to their freedmen, simply because of their race and\r\ncolor, and thus struck at the very principle of Democracy.  It was\r\na scheme of cold-blooded treachery and ingratitude to a people who\r\nhad contributed nearly two hundred thousand soldiers to the armies\r\nof the Union, and among whom no traitor had ever been found; and\r\nit was urged as a means of securing equality of white representation\r\nin the Government when that object could have been perfectly attained\r\nby a constitutional amendment arming the negroes of the South with\r\nthe ballot, instead of leaving them in the absolute power of their\r\nenemies.  Of course, no man could afford to vote against the\r\nproposition to cut down rebel representation to the basis of\r\nsuffrage; but to recognize the authority of these States to make\r\npolitical outlaws of their colored citizens and incorporate this\r\nprinciple into the Constitution of the United States, was a wanton\r\nbetrayal of justice and humanity.  Congress, however, was unprepared\r\nfor more thorough work.  The conservative party which had so long\r\nsought to spare slavery was obliged, as usual, to feel its way\r\ncautiously, and wait on the logic of events; while the negro, as\r\nI shall show, was finally indebted for his franchise to the desperate\r\nmadness of his enemies in rejecting the dishonorable proposition\r\nof his friends.\r\n\r\nAs the question of reconstruction became more and more engrossing,\r\nthe signs of a breach between the President and Congress revealed\r\nthemselves.  He had disappointed the hopes of his radical friends,\r\nand begun to show his partiality for conservative and Democratic\r\nideas.  His estrangement from his party probably had its genesis\r\nin the unfortunate exhibition of himself at the inauguration of\r\nMr. Lincoln, and the condemnation of it by leading Republicans,\r\nwhich he could not forget.  Instead of keeping his promise to be\r\nthe \"Moses\" of the colored people he turned his back upon them in\r\na very offensive public speech.  His veto of the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nbill finally stripped him of all disguises, and placed him squarely\r\nagainst Congress and the people, while the House met his defiance\r\nby a concurrent resolution emphatically condemning his reconstruction\r\npolicy, and thus opening the way for the coming struggle between\r\nExecutive usurpation and the power of Congress.  His maudlin speech\r\non the 22d of February to the political mob which called on him,\r\nbranding as traitors the leaders of the party which had elected\r\nhim, completely dishonored him in the opinion of all Republicans,\r\nand awakened general alarm.  Everybody could now see the mistake\r\nof his nomination at Baltimore, and that he was simply a narrow-\r\nminded dogmatist and a bull-dog in disposition, who would do\r\nanything in his power to thwart the wishes of his former friends.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of March of this year, at the request of intelligent\r\nworking men in the employ of the Government, I introduced a bill\r\nmaking eight hours a day's work in the navy yards of the United\r\nStates.  This was the beginning of the eight hour agitation in\r\nCongress.  I had not given much thought to the necessity for such\r\nlegislation in this country, but the proposed measure seemed to me\r\nan augury of good to the working classes, as the Ten Hour movement\r\nhad proved itself to be twenty years before.  It could plead the\r\ntime laws of England as a precedent, enacted to protect humanity\r\nagainst the \"Lords of the Loom.\"  These laws recognized labor as\r\ncapital endowed with human needs, and entitled to the special\r\nguardianship of the State, and not as merchandise merely, to be\r\ngoverned solely by the law of supply and demand.  While I was a\r\nbeliever in Free Trade, I was not willing to follow its logic in\r\nall cases of conflict between capital and labor.  My warfare against\r\nchattel slavery and the monopoly of the soil had assumed the duty\r\nof the Government to secure fair play and equal opportunities to\r\nthe laboring masses, and I was willing to embody that idea in a\r\nspecific legislative proposition, and thus invite its discussion\r\nand the settlement of it upon its merits.\r\n\r\nIn April of this year a notable passage at arms occurred in the\r\nHouse between Mr. Conkling and Mr. Blaine, which has been made\r\nhistoric by the subsequent career of these great Republican chiefs.\r\nThe altercation between them was protracted and very personal, and\r\ngrew out of the official conduct of Provost Marshal General Fry.\r\nThe animosity engendered between these rivals at this early day\r\nseems never to have been intermitted, and it can best be appreciated\r\nby referring to the closing passages of their remarkable war of\r\nwords on the 30th of this month.  Mr. Conkling's language was very\r\ncontemptuous, and in concluding he said:\r\n\r\n\"If the member from Maine had the least idea of how profoundly\r\nindifferent I am to his opinion upon the subject which he has been\r\ndiscussing, or upon any other subject personal to me, I think he\r\nwould hardly take the trouble to rise here and express his opinion.\r\nAnd as it is a matter of entire indifference to me what that opinion\r\nmay be, I certainly will not detain the House by discussing the question\r\nwhether it is well or ill-founded, or by noticing what he says.\r\nI submit the whole matter to the members of the House, making, as\r\nI do, an apology (for I feel that it is due to the House) for the\r\nlength of time which I have been occupied in consequence of being\r\ndrawn into explanations, originally by an interruption which I\r\npronounced the other day ungentlemanly and impertinent, and having\r\nnothing whatever to do with the question.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, in reply, referred to Mr. Conkling's \"grandiloquent\r\nswell\" and his \"turkey gobbler strut,\" and concluded:\r\n\r\n\"I know that within the last five weeks, as members of the House\r\nwill recollect, an extra strut has characterized the gentleman's\r\nbearing.  It is not his fault.  It is the fault of another.  That\r\ngifted and satirical writer, Theodore Tilton, of the 'New York\r\nIndependent,' spent some weeks recently in this city.  His letters\r\npublished in that paper, embraced, with many serious statements,\r\na little jocose satire, a part of which was the statement that the\r\nmantle of the late Winter Davis had fallen upon the member from\r\nNew York.  The gentleman took it seriously, and it has given his\r\nstrut additional pomposity.  The resemblance is great.  It is\r\nstriking.  Hyperion to a satyr, Thersites to Hercules, mud to\r\nmarble, dung-hill to diamond, a singed cat to a Bengal tiger, a\r\nwhining puppy to a roaring lion.  Shade of the mighty Davis, forgive\r\nthe almost profanation of that jocose satire!\"\r\n\r\nThis uncomely sparring match seemed to have no significance at the\r\ntime beyond the amusement it afforded and the personal discredit\r\nit attached to the combatants; but in its later consequences it\r\nhas not only seriously involved the political fortunes of both\r\nthese ambitious men, but rent the Republican party itself into\r\nwarring factions.  Still more, it has connected itself in the same\r\nway, and not very remotely, with the nomination of General Garfield\r\nin 1880, and his subsequent assassination.  Such are the strange\r\npolitical revenges of a personal quarrel.\r\n\r\nDuring this session of Congress the policy of Military Land Bounties\r\nwas very earnestly agitated, and threatened the most alarming\r\nconsequences.  Probably no great question has been so imperfectly\r\nunderstood by our public men as the land question, and the truth\r\nof this is attested by the multiplied schemes of pillage and plunder\r\nto which the public domain has been exposed within the past thirty\r\nor forty years.  Among these the project of Land Bounties to soldiers\r\nhas been conspicuous.  Of the millions of acres disposed of by the\r\nGovernment through assignable land-warrants in the pretended interest\r\nof the soldiers of the Mexican War a very small fraction was\r\nappropriated to their use.  The great body of the land fell into\r\nthe hands of monopolists, who thus hindered the settlement and\r\nproductive wealth of the country, while the sum received by the\r\nsoldier for his warrant was in very many cases a mere mockery of\r\nhis just claims, and in no instance an adequate bounty.  The policy,\r\nhowever, had become traditional, and now, at the close of the\r\ngrandest of all our wars, it was quite natural for the country's\r\ndefenders to claim its supposed benefits.  Congress was flooded\r\nwith their petitions, and it required uncommon political courage\r\nto oppose their wishes.  It was very plausibly urged that the\r\nNation, with its heavy load of debt, could not pay a bounty in\r\nmoney, and that it should be done by drawing liberally upon the\r\nthousand million acres of the public domain.  Some of the advocates\r\nof this policy openly favored the repeal of the Homestead law for\r\nthis purpose, just as Thurlow Weed, earlier in the war, had demanded\r\nits repeal so that our public lands could be mortgaged to European\r\ncapitalists in security for the money we needed to carry on the\r\nstruggle.  The situation became critical.  Everybody was eager to\r\nreward the soldier, and especially the politicians; and there seemed\r\nto be no other way to do it than by bounties in land, for which\r\nall our previous wars furnished precedents.  The House Committee\r\non Public Lands considered the question with great care and anxiety,\r\nand in the hope of check-mating that project made a report in\r\nresponse to one of the many petitions for land bounty which had\r\nbeen referred to it, embodying some very significant facts.  It\r\nshowed that more than two millions and a quarter of soldiers would\r\nbe entitled to a bounty in land, and that it would require more\r\nthan one third of the public domain remaining undisposed of, and\r\ncover nearly all of it that was really fit for agriculture; that\r\nthe warrants would undoubtedly be made assignable, as in the case\r\nof previous bounties, and that land speculation would thus find\r\nits new birth and have free course in its dreadful ravages; and\r\nthat it would prove the practical overthrow of the policy of our\r\npre-emption and homestead laws and turn back the current of American\r\ncivilization and progress.  The report further insisted that the\r\nNation could not honorably plead poverty in bar of the great debt\r\nit owed its defenders, and it was accompanied by a bill providing\r\na bounty in money at the rate of eight and one third dollars per\r\nmonth for the time of their service, which was drawn after conferring\r\nwith intelligent men among them who fully appreciated the facts\r\nand arguments of the committee.  This report and its accompanying\r\nbill had an almost magical effect.  They not only perfectly satisfied\r\nthe soldiers everywhere, but revolutionized the opinion of both\r\nHouses of Congress, and thus saved the public domain from the\r\nwholesale spoilation that had threatened it.  The bill was referred\r\nto the Military Committee, and afterward became well known by its\r\ntitle of \"General Schenck's bill.\"  It passed the House, but failed\r\nin the Senate.  It passed the House repeatedly at different session\r\nof Congress afterward, although it never became a law; but it was\r\nthe timely and fortunate instrument through which the public domain\r\nwas saved from the wreck which menaced it in the hasty adoption of\r\na scheme which would have proved as worthless to our soldiers as\r\ndisastrous to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nMINERAL LANDS AND THE RIGHT OF PRE-EMPTION.\r\nThe lead and copper lands of the Northwest--The gold-bearing regions\r\nof the Pacific, and their disposition--A legislative reminiscence\r\n--Mining Act of 1866, and how it was passed--Its deplorable failure,\r\nand its lesson--Report of the Land Commission--The Right of Pre-\r\nemption, and the \"Dred Scott decision\" of the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Government in dealing with the mineral lands of\r\nthe United States forms one of the most curious chapters in the\r\nhistory of legislation.  It had its beginning in the famous\r\nCongressional Ordinance of May 20, 1785, which reserved one third\r\npart of all gold, silver, lead and copper mines to be sold or\r\notherwise disposed of as Congress might direct.  From this time\r\ntill the discovery of gold in California in 1848, the legislation\r\nof Congress respecting mineral lands related exclusively to those\r\ncontaining the base or merely useful metals, and applied only to\r\nthe regions now embraced by the States of Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nIowa, Illinois and Missouri.  The policy of reserving mineral lands\r\nfrom sale was obviously of feudal origin, and naturally led to the\r\nleasing of such lands by the Government, which was inaugurated by\r\nthe Act of Congress of March 3, 1807.  The Act of Congress of March\r\n3, 1829, provided for the sale of the reserved lead mines and\r\ncontiguous lands in Missouri, on six months' notice, but mineral\r\nlands elsewhere remained reserved, and continued to be leased by\r\nthe Government.  This policy was thoroughly and perseveringly tried,\r\nand proved utterly unprofitable and ruinous.  President Polk, in\r\nhis message of December 2, 1845, declared that the income derived\r\nfrom the leasing system for the years 1841, 1842, 1843 and 1844\r\nwas less than one fourth of its expense, and he recommended its\r\nabolition, and that these lands be brought into market.  The leasing\r\npolicy drew into the mining regions a population of vagrants, idlers\r\nand gamblers, who resisted the payment of tax on the product of\r\nthe mines, and defied the agents of the Government.  It excluded\r\nsober and intelligent citizens, and hindered the establishment of\r\norganized communities and the development of the mines.  The miners\r\nwere violently opposed to the policy of sale, but the evils incident\r\nto the leasing policy became so intolerable that the Government\r\nwas at length obliged to provide for the sale of the lands in fee,\r\nwhich it did by Acts of Congress of July 11, 1846, and March 1 and\r\n3, 1847.  The tracts occupied and worked by the miners under their\r\nleases possessed every variety of shape and boundary, but there\r\nwere no difficulties which were not readily adjusted under the\r\nrectangular system of surveys and the regulations of the Land\r\nDepartment.  A new class of men at once took possession of these\r\nregions as owners of the soil, brought their families with them,\r\nlaid the foundations of social order, expelled the semi-barbarians\r\nwho had secured a temporary occupancy, and thus, at once promoted\r\ntheir own welfare, the prosperity of the country, and the financial\r\ninterests of the Government.  Under this reformed policy the lead\r\nand copper lands of the regions named were disposed of in fee.\r\n\r\nBut the gold-bearing regions covered by our Mexican acquisitions\r\ncreated a new dispensation in mining, and invited the attention of\r\nCongress to the consideration of a new and exceedingly important\r\nquestion.  How should these mineral lands be disposed of?  They\r\ncovered an area of a million square miles, and their exploration\r\nand development became a matter of the most vital moment, not only\r\nin a financial point of view, but as a means of promoting the\r\nsettlement and tillage of the agricultural lands contiguous to the\r\nmineral deposits.  President Fillmore, in his message of December\r\n2, 1849, recommended the sale of these lands in small parcels, and\r\nMr. Ewing, his Secretary of the Interior, urged upon Congress the\r\nconsideration of the subject, and recommended the policy of leasing\r\nthem; but no attention seems to have been given to these recommendations.\r\nBy Act of Congress of September 27, 1850, mineral lands in Oregon\r\nwere reserved from sale; and by Acts of March 3, 1853, and of July\r\n22, 1854, they were reserved in California and New Mexico.  This\r\nwas the extent of Congressional action.  Early in the late war,\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, Hon. Caleb B. Smith, referred to\r\nthe question, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office\r\nafterward repeatedly recommended the policy of leasing, but Congress\r\ntook no notice of the subject.  My interest in the question was\r\nfirst awakened in the fall of 1864, in carefully overhauling our\r\nland policy.  Our mineral lands for more than sixteen years had\r\nbeen open to all comers from whatever quarter of the globe, during\r\nwhich time more than a thousand million dollars had been extracted,\r\nfrom which not a dollar of revenue reached the National Treasury\r\nsave the comparatively trifling amount derived from the Internal\r\nRevenue tax on bullion.  This fact was so remarkable that it was\r\ndifficult to accept it as true.  The Government had no policy\r\nwhatever in dealing with these immense repositories of national\r\nwealth, and declined to have any; for a policy implies that something\r\nis to be done, and points out the method of doing it.  It had\r\nprohibited the sale of mineral lands, and then come to a dead halt.\r\nThe Constitution expressly provides that Congress shall have power\r\n\"to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory\r\nor other property belonging to the United States\"; but Congress,\r\nin reserving these lands from sale and taking no measures whatever\r\nrespecting their products, simply abandoned them, and, as the\r\ntrustee of the Nation, became as recreant as the father who abandons\r\nhis minor child.\r\n\r\nThe case was a very curious one, and the more I considered it, the\r\nmore astonished I became at the strange indifference of the\r\nGovernment, and that no public man of any party had ever given the\r\nsubject the slightest attention.  The Nation had been selling its\r\nlands containing iron, copper and lead, and the policy of vesting\r\nan absolute fee in individual proprietors had been accepted on\r\nactual trial, and after the leasing policy had signally failed,\r\nand I could see nothing in the distinction between the useful and\r\nprecious metals which required a different policy for the latter.\r\nSome policy was absolutely demanded.  The country, loaded down by\r\na great and continually increasing war debt, could not afford to\r\nturn away from so tempting a source of revenue.  To sleep over its\r\ngrand opportunity was as stupid as it was criminal.  It was obvious\r\nthat if the Government continued to reserve these lands from sale,\r\nsome form of tax or royalty on their products must be resorted to\r\nas a measure of financial policy; but this would have involved the\r\nsame political anomaly as the policy of leasing, and the same\r\nfailure.  In principle it was the same.  To retain the fee of the\r\nlands in the Government and impose a rent upon their occupiers,\r\nwould make the Government a great landlord, and the miners its\r\ntenants.  Such a policy would not be American, but European.  It\r\nwould not be Democratic, but Feudal.  It would be to follow the\r\nGovernments of the Old World, which reserve their mineral lands\r\nfor the Crown, because they are esteemed too precious for the\r\npeople.  It was at war with our theory of Democracy, which has\r\nrespect chiefly to the individual, and seeks to strengthen the\r\nGovernment by guarding his rights and promoting his well-being.\r\nThese considerations convinced me that the time had come to abandon\r\nthe non-action course of the Government, and adopt a policy in\r\nharmony with our general legislation; and that the survey and sale\r\nof these lands in fee was the best and only method of promoting\r\nsecurity of titles, permanent settlements, and thorough development.\r\nAs early as December, 1864, I therefore introduced a bill embodying\r\nthis policy, which was followed by a similar measure, early in the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress, accompanied by an elaborate report, arguing\r\nthe question pretty fully, and combating all the objections to the\r\nprinciple and policy of sale.  My views were commended by Secretary\r\nMcCullough, as they had been by Mr. Chase, while I was glad to find\r\nthem supported by intelligent men from California, who spoke from\r\nactual observation and extensive experience in mining.\r\n\r\nBut although this measure fully protected all miners in the right\r\nof exploration and discovery, and carefully guarded against any\r\ninterference with vested rights, the idea was in some way rapidly\r\nand extensively propagated that it contemplated a sweeping confiscation\r\nof all their claims, and the less informed among them became wild\r\nwith excitement.  The politicians of California and Nevada, instead\r\nof endeavoring to enlighten them and quiet this excitement, yielded\r\nto it absolutely.  They became as completely its instruments as\r\nthey have since been of the Anti-Mongolian feeling.  They argued,\r\nat first, that no Congressional legislation was necessary, and that\r\nwhile the Government should retain the fee of these lands, the\r\nminers should have the entire control of them under regulations\r\nprescribed by themselves.  This, it was believed, would placate\r\nthe miners and settle the question; but the introduction of the\r\nmeasure referred to, and the agitation of the question, had made\r\nsome form of legislation inevitable, and the question now was to\r\ndetermine what that legislation should be.  Senators Conness of\r\nCalifornia, and Stewart of Nevada, who were exceedingly hostile to\r\nthe bill I had introduced, and feared its passage, sought to avert\r\nit by carrying through the Senate \"a bill to regulate the occupation\r\nof mineral lands and to extend the right of pre-emption thereto,\"\r\nwhich they hoped would satisfy their constituents and prevent\r\nfurther legislation.  They supported it as the next best thing to\r\ntotal non-action by Congress.  It provided for giving title to the\r\nminers, but it did this by practically abdicating the jurisdiction\r\nof the National Government over these lands, with its recognized\r\nand well-settled machinery for determining all questions of title\r\nand boundary, and handing them over to \"the local custom or rules\r\nof the miners.\"  These \"local rules\" were to govern the miner in\r\nthe location, extension and boundary of his claim, the manner of\r\ndeveloping it, and the survey also, which was not to be executed\r\nwith any reference to base lines as in the case of other public\r\nlands, but in utter disregard of the same.  The Surveyor General\r\nwas to make a plat or diagram of the claim, and transmit it to the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office, who, as the mere agent\r\nand clerk of the miner, with no judicial authority whatever, was\r\nrequired to issue the patent.  In case of any conflict between\r\nclaimants it was to be determined by the \"local courts,\" without\r\nany right of appeal to the local land offices, the General Land\r\nOffice, or to the Federal courts.  The Government was thus required\r\nto part with its lands by proceedings executed by officials wholly\r\noutside of its jurisdiction, and irresponsible to its authority.\r\nThe act not only abolished our rectangular system of surveys, but\r\nstill further insulted the principles of mathematics and the dictates\r\nof common sense by providing that the claimant should have the\r\nright to follow his vein or lode, \"with its dips, angles and\r\nvariations to any depth, although it may enter the land adjoining,\r\nwhich land adjoining shall be sold subject to this condition\"; a\r\nright unknown to the mining codes of England, France or Prussia,\r\nand not sanctioned by those of Spain or Mexico.  Subject to this\r\nnovel principle the crudely extemporized rules of the miners were\r\nto be recognized as law, and this system of instability and\r\nuncertainty made the basis of title and the arbiter of all disputes,\r\ninstead of sweeping it away and ushering in a system of permanence\r\nand peace through the well-appointed agency of the Land Department.\r\nIt was easy to see that this was an act to encourage litigation\r\nand for the benefit of lawyers, and not to promote the real interest\r\nof the miners or increase the product of the mines.\r\n\r\nThis was made perfectly clear at the time, by the report of a Senate\r\ncommittee of the Legislature of Nevada.  In speaking of the local\r\nlaws of the miners, it says, \"There never was confusion worse\r\nconfounded.  More than two hundred districts within the limit of\r\na single State, each with its self-approved code; these codes\r\ndiffering not alone each from the other, but presenting numberless\r\ninstances of contradiction in themselves.  The law of one point is\r\nnot the law of another five miles distant, and a little further on\r\nwill be a code which is the law of neither of the former, and so\r\non, _ad inifitum;_ with the further disturbing fact superadded,\r\nthat the written laws themselves may be overrun by some peculiar\r\ncustom which can be found nowhere recorded, and the proof of which\r\nwill vary with the volume of interested affidavits which may be\r\nbrought on either side to establish it.  Again, in one district\r\nthe work to be done to hold a claim is nominal, in another exorbitant,\r\nin another abolished, in another adjourned from year to year.  A\r\nstranger, seeking to ascertain the law, is surprised to learn that\r\nthere is no satisfactory public record to which he can refer; no\r\npublic officer to whom he may apply, who is under any bond or\r\nobligation to furnish him information, or guarantee its authenticity.\r\nOften, in the new districts, he finds there is not even the semblance\r\nof a code, but a simple resolution adopting the code of some other\r\ndistrict, which may be a hundred miles distant.  What guarantee\r\nhas he for the investment of either capital or labor under such a\r\nsystem?\"  The report proceeds to show that these regulations can\r\nhave no permanency.  \"A miners' meeting,\" it declares, \"adopts a\r\ncode; it stands apparently as the law.  Some time after, on a few\r\ndays' notice, a corporal's guard assembles, and, on simple motion,\r\nradically changes the whole system by which claims may be held in\r\na district.  Before a man may traverse the State, the laws of a\r\ndistrict, which by examination and study he may have mastered, may\r\nbe swept away, and no longer stand as the laws which govern the\r\ninterest he may have acquired; and the change has been one which\r\nby no reasonable diligence could he be expected to have knowledge\r\nof.\"  Of course these facts thus officially stated in the interest\r\nof the miners of Nevada, were applicable to California, and all\r\nthe mining States and Territories, and they fitly and very forcibly\r\nrebuked the attempt to enact the Senate bill.\r\n\r\nWhen this bill reached the House it was properly referred to the\r\nCommittee on Public Lands, which then had under consideration the\r\nbill I had reported providing for the survey and sale of mineral\r\nlands through the regular machinery of the Land Department.  The\r\nHouse Committee subsequently reported it favorably, and could not\r\nbe persuaded by the delegations from California and Nevada to adopt\r\nthe Senate bill as a substitute.  Senators Stewart and Conness,\r\nfinding their project thus baffled, and becoming impatient of delay\r\nas the session neared its close, called up a House bill entitled\r\n\"An Act granting the right of way to ditch and canal owners over\r\nthe Public Lands in the States of California, Oregon and Nevada,\"\r\nand succeeded, by sharp practice, in carrying a motion to strike\r\nout the whole of the bill except the enacting clause, and insert\r\nthe bill which the Senate had already enacted and was then before\r\nthe House Committee.  This maneuver succeeded, and the bill, thus\r\nenacted by the Senate a second time, and now under a false title,\r\nwas sent to the House, where it found its place on the Speaker's\r\ntable, and was lying in wait for the sudden and unlooked-for movement\r\nwhich was to follow.  The title was misleading, and thus enabled\r\nMr. Ashley of Nevada, to obtain the floor when it was reached, and\r\nunder the gag, which of course would cut off all amendment and\r\ndebate, he attempted to force through a measure revolutionizing\r\nthe whole land policy of the Government so far as relates to the\r\nWestern side of the continent, and surrendering the national\r\nauthority over its vast magazines of mineral wealth to the legalized\r\njargon and bewilderment I have depicted.  I succeeded in preventing\r\na vote by carrying an adjournment, but the question came up the\r\nnext day, and the Senators referred to, with their allies in the\r\nHouse, had used such marvelous industry in organizing and drilling\r\ntheir forces, and the majority of the members knew so little about\r\nthe question involved, that I found the chances decidedly against\r\nme.  I was obliged, also, to encounter a prevailing but perfectly\r\nunwarranted presumption that the representatives of the mining\r\nStates were the best judges of the question in dispute, while it\r\nwas foolishly regarded as a local one, with which the old States\r\nhad no concern.  The clumsy and next to incomprehensible bill thus\r\nbecame a law, and by legislative methods as indefensible as the\r\nmeasure itself.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of this remarkable experiment in legislation;\r\nbut it is an experiment no longer.  Its character has been perfectly\r\nestablished by time, and the logic of actual facts.  It has been\r\nextensively and thoroughly tried, and after repeated attempts to\r\namend it by supplementary legislation, its failure stands recorded\r\nin the manifold evils it has wrought.  The Land Commission, appointed\r\nunder the administration of President Hayes in pursuance of an Act\r\nof Congress to classify the Public Lands and codify the laws relating\r\nto their disposition, visited the mining States and Territories in\r\ndetail, and devoted ample time to the examination of witnesses and\r\nexperts in every important locality touching the policy and practical\r\noperation of the laws in force relating to mineral lands.  This\r\nCommission condemned these laws on the strength of overwhelming\r\nevidence, and recommended a thorough and radical reform, including\r\nthe reference of all disputed questions as to title and boundary\r\nto the regular officials of the United States; the abolition of\r\nthe \"local custom or rules of miners,\" with the \"local courts\"\r\nprovided for their adjudication; and the adoption of the United\r\nStates surveys as far as practicable, including the geodetical\r\nprinciple of ownership in lieu of the policy of allowing the miner\r\nto follow his vein, \"with its dips, angles and variations under\r\nthe adjoining land of his neighbor,\" which policy is declared to\r\nbe the source of incalculable legislation.  The Commission, in\r\nshort, urged the adoption of the principles of the Common Law and\r\nthe employment of the appropriate machinery of the Land Department,\r\nas a substitute for the frontier regulations which Congress made\r\nhaste to nationalize in 1866.  It declared that under these\r\nregulations \"title after title hangs on a local record which may\r\nbe defective, mutilated, stolen for blackmail, or destroyed to\r\naccomplish fraud, and of which the grantor, the Government, has\r\nneither knowledge nor control\"; that in the evidence taken \"it was\r\nrepeatedly shown that two or three prospectors, camped in the\r\nwilderness, have organized a mining district, prescribed regulations\r\ninvolving size of claims, mode of location and nature of record,\r\nelected one of their number recorder, and that officer, on the back\r\nof an envelope, or on the ace of spades grudgingly spared from his\r\npack, can make with the stump of a lead pencil an entry that the\r\nGovernment recognizes as the inception of a title which may convey\r\nmillions of dollars; that even when the recorder is duly elected\r\nhe is not responsible to the United States, is neither bonded nor\r\nunder oath, may falsify or destroy his record, may vitiate the\r\ntitle to millions of dollars, and snap his fingers in the face of\r\nthe Government; and that our present mining law might fitly be\r\nentitled 'An Act to cause the Government to join, upon unknown\r\nterms, with an unknown second party, to convey to a third party an\r\nillusory title to an indefinite thing, and encourage the subsequent\r\nrobbery thereof.'\"\r\n\r\nThese strong statements are made by a Government commission composed\r\nof able and impartial men, who were guided in their patient search\r\nafter the truth by the evidence of \"a cloud of witnesses,\" who\r\nspoke from personal knowledge and experience.  The character of\r\nour mining laws is therefore not a matter of theory, but of\r\ndemonstrated fact.  They scourge the mining States and Territories\r\nwith the unspeakable curse of uncertainty of land titles, as\r\neverywhere attested by incurable litigation and strife.  They thus\r\nundermine the morals of the people, and pave the way for violence\r\nand crime.  They cripple a great national industry and source of\r\nwealth, and insult the principles of American jurisprudence.  And\r\nthe misfortune of this legislation is heightened by the probability\r\nof its continuance; for it is not easy to uproot a body of laws\r\nonce accepted by a people, however mischievous in their character.\r\nCustom, and the faculty of adaptation, have a very reconciling\r\ninfluence upon communities as well as individuals.  Moreover, men\r\nabsorbed in a feverish and hazardous industry, and stimulated by\r\nthe hope of sudden wealth, are not disposed to consider the advantages\r\nof permanent ownership and security of title.  Their business is\r\nto make their locations according to local custom, and sell out to\r\nthe capitalists; while the men who feel the burden of litigation\r\nand the evil of uncertain titles, are not the men who control public\r\nopinion and influence the course of legislation.  It may thus happen\r\nthat a system of laws initiated by itinerant miners solely for the\r\nprotection of their transient posessory interests, and carried\r\nthrough Congress at their behest by parliamentary roguery, may be\r\npermanently engrafted upon half the continent.  If California had\r\nbeen contiguous to the older States, and her mining operations had\r\nonly kept pace with the progress of settlements, or if her\r\nrepresentatives had been less ready to sacrifice the enduring\r\ninterests of their constituents for temporary and selfish ends,\r\nthe wretched travesty of law which now afflicts the States and\r\nTerritories of the West would have been unknown, and the same code\r\nand forms of administration would have prevailed from the lakes to\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of this vital mistake is a pregnant one.  The laws\r\nregulating the ownership and disposition of landed property not\r\nonly affect the well-being but frequently the destiny of a people.\r\nThe system of primogeniture and entail adopted by the Southern\r\nStates of our Union favored the policy of great estates, and the\r\nruinous system of landlordism and slavery which finally laid waste\r\nthe fairest and most fertile section of the republic and threatened\r\nits life; while the New England States, in adopting a different\r\nsystem, laid the foundations of their prosperity in the soil itself,\r\nand \"took a bond of fate\" for the welfare of unborn generations.\r\nTheir political institutions were the logical outcome of their laws\r\nrespecting landed property, which favored a great subdivision of\r\nthe land and great equality among the people, thus promoting\r\nprosperous cultivation, compact communities, general education, a\r\nhealthy public opinion, democracy in managing the affairs of the\r\nchurch, and that system of local self government which has since\r\nprevailed over so many States.  So intimate and vital are the\r\nrelations between a community and the soil it occupies that in the\r\nnomenclature of politics the word \"people\" and \"land\" are convertible\r\nterms; but no people can prosper under any system of land tenures\r\nwhich tolerates a vexatious uncertainty of title, and thus prompts\r\nevery man to become the enemy of his neighbor in the scuffle for\r\nhis rights.  Such a state of affairs is worse than pestilence or\r\nfamine; but the evil of uncertain titles puts on new and very\r\naggravated forms in our gold-bearing regions.  The business of\r\nmining naturally awakens the strongest passions.  It sharpens the\r\nfaculties and dulls the conscience.  It gives to cupidity its\r\nkeenest edge.  Its prizes are often rich and suddenly gained, and\r\nwhen they are sought through the forms of a law which compels a\r\nman to choose between an expensive and hazardous litigation and\r\nrobbery, human nature is severely tried.  No situation could well\r\nbe more deplorable than that which obliges a man to pay heavy black-\r\nmail as the only means of saving his property from legal confiscation\r\nby another; and the moral ravages of a code which allows this can\r\nnot be computed.  It tempts civilized men to become savages and\r\nsavages to become devils.  It is not a mistake merely, but a great\r\nmisfortune, that our laws touching so delicate and vital a question\r\nas the ownership and transfer of mineral lands were not so framed\r\nas to avert these frightful evils.  As far as the past is concerned\r\nthey are without remedy, and there is no positive safeguard for\r\nthe future but in a return to the time-honored principles which\r\ngive to the owner of the surface all that may be found within his\r\nlines, extended downward vertically, and refer all disputes to the\r\nold-fashioned and familiar machinery of the General Land Office.\r\nThis system gave order and peace to the great lead and copper\r\nregions of the Northwest, and it would bring with it the same\r\ninestimable blessings to the harassed and sorely tried regions of\r\nthe Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the action of Congress supplied another example\r\nof hasty and slip-shod legislation, which has been perhaps equally\r\nprolific of evil.  The State of California, soon after her admission,\r\nhad assumed the right to dispose of the public lands within her\r\nborders according to her own peculiar wishes, and in disregard of\r\nthe authority of the United States.  This led to such serious\r\nconflicts and complications, that a remedy was sought in a bill to\r\nquiet land titles in that State.  It was a very questionable measure,\r\ninasmuch as the parties claiming title under the State could only\r\nbe relieved by recognizing her illegal acts as valid, and at the\r\nexpense of claimants under the laws of the United States.  It\r\nnecessarily involved the right of pre-emption, and this was distinctly\r\npresented in connection with what was known as the Suscol Ranch in\r\nthat State.  It contained about ninety thousand acres, and was\r\ncovered by an old Spanish grant which the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States in the year 1862 had pronounced void, soon after\r\nwhich numerous settlers went upon the land as pre-emptors, as they\r\nhad a right to do.  Their claims as such, being disputed by parties\r\nasserting title under the void grant, the General Land Office, on\r\nthe reference of the question to that department, decided in favor\r\nof the pre-emptors, upon which the opposing parties procured the\r\nsubmission of the question to the Attorney-General.  That officer\r\ngave his opinion to the effect that a settler under the pre-emption\r\nlaws acquires no vested interest in the land he occupies by virtue\r\nof his settlement, and can acquire no such interest, till he has\r\ntaken _all_ the legal steps necessary to perfect an entrance in\r\nthe Land Office, being, in the meantime, a mere tenant-at-will,\r\nwho may be ejected by the Government at any moment in favor of\r\nanother party.  In pursuance of this opinion scores of _bona fide_\r\nsettlers were driven from their pre-emptions, which the laws of\r\nthe United States had offered them, on certain prescribed conditions,\r\nwith which they were willing and anxious to comply, and their homes,\r\nwith the valuable improvements made upon them in good faith, were\r\nhanded over to speculators and monopolists.  The proceeding was as\r\noutrageous as the ruling which authorized it was surprising to the\r\nwhole country; and it naturally awakened uneasiness and alarm among\r\nour pioneer settlers everywhere.  It seemed to me very proper,\r\ntherefore, that in a bill to quiet land titles in California, these\r\ntroubles on this Ranch should be settled by a fitting amendment,\r\nwhich should protect the rights of these pre-emptors against the\r\neffect of the ruling referred to.  The opinions of the Attorney-\r\nGeneral had completely overturned the whole policy of the Government\r\nas popularly understood, and I simply proposed to restore it by a\r\nproviso guarding the rights of _bona fide_ settlers who were claiming\r\ntitle under the laws of the United States; but to my perfect\r\namazement I found the California delegation bitterly opposed to\r\nthis amendment.  The reading of it threw them into a spasm of rage,\r\nand showed that they were less anxious to quiet titles in their\r\nState than to serve the monopolies and rings which had trampled on\r\nthe laws of the United States, and thus involved themselves in\r\ntrouble.  The zeal and industry of the delegation in this opposition\r\ncould only be paralleled by their labors for the passage of their\r\nmineral land bill; and the same appeals were made in both cases.\r\nThey said this was a \"local measure,\" and that they understood the\r\ninterests of the Pacific coast better than men from the old States,\r\nwhile they begged and button-holed members with a pertinacity very\r\nrarely witnessed in any legislative body.  They turned the business\r\nof log-rolling to such account that the amendment was defeated by\r\na strong majority, while it proved the entering wedge to other and\r\ngreater outrages upon the rights of settlers which the country has\r\nsince witnessed, and was followed by a decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, fully affirming the principle laid down\r\nin the opinion of the Attorney General.  This ruling, which has\r\nbeen aptly styled \"the Dred Scott decision of the American Pioneer,\"\r\nhas been repeatedly re-affirmed, while the claim of pre-emption,\r\nonce universally regarded as a substantial right, has faded away\r\ninto a glamour or myth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nRECONSTRUCTION AND IMPEACHMENT.\r\nGov. Morton and his scheme of Gerrymandering--The XIV Amendment--\r\nHasty reconstruction and the Territorial plan--The Military Bill--\r\nImpeachment--An amusing incident--Vote against impeachment--The\r\nvote reversed--The popular feeling against the President--The trial\r\n--Republican intolerance--Injustice to senators and to Chief Justice\r\nChase--Nomination of Gen. Grant--Re-nomination for Congress--Personal\r\n--Squabble of place-hunters--XVI Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe fall elections of this year were complicated by the hostile\r\ninfluence of the Executive, but the popular current was strongly\r\non the side of Congress.  A few prominent Republican members followed\r\nthe President, but the great body of them stood firm.  In my own\r\nCongressional district my majority was over 6,200, notwithstanding\r\nthe formidable conservative opposition in my own party, and its\r\nextraordinary efforts to divide the Republicans through the patronage\r\nof the Administration.  Nearly all of my old opponents in the\r\ndistrict and State were now Johnsonized, except Gov. Morton, whose\r\ntemporary desertion the year before was atoned for by a prudent\r\nand timely repentance.  He was not, however, thoroughly reconstructed;\r\nfor in the Philadelphia Loyal Convention which met in September of\r\nthis year to consider the critical state of the country, he used\r\nhis influence with the delegates from the South to prevent their\r\nespousal of Negro Suffrage, and begged Theodore Tilton to prevail\r\non Frederick Douglass to take the first train of cars for home, in\r\norder to save the Republican party from detriment.  He was still\r\nunder the shadow of his early Democratic training; and he and his\r\nsatellites, vividly remembering my campaign for Negro Suffrage the\r\nyear before, and finding me thoroughly intrenched in my Congressional\r\ndistrict, hit upon a new project for my political discomfiture.\r\nThis was the re-districting of the State at the ensuing session of\r\nthe Indiana Legislature, which they succeeded in accomplishing by\r\ndisguising their real purpose.  There was neither reason nor excuse\r\nfor such a scheme at this time, apart from my political fortunes;\r\nand by the most shameless Gerrymandering three counties of my\r\ndistrict, which gave me a majority of 5,000, were taken from me,\r\nand four others added in which I was personally but little acquainted,\r\nand which gave an aggregate Democratic majority of about 1,500.\r\nThis was preliminary to the next Congressional race, and the success\r\nof the enterprise remained to be tested; but it furnished a curious\r\nillustration of the state of Indiana Republicanism at that time.\r\n\r\nOn the meeting of Congress in December the signs of political\r\nprogress since the adjournment were quite noticeable.  The subject\r\nof impeachment began to be talked about, and both houses seemed\r\nready for all necessary measures.  Since mingling freely with their\r\nconstituents, very few Republican members insisted that the XIV\r\nConstitutional Amendment should be accepted as a finality, or as\r\nan adequate solution of the problem of reconstruction.  The second\r\nsection of that amendment, proposing to abandon the colored race\r\nin the South on condition that they should not be counted in the\r\nbasis of representation, was now generally condemned, and if the\r\nquestion had been a new one it could not have been adopted.  This\r\nenlightenment of Northern representatives was largely due to the\r\nprompt and contemptuous rejection by the rebellious States of the\r\nXIV Amendment as a scheme of reconstruction, and their enactment\r\nof black codes which made the condition of the freedmen more\r\ndeplorable than slavery itself.  In this instance, as in that of\r\nMr. Lincoln's Proclamation of Emancipation, it was rebel desperation\r\nwhich saved the negro; for if the XIV Amendment had been at first\r\naccepted, the work of reconstruction would have ended without\r\nconferring upon him the ballot.  This will scarcely be denied by\r\nany one, and has been frankly admitted by some of the most\r\ndistinguished leaders of the party.\r\n\r\nThe policy of treating these States as Territories seemed now to\r\nbe rapidly gaining ground, and commended itself as the only logical\r\nway out of the political dilemma in which the Government was placed.\r\nBut here again the old strife between radicalism and conservatism\r\ncropped out.  The former opposed all haste in the work of\r\nreconstruction.  It insisted that what the rebellious districts\r\nneeded was not an easy and speedy return to the places they had\r\nlost by their treasonable conspiracy, but a probationary training,\r\nlooking to their restoration when they should prove their fitness\r\nfor civil government as independent States.  It was insisted that\r\nthey were not prepared for this, and that with their large population\r\nof ignorant negroes and equally ignorant whites, dominated by a\r\nformidable oligarchy of educated land-owners who despised the power\r\nthat had conquered them, while they still had the sympathy of their\r\nold allies in the North, the withdrawal of Federal intervention\r\nand the unhindered operation of local supremacy would as fatally\r\nhedge up the way of justice and equality as the rebel despotisms\r\nthen existing.  The political and social forces of Southern society,\r\nif unchecked from without, were sure to assert themselves, and the\r\nmore decided anti-slavery men in both houses of Congress so warned\r\nthe country, and foretold that no theories of Democracy could avail\r\nunless adequately supported by a healthy and intelligent public\r\nopinion.  They saw that States must grow, and could not be suddenly\r\nconstructed where the materials were wanting, and that forms are\r\nworthless in the hands of an ignorant mob.  It was objected to the\r\nterritorial theory that it was arbitrary, and would lead to corruption\r\nand tyranny like the pro-consular system of Rome; but it was simply\r\nthe territorial system to which we had been accustomed from the\r\nbeginning of the Government, and could not prove worse than the\r\nhasty re-admission of ten conquered districts to the dignity of\r\nStates of the Union, involving, as it has done, the horrors of\r\ncarpet-bag government, Ku Klux outrages, and a system of pro-consular\r\ntyranny as inconsistent with the rights of these States as it has\r\nbeen disgraceful to the very idea of free government and fatal to\r\nthe best interests of the colored race.\r\n\r\nBut the strange chaos of opinion which now prevailed was unfavorable\r\nto sound thinking or wise acting.  Great and far-reaching interests\r\nwere at stake, but they were made the sport of politicians, and\r\ndisposed of in the light of their supposed effect upon the ascendancy\r\nof the Republican party.  Statesmanship was sacrificed to party\r\nmanagement, and the final result was that the various territorial\r\nbills which had been introduced in both Houses, and the somewhat\r\nincongruous bills of Stevens and Ashley, were all superseded by\r\nthe passage of the \"Military bill,\" which was vetoed by the President,\r\nbut re-enacted in the face of his objections.  This bill was utterly\r\nindefensible on principle.  It was completely at war with the genius\r\nand spirit of democratic government.  Instead of furnishing the\r\nRebel districts with civil governments, and providing for a military\r\nforce adequate to sustain them, it abolished civil government\r\nentirely, and installed the army in its place.  It was a confession\r\nof Congressional incompetence to deal with a problem which Congress\r\nalone had the right to solve.  Its provisions perfectly exposed it\r\nto all the objections which could be urged to the plan of territorial\r\nreconstruction, while they inaugurated a centralized military\r\ndespotism in the place of that system of well-understood local self-\r\ngovernment which the territorial policy offered as a preparation\r\nfor restoration.  The measure was analyzed and exposed with great\r\nability by Henry J. Raymond, whose arguments were unanswered and\r\nunanswerable; but nothing could stay the prevailing impatience of\r\nCongress for speedy legislation looking to the early return of the\r\nrebel districts to their places in the Union.  The bill was a\r\nlegislative solecism.  It did not abrogate the existing Rebel State\r\ngovernments.  It left the ballot in the hands of white Rebels, and\r\ndid not confer it upon the black loyalists.  It sought to conciliate\r\nthe power it was endeavoring to coerce.  It provided for negro\r\nsuffrage as one of the fundamental conditions on which the rebellious\r\nStates should be restored to their places in the Union, but left\r\nthe negro to the mercy of their black codes, pending the decision\r\nof the question of their acceptance of the proposed conditions of\r\nrestoration.  The freedmen were completely in the power of their\r\nold masters, so long as the latter might refuse the terms of\r\nreconstruction that were offered; and they had the option to refuse\r\nthem entirely, if they saw fit to prefer their own mad ascendancy\r\nand its train of disorders to compulsory restoration.  This perfectly\r\ninexcusable abandonment of negro suffrage was zealously defended\r\nby a small body of conservative Republicans who were still lingering\r\nin the sunshine of executive favor, and of whom Mr. Blaine was the\r\nchief; and it was through the timely action of Mr. Shellabarger,\r\nof Ohio, which these conservatives opposed, that the scheme of\r\nreconstruction was finally so amended as to make the Rebel State\r\ngovernments provisional only, and secure the ballot to the negro\r\nduring the period, whether long or short, which might intervene\r\nprior to the work of re-admission.  This provision was absolutely\r\nvital, because it took from the people of the insurrectionary\r\ndistricts every motive for refusing the acceptance of the terms\r\nproposed, and settled the work of reconstruction by this exercise\r\nof absolute power by their conquerors.  It was this provision which\r\nsecured the support of the Radical Republicans in Congress; but it\r\ndid not meet their objections to this scheme of hasty military\r\nreconstruction, while these objections have been amply justified\r\nby time.\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens never appeared to such splendid advantage as a\r\nparliamentary leader as in this protracted debate on reconstruction.\r\nHe was then nearly seventy-six, and was physically so feeble that\r\nhe could scarcely stand; but his intellectual resources seemed to\r\nbe perfectly unimpaired.  Eloquence, irony, wit, and invective,\r\nwre charmingly blended in the defense of his positions and his\r\nattacks upon his opponents.  In dealing with the views of Bingham,\r\nBlaine, and Banks, he was by no means complimentary.  He referred\r\nto them in his closing speech on the bill, on the thirteenth of\r\nFebruary, when he said, in response to an interruption by Mr.\r\nBlaine, \"What I am speaking of is this proposed step toward universal\r\namnesty and universal Andy-Johnsonism.  If this Congress so decides,\r\nit will give me great pleasure to join in the _io triumphe_ of the\r\ngentleman from Ohio in leading this House, possibly by forbidden\r\npaths, into the sheep-fold or the goat-fold of the President.\"  In\r\nspeaking of the amendment to the bill offered by General Banks, he\r\nsaid, \"It proposes to set up a contrivance at the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, and by hydraulic action to control all the States that\r\nare washed by the waters of that great stream.\"  He declared that,\r\n\"The amendment of the gentleman from Maine lets in a vast number\r\nof Rebels, and shuts out nobody.  All I ask is that when the House\r\ncomes to vote upon that amendment, it shall understand that the\r\nadoption of it would be an entire surrender of those States into\r\nthe hands of the Rebels. * * * If, sir, I might presume upon my\r\nage, without claiming any of the wisdom of Nestor, I would suggest\r\nto the young gentlemen around me, that the deeds of this burning\r\ncrisis, of this solemn day, of this thrilling moment, will cast\r\ntheir shadows far into the future, and will make their impress upon\r\nthe annals of our history; and that we shall appear upon the bright\r\npages of that history just in so far as we cordially, without guile,\r\nwithout bickering, without small criticisms, lend our aid to promote\r\nthe great cause of humanity and universal liberty.\"\r\n\r\nAs a precautionary measure against executive usurpation, the Fortieth\r\nCongress was organized in March, 1867, immediately after the\r\nadjournment of the Thirty-ninth.  After a brief session it adjourned\r\ntill the third of July to await the further progress of events.\r\nOn re-assembling I found the feeling in favor of impeachment had\r\nconsiderably increased, but was not yet strong enough to prevail.\r\nAll that could be done was the passage of a supplemental act on\r\nthe subject of reconstruction, which naturally provoked another\r\nveto, in which the President re-affirmed the points of his message\r\nvetoing the original bill, and arraigned the action of Congress as\r\nhigh-handed and despotic.  The message was construed by the\r\nRepublicans as an open defiance, and many of them felt that a great\r\nduty had been slighted in failing to impeach him months before.\r\nThe feeling against him became perfectly relentless, as I distinctly\r\nremember it, and shared in it myself; but on referring to the\r\nmessage now, I am astonished at the comparative moderation of its\r\ntone, and the strength of its positions.  Its logic, in the main,\r\nis impregnable, if it be granted that the Rebel districts were not\r\nonly States, but States _in the Union,_ and the Congress which was\r\nnow so enraged at the President had itself refused to deal with\r\nthem as Territories or outlying possessions, and thereby invited\r\nthe aggravating thrusts of the message at the consistency of his\r\nassailants.\r\n\r\nJust before the adjournment of this brief session of Congress, an\r\namusing incident occurred in connection with the introduction of\r\nthe following resolution in the House:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved,_ That the doctrines avowed by the President of the\r\nUnited States, in his message to Congress of the fifteenth instant,\r\nto the effect that the abrogation of the governments of the Rebel\r\nStates binds the Nation to pay the debts incurred prior to the late\r\nRebellion, is at war with the principles of international law, a\r\ndeliberate stab at the national credit, abhorrent to every sentiment\r\nof loyalty, and well-pleasing only to the vanquished traitors by\r\nwhose agency alone the governments of said States were overthrown\r\nand destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted by yeas one hundred, nays eighteen, and\r\nthe announcement of the vote provoked the laughter of both sides\r\nof the House.  It gratified the Republicans, because it was a thrust\r\nat Andrew Johnson, and perfectly accorded with their prevailing\r\npolitical mood, which was constantly becoming more embittered toward\r\nhim.  It equally gratified the Democrats, because they at once\r\naccepted it as a telling shot at Gov. Morton, who had fathered the\r\ncondemned heresy nearly two years before in his famous Richmond\r\nspeech, which he and his friends had been doing their best to\r\nforget.  Party feeling had never before been more intense; but this\r\nresolution performed its mediatorial office with such magical effect\r\nin playing with two utterly diverse party animosities, that\r\nRepublicans and Democrats were alike surprised to find themselves\r\nsuddenly standing on common ground, and joyfully shaking hands in\r\ntoken of this remarkable display of their good fellowship.\r\n\r\nCongress assembled again on the twenty-first of November, in\r\nconsequence of the extraordinary conduct of the President.  The\r\npopular feeling in favor of impeachment had now become formidable,\r\nand on the twenty-fifth the Judiciary Committee of the House finally\r\nreported in favor of the measure.  The galleries were packed, and\r\nthe scene was one of great interest, while all the indications\r\nseemed to point to success; but on the seventh of December, the\r\nproposition was voted down by yeas fifty-seven, nays one hundred\r\nand eight.  The vote was a great surprise and disappointment to\r\nthe friends of impeachment, and was construed by them as a wanton\r\nsurrender by Congress, and the prelude to new acts of executive\r\nlawlessness.  These acts continued to be multiplied, and the removal\r\nof Secretary Stanton finally so prepared the way that on the twenty-\r\nfourth of February, 1868, the House, by a vote of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six to forty-seven, declared in favor of impeachment.  The\r\ncrowds in the galleries, in the lobbies, and on the floor were\r\nunprecedented, and the excitement at high tide.  The fifty-seven\r\nwho had voted for impeachment in December, were now happy.  They\r\nfelt, at last, that the country was safe.  The whole land seemed\r\nto be electrified, as they believed it would have been at any\r\nprevious time if the House had had the nerve to go forward; and\r\nthey rejoiced that the madness of Johnson had at last compelled\r\nCongress to face the great duty.  A committee of seven was appointed\r\nby the Speaker to prepare articles of impeachment, of whom Thaddeus\r\nStevens was chairman.  He was now rapidly failling in strength, and\r\nevery morning had to be carried up stairs to his seat in the House;\r\nbut his humor never failed him, and on one of these occasions he\r\nsaid to the young men who had him in charge, \"I wonder, boys, who\r\nwill carry me when you are dead and gone.\"  He was very thin, pale\r\nand haggard.  His eye was bright, but his face was \"scarred by the\r\ncrooked autograph of pain.\"  He was a constant sufferer, and during\r\nthe session of the Committee kept himself stimulated by sipping a\r\nlittle wine or brandy; but he was its ruling spirit, and greatly\r\nspeeded its work by the clearness of his perceptions and the strength\r\nof his will.  His mental force seemed to defy the power of disease.\r\nThe articles of impeachment were ready for submission in a few\r\ndays, and adopted by the House, on the second of March, by a majority\r\nof considerably more than two thirds, when the case was transferred\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling against the President was now rapidly nearing\r\nits climax and becoming a sort of frenzy.  Andrew Johnson was no\r\nlonger merely a \"wrong-headed and obstinate man,\" but a \"genius in\r\ndepravity,\" whose hoarded malignity and passion were unfathomable.\r\nHe was not simply \"an irresolute mule,\" as General Schenck had\r\nstyled him, but was devil-bent upon the ruin of his country; and\r\nhis trial connected itself with all the memories of the war, and\r\ninvolved the Nation in a new and final struggle for its life.  Even\r\nso sober and unimaginative a man as Mr. Boutwell, one of the managers\r\nof the impeachment in the Senate, lost his wits and completely\r\nsurrendered himself to the passions of the hour in the following\r\npassage of his speech in that body:\r\n\r\n\"Travelers and astronomers inform us that in the Southern heavens,\r\nnear the Southern Cross, there is a vast space which the uneducated\r\ncall the 'hole in the sky,' where the eye of man, with the aid of\r\nthe powers of the telescope, has been unable to discover nebulae,\r\nor asteroid, or comet, or plant, or star or sun.  In that dreary,\r\ncold, dark region of space, which is only known to be less than\r\ninfinite by the evidences of creation elsewhere, the great Author\r\nof celestial mechanism has left the chaos which was in the beginning.\r\nIf this earth were capable of the sentiments and emotions of justice\r\nand virtue, which in human mortal beings are the evidences and the\r\npledge of our divine origin and immortal destiny, it would heave\r\nand throe with the energy of the elemental forces of nature, and\r\nproject this enemy of two races of men into that vast region, there\r\nforever to exist, in a solitude as eternal as life, or as the\r\nabsence of life, emblematical of, if not really, that 'outer\r\ndarkness' of which the Savior of man spoke in warning to those who\r\nare the enemies of themselves, of their race, and of their God.\"\r\n\r\nThis fearful discharge of rhetorical fireworks at the President\r\nfitly voiced the general sentiment of the Republicans.  Party\r\nmadness was in the air, and quite naturally gave birth to the \"hole\r\nin the sky\" in the agony of its effort to find expression.  No\r\nextravagance of speech or explosion of wrath was deemed out of\r\norder during this strange dispensation in our politics.\r\n\r\nThe trial proceeded with unabated interest, and on the afternoon\r\nof the eleventh of May the excitement reached its highest point.\r\nReports came from the Senate, then in secret session, that Grimes,\r\nFessenden and Henderson were certainly for acquittal, and that\r\nother senators were to follow them.  An indescribable gloom now\r\nprevailed among the friends of impeachment, which increased during\r\nthe afternoon, and at night when the Senate was again in session.\r\nAt the adjournment there was some hope of conviction, but it was\r\ngenerally considered very doubtful.  On meeting my old anti-slavery\r\nfriend, Dr. Brisbane, he told me he felt as if he were sitting up\r\nwith a sick friend who was expected to die.  His face was the\r\npicture of despair.  To such men it seemed that all the trials of\r\nthe war were merged in this grand issue, and that it involved the\r\nexistence of Free Government on this continent.  The final vote\r\nwas postponed till the sixteenth, owing to Senator Howard's illness,\r\nand on the morning of that day the friends of impeachment felt more\r\nconfident.  The vote was first taken on the eleventh article.  The\r\ngalleries were packed, and an indescribable anxiety was written on\r\nevery face.  Some of the members of the House near me grew pale\r\nand sick under the burden of suspense.  Such stillness prevailed\r\nthat the breathing in the galleries could be heard at the announcement\r\nof each senator's vote.  This was quite noticeable when any of the\r\ndoubtful senators voted, the people holding their breath as the\r\nwords \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" were pronounced, and then giving it\r\nsimultaneous vent.  Every heart throbbed more anxiously as the name\r\nof Senator Fowler was reached, and the Chief Justice propounded to\r\nhim the prescribed question:  \"How say you, is the respondent,\r\nAndrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty\r\nof a high misdemeanor, as charged in this article of impeachment?\"\r\nThe senator, in evident excitement, inadvertently answered \"guilty,\"\r\nand thus lent a momentary relief to the friends of impeachment;\r\nbut this was immediately dissipated by correcting his vote on the\r\nstatement of the Chief Justice that he did not understand the\r\nsenator's response to the question.  Nearly all hope of conviction\r\nfled when Senator Ross, of Kansas, voted \"not guilty,\" and a long\r\nbreathing of disappointment and despair followed the like vote of\r\nVan Winkle, which settled the case in favor of the President.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible now to realize how perfectly overmastering was\r\nthe excitement of these days.  The exercise of calm judgment was\r\nsimply out of the question.  As I have already stated, passion\r\nruled the hour, and constantly strengthened the tendency to one-\r\nsidedness and exaggeration.  The attempt to impeach the President\r\nwas undoubtedly inspired, mainly, by patriotic motives; but the\r\nspirit of intolerance among Republicans toward those who differed\r\nwith them in opinion set all moderation and common sense at defiance.\r\nPatriotism and party animosity were so inextricably mingled and\r\nconfounded that the real merits of the controversy could only be\r\nseen after the heat and turmoil of the strife had passed away.\r\nTime has made this manifest.  Andrew Johnson was not the Devil-\r\nincarnate he was then painted, nor did he monopolize, entirely,\r\nthe \"wrong-headedness\" of the times.  No one will now dispute that\r\nthe popular estimate of his character did him very great injustice.\r\nIt is equally certain that great injustice was done to Trumbull,\r\nFessenden, Grimes and other senators who voted to acquit the\r\nPresident, and gave proof of their honesty and independence by\r\nfacing the wrath and scorn of the party with which they had so long\r\nbeen identified.  The idea of making the question of impeachment\r\na matter of party discipline was utterly indefensible and preposterous.\r\n\"Those senators,\" as Horace Greeley declared, \"were sublimely in\r\nthe right who maintained their independent judgment--whether it\r\nwas correct or erroneous, in a matter of this kind, and who\r\nindignantly refused all attempts to swerve them from their duty as\r\nthey had undertaken to perform it by solemn oaths.\"  The Chief\r\nJustice was also cruelly and inexcusably wronged by imputing corrupt\r\nmotives to his official action.  His integrity and courage had been\r\namply demonstrated through many long years of thorough and severe\r\ntrial; and yet many of his Republican friends, both in the Senate\r\nand House, who had known him throughout his political career,\r\ndenounced him as an apostate and a traitor, and even denied him\r\nall social recognition.  Senator Howe, of Wisconsin, was especially\r\nabusive, and made himself perfectly ridiculous by the extravagance\r\nand malignity of his assaults.  The judicial spirit was everywhere\r\nwanting, and the elevation of Senator Wade to the Presidency in\r\nthe midst of so much passion and tumult, and with the peculiar\r\npolitical surroundings which the event foreshadowed, would have\r\nbeen, to say the least, a very questionable experiment for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe excitement attending the trial of the President soon subsided,\r\nbut the Republicans continued anxious about the state of the country.\r\nThe work of reconstruction was only fairly begun, and its completion\r\nwas involved in the approaching presidential election.  Chase and\r\nSeward had lost their standing in the party, and there was no longer\r\nany civilian in its ranks whose popularity was especially commanding\r\nor at all over-shadowing.  Under these circumstances it was quite\r\nnatural to turn to the army, and to canvass the claims of Gen.\r\nGrant.  The idea of his nomination was exceedingly distasteful to\r\nme.  I personally knew him to be intemperate.  In politics he was\r\na Democrat.  He did not profess to be a Republican, and the only\r\nvote he had ever given was cast for James Buchanan in 1856, when\r\nthe Republican party made its first grand struggle to rescue the\r\nGovernment from the clutches of slavery.  Moreover, he had had no\r\ntraining whatever in civil administration, and no one thought of\r\nhim as a statesman.  But the plea of his availability as a military\r\nchieftain was urged with great effect, and was made irresistible\r\nby the apprehension that if not nominated by the Republicans the\r\nDemocrats would appropriate him, and make him a formidable instrument\r\nof mischief.  His nomination, however, was only secured by cautious\r\nand timely diplomacy, and potent appeals to his sordidness, in the\r\nshape of assurances that he should have the office for a second\r\nterm.  But as the nominee of his party, fairly committed to its\r\nprinciples and measures touching the unsettled questions of\r\nreconstruction and suffrage, I saw no other practicable alternative\r\nthan to give him my support.  I was still further reconciled to\r\nthis by the action of the Democrats in the nomination of Seymour\r\nand Blair, and the avowal of the latter in his famous \"Brodhead\r\nletter,\" that \"we must have a President who will execute the will\r\nof the people by trampling in the dust the usurpations of Congress\r\nknown as the Reconstruction Acts.\"\r\n\r\nIn my new Congressional district I was unanimously re-nominated by\r\nthe Republicans, and entered at once upon the canvass, though\r\nscarcely well enough to leave my bed.  The issue was doubtful, and\r\nmy old-time enemies put forth their whole power against me at the\r\nelection.  They were determined, this time, to win, and to make\r\nsure of this they embarked in a desperate and shameless scheme of\r\nballot-stuffing in the city of Richmond, which was afterward fully\r\nexposed; but in spite of this enterprise of \"Ku Klux Republicans,\"\r\nI was elected by a small majority.  The result, however, foreshadowed\r\nthe close of my congressional labors, which followed two years\r\nlater, just as the XV Constitutional Amendment had made voters of\r\nthe colored men of the State; but it was only made possible by my\r\nfailing health, which had unfitted me for active leadership.  In\r\nmy old district I had made myself absolutely invincible.  For twenty-\r\none years in succession, that is to say, from the year 1848 to the\r\nyear 1868, both inclusive, I canvassed that district by townships\r\nand neighborhoods annually on the stump.  In the beginning, public\r\nopinion was overwhelmingly and fiercely against me, but I resolved,\r\nat whatever cost, to reconstruct it in conformity with my own\r\nearnest convictions.  I literally wore myself out in the work, and\r\nam perfectly amazed when I recall the amount of it I performed,\r\nand the complete abandon of myself to the task.  From the beginning\r\nto the end of this struggle the politicians of the district were\r\nagainst me, and they were numerous and formidable, and in every\r\ncontest were reinforced by the politicians of the State.  Although\r\nthe ranks of my supporters were constantly recruited and no man\r\never had more devoted friends, I was obliged, during all these\r\nyears, to stand alone as the champion of my cause in debate.  I\r\nbelieve no Congressional district in the Union was ever the theatre\r\nof so much hard toil by a single man; but although it involved the\r\nserious abridgement of health and life, the ruinous neglect of my\r\nprivate affairs, and the sacrifice of many precious friendships,\r\nI was not without my reward.  I succeeded in my work.  Step by step\r\nI saw my constituents march up to my position, and the district at\r\nlast completely disenthralled by the ceaseless and faithful\r\nadministration of anti-slavery truth.  The tables were completely\r\nturned.  Almost everybody was an Abolitionist, and nobody any longer\r\nmade a business of swearing that he was not.  In canvassing my\r\ndistrict it became the regular order of business for a caravan of\r\ncandidates for minor offices, who were sportively called the \"side\r\nshow,\" to follow me from point to point, all vying with each other\r\nas to which had served longest and most faithfully as my friends.\r\nThey had always been opposed to slavery, and men who had taken the\r\nlead in mobbing Abolitionists in earlier days and gained a livelihood\r\nby slave-catching, were now active and zealous leaders in the\r\nRepublican party.  It was a marvelous change.  Slavery itself,\r\ngreatly to the surprise and delight of its enemies, had perished;\r\nbut it was, after all, only one form of a world-wide evil.  The\r\nabolition of the chattel slavery of the Southern negro was simply\r\nthe introduction and prelude to the emancipation of all races from\r\nall forms of servitude, and my Congressional record had been a\r\npractical illustration of my faith in this truth.  The rights of\r\nman are sacred, whether trampled down by Southern slave-drivers,\r\nthe monopolists of the soil, the grinding power of corporate wealth,\r\nthe legalized robbery of a protective tariff, or the power of\r\nconcentrated capital in alliance with labor-saving machinery.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter preceding the inauguration of the President I\r\nwas besieged by place-hunters more than ever before.  They thronged\r\nabout me constantly, while I generally wrote from twenty to thirty\r\nletters per day in response to inquiries about appointments from\r\nmy district.  The squabbles over post-office appointments were by\r\nfar the most vexatious and unmanageable.  They were singularly\r\nfierce, and I found it wholly impossible to avoid making enemies\r\nof men who had supported me with zeal.  I was tormented for months\r\nabout the post-office of a single small town in Franklin county,\r\nwhere the rival parties pounced upon each other like cannibals,\r\nand divided the whole community into two hostile camps.  I was\r\nobliged to give my days and nights to this wretched business, and\r\noften received only curses for the sincerest endeavors to do what\r\nI believed was right.  The experience became absolutely sickening,\r\nand could not be otherwise than seriously damaging to me politically.\r\nSuch matters were wholly foreign to the business of legislation,\r\nand I wrote a very earnest letter to Mr. Jenckes, of Rhode Island,\r\nheartily commending his measure proposed in the preceding Congress\r\nfor the reform of our Civil Service, and for which, as the real\r\npioneer of this movement, he deserves a monument.\r\n\r\nIt was on the eighth of December, 1868, that I submitted a proposed\r\namendment to the Constitution, declaring that \"the right of suffrage\r\nin the United States shall be based upon citizenship, and shall be\r\nregulated by Congress\"; and that \"all citizens of the United States,\r\nwhether native or naturalized, shall enjoy this right equally,\r\nwithout any distinction or discrimination whatever founded on race,\r\ncolor, or sex.\"  This was prior to the ratification of the XV\r\nAmendment, and I so numbered the proposition; but on further\r\nreflection I preferred an amendment in the exact form of the\r\nfifteenth, and early in the next Congress I submitted it, being\r\nthe first proposition offered for a sixteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution.  My opinions about woman suffrage, however, date much\r\nfarther back.  The subject was first brought to my attention in a\r\nbrief chapter on the \"political non-existence of woman,\" in Miss\r\nMartineau's book on \"Society in America,\" which I read in 1847.\r\nShe there pithily states the substance of all that has since been\r\nsaid respecting the logic of woman's right to the ballot, and\r\nfinding myself unable to answer it, I accepted it.  On recently\r\nreferring to this chapter I find myself more impressed by its force\r\nthan when I first read it.  \"The most principled Democratic writers\r\non Government,\" she said, \"have on this subject sunk into fallacies\r\nas disgraceful as any advocate of despotism has adduced.  In fact,\r\nthey have thus sunk, from being, for the moment, advocates of\r\ndespotism.  Jefferson in America, and James Mill at home, subside,\r\nfor the occasion, to the level of the Emperor of Russia's catechism\r\nfor the young Poles.\"  This she makes unanswerably clear; but my\r\ninterest in the slavery question was awakened about the same time.\r\nI regarded it as the _previous_ question, and as less abstract and\r\nfar more immediately important and absorbing than that of suffrage\r\nfor woman.  For the sake of the negro I accepted Mr. Lincoln's\r\nphilosophy of \"one war at a time,\" though always ready to show my\r\nhand; but when this was fairly out of the way, I was prepared to\r\nenlist actively in the next grand movement in behalf of the sacredness\r\nand equality of human rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nGRANT AND GREELEY.\r\nThe new Cabinet--Seeds of party disaffection--Trip to California--\r\nParty degeneracy--The liberal Republican movement--Re-nomination\r\nof Grant--The Cincinnati convention--Perplexities of the situation\r\n--The canvass for Greeley--Its bitterness--Its peculiar features--\r\nThe defeat--The vindication of Liberals--Visit to Chase and Sumner\r\n--Death of Greeley.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural speech of Gen. Grant was a feeble performance, and\r\nvery unsatisfactory to his friends.  When he announced his Cabinet,\r\ndisappointment was universal among Republicans, and was greatly\r\nincreased when he asked Congress to relieve A. T. Stewart, his\r\nnominee for Secretary of the Treasury, from the disability wisely\r\nimposed by the Act of Congress of 1789, forbidding the appointment\r\nto that position of any one engaged \"in carrying on the business\r\nof trade or commerce.\"  Senator Sherman at once introduced a bill\r\nto repeal this enactment, but Mr. Sumner vigorously opposed the\r\nmeasure, and the President soon afterward sent a message to the\r\nSenate asking leave to withdraw his request as to Mr. Stewart.  It\r\nwas doubtless the prompt and decided stand taken by Mr. Sumner in\r\nthis matter which laid the foundation for the President's personal\r\nhostility to him, which so remarkably developed itself during the\r\nfollowing years.  The seeds of a party feud were thus planted, and\r\nas the Administration continued to show its hand, bore witness to\r\na vigorous growth.\r\n\r\nIn June of this year I made a trip to California in search of\r\nhealth, which I had lost through overwork, and was now paying the\r\npenalty in a very distressing form of insomnia.  I took one of the\r\nfirst through trains to the Pacific, and on reaching the State, I\r\nfound sight-seeing and travel so irresistible a temptation, that\r\nI lost the rest and quiet I so absolutely needed.  I was constantly\r\non the wing; and I encountered at every point, the \"settler,\" who\r\nwas anxious to talk over the land squabbles of the State, with\r\nwhich I had had much to do in Congress, but now needed for a season\r\nto forget.  I found that the half had not been told me respecting\r\nthe ravages of land-grabbing under the Swamp Land Act of 1850, and\r\nthe mal-administration of Mexican and Spanish grants.  I was full\r\nof the subject, and was obliged, also, to give particular attention\r\nto the pre-emption of J. M. Hutchings, in the Yosemite Valley, for\r\nthe protection of which I had reported a bill which was then pending;\r\nand I came near losing my life in the valley through the fatigue\r\nI suffered in reaching it.  After a stay of over two months in\r\nCalifornia, and a trip by steamer to Oregon and Washington Territory,\r\nI returned home early in September, but in no better health than\r\nwhen I left; and a like experience attended a journey to Minnesota\r\nsoon afterward, where I was captured by leading railroad men who\r\nbelabored me over the land-grant to the St. Croix and Bayfield\r\nrailroad, the revival of which I had aided in defeating at the\r\nprevious session of Congress.\r\n\r\nI returned to Washington in December, but physically unfit for\r\nlabor, spending most of the session in New York under the care of\r\na physician.  I deeply regretted this, for the railway lobby was\r\nin Washington in full force, as it was during the closing session\r\nof the Forty-first Congress, when I was equally unfit for business.\r\nI was not, however, without consolation.  Under the popular reaction\r\nagainst the Land-grant system which I had done my part to create,\r\nthe huge pile of land bills on the Speaker's table failed, save\r\nthe Texas Pacific project, which was carried by the most questionable\r\nmethods, and against such a general protest as clearly indicated\r\nthe end of this policy.  A vote of nearly two to one was carried\r\nin the House in favor of a bill reported by the Land Committee\r\ndefining swamp and overflowed lands, and guarding against the\r\nenormous swindles that had disgraced the Land Department and\r\nafflicted honest settlers.  A like vote was secured in favor of\r\nthe bill to prevent the further disposition of the public lands\r\nsave under the pre-emption and homestead laws, for which I had\r\nlabored for years.  Many thousands of acres had been saved from\r\nthe clutches of monopolists by attaching to several important grants\r\nthe condition that the lands should be sold only to actual settlers,\r\nin quantities not exceeding a quarter section, and for not more\r\nthan two dollars and fifty cents per acre.  A very important reform,\r\nalready referred to, had been made in our Indian treaty policy, by\r\nwhich lands relinquished by any tribe would henceforth fall under\r\nthe operation of our land laws, instead of being sold in a body to\r\nsome corporation or individual monopolist.  The Southern Homestead\r\nlaw had dedicated to actual settlement millions of acres of the\r\npublic domain in the land States of the South, while the Homestead\r\nAct of 1862 was splendidly vindicating the wisdom of its policy.\r\nCongress had declared forfeited and open to settlement a large\r\ngrant of lands in Louisiana for non-compliance with the conditions\r\non which it was made, and the public domain had been saved from\r\nfrightful spoilation by the fortunate defeat of a scheme of land\r\nbounties that would completely have overturned the policy of the\r\npre-emption and homestead laws, while practically mocking the claims\r\nof the soldiers.  The opportunity, now and then, to strangle a\r\nlegislative monster like this, or to further the passage of beneficent\r\nand far-reaching measures, is one of the real compensations of\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nThe final ratification of the Fifteenth Constitutional Amendment,\r\nwhich was declared in force on the thirtieth of March, 1870,\r\nperfectly consummated the mission of the Republican party, and left\r\nits members untrammeled in dealing with new questions.  In fact,\r\nthe Republican movement in the beginning was a political combination,\r\nrather than a party.  Its action was inspired less by a creed than\r\nan object, and that object was to dedicate our National Territories\r\nto freedom, and denationalize slavery.  Aside from this object,\r\nthe members of the combination were hopelessly divided.  The\r\norganization was created to deal with this single question, and\r\nwould not have existed without it.  It was now regarded by many as\r\na spent political force, although it had received a momentum which\r\nthreatened to outlast its mission; and if it did not keep the\r\npromise made in its platform of 1868, to reform the corruptions of\r\nthe preceding Administration, and at the same time manfully wrestle\r\nwith the new problems of the time, it was morally certain to\r\ndegenerate into a faction, led by base men, and held together by\r\nartful appeals to the memories of the past.  Our tariff legislation\r\ncalled for a thorough revision.  Our Civil Service was becoming a\r\nsystem of political prostitution.  Roguery and plunder, born of\r\nthe multiplied temptations which the war furnished, had stealthily\r\ncrept into the management of public affairs, and claimed immunity\r\nfrom the right of search.  What the country needed was not a stricter\r\nenforcement of party discipline, not military methods and the\r\nfostering of sectional hate, but oblivion of the past, and an\r\nearnest, intelligent, and catholic endeavor to grapple with the\r\nquestions of practical administration.\r\n\r\nBut this, in the very nature of the case, was not to be expected.\r\nThe men who agreed to stand together in 1856, on a question which\r\nwas now out of the way, and had postponed their differences on\r\ncurrent party questions for that purpose, were comparatively unfitted\r\nfor the task of civil administration in a time of peace.  They had\r\nhad no preparatory training, and the engrossing struggle through\r\nwhich they had passed had, in fact, disqualified them for the work.\r\nWhile the issues of the war were retreating into the past the\r\nmercenary element of Republicanism had gradually secured the\r\nascendancy, and completely appropriated the President.  The mischiefs\r\nof war had crept into the conduct of civil affairs, and a thorough\r\nschooling of the party in the use of power had familiarized it with\r\nmilitary ideas and habits, and committed it to loose and indefensible\r\nopinions respecting the powers of the General Government.  The\r\nmanagement of the Civil Service was an utter mockery of political\r\ndecency, while the animosities engendered by the war were nursed\r\nand coddled as the appointed means of uniting the party and covering\r\nup its misdeeds.  The demand for reform, as often as made, was\r\ninstantly rebuked, and the men who uttered it branded as enemies\r\nof the party and sympathizers with treason.  It is needless to go\r\ninto details; but such was the drift of general demoralization that\r\nthe chief founders and pre-eminent representatives of the party,\r\nChase, Seward, Sumner and Greeley were obliged to desert it more\r\nthan a year before the end of Gen. Grant's first administration,\r\nas the only means of maintaining their honor and self-respect.  My\r\nCongressional term expired a little after Grant and Babcock had\r\ninaugurated the San Domingo project, and Sumner had been degraded\r\nfrom the Chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to make\r\nroom for Simon Cameron.  The \"irrepressible conflict\" had just\r\nbegun to develop itself between the element of honesty and reform\r\nin the party, and the corrupt leadership which sought to make\r\nmerchandise of its good name, and hide its sins under the mantle\r\nof its past achievements.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the Forty-first Congress in March, 1871,\r\nI visited New York, where I called on Greeley.  We took a drive\r\ntogether, and spent the evening at the house of a mutual friend,\r\nwhere we had a free political talk.  He denounced the Administration\r\nand the San Domingo project in a style which commanded my decided\r\napproval, for my original dislike of Grant had been ripening into\r\ndisgust and contempt, and, like Greeley, I had fully made up my\r\nmind that under no circumstance could I ever again give him my\r\nsupport.  After my return home I wrote several articles for the\r\nPress in favor of a \"new departure\" in the principles of the party.\r\nMr. Vallandigham had just given currency to this phrase by employing\r\nit to designate his proposed policy of Democratic acquiescence in\r\nthe XIV and XV Constitutional Amendments, which was seconded by\r\nthe \"Missouri Republican,\" and accepted by the party the following\r\nyear.  The \"new departure\" I commended to my own party was equally\r\nthorough, proposing the radical reform of its Tariff and Land\r\nPolicy, and its emancipation from the rule of great corporations\r\nand monopolies; a thorough reform of its Civil Service, beginning\r\nwith a declaration in favor of the \"one-term principle,\" and\r\ncondemning the action of the President in employing the whole power\r\nand patronage of his high office in securing his re-election for\r\na second term by hurling from office honest, capable and faithful\r\nmen, simply to make places for scalawags and thieves; and the\r\nunqualified repudiation of his conduct in heaping honors and\r\nemoluments upon his poor kin, while accepting presents of fine\r\nhouses and other tempting gifts from unworthy men, who were paid\r\noff in fat places.  I did not favor the disbanding of the party,\r\nor ask that it should make war on Gen. Grant, but earnestly protested\r\nagainst the policy that sought to Tammany-ize the organization\r\nthrough his re-nomination.\r\n\r\nReturning to Washington on the meeting of Congress in December, I\r\nconferred with Trumbull, Schurz and Sumner, respecting the situation,\r\nand the duty of Republicans in facing the party crisis which was\r\nevidently approaching.  During the session, I listened to the great\r\ndebate in the Senate on Sumner's resolution of inquiry as to the\r\nsale of arms to the French, and was delighted with the replies of\r\nSchurz and Sumner to Conkling and Morton.  My dislike of the\r\nPresident steadily increased, and his disgraceful conduct towards\r\nSumner and alliance with Morton, Conkling, Cameron, and their\r\nassociates rendered it morally impossible for me any longer to\r\nfight under his banner.  The situation became painfully embarrassing,\r\nsince every indication seemed to point to his re-nomination as a\r\nforegone conclusion.  But I clung to the hope that events would in\r\nsome way order it otherwise.  In February, I was strongly urged to\r\nbecome a candidate for Congressman at large under the new Congressional\r\napportionment; and although failing health unfitted me for active\r\npolitics, to which I had no wish to return, I really wanted the\r\ncompliment of the nomination.  The long-continued and wanton\r\nopposition which had been waged against me in my own party led me\r\nto covet it, and in the hope that General Grant's nomination might\r\nyet be averted I allowed my friends to urge my claims, and to\r\nbelieve I would accept the honor if tendered, which I meant to do\r\nshould this hope be realized.  I saw that I could secure it.  My\r\nstanding in my own party was better than ever before.  The\r\n\"Indianapolis Journal,\" for the first time, espoused my cause,\r\nalong with other leading Republican papers in different sections\r\nof the State.  The impolicy and injustice of the warfare which had\r\nlong been carried on against me in Indiana were so generally felt\r\nby all fair-minded Republicans that Senator Morton himself, though\r\npersonally quite as hostile as ever, was constrained to call off\r\nhis forces, and favor a policy of conciliation.  It was evident\r\nthat my nomination was assured if I remained in the field; but as\r\ntime wore on I saw that the re-nomination of General Grant had\r\nbecome absolutely inevitable; and, as I could not support him I\r\ncould not honorably accept a position which would commit me in his\r\nfavor.  The convention was held on the 22d of February, and on the\r\nday before I sent a telegram peremptorily refusing to stand as a\r\ncandidate; and I soon afterward formally committed myself to the\r\nLiberal Republican movement.  I could not aid in the re-election\r\nof Grant without sinning against decency and my own self-respect.\r\nI deplored the fact, but there was no other alternative.  If it\r\nhad been morally possible, I would have supported him gladly.  I\r\nhad no personal grievances to complain of, and most sincerely\r\nregretted the necessity which compelled my withdrawal from political\r\nassociations in which I had labored many long years, and through\r\nseasons of great national danger.  If I had consulted my own selfish\r\nambition I would have chosen a different course, since I knew by\r\npainful experience the cost of party desertion, while the fact was\r\nwell known that the prizes of politics were within my reach, if I\r\nhad sought them through the machinery of the Republican organization\r\nand the support of General Grant.  Had the party, having accomplished\r\nthe work which called it into being, applied itself to the living\r\nquestions of the times, and resolutely set its face against political\r\ncorruption and plunder, and had it freely tolerated honest differences\r\nof opinion in its own ranks, treating the question of Grant's re-\r\nnomination as an open one, instead of making it a test of Republicanism\r\nand a cause for political excommunication, I could have avoided a\r\nseparation, at least at that time.  I made it with many keen pangs\r\nof regret, for the history of the party had been honorable and\r\nglorious, and I had shared in its achievements.  My revolt against\r\nits discipline forcibly reminded me of the year 1848, and was by\r\nfar the severest political trial of my life.  My new position not\r\nonly placed me in very strange relations to the Democrats, whose\r\nmisdeeds I had so earnestly denounced for years; but I could not\r\nfail to see that the great body of my old friends would now become\r\nmy unrelenting foes.  Their party intolerance would know no bounds,\r\nand I was not unmindful of its power; but there was no way of\r\nescape, and with a sad heart, but an unflinching purpose, I resolved\r\nto face the consequences of my decision.  My chief regret was that\r\nimpaired health deprived me of the strength and endurance I would\r\nnow sorely need in repelling wanton and very provoking assaults.\r\n\r\nI attended the Liberal Republican Convention at Cincinnati on the\r\nfirst of May, where I was delighted to meet troops of the old Free\r\nSoilers of 1848 and 1852.  It was a mass convention of Republicans,\r\nsuddenly called together without the power of money or the help of\r\nparty machinery, and prompted by a burning desire to rebuke the\r\nscandals of Gen. Grant's administration, and rescue both the party\r\nand the country from political corruption and misrule.  It was a\r\nspontaneous and independent movement, and its success necessarily\r\ndepended upon the wisdom of its action and not the force of party\r\nobligation.  There were doubtless political schemers and mercenaries\r\nin attendance, but the rank and file were unquestionably conscientious\r\nand patriotic, and profoundly in earnest.  I never saw a finer\r\nlooking body assembled.  It was a more formidable popular demonstration\r\nthan the famous Convention at Buffalo, in 1848, and gave promise\r\nof more immediate and decisive results.  There was a very widespread\r\nfeeling that the Cincinnati ticket would win, and the friends of\r\nGen. Grant could not disguise their apprehension.  The thought\r\nseemed to inspire every one that a way was now fortunately opened\r\nfor hastening the end of sectional strife and purifying the\r\nadministration of public affairs.  The capital speech of Stanley\r\nMatthews, on accepting the temporary chairmanship of the Convention,\r\nwas but the echo of the feeling of the Convention, and its confident\r\nprophecy of victory.  \"Parties,\" said he, \"can not live on their\r\nreputations.  It was remarked, I believe, by Sir Walter Raleigh,\r\nin reference to the strife of ancestry, that those who boasted most\r\nof their progenitors were like the plant he had discovered in\r\nAmerica, the best part was under ground.\"  He declared that \"the\r\ntime has come when it is the voice of an exceedingly large and\r\ninfluential portion of the American people that they will no longer\r\nbe dogs to wear the collar of a party.\"  All that now seemed wanting\r\nwas wise leadership, and a fair expression of the real wish and\r\npurpose of the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe principal candidates were Charles Francis Adams, Horace Greeley,\r\nLyman Trumbull, David Davis, and B. Gratz Brown.  Mr. Chase still\r\nhad a lingering form of the Presidential fever, and his particular\r\nfriends were lying in wait for a timely opportunity to bring him\r\nforward; but his claims were not seriously considered.  The friends\r\nof Judge Davis did him much damage by furnishing transportation\r\nand supplies for large Western delegations, who very noisily pressed\r\nhis claims in the Convention.  With prudent leadership his chances\r\nfor the nomination would have been good, and he would have been a\r\nvery formidable candidate; but he was \"smothered by his friends.\"\r\nThe really formidable candidates were Adams and Greeley, and during\r\nthe first and second days the chances were decidedly in favor of\r\nthe former.  On the evening of the second day Mr. Brown and Gen.\r\nBlair arrived in the city, pretending that they had come for the\r\npurpose of arranging a trouble in the Missouri delegation; but\r\ntheir real purpose was to throw the strength of Brown, who was\r\nfound to have no chance for the first place, in favor of Greeley,\r\nwho had said some very flattering words of Brown some time before\r\nin a letter published in a Missouri newspaper.  This new movement\r\nfurther included the nomination of Brown for the second place on\r\nthe ticket, and was largely aimed at Carl Schurz, who was an Adams\r\nman, and had refused, though personally very friendly to Brown, to\r\nback his claims for the Presidential nomination.  It seemed to be\r\na lucky hit for Greeley, who secured the nomination; but the real\r\ncause of Mr. Adams' defeat, after all, was the folly of Trumbull's\r\nfriends, who preferred Adams to Greeley, in holding on to their\r\nman in the vain hope of his nomination.  They could have nominated\r\nAdams on the fourth or fifth ballot, if they had given him their\r\nvotes, as they saw when it was too late.  Greeley regretted Brown's\r\nnomination, and afterward expressed his preference for another\r\ngentleman from the West; and he had, of course, nothing to do with\r\nthe movement which placed him on the ticket.\r\n\r\nI was woefully disappointed in the work of the Convention, having\r\nlittle faith in the success of Greeley, and being entirely confident\r\nthat Adams could be elected if nominated.  I still think he would\r\nhave been, and that the work of reform would thus have been thoroughly\r\ninaugurated, and the whole current of American politics radically\r\nchanged.  The time was ripe for it.  His defeat was a wet blanket\r\nupon many of the leading spirits of the Convention and their\r\nfollowers.  The disappointment of some of these was unspeakably\r\nbitter and agonizing.  Stanley Matthews, illustrating his proverbial\r\ninstability in politics, and forgetting his brave resolve no longer\r\n\"to wear the collar of a party,\" abruptly deserted to the enemy.\r\nThe \"New York Nation\" also suddenly changed front, giving its feeble\r\nsupport to General Grant, and its malignant hostility to Greeley.\r\nThe leading Free Traders in the Convention who had enlisted zealously\r\nfor Adams became indifferent or hostile.  Many of the best informed\r\nof the Liberal leaders felt that a magnificent opportunity to launch\r\nthe work of reform and crown it with success had been madly thrown\r\naway.  With the zealous friends of Mr. Adams it was a season of\r\ninfinite vexation; but for me there was no backward step.  The\r\nnewborn movement had blundered, but Republicanism under the lead\r\nof Grant remained as odious as ever.  It was still the duty of its\r\nenemies to oppose it, and no other method of doing this was left\r\nthem than through the organization just formed.  That a movement\r\nso suddenly extemporized should make mistakes was by no means\r\nsurprising, while there was a fairly implied obligation on the part\r\nof those who had joined in its organization to abide by its action,\r\nif not wantonly recreant to the principles that had inspired it.\r\nThe hearts of the liberal masses were for Greeley, and if he could\r\nnot be elected, which was by no means certain, his supporters could\r\nat least make their organized protest against the mal-administration\r\nof the party in power.\r\n\r\nI attended the Democratic State Convention of Indiana on the twelfth\r\nof June, which was one of the largest and most enthusiastic ever\r\nheld in the State.  The masses seemed to have completely broken\r\naway from their old moorings, and to be rejoicing in their escape,\r\nwhile their leaders, many of them reluctantly, accepted the situation.\r\nBoth were surprisingly friendly to me, and their purpose was to\r\nnominate me as one of the candidates for Congressman-at-large, which\r\nthey would have done by acclamation if I had consented.  I was much\r\ncheered by such tokens of union and fraternity in facing the common\r\nenemy.  The State campaign was finely opened at Indianapolis on\r\nthe eleventh of July, where I presented the issues of the canvass\r\nfrom the Liberal standpoint; and I continued almost constantly on\r\nthe stump till the State election in October, having splendid\r\naudiences, and gathering strength and inspiration from the prevailing\r\nenthusiasm of the canvass.  The meetings toward the close were real\r\novations, strikingly reminding me of the campaign of 1856.  Up to\r\nthe time of the North Carolina election I had strong hopes of\r\nvictory; but owing to the alarm which had seized the Grant men on\r\naccount of Greeley's unexpected popularity, and the lavish expenditure\r\nof their money which followed, the tide was turned, and was never\r\nafterward checked in its course.  They became unspeakably bitter\r\nand venomous, and I never before encountered such torrents of abuse\r\nand defamation, outstripping, as it seemed to me, even the rabidness\r\nwhich confronted the Abolitionists in their early experience.  At\r\none of my appointments a number of colored men came armed with\r\nrevolvers, and breathing the spirit of war which Senator Morton\r\nwas doing his utmost to kindle.  He had been telling the people\r\neverywhere that Greeley and his followers were all Rebels, seeking\r\nto undo the work of the war, to re-enslave the negro, and saddle\r\nupon the country the rebel debt; and these colored men, heeding\r\nhis logic, thought that killing Rebels now was as proper a business\r\nas during the war, and would probably have begun their work of\r\nmurder if they had not been restrained by the more prudent counsel\r\nof their white brethren.  Even in one of the old towns in Eastern\r\nIndiana which had been long known as the headquarters of Abolitionism,\r\na large supply of eggs was provided for my entertainment when I\r\nwent there to speak for Greeley; and they were not thrown at me\r\nsimply because the fear of a reaction against the party would be\r\nthe result.  The Democrats in this canvass were rather handsomely\r\ntreated; but the fierceness and fury of the Grant men toward the\r\nLiberal Republicans were unrelieved by a single element of honor\r\nor fair play.\r\n\r\nThis was pre-eminently true in Indiana, and especially so as to\r\nmyself.  The leaders of Grant, borrowing the spirit of the campaign,\r\nset all the canons of decency at defiance.  \"Sore head,\" \"Renegade,\"\r\n\"Apostate,\" \"Rebel,\" and \"deadbeat,\" were the compliments constantly\r\nlavished.  Garbled extracts from my old war speeches were plentifully\r\nscattered over the State, as if we had been still in the midst of\r\nthe bloody conflict, and I had suddenly betrayed the country to\r\nits enemies.  Garbled and forged letters were peddled and paraded\r\nover the State by windy political blatherskites, who were hired to\r\npropagate the calumnies of their employers.  In fact, my previous\r\npolitical experience supplied no precedent for this warfare of my\r\nformer Republican friends.  But I was not unprepared for it, and\r\nfully availed myself of the right of self-defense and counter\r\nattack.  I would not make myself a blackguard, but I met my assailants\r\nin every encounter with the weapons of argument and invective, and\r\nstretched them on the rack of my ridicule; while their prolonged\r\nhowl bore witness to the effectiveness of my work.  My whole heart\r\nwas in it.  The fervor and enthusiasm of earlier years came back\r\nto me, and a kindred courage and faith armed me with the strength\r\nwhich the work of the canvass demanded.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of the canvass was indeed remarkable in all respects.\r\nThe Liberal Republicans had not changed any of their political\r\nopinions, nor deserted any principle they had ever espoused, touching\r\nthe questions of slavery and the war; and yet they were now in the\r\nfiercest antagonism with the men who had been politically associated\r\nwith them ever since the organization of the party, and who had\r\ntrusted and honored them through all the struggles of the past.\r\nThey were branded as \"Apostates\" from their anti-slavery faith;\r\nbut slavery had perished forever, and every man of them would have\r\nbeen found fighting it as before, if it had been practicable to\r\ncall it back to life; while many of their assailants had distinguished\r\nthemselves by mobbing Abolitionism in the day of its weakness.\r\nHow could men apostatize from a cause which they had served with\r\nunflinching fidelity until it was completely triumphant?  And how\r\nwas it possible to fall from political grace by withdrawing from\r\nthe fellowship of the knaves and traders that formed the body-guard\r\nof the President, and were using the Republican party as the\r\ninstrument of wholesale schemes of jobbery and pelf?  To charge\r\nthe Liberal Republicans with apostasy because they had the moral\r\ncourage to disown and denounce these men was to invent a definition\r\nof the term which would have made all the great apostates of history\r\n\"honorable men.\"\r\n\r\nThey were called \"Rebels\"; but the war had been over seven years\r\nand a half, and if the clock of our politics could have been set\r\nback and the bloody conflict re-instated, every Liberal would have\r\nbeen shouting, as before, for its vigorous prosecution.  No man\r\ndoubted this who was capable of taking care of himself without the\r\nhelp of a guardian.\r\n\r\nIt was charged that \"they changed sides\" in politics; but the sides\r\nthemselves had been changed by events, and the substitution of new\r\nissues for the old, and nobody could deny this who was not besotted\r\nby party devil-worship or the density of his political ignorance.\r\n\r\nThey were called \"sore-heads\" and \"disappointed place-hunters;\"\r\nbut the Liberal leaders, in rebelling against their party in the\r\nnoon-day of its power, and when honors were within their grasp,\r\nwere obliged to \"put away ambition\" and taste political death, and\r\nthus courageously illustrate the truth that \"the duties of life\r\nare more than life.\"  The charge was as glaringly stupid as it was\r\nflagrantly false.\r\n\r\nBut the novelty of this canvass was equally manifest in the political\r\nfellowships it necessitated.  While facing the savage warfare of\r\ntheir former friends Liberal Republicans were suddenly brought into\r\nthe most friendly and intimate relations with the men whose recreancy\r\nto humanity they had unsparingly denounced for years.  They were\r\nnow working with these men because the subjects on which they had\r\nbeen divided were withdrawn, and the country had entered upon a\r\nnew dispensation.  The mollifying influence of peace, aided, no\r\ndoubt, by the organized roguery which in the name of Republicanism\r\nheld the Nation by the throat, unveiled to Liberals a new political\r\nhorizon, and they gladly exchanged the key-note of hate and war\r\nfor that of fraternity and reunion.  They saw that the spirit of\r\nwrath which had so moved the Northern States during the conflict\r\nwas no longer in order.  The more they pondered the policy of\r\namnesty and followed up the work of the canvass the more thoroughly\r\nthey became reconstructed in heart.  They discovered that the men\r\nwhom they had been denouncing with such hot indignation for so many\r\nyears were, after all, very much like other people.  Personally\r\nand socially they seemed quite as kindly and as estimable as the\r\nmen on the other side, while very many of them had undoubtedly\r\nespoused the cause of slavery under a mistaken view of their\r\nconstitutional obligations, and as a phase of patriotism, while\r\nsincerely condemning it on principle.  Besides, Democrats had done\r\na very large and indispensable work in the war for the Union, and\r\nthey now stood upon common ground with the Republicans touching\r\nthe questions on which they had differed.  On these questions the\r\nparty platforms were identical.  If their position was accepted as\r\na necessity and not from choice, they were only a little behind\r\nthe Republicans, who, as a party, only espoused the cause of the\r\nnegro under the whip and spur of military necessity, and not the\r\npromptings of humanity.  In the light of such considerations it\r\nwas not strange that the Greeley men gladly accepted their deliverance\r\nfrom the glamour which was blinding the eyes of their old associates\r\nto the policy of reconciliation and peace, and blocking up the\r\npathway of greatly needed reforms.\r\n\r\nSoon after the State election I resumed my work on the stump, which\r\nincluded a series of appointment in Kansas, where I addressed by\r\nfar the most enthusiastic meetings of the campaign.  My welcome to\r\nthe State was made singularly cordial by the part I had played in\r\nCongress in opposing enormous schemes of land monopoly and plunder,\r\nwhich had been concocted by some of her own public servants in the\r\ninterest of railway corporations and Indian rings.  On my return\r\nto Indiana the signs of defeat in November became alarming, and\r\nthey were justified by the result.  It was overwhelming and stunning.\r\nDemocrats and Liberals were completely dismayed and bewildered.\r\nThe cause of Mr. Greeley's defeat, speaking generally, was the\r\nperfectly unscrupulous and desperate hostility of the party for\r\nwhich he had done more than any other man, living or dead; but the\r\ndisaster resulted, more immediately, from the stupid and criminal\r\ndefection of the Bourbon element in the Democratic party, which\r\ncould not be rallied under the banner of an old anti-slavery chief.\r\nThousands of this class, who sincerely hated Abolitionism, and\r\nloved negro slavery more than they loved their country, voted\r\ndirectly for Grant, while still greater numbers declined to vote\r\nat all.  Mr. Greeley's own explanation of the result, which he gave\r\nto a friend soon after the election, was as follows:  \"I was an\r\nAbolitionist for years, when it was as much as one's life was worth\r\neven here in New York, to be an Abolitionist; and the negroes have\r\nall voted against me.  Whatever of talents and energy I have\r\npossessed I have freely contributed all my life long to Protection;\r\nto the cause of our manufactures.  And the manufacturers have\r\nexpended millions to defeat me.  I even made myself ridiculous in\r\nthe opinion of many whose good wishes I desired by showing fair\r\nplay and giving a fair field in the 'Tribune' to Woman's Rights;\r\nand the women have all gone against me!\"\r\n\r\nGreeley, however, received nearly three million votes, being\r\nconsiderably more than Governor Seymour had received four years\r\nbefore; but General Grant, who had been unanimously nominated by\r\nhis party, was elected by two hundred and eighty-six electoral\r\nvotes, and a popular majority of nearly three quarters of a million,\r\ncarrying thirty-one of the thirty-seven States.  To the sincere\r\nfriends of political reform the situation seemed hopeless.  The\r\nPresident was re-crowned our King, and political corruption had\r\nnow received so emphatic a premium that honesty was tempted to give\r\nup the struggle in despair.  His champions were already talking\r\nabout a \"third term,\" while the Republican party had become the\r\nrepresentative and champion of great corporations, and the instrument\r\nof organized political corruption and theft.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this fight of Liberals and Democrats was not in vain.  They\r\nplanted the seed which ripened into a great popular victory four\r\nyears later, while the policy of reconciliation for which they\r\nbattled against overwhelming odds was hastened by their labors,\r\nand has been finally accepted by the country.  They were still\r\nfurther and more completely vindicated by the misdeeds of the party\r\nthey had sought to defeat.  The spectacle of our public affairs\r\nbecame so revolting that before the middle of General Grant's second\r\nterm all the great Republican States in the North were lost to the\r\nparty, while leading Republicans began to agitate the question of\r\nremanding the States of the South to territorial rule, on account\r\nof their disordered condition.  At the end of this term the Republican\r\nmajority in the Senate had dwindled from fifty-four to seventeen,\r\nwhile in the House the majority of one hundred and four had been\r\nwiped out to give place to a Democratic majority of seventy-seven.\r\nNo vindication of the maligned Liberals of 1872 could have been\r\nmore complete, while it summoned to the bar of history the party\r\nwhose action had thus brought shame upon the Nation and a stain\r\nupon Republican institutions.\r\n\r\nAfter the presidential election I went to Washington, where I met\r\nChief Justice Chase in the Supreme Court and accepted an invitation\r\nto dine with him.  He looked so wasted and prematurely old that I\r\nscarcely knew him.  He was very genial, however, and our long\r\npolitical talk was exceedingly enjoyable.  It seemed to afford him\r\nmuch satisfaction to show me a recently reported dissenting opinion\r\nof his in which he re-asserted his favorite principle of State\r\nrights.  I only met him once afterward, and this was at the\r\ninauguration of General Grant.  I called on Mr. Sumner the same\r\nevening, and found him in a wretched state of health, which was\r\naggravated by the free use of poisonous drugs.  He seemed very much\r\ndepressed, politically.  He had lost caste with the great party\r\nthat had so long idolized him, and which he had done so much to\r\ncreate and inspire.  He had been deserted by the colored race, to\r\nwhose service he had unselfishly dedicated his life.  He had been\r\ndegraded from his honored place at the head of the Senate Committee\r\non Foreign Relations, and for no other reason than the faithful\r\nand conscientious performance of his public duty.  He had been\r\nrebuked by the Legislature of his own State.  His case strikingly\r\nsuggested that of John Quincy Adams in 1807, when the anathemas of\r\nMassachusetts were showered upon him for leaving the Federalist\r\nparty when it had accomplished its mission and survived its character,\r\nand joining the supporters of Jefferson.  I sympathized with him\r\nprofoundly; but his case was not so infinitely sad as that of poor\r\nGreeley, over whose death, however, the whole Nation seemed to be\r\nin mourning.  He had greatly overtaxed himself in his masterly and\r\nbrilliant campaign on the stump, in which he displayed unrivaled\r\nintellectual resources and versatility.  He had exhausted himself\r\nin watching by the bedside of his dying wife.  He had been assailed\r\nas the enemy of his country by the party which he had done more\r\nthan any man in the Nation to organize.  He had been hunted to his\r\ngrave by political assassins whose calumnies broke his heart.  He\r\nwas scarcely less a martyr than Lincoln, or less honored after his\r\ndeath, and his graceless defamers now seemed to think they could\r\natone for their crime by singing his praises.  It is easy to speak\r\nwell of the dead.  It is very easy, even for base and recreant\r\ncharacters, to laud a man's virtues after he has gone to his grave\r\nand can no longer stand in their path.  It is far easier to praise\r\nthe dead than do justice to the living; and it was not strange,\r\ntherefore, that eminent clergymen and doctors of divinity who had\r\nsilently witnessed the peltings of Mr. Greeley by demagogues and\r\nmercenaries during the canvass now poured out their eloquence at\r\nhis grave.  What he had sorely needed and was religiously entitled\r\nto was the sympathy and succor of good men while he lived, and\r\nespecially in his heroic struggle for political reconciliation and\r\nreform.  The circumstances of his death made it peculiarly touching\r\nand sacramental, and I was inexpressibly glad that I had fought\r\nhis battle so unflinchingly, and defended him everywhere against\r\nhis conscienceless assailants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nCONCLUDING NOTES.\r\nParty changes caused by the slavery issue--Notable men in Congress\r\nduring the war--Sketches of prominent men in the Senate and House\r\n--Scenes and incidents--Butler and Bingham--Cox and Butler--Judge\r\nKelley and Van Wyck--Lovejoy and Wickliffe--Washburne and Donnelly\r\n--Oakes Ames--Abolitionism in Washington early in the war--Life at\r\nthe capital--The new dispensation and its problems.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the period covered by the preceding chapters\r\nour political parties were divided on mere questions of policy and\r\nmethods of administration.  Trade, Currency, Internal Improvements,\r\nand the Public Lands were the absorbing issues, while both parties\r\ntook their stand against the humanitarian movement which subsequently\r\nput those issues completely in abeyance, and compelled the country\r\nto face a question involving not merely the policy of governing,\r\nbut the existence of the Government itself.  When the slavery\r\nquestion finally forced its way into recognition it naturally\r\nbrought to the front a new class of public men, and their numbers,\r\nas I have shown, steadily increased in each Congress from the year\r\n1845 till the outbreak of the Rebellion in 1861.  The Congress\r\nwhich came into power with Mr. Lincoln did not fully represent the\r\nanti-slavery spirit of the Northern States, but it was a decided\r\nimprovement upon its predecessors.  In the Senate were such men as\r\nCollamer, Fessenden, Doolittle, Baker, Browning, Anthony, Grimes,\r\nHale, Harlan, Sherman, Trumbull, Sumner, Wade, Henry Wilson,\r\nChandler, Lane of Indiana, Harris of New York, Andrew Johnson, B.\r\nGratz Brown and Howard.  In the House were Conkling, Bingham,\r\nColfax, Dawes, Grow, Hickman, Kelley, Potter, Lovejoy, Pike of\r\nMaine, Ashley, Rollins of Missouri, Shellabarger, Thaddeus Stevens,\r\nElihu B. Washburne, Isaac N. Arnold and James F. Wilson.\r\n\r\nDuring the Rebellion and the years immediately following, Ferry of\r\nConnecticut, Creswell, Edmonds, Conkling, Morgan, Morton, Yates,\r\nCarpenter, Hamlin, Henderson, Morrill of Maine, and Schurz, were\r\nadded to the prominent men of the Senate and Boutwell, Blair, Henry\r\nWinter Davis, Deming, Jenckes, Garfield, Schenck, Banks, Orth,\r\nRaymond, Butler, Hoar, McCrary, to the list in the House.  During\r\nthis period the Democrats had in the Senate such men as Bayard,\r\nGarrett Davis, Hicks, Saulsbury, Buckalew, Hendricks, Bright, Reverdy\r\nJohnson, Thurman, and F. P. Blair; and in the House, S. S. Cox,\r\nCrittenden, Holman, Kerr, Pendleton, Richardson, Vallandigham,\r\nNiblack, Voorhees, Brooks, Randall, and Woodward.  The men who\r\ncontrolled Congress during these years of trial were not the\r\nintellectual equals of the famous leaders who figured in the great\r\ncrisis of 1850, but they were a different and generally a better\r\ntype.  They were summoned to the public service to deal with\r\ntremendous problems, and lifted up and ennobled by the great cause\r\nthey were commissioned to serve.  It did more for them than it was\r\npossible for them to do for it.  It took hold on the very foundations\r\nof the Government, and electrified all the springs of our national\r\nlife; and although great mistakes were made, and the fervor of this\r\nperiod was followed by a sickening dispensation of demoralized\r\npolitics, it was a great privilege to be permitted to share in the\r\ngrand battle for the Nation's life, and the work of radical re-\r\nadjustment which followed.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to several of the conspicuous characters\r\nwhose names I have grouped.  Such men as Collamer, Fessenden,\r\nBrowning and Trumbull, were among the famous lawyers and conservatives\r\non the Republican side of the Senate.  They were conscientious and\r\nunflinching partisans, but were studiously anxious to save the\r\nUnion according to the Constitution, and deprecated all extreme\r\nand doubtful measures.  Opposed to them stood Sumner, Wade, Chandler,\r\nand their radical associates, who believed in saving the Union at\r\nall hazards, and that not even the Constitution should be allowed\r\nto stay the arm of the Government in blasting the power of the\r\nRebels.  It was perhaps fortunate for the country that these\r\ndivisions existed, and held each other in check.  Mr. Collamer was\r\nthe impersonation of logical force and the beau ideal of a lawyer\r\nand judge.  There was a sort of majesty in the figure and brow of\r\nFessenden when addressing the Senate, and his sarcasm was as keen\r\nas it was inimitable; but his nature was kindly, and his integrity\r\nperfect.  Trumbull was a less commanding figure, but he greatly\r\nhonored his position as chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the\r\nSenate, and his memory will be held in perpetual remembrance as\r\nthe author of the Civil Rights Bill and of the XIII Amendment to\r\nthe Constitution.  Sumner, I think, was the purest man in the\r\nSenate, if not the ablest.  He was pre-eminently the hero of duty,\r\nand the servant of what he believed to be the truth.  No man could\r\nhave made a more absolute surrender of himself to his country in\r\nthe great conflict which threatened its life.  His weary and jaded\r\nlook always excited my sympathy, for he seemed to be sacrificing\r\nall the joys of life, and life itself, in his zeal for the public\r\nservice.  I knew Wade more intimately than any man in the Senate,\r\nthrough my association with him as a member of the same Committee\r\nfor successive years, and was always interested in his personal\r\ntraits and peculiarities.  He was \"a man of uncommon downrightness.\"\r\nThere was even a sort of fascination about his profanity.  It had\r\nin it a spontaniety and heartiness which made it almost seem the\r\necho of a virtue.  It was unlike the profane words of Thaddeus\r\nStevens, which were frequently carried on the shafts of his wit\r\nand lost in the laughter it provoked.  Edmunds, now so famous as\r\na lawyer, and leader in the Senate, and so well known by his reputed\r\nresemblance to St. Jerome, was simply respectable on his first\r\nappearance; but his ability, industry, and constant devotion to\r\nhis duties soon gave him rank among the prominent men in that body.\r\nGrimes of Iowa was one of the really strong men of this period,\r\nwhile Harlan, his colleague, possessed a vigor and grasp of mind\r\nwhich I think the public never fully accorded him.  Lane of Indiana\r\nwas full of patriotic ardor, and like Baker of Oregon, had the rare\r\ngift of eloquent impromptu speech.  Henry Wilson earned the gratitude\r\nof his country by his unswerving loyalty to freedom, and his great\r\nlabors and invaluable services as chairman of the Military Committee.\r\nHoward ranked among the first lawyers and most faithful men in the\r\nbody, and no man had a clearer grasp of the issues of the war.\r\nHenderson was a strong man, whose integrity and political independence\r\nwere afterward abundantly proved.  Doolittle was a man of vigor,\r\nand made a good record as a Republican, but he naturally belonged\r\nto the other side of the Senate, and finally found his way to it,\r\nthrough the quarrel with Johnson.\r\n\r\nGarrett Davis was always an interesting figure.  His volubility of\r\ntalk bordered on the miraculous; and whenever he began to swathe\r\nthe Senate in his interminable rhetoric it awakened the laughter\r\nor the despair of everybody on the floor or in the galleries.\r\nBayard and Thurman were recognized as the strong men on their side\r\nof the Senate in the Forty-first Congress.  Buckalew was one of\r\nthe really sterling men of his party, but he was a modest man, and\r\nonly appreciated by those who knew him intimately.  As a leading\r\nDemocrat, Hendricks stood well in the Senate.  He was so cautious\r\nand diplomatic in temper and so genial and conciliatory in his\r\nmanner that he glided smoothly through the rugged conflict of\r\nopinions in which his side of the chamber was unavoidably involved.\r\nB. Gratz Brown was known as an intense radical, but he made little\r\nmark in this crisis.  He wrote out elaborate and scholarly essays\r\nwhich he read to the Senate, but they received slight attention\r\nfrom members, and seemed to bear little fruit.  Carpenter, Schurz\r\nand Morton took their seats after the war, and were not long in\r\nfinding honorable recognition.  Carpenter was as brilliant and\r\nversatile in intellect as he was naturally eloquent in speech and\r\nwayward in morals.  Carl Schurz displayed ability in the famous\r\ndebate with Morton and Conkling on the sale of arms to the French,\r\nand his political independence in 1872 gave him great prominence\r\nas a Liberal Republican leader; but that virtue has been less\r\nconspicuously illustrated in later years.  Morton became famous\r\nsoon after he entered the Senate.  The \"logic of events\" had\r\nrevolutionized the opinions so vigorously espoused by him only a\r\nfew months before, and his great speech on reconstruction, in which\r\nhe avowed and defended his change of base, brought him into great\r\nprominence, and multiplied his friends in every section of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the House, Roscoe Conkling was recognized as a man of considerable\r\ntalent and great self-esteem.  I have elsewhere referred to his\r\npassage at arms with Blaine.  He never linked his name with any\r\nimportant principle or policy, and was singularly wanting in the\r\nqualities of a party leader.  No one questioned his personal\r\nintegrity, but in later years he was prompt and zealous in the\r\ndefense of the worst abuses which found shelter in his party.  Mr.\r\nSherman was shrewd, wiry and diplomatic, but gave little promise\r\nof the career he has since achieved through ambition, industry and\r\nfavoring conditions.  Shellabarger was one of the ablest men in\r\nthe House, and was so rated.  He was always faithful and vigilant,\r\nand I have before given an instance of this in his timely action\r\non the question of reconstruction.  Mr. Blaine, during the first\r\nyears of his service, showed little activity.  He spoke but seldom\r\nand briefly, but always with vigor and effect.  He steadily grew\r\ninto favor with his party in the House as a man of force, but\r\nwithout seeming to strive for it.  I think his abilities were never\r\nfully appreciated till he became speaker.  His personal magnetism\r\nwas as remarkable as his readiness to serve a friend was unfailing;\r\nbut, like Mr. Conkling, he never identified himself with any great\r\nlegislative measure.\r\n\r\nHenry Winter Davis was the most formidable debater in the House.\r\nHe was full of resources, while the rapidity of his utterance and\r\nthe impetuosity of his speech bore down every thing before it.\r\nThe fire and force of his personality seemed to make him irresistible,\r\nand can only be likened to the power displayed by Mr. Blaine in\r\nthe House, in his later and palmier years.  When Gen. Garfield\r\nentered the Thirty-eighth Congress there was a winning modesty in\r\nhis demeanor.  I was interested in his first effort on the floor,\r\nwhich was brief, and marked by evident diffidence.  He was not\r\nlong, however, in recovering his self-possession, and soon engaged\r\nactively in general debate.  His oratory, at first, was the reverse\r\nof winning, owing to the peculiar intonation of his voice, but\r\ngradually improved, while his hunger for knowledge, unflagging\r\nindustry, and ambition for distinction, gradually revealed themselves\r\nas very clearly defined traits.  During the first years of his\r\nservice the singular grasp of his mind was not appreciated, but it\r\nwas easy to see that he was growing, and that a man of his political\r\nambition and great industry could not be satisfied with any position\r\nof political mediocrity.  His situation as a Representative of the\r\nNineteenth Ohio District was exceedingly favorable to his aspirations,\r\nas it was the custom of that district to continue a man in its\r\nservice when once installed, and its overwhelming majority relieved\r\nhim of all concern about the result.  He could thus give his whole\r\ntime and thought to the study of politics, and the mastery of those\r\nhistorical and literary pursuits which he afterward made so available\r\nin the finish and embellishment of his speeches.\r\n\r\nAs a parliamentary leader, Mr. Stevens, of course, was always the\r\ncentral figure in the House.  No possible emergency could disconcert\r\nhim.  Whether the attack came from friend or foe, or in whatever\r\nform, he was ready, on the instant, to repel it and turn the tables\r\ncompletely upon his assailant.  He exercised the most absolute\r\nfreedom of speech, making his thrusts with the same coolness at\r\n\"unrighteous copperheads and self-righteous Republicans.\"  In\r\nreferring to the moderate and deprecatory views of Colfax and Olin,\r\nin January, 1863, he said he had always been fifteen years in\r\nadvance of his party, but never so far ahead that its members did\r\nnot overtake him.  His keenest thrusts were frequently made in such\r\na tone and manner as to disarm them of their sting, and create\r\nuniversal merriment.  When Whaley of West Virginia begged him,\r\nimportunately, to yield the floor a moment for a brief statement,\r\nwhile Mr. Stevens was much engrossed with an important discussion,\r\nhe finally gave way, saying, \"Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman\r\nfrom West Virginia for a few feeble remarks.\"  When he lost his\r\ntemper and waged war in earnest his invective was absolutely\r\nremorseless, as in the example I have given of it in a previous\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nI have before referred to the oratory of Bingham.  He was a reader\r\nof books and a master of English.  He loved poetry, and was one of\r\nthe most genial and companionable of men, but he was irritable and\r\ncrispy in temper, and a formidable customer in debate.  He had\r\nseveral angry bouts with Butler, in one of which he spoke sneeringly\r\nof the \"hero of Fort Fisher,\" to which Butler replied that the\r\ngentleman from Ohio had shown his prowess in the hanging of Mrs.\r\nSurratt, an innocent woman, upon the scaffold.  Bingham retorted\r\nthat such a charge was \"only fit to come from a man who lives in\r\na bottle, and is fed with a spoon.\"  He was often dogmatic and\r\nlacking in coolness and balance, but in later years he showed\r\nuncommon tact in extricating himself from the odium threatened by\r\nhis connection with the Credit Mobilier scheme.\r\n\r\nOne of the really strong men in the House was John Hickman, of\r\nPennsylvania, who had been a prominent figure in Congress during\r\nBuchanan's administration.  He was a man of brains, courage, and\r\nworth.  Potter was a true and brave man, whose acceptance of a\r\nchallenge from Roger A. Pryor, and choice of butcher knives as the\r\nweapons of warfare, had made him very popular at the North.  Rollins\r\nof Missouri was an eloquent man, of superior ability and attainments,\r\nand large political experience.  Pike of Maine was one of the first\r\nmen in the House, but too honest and independent to sacrifice his\r\nconvictions for the sake of success.  Deming of Connecticut was a\r\nman of real calibre, and on rare occasions electrified the House\r\nby his speeches, but he lacked industry.  One of the finest debaters\r\nin the House was Henry J. Raymond.  He displayed very decided power\r\nin the debate on Reconstruction, and very effectively exposed the\r\nweakness of the Republicans in practically dealing with the Rebel\r\nStates as if they were at once in and out of the Union.  Among the\r\nmost striking figures in the House were Butler and Cox, whose\r\ncontests were greatly relished.  They were well matched, and\r\nalternately carried off the prize of victory.  Butler, in the first\r\nonset, achieved a decided triumph in his reply to a very personal\r\nassault by Cox.  \"As to the vituperation of the member from New\r\nYork,\" said he, \"he will hear my answer to him by every boy that\r\nwhistles it on the street, and every hand-organ, 'Shoo, fly, don't\r\nbodder me'!\"  Cox, for the time, was extinguished, but patiently\r\nwatched his opportunity till he found his revenge, which Butler\r\nafterward frankly acknowledged.  For a time there was bad blood\r\nbetween them, but they finally became friends, and I think so\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks was always a notable personality.  His erect figure,\r\nmilitary eye, and splendid voice secured for him the admiring\r\nattention of the galleries whenever he addressed the House.  Ashley\r\nof Ohio who took the lead in the impeachment movement, in which he\r\nwas so zealous that he became known as \"Impeachment Ashley,\" was\r\nanother picturesque figure.  His fine _physique,_ frolicsome face,\r\nand luxuriant suit of curly brown hair singled him out among the\r\nbald heads of the body as one of its most attractive members.\r\nBoutwell impressed the House as a man of solid qualities, and a\r\nformidable debater.  He acquitted himself admirably in his defense\r\nof Butler against a savage attack by Brooks.  Blair was a man of\r\nability, independence, and courage, of which his record in the\r\nHouse gave ample proof.  Wilson of Iowa was a young man when he\r\nentered Congress, but soon gave proof of his ability, and took rank\r\nas one of the best lawyers on the Judiciary Committee.  Judge\r\nKelley, since known as the \"Father of the House,\" and one of the\r\nfathers of the Greenback movement, first attracted attention by\r\nthe wonderful volume and power of his voice.  It filled the entire\r\nHall, and subdued all rival sounds; but to the surprise of everybody,\r\nhe met with more than his match when he was followed, one day, by\r\nVan Wyck, of New York, who triumphantly carried off the palm.\r\nKelley's voice was little more than a zephyr, in comparison with\r\nthe roar and thunder that followed it and called forth shouts of\r\nlaughter, while Kelley quietly occupied his seat as if in dumb\r\namazement at what had happened.\r\n\r\nJames Brooks was always a conspicuous figure on the Democratic side\r\nof the House.  I first knew him in the log cabin days of 1840, and\r\nafterward served with him in the Congress of 1849.  He was a man\r\nof ability, a genuine hater of the negro, and a bitter partisan;\r\nbut I never saw any reason to doubt his personal integrity, and I\r\nthink the affair which threw so dark a cloud over his reputation\r\nin later years was a surprise to all who knew him.  Michael C. Kerr\r\nwas one of the very first men in the House, and a man of rare purity\r\nand worth.  Randall, like Garfield, was a growing man during the\r\nwar, and through his ambition, natural abilities, and Congressional\r\ntraining, he became one of the chief magnates of his party.\r\nPendleton was counted an able man, and made his mark as a Bourbon\r\nDemocrat and the champion of hard money; but he subsequently spoiled\r\nhis financial record by his scheme for flooding the country with\r\ngreenbacks.  Vallandigham was conspicuous for his intellectual\r\nvigor, passionate earnestness, and hatred of Abolitionism.  He had\r\nthe courage of his opinions.  The Republicans hated him consumedly.\r\nHe was a member of the House Committee on Public Lands, which\r\nreported the Homestead Bill, and I remember that no Republican\r\nmember, except the chairman, showed the slightest disposition to\r\nrecognize him.  After the war was ended, however, and the work of\r\nreconstruction was accomplished, his temper and qualities seemed\r\nto have spent much of their force.  He was among the very first to\r\nplead for acquiescence and the policy of reconciliation; and if\r\nhis life had been spared I believe his catholic spirit and active\r\nleadership in the \"New Departure\" would have re-instated him in\r\nthe sincere regard of men of all parties.  Lovejoy was the most\r\nimpassioned orator in the House.  His speeches were remarkable for\r\ntheir pungency and wit, and when the question of slavery was under\r\ndiscussion his soul took fire.  He hated slavery with the animosity\r\nof a regular Puritan, and when he talked about it everybody listened.\r\nWickliffe of Kentucky was one of the most offensive representatives\r\nof the Border State policy, and whenever he spoke Lovejoy was sure\r\nto follow.  As often as Wickliffe got the floor it was noticed that\r\nLovejoy's brow was immediately darkened in token of the impending\r\nstrife, while his friends and enemies prepared themselves for the\r\nscene.  Wickliffe was a large, fierce-looking man, with a shrill\r\nvoice, and quite as belligerent as Lovejoy; and their contests were\r\nfrequent, and always enjoyed by the House, and for some time became\r\na regular feature of its business.\r\n\r\nElihu B. Washburne was conspicuous as the champion of economy.  He\r\nrivaled Holman as the \"watch-dog of the treasury\" and the enemy of\r\nland-grants.  He was a man of force, and rendered valuable service\r\nto the country, but he assumed such airs of superior virtue, and\r\nfrequently lectured the House in so magisterial a tone as to make\r\nhimself a little unpopular with members.  This was strikingly\r\nillustrated in 1868, in his controversy with Donnelly of Minnesota\r\nagainst whom he had made some dishonorable charges through a\r\nMinnesota newspaper.  Donnelly was an Irishman, a wit, and an\r\nexceedingly versatile genius, and when it became known that he was\r\nto defend himself in the House against Washburne's charges, and make\r\na counter attack, every member was in his seat, although the weather\r\nwas intensely hot and no legislative business was to be transacted.\r\nDonnelly had fully prepared himself, and such a castigation as he\r\nadministered, has rarely, if ever, been witnessed in a legislative\r\nbody.  He kept a ceaseless and overwhelming fire of wit, irony,\r\nand ridicule, for nearly two hours, during which the members\r\nfrequently laughed and sometimes applauded, while Washburne sat pale\r\nand mute under the infliction.  The tables were turned upon him,\r\nalthough portions of Donnelly's tirade were unparliamentary, and\r\nindefensible on the score of coarseness and bad taste.  No member,\r\nhowever, raised any point of order; but the friends of Mr. Washburne\r\nafterward surrounded Donnelly, and by artful appeals to his good\r\nnature prevailed upon him to suppress a portion of the speech, and\r\nto proffer statements which tended to destroy its effect and to\r\nrestore to Washburne the ground he had lost.  The House had its fun,\r\nwhile Washburne deigned no reply except to re-affirm his charges,\r\nand Donnelly's friends were vexed at his needless surrender of his\r\nvantage-ground.  It was an odd and unexpected _denouement_ of a\r\nvery remarkable exhibition.\r\n\r\nOakes Ames was one of the members of the House with whom I was best\r\nacquainted.  I thought I knew him well, and I never had the slightest\r\nreason to suspect his public or private integrity.  Personally and\r\nsocially he was one of the kindliest men I ever knew, and I was\r\ngreatly surprised when I learned of his connection with the Credit\r\nMobilier project.  It first found its way into politics through a\r\nspeech of Horace Greeley near the close of the canvass of 1872,\r\nbut it had been fully exposed by Washburn of Wisconsin in a speech\r\nin Congress in the year 1868.  The history of its connection with\r\nAmerican politics and politicians forms an exceedingly interesting\r\nand curious chapter.  The fate of the men involved in it seems like\r\na perfect travesty of justice and fair play.  Some of them have\r\ngone down under the waves of popular condemnation.  Others, occupying\r\nsubstantially the same position, according to the evidence, have\r\nmade their escape and even been honored and trusted by the public,\r\nwhile still others are quietly whiling away their lives under the\r\nshadow of suspicion.  The case affords a strange commentary upon\r\nthe principle of historic justice.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable facts connected with the first years of\r\nthe war was the descent of the Abolitionists upon Washington.  They\r\nsecured the hall of the Smithsonian Institute for their meetings,\r\nwhich they held weekly, and at which the Rev. John Pierpont presided.\r\nIt was with much difficulty that the hall was procured, and one of\r\nthe conditions of granting it was that it should be distinctly\r\nunderstood and announced that the Smithsonian Institute was to be\r\nin no way responsible for anything that might be said by the\r\nspeakers.  This was very emphatically insisted on by Professor\r\nHenry, and was duly announced at the first meeting.  At the following,\r\nand each succeeding lecture, Mr. Pierpont regularly made the same\r\nannouncement.  These gatherings were largely attended and very\r\nenthusiastic; and as the anti-slavery tide constantly grew stronger,\r\nthe weekly announcement that \"the Smithsonian Institute desires it\r\nto be distinctly understood that it is not to be held responsible\r\nfor the utterances of the speakers,\" awakened the sense of the\r\nludicrous, and called forth rounds of applause and explosions of\r\nlaughter by the audience, in front of which Professor Henry was\r\nseated.  Each meeting thus began with a frolic of good humor, which\r\nMr. Pierpont evidently enjoyed, for he made his announcement with\r\na gravity which naturally provoked the mirth which followed.  These\r\nmeetings were addressed by Wendell Phillips, Gerrit Smith, Ralph\r\nWaldo Emerson, Dr. Brownson, and other notable men, and were enjoyed\r\nas a sort of jubilee by the men and women who attended them.\r\n\r\nThe services in the Hall of Representatives each Sabbath formed\r\nthe fitting counterpart of these proceedings.  The crowds in\r\nattendance filled every part of the floor and galleries, and were\r\nfull of enthusiasm.  The most terrific arraignment of slavery I\r\never listened to was by Rev. Dr. George B. Cheever, in the course\r\nof these services.  He was a man of great ability, unquenchable\r\nzeal, fervid eloquence, and an Old Testament Christian who was\r\nsometimes called the Prophet Isaiah of the anti-slavery cause.  He\r\ncarried his religion courageously into politics, and while arraigning\r\nslavery as the grand rebel, he also severely criticised the management\r\nof the war and the Border State policy of the President.  The most\r\npronounced anti-slavery sermons were also preached in the Capital\r\nby Dr. Boynton, Mr. Channing and others, while the Hutchinson family\r\noccasionally entertained the public with their anti-slavery songs.\r\nAll this must have been sufficiently shocking to the slave-holding\r\npolitics and theology of the city, whose slumbers were thus rudely\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar fascination about life in Washington during\r\nthe war.  The city itself was unattractive.  Its ragged appearance,\r\nwretched streets, and sanitary condition were the reproach of its\r\ncitizens, who could have had no dream of the Washington of to-day;\r\nbut it was a great military as well as political center.  Our troops\r\nwere pouring in from every loyal State, and the drum-beat was heard\r\nnight and day, while the political and social element hitherto in\r\nthe ascendant, was completely submerged by the great flood from\r\nthe North.  The city was surrounded, and in part occupied by\r\nhospitals, and for a time many of the principal churches were\r\nsurrendered to the use of our sick and wounded soldiers, whose\r\nnumbers were fearfully swelled after each great battle.  The imminent\r\nperil to which the Capital was repeatedly exposed, and the constantly\r\nchanging fortunes of the war, added greatly to the interest of the\r\ncrisis, and marked the alternations of hope and fear among the\r\nfriends and enemies of the Union.  But notwithstanding the seriousness\r\nof the times, there was a goodly measure of real social life.\r\nHuman nature demanded some relaxation from the dreadful strain and\r\nburden of the great conflict, and this was partially found in the\r\nlevees of the President and Cabinet ministers, and the receptions\r\nof the Speaker, which were largely attended and greatly enjoyed;\r\nand this enjoyment was doubtless much enhanced by the peculiar bond\r\nof union and feeling of brotherhood which the state of the country\r\nawakened among its friends.  The most pleasant of these occasions,\r\nhowever, were the weekly receptions of the Speaker.  Those of\r\nSpeaker Grow were somewhat marred, and sometimes interrupted, by\r\nhis failing health, but the receptions of Mr. Colfax were singularly\r\ndelightful.  He discharged the duties of his great office with\r\nmarked ability and fairness, and was personally very popular; and\r\nthere always gathered about him on these occasions an assemblage\r\nof charming and congenial people, whose genuine cordiality was a\r\nrebuke to the insincerity so often witnessed in social life.\r\n\r\nBut I need not further pursue these personal details, nor linger\r\nover the by-gones of a grand epoch.  We have entered upon a new\r\ndispensation.  The withdrawal of the slavery question from the\r\nstrife of parties has changed the face of our politics as completely\r\nas did its introduction.  The transition from an abnormal and\r\nrevolutionary period to the regular and orderly administration of\r\naffairs, has been as remarkable as the intervention of the great\r\nquestion which eclipsed every other till it compelled its own\r\nsolution.  Although this transition has given birth to an era of\r\n\"slack-water politics,\" it has gradually brought the country face\r\nto face with new problems, some of which are quite as vital to the\r\nexistence and welfare of the Republic as those which have taxed\r\nthe statesmanship of the past.  The tyranny of industrial domination,\r\nwhich borrows its life from the alliance of concentrated capital\r\nwith labor-saving machinery, must be overthrown.  Commercial\r\nfeudalism, wielding its power through the machinery of great\r\ncorporations which are practically endowed with life officers and\r\nthe right of hereditary succession and control the makers and\r\nexpounders of our laws, must be subordinated to the will of the\r\npeople.  The system of agricultural serfdom called Land Monopoly,\r\nwhich is now putting on new forms of danger in the rapid multiplication\r\nof great estates and the purchase of vast bodies of lands by foreign\r\ncapitalists, must be resisted as a still more formidable foe of\r\ndemocratic Government.  The legalized robbery now carried on in\r\nthe name of Protection to American labor must be overthrown.  The\r\nsystem of spoils and plunder must also be destroyed, in order that\r\nfreedom itself may be rescued from the perilous activities quickened\r\ninto life by its own spirit, and the conduct of public affairs\r\ninspired by the great moralities which dignify public life.\r\n\r\nThese are the problems which appeal to the present generation, and\r\nespecially to the honorable ambition of young men now entering upon\r\npublic life.  Their solution is certain, because they are directly\r\nin the path of progress, and progress is a law; but whether it\r\nshall be heralded by the kindly agencies of peace or the harsh\r\npower of war, must depend upon the wise and timely use of opportunities.\r\nThe result is certain, since justice can not finally be defeated;\r\nbut the circumstances of the struggle and the cost of its triumph\r\nare committed to the people, who can scarcely fail to find both\r\ninstruction and warning in the story of the anti-slavery conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.
