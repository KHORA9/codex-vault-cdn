We\r\nare glad to feel called upon to express our views on this subject, to\r\nwhich we think full justice has not yet been done.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, in doing so, make a great distinction between the two\r\nclasses of persons who are now found to be joined in an alliance against\r\nthis application of free-trade principles; two classes who have always\r\nhitherto been so much opposed to each other, that it would have been\r\nvery difficult ten years since to have conceived any possible\r\ncombinations of circumstances that could have brought them to act in\r\nconcert: we mean the West India interest, who so violently opposed every\r\nstep of amelioration to the slave from first to last; and that body of\r\n_truly great philanthropists_ who have been unceasing in their efforts\r\nto abolish slavery wherever and in whatever form it was to be found. To\r\nthe latter alone we shall address our remarks.\r\n\r\nAs far as it can be collected, the argument relied upon by this party\r\nappears to be, that having once abolished slavery in our own dominions\r\nwe ought to interdict the importation of articles produced by slave\r\nlabour in other countries, in order to coerce them, for the sake of\r\ntheir trade with us, to follow our example.\r\n\r\nWe trust we shall be among the last who will ever be found advocating\r\nthe continuance of slavery, or opposing any _legitimate_ means for its\r\nextinction; but we feel well assured that those who have adopted the\r\nopinion quoted above, have little considered either the consequences or\r\nthe tendencies of the policy they support.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is, that if this policy is to be acted upon, on\r\nprinciple, it must extend to the exclusion of _all_ articles produced in\r\nwhatever country by slaves. It must apply with equal force to the\r\n_gold_, _silver_, and _copper_ of Brazil, as it does to the _sugar_ and\r\n_coffee_ produced in that country;--it must apply with equal force to\r\nthe _cotton_, the _rice_, the _indigo_, the _cochineal_, and the\r\n_tobacco_ of the Southern States of America, and Mexico, as it does to\r\nthe _sugar_ and _coffee_ of Cuba. To be in any way consistent in\r\ncarrying out this principle, we must exclude the great material on which\r\nthe millions of Lancashire, the West of Yorkshire, and Lanarkshire\r\ndepend for their daily subsistence; we must equally exclude tobacco,\r\nwhich gives revenue to the extent of 3,500,000_l._ annually; we must\r\nrefuse any use of the precious metals, whether for coin, ornament, or\r\nother purposes. But even these form only one class of the obligations\r\nwhich the affirming of this principle would impose upon us. If we would\r\ncoerce the Brazilians by not buying from them, it necessarily involves\r\nthe duty of not selling to them; for if we sell, we supply them with all\r\nthe means of conducting their slave labour; we supply the implements of\r\nlabour, or the materials from which they are made; we supply clothing\r\nfor themselves and their slaves; we supply part of their foods and most\r\nof their luxuries; the wines and the spirits in which the slave-owner\r\nindulges; and we even supply the very materials of which the implements\r\nof slave punishment or coercion are made;--and thus participate much\r\nmore directly in the profits of slavery than by admitting their produce\r\ninto this country. But if we supply them with all these articles, which\r\nwe do to the extent of nearly 3,000,000_l._ a year, and are not to\r\nreceive some of their slave-tainted produce, it must follow that we are\r\nto give them without an equivalent, than which no greater encouragement\r\ncould be given for a perseverance in slave-holding. But the truth\r\nis--whatever pretensions we make on this subject--we do, in exchange for\r\nour goods, buy their polluted produce; we employ our ships to convey it\r\nfrom their shores, and ourselves find a market for it among other\r\ncountries already well supplied with cheap sugar, where it is not\r\nrequired, and where it only tends the more to depress the price in\r\nmarkets already abundantly supplied. Nay, we do more; we admit it into\r\nour ports, we land it on our shores, we place it in our bonded\r\nwarehouses, and our busy merchants and brokers deal as freely on our\r\nexchanges in this slave produce as in any other, only with this\r\ndifference--that this cheap sugar is not permitted to be consumed by our\r\nown starving population, but can only be sold to be refined in bond for\r\nthe consumption of the free labourers in our West India colonies and\r\nothers, or to be re-exported, as it is, for the use of \"our less\r\nscrupulous but more consistent\" neighbours on the continent.\r\n\r\nConsistency, therefore, requires equally the abandonment of all export\r\ntrade to slave-producing countries, as it does of the import of their\r\nproduce; and the effect will carry us even further. We know it is a\r\nfavourite feeling with Mr Joseph Sturge and others of that truly\r\nbenevolent class, that in eschewing any connexion with slave-producing\r\ncountries, we have the better reason to urge free-trading intercourse\r\nwith such countries as use only free labour,--with the Northern States\r\nof America, with Java, and other countries similarly circumstanced. Now\r\nof what does our trade to these countries, in common with others,\r\nchiefly consist? Of the 51,400,000_l._ of British manufactures and\r\nproduce which we exported in 1840, upwards of 24,500,000_l._ consisted\r\nof cotton goods, nearly the whole of which were manufactured from\r\nslave-grown cotton, and partly dyed and printed with the cochineal and\r\nindigo of Guatamala and Mexico. Consistency would therefore further\r\nrequire that we abandon at least one-half of our present foreign trade\r\neven with free-labour countries, instead of opening any opportunity for\r\nits increase.\r\n\r\nWhen men are prepared and conceive it a duty to urge the accomplishment\r\nof all these results, they may then consistently oppose the introduction\r\nof Brazilian sugar and coffee, and support the present West India\r\nmonopoly; but not till then.\r\n\r\nBut now, what effect must this argument have upon slave-producing\r\nstates, in inducing them to abandon slavery? Has it not long been one of\r\nthe chief arguments of the anti-slavery party everywhere, that free\r\nlabour is actually cheaper than slave labour? Now, will the Brazilians\r\ngive credit to this proposition, so strongly insisted upon, when they\r\nsee that the anti-slavery party conceive it needful to give support to a\r\nsystem which affirms the necessity of protecting free labour against\r\nslave labour, by imposing a prohibitory duty of upwards of 100 per cent.\r\non the produce of the latter? Will their opinion of the relative\r\ncheapness of the two kinds of labour not rather be determined by our\r\nactions than our professions?\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that free labour, properly exercised, is cheaper than\r\nslave labour; but there is no pretence to say that it is so at this\r\nmoment in our West India colonies; and we undertake to show, in an early\r\nnumber, in connexion with this fact, that _the existence of the high\r\nprotecting duties on our West India produce has done more than anything\r\nelse to endanger the whole experiment of emancipation_.\r\n\r\nBut, moreover, our West India monopoly,--the existence of the high\r\nprohibitory differential duty on sugar, is the greatest, strongest, and\r\nleast answerable argument at present used by slave-holding countries\r\nagainst emancipation. The following was put strongly to ourselves in\r\nAmsterdam a short time since by a large slave owner in Dutch\r\nGuiana:--\"We should be glad,\" said he, \"to follow your example, and\r\nemancipate our slaves, if it were possible; but as long as your\r\ndifferential duties on sugar are maintained, it will be impossible. Here\r\nis an account sale of sugar produced in our colony, netting a return of\r\n11_l._ per hogshead to the planter in Surinam; and here is an account\r\nsale of similar sugar sold in London, netting a return of 33_l._ to the\r\nplanter in Demerara: the difference ascribable only to your differential\r\nduty. The fields of these two classes of planters are separated only by\r\na few ditches. Now such is the effort made by the planter in Demerara to\r\nextend his cultivation to secure the high price of 33_l._, that he is\r\nimporting free labourers from the hills of Hindostan, and from the coast\r\nof Africa, at great cost, and is willing to pay higher wages than labour\r\nwill command even in Europe. Let us, then, emancipate our slaves, which,\r\nif it had any effect, would confer the privilege of a choice of\r\nemployer, and Dutch Guiana would be depopulated in a day,--an easy means\r\nof increasing the supply of labour to the planters of Demerara, at the\r\ncost of entire annihilation of the cultivation of the estates in\r\nSurinam. But abandon your differential duties, give us the same price\r\nfor our produce, and thus enable us to pay the same rate of wages, and\r\nI, for one, will not object to liberate my slaves to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever amount of credence people may be disposed to place in this\r\nwillingness to abandon slavery, nothing can be more clear than that the\r\nhigher rate of wages paid in our colonies, attributable solely to the\r\nhigh and extravagant price which, by our differential duties, their\r\nproduce commands, must ever form a strong and conclusive reason with\r\nthese slave-holding countries against their entertaining the question of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nWe believe most sincerely that an equalization of these duties--that an\r\nentire free trade would do more than any other act to encourage an\r\nadoption of our example everywhere: while the maintenance of monopoly\r\nand high prices _as an essential to the carrying out of the experiment\r\nof free labour successfully_--must be the strongest reason against its\r\nadoption with all those countries who have no means of commanding this\r\naccompanying confessed essential.\r\n\r\nBut now were it otherwise:--have the professors of these opinions ever\r\nconsidered the huge responsibility which they arrogate to themselves by\r\nsuch a course? Let these men remember that, by seeking to coerce the\r\n_slave-labour producer_ in distant countries, they inflict a severe\r\npunishment on the millions of hard-working, ill-fed _consumers_ among\r\ntheir fellow countrymen; but they seem always to overlook the fact, that\r\nthere is a _consumer_ to consider as well as a _producer_;--and that\r\nthis consumer is their own countryman, their own neighbour, whose\r\ncondition it is their _first_ duty to consult and watch;--duty as well\r\nas charity ought to be first exercised at home. That is a very doubtful\r\nhumanity which exercises itself on the uncertain result of influence\r\nindirectly produced upon governments in the other hemisphere of the\r\nglobe, and neglects, nay sacrifices, the interests of the poor and\r\nhelpless around our own doors,--not only by placing the necessaries of\r\nlife beyond their reach, but at the same time destroying the demand for\r\ntheir labour by which alone they can obtain them.\r\n\r\nIf _individuals_ entertain conscientious scruples against the use of\r\nslave produce--let them, if they please, act upon them themselves, but\r\ndo not let them seek to inflict _certain_ punishment, and the whole\r\ntrain of vice and misery consequent on starvation and want of\r\nemployment, upon their poorer neighbours, for the purpose of conferring\r\nsome _speculative_ advantage on the slaves of the Brazils or elsewhere:\r\nno man can be called upon as a duty to do so great a present evil, in\r\norder to accomplish some distant good, however great--or however\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALLACY OF PROTECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll laws made for the purpose of protecting the interests of individuals\r\nor classes must mean, if they mean anything, to render the articles\r\nwhich such classes deal in or produce dearer than they would otherwise\r\nbe if the public was left at liberty to supply itself with such\r\ncommodities in the manner which their own interests and choice would\r\ndictate. In order to make them dearer it is absolutely necessary to make\r\nthem scarcer; for quantity being large or small in proportion to demand,\r\nalone can regulate the price;--protection, therefore, to any commodity\r\nsimply means that the quantity supplied to the community shall be less\r\nthan circumstances would naturally provide, but that for the smaller\r\nquantity supplied under the restriction of law the same sum shall be\r\npaid as the larger quantity would command without such restriction.\r\n\r\nTime was when the Sovereigns of England relied chiefly on the granting\r\nof patents to individuals for the exclusive exercise of certain trades\r\nor occupations in particular places, as the means of rewarding the\r\nservices of some, and as a provision for others of their adherents,\r\nfollowers, and favourites, who either held the exclusive supply in their\r\nown hands on their own terms, or who again granted to others under them\r\nthat privilege, receiving from them a portion of the gains. In the\r\ncourse of time, however, the public began to discover that these\r\nmonopolies acted upon them directly as a tax of a most odious\r\ndescription; that the privileged person found it needful always to keep\r\nthe supply short to obtain his high price (for as soon as he admitted\r\nplenty he had no command of price)--that, in short, the sovereign, in\r\nconferring a mark of regard on a favourite, gave not that which he\r\nhimself possessed, but only invested him with the power of imposing a\r\ncontribution on the public.\r\n\r\nThe public once awake to the true operation of such privileges, and\r\nseverely suffering under the injuries which they inflicted,\r\nperseveringly struggled against these odious monopolies, until the\r\nsystem was entirely abandoned, and the crown was deprived of the power\r\nof granting patents of this class. But though the public saw clearly\r\nenough that these privileges granted by the sovereign to individuals\r\noperated thus prejudicially on the community, they did not see with\r\nequal clearness that the same power transferred to, and exercised by,\r\nParliament, to confer similar privileges on classes; to do for a number\r\nof men what the sovereign had before done for single men, would, to the\r\nremaining portion of the community, be just as prejudicial as the abuses\r\nagainst which they had struggled. That like the sovereign, the\r\nParliament, in protecting or giving privileges to a class, gave nothing\r\nwhich they possessed themselves, but granted only the power to such\r\nclasses of raising a contribution from the remaining portion of the\r\ncommunity, by levying a higher price for their commodity than it would\r\notherwise command. As with individuals, it was equally necessary to make\r\nscarcity to secure price, and that could only be done by restricting the\r\nsources of supply by prohibiting, or by imposing high duties on, foreign\r\nimportations. Many circumstances, however, combined to render the use of\r\nthis power by Parliament less obvious than it had been when exercised by\r\nthe sovereign, but chiefly the fact that protection was usually granted\r\nby imposing high duties, often in their effect quite prohibitory, under\r\nthe plea of providing revenue for the state. Many other more modern\r\nexcuses have been urged, such as those of encouraging native industry,\r\nand countervailing peculiar burthens, in order to reconcile public\r\nopinion to the exactions arising out of the system, all of which we\r\nshall, on future occasions, carefully consider separately. But, above\r\nall, the great reason why these evils have been so long endured has\r\nbeen, that the public have believed that all classes and interests,\r\nthough perhaps not exactly to the same extent, have shared in\r\nprotection. We propose at present to confine our consideration to the\r\neffects of protection,--first, on the community generally; and secondly,\r\non the individual classes protected.\r\n\r\nAs it is admitted that protection ought, if granted at all, to be given\r\nto all alike, it would follow that the whole produce of the country\r\nwould be raised to an artificial price; and if this were the case, as\r\nfar as regarded the exchange or transactions among members of the same\r\ncommunity, the effect would be merely nominal, of no advantage to any\r\none, and of little disadvantage beyond the enormous public expense\r\nneeded to prevent people cheating each other by smuggling and bringing\r\nin the cheaper foreign article;--but such a community must forego all\r\nnotion or idea of a foreign trade;--they must have no desires to be\r\ngratified beyond themselves, and they must have within themselves the\r\nindependent means of supplying every want. For even if the law be strong\r\nenough to maintain an artificial high price at home, it has no power of\r\nmaking other countries pay that price; and if everything we possessed\r\ncommanded a higher price at home than other countries could supply the\r\nsame for, we should have nothing which we could exchange for the produce\r\nof other countries, and thus no more foreign trade could exist, than in\r\na poor country which had no surplus produce. It is therefore essential\r\nthat every country should bear in mind, in adopting a system of\r\nprotection to manufactures or other produce, that they thereby\r\neffectually debar themselves from all foreign trade to neutral countries\r\nin such articles; for if they require high duties at home to protect\r\nthem from the produce of other countries, which could only come at\r\nconsiderable expense to compete with them at home, how can they\r\nwithstand that competition when they meet on the same terms in every\r\nrespect in a neutral market? How effectually has France stayed her\r\nexport linen trade by raising the duties and the price of linen yarn,\r\nand by that act, intended as a blow to English trade, given the linen\r\nmanufacturers of this country a greater advantage over France in the\r\nmarkets of the world than ever. How idle are the efforts of the Belgian\r\ngovernment to establish depôts and factories for the sale of their\r\nmanufactures in St Thomas add other places, while the manufacturers in\r\nGhent are only able to maintain their home trade, by high protective\r\nduties, against English, French, and German goods, and still cry out for\r\ngreater protection!\r\n\r\nIt is, however, abundantly plain, that the state of a country above\r\ndescribed could not long exist, when industry and intelligence were in\r\nthe course of producing wealth; for if there be one law in nature more\r\ndistinct than another, it is, that while the productions of every\r\ncountry are less or more limited to particular things, the wants of man\r\nextend to every possible variety of products over the whole world, as\r\nsoon as his means can command them. As a country advances in wealth, it\r\nwill have more and more surplus produce, which under wise laws would\r\nalways consist of such things as it could produce with greatest facility\r\nand profit, whether from the loom or the soil. This surplus produce\r\nwould be exchanged for the productions of other climates, but it must be\r\nquite clear, as soon as we arrive at this stage, that the power of the\r\nlaw to protect price altogether ceases. The surplus exported must sell\r\nin the markets of the world, in competition with the same article\r\nproduced under the cheapest circumstances, and that article in the home\r\nmarket can command only the same price.\r\n\r\nThus the whole attempt to protect all interests equally would\r\nimmediately fail; every article produced in excess, and exported, would\r\ncommand only the lowest prices of open markets, and the fancied\r\nprotection of the law would be void; while everything produced in\r\ndeficiency, and of which we required to import a portion to make up the\r\nneedful supply, would continue to be protected above the natural price\r\nof the world to any extent of import duty that the law imposed upon the\r\nquantity required to make up the deficiency.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, we export a large portion of the woollen, and the\r\nlargest portion of the cotton goods which we manufacture, to all parts\r\nof the world, which we must sell at least as cheap as they can be bought\r\nin any other country. The same articles can only command the same price\r\nin the home market, and though the law imposed an import duty, by way of\r\npretended protection, to any extent, upon similar foreign goods, it\r\nwould not have the effect of raising the price one fraction. On the\r\nother hand, we do not produce as much wool or food as we consume, and\r\nhave every year to import large quantities of each to make up the\r\ndeficiency. Whatever duty, therefore, is put on the import of the\r\nquantity thus required, will enable the producers at home to maintain\r\ntheir price so much above the natural level of the world. By this state\r\nof things the country at large is injured in two distinct and prominent\r\nways:--first,--those articles which we can make in excess, and export,\r\nmust ever be the chief means of absorbing the increasing capital and\r\nlabour of the country; and the impediment thrown in our way, of\r\nimporting those things which we have in deficiency, must necessarily\r\ncheck our power of extending the demand for the produce of such\r\nincreasing labour and capital; and, secondly,--the price of such\r\narticles as we produce in deficiency, will always be maintained much\r\nabove the level of the world, to the great disadvantage of the other\r\ngreat class of producers, the price of whose labour, and whose profits,\r\nwill be regulated by competition with those who have food, &c., at the\r\nlowest price.\r\n\r\nSo much as to the effect on the community at large. We will now shortly\r\nconsider the effect on individual interests, which are thought to enjoy\r\nprotection, and we believe we can show that there never was a condition\r\nso fraught with mischief and disappointment, with such unmitigated\r\ndelusion, deception, and exposure to ruin, than is to be found in every\r\ncase where protection operates. We think it can be clearly shown _that\r\nsuch occupations can never be more profitable; that they must usually be\r\nless profitable; and that they are always more exposed to vicissitudes\r\nthan any other class_.\r\n\r\nThey never can be more profitable, because capital and enterprise will\r\nalways be attracted to any occupation which offers a larger profit than\r\nthe usual rate, till it is reduced to a level with others; they will\r\nusually be less profitable, indeed always in a community of increasing\r\nnumbers, because the price being maintained by restriction above the\r\nprice of the world, prevents an extension of such trades in the same\r\nproportion as those who naturally belong to them, and look to them for\r\noccupation, increase in numbers: they will be exposed to greater\r\nvicissitudes, because, being confined to the supply of only one market,\r\nany accidental circumstance, which either increases the usual supply, or\r\ndiminishes the usual demand, will cause an infinitely greater depression\r\nthan if they were in a condition to avail themselves of the markets of\r\nthe whole world, over which they could spread an accidental and unusual\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\nThus, previous to 1824, the silk manufacturers of this country were\r\nprotected to a greater extent than any other trade, and the price of\r\nsilk goods was maintained much above the rate of other countries; our\r\nsilk trade was therefore necessarily confined almost exclusively to the\r\nhome market and our colonies, and though they had a monopoly of those\r\nmarkets, it was at the cost of exclusion (on account of higher price)\r\nfrom all other markets.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this monopoly, the silk manufacturers could never\r\ncommand at any time larger _profits_ than other trades; for had they\r\ndone so, competition would have increased until the rate was reduced to\r\nthe common level of the country: on the contrary, the tendency was for\r\nprofits and rates of wages to be smaller than in other great\r\nmanufacturing branches, requiring equal capital and skill; because, with\r\nthe increasing numbers who belonged to the silk trade,--the sons of\r\nmanufacturers and of weavers, who naturally, in the first instance, look\r\nto the trade of their parents for their occupation,--the trade did not\r\nproportionably increase, from the fact of our being unable to extend our\r\nexports; and, lastly, it was exposed to much greater vicissitudes than\r\nother trades; for when, either from a temporary change of fashion or\r\ntaste, or from a temporary stagnation of trade in this country, the\r\naccustomed demand was lessened, the silk manufacturers were unable to\r\nobtain any relief by extending their trade in the great neutral markets\r\nof the world, being excluded by price, and the whole surplus quantity\r\nremained a dead weight on this market only; whereas other branches of\r\nmanufactures, practically enjoying no protection, in the case of\r\ndepressed trade at home, had an opportunity of immediate relief, by\r\nspreading the surplus thereby created, at a very trifling sacrifice,\r\nover the wide markets which they supplied.\r\n\r\nIn this way the extent and duration of the vicissitudes and depressions\r\nin the silk trade were without parallel in any other; but since 1824,\r\nsince this trade has been placed in a natural position by the removal of\r\nmonopoly, the whole aspect of it has changed, and these peculiar evils\r\nhave all disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen again with regard to the products of land, which the law attempts\r\nto protect more highly than any other. Here again, though the price to\r\nthe community is maintained much above the prices of other countries, no\r\none person connected with raising the produce can command a higher rate\r\nof profit, or higher wages for labour, than other trades having no\r\nprotection whatever; for if they did, competition would soon reduce them\r\nto the same level; but, on the contrary, the wages, of agricultural\r\nlabourers, and the profits of farmers, are always rather below than\r\nabove the common rate, and simply from this fact, that the children of\r\nfarm labourers, and of farmers, who first naturally look to the pursuits\r\nof their parents for a trade or occupation, increase in numbers without\r\nany corresponding extension of the means of employment, and the\r\ncompetition among them is therefore always greater than in other trades\r\nwhich have the power of extension; and the vicissitudes to which the\r\nfarmer is exposed are notoriously greater than any other trade. His rent\r\nand expenses throughout are fixed by an artificial price of produce,\r\nwhich price can only be maintained as long as a certain scarcity exists;\r\nbut the moment the markets are plentifully supplied, either from a want\r\nof demand owing to a depression of trade, or from the result of a good\r\nharvest, he finds that plenty takes out of his hand all control of\r\nprice, which quickly sinks to the natural rate.\r\n\r\nWith a free trade the farmer would never be exposed to such reverses. In\r\nthat state, if the demand and price increased, it would be checked by an\r\nincrease of imports from other countries; if the demand and price\r\ndiminished, that would also be checked by a reduction or cessation of\r\nthe usual imports, and, if necessary, by an export of any surplus which\r\npressed upon the market;--and, if our space allowed, it would not be\r\ndifficult to show that, with prices at the natural rate, all parties\r\nconnected with land would not only be in a safer but a much better\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nNo cautious man who well understands the subject will ever hazard his\r\ncapital in any trade exposed to so many evils and to so much uncertainty\r\nas restriction and protection infallibly introduce into it:--but the\r\ngreat error which misleads all men in cherishing such trades is, that\r\nthey mistake _high prices_ for _high profits_, which usually, instead of\r\nbeing synonymous terms, are quite the reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\nON THE INDICATIONS WHICH ARE GUIDES IN JUDGING OF THE FERTILITY OR\r\nBARRENNESS OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. WILLIAM THORP.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from No. 2._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese three signs, viz., colour, consistence, and vegetation, are named\r\nby the Royal Agricultural Society as being pre-eminently indications of\r\nthe value of lands; yet there are others of equal if not of greater\r\nconsequence. For example:--\r\n\r\n_A knowledge of the geology of the land_ is of the first importance;\r\nthat is, not only a knowledge of the range and extent of each formation\r\nand its subdivisions, which may be called geographical geology, but also\r\nhow far and to what extent the various lands do depend upon the\r\nsubstratum for their soil, and the local variations in the chemical or\r\nmineralogical character of the substrata themselves, and which may be\r\ncalled the differential geology of soils. For not only do the qualities\r\nof land vary from one formation to another, but upon the same formation\r\nthere is frequently considerable difference in the quality of land\r\ndepending upon chemical difference in the substratum, or upon an\r\nintermixture of foreign debris derived from other strata.\r\n\r\n_A chemical investigation_ of the soil and subsoil will frequently\r\nafford most useful indications respecting the value of land. It may be\r\nlaid down as an axiom that a soil to be fertile must contain all the\r\nchemical ingredients which a plant can only obtain from the soil, and\r\nchemistry ought to be able to inform us in unproductive soils what\r\ningredients are wanting. It also is able to inform us if any poisonous\r\nsubstance exists in the soil, and how it may be neutralized; when lime,\r\nmarl, and chalk are to be used, &c.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Agricultural Society say that chemistry is unable to explain\r\nthe productiveness of soils. But why is it unable? One reason is, that\r\nsupposing everything required by the plant to be present in the soil,\r\nyet if the soil be either too wet, or too dry, too cohesive, or loose,\r\nthe plant will not flourish; and chemical analysis does not declare\r\nthis, for it affords no information respecting the mechanical division\r\nin which substances exist in the soil. Again, the chemical analysis of\r\nsoils, to be worth anything, must be conducted with more rigid accuracy\r\nthan those published by English writers. To detect one cwt. of gypsum in\r\nan acre there would be only one quarter of a grain in a pound of soil,\r\nor in 100 grains only three and a half thousandth of a grain (35/10000\r\nor,00035 grs.), or to discover if sufficient alumina existed in a field\r\nfor the production of red clover there must be ascertained if it\r\ncontained (one hundred thousandth),00001 per cent. The analyses even by\r\nSprengel do not afford us the quantity of nitrogen in each soil, or the\r\ncapacity of the soil for this substance; while it is well known that\r\nmost manures, as well as the different kinds of food, are valuable in\r\nproportion to the quantity contained by them, and it is highly probable,\r\n_ceteris paribus_, that the quantity of nitrogen found existing in soil,\r\nand the soil's capacity for containing that substance, would afford an\r\neasy indication of its immediate fertility, and also of its requiring\r\ngreat or small quantities of nitrogenous manures in its future\r\ncultivation.[2]\r\n\r\nChemistry, however, outsteps her province when it is attempted to\r\nexplain how vegetable productions are formed in the plants by chemical\r\nforces; for the recent discoveries of Schwann, Henle, and Schleiden,\r\nprove that all the functions of the plant are performed by the means of\r\nsimple vesicles and cells--that absorption, assimilation, fixation of\r\ncarbon from the atmosphere, respiration, exhalation, secretion, and\r\nreproduction are all effected by single cells, of which the lower plants\r\nalmost entirely consist--that the cell absorbs alimentary matters\r\nthrough the spongioles of the root, and that the fluid received thus\r\nundergoes the first steps of the organizing process--that the inorganic\r\nelements are changed into the simplest proximate principles by cells--so\r\nalso are the further changes into the regular secretions of the plant,\r\nthe result of cell-life--that gum and sugar are converted into the\r\norganizable portion of the nutritious sap by the cells of the leaves.\r\nThe starchy fluid in the grains of corn is rendered capable of nutrition\r\nto the embryo by the development of successive generations of cells,\r\nwhich exert upon it their peculiar vitalizing influence. Albumen is\r\nconverted into fibrine by the vital agency of cell life--_i.e._, cells\r\nare produced which do not form an integral part of any permanent\r\nstructure in the plant, but which, after attaining a certain maturity,\r\nreproduce themselves and disappear; hence it may be stated that all the\r\nvegetable productions which are formed in the plant are effected by a\r\nseries of vital actions through the agency of cells.\r\n\r\nFrom the different transformations which these undergo all the different\r\ntissues in vegetables are formed; for instance, the spiral and dotted\r\nducts, woody fibre, and so on. Schwann showed that the formation of\r\ntissues in animals went through exactly the same progress, a fact which\r\nhas been confirmed by the microscopic observations of Valentin and\r\nBarry. Thus vessels, glands, the brain, nerves, muscles, and even bones\r\nand teeth are all formed from metamorphosed cells. Dr Bennett says--\"If\r\nthis be true, and there can be little doubt, it obliges us to modify our\r\nnotions of organization and life. It compels us to confess that\r\nvegetables and animals are not simple beings, but composed of a greater\r\nor less number of individuals, of which thousands may exist in a mass\r\nnot larger than a grain of sand, each having a vital centre and separate\r\nlife, independent of those around it. Each of these individuals, or\r\norganized cells, should be regarded as a living being, which has its\r\nparticular vital centre of absorption, assimilation, and growth, and\r\nwhich continues to vegetate, to increase, and undergo transformations as\r\nif it were an isolated individual. At all events, a knowledge of the\r\nexistence of the cell-life of plants will explain several phenomena\r\nrespecting the vegetation, growth, and ripening of corn, and may\r\nhereafter lead to some valuable practical results.\"\r\n\r\n_The climate, elevation, and exposure_ are not to be neglected. Upon the\r\nhigher portions of the Wolds crops suffer, much from elevation and\r\nexposure, while in the western portion of Yorkshire, upon the moor\r\nedges, the harvest is usually a month later than in the central parts of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n_A moderate depth_ of soil in general is a favourable sign, although\r\nsome of shallow soils on the new red sandstone and on the Wolds are very\r\ngood; to these signs are to be added locality, as respects markets,\r\nfacilities of obtaining a supply of lime, or other tillage, the rates\r\nand outpayments peculiar to the district, &c. &c., all of which are to\r\nbe taken into account when considering the value of any particular farm.\r\n\r\nI shall now briefly apply these indications of fertility over the\r\ndifferent geological formations of Yorkshire, and it will be found that\r\neach lends aid to the other, and that a person will be able to ascertain\r\nthe value of land in proportion as he is able to appreciate the\r\ncollective evidence afforded by them.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mr Brakenridge, of Bretton Lodge, who has extensive practice in land\r\nvaluing, informs me that a mechanical analysis of the soil affords him\r\nmuch assistance; and he has found that in soils, whenever free from\r\nstagnant water, that in a mechanical analysis the larger the proportion\r\nwhich remains suspended in the water, the greater its powers of\r\nproduction will be found, and the less manure it will require. That the\r\nbest soils are those which, when diffused and well stirred in water and\r\nallowed to stand for three minutes, from 20 to 30, say 25, per cent. is\r\ncarried off with the water of decantation. When 30 per cent. and upwards\r\nis decanted off, the soil becomes retentive of water and consequently\r\nwet. When less than 20 per cent., say only 16 per cent. and under, is\r\ncarried off, it becomes too porous; water passes through it too rapidly;\r\nits soluble matter is washed off into the substratum, and it has a\r\nstrong tendency to become thin and sterile.\r\n\r\n[2] The celebrated black earth of Russia contains 2,45 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT AND ARISTOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen and Prince Albert, on their return on Thursday week from the\r\nChateau d'Eu, were accompanied by the Prince de Joinville, who remained\r\nto dine with the Royal party, and then returned in the evening on board\r\nhis yacht, for the coast of France. After a few days' repose, her\r\nMajesty and the Prince started on another marine excursion. They sailed\r\nfrom Brighton on Tuesday morning, passed Dover, and arrived off Deal\r\nabout three o'clock, where the Royal yacht anchored, in order to receive\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, who came from Walmer Castle, and dined with her\r\nMajesty on board, a large number of vessels, gaily decked with flags, as\r\nwell as crowds on shore, giving animation to the scene. The Duke\r\nremained with her Majesty and Prince Albert upwards of two hours, and\r\nduring the time he was on board, the wind, which throughout the day had\r\nbeen blowing rather fresh from the northward and eastward, had\r\nconsiderably increased, and her Majesty, upon the Duke's taking his\r\nleave, evinced very great anxiety respecting the safe landing of his\r\nGrace. Everybody who knows this coast is aware that when the wind is\r\nblowing at all from the eastward that there is a very heavy surf on the\r\nbeach, and consequently great difficulty in landing. His Grace, however,\r\non thanking her Majesty for the concern she evinced on his account, made\r\nlight of the matter, and returned on board the _Ariel_, which brought\r\nhim as near the shore as possible; here he got into the barge and rowed\r\ntowards the beach. The swell was too great to admit of his landing at\r\nthe pier, from which he had started, and the boat was pulled towards the\r\nnaval yard, where the surf was not so great as at any other part of the\r\nshore. Here the Duke landed, but not without a thorough drenching, for\r\nno sooner had the bows of the boat touched the shore than a heavy sea\r\nbroke right over her stern, and completely saturated his Grace's\r\napparel. The Duke, upon landing, all wet as he was, immediately mounted\r\nhis horse, and rode off to Walmer Castle. A numerous assemblage of\r\npersons had congregated on the beach when the Duke came on shore, and\r\nloudly and enthusiastically cheered him.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour on Wednesday morning the squadron got their steam up,\r\nand made preparations for taking their departure. The weather had\r\nmoderated, and the day was fine. About seven o'clock the Royal yacht got\r\nunder way, and stood out to sea, and was followed by the other steamers,\r\nand also by the _Penelope_, which had been ordered to form one of the\r\nRoyal squadron.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock on Wednesday the Royal yacht entered the port of\r\nOstend, taking the authorities somewhat by surprise, who did not expect\r\nit quite so soon. The King and Queen of Belgium, and the official\r\npersonages of Ostend, were, however, on the pier to await the landing;\r\nand the populace displayed the most lively enthusiasm. In the evening\r\nthere was a grand banquet at the Hotel de Ville, and Ostend was\r\nbrilliantly illuminated, in a style far surpassing ordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF HANOVER.--A correspondent writes that his Majesty, while in\r\nconversation with a noble friend, expressed the determination, should\r\nDivine Providence spare him health, to visit this country again next\r\nsummer, and he purposed then to come earlier in the season.\r\n\r\nVISIT OF THE REGENT OF SPAIN TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.--On Wednesday, about\r\ntwelve o'clock, General Espartero paid a visit to the Royal Hospital at\r\nGreenwich.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel arrived in town by the London and Birmingham Railway on\r\nSaturday afternoon, from his seat, Drayton Manor, Staffordshire, and\r\nimmediately proceeded from the Euston-square terminus to the residence\r\nof the Earl of Aberdeen, in Argyll street, to pay a visit to his\r\nlordship. Soon, after the arrival of the Right Hon. Baronet, Sir James\r\nGraham arrived in Argyll street from the Home office, and had an\r\ninterview with Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nSir R. Peel left his colleagues at a quarter-past four o'clock for the\r\nterminus at London bridge, and travelled by the London and Brighton\r\nRailway to Brighton, to dine with her Majesty and Prince Albert,\r\nremaining at the Pavilion, on a visit to her Majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC AND MUSICALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANCHESTER MUSICAL FESTIVAL.--This great festival--one of the greatest\r\nand finest musical events that ever occurred in Manchester--was held in\r\nthe magnificent hall of the Anti-Corn-law League, the length of which is\r\n135 feet, the breadth 102 feet, inclosing an area of about 14,000 square\r\nfeet. The services of all our principal vocal artists were secured. The\r\n_soprani_ were Miss Clara Novello and Miss Rainforth; the _alto_ or\r\n_mezzo soprano_, Mrs Alfred Shaw; the _tenori_, Mr Braham and Mr James\r\nBennett; and the _basso_, Mr Henry Phillips. The choir was the most\r\ncomplete and efficient one ever collected in Manchester, and consisted\r\nof nearly the whole of the vocal members of the Manchester Choral\r\nSociety and the Hargreaves Choral Society, with some valuable additions\r\nfrom the choirs of Bury and other neighbouring towns, and from gentlemen\r\namateurs, conversant with Handel. The _Messiah_ was the performance of\r\nMonday night; and, on the whole, was executed in a style worthy of that\r\ngreat work of art, the conductor being Sir Henry Bishop, who wore his\r\nrobes as a musical bachelor of the University of Oxford. On Tuesday\r\nthere was a grand miscellaneous concert, the hall being even more\r\nnumerously attended than on the preceding evening, there not being fewer\r\nthan 3,500 persons present. This went off with very great satisfaction\r\nto the very numerous auditory; and the _Manchester Guardian_ says, \"As\r\nto the general impression produced by this festival, we believe we do\r\nnot err in saying that there is but one opinion,--that it has been\r\nthroughout an eminently successful experiment. Sir Henry Bishop, we\r\nunderstand, said that he never heard choruses sung with better effect in\r\nhis life; and that he considered the festival, as a musical performance,\r\nmost creditable to every one connected with it. As to the capabilities\r\nof the hall for singing, we are informed that Miss Clara Novello has\r\ndeclared that she never sang with more ease in any place in her life;\r\nand we think the ease with which she did sing was obvious to all who\r\ncould see her countenance. We have asked many persons who sat in\r\ndifferent parts of the hall, especially in distant corners, and all\r\nconcur in saying that they heard most distinctly Miss Novello's softest\r\nand faintest notes.\"\r\n\r\nMUSICAL INTELLIGENCE.--Rubini is about to establish an opera at St\r\nPetersburg, and has engaged his old colleague, Tamburini, to assist him\r\nin the enterprize. He has also engaged Signor Pisani, a young tenor of\r\ngreat promise. Lablache will not appear at the opening of the Italian\r\nOpera in Paris. He has gone to Naples, where he will remain for two\r\nmonths, and where he is to be joined by his son-in-law, Thalberg. A\r\ngrand musical festival, which was to have taken place in Paris on\r\nThursday next, has been postponed till the beginning of October. It is\r\nsaid that this festival will rival those of Germany in splendour.\r\n\r\nThe Hereford Musical Festival, which was held on Tuesday, Wednesday, and\r\nThursday, in All Saints Church, in consequence of the repairs going on\r\nat the cathedral, was on a much smaller scale than of late years has\r\nbeen usual with the three choirs, and the attendances at the various\r\nperformances were by no means so numerous as had been generally\r\nexpected; still, as the expenses had been studiously kept down, it is to\r\nbe hoped the receipts may cover them, or nearly so. The collections\r\nafter the three services amounted to 865_l._, being 200_l._ less than in\r\n1840, but 50_l._ more than in 1837.--_Cheltenham Looker-on._\r\n\r\nRossini has just left Paris without its having been possible to procure\r\na note from him. Every effort has been fruitless. Unwilling to hear one\r\nword said of music, Rossini has not even been to the Opera. He is\r\nreturning to Bologna, cured of a painful disease by Doctor Civiale, who,\r\nwith reason, seemed to him a far more important personage than Duprez.\r\nIt is said that Rossini replied to the great tenor, who asked him for a\r\npart, \"I have come too early, and you too late.\"--_French print._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALDERMANIC GOWN OF BREAD-STREET WARD.--It is supposed that there\r\nwill be a hard contest for the Aldermanic Gown of Bread street, vacant\r\nby the resignation of Alderman Lainson, who on Thursday last addressed a\r\nletter to the Lord Mayor, announcing his determination to retire, in\r\nconsequence of ill health.\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.--The works are now about to commence in good\r\nearnest for forming Victoria Park. Great progress is being made by the\r\nCommissioners of the Metropolis Improvements in the formation of the new\r\nstreet at the West-end. The new street leading from Oxford street to\r\nHolborn has been marked out by the erection of poles along the line.\r\nLast week several houses were disposed of by auction, for the purpose of\r\nbeing taken down. Some delay has arisen in respect to the purchase of\r\nthe houses which have formed the locality known as Little Ireland. Among\r\nthe buildings to be removed is the chapel situated at the top of\r\nPlumtree street. In this street the whole of the houses on the west side\r\nwill be shortly removed, for the new street which will lead from\r\nWaterloo bridge. In Belton street, in the line for this intended street,\r\nthe inmates of several houses received notice to quit yesterday. The\r\noccupiers of the several houses forming the clump at the end of Monmouth\r\nstreet, in Holborn, have also received similar notices. Similar progress\r\nhas been made with the new street communicating between Coventry street\r\nand Long acre. The line has been cleared from Castle street to Long Acre\r\non the east. On the west side the inmates of the houses, it is expected,\r\nwill in a few days have notice to quit. Improvements will also be made\r\nbetween Long acre and St Giles's; and in Upper St Martin's lane the\r\nwhole of the houses on the west side will be removed, the greater part\r\nof which are already taken down.\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE MODEL PRISON.--The commissioners appointed to superintend\r\nthe management of the Pentonville Prison have just presented their\r\nreport for the approval of the Secretary of State. The report states,\r\nthat it is the intention of the Secretary of State to appropriate the\r\nprison to the reception of convicts between eighteen and thirty-five\r\nyears, under sentence of transportation not exceeding fifteen years; and\r\nthat the convicts so selected shall undergo a term of probationary\r\ndiscipline for eighteen months in the prison, when they will be removed\r\nto Van Diemen's land under their original sentences.\r\n\r\nRETURNS OF THE ROYAL MINT.--The Master of the Mint has issued his annual\r\nreturn of the work done in the refinery of the Mint, and of the assays\r\nmade during the past year on other accounts than those of Government,\r\nand of public and private bodies, in conformity with an order of the\r\nhouse on a motion made by Mr Hume. The return estimates the amount of\r\nbullion refined in the year 1842, under this head, at 940 lbs 0 oz. 19\r\ndwts. of gold, and 24,376 lbs. 11 oz. of silver, the amount received by\r\nthe refiner being about 600_l._ The number of assays made in the same\r\nperiod is put down at 2,158, at a rate of charge of 2s. for each assay.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE LAW.--It may be interesting at this season, when so many\r\npersons who are out of town have their letters forwarded to them in the\r\ncountry, to see the answer to an inquiry whether a letter forwarded\r\nafter delivery at one address to another in the country is liable to\r\nsecond postage:--\"General Post office, Sept. 7, 1843.--Sir,--I am\r\ncommanded by the Postmaster-General to inform you, in reply to your\r\ncommunication of the 29th ultimo, that a letter re-directed from one\r\nplace to another is legally liable to additional postage for the further\r\nservice. I am, Sir, &c. &c.\"\r\n\r\nSINGULAR EMPLOYMENT OF THE POLICE.--Under an order recently issued by\r\nthe commissioners of the metropolitan police, a number of the officers\r\nof each division have been actively engaged in collecting information\r\nand making out a return of all new houses completed since the year 1830,\r\nin which year the police force was established; all new houses commenced\r\nbut not finished; all new churches, new chapels, new schools, and other\r\npublic buildings; all new streets and squares formed since that period,\r\nwith their names and the name of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITARY STATE OF LIVERPOOL.--A Mr Henry Laxton has published a very\r\nthin pamphlet, in the shape of a letter to Dr Lyon Playfair, who has\r\nbeen appointed, under the commission of inquiry, to examine and report\r\nupon the unhealthy state of Liverpool. But though Mr Laxton's pamphlet\r\nis very small, it exposes evils too complicated and large to be remedied\r\nwithout vigorous, continuous, steadily-applied exertion. Groups of\r\nhouses packed together, with scarcely room for the inhabitants to stir;\r\nopen cesspools continually sending up their poisonous exhalations, and\r\nin hot or wet weather so infesting the air as to render it almost\r\ninsupportable; smoke from the factories and steam-vessels, which, when\r\nthe wind is westerly, covers the town, blackening the buildings, soiling\r\ngoods, and, mixing with the other gases already generated, forming one\r\ngeneral conglomeration of deleterious vapours; the state of the\r\ninhabited cellars; the neighbourhood of which exhibits scenes of\r\nbarbarism disgraceful for any civilised state to allow; an inefficient\r\nsupply of that great necessity of life--water; inefficient drainage,\r\nwhich is only adapted to carry off the surface water;--these are but a\r\nsample of the general state of Liverpool, and at the same time very\r\ndistinct and efficient causes of its excessive mortality.\r\n\r\nSHEFFIELD.--It is now understood that there will be no immediate vacancy\r\nfor Sheffield, and that both Mr Ward and Mr Parker will retain their\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nHENRY DAMAR, ESQ.--The _Dorset Chronicle_ publishes a long account of\r\nthe festivities which took place at Milton Abbey, in Dorsetshire, on the\r\n5th instant, on the occasion of the coming of age of the proprietor,\r\nHenry Damar, Esq.\r\n\r\nPROPOSED PUBLIC MEETING IN BIRMINGHAM.--On Monday a deputation waited on\r\nthe Mayor of Birmingham, with the requisition requesting him to call a\r\npublic meeting to petition the Queen to dismiss her present ministers.\r\nThe requisition was signed by nearly one thousand merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, and shopkeepers of the town. There was not the name of a\r\nworking man attached to it. The mayor, however, declined calling the\r\nmeeting, observing, that although he might not act in accordance with\r\nthe wishes of many most respectable individuals in the town, he had made\r\nup his mind not to call the meeting.\r\n\r\nATTENDANCE OF THE LANCASHIRE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THE\r\nSESSION OF 1843.--The total number of divisions in the House of Commons,\r\nduring the session of 1843, was 220, in which there voted--\r\n\r\n                                                      Times.\r\n  1.

We understand that Messrs Acroyd were insured to the extent\r\nof six or seven thousand pounds, but that the loss considerably exceeds\r\nthat amount.\r\n\r\nCHESTER CHEESE FAIR.--At this fair on Wednesday last, the first of the\r\nseason for this year's make, about 200 tons of new cheese were piled for\r\nsale. Early in the morning several dairies went off briskly, but as the\r\nday advanced sales became heavy. Prices ranged from 40s. to 50s. per\r\ncwt., according to quality. We hear that the make this season has been\r\nabove an average one.\r\n\r\nNEW COLLEGE, NEAR OXFORD.--A correspondent states that it is intended to\r\nestablish at Littlemore, near Oxford, a college, in which young men\r\nholding Tractarian views may be trained for missionary labour in\r\nconnexion with the established church. The Right Rev. Dr Coleridge,\r\nformerly Bishop of Barbadoes, will be the principal of the institution.\r\n\r\nCHATHAM.--A general Court-martial was held on Wednesday, the 6th inst.,\r\nin the General Court-martial-room, Chatham Barracks, for the purpose of\r\ntrying Lieutenant J. Piper, of the 26th Cameronian Regiment. The trial\r\nlasted four days, terminating on Saturday, the 9th inst. The charges\r\nalleged ungentlemanly and improper conduct. The prisoner's defence being\r\nclosed, the Court broke up. The sentence of the Court will not be known\r\nuntil the evidence has been laid before the Commander-in-Chief at the\r\nHorse Guards. The prisoner is about 26 years of age. The trial excited\r\nthe greatest interest throughout the garrison.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there are at present upwards of 2,000 visitors\r\ncongregated at Harrogate; and all the other watering places in the north\r\nof England, Scarborough, Seaton, Carew, Redcar, Tynemouth, Shotley\r\nbridge, Gilsland, as well as the lakes, are teeming with gay and\r\nrespectable company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPEAL ASSOCIATION.--On Monday the usual weekly meeting of the Repeal\r\nAssociation was held at the Corn Exchange, Dublin. The week's \"rent\"\r\namounted to 735_l._, of which 1_l._ was from Mr Baldwin, a paper\r\nmanufacturer of Birmingham, who is of opinion that Ireland would be of\r\ngreater benefit to England with a domestic legislature than she was at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nREPEAL MEETINGS.--A repeal meeting was held on Sunday last at Loughrea,\r\na town in the county of Galway, about ninety miles from Dublin. It was\r\nattended by Mr O'Connell, who as it was raining in torrents, addressed\r\nthe people from under the shelter of an umbrella. Amongst other things\r\nin his speech, he said,--\"Believe me, my friends, that if you follow my\r\nadvice, the day is not far distant when you shall have your Parliament\r\nrestored in Ireland. I am working the plan out. I have it in detail. I\r\nwill have this protective society of 300 sitting before Christmas, and I\r\nhope to be able to give you, as a new year's gift, a Parliament in\r\nCollege green. (Cheers.) People of Ireland, you deserve it. Brave,\r\nnoble-minded people of Ireland, you deserve it. Faithful, religious,\r\nmoral, temperate people of Ireland, you deserve to be a nation, and you\r\nshall be a nation. (Much cheering.) The Saxon stranger shall not rule\r\nyou. Ireland shall belong to the Irish, and the Irish shall have\r\nIreland.\" (Hurrah.) There was a dinner in the evening, at which about\r\n400 persons were present.\r\n\r\nBRANDING OF ARMS IN IRELAND.--Government has entered into a contract\r\nwith Mr Grubb, the scientific and very able mechanist of the Bank of\r\nIreland, for the construction of the machine intended to be used in\r\nmarking the arms under the new law--they are not to be subjected to the\r\noperation of punching, still less, as some strangely supposed, to the\r\nnotion of fire. The letters, or figures, will be marked by cutting; and,\r\nso simple and ingenious is the method employed, that the most unskilful\r\nworkman, even an ordinary person unpractised in any trade, can effect\r\nthe process with the most perfect ease. Four figures and two letters are\r\nexpected to suffice for designating the county or riding of a county,\r\nand the number of the piece; the time occupied in the engraving will be\r\none minute. The expense will be extremely moderate; the cost of each\r\nmachine being, we understand, only twenty-five guineas, one-half of\r\nwhich, by law, will be defrayed out of the consolidated fund, the other\r\nhalf by the county.--_Evening Mail._\r\n\r\nSCENE AT THE PHOENIX PARK.--An extraordinary scene took place on\r\nSaturday, at the Viceregal Lodge, between the military on duty and a\r\nperson named Thomas Campbell, who is, it would appear, insane. Thomas\r\nCampbell, it appears, is a very powerful young man, about thirty years\r\nof age, and a native of the North road, Drogheda. At the lodge, in the\r\nPhoenix Park, he asked to see the Lord Lieutenant; but, being armed\r\nwith a pitchfork and a hammer, he was not considered an eligible\r\nvisitor, and after a desperate struggle with the guard, whom he kept at\r\nbay, he was knocked down and secured by a police constable.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Tuesday of the Repeal Association, adjourned over from\r\nMonday, was enlivened by the presence of Mr O'Connell, without whom all\r\nits proceedings would be \"stale, flat, and unprofitable.\" It again\r\nadjourned till Wednesday; and, on that day, Mr O'Connell read an address\r\nto the people of Great Britain, setting forth the grievances of the\r\npeople of Ireland. After the reading of this document, which is long,\r\nand certainly ably drawn up, the association adjourned till Monday.\r\n\r\nMILITARY DEFENCES.--Before the winter sets in every barrack in Ireland\r\nwill be in a state of defence, fit to hold out against an insurgent\r\nassault. In fact, everything will be prepared, excepting the\r\ninsurrectionary force; and certainly there does not at present appear to\r\nbe much chance that the strength of the fortifications will be tested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREPEAL DEMONSTRATION IN LIVERPOOL.--Some days ago public announcements\r\nwere made that two days' \"demonstration\" would be made in this town, in\r\nfavour of the repeal of the union, and that Mr Daniel O'Connell, jun.,\r\nyoungest son of the Liberator, and one or two others of inferior note\r\nwould attend. The meeting took place on Tuesday night last, in the\r\nAmphitheatre, which was crowded, by not less than between 3,000 and\r\n4,000 persons. Shortly after the doors were opened it appeared evident\r\nthat a considerable body of Orangemen were dispersed in different parts,\r\nfrom partial sounds of the \"Kentish fire,\" and other circumstances. Mr\r\nO'Connell, and the gentlemen accompanying him, arrived about half-past\r\nseven, and the chair was taken by Mr James Lennon, who was described as\r\nan \"Inspector of Repeal Wardens in Liverpool.\" He delivered a short\r\nspeech in favour of repeal, during which he was repeatedly interrupted\r\nby the Orangemen, and some confusion followed.--Mr Fitzgerald moved the\r\nfirst resolution, which was supported by Mr Daniel O'Connell, jun. His\r\nretirement was the signal for the commencement of an uproar which almost\r\ndefies description. There appeared an evident determination that the\r\nproceedings should be stopped; for fights commenced in different parts,\r\nmany of the benches were torn up, and a sort of attack was made upon the\r\nstage by a few Orangemen who were in the pit. The police were very\r\nactive in endeavouring to secure the assailants, several of whom were\r\nseriously hurt; and a few of them having been removed from the building,\r\norder was eventually restored, and, with a few trifling exceptions, it\r\nwas preserved to the end of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nThe working of the measure of the past session, denominated the Church\r\nof Scotland Benefices Act, will soon be tested, and is now undergoing\r\nthe ordeal of proof, in consequence of objections lodged by the\r\nparishioners of Banff, with the presbytery of Fordyce, against the\r\npresentation, induction, and translation of the Rev. George Henderson,\r\nnow incumbent of the church and parish of Cullen, to the cure and\r\npastoral charge of the church and parish of Banff.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr Grant, formerly parochial minister of Banff, ceased to hold\r\nhis _status_ in the Established Church of Scotland, having signed the\r\nfamous deed of secession, and voluntarily resigned his living with his\r\nbrethren of the non-intrusion clergy. A large portion of his\r\ncongregation left the establishment along with him, and a free church is\r\nnow in course of being built for their accommodation. The patronage of\r\nthe vacant benefice is in the gift of the Earl of Seafield. The Rev. Mr\r\nHenderson, of Cullen, has accepted the presentation to the parish church\r\nof Banff.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for \"moderating on the call,\" very few names were\r\ngiven in, in favour of the presentee, and the presbytery having fixed a\r\nday for receiving objections, a series of reasons and objections was\r\nlodged in the hands of that reverend body, and published at length in\r\nthe _Aberdeen Herald_, against proceeding with the collation of Mr\r\nHenderson. The objections are set forth under no less than fourteen\r\ndifferent heads. \"The approaches and manners\" of the reverend gentleman\r\nare not considered such \"as to attach and endear his congregation to\r\nhim.\" He is reported to be subject \"to an occasional exuberance of\r\nanimal spirits, and at times to display a liveliness of manner and\r\nconversation which would be repugnant to the feelings of a large portion\r\nof the congregation of Banff.\" Others of the objections assert, that his\r\nillustrations in the pulpit do not bear upon his text--that his subjects\r\nare incoherent and ill deduced; and the reverend gentleman is also\r\ncharged with being subject to a natural defect of utterance--a defect\r\nwhich it is said increases as he \"extends his voice,\" which is of a\r\n\"very harsh and grating description,\" and renders it difficult to hear\r\nor follow what he says in the church of Banff, which we are informed \"is\r\nvery large, and peculiarly constructed, with an unusually high pulpit,\r\nto suit the high galleries;\" and moreover, \"the said Rev. George\r\nHenderson is considered to be destitute of a musical ear, which prevents\r\nthe correct modulation of his voice!\"\r\n\r\nARGYLLSHIRE ELECTION.--- The election of a member of Parliament for the\r\ncounty of Argyll, in the room of Alexander Campbell, Esq., of Monzie,\r\nwho has accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, took place at Inverary on Friday\r\nweek. The Lord Advocate (Mr Duncan M'Neill), the only candidate in the\r\nfield, was accompanied to the hustings by a great number of the county\r\ngentlemen; and no other candidate having been brought forward, a show of\r\nhands was consequently taken, which being perfectly unanimous, he was,\r\nof course, declared duly elected.--_Glasgow Saturday Post._\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr Shaw Lefevre, has been on a\r\nvisit at Glenquoich, the shooting quarters of Edward Ellice, Esq., M.P.,\r\nin this county. The Right Hon. Edward Ellice, M.P. for Coventry, the\r\nBaron James de Rothschild, and other members of the Rothschild family,\r\nwere also at Glenquoich.--_Inverness Courrier._\r\n\r\n\r\nWALES.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances in Wales still continue, though the apprehension of\r\nsome of the rioters who destroyed the Pontardulais gate has had some\r\neffect. The following distressing scene is reported in the _Times_:--\r\n\r\n\"OUTRAGE IN SOUTH WALES.--On the road from Llanelly to Pontardulais, and\r\nwithin five hundred yards of the latter place, is a turnpike-gate called\r\nHendy gate. This gate was kept by an old woman upwards of seventy years\r\nof age, who has received frequent notices that if she did not leave the\r\ngate, her house should be burnt down. About three o'clock on Sunday\r\nmorning, a party of ruffians set fire to the thatch of the toll-house.\r\nThe old woman, on being awakened, ran into the road and to a\r\nneighbouring cottage within twenty yards of the toll-house, shouting to\r\nthe people who lived in it, 'For God's sake to come out and help her to\r\nput out the fire; there was not much.' The occupier of this cottage, a\r\nstout able man, was afraid to go out, and begged the old woman to come\r\ninto his cottage, which she refused, and went back to try and save some\r\nof her furniture. It appears her exclamation had been overheard, for the\r\nvillains returned and set fire to the thatch again. The old woman then\r\nran across the road, and shouted out, 'She knew them;' when the brutes\r\nfired at her, and shot her dead.\"\r\n\r\nAn inquest was held on the body of the unfortunate woman, and the jury\r\nreturned the following astounding verdict:--\"That the deceased died from\r\nthe effusion of blood into the chest, which occasioned suffocation, but\r\nfrom what cause is to this jury unknown.\"\r\n\r\nMeetings of the magistrates, in relation to the turnpike trusts, have\r\nbeen held, and measures taken to mitigate the heaviest tolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe has had a remarkable history; but it has been\r\ndistinguished to an extraordinary degree by its vicissitudes, amongst\r\nwhich we must not forget his involuntary exile, and his residence in\r\nthis country, where he lived for many years as Duke of Orleans. A worse\r\nman than his father it would be difficult to imagine. He was a vain,\r\nambitious, and cowardly voluptuary, who gratified his personal passions\r\nat the expense of his sovereign and his country; but his son was reared\r\nin a different school, and to that accident, conjoined with a better\r\nnature, he probably owes the high position which he now occupies as a\r\nEuropean monarch. Misfortune is a stern teacher, and its effects on\r\nLouis Philippe may be exemplified by a little story that was told of him\r\nand Lord Brougham some years ago:--\"I am the most independent crowned\r\nhead in Europe,\" said he, \"and the best fitted for my office of all my\r\nbrethren.\" The praise might be deserved, but it seemed strange to the\r\n_ex_-Chancellor that it should come from his own mouth--he, therefore,\r\nbowed assent, and muttered some complimentary phrases about his\r\nMajesty's judgment, firmness, and the like. \"Pooh, pooh, my lord,\" he\r\nobserved, laughing heartily, \"I do not mean that--I do not mean that,\r\nbut that I can--brush my own boots!\" This was practical philosophy, and\r\nindicated a clear perception of the constitution of modern society,\r\nparticularly on the part of one who is known to be by no means\r\nindifferent to the fortunes of his race. We believe, also, that Louis\r\nPhilippe has been happy beyond most men of regal rank in the possession\r\nof an admirable woman for a wife, the present Queen of the French being,\r\nin all respects, a lady of superior intelligence and virtue; properties\r\nwhich are luckily confined to no condition of life, and to no country or\r\ncreed. She has shared in all her husband's troubles during the last\r\neventful forty years, and now adorns that throne which the exigencies of\r\nthe times demanded that he should fill if the French monarchy was to be\r\npreserved. Her attention to her children has been unremitting, and the\r\nresult is, that high though their position be, a more united household\r\nnowhere exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry has been on the point of dissolution. General Serrano,\r\nangered at the contempt shown to his denunciations and lists of\r\nconspirators, by the Home Minister, Caballero, gave in his resignation.\r\nGeneral Serrano demanded the dismissal from Madrid of more suspected\r\npersons. Senors Olozaga and Cortina intervened, however, and made up the\r\nquarrel, ordering the _Gazette_ to declare that the most perfect harmony\r\nreigned in the Cabinet. This the _Gazette_ did. Mr Aston has demanded\r\nhis audience of leave, and quits Madrid on the 15th.\r\n\r\nGrenada has blotted the name of Martinez de la Rosa from its lists of\r\ncandidates, though he had formerly been elected for that place. M.\r\nToreno is expected at Madrid. Senor Olozaga sets out for Paris, to try\r\nand persuade Christina to be patient, for that her presence previous to\r\nthe elections would rather militate against her party.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid the anniversary of the revolution of 1840, which drove Queen\r\nChristina from the Regency, was celebrated by a _Te Deum_, chanted in\r\nthe church of San Isidro, on the 1st, and at which assisted the\r\nAyuntamiento and provincial deputation.\r\n\r\nBarcelona has been in open insurrection, and a sanguinary conflict\r\ncommenced on the evening of the 3rd, which continued with intermissions\r\ntill the 6th. Later intelligence stated that the town still held out. On\r\nthe 8th the state of things at Barcelona was nearly the same.\r\n\r\nOne of the great accusations of MM. Prim, Olozaga, and the French party,\r\nagainst the Regent was, that instead of carrying Barcelona and other\r\ntowns by storm, he fired upon them with muskets and with cannon.\r\nGenerals Arbuthnot and Prim have pursued precisely the same course, and\r\nwe see Montjuich again throwing bullets upon Barcelona, and with all\r\nthis making no progress in its reduction.\r\n\r\nAccounts from Barcelona of the 8th, mention that several mansions were\r\ndamaged. Three cannon shots had traversed the apartments of the British\r\nConsul. Prim's own Volunteers of Reus had taken part against him, and\r\nmany of the towns had declared for the Central Junta. A rural Junta of\r\nPrim's had been surprised at Sarria, and several of its members slain.\r\n\r\nA Central Junta had been formed at Girona.\r\n\r\nMadrid letters of the 5th state that Government were about to dismiss a\r\ngreat many superior officers and functionaries opposed to them. The\r\npartisans of Don Francisco have decidedly joined the Esparterists.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA AND ITALY.\r\n\r\nThe _Siècle_ says that Austria was much alarmed at the state of Italy.\r\n\"The necessity which Austria finds to defend her Italian possessions by\r\narms is highly favourable to the projects of Russia against the Danubian\r\nProvinces of the Ottoman empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe _National German Gazette_ of the 8th instant states, that the\r\nfortifications of Verona are being considerably strengthened. The\r\nheights surrounding the town are to be crowned with towers _à la\r\nMontalembert_, so that the city will become one of the strongest\r\nfortresses in Italy. The Hungarian infantry, of which the greater part\r\nare cantoned in Upper Italy, are actively employed in the construction\r\nof the fortifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY.\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE, August 23.--Petroniewitch and Wulchitch have at length\r\nconsented to leave Servia, and are probably at this time in Widin, on\r\ntheir way, it is said, to Constantinople. The province has been confided\r\nto the care of Baron Lieven and M. Vashenko, who are the actual\r\ngovernors. But the most important feature in the question is a note\r\nwhich the ex-Prince Michael has addressed to the Porte. He declares that\r\nthe election of Alexander Kara Georgewitch was brought about by violence\r\nand intimidation, and that he and his ministers are the only faithful\r\nservants of the Porte, and, consequently, the only persons fit to govern\r\nServia.

The betting has been in\r\nfavour of the _Hibernia_, and she has again beaten her great rival. On\r\nTuesday, at midnight, her lights were seen off the port, and at one\r\no'clock she entered the river, after another rapid passage of nine days\r\nfrom Halifax, and eleven from Boston. The news by this arrival is from\r\nNew York to the 31st, Boston to the 1st, and Halifax to the 3rd; sixteen\r\ndays later than previously received by the New York packet ship,\r\n_Liverpool_.\r\n\r\nThe _New York American_, in its summary for the packet, says:--Our\r\ncommercial and money markets continue without sensible change, both\r\nabounding in supply without any corresponding demand. The trade of the\r\ninterior is prosecuted cautiously, and for money in hand.\r\n\r\nPolitical affairs are exceedingly dull and uninteresting; even the Irish\r\nrepeal speakers are quiet.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the pacification between Mexico and Texas, and Mexico\r\nand Yucatan, is slow and somewhat uncertain. The president of Texas,\r\nGeneral Houston, has dismissed Commodore Moore and Captain Sothorp from\r\nthe naval service for disobedience of orders. Indeed, the Texan navy may\r\nbe said to have been disbanded. The people of Galveston thereupon gave\r\nMoore a public dinner, and burnt their president in effigy!

Indeed, people are beginning to complain, and not\r\nwithout reason, of such frequent changes in important offices. For\r\nexample, within three years there have been three Secretaries of State,\r\nthree of War, three of the Treasury, three of the Navy, three\r\nAttorneys-General, and three Postmasters-General. Some of them have\r\nreally not had time to learn their duties, and they have been succeeded\r\nby others who knew still less of the duties and responsibilities of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\nSir C.

One was commanded by a\r\npriest at Castel-Bolognese (district of Ravenna). This state of things\r\ndoes injury to trade and business of every description. The greatest\r\nnumber of depositors have withdrawn their funds from the savings' banks.\r\nA circular has been sent round to all the mayors of the province, giving\r\na description of eight persons, for the arrest of each of whom a sum of\r\n300 crowns (1,700f.) is offered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIES AND EMIGRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMIGRATION DURING THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS.--From a return furnished by\r\nthe Emigration Board, it appears that the number of emigrants from\r\nEngland and Wales, in the seven years from 1825 to 1831, were 103,218,\r\nor an average of 14,745 yearly; in the ten years from 1832 to 1841,\r\n429,775, or 42,977 per annum. Total number in the last seventeen years,\r\n532,993; or an average for that period of 31,352. But the rate of\r\nemigration has greatly increased of late years, as is shown by the fact,\r\nthat while the emigration of the seven years ending 1831 averaged only\r\n14,745 per annum, that of the last ten years (ending 1841) averaged\r\nnearly 43,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nNEW SOUTH WALES.--The monetary and commercial disasters which have\r\nafflicted this important colony are most serious, and they are thus\r\nalluded to by the colonial press:--\"Our next mail to England will carry\r\nhome the tidings of fresh disasters to this once flourishing colony. The\r\nfast growing embarrassments of 1841, and the 600 insolvencies of 1842,\r\nhave been crowned in the first third of the year 1843, by the explosion\r\nof the Bank of Australia, then by the minor explosion of the Sydney\r\nBank, and, last of all, by the run on the Savings Bank. These three\r\nlatter calamities have come in such rapid succession, that before men's\r\nminds recovered from the stunning effect of one shock, they were\r\nastounded by the sudden burst of another; and we are convinced that at\r\nthe present moment there is a deeper despondency and a more harrowing\r\nanticipation of ruin to the colony than ever existed before since the\r\nlanding of Governor Philip, in 1788.\"--The run upon the Savings Bank at\r\nSydney originated, it is said, from malice against Mr George Miller, the\r\naccountant, whose exertions had been very useful in exposing the\r\nmismanagement of the Bank of Australasia. Reports were circulated that\r\nthe Governor had gone suddenly down to the Savings Bank and demanded a\r\nsight of all the bills under discount and mortgages, and that his\r\nExcellency declared that he would not give three straws for all the\r\nsecurities put together; but this statement regarding his Excellency is\r\nflatly contradicted. Many of the largest holders of land and stock in\r\nthe colony are said to be so irretrievably embarrassed, by reason\r\nchiefly of the high prices at which their investments were made, that\r\ntheir property must go to the hammer without reserve. The present time\r\nis, therefore, held out as a favourable opportunity for emigrants, with\r\nmoderate capital, to make their purchases. It is broadly declared that\r\n500_l._ would go as far now in New South Wales, in the purchase of land\r\nand live stock, as would 5,000_l._ four or five years ago.\r\n\r\nAustralia has been, in some respects, unlucky in its colonization. New\r\nSouth Wales has hitherto flourished from its abundant supply of convict\r\nlabour, at the expense of those higher interests which constitute the\r\ntrue strength and security of a state. Western Australia was planted\r\nwith a sound of trumpets and drums, as if another _El Dorado_ were\r\nexpected. But the sudden disaster and discredit into which it fell,\r\nlinked the name of Swan River with associations as obnoxious as those\r\nwhich were once inspired by the South Sea or Missisippi. South\r\nAustralia, again, planned on principles which are universally recognised\r\nas containing the elements of sound and successful colonization, has\r\nalso proved a failure. One of the newest and most enterprising of our\r\nAustralian settlements, that of Port Philip has been sharing with Sydney\r\nin the recent commercial distress and calamity; and though it is already\r\ngetting over its troubles, it must undergo a painful process before it\r\ncan lay an unquestioned claim to its title--Australia Felix. Land\r\njobbing; banking facilities at one time freely afforded, and at another\r\nsuddenly withdrawn; ventures beyond the means of those engaged in them;\r\nimprudent speculations, in which useful capital was either rashly risked\r\nor hopelessly sunk--these unquestionably have been amongst the causes\r\nwhich have brought on the commercial disasters of New South Wales. It is\r\nseldom advantageous for an emigrant, newly arrived, to become a\r\nproprietor of land in any part of Australia, unless his capital be\r\nconsiderable; but the eager desire to become possessed of the soil\r\novercame all prudential considerations; land at Port Philip was eagerly\r\nbought, at prices varying from 12_s._ to 500_l._ In 1840 the influx of\r\nmoneyed immigrants from England and Van Diemen's Land, to a\r\nnewly-discovered and extensive territory, produced a land fund exceeding\r\nthe sum of 300,000_l._, and engagements were entered into by the\r\ncolonial Government, on the faith that the land fund would produce\r\nannually a large amount, but in 1841 it fell down to 81,000_l._; and\r\nthough in 1842 as much as 343_l._ 10_s._ per acre was given for building\r\nground in the town of Brisbane, district of Moreton Bay, it was\r\nimpossible for this to continue; and even for valuable lands in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sydney, in the very same year, wholly inadequate prices\r\nwere obtained. The colonial Government became embarrassed by the\r\nexpenditure exceeding the revenue; and in 1842, Sir George Gipps, in an\r\nofficial despatch, says, \"Pecuniary distress, I regret to state, still\r\nexists to a very great, and even perhaps an increased, degree in the\r\ncolony, though it at present shows itself more among the settlers\r\n(agriculturists or graziers) than the merchants of Sydney. When,\r\nhowever, I consider the vast extent to which persons of the former class\r\nare paying interest, at the rate of from 10 to 15 per cent., on borrowed\r\nmoney, I can neither wonder at their embarrassments, nor hope to see an\r\nend to them, except by the transfer of a large portion of the property\r\nin the colony from the present nominal holders of it to other hands,\r\nthat is to say, into the hands of their mortgagees or creditors, who, in\r\ngreat part, are resident in England.\" This official prophecy is now in\r\nthe act of fulfilment; and when the storm has spent itself, the colony\r\nmay be prosperous again.\r\n\r\nCAPE OF GOOD HOPE.--The want of Government protection which is felt by\r\nthe British resident at the Cape of Good Hope is well illustrated by the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter addressed by the writer to his family at\r\nhome:--\"I am sure I shall be able to get on well in this country if the\r\nCaffres are only prevented from doing mischief, but if they go on in the\r\npresent way, I shall not be able to keep a horse or an ox, both of which\r\nare indispensable to a farmer. Now I can never assure myself that when I\r\nlet my horses go I shall see them again. It is a disgrace to our\r\nGovernment that we are not protected. As it is, all our profits may be\r\nswept away in one night by the marauders.\"\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND.--We understand a box of specie was placed on board the\r\n_Thomas Sparkes_, in charge of the captain, for Mr Chetham. On the owner\r\nopening the box, he discovered to his great surprise that, by some\r\nunaccountable process on the voyage, the money--gold, had been turned\r\ninto one of the baser metals--iron. It is stated that the steward left\r\nat Plymouth, and the first and second mates whilst the vessel was\r\ndetained at the Cape, but whether they had any agency in the\r\ntransmogrification of gold into iron remains to be proved.--_New Zealand\r\nGazette_, Feb. 4, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABORTIVE COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH SPAIN.--Senor Sanchez Silva,\r\nknown for his speeches in the Cortes, as deputy for Cadiz, has\r\npublished, in an address to his constituents, an account of the\r\nnegotiations between the Spanish and British Governments relative to a\r\ntreaty of commerce. The effect of this publication will be to undeceive\r\nthe minds of Spaniards from the idea that the Regent's Government was\r\nabout to sacrifice the interests of Spain, or even of Catalonia, to\r\nEngland. The terms proposed by the Spanish commissioner were, indeed,\r\nthose rather of hard bargainers than of men eager and anxious for a\r\ncommercial arrangement. Senor Silva says that England, in its first\r\nproposals, demanded that its cottons should be admitted into Spain on\r\npaying a duty of 20 per cent., England offering in return to diminish\r\nits duties on Spanish wines, brandies, and dried fruits. But England,\r\nwhich offered in 1838 to reduce by one-third its duty on French wines,\r\ndid not make such advantageous offers to Spain; and the Spanish\r\nnegotiators demanded that 20 per cent. _ad valorem_ should be the limit\r\nof the import duty of Spanish wines and brandies into England, as it was\r\nto be the limit of the duty on English cottons into Spain. This demand\r\nnearly broke off the negotiation, when Spain made new proposals; these\r\nwere to admit English cottons at from 20 to 25 per cent. _ad valorem_\r\nduty, if England would admit Spanish brandies at 50 per cent. _ad\r\nvalorem_ duty, sherry wines at 40 per cent., and other wines at 30 per\r\ncent., exclusive of the excise. Moreover, that tobacco should be\r\nprohibited from coming to Gibraltar, except what was necessary for the\r\nwants of the garrison. The English Government, in a note dated last\r\nmonth, declared the Spanish proposals inadmissible. If the Spanish\r\nGovernment did not admit the other articles of English produce, the duty\r\non Spanish wines could not be reduced. English cottons were an object of\r\nnecessity for the Spanish people, and came in by contraband; whereas\r\nSpanish wines were but an article of luxury for the English. Senor\r\nSanchez Silva concludes, that it is quite useless to renew the\r\nnegotiations, the English note being couched in the terms of an\r\n_ultimatum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE AND ANSWERS TO INQUIRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  London, September 13, 1843.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have read your preliminary number and prospectus, and the first\r\nnumber of your new periodical, the ECONOMIST, and it gives me pleasure\r\nto see the appearance of so able an advocate of free trade, the carrying\r\nout the principles of which is so necessary for the future welfare and\r\nprosperity of the country, and the relief of the distress which is more\r\nor less felt in all the different departments of industry.\r\n\r\nI belong to the class who have their sole dependence in the land, and\r\nhave no direct interest in trade or manufactures; and feel as strong a\r\nwish for the prosperity of agriculture as the Duke of Buckingham, or any\r\nother of the farmer's friends; but I consider the interests of all\r\nclasses of the community so intimately connected, and so mutually\r\ndependent on one another, that no one can rise or prosper upon the ruins\r\nof the others. Like your Northumberland correspondent I am fully\r\nconvinced of the impolicy and inefficiency of \"restrictive corn laws,\"\r\nand of the benefit of \"the free-trade system\" for the relief of the\r\nagricultural, as well as of the manufacturing, the shipping, or any\r\nother interest in the country; and I should also be glad if I could in\r\nany way assist \"in dispelling the errors respecting the corn trade that\r\nhave done so much harm for the last twenty (eight) years.\"\r\n\r\nThe intention of the corn law of 1815 was to prevent the price of wheat\r\nfrom falling below 80s. per quarter; and it was the opinion of farmers\r\nwho were examined on the subject, that less than 80s. or 90s. would not\r\nremunerate the grower, and that if the price fell under these rates, the\r\nwheat soils would be thrown out of cultivation. Prices, however, fell,\r\nand though they have fallen to one half, land has not been thrown out of\r\ncultivation. Various modifications have since been made in the scale of\r\nduties, but always with a view to arrest the falling prices in their\r\ndownward course; but all these legislative attempts have been in vain;\r\nand so far as the farmer trusted to them, they have only misled him by\r\nholding out expectations that have not been realized.\r\n\r\nBut though the corn laws failed in keeping up the price of corn as high\r\nas their framers and supporters wished, they succeeded so far as to\r\nenhance the price of this first necessary of life, and make it perhaps\r\n20 or 30 per cent. dearer than it otherwise would have been to all the\r\nconsumers, even the poorest tradesman or labourer in the country.\r\n\r\nIf the difference which the agriculturists were enabled, by this\r\nmonopoly, to obtain at the expense of the other classes, had all been\r\npure gain, without any drawback, they must have been in a comparatively\r\nflourishing condition; but we find this is not the case, and what is the\r\nreason? Let us hear Sir Robert Peel's answer to the question. In his\r\nspeech in parliament on Mr Villiers's motion, when replying to the\r\naccusations that had been made by Mr Blackstone and other members on his\r\nown side of the house, that he had deceived the agriculturists, as the\r\nGovernment measures, instead of affording them the protection that was\r\npromised, had brought down prices and rendered their situation worse\r\nthan before, Sir Robert says, it was not the Government measures that\r\nhad brought down prices and occasioned the agricultural distress, but\r\nthat this arose from the _condition of the manufacturing districts, and\r\nthe general distress from bad trade and want of employment, which\r\nrendered the people unable to consume_.\r\n\r\nIf this, then, is the true cause of the agricultural distress,--if the\r\ncorn, sugar, and other monopolies are so injurious to the manufacturing\r\nand commercial classes, who are the agriculturists' best, and, indeed,\r\ntheir only customers, as to render them unable to consume, it is not to\r\nclass legislation that we can look for relief. In order to relieve the\r\nagricultural distress there is no other way than to relieve the distress\r\nof those on whom they depend for a market for their productions.\r\n\r\nWere the farmer (or rather the landed proprietor) to gain all that the\r\nconsumer loses by the corn monopoly,--if it were only taking from one,\r\nand giving to another--without any national loss; though this of itself\r\nwould be bad enough,--it is perhaps the smallest part of the loss which\r\nthe manufacturer sustains; for the same law which hinders him from going\r\nto the best and cheapest market to purchase his food, at the same time\r\nnecessarily excludes him from a market for the produce of his industry;\r\nand by diminishing the demand for his labour, lowers his wages or throws\r\nhim out of employment.\r\n\r\nBut one abuse leads to another. Those who are interested in the corn\r\nmonopoly, or think themselves so, cannot well oppose the sugar monopoly\r\nwhile they require the aid of the West India planters to enable them to\r\nobtain this advantage at their country's expense; and so it is with all\r\nthe other monopolists, they naturally unite together, and it requires\r\ntheir mutual aid and all their combined power and influence to preserve\r\na system which they know stands upon rather an insecure foundation, and\r\nif once broken in upon would soon fall to pieces; and thus it is that we\r\nare subjected to the sugar monopoly, and though it is manifestly our\r\ninterest to buy this important necessary of life (as well as every\r\nother) in any quarter of the globe where we can find it best and\r\ncheapest, we are restricted to a small portion of the earth's surface,\r\nand have to pay a third part more than we might obtain the article for\r\nwithout any loss to the revenue. By this narrow-minded system of buying,\r\nwe deprive ourselves of valuable markets for our manufactures, as you\r\nhave shown is likely to be the case with the Brazils on the expiry of\r\nthe commercial treaty with that country if the matter is left in the\r\nhands of Ministers, \"and no effort made to avert so great an evil.\" The\r\nagriculturists have to pay directly for this monopoly in common with all\r\nthe other classes in the addition to the price of the sugar they\r\nconsume; but the manufacturers suffer the still greater disadvantage of\r\nhaving the market for the produce of their labour narrowed, and thus the\r\nagriculturist will also suffer indirectly by their customers being\r\nthereby still farther disabled to consume.\r\n\r\nBut these and all other monopolies and restrictions in trade not only\r\nlessen the demand for our manufactures abroad, but they diminish the\r\nconsumption at home, to an extent greater perhaps than we are aware of;\r\nfor there can be no doubt that the more the consumer has to pay for his\r\nbread, sugar, and other articles of food, the less he will have to spare\r\nfor cottons, woollens, and other manufactured commodities. The demand\r\nfor his labour is thus lessened both at home and abroad. The weaver of\r\ncloth may be unable to obtain a coat even of his own manufacture,\r\nhowever necessary it may be for his health and comfort; he must have\r\nfood, in the first place, being more indispensibly necessary to his\r\nexistence,--no doubt he may have to content himself with a less quantity\r\nthan he could have wished, and have to substitute oatmeal and potatoes,\r\nor some other inferior food for wheaten bread and butchers meat; still,\r\nit is less in his power to curtail the consumption of agricultural\r\nproduce than of manufactures, so that the manufacturing classes suffer\r\nfrom the general distress which renders the people unable to consume in\r\na greater degree than the agriculturist.\r\n\r\n  R.T.F.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST.\r\n\r\nDarlaston, September 8, 1843.\r\n\r\nSir,--Twelve months ago the editor of the _Morning Chronicle_ allowed a\r\nletter of mine, referring to the distress then prevailing in this town,\r\nto appear in that journal; in it I stated that for our annual wake only\r\ntwenty-four cows had been killed, when but a few years previously\r\nninety-four had been slaughtered on a similar occasion. Perhaps you will\r\npermit me to state in your columns that this year the festival, in this\r\nparticular, has afforded as melancholy and unquestionable proof of\r\ndistress as the last, while it bore other evidence, which though\r\ntrivial in itself, is not unworthy of notice. Last year two theatrical\r\nshows visited us, displaying their \"Red Barn\" tragedies, and illuminated\r\nghosts, at threepence per head, at which they did well; as also did a\r\ntremendous giantess, a monstrously fat boy, and several other \"wonderful\r\nworks of nature:\" this year only one show of any description attended,\r\nand that, with kings and queens, and clowns, as well dressed and\r\nefficient, and ghosts, as white and awe-inspiring as ever paraded before\r\nan audience, has reaped but an indifferent harvest at the \"low charge of\r\none penny each;\" while the swing boats and wood horses, patronized with\r\nsuch glee by the miniature men and women attending and enjoying wakes\r\nand fairs, only worked half time. The physical-force majority in the\r\nHouse, and their aiders and abettors, were they to see this, would\r\nperhaps laugh at the petty details, but their doing so would not in the\r\nleast detract from their truth, or render questionable for a moment the\r\ndeductions I make from them,--that poverty is so wide spread and bitter\r\nthat the poor are compelled to make a stern sacrifice of innocent\r\namusements; that the parent cannot exercise the holiest affections of\r\nhis nature, by adding to the pleasures of his lisping little ones; that\r\nthe landowners' corn law, by its paralyzing influence, is rapidly\r\nwithering the great mass of the industry of the country into idle,\r\ndispiriting pauperism.\r\n\r\nFrom inquiries I have made I learn that through the country generally\r\nthe wakes, and fairs, and races, have presented similar features to\r\nthose I have described above, so far as money goes. And in face of the\r\ndistress, of which these things bear glaring witness, the Prime Minister\r\nsays \"that the distress has been produced by over-production.\" Can Sir\r\nRobert be serious when he talks of \"over-production?\" If he be, and will\r\ncondescend to honour me with a visit during his stay at Drayton Manor,\r\nwhich is only a short drive of sixteen miles from here, I will show him\r\nthat the opinion is fallacious. He shall dispense with his carriage for\r\na short time, and I will walk him through all the streets of Darlaston,\r\nWednesbury, Willenhall, Bilstow, &c., and, forsaking the thoroughfares\r\nfrequented by the gay and well-to-do, he shall visit the back\r\nstreets--in which carriage passengers never deign to go--of Birmingham,\r\nWolverhampton, and Walsall, and what he will witness in the course of\r\nthe short ramble will \"change the spirit of his dream.\" In Darlaston, as\r\na sample of what he would see, there are hundreds of men and women whose\r\nclothes, made of the coarsest materials, are patched, and threadbare,\r\nand valueless; hundreds of houses without anything in them deserving the\r\nname of furniture; hundreds of beds without clothing, and hundreds of\r\nchildren whose excuses for clothes are barely sufficient, with every\r\ncontrivance decent poverty can suggest, to cover the body as civilized\r\nsociety demands. In the towns I have enumerated, in fact, if the least\r\nreliance may be placed in newspaper reports, in every town and village\r\nin the country the same want prevails to a much greater extent than can\r\nbe conceived by such as Sir Robert, \"who fare sumptuously every\r\nday,\"--aye, even to a much greater extent than is generally supposed by\r\nthe above-want dwellers in large towns whom business may frequently\r\nbring in contact with those who toil. With the millions, then, who in\r\nthis country must be next to naked, without furniture in their houses,\r\nwithout clothes to cover their straw beds, is it not the nonsense of\r\nnonsense to talk of \"over-production.\" Enable these men to satisfy the\r\nwants of themselves and families, enable them to make their homes\r\ncomfortable, and that alone would find employment for a goodly number,\r\nwhile those so employed would also be enabled to purchase the articles\r\nothers are engaged in manufacturing. To produce so desirable a result,\r\nnothing is wanted but FREE TRADE repeal the corn and provision laws, and\r\nthe shadow of \"over production\" could not exist: in three months there\r\nis not a man in the kingdom who would not have full work. And when we\r\nhad supplied the physical wants of our population (a greater task than\r\nit appears at the first view), we should have introduced from every\r\ncorner of the world the luxuries which refine civilization; the artisan\r\nbuilding himself a house would then make it more comfortable and\r\nhealthy, with wood floors, carpets, better furniture, &c.; and the\r\nmaster manufacturer erecting a house would have marble stairs and floor\r\nin his entrance hall, doors, &c. of mahogany, furniture, of rarer woods,\r\nand ornaments of marble, paintings, plate glass, &c.; and when all these\r\nthings were procured, \"over-production\" would be still as far behind us\r\nas during their acquisition, as we would then work but three days a week\r\ninstead of six, as with so much labour we should be able to procure the\r\nnecessaries and luxuries of life.\r\n\r\nAnd all nations would be compelled to minister to our real and created\r\nwants, for England is the only nation in the world incapable of\r\ninternally supplying its inhabitants with food, and therefore, under\r\nFree Trade, has the command of the markets of the whole world. Then the\r\nEnglish merchant going to, say America, to dispose of manufactures need\r\nnot fear the merchant of France, Belgium, Germany, &c., he may meet\r\nthere with similar goods; for the American asking each what he requires\r\nfor the articles offered, is told by the former, \"I will take your\r\nsurplus corn in exchange, we want every year from six to ten millions of\r\nquarters;\" and this latter answers, \"We have more corn at home of our\r\nown growth than we can consume, I must have cash;\" the American,\r\npreferring barter, will turn on his heel and trade with the Englishman;\r\nthe unsuccessful applicant takes back his goods, or visits the market no\r\nmore, and confines his future operations to the home supply of his own\r\ncountry, which in a short time, from competition and want of a foreign\r\noutlet, fail to realise a remunerating profit; trade is gradually\r\nrelinquished; the people turn again to the more extensive cultivation of\r\nthe land, and England obtains another customer. This is no \"castle\r\nbuilding,\" if there be the least affinity between the results of great\r\nthings and small ones. If a grocer want a coat he will have it from the\r\ntailor who will take sugar and tea in payment, in preference to\r\npatronising one who requires pounds shillings and pence, and the owners\r\nof land in all countries will take right good care that they derive some\r\nsort of revenue from their possessions. I say, I think my premises are\r\nno \"castle buildings;\" neither do I think I am indulging in aerial\r\nerections when I predict that, under Free Trade, England, with her\r\ncapital, and energy, and enterprise, would shortly become the world's\r\ngranary, profitably supplying from her accumulated stores the\r\ndeficiencies resulting from bad harvests, or other casualties of her\r\ncontinental neighbours.\r\n\r\n  Your obedient Servant,\r\n  G.W.G.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_We are much obliged to J.

So far, however, it has been freely met by\r\nthe holders; and the speculators and spinners have had an abundant\r\nchoice of all qualities.\r\n\r\nIn American descriptions there is but little change in prices; the\r\ntendency, has been and still is in favour of holders; and it has been\r\nthought necessary to raise the quotations of \"fair\" Uplands and Mobile\r\nto 4-7/8d.; but there is so little actual change, that for the most\r\npart, the quotations remain as before. Brazils, Egyptian, and long\r\nstapled generally, have been more in demand, and may be considered 1/8d.\r\nhigher. Sea Islands also within the fortnight are 1/2d. higher, making\r\nan advance in the ordinary to fair qualities from the very lowest point\r\nof 1-1/2d. to 2d. per lb.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the speculative business of this week has been\r\nprompted by the accounts from the United States, brought by the\r\n_Hibernia_ and _Great Western_, the tenor of which is to confirm the\r\nprevious impression as to short crops.\r\n\r\n19,800 American, 100 Egyptian, and 300 Surat have been taken on\r\nspeculation; and 1,000 American, 300 Pernam, and 200 Surat for export.\r\n\r\nThe following is the Statistical Review of our Cotton Market:--\r\n\r\n  Taken for Consumption:          for Export:\r\n\r\n  from 1st Jan. to 15th Sept.\r\n\r\n     1842.         1843.      1842.      1843.\r\n  794,500 bales. 946,500 bls. 66,500 bls. 65,900 bls.\r\n\r\n               whole Import:\r\n           1842.         1843.\r\n        1,024,141 bls. 1,401,278 bls.\r\n\r\n       Computed Stock.

To-day (Saturday) the Royal party go\r\nto Bruges; on Monday to Brussels; on Tuesday to Antwerp; and on\r\nWednesday return to England.\r\n\r\nBarcelona is still in a state of insurrection; and though Madrid is\r\ntranquil, the state of Spain, as the _Times_ remarks, is one of \"simple\r\nconfusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Malta correspondent of the _Morning Chronicle_ says that a report\r\nhad been current at Bombay that it was the intention to order the next\r\nsteamer for the overland mail to keep her direct course, in spite of the\r\nmonsoon. The monsoon had, no doubt, driven her back.\r\n\r\nWales continues in a distracted state, and acts of incendiarism are\r\ncommon. The extraordinary verdict given by the inquest jury on the body\r\nof the unfortunate old woman who was shot, is the subject of general\r\nremark, as strikingly evincing the terrorism which prevails. There is\r\neven talk of the necessity of putting the country under martial law!\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable meeting held by Messrs Cobden and Bright, at Oxford,\r\non Wednesday last, is the theme of general conversation in society. It\r\nis, indeed, a very striking evidence of the progress of free-trade\r\nprinciples amongst the agriculturists.\r\n\r\nThe _Leeds Mercury_ of this morning, and other provincial organs of\r\npublic opinion, in the great seats of our commerce and manufactures, all\r\nspeak in cheerful terms of the decidly-improving prospects of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATEST FROM THE AMERICAN PRESS ON FREE TRADE--AUG. 24TH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORN-LAW CONTROVERSY.--A friend has placed in our hands numbers of\r\nthe tracts which the corn-law reformers of England circulate among the\r\npeople. They are about the size and length of the religious tracts of\r\nthis country, and are put up in an envelope, which is stamped with neat\r\nand appropriate devices. These little publications comprise essays on\r\nall the topics involved in the corn-law controversy, sometimes in the\r\nform of dialogues, sometimes of tales, and sometimes of extracts from\r\nfamous books and speeches. The arguments are arranged so as to be easily\r\ncomprehended by the meanest capacities.\r\n\r\nThe friend to whom we are indebted for these is well informed on the\r\nsubject, and says that a more advanced state of opinion prevails among\r\nthe people of England, in relation to the operation of tariffs, than in\r\nthis nation generally so much more enlightened. It is a singular\r\nspectacle which is thus presented to the eyes of the civilized world.\r\nWhile the tendency of opinion, under an aristocratic monarchy, is\r\ntowards the loosening of the restraints under which the labour of the\r\npeople has long suffered, a large and powerful party in a nation, whose\r\ntheory of government is nearly a century in advance of the world, is\r\nclamouring for their continuance and confirmation. Monarchical England\r\nis struggling to break the chains that an unwise legislation has forged\r\nfor the limbs of its trade; but democratic America is urged to put on\r\nthe fetters which older but less liberal nations are throwing off. The\r\nnations of Europe are seeking to extend their commercial relations, to\r\nexpand the sphere of their mutual intercourse, to rivet the market for\r\nthe various products of their soil and skill, while the \"model republic\"\r\nof the new world is urged to stick to the silly and odious policy of a\r\nsemi-barbarous age.\r\n\r\nWe look upon the attempt which is making in Great Britain to procure a\r\nrevision of the tariff laws, as one of the most important political\r\nmovements of the age. It is a reform that contemplates benefits, whose\r\neffects would not be confined to any single nation, or any period of\r\ntime. Should it be successful, it would be the beginning of a grand and\r\nuniversal scheme of commercial emancipation. Let England--that nation so\r\nextensive in her relations, and so powerful in her influences--let\r\nEngland adopt a more liberal policy, and it would remove the only\r\nobstacles now in the way of a complete freedom of industry throughout\r\nthe globe. It is the apparent unwillingness of nations to reciprocate\r\nthe advantages of mutual trade, that has kept back this desirable reform\r\nso long. The standing argument of the friends of exclusiveness--their\r\ndefence under all assaults, their shelter in every emergency--has been\r\nthat one nation cannot pursue a free system until all others do, or, in\r\nother words, that restriction is to be met by restriction. It is a\r\nflimsy pretence, but such as it is, has answered the purposes of those\r\nwho have used it, for many centuries.\r\n\r\nThe practice of confining trade by the invisible, but potent chains of\r\nlaw, has been a curse wherever it has prevailed. In England, more\r\ndependent than other nations on the extent of its commercial\r\nintercourse, it may be said to have operated as a scourge. The most\r\nterrible inflictions of natural evil, storms, famine, and pestilence,\r\nhave not produced an equal amount of suffering. Indeed, it has combined\r\nthe characteristics of the worst of those evils. It has devastated, like\r\nthe storm, the busy hives of industry; it has exhausted, like famine,\r\nthe life and vital principle of trade; and, like the pestilence, it has\r\n\"walked in the darkness and wasted at noon-day.\" When we read of\r\nthousands of miserable wretches, in all the cities and towns of a great\r\nnation, huddled together like so many swine in a pen; in rags, squalor,\r\nand want; without work, bread, or hope; dragging out from day to day, by\r\nbegging, or the petty artifices of theft, an existence which is\r\nworthless and a burden; and when, at the same time, we see a system of\r\nlaws, that has carefully drawn a band of iron around every mode of human\r\nexertion; which with lynx-eyed and omniscient vigilance, has dragged\r\nevery product of industry from its retreat to become the subject of a\r\ntax, can we fail in ascribing the effect to its cause, or suppress the\r\nutterance of our indignation at a policy so heartless and destructive?\r\n\r\nYet, this is the very policy that a certain class of politicians in this\r\ncountry would have us imitate. Misled by the selfish and paltry\r\narguments of British statesmen, but unawed by the terrible experience of\r\nthe British people, they would fasten upon us a system whose only\r\nrecommendation, in its best form, is that it enriches a few, at the cost\r\nof the lives and happiness of many. They would assist a constrictor in\r\nwrapping his folds around us, until our industry shall be completely\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nST OLAVE'S CHURCH.--The rebuilding of this church in the early part of\r\nthe last century cost the parishioners a less sum than the organ. The\r\nold church having fallen down, the new one (that recently destroyed by\r\nfire) was erected by raising an annuity of 700_l_., and the granter died\r\nafter receiving the first half year's payment of 350_l_. The organ was\r\nthe most ancient instrument in the metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE-TRADE MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nMESSRS COBDEN AND BRIGHT AT OXFORD.--IMPORTANT MEETING OF FREEHOLDERS\r\nAND FARMERS OF THAT COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we stated last week, announcing the intention, Mr Cobden and Mr\r\nBright visited Oxford on Wednesday, for the purpose of addressing the\r\nfreeholders and farmers of the county on the subject of the corn laws.\r\n\r\nVery considerable excitement had prevailed in the city and the\r\nsurrounding districts in consequence of the proposed visit of Mr Cobden,\r\nbut it does not appear that the landowners on the present occasion,\r\nthrough the medium of the farmers' clubs and agricultural associations,\r\nthought fit to get up an organised opposition, similar to that at\r\nColchester, or interfere to prevent their tenants from attending, as at\r\nReading. The consequence was a very large number of farmers were present\r\nat the meeting, although it is well known that the harvest is not in\r\nsuch a state of forwardness as to allow them to absent themselves from\r\ntheir ordinary occupations without considerable inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt is a circumstance worthy of notice, and strongly indicative of the\r\npresent state of public feeling upon the subject, that in a purely\r\nagricultural district, at a county meeting regularly convened by the\r\nHigh Sheriff, the whole of the county members being present, two of whom\r\nspoke in favour of protection, supported by many influential men of\r\ntheir own party, no person ventured to propose a resolution in favour of\r\nthe present corn law, and that even the resolution for a low fixed duty\r\nmade by two of the most popular men and largest landed proprietors in\r\nOxfordshire, Lord Camoys and Mr Langston, was supported by only three or\r\nfour individuals out of a meeting of nearly 3,000 persons.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, a protectionist champion presented himself, not in\r\nthe guise either of a freeholder or farmer of the county, but in the\r\nperson of a good-humoured, though somewhat eccentric printer, named\r\nSparkhall, who had come from the celebrated _locale_ of John\r\nGilpin--Cheapside, and who having armed himself with a large blue bag\r\nfitted with elaborate treatises upon the corn laws, and among other\r\npamphlets a recent number of _Punch_, forthwith travelled to Oxford, and\r\nby the kind permission of the meeting was permitted to essay a speech,\r\nabout what nobody could divine, and in a manner truly original. It is,\r\nhowever, due to the monopolists of Oxfordshire to state that they did\r\nnot accredit their volunteer champion, and even went so far as to\r\nrequest that he would \"bottle up\" his eloquence for some future\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock, the hour appointed for the proceedings to commence, the\r\nCounty hall, which is capable of containing 1,800 persons, was nearly\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nMr Cobden and Mr Bright, who had been dining at the farmers' ordinary,\r\nheld at the Roebuck hotel, arrived shortly after two, and were\r\naccompanied to the place of meeting by a large number of influential\r\nfarmers and leading agriculturists, who had met the honourable members\r\nat the market table. They at once proceeded to the gallery, where, among\r\nothers at this time, were Lord Camoys, of Stonor hall, Oxon; the three\r\nmembers for the county, Lord Norreys, Mr Harcourt, and Mr Henley; Mr\r\nLangston, M.P. for the city of Oxford; Mr Thomas Robinson, banker; Mr\r\nCharles Cottrell Dormer, Mr J.S. Browning, Mr W. Dry, Mr W. Parker,\r\nCaptain Matcham, Rev. Dr Godwin, Rev. W. Slatter, Mr Richard Goddard, Mr\r\nH. Venables, Messrs Grubb, Sadler, Towle, Weaving, Harvey, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the motion of Lord Cambys, seconded by Mr Langston, M.P., Mr Samuel\r\nCooper, of Henley-on-Thames, under-sheriff for the county, was, in the\r\nabsence of the high sheriff, called to the chair.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman said he regretted very much that the high sheriff was\r\nprevented from attending the meeting, which had been convened in\r\nconsequence of a requisition presented to the sheriff by several\r\nfreeholders of the county. Having read the requisition, he introduced\r\n\r\nMr Cobden, who proceeded for some time to address the meeting on the\r\nfallacy of the present corn law as a protection to the farmer, amid\r\nfrequent cries for adjournment, in consequence of the crowded state of\r\nthe hall, and\r\n\r\nMr Sadler having intimated that several hundred persons were waiting at\r\nthe Castle green, at which place it had been generally expected the\r\nmeeting would ultimately be held, moved its adjournment to that spot,\r\nwhich was immediately agreed to.\r\n\r\nSeveral waggons had been brought to the green, for the purpose of\r\nforming a temporary platform, and the meeting being again formed,\r\n\r\nMr Cobden resumed, and, in his usual powerful manner, explained the\r\ninfluence of the corn law upon the tenant, farmer, and farm-labourer,\r\nurging the necessity of free trade as the only remedy for agricultural\r\nas well as manufacturing distress. The honourable member was loudly\r\ncheered during the delivery of his address, which evidently made a deep\r\nimpression on the large proportion of his auditory.\r\n\r\nMr Sparkhall then came forward. Mr Cobden having kindly interceded to\r\nobtain him a hearing, and having duly arranged his books and papers, he\r\nat once commanded the serious attention of the meeting, by stating\r\nbroadly as the proposition he was about to prove--that the repeal of the\r\ncorn laws would plunge the nation into such a state of depression as\r\nmust ultimately terminate in a national bankruptcy. After quoting from\r\nthe Honourable and Reverend Baptist Noel, Mr Gregg, and other passages,\r\nthe relevancy of which to his proposition no one could discover, he\r\nbewildered himself in a calculation, and gladly availed himself of a\r\nslight interruption to make his bow and retire.\r\n\r\nLord Camoys next addressed the meeting. He said Mr Cobden came among\r\nthem either as a friend or an enemy. If he came as a friend, it was the\r\nduty of all to receive him as such; but if as an enemy, then it behoved\r\nthe farmers of Oxfordshire to meet him boldly, and expose the fallacy of\r\nhis arguments. For himself he (Lord Camoys) believed Mr Cobden came as a\r\nfriend. He was not one of those who were afraid of the Anti-Corn-law\r\nLeague; but he was afraid of that class who designated themselves the\r\nfarmers' friends. He thought if they were to give the Anti-Corn-law\r\nLeague 50,000_l_. a year for fifty years, it would never do half the\r\nmischief to agriculture that the farmers' friends themselves had done.\r\n(Hear, hear.) It was this impression that had induced him to sign the\r\nrequisition that had been laid before him, for he was anxious that the\r\nfarmers of Oxfordshire should have the benefit of any information that\r\ncould be given to them on the subject. There were three courses open for\r\ndiscussion. The first was the sliding scale (cries of \"no, no\"); the\r\nsecond a low fixed duty; and the third, a total and immediate repeal of\r\nthe corn law. (Hear, hear.) He believed the sliding scale was already on\r\nits last legs; indeed, it was only defended by a few country gentlemen\r\nand fortunate speculators, who had by a lucky chance contrived to\r\nrealise large fortunes. He was himself for a low fixed duty, and Mr\r\nCobden advocated free trade. There was not so much difference, after\r\nall, between them; but he considered that to apply the principles of\r\nfree trade to England, would be to apply the principles of common sense\r\nto a deranged country, suffering under the pressure of an enormous debt.\r\nHe thought the English farmer should be placed on a level with the\r\ncontinental corn-grower; but he did not think the mere expense of\r\ntransit would have the effect of securing this as argued by Mr. Cobden.\r\nWith this view he should propose to the meeting the following\r\nresolution:--\"That the agricultural interest being the paramount\r\ninterest in this country, to depress that interest would be injurious to\r\nthe entire community; that suddenly to adopt free trade in corn must\r\nproduce that effect, and that, therefore, it is the opinion of this\r\nmeeting that a moderate fixed duty upon the importation of foreign grain\r\nis the one best adapted to the present position of the agricultural\r\ninterest and the welfare of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was seconded by Mr Langston, M.P., but this gentleman\r\ngave way for\r\n\r\nMr Bright, who, upon presenting himself, was received with load\r\ncheering. In an eloquent address he clearly demonstrated that the only\r\nway in which the corn laws could benefit the farmer was by making food\r\ndearer, which could only be done by making it more scarce. That the\r\nadvantage of such high prices invariably went to the landlord in the\r\nshape of rent, in consequence of the immense competition for farms,\r\narising from the increase in the agricultural population, and the\r\ndifficulty of providing for them in commerce and manufactures, owing to\r\nthe depressed condition to which they had been reduced by the operation\r\nof the corn laws. High prices could only be obtained by the farmer from\r\nthe prosperity of his customers. In reply to the resolution of Lord\r\nCamoys, the honourable gentleman stated, that with regard to agriculture\r\nbeing the paramount interest of the country, there could be no doubt in\r\nevery country there must be land for the people to live on, and so far\r\nit was the paramount interest; but he denied that anything like half the\r\npopulation of England were engaged in agricultural pursuits. The\r\nagricultural interest would not be depressed, nor would the community be\r\ninjured by free trade. He would put it to the meeting whether they would\r\nhave a low duty or no duty at all. (Loud cries of \"no duty.\") A fixed\r\nduty of 6s. would raise the price that amount, and the whole would go\r\ninto the pockets of the landlord. The honourable gentleman concluded his\r\naddress amid loud cheers.\r\n\r\nLord Norreys next spoke in favour of the existing corn laws, attributing\r\nthe distress under which all classes at present laboured to the\r\nover-production of the manufacturers.\r\n\r\nMr Langston, M.P., having replied to his lordship,\r\n\r\nMr Henley, M.P., addressed the meeting at some length, in favour of the\r\npresent restrictive duties on the importation corn. The honourable\r\nmember concluded by observing that he had attended the meeting because\r\nit had been convened by the high sheriff; and he thanked them for the\r\npatience with which they had listened to his observations, though\r\nneither he nor his colleagues considered it to be properly designated as\r\na farmers' meeting, the majority present being composed of other\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nMr Cobden briefly replied; and\r\n\r\nMr Towle (a tenant farmer) moved the following amendment, \"That in the\r\nopinion of this meeting the principles of free trade are in accordance\r\nwith the laws of nature and conducive to the welfare of mankind, and\r\nthat all laws which interfere with the free intercourse of nations,\r\nunder the pretence of protection to the agricultural, colonial, or\r\nmanufacturing interests, ought to be forthwith abolished.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion having been seconded, was put, and declared to be carried,\r\nwith only three dissentients.\r\n\r\nMr Henley then proposed, and Mr Cobden seconded, a vote of thanks to the\r\nchairman, who briefly acknowledged the compliment, and three cheers\r\nhaving been given for free trade the meeting separated, having lasted\r\nnearly five hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DINNER TO R. WALKER, ESQ., M.P., BURY.--On Wednesday week a\r\npublic dinner was given, in the Free-Trade Pavilion, Paradise street,\r\nBury, by the electors of Bury, to the above-named gentleman, for his\r\nconstant advocacy of Liberal principles in the House of Commons. The\r\nmeeting, though called to do honour to the worthy representative of\r\nBury, was emphatically a gathering of the friends of free trade, Mr\r\nBright, Dr Bowring, Mr Brotherton, &c., being present.\r\n\r\nDR BOWRING'S VISIT TO HIS CONSTITUENTS.--Dr Bowring arrived in Bolton,\r\non his annual visit, on Thursday week. In the course of the afternoon he\r\ncalled upon several of the leading reformers and free-traders of the\r\nborough; and in the evening, according to public announcement, he\r\nattended at the Temperance hall, Little Bolton, to address the\r\ninhabitants generally. The doors of the hall were opened at seven\r\no'clock, and hundreds immediately flocked in. At half-past seven, the\r\nhall was crowded to excess in every part. On Dr Bowring's entrance, he\r\nwas greeted with loud cheers. The chief portion of the proceedings\r\nconsisted in the speech of the learned and honourable member, who, as\r\nmight be expected, dwelt with great power on the question of\r\nquestions--free trade. We have only room for the following eloquent\r\npassage: \"The more I see of England, the prouder I am to recognise her\r\nsuperiority--not alone in arms--about that I care little, but in\r\nmanufacturing arts, the peaceful arts, which really reflect glory on her\r\npeople. (Cheers.) Give us fair play and no favour, and we need not fear\r\nthe strength of the whole world. (Hear.) Let us start in an honest\r\nrivalry--let us get rid of the drawbacks and impediments which are in\r\nthe way of our progress, and sure I am that the virtues, the energies,\r\nthe industry, the adventurous spirit of the manufacturers and merchants\r\nof England, which have planted their language in every climate and in\r\nevery region, would make them known as benefactors through the wide\r\nworld. They are recognised by the black man as giving him many sources\r\nof enjoyment which he had not before; by the red man as having reached\r\nhis fields and forests, and brought to him in his daily life enjoyments\r\nof which his ancestors had no notion; by all tribes and tongues\r\nthroughout the wide expanse of the earth, as the allies of improvement,\r\nand the promoters of happiness. Sure I am that England--emancipated\r\nEngland--the labourers--the artisans of England, may do more for the\r\nhonour and reputation of our country than was ever done by all the\r\nNelsons and Wellingtons of the day. (Loud cheers.) I was struck very\r\nmuch, the other day, by the remark of one of the wisest and best men of\r\nour times, from the other side of the Atlantic, who said, 'I am not\r\ndazzled by the great names which I see recorded in high places; I am not\r\nattracted by the statues which are raised to the men whom you call\r\nillustrious, but what _does_ strike me, what _does_ delight me, what\r\n_does_ fascinate me, is to trace the working man of England to his home;\r\nto see him there labouring at his loom unnoticed and unknown, toiling\r\nbefore the sun rises, nor ceasing to toil when the sun has descended\r\nbeneath the mountain. It is _that_ man, the missionary of peace, who\r\nforms the true link of alliance between nation and nation, making all\r\nmen of one kindred and of one blood,--that man upon whose brow the sweat\r\nis falling,--that man whose hands are hardened by labour,--that is the\r\nman of whom England has a right to be proud--(hear)--that is the man\r\nwhom the world ought to recognise as its benefactor.' (Cheers.) And,\r\ngentlemen, in such sentiments I cordially agree, and the time will come\r\nwhen the names of men who are called illustrious, at whose feet we have\r\nbeen rolling out torrents of wealth, whom we have been crowning with\r\ndazzling honours--those men will pass away into the realms of\r\nforgetfulness, while the poor and industrious labourer, who has been\r\nthrough the world a herald and apostle of good, will be respected and\r\nhonoured, and upon him future times will look as the real patriot, the\r\nreal philanthropist, the real honour of his country and of his\r\ncountrymen.\" The proceedings were closed by the unanimous thanks of the\r\nmeeting being given to Dr Bowring.\r\n\r\nFREE TRADE.--We are glad to learn, from a correspondence in the\r\n_Liverpool Albion_, that W. Brown, Esq., the head of the eminent house\r\nof Brown, Shipley, and Co., of Liverpool, has declared his adherence to\r\nthe cause of perfect freedom of trade, contributing, at the same time,\r\n50_l._ to the funds of the Liverpool Anti-Monopoly Association.\r\n\r\nCORN TRADE OF FRANCE.--The _Moniteur_ publishes the return of the corn\r\ntrade in France during the month of July, from which it appears that the\r\nimports were--wheat, 45,896 metrical quintels; other grain, 23,389; and\r\nflour, 613. The exports--wheat, 14,318; other grain, 11,506; and flour,\r\n2,435. The quantities lying in the government bonding stores on the\r\nfirst of August were--wheat, 28,405 metrical quintals; other grain,\r\n9,378; and flour, 11,051.\r\n\r\nANTI-CORN-LAW MEETING AT HAMPSTEAD.--The opponents of the corn laws\r\nresident at Hampstead assembled on Tuesday night, in crowded meeting, at\r\nthe Temperance hall of that locality, to hear Mr Sidney Smith deliver an\r\naddress on the evils of the corn laws. The meeting was the first of the\r\nkind since the formation of the new association, and there were several\r\nof the respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood present. Mr Smith\r\nentered at length into the whole question of the monopolies from which\r\nthe people of this country suffer. He showed, conclusively, and by a\r\nreference to facts and comparisons with other countries, that\r\n\"protective\" duties were injurious to the best interests of the\r\ncommunity, as they were productive of abridgment of the people's\r\ncomfort, and of taxation on everything that they could see or touch. He\r\nillustrated the advantages that would arise from free trade, by a\r\nreference to the great increase of consumption of the article of coffee\r\nsince the reduction of the duty of half a crown on the pound weight to\r\nninepence; the consumption at that period (1824) having been but eight\r\nmillions of pounds weight, while at present, it was twenty-eight\r\nmillions. The learned gentleman, who spoke for upwards of two hours,\r\nconcluded amid loud cheers. Three cheers which were proposed for the\r\nCharter proved a decided failure; while, on the other hand, three were\r\nproposed for a repeal of the corn laws, which were responded to by\r\nnearly the whole of the crowded meeting.\r\n\r\nMR EWART AND HIS CONSTITUENTS.--William Ewart, Esq., the indefatigable\r\nmember for the Dumfries District of Burghs, is at present paying his\r\nrespects to his constituents, after the recess of what has been to him a\r\nlaborious session of parliament, however little may have been effected\r\nduring its course by the government and the legislature. On Thursday\r\nevening he addressed a large meeting in this town. On Friday he visited\r\nLochmaben, and on Saturday Sanquhar, and addressed the inhabitants of\r\nboth these burghs.--_Dumfries Courier_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANIES OF TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF TRADE.--Owing to the continued absence of the Overland Mail,\r\nthe demand for manufactured goods, and especially for shirtings, has\r\nbeen limited; but, as stocks are low, prices remain tolerably steady.\r\nFor yarn the demand continues good, and prices very firm, but the\r\nspinners are so generally engaged, that no great amount of business has\r\nbeen done.--_Manchester Guardian_ of Wednesday.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES.--The\r\ncircumstances of America are such as to require, for the furtherance of\r\nits own interests, a large and extended commercial relationship with\r\nEngland. There is nothing wanting but a movement on our part for the\r\nspeedy establishment of an unbounded trade. Both countries are so\r\nsituated that they need never become rivals, provided they consent to\r\nco-operate with each other. It is because they have not been permitted\r\nhitherto so to do that we now hear of an embryo manufacturing system in\r\nAmerica. We have already built Lowell in New England, and Pittsburg in\r\nWestern Pennsylvania; and will yet, unless we change our system, drive\r\nthe enterprising republican to efforts which may be more generally and\r\nmore permanently successful.--_Morning Chronicle_.\r\n\r\nTRAVELLING BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE.--The number of persons who passed\r\nfrom England to France, by Boulogne, in the week from 1st to 7th\r\nSeptember inclusive, was 2,409, and by Calais, 838. It appears that the\r\nopening of the Southern and Eastern Railway as far as Folkestone has\r\nincreased the number of travellers between England and France by nearly\r\none-half. The number in August, 1842, was 7,436, while during the past\r\nmonth it has been no less than 10,579, showing an increase of 3,143.\r\n\r\nSTEAM V. WATER.--Owing to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway Company\r\nhaving reduced their charge for all kinds of goods to 6s. per ton\r\nbetween Gloucester and Cheltenham; most of the carriers in this city\r\nwill be compelled to avail themselves of this mode of conveyance, it\r\nbeing impossible for them to compete with the Railway Company. The\r\nconsequence will be that some thirty or forty boats will speedily be\r\n\"laid up in ordinary,\" to the sorrow of three or four times the number\r\nof boatmen, who will of course be thrown out of employ.--_Worcester\r\nChronicle_.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW TARIFF.--\"The imports of foreign beasts since Monday last (one\r\nweek) have been confined to twenty-five into London by the _Batavier_\r\nsteamer from Rotterdam.\" (London Markets Report, September 11.) Can any\r\nclever master of fractions calculate the effect of this importation on\r\nthe Smithfield market, and the benefit thence accruing to the citizens\r\nof London as a set-off to the payment of their income-tax?\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF TRADE--ROCHDALE.--The piece market has been uncommonly\r\nbrisk to-day, and all the goods on hand have been cleared off. At\r\npresent all the workmen are in full employment, though at very low\r\nwages; but a few markets of this kind will have a tendency to get up\r\nwages. The ready sale of goods has given a buoyancy to the wool market,\r\nand the dealers in the raw material have not been so eager to sell at\r\nformer prices.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF TRADE--PAISLEY.--So far as ample employment to all engaged in\r\nthe staple manufactures of the town is concerned, trade still continues\r\nfavourable for the workman, but the manufacturers generally complain\r\nthat, for the season, sales are late of commencing, and many of them are\r\nalready rather slackening their operations to keep their stocks down.\r\nThe unexpected procrastination in the commencement of the fall trade is\r\nreasonably accounted for by the fineness of the weather.\r\n\r\n\"A Merchant of twenty-five years' standing, and an Old Subscriber,\"\r\ncalls attention to the unusual state of things now so long existing in\r\nthe Money Market, by the fall in the rate of interest to 1-3/4 and 2 per\r\ncent. upon the first class commercial bills. He states that a friend of\r\nhis has lately lent 100,000_l._ at 1-1/2 to 2 per cent., being the\r\nhighest rate he could obtain. This condition of the Money Market he\r\nattributes to the large amount of paper money in circulation, compared\r\nwith the demands of commerce. Our correspondent favours us with some\r\nfigures, illustrative of his views, from November, 1841, to the present\r\nmonth, taken from the _Gazette_ returns, and observing that there has\r\nbeen a serious fall in the value of merchandise equal to one-fifth or\r\none-sixth, with some exceptions during the last year and a half, he\r\naccounts by the juxtaposition of his figures, denoting the amount of\r\npaper in circulation, and this assumed fall in the price of merchandise\r\nfor the present anomalous condition of the Money Market, and for the\r\napparent worthlessness of capital. We cannot agree, however, with our\r\ncorrespondent to the full extent, because the very low prices of\r\ncommodities, with a _minimum_ rate of interest for money, proves that\r\nthere is no fictitious or inflated excess of paper money. The anomalous\r\nstate of the Money Market proceeds, we believe, from a redundancy, not\r\nof mere paper, but of capital which cannot find investment, superinduced\r\nby stagnation of trade, and the want of commercial enterprise,\r\noccasioned by the restrictive nature of our duties on imports.--_Morning\r\nChronicle._\r\n\r\nThe accounts from the United States mention that the greatest activity\r\nprevails among the manufacturers in their purchases of the raw material\r\nfor the year's consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRAORDINARY CHARGE.--_Captain, William Tune_, the Commander of a steam\r\npacket called the _City of Boulogne_, the property of the New Commercial\r\nSteam-Packet Company, on Monday appeared at the Mansion House to answer\r\nthe complaint of the directors of that company, by whom he was charged\r\nwith being privy to the abstraction of four packages, each containing\r\ngold, checks on bankers, bank-notes, and bills of exchange, which had\r\nbeen previously booked at the company's office in Boulogne, and paid for\r\naccording to the rates agreed upon by the company, and which, with\r\nothers, had been entrusted to his care. After evidence had been adduced,\r\nMr Wire requested that Captain Tune should be remanded for a week, and\r\nstated that the directors being anxious that he should receive as much\r\naccommodation as might be consistent with the respectability of his\r\ncharacter and the nature of the difficulty in which he was at present\r\ninvolved, were desirous that bail should be taken for his appearance on\r\nthe next day of investigation.--Alderman Gibbs: I shall require two\r\nrespectable securities for 500_l._ each, and Captain Tune to be bound\r\nhimself in the sum of 1,000_l._--The captain was then remanded for a\r\nweek. A curious fact came out on the inquiry as to the value of each\r\npackage. They were all, it appeared, entered and paid for as containing\r\na sum of money much inferior to what each package really contained.\r\n\r\nMATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENTS.--An unlucky man, who, in order to get a\r\nfamily by a deceased wife taken care of, had been induced to marry a\r\nworthless drunken woman, through the medium of a matrimonial\r\nadvertisement, applied at Union Hall for advice, but, of course, nothing\r\ncould be done for him.\r\n\r\nAWKWARD PREDICAMENT.--A man advanced in years, named _David Simms_, who\r\nwas claimed by two wives, and nearly torn in pieces by them, was\r\ncommitted from Union Hall, on a charge of bigamy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSINGULAR DETECTION OF AN EXTENSIVE SWINDLER.--A man named _William\r\nCairnes_, alias _Thomas Sissons_, with a host of other _aliases_, was\r\nplaced before the magistrates at the Borough Court, Manchester, charged\r\nwith one of the most singular attempts at fraud we ever remember to have\r\nheard. The prisoner, who was a respectable-looking old man, gave his\r\nname _William Carnes_. Under the pretence of giving employment to a\r\nlabouring man, on getting specimens of his handwriting, he got him to\r\nwrite his name across two blank bills, in the form of acceptance. He has\r\nbeen remanded for further inquiry.\r\n\r\nEMBEZZLEMENT.--_Theodore Grumbrecht_, a confidential clerk in the\r\nextensive India house of Messrs Huth and Co., was arrested on board the\r\n_Bucephalus_, bound for New Zealand, whither he was going. The charge\r\nagainst him is extensive embezzlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS, OCCURRENCES, AND OFFENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGULAR ACCIDENT.--An accident occurred at Outwell on the 29th ult. A\r\nchild, three years old, went to play in a donkey cart, in which a rope\r\ncoiled and knotted had been placed to dry. The rope was doubled the\r\ngreater part of the way; and, being knotted, was full of steps or\r\nmeshes; in one of these the child got his head and unfortunately falling\r\nat the same time from the cart, which was propped up as if the donkey\r\nwere between the shafts, the rope caught on the hook in front of the\r\ncart, and held the child suspended a short distance from the ground. He\r\nwas found quite dead. An inquest was held on the body of the child, and\r\nthe jury returned a verdict of accidental death.--_Bury Post._\r\n\r\nAFFRAY WITH SOLDIERS.--On Tuesday the greatest excitement prevailed\r\nthroughout Westminster in consequence of repeated outbreaks between the\r\nmilitary and the lower, or perhaps we might with propriety say the\r\nlowest order of inhabitants of this populous district. The tumult having\r\ncontinued during the whole of the day it was anticipated, and justly,\r\nthat when night came on, it would increase rather than diminish,\r\nalthough during the whole of the afternoon various parties of the\r\nmilitary were seen searching for and escorting to the barracks, the\r\ndelinquent and disorderly soldiers engaged in the affray.\r\n\r\nFIRES IN THE METROPOLIS.--On Saturday night the greater portion of the\r\nextensive premises of Messrs Cleaseley, floor-cloth manufacturers, Grove\r\nstreet, Walworth common, were destroyed by fire.--On Monday morning the\r\nshop of Mr Crawcour, a tobacconist, Surrey place, Old Kent road, was\r\nburnt to the ground.--On Tuesday morning, about a quarter to four\r\no'clock, a city police constable discovered fire in the lower part of\r\nthe extensive premises, nearly rebuilt, of the Religious Tract Society,\r\nPaternoster row, through some unslacked lime having been left by the\r\nworkmen among some timber the previous night. To the vigilance of the\r\nofficer may justly be attributed the saving of much valuable property\r\nfrom destruction.\r\n\r\nFIRE AT BRISTOL.--The old Castle Tavern, Bristol, was burned on\r\nThursday, the 7th inst., and the landlord, who was an invalid, perished\r\nin the flames. The fire was caused by the carelessness of a niece, in\r\nattendance on the invalid, who set fire to the bed furniture\r\naccidentally with a candle. The little girl Lydia Groves, who so\r\ncourageously attempted to extinguish the bed curtains, has sunk under\r\nthe shock she then experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTING INTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDONCASTER MEETING.--This much-talked-of meeting commenced on Monday,\r\nSept. 11, at two o'clock precisely. The regulations, in every minor\r\ndetail, answered the purposes for which they were respectively intended;\r\nparticularly the one affecting those persons who have proved themselves\r\n\"defaulters,\" as such were refused admission to the stands, the ring,\r\nthe betting-rooms, and every other place under the jurisdiction of of\r\nthe stewards. Many improvements and alterations have been made, and no\r\nexpense spared towards securing the comfort of all. The different stands\r\nhave undergone a complete renovation, and present a very striking and\r\nhandsome appearance, very unlike their neglected condition in former\r\nyears. On Sunday evening a tremendous storm came on, accompanied with\r\nhail and extraordinarily vivid lightning; in fact, it was truly awful to\r\nwitness--the rain literally pouring down in torrents, and the flashes of\r\nlightning following each other in rapid succession. Happily the storm\r\nwas not of very long continuance, commencing about half-past six, and\r\nterminating about seven o'clock; but, during that short period, it was\r\nsufficient nearly to drown the \"unfortunates,\" who were travelling\r\noutside per coach from Sheffield, York, Leeds, &c., and who, on\r\nalighting, presented a most wretched appearance. The morning of Monday\r\nwas dark and lowering, but towards eleven or twelve o'clock the weather\r\ncleared up and remained very fine. The course, notwithstanding the rain,\r\nwas in the very best possible order, the attendance large, beyond any\r\nformer example on the first day, punctuality as to the time of starting\r\nwas very strictly observed, and the sport was first rate. The great\r\nevent of these races is the St Leger stakes, which on this occasion were\r\nrun for in three minutes and twenty seconds. Mr Bowes's \"Cotherstone,\"\r\nthe winner of the Derby, was the favourite, and was confidently expected\r\nto gain the St Leger. But it only came in second, being beaten by Mr\r\nWrather's Nutwith, and only gained by a neck on Lord Chesterfield's\r\nPrizefighter, which was third.\r\n\r\nWOOLWICH GARRISON RACES.--The officers of the garrison at Woolwich\r\nhaving resolved on testing the value and quality of their horses by\r\nraces, the first day's sport came off on Wednesday; and owing to the\r\ngreat number of spectators, of whom there were upwards of 10,000, on the\r\nground, and the fineness of the weather, the scene was more animated\r\nthan on any former occasion. A spacious booth was erected on the ground\r\nand was well filled throughout the day. Upwards of 100 carriages,\r\ncontaining families, were drawn up along both sides of the course, and\r\nhundreds of gentlemen on horseback occupied various parts of the Common\r\nwhere the races took place; presenting altogether an enlivening and\r\ninteresting spectacle. The band of the Royal Artillery attended in front\r\nof the booth, and played, with very little intermission, some of the\r\nfinest airs from one o'clock to seven o'clock, p.m.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the second day, a slight shower of rain, about one o'clock,\r\np.m. prevented the races from being so well attended by spectators as\r\nthey were yesterdy, yet the attendance was numerous in the afternoon,\r\nand great interest existed amongst the officers of the garrison, and\r\nmany sporting gentlemen, to witness the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST HOME MARKET.--The _Norwich Mercury_ of last Saturday contains\r\nno less than seventy advertisements relating to the sale of farming\r\nstock; and a majority of these are cases in which the tenant of the farm\r\non which a sale is announced is described as one \"quitting the\r\noccupation,\" or \"retiring from business.\" We should like to know how\r\nmany of those parties have managed to amass a fortune, or even to\r\nacquire a moderate competency, under that protective system which, as\r\nthey have always been taught to believe, was devised for their especial\r\nbenefit. From the ominous newspaper paragraphs, announcing the\r\nliberality of landlords to their tenants, which have lately become so\r\nnumerous, we rather suspect that most of those farmers who are retiring\r\nfrom business do so to avoid greater evils. It is worthy of remark,\r\nhowever, that, amidst all this agricultural depression, which has now\r\nlasted some twelve months at least, the \"home trade\"--which the\r\nadvocates of the corn law always describe as entirely dependent on the\r\nfarmers obtaining high prices for their grain--is in a healthier state\r\nthan it has been for several years past. The _Standard_ lately stated,\r\non the authority of a Mr Spackman, that the United Kingdom contained\r\n20,500,000 individuals dependent on agriculture, and only 6,500,000\r\nindividuals dependent on manufactures; and, as we have frequently seen\r\nthe same absurd statement brought forward at farmers' clubs as\r\n\"agricultural statistics,\" it is possible enough that many persons may\r\nhave been led to believe it. Those who do so, however, would find it\r\nrather difficult to explain, under such a division of the population,\r\nthe fact, that during four or five years of high prices, which the Duke\r\nof Buckingham designated \"agricultural prosperity,\" the 20,500,000 souls\r\nshould have been unable to create a brisk demand for manufactures; while\r\na single year of cheap provisions has done so much to improve trade, and\r\nrelieve the pressure from the shoulders of the labouring classes. Who\r\nthat looks at these two facts can have the slightest doubt in his mind\r\nas to what it is that makes the best home market?--_Manchester\r\nGuardian._\r\n\r\nCURIOUS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT.--The following novel and interesting\r\nexperiment has lately been successfully made by Mr A. Palmer, of Cheam,\r\nSurrey:--In July, 1842, he put one grain of wheat in a common\r\ngarden-pot. In August the same was divided into four plants, which in\r\nthree weeks were again divided into twelve plants. In September these\r\ntwelve plants were divided into thirty-two, which in November were\r\ndivided into fifty plants, and then placed in open ground. In July,\r\n1843, twelve of the plants failed, but the remaining thirty-eight were\r\nhealthy. On the 19th August they were cut down, and counted 1,972 stems,\r\nwith an average of fifty grains to a stem, giving an increase of 98,600.\r\nNow, if this be a practicable measure of planting wheat, it follows that\r\nmost of the grain now used for seed may be saved, and will infinitely\r\nmore than cover the extra expense of sowing, as the wheat plants can be\r\nraised by the labourer in his garden, his wife and children being\r\nemployed in dividing and transplanting them. One of the stems was rather\r\nmore than six feet long, and stout in proportion.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF WASTE LANDS.--EMPLOYMENT OF LABOURERS.--A paper was\r\nrecently laid before the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of\r\nEngland, by Lord Portman, which we think deserves a much greater degree\r\nof attention than we believe it has yet received, in that it shows to\r\nwhat a considerable extent waste lands may, without any very heavy\r\nexpenditure of money, be brought into profitable cultivation, and at the\r\nsame time, under a well-regulated system of spade husbandry, yield\r\nabundant employment to agricultural labourers and their families. The\r\nfollowing is the substance of the document referred to:--His lordship,\r\nwho has large estates in Dorsetshire, found that a tract of land, called\r\nShepherd's Corner, about 200 acres in extent, was wholly unproductive,\r\nyielding a nominal rent of 2s. 6d. per acre. About fifteen years ago his\r\nlordship resolved to make an experiment with this land. He accordingly\r\ngave directions to his steward that it should be laid out in six\r\ndivisions, representing so many small farms, in the cultivation of which\r\nsuch of the labourers as could not obtain full work from the\r\nneighbouring farmers were occasionally employed. For the three first\r\nyears there were no returns, the ground having been merely broken up\r\nwith the spade, and the surface soil exposed. In subsequent years this\r\nland was sown chiefly with turnips, fed off by sheep, until it was found\r\nin sufficient heart for the reception of grass and corn seeds, the\r\ncrops from which were at first scanty and indifferent, but sufficient,\r\nhowever, to pay for cultivation. At the expiration of fifteen years the\r\nexpenditure upon the whole, inclusive of allowance for rent, at the\r\noriginal rate of 2s. 6d. per acre, together with all charges on account\r\nof tithes and taxes, amounted to a little more than 10,000_l._; the\r\nreturns by crops sold and sheep fed exceeding that sum by 88_l._,\r\nindependent of the crops now in the ground, which will come to the\r\nlandlord in September. This may appear to be an inadequate return for\r\nthe fifteen years' experiment; but, as Lord Portman justly observes, \"as\r\na farmer he has lost nothing, whilst as landlord he is a considerable\r\ngainer, the land being now fully equal to any of the neighbouring\r\nfarms.\" Two objects, both of great importance, have thus been obtained.\r\nThese 200 acres have been fertilized, which would otherwise have been of\r\nno present or prospective value; and in the process of cultivation\r\nemployment has, during that long period, been provided for several\r\nhundreds of labourers who, but for that resource, must, at some seasons\r\nat least, have become a burden to the parish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR LIBRARY TABLE.\r\n\r\nFREE TRADE, RECIPROCITY, AND COLONIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Budget; a Series of Letters, published at intervals, addressed\r\n     to Lord John Russell, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and Lord\r\n     Eliot, on Import Duties, Commercial Reform, Colonization, and the\r\n     Condition of England._ By R. Torrens, Esq., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n     _The Edinburgh Review._ No. CLVII. Article, Free Trade and\r\n     Retaliation.\r\n\r\n     _The Westminster Review._ No. LXXVIII. Article, Colonel Torrens on\r\n     Free Trade.\r\n\r\nOur readers are not, in general, unacquainted with the public character\r\nand literary reputation of Colonel Torrens. He is, we believe, a\r\nself-taught political economist; and, like Colonel Thompson, early\r\nachieved distinction in a branch of moral science not considered\r\nparticularly akin to military pursuits. But in his recent labours, he\r\nhas very seriously damaged his reputation, by attempting to bolster up a\r\npolicy whose influence on the welfare of the nation has been of the most\r\ndeadly and pernicious kind; and we therefore advert to the letters\r\ncalled the _Budget_, more with the view of showing that they have been\r\nanalysed, and their mischievous principles thoroughly refuted, than with\r\nany intention of entering at large into the discussion.\r\n\r\nIt was, we believe, in the autumn of 1841, immediately following the\r\naccession of the present Government to office, that Colonel Torrens\r\ncommenced the publication of his letters called the _Budget_. The two\r\nfirst were addressed to Lord John Russell, and professed to show that\r\nthe commercial propositions of the late Whig Government would, if\r\nadopted, have altered the value of money, increased the pressure of\r\ntaxation, and aggravated the distress of the people. The third letter\r\nwas on commercial reform, addressed to Sir Robert Peel. The remainder of\r\nthe series were on colonization and taxation, on the expediency of\r\nadopting differential duties, &c.; concluding with one on the condition\r\nof England, and on the means of removing the causes of distress; which\r\nwas afterwards followed by a _Postscript_, in which the author,\r\naddressing Sir Robert Peel, said--\r\n\r\n     \"I would beg to submit to your consideration what appears to me to\r\n     amount to a mathematical demonstration, that a reduction of the\r\n     duties upon foreign production, unaccompanied by a corresponding\r\n     mitigation of the duties imposed by foreign countries upon British\r\n     goods, would cause a further decline of prices, of profits, and of\r\n     wages, and would render it doubtful whether the taxes could be\r\n     collected, and faith with the public credit or maintained.\"\r\n\r\nOpinions like these, coming from a man considered to be of some little\r\nauthority in economical science, were certainly important. The time was\r\nserious--the crisis really alarming. A new Government had come into\r\npower, and it was thought and expected were about to effect great\r\nchanges. Even the _Quarterly Review_, alarmed by the aspect of affairs,\r\ncame round, in the winter of 1841, to advocate commercial reform. At\r\nthis critical period Colonel Torrens stepped forward. What his motives\r\nwere we do not know; though we know that men neither harsh nor\r\nuncharitable, and with some opportunities of judging, considered that\r\nColonel Torrens, soured by political disappointments and personal\r\nfeeling, had permitted himself to be biassed by hopes of patronage from\r\nthe new Government. The pamphlets composing the _Budget_ only appeared\r\nat intervals: but so far as they were then published, did attract\r\nconsiderable attention; the mere supporters of pure monopoly did not, of\r\ncourse, understand them: but that body who may be appropriately enough\r\ntermed _middle men_, were not unaware of the value of such support as\r\nthat afforded by Colonel Torrens, in staring off changes which seemed\r\ninevitable. Sir Robert Peel, too, was then in the very midst of his\r\nlesson-taking; and as he deeply studied Mr Hume's Import Duties Report,\r\nbefore he brought out his new Tariff, we need not consider it to be very\r\ndiscreditable to him, that he read the pamphlets of Colonel Torrens\r\nbefore he tried his diplomatic commercial policy.\r\n\r\nAt all events, one of the chief arguments with which Sir Robert Peel and\r\nMr Gladstone justified the great omissions of the new Tariff, was the\r\nfact that the Government was engaged in negotiations with other\r\ncountries in order to obtain treaties of reciprocity. The utter failure\r\nof these efforts Sir Robert Peel has repeatedly confessed, accompanied\r\nwith a sigh over the inutility of the attempt; and the last time that he\r\nadverted, in the House of Commons, to the authority of Colonel Torrens\r\n(he was citing the _Postscript_ to the _Letter_ addressed to himself) it\r\nwas with the kind of manner which indicated want of confidence in the\r\nguide who had misled him. Whether or no, however, he had relied on that\r\nauthority in his negotiations with other countries during his futile\r\nattempts to obtain commercial treaties, this much is certain enough,\r\nthat Colonel Torrens did what he could to strengthen the old notion,\r\nthat it was of no use for us to enlarge our markets unless other\r\ncountries did so also at the same time and in the same way; and in\r\ncondemning all reduction of import duties that was not based on\r\n\"reciprocity,\" he certainly added all the weight of his authority to\r\nprop up a system whose injurious influence has affected the very\r\nvitality of our social state, and whose overthrow will yet require no\r\nsmall amount of moral force to effect.\r\n\r\nWe are far indeed, from undervaluing treaties of reciprocity; but to\r\nmake them a _sine qua non_ in the policy of a country whose condition is\r\nthat of an overflowing population, a deficient supply of the first\r\nnecessaries of life, and a contracted market for its artificial\r\nproductions, is an error of the first magnitude. Therefore, though not\r\nattaching primary importance to the _Budget_ of Colonel Torrens, or\r\nbelieving that it could ultimately have any great effect in retarding\r\nthe effectual settlement of the great question, it was not without some\r\nfeeling of satisfaction that we perused the able article in the last\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, in which his delusions are completely set at rest.\r\nWe quite agree with the writer (Mr Senior, it is said) that \"if the\r\n_Budget_ were to remain unanswered, it would be proclaimed in all the\r\nstrongholds of monopoly to which British literature penetrates--in\r\nParliament, in Congress, in the _Algemeine Zeitung_, and in the councils\r\nof the Zollverein--that Adam Smith and the modern economists had been\r\nrefuted by Colonel Torrens; that free trade is good only where\r\nreciprocity is perfect; that a nation can augment its wealth by\r\nrestraining a trade that was previously free; can protect itself against\r\nsuch conduct on the part of its neighbours only by retaliation: and if\r\nit neglect this retaliatory policy, that it will be punished for its\r\nliberality by a progressive decrease of prices, of wages, and of\r\nprofits, and an increase of taxation.\"\r\n\r\nThe identity of Colonel Torrens's propositions with the exploded\r\n\"Mercantile Theory\" is very satisfactorily established by the Edinburgh\r\nreviewer; and it is certainly humbling to see a man of his ability\r\ncoming forward to revive doctrines which had well nigh gone down to\r\noblivion. On the subject where Colonel Torrens conceives himself\r\nstrongest, the distribution of the precious metals, the reviewer has\r\ngiven a very able reply, though some points are left for future\r\namplification and discussion; and, as a whole, if there be any young\r\npolitical economist whose head the _Budget_ has puzzled, the article in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_ will be found a very sufficient antidote. With\r\nthis, and another able article on the same subject in the last\r\n_Westminster Review_ (in fact, two articles of the _Westminster_ relate\r\nto the subject--one is on Colonel Torrens, the other on Free Trade and\r\nColonization), we may very safely leave the _Budget_ to the oblivion\r\ninto which it has sunk; and, meantime, the novice will not go far astray\r\nwho adheres to the \"golden rule\" of political economy, propounded by the\r\nLondon merchants in 1820, and re-echoed by Sir Robert Peel in 1842: \"The\r\nmaxim of buying in the cheapest market, and selling in the dearest,\r\nwhich regulates every merchant in his individual dealings, is strictly\r\napplicable as the best rule for every nation. As a matter of mere\r\ndiplomacy, it may sometimes answer to hold out the removal of particular\r\nprohibitions or high duties as depending on corresponding concessions;\r\nbut it does not follow that we should maintain our restrictions where\r\nthe desired concessions cannot be obtained; for our restrictions would\r\nnot be the less prejudicial to our capital and industry, because other\r\ngovernments persisted in preserving impolitic regulations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEA.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JAMES CLARKE ROSS AND THE ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the newspapers have quoted an account from the _Literary Gazette_ of\r\nthe Antarctic Expedition, under the command of Captain James Ross. It\r\nwas composed of two vessels, the _Erebus_, Captain Ross, and the\r\n_Terror_, Captain Crozier, and left England on the 29th of September,\r\n1839. During the outward voyage to Australia, scientific observation was\r\ndaily and sedulously attended to; experiments were made on the\r\ntemperature and specific gravity of the sea; geological and geographical\r\ninvestigations were made at all available points, especially at\r\nKerguelen's Land; and both here, as well as during the expedition,\r\nmagnetic observation and experiment formed a specific subject of\r\nattention. This was a main object during 1840, the expedition remaining\r\nat the Auckland Islands for this purpose; and it was not till the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1841, that it entered the antarctic circle. Their subsequent\r\nadventures, deeply interesting as they are from the perils which they\r\nencountered, and the spirit and perseverance with which they were met,\r\ncome hardly within our sphere to report. After an absence of four years,\r\nthe expedition, as mentioned in last week's ECONOMIST, has returned to\r\nEngland, and the acquisitions to natural history, geology, geography,\r\nbut above all towards the elucidation of the grand mystery of\r\nterrestrial magnetism, raise this voyage to a pre-eminent rank among the\r\ngreatest achievements of British courage, intelligence, and enterprise.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS WORSHIP.--CHURCH PROPERTY.--The following Parliamentary Return\r\nhas just been printed, entitled, \"A Return of the amount applied by\r\nParliament during each year since 1800, in aid of the religious worship\r\nof the Church of England, of the Church of Scotland, of the Church of\r\nRome, and of the Protestant Dissenters in England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland, respectively, whether by way of augmentation of the income of\r\nthe ministers of each religious persuasion, or for the erection and\r\nendowment of churches and chapels, or for any other purposes connected\r\nwith the religious instruction of each such section of the population of\r\nthe United Kingdom, with a summary of the whole amount applied during\r\nthe above period in aid of the religions worship of each of the above\r\nclasses.\" The abstract of sums paid to the Established Church shows that\r\nthe total was 5,207,546_l._ which is divided in the following\r\nmanner:--Church of England, 2,935,646_l._; Church of Scotland,\r\n522,082_l._; Church of Ireland, 1,749,818_l._ Church of Rome.--The total\r\nsum paid to the Church of Rome is set forth at 365,607_l._ 1s. 2d.\r\ncomprised in the following two items;--Augmentation of incomes\r\n(including Maynooth College), 362,893_l._ 8s. 1d.; erection and repairs\r\nof chapels, 2,113_l._ 13s. 1d. Protestant Dissenters.--The total sum is\r\n1,019,647_l._ 13s. 11d. in England and Ireland. The recapitulation shows\r\nthe following three sums:--Established Church, 5,207,546_l._; Church of\r\nRome, 365,607_l._; and Protestant Dissenters, 1,019,647_l._ The sums\r\nwere advanced from 1800 to 1842.\r\n\r\nIMPERISHABLE BREAD.--On Wednesday, in the mayor's private room, at the\r\nTown hall, Liverpool, a box of bread was opened which was packed at Rio\r\nJaneiro nearly two years ago, and proved as sound, sweet, and in all\r\nrespects as good, as on the day when it was enclosed. This bread is\r\nmanufactured of a mixture in certain proportions of rice, meal, and\r\nwheat flour.\r\n\r\nST GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR.--The extensive alterations and\r\nembellishments which have been in progress since the early part of May\r\nlast (from which period the chapel has been closed), at an outlay of\r\nseveral thousands of pounds, throughout the interior of this sacred\r\nedifice, having been brought to a close, it was reopened for Divine\r\nservice on Thursday.\r\n\r\nFATHER MATHEW.--Father Mathew, after finishing his labours in the\r\nmetropolis, went to Norwich, where he met the Bishop, who, in an earnest\r\nand eloquent speech, in St Andrew's hall, on Thursday week, introduced\r\nthe reverend gentleman to that locality, and very warmly eulogized his\r\nconduct. Mr Gurney, the well-known Norwich banker, occupied the chair on\r\nthis occasion, and seconded the Bishop in his patronage and approbation\r\nof the great temperance movement. After remaining at Norwich two or\r\nthree days, Father Mathew started for Ireland, taking Birmingham and\r\nLiverpool in his way.\r\n\r\nIMPORTATION OF FRUIT FROM ANTWERP.--On Thursday, the steam-packet\r\n_Antwerpen_, Captain Jackson, arrived at the St Katherine's Steam Packet\r\nWharf, after an expeditious passage, from Antwerp. The continental\r\norchards continue to supply our fruit markets with large supplies, the\r\n_Antwerpen_ having brought 4,000 packages, or nearly 2,800 bushels of\r\npears, apples, plums, and filberts. Advices were received by the\r\n_Antwerpen_ that another extensive importation of fruit from Antwerp may\r\nbe expected at the St Katherine's Steam Packet Wharf this day\r\n(Saturday), by the steam-packet _Princess Victoria_, Capt. Pierce.\r\n\r\nLIEUT. HOLMAN, THE BLIND TRAVELLER.--This celebrated tourist and writer\r\ntook his departure from Malta, on the 3rd of September, for Naples. He\r\nwill afterwards proceed to the Roman States, and then to Trieste. During\r\nthe few days of his residence in this island the greatest hospitality\r\nhas been shown him. The veteran traveller had the honour of dining with\r\nhis excellency the Governor, and with Admiral Sir E. Owen. Amidst all\r\nthe vicissitudes of his perilous life and increasing age, he still\r\nmaintains the same unabated thirst for travel, and his mental and bodily\r\nfaculties appear to grow in activity and strength in the inverse ratio\r\nof his declining life and honoured grey hairs.\r\n\r\nRAILWAY FROM WORCESTER TO CARDIFF.--It is proposed, by means of this new\r\nline, to connect the population of the north of England and the midland\r\ncounties with the districts of South Wales and the south of Ireland. It\r\nwill commence at the Taff Vale Railway, pass through Wales, cross the\r\nSevern, and unite with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway at\r\nWorcester. The cost will be 1,500,000_l._\r\n\r\nFRENCH OPINIONS ON SPANISH EVENTS.--The French journals are loud in\r\ncondemning the poor Barcelonese for the very same acts which drew down\r\nthe applause of these same journals a week ago. The following remarks\r\nfrom the _National_ render any of our own useless:--\"It must be admitted\r\nthat the French journals appreciate in a strange way the deplorable\r\nevents in Spain. Some soldiers revolt at Madrid, without going any\r\nlength of insurrection, or at all endangering the Government. General\r\nNarvaez comes, and without consulting Government or any one else, shoots\r\neight non-commissioned officers. Straight our Ministerial journals\r\nexclaim, What an act of vigour! Vigour if you will; but where is the\r\nhumanity, the wisdom, the justice? Then behold Barcelona, of which the\r\npeople some weeks ago rose against the established and constitutional\r\nGovernment. What heroes! exclaimed the French Ministerial papers. Now\r\nthey do the same thing, rising against a provisional and\r\nextra-constitutional Government. What brigands! exclaim the Ministerial\r\nwriters. A few weeks back a Spanish Government defended itself with\r\nviolence against those who attacked it. Regiments fired rounds of\r\nmusketry, and the cannons of forts bombarded the rebellious towns. The\r\nFrench Ministerialists forthwith pronounced the Spanish Regent as a\r\nmalefactor, and devoted him to the execration of the civilized world.\r\nNow, another Government, without the same right, follows precisely the\r\nsame course as the one overthrown. It defends itself, fires, bombards,\r\nand pours forth grape from behind walls upon insurgent bands in the\r\nstreet. This same conduct is glorified as firm, as legitimate, as what\r\nnot. The system of political morality changes, it seems, with men and\r\nwith seasons. What was infamy in Espartero and Zurbano, is heroism and\r\nglory in Narvaez and Prim. What is more infamous than all this is the\r\npress, that thus displays itself in the light of a moral weathercock,\r\nshifting round to every wind.\"\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.--By a return just issued in\r\ncompliance with an order of the House of Commons relative to the City\r\nand Metropolitan Police Force, it appears that there are 20\r\nsuperintendents in the metropolitan division, receiving from 200_l._ to\r\n600_l._ per annum; 110 inspectors, whose salaries vary from 80_l._ to\r\n200_l._ per annum; 465 sergeants, with incomes ranging from 60_l._ to\r\n80_l._ per annum; and 3,790 constables, receiving from 44_l._ to 81_l._\r\nper annum, including clothing and 40 pounds of coal weekly throughout\r\nthe year. The amount paid on this account during the past year,\r\nincluding 3,620_l._ for superannuation and retiring allowances to\r\nofficers and constables late of Bow-street horse patrol, and Thames\r\npolice, amounted to 295,754_l._ In this is likewise included a sum of\r\n9,721_l._ received from theatres, fairs, and races. The number of\r\ndistrict surgeons is 60, and the amount paid for books, &c., is 757_l._\r\nThe total rate received during the past year from the various wards in\r\nthe City of London and its liberties, for the maintenance of the City\r\nPolice Force, is put down at 41,714_l._, and the expenditure at\r\n41,315_l._, the gross pay, irrespective of other charges to the force,\r\namounting to 29,800_l._\r\n\r\nLOSS OF THE UNITED STATES STEAM FRIGATE \"MISSOURI,\" AT GIBRALTAR, BY\r\nFIRE.--The superb American steam frigate _Missouri_, which was conveying\r\nthe Hon. Caleb Cushing, American minister at China, to Alexandra, whilst\r\nat anchor in Gibraltar bay, on the 26th ult., was entirely consumed by\r\nfire. The fire broke out in the night, and raged with such determined\r\nfury as to baffle all the efforts of the crew, as well as that of the\r\nassistance sent from her Majesty's ship _Malabar_, and from the\r\ngarrison. The magazines were flooded soon after the commencement of the\r\nfire; and, although a great many shells burst, yet, very fortunately, no\r\naccident happened to any of the crew. This splendid steamer was 2,600\r\ntons and 600 horse power, and is said to have cost 600,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nTHE ALLEGED ARREST OF THE MURDERER OF MR DADD.--The following are the\r\nremarks of _Galignani's Messenger_ on the report in the English papers\r\nthat Dadd was arrested at Fontainbleau:--\"The above statement has been\r\npartially rumoured in town for the last two days, but not in a shape to\r\nwarrant our publishing it in the _Messenger_. The police have been\r\neverywhere active in their researches for the fugitive; and we perceive,\r\nby the _Courrier de Lyons_, that, on Thursday night, all the hotels in\r\nthat city were visited by their agents, in pursuit of two Englishmen,\r\none of them supposed to be the unfortunate lunatic. These individuals\r\nhad, however, quitted the town on their way to Geneva, previously to the\r\nvisit of the police.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CARTOONS.--We understand that several of the prize cartoons, and a\r\nselection of some of the most interesting of the works of the\r\nunsuccessful competitors, have been removed from Westminster hall to the\r\ngallery of the Pantechnicon, Belgrave square, for further exhibition.\r\n\r\nMACKEREL.--The Halifax papers state that the coast of Nova Scotia is now\r\nvisited by mackerel and herrings in larger quantities than ever were\r\nknown at this season. In the straits of Canso the people are taking them\r\nwith seines, a circumstance without a parralel for the last 30 years.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal des Chemins de Fer_ says:--\"An inventor announces that he\r\nhas found a composition which will reduce to a mere trifle the price of\r\nrails for railroads. He replaces the iron by a combination of Kaolin\r\nclay (that used for making pottery and china) with a certain metallic\r\nsubstance, which gives a body so hard as to wear out iron, without being\r\ninjured by it in turn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIDAY NIGHT.--We are still without the arrival of the Indian Mail, nor\r\nhas any explanation of its detention transpired, except that which we\r\nmentioned last week. No serious apprehension exists for its safety, as\r\nsimilar detentions, of even much greater duration, have been experienced\r\nin the arrival of the September Mail in former years, as a consequence\r\nof the monsoon.\r\n\r\nIn Manchester, during the week, the market has been somewhat flatter in\r\ngoods suited for the Eastern markets, in consequence of merchants being\r\nanxious to receive their advices by the Indian Mail before extending\r\ntheir transactions materially at present prices. In the Yorkshire\r\nwoollen markets a fair trade continues to be done; and in Bradford a\r\nvery active demand has arisen for the goods peculiar to that\r\nneighbourhood. In the Scotch seats of manufactures, both woollen and\r\ncotton, the trade has considerably improved, especially in the demand\r\nfor tartans of all kinds, in which there is a very active and brisk\r\ntrade. In the iron districts, the trade continues without change since\r\nour last: most of the works are full of orders, at low prices. In the\r\ncoal districts, in Northumberland and Durham, trade is without any\r\nimprovement whatever, and this trade, as well as their shipping, is in\r\nthe most depressed condition.\r\n\r\n_INDIGO._--The transactions in this article have not been on a more\r\nextensive scale in our market than last week, but a good demand\r\ncontinues for the home trade, and occasionally a small advance upon the\r\nlast July rates is paid on such sorts suitable for that branch, but\r\nthere is almost no demand for export, the consumption of the article in\r\nforeign countries being this year unusually slack. The shipments to\r\nRussia, since the opening of the season, amount to only 2,209 chests,\r\nagainst 3,439 chests during the same time last year. A public sale was\r\nheld yesterday, in Liverpool, of about 400 chests of East India, and 120\r\nserons of Caracas. Of the former about 100 chests were withdrawn by the\r\npoprietors, but the remainder, together with the serons, sold briskly\r\nfor the home trade, at prices about 3d. to 4d. per lb. higher than the\r\nprevious nominal value, and rather above that of the London market.\r\nThere are now 6,070 chests declared for the quarterly sale on the 10th\r\nof October; a great portion of it consists of good shipping sorts. It is\r\nsupposed that several thousand chests more will be declared upon arrival\r\nof the Indian Mail, now due.\r\n\r\n_COCHINEAL._--Only two small public sales were held this week, together\r\nof 97 serons. The first consisted of 30 serons Mexican, mostly silver,\r\nwhich sold at prices from 2d. to 3d. per lb. higher than those of last\r\nweek. The lowest price for ordinary foxy silver was 4s. 4d. per lb. The\r\nsecond sale was held at higher prices still, in consequence of which the\r\nwhole quantity was bought in.\r\n\r\n_COTTON._--The purchases at Liverpool, for this week, will again reach\r\nthe large quantity of about 40,000 bales, of which a considerable\r\nproportion is on speculation. Prices have been extremely firm, without\r\nany decided advance, however, there not being much importance attached,\r\nor faith given, to the statements that the American crop has suffered,\r\nwhich have been received by the Halifax and New York steamers, up to 1st\r\ninst. from the latter place.\r\n\r\nIn this market, business by private contract is again trifling. At\r\npublic sales there have been offered 714 bales American, and 3,796 bales\r\nSurat; the former were held considerably above the value, and only 30\r\nbales good fair were sold at 4-3/4d. in bond. Of the Surat about 2,300\r\nbales found buyers, from 2-7/8d. to 3-1/8d. for middling, to 3-3/8d. to\r\n3-1/2d. for fair; a few lots superior went at 3-5/8d. for good fair, and\r\n4d. per lb. for good. The prices paid show an advance of 1/8d. to 1/4d.\r\na lb. upon the last public sales of 24th August, and sustain the\r\nprevious market rates, though the highest advance was conceded\r\nreluctantly, and not in many instances; there are buyers for low-priced\r\ncotton of every description, but there is little of it offering.\r\n\r\n_SUGAR._--The purchases for home consumption have been upon a limited\r\nscale, and prices barely maintained. The same remark applies to foreign\r\nsugar. Only one cargo of Porto Rico sugar has been sold afloat, for a\r\nnear port, at 18s., with conditions favourable to the buyer. At public\r\nsale 630 chests Bahia, and 120 chests, and 240 barrels Pernambuco, were\r\nalmost entirely bought in at extreme rates: since when only about 170\r\nchests of the brown Bahia have been placed at an average of 17s. 6d.,\r\nand with 50 chests of the lowest white at 21s. to 21s. 6d.; by private\r\ncontract 300 chests old yellow Havannah, of good quality, sold at 20s.\r\n\r\n_COFFEE._--The home demand remains good; good and fine Jamaica fetched\r\nprevious rates; a parcel of Ceylon, of somewhat better quality than the\r\ncommon run, sold at 51s. to 52s., which is rather dearer: very good\r\nSingapore Java sold at 36s. to 40s. In foreign Coffee a cargo of St\r\nDomingo has been sold afloat for Flanders at 26s. 6d. Two others being\r\nheld above that price without finding a buyer, they have been sent on\r\nunsold. On the spot the transactions in coffee for export by private\r\ncontract are quite insignificant, and of 650 bags old St Domingo _via_\r\nCape, only a small proportion sold at 28s. to 30s. for pale bold good\r\nordinary.\r\n\r\n_RICE._--About 4,000 bags of Bengal offered at public sale sold from\r\n10s. to 11s. per cwt., establishing a decline of 3d. per cwt.\r\n\r\n_SALTPETRE._--The market is sparingly supplied, and importers do not\r\nsell except upon extreme rates, which have been paid for about 3,000\r\nbags, viz. from 23s. 6d. for very ordinary, to 25s. 6d. for good\r\nmiddling.\r\n\r\n_CASSIA LIGNEA._--For small parcels offering in public sale full prices\r\nhave been paid; fine by private contract as high as 70s.\r\n\r\n_PIMENTO._--Fair quality has been sold 2-1/2d. to 2-5/8d., which is\r\nrather dearer.\r\n\r\n_TALLOW._--The demand on the spot is not improved and the price\r\nunaltered, 41s. 9d. to 42s.; for forward delivery there is rather more\r\ndisposition to purchase.\r\n\r\n_RUM._--The demand is very limited, except for the finest qualities of\r\nJamaica, and common are rather cheaper.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN.\r\n\r\nThe accounts received from the United States up to the first of this\r\nmonth by the _Hibernia_ and _Great Western_ are favourable as regards\r\ncommerce. The manufactories in the Union are reported to be in a state\r\nof considerable prosperity, notwithstanding which the demand for imports\r\nwas increasing. The reports about the cotton crops were various; it was\r\nadmitted that the weather had latterly been favourable. Large arrivals\r\nof wheat and flour were expected in the ports from the West.\r\n\r\nThe commercial reports received this week from the continent of Europe\r\ndo not show any great activity in foreign markets, though the prices of\r\nColonial produce are well maintained. Sugar was somewhat more in demand\r\nboth at Antwerp and Hamburg. In Coffee there was rather less doing at\r\nboth places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  PRICES CURRENT, SEPT. 16, 1843.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------+-----------\r\n  ENGLISH FUNDS.                            |  PRICES\r\n                                            | THIS DAY.\r\n  ------------------------------------------+-----------\r\n  India Stock                               |  266\r\n  3 per Cent.

The wind, what little there is of it, is\r\nnorth. The arrivals during last week were moderate except of Foreign\r\nWheat and Barley, of which of course there is yet some quantity to\r\narrive. The new English Wheat coming soft in hand, is slow sale at 1s.\r\nto 2s. reduction--free Foreign finds buyers for mixing at last week's\r\ncurrency. Barley is dull sale at last week's rates. Oats are 6d. to 1s.\r\nlower. Some new Irish have appeared of fine quality. There is no change\r\nin Beans and Peas.

In Ireland and Scotland there was a\r\ngood deal of rain on Sunday and Monday, which (we understand) stopped\r\nthe harvest work for the time, but we hope by this time they have it\r\nfine again. The new English Wheat comes to hand softer and lighter than\r\nat first; as usual after being stacked, the yield is much complained of,\r\nbesides that many of the stacks got so soaked by the heavy rains of the\r\n21st and 23rd of August, that the condition of the Wheat is sadly\r\nspoiled. The arrivals are moderate this week, except of Irish Oats,\r\nseveral small parcels of which are of the new crop; there is also a\r\nsmall parcel of new Scotch Barley in fine condition, and new Scotch\r\nOats, also good. Almost all the Wheat has been entered at the 14s. duty;\r\nwe believe it is over 300,000 qrs. New English Wheat is dull sale:\r\nForeign, on the other hand, is more inquired for, and not to be\r\npurchased in any quantity except at 1s. advance. Barley is saleable in\r\nretail at Monday's prices. Oats are again 6d. cheaper than on Monday,\r\nexcept for very fine samples. The averages lead us to suppose that on\r\nthe 21st instant the duty on Foreign Wheat will rise to 16s. per qr.; on\r\nBarley it will remain 6s.; on Oats 6s.; on Rye it will rise to 9s. 6d.;\r\non Beans it will remain 10s. 6d.; and on Peas, 9s. 6d.\r\n\r\nLONDON AVERAGES.\r\n\r\nFor the week ending September 12.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Wheat.

It appears that London\r\nis clear of meat, the which, with small supplies of everything to-day,\r\nis the sole immediate cause of the improvement, for, notwithstanding\r\nthat the market was well attended by both town and country butchers and\r\nstock-takers, they, nevertheless, at the opening of the market, appeared\r\ndisposed to purchase briskly, on the supposition, according to the\r\nreturns of over-night, that the supplies were large, but when this\r\nstatement was discovered to be erroneous they then bought freely, and\r\nhigher prices were more readily given.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY.--In consequence of the supply of beasts on sale being large for\r\nthe time of year, we have to report a very heavy demand for beef, and in\r\nsome instances the quotations declined 2d. per 8 lbs. From Scotland\r\nnearly 200 lots were received fresh up. Prime old downs maintained their\r\nprevious value; but that of all other kinds of sheep had a downward\r\ntendency. In lambs very little was doing, at barely Monday's\r\nquotations. Calves moved off heavily, at a reduction of 2d. per 8 lbs.\r\nThe pork trade was unusually dull, at previous currencies. Milch cows\r\nsold slowly at from 16_l._ to 20_l._ each.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n             Prices per Stone.           |           At Market.\r\n-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------\r\n           Monday.

In this state of inactivity\r\nthe effects of the Metropolitan Total Abstinence movement was a topic of\r\ninterest to the trade. As it appears that nearly 70,000 persons took the\r\npledge, the consumption of malt liquor must seriously diminished, and\r\nthe demand for Hops will consequently be very considerably decreased. It\r\nis fortunate, therefore, for the planters that this year's growth is not\r\nlarge, otherwise the prices would have been seriously low, and although\r\nthat crop is not only about an average, yet from this diminished\r\nconsumption, which is likely to progress, the value of the new will not\r\nbe more than last year, and possibly even less. There have been a few\r\nsmall lots of 1843's at market, which go off very slowly.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY.--About ten pockets of new hops have been disposed of this week\r\nat from 7_l._ to 8_l._ per cwt. We are now almost daily expecting large\r\nsupplied from Kent and Sussex, as picking is now going on rapidly. In\r\nold hops scarcely any business is doing, while the duty is called\r\n150,000_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL COTTON MARKET.\r\n\r\nSEPT. 14.--A large amount of business has been transacted in cotton at\r\nthis day's market.

Take,\r\nfor instance, the case of a person at the age of Thirty, who, by the\r\npayment of 5_l._ 3s. 4d. to the Britannia Life Assurance Company, can\r\nbecome at once possessed of a bequeathable property, amounting to\r\n1,000_l._, subject only to the condition of his continuing the same\r\npayment quarterly during the remainder of his life--a condition which\r\nmay be fulfilled by the mere saving of Eight Shillings weekly in his\r\nexpenditure. Thus, by the exertion of a very slight degree of\r\neconomy--such indeed, as can scarcely be felt as an inconvenience, he\r\nmay at once realise a capital of 1,000_l._, which he can bequeath or\r\ndispose of in any way he may think proper.\r\n\r\nA Table of Decreasing Rates of Premium on a novel and remarkable plan;\r\nthe Policy-holder having the option of discontinuing the payment of all\r\nfurther Premiums after Twenty, Fifteen, Ten, and even Five years; and\r\nthe Policy still remaining in force--in the first case, for the full\r\namount originally assured; and in either of the three other cases, for a\r\nportion of the same according to a fixed and equitable scale endorsed\r\nupon the Policy.\r\n\r\nIncreasing Rates of Premium on a new and remarkable plan for securing\r\nLoans or Debts; a less immediate payment being required on a Policy for\r\nthe whole term of Life than in any other Office.\r\n\r\nAge of the Assured in every case admitted in the Policy.\r\n\r\nAll claims payable within one Month after proof of death.\r\n\r\nMedical Attendants remunerated in all cases for their reports.\r\n\r\n     Extract from Increasing Rates of Premium, for an Assurance of\r\n     100_l._ for Whole Term of Life.\r\n\r\n  -----+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n       |            Annual Premiums payable during                 |\r\n       +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n       | 1st  Five | 2nd  Five | 3rd  Five | 4th  Five | Remainder |\r\n   Age |  Years.   |  Years.   |  Years.   |  Years.   |  of Life. |\r\n  -----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n       | £.  s.  d.| £.  s.  d.| £.  s.  d.| £.  s.  d.| £.  s.  d.|\r\n    20 | 1   1   4 | 1   5  10 | 1  10  11 | 1  16   9 | 2   3   8 |\r\n    30 | 1   6   4 | 1  12   2 | 1  19   1 | 2   7   4 | 2  17   6 |\r\n    40 | 1  16   1 | 2   4   4 | 2  14   6 | 3   7   3 | 4   3   4 |\r\n    50 | 2  16   7 | 3   9   4 | 4   5   5 | 5   6   3 | 6  13   7 |\r\n  -----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nDetailed Prospectuses, and every requisite information as to the mode of\r\neffecting Assurances, may be obtained at the Office.\r\n\r\n  PETER MORRISON, Resident Director.\r\n\r\n*** A Board of Directors attend daily at Two o'clock, for the\r\ndespatch of Business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPANCLIBANON IRON WORKS, BAZAAR, No. 58 BAKER STREET, PORTMAN SQUARE.\r\nLONDON.--Gentlemen about to furnish, or going abroad, will find it worth\r\ntheir attention to look into the above Establishment, where they will\r\nfind the largest assortment of General Furnishing Ironmongery ever\r\noffered to the Public, consisting of tin, copper, and iron cooking\r\nutensils, table cutlery, best Shffield plate, German silver wares,\r\npapier machee tea trays, tea and coffee urns, stove grates, kitchen\r\nranges, fenders and fire-irons, baths of all kinds, shower, hot, cold,\r\nvapour, plunging, &c.

The numberless instances daily\r\noccurring, wherein affections of the lungs, putting on all the outer\r\nappearances of consumption, which, however, when traced to their source,\r\nare found to result from certain baneful habits, fully proves that the\r\nprinciple of the division of labour is nowhere more applicable than in\r\nmedical practice.

WILLIAMS AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n(Abridged from the Liverpool Albion.)\r\n\r\nThis was an action for an infringement of a patent for the paving of\r\nroads, streets, &c. with timber or wooden blocks. Mr Martin and Mr\r\nWebster were for the plaintiff; Mr Warren and Mr Hoggins for the\r\ndefendants; Mr John Duncan, of 72 Lombard street, was the solicitor for\r\nthe plaintiff.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff is Mr David Stead, formerly a merchant of the City of\r\nLondon; the defendants are, nominally, Mr Lewis Williams, and several\r\nothers, who are the surveyors of streets and paving at Manchester; but\r\nthe action was really against the Metropolitan Wood Paving Company.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1836 or 1837 Mr Nystrom, a Russian merchant, with whom Mr\r\nStead had had transactions in business came to England, having whilst in\r\nRussia devoted his attention to the mode of pavement in that country,\r\nwhich was done in a great measure by wood. He communicated with Mr\r\nStead, who paid a great deal of attention to the matter, and materially\r\nimproved the scheme; and it was the intention of Mr Nystrom and Mr\r\nStead, in 1835 or 1837, to take out a patent, but Mr Nystrom found it\r\nnecessary to return to Russia, and thus frustrated that intention.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of May, 1838, the plaintiff, however, took out a patent, and\r\nthis was the one to which attention was directed. Four months were\r\nallowed for inrolment, but as six months was the usual period, the\r\nplaintiff imagined that that would be the period allowed to him, and\r\ninadvertently allowed the four months to elapse before he discovered his\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of June, 1841, however, an Act of Parliament was passed,\r\nconfirming the patent to Mr Stead, as though it had been regularly filed\r\nwithin the prescribed period. A second patent was afterwards obtained,\r\nbut that related more particularly to the form of blocks. The first\r\npatent, which had been infringed, was for an invention consisting of a\r\nmode of paving with blocks of similar sizes and dimensions, of either a\r\nsexagonal, triangular, or square form, so as to make a level road or\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe defendants pleaded, amongst other things, that the patent was not an\r\noriginal invention; that it was not useful; and that it was in use prior\r\nto the granting of the patent.\r\n\r\nThe Jury retired to consult at a quarter past four, and returned at\r\ntwenty minutes to six o'clock with a verdict for the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPARSONS'S ALEPPO OFFICE WRITING INK.--This very superior Ink, being made\r\nwith pure Aleppo Galls, is equally adapted for Quills and Steel Pens,\r\nand combines the requisite qualities of Incorrodibility and Permanency\r\nof Colour with an easy flow from the Pen.
