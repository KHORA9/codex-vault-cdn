THE RISE OF THE PARTY\r\n\r\nThe party system is an essential instrument of Democracy. Wherever\r\ngovernment rests upon the popular will, there the party is the organ of\r\nexpression and the agency of the ultimate power. The party is, moreover,\r\na forerunner of Democracy, for parties have everywhere preceded free\r\ngovernment. Long before Democracy as now understood was anywhere\r\nestablished, long before the American colonies became the United\r\nStates, England was divided between Tory and Whig. And it was only after\r\ncenturies of bitter political strife, during which a change of ministry\r\nwould not infrequently be accompanied by bloodshed or voluntary exile,\r\nthat England finally emerged with a government deriving its powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the party, both as a forerunner and as a necessary\r\norgan of Democracy, are well exemplified in American experience. Before\r\nthe Revolution, Tory and Whig were party names used in the colonies to\r\ndesignate in a rough way two ideals of political doctrine. The Tories\r\nbelieved in the supremacy of the Executive, or the King; the Whigs in\r\nthe supremacy of Parliament. The Tories, by their rigorous and ruthless\r\nacts giving effect to the will of an un-English King, soon drove the\r\nWhigs in the colonies to revolt, and by the time of the Stamp Act (1765)\r\na well-knit party of colonial patriots was organized through committees\r\nof correspondence and under the stimulus of local clubs called \"Sons of\r\nLiberty.\" Within a few years, these patriots became the Revolutionists,\r\nand the Tories became the Loyalists. As always happens in a successful\r\nrevolution, the party of opposition vanished, and when the peace of\r\n1783 finally put the stamp of reality upon the Declaration of 1776, the\r\npatriot party had won its cause and had served its day.\r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter a new issue, and a very significant one, began to\r\ndivide the thought of the people. The Articles of Confederation, adopted\r\nas a form of government by the States during a lull in the nationalistic\r\nfervor, had utterly failed to perform the functions of a national\r\ngovernment. Financially the Confederation was a beggar at the doors of\r\nthe States; commercially it was impotent; politically it was bankrupt.\r\nThe new issue was the formation of a national government that should in\r\nreality represent a federal nation, not a collection of touchy States.\r\nWashington in his farewell letter to the American people at the close of\r\nthe war (1783) urged four considerations: a strong central government,\r\nthe payment of the national debt, a well-organized militia, and the\r\nsurrender by each State of certain local privileges for the good of the\r\nwhole. His \"legacy,\" as this letter came to be called, thus bequeathed\r\nto us Nationalism, fortified on the one hand by Honor and on the other\r\nby Preparedness.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation floundered in the slough of inadequacy for several\r\nyears, however, before the people were sufficiently impressed with the\r\nnecessity of a federal government. When, finally, through the adroit\r\nmaneuver of Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, the Constitutional\r\nConvention was called in 1787, the people were in a somewhat chastened\r\nmood, and delegates were sent to the Convention from all the States\r\nexcept Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the delegates convened and chosen George Washington as\r\npresiding officer, than the two opposing sides of opinion were revealed,\r\nthe nationalist and the particularist, represented by the Federalists\r\nand the Anti-Federalists, as they later termed themselves. The\r\nConvention, however, was formed of the conservative leaders of the\r\nStates, and its completed work contained in a large measure, in spite\r\nof the great compromises, the ideas of the Federalists. This achievement\r\nwas made possible by the absence from the Convention of the two types of\r\nmen who were to prove the greatest enemy of the new document when it was\r\npresented for popular approval, namely, the office-holder or politician,\r\nwho feared that the establishment of a central government would deprive\r\nhim of his influence, and the popular demagogue, who viewed with\r\nsuspicion all evidence of organized authority. It was these two\r\ntypes, joined by a third--the conscientious objector--who formed the\r\nAntiFederalist party to oppose the adoption of the new Constitution.\r\nHad this opposition been well-organized, it could unquestionably have\r\ndefeated the Constitution, even against its brilliant protagonists,\r\nHamilton, Madison, Jay, and a score of other masterly men.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous choice of Washington for President gave the new Government\r\na non-partizan initiation. In every way Washington attempted to foster\r\nthe spirit of an undivided household. He warned his countrymen against\r\npartizanship and sinister political societies. But he called around\r\nhis council board talents which represented incompatible ideals\r\nof government. Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State, and\r\nAlexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, might for a\r\ntime unite their energies under the wise chieftainship of Washington,\r\nbut their political principles could never be merged. And when,\r\nfinally, Jefferson resigned, he became forthwith the leader of the\r\nopposition--not to Washington, but to Federalism as interpreted by\r\nHamilton, John Adams, and Jay.\r\n\r\nThe name Anti-Federalist lost its aptness after the inauguration of\r\nthe Government. Jefferson and his school were not opposed to a federal\r\ngovernment. They were opposed only to its pretensions, to its assumption\r\nof centralized power. Their deep faith in popular control is revealed in\r\nthe name they assumed, Democratic-Republican. They were eager to limit\r\nthe federal power to the glorification of the States; the Federalists\r\nwere ambitious to expand the federal power at the expense of localism.\r\nThis is what Jefferson meant when he wrote to Washington as early as\r\n1792, \"The Republican party wish to preserve the Government in its\r\npresent form.\" Now this is a very definite and fundamental distinction.\r\nIt involves the political difference between government by the people\r\nand government by the representatives of the people, and the practical\r\ndifference between a government by law and a government by mass-meeting.\r\n\r\nJefferson was a master organizer. At letter-writing, the one means of\r\ncommunication in those days, he was a Hercules. His pen never\r\nwearied. He soon had a compact party. It included not only most of the\r\nAnti-Federalists, but the small politicians, the tradesmen and artisans,\r\nwho had worked themselves into a ridiculous frenzy over the French\r\nRevolution and who despised Washington for his noble neutrality. But\r\nmore than these, Jefferson won over a number of distinguished men who\r\nhad worked for the adoption of the Constitution, the ablest of whom was\r\nJames Madison, often called \"the Father of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonians, thus representing largely the debtor and farmer\r\nclass, led by men of conspicuous abilities, proceeded to batter down the\r\nprestige of the Federalists. They declared themselves opposed to large\r\nexpenditures of public funds, to eager exploitation of government\r\nventures, to the Bank, and to the Navy, which they termed \"the great\r\nbeast with the great belly.\" The Federalists included the commercial\r\nand creditor class and that fine element in American life composed\r\nof leading families with whom domination was an instinct, all led,\r\nfortunately, by a few idealists of rare intellectual attainments. And,\r\nwith the political stupidity often characteristic of their class, they\r\nstumbled from blunder to blunder. In 1800 Thomas Jefferson, who adroitly\r\ncoined the mistakes of his opponents into political currency for\r\nhimself, was elected President. He had received no more electoral votes\r\nthan Aaron Burr, that mysterious character in our early politics, but\r\nthe election was decided by the House of Representatives, where, after\r\nseven days' balloting, several Federalists, choosing what to them was\r\nthe lesser of two evils, cast the deciding votes for Jefferson. When the\r\nJeffersonians came to power, they no longer opposed federal pretensions;\r\nthey now, by one of those strange veerings often found in American\r\npolitics, began to give a liberal interpretation to the Constitution,\r\nwhile the Federalists with equal inconsistency became strict\r\nconstructionists. Even Jefferson was ready to sacrifice his theory of\r\nstrict construction in order to acquire the province of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonians now made several concessions to the manufacturers,\r\nand with their support linked to that of the agriculturists Jeffersonian\r\ndemocracy flourished without any potent opposition. The second war with\r\nEngland lent it a doubtful luster but the years immediately following\r\nthe war restored public confidence. Trade flourished on the sea. The\r\nfrontier was rapidly pushed to the Mississippi and beyond into the vast\r\nempire which Jefferson had purchased. When everyone is busy, no one\r\ncares for political issues, especially those based upon philosophical\r\ndifferences. So Madison and Monroe succeeded to the political regency\r\nwhich is known as the Virginia Dynasty.\r\n\r\nThis complacent epoch culminated in Monroe's \"Era of Good Feeling,\"\r\nwhich proved to be only the hush before the tornado. The election of\r\n1824 was indecisive, and the House of Representatives was for a second\r\ntime called upon to decide the national choice. The candidates were John\r\nQuincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and William H. Crawford. Clay\r\nthrew his votes to Adams, who was elected, thereby arousing the wrath of\r\nJackson and of the stalwart and irreconcilable frontiersmen who hailed\r\nhim as their leader. The Adams term merely marked a transition from the\r\nold order to the new, from Jeffersonian to Jacksonian democracy. Then\r\nwas the word Republican dropped from the party name, and Democrat became\r\nan appellation of definite and practical significance.\r\n\r\nBy this time many of the older States had removed the early restrictions\r\nupon voting, and the new States carved out of the West had written\r\nmanhood suffrage into their constitutions. This new democracy flocked to\r\nits imperator; and Jackson entered his capital in triumph, followed by a\r\nmotley crowd of frontiersmen in coonskin caps, farmers in butternut-dyed\r\nhomespun, and hungry henchmen eager for the spoils. For Jackson had let\r\nit be known that he considered his election a mandate by the people to\r\nfill the offices with his political adherents.\r\n\r\nSo the Democrats began their new lease of life with an orgy of spoils.\r\n\"Anybody is good enough for any job\" was the favorite watchword.\r\nBut underneath this turmoil of desire for office, significant party\r\ndifferences were shaping themselves. Henry Clay, the alluring orator\r\nand master of compromise, brought together a coalition of opposing\r\nfragments. He and his following objected to Jackson's assumption of vast\r\nexecutive prerogatives, and in a brilliant speech in the Senate Clay\r\nespoused the name Whig. Having explained the origin of the term in\r\nEnglish and colonial politics, he cried: \"And what is the present but\r\nthe same contest in another form? The partizans of the present Executive\r\nsustain his favor in the most boundless extent. The Whigs are opposing\r\nexecutive encroachment and a most alarming extension of executive power\r\nand prerogative. They are contending for the rights of the people, for\r\nfree institutions, for the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws.\"\r\n\r\nThere soon appeared three practical issues which forced the new\r\nalignment. The first was the Bank. The charter of the United States Bank\r\nwas about to expire, and its friends sought a renewal. Jackson\r\nbelieved the Bank an enemy of the Republic, as its officers were\r\nanti-Jacksonians, and he promptly vetoed the bill extending the charter.\r\nThe second issue was the tariff. Protection was not new; but Clay\r\nadroitly renamed it, calling it \"the American system.\" It was popular in\r\nthe manufacturing towns and in portions of the agricultural communities,\r\nbut was bitterly opposed by the slave-owning States.\r\n\r\nA third issue dealt with internal improvements. All parts of the country\r\nwere feeling the need of better means of communication, especially\r\nbetween the West and the East. Canals and turnpikes were projected in\r\nevery direction. Clay, whose imagination was fervid, advocated a vast\r\nsystem of canals and roads financed by national aid. But the doctrine of\r\nstates-rights answered that the Federal Government had no power to enter\r\na State, even to spend money on improvements, without the consent of\r\nthat State. And, at all events, for Clay to espouse was for Jackson to\r\noppose.\r\n\r\nThese were the more important immediate issues of the conflict between\r\nClay's Whigs and Jackson's Democrats, though it must be acknowledged\r\nthat the personalities of the leaders were quite as much an issue as any\r\nof the policies which they espoused. The Whigs, however, proved unequal\r\nto the task of unhorsing their foes; and, with two exceptions,\r\nthe Democrats elected every President from Jackson to Lincoln. The\r\nexceptions were William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, both of whom\r\nwere elected on their war records and both of whom died soon after their\r\ninauguration. Tyler, who as Vice-President succeeded General Harrison,\r\nsoon estranged the Whigs, so that the Democratic triumph was in effect\r\ncontinuous over a period of thirty years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, another issue was shaping the destiny of parties and\r\nof the nation. It was an issue that politicians dodged and candidates\r\nevaded, that all parties avoided, that publicists feared, and that\r\npresidents and congressmen tried to hide under the tenuous fabric of\r\ntheir compromises. But it was an issue that persisted in keeping alive\r\nand that would not down, for it was an issue between right and wrong.\r\nThree times the great Clay maneuvered to outflank his opponents over the\r\nsmoldering fires of the slavery issue, but he died before the repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise gave the death-blow to his loosely gathered\r\ncoalition. Webster, too, and Calhoun, the other members of that\r\nbrilliant trinity which represented the genius of Constitutional\r\nUnionism, of States Rights, and of Conciliation, passed away before the\r\nissue was squarely faced by a new party organized for the purpose of\r\nopposing the further expansion of slavery.\r\n\r\nThis new organization, the Republican party, rapidly assumed form\r\nand solidarity. It was composed of Northern Whigs, of anti-slavery\r\nDemocrats, and of members of several minor groups, such as the\r\nKnow-Nothing or American party, the Liberty party, and included as well\r\nsome of the despised Abolitionists. The vote for Fremont, its first\r\npresidential candidate, in 1856, showed it to be a sectional party,\r\nconfined to the North. But the definite recognition of slavery as an\r\nissue by an opposition party had a profound effect upon the Democrats.\r\nTheir Southern wing now promptly assumed an uncompromising attitude,\r\nwhich, in 1860, split the party into factions. The Southern wing named\r\nBreckinridge; the Northern wing named Stephen A. Douglas; while many\r\nDemocrats as well as Whigs took refuge in a third party, calling itself\r\nthe Constitutional Union, which named John Bell. This division cost the\r\nDemocrats the election, for, under the unique and inspiring leadership\r\nof Abraham Lincoln, the Republicans rallied the anti-slavery forces of\r\nthe North and won.\r\n\r\nSlavery not only racked the parties and caused new alignments; it\r\nracked and split the Union. It is one of the remarkable phenomena of\r\nour political history that the Civil War did not destroy the Democratic\r\nparty, though the Southern chieftains of that party utterly lost their\r\ncause. The reason is that the party never was as purely a Southern\r\nas the Republican was a Northern party. Moreover, the arrogance and\r\nblunders of the Republican leaders during the days of Reconstruction\r\nhelped to keep it alive. A baneful political heritage has been handed\r\ndown to us from the Civil War--the solid South. It overturns the\r\nnational balance of parties, perpetuates a pernicious sectionalism,\r\nand deprives the South of that bipartizan rivalry which keeps open the\r\ncurrents of political life.\r\n\r\nSince the Civil War the struggle between the two dominant parties has\r\nbeen largely a struggle between the Ins and the Outs. The issues that\r\nhave divided them have been more apparent than real. The tariff, the\r\ncivil service, the trusts, and the long list of other \"issues\" do not\r\ndenote fundamental differences, but only variations of degree. Never\r\nin any election during this long interval has there been definitely at\r\nstake a great national principle, save for the currency issue of 1896\r\nand the colonial question following the War with Spain. The revolt of\r\nthe Progressives in 1912 had a character of its own; but neither of the\r\nold parties squarely joined issue with the Progressives in the\r\ncontest which followed. The presidential campaign of 1916 afforded an\r\nopportunity to place on trial before the people a great cause, for there\r\nundoubtedly existed then in the country two great and opposing sides\r\nof public opinion--one for and the other against war with Germany. Here\r\nagain, however, the issue was not joined but was adroitly evaded by both\r\nthe candidates.\r\n\r\nNone the less there has been a difference between the two great parties.\r\nThe Republican party has been avowedly nationalistic, imperialistic, and\r\nin favor of a vigorous constructive foreign policy. The Democratic party\r\nhas generally accepted the lukewarm international policy of Jefferson\r\nand the exaltation of the locality and the plain individual as\r\nchampioned by Jackson. Thus, though in a somewhat intangible and\r\nvariable form, the doctrinal distinctions between Hamilton and Jefferson\r\nhave survived.\r\n\r\nIn the emergence of new issues, new parties are born. But it is one of\r\nthe singular characteristics of the American party system that third\r\nparties are abortive. Their adherents serve mainly as evangelists,\r\ncrying their social and economic gospel in the political wilderness. If\r\nthe issues are vital, they are gradually absorbed by the older parties.\r\n\r\nBefore the Civil War several sporadic parties were formed. The most\r\nunique was the Anti-Masonic party. It flourished on the hysteria caused\r\nby the abduction of William Morgan of Batavia, in western New York, in\r\n1826. Morgan had written a book purporting to lay bare the secrets\r\nof Freemasonry. His mysterious disappearance was laid at the doors of\r\nleading Freemasons; and it was alleged that members of this order placed\r\ntheir secret obligations above their duties as citizens and were hence\r\nunfit for public office. The movement became impressive in Pennsylvania,\r\nVermont, Massachusetts, Ohio, and New York. It served to introduce\r\nSeward and Fillmore into politics. Even a national party was organized,\r\nand William Wirt, of Maryland, a distinguished lawyer, was nominated for\r\nPresident. He received, however, only the electoral votes of Vermont.\r\nThe excitement soon cooled, and the party disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe American or Know-Nothing party had for its slogan \"America for\r\nAmericans,\" and was a considerable factor in certain localities,\r\nespecially in New York and the Middle States, from 1853 to 1856. The\r\nFree Soil party, espousing the cause of slavery restriction, named\r\nMartin Van Buren as its presidential candidate and polled enough votes\r\nin the election of 1848 to defeat Cass, the Democratic candidate. It\r\ndid not survive the election of 1852, but its essential principle was\r\nadopted by the Republican party.\r\n\r\nSince the Civil War, the currency question has twice given life to\r\nthird-party movements. The Greenbacks of 1876-1884 and the Populists\r\nof the 90's were both of the West. Both carried on for a few years a\r\nvigorous crusade, and both were absorbed by the older parties as\r\nthe currency question assumed concrete form and became a commanding\r\npolitical issue. Since 1872, the Prohibitionists have named national\r\ntickets. Their question, which was always dodged by the dominant\r\nparties, is now rapidly nearing a solution.\r\n\r\nThe one apparently unreconcilable element in our political life is the\r\nsocialistic or labor party. Never of great importance in any national\r\nelection, the various labor parties have been of considerable influence\r\nin local politics. Because of its magnitude, the labor vote has always\r\nbeen courted by Democrats and Republicans with equal ardor but with\r\nvarying success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE RISE OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nIdeas or principles alone, however eloquently and insistently\r\nproclaimed, will not make a party. There must be organization. Thus\r\nwe have two distinct practical phases of American party politics: one\r\nregards the party as an agency of the electorate, a necessary organ of\r\ndemocracy; the other, the party as an organization, an army determined\r\nto achieve certain conquests. Every party has, therefore, two aspects,\r\neach attracting a different kind of person: one kind allured by the\r\nprinciples espoused; the other, by the opportunities of place and\r\npersonal gain in the organization. The one kind typifies the body of\r\nvoters; the other the dominant minority of the party.\r\n\r\nWhen one speaks, then, of a party in America, he embraces in that term:\r\nfirst, the tenets or platform for which the party assumes to stand\r\n(i.e., principles that may have been wrought out of experience, may have\r\nbeen created by public opinion, or were perhaps merely made out of hand\r\nby manipulators); secondly, the voters who profess attachment to these\r\nprinciples; and thirdly, the political expert, the politician with his\r\norganization or machine. Between the expert and the great following are\r\nmany gradations of party activity, from the occasional volunteer to the\r\nchieftain who devotes all his time to \"politics.\"\r\n\r\nIt was discovered very early in American experience that without\r\norganization issues would disintegrate and principles remain but\r\nscintillating axioms. Thus necessity enlisted executive talent and\r\nproduced the politician, who, having once achieved an organization,\r\nremained at his post to keep it intact between elections and used it for\r\npurposes not always prompted by the public welfare.\r\n\r\nIn colonial days, when the struggle began between Crown and Colonist,\r\nthe colonial patriots formed clubs to designate their candidates for\r\npublic office. In Massachusetts these clubs were known as \"caucuses,\" a\r\nword whose derivation is unknown, but which has now become fixed in our\r\npolitical vocabulary. These early caucuses in Boston have been described\r\nas follows: \"Mr. Samuel Adams' father and twenty others, one or two from\r\nthe north end of the town, where all the ship business is carried on,\r\nused to meet, make a caucus, and lay their plans for introducing certain\r\npersons into places of trust and power. When they had settled it, they\r\nseparated, and used each their particular influence within his own\r\ncircle. He and his friends would furnish themselves with ballots,\r\nincluding the names of the parties fixed upon, which they distributed\r\non the day of election. By acting in concert together with a careful and\r\nextensive distribution of ballots they generally carried the elections\r\nto their own mind.\"\r\n\r\nAs the revolutionary propaganda increased in momentum, caucuses assumed\r\na more open character. They were a sort of informal town meeting, where\r\nneighbors met and agreed on candidates and the means of electing them.\r\nAfter the adoption of the Constitution, the same methods were continued,\r\nthough modified to suit the needs of the new party alignments. In this\r\ninformal manner, local and even congressional candidates were named.\r\n\r\nWashington was the unanimous choice of the nation. In the third\r\npresidential election, John Adams was the tacitly accepted candidate\r\nof the Federalists and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans, and no\r\nformal nominations seem to have been made. But from 1800 to 1824 the\r\npresidential candidates were designated by members of Congress in\r\ncaucus. It was by this means that the Virginia Dynasty fastened itself\r\nupon the country. The congressional caucus, which was one of the most\r\narrogant and compact political machines that our politics has produced,\r\ndiscredited itself by nominating William H. Crawford (1824), a machine\r\npolitician, whom the public never believed to be of presidential\r\ncaliber. In the bitter fight that placed John Quincy Adams in the White\r\nHouse and made Jackson the eternal enemy of Clay, the congressional\r\ncaucus met its doom. For several years, presidential candidates were\r\nnominated by various informal methods. In 1828 a number of state\r\nlegislatures formally nominated Jackson. In several States the party\r\nmembers of the legislatures in caucus nominated presidential candidates.\r\nDeWitt Clinton was so designated by the New York legislature in 1812\r\nand Henry Clay by the Kentucky legislature in 1822. Great mass meetings,\r\noften garnished with barbecues, were held in many parts of the\r\ncountry in 1824 for indorsing the informal nominations of the various\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nBut none of these methods served the purpose. The President was a\r\nnational officer, backed by a national party, and chosen by a national\r\nelectorate. A national system of nominating the presidential candidates\r\nwas demanded. On September 26, 1831, 113 delegates of the Anti-Masonic\r\nparty, representing thirteen States, met in a national convention in\r\nBaltimore. This was the first national nominating convention held in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1831, the Whig members of the Maryland legislature issued\r\na call for a national Whig convention. This was held in Baltimore the\r\nfollowing December. Eighteen States were represented by delegates, each\r\naccording to the number of presidential electoral votes it cast. Clay\r\nwas named for President. The first national Democratic convention met in\r\nBaltimore on May 21, 1832, and nominated Jackson.\r\n\r\nSince that time, presidential candidates have been named in national\r\nconventions. There have been surprisingly few changes in procedure since\r\nthe first convention. It opened with a temporary organization, examined\r\nthe credentials of delegates, and appointed a committee on permanent\r\norganization, which reported a roster of permanent officers. It\r\nappointed a committee on platform--then called an address to the people;\r\nit listened to eulogistic nominating speeches, balloted for candidates,\r\nand selected a committee to notify the nominees of their designation.\r\nThis is practically the order of procedure today. The national\r\nconvention is at once the supreme court and the supreme legislature of\r\nthe national party. It makes its own rules, designates its committees,\r\nformulates their procedure and defines their power, writes the platform,\r\nand appoints the national executive committee.\r\n\r\nTwo rules that have played a significant part in these conventions\r\ndeserve special mention. The first Democratic convention, in order to\r\ninsure the nomination of Van Buren for Vice-President--the nomination of\r\nJackson for President was uncontested--adopted the rule that \"two-thirds\r\nof the whole number of the votes in the convention shall be necessary\r\nto constitute a choice.\" This \"two-thirds\" rule, so undemocratic in its\r\nnature, remains the practice of the Democratic party today. The\r\nWhigs and Republicans always adhered to the majority rule. The early\r\nDemocratic conventions also adopted the practice of allowing the\r\nmajority of the delegates from any State to cast the vote of the entire\r\ndelegation from that State, a rule which is still adhered to by the\r\nDemocrats. But the Republicans have since 1876 adhered to the policy of\r\nallowing each individual delegate to cast his vote as he chooses.\r\n\r\nThe convention was by no means novel when accepted as a national organ\r\nfor a national party. As early as 1789 an informal convention was held\r\nin the Philadelphia State House for nominating Federalist candidates for\r\nthe legislature. The practice spread to many Pennsylvania counties and\r\nto other States, and soon this informality of self-appointed delegates\r\ngave way to delegates appointed according to accepted rules. When the\r\nlegislative caucus as a means for nominating state officers fell into\r\ndisrepute, state nominating conventions took its place. In 1812 one of\r\nthe earliest movements for a state convention was started by Tammany\r\nHall, because it feared that the legislative caucus would nominate\r\nDeWitt Clinton, its bitterest foe. The caucus, however, did not\r\nname Clinton, and the convention was not assembled. The first state\r\nnominating convention was held in Utica, New York, in 1824 by that\r\nfaction of the Democratic party calling itself the People's party.\r\nThe custom soon spread to every State, so that by 1835 it was firmly\r\nestablished. County and city conventions also took the place of the\r\ncaucus for naming local candidates.\r\n\r\nBut nominations are only the beginning of the contest, and obviously\r\ncaucuses and conventions cannot conduct campaigns. So from the beginning\r\nthese nominating bodies appointed campaign committees. With the increase\r\nin population came the increased complexity of the committee system. By\r\n1830 many of the States had perfected a series of state, district, and\r\ncounty committees.\r\n\r\nThere remained the necessity of knitting these committees into a\r\nnational unity. The national convention which nominated Clay in 1831\r\nappointed a \"Central State Corresponding Committee\" in each State where\r\nnone existed, and it recommended \"to the several States to organize\r\nsubordinate corresponding committees in each county and town.\" This\r\nwas the beginning of what soon was to evolve into a complete national\r\nhierarchy of committees. In 1848 the Democratic convention appointed a\r\npermanent national committee, composed of one member from each State.\r\nThis committee was given the power to call the next national convention,\r\nand from the start became the national executive body of the party.\r\n\r\nIt is a common notion that the politician and his machine are of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. But the American politician arose\r\ncontemporaneously with the party, and with such singular fecundity of\r\nways and means that it is doubtful if his modern successors could teach\r\nhim anything. McMaster declares: \"A very little study of long-forgotten\r\npolitics will suffice to show that in filibustering and gerrymandering,\r\nin stealing governorships and legislatures, in using force at the polls,\r\nin colonizing and in distributing patronage to whom patronage is due, in\r\nall the frauds and tricks that go to make up the worst form of practical\r\npolitics, the men who founded our state and national governments were\r\nalways our equals, and often our masters.\" And this at a time when\r\nonly propertied persons could vote in any of the States and when only\r\nprofessed Christians could either vote or hold office in two of them!\r\n\r\nWhile Washington was President, Tammany Hall, the first municipal\r\nmachine, began its career; and presently George Clinton, Governor of\r\nNew York, and his nephew, DeWitt Clinton, were busy organizing the first\r\nstate machine. The Clintons achieved their purpose through the agency\r\nof a Council of Appointment, prescribed by the first Constitution of\r\nthe State, consisting of the Governor and four senators chosen by the\r\nlegislature. This council had the appointment of nearly all the civil\r\nofficers of the State from Secretary of State to justices of the peace\r\nand auctioneers, making a total of 8287 military and 6663 civil offices.\r\nAs the emoluments of some of these offices were relatively high, the\r\ndisposal of such patronage was a plum-tree for the politician. The\r\nClintons had been Anti-Federalists and had opposed the adoption of the\r\nConstitution. In 1801 DeWitt Clinton became a member of the Council of\r\nAppointment and soon dictated its action. The head of every Federalist\r\noffice-holder fell. Sheriffs, county clerks, surrogates, recorders,\r\njustices by the dozen, auctioneers by the score, were proscribed for the\r\nbenefit of the Clintons. De Witt was sent to the United States Senate in\r\n1802, and at the age of thirty-three he found himself on the highroad\r\nto political eminence. But he resigned almost at once to become Mayor of\r\nNew York City, a position he occupied for about ten years, years filled\r\nwith the most venomous fights between Burrites and Bucktails. Clinton\r\norganized a compact machine in the city. A biased contemporary\r\ndescription of this machine has come down to us. \"You [Clinton] are\r\nencircled by a mercenary band, who, while they offer adulation to your\r\nsystem of error, are ready at the first favorable moment to forsake and\r\ndesert you. A portion of them are needy young men, who without\r\nmaturely investigating the consequence, have sacrificed principle to\r\nself-aggrandizement. Others are mere parasites, that well know the\r\ntenure on which they hold their offices, and will ever pay implicit\r\nobedience to those who administer to their wants. Many of your followers\r\nare among the most profligate of the community. They are the bane of\r\nsocial and domestic happiness, senile and dependent panderers.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1812 Clinton became a candidate for President and polled 89 electoral\r\nvotes against Madison's 128. Subsequently he became Governor of New\r\nYork on the Erie Canal issue; but his political cunning seems to have\r\nforsaken him; and his perennial quarrels with every other faction in his\r\nState made him the object of a constant fire of vituperation. He had,\r\nhowever, taught all his enemies the value of spoils, and he adhered to\r\nthe end to the political action he early advised a friend to adopt:\r\n\"In a political warfare, the defensive side will eventually lose. The\r\nmeekness of Quakerism will do in religion but not in politics. I repeat\r\nit, everything will answer to energy and decision.\"\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren was an early disciple of Clinton. Though he broke with\r\nhis political chief in 1813, he had remained long enough in the Clinton\r\nschool to learn every trick; and he possessed such native talent for\r\nintrigue, so smooth a manner, and such a wonderful memory for names,\r\nthat he soon found himself at the head of a much more perfect and\r\nfar-reaching machine than Clinton had ever dreamed of. The Empire\r\nState has never produced the equal of Van Buren as a manipulator of\r\nlegislatures. No modern politician would wish to face publicity if\r\nhe resorted to the petty tricks that Van Buren used in legislative\r\npolitics. And when, in 1821, he was elected to the Senate of the United\r\nStates, he became one of the organizers of the first national machine.\r\n\r\nThe state machine of Van Buren was long known as the \"Albany Regency.\"\r\nIt included several very able politicians: William L. Marcy, who became\r\nUnited States Senator in 1831; Silas Wright, elected Senator in 1833;\r\nJohn A. Dix, who became Senator in 1845; Benjamin F. Butler, who was\r\nUnited States Attorney-General under President Van Buren, besides a\r\nscore or more of prominent state officials. It had an influential organ\r\nin the Albany Argus, lieutenants in every county, and captains in every\r\ntown. Its confidential agents kept the leaders constantly informed of\r\nthe political situation in every locality; and its discipline made\r\nthe wish of Van Buren and his colleagues a command. Federal and local\r\npatronage and a sagacious distribution of state contracts sustained this\r\ncombination. When the practice of nominating by conventions began, the\r\nRegency at once discerned the strategic value of controlling delegates,\r\nand, until the break in the Democratic party in 1848, it literally\r\nreigned in the State.\r\n\r\nWith the disintegration of the Federalist party came the loss of\r\nconcentrated power by the colonial families of New England and New York.\r\nThe old aristocracy of the South was more fortunate in the maintenance\r\nof its power. Jefferson's party was not only well disciplined; it gave\r\nits confidence to a people still accustomed to class rule and in turn\r\nwas supported by them. In a strict sense the Virginia Dynasty was not\r\na machine like Van Buren's Albany Regency. It was the effect of the\r\nconcentrated influence of men of great ability rather than a definite\r\norganization. The congressional caucus was the instrument through which\r\ntheir influence was made practical. In 1816, however, a considerable\r\nmovement was started to end the Virginia monopoly. It spread to the\r\nJeffersonians of the North. William H. Crawford, of Georgia, and Daniel\r\nTompkins, of New York, came forward as competitors with Monroe for the\r\ncaucus nomination. The knowledge of this intrigue fostered the rising\r\nrevolt against the caucus. Twenty-two Republicans, many of whom were\r\nknown to be opposed to the caucus system, absented themselves. Monroe\r\nwas nominated by the narrow margin of eleven votes over Crawford. By the\r\ntime Monroe had served his second term the discrediting of the caucus\r\nwas made complete by the nomination of Crawford by a thinly attended\r\ngathering of his adherents, who presumed to act for the party. The\r\nVirginia Dynasty had no further favorites to foster, and a new political\r\nforce swept into power behind the dominating personality of Andrew\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nThe new Democracy, however, did not remove the aristocratic power of\r\nthe slaveholder; and from Jackson's day to Buchanan's this became an\r\nincreasing force in the party councils. The slavery question illustrates\r\nhow a compact group of capable and determined men, dominated by an\r\neconomic motive, can exercise for years in the political arena a\r\npreponderating influence, even though they represent an actual minority\r\nof the nation. This untoward condition was made possible by the\r\npolitical sagacity and persistence of the party managers and by the\r\nunwillingness of a large portion of the people to bring the real issue\r\nto a head.\r\n\r\nBefore the Civil War, then, party organization had become a fixed and\r\nnecessary incident in American politics. The war changed the face of our\r\nnational affairs. The changes wrought multiplied the opportunities of\r\nthe professional politician, and in these opportunities, as well as\r\nin the transfused energies and ideals of the people, we must seek the\r\ncauses for those perversions of party and party machinery which have\r\ncharacterized our modern epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE TIDE OF MATERIALISM\r\n\r\nThe Civil War, which shocked the country into a new national\r\nconsciousness and rearranged the elements of its economic life, also\r\nbrought about a new era in political activity and management. The United\r\nStates after Appomattox was a very different country from the United\r\nStates before Sumter was fired upon. The war was a continental upheaval,\r\nlike the Appalachian uplift in our geological history, producing sharp\r\nand profound readjustments.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that in 1864 Lincoln had been elected on a Union ticket\r\nsupported by War Democrats, the Republicans claimed the triumphs of\r\nthe war as their own. They emerged from the struggle with the enormous\r\nprestige of a party triumphant and with \"Saviors of the Union\" inscribed\r\non their banners.\r\n\r\nThe death of their wise and great leader opened the door to a violent\r\npartizan orgy. President Andrew Johnson could not check the fury of the\r\nradical reconstructionists; and a new political era began in a riot of\r\ndogmatic and insolent dictatorship, which was intensified by the mob of\r\ncarpetbaggers, scalawags, and freedmen in the South, and not abated by\r\nthe lawless promptings of the Ku-Klux to regain patrician leadership in\r\nthe home of secession nor by the baneful resentment of the North. The\r\nsoldier was made a political asset. For a generation the \"bloody shirt\"\r\nwas waved before the eyes of the Northern voter; and the evils, both\r\ngrotesque and gruesome, of an unnatural reconstruction are not yet\r\nforgotten in the South.\r\n\r\nA second opportunity of the politician was found in the rapid economic\r\nexpansion that followed the war. The feeling of security in the North\r\ncaused by the success of the Union arms buoyed an unbounded optimism\r\nwhich made it easy to enlist capital in new enterprises, and the\r\nprotective tariff and liberal banking law stimulated industry. Exports\r\nof raw material and food products stimulated mining, grazing, and\r\nfarming. European capital sought investments in American railroads,\r\nmines, and industrial under-takings. In the decade following the war the\r\noutput of pig iron doubled, that of coal multiplied by five, and that\r\nof steel by one hundred. Superior iron and copper, Pennsylvania coal and\r\noil, Nevada and California gold and silver, all yielded their enormous\r\nvalues to this new call of enterprise. Inventions and manufactures of\r\nall kinds flourished. During 1850-60 manufacturing establishments\r\nhad increased by fourteen per cent. During 1860-70 they increased\r\nseventy-nine per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Homestead Act of May 20, 1862, opened vast areas of public lands\r\nto a new immigration. The flow of population was westward, and the West\r\ncalled for communication with the East. The Union Pacific and Central\r\nPacific railways, the pioneer transcontinental lines, fostered on\r\ngenerous grants of land, were the tokens of the new transportation\r\nmovement. Railroads were pushing forward everywhere with unheard-of\r\nrapidity. Short lines were being merged into far-reaching systems.\r\nIn the early seventies the Pennsylvania system was organized and the\r\nVanderbilts acquired control of lines as far west as Chicago. Soon\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio system extended its empire of trade to the\r\nMississippi. Half a dozen ambitious trans-Mississippi systems,\r\nconnecting with four new transcontinental projects, were put into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nProsperity is always the opportunity of the politician. What is of\r\ngreatest significance to the student of politics is that prosperity at\r\nthis time was organized on a new basis. Before the war business had been\r\nconducted largely by individuals or partnerships. The unit was small;\r\nthe amount of capital needed was limited. But now the unit was expanding\r\nso rapidly, the need for capital was so lavish, the empire of trade so\r\nextensive, that a new mechanism of ownership was necessary. This device,\r\nof course, was the corporation. It had, indeed, existed as a trading\r\nunit for many years. But the corporation before 1860 was comparatively\r\nsmall and was generally based upon charters granted by special act of\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\nNo other event has had so practical a bearing on our politics and our\r\neconomic and social life as the advent of the corporate device for\r\nowning and manipulating private business. For it links the omnipotence\r\nof the State to the limitations of private ownership; it thrusts\r\nthe interests of private business into every legislature that grants\r\ncharters or passes regulating acts; it diminishes, on the other hand,\r\nthat stimulus to honesty and correct dealing which a private individual\r\ndiscerns to be his greatest asset in trade, for it replaces individual\r\nresponsibility with group responsibility and scatters ownership among so\r\nlarge a number of persons that sinister manipulation is possible.\r\n\r\nBut if the private corporation, through its interest in broad charter\r\nprivileges and liberal corporation laws and its devotion to the tariff\r\nand to conservative financial policies, found it convenient to do\r\nbusiness with the politician and his organization, the quasi-public\r\ncorporations, especially the steam railroads and street railways, found\r\nit almost essential to their existence. They received not only their\r\nfranchises but frequently large bonuses from the public treasury. The\r\nPacific roads alone were endowed with an empire of 145,000,000 acres of\r\npublic land. States, counties, and cities freely loaned their credit\r\nand gave ample charters to new railway lines which were to stimulate\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nCity councils, legislatures, mayors, governors, Congress, and presidents\r\nwere drawn into the maelstrom of commercialism. It is not surprising\r\nthat side by side with the new business organization there grew up a\r\nnew political organization, and that the new business magnate was\r\naccompanied by a new political magnate. The party machine and the party\r\nboss were the natural product of the time, which was a time of gain and\r\ngreed. It was a sordid reaction, indeed, from the high principles that\r\nsought victory on the field of battle and that found their noblest\r\nembodiment in the character of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe dominant and domineering party chose the leading soldier of the\r\nNorth as its candidate for President. General Grant, elected as a\r\npopular idol because of his military genius, possessed neither the\r\nexperience nor the skill to countermove the machinations of designing\r\npoliticians and their business allies. On the other hand, he soon\r\ndisplayed an admiration for business success that placed him at once in\r\naccord with the spirit of the hour. He exalted men who could make money\r\nrather than men who could command ideas. He chose Alexander T. Stewart,\r\nthe New York merchant prince, one of the three richest men of his day,\r\nfor Secretary of the Treasury. The law, however, forbade the appointment\r\nto this office of any one who should \"directly or indirectly be\r\nconcerned or interested in carrying on the business of trade\r\nor commerce,\" and Stewart was disqualified. Adolph E. Borie of\r\nPhiladelphia, whose qualifications were the possession of great wealth\r\nand the friendship of the President, was named Secretary of the Navy.\r\nAnother personal friend, John A. Rawlins, was named Secretary of War.\r\nA third friend, Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois, was made Secretary\r\nof State. Washburne soon resigned, and Hamilton Fish of New York was\r\nappointed in his place. Fish, together with General Jacob D. Cox\r\nof Ohio, Secretary of the Interior, and Judge E. Rockwood Hoar of\r\nMassachusetts, Attorney-General, formed a strong triumvirate of ability\r\nand character in the Cabinet. But, while Grant displayed pleasure in the\r\ncompanionship of these eminent men, they never possessed his complete\r\nconfidence. When the machinations for place and favor began, Hoar and\r\nCox were in the way. Hoar had offended the Senate in his recommendations\r\nfor federal circuit judges (the circuit court was then newly\r\nestablished), and when the President named him for Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court, Hoar was rejected. Senator Cameron, one of the chief\r\nspoils politicians of the time, told Hoar frankly why: \"What could you\r\nexpect for a man who had snubbed seventy Senators!\" A few months later\r\n(June, 1870), the President bluntly asked for Hoar's resignation, a\r\nsacrifice to the gods of the Senate, to purchase their favor for the\r\nSanto Domingo treaty.\r\n\r\nCox resigned in the autumn. As Secretary of the Interior he had charge\r\nof the Patent Office, Census Bureau, and Indian Service, all of them\r\nrequiring many appointments. He had attempted to introduce a sort of\r\ncivil service examination for applicants and had vehemently protested\r\nagainst political assessments levied on clerks in his department. He\r\nespecially offended Senators Cameron and Chandler, party chieftains who\r\nhad the ear of the President. General Cox stated the matter plainly:\r\n\"My views of the necessity of reform in the civil service had brought\r\nme more or less into collision with the plans of our active political\r\nmanagers and my sense of duty has obliged me to oppose some of their\r\nmethods of action.\" These instances reveal how the party chieftains\r\ninsisted inexorably upon their demands. To them the public service was\r\nprincipally a means to satisfy party ends, and the chief duty of the\r\nPresident and his Cabinet was to satisfy the claims of party necessity.\r\nGeneral Cox said that distributing offices occupied \"the larger part of\r\nthe time of the President and all his Cabinet.\" General Garfield wrote\r\n(1877): \"One-third of the working hours of Senators and Representatives\r\nis hardly sufficient to meet the demands made upon them in reference to\r\nappointments to office.\"\r\n\r\nBy the side of the partizan motives stalked the desire for gain. There\r\nwere those to whom parties meant but the opportunity for sudden wealth.\r\nThe President's admiration for commercial success and his inability to\r\nread the motives of sycophants multiplied their opportunities, and in\r\nthe eight years of his administration there was consummated the baneful\r\nunion of business and politics.\r\n\r\nDuring the second Grant campaign (1872), when Horace Greeley was making\r\nhis astounding run for President, the New York Sun hinted at gross and\r\nwholesale briberies of Congressmen by Oakes Ames and his associates who\r\nhad built the Union Pacific Railroad, an enterprise which the United\r\nStates had generously aided with loans and gifts.\r\n\r\nThree committees of Congress, two in the House and one in the Senate\r\n(the Poland Committee, the Wilson Committee, and the Senate Committee),\r\nsubsequently investigated the charges. Their investigations disclosed\r\nthe fact that Ames, then a member of the House of Representatives,\r\nthe principal stockholder in the Union Pacific, and the soul of the\r\nenterprise, had organized, under an existing Pennsylvania charter,\r\na construction company called the Credit Mobilier, whose shares were\r\nissued to Ames and his associates. To the Credit Mobilier were issued\r\nthe bonds and stock of the Union Pacific, which had been paid for \"at\r\nnot more than thirty cents on the dollar in road-making.\" * As the United\r\nStates, in addition to princely gifts of land, had in effect guaranteed\r\nthe cost of construction by authorizing the issue of Government bonds,\r\ndollar for dollar and side by side with the bonds of the road, the\r\nmotive of the magnificent shuffle, which gave the road into the hands of\r\na construction company, was clear. Now it was alleged that stock of the\r\nCredit Mobilier, paying dividends of three hundred and forty per cent,\r\nhad been distributed by Ames among many of his fellow-Congressmen, in\r\norder to forestall a threatened investigation. It was disclosed that\r\nsome of the members had refused point blank to have anything to do with\r\nthe stock; others had refused after deliberation; others had purchased\r\nsome of it outright; others, alas!, had \"purchased\" it, to be paid for\r\nout of its own dividends.\r\n\r\n     * Testimony before the Wilson Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the members involved in the nasty affair were absolved\r\nby the Poland Committee from \"any corrupt motive or purpose.\" But Oakes\r\nAmes of Massachusetts and James Brooks of New York were recommended for\r\nexpulsion from the House and Patterson of New Hampshire from the Senate.\r\nThe House, however, was content with censuring Ames and Brooks, and the\r\nSenate permitted Patterson's term to expire, since only five days of it\r\nremained. Whatever may have been the opinion of Congress, and whatever a\r\ncareful reading of the testimony discloses to an impartial mind at\r\nthis remote day, upon the voters of that time the revelations came as a\r\nshock. Some of the most trusted Congressmen were drawn into the miasma\r\nof suspicion, among them Garfield; Dawes; Scofield; Wilson, the newly\r\nelected Vice-President; Colfax, the outgoing Vice-President. Colfax had\r\nbeen a popular idol, with the Presidency in his vision; now bowed and\r\ndisgraced, he left the national capital never to return with a public\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 came the disclosures of the Whiskey Ring. They involved United\r\nStates Internal Revenue officers and distillers in the revenue district\r\nof St. Louis and a number of officials at Washington. Benjamin H.\r\nBristow, on becoming Secretary of the Treasury in June of that year,\r\nimmediately scented corruption. He discovered that during 1871-74 only\r\nabout one-third of the whiskey shipped from St. Louis had paid the tax\r\nand that the Government had been defrauded of nearly $3,000,000. \"If a\r\ndistiller was honest,\" says James Ford Rhodes, the eminent historian,\r\n\"he was entrapped into some technical violation of the law by the\r\nofficials, who by virtue of their authority seized his distillery,\r\ngiving him the choice of bankruptcy or a partnership in their\r\noperations; and generally he succumbed.\"\r\n\r\nMcDonald, the supervisor of the St. Louis revenue district, was the\r\nleader of the Whiskey Ring. He lavished gifts upon President Grant, who,\r\nwith an amazing indifference and innocence, accepted such favors from\r\nall kinds of sources. Orville E. Babcock, the President's private\r\nsecretary, who possessed the complete confidence of the guileless\r\ngeneral, was soon enmeshed in the net of investigation. Grant at first\r\ndeclared, \"If Babcock is guilty, there is no man who wants him so much\r\nproven guilty as I do, for it is the greatest piece of traitorism to me\r\nthat a man could possibly practice.\" When Babcock was indicted, however,\r\nfor complicity to defraud the Government, the President did not hesitate\r\nto say on oath that he had never seen anything in Babcock's behavior\r\nwhich indicated that he was in any way interested in the Whiskey Ring\r\nand that he had always had \"great confidence in his integrity and\r\nefficiency.\" In other ways the President displayed his eagerness to\r\ndefend his private secretary. The jury acquitted Babcock, but the\r\npublic did not. He was compelled to resign under pressure of public\r\ncondemnation, and was afterwards indicted for conspiracy to rob a safe\r\nof documents of an incriminating character. But Grant seems never\r\nto have lost faith in him. Three of the men sent to prison for their\r\ncomplicity in the whiskey fraud were pardoned after six months.\r\nMcDonald, the chieftain of the gang, served but one year of his term.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of the Whiskey Ring was followed by an even more startling\r\nhumiliation. The House Committee on Expenditures in the War Department\r\nrecommended that General William W. Belknap, Secretary of War, be\r\nimpeached for \"high crimes and misdemeanors while in office,\" and the\r\nHouse unanimously adopted the recommendation. The evidence upon which\r\nthe committee based its drastic recommendation disclosed the most sordid\r\ndivision of spoils between the Secretary and his wife and two rascals\r\nwho held in succession the valuable post of trader at Fort Sill in the\r\nIndian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe committee's report was read about three o'clock in the afternoon\r\nof March 2, 1876. In the forenoon of the same day Belknap had sent\r\nhis resignation to the President, who had accepted it immediately.\r\nThe President and Belknap were personal friends. But the certainty of\r\nBelknap's perfidy was not removed by the attitude of the President, nor\r\nby the vote of the Senate on the article of impeachment--37 guilty, 25\r\nnot guilty-for the evidence was too convincing. The public knew by this\r\ntime Grant's childlike failing in sticking to his friends; and 93 of the\r\n25 Senators who voted not guilty had publicly declared they did so, not\r\nbecause they believed him innocent, but because they believed they had\r\nno jurisdiction over an official who had resigned.\r\n\r\nThere were many minor indications of the harvest which gross materialism\r\nwas reaping in the political field. State and city governments were\r\nsurrendered to political brigands. In 1871 the Governor of Nebraska was\r\nremoved for embezzlement. Kansas was startled by revelations of brazen\r\nbribery in her senatorial elections (1872-1873). General Schenck,\r\nrepresenting the United States at the Court of St. James, humiliated his\r\ncountry by dabbling in a fraudulent mining scheme.\r\n\r\nIn a speech before the Senate, then trying General Belknap, Senator\r\nGeorge F. Hoar, on May 6, 1876, summed up the greater abominations:\r\n\r\n\"My own public life has been a very brief and insignificant one,\r\nextending little beyond the duration of a single term of senatorial\r\noffice. But in that brief period I have seen five judges of a high court\r\nof the United States driven from office by threats of impeachment for\r\ncorruption or maladministration. I have heard the taunt from friendliest\r\nlips, that when the United States presented herself in the East to take\r\npart with the civilized world in generous competition in the arts of\r\nlife, the only products of her institutions in which she surpassed all\r\nothers beyond question was her corruption. I have seen in the State\r\nin the Union foremost in power and wealth four judges of her courts\r\nimpeached for corruption, and the political administration of her chief\r\ncity become a disgrace and a byword throughout the world. I have seen\r\nthe chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs in the House rise in\r\nhis place and demand the expulsion of four of his associates for making\r\nsale of their official privilege of selecting the youths to be educated\r\nat our great military schools. When the greatest railroad of the world,\r\nbinding together the continent and uniting the two great seas which\r\nwash our shores, was finished, I have seen our national triumph and\r\nexaltation turned to bitterness and shame by the unanimous reports of\r\nthree committees of Congress--two in the House and one here--that every\r\nstep of that mighty enterprise had been taken in fraud. I have heard in\r\nhighest places the shameless doctrine avowed by men grown old in public\r\noffice that the true way by which power should be gained in the Republic\r\nis to bribe the people with the offices created for their service, and\r\nthe true end for which it should be used when gained is the promotion of\r\nselfish ambition and the gratification of personal revenge. I have heard\r\nthat suspicions haunt the footsteps of the trusted companions of the\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\nThese startling facts did not shatter the prestige of the Republicans,\r\nthe \"Saviors of the Union,\" nor humble their leaders. One of them,\r\nSenator Foraker, says: * \"The campaign (1876) on the part of the\r\nDemocrats gave emphasis to the reform idea and exploited Tilden as the\r\ngreat reform governor of New York and the best fitted man in the country\r\nto bring about reforms in the Government of the United States. No\r\nreforms were needed: but a fact like that never interfered with a reform\r\ncampaign.\" The orthodoxy of the politician remained unshaken. Foraker's\r\nreasons were the creed of thousands: \"The Republican party had\r\nprosecuted the war successfully; had reconstructed the States; had\r\nrehabilitated our finances, and brought on specie redemption.\" The\r\nmemoirs of politicians and statesmen of this period, such as Cullom,\r\nForaker, Platt, even Hoar, are imbued with an inflexible faith in the\r\nparty and colored by the conviction that it is a function of Government\r\nto aid business. Platt, for instance, alluding to Blaine's attitude as\r\nSpeaker, in the seventies, said: \"What I liked about him was his frank\r\nand persistent contention that the citizen who best loved his party\r\nand was loyal to it, was loyal to and best loved his country.\" And many\r\nyears afterwards, when a new type of leader appeared representing a\r\nnew era of conviction, Platt was deeply concerned. His famous letter to\r\nRoosevelt, when the Rough Rider was being mentioned for Governor of New\r\nYork (1899), shows the reluctance of the old man to see the signs of the\r\ntimes: \"The thing that really did bother me was this: I had heard from\r\na great many sources that you were a little loose on the relations\r\nof capital and labor, on trusts and combinations, and indeed on the\r\nnumerous questions which have recently arisen in politics affecting the\r\nsecurity of earnings and the right of a man to run his own business in\r\nhis own way, with due respect of course to the Ten Commandments and the\r\nPenal Code.\"\r\n\r\n     * \"Notes from a Busy Life\", vol. I., 98.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaders of both the great parties firmly and honestly believed that\r\nit was the duty of the Government to aid private enterprise, and that\r\nby stimulating business everybody is helped. This article of faith, with\r\nthe doctrine of the sanctity of the party, was a natural product of the\r\nconditions outlined in the beginning of this chapter--the war and the\r\nremarkable economic expansion following the war. It was the cause of the\r\nalliance between business and politics. It made the machine and the boss\r\nthe sinister and ever present shadows of legitimate organization and\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE POLITICIAN AND THE CITY\r\n\r\nThe gigantic national machine that was erected during Grant's\r\nadministration would have been ineffectual without local sources of\r\npower. These sources of power were found in the cities, now thriving on\r\nthe new-born commerce and industry, increasing marvelously in numbers\r\nand in size, and offering to the political manipulator opportunities\r\nthat have rarely been paralleled. *\r\n\r\n     * Between 1860 and 1890 the number of cities of 8000 or more\r\n     inhabitants increased from 141 to 448, standing at 226 in\r\n     1870. In 1865 less than 20% of our people lived in the\r\n     cities; in 1890, over 30%; in 1900, 40%; in 1910, 46.3%. By\r\n     1890 there were six cities with more than half a million\r\n     inhabitants, fifteen with more than 200,000, and twenty-\r\n     eight with more than 100,000. In 1910 there were twenty-\r\n     eight cities with a population over 200,000, fifty cities\r\n     over 100,000, and ninety-eight over 50,000. It was no\r\n     uncommon occurrence for a city to double its population in a\r\n     decade. In ten years Birmingham gained 245%, Los Angeles,\r\n     211%, Seattle, 194%, Spokane, 183%, Dallas, 116%,\r\n     Schenectady, 129%.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governmental framework of the American city is based on the English\r\nsystem as exemplified in the towns of Colonial America. Their charters\r\nwere received from the Crown and their business was conducted by a mayor\r\nand a council composed of aldermen and councilmen. The mayor was usually\r\nappointed; the council elected by a property-holding electorate. In\r\nNew England the glorified town meeting was an important agency of local\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, mayors as well as councilmen were elected, and\r\nthe charters of the towns were granted by the legislature, not by the\r\nexecutive, of the State. In colonial days charters had been granted\r\nby the King. They had fixed for the city certain immunities and\r\nwell-defined spheres of autonomy. But when the legislatures were given\r\nthe power to grant charters, they reduced the charter to the level of\r\na statutory enactment, which could be amended or repealed by any\r\nsuccessive legislature, thereby opening up a convenient field for\r\npolitical maneuvering. The courts have, moreover, construed these\r\ncharters strictly, holding the cities closely bound to those powers\r\nwhich the legislatures conferred upon them.\r\n\r\nThe task of governing the early American town was simple enough. In 1790\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Charleston were the only\r\ntowns in the United States of over 8000 inhabitants; all together they\r\nnumbered scarcely 130,000. Their populations were homogeneous; their\r\nwants were few; and they were still in that happy childhood when\r\nevery voter knew nearly every other voter and when everybody knew his\r\nneighbor's business as well as his own, and perhaps better.\r\n\r\nGradually the towns awoke to their newer needs and demanded public\r\nservice--lighting, street cleaning, fire protection, public education.\r\nAll these matters, however, could be easily looked after by the mayor\r\nand the council committees. But when these towns began to spread rapidly\r\ninto cities, they quickly outgrew their colonial garments. Yet the\r\nlegislatures were loath to cast the old garments aside. One may say that\r\nfrom 1840 to 1901, when the Galveston plan of commission government was\r\ninaugurated, American municipal government was nothing but a series\r\nof contests between a small body of alert citizens attempting to\r\nfix responsibility on public officers and a few adroit politicians\r\nattempting to elude responsibility; both sides appealing to an\r\nelectorate which was habitually somnolent but subject to intermittent\r\nawakenings through spasms of righteousness.\r\n\r\nDuring this epoch no important city remained immune from ruthless\r\nlegislative interference. Year after year the legislature shifted\r\nofficers and responsibilities at the behest of the boss. \"Ripper bills\"\r\nwere passed, tearing up the entire administrative systems of important\r\nmunicipalities. The city was made the plaything of the boss and the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThroughout the constant shifts that our city governments have undergone\r\none may, however, discern three general plans of government.\r\n\r\nThe first was the centering of power in the city council, whether\r\ncomposed of two chambers--a board of aldermen and a common council--as\r\nin New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, or of one council, as in many\r\nlesser cities. It soon became apparent that a large body, whose chief\r\nfunction is legislation, is utterly unfit to look after administrative\r\ndetails. Such a body, in order to do business, must act through\r\ncommittees. Responsibility is scattered. Favoritism is possible in\r\nletting contracts, in making appointments, in depositing city funds, in\r\nmaking public improvements, in purchasing supplies and real estate,\r\nand in a thousand other ways. So, by controlling the appointment\r\nof committees, a shrewd manipulator could virtually control all the\r\nmunicipal activities and make himself overlord of the city.\r\n\r\nThe second plan of government attempted to make the mayor the\r\ncontrolling force. It reduced the council to a legislative body and\r\nexalted the mayor into a real executive with power to appoint and to\r\nremove heads of departments, thereby making him responsible for the city\r\nadministration. Brooklyn under Mayor Seth Low was an encouraging example\r\nof this type of government. But the type was rarely found in a pure\r\nform. The politician succeeded either in electing a subservient mayor or\r\nin curtailing the mayor's authority by having the heads of departments\r\nelected or appointed by the council or made subject to the approval of\r\nthe council. If the council held the key to the city treasury, the boss\r\nreigned, for councilmen from properly gerrymandered wards could usually\r\nbe trusted to execute his will.\r\n\r\nThe third form of government was government by boards. Here it was\r\nattempted to place the administration of various municipal activities in\r\nthe hands of independent boards. Thus a board had charge of the police,\r\nanother of the fire department, another of public works, and so on.\r\nOften there were a dozen of these boards and not infrequently over\r\nthirty in a single city, as in Philadelphia. Sometimes these boards were\r\nelected by the people; sometimes they were appointed by the council;\r\nsometimes they were appointed by the mayor; in one or two instances\r\nthey were appointed by the Governor. Often their powers were shared with\r\ncommittees of the council; a committee on police, for instance, shared\r\nwith the Board of Police Commissioners the direction of police affairs.\r\nUsually these boards were responsible to no one but the electorate\r\n(and that remotely) and were entirely without coordination, a mere\r\nagglomeration of independent creations generally with ill-defined\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nSometimes the laws provided that not all the members of the appointive\r\nboards should \"belong to the same political party\" or \"be of the same\r\npolitical opinion in state and national issues.\" It was clearly the\r\nintention to wipe out the partizan complexion of such boards. But\r\nthis device was no stumbling-block to the boss. Whatever might be the\r\n\"opinions\" on national matters of the men appointed, they usually had\r\na perfect understanding with the appointing authorities as to local\r\nmatters. As late as 1898, a Democratic mayor of New York (Van Wyck)\r\nsummarily removed the two Republican members of the Board of Police\r\nCommissioners and replaced them by Republicans after his own heart. In\r\ntruth, the bipartizan board fitted snugly into the dual party regime\r\nthat existed in many cities, whereby the county offices were apportioned\r\nto one party, the city offices to the other, and the spoils to both. It\r\nis doubtful if any device was ever more deceiving and less satisfactory\r\nthan the bipartizan board.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not be led to think that any one of these plans of\r\nmunicipal government prevailed at any one time. They all still exist,\r\ncontemporaneously with the newer commission plan and the city manager\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with these experiments in governmental mechanisms for the\r\ngrowing cities went a rapidly increasing expenditure of public funds.\r\nStreets had to be laid out, paved, and lighted; sewers extended;\r\nfirefighting facilities increased; schools built; parks, boulevards,\r\nand playgrounds acquired, and scores of new activities undertaken by the\r\nmunicipality. All these brought grist to the politician's mill. So did\r\nhis control of the police force and the police courts. And finally, with\r\nthe city reaching its eager streets far out into the country, came the\r\nnecessity for rapid transportation, which opened up for the municipal\r\npolitician a new El Dorado.\r\n\r\nUnder our laws the right of a public service corporation to occupy the\r\npublic streets is based upon a franchise from the city. Before the days\r\nof the referendum the franchise was granted by the city council, usually\r\nas a monopoly, sometimes in perpetuity; and, until comparatively recent\r\nyears, the corporation paid nothing to the city for the rights it\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that within a few decades of the discovery of\r\nelectric power, every city, large and small, had its street-car and\r\nelectric-light service, and that most of these cities, through their\r\ncouncils, gave away these monopoly rights for long periods of time, we\r\ncan imagine the princely aggregate of the gifts which public service\r\ncorporations have received at the hands of our municipal governments,\r\nand the nature of the temptations these corporations were able to spread\r\nbefore the greedy gaze of those whose gesture would seal the grant.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only at the granting of the franchise that the boss\r\nand his machine sought for spoils. A public service corporation,\r\nbeing constantly asked for favors, is a continuing opportunity for the\r\npolitical manipulator. Public service corporations could share their\r\npatronage with the politician in exchange for favors. Through their\r\ncontrol of many jobs, and through their influence with banks, they could\r\nshow a wide assortment of favors to the politician in return for\r\nhis influence; for instance, in the matter of traffic regulations,\r\npermission to tear up the streets, inspection laws, rate schedules, tax\r\nassessments, coroners' reports, or juries.\r\n\r\nWhen the politician went to the voters, he adroitly concealed his\r\ndesigns under the name of one of the national parties. Voters were asked\r\nto vote for a Republican or a Democrat, not for a policy of municipal\r\nadministration or other local policies. The system of committees,\r\ncaucuses, conventions, built up in every city, was linked to the\r\nnational organization. A citizen of New York, for instance, was not\r\nasked to vote for the Broadway Franchise, which raised such a scandal\r\nin the eighties, but to vote for aldermen running on a national tariff\r\nticket!\r\n\r\nThe electorate was somnolent and permitted the politician to have his\r\nway. The multitudes of the city came principally from two sources, from\r\nEurope and from the rural districts of our own country. Those who came\r\nto the city from the country were prompted by industrial motives; they\r\nsought wider opportunities; they soon became immersed in their tasks and\r\npaid little attention to public questions. The foreign immigrants who\r\ncongested our cities were alien to American institutions. They formed\r\na heterogeneous population to whom a common ideal of government was\r\nunknown and democracy a word without meaning. These foreigners were\r\neasily influenced and easily led. Under the old naturalization laws,\r\nthey were herded into the courts just before election and admitted to\r\ncitizenship. In New York they were naturalized under the guidance of\r\nwardheelers, not infrequently at the rate of one a minute! And, before\r\nthe days of registration laws, ballots were distributed to them and they\r\nwere led to the polls, as charity children are given excursion tickets\r\nand are led to their annual summer's day picnic.\r\n\r\nThe slipshod methods of naturalization have been revealed since the new\r\nlaw (1906) has been in force. Tens of thousands of voters who thought\r\nthey were citizens found that their papers were only declarations of\r\nintentions, or \"first papers.\" Other tens of thousands had lost even\r\nthese papers and could not designate the courts that had issued them;\r\nand other thousands found that the courts that had naturalized them were\r\nwithout jurisdiction in the matter.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely among these newcomers that the boss found his\r\nopportunities for carrying elections. The dense city blocks were\r\nconvenient lodging places for \"floaters.\" Just before elections,\r\nthe population of the downtown wards in the larger cities increased\r\nsurprisingly. The boss fully availed himself of the psychological and\r\nsocial reactions of the city upon the individual, knowing instinctively\r\nhow much more easily men are corrupted when they are merged in the crowd\r\nand have lost their sense of personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt was in the city, then, that industrial politics found their natural\r\nhabitat. We shall now scrutinize more closely some of the developments\r\nwhich arose out of such an environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. TAMMANY HALL\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolutionary War numerous societies were organized to aid\r\nthe cause of Independence. These were sometimes called \"Sons of Liberty\"\r\nand not infrequently \"Sons of St. Tammany,\" after an Indian brave whom\r\ntradition had shrouded in virtue. The name was probably adopted to\r\nburlesque the royalist societies named after St. George, St. David, or\r\nSt. Andrew. After the war these societies vanished. But, in New York\r\nCity, William Mooney, an upholsterer, reorganized the local society\r\nas \"Tammany Society or Columbian Order,\" devoted ostensibly to\r\ngoodfellowship and charity. Its officers bore Indian titles and its\r\nceremonies were more or less borrowed from the red man, not merely\r\nbecause of their unique and picturesque character, but to emphasize the\r\ntruly American and anti-British convictions of its members. The society\r\nattracted that element of the town's population which delighted in the\r\ncrude ceremonials and the stimulating potions that always accompanied\r\nthem, mostly small shopkeepers and mechanics. It was among this class\r\nthat the spirit of discontent against the power of Federalism was\r\nstrongest--a spirit that has often become decisive in our political\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nThis was still the day of the \"gentleman,\" of small clothes, silver\r\nshoe-buckles, powdered wigs, and lace ruffles. Only taxpayers and\r\npropertied persons could vote, and public office was still invested with\r\ncertain prerogatives and privileges. Democracy was little more than\r\na name. There was, however, a distinct division of sentiment, and the\r\ndrift towards democracy was accelerated by immigration. The newcomers\r\nwere largely of the humble classes, among whom the doctrines of\r\ndemocratic discontent were welcome.\r\n\r\nTammany soon became partizan. The Federalist members withdrew, probably\r\ninfluenced by Washington's warning against secret political societies.\r\nBy 1798 it was a Republican club meeting in various taverns, finally\r\nselecting Martling's \"Long Room\" for its nightly carousals. Soon after\r\nthis a new constitution was adopted which adroitly transformed the\r\nsociety into a compact political machine, every member subscribing to\r\nthe oath that he would resist the encroachments of centralized power\r\nover the State.\r\n\r\nTradition has it that the transformer of Tammany into the first compact\r\nand effective political machine was Aaron Burr. There is no direct\r\nevidence that he wrote the new constitution. But there is collateral\r\nevidence. Indeed, it would not have been Burrian had he left any written\r\nevidence of his connection with the organization. For Burr was one of\r\nthose intriguers who revel in mystery, who always hide their designs,\r\nand never bind themselves in writing without leaving a dozen loopholes\r\nfor escape. He was by this time a prominent figure in American\r\npolitics. His skill had been displayed in Albany, both in the passing of\r\nlegislation and in out-maneuvering Hamilton and having himself\r\nelected United States Senator against the powerful combination of the\r\nLivingstons and the Schuylers. He was plotting for the Presidency as the\r\ncampaign of 1800 approached, and Tammany was to be the fulcrum to lift\r\nhim to this conspicuous place.\r\n\r\nUnder the ostensible leadership of Matthew L. Davis, Burr's chief\r\nlieutenant, every ward of the city was carefully organized, a polling\r\nlist was made, scores of new members were pledged to Tammany, and during\r\nthe three days of voting (in New York State until 1840 elections\r\nlasted three days), while Hamilton was making eloquent speeches for the\r\nFederalists, Burr was secretly manipulating the wires of his machine.\r\nBurr and Tammany won in New York City, though Burr failed to win the\r\nPresidency. The political career of this remarkable organization, which\r\nhas survived over one hundred and twenty years of stormy history, was\r\nnow well launched.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present the history of Tammany Hall is a tale\r\nof victories, followed by occasional disclosures of corruption and\r\nfavoritism; of quarrels with governors and presidents; of party fights\r\nbetween \"up-state\" and \"city\"; of skulking when its sachems were\r\nunwelcome in the White House; of periodical displays of patriotism for\r\ncloaking its grosser crimes; of perennial charities for fastening itself\r\nmore firmly on the poorer populace which has always been the source of\r\nits power; of colossal municipal enterprise for profit-sharing; and of\r\na continuous political efficiency due to sagacious leadership, a\r\nremarkable adaptability to the necessities of the hour, and a patience\r\nthat outlasts every \"reform.\"\r\n\r\nIt early displayed all the traits that have made it successful. In 1801,\r\nfor the purpose of carrying city elections, it provided thirty-nine men\r\nwith money to purchase houses and lots in one ward, and seventy men\r\nwith money for the same purpose in another ward, thus manufacturing\r\nfreeholders for polling purposes. In 1806 Benjamin Romaine, a grand\r\nsachem, was removed from the office of city controller by his own party\r\nfor acquiring land from the city without paying for it. In 1807 several\r\nsuperintendents of city institutions were dismissed for frauds. The\r\ninspector of bread, a sachem, resigned because his threat to extort\r\none-third of the fees from his subordinates had become public. Several\r\nassessment collectors, all prominent in Tammany, were compelled to\r\nreimburse the city for deficits in their accounts. One of the leading\r\naldermen used his influence to induce the city to sell land to his\r\nbrother-in-law at a low price, and then bade the city buy it back\r\nfor many times its value. Mooney, the founder of the society, now\r\nsuperintendent of the almshouse, was caught in a characteristic fraud.\r\nHis salary was $1000 a year, with $500 for family expenses. But it was\r\ndiscovered that his \"expenses\" amounted to $4000 a year, and that he had\r\ncredited to himself on the books $1000 worth of supplies and numerous\r\nsums for \"trifles for Mrs. Mooney.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1826, the Grand Jury entered an indictment against Matthew\r\nL. Davis and a number of other Tammany men for defrauding several banks\r\nand insurance companies of over $2,000,000. This created a tremendous\r\nsensation. Political influence was at once set in motion, and only the\r\nminor defendants were sent to the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Samuel Swartwout, one of the Tammany leaders, was appointed\r\nCollector of the Port of New York. His downfall came in 1838, and he\r\nfled to Europe. His defalcations in the Custom House were found to be\r\nover $1,222,700; and \"to Swartwout\" became a useful phrase until Tweed's\r\nday. He was succeeded by Jesse Hoyt, another sachem and notorious\r\npolitician, against whom several judgments for default were recorded\r\nin the Superior Court, which were satisfied very soon after his\r\nappointment. At this time another Tammany chieftain, W. M. Price, United\r\nStates District Attorney for Southern New York, defaulted for $75,000.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1851 that the council commonly known as \"The Forty Thieves\"\r\nwas elected. In it William M. Tweed served his apprenticeship. Some of\r\nthe maneuvers of this council and of other officials were divulged by\r\na Grand Jury in its presentment of February 23, 1853. The presentment\r\nstates: \"It was clearly shown that enormous sums of money were spent\r\nfor the procurement of railroad grants in the city, and that towards the\r\ndecision and procurement of the Eighth Avenue railway grant, a sum\r\nso large that would startle the most credulous was expended; but in\r\nconsequence of the voluntary absence of important witnesses, the Grand\r\nJury was left without direct testimony of the particular recipients of\r\nthe different amounts.\"\r\n\r\nThese and other exposures brought on a number of amendments to the city\r\ncharter, surrounding with greater safeguards the sale or lease of city\r\nproperty and the letting of contracts; and a reform council was elected.\r\nImmediately upon the heels of this reform movement followed the shameful\r\nregime of Fernando Wood, an able, crafty, unscrupulous politician, who\r\nbegan by announcing himself a reformer, but who soon became a boss in\r\nthe most offensive sense of that term--not, however, in Tammany Hall,\r\nfor he was ousted from that organization after his reelection as mayor\r\nin 1856. He immediately organized a machine of his own, Mozart Hall. The\r\nintense struggle between the two machines cost the city a great sum, for\r\nthe taxpayers were mulcted to pay the bills.\r\n\r\nThrough the anxious days of the Civil War, when the minds of thoughtful\r\ncitizens were occupied with national issues, the tide of reform ebbed\r\nand flowed. A reform candidate was elected mayor in 1863, but Tammany\r\nreturned to power two years later by securing the election and then the\r\nreelection of John T. Hoffman. Hoffman possessed considerable ability\r\nand an attractive personality. His zeal for high office, however, made\r\nhim easily amenable to the manipulators. Tammany made him Governor and\r\nplanned to name him for President. Behind his popularity, which was\r\nconsiderable, and screened by the greater excitements of the war,\r\nreconstruction, and the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, lurked the Ring,\r\nwhose exposures and confessions were soon to amaze everyone.\r\n\r\nThe chief ringster was William M. Tweed, and his name will always\r\nbe associated in the public mind with political bossdom. This is his\r\nimmortality. He was a chairmaker by trade, a vulgar good fellow by\r\nnature, a politician by circumstances, a boss by evolution, and a\r\ngrafter by choice. He became grand sachem of Tammany and chairman of the\r\ngeneral committee. This committee he ruled with blunt directness. When\r\nhe wanted a question carried, he failed to ask for the negative votes;\r\nand soon he was called \"the Boss,\" a title he never resented, and which\r\nusage has since fixed in our politics. So he ruled Tammany with a high\r\nhand; made nominations arbitrarily; bullied, bought, and traded; became\r\nPresident of the Board of Supervisors, thus holding the key to the\r\ncity's financial policies; and was elected State Senator, thereby\r\ndirecting the granting of legislative favors to his city and to his\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Tammany carried Hoffman into the Governor's chair, and in the\r\nfollowing year the Democrats carried the State legislature. Tweed now\r\nhad a new charter passed which virtually put New York City into his\r\npocket by placing the finances of the metropolis entirely in the hands\r\nof a Board of Apportionment which he dominated. Of this Board, the\r\nmayor of the city was the chairman, with the power to appoint the other\r\nmembers. He promptly named Tweed, Connolly, and P. B. Sweeny. This was\r\nthe famous Ring. The mayor was A. Oakey Hall, dubbed \"Elegant Oakey\" by\r\nhis pals because of his fondness for clubs, society, puns, and poems;\r\nbut Nast called him \"O. K. Haul.\" Sweeny, commonly known as \"Pete,\" was\r\na lawyer of ability, and was generally believed to be the plotter of the\r\nquartet. Nast transformed his middle initial B. into \"Brains.\" Connolly\r\nwas just a coarse gangster.\r\n\r\nThere was some reason for the Ring's faith in its invulnerability. It\r\ncontrolled Governor and legislature, was formidable in the national\r\ncouncils of the Democratic party, and its Governor was widely mentioned\r\nfor the presidential nomination. It possessed complete power over the\r\ncity council, the mayor, and many of the judges. It was in partnership\r\nwith Gould and Fiske of the Erie, then reaping great harvests in Wall\r\nStreet, and with street railway and other public service corporations.\r\nThrough untold largess it silenced rivalry from within and criticism\r\nfrom without. And, when suspicion first raised its voice, it adroitly\r\ninvited a committee of prominent and wealthy citizens, headed by John\r\nJacob Astor, to examine the controller's accounts. After six hours\r\nspent in the City Hall these respectable gentlemen signed an acquitment,\r\nsaying that \"the affairs of the city under the charge of the controller\r\nare administered in a correct and faithful manner.\"\r\n\r\nThus intrenched, the Ring levied tribute on every municipal activity.\r\nEveryone who had a charge against the city, either for work done or\r\nmaterials furnished, was told to add to the amount of his bill, at first\r\n10%, later 66%, and finally 85%. One man testified that he was told\r\nto raise to $55,000 his claim of $5000. He got his $5000; the Ring got\r\n$50,000. The building of the Court House, still known as \"Tweed's Court\r\nHouse,\" was estimated to cost $3,000,000, but it cost many times that\r\nsum. The item \"repairing fixtures\" amounted to $1,149,874.50, before the\r\nbuilding was completed. Forty chairs and three tables cost $179,729.60;\r\nthermometers cost $7500. G. S. Miller, a carpenter, received\r\n$360,747.61, and a plasterer named Gray, $2,870,464.06 for nine months'\r\n\"work.\" The Times dubbed him the \"Prince of Plasterers.\" \"A plasterer\r\nwho can earn $138,187 in two days [December 20 and 21] and that in the\r\ndepths of winter, need not be poor.\" Carpets cost $350,000, most of the\r\nBrussels and Axminster going to the New Metropolitan Hotel just opened\r\nby Tweed's son.\r\n\r\nThe Ring's hold upon the legislature was through bribery, not through\r\npartizan adhesion. Tweed himself confessed that he gave one man in\r\nAlbany $600,000 for buying votes to pass his charter; and Samuel J.\r\nTilden estimated the total cost for this purpose at over one million\r\ndollars. Tweed said he bought five Republican senators for $40,000\r\napiece. The vote on the charter was 30 to 2 in the Senate, 116 to 5 in\r\nthe Assembly. Similar sums were spent in Albany in securing corporate\r\nfavors. The Viaduct Railway Bill is an example. This bill empowered a\r\ncompany, practically owned by the Ring, to build a railway on or above\r\nany street in the city. It provided that the city should subscribe for\r\n$5,000,000 of the stock; and it exempted the company from taxation.\r\nCollateral bills were introduced enabling the company to widen and grade\r\nany streets, the favorite \"job\" of a Tammany grafter. Fortunately for\r\nthe city, exposure came before this monstrous scheme could be put in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nNewspapers in the city were heavily subsidized. Newspapers in Albany\r\nwere paid munificently for printing. One of the Albany papers received\r\n$207,900 for one year's work which was worth less than $10,000. Half a\r\ndozen reporters of the leading dailies were put on the city payroll at\r\nfrom $2000 to $2500 a year for \"services.\"\r\n\r\nThe Himalayan size of these swindles and their monumental effrontery led\r\nthe New York Sun humorously to suggest the erection of a statue to\r\nthe principal Robber Baron, \"in commemoration of his services to the\r\ncommonwealth.\" A letter was sent out asking for funds. There were a\r\ngreat many men in New York, the Sun thought, who would not be unwilling\r\nto refuse a contribution. But Tweed declined the honor. In its issue of\r\nMarch 14, 1871, the Sun has this headline:\r\n\r\n\"A GREAT MAN'S MODESTY\"\r\n\r\n\"THE HON. WILLIAM M. TWEED DECLINES THE SUN'S STATUE. CHARACTERISTIC\r\nLETTER FROM THE GREAT NEW YORK PHILANTHROPIST. HE THINKS THAT VIRTUE\r\nSHOULD BE ITS OWN REWARD. THE MOST REMARKABLE LETTER EVER WRITTEN BY THE\r\nNOBLE BENEFACTOR OF THE PEOPLE.\"\r\n\r\nAnother kind of memorial to his genius for absorbing the people's money\r\nwas awaiting this philanthropic buccaneer. Vulgar ostentation was the\r\noutward badge of these civic burglaries. Tweed moved into a Fifth Avenue\r\nmansion and gave his daughter a wedding at which she received $100,000\r\nworth of gifts; her wedding dress was a $5000 creation. At Greenwich he\r\nbuilt a country estate where the stables were framed of choice mahogany.\r\nSweeny hobnobbed with Jim Fiske of the Erie, the Tweed of Wall Street,\r\nwho went about town dressed in loud checks and lived with his harem in\r\nhis Opera House on Eighth Avenue.\r\n\r\nThoughtful citizens saw these things going on and believed the city\r\nwas being robbed, but they could not prove it. There were two attacking\r\nparties, however, who did not wait for proofs--Thomas Nast, the\r\nbrilliant cartoonist of Harper's Weekly, and the New York Times. The\r\nincisive cartoons of Nast appealed to the imaginations of all classes;\r\neven Tweed complained that his illiterate following could \"look at the\r\ndamn pictures.\" The trenchant editorials of Louis L. Jennings in\r\nthe Times reached a thoughtful circle of readers. In one of these\r\neditorials, February 24, 1871, before the exposure, he said: \"There is\r\nabsolutely nothing--nothing in the city--which is beyond the reach of\r\nthe insatiable gang who have obtained possession of it. They can get a\r\ngrand jury dismissed at any time, and, as we have seen, the legislature\r\nis completely at their disposal.\"\r\n\r\nFinally proof did come and, as is usual in such cases, it came from\r\nthe inside. James O'Brien, an ex-sheriff and the leader in a Democratic\r\n\"reform movement\" calling itself \"Young Democracy,\" secured the\r\nappointment of one of his friends as clerk in the controller's office.\r\nTranscripts of the accounts were made, and these O'Brien brought to\r\nthe Times, which began their publication, July 8, 1871. The Ring was\r\nin consternation. It offered George Jones, the proprietor of the Times,\r\n$5,000,000 for his silence and sent a well-known banker to Nast with an\r\ninvitation to go to Europe \"to study art,\" with $100,000 for \"expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I could get $200,000?\" innocently asked Nast.\r\n\r\n\"I believe from what I have heard in the bank that you might get it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some reflection, the cartoonist asked: \"Don't you think I could\r\nget $500,000 to make that trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can; you can get $500,000 in gold to drop this Ring business and\r\nget out of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't think I'll do it,\" laughed the artist. \"I made up my\r\nmind not long ago to put some of those fellows behind the bars, and I am\r\ngoing to put them there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only be careful, Mr. Nast, that you do not first put yourself in a\r\ncoffin,\" said the banker as he left.\r\n\r\nA public meeting in Cooper Institute, April 6, 1871, was addressed by\r\nWilliam E. Dodge, Henry Ward Beecher, William M. Evarts, and William F.\r\nHavemeyer. They vehemently denounced Tweed and his gang. Tweed smiled\r\nand asked, \"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" On the 4th of\r\nSeptember, the same year, a second mass meeting held in the same place\r\nanswered the question by appointing a committee of seventy. Tweed,\r\nSweeny, and Hall, now alarmed by the disclosures in the Times, decided\r\nto make Connolly the scapegoat, and asked the aldermen and supervisors\r\nto appoint a committee to examine his accounts. By the time the\r\ncommittee appeared for the examination--its purpose had been well\r\nannounced--the vouchers for 1869 and 1870 had disappeared. Mayor Hall\r\nthen asked for Connolly's resignation. But instead, Connolly consulted\r\nSamuel J. Tilden, who advised him to appoint Andrew H. Green, a\r\nwell-known and respected citizen, as his deputy. This turned the tables\r\non the three other members of the Ring, whose efforts to oust both\r\nConnolly and Green were unavailing. In this manner the citizens\r\ngot control of the treasury books, and the Grand Jury began its\r\ninquisitions. Sweeny and Connolly soon fled to Europe. Sweeny afterwards\r\nsettled for $400,000 and returned. Hall's case was presented to a grand\r\njury which proved to be packed. A new panel was ordered but failed to\r\nreturn an indictment because of lack of evidence. Hall was subsequently\r\nindicted, but his trial resulted in a disagreement.\r\n\r\nTweed was indicted for felony. He remained at large on bail and was\r\ntwice tried in 1873. The first trial resulted in a disagreement, the\r\nsecond in a conviction. His sentence was a fine of $12,000 and twelve\r\nyears' imprisonment. When he arrived at the penitentiary, he answered\r\nthe customary questions. \"What occupation?\" \"Statesman.\" \"What\r\nreligion?\" \"None.\" He served one year and was then released on a flimsy\r\ntechnicality by the Court of Appeals. Civil suits were now brought, and,\r\nunable to obtain the $3,000,000 bail demanded, the fallen boss was sent\r\nto jail. He escaped to Cuba, and finally to Spain, but he was again\r\narrested, returned to New York on a man-of-war, and put into Ludlow\r\nStreet jail, where he died April 12, 1878, apparently without money or\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe exact amount of the plunder was never ascertained. An expert\r\naccountant employed by the housecleaners estimated that for three years,\r\n1868-71, the frauds totaled between $45,000,000 and $50,000,000. The\r\nestimate of the aldermen's committee was $60,000,000. Tweed never gave\r\nany figures; he probably had never counted his gains, but merely spent\r\nthem as they came. O'Rourke, one of the gang, estimated that the Ring\r\nstole about $75,000,000 during 1865-71, and that, \"counting vast issues\r\nof fraudulent bonds,\" the looting \"probably amounted to $200,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of these disclosures circled the earth and still affects the\r\npopular judgment of the American metropolis. It seemed as though Tammany\r\nwere forever discredited. But, to the despair of reformers, in 1874\r\nTammany returned to power, electing its candidate for mayor by over 9000\r\nmajority. The new boss who maneuvered this rapid resurrection was John\r\nKelly, a stone-mason, known among his Irish followers as \"Honest John.\"\r\nBesides the political probity which the occasion demanded, he possessed\r\na capacity for knowing men and sensing public opinion. This enabled him\r\nto lift the prostrate organization. He persuaded such men as Samuel J.\r\nTilden, the distinguished lawyer, August Belmont, a leading financier,\r\nHoratio Seymour, who had been governor, and Charles O'Conor, the famous\r\nadvocate, to become sachems under him. This was evidence of reform\r\nfrom within. Cooperation with the Bar Association, the Taxpayers'\r\nAssociation, and other similar organizations evidenced a desire of\r\nreform from without. Kelly \"bossed\" the Hall until his death, June 1,\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Richard Croker, a machinist, prizefighter, and\r\ngang-leader. Croker began his official career as a court attendant under\r\nthe notorious Judge Barnard and later was an engineer in the service of\r\nthe city. These places he held by Tammany favor, and he was so useful\r\nthat in 1868 he was made alderman. A quarrel with Tweed lost him the\r\nplace, but a reconciliation soon landed him in the lucrative office of\r\nSuperintendent of Market Fees and Rents, under Connolly. In 1873 he was\r\nelected coroner and ten years later was appointed fire commissioner. His\r\ncareer as boss was marked by much political cleverness and caution and\r\nby an equal degree of moral obtuseness.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Tammany in 1892 was followed by such ill-disguised\r\ncorruption that the citizens of New York were again roused from their\r\napathy. The investigations of the Fassett Committee of the State Senate\r\ntwo years previously had shown how deep the tentacles of Tammany were\r\nthrust into the administrative departments of the city. The Senate now\r\nappointed another investigating committee, of which Clarence Lexow was\r\nthe chairman and John W. Goff the counsel. The Police Department came\r\nunder its special scrutiny. The disclosures revealed the connivance of\r\nthe police in stupendous election frauds. The President of the Police\r\nBoard himself had distributed at the polls the policemen who committed\r\nthese frauds. It was further revealed that vice and crime under police\r\nprotection had been capitalized on a great scale. It was worth money to\r\nbe a policeman. One police captain testified he had paid $15,000 for\r\nhis promotions; another paid $12,000. It cost $300 to be appointed\r\npatrolman. Over six hundred policy-shops were open, each paying $1500 a\r\nmonth for protection; pool rooms paid $300 a month; bawdy-houses, from\r\n$25 to $50 per month per inmate. And their patrons paid whatever they\r\ncould be blackmailed out of; streetwalkers, whatever they could be\r\nwheedled out of; saloons, $20 per month; pawnbrokers, thieves, and thugs\r\nshared with the police their profits, as did corporations and others\r\nseeking not only favors but their rights. The committee in its statement\r\nto the Grand Jury (March, 1892) estimated that the annual plunder from\r\nthese sources was over $7,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the committee's sessions Croker was in Europe on important\r\nbusiness. But he found time to order the closing of disreputable\r\nresorts, and, though he was only a private citizen and three thousand\r\nmiles away, his orders were promptly obeyed.\r\n\r\nAroused by these disclosures and stimulated by the lashing sermons\r\nof the Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst, the citizens of New York, in 1894,\r\nelected a reform government, with William L. Strong as Mayor. His\r\nadministration set up for the metropolis a new standard of city\r\nmanagement. Colonel George E. Waring organized, for the first time in\r\nthe city's history, an efficient streetcleaning department. Theodore\r\nRoosevelt was appointed Police Commissioner. These men and their\r\nassociates gave to New York a period of thrifty municipal housekeeping.\r\n\r\nBut the city returned to its filth. After the incorporation of Greater\r\nNew York and the election of Robert A. Van Wyck as its mayor, the great\r\nbeast of Tammany arose and extended its eager claws over the vast area\r\nof the new city.\r\n\r\nThe Mazet Committee was appointed by the legislature in 1899 to\r\ninvestigate rumors of renewed corruption. But the inquiry which followed\r\nwas not as penetrating nor as free from partizan bias as thoughtful\r\ncitizens wished. The principal exposure was of the Ice Trust, an attempt\r\nto monopolize the city's ice supply, in which city officials were\r\nstockholders, the mayor to the extent of 5000 shares, valued at\r\n$500,000. It was shown, too, that Tammany leaders were stockholders in\r\ncorporations which received favors from the city. Governor Roosevelt,\r\nhowever, refused to remove Mayor Van Wyck because the evidence against\r\nhim was insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe most significant testimony before the Mazet Committee was that given\r\nby Boss Croker himself. His last public office had been that of City\r\nChamberlain, 1889-90, at a salary of $25,000. Two years later he\r\npurchased for $250,000 an interest in a stock-farm and paid over\r\n$100,000 for some noted race-horses. He spent over half a million\r\ndollars on the English racetrack in three years and was reputed a\r\nmillionaire, owning large blocks of city real estate. He told the\r\ncommittee that he virtually determined all city nominations; and that\r\nall candidates were assessed, even judicial candidates, from $10,000\r\nto $25,000 for their nominations. \"We try to have a pretty effective\r\norganization--that's what we are there for,\" he explained. \"We are\r\ngiving the people pure organization government,\" even though the\r\norganizing took \"a lot of time\" and was \"very hard work.\" Tammany\r\nmembers stood by one another and helped each other, not only in politics\r\nbut in business. \"We want the whole business [city business] if we can\r\nget it.\" If \"we win, we expect everyone to stand by us.\" Then he uttered\r\nwhat must have been to every citizen of understanding a self-evident\r\ntruth, \"I am working for my pockets all the time.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Croker retired to his Irish castle, relinquishing the\r\nleadership to Charles Murphy, the present boss. The growing alertness of\r\nthe voters, however, makes Murphy's task a more difficult one than that\r\nof any of his predecessors. It is doubtful if the nature of the machine\r\nhas changed during all the years of its history. Tweed and Croker were\r\nonly natural products of the system. They typify the vulgar climax of\r\norganized looting.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the Independent Democrats, Republicans, and Progressives\r\nunited in a fusion movement. They nominated and, after a most spirited\r\ncampaign, elected John Purroy Mitchel as mayor. He was a young man, not\r\nyet forty, had held important city offices, and President Wilson had\r\nappointed him Collector of the Port of New York. His experience, his\r\nvigor, ability, and straight-dealing commended him to the friends of good\r\ngovernment, and they were not disappointed. The Mitchel regime set a\r\nnew record for clean and efficient municipal administration. Men of high\r\ncharacter and ability were enlisted in public service, and the Police\r\nDepartment, under Commissioner Woods, achieved a new usefulness.\r\nThe decent citizens, not alone in the metropolis, but throughout the\r\ncountry, believed with Theodore Roosevelt that Mr. Mitchel was \"the\r\nbest mayor New York ever had.\" But neither the effectiveness of\r\nhis administration nor the combined efforts of the friends of good\r\ngovernment could save him from the designs of Tammany Hall when, in\r\n1917, he was a candidate for reelection. Through a tactical blunder of\r\nthe Fusionists, a small Republican group was permitted to control the\r\nparty primaries and nominate a candidate of its own; the Socialists,\r\ngreatly augmented by various pacifist groups, made heavy inroads among\r\nthe foreign-born voters. And, while the whole power and finesse of\r\nTammany were assiduously undermining the mayor's strength, ethnic,\r\nreligious, partizan, and geographical prejudices combined to elect\r\nthe machine candidate, Judge Hylan, a comparatively unknown Brooklyn\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nHow could Tammany regain its power, and that usually within two\r\nyears, after such disclosures as we have seen? The main reason is the\r\nscientific efficiency of the organization. The victory of Burr in New\r\nYork in 1800 was the first triumph of the first ward machine in America,\r\nand Tammany has forgotten neither this victory nor the methods by which\r\nit was achieved. The organization which was then set in motion has\r\nsimply been enlarged to keep easy pace with the city's growth. There\r\nare, in fact, two organizations, Tammany Hall, the political machine,\r\nand Tammany Society, the \"Columbian Order\" organized by Mooney, which\r\nis ruled by sachems elected by the members. Both organizations, however,\r\nare one in spirit. We need concern ourselves only with the organization\r\nof Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nThe framework of Tammany Hall's machinery has always been the general\r\ncommittee, still known, in the phraseology of Burr's day, as \"the\r\nDemocratic-Republican General Committee.\" It is a very democratic body\r\ncomposed of representatives from every assembly district, apportioned\r\naccording to the number of voters in the district. The present\r\napportionment is one committeeman for every fifteen votes. This makes a\r\ncommittee of over 9000, an unwieldy number. It is justified, however, on\r\ntwo very practical grounds: first, that it is large enough to keep close\r\nto the voters; and second, that its assessment of ten dollars a member\r\nbrings in $90,000 a year to the war chest. This general committee holds\r\nstated meetings and appoints subcommittees. The executive committee,\r\ncomposed of the leaders of the assembly districts and the chairman and\r\ntreasurer of the county committee, is the real working body of the\r\ngreat committee. It attends to all important routine matters, selects\r\ncandidates for office, and conducts their campaigns. It is customary for\r\nthe members of the general committee to designate the district leaders\r\nfor the executive committee, but they are elected by their own districts\r\nrespectively at the annual primary elections. The district leader is a\r\nvery important wheel in the machine. He not only leads his district\r\nbut represents it on the executive committee; and this brotherhood of\r\nleaders forms the potent oligarchy of Tammany. Its sanction crowns the\r\nhigh chieftain, the boss, who, in turn, must be constantly on the alert\r\nthat his throne is not undermined; that is to say, he and his district\r\nleaders must \"play politics\" within their own bailiwicks to keep their\r\nheads on their own shoulders. After their enfranchisement in New York\r\n(1917) women were made eligible to the general and executive committees.\r\nThirty-seven were at once elected to the executive committee, and plans\r\nwere made to give them one-half of the representation on the general\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nEach of the twenty-three assembly districts is in turn divided into\r\nelection districts of about 400 voters, each with a precinct captain who\r\nis acquainted with every voter in his precinct and keeps track, as\r\nfar as possible, of his affairs. In every assembly district there are\r\nheadquarters and a club house, where the voters can go in the evening\r\nand enjoy a smoke, a bottle, and a more or less quiet game.\r\n\r\nThis organization is never dormant. And this is the key to its vitality.\r\nThere is no mystery about it. Tammany is as vigilant between elections\r\nas it is on election day. It has always been solicitous for the poor and\r\nthe humble, who most need and best appreciate help and attention. Every\r\npoor immigrant is welcomed, introduced to the district headquarters,\r\ngiven work, or food, or shelter. Tammany is his practical friend; and in\r\nreturn he is merely to become naturalized as quickly as possible under\r\nthe wardship of a Tammany captain and by the grace of a Tammany judge,\r\nand then to vote the Tammany ticket. The new citizen's lessons in\r\npolitical science are all flavored with highly practical notions.\r\n\r\nTammany's machinery enables a house-to-house canvass to be made in one\r\nday. But this machinery must be oiled. There are three sources of\r\nthe necessary lubricant: offices, jobs, the sale of favors; these are\r\ndependent on winning the elections. From its very earliest days,\r\nfraud at the polls has been a Tammany practice. As long as property\r\nqualifications were required, money was furnished for buying houses\r\nwhich could harbor a whole settlement of voters. It was not, however,\r\nuntil the adoption of universal suffrage that wholesale frauds became\r\npossible or useful; for with a limited suffrage it was necessary to sway\r\nonly a few score votes to carry an ordinary election.\r\n\r\nFernando Wood set a new pace in this race for votes. It has been\r\nestimated that in 1854 there \"were about 40,000 shiftless, unprincipled\r\npersons who lived by their wits and the labor of others. The trade of\r\na part of these was turning primary elections, packing nominating\r\nconventions, repeating, and breaking up meetings.\" Wood also\r\nsystematized naturalization. A card bearing the following legend was the\r\nopen sesame to American citizenship:\r\n\r\n     \"Common Pleas:\r\n      Please naturalize the bearer.\r\n      N. Seagrist, Chairman.\"\r\n\r\nSeagrist was one of the men charged by an aldermanic committee \"with\r\nrobbing the funeral pall of Henry Clay when his sacred person passed\r\nthrough this city.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Hoffman was first elected mayor, over 15,000 persons were\r\nregistered who could not be found at the places indicated. The\r\nnaturalization machinery was then running at high speed. In 1868, from\r\n25,000 to 30,000 foreigners were naturalized in New York in six weeks.\r\nOf 156,288 votes cast in the city, 25,000 were afterwards shown to be\r\nfraudulent. It was about this time that an official whose duty it was\r\nto swear in the election inspectors, not finding a Bible at hand, used a\r\nvolume of Ollendorf's \"New Method of Learning to Read, Write, and Speak\r\nFrench.\" The courts sustained this substitution on the ground that it\r\ncould not possibly have vitiated the election!\r\n\r\nA new federal naturalization law and rigid election laws have made\r\nwholesale frauds impossible; and the genius of Tammany is now attempting\r\nto adjust itself to the new immigration, the new political spirit, and\r\nthe new communal vigilance. Its power is believed by some optimistic\r\nobservers to be waning. But the evidences are not wanting that its\r\nvitality and internal discipline are still persistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. LESSER OLIGARCHIES\r\n\r\nNew York City is not unique in its experience with political bossdom.\r\nNearly every American city, in a greater or less degree, for longer or\r\nshorter periods, has been dominated by oligarchies.\r\n\r\nAround Philadelphia, American sentiment has woven the memories of great\r\nevents. It still remains, of all our large cities, the most \"American.\"\r\nIt has fewer aliens than any other, a larger percentage of home owners,\r\na larger number of small tradespeople and skilled artisans--the sort of\r\npopulation which democracy exalts, and who in turn are presumed to be\r\nthe bulwark of democracy. These good citizens, busied with the anxieties\r\nand excitements of their private concerns, discovered, in the decade\r\nfollowing the Civil War, that their city had slipped unawares into\r\nthe control of a compact oligarchy, the notorious Gas Ring. The city\r\ngovernment at this time was composed of thirty-two independent boards\r\nand departments, responsible to the council, but responsible to the\r\ncouncil in name only and through the medium of a council committee. The\r\ncoordinating force, the political gravitation which impelled all these\r\ndiverse boards and council committees to act in unison, was the Gas\r\nDepartment. This department was controlled by a few designing and\r\ncapable individuals under the captaincy of James McManes. They had\r\nreduced to political servitude all the employees of the department,\r\nnumbering about two thousand. Then they had extended their sway over\r\nother city departments, especially the police department. Through the\r\nconnivance of the police and control over the registration of voters,\r\nthey soon dominated the primaries and the nominating conventions.\r\nThey carried the banner of the Republican party, the dominant party in\r\nPhiladelphia and in the State, under which they more easily controlled\r\nelections, for the people voted \"regular.\" Then every one of the city's\r\nservants was made to pay to the Gas Ring money as well as obeisance.\r\nTradespeople who sold supplies to the city, contractors who did its\r\nwork, saloon-keepers and dive-owners who wanted protection--all paid.\r\nThe city's debt increased at the rate of $3,000,000 a year, without\r\nvisible evidence of the application of money to the city's growing\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the citizens finally aroused themselves and petitioned the\r\nlegislature for a new charter. They confessed: \"Philadelphia is now\r\nrecognized as the worst paved and worst cleaned city in the civilized\r\nworld. The water supply is so bad that during many weeks of the last\r\nwinter it was not only distasteful and unwholesome for drinking, but\r\noffensive for bathing purposes. The effort to clean the streets was\r\nabandoned for months and no attempt was made to that end until some\r\npublic-spirited citizens, at their own expense, cleaned a number of the\r\nprincipal thoroughfares.... The physical condition of the sewers\"\r\nis \"dangerous to the health and most offensive to the comfort of our\r\npeople. Public work has been done so badly that structures have to be\r\nrenewed almost as soon as finished. Others have been in part constructed\r\nat enormous expense and then permitted to fall to decay without\r\ncompletion.\" This is a graphic and faithful description of the result\r\nwhich follows government of the Ring, for the Ring, with the people's\r\nmoney. The legislature in 1885 granted Philadelphia a new charter,\r\ncalled the Bullitt Law, which went into effect in 1887, and which\r\ngreatly simplified the structure of the government and centered\r\nresponsibility in the mayor. It was then necessary for the Ring to\r\ncontrol primaries and win elections in order to keep the city within\r\nits clutches. So began in Philadelphia the practice of fraudulent\r\nregistering and voting on a scale that has probably never been equaled\r\nelsewhere in America. Names taken from tombstones in the cemeteries and\r\nfrom the register of births found their way to the polling registers.\r\nDogs, cats, horses, anything living or dead, with a name, served the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of these frauds was undertaken in 1900 by the Municipal\r\nLeague. In two wards, where the population had decreased one per cent\r\nin ten years (1890-1900), it was found that the registered voters had\r\nincreased one hundred per cent. From one house sixty-two voters were\r\nregistered, of sundry occupations as follows: \"Professors, bricklayers,\r\ngentlemen, moulders, cashiers, barbers, ministers, bakers, doctors,\r\ndrivers, bartenders, plumbers, clerks, cooks, merchants, stevedores,\r\nbookkeepers, waiters, florists, boilermakers, salesmen, soldiers,\r\nelectricians, printers, book agents, and restaurant keepers.\" One\r\nhundred and twenty-two voters, according to the register, lived at\r\nanother house, including nine agents, nine machinists, nine gentlemen,\r\nnine waiters, nine salesmen, four barbers, four bakers, fourteen clerks,\r\nthree laborers, two bartenders, a milkman, an optician, a piano-mover, a\r\nwindow-cleaner, a nurse, and so on.\r\n\r\nOn the day before the election the Municipal League sent registered\r\nletters to all the registered voters of certain precincts. Sixty-three\r\nper cent were returned, marked by the postman, \"not at,\" \"deceased,\"\r\n\"removed,\" \"not known.\" Of forty-four letters addressed to names\r\nregistered from one four-story house, eighteen were returned. From\r\nanother house, supposed to be sheltering forty-eight voters, forty-one\r\nwere returned; from another, to which sixty-two were sent, sixty-one\r\ncame back. The league reported that \"two hundred and fifty-two votes\r\nwere returned in a division that had less than one hundred legal voters\r\nwithin its boundaries.\" Repeating and ballot-box stuffing were common.\r\nElection officers would place fifty or more ballots in the box\r\nbefore the polls opened or would hand out a handful of ballots to the\r\nrecognized repeaters. The high-water mark of boss rule was reached under\r\nMayor Ashbridge, \"Stars-and-Stripes Sam,\" who had been elected in 1899.\r\nThe moderation of Martin, who had succeeded McManes as boss, was cast\r\naside; the mayor was himself a member of the Ring. When Ashbridge\r\nretired, the Municipal League reported: \"The four years of the Ashbridge\r\nadministration have passed into history leaving behind them a scar on\r\nthe fame and reputation of our city which will be a long time healing.\r\nNever before, and let us hope never again, will there be such brazen\r\ndefiance of public opinion, such flagrant disregard of public interest,\r\nsuch abuse of power and responsibility for private ends.\"\r\n\r\nSince that time the fortunes of the Philadelphia Ring have fluctuated.\r\nIts hold upon the city, however, is not broken, but is still strong\r\nenough to justify Owen Wister's observation: \"Not a Dickens, only a\r\nZola, would have the face (and the stomach) to tell the whole truth\r\nabout Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Louis was one of the first cities of America to possess the\r\nmuch-coveted home rule. The Missouri State Constitution of 1875 granted\r\nthe city the power to frame its own charter, under certain limitations.\r\nThe new charter provided for a mayor elected for four years with the\r\npower of appointing certain heads of departments; others, however,\r\nwere to be elected directly by the people. It provided for a Municipal\r\nAssembly composed of two houses: the Council, with thirteen members,\r\nelected at large for four years, and the House of Delegates, with\r\ntwenty-eight members, one from each ward, elected for two years. These\r\ntwo houses were given coordinate powers; one was presumed to be a check\r\non the other. The Assembly fixed the tax rate, granted franchises, and\r\npassed upon all public improvements. The Police Department was, however,\r\nunder the control of the mayor and four commissioners, the latter\r\nappointed by the Governor. The city was usually Republican by about 8000\r\nmajority; the State was safely Democratic. The city, until a few years\r\nago, had few tenements and a small floating population.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, all seemed well with the city until 1901, when the inside\r\nworkings of its government were revealed to the public gaze through\r\nthe vengeance of a disappointed franchise-seeker. The Suburban Railway\r\nCompany sought an extension of its franchises. It had approached the\r\nman known as the dispenser of such favors, but, thinking his price\r\n($145,000) too high, had sought to deal directly with the Municipal\r\nAssembly. The price agreed upon for the House of Delegates was $75,000;\r\nfor the Council, $60,000. These sums were placed in safety vaults\r\ncontrolled by a dual lock. The representative of the Company held one of\r\nthe keys; the representative of the Assembly, the other; so that neither\r\nparty could take the money without the presence of both. The Assembly\r\nduly granted the franchises; but property owners along the line of the\r\nproposed extension secured an injunction, which delayed the proceedings\r\nuntil the term of the venal House of Delegates had expired. The\r\nAssemblymen, having delivered the goods, demanded their pay. The\r\nCompany, held up by the courts, refused. Mutterings of the disappointed\r\nconspirators reached the ear of an enterprising newspaper reporter.\r\nThereby the Circuit Attorney, Joseph W. Folk, struck the trail of the\r\ngang. Both the president of the railway company and the \"agent\" of the\r\nrogues of the Assembly turned state's evidence; the safe-deposit\r\nboxes were opened, disclosing the packages containing one hundred and\r\nthirty-five $1000 bills.\r\n\r\nThis exposure led to others--the \"Central Traction Conspiracy,\" the\r\n\"Lighting Deal,\" the \"Garbage Deal.\" In the cleaning-up process,\r\nthirty-nine persons were indicted, twenty-four for bribery and fifteen\r\nfor perjury.\r\n\r\nThe evidence which Folk presented in the prosecution of these scoundrels\r\nmerely confirmed what had long been an unsavory rumor: that franchises\r\nand contracts were bought and sold like merchandise; that the buyers\r\nwere men of eminence in the city's business affairs; and that the\r\nsellers were the people's representatives in the Assembly. The Grand\r\nJury reported: \"Our investigation, covering more or less fully a period\r\nof ten years shows that, with few exceptions, no ordinance has been\r\npassed wherein valuable privileges or franchises are granted until those\r\ninterested have paid the legislators the money demanded for action in\r\nthe particular case.... So long has this practice existed that such\r\nmembers have come to regard the receipt of money for action on pending\r\nmeasures as a legitimate perquisite of a legislator.\"\r\n\r\nThese legislators, it appeared from the testimony, had formed a\r\nwater-tight ring or \"combine\" in 1899, for the purpose of systematizing\r\nthis traffic. A regular scale of prices was adopted: so much for an\r\nexcavation, so much per foot for a railway switch, so much for a street\r\npavement, so much for a grain elevator. Edward R. Butler was the master\r\nunder whose commands for many years this trafficking was reduced to\r\nsystematic perfection. He had come to St. Louis when a young man, had\r\nopened a blacksmith shop, had built up a good trade in horseshoeing, and\r\nalso a pliant political following in his ward. His attempt to defeat the\r\nhome rule charter in 1876 had given him wider prominence, and he soon\r\nbecame the boss of the Democratic machine. His energy, shrewdness,\r\nliberality, and capacity for friendship gave him sway over both\r\nRepublican and Democratic votes in certain portions of the city. A\r\nprominent St. Louis attorney says that for over twenty years \"he named\r\ncandidates on both tickets, fixed, collected, and disbursed campaign\r\nassessments, determined the results in elections, and in fine,\r\npractically controlled the public affairs of St. Louis.\" He was the\r\nagent usually sought by franchise-seekers, and he said that had the\r\nSuburban Company dealt with him instead of with the members of the\r\nAssembly, they might have avoided exposure. He was indicted four times\r\nin the upheaval, twice for attempting to bribe the Board of Health\r\nin the garbage deal--he was a stockholder in the company seeking the\r\ncontract--and twice for bribery in the lighting contract.\r\n\r\nCincinnati inherited from the Civil War the domestic excitements and\r\npolitical antagonisms of a border city. Its large German population gave\r\nit a conservative political demeanor, slow to accept changes, loyal\r\nto the Republican party as it was to the Union. This reduced partizan\r\nopposition to a docile minority, willing to dicker for public spoils\r\nwith the intrenched majority.\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Cox was for thirty years the boss of this city. Events had\r\nprepared the way for him. Following closely upon the war, Tom Campbell,\r\na crafty criminal lawyer, was the local leader of the Republicans, and\r\nJohn R. McLean, owner of the Cincinnati Enquirer, a very rich man, of\r\nthe Democrats. These two men were cronies: they bartered the votes\r\nof their followers. For some years crime ran its repulsive course:\r\nbrawlers, thieves, cutthroats escaped conviction through the defensive\r\ninfluence of the lawyer-boss. In 1880, Cox, who had served an\r\napprenticeship in his brother-in-law's gambling house, was elected\r\nto the city council. Thence he was promoted to the decennial board of\r\nequalization which appraised all real estate every ten years. There\r\nfollowed a great decrease in the valuation of some of the choicest\r\nholdings in the city. In 1884 there were riots in Cincinnati. After the\r\nacquittal of two brutes who had murdered a man for a trifling sum of\r\nmoney, exasperated citizens burned the criminal court house. The barter\r\nin justice stopped, but the barter in offices and in votes continued.\r\nThe Blaine campaign then in progress was in great danger. Cox, already\r\na master of the political game, promised the Republican leaders that\r\nif they would give him a campaign fund he would turn in a Republican\r\nmajority from Cincinnati. He did; and for many years thereafter the\r\nreturns from Hamilton County, in which Cincinnati is situated, brought\r\ncheer to Republican State headquarters on election night.\r\n\r\nCox was an unostentatious, silent man, giving one the impression\r\nof sullenness, and almost entirely lacking in those qualities of\r\ncomradeship which one usually seeks in the \"Boss\" type. From a barren\r\nlittle room over the \"Mecca\" saloon, with the help of a telephone,\r\nhe managed his machine. He never obtruded himself upon the public.\r\nHe always remained in the background. Nor did he ever take vast sums.\r\nModeration was the rule of his loot.\r\n\r\nBy 1905 a movement set in to rid the city of machine rule. Cox saw this\r\nmovement growing in strength. So he imported boatloads of floaters from\r\nKentucky. These floaters registered \"from dives, and doggeries, from\r\ncoal bins and water closets; no space was too small to harbor a man.\"\r\nFor once he threw prudence to the winds. Exposure followed; over 2800\r\nillegal voters were found. The newspapers, so long docile, now provided\r\nthe necessary publicity. A little paper, the Citizen's Bulletin, which\r\nhad started as a handbill of reform, when all the dailies seemed closed\r\nto the facts, now grew into a sturdy weekly. And, to add the capstone\r\nto Cox's undoing, William H. Taft, the most distinguished son of\r\nCincinnati, then Secretary of War in President Roosevelt's cabinet, in\r\na campaign speech in Akron, Ohio, advised the Republicans to repudiate\r\nhim. This confounded the \"regulars,\" and Cox was partially beaten. The\r\nreformers elected their candidate for mayor, but the boss retained his\r\nhold on the county and the city council. And, in spite of all that was\r\ndone, Cox remained an influence in politics until his death, May 20,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has had a varied and impressive political experience. The\r\nfirst legislature of California incorporated the mining town into the\r\ncity of San Francisco, April 15, 1850. Its government from the outset\r\nwas corrupt and inefficient. Lawlessness culminated in the murder of\r\nthe editor of the Bulletin, J. King of William, on May 14, 1856, and a\r\nvigilance committee was organized to clean up the city, and watch the\r\nballot-box on election day.\r\n\r\nSoon the legislature was petitioned to change the charter. The petition\r\nrecites: \"Without a change in the city government which shall diminish\r\nthe weight of taxation, the city will neither be able to discharge\r\nthe interest on debts already contracted, nor to meet the demands for\r\ncurrent disbursements.... The present condition of the streets and\r\npublic improvements of the city abundantly attest the total inefficiency\r\nof the present system.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislature passed the \"Consolidation Act,\" and from 1856 to 1900\r\ncounty and city were governed as a political unit. At first the hopes\r\nfor more frugal government seemed to be fulfilled. But all encouraging\r\nsymptoms soon vanished. Partizan rule followed, encouraged by the\r\ntinkering of the legislature, which imposed on the charter layer upon\r\nlayer of amendments, dictated by partizan craft, not by local needs.\r\nThe administrative departments were managed by Boards of Commissioners,\r\nunder the dictation of \"Blind Boss Buckley,\" who governed his kingdom\r\nfor many years with the despotic benevolence characteristic of his kind.\r\nThe citizens saw their money squandered and their public improvements\r\nlagging. It took twenty-five years to complete the City Hall, at a cost\r\nof $5,500,000. An official of the Citizens' Non-partizan party, in 1895,\r\nsaid: \"There is no city in the Union with a quarter of a million people,\r\nwhich would not be the better for a little judicious hanging.\"\r\n\r\nThe repeated attempts made by citizens of San Francisco to get a new\r\ncharter finally succeeded, and in 1900 the city hopefully entered a new\r\nepoch under a charter of its own making which contained several radical\r\nchanges. Executive responsibility was centered in the mayor, fortified\r\nby a comprehensive civil service. The foundations were laid for\r\nmunicipal ownership of public utilities, and the initiative and\r\nreferendum were adopted for all public franchises. The legislative power\r\nwas vested in a board of eighteen supervisors elected at large.\r\n\r\nNo other American city so dramatically represents the futility of\r\nbasing political optimism on a mere plan. It was only a step from the\r\nmediocrity enthroned by the first election under the new charter to the\r\ngross inefficiency and corruption of a new ring, under a new boss. A\r\nGrand Jury (called the \"Andrews Jury\") made a report indicating that\r\nthe administration was trafficking in favors sold to gamblers,\r\nprize-fighters, criminals, and the whole gamut of the underworld; that\r\nillegal profits were being reaped from illegal contracts, and that every\r\nbranch of the executive department was honeycombed with corruption. The\r\nGrand Jury believed and said all this, but it lacked the legal proof\r\nupon which Mayor Schmitz and his accomplices could be indicted. In spite\r\nof this report, Schmitz was reelected in 1905 as the candidate of the\r\nLabor-Union party.\r\n\r\nNow graft in San Francisco became simply universal. George Kennan,\r\nsummarizing the practices of the looters, says they \"took toll\r\neverywhere from everybody and in almost every imaginable way: they went\r\ninto partnership with dishonest contractors; sold privileges and permits\r\nto business men; extorted money from restaurants and saloons; levied\r\nassessments on municipal employees; shared the profits of houses of\r\nprostitution; forced beer, whiskey, champagne, and cigars on restaurants\r\nand saloons on commission; blackmailed gamblers, pool-sellers, and\r\npromoters of prize-fights; sold franchises to wealthy corporations;\r\ncreated such municipal bureaus as the commissary department and the\r\ncity commercial company in order to make robbery of the city more easy;\r\nleased rooms and buildings for municipal offices at exorbitant\r\nrates, and compelled the lessees to share profits; held up milkmen,\r\nkite-advertisers, junk-dealers, and even street-sweepers; and took\r\nbribes from everybody who wanted an illegal privilege and was willing\r\nto pay for it. The motto of the administration seemed to be 'Encourage\r\ndishonesty, and then let no dishonest dollar escape.'\"\r\n\r\nThe machinery through which this was effected was simple: the mayor had\r\nvast appointing powers and by this means directly controlled all the\r\ncity departments. But the mayor was only an automaton. Back of him was\r\nAbe Ruef, the Boss, an unscrupulous lawyer who had wormed his way into\r\nthe labor party, and manipulated the \"leaders\" like puppets. Ruef's game\r\nalso was elementary. He sold his omnipotence for cash, either under\r\nthe respectable cloak of \"retainer\" or under the more common device of\r\ncommissions and dividends, so that thugs retained him for their\r\nfreedom, contractors for the favors they expected, and public service\r\ncorporations for their franchises.\r\n\r\nFinally, through the persistence of a few private citizens, a Grand Jury\r\nwas summoned. Under the foremanship of B. P. Oliver it made a thorough\r\ninvestigation. Francis J. Heney was employed as special prosecutor and\r\nWilliam J. Burns as detective. Heney and Burns formed an aggressive\r\nteam. The Ring proved as vulnerable as it was rotten. Over three hundred\r\nindictments were returned, involving persons in every walk of life. Ruef\r\nwas sentenced to fourteen years in the penitentiary. Schmitz was freed\r\non a technicality, after being found guilty and sentenced to five years.\r\nMost of the other indictments were not tried, the prosecutor's attention\r\nhaving been diverted to the trail of the franchise-seekers, who have\r\nthus far eluded conviction.\r\n\r\nMinneapolis, a city blending New England traditions with Scandinavian\r\nthrift, illustrates, in its experiences with \"Doc\" Ames, the maneuvers\r\nof the peripatetic boss. Ames was four times mayor of the city, but\r\nnever his own successor. Each succeeding experience with him grew more\r\nlurid of indecency, until his third term was crystallized in Minneapolis\r\ntradition as \"the notorious Ames administration.\" Domestic scandal\r\nmade him a social outcast, political corruption a byword, and Ames\r\ndisappeared from public view for ten years.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 a new primary law provided the opportunity to return him to\r\npower for the fourth time. Ames, who had been a Democrat, now found it\r\nconvenient to become a Republican. The new law, like most of the early\r\nprimary laws, permitted members of one party to vote in the primaries\r\nof the other party. So Ames's following, estimated at about fifteen\r\nhundred, voted in the Republican primaries, and he became a regular\r\ncandidate of that party in a presidential year, when citizens felt the\r\nspecial urge to vote for the party.\r\n\r\nAmes was the type of boss with whom discipline is secondary to personal\r\naggrandizement. He had a passion for popularity; was imposing of\r\npresence; possessed considerable professional skill; and played\r\nconstantly for the support of the poor. The attacks upon him he turned\r\ninto political capital by saying that he was made a victim by the rich\r\nbecause he championed the poor. Susceptible to flattery and fond of\r\ndisplay, he lacked the power to command. He had followers, not henchmen.\r\nHis following was composed of the lowly, who were duped by his phrases,\r\nand of criminals, who knew his bent; and they followed him into any\r\nparty whither he found it convenient to go, Republican, Democratic, or\r\nPopulist.\r\n\r\nThe charter of Minneapolis gave the mayor considerable appointing power.\r\nHe was virtually the dictator of the Police Department. This was the\r\ngreat opportunity of Ames and his floating vote. His own brother, a weak\r\nindividual with a dubious record, was made Chief of Police. Within a few\r\nweeks about one-half of the police force was discharged, and the\r\nplaces filled with men who could be trusted by the gang. The number\r\nof detectives was increased and an ex-gambler placed at their head. A\r\nmedical student from Ames's office was commissioned a special policeman\r\nto gather loot from the women of the street.\r\n\r\nThrough a telepathy of their own, the criminal classes all over the\r\ncountry soon learned of the favorable conditions in Minneapolis, under\r\nwhich every form of gambling and low vice flourished; and burglars,\r\npickpockets, safe-blowers, and harlots made their way thither. Mr. W.\r\nA. Frisbie, the editor of a leading Minneapolis paper, described the\r\nsituation in the following words: \"It is no exaggeration to say that in\r\nthis period fully 99% of the police department's efficiency was devoted\r\nto the devising and enforcing of blackmail. Ordinary patrolmen on beats\r\nfeared to arrest known criminals for fear the prisoners would prove to\r\nbe 'protected'....The horde of detective favorites hung lazily about\r\npolice headquarters, waiting for some citizen to make complaint of\r\nproperty stolen, only that they might enforce additional blackmail\r\nagainst the thief, or possibly secure the booty for themselves. One\r\ndetective is now (1903) serving time in the state prison for retaining a\r\nstolen diamond pin.\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor thought he had a machine for grinding blackmail from every\r\ncriminal operation in his city, but he had only a gang, without\r\ndiscipline or coordinating power, and weakened by jealousy and\r\nsuspicion. The wonder is that it lasted fifteen months. Then came\r\nthe \"April Grand Jury,\" under the foremanship of a courageous and\r\nresourceful business man. The regime of criminals crumbled; forty-nine\r\nindictments, involving twelve persons, were returned.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury, however, at first stood alone in its investigations. The\r\ncrowd of politicians and vultures were against it, and no appropriations\r\nwere granted for getting evidence. So its members paid expenses out of\r\ntheir own pockets, and its foreman himself interviewed prisoners and\r\ndiscovered the trail that led to the Ring's undoing. Ames's brother was\r\nconvicted on second trial and sentenced to six and a half years in the\r\npenitentiary, while two of his accomplices received shorter terms. Mayor\r\nAmes, under indictment and heavy bonds, fled to Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe President of the City Council, a business man of education, tact,\r\nand sincerity, became mayor, for an interim of four months; enough time,\r\nas it proved, for him to return the city to its normal political life.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to illustrate the organization and working\r\nof the municipal machine. It must not be imagined by the reader that\r\nthese cities alone, and a few others made notorious by the magazine\r\nmuck-rakers, are the only American cities that have developed\r\noligarchies. In truth, not a single American city, great or small, has\r\nentirely escaped, for a greater or lesser period, the sway of a coterie\r\nof politicians. It has not always been a corrupt sway; but it has\r\nrarely, if ever, given efficient administration.\r\n\r\nHappily there are not wanting signs that the general conditions which\r\nhave fostered the Ring are disappearing. The period of reform set in\r\nabout 1890, when people began to be interested in the study of municipal\r\ngovernment. It was not long afterwards that the first authoritative\r\nbooks on the subject appeared. Then colleges began to give courses in\r\nmunicipal government; editors began to realize the public's concern in\r\nlocal questions and to discuss neighborhood politics as well as national\r\npolitics. By 1900 a new era broke--the era of the Grand Jury. Nothing so\r\nhopeful in local politics had occurred in our history as the disclosures\r\nwhich followed. They provoked the residuum of conscience in the\r\ncitizenry and the determination that honesty should rule in public\r\nbusiness and politics as well as in private transactions. The Grand Jury\r\ninquisitions, however, demonstrated clearly that the criminal law was no\r\nremedy for municipal misrule. The great majority of floaters and illegal\r\nvoters who were indicted never faced a trial jury. The results of the\r\nprosecutions for bribery and grosser political crimes were scarcely more\r\nencouraging. It is true that one Abe Ruef in a California penitentiary\r\nis worth untold sermons, editorials, and platform admonitions, and\r\nserves as a potent warning to all public malefactors. Yet the example is\r\nsoon forgotten; and the people return to their former political habits.\r\n\r\nBut out of this decade of gang-hunting and its impressive experiences\r\nwith the shortcomings of our criminal laws came the new municipal era\r\nwhich we have now fully entered, the era of enlightened administration.\r\nThis new era calls for a reconstruction of the city government. Its\r\nprincipal feature is the rapid spread of the Galveston or Commission\r\nform of government and of its modification, the City Manager plan, the\r\naim of which is to centralize governmental authority and to entice able\r\nmen into municipal office. And there are many other manifestations of\r\nthe new civic spirit. The mesmeric influence of national party names in\r\ncivic politics is waning; the rise of home rule for the city is severing\r\nthe unholy alliance between the legislature and the local Ring; the\r\npower to grant franchises is being taken away from legislative bodies\r\nand placed directly with the people; nominations are passing out of\r\nthe hands of cliques and are being made the gift of the voters through\r\npetitions and primaries; efficient reforms in the taxing and budgetary\r\nmachinery have been instituted, and the development of the merit system\r\nin the civil service is creating a class of municipal experts beyond the\r\nreach of political gangsters.\r\n\r\nThere have sprung up all sorts of collateral organizations to help\r\nthe officials: societies for municipal research, municipal reference\r\nlibraries, citizens' unions, municipal leagues, and municipal parties.\r\nThese are further supplemented by organizations which indirectly add to\r\nthe momentum of practical, enlightened municipal sentiment: boards\r\nof commerce, associations of business and professional men of every\r\nvariety, women's clubs, men's clubs, children's clubs, recreation clubs,\r\nsocial clubs, every one with its own peculiar vigilance upon some corner\r\nof the city's affairs. So every important city is guarded by a network\r\nof voluntary organizations.\r\n\r\nAll these changes in city government, in municipal laws and political\r\nmechanisms, and in the people's attitude toward their cities, have\r\ntended to dignify municipal service. The city job has been lifted to a\r\nhigher plane. Lord Rosebery, the brilliant chairman of the first London\r\nCounty Council, the governing body of the world's largest city, said\r\nmany years ago: \"I wish that my voice could extend to every municipality\r\nin the kingdom, and impress upon every man, however high his position,\r\nhowever great his wealth, however consummate his talents may be, the\r\nimportance and nobility of municipal work.\" It is such a spirit as\r\nthis that has made the government of Glasgow a model of democratic\r\nefficiency; and it is the beginnings of this spirit that the municipal\r\nhistorian finds developing in the last twenty years of American life. It\r\nis indeed difficult to see how our cities can slip back again into the\r\nclutches of bosses and rings and repeat the shameful history of the last\r\ndecades of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. LEGISLATIVE OMNIPOTENCE\r\n\r\nThe American people, when they wrote their first state constitutions,\r\nwere filled with a profound distrust of executive authority, the\r\noffspring of their experience with the arbitrary King George. So they\r\nsaw to it that the executive authority in their own government was\r\nreduced to its lowest terms, and that the legislative authority, which\r\nwas presumed to represent the people, was exalted to legal omnipotence.\r\nIn the original States, the legislature appointed many of the judicial\r\nand administrative officers; it was above the executive veto; it had\r\npolitical supremacy; it determined the form of local governments and\r\ndivided the State into election precincts; it appointed the delegates to\r\nthe Continental Congress, towards which it displayed the attitude of\r\na sovereign. It was altogether the most important arm of the state\r\ngovernment; in fact it virtually was the state government. The Federal\r\nConstitution created a government of specified powers, reserving to\r\nthe States all authority not expressly given to the central government.\r\nCongress can legislate only on subjects permitted by the Constitution;\r\non the other hand, a state legislature can legislate on any subject not\r\nexpressly forbidden. The state legislature possesses authority over a\r\nfar wider range of subjects than Congress--subjects, moreover, which\r\npress much nearer to the daily activities of the citizens, such as the\r\nwide realm of private law, personal relations, local government, and\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days, men of first-class ability, such as Alexander\r\nHamilton, Samuel Adams, and James Madison, did not disdain membership in\r\nthe state legislatures. But the development of party spirit and machine\r\npolitics brought with it a great change. Then came the legislative\r\ncaucus; and party politics soon reigned in every capital. As the\r\nlegislature was ruled by the majority, the dominant party elected\r\npresiding officers, designated committees, appointed subordinates, and\r\ncontrolled lawmaking. The party was therefore in a position to pay its\r\npolitical debts and bestow upon its supporters valuable favors. Further,\r\nas the legislature apportioned the various electoral districts, the\r\ndominant party could, by means of the gerrymander, entrench itself even\r\nin unfriendly localities. And, to crown its political power, it elected\r\nUnited States Senators. But, as the power of the party increased,\r\nunfortunately the personnel of the legislature deteriorated. Able men,\r\nas a rule, shunned a service that not only took them from their private\r\naffairs for a number of months, but also involved them in partizan\r\nrivalries and trickeries. Gradually the people came to lose confidence\r\nin the legislative body and to put their trust more in the Executive or\r\nelse reserved governmental powers to themselves. It was about 1835\r\nthat the decline of the legislature's powers set in, when new state\r\nconstitutions began to clip its prerogatives, one after another.\r\n\r\nThe bulky constitutions now adopted by most of the States are\r\neloquent testimony to the complete collapse of the legislature as an\r\nadministrative body and to the people's general distrust of their chosen\r\nrepresentatives. The initiative, referendum, recall, and the withholding\r\nof important subjects from the legislature's power, are among the\r\ndevices intended to free the people from the machinations of their\r\nwilful representatives.\r\n\r\nNow, most of the evils which these heroic measures have sought to\r\nremedy can be traced directly to the partizan ownership of the state\r\nlegislature. The boss controlling the members of the legislature could\r\nnot only dole out his favors to the privilege seekers; he could assuage\r\nthe greed of the municipal ring; and could, to a lesser degree, command\r\nfederal patronage by an entente cordiale with congressmen and senators;\r\nand through his power in presidential conventions and elections he had a\r\ndirect connection with the presidential office itself.\r\n\r\nIt was in the days before the legislature was prohibited from granting,\r\nby special act, franchises and charters, when banks, turnpike companies,\r\nrailroads, and all sorts of corporations came asking for charters,\r\nthat the figure of the lobbyist first appeared. He acted as a middleman\r\nbetween the seeker and the giver. The preeminent figure of this type in\r\nstate and legislative politics for several decades preceding the Civil\r\nWar was Thurlow Weed of New York. As an influencer of legislatures,\r\nhe stands easily first in ability and achievement. His great personal\r\nattractions won him willing followers whom he knew how to use. He was\r\nparty manager, as well as lobbyist and boss in a real sense long before\r\nthat term was coined. His capacity for politics amounted to genius. He\r\nnever sought office; and his memory has been left singularly free\r\nfrom taint. He became the editor of the Albany Journal and made it the\r\nleading Whig \"up-state\" paper. His friend Seward, whom he had lifted\r\ninto the Governor's chair, passed on to the United States Senate; and\r\nwhen Horace Greeley with the New York Tribune joined their forces, this\r\npotent triumvirate ruled the Empire State. Greeley was its spokesman,\r\nSeward its leader, but Weed was its designer. From his room No. 11\r\nin the old Astor House, he beckoned to forces that made or unmade\r\npresidents, governors, ambassadors, congressmen, judges, and\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nWith the tremendous increase of business after the Civil War, New York\r\nCity became the central office of the nation's business, and many of the\r\ninterests centered there found it wise to have permanent representatives\r\nat Albany to scrutinize every bill that even remotely touched their\r\nwelfare, to promote legislation that was frankly in their favor, and\r\nto prevent \"strikes\"--the bills designed for blackmail. After a time,\r\nhowever, the number of \"strikes\" decreased, as well as the number of\r\nlobbyists attending the session. The corporate interests had learned\r\nefficiency. Instead of dealing with legislators individually, they\r\narranged with the boss the price of peace or of desirable legislation.\r\nThe boss transmitted his wishes to his puppets. This form of government\r\ndepends upon a machine that controls the legislature. In New York both\r\nparties were moved by machines. \"Tom\" Platt was the \"easy boss\" of the\r\nRepublicans; and Tammany and its \"up-state\" affiliations controlled the\r\nDemocrats. \"Right here,\" says Platt in his Autobiography (1910), \"it\r\nmay be appropriate to say that I have had more or less to do with the\r\norganization of the New York legislature since 1873.\" He had. For forty\r\nyears he practically named the Speaker and committees when his party\r\nwon, and he named the price when his party lost. All that an \"interest\"\r\nhad to do, under the new plan, was to \"see the boss,\" and the powers of\r\ngovernment were delivered into its lap.\r\n\r\nSome of this legislative bargaining was revealed in the insurance\r\ninvestigation of 1905, conducted by the Armstrong Committee with Charles\r\nE. Hughes as counsel. Officers of the New York Life Insurance Company\r\ntestified that their company had given $50,000 to the Republican\r\ncampaign of 1904. An item of $235,000, innocently charged to \"Home\r\noffice annex account,\" was traced to the hands of a notorious lobbyist\r\nat Albany. Three insurance companies had paid regularly $50,000 each\r\nto the Republican campaign fund. Boss Platt himself was compelled\r\nreluctantly to relate how he had for fifteen years received ten one\r\nthousand dollar bundles of greenbacks from the Equitable Life as\r\n\"consideration\" for party goods delivered. John A. McCall, President of\r\nthe New York Life, said: \"I don't care about the Republican side of it\r\nor the Democratic side of it. It doesn't count at all with me. What is\r\nbest for the New York Life moves and actuates me.\"\r\n\r\nIn another investigation Mr. H. O. Havemeyer of the Sugar Trust said:\r\n\"We have large interests in this State; we need police protection and\r\nfire protection; we need everything that the city furnishes and gives,\r\nand we have to support these things. Every individual and corporation\r\nand firm--trust or whatever you call it--does these things and we do\r\nthem.\" No distinction is made, then, between the government that ought\r\nto furnish this \"protection\" and the machine that sells it!\r\n\r\nNo episode in recent political history shows better the relations of the\r\nlegislature to the political machine and the great power of invisible\r\ngovernment than the impeachment and removal of Governor William Sulzer\r\nin 1913. Sulzer had been four times elected to the legislature. He\r\nserved as Speaker in 1893. He was sent to Congress by an East Side\r\ndistrict in New York City in 1895 and served continuously until his\r\nnomination for Governor of New York in 1912. All these years he was\r\nknown as a Tammany man. During his campaign for Governor he made many\r\npromises for reform, and after his election he issued a bombastic\r\ndeclaration of independence. His words were discounted in the light of\r\nhis previous record. Immediately after his inauguration, however,\r\nhe began a house-cleaning. He set to work an economy and efficiency\r\ncommission; he removed a Tammany superintendent of prisons; made\r\nunusually good appointments without paying any attention to the machine;\r\nand urged upon the legislature vigorous and vital laws.\r\n\r\nBut the Tammany party had a large working majority in both houses, and\r\nthe changed Sulzer was given no support. The crucial moment came when\r\nan emasculated primary law was handed to him for his signature. An\r\neffective primary law had been a leading campaign issue, all the parties\r\nbeing pledged to such an enactment. The one which the Governor was now\r\nrequested to sign had been framed by the machine to suit its pleasure.\r\nThe Governor vetoed it. The legislature adjourned on the 3rd of May.\r\nThe Governor promptly reconvened it in extra session (June 7th) for the\r\npurpose of passing an adequate primary law. Threats that had been made\r\nagainst him by the machine now took form. An investigating committee,\r\nappointed by the Senate to examine the Governor's record, largely by\r\nchance happened upon \"pay dirt,\" and early on the morning of the 13th of\r\nAugust, after an all-night session, the Assembly passed a motion made by\r\nits Tammany floor leader to impeach the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe articles of impeachment charged: first, that the Governor had filed\r\na false report of his campaign expenses; second, that since he had made\r\nsuch statement under oath he was guilty of perjury; third, that he had\r\nbribed witnesses to withhold testimony from the investigating committee;\r\nfourth, that he had used threats in suppression of evidence before the\r\nsame tribunal; fifth, that he had persuaded a witness from responding to\r\nthe committee's subpoena; sixth, that he had used campaign contributions\r\nfor private speculation in the stock market; seventh, that he had used\r\nhis power as Governor to influence the political action of certain\r\nofficials; lastly, that he had used this power for affecting the stock\r\nmarket to his gain.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Governor, the first, second, and sixth charges had\r\na background of facts, although the rest were ridiculous and trivial. By\r\na vote of 43 to 12 he was removed from the governorship. The proceeding\r\nwas not merely an impeachment of New York's Governor. It was an\r\nimpeachment of its government. Every citizen knew that if Sulzer had\r\nobeyed Murphy, his shortcomings would never have been his undoing.\r\n\r\nThe great commonwealth of Pennsylvania was for sixty years under\r\nthe domination of the House of Cameron and the House of Quay. Simon\r\nCameron's entry into public notoriety was symbolic of his whole career.\r\nIn 1838, he was one of a commission of two to disburse to the Winnebago\r\nIndians at Prairie du Chien $100,000 in gold. But, instead of receiving\r\ngold, the poor Indians received only a few thousand dollars in the notes\r\nof a bank of which Cameron was the cashier. Cameron was for this reason\r\ncalled \"the Great Winnebago.\" He built a large fortune by canal and\r\nrailway contracts, and later by rolling-mills and furnaces. He was one\r\nof the first men in American politics to purchase political power by the\r\nlavish use of cash, and to use political power for the gratification of\r\nfinancial greed. In 1857 he was elected to the United States Senate as a\r\nRepublican by a legislature in which the Democrats had a majority.\r\nThree Democrats voted for him, and so bitter was the feeling against the\r\nrenegade trio that no hotel in Harrisburg would shelter them.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 he was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\r\nPresident Lincoln made him Secretary of War. But his management was so\r\nill-savored that a committee of leading business men from the largest\r\ncities of the country told the President that it was impossible to\r\ntransact business with such a man. These complaints coupled with\r\nother considerations moved Lincoln to dismiss Cameron. He did so in\r\ncharacteristic fashion. On January 11, 1862, he sent Cameron a curt note\r\nsaying that he proposed to appoint him minister to Russia. And\r\nthither into exile Cameron went. A few months later, the House of\r\nRepresentatives passed a resolution of censure, citing Cameron's\r\nemployment of irresponsible persons and his purchase of supplies\r\nby private contract instead of competitive bidding. The resolution,\r\nhowever, was later expunged from the records; and Cameron, on his return\r\nfrom Russia, again entered the Senate under circumstances so suspicious\r\nthat only the political influence of the boss thwarted an action for\r\nbribery. In 1877 he resigned, naming as his successor his son \"Don,\" who\r\nwas promptly elected.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another personage had appeared on the scene. \"Cameron\r\nmade the use of money an essential to success in politics, but Quay made\r\npolitics expensive beyond the most extravagant dreams.\" From the time\r\nhe arrived of age until his death, with the exception of three or four\r\nyears, Matthew S. Quay held public office. When the Civil War broke out,\r\nhe had been for some time prothonotary of Beaver County, and during the\r\nwar he served as Governor Curtin's private secretary. In 1865 he was\r\nelected to the legislature. In 1877 he induced the legislature to\r\nresurrect the discarded office of Recorder of Philadelphia, and for two\r\nyears he collected the annual fees of $40,000. In 1887 he was elected\r\nto the United States Senate, in which he remained except for a brief\r\ninterval until his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 came revelations of Quay's substantial interests in state\r\nmoneys. The suicide of the cashier of the People's Bank of Philadelphia,\r\nwhich was largely owned by politicians and was a favorite depository\r\nof state funds, led to an investigation of the bank's affairs, and\r\ndisclosed the fact that Quay and some of his associates had used state\r\nfunds for speculation. Quay's famous telegram to the cashier was found\r\namong the dead official's papers, \"If you can buy and carry a thousand\r\nMet. for me I will shake the plum tree.\"\r\n\r\nQuay was indicted, but escaped trial by pleading the statute of\r\nlimitations as preventing the introduction of necessary evidence against\r\nhim. A great crowd of shouting henchmen accosted him as a hero when he\r\nleft the courtroom, and escorted him to his hotel. And the legislature\r\nsoon thereafter elected him to his third term in the Senate.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, as well as Philadelphia, had its machine which was carefully\r\ngeared to Quay's state machine. The connection was made clear by the\r\ntestimony of William Flinn, a contractor boss, before a committee of the\r\nUnited States Senate. Flinn explained the reason for a written agreement\r\nbetween Quay on the one hand and Flinn and one Brown in behalf of Chris\r\nMagee, the Big Boss, on the other, for the division of the sovereignty\r\nof western Pennsylvania. \"Senator Quay told me,\" said Flinn, \"that\r\nhe would not permit us to elect the Republican candidate for mayor\r\nin Pittsburgh unless we adjust the politics to suit him.\" The people\r\nevidently had nothing to say about it.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of New York and Pennsylvania are by no means isolated;\r\nthey are illustrative. Very few States have escaped a legislative\r\nscandal. In particular, Rhode Island, Delaware, Illinois, Colorado,\r\nMontana, California, Ohio, Mississippi, Texas can give pertinent\r\ntestimony to the willingness of legislatures to prostitute their great\r\npowers to the will of the boss or the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE NATIONAL HIERARCHY\r\n\r\nAmerican political maneuver culminates at Washington. The Presidency and\r\nmembership in the Senate and the House of Representatives are the great\r\nstakes. By a venerable tradition, scrupulously followed, the judicial\r\ndepartment is kept beyond the reach of party greed.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution believed that they had contrived a\r\nmethod of electing the President and Vice-President which would preserve\r\nthe choice from partizan taint. Each State should choose a number of\r\nelectors \"equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to\r\nwhich the State may be entitled in the Congress.\" These electors were to\r\nform an independent body, to meet in their respective States and \"ballot\r\nfor two persons,\" and send the result of their balloting to the Capitol,\r\nwhere the President of the Senate, in the presence of the Senate and the\r\nHouse of Representatives, opened the certificates and counted the\r\nvotes. The one receiving the greatest number of votes was to be declared\r\nelected President, the one receiving the next highest number of votes,\r\nVice-President. George Washington was the only President elected by such\r\nan autonomous group. The election of John Adams was bitterly contested,\r\nand the voters knew, when they were casting their ballots in 1796,\r\nwhether they were voting for a Federalist or a Jeffersonian. From that\r\nday forward this greatest of political prizes has been awarded through\r\npartizan competition. In 1804 the method of selecting the Vice-President\r\nwas changed by the twelfth constitutional amendment. The electors since\r\nthat time ballot for President and Vice-President. Whatever may be\r\nthe legal privileges of the members of the Electoral College, they are\r\nconsidered, by the voters, as agents of the party upon whose tickets\r\ntheir names appear, and to abuse this relationship would universally be\r\ndeemed an act of perfidy.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution permits the legislatures of the States to determine how\r\nthe electors shall be chosen. In the earlier period, the legislatures\r\nelected them; later they were elected by the people; sometimes they were\r\nelected at large, but usually they were chosen by districts. And this\r\nis now the general custom. Since the development of direct nominations,\r\nthere has been a strong movement towards the abolition of the Electoral\r\nCollege and the election of the President by direct vote.\r\n\r\nThe President is the most powerful official in our government and\r\nin many respects he is the most powerful ruler in the world. He is\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy. His is virtually the sole\r\nresponsibility in conducting international relations. He is at the\r\nhead of the civil administration and all the important administrative\r\ndepartments are answerable to him. He possesses a vast power of\r\nappointment through which he dispenses political favors. His wish is\r\npotent in shaping legislation and his veto is rarely overridden. With\r\nCongress he must be in daily contact; for the Senate has the power of\r\nratifying or discarding his appointments and of sanctioning or rejecting\r\nhis treaties with foreign countries; and the House of Representatives\r\noriginates all money bills and thus possesses a formidable check upon\r\nexecutive usurpation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution originally reposed the choice of United States Senators\r\nwith the state legislatures. A great deal of virtue was to flow from\r\nsuch an indirect election. The members of the legislature were presumed\r\nto act with calm judgment and to choose only the wise and experienced\r\nfor the dignity of the toga. And until the period following the Civil\r\nWar the great majority of the States delighted to send their ablest\r\nstatesmen to the Senate. Upon its roll we find the names of many of our\r\nillustrious orators and jurists. After the Civil War, when the spirit of\r\ncommercialism invaded every activity, men who were merely rich began to\r\naspire to senatorial honors. The debauch of the state legislatures\r\nwhich was revealed in the closing year of the nineteenth century and\r\nthe opening days of the twentieth so revolted the people that the\r\nseventeenth constitutional amendment was adopted (1913) providing for\r\nthe election of senators by direct vote.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was designed to be the \"popular house.\"\r\nIts election from small districts, by direct vote, every two years is\r\na guarantee of its popular character. From this characteristic it has\r\nnever departed. It is the People's House. It originates all revenue\r\nmeasures. On its floor, in the rough and tumble of debate, partizan\r\nmotives are rarely absent.\r\n\r\nUpon this national tripod, the Presidency, the Senate, and the House, is\r\nbuilded the vast national party machine. Every citizen is familiar\r\nwith the outer aspect of these great national parties as they strive in\r\nplacid times to create a real issue of the tariff, or imperialism, or\r\nwhat not, so as to establish at least an ostensible difference between\r\nthem; or as they, in critical times, make the party name synonymous with\r\nnational security. The high-sounding platforms, the frenzied orators,\r\nthe parades, mass meetings, special trains, pamphlets, books,\r\neditorials, lithographs, posters--all these paraphernalia are\r\nconjured up in the voter's mind when he reads the words Democratic and\r\nRepublican.\r\n\r\nBut, from the standpoint of the professional politician, all this that\r\nthe voter sees is a mask, the patriotic veneer to hide the machine,\r\nthat complex hierarchy of committees ranging from Washington to every\r\ncross-roads in the Republic. The committee system, described in a former\r\nchapter, was perfected by the Republican party during the days of the\r\nCivil War, under the stress of national necessity. The great party\r\nleaders were then in Congress. When the assassination of Lincoln placed\r\nAndrew Johnson in power, the bitter quarrel between Congress and the\r\nPresident firmly united the Republicans; and in order to carry the\r\nmid-election in 1866, they organized a Congressional Campaign Committee\r\nto conduct the canvass. This practice has been continued by both\r\nparties, and in \"off\" years it plays a very prominent part in the party\r\ncampaign. Congress alone, however, was only half the conquest. It was\r\nonly through control of the Administration that access was gained to the\r\nsucculent herbage of federal pasturage and that vast political prestige\r\nwith the voter was achieved.\r\n\r\nThe President is nominally the head of his party. In reality he may not\r\nbe; he may be only the President. That depends upon his personality,\r\nhis desires, his hold upon Congress and upon the people, and upon the\r\ncircumstances of the hour. During the Grant Administration, as already\r\ndescribed, there existed, in every sense of the term, a federal machine.\r\nIt held Congress, the Executive, and the vast federal patronage in its\r\npower. All the federal office-holders, all the postmasters and their\r\nassistants, revenue collectors, inspectors, clerks, marshals, deputies,\r\nconsuls, and ambassadors were a part of the organization, contributing\r\nto its maintenance. We often hear today of the \"Federal Crowd,\" a term\r\nused to describe such appointees as still subsist on presidential and\r\nsenatorial favor. In Grant's time, this \"crowd\" was a genuine machine,\r\nconstructed, unlike some of its successors, from the center outward. But\r\nthe \"boss\" of this machine was not the President. It was controlled by\r\na group of leading Congressmen, who used their power for dictating\r\nappointments and framing \"desirable\" legislation. Grant, in the\r\nimagination of the people, symbolized the cause their sacrifices had\r\nwon; and thus his moral prestige became the cloak of the political\r\nplotters.\r\n\r\nA number of the ablest men in the Republican party, however, stood\r\naloof; and by 1876 a movement against the manipulators had set in. Civil\r\nservice reform had become a real issue. Hayes, the \"dark horse\" who\r\nwas nominated in that year, declared, in accepting the nomination, that\r\n\"reform should be thorough, radical, and complete.\" He promised not to\r\nbe a candidate for a second term, thus avoiding the temptation, to which\r\nalmost every President has succumbed, of using the patronage to secure\r\nhis reelection. The party managers pretended not to hear these promises.\r\nAnd when Hayes, after his inauguration, actually began to put them into\r\nforce, they set the whole machinery of the party against the President.\r\nMatters came to a head when the President issued an order commanding\r\nfederal office-holders to refrain from political activity. This order\r\nwas generally defied, especially in New York City in the post-office\r\nand customs rings. Two notorious offenders, Cornell and Arthur, were\r\ndismissed from office by the President. But the Senate, influenced\r\nby Roscoe Conkling's power, refused to confirm the President's new\r\nappointees; and under the Tenure of Office Act, which had been passed to\r\ntie President Johnson's hands, the offenders remained in office over a\r\nyear. The fight disciplined the President and the machine in about equal\r\nproportions. The President became more amenable and the machine less\r\narbitrary.\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield attempted the impossible feat of obliging both the\r\npoliticians and the reformers. He was persuaded to make nominations to\r\nfederal offices in New York without consulting either of the senators\r\nfrom that State, Conkling and Platt. Conkling appealed to the Senate\r\nto reject the New York appointees sent in by the President. The Senate\r\nfailed to sustain him. Conkling and his colleague Platt resigned from\r\nthe Senate and appealed to the New York legislature, which also refused\r\nto sustain them.\r\n\r\nWhile this absurd farce was going on, a more serious ferment was\r\nbrewing. On July 2, 1881, President Garfield was assassinated by a\r\ndisappointed office-seeker named Guiteau. The attention of the people\r\nwas suddenly turned from the ridiculous diversion of the Conkling\r\nincident to the tragedy and its cause. They saw the chief office in\r\ntheir gift a mere pawn in the game of place-seekers, the time and energy\r\nof their President wasted in bickerings with congressmen over petty\r\nappointments, and the machinery of their Government dominated by the\r\nmachinery of the party for ignoble or selfish ends.\r\n\r\nAt last the advocates of reform found their opportunity. In 1883 the\r\nCivil Service Act was passed, taking from the President about 14,000\r\nappointments. Since then nearly every President, towards the end of his\r\nterm, especially his second term, has added to the numbers, until\r\nnearly two-thirds of the federal offices are now filled by examination.\r\nPresident Cleveland during his second term made sweeping additions.\r\nPresident Roosevelt found about 100,000 in the classified service and\r\nleft 200,000. President Taft, before his retirement, placed in the\r\nclassified service assistant postmasters and clerks in first and\r\nsecond-class postoffices, about 42,000 rural delivery carriers, and over\r\n20,000 skilled workers in the navy yards.\r\n\r\nThe appointing power of the President, however, still remains the\r\nprincipal point of his contact with the machine. He has, of course,\r\nother means of showing partizan favors. Tariff laws, laws regulating\r\ninterstate commerce, reciprocity treaties, \"pork barrels,\" pensions,\r\nfinancial policies, are all pregnant with political possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe second official unit in the national political hierarchy is the\r\nHouse of Representatives, controlling the pursestrings, which have been\r\nthe deadly noose of many executive measures. The House is elected every\r\ntwo years, so that it may ever be \"near to the people\"! This produces a\r\nreflex not anticipated by the Fathers of the Constitution. It gives the\r\nrepresentative brief respite from the necessities of politics, and hence\r\nlittle time for the necessities of the State.\r\n\r\nThe House attained the zenith of its power when it arraigned President\r\nJohnson at the bar of the Senate for high crimes and misdemeanors in\r\noffice. It had shackled his appointing power by the Tenure of Office\r\nAct; it had forced its plan of reconstruction over his veto; and now it\r\nled him, dogged and defiant, to a political trial. Within a few years\r\nthe character of the House changed. A new generation interested in the\r\nissues of prosperity, rather than those of the war, entered public life.\r\nThe House grew unwieldy in size and its business increased alarmingly.\r\nThe minority, meanwhile, retained the power, through filibustering, to\r\nhold up the business of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was under such conditions that Speaker Reed, in 1890, crowned himself\r\n\"Czar\" by compelling a quorum. This he did by counting as actually\r\npresent all members whom the clerk reported as \"present but not voting.\"\r\nThe minority fought desperately for its last privilege and even took a\r\ncase to the Supreme Court to test the constitutionality of a law passed\r\nby a Reed-made quorum. The court concurred with the sensible opinion\r\nof the country that \"when the quorum is present, it is there for the\r\npurpose of doing business,\" an opinion that was completely vindicated\r\nwhen the Democratic minority became a majority and adopted the rule for\r\nits own advantage.\r\n\r\nBy this ruling, the Speakership was lifted to a new eminence. The\r\nparty caucus, which nominated the Speaker, and to which momentous party\r\nquestions were referred, gave solidarity to the party. But the influence\r\nof the Speaker, through his power of appointing committees, of referring\r\nbills, of recognizing members who wished to participate in debate,\r\ninsured that discipline and centralized authority which makes mass\r\naction effective. The power of the Speaker was further enlarged by the\r\ncreation of the Rules Committee, composed of the Speaker and two members\r\nfrom each party designated by him. This committee formed a triumvirate\r\n(the minority members were merely formal members) which set the limits\r\nof debate, proposed special rules for such occasions as the committee\r\nthought proper, and virtually determined the destiny of bills. So it\r\ncame about, as Bryce remarks, that the choice of the Speaker was \"a\r\npolitical event of the highest significance.\"\r\n\r\nIt was under the regency of Speaker Cannon that the power of the\r\nSpeaker's office attained its climax. The Republicans had a large\r\nmajority in the House and the old war-horses felt like colts. They\r\nassumed their leadership, however, with that obliviousness to youth\r\nwhich usually characterizes old age. The gifted and attractive Reed had\r\nruled often by aphorism and wit, but the unimaginative Cannon ruled by\r\nthe gavel alone; and in the course of time he and his clique of veterans\r\nforgot entirely the difference between power and leadership.\r\n\r\nEven party regularity could not long endure such tyranny. It was not\r\nagainst party organization that the insurgents finally raised\r\ntheir lances, but against the arbitrary use of the machinery of the\r\norganization by a small group of intrenched \"standpatters.\" The revolt\r\nbegan during the debate on the Payne-Aldrich tariff, and in the campaign\r\nof 1908 \"Cannonism\" was denounced from the stump in every part of the\r\ncountry. By March, 1910, the insurgents were able, with the aid of the\r\nDemocrats, to amend the rules, increasing the Committee on Rules to\r\nten to be elected by the House and making the Speaker ineligible for\r\nmembership. When the Democrats secured control of the House in the\r\nfollowing year, the rules were revised, and the selection of all\r\ncommittees is now determined by a Committee on Committees chosen in\r\nparty caucus. This change shifts arbitrary power from the shoulders of\r\nthe Speaker to the shoulders of the party chieftains. The power of the\r\nSpeaker has been lessened but by no means destroyed. He is still the\r\nparty chanticleer.\r\n\r\nThe political power of the House, however, cannot be calculated without\r\nadmitting to the equation the Senate, the third official unit, and,\r\nindeed, the most powerful factor in the national hierarchy. The Senate\r\nshares equally with the House the responsibility of lawmaking, and\r\nshares with the President the responsibility of appointments and of\r\ntreaty-making. It has been the scene of many memorable contests with the\r\nPresident for political control. The senators are elder statesmen, who\r\nhave passed through the refining fires of experience, either in law,\r\nbusiness, or politics. A senator is elected for six years; so that\r\nhe has a period of rest between elections, in which he may forget his\r\nconstituents in the ardor of his duties.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few decades a great change has come over the Senate,\r\nover its membership, its attitude towards public questions, and\r\nits relation to the electorate. This has been brought about through\r\ndisclosures tending to show the relations on the part of some senators\r\ntowards \"big business.\" As early as the Granger revelations of railway\r\nmachinations in politics, in the seventies, a popular distrust of the\r\nSenate became pronounced. No suggestion of corruption was implied, but\r\ncertain senators were known as \"railway senators,\" and were believed\r\nto use their partizan influence in their friends' behalf. This feeling\r\nincreased from year to year, until what was long suspected came suddenly\r\nto light, through an entirely unexpected agency. William Randolph\r\nHearst, a newspaper owner who had in vain attempted to secure a\r\nnomination for President by the Democrats and to get himself elected\r\nGovernor of New York, had organized and financed a party of his own, the\r\nIndependence League. While speaking in behalf of his party, in the fall\r\nof 1908, he read extracts from letters written by an official of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company to various senators. The letters, it later\r\nappeared, had been purloined from the Company's files by a faithless\r\nemployee. They caused a tremendous sensation. The public mind had become\r\nso sensitive that the mere fact that an intimacy existed between the\r\nmost notorious of trusts and some few United States senators--the\r\ncorrespondents called each other \"Dear John,\" \"Dear Senator,\" etc.--was\r\nsufficient to arouse the general wrath. The letters disclosed a keen\r\ninterest on the part of the corporation in the details of legislation,\r\nand the public promptly took the Standard Oil Company as a type.\r\nThey believed, without demanding tangible proof, that other great\r\ncorporations were, in some sinister manner, influencing legislation.\r\nRailroads, insurance companies, great banking concerns, vast industrial\r\ncorporations, were associated in the public mind as \"the Interests.\" And\r\nthe United States Senate was deemed the stronghold of the interests. A\r\nsaturnalia of senatorial muckraking now laid bare the \"oligarchy,\"\r\nas the small group of powerful veteran Senators who controlled\r\nthe senatorial machinery was called. It was disclosed that the\r\ncentralization of leadership in the Senate coincided with the\r\ncentralization of power in the Democratic and Republican national\r\nmachines. In 1911 and 1912 a \"money trust\" investigation was conducted\r\nby the Senate and a comfortable entente was revealed between a group\r\nof bankers, insurance companies, manufacturers, and other interests,\r\ncarried on through an elaborate system of interlocking directorates.\r\nFinally, in 1912, the Senate ordered its Committee on Privileges and\r\nElections to investigate campaign contributions paid to the national\r\ncampaign committees in 1904, 1908, and 1912. The testimony taken\r\nbefore this committee supplied the country with authentic data of the\r\ninterrelations of Big Business and Big Politics.\r\n\r\nThe revolt against \"Cannonism\" in the House had its counterpart in the\r\nSenate. By the time the Aldrich tariff bill came to a vote (1909),\r\nabout ten Republican senators rebelled. The revolt gathered momentum and\r\nculminated in 1912 in the organization of the National Progressive party\r\nwith Theodore Roosevelt as its candidate for President and Hiram Johnson\r\nof California for Vice-President. The majority of the Progressives\r\nreturned to the Republican fold in 1916. But the rupture was not healed,\r\nand the Democrats reelected Woodrow Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE AWAKENING\r\n\r\nIn the early days a ballot was simply a piece of paper with the names of\r\nthe candidates written or printed on it. As party organizations became\r\nmore ambitious, the party printed its own ballots, and \"scratching\"\r\nwas done by pasting gummed stickers, with the names of the substitutes\r\nprinted on them, over the regular ballot, or by simply striking out a\r\nname and writing another one in its place. It was customary to print the\r\ndifferent party tickets on different colored paper, so that the judges\r\nin charge of the ballot boxes could tell how the men voted. When later\r\nlaws required all ballots to be printed on white paper and of the same\r\nsize, the parties used paper of different texture. Election officials\r\ncould then tell by the \"feel\" which ticket was voted. Finally paper of\r\nthe same color and quality was enjoined by some States. But it was not\r\nuntil the State itself undertook to print the ballots that uniformity\r\nwas secured.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the peddling of tickets was a regular occupation on\r\nelection day. Canvassers invaded homes and places of business, and even\r\nsurrounded the voting place. It was the custom in many parts of the\r\ncountry for the voters to prepare the ballots before reaching the voting\r\nplace and carry them in the vest pocket, with a margin showing. This\r\nwas a sort of signal that the voter's mind had been made up and that\r\nhe should be let alone, yet even with this signal showing, in hotly\r\ncontested elections the voter ran a noisy gauntlet of eager solicitors,\r\nharassing him on his way to vote as cab drivers assail the traveler\r\nwhen he alights from the train. This free and easy method, tolerable in\r\nsparsely settled pioneer districts, failed miserably in the cities. It\r\nwas necessary to pass rigorous laws against vote buying and selling, and\r\nto clear the polling-place of all partizan soliciting. Penal provisions\r\nwere enacted against intimidation, violence, repeating, false swearing\r\nwhen challenged, ballot-box stuffing, and the more patent forms of\r\npartizan vices. In order to stop the practice of \"repeating,\" New York\r\nearly passed laws requiring voters to be duly registered. But the early\r\nlaws were defective, and the rolls were easily padded. In most of the\r\ncities poll lists were made by the party workers, and the name of each\r\nvoter was checked off as he voted. It was still impossible for the voter\r\nto keep secret his ballot. The buyer of votes could tell whether he got\r\nwhat he paid for; the employer, so disposed, could bully those dependent\r\non him into voting as he wished, and the way was open to all manner\r\nof tricks in the printing of ballots with misleading emblems, or with\r\ncertain names omitted, or with a mixture of candidates from various\r\nparties--tricks that were later forbidden by law but were none the less\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nRather suddenly a great change came over election day. In 1888\r\nKentucky adopted the Australian ballot for the city of Louisville,\r\nand Massachusetts adopted it for all state and local elections. The\r\nMassachusetts statute provided that before an election each political\r\nparty should certify its nominees to the Secretary of the Commonwealth.\r\nThe State then printed the ballots. All the nominees of all the parties\r\nwere printed on one sheet. Each office was placed in a separate column,\r\nthe candidates in alphabetical order, with the names of the parties\r\nfollowing. Blank spaces were left for those who wished to vote for\r\nothers than the regular nominees. This form of ballot prevented \"voting\r\nstraight\" with a single mark. The voter, in the seclusion of a booth at\r\nthe polling-place, had to pick his party's candidates from the numerous\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nIndiana, in 1889, adopted a similar statute but the ballot had certain\r\nmodifications to suit the needs of party orthodoxy. Here the columns\r\nrepresented parties, not offices. Each party had a column. Each column\r\nwas headed by the party name and its device, so that those who could not\r\nread could vote for the Rooster or the Eagle or the Fountain. There was\r\na circle placed under the device, and by making his mark in this circle\r\nthe voter voted straight.\r\n\r\nWithin eight years thirty-eight States and two Territories had adopted\r\nthe Australian or blanket ballot in some modified form. It was but a\r\nstep to the state control of the election machinery. Some state officer,\r\nusually the Secretary of State, was designated to see that the election\r\nlaws were enforced. In New York a State Commissioner of Elections was\r\nappointed. The appointment of local inspectors and judges remained for\r\na time in the hands of the parties. But soon in several States even this\r\npower was taken from them, and the trend now is towards appointing all\r\nelection officers by the central authority. These officers also have\r\ncomplete charge of the registration of voters. In some States, like New\r\nYork, registration has become a rather solemn procedure, requiring the\r\nanswering of many questions and the signing of the voter's name, all\r\nunder the threat of perjury if a wilful misrepresentation is made.\r\n\r\nSo passed out of the control of the party the preparation of the ballot\r\nand the use of the ballot on election day. Innumerable rules have been\r\nlaid down by the State for the conduct of elections. The distribution\r\nof the ballots, their custody before election, the order of electional\r\nprocedure, the counting of the ballots, the making of returns, the\r\ncustody of the ballot-boxes, and all other necessary details, are\r\nregulated by law under official state supervision. The parties are\r\nallowed watchers at the polls, but these have no official standing.\r\n\r\nIf a Revolutionary Father could visit his old haunts on election day, he\r\nwould be astonished at the sober decorum. In his time elections lasted\r\nthree days, days filled with harangue, with drinking, betting, raillery,\r\nand occasional encounters. Even those whose memory goes back to the\r\nCivil War can contrast the ballot peddling, the soliciting, the crowded\r\nnoisy polling-places, with the calm and quiet with which men deposit\r\ntheir ballots today. For now every ballot is numbered and no one is\r\npermitted to take a single copy from the room. Every voter must prepare\r\nhis ballot in the booth. And every polling-place is an island of\r\nimmunity in the sea of political excitement.\r\n\r\nWhile the people were thus assuming control of the ballot, they were\r\nproceeding to gain control of their legislatures. In 1890 Massachusetts\r\nenacted one of the first anti-lobby laws. It has served as a model for\r\nmany other States. It provided that the sergeant-at-arms should keep\r\ndockets in which were enrolled the names of all persons employed as\r\ncounsel or agents before legislative committees. Each counsel or\r\nagent was further compelled to state the length of his engagement, the\r\nsubjects or bills for which he was employed, and the name and address of\r\nhis employer.\r\n\r\nThe first session after the passage of this law, many of the\r\nprofessional lobbyists refused to enroll, and the most notorious ones\r\nwere seen no more in the State House. The regular counsel of railroads,\r\ninsurance companies, and other interests signed the proper docket and\r\nappeared for their clients in open committee meetings.\r\n\r\nThe law made it the duty of the Secretary of the Commonwealth to report\r\nto the law officers of the State, for prosecution, all those who failed\r\nto comply with the act. Sixty-seven such delinquents were reported the\r\nfirst year. The Grand Jury refused to indict them, but the number of\r\nrecalcitrants has gradually diminished.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Massachusetts is not unique. Other States passed more\r\nor less rigorous anti-lobby laws, and today, in no state Capitol, will\r\nthe visitor see the disgusting sights that were usual thirty years\r\nago--arrogant and coarse professional \"agents\" mingling on the floor\r\nof the legislature with members, even suggesting procedure to\r\npresiding officers, and not infrequently commandeering a majority. Such\r\ninfluences, where they persist, have been driven under cover.\r\n\r\nWith the decline of the professional lobbyist came the rise of the\r\nvolunteer lobbyist. Important bills are now considered in formal\r\ncommittee hearings which are well advertised so that interested parties\r\nmay be present. Publicity and information have taken the place of\r\nsecrecy in legislative procedure. The gathering of expert testimony by\r\nspecial legislative commissions of inquiry is now a frequent practice\r\nin respect to subjects of wide social import, such as workmen's\r\ncompensation, widows' pensions, and factory conditions.\r\n\r\nA number of States have resorted to the initiative and referendum\r\nas applied to ordinary legislation. By means of this method a small\r\npercentage of the voters, from eight to ten per cent, may initiate\r\nproposals and impose upon the voters the function of legislation. South\r\nDakota, in 1898, made constitutional provision for direct legislation.\r\nUtah followed in 1900, Oregon in 1902, Nevada in 1904, Montana in 1906,\r\nand Oklahoma in 1907. East of the Mississippi, several States have\r\nadopted a modified form of the initiative and referendum. In Oregon,\r\nwhere this device of direct government has been most assiduously\r\napplied, the voters in 1908 voted upon nineteen different bills and\r\nconstitutional amendments; in 1910 the number increased to thirty-two;\r\nin 1912, to thirty-seven; in 1914 it fell to twenty-nine. The vote cast\r\nfor these measures rarely exceeded eighty per cent of those voting at\r\nthe election and frequently fell below sixty.\r\n\r\nThe electorate that attempts to rid itself of the evils of the state\r\nlegislature by these heroic methods assumes a heavy responsibility. When\r\nthe burden of direct legislation is added to the task of choosing from\r\nthe long list of elective officers which is placed before the voter at\r\nevery local and state election, it is not surprising that there should\r\nset in a reaction in favor of simplified government. The mere separation\r\nof state and local elections does not solve the problem. It somewhat\r\nminimizes the chances of partizan influence over the voter in local\r\nelections; but the voter is still confronted with the long lists of\r\ncandidates for elective offices. Ballots not infrequently contain two\r\nhundred names, sometimes even three hundred or more, covering candidates\r\nof four or five parties for scores of offices. These blanket ballots are\r\nsometimes three feet long. After an election in Chicago in 1916, one of\r\nthe leading dailies expressed sympathy \"for the voter emerging from the\r\npolling-booth, clutching a handful of papers, one of them about half as\r\nlarge as a bed sheet.\" Probably most voters were able to express a real\r\npreference among the national candidates. It is almost equally certain\r\nthat most voters were not able to express a real preference among\r\nimportant local administrative officials. A huge ballot, all printed\r\nover with names, supplemented by a series of smaller ballots, can never\r\nbe a manageable instrument even for an electorate as intelligent as\r\nours.\r\n\r\nSimplification is the prophetic watchword in state government today. For\r\ncities, the City Manager and the Commission have offered salvation. A\r\nfew officers only are elected and these are held strictly responsible,\r\nsometimes under the constant threat of the recall, for the entire\r\nadministration. Over four hundred cities have adopted the form of\r\ngovernment by Commission. But nothing has been done to simplify our\r\nstate governments, which are surrounded by a maze of heterogeneous and\r\nundirected boards and authorities. Every time the legislature found\r\nitself confronted by a new function to be cared for, it simply created\r\na new board. New York has a hodgepodge of over 116 such authorities;\r\nMinnesota, 75; Illinois, 100. Iowa in 1913 and Illinois and Minnesota in\r\n1914, indeed, perfected elaborate proposals for simplifying their state\r\ngovernments. But these suggestions remain dormant. And the New York\r\nState Constitutional Convention in 1915 prepared a new Constitution for\r\nthe State, with the same end in view, but their work was not accepted\r\nby the people. It may be said, however, that in our attempt to\r\nrid ourselves of boss rule we have swung through the arc of direct\r\ngovernment and are now on the returning curve toward representative\r\ngovernment, a more intensified representative government that makes\r\nevasion of responsibility and duty impossible by fixing it upon one or\r\ntwo men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. PARTY REFORM\r\n\r\nThe State, at first, had paid little attention to the party, which was\r\nregarded as a purely voluntary aggregation of like-minded citizens.\r\nEvidently the State could not dictate that you should be a Democrat or\r\na Republican or force you to be an Independent. With the adoption of the\r\nAustralian ballot, however, came the legal recognition of the party; for\r\nas soon as the State recognized the party's designated nominees in the\r\npreparation of the official ballot, it recognized the party. It was\r\nthen discovered that, unless some restrictions were imposed, groups of\r\ninterested persons in the old parties would manage the nominations of\r\nboth to their mutual satisfaction. Thus a handful of Democrats would\r\nvisit Republican caucuses or primaries and a handful of Republicans\r\nwould return the favor to the Democrats. In other words, the bosses of\r\nboth parties would cooperate in order to secure nominations satisfactory\r\nto themselves. Massachusetts began the reform by defining a party as a\r\ngroup of persons who had cast a certain percentage of the votes at the\r\npreceding election. This definition has been widely accepted; and the\r\nnumber of votes has been variously fixed at from two to twenty-five per\r\ncent. Other States have followed the New York plan of fixing definitely\r\nthe number of voters necessary to form a party. In New York no fewer\r\nthan 10,000 voters can secure recognition as a state party, exception\r\nbeing made in favor of municipal or purely local parties. But merely\r\nfixing the numerical minimum of the party was not enough. The State took\r\nanother step forward in depriving the manipulator of his liberty when it\r\nundertook to determine who was entitled to membership in the party and\r\nprivileged to take part in its nominations and other party procedure.\r\nOtherwise the virile minority in each party would control both the\r\nmembership and the nominations.\r\n\r\nAn Oregon statute declares: \"Every political party and every volunteer\r\npolitical organization has the same right to be protected from the\r\ninterference of persons who are not identified with it, as its known and\r\npublicly avowed members, that the government of the State has to protect\r\nitself from the interference of persons who are not known and registered\r\nas its electors. It is as great a wrong to the people, as well as to\r\nmembers of a political party, for anyone who is not known to be one\r\nof its members to vote or take any part at any election, or other\r\nproceedings of such political party, as it is for one who is not a\r\nqualified and registered elector to vote at any state election or to\r\ntake part in the business of the State.\" It is a far reach from the\r\ndemocratic laissez faire of Jackson's day to this state dogmatism which\r\nthreatens the independent or detached voter with ultimate extinction.\r\n\r\nA variety of methods have been adopted for initiating the citizen into\r\nparty membership. In the Southern States, where the dual party system\r\ndoes not exist, the legislature has left the matter in the hands of\r\nthe duly appointed party officials. They can, with canonical rigor,\r\ndetermine the party standing of voters at the primaries. But where\r\nthere is party competition, such a generous endowment of power would be\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nMany States permit the voter to make his declaration of party allegiance\r\nwhen he goes to the primary. He asks for the ticket of the party whose\r\nnominees he wishes to help select. He is then handed the party's ballot,\r\nwhich he marks and places in the ballot-box of that party. Now, if he is\r\nchallenged, he must declare upon oath that he is a member of that party,\r\nthat he has generally supported its tickets and its principles, and that\r\nat the coming election he intends to support at least a majority of its\r\nnominees. In this method little freedom is left to the voter who wishes\r\nto participate as an independent both in the primaries and in the\r\ngeneral election.\r\n\r\nThe New York plan is more rigorous. Here, in all cities, the voter\r\nenrolls his name on his party's lists when he goes to register for\r\nthe coming election. He receives a ballot upon which are the following\r\nwords: \"I am in general sympathy with the principles of the party which\r\nI have designated by my mark hereunder; it is my intention to support\r\ngenerally at the next general election, state and national, the nominees\r\nof such party for state and national offices; and I have not enrolled\r\nwith or participated in any primary election or convention of any other\r\nparty since the first day of last year.\" On this enrollment blank he\r\nindicates the party of his choice, and the election officials deposit\r\nall the ballots, after sealing them in envelopes, in a special box. At a\r\ntime designated by law, these seals are broken and the party enrollment\r\nis compiled from them. These party enrollment books are public\r\nrecords. Everyone who cares may consult the lists. The advantages of\r\nsecrecy--such as they are--are thus not secured.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Wisconsin, the experimenting State, to find a way of\r\ninsuring secrecy. Here, when the voter goes to the primary, he is handed\r\na large ballot, upon which all the party nominations are printed. The\r\ndifferent party tickets are separated by perforations, so that the voter\r\nsimply tears out the party ticket he wishes to vote, marks it, and puts\r\nit in the box. The rejected tickets he deposits in a large waste basket\r\nprovided for the discards.\r\n\r\nWhile the party was being fenced in by legal definition, its machinery,\r\nthe intricate hierarchy of committees, was subjected to state scrutiny\r\nwith the avowed object of ridding the party of ring rule. The State\r\nCentral Committee is the key to the situation. To democratize this\r\ncommittee is a task that has severely tested the ingenuity of the State,\r\nfor the inventive capacity of the professional politician is prodigious.\r\nThe devices to circumvent the politician are so numerous and various\r\nthat only a few types can be selected to illustrate how the State is\r\ncarrying out its determination. Illinois has provided perhaps the most\r\ndemocratic method. In each congressional district, the voters, at the\r\nregular party primaries, choose the member of the state committee for\r\nthe district, who serves for a term of two years. The law says that \"no\r\nother person or persons whomsoever\" than those so chosen by the voters\r\nshall serve on the committee, so that members by courtesy or by\r\nproxy, who might represent the boss, are apparently shut off. The law\r\nstipulates the time within which the committee must meet and organize.\r\nUnder this plan, if the ring controls the committee, the fault lies\r\nwholly with the majority of the party; it is a self-imposed thraldom.\r\n\r\nIowa likewise stipulates that the Central Committee shall be composed of\r\none member from each congressional district. But the members are chosen\r\nin a state convention, organized under strict and minute regulations\r\nimposed by law. It permits considerable freedom to the committee,\r\nhowever, stating that it \"may organize at pleasure for political work as\r\nis usual and customary with such committees.\"\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin another plan was adopted in 1907. Here the candidates for\r\nthe various state offices and for both branches of the legislature and\r\nthe senators whose terms have not expired meet in the state capital at\r\nnoon on a day specified by law and elect by ballot a central committee\r\nconsisting of at least two members from each congressional district. A\r\nchairman is chosen in the same manner.\r\n\r\nMost States, however, leave some leeway in the choice of the state\r\ncommittee, permitting their election usually by the regular\r\nprimaries but controlling their action in many details. The lesser\r\ncommittees--county, city, district, judicial, senatorial, congressional,\r\nand others--are even more rigorously controlled by law.\r\n\r\nSo the issuing of the party platform, the principles on which it must\r\nstand or fall, has been touched by this process of ossification. Few\r\nStates retain the state convention in its original vigor. In all States\r\nwhere primaries are held for state nominations, the emasculated and\r\nsubdued convention is permitted to write the party platform. But not\r\nso in some States. Wisconsin permits the candidates and the hold-over\r\nmembers of the Senate, assembled according to law in a state meeting,\r\nto issue the platform. In other States, the Central Committee and the\r\nvarious candidates for state office form a party council and frame the\r\nplatform. Oregon, in 1901, tried a novel method of providing platforms\r\nby referendum. But the courts declared the law unconstitutional. So\r\nOregon now permits each candidate to write his own platform in not\r\nover one hundred words and file it with his nominating petition, and\r\nto present a statement of not over twelve words to be printed on the\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nThe convention system provided many opportunities for the manipulator\r\nand was inherently imperfect for nominating more than one or two\r\ncandidates for office. It has survived as the method of nominating\r\ncandidates for President of the United States because it is adapted to\r\nthe wide geographical range of the nation and because in the national\r\nconvention only a President and a Vice-President are nominated. In\r\nstate and county conventions, where often candidates for a dozen or\r\nmore offices are to be nominated, it was often subject to demoralizing\r\nbartering.\r\n\r\nThe larger the number of nominations to be made, the more complete was\r\nthe jobbery, and this was the death warrant of the local convention.\r\nThese evils were recognized as early as June 20, 1860, when the\r\nRepublican county convention of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, adopted\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, in nominating candidates for the several county offices, it\r\nclearly is, or ought to be, the object to arrive as nearly as possible\r\nat the wishes of the majority, or at least a plurality of the Republican\r\nvoters; and\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the present system of nominating by delegates, who virtually\r\nrepresent territory rather than votes, and who almost necessarily are\r\nwholly unacquainted with the wishes and feelings of their constituents\r\nin regard to various candidates for office, is undemocratic, because\r\nthe people have no voice in it, and objectionable, because men are\r\noften placed in nomination because of their location who are decidedly\r\nunpopular, even in their own districts, and because it affords too great\r\nan opportunity for scheming and designing men to accomplish their own\r\npurposes; therefore\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that we are in favor of submitting nominations directly to\r\nthe people--the Republican voters--and that delegate conventions for\r\nnominating county officers be abolished, and we hereby request and\r\ninstruct the county committee to issue their call in 1861, in accordance\r\nwith the spirit of this resolution.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the basis of this indictment of the county convention system, the\r\nRepublican voters of Crawford County, a rural community, whose largest\r\ntown is Meadville, the county seat, proceeded to nominate their\r\ncandidates by direct vote, under rules prepared by the county committee.\r\nThese rules have been but slightly changed. The informality of a hat\r\nor open table drawer has been replaced by an official ballotbox, and\r\nan official ballot has taken the place of the tickets furnished by each\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nThe \"Crawford County plan,\" as it was generally called, was adopted\r\nby various localities in many States. In 1866 California and New York\r\nenacted laws to protect primaries and nominating caucuses from fraud. In\r\n1871 Ohio and Pennsylvania enacted similar laws, followed by Missouri in\r\n1875 and New Jersey in 1878. By 1890 over a dozen States had passed\r\nlaws attempting to eliminate the grosser frauds attendant upon making\r\nnominations. In many instances it was made optional with the party\r\nwhether the direct plan should supersede the delegate plan. Only in\r\ncertain cities, however, was the primary made mandatory in these States.\r\nBy far the larger areas retained the convention.\r\n\r\nThere is noticeable in these years a gradual increase in the amount of\r\nlegislation concerning the nominating machinery--prescribing the\r\ndays and hours for holding elections of delegates, the size of the\r\npolling-place, the nature of the ballotbox, the poll-list, who might\r\nparticipate in the choice of delegates, how the returns were to be made,\r\nand so on. By the time, then, that the Australian ballot came, with\r\nits profound changes, nearly all the States had attempted to remove the\r\nglaring abuses of the nominating system; and several of them officially\r\nrecognized the direct primary. The State was reluctant to abolish the\r\nconvention system entirely; and the Crawford County plan long remained\r\nmerely optional. But in 1901 Minnesota enacted a state-wide, mandatory\r\nprimary law. Mississippi followed in 1902, Wisconsin in 1903, and Oregon\r\nin 1904. This movement has swept the country.\r\n\r\nFew States retain the nominating convention, and where it remains it is\r\nshackled by legal restrictions. The boss, however, has devised adequate\r\nmeans for controlling primaries, and a return to a modified convention\r\nsystem is being earnestly discussed in many States to circumvent the\r\nfurther ingenuity of the boss. A further step towards the state control\r\nof parties was taken when laws began to busy themselves with the conduct\r\nof the campaign. Corrupt Practices Acts began to assume bulk in the\r\nearly nineties, to limit the expenditure of candidates, and to enumerate\r\nthe objects for which campaign committees might legitimately spend\r\nmoney. These are usually personal traveling expenses of the candidates,\r\nrental of rooms for committees and halls for meetings, payment of\r\nmusicians and speakers and their traveling expenses, printing campaign\r\nmaterial, postage for distribution of letters, newspapers and printed\r\nmatter, telephone and telegraph charges, political advertising,\r\nemploying challengers at the polls, necessary clerk hire, and\r\nconveyances for bringing aged or infirm voters to the polls. The maximum\r\namount that can be spent by candidates is fixed, and they are required\r\nto make under oath a detailed statement of their expenses in both\r\nprimary and general elections. The various committees, also, must make\r\ndetailed reports of the funds they handle, the amount, the contributors,\r\nand the expenditures. Corporations are forbidden to contribute, and the\r\namount that candidates themselves may give is limited in many States.\r\nThese exactions are reinforced by stringent laws against bribery.\r\nPersons found guilty of either receiving or soliciting a bribe are\r\ngenerally disfranchised or declared ineligible for public office for a\r\nterm of years. Illinois, for the second offense, forever disfranchises.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that these restrictions have led the State to face\r\nthe question whether it should not itself bear some of the expenses\r\nof the campaign. It has, of course, already assumed an enormous burden\r\nformerly borne entirely by the party. The cost of primary and general\r\nelections nowadays is tremendous. A few Western States print a campaign\r\npamphlet and distribute it to every voter. The pamphlet contains usually\r\nthe photographs of the candidates, a brief biography, and a statement of\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal encroachments made by the Government upon the\r\nautonomy of the party. The details are endless. The election laws of New\r\nYork fill 330 printed pages. It is little wonder that American parties\r\nare beginning to study the organization of European parties, such as the\r\nlabor parties and the social democratic parties, which have enlisted a\r\nrather fervent party fealty. These are propagandist parties and require\r\nto be active all the year round. So they demand annual dues of their\r\nmembers and have permanent salaried officials and official party organs.\r\nSuch a permanent organization was suggested for the National Progressive\r\nparty. But the early disintegration of the party made impossible what\r\nwould have been an interesting experiment. After the election of 1916,\r\nGovernor Whitman of New York suggested that the Republican party choose\r\na manager and pay him $10,000 a year and have a lien on all his time and\r\nenergy. The plan was widely discussed and its severest critics were the\r\npoliticians who would suffer from it. The wide-spread comment with which\r\nit was received revealed the change that has come over the popular idea\r\nof a political party since the State began forty years ago to bring the\r\nparty under its control.\r\n\r\nBut flexibility is absolutely essential to a party system that\r\nadequately serves a growing democracy. And under a two-party system, as\r\nours is probably bound to remain, the independent voter usually holds\r\nthe balance of power. He may be merely a disgruntled voter seeking for\r\nrevenge, or an overpleased voter seeking to maintain a profitable\r\nstatus quo, or he may belong to that class of super-citizens from which\r\nmugwumps arise. In any case, the majorities at elections are usually\r\ndetermined by him. And party orthodoxy made by the State is almost as\r\ndistasteful to him as the rigor of the boss. He relishes neither the one\r\nnor the other.\r\n\r\nIn the larger cities the citizens' tickets and fusion movements\r\nare types of independent activities. In some cities they are merely\r\ntemporary associations, formed for a single, thorough housecleaning. The\r\nPhiladelphia Committee of One Hundred, which was organized in 1880\r\nto fight the Gas Ring, is an example. It issued a Declaration of\r\nPrinciples, demanding the promotion of public service rather than\r\nprivate greed, and the prosecution of \"those who have been guilty of\r\nelection frauds, maladministration of office, or misappropriation of\r\npublic funds.\" Announcing that it would endorse only candidates\r\nwho signed this declaration, the committee supported the Democratic\r\ncandidates, and nominated for Receiver of Taxes a candidate of its\r\nown, who became also the Democratic nominee when the regular Democratic\r\ncandidate withdrew. Philadelphia was overwhelmingly Republican. But the\r\ncommittee's aid was powerful enough to elect the Democratic candidate\r\nfor mayor by 6000 majority and the independent candidate for Receiver\r\nof Taxes by 20,000. This gave the Committee access to the records of\r\nthe doings of the Gas Ring. In 1884, however, the candidate which it\r\nendorsed was defeated, and it disbanded.\r\n\r\nSimilar in experience was the famous New York Committee of Seventy,\r\norganized in 1894 after Dr. Parkhurst's lurid disclosures of police\r\nconnivance with every degrading vice. A call was issued by thirty-three\r\nwell-known citizens for a non-partizan mass meeting, and at this meeting\r\na committee of seventy was appointed \"with full power to confer with\r\nother anti-Tammany organizations, and to take such actions as may be\r\nnecessary to further the objects of this meeting as set forth in the\r\ncall therefor, and the address adopted by this meeting.\" The committee\r\nadopted a platform, appointed an executive and a finance committee, and\r\nnominated a full ticket, distributing the candidates among both parties.\r\nAll other anti-Tammany organizations endorsed this ticket, and it\r\nwas elected by large majorities. The committee dissolved after having\r\nsecured certain charter amendments for the city and seeing its roster of\r\nofficers inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Voters' League of Chicago is an important example of the\r\npermanent type of citizens' organization. The league is composed of\r\nvoters in every ward, who, acting through committees and alert officers,\r\nscrutinize every candidate for city office from the Mayor down. It does\r\nnot aim to nominate a ticket of its own, but to exercise such vigilance,\r\nenforced by so effective an organization and such wide-reaching\r\npublicity, that the various parties will, of their own volition,\r\nnominate men whom the league can endorse. By thus putting on\r\nthe hydraulic pressure of organized public opinion, it has had a\r\nconsiderable influence on the parties and a very stimulating effect on\r\nthe citizenry.\r\n\r\nFinally, there has developed in recent years the fusion movement,\r\nwhereby the opponents of boss rule in all parties unite and back an\r\nindependent or municipal ticket. The election of Mayor Mitchel of New\r\nYork in 1913 was thus accomplished. In Milwaukee, a fusion has been\r\nsuccessful against the Socialists. And in many lesser cities this has\r\nbrought at least temporary relief from the oppression of the local\r\noligarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE EXPERT AT LAST\r\n\r\nThe administrative weakness of a democracy, namely, the tendency towards\r\na government by job-hunters, was disclosed even in the early days of the\r\nUnited States, when the official machinery was simple and the number of\r\noffices few. Washington at once foresaw both the difficulties and the\r\nduties that the appointing power imposed. Soon after his inauguration\r\nhe wrote to Rutledge: \"I anticipate that one of the most difficult and\r\ndelicate parts of the duty of any office will be that which relates\r\nto nominations for appointments.\" And he was most scrupulous and\r\npainstaking in his appointments. Fitness for duty was paramount with\r\nhim, though he recognized geographical necessity and distributed the\r\noffices with that precision which characterized all his acts.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams made very few appointments. After his term had expired, he\r\nwrote: \"Washington appointed a multitude of Democrats and Jacobins of\r\nthe deepest die. I have been more cautious in this respect.\"\r\n\r\nThe test of partizan loyalty, however, was not applied generally until\r\nafter the election of Jefferson. The ludicrous apprehensions of the\r\nFederalists as to what would follow upon his election were not allayed\r\nby his declared intentions. \"I have given,\" he wrote to Monroe, \"and\r\nwill give only to Republicans under existing circumstances.\" Jefferson\r\nwas too good a politician to overlook his opportunity to annihilate the\r\nFederalists. He hoped to absorb them in his own party, \"to unite\r\nthe names of Federalists and Republicans.\" Moderate Federalists, who\r\npossessed sufficient gifts of grace for conversion, he sedulously\r\nnursed. But he removed all officers for whose removal any special\r\nreason could be discovered. The \"midnight appointments\" of John Adams he\r\nrefused to acknowledge, and he paid no heed to John Marshall's dicta in\r\nMarbury versus Madison. He was zealous in discovering plausible excuses\r\nfor making vacancies. The New York Evening Post described him as \"gazing\r\nround, with wild anxiety furiously inquiring, 'how are vacancies to\r\nbe obtained?'\" Directly and indirectly, Jefferson effected, during his\r\nfirst term, 164 changes in the offices at his disposal, a large number\r\nfor those days. This he did so craftily, with such delicate regard for\r\ngeographical sensitiveness and with such a nice balance between fitness\r\nfor office and the desire for office, that by the end of his second term\r\nhe had not only consolidated our first disciplined and eager political\r\nparty, but had quieted the storm against his policy of partizan\r\nproscription.\r\n\r\nDuring the long regime of the Jeffersonian Republicans there were three\r\nsignificant movements. In January, 1811, Nathaniel Macon introduced\r\nhis amendment to the Constitution providing that no member of Congress\r\nshould receive a civil appointment \"under the authority of the United\r\nStates until the expiration of the presidential term in which such\r\nperson shall have served as senator or representative.\" An amendment was\r\noffered by Josiah Quincy, making ineligible to appointment the relations\r\nby blood or marriage of any senator or representative. Nepotism was\r\nconsidered the curse of the civil service, and for twenty years similar\r\namendments were discussed at almost every session of Congress. John\r\nQuincy Adams said that half of the members wanted office, and the other\r\nhalf wanted office for their relatives.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the Four Years' Act substituted a four-year tenure of office,\r\nin place of a term at the pleasure of the President, for most of the\r\nfederal appointments. The principal argument urged in favor of the law\r\nwas that unsatisfactory civil servants could easily be dropped without\r\nreflection on their character. Defalcations had been discovered to the\r\namount of nearly a million dollars, due mainly to carelessness and gross\r\ninefficiency. It was further argued that any efficient incumbent need\r\nnot be disquieted, for he would be reappointed. The law, however,\r\nfulfilled Jefferson's prophecy: it kept \"in constant excitement all the\r\nhungry cormorants for office.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Jefferson began, Jackson consummated. The stage was now set\r\nfor Democracy. Public office had been marshaled as a force in party\r\nmaneuver. In his first annual message, Jackson announced his philosophy:\r\n\r\n\"There are perhaps few men who can for any great length of time enjoy\r\noffice and power without being more or less under the influence\r\nof feelings unfavorable to the faithful discharge of their public\r\nduties.... Office is considered as a species of property, and government\r\nrather as a means of promoting individual interests than as an\r\ninstrument created solely for the service of the people. Corruption in\r\nsome, and in others a perversion of correct feelings and principles,\r\ndivert government from its legitimate ends and make it an engine for the\r\nsupport of the few at the expense of the many. The duties of all public\r\noffices are, or at least admit of being made, so plain, so simple\r\nthat men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their\r\nperformance.... In a country where offices are created solely for\r\nthe benefit of the people, no one man has any more intrinsic right to\r\nofficial station than another.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate refused Jackson's request for an extension of the Four Years'\r\nlaw to cover all positions in the civil service. It also refused to\r\nconfirm some of his appointments, notably that of Van Buren as minister\r\nto Great Britain. The debate upon this appointment gave the spoilsman an\r\nepigram. Clay with directness pointed to Van Buren as the introducer\r\n\"of the odious system of proscription for the exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise in the government of the United States.\" He continued: \"I\r\nunderstand it is the system on which the party in his own State, of\r\nwhich he is the reputed head, constantly acts. He was among the first of\r\nthe secretaries to apply that system to the dismission of clerks of his\r\ndepartment... known to me to be highly meritorious... It is a detestable\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Webster thundered: \"I pronounce my rebuke as solemnly and as\r\ndecisively as I can upon this first instance in which an American\r\nminister has been sent abroad as the representative of his party and not\r\nas the representative of his country.\"\r\n\r\nTo these and other challenges, Senator Marcy of New York made his\r\nwell-remembered retort that \"the politicians of the United States are\r\nnot so fastidious.... They see nothing wrong in the rule that to the\r\nvictor belong the spoils of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nJackson, with all his bluster and the noise of his followers, made his\r\nproscriptions relatively fewer than those of Jefferson. He removed\r\nonly 252 of about 612 presidential appointees. * It should, however, be\r\nremembered that those who were not removed had assured Jackson's agents\r\nof their loyalty to the new Democracy.\r\n\r\n     * This does not include deputy postmasters, who numbered\r\n     about 8000 and were not placed in the presidential list\r\n     until 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Jackson did not inaugurate the spoils system, he at least gave it a\r\nmission. It was to save the country from the curse of officialdom. His\r\nsuccessor, Van Buren, brought the system to a perfection that only\r\nthe experienced politician could achieve. Van Buren required of all\r\nappointees partizan service; and his own nomination, at Baltimore, was\r\nmade a foregone conclusion by the host of federal job-holders who were\r\ndelegates. Van Buren simply introduced at Washington the methods of the\r\nAlbany Regency.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs blustered bravely against this proscription. But their own\r\nPresident, General Harrison, \"Old Tippecanoe,\" was helpless against the\r\nsaturnalia of office-seekers that engulfed him. Harrison, when he came\r\nto power, removed about one-half of the officials in the service. And,\r\nalthough the partizan color of the President changed with Harrison's\r\ndeath, after a few weeks in office,--Tyler was merely a Whig of\r\nconvenience--there was no change in the President's attitude towards the\r\nspoils system.\r\n\r\nPresidential inaugurations became orgies of office-seekers, and the\r\nfirst weeks of every new term were given over to distributing the jobs,\r\nordinary business having to wait. President Polk, who removed the usual\r\nquota, is complimented by Webster for making \"rather good selections\r\nfrom his own friends.\" The practice, now firmly established, was\r\ncontinued by Taylor, Pierce, and Buchanan.\r\n\r\nLincoln found himself surrounded by circumstances that made caution\r\nnecessary in every appointment. His party was new and composed of many\r\ndiverse elements. He had to transform their jealousies into enthusiasm,\r\nfor the approach of civil war demanded supreme loyalty and unity of\r\naction. To this greater cause of saving the Union he bent every effort\r\nand used every instrumentality at his command. No one before him had\r\nmade so complete a change in the official personnel of the capital as\r\nthe change which he was constrained to make. No one before him or since\r\nused the appointing power with such consummate skill or displayed such\r\nrare tact and knowledge of human nature in seeking the advice of those\r\nwho deemed their advice valuable. The war greatly increased the number\r\nof appointments, and it also imposed obligations that made merit\r\nsometimes a secondary consideration. With the statesman's vision,\r\nLincoln recognized both the use and the abuse of the patronage system.\r\nHe declined to gratify the office-seekers who thronged the capital at\r\nthe beginning of his second term; and they returned home disappointed.\r\nThe twenty years following the Civil War were years of agitation\r\nfor reform. People were at last recognizing the folly of using the\r\nmultiplying public offices for party spoils. The quarrel between\r\nCongress and President Johnson over removals, and the Tenure of Office\r\nAct, focused popular attention on the constitutional question of\r\nappointment and removal, and the recklessness of the political manager\r\nduring Grant's two terms disgusted the thoughtful citizen.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to apply efficiency to the civil service had been\r\nmade when pass examinations were used for sifting candidates for\r\nclerkships in the Treasury Department in 1853, when such tests were\r\nprescribed by law for the lowest grade of clerkships. The head of the\r\ndepartment was given complete control over the examinations, and they\r\nwere not exacting. In 1864 Senator Sumner introduced a bill \"to provide\r\nfor the greater efficiency of the civil service.\" It was considered\r\nchimerical and dropped.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a steadfast and able champion of reform appeared in the\r\nHouse, Thomas A. Jenckes, a prominent lawyer of Rhode Island. A bill\r\nwhich he introduced in December, 1865, received no hearing. But in the\r\nfollowing year a select joint committee was charged to examine the\r\nwhole question of appointments, dismissals, and patronage. Mr. Jenckes\r\npresented an elaborate report in May, 1868, explaining the civil service\r\nof other countries. This report, which is the corner stone of American\r\ncivil service reform, provided the material for congressional debate and\r\nthrew the whole subject into the public arena. Jenckes in the House and\r\nCarl Schurz in the Senate saw to it that ardent and convincing defense\r\nof reform was not wanting. In compliance with President Grant's request\r\nfor a law to \"govern not the tenure, but the manner of making all\r\nappointments,\" a rider was attached to the appropriation bill in 1870,\r\nasking the President \"to prescribe such rules and regulations\" as he saw\r\nfit, and \"to employ suitable persons to conduct\" inquiries into the best\r\nmethod for admitting persons into the civil service. A commission of\r\nwhich George William Curtis was chairman made recommendations, but they\r\nwere not adopted and Curtis resigned. The New York Civil Service Reform\r\nAssociation was organized in 1877; and the National League, organized\r\nin 1881, soon had flourishing branches in most of the large cities. The\r\nbattle was largely between the President and Congress. Each succeeding\r\nPresident signified his adherence to reform, but neutralized his words\r\nby sanctioning vast changes in the service. Finally, under circumstances\r\nalready described, on January 16, 1883, the Civil Service Act was\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThis law had a stimulating effect upon state and municipal civil\r\nservice. New York passed a law the same year, patterned after the\r\nfederal act. Massachusetts followed in 1884, and within a few years many\r\nof the States had adopted some sort of civil service reform, and the\r\nlarge cities were experimenting with the merit system. It was not,\r\nhowever, until the rapid expansion of the functions of government and\r\nthe consequent transformation in the nature of public duties that civil\r\nservice reform made notable headway. When the Government assumed the\r\nduties of health officer, forester, statistician, and numerous other\r\nhighly specialized functions, the presence of the scientific expert\r\nbecame imperative; and vast undertakings, like the building of the\r\nPanama Canal and the enormous irrigation projects of the West, could not\r\nbe entrusted to the spoilsman and his minions.\r\n\r\nThe war has accustomed us to the commandeering of utilities, of science,\r\nand of skill upon a colossal scale. From this height of public devotion\r\nit is improbable that we shall decline, after the national peril\r\nhas passed, into the depths of administrative incompetency which our\r\nRepublic, and all its parts, occupied for so many years. The need for\r\nan efficient and highly complex State has been driven home to the\r\nconsciousness of the average citizen. And this foretokens the permanent\r\nenlistment of talent in the public service to the end that democracy\r\nmay provide that effective nationalism imposed by the new era of world\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\nThere is no collected material of the literature of exposure. It is\r\nfound in the official reports of investigating committees; such as the\r\nLexow, Mazet, and Fassett committees in New York, and the report\r\non campaign contributions by the Senate Committee on Privileges and\r\nElections (1913). The muckraker has scattered such indiscriminate\r\ncharges that great caution is necessary to discover the truth. Only\r\ntestimony taken under oath can be relied upon. And for local exposes the\r\nofficial court records must be sought.\r\n\r\nThe annual proceedings of the National Municipal League contain a great\r\ndeal of useful material on municipal politics. The reports of local\r\norganizations, such as the New York Bureau of Municipal Research and\r\nthe Pittsburgh Voters' League, are invaluable, as are the reports of\r\noccasional bodies, like the Philadelphia Committee of Fifty.\r\n\r\nPersonal touches can be gleaned from the autobiographies of such public\r\nmen as Platt, Foraker, Weed, La Follette, and in such biographies as\r\nCroly's \"M.
