We have begun obscurely to recognize that things\r\n   do not go of themselves, and that popular government is not in\r\n   itself a panacea, is no better than any other form except as the\r\n   virtue and wisdom of the people make it so, and that when men\r\n   undertake to do their own kingship, they enter upon, the dangers and\r\n   responsibilities as well as the privileges of the function. Above\r\n   all, it looks as if we were on the way to be persuaded that no\r\n   government can be carried on by declamation.”\r\n\r\n                 --JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONISTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFirst I am to write a love-story of long ago, of a time some little\r\nwhile after General Jackson had got into the White House and had shown\r\nthe world what a real democracy was. The Era of the first six Presidents\r\nhad closed, and a new Era had begun. I am speaking of political Eras.\r\nCertain gentlemen, with a pious belief in democracy, but with a firmer\r\ndetermination to get on top, arose,--and got in top. So many of these\r\ngentlemen arose in the different states, and they were so clever, and\r\nthey found so many chinks in the Constitution to crawl through and steal\r\nthe people's chestnuts, that the Era may be called the Boss-Era. After\r\nthe Boss came along certain Things without souls, but of many minds,\r\nand found more chinks in the Constitution: bigger chinks, for the Things\r\nwere bigger, and they stole more chestnuts. But I am getting far ahead\r\nof my love-story--and of my book.\r\n\r\nThe reader is warned that this first love-story will, in a few chapters,\r\ncome to an end: and not to a happy end--otherwise there would be no\r\nbook. Lest he should throw the book away when he arrives at this page,\r\nit is only fair to tell him that there is another and a much longer love\r\nstory later on, if he will only continue to read, in which, it is hoped,\r\nhe may not be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe hills seem to leap up against the sky as I describe that region\r\nwhere Cynthia Ware was born, and the very old country names help to\r\nsummon up the picture. Coniston Mountain, called by some the Blue\r\nMountain, clad in Hercynian forests, ten good miles in length, north and\r\nsouth, with its notch road that winds over the saddle behind the withers\r\nof it. Coniston Water, that oozes out from under the loam in a hundred\r\nplaces, on the eastern slope, gathers into a rushing stream to cleave\r\nthe very granite, flows southward around the south end of Coniston\r\nMountain, and having turned the mills at Brampton, idles through meadows\r\nwestward in its own green valley until it comes to Harwich, where it\r\nworks again and tumbles into a river. Brampton and Harwich are rivals,\r\nbut Coniston Water gives of its power impartially to each. From the\r\nlittle farm clearings on the western slope of Coniston Mountain you can\r\nsweep the broad valley of a certain broad river where grew (and grow\r\nstill) the giant pines that gave many a mast to King George's navy as\r\ntribute for the land. And beyond that river rises beautiful Farewell\r\nMountain of many colors, now sapphire, now amethyst, its crest rimmed\r\nabout at evening with saffron flame; and, beyond Farewell, the emerald\r\nbillows of the western peaks catching the level light. A dozen little\r\nbrooks are born high among the western spruces on Coniston to score\r\ndeep, cool valleys in their way through Clovelly township to the broad\r\nmusic of the water and fresh river-valleys full of the music of the\r\nwater and fresh with the odor of the ferns.\r\n\r\nTo this day the railroad has not reached Coniston Village--nay, nor\r\nConiston Flat, four miles nearer Brampton. The village lies on its own\r\nlittle shelf under the forest-clad slope of the mountain, and in the\r\nmidst of its dozen houses is the green triangle where the militia used\r\nto drill on June days. At one end of the triangle is the great pine mast\r\nthat graced no frigate of George's, but flew the stars and stripes\r\non many a liberty day. Across the road is Jonah Winch's store, with a\r\nplatform so high that a man may step off his horse directly on to it;\r\nwith its checker-paned windows, with its dark interior smelling of\r\ncoffee and apples and molasses, yes, and of Endea rum--for this was\r\nbefore the days of the revivals.\r\n\r\nHow those checker-paned windows bring back the picture of that village\r\ngreen! The meeting-house has them, lantern-like, wide and high, in three\r\nsashes--white meeting-house, seat alike of government and religion, with\r\nits terraced steeple, with its classic porches north and south. Behind\r\nit is the long shed, and in front, rising out of the milkweed and the\r\nflowering thistle, the horse block of the first meeting-house, where\r\nmany a pillion has left its burden in times bygone. Honest Jock\r\nHallowell built that second meeting-house--was, indeed, still building\r\nit at the time of which we write. He had hewn every beam and king post\r\nin it, and set every plate and slip. And Jock Hallowell is the man who,\r\nunwittingly starts this chronicle.\r\n\r\nAt noon, on one of those madcap April days of that Coniston country,\r\nJock descended from his work on the steeple to perceive the ungainly\r\nfigure of Jethro Bass coming toward him across the green. Jethro was\r\nabout thirty years of age, and he wore a coonskin cap even in those\r\ndays, and trousers tacked into his boots. He carried his big head\r\nbent forward, a little to one aide, and was not, at first sight, a\r\nprepossessing-looking person. As our story largely concerns him and we\r\nmust get started somehow, it may as well be to fix a little attention on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Heigho!” said Jock, rubbing his hands on his leather apron.\r\n\r\n“H-how be you, Jock?” said Jethro, stopping.\r\n\r\n“Heigho!” cried Jock, “what's this game of fox and geese you're\r\na-playin' among the farmers?”\r\n\r\n“C-callate to git the steeple done before frost?” inquired Jethro,\r\nwithout so much as a smile. “B-build it tight, Jock--b-build it tight.”\r\n\r\n“Guess he'll build his'n tight, whatever it is,” said Jock, looking\r\nafter him as Jethro made his way to the little tannery near by.\r\n\r\nLet it be known that there was such a thing as social rank in Coniston;\r\nand something which, for the sake of an advantageous parallel, we may\r\ncall an Established Church. Coniston was a Congregational town still,\r\nand the deacons and dignitaries of that church were likewise the pillars\r\nof the state. Not many years before the time of which we write actual\r\ndisestablishment had occurred, when the town ceased--as a town--to pay\r\nthe salary of Priest Ware, as the minister was called. The father\r\nof Jethro Bass, Nathan the currier, had once, in a youthful lapse,\r\npermitted a Baptist preacher to immerse him in Coniston Water. This had\r\nbeen the extent of Nathan's religion; Jethro had none at all, and was,\r\nfor this and other reasons, somewhere near the bottom of the social\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n“Fox and geese!” repeated Jock, with his eyes still on Jethro's\r\nretreating back. The builder of the meetinghouse rubbed a great, brown\r\narm, scratched his head, and turned and came face to face with Cynthia\r\nWare, in a poke bonnet.\r\n\r\nContrast is a favorite trick of authors, and no greater contrast is to\r\nbe had in Coniston than that between Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. In\r\nthe first place; Cynthia was the minister's daughter, and twenty-one.\r\nI can summon her now under the great maples of the village street, a\r\nvirginal figure, gray eyes that kindled the face shaded by the poke\r\nbonnet, and up you went above the clouds.\r\n\r\n“What about fox and geese, Jock?” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass,” said Jock, who, by reason of his ability, was a\r\nprivileged character. “Mark my words, Cynthy, Jethro Bass is an\r\nall-fired sight smarter that folks in this town think he be. They don't\r\ntake notice of him, because he don't say much, and stutters. He hain't\r\nbe'n eddicated a great deal, but I wouldn't be afeard to warrant he'd\r\nmake a racket in the world some of these days.”\r\n\r\n“Jock Hallowell!” cried Cynthia, the gray beginning to dance, “I suppose\r\nyou think Jethro's going to be President.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Jock, “you can laugh. Ever talked with Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“I've hardly spoken two words to him in my life,” she replied. And it\r\nwas true, although the little white parsonage was scarce two hundred\r\nyards from the tannery house.\r\n\r\n“Jethro's never ailed much,” Jock remarked, having reference to\r\nCynthia's proclivities for visiting the sick. “I've seed a good many\r\ndifferent men in my time, and I tell you, Cynthia Ware, that Jethro's\r\ngot a kind of power you don't often come acrost. Folks don't suspicion\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Cynthia was impressed by the ring of sincerity in\r\nthe builder's voice. Now that she thought of it, there was rugged power\r\nin Jethro's face, especially when he took off the coonskin cap. She\r\nalways nodded a greeting when she saw him in the tannery yard or on the\r\nroad, and sometimes he nodded back, but oftener he had not appeared to\r\nsee her. She had thought this failure to nod stupidity, but it might\r\nafter all be abstraction.\r\n\r\n“What makes you think he has ability?” she asked, picking flowers from a\r\nbunch of arbutus she held.\r\n\r\n“He's rich, for one thing,” said Jock. He had not intended a\r\ndissertation on Jethro Bass, but he felt bound to defend his statements.\r\n\r\n“Rich!”\r\n\r\n“Wal, he hain't poor. He's got as many as thirty mortgages round among\r\nthe farmers--some on land, and some on cattle.”\r\n\r\n“How did he make the money?” demanded Cynthia, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Hides an' wool an' bark--turned 'em over an' swep' in. Gits a load, and\r\nLyman Hull drives him down to Boston with that six-hoss team. Lyman gits\r\ndrunk, Jethro keeps sober and saves.”\r\n\r\nJock began to fashion some wooden pegs with his adze, for nails were\r\nscarce in those days. Still Cynthia lingered, picking flowers from the\r\nbunch.\r\n\r\n“What did you mean by 'fox and geese' Jock?” she said presently.\r\n\r\nJock laughed. He did not belong to the Establishment, but was a\r\nUniversalist; politically he admired General Jackson. “What'd you say if\r\nJethro was Chairman of the next Board of Selectmen?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Cynthia gasped. Jethro Bass, Chairman of the Board, in the\r\nhonored seat of Deacon Moses Hatch, the perquisite of the church in\r\nConiston! The idea was heresy. As a matter of fact, Jock himself uttered\r\nit as a playful exaggeration. Certain nonconformist farmers, of whom\r\nthere were not a few in the town, had come into Jonah Winch's store that\r\nmorning; and Jabez Miller, who lived on the north slope, had taken away\r\nthe breath of the orthodox by suggesting that Jethro Bass be nominated\r\nfor town office. Jock Hallowell had paused once or twice on his work\r\non the steeple to look across the tree-tops at Coniston shouldering the\r\nsky. He had been putting two and two together, and now he was merely\r\nmaking five out of it, instead of four. He remembered that Jethro Bass\r\nhad for some years been journeying through the town, baying his hides\r\nand wool, and collecting the interest on his mortgages.\r\n\r\nCynthia would have liked to reprove Jock Hallowell, and tell him\r\nthere were some subjects which should not be joked about. Jethro Bass,\r\nChairman of the Board of Selectmen!\r\n\r\n“Well, here comes, young Moses, I do believe,” said Jock, gathering his\r\npegs into his apron and preparing to ascend once more. “Callated he'd\r\nspring up pretty soon.”\r\n\r\n“Jock, you do talk foolishly for a man who is able to build a church,”\r\n said Cynthia, as she walked away. The young Moses referred to was Moses\r\nHatch, Junior, son of the pillar of the Church and State, and it was an\r\nopen secret that he was madly in love with Cynthia. Let it be said of\r\nhim that he was a steady-going young man, and that he sighed for the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n“Moses,” said the girl, when they came in sight of the elms that, shaded\r\nthe gable of the parsonage, “what do you think of Jethro Bass?”\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass!” exclaimed honest Moses, “whatever put him into your head,\r\nCynthy?” Had she mentioned perhaps, any other young man in Coniston,\r\nMoses would have been eaten with jealousy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jock was joking about him. What do you think of him?”\r\n\r\n“Never thought one way or t'other,” he answered. “Jethro never had\r\nmuch to do with the boys. He's always in that tannery, or out buyin' of\r\nhides. He does make a sharp bargain when he buys a hide. We always goes\r\nshares on our'n.”\r\n\r\nCynthia was not only the minister's daughter,--distinction enough,--her\r\nreputation for learning was spread through the country roundabout, and\r\nat the age of twenty she had had an offer to teach school in Harwich.\r\nOnce a week in summer she went to Brampton, to the Social library there,\r\nand sat at the feet of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom Brampton has\r\never been so proud--Lucretia Penniman, one of the first to sound the\r\nclarion note for the intellectual independence of American women; who\r\nwrote the “Hymn to Coniston”; who, to the awe of her townspeople,\r\nwent out into the great world and became editress of a famous woman's\r\njournal, and knew Longfellow and Hawthorne and Bryant. Miss Lucretia\r\nit was who started the Brampton Social Library, and filled it with such\r\nbooks as both sexes might read with profit. Never was there a stricter\r\nindex than hers. Cynthia, Miss Lucretia loved, and the training of that\r\nmind was the pleasantest task of her life.\r\n\r\nCuriosity as a factor has never, perhaps, been given its proper weight\r\nby philosophers. Besides being fatal to a certain domestic animal, as\r\nan instigating force it has brought joy and sorrow into the lives of men\r\nand women, and made and marred careers. And curiosity now laid hold of\r\nCynthia Ware. Why in the world she should ever have been curious about\r\nJethro Bass is a mystery to many, for the two of them were as far apart\r\nas the poles. Cynthia, of all people, took to watching the tanner's son,\r\nand listening to the brief colloquies he had with other men at Jonah\r\nWinch's store, when she went there to buy things for the parsonage; and\r\nit seemed to her that Jock had not been altogether wrong, and that there\r\nwas in the man an indefinable but very compelling force. And when\r\na woman begins to admit that a man has force, her curiosity usually\r\nincreases. On one or two of these occasions Cynthia had been startled to\r\nfind his eyes fixed upon her, and though the feeling she had was closely\r\nakin to fear, she found something distinctly pleasurable in it.\r\n\r\nMay came, and the pools dried up, the orchards were pink and white,\r\nthe birches and the maples were all yellow-green on the mountain sides\r\nagainst the dark pines, and Cynthia was driving the minister's gig to\r\nBrampton. Ahead of her, in the canon made by the road between the great\r\nwoods, strode an uncouth but powerful figure--coonskin cap, homespun\r\nbreeches tucked into boots, and all. The gig slowed down, and Cynthia\r\nbegan to tremble with that same delightful fear. She knew it must be\r\nwicked, because she liked it so much. Unaccountable thing! She felt\r\nall akin to the nature about her, and her blood was coursing as the sap\r\nrushes through a tree. She would not speak to him; of that she was sure,\r\nand equally sure that he would not speak to her. The horse was walking\r\nnow, and suddenly Jethro Bass faced around, and her heart stood still.\r\n\r\n“H-how be you, Cynthy?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Jethro?”\r\n\r\nA thrush in the woods began to sing a hymn, and they listened. After\r\nthat a silence, save for the notes of answering birds quickened by the\r\nsong, the minister's horse nibbling at the bushes. Cynthia herself could\r\nnot have explained why she lingered. Suddenly he shot a question at her.\r\n\r\n“Where be you goin'?”\r\n\r\n“To Brampton, to get Miss Lucretia to change this book,” and she held it\r\nup from her lap. It was a very large book.\r\n\r\n“Wh-what's it about,” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Napoleon Bonaparte.”\r\n\r\n“Who was be?”\r\n\r\n“He was a very strong man. He began life poor and unknown, and fought\r\nhis way upward until he conquered the world.”\r\n\r\n“C-conquered the world, did you say? Conquered the world?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nJethro pondered.\r\n\r\n“Guess there's somethin' wrong about that book--somethin' wrong. Conquer\r\nthe United States?”\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled. She herself did not realize that we were not a part of\r\nthe world, then.\r\n\r\n“He conquered Europe; where all the kings and queens are, and became a\r\nking himself--an emperor.”\r\n\r\n“I want to-know!” said Jethro. “You said he was a poor boy?”\r\n\r\n“Why don't you read the book, Jethro?” Cynthia answered. “I am sure I\r\ncan get Miss Lucretia to let you have it.”\r\n\r\n“Don't know as I'd understand it,” he demurred.\r\n\r\n“I'll try to explain what you don't understand,” said Cynthia, and her\r\nheart gave a bound at the very idea.\r\n\r\n“Will You?” he said, looking at her eagerly. “Will you? You mean it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” she answered, and blushed, not knowing why. “I-I must be\r\ngoing,” and she gathered up the reins.\r\n\r\n“When will you give it to me?”\r\n\r\n“I'll stop at the tannery when I come back from Brampton,” she said, and\r\ndrove on. Once she gave a fleeting glance over her shoulder, and he was\r\nstill standing where she had left him.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned, in the yellow afternoon light that flowed over wood\r\nand pasture, he came out of the tannery door. Jake Wheeler or Speedy\r\nBates, the journeyman tailoress, from whom little escaped, could not\r\nhave said it was by design--thought nothing, indeed, of that part of it.\r\n\r\n“As I live!” cried Speedy from the window to Aunt Lucy Prescott in the\r\nbed, “if Cynthy ain't givin' him a book as big as the Bible!”\r\n\r\nAunt Lucy hoped, first, that it was the Bible, and second, that Jethro\r\nwould read it. Aunt Lucy, and Established Church Coniston in general,\r\nbelieved in snatching brands from the burning, and who so deft as\r\nCynthia at this kind of snatching! So Cynthia herself was a hypocrite\r\nfor once, and did not know it. At that time Jethro's sins were mostly\r\nof omission. As far as rum was concerned, he was a creature after\r\nAunt Lucy's own heart, for he never touched it: true, gaunt Deacon\r\nIra Perkins, tithing-man, had once chided him for breaking the\r\nSabbath--shooting at a fox.\r\n\r\nTo return to the book. As long as he lived, Jethro looked back to the\r\njoy of the monumental task of mastering its contents. In his mind,\r\nNapoleon became a rough Yankee general; of the cities, villages, and\r\nfortress he formed as accurate a picture as a resident of Venice from\r\nMarco Polo's account of Tartary. Jethro had learned to read, after\r\na fashion, to write, add, multiply, and divide. He knew that George\r\nWashington and certain barefooted companions had forced a proud Britain\r\nto her knees, and much of the warring in the book took color from\r\nCaptain Timothy Prescott's stories of General Stark and his campaigns,\r\nheard at Jonah Winch's store. What Paris looked like, or Berlin, or the\r\nHospice of St. Bernard--though imaged by a winter Coniston--troubled\r\nJethro not at all; the thing that stuck in his mind was that\r\nNapoleon--for a considerable time, at least--compelled men to do his\r\nbidding. Constitutions crumble before the Strong. Not that Jethro\r\nphilosophized about constitutions. Existing conditions presented\r\nthemselves, and it occurred to him that there were crevices in the town\r\nsystem, and ways into power through the crevices for men clever enough\r\nto find them.\r\n\r\nA week later, and in these same great woods on the way to Brampton,\r\nCynthia overtook him once more. It was characteristic of him that he\r\nplunged at once into the subject uppermost in his mind.\r\n\r\n“Not a very big place, this Corsica--not a very big place.”\r\n\r\n“A little island in the Mediterranean,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Hum. Country folks, the Bonapartes--country folks?”\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you might call them so,” she said. “They were poor, and lived\r\nout of the world.”\r\n\r\n“He was a smart man. But he found things goin' his way. Didn't have to\r\nmove 'em.”\r\n\r\n“Not at first;” she admitted; “but he had to move mountains later. How\r\nfar have you read?”\r\n\r\n“One thing that helped him,” said Jethro, in indirect answer to this\r\nquestion, “he got a smart woman for his wife--a smart woman.”\r\n\r\nCynthia looked down at the reins in her lap, and she felt again that\r\nwicked stirring within her,--incredible stirring of minister's daughter\r\nfor tanner's son. Coniston believes, and always will believe, that the\r\nsocial bars are strong enough. So Cynthia looked down at the reins.\r\n\r\n“Poor Josephine!” she said, “I always wish he had not cast her off.”\r\n\r\n“C-cast her off?” said Jethro. “Cast her off! Why did he do that?”\r\n\r\n“After a while, when he got to be Emperor, he needed a wife who would\r\nbe more useful to him. Josephine had become a drag. He cared more about\r\ngetting on in the world than he did about his wife.”\r\n\r\nJethro looked away contemplatively.\r\n\r\n“Wa-wahn't the woman to blame any?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Read the book, and you'll see,” retorted Cynthia, flicking her horse,\r\nwhich started at all gaits down the road. Jethro stood in his tracks,\r\nstaring, but this time he did not see her face above the hood of the\r\ngig. Presently he trudged on, head downward, pondering upon another\r\nproblem than Napoleon's. Cynthia, at length, arrived in Brampton Street,\r\nin a humor that puzzled the good Miss Lucretia sorely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe sun had dropped behind the mountain, leaving Coniston in amethystine\r\nshadow, and the last bee had flown homeward from the apple blossoms in\r\nfront of Aunt Lucy Prescott's window, before Cynthia returned. Aunt Lucy\r\nwas Cynthia's grandmother, and eighty-nine years of age. Still she sat\r\nin her window beside the lilac bush, lost in memories of a stout, rosy\r\nlass who had followed a stalwart husband up a broad river into the\r\nwilderness some seventy years agone in Indian days--Weathersfield\r\nMassacre days. That lass was Aunt Lucy herself, and in just such a May\r\nhad Timothy's axe rung through the Coniston forest and reared the log\r\ncabin, where six of her children were born. Likewise in review passed\r\nthe lonely months when Timothy was fighting behind his rugged General\r\nStark for that privilege more desirable to his kind than life--self\r\ngovernment. Timothy Prescott would pull the forelock to no man, would\r\nhave such God-fearing persons as he chose make his laws for him.\r\n\r\nHonest Captain Timothy and his Stark heroes, Aunt Lucy and her memories,\r\nhave long gone to rest. Little did they dream of the nation we have\r\nlived to see, straining at her constitution like a great ship at anchor\r\nin a gale, with funnels belching forth smoke, and a new race of men\r\nthronging her decks for the mastery. Coniston is there still behind its\r\nmountain, with its rusty firelocks and its hillside graves.\r\n\r\nCynthia, driving back from Brampton in the gig, smiled at Aunt Lucy\r\nin the window, but she did not so much as glance at the tannery house\r\nfarther on. The tannery house, be it known, was the cottage where Jethro\r\ndwelt, and which had belonged to Nathan, his father; and the tannery\r\nsheds were at some distance behind it, nearer Coniston Water. Cynthia\r\ndid not glance at the tannery house, for a wave of orthodox indignation\r\nhad swept over her: at any rate, we may call it so. In other words,\r\nshe was angry with herself: pitied and scorned herself, if the truth be\r\ntold, for her actions--an inevitable mood.\r\n\r\nIn front of the minister's barn under the elms on the hill Cynthia\r\npulled the harness from the tired horse with an energy that betokened\r\nactivity of mind. She was not one who shrank from self-knowledge, and\r\nthe question put itself to her, “Whither was this matter tending?” The\r\nfire that is in strong men has ever been a lure to women; and many,\r\nmeaning to play with it, have been burnt thereby since the world began.\r\nBut to turn the fire to some use, to make the world better for it or\r\nstranger for it, that were an achievement indeed! The horse munching\r\nhis hay, Cynthia lingered as the light fainted above the ridge, with the\r\nthought that this might be woman's province, and Miss Lucretia Penniman\r\nmight go on leading her women regiments to no avail. Nevertheless she\r\nwas angry with Jethro, not because of what he had said, but because of\r\nwhat he was.\r\n\r\nThe next day is Sunday, and there is mild excitement in Coniston. For\r\nJethro Bass, still with the coonskin cap, but in a brass-buttoned\r\ncoat secretly purchased in Brampton, appeared at meeting! It made no\r\ndifference that he entered quietly, and sat in the rear slip, orthodox\r\nConiston knew that he was behind them: good Mr. Ware knew it, and\r\nchanged a little his prayers and sermon: Cynthia knew it, grew hot and\r\ncold by turns under her poke bonnet. Was he not her brand, and would she\r\nnot get the credit of snatching him? How willingly, then, would she have\r\ngiven up that credit to the many who coveted it--if it were a credit.\r\nWas Jethro at meeting for any religious purpose?\r\n\r\nJethro's importance to Coniston lay in his soul, and that soul was\r\nnumbered at present ninety and ninth. When the meeting was over, Aunt\r\nLucy Prescott hobbled out at an amazing pace to advise him to read\r\nchapter seven of Matthew, but he had vanished: via the horse sheds; if\r\nshe had known it, and along Coniston Water to the house by the tannery,\r\nwhere he drew breath in a state of mind not to be depicted. He had gazed\r\nat the back of Cynthia's poke bonnet for two hours, but he had an uneasy\r\nfeeling that he would have to pay a price.\r\n\r\nThe price was paid, in part, during the next six days. To do\r\nJethro's importance absolute justice, he did inspire fear among his\r\ncontemporaries, and young men and women did not say much to his face;\r\nwhat they did say gave them little satisfaction. Grim Deacon Ira stopped\r\nhim as he was going to buy hides, and would have prayed over him if\r\nJethro had waited; dear Aunt Lucy did pray, but in private. In six days\r\northodox Coniston came to the conclusion that this ninety and ninth soul\r\nwere better left to her who had snatched it, Cynthia Ware.\r\n\r\nAs for Cynthia, nothing was farther from her mind. Unchristian as was\r\nthe thought, if this thing she had awakened could only have been put\r\nback to sleep again, she would have thought herself happy. But would\r\nshe have been happy? When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor\r\nthan sincerity, he received the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those\r\ndays she welcomed Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston,\r\nincluding Moses himself, began thinking of a wedding.\r\n\r\nAnother Saturday came, and no Cynthia went to Brampton. Jethro may or\r\nmay not have been on the road. Sunday, and there was Jethro on the\r\nback seat in the meetinghouse: Sunday noon, over his frugal dinner, the\r\nminister mildly remonstrates with Cynthia for neglecting one who\r\nhas shown signs of grace, citing certain failures of others of his\r\ncongregation: Cynthia turns scarlet, leaving the minister puzzled and\r\na little uneasy: Monday, Miss Lucretia Penniman, alarmed, comes to\r\nConiston to inquire after Cynthia's health: Cynthia drives back with her\r\nas far as Four Corners, talking literature and the advancement of woman;\r\nreturns on foot, thinking of something else, when she discerns a figure\r\nseated on a log by the roadside, bent as in meditation. There was no\r\ngoing back the thing to do was to come on, as unconcernedly as possible,\r\nnot noticing anything,--which Cynthia did, not without a little inward\r\npalpitating and curiosity, for which she hated herself and looked the\r\nsterner. The figure unfolded itself, like a Jack from a box.\r\n\r\n“You say the woman wahn't any to blame--wahn't any to blame?”\r\n\r\nThe poke bonnet turned away. The shoulders under it began to shake, and\r\npresently the astonished Jethro heard what seemed to be faint peals of\r\nlaughter. Suddenly she turned around to him, all trace of laughter gone.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you read the book?”\r\n\r\n“So I am,” said Jethro, “so I am. Hain't come to this casting-off yet.”\r\n\r\n“And you didn't look ahead to find out?” This with scorn.\r\n\r\n“Never heard of readin' a book in that fashion. I'll come to it in\r\ntime--g-guess it won't run away.”\r\n\r\nCynthia stared at him, perhaps with a new interest at this plodding\r\ndetermination. She was not quite sure that she ought to stand talking\r\nto him a third time in these woods, especially if the subject of\r\nconversation were not, as Coniston thought, the salvation of his soul.\r\nBut she stayed. Here was a woman who could be dealt with by no known\r\nrules, who did not even deign to notice a week of marked coldness.\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” she said, with a terrifying sternness, “I am going to ask you\r\na question, and you must answer me truthfully.”\r\n\r\n“G-guess I won't find any trouble about that,” said Jethro, apparently\r\nnot in the least terrified.\r\n\r\n“I want you to tell me why you are going to meeting.”\r\n\r\n“To see you,” said Jethro, promptly, “to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you know that that is wrong?”\r\n\r\n“H-hadn't thought much about it,” answered Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Well, you should think about it. People don't go to meeting to--to look\r\nat other people.”\r\n\r\n“Thought they did,” said Jethro. “W-why do they wear their best\r\nclothes--why do they wear their best clothes?”\r\n\r\n“To honor God,” said Cynthia, with a shade lacking in the conviction,\r\nfor she added hurriedly: “It isn't right for you to go to church to\r\nsee--anybody. You go there to hear the Scriptures expounded, and to\r\nhave your sins forgiven. Because I lent you that book, and you come to\r\nmeeting, people think I'm converting you.”\r\n\r\n“So you be,” replied Jethro, and this time it was he who smiled, “so you\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nCynthia turned away, her lips pressed together: How to deal with such a\r\nman! Wondrous notes broke on the stillness, the thrush was singing\r\nhis hymn again, only now it seemed a paean. High in the azure a hawk\r\nwheeled, and floated.\r\n\r\n“Couldn't you see I was very angry with you?”\r\n\r\n“S-saw you was goin' with Moses Hatch more than common.”\r\n\r\nCynthia drew breath sharply. This was audacity--and yet she liked it.\r\n\r\n“I am very fond of Moses,” she said quickly.\r\n\r\n“You always was charitable, Cynthy,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Haven't I been charitable to you?” she retorted.\r\n\r\n“G-guess it has be'n charity,” said Jethro. He looked down at her\r\nsolemnly, thoughtfully, no trace of anger in his face, turned, and\r\nwithout another word strode off in the direction of Coniston Flat.\r\n\r\nHe left a tumultuous Cynthia, amazement and repentance struggling with\r\nanger, which forbade her calling him back: pride in her answering to\r\npride in him, and she rejoicing fiercely that he had pride. Had he but\r\nknown it, every step he took away from her that evening was a step in\r\nadvance, and she gloried in the fact that he did not once look back. As\r\nshe walked toward Coniston, the thought came to her that she was rid of\r\nthe thing she had stirred up, perhaps forever, and the thrush burst into\r\nhis song once more.\r\n\r\nThat night, after Cynthia's candle had gone out, when the minister\r\nsat on his doorsteps looking at the glory of the moon on the mountain\r\nforest, he was startled by the sight of a figure slowly climbing toward\r\nhim up the slope. A second glance told him that it was Jethro's. Vaguely\r\ntroubled, he watched his approach; for good Priest Ware, while able\r\nto obey one-half the scriptural injunction, had not the wisdom of the\r\nserpent, and women, as typified by Cynthia, were a continual puzzle to\r\nhim. That very evening, Moses Hatch had called, had been received with\r\nmore favor than usual, and suddenly packed off about his business.\r\nSeated in the moonlight, the minister wondered vaguely whether Jethro\r\nBass were troubling the girl. And now Jethro stood before him,\r\nholding out a book. Rising, Mr. Ware bade him good evening, mildly and\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\n“C-come to leave this book for Cynthy,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Ware took it, mechanically.\r\n\r\n“Have you finished it?” he asked kindly.\r\n\r\n“All I want,” replied Jethro, “all I want.”\r\n\r\nHe turned, and went down the slope. Twice the words rose to the\r\nminister's lips to call him back, and were suppressed. Yet what to say\r\nto him if he came? Mr. Ware sat down again, sadly wondering why Jethro\r\nBass should be so difficult to talk to.\r\n\r\nThe parsonage was of only one story, with a steep, sloping roof. On the\r\nleft of the doorway was Cynthia's room, and the minister imagined he\r\nheard a faint, rustling noise at her window. Presently he arose, barred\r\nthe door; could be heard moving around in his room for a while,\r\nand after that all was silence save for the mournful crying of a\r\nwhippoorwill in the woods. Then a door opened softly, a white vision\r\nstole into the little entry lighted by the fan-window, above, seized\r\nthe book and stole back. Had the minister been a prying man about his\r\nhousehold, he would have noticed next day that Cynthia's candle was\r\nburned down to the socket. He saw nothing of the kind: he saw, in fact,\r\nthat his daughter flitted about the house singing, and he went out into\r\nthe sun to drop potatoes.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he reached the barn than this singing ceased. But how was\r\nMr. Ware to know that?\r\n\r\nTwice Cynthia, during the week that followed, got halfway down the\r\nslope of the parsonage hill, the book under her arm, on her way to the\r\ntannery; twice went back, tears of humiliation and self-pity in her eyes\r\nat the thought that she should make advances to a man, and that man\r\nthe tanner's son. Her household work done, a longing for further motion\r\nseized her, and she walked out under the maples of the village street.\r\nLet it be understood that Coniston was a village, by courtesy, and its\r\nshaded road a street. Suddenly, there was the tannery, Jethro standing\r\nin front of it, contemplative. Did he see her? Would he come to her?\r\nCynthia, seized by a panic of shame, flew into Aunt Lucy Prescott's, sat\r\nthrough half an hour of torture while Aunt Lucy talked of redemption of\r\nsinners, during ten minutes of which Jethro stood, still contemplative.\r\nWhat tumult was in his breast, or whether there was any tumult, Cynthia\r\nknew not. He went into the tannery again, and though she saw him twice\r\nlater in the week, he gave no sign of seeing her.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday Cynthia bought a new bonnet in Brampton; Sunday morning put\r\nit on, suddenly remembered that one went to church to honor God, and\r\nwore her old one; walked to meeting in a flutter of expectancy not to be\r\ndenied, and would have looked around had that not been a cardinal sin\r\nin Coniston. No Jethro! General opinion (had she waited to hear it among\r\nthe horse sheds or on the green), that Jethro's soul had slid back into\r\nthe murky regions, from which it were folly for even Cynthia to try to\r\ndrag it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTo prove that Jethro's soul had not slid back into the murky regions,\r\nand that it was still indulging in flights, it is necessary to follow\r\nhim (for a very short space) to Boston. Jethro himself went in Lyman\r\nHull's six-horse team with a load of his own merchandise--hides that he\r\nhad tanned, and other country produce. And they did not go by the way of\r\nTruro Pass to the Capital, but took the state turnpike over the ranges,\r\nwhere you can see for miles and miles and miles on a clear summer\r\nday across the trembling floors of the forest tops to lonely sentinel\r\nmountains fourscore miles away.\r\n\r\nNo one takes the state turnpike nowadays except crazy tourists who\r\nare willing to risk their necks and their horses' legs for the sake of\r\nscenery. The tough little Morgans of that time, which kept their feet\r\nlike cats, have all but disappeared, but there were places on that road\r\nwhere Lyman Hull put the shoes under his wheels for four miles at a\r\nstretch. He was not a companion many people would have chosen with whom\r\nto enjoy the beauties of such a trip, and nearly everybody in Coniston\r\nwas afraid of him. Jethro Bass would sit silent on the seat for hours\r\nand--it is a fact to be noted that when he told Lyman to do a thing,\r\nLyman did it; not, perhaps, without cursing and grumbling. Lyman was a\r\nprofane and wicked man--drover, farmer, trader, anything. He had a cider\r\nmill on his farm on the south slopes of Coniston which Mr. Ware had\r\nmentioned in his sermons, and which was the resort of the ungodly. The\r\ncider was not so good as Squire Northcutt's, but cheaper. Jethro was not\r\nafraid of Lyman, and he had a mortgage on the six-horse team, and on the\r\nfarm and the cider mill.\r\n\r\nAfter six days, Jethro and Lyman drove over Charlestown bridge and\r\ninto the crooked streets of Boston, and at length arrived at a drover's\r\nhotel, or lodging-house that did not, we may be sure, front on Mount\r\nVernon Street or face the Mall. Lyman proceeded to get drunk, and Jethro\r\nto sell the hides and other merchandise which Lyman had hauled for him.\r\n\r\nThere was a young man in Boston, when Jethro arrived in Lyman Hull's\r\nteam, named William Wetherell. By extraordinary circumstances he and\r\nanother connected with him are to take no small part in this story,\r\nwhich is a sufficient excuse for his introduction. His father had been\r\na prosperous Portsmouth merchant in the West India trade, a man of many\r\nattainments, who had failed and died of a broken heart; and William, at\r\ntwo and twenty, was a clerk in the little jewellery shop of Mr. Judson\r\nin Cornhill.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell had literary aspirations, and sat from morning till\r\nnight behind the counter, reading and dreaming: dreaming that he was to\r\nbe an Irving or a Walter Scott, and yet the sum total of his works in\r\nafter years consisted of some letters to the Newcastle Guardian, and a\r\nbeginning of the Town History of Coniston!\r\n\r\nWilliam had a contempt for the awkward young countryman who suddenly\r\nloomed up before him that summer's morning across the counter. But a\r\nmoment before the clerk had been in a place where he would fain have\r\nlingered--a city where blue waters flow swiftly between white palaces\r\ntoward the sunrise.\r\n\r\n     “And I have fitted up some chambers there\r\n     Looking toward the golden Eastern air,\r\n     And level with the living winds, which flow\r\n     Like waves above the living waves below.”\r\n\r\nLittle did William Wetherell guess, when he glanced up at the intruder,\r\nthat he was looking upon one of the forces of his own life! The\r\ncountryman wore a blue swallow tail coat (fashioned by the hand of\r\nSpeedy Bates), a neck-cloth, a coonskin cap, and his trousers were\r\ntucked into rawhide boots. He did not seem a promising customer for\r\nexpensive jewellery, and the literary clerk did not rise, but merely\r\nclosed his book with his thumb in it.\r\n\r\n“S-sell things here,” asked the countryman, “s-sell things here?”\r\n\r\n“Occasionally, when folks have money to buy them.”\r\n\r\n“My name's Jethro Bass,” said the countryman, “Jethro Bass from\r\nConiston. Ever hear of Coniston?”\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Wetherell never had, but many years afterward he remembered\r\nhis name, heaven knows why. Jethro Bass! Perhaps it had a strange ring\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n“F-folks told me to be careful,” was Jethro's next remark. He did not\r\nlook at the clerk, but kept his eyes fixed on the things within the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n“Somebody ought to have come with you,” said the clerk, with a smile of\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\n“D-don't know much about city ways.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the clerk, beginning to be amused, “a man has to keep his\r\nwits about him.”\r\n\r\nEven then Jethro spared him a look, but continued to study the contents\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Bass? We have some really good things here.\r\nFor example, this Swiss watch, which I will sell you cheap, for one\r\nhundred and fifty dollars.”\r\n\r\n“One hundred and fifty dollars--er--one hundred and fifty?”\r\n\r\nWetherell nodded. Still the countryman did not look up.\r\n\r\n“F-folks told me to be careful,” he repeated without a smile. He was\r\nlooking at the lockets, and finally pointed a large finger at one of\r\nthem--the most expensive, by the way. “W-what d'ye get for that?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Twenty dollars,” the clerk promptly replied. Thirty was nearer the\r\nprice, but what did it matter.\r\n\r\n“H-how much for that?” he said, pointing to another. The clerk told him.\r\nHe inquired about them all, deliberately repeating the sums, considering\r\nwith so well-feigned an air of a purchaser that Mr. Wetherell began to\r\ntake a real joy in the situation. For trade was slack in August, and\r\ndiversion scarce. Finally he commanded that the case be put on the top\r\nof the counter, and Wetherell humored him. Whereupon he picked up the\r\nlocket he had first chosen. It looked very delicate in his huge, rough\r\nhand, and Wetherell was surprised that the eyes of Mr. Bass had been\r\ncaught by the most expensive, for it was far from being the showiest.\r\n\r\n“T-twenty dollars?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“We may as well call it that,” laughed Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“It's not too good for Cynthy,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Nothing's too good for Cynthy,” answered Mr. Wetherell, mockingly,\r\nlittle knowing how he might come to mean it.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass paid no attention to this speech. Pulling a great cowhide\r\nwallet from his pocket, still holding the locket in his hand, to the\r\namazement of the clerk he counted out twenty dollars and laid them down.\r\n\r\n“G-guess I'll take that one, g-guess I'll take that one,” he said.\r\n\r\nThen he looked at Mr. Wetherell for the first time.\r\n\r\n“Hold!” cried the clerk, more alarmed than he cared to show, “that's not\r\nthe price. Did you think I could sell it for that price?”\r\n\r\n“W-wahn't that the price you fixed?”\r\n\r\n“You simpleton!” retorted Wetherell, with a conviction now that he was\r\ncalling him the wrong name. “Give me back the locket, and you shall have\r\nyour money, again.”\r\n\r\n“W-wahn't that the price you fixed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but--”\r\n\r\n“G-guess I'll keep the locket--g-guess I'll keep the locket.”\r\n\r\nWetherell looked at him aghast, and there was no doubt about his\r\ndetermination. With a sinking heart the clerk realized that he should\r\nhave to make good to Mr. Judson the seven odd dollars of difference,\r\nand then he lost his head. Slipping round the counter to the door of\r\nthe shop, he turned the key, thrust it in his pocket, and faced Mr. Bass\r\nagain--from behind the counter.\r\n\r\n“You don't leave this shop,” cried the clerk, “until you give me back\r\nthat locket.”\r\n\r\nJethro Bass turned. A bench ran along the farther wall, and there he\r\nplanted himself without a word, while the clerk stared at him,--with\r\nwhat feelings of uneasiness I shall not attempt to describe,--for the\r\ncustomer was plainly determined to wait until hunger should drive one\r\nof them forth. The minutes passed, and Wetherell began to hate him. Then\r\nsome one tried the door, peered in through the glass, perceived Jethro,\r\nshook the knob, knocked violently, all to no purpose. Jethro seemed lost\r\nin a reverie.\r\n\r\n“This has gone far enough,” said the clerk, trying to keep his voice\r\nfrom shaking “it is beyond a joke. Give me back the locket.” And he\r\ntendered Jethro the money again.\r\n\r\n“W-wahn't that the price you fixed?” asked Jethro, innocently.\r\n\r\nWetherell choked. The man outside shook the door again, and people on\r\nthe sidewalk stopped, and presently against the window panes a sea of\r\ncurious faces gazed in upon them. Mr. Bass's thoughts apparently were\r\nfixed on Eternity--he looked neither at the people nor at Wetherell. And\r\nthen, the crowd parting as for one in authority, as in a bad dream\r\nthe clerk saw his employer, Mr. Judson, courteously pushing away the\r\ncustomer at the door who would not be denied. Another moment, and Mr.\r\nJudson had gained admittance with his private key, and stood on the\r\nthreshold staring at clerk and customer. Jethro gave no sign that the\r\nsituation had changed.\r\n\r\n“William,” said Mr. Judson, in a dangerously quiet voice, “perhaps you\r\ncan explain this extraordinary state of affairs.”\r\n\r\n“I can, sir,” William cried. “This gentleman” (the word stuck in his\r\nthroat), “this gentleman came in here to examine lockets which I had\r\nno reason to believe he would buy. I admit my fault, sir. He asked the\r\nprice of the most expensive, and I told him twenty dollars, merely for a\r\njest, sir.” William hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Mr. Judson.\r\n\r\n“After pricing every locket in the case, he seized the first one, handed\r\nme twenty dollars, and now refuses to give it up, although he knows the\r\nprice is twenty-seven.”\r\n\r\n“Then?”\r\n\r\n“Then I locked the door, sir. He sat down there, and hasn't moved\r\nsince.”\r\n\r\nMr. Judson looked again at Mr. Bass; this time with unmistakable\r\ninterest. The other customer began to laugh, and the crowd was pressing\r\nin, and Mr. Judson turned and shut the door in their faces. All this\r\ntime Mr. Bass had not moved, not so much as to lift his head or shift\r\none of his great cowhide boots.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” demanded Mr. Judson, “what have you to say?”\r\n\r\n“N-nothin'. G-guess I'll keep the locket. I've, paid for it--I've paid\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“And you are aware, my friend,” said Mr. Judson, “that my clerk has\r\ngiven you the wrong price?”\r\n\r\n“Guess that's his lookout.” He still sat there, doggedly unconcerned.\r\n\r\nA bull would have seemed more at home in a china shop than Jethro\r\nBass in a jewellery store. But Mr. Judson himself was a man out of the\r\nordinary, and instead of getting angry he began to be more interested.\r\n\r\n“Took you for a greenhorn, did he?” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“F-folks told me to be careful--to be careful,” said Mr. Bass.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Judson laughed. It was all the more disconcerting to William\r\nWetherell, because his employer laughed rarely. He laid his hand on\r\nJethro's shoulder.\r\n\r\n“He might have spared himself the trouble, my young friend,” he said.\r\n“You didn't expect to find a greenhorn behind a jewellery counter, did\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“S-surprised me some,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Judson laughed again, all the while looking at him.\r\n\r\n“I am going to let you keep the locket,” he said, “because it will teach\r\nmy greenhorn a lesson. William, do you hear that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” William said, and his face was very red.\r\n\r\nMr. Bass rose solemnly, apparently unmoved by his triumph in a somewhat\r\nremarkable transaction, and William long remembered how he towered over\r\nall of them. He held the locket out to Mr. Judson, who stared at it,\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n“What's this?” said that gentleman; “you don't want it?”\r\n\r\n“Guess I'll have it marked,” said Jethro, “ef it don't cost extry.”\r\n\r\n“Marked!” gasped Mr. Judson, “marked!”\r\n\r\n“Ef it don't cost extry,” Jethro repeated.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll--” exclaimed Mr. Judson, and suddenly recalled the fact that\r\nhe was a church member. “What inscription do you wish put into it?” he\r\nasked, recovering himself with an effort.\r\n\r\nJethro thrust his hand into his pocket, and again the cowhide wallet\r\ncame out. He tendered Mr. Judson a somewhat soiled piece of paper, and\r\nMr. Judson read:--\r\n\r\n        “Cynthy, from Jethro”\r\n\r\n“Cynthy,” Mr. Judson repeated, in a tremulous voice, “Cynthy, not\r\nCynthia.”\r\n\r\n“H-how is it written,” said Jethro, leaning over it, “h-how is it\r\nwritten?”\r\n\r\n“Cynthy,” answered Mr. Judson, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“Then make it Cynthy--make it Cynthy.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthy it shall be,” said Mr. Judson, with conviction.\r\n\r\n“When'll you have it done?”\r\n\r\n“To-night,” replied Mr. Judson, with a twinkle in his eye, “to-night, as\r\na special favor.”\r\n\r\n“What time--w-what time?”\r\n\r\n“Seven o'clock, sir. May I send it to your hotel? The Tremont House, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\n“I-I'll call,” said Jethro, so solemnly that Mr. Judson kept his\r\nlaughter until he was gone.\r\n\r\nFrom the door they watched him silently as he strode across the street\r\nand turned the corner. Then Mr. Judson turned. “That man will make his\r\nmark, William,” he said; and added thoughtfully, “but whether for good\r\nor evil, I know not.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWhat Cynthia may have thought or felt during Jethro's absence in Boston,\r\nand for some months thereafter, she kept to herself. Honest Moses Hatch\r\npursued his courting untroubled, and never knew that he had a rival.\r\nMoses would as soon have questioned the seasons or the weather as\r\nCynthia's changes of moods,--which were indeed the weather for him, and\r\nwhen storms came he sat with his back to them, waiting for the sunshine.\r\nHe had long ceased proposing marriage, in the firm belief that Cynthia\r\nwould set the day in her own good time. Thereby he was saved much\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nThe summer flew on apace, for Coniston. Fragrant hay was cut on\r\nhillsides won from rock and forest, and Coniston Water sang a gentler\r\nmelody--save when the clouds floated among the spruces on the mountain\r\nand the rain beat on the shingles. During the still days before the turn\r\nof the year,--days of bending fruit boughs, crab-apples glistening red\r\nin the soft sunlight,--rumor came from Brampton to wrinkle the forehead\r\nof Moses Hatch as he worked among his father's orchards.\r\n\r\nThe rumor was of a Mr. Isaac Dudley Worthington, a name destined to\r\nmake much rumor before it was to be carved on the marble. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington, indeed, might by a stretch of the imagination be called the\r\npioneer of all the genus to be known in the future as City Folks, who\r\nwere, two generations later, to invade the country like a devouring army\r\nof locusts.\r\n\r\nAt that time a stranger in Brampton was enough to set the town agog.\r\nBut a young man of three and twenty, with an independent income of four\r\nhundred dollars a year!--or any income at all not derived from his own\r\nlabor--was unheard of. It is said that when the stage from over Truro\r\nGap arrived in Brampton Street a hundred eyes gazed at him unseen, from\r\nvarious ambushes, and followed him up the walk to Silas Wheelock's,\r\nwhere he was to board. In half an hour Brampton knew the essentials\r\nof Isaac Worthington's story, and Sam Price was on his way with it to\r\nConiston for distribution at Jonah Winch's store.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington was from Boston--no less; slim, pale, medium\r\nheight, but with an alert look, and a high-bridged nose. But his\r\nclothes! Sam Price's vocabulary was insufficient here, they were cut\r\nin such a way, and Mr. Worthington was downright distinguished-looking\r\nunder his gray beaver. Why had he come to Brampton? demanded Deacon\r\nIra Perkins. Sam had saved this for the last. Young Mr. Worthington was\r\nthreatened with consumption, and had been sent to live with his distant\r\nrelative, Silas Wheelock.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a gentleman of leisure--although threatened with\r\nconsumption--became an all-absorbing topic in two villages and three\r\nhamlets, and more than one swain, hitherto successful, felt the wind\r\nblow colder. But in a fortnight it was known that a petticoat did not\r\nmake Isaac Worthington even turn his head. Curiosity centred on Silas\r\nWheelock's barn, where Mr. Worthington had fitted up a shop, and,\r\npresently various strange models of contrivances began to take shape\r\nthere. What these were, Silas himself knew not; and the gentleman of\r\nleisure was, alas! close-mouthed. When he was not sawing and hammering\r\nand planing, he took long walks up and down Coniston Water, and was\r\nsurprised deep in thought at several places.\r\n\r\nNathan Bass's story-and-a-half house, devoid of paint, faced the road,\r\nand behind it was the shed, or barn, that served as the tannery, and\r\nbetween the tannery and Coniston Water were the vats. The rain flew in\r\nsilvery spray, and the drops shone like jewels on the coat of a young\r\nman who stood looking in at the tannery door. Young Jake Wheeler, son of\r\nthe village spendthrift, was driving a lean white horse round in a ring:\r\nto the horse was attached a beam, and on the beam a huge round stone\r\nrolled on a circular oak platform. Jethro Bass, who was engaged in\r\npushing hemlock bark under the stone to be crushed, straightened. Of the\r\nthree, the horse had seen the visitor first, and stopped in his tracks.\r\n\r\n“Jethro!” whispered Jake, tingling with an excitement that was but\r\nnatural. Jethro had begun to sweep the finer pieces of bark toward the\r\ncentre. “It's the city man, walked up here from Brampton.”\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Mr. Worthington, slightly more sunburned and less\r\ncitified-looking than on his arrival, and he wore a woollen cap of\r\nBrampton make. Even then, despite his wavy hair and delicate appearance,\r\nIsaac Worthington had the hawk-like look which became famous in later\r\nyears, and at length he approached Jethro and fixed his eye upon him.\r\n\r\n“Kind of slow work, isn't it?” remarked Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\nThe white horse was the only one to break the silence that followed, by\r\nsneezing with all his might.\r\n\r\n“How is the tannery business in these parts?” essayed Mr. Worthington\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Thinkin' of it?” said Jethro. “T-thinkin' of it, be you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Mr. Worthington, hastily. “If I were,” he added, “I'd put\r\nin new machinery. That horse and stone is primitive.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of machinery would you put in?” asked Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” answered Worthington, “that will interest you. All New Englanders\r\nare naturally progressive, I take it.”\r\n\r\n“W-what was it you took?”\r\n\r\n“I was merely remarking on the enterprise of New Englanders,” said\r\nWorthington, flushing. “On my journey up here, beside the Merrimac, I\r\nhad the opportunity to inspect the new steam-boiler, the falling-mill,\r\nthe splitting machine, and other remarkable improvements. In fact, these\r\nsuggested one or two little things to me, which might be of interest to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jethro, “they might, and then again they mightn't. Guess it\r\ndepends.”\r\n\r\n“Depends!” exclaimed the man of leisure, “depends on what?”\r\n\r\n“H-how much you know about it.”\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington, instead of being justly indignant, laughed and\r\nsettled himself comfortably on a pile of bark. He thought Jethro a\r\ncharacter, and he was not mistaken. On the other hand, Mr. Worthington\r\ndisplayed a knowledge of the falling-mill and splitting-machine and the\r\nprocess of tanneries in general that was surprising. Jethro, had Mr.\r\nWorthington but known it, was more interested in animate machines: more\r\ninterested in Mr. Worthington than the falling-mill or, indeed, the\r\ntannery business.\r\n\r\nAt length the visitor fell silent, his sense of superiority suddenly\r\ngone. Others had had this same feeling with Jethro, even the minister;\r\nbut the man of leisure (who was nothing of the sort) merely felt a kind\r\nof bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“Callatin' to live in Brampton--be you?” asked Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I am living there now.”\r\n\r\n“C-callatin' to set up a mill some day?”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington fairly leaped off the bark pile.\r\n\r\n“What makes you say that?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“G-guesswork,” said Jethro, starting to shovel again, “g-guesswork.”\r\n\r\nTo take a walk in the wild, to come upon a bumpkin in cowhide boots\r\ncrushing bark, to have him read within twenty minutes a cherished and\r\nwell-hidden ambition which Brampton had not discovered in a month (and\r\ndid not discover for many years) was sufficiently startling. Well might\r\nMr. Worthington tremble for his other ambitions, and they were many.\r\n\r\nJethro stepped out, passing Mr. Worthington as though he had already\r\nforgotten that gentleman's existence, and seized an armful of bark that\r\nlay under cover of a lean-to. Just then, heralded by a brightening of\r\nthe western sky, a girl appeared down the road, her head bent a little\r\nas in thought, and if she saw the group by the tannery house she gave\r\nno sign. Two of them stared at her--Jake Wheeler and Mr. Worthington.\r\nSuddenly Jake, implike, turned and stared at Worthington.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy Ware, the minister's daughter,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Haven't I seen her in Brampton?” inquired Mr. Worthington, little\r\nthinking of the consequences of the question.\r\n\r\n“Guess you have,” answered Jake. “Cynthy goes to the Social Library, to\r\ngit books. She knows more'n the minister himself, a sight more.”\r\n\r\n“Where does the minister live?” asked Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\nJake pulled him by the sleeve toward the road, and pointed to the low\r\ngable of the little parsonage under the elms on the hill beyond the\r\nmeeting-house. The visitor gave a short glance at it, swung around and\r\ngave a longer glance at the figure disappearing in the other direction.\r\nHe did not suspect that Jake was what is now called a news agency. Then\r\nMr. Worthington turned to Jethro, who was stooping over the bark.\r\n\r\n“If you come to Brampton, call and see me,” he said. “You'll find me at\r\nSilas Wheelock's.”\r\n\r\nHe got no answer, but apparently expected none, and he started off down\r\nthe Brampton road in the direction Cynthia had taken.\r\n\r\n“That makes another,” said Jake, significantly, “and Speedy Bates says\r\nhe never looks at wimmen. Godfrey, I wish I could see Moses now.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington had not been quite ingenuous with Jake. To tell the\r\ntruth, he had made the acquaintance of the Social Library and Miss\r\nLucretia, and that lady had sung the praises of her favorite. Once out\r\nof sight of Jethro, Mr. Worthington quickened his steps, passed the\r\nstore, where he was remarked by two of Jonah's customers, and his blood\r\nleaped when he saw the girl in front of him, walking faster now. Yes,\r\nit is a fact that Isaac Worthington's blood once leaped. He kept on, but\r\nwhen near her had a spasm of fright to make his teeth fairly chatter,\r\nand than another spasm followed, for Cynthia had turned around.\r\n\r\n“How do you do Mr. Worthington?” she said, dropping him a little\r\ncourtesy. Mr. Worthington stopped in his tracks, and it was some time\r\nbefore he remembered to take off his woollen cap and sweep the mud with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“You know my name!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“It is known from Tarleton Four Corners to Harwich,” said Cynthia, “all\r\nthat distance. To tell the truth,” she added, “those are the boundaries\r\nof my world.” And Mr. Worthington being still silent, “How do you like\r\nbeing a big frog in a little pond?”\r\n\r\n“If it were your pond, Miss Cynthia,” he responded gallantly, “I should\r\nbe content to be a little frog.”\r\n\r\n“Would you?” she said; “I don't believe you.”\r\n\r\nThis was not subtle flattery, but the truth--Mr. Worthington would never\r\nbe content to be a little anything. So he had been judged twice in an\r\nafternoon, once by Jethro and again by Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you believe me?” he asked ecstatically.\r\n\r\n“A woman's instinct, Mr. Worthington, has very little reason in it.”\r\n\r\n“I hear, Miss Cynthia,” he said gallantly, “that your instinct is\r\nfortified by learning, since Miss Penniman tells me that you are quite\r\ncapable of taking a school in Boston.”\r\n\r\n“Then I should be doubly sure of your character,” she retorted with a\r\ntwinkle.\r\n\r\n“Will you tell my fortune?” he said gayly.\r\n\r\n“Not on such a slight acquaintance,” she replied. “Good-by, Mr.\r\nWorthington.”\r\n\r\n“I shall see you in Brampton,” he cried, “I--I have seen you in\r\nBrampton.”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer this confession, but left him, and presently\r\ndisappeared beyond the triangle of the green, while Mr. Worthington\r\npursued his way to Brampton by the road,--his thoughts that evening not\r\non waterfalls or machinery. As for Cynthia's conduct, I do not defend or\r\nexplain it, for I have found out that the best and wisest of women can\r\nat times be coquettish.\r\n\r\nIt was that meeting which shook the serenity of poor Moses, and he\r\nlearned of it when he went to Jonah Winch's store an hour later. An\r\nhour later, indeed, Coniston was discussing the man of leisure in a\r\nnew light. It was possible that Cynthia might take him, and Deacon Ira\r\nPerkins made a note the next time he went to Brampton to question Silas\r\nWheelock on Mr. Worthington's origin, habits, and orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nCynthia troubled herself very little about any of these. Scarcely any\r\npurpose in the world is single, but she had had a purpose in talking\r\nto Mr. Worthington, besides the pleasure it gave her. And the next\r\nSaturday, when she rode off to Brampton, some one looked through the\r\ncracks in the tannery shed and saw that she wore her new bonnet.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a pleasanter place in the world than Brampton Street\r\non a summer's day. Down the length of it runs a wide green, shaded by\r\nspreading trees, and on either side, tree-shaded, too, and each in its\r\nown little plot, gabled houses of that simple, graceful architecture of\r\nour forefathers. Some of these had fluted pilasters and cornices, the\r\nenvy of many a modern architect, and fan-shaped windows in dormer and\r\ndoorway. And there was the church, then new, that still stands to the\r\nglory of its builders; with terraced steeple and pillared porch and the\r\nwidest of checker-paned sashes to let in the light on high-backed pews\r\nand gallery.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Social Library, halfway up the street, occupied part of\r\nMiss Lucretia's little house; or, it might better be said, Miss Lucretia\r\nboarded with the Social Library. There Cynthia hitched her horse, gave\r\ngreeting to Mr. Ezra Graves and others who paused, and, before she was\r\nfairly in the door, was clasped in Miss Lucretia's arms. There were new\r\nbooks to be discussed, arrived by the stage the day before; but scarce\r\nhalf an hour had passed before Cynthia started guiltily at a timid\r\nknock, and Miss Lucretia rose briskly.\r\n\r\n“It must be Ezra Graves come for the Gibbon,” she said. “He's early.”\r\n And she went to the door. Cynthia thought it was not Ezra. Then came\r\nMiss Lucretia's voice from the entry:--\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Worthington! Have you read the Last of the Mohicans already?”\r\n\r\nThere he stood, indeed, the man of leisure, and to-day he wore his\r\nbeaver hat. No, he had not yet read the 'Last of the Mohicans.' There\r\nwere things in it that Mr. Worthington would like to discuss with Miss\r\nPenniman. Was it not a social library? At this juncture there came a\r\ngiggle from within that made him turn scarlet, and he scarcely heard\r\nMiss Lucretia offering to discuss the whole range of letters. Enter Mr.\r\nWorthington, bows profoundly to Miss Lucretia's guest, his beaver in his\r\nhand, and the discussion begins, Cynthia taking no part in it. Strangely\r\nenough, Mr. Worthington's remarks on American Indians are not only\r\nintelligent, but interesting. The clock strikes four, Miss Lucretia\r\nstarts up, suddenly remembering that she has promised to read to an\r\ninvalid, and with many regrets from Mr. Worthington, she departs. Then\r\nhe sits down again, twirling his beaver, while Cynthia looks at him in\r\nquiet amusement.\r\n\r\n“I shall walk to Coniston again, next week,” he announced.\r\n\r\n“What an energetic man!” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“I want to have my fortune told.”\r\n\r\n“I hear that you walk a great deal,” she remarked, “up and down Coniston\r\nWater. I shall begin to think you romantic, Mr. Worthington--perhaps a\r\npoet.”\r\n\r\n“I don't walk up and down Coniston Water for that reason,” he answered\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n“Might I be so bold as to ask the reason?” she ventured.\r\n\r\nGreat men have their weaknesses. And many, close-mouthed with their own\r\nsex, will tell their cherished hopes to a woman, if their interests\r\nare engaged. With a bas-relief of Isaac Worthington in the town library\r\nto-day (his own library), and a full-length portrait of him in the\r\ncapitol of the state, who shall deny this title to greatness?\r\n\r\nHe leaned a little toward her, his face illumined by his subject, which\r\nwas himself.\r\n\r\n“I will confide in you,” he said, “that some day I shall build here in\r\nBrampton a woollen mill which will be the best of its kind. If I gain\r\nmoney, it will not be to hoard it or to waste it. I shall try to make\r\nthe town better for it, and the state, and I shall try to elevate my\r\nneighbors.”\r\n\r\nCynthia could not deny that these were laudable ambitions.\r\n\r\n“Something tells me,” he continued, “that I shall succeed. And that is\r\nwhy I walk on Coniston Water--to choose the best site for a dam.”\r\n\r\n“I am honored by your secret, but I feel that the responsibility you\r\nrepose in me is too great,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I can think of none in whom I would rather confide,” said he.\r\n\r\n“And am I the only one in all Brampton, Harwich, and Coniston who knows\r\nthis?” she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington laughed.\r\n\r\n“The only one of importance,” he answered. “This week, when I went to\r\nConiston, I had a strange experience. I left the brook at a tannery, and\r\na most singular fellow was in the shed shovelling bark. I tried to get\r\nhim to talk, and told him about some new tanning machinery I had seen.\r\nSuddenly he turned on me and asked me if I was 'callatin' to set up a\r\nmill.' He gave me a queer feeling. Do you have many such odd characters\r\nin Coniston, Miss Cynthia? You're not going?”\r\n\r\nCynthia had risen, and all of the laugher was gone from her eyes. What\r\nhad happened to make her grow suddenly grave, Isaac Worthington never\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n“I have to get my father's supper,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe, too, rose, puzzled and disconcerted at this change in her.\r\n\r\n“And may I not come to Coniston?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“My father and I should be glad to see you, Mr. Worthington,” she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nHe untied her horse and essayed one more topic.\r\n\r\n“You are taking a very big book,” he said. “May I look at the title?”\r\n\r\nShe showed it to him in silence. It was the “Life of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington came to Coniston not once, but many times, before the\r\nsnow fell; and afterward, too, in Silas Wheelock's yellow sleigh through\r\nthe great drifts under the pines, the chestnut Morgan trotting to one\r\nside in the tracks. On one of these excursions he fell in with that\r\nsingular character of a bumpkin who had interested him on his first\r\nvisit, in coonskin cap and overcoat and mittens. Jethro Bass was\r\nplodding in the same direction, and Isaac Worthington, out of the\r\ngoodness of his heart, invited him into the sleigh. He was scarcely\r\nprepared for the bumpkin's curt refusal, but put it down to native\r\nboorishness, and thought no more about it then.\r\n\r\nWhat troubled Mr. Worthington infinitely more was the progress of his\r\nsuit; for it had become a snit, though progress is a wrong word to use\r\nin connection with it. So far had he got,--not a great distance,--and\r\nthen came to what he at length discovered was a wall, and apparently\r\nimpenetrable. He was not even allowed to look over it. Cynthia was kind,\r\nengaging; even mirthful, at times, save when he approached it; and he\r\nbecame convinced that a certain sorrow lay in the forbidden ground. The\r\nnearest he had come to it was when he mentioned again, by accident, that\r\nlife of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThat Cynthia would accept him, nobody doubted for an instant. It would\r\nbe madness not to. He was orthodox, so Deacon Ira had discovered, of\r\ngood habits, and there was the princely four hundred a year--almost\r\na minister's salary! Little people guessed that there was no\r\nlove-making--only endless discussions of books beside the great centre\r\nchimney, and discussions of Isaac Worthington's career.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact--for future consideration--that Isaac Worthington proposed\r\nto Cynthia Ware, although neither Speedy Bates nor Deacon Ira Perkins\r\nheard him do so. It had been very carefully prepared, that speech,\r\nand was a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time. Mr.\r\nWorthington preferred to offer himself for what he was going to be--not\r\nfor what he was. He tendered to Cynthia a note for a large amount,\r\npayable in some twenty years, with interest. The astonishing thing to\r\nrecord is that in twenty years he could have more than paid the note,\r\nalthough he could not have foreseen at that time the Worthington Free\r\nLibrary and the Truro Railroad, and the stained-glass window in the\r\nchurch and the great marble monument on the hill--to another woman.\r\nAll of these things, and more, Cynthia might have had if she had only\r\naccepted that promise to pay! But she did not accept it. He was a trifle\r\nmore robust than when he came to Brampton in the summer, but perhaps she\r\ndoubted his promise to pay.\r\n\r\nIt may have been guessed, although the language we have used has been\r\npurposely delicate, that Cynthia was already in love with--somebody\r\nelse. Shame of shames and horror of horrors--with Jethro Bass! With\r\nStrength, in the crudest form in which it is created, perhaps, but yet\r\nwith Strength. The strength might gradually and eventually be refined.\r\nSuch was her hope, when she had any. It is hard, looking back upon that\r\nvirginal and cultured Cynthia, to be convinced that she could have loved\r\npassionately, and such a man! But love she did, and passionately, too,\r\nand hated herself for it, and prayed and struggled to cast out what she\r\nbelieved, at times, to be a devil.\r\n\r\nThe ancient allegory of Cupid and the arrows has never been improved\r\nupon: of Cupid, who should never in the world have been trusted with a\r\nweapon, who defies all game laws, who shoots people in the bushes and\r\ninnocent bystanders generally, the weak and the helpless and the strong\r\nand self-confident! There is no more reason in it than that. He shot\r\nCynthia Ware, and what she suffered in secret Coniston never guessed.\r\nWhat parallels in history shall I quote to bring home the enormity of\r\nsuch a mesalliance? Orthodox Coniston would have gone into sackcloth and\r\nashes,--was soon to go into these, anyway.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to keep the lovers apart for any mere purposes of\r\nfiction,--this is a true chronicle, and they stayed apart most of\r\nthat winter. Jethro went about his daily tasks, which were now become\r\nmanifold, and he wore the locket on its little chain himself. He did not\r\nthink that Cynthia loved him--yet, but he had the effrontery to believe\r\nthat she might, some day; and he was content to wait. He saw that she\r\navoided him, and he was too proud to go to the parsonage and so incur\r\nridicule and contempt.\r\n\r\nJethro was content to wait. That is a clew to his character throughout\r\nhis life. He would wait for his love, he would wait for his hate: he had\r\nwaited ten years before putting into practice the first step of a little\r\nscheme which he had been gradually developing during that time, for\r\nwhich he had been amassing money, and the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, by\r\nthe way, had given him some valuable ideas. Jethro, as well as Isaac\r\nD. Worthington, had ambitions, although no one in Coniston had hitherto\r\nguessed them except Jock Hallowell--and Cynthia Ware, after her\r\ncuriosity had been aroused.\r\n\r\nEven as Isaac D. Worthington did not dream of the Truro Railroad and of\r\nan era in the haze of futurity, it did not occur to Jethro Bass that his\r\nambitions tended to the making of another era that was at hand. Makers\r\nof eras are too busy thinking about themselves and like immediate\r\nmatters to worry about history. Jethro never heard the expression\r\nabout “cracks in the Constitution,” and would not have known what it\r\nmeant,--he merely had the desire to get on top. But with Established\r\nChurch Coniston tight in the saddle (in the person of Moses Hatch,\r\nSenior), how was he to do it?\r\n\r\nAs the winter wore on, and March town meeting approached, strange rumors\r\nof a Democratic ticket began to drift into Jonah Winch's store,--a\r\nDemocratic ticket headed by Fletcher Bartlett, of all men, as chairman\r\nof the board. Moses laughed when he first heard of it, for Fletcher was\r\nan easy-going farmer of the Methodist persuasion who was always in debt,\r\nand the other members of the ticket, so far as Moses could learn of\r\nit--were remarkable neither for orthodoxy or solidity. The rumors\r\npersisted, and still Moses laughed, for the senior selectman was a big\r\nman with flesh on him, who could laugh with dignity.\r\n\r\n“Moses,” said Deacon Lysander Richardson as they stood on the platform\r\nof the store one sunny Saturday in February, “somebody's put Fletcher\r\nup to this. He hain't got sense enough to act that independent all by\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n“You be always croakin', Lysander,” answered Moses.\r\n\r\nCynthia Ware, who had come to the store for buttons for Speedy Bates,\r\nwho was making a new coat for the minister, heard these remarks, and\r\nstood thoughtfully staring at the blue coat-tails of the elders. A brass\r\nbutton was gone from Deacon Lysander's, and she wanted to sew it on.\r\nSuddenly she looked up, and saw Jock Hallowell standing beside her. Jock\r\nwinked--and Cynthia blushed and hurried homeward without a word. She\r\nremembered, vividly enough, what Jack had told her the spring before,\r\nand several times during the week that followed she thought of waylaying\r\nhim and asking what he knew. But she could not summon the courage. As a\r\nmatter of fact, Jock knew nothing, but he had a theory. He was a strange\r\nman, Jock, who whistled all day on roof and steeple and meddled with\r\nnobody's business, as a rule. What had impelled him to talk to Cynthia\r\nin the way he had must remain a mystery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the disquieting rumors continued to come in. Jabez Miller, on\r\nthe north slope, had told Samuel Todd, who told Ephraim Williams, that\r\nhe was going to vote for Fletcher. Moses Hatch hitched up his team and\r\nwent out to see Jabez, spent an hour in general conversation, and then\r\nplumped the question, taking, as he said, that means of finding out.\r\nJabez hemmed and hawed, said his farm was mortgaged; spoke at some\r\nlength about the American citizen, however humble, having a right to\r\nvote as he chose. A most unusual line for Jabez, and the whole matter\r\nvery mysterious and not a little ominous. Moses drove homeward that\r\nsparkling day, shutting his eyes to the glare of the ice crystals on\r\nthe pines, and thinking profoundly. He made other excursions, enough to\r\nsatisfy himself that this disease, so new and unheard of (the right of\r\nthe unfit to hold office), actually existed. Where the germ began that\r\ncaused it, Moses knew no better than the deacon, since those who were\r\nsuspected of leanings toward Fletcher Bartlett were strangely secretive.\r\nThe practical result of Moses' profound thought was a meeting, in his\r\nown house, without respect to party, Democrats and Whigs alike, opened\r\nby a prayer from the minister himself. The meeting, after a futile\r\nsession, broke up dismally. Sedition and conspiracy existed; a chief\r\noffender and master mind there was, somewhere. But who was he?\r\n\r\nGood Mr. Ware went home, troubled in spirit, shaking his head. He had a\r\ncold, and was not so strong as he used to be, and should not have gone\r\nto the meeting at all. At supper, Cynthia listened with her eyes on her\r\nplate while he told her of the affair.\r\n\r\n“Somebody's behind this, Cynthia,” he said. “It's the most astonishing\r\nthing in my experience that we cannot discover who has incited them. All\r\nthe unattached people in the town seem to have been organized.” Mr.\r\nWare was wont to speak with moderation even at his own table. He said\r\nunattached--not ungodly.\r\n\r\nCynthia kept her eyes on her plate, but she felt as though her body\r\nwere afire. Little did the minister imagine, as he went off to write his\r\nsermon, that his daughter might have given him the clew to the mystery.\r\nYes, Cynthia guessed; and she could not read that evening because of\r\nthe tumult of her thoughts. What was her duty in the matter? To tell\r\nher father her suspicions? They were only suspicions, after all, and she\r\ncould make no accusations. And Jethro! Although she condemned him, there\r\nwas something in the situation that appealed to a most reprehensible\r\nsense of humor. Cynthia caught herself smiling once or twice, and knew\r\nthat it was wicked. She excused Jethro, and told herself that, with his\r\nlack of training, he could know no better. Then an idea came to her, and\r\nthe very boldness of it made her grow hot again. She would appeal to him\r\ntell him that that power he had over other men could be put to better\r\nand finer uses. She would appeal to him, and he would abandon the\r\nmatter. That the man loved her with the whole of his rude strength she\r\nwas sure, and that knowledge had been the only salve to her shame.\r\n\r\nSo far we have only suspicions ourselves; and, strange to relate, if we\r\ngo around Coniston with Jethro behind his little red Morgan, we shall\r\ncome back with nothing but--suspicions. They will amount to convictions,\r\nyet we cannot prove them. The reader very naturally demands some\r\nspecific information--how did Jethro do it? I confess that I can only\r\nindicate in a very general way: I can prove nothing. Nobody ever could\r\nprove anything against Jethro Bass. Bring the following evidence before\r\nany grand jury in the country, and see if they don't throw it out of\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nJethro in the course of his weekly round of strictly business visits\r\nthroughout the town, drives into Samuel Todd's farmyard, and hitches\r\non the sunny side of the red barns. The town of Coniston, it must be\r\nexplained for the benefit of those who do not understand the word “town”\r\n in the New England senses was a tract of country about ten miles by ten,\r\nthe most thickly settled portion of which was the village of Coniston,\r\nconsisting of twelve houses. Jethro drives into the barnyard, and Samuel\r\nTodd comes out. He is a little man, and has a habit of rubbing the sharp\r\nridge of his nose.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Jethro?” says Samuel. “Killed the brindle Thursday. Finest\r\nhide you ever seed.”\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to town meetin' Tuesday--g-goin' to town meetin'\r\nTuesday--Sam'l?” says Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I was callatin' to, Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“Democrat--hain't ye--Democrat?”\r\n\r\n“Callate to be.”\r\n\r\n“How much store do ye set by that hide?”\r\n\r\nSamuel rubs his nose. Then he names a price that the hide might fetch,\r\nunder favorable circumstances, in Boston--Jethro does not wince.\r\n\r\n“Who d'ye callate to vote for, Sam'l?”\r\n\r\nSamuel rubs his nose.\r\n\r\n“Heerd they was a-goin' to put up Fletcher and Amos Cuthbert, an'\r\nSam Price for Moderator.” (What a convenient word is they when used\r\npolitically!) “Hain't made up my mind, clear,” says Samuel.\r\n\r\n“C-comin' by the tannery after town meetin'?” inquired Jethro, casually.\r\n\r\n“Don't know but what I kin.”\r\n\r\n“F-fetch the hide--f-fetch the hide.”\r\n\r\nAnd Jethro drives off, with Samuel looking after him, rubbing his nose.\r\n“No bill,” says the jury--if you can get Samuel into court. But you\r\ncan't. Even Moses Hatch can get nothing out of Samuel, who then talks\r\nJacksonian principles and the nights of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nLet us pursue this matter a little farther, and form a committee of\r\ninvestigation. Where did Mr. Todd learn anything about Jacksonian\r\nprinciples? From Mr. Samuel Price, whom they have spoken of for\r\nModerator. And where did Mr. Price learn of these principles? Any one in\r\nConiston will tell you that Mr. Price makes a specialty of orators and\r\noratory; and will hold forth at the drop of a hat in Jonah Winch's store\r\nor anywhere else. Who is Mr. Price? He is a tall, sallow young man of\r\neight and twenty, with a wedge-shaped face, a bachelor and a Methodist,\r\nwho farms in a small way on the southern slope, and saves his money. He\r\nhas become almost insupportable since they have named him for Moderator.\r\n\r\nGet Mr. Sam Price into court. Here is a man who assuredly knows who they\r\nare: if we are, not much mistaken, he is their mouthpiece. Get, an eel\r\ninto court. There is only one man in town who can hold an eel, and he\r\nisn't on the jury. Mr. Price will talk plentifully, in his nasal way;\r\nbut he won't tell you anything.\r\n\r\nMr. Price has been nominated to fill Deacon Lysander Richardson's shoes\r\nin the following manner: One day in the late autumn a man in a coonskin\r\ncap stops beside Mr. Price's woodpile, where Mr. Price has been chopping\r\nwood, pausing occasionally to stare off through the purple haze at the\r\nsouth shoulder of Coniston Mountain.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Jethro?” says Mr. Price, nasally.\r\n\r\n“D-Democrats are talkin' some of namin' you Moderator next meetin',”\r\n says the man in the coonskin cap.\r\n\r\n“Want to know!” ejaculates Mr. Price, dropping the axe and straightening\r\nup in amazement. For Mr. Price's ambition soared no higher, and he had\r\nmade no secret of it. “Wal! Whar'd you hear that, Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“H-heerd it round--some. D-Democrat--hain't you--Democrat?”\r\n\r\n“Always callate to be.”\r\n\r\n“J-Jacksonian Democrat?”\r\n\r\n“Guess I be.”\r\n\r\nSilence for a while, that Mr. Price may feel the gavel in his hand,\r\nwhich he does.\r\n\r\n“Know somewhat about Jacksonian principles, don't ye--know somewhat?”\r\n\r\n“Callate to,” says Mr. Price, proudly.\r\n\r\n“T-talk 'em up, Sam--t-talk 'em up. C-canvass, Sam.”\r\n\r\nWith these words of brotherly advice Mr. Bass went off down the road,\r\nand Mr. Price chopped no more wood that night; but repeated to himself\r\nmany times in his nasal voice, “I want to know!” In the course of the\r\nnext few weeks various gentlemen mentioned to Mr. Price that he had been\r\nspoken of for Moderator, and he became acquainted with the names of\r\nthe other candidates on the same mysterious ticket who were mentioned.\r\nWhereupon he girded up his loins and went forth and preached the word of\r\nJacksonian Democracy in all the farmhouses roundabout, with such effect\r\nthat Samuel Todd and others were able to talk with some fluency about\r\nthe rights of American citizens.\r\n\r\nQuestion before the Committee, undisposed of: Who nominated Samuel Price\r\nfor Moderator? Samuel Price gives the evidence, tells the court he does\r\nnot know, and is duly cautioned and excused.\r\n\r\nLet us call, next, Mr. Eben Williams, if we can. Moses Hatch, Senior,\r\nhas already interrogated him with all the authority of the law and the\r\nchurch, for Mr. Williams is orthodox, though the deacons have to remind\r\nhim of his duty once in a while. Eben is timid, and replies to us, as\r\nto Moses, that he has heard of the Democratic ticket, and callates that\r\nFletcher Bartlett, who has always been the leader of the Democratic\r\nparty, has named the ticket. He did not mention Jethro Bass to Deacon\r\nHatch. Why should he? What has Jethro Bass got to do with politics?\r\n\r\nEben lives on a southern spur, next to Amos Cuthbert, where you can look\r\noff for forty miles across the billowy mountains of the west. From\r\nno spot in Coniston town is the sunset so fine on distant Farewell\r\nMountain, and Eben's sheep feed on pastures where only mountain-bred\r\nsheep can cling and thrive. Coniston, be it known, at this time is one\r\nof the famous wool towns of New England: before the industry went West,\r\nwith other industries. But Eben Williams's sheep do not wholly belong to\r\nhim they are mortgaged--and Eben's farm is mortgaged.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass--Eben testifies to us--is in the habit of visiting him once\r\na month, perhaps, when he goes to Amos Cuthbert's. Just friendly calls.\r\nIs it not a fact that Jethro Bass holds his mortgage? Yes, for eight\r\nhundred dollars. How long has he held that mortgage? About a year and a\r\nhalf. Has the interest been paid promptly? Well, the fact is that Eben\r\nhasn't paid any interest yet.\r\n\r\nNow let us take the concrete incident. Before that hypocritical thaw\r\nearly in February, Jethro called upon Amos Cuthbert--not so surly then\r\nas he has since become--and talked about buying his wool when it should\r\nbe duly cut, and permitted Amos to talk about the position of second\r\nselectman, for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had\r\nnominated him. On his way down to the Four Corners, Jethro had merely\r\npulled up his sleigh before Eben Williams's house, which stood behind a\r\nhuge snow bank and practically on the road. Eben appeared at the door, a\r\nlittle dishevelled in hair and beard, for he had been sleeping.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Jethro?” he said nervously. Jethro nodded.\r\n\r\n“Weather looks a mite soft.”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n“About that interest,” said Eben, plunging into the dread subject,\r\n“don't know as I'm ready this month after all.”\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to town meetin', Eben?”\r\n\r\n“Wahn't callatin' to,” answered Eben.\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to town meetin', Eben?”\r\n\r\nEben, puzzled and dismayed, ran his hand through his hair.\r\n\r\n“Wahn't callatin' to--but I kin--I kin.”\r\n\r\n“D-Democrat--hain't ye--D-Democrat?”\r\n\r\n“I kin be,” said Eben. Then he looked at Jethro and added in a startled\r\nvoice, “Don't know but what I be--Yes, I guess I be.”\r\n\r\n“H-heerd the ticket?”\r\n\r\nYes, Eben had heard the ticket. What man had not. Some one has been most\r\nindustrious, and most disinterested, in distributing that ticket.\r\n\r\n“Hain't a mite of hurry about the interest right now--right now,” said\r\nJethro. “M-may be along the third week in March--may be--c-can t tell.”\r\n\r\nAnd Jethro clucked to his horse, and drove away. Eben Williams went back\r\ninto his house and sat down with his head in his hands. In about two\r\nhours, when his wife called him to fetch water, he set down the pail\r\non the snow and stared across the next ridge at the eastern horizon,\r\nwhitening after the sunset.\r\n\r\nThe third week in March was the week after town meeting!\r\n\r\n“M-may be--c-can't tell,” repeated Eben to himself, unconsciously\r\nimitating Jethro's stutter. “Godfrey, I'll hev to git that ticket\r\nstraight from Amos.”\r\n\r\nYes, we may have our suspicions. But how can we get a bill on this\r\nevidence? There are some thirty other individuals in Coniston whose\r\nmortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm. It is not\r\nlikely that they will tell Beacon Hatch, or us; that they are going to\r\ntown meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because Jethro Bass\r\nwishes them to do so. And Jethro has never said that he wishes them\r\nto. If so, where are your witnesses? Have we not come back to our\r\nstarting-point, even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we\r\nhave the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not\r\nknow whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived\r\nunder his nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro\r\nBass had never taken any active part in politics, though some folks had\r\nheard, in his rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had\r\nspread the news of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was\r\nspoken of at the meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even\r\ndeclared that, being a Democrat, Jethro might have influenced some of\r\nthose under obligations to him. Sam Price was at last fixed upon as the\r\nmalefactor, though people agreed that they had not given him credit for\r\nso much sense, and Jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the\r\northodox as the spotted fever.\r\n\r\nWe can call a host of other witnesses if we like, among them cranky,\r\nhappy-go-lucky Fletcher Bartlett, who has led forlorn hopes in former\r\nyears. Court proceedings make tiresome reading, and if those who\r\nhave been over ours have not arrived at some notion of the simple and\r\ninnocent method of the new Era of politics note dawning--they never\r\nwill. Nothing proved. But here is part of the ticket which nobody\r\nstarted:--\r\n\r\n     For\r\n\r\n     SENIOR SELECTMAN, FLETCHER BARTLETT.\r\n\r\n     (Farm and buildings on Thousand Acre Hill mortgaged to Jethro\r\n     Bass.)\r\n\r\n     SECOND SELECTMAN, AMOS CUTHBERT.\r\n\r\n     (Farm and buildings on Town's End Ridge mortgaged to Jethro\r\n     Bass.)\r\n\r\n     THIRD SELECTMAN, CHESTER PERKINS.\r\n\r\n     (Sop of some kind to the Established Church party. Horse and\r\n     cow mortgaged to Jethro Bass, though his father, the tithing-man,\r\ndoesn't know it.)\r\n\r\n     MODERATOR, SAMUEL PRICE.\r\n\r\n     (Natural ambition--dove of oratory and Jacksonian principles.)\r\n\r\n     etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe notes are mine, not Moses's. Strange that they didn't occur to\r\nMoses. What a wealthy man has our hero become at thirty-one! Jethro Bass\r\nwas rich beyond the dreams of avarice--for Coniston. Truth compels me\r\nto admit that the sum total of all his mortgages did not amount to nine\r\nthousand “dollars”; but that was a large sum of money for Coniston in\r\nthose days, and even now. Nathan Bass had been a saving man, and had\r\nleft to his son one-half of this fortune. If thrift and the ability to\r\ngain wealth be qualities for a hero, Jethro had them--in those days.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday before March meeting, it blew bitter cold, and Priest Ware,\r\npreaching in mittens, denounced sedition in general. Underneath him,\r\non the first landing of the high pulpit, the deacons sat with knitted\r\nbrows, and the key-note from Isaiah Prescott's pitch pipe sounded like\r\nmournful echo of the mournful wind without.\r\n\r\nMonday was ushered in with that sleet storm to which the almanacs still\r\nrefer, and another scarcely less important event occurred that day which\r\nwe shall have to pass by for the present; on Tuesday, the sleet still\r\nraging, came the historic town meeting. Deacon Moses Hatch, his chores\r\ndone and his breakfast and prayers completed, fought his way with his\r\nhead down through a white waste to the meeting-house door, and unlocked\r\nit, and shivered as he made the fire. It was certainly not good election\r\nweather, thought Moses, and others of the orthodox persuasion, high in\r\noffice, were of the same opinion as they stood with parted coat tails\r\nbefore the stove. Whoever had stirred up and organized the hordes,\r\nwhoever was the author of that ticket of the discontented, had not\r\ncounted upon the sleet. Heaven-sent sleet, said Deacon Ira Perkins, and\r\nwould not speak to his son Chester, who sat down just then in one of the\r\nrear slips. Chester had become an agitator, a Jacksonian Democrat, and\r\nan outcast, to be prayed for but not spoken to.\r\n\r\nWe shall leave them their peace of mind for half an hour more,\r\nthose stanch old deacons and selectmen, who did their duty by their\r\nfellow-citizens as they saw it and took no man's bidding. They could not\r\nsee the trackless roads over the hills, now becoming tracked, and the\r\nbent figures driving doggedly against the storm, each impelled by a\r\nmotive: each motive strengthened by a master mind until it had become\r\nimperative. Some, like Eben Williams behind his rickety horse, came\r\nthrough fear; others through ambition; others were actuated by both;\r\nand still others were stung by the pain of the sleet to a still greater\r\njealousy and envy, and the remembrance of those who had been in power. I\r\nmust not omit the conscientious Jacksonians who were misguided enough to\r\nbelieve in such a ticket.\r\n\r\nThe sheds were not large enough to hold the teams that day. Jethro's\r\nbarn and tannery were full, and many other barns in the village. And\r\nnow the peace of mind of the orthodox is a thing of the past. Deacon\r\nLysander Richardson, the moderator, sits aghast in his high place as\r\nthey come trooping in, men who have not been to town meeting for ten\r\nyears. Deacon Lysander, with his white band of whiskers that goes around\r\nhis neck like a sixteenth-century ruff under his chin, will soon be a\r\nmemory. Now enters one, if Deacon Lysander had known it symbolic of the\r\nnew Era. One who, though his large head is bent, towers over most of\r\nthe men who make way for him in the aisle, nodding but not speaking,\r\nand takes his place in the chair under the platform on the right of the\r\nmeeting-pause under one of the high, three-part windows. That chair\r\nwas always his in future years, and there he sat afterward, silent,\r\napparently taking no part. But not a man dropped a ballot into the box\r\nwhom Jethro Bass did not see and mark.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the meeting-house is crowded as it has never been before,\r\nwhen Jonah Winch has arranged his dinner booth in the corner, Deacon\r\nLysander raps for order and the minister prays. They proceed, first,\r\nto elect a representative to the General Court. The Jacksonians do not\r\ncontest that seat,--this year,--and Isaiah Prescott, fourteenth child\r\nof Timothy, the Stark hero, father of a young Ephraim whom we shall hear\r\nfrom later, is elected. And now! Now for a sensation, now for disorder\r\nand misrule!\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” says Deacon Lysander, “you will prepare your ballots for\r\nthe choice of the first Selectman.”\r\n\r\nThe Whigs have theirs written out, Deacon Moses Hatch. But who has\r\nwritten out these others that are being so assiduously passed around?\r\nSam Price, perhaps, for he is passing them most assiduously. And what\r\nname is written on them? Fletcher Bartlett, of course; that was on the\r\nticket. Somebody is tricked again. That is not the name on the ticket.\r\nLook over Sara Price's shoulder and you will see the name--Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nIt bursts from the lips of Fletcher Bartlett himself--of Fletcher,\r\ninflammable as gunpowder.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I withdraw as your candidate, and nominate a better and an\r\nabler man,--Jethro Bass.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass for Chairman of the Selectmen!”\r\n\r\nThe cry is taken up all over the meeting-house, and rises high above the\r\nhiss of the sleet on the great windows. Somebody's got on the stove, to\r\nadd to the confusion and horror. The only man in the whole place who is\r\nnot excited is Jethro Bass himself, who sits in his chair regardless of\r\nthose pressing around him. Many years afterward he confessed to some one\r\nthat he was surprised--and this is true. Fletcher Bartlett had surprised\r\nand tricked him, but was forgiven. Forty men are howling at the\r\nmoderator, who is pounding on the table with a blacksmith's blows.\r\nSquire Asa Northcutt, with his arms fanning like a windmill from the\r\nedge of the platform, at length shouts down everybody else--down to a\r\nhum. Some listen to him: hear the words “infamous outrage”--“if Jethro\r\nBass is elected Selectman, Coniston will never be able to hold up her\r\nhead among her sister towns for very shame.” (Momentary blank, for\r\nsomebody has got on the stove again, a scuffle going on there.) “I see\r\nit all now,” says the Squire--(marvel of perspicacity!) “Jethro Bass has\r\ndebased and debauched this town--” (blank again, and the squire points\r\na finger of rage and scorn at the unmoved offender in the chair) “he\r\nhas bought and intimidated men to do his bidding. He has sinned against\r\nheaven, and against the spirit of that most immortal of documents--”\r\n (Blank again. Most unfortunate blank, for this is becoming oratory, but\r\nsomebody from below has seized the squire by the leg.) Squire Northcutt\r\nis too dignified and elderly a person to descend to rough and tumble,\r\nbut he did get his leg liberated and kicked Fletcher Bartlett in the\r\nface. Oh, Coniston, that such scenes should take place in your town\r\nmeeting! By this time another is orating, Mr. Sam Price, Jackson\r\nDemocrat. There was no shorthand reporter in Coniston in those days,\r\nand it is just as well, perhaps, that the accusations and recriminations\r\nshould sink into oblivion.\r\n\r\nAt last, by mighty efforts of the peace loving in both parties,\r\nsomething like order is restored, the ballots are in the box, and Deacon\r\nLysander is counting them: not like another moderator I have heard of,\r\nwho spilled the votes on the floor until his own man was elected.\r\nNo. Had they registered his own death sentence, the deacon would have\r\ncounted them straight, and needed no town clerk to verify his\r\nfigures. But when he came to pronounce the vote, shame and sorrow and\r\nmortification overcame him. Coniston, his native town, which he had\r\nserved and revered, was dishonored, and it was for him, Lysander\r\nRichardson, to proclaim her disgrace. The deacon choked, and tears of\r\nbitterness stood in his eyes, and there came a silence only broken by\r\nthe surging of the sleet as he rapped on the table.\r\n\r\n“Seventy-five votes have been cast for Jethro Bass--sixty-three for\r\nMoses Hatch. Necessary for a choice, seventy--and Jethro Bass is elected\r\nsenior Selectman.”\r\n\r\nThe deacon sat down, and men say that a great sob shook him, while\r\nJacksonian Democracy went wild--not looking into future years to see\r\nwhat they were going wild about. Jethro Bass Chairman of the Board of\r\nSelectmen, in the honored place of Deacon Moses Hatch! Bourbon royalists\r\nnever looked with greater abhorrence on the Corsican adventurer and\r\nusurper of the throne than did the orthodox in Coniston on this tanner,\r\nwho had earned no right to aspire to any distinction, and who by his\r\nwiles had acquired the highest office in the town government. Fletcher\r\nBartlett in, as a leader of the irresponsible opposition, would have\r\nbeen calamity enough. But Jethro Bass!\r\n\r\nThis man whom they had despised was the master mind who had organized\r\nand marshalled the loose vote, was the author of that ticket, who sat in\r\nhis corner unmoved alike by the congratulations of his friends and the\r\nmaledictions of his enemies; who rose to take his oath of office as\r\nunconcerned as though the house were empty, albeit Deacon Lysander\r\ncould scarcely get the words out. And then Jethro sat down again in his\r\nchair--not to leave it for six and thirty years. From this time forth\r\nthat chair became a seat of power, and of dominion over a state.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Jock Hallowell's prophecy, so lightly uttered, came to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nHow the remainder of that Jacksonian ticket was elected, down to the\r\nvery hog-reeves, and amid what turmoil of the Democracy and bitterness\r\nof spirit of the orthodox, I need not recount. There is no moral to\r\nthe story, alas--it was one of those things which inscrutable heaven\r\npermitted to be done. After that dark town-meeting day some of those\r\nstern old fathers became broken men, and it is said in Coniston that\r\nthis calamity to righteous government, and not the storm, gave to Priest\r\nWare his death-stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAnd now we must go back for a chapter--a very short chapter--to the day\r\nbefore that town meeting which had so momentous an influence upon the\r\nhistory of Coniston and of the state. That Monday, too, it will be\r\nremembered, dawned in storm, the sleet hissing in the wide throats of\r\nthe centre-chimneys, and bearing down great boughs of trees until they\r\nbroke in agony. Dusk came early, and howling darkness that hid a muffled\r\nfigure on the ice-bound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery\r\ndoor. Presently the figure crossed the yard; the door, flying open,\r\nreleased a shaft of light that shot across the white ground, revealed a\r\nface beneath a hood to him who stood within.\r\n\r\n“Jethro!”\r\n\r\nShe darted swiftly past him, seizing the door and drawing it closed\r\nafter her. A lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon\r\nhis face. Her own, mercifully, was in the shadow, and burning now with\r\na shame that was insupportable. Now that she was there, beside him, her\r\nstrength failed her, and her courage--courage that she had been storing\r\nfor this dread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day.\r\nNow that she was there, she would have given her life to have been able\r\nto retrace her steps, to lose herself in the wild, dark places of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy!” His voice betrayed the passion which her presence had\r\nquickened.\r\n\r\nThe words she would have spoken would not come. She could think of\r\nnothing but that she was alone with him, and in bodily terror of him.\r\nShe turned to the door again, to grasp the wooden latch; but he barred\r\nthe way, and she fell back.\r\n\r\n“Let me go,” she cried. “I did not mean to come. Do you hear?--let me\r\ngo!”\r\n\r\nTo her amazement he stepped aside--a most unaccountable action for him.\r\nMore unaccountable still, she did not move, now that she was free, but\r\nstood poised for flight, held by she knew not what.\r\n\r\n“G-go if you've a mind to, Cynthy--if you've a mind to.”\r\n\r\n“I've come to say something to you,” she faltered. It was not, at all\r\nthe way she had pictured herself as saying it.\r\n\r\n“H-haven't took' Moses--have you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she cried, “do you think I came here to speak of such a thing as\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“H-haven't took--Moses, have you?”\r\n\r\nShe was trembling, and yet she could almost have smiled at this\r\nwell-remembered trick of pertinacity.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, and immediately hated herself for answering him.\r\n\r\n“H-haven't took that Worthington cuss?”\r\n\r\nHe was jealous!\r\n\r\n“I didn't come to discuss Mr. Worthington,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Folks say it's only a matter of time,” said he. “Made up your mind to\r\ntake him, Cynthy? M-made up your mind?”\r\n\r\n“You've no right to talk to me in this way,” she said, and added, the\r\nwords seeming to slip of themselves from her lips, “Why do you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Because I'm--interested,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You haven't shown it,” she flashed back, forgetting the place, and the\r\nstorm, and her errand even, forgetting that Jake Wheeler, or any one in\r\nConiston, might come and surprise her there.\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward her, and she retreated. The light struck her face,\r\nand he bent over her as though searching it for a sign. The cape on her\r\nshoulders rose and fell as she breathed.\r\n\r\n“'Twahn't charity, Cynthy--was it? 'Twahn't charity?”\r\n\r\n“It was you who called it such,” she answered, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nA sleet-charged gust hurled itself against the door, and the lantern\r\nflickered.\r\n\r\n“Wahn't it charity.”\r\n\r\n“It was friendship, Jethro. You ought to have known that, and you should\r\nnot have brought back the book.”\r\n\r\n“Friendship,” he repeated, “y-you said friendship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“M-meant friendship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia, but more faintly, and yet with a certain delicious\r\nfright as she glanced at him shyly. Surely there had never been a\r\nstranger man! Now he was apparently in a revery.\r\n\r\n“G-guess it's because I'm not good enough to be anything more,” he\r\nremarked suddenly. “Is that it?”\r\n\r\n“You have not tried even to be a friend,” she said.\r\n\r\n“H-how about Worthington?” he persisted. “Just friends with him?”\r\n\r\n“I won't talk about Mr. Worthington,” cried Cynthia, desperately, and\r\nretreated toward the lantern again.\r\n\r\n“J-just friends with Worthington?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked, her words barely heard above the gust, “why do you\r\nwant to know?”\r\n\r\nHe came after her. It was as if she had summoned some unseen,\r\nuncontrollable power, only to be appalled by it, and the mountain-storm\r\nwithout seemed the symbol of it. His very voice seemed to partake of its\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy,” he said, “if you'd took him, I'd have killed him. Cynthy, I\r\nlove you--I want you to be my woman--”\r\n\r\n“Your woman!”\r\n\r\nHe caught her, struggling wildly, terror-stricken, in his arms, beat\r\ndown her hands, flung back her hood, and kissed her forehead--her hair,\r\nblown by the wind--her lips. In that moment she felt the mystery of\r\nheaven and hell, of all kinds of power. In that moment she was like a\r\nseed flying in the storm above the mountain spruces whither, she knew\r\nnot, cared not. There was one thought that drifted across the chaos like\r\na blue light of the spirit: Could she control the storm? Could she say\r\nwhither the winds might blow, where the seed might be planted? Then\r\nshe found herself listening, struggling no longer, for he held her\r\npowerless. Strangest of all, most hopeful of all, his own mind was\r\nworking, though his soul rocked with passion.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy--ever since we stopped that day on the road in Northcutt's\r\nwoods, I've thought of nothin' but to marry you--m-marry you. Then you\r\ngive me that book--I hain't had much education, but it come across me\r\nif you was to help me that way--And when I seed you with Worthington, I\r\ncould have killed him easy as breakin' bark.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Jethro.”\r\n\r\nShe struggled free and leaped away from him, panting, while he tore open\r\nhis coat and drew forth something which gleamed in the lantern's rays--a\r\nsilver locket. Cynthia scarcely saw it. Her blood was throbbing in her\r\ntemples, she could not reason, but she knew that the appeal for the sake\r\nof which she had stooped must be delivered now.\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” she said, “do you know why I came here--why I came to you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “No. W--wanted me, didn't you? Wanted me--I wanted you,\r\nCynthy.”\r\n\r\n“I would never have come to you for that,” she cried, “never!”\r\n\r\n“L-love me, Cynthy--love me, don't you?”\r\n\r\nHow could he ask, seeing that she had been in his arms, and had not\r\nfled? And yet she must go through with what she had come to do, at any\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n“Jethro, I have come to speak to you about the town meeting tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nHe halted as though he had been struck, his hand tightening over the\r\nlocket.\r\n\r\n“T-town meetin'?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. All this new organization is your doing,” she cried. “Do you think\r\nthat I am foolish enough to believe that Fletcher Bartlett or Sam Price\r\nplanned this thing? No, Jethro. I know who has done it, and I could have\r\ntold them if they had asked me.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and the light of a new admiration was in his eye.\r\n\r\n“Knowed it--did you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, a little defiantly, “I did.”\r\n\r\n“H-how'd you know it--how'd you know it, Cynthy?” How did she know it,\r\nindeed?\r\n\r\n“I guessed it,” said Cynthia, desperately, “knowing you, I guessed it.”\r\n\r\n“A-always thought you was smart, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, did you do this thing?”\r\n\r\n“Th-thought you knowed it--th-thought you knowed.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that these men are doing your bidding.”\r\n\r\n“Hain't you guessin' a little mite too much; Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” she said, “you told me just now that--that you loved me. Don't\r\ntouch me!” she cried, when he would have taken her in his arms again.\r\n“If you love me, you will tell me why you have done such a thing.”\r\n\r\nWhat instinct there was in the man which forbade him speaking out to\r\nher, I know not. I do believe that he would have confessed, if he could.\r\nIsaac Worthington had been impelled to reveal his plans and aspirations,\r\nbut Jethro Bass was as powerless in this supreme moment of his life as\r\nwas Coniston Mountain to move the granite on which it stood. Cynthia's\r\nheart sank, and a note of passionate appeal came into her voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jethro!” she cried, “this is not the way to use your power, to\r\ncompel men like Eben Williams and Samuel Todd and--and Lyman Hull, who\r\nis a drunkard and a vagabond, to come in and vote for those who are not\r\nfit to hold office.” She was using the minister's own arguments. “We\r\nhave always had clean men, and honorable and good men.”\r\n\r\nHe did not speak, but dropped his hands to his sides. His thoughts\r\nwere not to be fathomed, yet Cynthia took the movement for silent\r\nconfession,--which it was not, and stood appalled at the very magnitude\r\nof his accomplishment, astonished at the secrecy he had maintained. She\r\nhad heard that his name had been mentioned in the meeting at the house\r\nof Moses Hatch as having taken part in the matter, and she guessed\r\nsomething of certain of his methods. But she had felt his force, and\r\nknew that this was not the only secret of his power.\r\n\r\nWhat might he not aspire to, if properly guided? No, she did not believe\r\nhim to be, unscrupulous--but merely ignorant: a man who was capable of\r\nsuch love as she felt was in him, a man whom she could love, could not\r\nmean to be unscrupulous. Defence of him leaped to her own lips.\r\n\r\n“You did not know what you were doing,” she said. “I was sure of it,\r\nor I would not have come to you. Oh, Jethro! you must stop it--you must\r\nprevent this election.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his, her own pleading, and the very wind without seemed to\r\npause for his answer. But what she asked was impossible. That wind\r\nwhich he himself had loosed, which was to topple over institutions, was\r\nrising, and he could no more have stopped it then than he could have\r\nhushed the storm.\r\n\r\n“You will not do what I ask--now?” she said, very slowly. Then her voice\r\nfailed her, she drew her hands together, and it was as if her heart had\r\nceased to beat. Sorrow and anger and fierce shame overwhelmed her, and\r\nshe turned from him in silence and went to the door.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy,” he cried hoarsely, “Cynthy!”\r\n\r\n“You must never speak to me again,” she said, and was gone into the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nYes, she had failed. But she did not know that she had left something\r\nbehind which he treasured as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when the new leaves were green on the slopes of Coniston,\r\nPriest Ware ended a life of faithful service. The high pulpit, taken\r\nfrom the old meeting house, and the cricket on which he used to stand\r\nand the Bible from which he used to preach have remained objects of\r\nveneration in Coniston to this day. A fortnight later many tearful faces\r\ngazed after the Truro coach as it galloped out of Brampton in a cloud\r\nof dust, and one there was watching unseen from the spruces on the hill,\r\nwho saw within it a girl dressed in black, dry-eyed, staring from the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOut of the stump of a blasted tree in the Coniston woods a flower will\r\nsometimes grow, and even so the story which I have now to tell springs\r\nfrom the love of Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. The flower, when it came\r\nto bloom, was fair in life, and I hope that in these pages it will not\r\nlose too much of its beauty and sweetness.\r\n\r\nFor a little while we are going to gallop through the years as before we\r\nhave ambled through the days, although the reader's breath may be\r\ntaken away in the process. How Cynthia Ware went over the Truro Pass to\r\nBoston, and how she became a teacher in a high school there;--largely\r\nthrough the kindness of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom we have\r\nspoken, who wrote in Cynthia's behalf to certain friends she had in\r\nthat city; how she met one William Wetherell, no longer a clerk in\r\nMr. Judson's jewellery shop, but a newspaper man with I know not what\r\nambitions--and limitations in strength of body and will; how, many, many\r\nyears afterward, she nursed him tenderly through a sickness and--married\r\nhim, is all told in a paragraph. Marry him she did, to take care of him,\r\nand told him so. She made no secret of the maternal in this love.\r\n\r\nOne evening, the summer after their marriage, they were walking in the\r\nMall under the great elms that border the Common on the Tremont Street\r\nside. They often used to wander there, talking of the books he was to\r\nwrite when strength should come and a little leisure, and sometimes\r\ntheir glances would linger longingly on Colonnade Row that Bulfinch\r\nbuilt across the way, where dwelt the rich and powerful of the city--and\r\nyet he would not have exchanged their lot for his. Could he have earned\r\nwith his own hands such a house, and sit Cynthia there in glory, what\r\nhappiness! But, I stray.\r\n\r\nThey were walking in the twilight, for the sun had sunk all red in the\r\nmarshes of the Charles, when there chanced along a certain Mr. Judson,\r\na jeweller, taking the air likewise. So there came into Wetherell's mind\r\nthat amusing adventure with the country lad and the locket. His name,\r\nby reason of some strange quality in it, he had never forgotten, and\r\nsuddenly he recalled that the place the countryman had come from was\r\nConiston.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” said her husband, when Mr. Judson was gone, “did you know any\r\none in Coniston named Jethro Bass?”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him. And, thinking she had not heard, he spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask?” she said, in a low tone, without looking at him.\r\n\r\nHe told her the story. Not until the end of it did the significance of\r\nthe name engraved come to him--Cynthy.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy, from Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it might have been you!” he said jestingly. “Was he an admirer of\r\nyours, Cynthia, that strange, uncouth countryman? Did he give you the\r\nlocket?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered, “he never did.”\r\n\r\nWetherell glanced at her in surprise, and saw that her lip was\r\nquivering, that tears were on her lashes. She laid her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n“William,” she said, drawing him to a bench, “come, let us sit down, and\r\nI will tell you the story of Jethro Bass. We have been happy together,\r\nyou and I, for I have found peace with you. I have tried to be honest\r\nwith you, William, and I will always be so. I told you before we were\r\nmarried that I loved another man. I have tried to forget him, but as God\r\nis my judge, I cannot. I believe I shall love him until I die.”\r\n\r\nThey sat in the summer twilight, until darkness fell, and the lights\r\ngleamed through the leaves, and a deep, cool breath coming up from the\r\nsea stirred the leaves above their heads. That she should have loved\r\nJethro seemed as strange to her as to him, and yet Wetherell was to feel\r\nthe irresistible force of him. Hers was not a love that she chose, or\r\nwould have chosen, but something elemental that cried out from the man\r\nto her, and drew her. Something that had in it now, as of yore, much of\r\npain and even terror, but drew her. Strangest of all was that William\r\nWetherell understood and was not jealous of this thing: which leads\r\nus to believe that some essence of virility was lacking in him, some\r\nsubstance that makes the fighters and conquerors in this world. In such\r\nmood he listened to the story of Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\n“My dear husband,” said Cynthia, when she had finished, her hand\r\ntightening over his, “I have never told you this for fear that it might\r\ntrouble you as it has troubled me. I have found in your love sanctuary;\r\nand all that remains of myself I have given to you.”\r\n\r\n“You have found a weakling to protect, and an invalid to nurse,” he\r\nanswered. “To have your compassion, Cynthia, is all I crave.”\r\n\r\nSo they lived through the happiest and swiftest years of his life,\r\nworking side by side, sharing this strange secret between them. And\r\nafter that night Cynthia talked to him often of Coniston, until he\r\ncame to know the mountain that lay along the western sky, and the sweet\r\nhillsides by Coniston Water under the blue haze of autumn, aye, and\r\nclothed in the colors of spring, the bright blossoms of thorn and apple\r\nagainst the tender green of the woods and fields. So he grew to love the\r\nsimple people there, but little did he foresee that he was to end his\r\nlife among them!\r\n\r\nBut so it came to pass, she was taken from him, who had been the one joy\r\nand inspiration of his weary days, and he was driven, wandering, into\r\nunfrequented streets that he might not recall, the places where she had\r\nonce trod, and through the wakeful nights her voice haunted him,--its\r\nlaughter, its sweet notes of seriousness; little ways and manners of her\r\nlook came to twist his heart, and he prayed God to take him, too, until\r\nit seemed that Cynthia frowned upon him for his weakness. One mild\r\nSunday afternoon, he took little Cynthia by the hand and led her,\r\ntoddling, out into the sunny Common, where he used to walk with her\r\nmother, and the infant prattle seemed to bring--at last a strange peace\r\nto his storm-tossed soul.\r\n\r\nFor many years these Sunday walks in the Common were Wetherell's\r\ngreatest pleasure and solace, and it seemed as though little Cynthia had\r\ncome into the world with an instinct, as it were, of her mission that\r\nlent to her infant words a sweet gravity and weight. Many people used to\r\nstop and speak to the child, among them a great physician whom they grew\r\nto know. He was, there every Sunday, and at length it came to be a habit\r\nwith him to sit down on the bench and take Cynthia on his knee, and his\r\nstern face would soften as he talked to her.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday when Cynthia was eight years old he missed them, and the\r\nnext, and at dusk he strode into their little lodging behind the hill\r\nand up to the bedside. He glanced at Wetherell, patting Cynthia on the\r\nhead the while, and bade her cheerily to go out of the room. But\r\nshe held tight hold of her father's hand and looked up at the doctor\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\n“I am taking care of my father,” she said.\r\n\r\n“So you shall, little woman,” he answered. “I would that we had such\r\nnurses as you at the hospital. Why didn't you send for me at once?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Bless her good sense;” said the doctor; “she has more than you,\r\nWetherell. Why didn't you take her advice? If your father does not do\r\nas I tell him, he will be a very sick man indeed. He must go into the\r\ncountry and stay there.”\r\n\r\n“But I must live, Doctor,” said William Wetherell.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“You will not live if you stay here,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Then he will go,” said Cynthia, so quietly that he gave her another\r\nlook, strange and tender and comprehending. He, sat and talked of many\r\nthings: of the great war that was agonizing the nation; of the strong\r\nman who, harassed and suffering himself, was striving to guide it,\r\nlikening Lincoln unto a physician. So the doctor was wont to take the\r\nminds of patients from themselves. And before he left he gave poor\r\nWetherell a fortnight to decide.\r\n\r\nAs he lay on his back in that room among the chimney tops trying vainly\r\nto solve the problem of how he was to earn his salt in the country, a\r\nvisitor was climbing the last steep flight of stairs. That visitor\r\nwas none other than Sergeant Ephraim Prescott, son of Isaiah of the\r\npitch-pipe, and own cousin of Cynthia Ware's. Sergeant Ephraim was just\r\nhome from the war and still clad in blue, and he walked with a slight\r\nlimp by reason of a bullet he had got in the Wilderness, and he had such\r\nan honest, genial face that little Cynthia was on his knee in a moment.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Will? Kind of poorly, I callate. So Cynthy's b'en took,” he\r\nsaid sadly. “Always thought a sight of Cynthy. Little Cynthy favors her\r\nsome. Yes, thought I'd drop in and see how you be on my way home.”\r\n\r\nSergeant Ephraim had much to say about the great war, and about\r\nConiston. True to the instincts of the blood of the Stark hero, he had\r\nleft the plough and the furrow' at the first call, forty years of age\r\nthough he was. But it had been otherwise with many in Coniston and\r\nBrampton and Harwich. Some of these, when the drafting came, had fled in\r\nbands to the mountain and defied capture. Mr. Dudley Worthington, now\r\na mill owner, had found a substitute; Heth Sutton of Clovelly had been\r\ndrafted and had driven over the mountain to implore Jethro Bass abjectly\r\nto get him out of it. In short, many funny things had happened--funny\r\nthings to Sergeant Ephraim, but not at all to William Wetherell, who\r\nsympathized with Heth in his panic.\r\n\r\n“So Jethro Bass has become a great man,” said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Great!” Ephraim ejaculated. “Guess he's the biggest man in the state\r\nto-day. Queer how he got his power began twenty-four years ago when\r\nI wahn't but twenty. I call that town meetin' to mind as if 'twas\r\nyesterday never was such an upset. Jethro's be'n first Selectman\r\never sense, though he turned Republican in '60. Old folks don't fancy\r\nJethro's kind of politics much, but times change. Jethro saved my life,\r\nI guess.”\r\n\r\n“Saved your life!” exclaimed Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Got me a furlough,” said Ephraim. “Guess I would have died in the\r\nhospital if he hadn't got it so all-fired quick, and he druv down to\r\nBrampton to fetch me back. You'd have thought I was General Grant the\r\nway folks treated me.”\r\n\r\n“You went back to the war after your leg healed?” Wetherell asked, in\r\nwondering admiration of the man's courage.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Ephraim, simply, “the other boys was gettin' full of\r\nbullets and dysentery, and it didn't seem just right. The leg troubles\r\nme some on wet days, but not to amount to much. You hain't thinkin' of\r\ndyin' yourself, be ye, William?”\r\n\r\nWilliam was thinking very seriously of it, but it was Cynthia who spoke,\r\nand startled them both.\r\n\r\n“The doctor says he will die if he doesn't go to the country.”\r\n\r\n“Somethin' like consumption, William?” asked Ephraim.\r\n\r\n“So the doctor said.”\r\n\r\n“So I callated,” said Ephraim. “Come back to Coniston with me; there\r\nhain't a healthier place in New England.”\r\n\r\n“How could I support myself in Coniston?” Wetherell asked.\r\n\r\nEphraim ruminated. Suddenly he stuck his hand into the bosom of his blue\r\ncoat, and his face lighted and even gushed as he drew out a crumpled\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“It don't take much gumption to run a store, does it, William? Guess you\r\ncould run a store, couldn't you?”\r\n\r\n“I would try anything,” said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Ephraim' “there's the store at Coniston. With folks goin'\r\nWest, and all that, nobody seems to want it much.” He looked at the\r\nletter. “Lem Hallowell' says there hain't nobody to take it.”\r\n\r\n“Jonah Winch's!” exclaimed Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Jonah made it go, but that was before all this hullabaloo about\r\nTemperance Cadets and what not. Jonah sold good rum, but now you can't\r\nget nothin' in Coniston but hard cider and potato whiskey. Still, it's\r\nthe place for somebody without much get-up,” and he eyed his cousin by\r\nmarriage. “Better come and try it, William.”\r\n\r\nSo much for dreams! Instead of a successor to Irving and Emerson,\r\nWilliam Wetherell became a successor to Jonah Winch.\r\n\r\nThat journey to Coniston was full of wonder to Cynthia, and of wonder\r\nand sadness to Wetherell, for it was the way his other Cynthia had come\r\nto Boston. From the state capital the railroad followed the same deep\r\nvalley as the old coach road, but ended at Truro, and then they took\r\nstage over Truro Pass for Brampton, where honest Ephraim awaited them\r\nand their slender luggage with a team. Brampton, with its wide-shadowed\r\ngreen, and terrace-steepled church; home once of the Social Library and\r\nLucretia Penniman, now famous; home now of Isaac Dudley Worthington,\r\nwhose great mills the stage driver had pointed out to them on Coniston\r\nWater as they entered the town.\r\n\r\nThen came a drive through the cool evening to Coniston, Ephraim showing\r\nthem landmarks. There was Deacon Lysander's house, where little Rias\r\nRichardson lived now; and on that slope and hidden in its forest nook,\r\namong the birches and briers, the little schoolhouse where Cynthia had\r\nlearned to spell; here, where the road made an aisle in the woods, she\r\nhad met Jethro. The choir of the birds was singing an evening anthem now\r\nas then, to the lower notes of Coniston Water, and the moist, hothouse\r\nfragrance of the ferns rose from the deep places.\r\n\r\nAt last they came suddenly upon the little hamlet of Coniston itself.\r\nThere was the flagpole and the triangular green, scene of many a muster;\r\nJonah Winch's store, with its horse block and checker-paned\r\nwindows, just as Jonah had left it; Nathan Bass's tannery shed, now\r\nweather-stained and neglected, for Jethro lived on Thousand Acre Hill\r\nnow; the Prescott house, home of the Stark hero, where Ephraim lived,\r\n“innocent of paint” (as one of Coniston's sons has put it), “innocent\r\nof paint as a Coniston maiden's face”; the white meeting-house, where\r\nPriest Ware had preached--and the parsonage. Cynthia and Wetherell\r\nloitered in front of it, while the blue shadow of the mountain deepened\r\ninto night, until Mr. Satterlee, the minister, found them there, and\r\nthey went in and stood reverently in the little chamber on the right of\r\nthe door, which had been Cynthia's.\r\n\r\nLong Wetherell lay awake that night, in his room at the gable-end\r\nover the store, listening to the rustling of the great oak beside the\r\nwindows, to the whippoorwills calling across Coniston Water. But at last\r\na peace descended upon him, and he slept: yes, and awoke with the\r\nsame sense of peace at little Cynthia's touch, to go out into the cool\r\nmorning, when the mountain side was in myriad sheens of green under the\r\nrising sun. Behind the store was an old-fashioned garden, set about by\r\na neat stone wall, hidden here and there by the masses of lilac and\r\ncurrant bushes, and at the south of it was a great rose-covered boulder\r\nof granite. And beyond, through the foliage of the willows and the low\r\napple trees which Jonah Winch had set out, Coniston Water gleamed and\r\ntumbled. Under an arching elm near the house was the well, stone-rimmed,\r\nwith its long pole and crotch, and bucket all green with the damp moss\r\nwhich clung to it.\r\n\r\nEphraim Prescott had been right when he had declared that it did not\r\ntake much gumption to keep store in Coniston. William Wetherell merely\r\nassumed certain obligations at the Brampton bank, and Lem Hallowell,\r\nJock's son, who now drove the Brampton stage, brought the goods to the\r\ndoor. Little Rias Richardson was willing to come in, and help move the\r\nbarrels, and on such occasions wore carpet slippers to save his shoes.\r\nWilliam still had time for his books; in that Coniston air he began to\r\nfeel stronger, and to wonder whether he might not be a Washington Irving\r\nyet. And yet he had one worry and one fear, and both of these concerned\r\none man,--Jethro Bass. Him, by her own confession, Cynthia Ware\r\nhad loved to her dying day, hating herself for it: and he, William\r\nWetherell, had married this woman whom Jethro had loved so violently,\r\nand must always love--so Wetherell thought: that was the worry. How\r\nwould Jethro treat him? that was the fear. William Wetherell was not the\r\nmost courageous man in the world.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass had not been in Coniston since William's arrival. No need\r\nto ask where he was. Jake Wheeler, Jethro's lieutenant in Coniston, gave\r\nWilliam a glowing account of that Throne Room in the Pelican Hotel at\r\nthe capital, from whence Jethro ruled the state during the sessions of\r\nthe General Court. This legislature sat to him as a sort of advisory\r\ncommittee of three hundred and fifty: an expensive advisory committee to\r\nthe people, relic of an obsolete form of government. Many stories of the\r\nnow all-powerful Jethro William heard from the little coterie which made\r\ntheir headquarters in his store--stories of how those methods of which\r\nwe have read were gradually spread over other towns and other counties.\r\nNot that Jethro held mortgages in these towns and counties, but the\r\nlocal lieutenants did, and bowed to him as an overlord. There were funny\r\nstories, and grim stories of vengeance which William Wetherell heard and\r\ntrembled at. Might not Jethro wish to take vengeance upon him?\r\n\r\nOne story he did not hear, because no one in Coniston knew it. No one\r\nknew that Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass had ever loved each other.\r\n\r\nAt last, toward the end of June, it was noised about that the great\r\nman was coming home for a few days. One beautiful afternoon William\r\nWetherell stood on the platform of the store, looking off at Coniston,\r\ntalking to Moses Hatch--young Moses, who is father of six children now\r\nand has forgotten Cynthia Ware. Old Moses sleeps on the hillside, let\r\nus hope in the peace of the orthodox and the righteous. A cloud of dust\r\narose above the road to the southward, and out of it came a country\r\nwagon drawn by a fat horse, and in the wagon the strangest couple\r\nWetherell had ever seen. The little woman who sat retiringly at one end\r\nof the seat was all in brilliant colors from bonnet to flounce, like\r\na paroquet, red and green predominating. The man, big in build,\r\nlarge-headed, wore an old-fashioned blue swallow-tailed coat with\r\nbrass buttons, a stock, and coonskin hat, though it was summer, and\r\nthe thumping of William Wetherell's heart told him that this was Jethro\r\nBass. He nodded briefly at Moses Hatch, who greeted him with genial\r\nobsequiousness.\r\n\r\n“Legislatur' through?” shouted Moses.\r\n\r\nThe great man shook his head and drove on.\r\n\r\n“Has Jethro Bass ever been a member of the Legislature?” asked the\r\nstorekeeper, for the sake of something to say.\r\n\r\n“Never would take any office but Chairman of the Selectmen,” answered\r\nMoses, who apparently bore no ill will for his father's sake. “Jethro\r\nkind of fathers the Legislatur', I guess, though I don't take much stock\r\nin politics. Goes down sessions to see that they don't get too gumptious\r\nand kick off the swaddlin' clothes.”\r\n\r\n“And--was that his wife?” Wetherell asked, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Listy, they call her. Nobody ever knew how he come to marry her.\r\nJethro went up to Wisdom once, in the centre of the state, and come back\r\nwith her. Funny place to bring a wife from--Wisdom! Funnier place to\r\nbring Listy from. He loads her down with them ribbons and gewgaws--all\r\nthe shades of the rainbow! Says he wants her to be the best-dressed\r\nwoman in the state. Callate she is,” added Moses, with conviction.\r\n“Listy's a fine woman, but all she knows is enough to say, 'Yes,\r\nJethro,' and 'No, Jethro.'--Guess that's all Jethro wants in a wife; but\r\nhe certainly is good to her.”\r\n\r\n“And why has he come back before the Legislature's over?” said\r\nWetherell.\r\n\r\n“Cuttin' of his farms. Always comes back hayin' time. That's the way\r\nJethro spends the money he makes in politics, and he hain't no more of a\r\nfarmer than--” Moses looked at Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Than I'm a storekeeper,” said the latter, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Than I'm a lawyer,” said Moses, politely.\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted at this moment by the appearance of Jake Wheeler\r\nand Sam Price, who came gaping out of the darkness of the store.\r\n\r\n“Was that Jethro, Mose?” demanded Jake. “Guess we'll go along up and see\r\nif there's any orders.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the humblest of God's critturs has their uses,” Moses\r\nremarked contemplatively, as he watched the retreating figures of Sam\r\nand Jake. “Leastwise that's Jethro's philosophy. When you come to know\r\nhim, you'll notice how much those fellers walk like him. Never seed a\r\nman who had so many imitators. Some of, 'em's took to talkie' like him,\r\neven to stutterin'. Bijah Bixby, over to Clovelly, comes pretty nigh it,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\nMoses loaded his sugar and beans into his wagon, and drove off.\r\n\r\nAn air of suppressed excitement seemed to pervade those who came that\r\nafternoon to the store to trade and talk--mostly to talk. After such\r\npurchases as they could remember were made, they lingered on the barrels\r\nand on the stoop, in the hope of seeing Jethro, whose habit; it was,\r\napparently, to come down and dispense such news as he thought fit for\r\ncirculation. That Wetherell shared this excitement, too, he could not\r\ndeny, but for a different cause. At last, when the shadows of the big\r\ntrees had crept across the green, he came, the customers flocking to\r\nthe porch to greet him, Wetherell standing curiously behind them in the\r\ndoor. Heedless of the dust, he strode down the road with the awkward\r\ngait that was all his own, kicking up his heels behind. And behind him,\r\nheels kicking up likewise, followed Jake and Sam, Jethro apparently\r\noblivious of their presence. A modest silence was maintained from the\r\nstoop, broken at length by Lem Hallowell, who (men said) was an exact\r\nreproduction of Jock, the meeting-house builder. Lem alone was not\r\nabashed in the presence of greatness.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Jethro?” he said heartily. “Air the Legislatur' behavin'\r\nthemselves?”\r\n\r\n“B-bout as common,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nSurely nothing very profound in this remark, but received as though it\r\nwere Solomon's.\r\n\r\nBe prepared for a change in Jethro, after the galloping years. He is\r\nnow fifty-seven, but he might be any age. He is still smooth-shaven, his\r\nskin is clear, and his eye is bright, for he lives largely on bread and\r\nmilk, and eschews stimulants. But the lines in his face have deepened\r\nand his big features seem to have grown bigger.\r\n\r\n“Who be you thinkin' of for next governor, Jethro?” queries Rias\r\nRichardson, timidly.\r\n\r\n“They say Alvy Hopkins of Gosport is willin' to pay for it,” said\r\nChester Perkins, sarcastically. Chester; we fear, is a born agitator,\r\nfated to remain always in opposition. He is still a Democrat, and\r\nJethro, as is well known, has extended the mortgage so as to include\r\nChester's farm.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn't give a Red Brook Seedling for Alvy,” ejaculated the nasal Mr.\r\nPrice.\r\n\r\n“D-don't like Red Brook Seedlings, Sam? D-don't like 'em?” said Jethro.\r\nHe had parted his blue coat tails and seated himself on the stoop, his\r\nlong legs hanging over it.\r\n\r\n“Never seed a man who had a good word to say for 'em,” said Mr. Price,\r\nwith less conviction.\r\n\r\n“Done well on mine,” said Jethro, “d-done well. I was satisfied with my\r\nRed Brook Seedlings.”\r\n\r\nMr. Price's sallow face looked as if he would have contradicted another\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“How was that, Jethro?” piped up Jake Wheeler, voicing the general\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nJethro looked off into the blue space beyond the mountain line.\r\n\r\n“G-got mine when they first come round--seed cost me considerable.\r\nRaised more than a hundred bushels L-Listy put some of 'em on the\r\ntable--t-then gave some to my old hoss Tom. Tom said: 'Hain't I always\r\nbeen a good beast, Jethro? Hain't I carried you faithful, summer\r\nand winter, for a good many years? And now you give me Red Brook\r\nSeedlings?'”\r\n\r\nHere everybody laughed, and stopped abruptly, for Jethro still looked\r\ncontemplative.\r\n\r\n“Give some of 'em to the hogs. W-wouldn't touch 'em. H-had over a\r\nhundred bushels on hand--n-new variety. W-what's that feller's name down\r\nto Ayer, Massachusetts, deals in all kinds of seeds? Ellett--that's it.\r\nWrote to Ellet, said I had a hundred bushels of Red Brooks to sell, as\r\nfine a lookin' potato as I had in my cellar. Made up my mind to take\r\nwhat he offered, if it was only five cents. He wrote back a dollar a\r\nbushel. I-I was always satisfied with my Red Brook Seedlings, Sam. But I\r\nnever raised any more--n-never raised any more.”\r\n\r\nUproarious laughter greeted the end of this story, and continued in fits\r\nas some humorous point recurred to one or the other of the listeners.\r\nWilliam Wetherell perceived that the conversation, for the moment at\r\nleast, was safely away from politics, and in that dubious state where it\r\nwas difficult to reopen. This was perhaps what Jethro wanted. Even Jake\r\nWheeler was tongue-tied, and Jethro appeared to be lost in reflection.\r\n\r\nAt this instant a diversion occurred--a trifling diversion, so it seemed\r\nat the time. Around the corner of the store, her cheeks flushed and her\r\ndark hair flying, ran little Cynthia, her hands, browned already by the\r\nConiston sun, filled with wild strawberries.\r\n\r\n“See what I've found, Daddy!” she cried, “see what I've found!”\r\n\r\nJethro Bass started, and flung back his head like a man who has heard a\r\nvoice from another world, and then he looked at the child with a kind of\r\nstupefaction. The cry, died on Cynthia's lips, and she stopped, gazing\r\nup at him with wonder in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“F-found strawberries?” said Jethro, at last.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered. She was very grave and serious now, as was her\r\nmanner in dealing with people.\r\n\r\n“S-show 'em to me,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nCynthia went to him, without embarrassment, and put her hand on his\r\nknee. Not once had he taken his eyes from her face. He put out his\r\nown hand with an awkward, shy movement, picked a strawberry from her\r\nfingers, and thrust it in his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Mm,” said Jethro, gravely. “Er--what's your name, little gal--what's\r\nyour name?”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause.\r\n\r\n“Er--er--Cynthia?” he said at length, “Cynthia?”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia.”\r\n\r\n“Er-er, Cynthia--not Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” she said again.\r\n\r\nHe bent over her and lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n“M-may I call you Cynthy--Cynthy?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Y-yes,” answered Cynthia, looking up to her father and then glancing\r\nshyly at Jethro.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were on the mountain, and he seemed to have forgotten her\r\nuntil she reached out to him, timidly, another strawberry. He seized\r\nher little hand instead and held it between his own--much to the\r\nastonishment of his friends.\r\n\r\n“Whose little gal be you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Dad's.”\r\n\r\n“She's Will Wetherell's daughter,” said Lem Hallowell. “He's took on\r\nthe store. Will,” he added, turning to Wetherell, “let me make you\r\nacquainted with Jethro Bass.”\r\n\r\nJethro rose slowly, and towered above Wetherell on the stoop. There was\r\nan inscrutable look in his black eyes, as of one who sees without being\r\nseen. Did he know who William Wetherell was? If so, he gave no sign, and\r\ntook Wetherell's hand limply.\r\n\r\n“Will's kinder hipped on book-l'arnin',” Lemuel continued kindly. “Come\r\nhere to keep store for his health. Guess you may have heerd, Jethro,\r\nthat Will married Cynthy Ware. You call Cynthy to mind, don't ye?”\r\n\r\nJethro Bass dropped Wetherell's hand, but answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA week passed, and Jethro did not appear in the village, report having\r\nit that he was cutting his farms on Thousand Acre Hill. When Jethro was\r\nfarming,--so it was said,--he would not stop to talk politics even with\r\nthe President of the United States were that dignitary to lean over\r\nhis pasture fence and beckon to him. On a sultry Friday morning, when\r\nWilliam Wetherell was seated at Jonah Winch's desk in the cool recesses\r\nof the store slowly and painfully going over certain troublesome\r\naccounts which seemed hopeless, he was thrown into a panic by the sight\r\nof one staring at him from the far side of a counter. History sometimes\r\nreverses itself.\r\n\r\n“What can I do for you--Mr. Bass?” asked the storekeeper, rather weakly.\r\n\r\n“Just stepped in--stepped in,” he answered. “W-where's Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“She was in the garden--shall I get her?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, parting his coat tails and seating himself on the\r\ncounter. “Go on figurin', don't mind me.”\r\n\r\nThe thing was manifestly impossible. Perhaps Wetherell indicated as much\r\nby his answer.\r\n\r\n“Like storekeepin'?” Jethro asked presently, perceiving that he did not\r\ncontinue his work.\r\n\r\n“A man must live, Mr. Bass,” said Wetherell; “I had to leave the city\r\nfor my health. I began life keeping store,” he added, “but I little\r\nthought I should end it so.”\r\n\r\n“Given to book-l'arnin' then, wahn't you?” Jethro remarked. He did not\r\nsmile, but stared at the square of light that was the doorway, “Judson's\r\njewellery store, wahn't it? Judson's?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Judson's,” Wetherell answered, as soon as he recovered from his\r\namazement. There was no telling from Jethro's manner whether he were\r\nenemy or friend; whether he bore the storekeeper a grudge for having\r\nattained to a happiness that had not been his.\r\n\r\n“Hain't made a great deal out of life, hev you? N-not a great deal?”\r\n Jethro observed at last.\r\n\r\nWetherell flushed, although Jethro had merely stated a truth which had\r\noften occurred to the storekeeper himself.\r\n\r\n“It isn't given to all of us to find Rome in brick and leave it in\r\nmarble,” he replied a little sadly.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass looked at him quickly.\r\n\r\n“Er-what's that?” he demanded. “F-found Rome in brick, left it in\r\nmarble. Fine thought.” He ruminated a little. “Never writ anything--did\r\nyou--never writ anything?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing worth publishing,” answered poor William Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“J-just dreamed'--dreamed and kept store. S--something to have\r\ndreamed--eh--something to have dreamed?”\r\n\r\nWetherell forgot his uneasiness in the unexpected turn the conversation\r\nhad taken. It seemed very strange to him that he was at last face to\r\nface again wish the man whom Cynthia Ware had never been able to drive\r\nfrom her heart. Would, he mention her? Had he continued to love her, in\r\nspite of the woman he had married and adorned? Wetherell asked himself\r\nthese questions before he spoke.\r\n\r\n“It is more to have accomplished,” he said.\r\n\r\n“S-something to have dreamed,” repeated Jethro, rising slowly from the\r\ncounter. He went toward the doorway that led into the garden, and there\r\nhe halted and stood listening.\r\n\r\n“C-Cynthy!” he said, “C-Cynthy!”\r\n\r\nWetherell dropped his pen at the sound of the name on Jethro's lips. But\r\nit was little Cynthia he was calling little Cynthia in the garden. The\r\nchild came at his voice, and stood looking up at him silently.\r\n\r\n“H-how old be you, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Nine,” answered Cynthia, promptly.\r\n\r\n“L-like the country, Cynthy--like the country better than the city?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“And country folks? L--like country folks better than city folks?”\r\n\r\n“I didn't know many city folks,” said Cynthia. “I liked the old doctor\r\nwho sent Daddy up here ever so much, and I liked Mrs. Darwin.”\r\n\r\n“Mis' Darwin?”\r\n\r\n“She kept the house we lived in. She used to give me cookies,” said\r\nCynthia, “and bread to feed the pigeons.”\r\n\r\n“Pigeons? F-folks keep pigeons in the city?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Cynthia, laughing at such an idea; “the pigeons came\r\non the roof under our window, and they used to fly right up on the\r\nwindow-sill and feed out of my hand. They kept me company while Daddy,\r\nwas away, working. On Sundays we used to go into the Common and feed\r\nthem, before Daddy got sick. The Common was something like the country,\r\nonly not half as nice.”\r\n\r\n“C-couldn't pick flowers in the Common and go barefoot--e--couldn't go\r\nbarefoot, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Cynthia, laughing again at his sober face.\r\n\r\n“C-couldn't dig up the Common and plant flowers--could you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course you couldn't.”\r\n\r\n“P-plant 'em out there?” asked Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” cried Cynthia; “I'll show you.” She hesitated a moment, and\r\nthen thrust her hand into his. “Do you want to see?”\r\n\r\n“Guess I do,” said he, energetically, and she led him into the garden,\r\npointing out with pride the rows of sweet peas and pansies, which she\r\nhad made herself. Impelled by a strange curiosity, William Wetherell\r\nwent to the door and watched them. There was a look on the face of\r\nJethro Bass that was new to it as he listened to the child talk of the\r\nwondrous things around them that summer's day,--the flowers and the bees\r\nand the brook (they must go down and stand on the brink of it), and the\r\nsongs of the vireo and the hermit thrush.\r\n\r\n“Hain't lonely here, Cynthy--hain't lonely here?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Not in the country,” said Cynthia. Suddenly she lifted her eyes to his\r\nwith a questioning look. “Are you lonely, sometimes?”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer at once.\r\n\r\n“Not with you, Cynthy--not with you.”\r\n\r\nBy all of which it will be seen that the acquaintance was progressing.\r\nThey sat down for a while on the old millstone that formed the step,\r\nand there discussed Cynthia's tastes. She was too old for dolls, Jethro\r\nsupposed. Yes, Cynthia was too old for dolls. She did not say so, but\r\nthe only doll she had ever owned had become insipid when the delight of\r\nsuch a reality as taking care of a helpless father had been thrust upon\r\nher. Books, suggested Jethro. Books she had known from her earliest\r\ninfancy: they had been piled around that bedroom over the roof. Books\r\nand book lore and the command of the English tongue were William\r\nWetherell's only legacies to his daughter, and many an evening that\r\nspring she had read him to sleep from classic volumes of prose and\r\npoetry I hesitate to name, for fear you will think her precocious. They\r\nwent across the green to Cousin Ephraim Prescott's harness shop, where\r\nJethro had tied his horse, and it was settled that Cynthia liked books.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following this extraordinary conversation, Jethro Bass\r\nand his wife departed for the state capital. Listy was bedecked in\r\namazing greens and yellows, and Jethro drove, looking neither to the\r\nright nor left, his coat tails hanging down behind the seat, the reins\r\nlying slack across the plump quarters of his horse--the same fat Tom\r\nwho, by the way, had so indignantly spurned the Iced Brook Seedlings.\r\nAnd Jake Wheeler went along to bring back the team from Brampton. To\r\nsuch base uses are political lieutenants sometimes put, although fate\r\nwould have told you it was an honor, and he came back to the store that\r\nevening fairly bristling with political secrets which he could not be\r\ninduced to impart.\r\n\r\nOne evening a fortnight later, while the lieutenant was holding forth in\r\ncommendably general terms on the politics of the state to a speechless\r\nif not wholly admiring audience, a bomb burst in their midst. William\r\nWetherell did not know that it was a periodical bomb, like those flung\r\nat regular intervals from the Union mortars into Vicksburg. These bombs,\r\nat any rate, never failed to cause consternation and fright in Coniston,\r\nalthough they never did any harm. One thing noticeable, they were\r\nalways fired in Jethro's absence. And the bombardier was always Chester\r\nPerkins, son of the most unbending and rigorous of tithing-men, but\r\nChester resembled his father in no particular save that he, too, was a\r\ndeacon and a pillar of the church. Deacon Ira had been tall and gaunt\r\nand sunken and uncommunicative. Chester was stout, and said to perspire\r\neven in winter, apoplectic, irascible, talkative, and still, as has\r\nbeen said, a Democrat. He drove up to the store this evening to the not\r\ninappropriate rumble of distant thunder, and he stood up in his wagon in\r\nfront of the gathering and shook his fist in Jake Wheeler's face.\r\n\r\n“This town's tired of puttin' up with a King,” he cried. “Yes, King-=I\r\nsaid it, and I don't care who hears me. It's time to stop this one-man\r\nrule. You kin go and tell him I said it, Jake Wheeler, if you've a mind\r\nto. I guess there's plenty who'll do that.”\r\n\r\nAn uneasy silence followed--the silence which cries treason louder than\r\nany voice. Some shifted uneasily, and spat, and Jake Wheeler thrust\r\nhis hands in his pockets and walked away, as much as to say that it was\r\ntreason even to listen to such talk. Lem Hallowell seemed unperturbed.\r\n\r\n“On the rampage agin, Chet?” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“You'd ought to know better, Lem,” cried the enraged Chester; “hain't\r\nthe hull road by the Four Corners ready to drop into the brook? What be\r\nyou a-goin' to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“I'll show you when I git to it,” answered Lem, quietly. And, show them\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n“Git to it!” shouted Chester, scornfully, “I'll git to it. I'll tell\r\nyou right now I'm a candidate for the Chairman of the Selectmen, if town\r\nmeetin' is eight months away. An', Sam Price, I'll expect the Democrats\r\nto git into line.”\r\n\r\nWith this ultimatum Chester drove away as rapidly as he had come.\r\n\r\n“I want to know!” said Sam Price, an exclamation peculiarly suited to\r\nhis voice. But nevertheless Sam might be counted on in each of these\r\nlittle rebellions. He, too, had remained steadfast to Jacksonian\r\nprinciples, and he had never forgiven Jethro about a little matter of a\r\nstate office which he (Sam) had failed to obtain.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to bed Jake Wheeler had written a letter which he\r\nsent off to the state capital by the stage the next morning. In it he\r\nindicted no less than twenty of his fellow-townsmen for treason; and\r\nhe also thought it wise to send over to Clovelly for Bijah Bixby,\r\na lieutenant in that section, to come and look over the ground and\r\nascertain by his well-known methods how far the treason had eaten into\r\nthe body politic. Such was Jake's ordinary procedure when the bombs were\r\nfired, for Mr. Wheeler was nothing if not cautious.\r\n\r\nThree mornings later, a little after seven o'clock, when the storekeeper\r\nand his small daughter were preparing to go to Brampton upon a very\r\ntroublesome errand, Chester Perkins appeared again. It is always easy to\r\nstir up dissatisfaction among the ne'er-do-wells (Jethro had once done\r\nit himself), and during the three days which had elapsed since Chester\r\nhad flung down the gauntlet there had been more or less of downright\r\ntreason heard in the store. William Wetherell, who had perplexities of\r\nhis own, had done his best to keep out of the discussions that had raged\r\non his cracker boxes and barrels, for his head was a jumble of figures\r\nwhich would not come right. And now as he stood there in the freshness\r\nof the early summer morning, waiting for Lem Hallowell's stage, poor\r\nWetherell's heart was very heavy.\r\n\r\n“Will Wetherell,” said Chester, “you be a gentleman and a student,\r\nhain't you? Read history, hain't you?”\r\n\r\n“I have read some,” said William Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“I callate that a man of parts,” said Chester, “such as you be, will\r\nhelp us agin corruption and a dictator. I'm a-countin' on you,\r\nWill Wetherell. You've got the store, and you kin tell the boys the\r\ndifference between right and wrong. They'll listen to you, because\r\nyou're eddicated.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know anything about politics,” answered Wetherell, with an\r\nappealing glance at the silent group,--group that was always there. Rias\r\nRichardson, who had donned the carpet slippers preparatory to tending\r\nstore for the day, shuffled inside. Deacon Lysander, his father, would\r\nnot have done so.\r\n\r\n“You know somethin' about history and the Constitootion, don't ye?”\r\n demanded Chester, truculently. “N'Jethro Bass don't hold your mortgage,\r\ndoes he? Bank in Brampton holds it--hain't that so? You hain't afeard of\r\nJethro like the rest on 'em, be you?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what right you have to talk to me that way, Mr. Perkins,”\r\n said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“What right? Jethro holds my mortgage--the hull town knows it-and he kin\r\nclose me out to-morrow if he's a mind to--”\r\n\r\n“See here, Chester Perkins,” Lem Hallowell interposed, as he drove up\r\nwith the stage, “what kind of free principles be you preachin'? You'd\r\nought to know better'n coerce.”\r\n\r\n“What be you a-goin' to do about that Four Corners road?” Chester cried\r\nto the stage driver.\r\n\r\n“I give 'em till to-morrow night to fix it,” said Lem. “Git in, Will.\r\nCynthy's over to the harness shop with Eph. We'll stop as we go 'long.”\r\n\r\n“Give 'em till to-morrow night!” Chester shouted after them. “What you\r\ngoin' to do then?”\r\n\r\nBut Lem did not answer this inquiry. He stopped at the harness shop,\r\nwhere Ephraim came limping out and lifted Cynthia to the seat beside her\r\nfather, and they joggled off to Brampton. The dew still lay in myriad\r\ndrops on the red herd's-grass, turning it to lavender in the morning\r\nsun, and the heavy scent of the wet ferns hung in the forest. Lem\r\nwhistled, and joked with little Cynthia, and gave her the reins to\r\ndrive, and of last they came in sight of Brampton Street, with its\r\nterrace-steepled church and line of wagons hitched to the common rail,\r\nfor it was market day. Father and daughter walked up and down, hand in\r\nhand, under the great trees, and then they went to the bank.\r\n\r\nIt was a brick building on a corner opposite the common, imposing for\r\nBrampton, and very imposing to Wetherell. It seemed like a tomb as he\r\nentered its door, Cynthia clutching his fingers, and never but once\r\nin his life had he been so near to leaving all hope behind. He waited\r\npatiently by the barred windows until the clerk, who was counting bills,\r\nchose to look up at him.\r\n\r\n“Want to draw money?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe words seemed charged with irony. William Wetherell told him,\r\nfalteringly, his name and business, and he thought the man looked at him\r\ncompassionately.\r\n\r\n“You'll have to see Mr. Worthington,” he said; “he hasn't gone to the\r\nmills yet.”\r\n\r\n“Dudley Worthington?” exclaimed Wetherell.\r\n\r\nThe teller smiled.\r\n\r\n“Yes. He's the president of this bank.”'\r\n\r\nHe opened a door in the partition, and leaving Cynthia dangling her feet\r\nfrom a chair, Wetherell was ushered, not without trepidation, into the\r\ngreat man's office, and found himself at last in the presence of Mr.\r\nIsaac D. Worthington, who used to wander up and down Coniston Water\r\nsearching for a mill site.\r\n\r\nHe sat behind a table covered with green leather, on which papers were\r\nlaid with elaborate neatness, and he wore a double-breasted skirted coat\r\nof black, with braided lapels, a dark purple blanket cravat with a large\r\nred cameo pin. And Mr. Worthington's features harmonized perfectly with\r\nthis costume--those of a successful, ambitious man who followed custom\r\nand convention blindly; clean-shaven, save for reddish chops, blue eyes\r\nof extreme keenness, and thin-upped mouth which had been tightening year\r\nby year as the output of the Worthington Minx increased.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he said sharply, “what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\n“I am William Wetherell, the storekeeper at Coniston.”\r\n\r\n“Not the Wetherell who married Cynthia Ware!”\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. Worthington did not say that. He did not know that Cynthia Ware\r\nwas married, or alive or dead, and--let it be confessed at once--he did\r\nnot care.\r\n\r\nThis is what he did say:--\r\n\r\n“Wetherell--Wetherell. Oh, yes, you've come about that note--the\r\nmortgage on the store at Coniston.” He stared at William Wetherell,\r\ndrummed with his fingers on the table, and smiled slightly. “I am happy\r\nto say that the Brampton Bank does not own this note any longer. If we\r\ndid,--merely as a matter of business, you understand” (he coughed),--“we\r\nshould have had to foreclose.”\r\n\r\n“Don't own the note!” exclaimed Wetherell. “Who does own it?”\r\n\r\n“We sold it a little while ago--since you asked for the extension--to\r\nJethro Bass.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass!” Wetherell's feet seemed to give way under him, and he sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass is a little quixotic--that is a charitable way to put\r\nit--quixotic. He does--strange things like this once in awhile.”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper found no words to answer, but sat mutely staring at him.\r\nMr. Worthington coughed again.\r\n\r\n“You appear to be an educated man. Haven't I heard some story of your\r\ngiving up other pursuits in Boston to come up here for your health?\r\nCertainly I place you now. I confess to a little interest in literature\r\nmyself--in libraries.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his stupefaction at the news he had just received, Wetherell\r\nthought of Mr. Worthington's beaver hat, and of that gentleman's first\r\ninterest in libraries, for Cynthia had told the story to her husband.\r\n\r\n“It is perhaps an open secret,” continued Mr. Worthington, “that in the\r\nnear future I intend to establish a free library in Brampton. I feel it\r\nmy duty to do all I can for the town where I have made my success, and\r\nthere is nothing which induces more to the popular welfare than a good\r\nlibrary.” Whereupon he shot at Wetherell another of his keen looks.\r\n“I do not talk this way ordinarily to my customers, Mr. Wetherell,” he\r\nbegan; “but you interest me, and I am going to tell you something in\r\nconfidence. I am sure it will not be betrayed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said the bewildered storekeeper, who was in no condition to\r\nlisten to confidences.\r\n\r\nHe went quietly to the door, opened it, looked out, and closed it\r\nsoftly. Then he looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Have a care of this man Bass,” he said, in a lower voice. “He began\r\nmany years ago by debauching the liberties of that little town of\r\nConiston, and since then he has gradually debauched the whole state,\r\njudges and all. If I have a case to try” (he spoke now with more\r\nintensity and bitterness), “concerning my mills, or my bank, before I\r\nget through I find that rascal mixed up in it somewhere, and unless I\r\narrange matters with him, I--”\r\n\r\nHe paused abruptly, his eyes going out of the window, pointing with a\r\nlong finger at a grizzled man crossing the street with a yellow and red\r\nhorse blanket thrown over his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“That man, Judge Baker, holding court in this town now, Bass owns body\r\nand soul.”\r\n\r\n“And the horse blanket?” Wetherell queried, irresistibly.\r\n\r\nDudley Worthington did not smile.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice, Mr. Wetherell, and pay off that note somehow.” An odor\r\nof the stable pervaded the room, and a great unkempt grizzled head and\r\nshoulders, horse blanket and all, were stuck into it.\r\n\r\n“Mornin', Dudley,” said the head, “busy?”\r\n\r\n“Come right in, Judge,” answered Mr. Worthington. “Never too busy to see\r\nyou.” The head disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice, Mr. Wetherell.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the storekeeper went into the bank.\r\n\r\nFor some moments he stood dazed by what he had heard, the query ringing\r\nin his head: Why had Jethro Bass bought that note? Did he think that the\r\nstorekeeper at Coniston would be of use to him, politically? The words\r\nChester Perkins had spoken that morning came back to Wetherell as he\r\nstood in the door. And how was he to meet Jethro Bass again with no\r\nmoney to pay even the interest on the note? Then suddenly he missed\r\nCynthia, hurried out, and spied her under the trees on the common so\r\ndeep in conversation with a boy that she did not perceive him until he\r\nspoke to her. The boy looked up, smiling frankly at something Cynthia\r\nhad said to him. He had honest, humorous eyes, and a browned, freckled\r\nface, and was, perhaps, two years older than Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter?” said Wetherell.\r\n\r\nCynthia's face was flushed, and she was plainly vexed about something.\r\n\r\n“I gave her a whistle,” said the boy, with a little laugh of vexation,\r\n“and now she says she won't take it because I owned up I made it for\r\nanother girl.”\r\n\r\nCynthia held it out to him, not deigning to appeal her ease.\r\n\r\n“You must take it back,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But I want you to have it,” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't be right for me to take it when you made it for somebody\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\nAfter all, people with consciences are born, not made. But this was a\r\nfiner distinction that the boy had ever met with in his experience.\r\n\r\n“I didn't know you when I made the whistle,” he objected, puzzled and\r\ndowncast.\r\n\r\n“That doesn't make any difference.”\r\n\r\n“I like you better than the other girl.”\r\n\r\n“You have no right to,” retorted the casuist; “you've known her longer.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn't make any difference,” said the boy; “there are lots of\r\npeople I don't like I have always known. This girl doesn't live in\r\nBrampton, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Where does she live?” demanded Cynthia,--which was a step backward.\r\n\r\n“At the state capital. Her name's Janet Duncan. There, do you believe me\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell had heard of Janet Duncan's father, Alexander Duncan,\r\nwho had the reputation of being the richest man in the state. And he\r\nbegan to wonder who the boy could be.\r\n\r\n“I believe you,” said Cynthia; “but as long as you made it for her, it's\r\nhers. Will you take it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, determinedly.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Cynthia. She laid down the whistle beside him on\r\nthe rail, and went off a little distance and seated herself on a bench.\r\nThe boy laughed.\r\n\r\n“I like that girl,” he remarked; “the rest of 'em take everything I give\r\n'em, and ask for more. She's prettier'n any of 'em, too.”\r\n\r\n“What is your name?” Wetherell asked him, curiously, forgetting his own\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n“Bob Worthington.”\r\n\r\n“Are you the son of Dudley Worthington”\r\n\r\n“Everybody asks me that,” he said; “I'm tired of it. When I grow up,\r\nthey'll have to stop it.”\r\n\r\n“But you should be proud of your father.”\r\n\r\n“I am proud of him, everybody's proud of him, Brampton's proud of\r\nhim--he's proud of himself. That's enough, ain't it?” He eyed Wetherell\r\nsomewhat defiantly, then his glance wandered to Cynthia, and he walked\r\nover to her. He threw himself down on the grass in front of her, and\r\nlay looking up at her solemnly. For a while she continued to stare\r\ninflexibly at the line of market wagons, and then she burst into a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“Thought you wouldn't hold out forever,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“It's because you're so foolish,” said Cynthia, “that's why I laughed.”\r\n Then she grew sober again and held out her hand to him. “Good-by.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“I must go back to my father. I--I think he doesn't feel very well.”\r\n\r\n“Next time I'll make a whistle for you,” he called after her.\r\n\r\n“And give it to somebody else,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nShe had hold of her father's hand by that, but he caught up with her,\r\nvery red in the face.\r\n\r\n“You know that isn't true,” he cried angrily, and taking his way across\r\nBrampton Street, turned, and stood staring after them until they were\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\n“Do you like him, Daddy?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell did not answer. He had other things to think about.\r\n\r\n“Daddy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Does your trouble feel any better?”\r\n\r\n“Some, Cynthia. But you mustn't think about it.”\r\n\r\n“Daddy, why don't you ask Uncle Jethro to help you?”\r\n\r\nAt the name Wetherell started as if he had had a shock.\r\n\r\n“What put him into your head, Cynthia?” he asked sharply. “Why do you\r\ncall him 'Uncle Jethro'?”\r\n\r\n“Because he asked me to. Because he likes me, and I like him.”\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was a riddle he could not solve--one that was best left\r\nalone. They had agreed to walk back the ten miles to Coniston, to save\r\nthe money that dinner at the hotel would cost. And so they started,\r\nCynthia flitting hither and thither along the roadside, picking the\r\nstately purple iris flowers in the marshy places, while Wetherell\r\npondered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWhen William Wetherell and Cynthia had reached the last turn in the\r\nroad in Northcutt's woods, quarter of a mile from Coniston, they met the\r\nnasal Mr. Samuel Price driving silently in the other direction. The\r\nword “silently” is used deliberately, because to Mr. Price appertained\r\na certain ghostlike quality of flitting, and to Mr. Price's horse and\r\nwagon likewise. He drew up for a brief moment when he saw Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn't hurry back if I was you, Will.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\nMr. Price leaned out of the wagon.\r\n\r\n“Bije has come over from Clovelly to spy around a little mite.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident from Mr. Price's manner that he regarded the storekeeper\r\nas a member of the reform party.\r\n\r\n“What did he say, Daddy?” asked Cynthia, as Wetherell stood staring\r\nafter the flitting buggy in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“I haven't the faintest idea, Cynthia,” answered her father, and they\r\nwalked on.\r\n\r\n“Don't you know who 'Bije' is?\r\n\r\n“No,” said her father, “and I don't care.”\r\n\r\nIt was almost criminal ignorance for a man who lived in that part of\r\nthe country not to know Bijah Bixby of Clovelly, who was paying a\r\nlittle social visit to Coniston that day on his way home from the state\r\ncapital,--tending, as it were, Jethro's flock. Still, Wetherell must be\r\nexcused because he was an impractical literary man with troubles of\r\nhis own. But how shall we chronicle Bijah's rank and precedence in\r\nthe Jethro army, in which there are neither shoulder-straps nor annual\r\nregisters? To designate him as the Chamberlain of that hill Rajah, the\r\nHonorable Heth Sutton, would not be far out of the way. The Honorable\r\nHeth, whom we all know and whom we shall see presently, is the man of\r\nsubstance and of broad acres in Clovelly: Bijah merely owns certain\r\nmortgages in that town, but he had created the Honorable Heth\r\n(politically) as surely as certain prime ministers we could name have\r\ncreated their sovereigns. The Honorable Heth was Bijah's creation, and a\r\ngrand creation he was, as no one will doubt when they see him.\r\n\r\nBijah--as he will not hesitate to tell you--took Heth down in his pocket\r\nto the Legislature, and has more than once delivered him, in certain\r\nblocks of five and ten, and four and twenty, for certain considerations.\r\nThe ancient Song of Sixpence applies to Bijah, but his pocket was\r\ngenerally full of proxies instead of rye, and the Honorable Heth was\r\nfrequently one of the four and twenty blackbirds. In short, Bijah was\r\nthe working bee, and the Honorable Heth the ornamental drone.\r\n\r\nI do not know why I have dwelt so long on such a minor character as\r\nBijah, except that the man fascinates me. Of all the lieutenants in the\r\nstate, his manners bore the closest resemblance to those of Jethro Bass.\r\nWhen he walked behind Jethro in the corridors of the Pelican, kicking up\r\nhis heels behind, he might have been taken for Jethro's shadow. He was\r\nof a good height and size, smooth-shaven, with little eyes that kindled,\r\nand his mouth moved not at all when he spoke: unlike Jethro, he “used”\r\n tobacco.\r\n\r\nWhen Bijah had driven into Coniston village and hitched his wagon to\r\nthe rail, he went direct to the store. Chester Perkins and others were\r\nwatching him with various emotions from the stoop, and Bijah took a\r\nseat in the midst of them, characteristically engaging in conversation\r\nwithout the usual conventional forms of greeting, as if he had been\r\nthere all day.\r\n\r\n“H-how much did you git for your wool, Chester--h-how much?”\r\n\r\n“Guess you hain't here to talk about wool, Bije,” said Chester, red with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n“Kind of neglectin' the farm lately, I hear,” observed Bijah.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass sent you up to find out how much I was neglectin' it,”\r\n retorted Chester, throwing all caution to the winds.\r\n\r\n“Thinkin' of upsettin' Jethro, be you? Thinkin' of upsettin' Jethro?”\r\n remarked Bije, in a genial tone.\r\n\r\n“Folks in Clovelly hain't got nothin' to do with it, if I am,” said\r\nChester.\r\n\r\n“Leetle early for campaignin', Chester, leetle early.”\r\n\r\n“We do our campaignin' when we're a mind to.”\r\n\r\nBijah looked around.\r\n\r\n“Well, that's funny. I could have took oath I seed Rias Richardson\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence.\r\n\r\n“And Sam Price,” continued Bijah, in pretended astonishment, “wahn't he\r\nsettin' on the edge of the stoop when I drove up?”\r\n\r\nAnother silence, broken only by the enraged breathing of Chester, who\r\nwas unable to retort. Moses Hatch laughed. The discreet departure of\r\nthese gentlemen certainly had its comical side.\r\n\r\n“Rias as indoostrious as ever, Mose?” inquired Bijah.\r\n\r\n“He has his busy times,” said Mose, grinning broadly.\r\n\r\n“See you've got the boys with their backs up, Chester,” said Bijah.\r\n\r\n“Some of us are sick of tyranny,” cried Chester; “you kin tell that to\r\nJethro Bass when you go back, if he's got time to listen to you buyin'\r\nand sellin' out of railroads.”\r\n\r\n“Hear Jethro's got the Grand Gulf Road in his pocket to do as he's a\r\nmind to with,” said Moses, with a view to drawing Bijah out. But the\r\nremark had exactly the opposite effect, Bijah screwing up his face into\r\nan expression of extraordinary secrecy and cunning.\r\n\r\n“How much did you git out of it, Bije?” demanded Chester.\r\n\r\n“Hain't looked through my clothes yet,” said Bijah, his face screwed\r\nup tighter than ever. “N-never look through my clothes till I git home,\r\nChester, it hain't safe.”\r\n\r\nIt has become painfully evident that Mr. Bixby is that rare type of man\r\nwho can sit down under the enemy's ramparts and smoke him out. It was a\r\nrule of Jethro's code either to make an effective departure or else to\r\nremain and compel the other man to make an ineffective departure. Lem\r\nHallowell might have coped with him; but the stage was late, and after\r\nsome scratching of heads and delving for effectual banter (through which\r\nMr. Bixby sat genial and unconcerned), Chester's followers took their\r\nleave, each choosing his own pretext.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime William Wetherell had entered the store by the back\r\ndoor--unperceived, as he hoped. He had a vehement desire to be left in\r\npeace, and to avoid politics and political discussions forever--vain\r\ndesire for the storekeeper of Coniston. Mr. Wetherell entered the store,\r\nand to take his mind from his troubles, he picked up a copy of Byron:\r\ngradually the conversation on the stoop died away, and just as he\r\nwas beginning to congratulate himself and enjoy the book, he had an\r\nunpleasant sensation of some one approaching him measuredly. Wetherell\r\ndid not move; indeed, he felt that he could not--he was as though\r\ncharmed to the spot. He could have cried aloud, but the store was empty,\r\nand there was no one to hear him. Mr. Bixby did not speak until he was\r\nwithin a foot of his victim's ear. His voice was very nasal, too.\r\n\r\n“Wetherell, hain't it?”\r\n\r\nThe victim nodded helplessly.\r\n\r\n“Want to see you a minute.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Where can we talk private?” asked Mr. Bixby, looking around.\r\n\r\n“There's no one here,” Wetherell answered. “What do you wish to say?”\r\n\r\n“If the boys was to see me speakin' to you, they might git\r\nsuspicious--you understand,” he confided, his manner conveying a hint\r\nthat they shared some common policy.\r\n\r\n“I don't meddle with politics,” said Wetherell, desperately.\r\n\r\n“Exactly!” answered Bijah, coming even closer. “I knowed you was a\r\nlevel-headed man, moment I set eyes on you. Made up my mind I'd have a\r\nlittle talk in private with you--you understand. The boys hain't got no\r\nreason to suspicion you care anything about politics, have they?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever.”\r\n\r\n“You don't pay no attention to what they say?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“You hear it?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I can't help it.”\r\n\r\n“Ex'actly! You hear it.”\r\n\r\n“I told you I couldn't help it.”\r\n\r\n“Want you should vote right when the time comes,” said Bijah. “D-don't\r\nwant to see such an intelligent man go wrong an' be sorry for it--you\r\nunderstand. Chester Perkins is hare-brained. Jethro Bass runs things in\r\nthis state.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bixby--”\r\n\r\n“You understand,” said Bijah, screwing up his face. “Guess your watch\r\nis a-comin' out.” He tucked it back caressingly, and started for the\r\ndoor--the back door. Involuntarily Wetherell put his hand to his pocket,\r\nfelt something crackle under it, and drew the something out. To his\r\namazement it was a ten-dollar bill.\r\n\r\n“Here!” he cried so sharply in his fright that Mr. Bixby, turned around.\r\nWetherell ran after him. “Take this back!”\r\n\r\n“Guess you got me,” said Bijah. “W-what is it?”\r\n\r\n“This money is yours,” cried Wetherell, so loudly that Bijah started and\r\nglanced at the front of the store.\r\n\r\n“Guess you made some mistake,” he said, staring at the storekeeper with\r\nsuch amazing innocence that he began to doubt his senses, and clutched\r\nthe bill to see if it was real.\r\n\r\n“But I had no money in my pocket,” said Wetherell, perplexedly. And\r\nthen, gaining, indignation, “Take this to the man who sent you, and give\r\nit back to him.”\r\n\r\nBut Bijah merely whispered caressingly in his ear, “Nobody sent me,--you\r\nunderstand,--nobody sent me,” and was gone. Wetherell stood for a\r\nmoment, dazed by the man's audacity, and then, hurrying to the front\r\nstoop, the money still in his hand, he perceived Mr. Bixby in the sunlit\r\nroad walking, Jethro-fashion, toward Ephraim Prescott's harness shop.\r\n\r\n“Why, Daddy,” said Cynthia, coming in from the garden, “where did you\r\nget all that money? Your troubles must feel better.”\r\n\r\n“It is not mine,” said Wetherell, starting. And then, quivering with\r\nanger and mortification, he sank down on the stoop to debate what he\r\nshould do.\r\n\r\n“Is it somebody else's?” asked the child, presently.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then why don't you give it back to them, Daddy?”\r\n\r\nHow was Wetherell to know, in his fright, that Mr. Bixby had for once\r\nindulged in an overabundance of zeal in Jethro's behalf? He went to the\r\ndoor, laughter came to him across the green from the harness shop, and\r\nhis eye following the sound, fastened on Bijah seated comfortably in the\r\nmidst of the group there. Bitterly the storekeeper comprehended that,\r\nhad he possessed courage, he would have marched straight after Mr. Bixby\r\nand confronted him before them all with the charge of bribery. The blood\r\nthrobbed in his temples, and yet he sat there, trembling, despising\r\nhimself, repeating that he might have had the courage if Jethro Bass\r\nhad not bought the mortgage. The fear of the man had entered the\r\nstorekeeper's soul.\r\n\r\n“Does it belong to that man over there?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I'll take it to him, Daddy,” and she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n“Not now,” Wetherell answered nervously, glancing at the group. He went\r\ninto the store, addressed an envelope to “Mr. Bijah Bixby of Clovelly,”\r\n and gave it to Cynthia. “When he comes back for his wagon, hand it to\r\nhim,” he said, feeling that he would rather, at that moment, face the\r\ndevil himself than Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Cynthia gave Mr. Bixby the envelope as he unhitched\r\nhis horse; and so deftly did Bijah slip it into his pocket, that he must\r\ncertainly have misjudged its contents. None of the loungers at Ephraim's\r\nremarked the transaction.\r\n\r\nIf Jethro had indeed instructed Bijah to look after his flock at\r\nConiston, it was an ill-conditioned move, and some of the flock resented\r\nit when they were quite sure that Bijah was climbing the notch road\r\ntoward Clovelly. The discussion (from which the storekeeper was\r\nprovidentially omitted) was in full swing when the stage arrived, and\r\nLem Hallowell's voice silenced the uproar. It was Lem's boast that he\r\nnever had been and never would be a politician.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you folks quit railin' against Jethro and do somethin'?” he\r\nsaid. “Bije turns up here, and you all scatter like a flock of crows.\r\nI'm tired of makin' complaints about that Brampton road, and to-day the\r\nhull side of it give way, and put me in the ditch. Sure as the sun rises\r\nto-morrow, I'm goin' to make trouble for Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“What be you a-goin' to do, Lem?”\r\n\r\n“Indict the town,” replied Lem, vigorously. “Who is the town? Jethro,\r\nhain't he? Who has charge of the highways? Jethro Bass, Chairman of the\r\nSelectmen. I've spoke to him, time and agin, about that piece, and\r\nhe hain't done nothin'. To-night I go to Harwich and git the court to\r\napp'int an agent to repair that road, and the town'll hev to pay the\r\nbill.”\r\n\r\nThe boldness of Lem's intention for the moment took away their breaths,\r\nand then the awe-stricken hush which followed his declaration was broken\r\nby the sound of Chester's fist hammering on the counter.\r\n\r\n“That's the sperrit,” he cried; “I'll go along with you, Lem.”\r\n\r\n“No, you won't,” said Lem, “you'll stay right whar you be.”\r\n\r\n“Chester wants to git credit for the move,” suggested Sam Price, slyly.\r\n\r\n“It's a lie, Sam Price,” shouted Chester. “What made you sneak off when\r\nBije Bixby come?”\r\n\r\n“Didn't sneak off,” retorted Sam, indignantly, through his nose; “forgot\r\nthem eggs I left to home.”\r\n\r\n“Sam,” said Lem, with a wink at Moses Hatch, “you hitch up your hoss and\r\nfetch me over to Harwich to git that indictment. Might git a chance to\r\nsee that lady.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, now, I wish I could, Lem, but my hoss is stun lame.”\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter, during which Sam tried to look\r\nunconcerned.\r\n\r\n“Mebbe Rias'll take me over,” said Lem, soberly. “You hitch up, Rias?”\r\n\r\n“He's gone,” said Joe Northcutt, “slid out the door when you was\r\nspeakin' to Sam.”\r\n\r\n“Hain't none of you folks got spunk enough to carry me over to see the\r\njedge?” demanded Lem; “my horses ain't fit to travel to-night.” Another\r\nsilence followed, and Lem laughed contemptuously but good-naturedly, and\r\nturned on his heel. “Guess I'll walk, then,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You kin have my white hoss, Lem,” said Moses Hatch.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Lem; “I'll come round and hitch up soon's I git my\r\nsupper.”\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when Cynthia and her father and Millicent Skinner--who\r\ncondescended to assist in the work and cooking of Mr. Wetherell's\r\nhousehold--were seated at supper in the little kitchen behind the store,\r\nthe head and shoulders of the stage-driver were thrust in at the window,\r\nhis face shining from its evening application of soap and water. He was\r\nmaking eyes at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Want to go to Harwich, Will?” he asked.\r\n\r\nWilliam set his cup down quickly.\r\n\r\n“You hain't afeard, be you?” he continued. “Most folks that hasn't went\r\nWest or died is afeard of Jethro Bass.”\r\n\r\n“Daddy isn't afraid of him, and I'm not,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“That's right, Cynthy,” said Lem, leaning over and giving a tug to the\r\npigtail that hung down her back; “there hain't nothin' to be afeard of.”\r\n\r\n“I like him,” said Cynthia; “he's very good to me.”\r\n\r\n“You stick to him, Cynthy,” said the stage driver.\r\n\r\n“Ready, Will?”\r\n\r\nIt may readily be surmised that Mr. Wetherell did not particularly wish\r\nto make this excursion, the avowed object of which was to get Mr. Bass\r\ninto trouble. But he went, and presently he found himself jogging along\r\non the mountain road to Harwich. From the crest of Town's End ridge they\r\nlooked upon the western peaks tossing beneath a golden sky. The spell of\r\nthe evening's beauty seemed to have fallen on them both, and for a long\r\ntime Lem spoke not a word, and nodded smilingly but absently to the\r\ngreetings that came from the farm doorways.\r\n\r\n“Will,” he said at last, “you acted sensible. There's no mite of use of\r\nyour gettin' mixed up in politics. You're too good for 'em.”\r\n\r\n“Too good!” exclaimed the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n“You're eddicated,” Lem replied, with a tactful attempt to cover up a\r\ndeficiency; “you're a gentleman, ef you do keep store.”\r\n\r\nLemuel apparently thought that gentlemen and politics were\r\ncontradictions. He began to whistle, while Wetherell sat and wondered\r\nthat any one could be so care-free on such a mission. The day faded, and\r\nwent out, and the lights of Harwich twinkled in the valley. Wetherell\r\nwas almost tempted to mention his trouble to this man, as he had been to\r\nEphraim: the fear that each might think he wished to borrow money held\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\n“Jethro's all right,” Lem remarked, “but if he neglects the road, he's\r\ngot to stand for it, same's any other. I writ him twice to the capital,\r\nand give him fair warning afore he went. He knows I hain't doin' of it\r\nfor politics. I've often thought,” Lem continued, “that ef some smart,\r\ngood woman could have got hold of him when he was young, it would have\r\nmade a big difference. What's the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Have you room enough?”\r\n\r\n“I guess I've got the hull seat,” said Lem. “As I was sayin', if some\r\nable woman had married Jethro and made him look at things a little mite\r\ndifferent, he would have b'en a big man. He has all the earmarks. Why,\r\nwhen he comes back to Coniston, them fellers'll hunt their holes like\r\nrabbits, mark my words.”\r\n\r\n“You don't think--”\r\n\r\n“Don't think what?”\r\n\r\n“I understand he holds the mortgages of some of them,” said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn't blame him a great deal ef he did git tired and sell Chester\r\nout soon. This thing happens regular as leap year.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass doesn't seem to frighten you,” said the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lem, “I hain't afeard of him, that's so. For the life of\r\nme, I can't help likin' him, though he does things that I wouldn't do\r\nfor all the power in Christendom. Here's Jedge Parkinson's house.”\r\n\r\nWetherell remained in the wagon while Lemuel went in to transact his\r\nbusiness. The judge's house, outlined in the starlight, was a modest\r\ndwelling with a little porch and clambering vines, set back in its own\r\ngarden behind a picket fence. Presently, from the direction of the\r\nlines of light in the shutters, came the sound of voices, Lem's deep\r\nand insistent, and another, pitched in a high nasal key, deprecatory and\r\nprotesting. There was still another, a harsh one that growled something\r\nunintelligible, and Wetherell guessed, from the fragments which he\r\nheard, that the judge before sitting down to his duty was trying to\r\ndissuade the stage driver from a step that was foolhardy. He guessed\r\nlikewise that Lem was not to be dissuaded. At length a silence followed,\r\nthen the door swung open, and three figures came down the illuminated\r\npath.\r\n\r\n“Like to make you acquainted with Jedge Abner Parkinson, Mr. Wetherell,\r\nand Jim Irving. Jim's the sheriff of Truro County, and I guess the\r\njedge don't need any recommendation as a lawyer from me. You won't mind\r\nstayin' awhile with the jedge while Jim and I go down town with the\r\nteam? You're both literary folks.”\r\n\r\nWetherell followed the judge into the house. He was sallow, tall\r\nand spare and stooping, clean-shaven, with a hooked nose and bright\r\neyes--the face of an able and adroit man, and he wore the long black\r\ncoat of the politician-lawyer. The room was filled with books, and from\r\nthese Judge Parkinson immediately took his cue, probably through a fear\r\nthat Wetherell might begin on the subject of Lemuel's errand. However,\r\nit instantly became plain that the judge was a true book lover, and\r\ndespite the fact that Lem's visit had disturbed him not a little, he\r\nsoon grew animated in a discussion on the merits of Sir Walter Scott,\r\npaced the room, pitched his nasal voice higher and higher, covered his\r\ntable with volumes of that author to illustrate his meaning. Neither\r\nof them heard a knock, and they both stared dumfounded at the man who\r\nfilled the doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was Jethro Bass!\r\n\r\nHe entered the room with characteristic unconcern, as if he had just\r\nleft it on a trivial errand, and without a “How do you do?” or a “Good\r\nevening,” parted his coat tails, and sat down in the judge's armchair.\r\nThe judge dropped the volume of Scott on the desk, and as for Wetherell,\r\nhe realized for once the full meaning of the biblical expression of\r\na man's tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth; the gleam of one of\r\nJethro's brass buttons caught his eye and held it fascinated.\r\n\r\n“Literary talk, Judge?” said Jethro. “D-don't mind me--go on.”\r\n\r\n“Thought you were at the capital,” said the judge, reclaiming some of\r\nhis self-possession.\r\n\r\n“Good many folks thought so,” answered Jethro, “g-good many folks.”\r\n\r\nThere was no conceivable answer to this, so the judge sat down with an\r\naffectation of ease. He was a man on whom dignity lay heavily, and\r\nwas not a little ruffled because Wetherell had been a witness of\r\nhis discomfiture. He leaned back in his chair, then leaned forward,\r\nstretching his neck and clearing his throat, a position in which he bore\r\na ludicrous resemblance to a turkey gobbler.\r\n\r\n“Most through the Legislature?” inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n“'Bout as common,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, and, forgetful for the moment of his own\r\npredicament, Wetherell found a fearful fascination in watching the\r\ncontortions of the victim whose punishment was to precede his. It had\r\nbeen one of the delights of Louis XI to contemplate the movements of a\r\ncertain churchman whom he had had put in a cage, and some inkling of the\r\npleasure to be derived from this pastime of tyrants dawned on Wetherell.\r\nPerhaps the judge, too, thought of this as he looked at “Quentin\r\nDurward” on the table.\r\n\r\n“I was just sayin' to Lem Hallowell,” began the judge, at last, “that I\r\nthought he was a little mite hasty--”\r\n\r\n“Er--indicted us, Judge?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe judge and Wetherell heard the question with different emotions. Mr.\r\nParkinson did not seem astonished at the miracle which had put Jethro in\r\npossession of this information, but heaved a long sigh of relief, as a\r\nman will when the worst has at length arrived.\r\n\r\n“I had to, Jethro--couldn't help it. I tried to get Hallowell to wait\r\ntill you come back and talk it over friendly, but he wouldn't listen;\r\nsaid the road was dangerous, and that he'd spoken about it too often. He\r\nsaid he hadn't anything against you.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't come in to complain,” said Jethro, “didn't come in to complain.\r\nRoad is out of repair. W-what's the next move?”\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry, Jethro--I swan I'm sorry.” He cleared his throat. “Well,” he\r\ncontinued in his judicial manner, “the court has got to appoint an agent\r\nto repair that road, the agent will present the bill, and the town will\r\nhave to pay the bill--whatever it is. It's too bad, Jethro, that you\r\nhave allowed this to be done.”\r\n\r\n“You say you've got to app'int an agent?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--I'm sorry--”\r\n\r\n“Have you app'inted one?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“G-got any candidates?”\r\n\r\nThe judge scratched his head.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don't know as I have.”\r\n\r\n“Well, have you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the judge.\r\n\r\n“A-any legal objection to my bein' app'inted?” asked Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe judge looked at him and gasped. But the look was an involuntary\r\ntribute of admiration.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said hesitatingly, “I don't know as there is, Jethro. No,\r\nthere's no legal objection to it.”\r\n\r\n“A-any other kind of objection?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe judge appeared to reflect.\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” he said at last, “I don't know as there is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, is there?” said Jethro, again.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the judge, with the finality of a decision. A smile seemed to\r\nbe pulling at the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm a candidate,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Do you tell me, Jethro, that you want me to appoint you agent to fix\r\nthat road?”\r\n\r\n“I-I'm a candidate.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the judge, rising, “I'll do it.”\r\n\r\n“When?” said Jethro, sitting still.\r\n\r\n“I'll send the papers over to you within two or three days.\r\n\r\n“O-ought to be done right away, Judge. Road's in bad shape.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll send the papers over to you to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“How long--would it take to make out that app'intment--how long?”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't take but a little while.”\r\n\r\n“I'll wait,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to take the appointment along with you to-night?” asked the\r\njudge, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“G-guess that's about it.”\r\n\r\nWithout a word the judge went over to his table, and for a while the\r\nsilence was broken only by the scratching of his pen.\r\n\r\n“Er--interested in roads,--Will,--interested in roads?”\r\n\r\nThe judge stopped writing to listen, since it was now the turn of the\r\nother victim.\r\n\r\n“Not particularly,” answered Mr. Wetherell, whose throat was dry.\r\n\r\n“C-come over for the drive--c-come over for the drive?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the storekeeper, rather faintly.\r\n\r\n“H-how's Cynthy?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper was too astonished to answer. At that moment there was\r\na heavy step in the doorway, and Lem Hallowell entered the room. He took\r\none long look at Jethro and bent over and slapped his hand on his knee,\r\nand burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“So here you be!” he cried. “By Godfrey! ef you don't beat all outdoors,\r\nJethro. Wal, I got ahead of ye for once, but you can't say I didn't warn\r\nye. Come purty nigh bustin' the stage on that road today, and now I'm\r\na-goin' to hev an agent app'inted.”\r\n\r\n“W-who's the agent?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“We'll git one. Might app'int Will, there, only he don't seem to want to\r\nget mixed up in it.”\r\n\r\n“There's the agent,” cried the judge, holding out the appointment to\r\nJethro.\r\n\r\n“Wh-what?” ejaculated Lem.\r\n\r\nJethro took the appointment, and put it in his cowhide wallet.\r\n\r\n“Be you the agent?” demanded the amazed stage driver.\r\n\r\n“C-callate to be,” said Jethro, and without a smile or another word to\r\nany one he walked out into the night, and after various exclamations of\r\nastonishment and admiration, the stage driver followed.\r\n\r\nNo one, indeed, could have enjoyed this unexpected coup of Jethro's more\r\nthan Lem himself, and many times on their drive homeward he burst into\r\nloud and unexpected fits of laughter at the sublime conception of the\r\nChairman of the Selectmen being himself appointed road agent.\r\n\r\n“Will,” said he, “don't you tell this to a soul. We'll have some fun out\r\nof some of the boys to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper promised, but he had an unpleasant presentiment that he\r\nhimself might be one of the boys in question.\r\n\r\n“How do you suppose Jethro Bass knew you were going to indict the town?”\r\n he asked of the stage driver.\r\n\r\nLem burst into fresh peals of laughter; but this was something which he\r\ndid not attempt to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was a certain spinster whom Sam Price had been\r\ntrying to make up his mind to marry for ten years or more, and it was\r\nthat gentleman's habit to spend at least one day in the month in Harwich\r\nfor the purpose of paying his respects. In spite of the fact that his\r\nhorse had been “stun lame” the night before, Mr. Price was able to start\r\nfor Harwich, via Brampton, very early the next morning. He was driving\r\nalong through Northcutt's woods with one leg hanging over the wheel,\r\nhumming through his nose what we may suppose to have been a love-ditty,\r\nand letting his imagination run riot about the lady in question, when he\r\nnearly fell out of his wagon. The cause of this was the sight of fat Tom\r\ncoming around a corner, with Jethro Bass behind him. Lem Hallowell\r\nand the storekeeper had kept their secret so well that Sam, if he was\r\nthinking about Jethro at all, believed him at that moment to be seated\r\nin the Throne Room at the Pelican House, in the capital.\r\n\r\nMr. Price, however, was one of an adaptable nature, and by the time he\r\nhad pulled up beside Jethro he had recovered sufficiently to make a few\r\nremarks on farming subjects, and finally to express a polite surprise at\r\nJethro's return.\r\n\r\n“But you come a little mite late, hain't you, Jethro?” he asked finally,\r\nwith all of the indifference he could assume.\r\n\r\n“H-how's that, Sam--how's that?”\r\n\r\n“It's too bad,--I swan it is,--but Lem Hallowell rode over to Harwich\r\nlast night and indicted the town for that piece of road by the Four\r\nCorners. Took Will Wetherell along with him.”\r\n\r\n“D-don't say so!” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I callate he done it,” responded Sam, pulling a long face. “The\r\ncourt'll hev to send an agent to do the job, and I guess you'll hev to\r\nfoot the bill, Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“C-court'll hev to app'int an agent?”\r\n\r\n“I callate.”\r\n\r\n“Er--you a candidate--Sam--you a candidate?”\r\n\r\n“Don't know but what I be,” answered the usually wary Mr. Price.\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to Harwich--hain't you?”\r\n\r\n“Mebbe I be, and mebbe I hain't,” said Sam, not able to repress a\r\nself-conscious snicker.\r\n\r\n“M-might as well be you as anybody, Sam,” said Jethro, as he drove on.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange that the idea, thus planted, should grow in Mr.\r\nPrice's favor as he proceeded. He had been surprised at Jethro's\r\ncomplaisance, and he wondered whether, after all, he had done well\r\nto help Chester stir people up at this time. When he reached Harwich,\r\ninstead of presenting himself promptly at the spinster's house, he\r\nwent first to the office of Judge Parkinson, as became a prudent man of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no need to go into the details of Mr. Price's\r\ndiscomfiture on the occasion of this interview. The judge was by nature\r\nof a sour disposition, but he haw-hawed so loudly as he explained to Mr.\r\nPrice the identity of the road agent that the judge of probate in the\r\nnext office thought his colleague had gone mad. Afterward Mr. Price\r\nstood for some time in the entry, where no one could see him, scratching\r\nhis head and repeating his favorite exclamation, “I want to know!” It\r\nhas been ascertained that he omitted to pay his respects to the spinster\r\non that day.\r\n\r\nCyamon Johnson carried the story back to Coniston, where it had the\r\neffect of eliminating Mr. Price from local politics for some time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThat same morning Chester Perkins was seen by many driving wildly about\r\nfrom farm to farm, supposedly haranguing his supporters to make a\r\nfinal stand against the tyrant, but by noon it was observed by those\r\nnaturalists who were watching him that his activity had ceased. Chester\r\narrived at dinner time at Joe Northcutt's, whose land bordered on the\r\npiece of road which had caused so much trouble, and Joe and half a dozen\r\nothers had been at work there all morning under the road agent whom\r\nJudge Parkinson had appointed. Now Mrs. Northcutt was Chester's sister,\r\na woman who in addition to other qualities possessed the only sense\r\nof humor in the family. She ushered the unsuspecting Chester into the\r\nkitchen, and there, seated beside Joe and sipping a saucer of very hot\r\ncoffee, was Jethro Bass himself. Chester halted in the doorway, his face\r\nbrick-red, words utterly failing him, while Joe sat horror-stricken,\r\nholding aloft on his fork a smoking potato. Jethro continued to sip his\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n“B-busy times, Chester,” he said, “b-busy times.”\r\n\r\nChester choked. Where were the burning words of denunciation which came\r\nso easily to his tongue on other occasions? It is difficult to denounce\r\na man who insists upon drinking coffee.\r\n\r\n“Set right down, Chester,” said Mrs. Northcutt, behind him.\r\n\r\nChester sat down, and to this day he cannot account for that action.\r\nOnce seated, habit asserted itself; and he attacked the boiled dinner\r\nwith a ferocity which should have been exercised against Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I suppose the stores down to the capital is finer than ever, Mr. Bass,”\r\n remarked Mrs. Northcutt.\r\n\r\n“So-so, Mis' Northcutt, so-so.”\r\n\r\n“I was there ten years ago,” remarked Mrs. Northcutt, with a sigh of\r\nreminiscence, “and I never see such fine silks and bonnets in my life.\r\nNow I've often wanted to ask you, did you buy that bonnet with the\r\ntrembly jet things for Mis' Bass?”\r\n\r\n“That bonnet come out full better'n I expected,” answered Jethro,\r\nmodestly.\r\n\r\n“You have got taste in wimmin's fixin's, Mr. Bass. Strange? Now I\r\nwouldn't let Joe choose my things for worlds.”\r\n\r\nSo the dinner progressed, Joe with his eyes on his plate, Chester\r\nsilent, but bursting with anger and resentment, until at last Jethro\r\npushed back his chair, and said good day to Mrs. Northcutt and walked\r\nout. Chester got up instantly and went after him, and Joe, full of\r\nforebodings, followed his brother-in-law! Jethro was standing calmly on\r\nthe grass plot, whittling a toothpick. Chester stared at him a moment,\r\nand then strode off toward the barn, unhitched his horse and jumped in\r\nhis wagon. Something prompted him to take another look at Jethro, who\r\nwas still whittling.\r\n\r\n“C-carry me down to the road, Chester--c-carry me down to the road?”\r\n said Jethro.\r\n\r\nJoe Northcutt's knees gave way under him, and he sat down on a sugar\r\nkettle. Chester tightened up his reins so suddenly that his horse\r\nreared, while Jethro calmly climbed into the seat beside him and they\r\ndrove off. It was some time before Joe had recovered sufficiently to\r\narise and repair to the scene of operations on the road.\r\n\r\nIt was Joe who brought the astounding news to the store that evening.\r\nChester was Jethro's own candidate for senior Selectman! Jethro himself\r\nhad said so, that he would be happy to abdicate in Chester's favor, and\r\nmake it unanimous--Chester having been a candidate so many times, and\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n“Whar's Chester?” said Lem Hallowell.\r\n\r\nJoe pulled a long face.\r\n\r\n“Just come from his house, and he hain't done a lick of work sence noon\r\ntime. Jest sets in a corner--won't talk, won't eat--jest sets thar.”\r\n\r\nLem sat down on the counter and laughed until he was forced to brush\r\nthe tears from his cheeks at the idea of Chester Perkins being Jethro's\r\ncandidate. Where was reform now? If Chester were elected, it would be in\r\nthe eyes of the world as Jethro's man. No wonder he sat in a corner and\r\nrefused to eat.\r\n\r\n“Guess you'll ketch it next, Will, for goin' over to Harwich with Lem,”\r\n Joe remarked playfully to the storekeeper, as he departed.\r\n\r\nThese various occurrences certainly did not tend to allay the uneasiness\r\nof Mr. Wetherell. The next afternoon, at a time when a slack trade\r\nwas slackest, he had taken his chair out under the apple tree and\r\nwas sitting with that same volume of Byron in his lap--but he was\r\nnot reading. The humorous aspects of the doings of Mr. Bass did not\r\nparticularly appeal to him now; and he was, in truth, beginning to hate\r\nthis man whom the fates had so persistently intruded into his life.\r\nWilliam Wetherell was not, it may have been gathered, what may be called\r\nvindictive. He was a sensitive, conscientious person whose life should\r\nhave been in the vale; and yet at that moment he had a fierce desire to\r\nconfront Jethro Bass and--and destroy him. Yes, he felt equal to that.\r\n\r\nShocks are not very beneficial to sensitive natures. William Wetherell\r\nlooked up, and there was Jethro Bass on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n“G-great resource--readin'--great resource,” he remarked.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Jethro snuffed out utterly that passion to destroy,\r\nand another sensation took its place--a sensation which made it very\r\ndifficult for William Wetherell to speak, but he managed to reply that\r\nreading had been a great resource to him. Jethro had a parcel in his\r\nhand, and he laid it down on the step beside him; and he seemed, for\r\nonce in his life, to be in a mood for conversation.\r\n\r\n“It's hard for me to read a book,” he observed. “I own to it--it's a\r\nlittle mite hard. H-hev to kind of spell it out in places. Hain't had\r\nmuch time for readin'. But it's kind of pleasant to l'arn what other\r\nfolks has done in the world by pickin' up a book. T-takes your mind off\r\nthings--don't it?”\r\n\r\nWetherell felt like saying that his reading had not been able to do that\r\nlately. Then he made the plunge, and shuddered as he made it.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass--I--I have been waiting to speak to you about that mortgage.”\r\n\r\n“Er--yes,” he answered, without moving his head, “er--about the\r\nmortgage.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington told me that you had bought it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did--yes, I did.”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid you will have to foreclose,” said Wetherell; “I cannot\r\nreasonably ask you to defer the payments any longer.”\r\n\r\n“If I foreclose it, what will you do?” he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nThere was but one answer--Wetherell would have to go back to the city\r\nand face the consequences. He had not the strength to earn his bread on\r\na farm.\r\n\r\n“If I'd a b'en in any hurry for the money--g-guess I'd a notified you,”\r\n said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I think you had better foreclose, Mr. Bass,” Wetherell answered; “I\r\ncan't hold out any hopes to you that it will ever be possible for me to\r\npay it off. It's only fair to tell you that.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, with what seemed a suspicion of a smile, “I don't know\r\nbut what that's about as honest an answer as I ever got.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you do it?” Wetherell cried, suddenly goaded by another fear;\r\n“why did you buy that mortgage?”\r\n\r\nBut this did not shake his composure.\r\n\r\n“H-have a little habit of collectin' 'em,” he answered, “same as you do\r\nbooks. G-guess some of 'em hain't as valuable.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was beginning to think that Jethro knew something also\r\nof such refinements of cruelty as were practised by Caligula. He\r\ndrew forth his cowhide wallet and produced from it a folded piece of\r\nnewspaper which must, Wetherell felt sure, contain the mortgage in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“There's one power I always wished I had,” he observed, “the power\r\nto make folks see some things as I see 'em. I was acrost the Water\r\nto-night, on my hill farm, when the sun set, and the sky up thar above\r\nthe mountain was all golden bars, and the river all a-flamin' purple,\r\njust as if it had been dyed by some of them Greek gods you're readin'\r\nabout. Now if I could put them things on paper, I wouldn't care a\r\nhaycock to be President. No, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper's amazement as he listened to this speech may be\r\nimagined. Was this Jethro Bass? If so, here was a side of him the\r\nexistence of which no one suspected. Wetherell forgot the matter in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you put that on paper?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJethro smiled, and made a deprecating motion with his thumb.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes when I hain't busy, I drop into the state library at the\r\ncapital and enjoy myself. It's like goin' to another world without\r\nany folks to bother you. Er--er--there's books I'd like to talk to you\r\nabout--sometime.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought you told me you didn't read much, Mr. Bass?”\r\n\r\nHe made no direct reply, but unfolded the newspaper in his hand, and\r\nthen Wetherell saw that it was only a clipping.\r\n\r\n“H-happened to run across this in a newspaper--if this hain't this\r\ncounty, I wahn't born and raised here. If it hain't Coniston Mountain\r\nabout seven o'clock of a June evening, I never saw Coniston Mountain.\r\nEr--listen to this.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he read, with a feeling which Wetherell had not supposed he\r\npossessed, an extract: and as the storekeeper listened his blood began\r\nto run wildly. At length Jethro put down the paper without glancing at\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n“There's somethin' about that that fetches you spinnin' through the\r\nair,” he said slowly. “Sh-showed it to Jim Willard, editor of the\r\nNewcastle Guardian. Er--what do you think he said?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” said Wetherell, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Willard said, 'Bass, w-wish you'd find me that man. I'll give him five\r\ndollars every week for a letter like that--er--five dollars a week.'”\r\n\r\nHe paused, folded up the paper again and put it in his pocket, took out\r\na card and handed it to Wetherell.\r\n\r\n        James G. Willard, Editor.\r\n         Newcastle Guardian.\r\n\r\n“That's his address,” said Jethro. “Er--guess you'll know what to do\r\nwith it. Er--five dollars a week--five dollars a week.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know I wrote this article?” said Wetherell, as the card\r\ntrembled between his fingers.\r\n\r\n“K-knowed the place was Coniston seen from the 'east, knowed there\r\nwahn't any one is Brampton or Harwich could have done it--g-guessed the\r\nrest--guessed the rest.”\r\n\r\nWetherell could only stare at him like a man who, with the halter about\r\nhis neck, has been suddenly reprieved. But Jethro Bass did not appear to\r\nbe waiting for thanks. He cleared his throat, and had Wetherell not been\r\nin such a condition himself, he would actually have suspected him of\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n“Er--Wetherell?”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“W-won't say nothin' about the mortgage--p-pay it when you can.”\r\n\r\nThis roused the storekeeper to a burst of protest, but he stemmed it.\r\n\r\n“Hain't got the money, have you?”\r\n\r\n“No--but--”\r\n\r\n“If I needed money, d'ye suppose I'd bought the mortgage?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the still bewildered Wetherell, “of course not.” There\r\nhe stuck, that other suspicion of political coercion suddenly rising\r\nuppermost. Could this be what the man meant? Wetherell put his hand\r\nto his head, but he did not dare to ask the question. Then Jethro Bass\r\nfixed his eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n“Hain't never mixed any in politics--hev you n-never mixed any?”\r\n\r\nWetherell's heart sank.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“D-don't--take my advice--d-don't.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried the storekeeper, so loudly that he frightened himself.\r\n\r\n“D-don't,” repeated Jethro, imperturbably.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence, the storekeeper being unable to speak.\r\nConiston Water, at the foot of the garden, sang the same song, but it\r\nseemed to Wetherell to have changed its note from sorrow to joy.\r\n\r\n“H-hear things, don't you--hear things in the store?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Don't hear 'em. Keep out of politics, Will, s-stick to store-keepin'\r\nand--and literature.”\r\n\r\nJethro got to his feet and turned his back on the storekeeper and picked\r\nup the parcel he had brought.\r\n\r\n“C-Cynthy well?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“I--I'll call her,” said Wetherell, huskily. “She--she was down by the\r\nbrook when you came.”\r\n\r\nBut Jethro Bass did not wait. He took his parcel and strode down to\r\nConiston Water, and there he found Cynthia seated on a rock with her\r\ntoes in a pool.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Cynthy?” said he, looking down at her.\r\n\r\n“I'm well, Uncle Jethro,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“R-remembered what I told you to call me, hev you,” said Jethro, plainly\r\npleased. “Th-that's right. Cynthy?”\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“S-said you liked books--didn't you? S-said you liked books?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” she replied simply, “very much.”\r\n\r\nHe undid the wrapping of the parcel, and there lay disclosed a book with\r\na very gorgeous cover. He thrust it into the child's lap.\r\n\r\n“It's 'Robinson Crusoe'!” she exclaimed, and gave a little shiver of\r\ndelight that made ripples in the pool. Then she opened it--not without\r\nawe, for William Wetherell's hooks were not clothed in this magnificent\r\nmanner. “It's full of pictures,” cried Cynthia. “See, there he is making\r\na ship!”\r\n\r\n“Y-you read it, Cynthy?” asked Jethro, a little anxiously.\r\n\r\nNo, Cynthia hadn't.\r\n\r\n“L-like it, Cynthy--l-like it?” said he, not quite so anxiously.\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up at him with a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n“F-fetched it up from the capital for you, Cynthy--for you.”\r\n\r\n“For me!”\r\n\r\nA strange thrill ran through Jethro Bass as he gazed upon the wonder and\r\ndelight in the face of the child.\r\n\r\n“F-fetched it for you, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Cynthia sat very still, and then she slowly closed the book\r\nand stared at the cover again, Jethro looking down at her the while. To\r\ntell the truth, she found it difficult to express the emotions which the\r\nevent had summoned up.\r\n\r\n“Thank you--Uncle Jethro,” she said.\r\n\r\nJethro, however, understood. He had, indeed, never failed to understand\r\nher from the beginning. He parted his coat tails and sat down on the\r\nrock beside her, and very gently opened the book again, to the first\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to read it, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she said, and trembled again.\r\n\r\n“Er--read it to me?”\r\n\r\nSo Cynthia read “Robinson Crusoe” to him while the summer afternoon wore\r\naway, and the shadows across the pool grew longer and longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThus William Wetherell became established in Coniston, and was started\r\nat last--poor man--upon a life that was fairly tranquil. Lem Hallowell\r\nhad once covered him with blushes by unfolding a newspaper in the\r\nstore and reading an editorial beginning: “We publish today a new\r\nand attractive feature of the Guardian, a weekly contribution from a\r\ncorrespondent whose modesty is to be compared only with his genius as a\r\nwriter. We are confident that the readers of our Raper will appreciate\r\nthe letter in another column signed 'W. W.'” And from that day William\r\nwas accorded much of the deference due to a litterateur which the fates\r\nhad hitherto denied him. Indeed, during the six years which we are about\r\nto skip over so lightly, he became a marked man in Coniston, and it was\r\nvoted in towns meeting that he be intrusted with that most important of\r\nliterary labors, the Town History of Coniston.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, too, there sprang up the strangest of intimacies\r\nbetween him and Jethro Bass. Surely no more dissimilar men than these\r\nhave ever been friends, and that the friendship was sometimes misjudged\r\nwas one of the clouds on William Wetherell's horizon. As the years went\r\non he was still unable to pay off the mortgage; and sometimes, indeed,\r\nhe could not even meet the interest, in spite of the princely sum he\r\nreceived from Mr. Willard of the Guardian. This was one of the clouds on\r\nJethro's horizon, too, if men had but known it, and he took such moneys\r\nas Wetherell insisted upon giving him grudgingly enough. It is needless\r\nto say that he refrained from making use of Mr. Wetherell politically,\r\nalthough no poorer vessel for political purposes was ever constructed.\r\nIt is quite as needless to say, perhaps, that Chester Perkins never got\r\nto be Chairman of the Board of Selectmen.\r\n\r\nAfter Aunt Listy died, Jethro was more than ever to be found, when in\r\nConiston, in the garden or the kitchen behind the store. Yes, Aunt Listy\r\nis dead. She has flitted through these pages as she flitted through life\r\nitself, arrayed by Jethro like the rainbow, and quite as shadowy and\r\nunreal. There is no politician of a certain age in the state who does\r\nnot remember her walking, clad in dragon-fly colors, through the streets\r\nof the capital on Jethro's arm, or descending the stairs of the Pelican\r\nHouse to supper. None of Jethro's detractors may say that he ever failed\r\nin kindness to her, and he loved her as much as was in his heart to love\r\nany woman after Cynthia Ware. As for Aunt Listy, she never seemed to\r\nfeel any resentment against the child Jethro brought so frequently to\r\nThousand Acre Hill. Poor Aunt Listy! some people used to wonder whether\r\nshe ever felt any emotion at all. But I believe that she did, in her own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that Mr. Bijah Bixby came over from Clovelly, to\r\nrequest the place of superintendent of the funeral, a position which had\r\nalready been filled. A special office, too, was created on this occasion\r\nfor an old supporter of Jethro's, Senator Peleg Hartington of Brampton.\r\nHe was made chairman of the bearers, of whom Ephraim Prescott was one.\r\n\r\nAfter this, as we have said, Jethro was more than ever at the store--or\r\nrather in that domestic domain behind it which Wetherell and Cynthia\r\nshared with Miss Millicent Skinner. Moses Hatch was wont to ask Cynthia\r\nhow her daddies were. It was he who used to clear out the road to the\r\nlittle schoolhouse among the birches when the snow almost buried the\r\nlittle village, and on sparkling mornings after the storms his oxen\r\nwould stop to breathe in front of the store, a cluster of laughing\r\nchildren clinging to the snow-plough and tumbling over good-natured\r\nMoses in their frolics. Cynthia became a country girl, and grew long and\r\nlithe of limb, and weather-burnt, and acquired an endurance that spoke\r\nwonders for the life-giving air of Coniston. But she was a serious\r\nchild, and Wetherell and Jethro sometimes wondered whether she was ever\r\na child at all. When Eben Hatch fell from the lumber pile on the ice,\r\nit was she who bound the cut in his head; and when Tom Richardson\r\nunexpectedly embraced the schoolhouse stove, Cynthia, not Miss Rebecca\r\nNorthcutt, took charge of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps inevitable, with such a helpless father, that the girl\r\nshould grow up with a sense of responsibility, being what she was. Did\r\nWilliam Wetherell go to Brampton, Cynthia examined his apparel, and he\r\nwas marched shamefacedly back to his room to change; did he read too\r\nlate at night, some unseen messenger summoned her out of her sleep, and\r\nhe was packed off to bed. Miss Millicent Skinner, too, was in a like\r\nmysterious way compelled to abdicate her high place in favor of Cynthia,\r\nand Wetherell was utterly unable to explain how this miracle was\r\naccomplished. Not only did Millicent learn to cook, but Cynthia, at\r\nthe age of fourteen, had taught her. Some wit once suggested that the\r\nnational arms of the United States should contain the emblem of crossed\r\nfrying-pans, and Millicent was in this respect a true American. When\r\nWetherell began to suffer from her pies and doughnuts, the revolution\r\ntook place--without stampeding, or recriminations, or trouble of any\r\nkind. One evening he discovered Cynthia, decked in an apron, bending\r\nover the stove, and Millicent looking on with an expression that was\r\n(for Millicent) benign.\r\n\r\nThis was to some extent explained, a few days later, when Wetherell\r\nfound himself gazing across the counter at the motherly figure of Mrs.\r\nMoses Hatch, who held the well-deserved honor of being the best cook in\r\nConiston.\r\n\r\n“Hain't had so much stomach trouble lately, Will?” she remarked.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered, surprised; “Cynthia is learning to cook.”\r\n\r\n“Guess she is,” said Mrs. Moses. “That gal is worth any seven grown-up\r\nwomen in town. And she was four nights settin' in my kitchen before I\r\nknowed what she was up to.”\r\n\r\n“So you taught her, Amanda?\r\n\r\n“I taught her some. She callated that Milly was killin' you, and I guess\r\nshe was.”\r\n\r\nDuring her school days, Jethro used frequently to find himself in\r\nfront of the schoolhouse when the children came trooping out--quite\r\nby accident, of course. Winter or summer, when he went away on his\r\nperiodical trips, he never came back without a little remembrance in his\r\ncarpet bag, usually a book, on the subject of which he had spent hours\r\nin conference with the librarian at the state library at the capital.\r\nBut in June of the year when Cynthia was fifteen, Jethro yielded to\r\nthat passion which was one of the man's strangest characteristics, and\r\nappeared one evening in the garden behind the store with a bundle which\r\ncertainly did not contain a book. With all the gravity of a ceremony he\r\ntook off the paper, and held up in relief against the astonished Cynthia\r\na length of cardinal cloth. William Wetherell, who was looking out\r\nof the window, drew his breath, and even Jethro drew back with an\r\nexclamation at the change wrought in her. But Cynthia snatched the roll\r\nfrom his hand and wound it up with a feminine deftness.\r\n\r\n“Wh-what's the matter, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can't wear that, Uncle Jethro,” she said.\r\n\r\n“C-can't wear it! Why not?”\r\n\r\nCynthia sat down on the grassy mound under the apple tree and clasped\r\nher hands across her knees. She looked up at him and shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Don't you see that I couldn't wear it, Uncle Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he demanded. “Ch-change it if you've a mind to hev green.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and smiled at him a little sadly.\r\n\r\n“T-took me a full hour to choose that, Cynthy,” said he. “H-had to go to\r\nBoston so I got it there.”\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, grievously disappointed at this reception of his gift,\r\nand he stood eying the cardinal cloth very mournfully as it lay on the\r\npaper. Cynthia, remorseful, reached up and seized his hand.\r\n\r\n“Sit down here, Uncle Jethro.” He sat down on the mound beside her, very\r\nmuch perplexed. She still held his hand in hers. “Uncle Jethro,” she\r\nsaid slowly, “you mustn't think I'm not grateful.”\r\n\r\n“N-no,” he answered; “I don't think that, Cynthy. I know you be.”\r\n\r\n“I am grateful--I'm very grateful for everything you give me, although I\r\nshould love you just as much if you didn't give me anything.”\r\n\r\nShe was striving very hard not to offend him, for in some ways he was\r\nas sensitive as Wetherell himself. Even Coniston folk had laughed at the\r\nidiosyncrasy which Jethro had of dressing his wife in brilliant colors,\r\nand the girl knew this.\r\n\r\n“G-got it for you to wear to Brampton on the Fourth of July, Cynthy,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro, I couldn't wear that to Brampton!”\r\n\r\n“You'd look like a queen,” said he.\r\n\r\n“But I'm not a queen,” objected Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Rather hev somethin' else?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, looking at him suddenly with the gleam of laughter in\r\nher eyes, although she was on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\n“Wh-what?” Jethro demanded.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Cynthia, demurely gazing down at her ankles, “shoes and\r\nstockings.” The barefooted days had long gone by.\r\n\r\nJethro laughed. Perhaps some inkling of her reasons came to him, for\r\nhe had a strange and intuitive understanding of her. At any rate, he\r\naccepted her decision with a meekness which would have astonished many\r\npeople who knew only that side of him which he showed to the world.\r\nGently she released her hand, and folded up the bundle again and gave it\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“B-better keep it--hadn't you?”\r\n\r\n“No, you keep it. And I will wear it for you when I am rich, Uncle\r\nJethro.”\r\n\r\nJethro did keep it, and in due time the cardinal cloth had its uses. But\r\nCynthia did not wear it on the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nThat was a great day for Brampton, being not only the nation's birthday,\r\nbut the hundredth year since the adventurous little band of settlers\r\nfrom Connecticut had first gazed upon Coniston Water at that place.\r\nEarly in the morning wagon loads began to pour into Brampton Street\r\nfrom Harwich, from Coniston, from Tarleton Four Corners, and even from\r\ndistant Clovelly, and Brampton was banner-hung for the occasion--flags\r\nacross the stores, across the dwellings, and draped along the whole\r\nbreadth of the meeting-house; but for sheer splendor the newly built\r\nmansion of Isaac D. Worthington outshone them all. Although its owner\r\nwas a professed believer in republican simplicity, no such edifice\r\nornamented any town to the west of the state capital. Small wonder that\r\nthe way in front of it was blocked by a crowd lost in admiration of\r\nits Gothic proportions! It stands to-day one of many monuments to its\r\nbuilder, with its windows of one pane (unheard-of magnificence), its\r\ntower of stone, its porch with pointed arches and scroll-work. No fence\r\ndivides its grounds from the public walk, and on the smooth-shaven lawn\r\nbetween the ornamental flower beds and the walk stand two stern mastiffs\r\nof iron, emblematic of the solidity and power of their owner. It was\r\nas much to see this house as to hear the oratory that the countryside\r\nflocked to Brampton that day.\r\n\r\nAll the day before Cynthia and Milly, and many another housewife, had\r\nbeen making wonderful things for the dinners they were to bring, and\r\nstowing them in the great basket ready for the early morning start. At\r\nsix o'clock Jethro's three-seated farm wagon was in front of the store.\r\nCousin Ephraim Prescott, in a blue suit and an army felt hat with a\r\ncord, got up behind, a little stiffly by reason of that Wilderness\r\nbullet; and there were also William Wetherell and Lem Hallowell, his\r\nhonest face shining, and Sue, his wife, and young Sue and Jock and\r\nLilian, all a-quiver with excitement in their Sunday best.\r\n\r\nAnd as they drove away there trotted up behind them Moses and Amandy\r\nHatch, with their farm team, and all the little Hatches,--Eben and\r\nGeorge and Judy and Liza. As they jogged along they drank in the\r\nfragrance of the dew-washed meadows and the pines, and a great\r\nblue heron stood knee-deep on the far side of Deacon Lysander's old\r\nmill-pond, watching them philosophically as they passed.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o'clock when they got into the press of Brampton Street,\r\nand there was a hush as they made their way slowly through the throng,\r\nand many a stare at the curious figure in the old-fashioned blue\r\nswallowtail and brass buttons and tall hat, driving the farm wagon.\r\nHusbands pointed him out to their wives, young men to sisters and\r\nsweethearts, some openly, some discreetly. “There goes Jethro Bass,” and\r\nsome were bold enough to say, “Howdy, Jethro?” Jake Wheeler was to be\r\nobserved in the crowd ahead of them, hurried for once out of his\r\nJethro step, actually running toward the tavern, lest such a one arrive\r\nunheralded. Commotion is perceived on the tavern porch,--Mr. Sherman,\r\nthe proprietor, bustling out, Jake Wheeler beside him; a chorus of “How\r\nbe you, Jethros?” from the more courageous there,--but the farm team\r\njogs on, leaving a discomfited gathering, into the side street, up an\r\nalley, and into the cool, ammonia-reeking sheds of lank Jim Sanborn's\r\nlivery stable. No obsequiousness from lank Jim, who has the traces\r\nslipped and the reins festooned from the bits almost before Jethro has\r\nlifted Cynthia to the floor. Jethro, walking between Cynthia and her\r\nfather, led the way, Ephraim, Lem, and Sue Hallowell following, the\r\nchildren, in unwonted shoes and stockings, bringing up the rear.\r\nThe people parted, and presently they found themselves opposite the\r\nnew-scrolled band stand among the trees, where the Harwich band in\r\nglittering gold and red had just been installed. The leader; catching\r\nsight of Jethro's party, and of Ephraim's corded army hat, made a bow,\r\nwaved his baton, and they struck up “Marching through Georgia.” It was,\r\nof course, not dignified to cheer, but I think that the blood of every\r\nman and woman and child ran faster with the music, and so many of them\r\nlooked at Cousin Ephraim that he slipped away behind the line of wagons.\r\nSo the day began.\r\n\r\n“Jest to think of bein' that rich, Will!” exclaimed Amanda Hatch to the\r\nstorekeeper, as they stood in the little group which had gathered in\r\nfront of the first citizen's new mansion. “I own it scares me. Think how\r\nmuch that house must hev cost, and even them dogs,” said Amanda, staring\r\nat the mastiffs with awe. “They tell me he has a grand piano from\r\nNew York, and guests from Boston railroad presidents. I call Isaac\r\nWorthington to mind when he wahn't but a slip of a boy with a cough,\r\nrunnin' after Cynthy Ware.” She glanced down at Cynthia with something\r\nof compassion. “Just to think, child, he might have be'n your father!”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad he isn't,” said Cynthia, hotly.\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” replied the good-natured and well-intentioned\r\nAmanda, “I'd sooner have your father than Isaac Worthington. But I was\r\nonly thinkin' how nice it would be to be rich.”\r\n\r\nJust then one of the glass-panelled doors of this house opened, and a\r\ngood-looking lad of seventeen came out.\r\n\r\n“That's Bob Worthington,” said Amanda, determined that they should miss\r\nnothing. “My! it wahn't but the other day when he put on long pants. It\r\nwon't be a great while before he'll go into the mills and git all that\r\nmoney. Guess he'll marry some city person. He'd ought to take you,\r\nCynthy.”\r\n\r\n“I don't want him,” said Cynthia, the color flaming into her cheeks. And\r\nshe went off across the green in search of Jethro.\r\n\r\nThere was a laugh from the honest country folk who had listened. Bob\r\nWorthington came to the edge of the porch and stood there, frankly\r\nscanning the crowd, with an entire lack of self-consciousness. Some of\r\nthem shifted nervously, with the New Englander's dislike of being caught\r\nin the act of sight-seeing.\r\n\r\n“What in the world is he starin' at me for?” said Amanda, backing behind\r\nthe bulkier form of her husband. “As I live, I believe he's comin'\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington was, indeed, descending the steps and walking\r\nacross the lawn toward them, nodding and smiling to acquaintances as he\r\npassed. To Wetherell's astonishment he made directly for the place where\r\nhe was standing and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Wetherell?” he said. “Perhaps you don't remember\r\nme,--Bob Worthington.”\r\n\r\n“I can't say that I should have known you,” answered the storekeeper.\r\nThey were all absurdly silent, thinking of nothing to say and admiring\r\nthe boy because he was at ease.\r\n\r\n“I hope you have a good seat at the exercises,” he said, pressing\r\nWetherell's hand again, and before he could thank him, Bob was off in\r\nthe direction of the band stand.\r\n\r\n“One thing,” remarked Amanda, “he ain't much like his dad. You'd never\r\ncatch Isaac Worthington bein' that common.”\r\n\r\nJust then there came another interruption for William Wetherell, who was\r\nstartled by the sound of a voice in his ear--a nasal voice that awoke\r\nunpleasant recollections. He turned to confront, within the distance of\r\neight inches, the face of Mr. Bijah Bixby of Clovelly screwed up into\r\na greeting. The storekeeper had met Mr. Bixby several times since that\r\nfirst memorable meeting, and on each occasion, as now, his hand had made\r\nan involuntary movement to his watch pocket.\r\n\r\n“Hain't seed you for some time, Will,” remarked Mr. Bixby; “goin' over\r\nto the exercises? We'll move along that way,” and he thrust his hand\r\nunder Mr. Wetherell's elbow. “Whar's Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“He's here somewhere,” answered the storekeeper, helplessly, moving\r\nalong in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“Keepin' out of sight, you understand,” said Bijah, with a knowing wink,\r\nas much as to say that Mr. Wetherell was by this time a past master in\r\nJethro tactics. Mr. Bixby could never disabuse his mind of a certain\r\ninterpretation which he put on the storekeeper's intimacy with Jethro.\r\n“You done well to git in with him, Will. Didn't think you had it in you\r\nwhen I first looked you over.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell wished to make an indignant denial, but he didn't know\r\nexactly how to begin.\r\n\r\n“Smartest man in the United States of America--guess you know that,” Mr.\r\nBixby continued amiably. “They can't git at him unless he wants 'em to.\r\nThere's a railroad president at Isaac Worthington's who'd like to git at\r\nhim to-day,--guess you know that,--Steve Merrill.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell didn't know, but he was given no time to say so.\r\n\r\n“Steve Merrill, of the Grand Gulf and Northern. He hain't here to see\r\nWorthington; he's here to see Jethro, when Jethro's a mind to. Guess you\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing about it,” answered Wetherell, shortly. Mr. Bixby gave\r\nhim a look of infinite admiration, as though he could not have pursued\r\nany more admirable line.\r\n\r\n“I know Steve Merrill better'n I know you,” said Mr. Bixby, “and he\r\nknows me. Whenever he sees me at the state capital he says, 'How be you,\r\nBije?' just as natural as if I was a railroad president, and slaps me\r\non the back. When be you goin' to the capital, Will? You'd ought to come\r\ndown and be thar with the boys on this Truro Bill. You could reach some\r\non 'em the rest of us couldn't git at.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell avoided a reply to this very pointed inquiry by\r\nescaping into the meeting-house, where he found Jethro and Cynthia and\r\nEphraim already seated halfway up the aisle.\r\n\r\nOn the platform, behind a bank of flowers, are the velvet covered chairs\r\nwhich contain the dignitaries of the occasion. The chief of these is, of\r\ncourse, Mr. Isaac Worthington, the one with the hawk-like look, sitting\r\nnext to the Rev. Mr. Sweet, who is rather pudgy by contrast. On the\r\nother side of Mr. Sweet, next to the parlor organ and the quartette,\r\nis the genial little railroad president Mr. Merrill, batting the flies\r\nwhich assail the unprotected crown of his head, and smiling benignly on\r\nthe audience.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his eye becomes fixed, and he waves a fat hand vigorously at\r\nJethro, who answers the salute with a nod of unwonted cordiality for\r\nhim. Then comes a hush, and the exercises begin.\r\n\r\nThere is a prayer, of course, by the Rev. Mr. Sweet, and a rendering\r\nof “My Country” and “I would not Change my Lot,” and other choice\r\nselections by the quartette; and an original poem recited with much\r\nfeeling by a lady admirer of Miss Lucretia Penniman, and the “Hymn to\r\nConiston” declaimed by Mr. Gamaliel Ives, president of the Brampton\r\nLiterary Club. But the crowning event is, of course, the oration by Mr.\r\nIsaac D. Worthington, the first citizen, who is introduced under that\r\ntitle by the chairman of the day; and as the benefactor of Brampton, who\r\nhas bestowed upon the town the magnificent gift which was dedicated such\r\na short time ago, the Worthington Free Library.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaac D. Worthington stood erect beside the table, his hand thrust\r\ninto the opening of his coat, and spoke at the rate of one hundred and\r\neight words a minute, for exactly one hour. He sketched with much skill\r\nthe creed of the men who had fought their way through the forests to\r\nbuild their homes by Coniston Water, who had left their clearings to\r\nrisk their lives behind Stark and Ethan Allen for that creed; he paid a\r\ngraceful tribute to the veterans of the Civil War, scattered among his\r\nhearers--a tribute, by the way, which for some reason made Ephraim very\r\nindignant. Mr. Worthington went on to outline the duty of citizens of\r\nthe present day, as he conceived it, and in this connection referred,\r\nwith becoming modesty, to the Worthington Free Library. He had made his\r\nmoney in Brampton, and it was but right that he should spend it for\r\nthe benefit of the people of Brampton. The library, continued Mr.\r\nWorthington when the applause was over, had been the dream of a certain\r\ndelicate youth who had come, many years ago, to Brampton for his health.\r\n(It is a curious fact, by the way, that Mr. Worthington seldom recalled\r\nthe delicate youth now, except upon public occasions.)\r\n\r\nYes, the dream of that youth had been to benefit in some way that\r\ncommunity in which circumstances had decreed that he should live, and\r\nin this connection it might not be out of place to mention a bill then\r\nbefore the Legislature of the state, now in session. If the bill became\r\na law, the greatest modern factor of prosperity, the railroad, would\r\ncome to Brampton. The speaker was interrupted here by more applause.\r\nMr. Worthington did not deem it dignified or necessary to state that the\r\nrailroad to which he referred was the Truro Railroad; and that he, as\r\nthe largest stockholder, might indirectly share that prosperity with\r\nBrampton. That would be wandering too far, from his subject, which, it\r\nwill be recalled, was civic duties. He took a glass of water, and went\r\non to declare that he feared--sadly feared--that the ballot was not held\r\nas sacred as it had once been. He asked the people of Brampton, and\r\nof the state, to stop and consider who in these days made the laws and\r\ngranted the franchises. Whereupon he shook his head very slowly and\r\nsadly, as much as to imply that, if the Truro Bill did not pass, the\r\ncorruption of the ballot was to blame. No, Mr. Worthington could\r\nthink of no better subject on this Birthday of Independence than a\r\nrecapitulation of the creed of our forefathers, from which we had so far\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\nIn short, the first citizen, as became him, had delivered the first\r\nreform speech ever heard in Brampton, and the sensation which it created\r\nwas quite commensurate to the occasion. The presence in the audience of\r\nJethro Bass, at whom many believed the remarks to have been aimed, added\r\nno little poignancy to that sensation, although Jethro gave no outward\r\nsigns of the terror and remorse by which he must have been struck while\r\nlistening to Mr. Worthington's ruminations of the corruption of the\r\nballot. Apparently unconscious of the eyes upon him, he walked out of\r\nthe meeting-house with Cynthia by his side, and they stood waiting for\r\nWetherell and Ephraim under the maple tree there.\r\n\r\nThe be-ribboned members of the Independence Day committee were now on\r\nthe steps, and behind them came Isaac Worthington and Mr. Merrill. The\r\npeople, scenting a dramatic situation, lingered. Would the mill owner\r\nspeak to the boss? The mill owner, with a glance at the boss, did\r\nnothing of the kind, but immediately began to talk rapidly to Mr.\r\nMerrill. That gentleman, however, would not be talked to, but came\r\nrunning over to Jethro and seized his hand, leaving Mr. Worthington to\r\nwalk on by himself.\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” cried the little railroad president, “upon my word. Well,\r\nwell. And Miss Jethro,” he took off his hat to Cynthia, “well, well.\r\nDidn't know you had a girl, Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“W-wish she was mine, Steve,” said Jethro. “She's a good deal to me as\r\nit is. Hain't you, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Mr. Merrill, staring at her, “you'll have to look out\r\nfor her some day--keep the boys away from her--eh? Upon my word! Well,\r\nJethro,” said he, with a twinkle in his eye, “are you goin' to reform?\r\nI'll bet you've got an annual over my road in your pocket right now.”\r\n\r\n“Enjoy the speech-makin', Steve?” inquired Mr. Bass, solemnly.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill winked at Jethro, and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“Keep the boys away from her, Jethro,” he repeated, laying his hand on\r\nthe shoulder of the lad who stood beside him. “It's a good thing Bob's\r\ngoing off to Harvard this fall. Seems to me I heard about some cutting\r\nup at Andover--eh, Bob?”\r\n\r\nBob grinned, showing a line of very white teeth.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill took Jethro by the arm and led him off a little distance,\r\nhaving a message of some importance to give him, the purport of which\r\nwill appear later. And Cynthia and Bob were left face to face. Of course\r\nBob could have gone on, if he had wished it.\r\n\r\n“Don't remember me, do you?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I do now,” said Cynthia, looking at him rather timidly through her\r\nlashes. Her face was hot, and she had been, very uncomfortable during\r\nMr. Merrill's remarks. Furthermore, Bob had not taken his eyes off her.\r\n\r\n“I remembered you right away,” he said reproachfully; “I saw you in\r\nfront of the house this morning, and you ran away.”\r\n\r\n“I didn't runaway,” replied Cynthia, indignantly.\r\n\r\n“It looked like it, to me,” said Bob.. “I suppose you were afraid I was\r\ngoing to give you anther whistle.”\r\n\r\nCynthia bit her lip, and then she laughed. Then she looked around to see\r\nwhere Jethro was, and discovered that they were alone in front of the\r\nmeeting-house. Ephraim and her father had passed on while Mr. Merrill\r\nwas talking.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter?” asked Bob.\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid they've gone,” said Cynthia. “I ought to be going after\r\nthem. They'll miss me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, they won't,” said Bob, easily, “let's sit down under the tree.\r\nThey'll come back.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he sat down under the maple. But Cynthia remained standing,\r\nready to fly. She had an idea that it was wrong to stay--which made it\r\nall the more delightful.\r\n\r\n“Sit down--Cynthia,” said he.\r\n\r\nShe glanced down at him, startled. He was sitting, with his legs\r\ncrossed, looking up at her intently.\r\n\r\n“I like that name,” he observed. “I like it better than any girl's name\r\nI know. Do be good-natured and sit down.” And he patted the ground close\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nShy laughed again. The laugh had in it an exquisite note of shyness,\r\nwhich he liked.\r\n\r\n“Why do you want me to sit down?” she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Because I want to talk to you.”\r\n\r\n“Can't you talk to me standing up?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I could,” said Bob, “but--I shouldn't be able to say such\r\nnice things to you.”\r\n\r\nThe corners of her mouth trembled a little.\r\n\r\n“And whose loss would that be?” she asked.\r\n\r\nBob Worthington was surprised at this retort, and correspondingly\r\ndelighted. He had not expected it in a country storekeeper's daughter,\r\nand he stared at Cynthia so frankly that she blushed again, and\r\nturned away. He was a young man who, it may be surmised, had had some\r\nexperience with the other sex at Andover and elsewhere. He had not spent\r\nall of his life in Brampton.\r\n\r\n“I've often thought of you since that day when you wouldn't take the\r\nwhistle,” he declared. “What are you laughing at?”\r\n\r\n“I'm laughing at you,” said Cynthia, leaning against the tree, with her\r\nhands behind her.\r\n\r\n“You've been laughing at me ever since you've stood there,” he said,\r\naggrieved that his declarations should not betaken more seriously.\r\n\r\n“What have you thought about me?” she demanded. She was really beginning\r\nto enjoy this episode.\r\n\r\n“Well--” he began, and hesitated--and broke down and laughed--Cynthia\r\nlaughed with him.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you what I didn't think,” said Bob.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Cynthia, falling into the trap.\r\n\r\n“I didn't think you'd be so--so good-looking,” said he, quite boldly.\r\n\r\n“And I didn't think you'd be so rude,” responded Cynthia. But though she\r\nblushed again, she was not exactly displeased.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do this afternoon?” he asked. “Let's go for a\r\nwalk.”\r\n\r\n“I'm going back to Coniston.”\r\n\r\n“Let's go for a walk now,” said he, springing to his feet. “Come on.”\r\n\r\nCynthia looked at him and shook her head smilingly.\r\n\r\n“Here's Uncle Jethro--”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro!” exclaimed Bob, “is he your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, not really. But he's just the same. He's very good to me.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether he'd mind if I called him Uncle Jethro, too,” said\r\nBob, and Cynthia laughed at the notion. This young man was certainly\r\nvery comical, and very frank. “Good-by,” he said; “I'll come to see you\r\nsome day in Coniston.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThat evening, after Cynthia had gone to bed, William Wetherell sat down\r\nat Jonah Winch's desk in the rear of the store to gaze at a blank sheet\r\nof paper until the Muses chose to send him subject matter for his weekly\r\nletter to the Guardian. The window was open, and the cool airs from the\r\nmountain spruces mingled with the odors of corn meal and kerosene and\r\ncalico print. Jethro Bass, who had supped with the storekeeper, sat in\r\nthe wooden armchair silent, with his head bent. Sometimes he would sit\r\nthere by the hour while Wetherell wrote or read, and take his departure\r\nwhen he was so moved without saying good night. Presently Jethro lifted\r\nhis chin, and dropped it again; there was a sound of wheels without,\r\nand, after an interval, a knock at the door.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell dropped his pen with a start of surprise, as it was\r\nlate for a visitor in Coniston. He glanced at Jethro, who did not move,\r\nand then he went to the door and shot back the great forged bolt of\r\nit, and stared out. On the edge of the porch stood a tallish man in a\r\ndouble-breasted frock coat.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington!” exclaimed the storekeeper.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington coughed and pulled at one of his mutton-chop whiskers,\r\nand seemed about to step off the porch again. It was, indeed, the\r\nfirst citizen and reformer of Brampton. No wonder William Wetherell was\r\nmystified.\r\n\r\n“Can I do anything for you?” he asked. “Have you missed your way?”\r\n\r\nWetherell thought he heard him muttering, “No, no,” and then he was\r\nstartled by another voice in his ear. It was Jethro who was standing\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n“G-guess he hain't missed his way a great deal. Er--come in--come in.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington took a couple of steps forward.\r\n\r\n“I understood that you were to be alone,” he remarked, addressing Jethro\r\nwith an attempted severity of manner.\r\n\r\n“Didn't say so--d-didn't say so, did I?” answered Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Mr. Worthington, “any other time will do for this\r\nlittle matter.”\r\n\r\n“Er--good night,” said Jethro, shortly, and there was the suspicion of\r\na gleam in his eye as Mr. Worthington turned away. The mill-owner,\r\nin fact, did not get any farther than the edge of the porch before he\r\nwheeled again.\r\n\r\n“The affair which I have to discuss with you is of a private nature, Mr.\r\nBass,” he said.\r\n\r\n“So I callated,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“You may have the place to yourselves, gentlemen,” Wetherell put in\r\nuneasily, and then Mr. Worthington came as far as the door, where he\r\nstood looking at the storekeeper with scant friendliness. Jethro turned\r\nto Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“You a politician, Will?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“You a business man?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said again.\r\n\r\n“You ever tell folks what you hear other people say?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” the storekeeper answered; “I'm not interested in other\r\npeople's business.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Jethro. “Guess you'd better stay.”\r\n\r\n“But I don't care to stay,” Wetherell objected.\r\n\r\n“Stay to oblige me--stay to oblige me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, if you put it that way,” Wetherell said, beginning to get\r\nsome amusement out of the situation.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what Jethro's object was in this matter; perhaps others\r\nmay guess.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington, who had stood by with ill-disguised impatience during\r\nthis colloquy, note broke in.\r\n\r\n“It is most unusual, Mr. Bass, to have a third person present at a\r\nconference in which he has no manner of concern. I think on the whole,\r\nsince you have insisted upon my coming to you--”\r\n\r\n“H-hain't insisted that I know of,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Worthington, “never mind that.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it would be better for me to come to you some other time, when\r\nyou are alone.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Wetherell had shut the door, and they had gradually\r\nwalked to the rear of the store. Jethro parted his coat tails, and sat\r\ndown again in the armchair. Wetherell, not wishing to be intrusive, went\r\nto his desk again, leaving the first citizen standing among the barrels.\r\n\r\n“W-what other time?” Jethro asked.\r\n\r\n“Any other time,” said Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“What other time?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow night?” suggested Mr. Worthington, striving to hide his\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n“B-busy to-morrow night,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“You know that what I have to talk to you about is of the utmost\r\nimportance,” said Worthington. “Let us say Saturday night.”\r\n\r\n“B-busy Saturday night,” said Jethro. “Meet you to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“What time?”\r\n\r\n“Noon,” said Jethro, “noon.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” asked Mr. Worthington, dubiously.\r\n\r\n“Band stand in Brampton Street,” said Jethro, and the storekeeper was\r\nfain to bend over his desk to conceal his laughter, busying himself with\r\nhis books. Mr. Worthington sat down with as much dignity as he could\r\nmuster on one of Jonah's old chairs, and Jonah Winch's clock ticked and\r\nticked, and Wetherell's pen scratched and scratched on his weekly\r\nletter to Mr. Willard, although he knew that he was writing the sheerest\r\nnonsense. As a matter of fact, he tore up the sheets the next morning\r\nwithout reading them. Mr. Worthington unbuttoned his coat, fumbled in\r\nhis pocket, and pulled out two cigars, one of which he pushed toward\r\nJethro, who shook his head. Mr. Worthington lighted his cigar and\r\ncleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you have observed, Mr. Bass,” he said, “that this is a rapidly\r\ngrowing section of the state--that the people hereabouts are every day\r\ndemanding modern and efficient means of communication with the outside\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“Struck you as a mill owner, has it?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I do not care to emphasize my private interests,” answered Mr.\r\nWorthington, at last appearing to get into his stride again. “I wish to\r\nput the matter on broader grounds. Men like you and me ought not to be\r\nso much concerned with our own affairs as with those of the population\r\namongst whom we live. And I think I am justified in putting it to you on\r\nthese grounds.”\r\n\r\n“H-have to be justified, do you--have to be justified?” Jethro inquired.\r\n“Er--why?”\r\n\r\nThis was a poser, and for a moment he stared at Jethro, blankly, until\r\nhe decided how to take it. Then he crossed his legs and blew smoke\r\ntoward the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“It is certainly fairer to everybody to take the broadest view of a\r\nsituation,” he remarked; “I am trying to regard this from the aspect of\r\na citizen, and I am quite sure that it will appeal to you in the same\r\nlight. If the spirit which imbued the founders of this nation means\r\nanything, Mr. Bass, it means that the able men who are given a chance\r\nto rise by their own efforts must still retain the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the humblest citizens. That, I take it, is our\r\nposition, Mr. Bass,--yours and mine.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington had uncrossed his legs, and was now by the inspiration\r\nof his words impelled to an upright position. Suddenly he glanced at\r\nJethro, and started for Jethro had sunk down on the small of his back,\r\nhis chin on his chest, in an attitude of lassitude if not of oblivion.\r\nThere was a silence perhaps a little disconcerting for Mr. Worthington,\r\nwho chose the opportunity to relight his cigar.\r\n\r\n“G-got through?” said Jethro, without moving, “g-got through?”\r\n\r\n“Through?” echoed Mr. Worthington, “through what?”\r\n\r\n“T-through Sunday-school,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nWorthington dropped his match and stamped on it, and Wetherell began\r\nto wonder how much the man would stand. It suddenly came over the\r\nstorekeeper that the predicament in which Mr. Worthington found himself\r\nwhatever it was--must be a very desperate one. He half rose in his\r\nchair, sat down again, and lighted another match.\r\n\r\n“Er--director in the Truro Road, hain't you, Mr. Worthington?” asked\r\nJethro, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Er--principal stockholder--ain't you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--but that is neither here nor there, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Road don't pay--r-road don't pay, does it?”\r\n\r\n“It certainly does not.”\r\n\r\n“W-would pay if it went to Brampton and Harwich?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass, the company consider that they are pledged to the people of\r\nthis section to get the road through. I am not prepared to say whether\r\nthe road would pay, but it is quite likely that it would not.”\r\n\r\n“Ch-charitable organization?” said Jethro, from the depths of his chair.\r\n\r\n“The pioneers in such matters take enormous risks for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity, sir. We believe that we are entitled to a franchise, and in\r\nmy opinion the General Court are behaving disgracefully in refusing\r\nus one. I will not say all I think about that affair, Mr. Bass. I am\r\nconvinced that influences are at work--” He broke off with a catch in\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\n“T-tried to get a franchise, did you?”\r\n\r\n“I am not here to quibble with you, Mr. Bass. We tried to get it by\r\nevery legitimate means, and failed, and you know it as well as I do.”\r\n\r\n“Er--Heth Sutton didn't sign his receipt--er--did he?”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper, not being a politician, was not aware that the somewhat\r\nobscure reference of Jethro's to the Speaker of the House concerned\r\nan application which Mr. Worthington was supposed to have made to that\r\ngentleman, who had at length acknowledged his inability to oblige,\r\nand had advised Mr. Worthington to go to headquarters. And Mr. Stephen\r\nMerrill, who had come to Brampton out of the kindness of his heart, had\r\nonly arranged this meeting in a conversation with Jethro that day, after\r\nthe reform speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington sprang to his feet, and flung out a hand toward Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Prove your insinuations, air,” he cried; “I defy you to prove your\r\ninsinuations.”\r\n\r\nBut Jethro still sat unmoved.\r\n\r\n“H-Heth in the charitable organization, too?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“People told me I was a fool to believe in honesty, but I thought better\r\nof the lawmakers of my state. I'll tell you plainly what they said to\r\nme, sir. They said, 'Go to Jethro Bass.'”\r\n\r\n“Well, so you have, hain't you? So you have.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have. I've come to appeal to you in behalf of the people of your\r\nsection to allow that franchise to go through the present Legislature.”\r\n\r\n“Er--come to appeal, have you--come to appeal?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Worthington, sitting down again; “I have come to-night\r\nto appeal to you in the name of the farmers and merchants of this\r\nregion--your neighbors,--to use your influence to get that franchise. I\r\nhave come to you with the conviction that I shall not have appealed in\r\nvain.”\r\n\r\n“Er--appealed to Heth in the name of the farmers and merchants?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sutton is Speaker of the House.”\r\n\r\n“F-farmers and merchants elected him,” remarked Jethro, as though\r\nstating a fact.\r\n\r\nWorthington coughed.\r\n\r\n“It is probable that I made a mistake in going to Sutton,” he admitted.\r\n\r\n“If I w-wanted to catch a pike, w-wouldn't use a pin-hook.”\r\n\r\n“I might have known,” remarked Worthington, after a pause, “that Sutton\r\ncould not have been elected Speaker without your influence.”\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer that, but still remained sunk in his chair. To all\r\nappearances he might have been asleep.\r\n\r\n“W-worth somethin' to the farmers and merchants to get that road\r\nthrough--w-worth somethin', ain't it?”\r\n\r\nWetherell held his breath. For a moment Mr. Worthington sat very still,\r\nhis face drawn, and then he wet his lips and rose slowly.\r\n\r\n“We may as well end this conversation, Mr. Bass,” he said, and though\r\nhe tried to speak firmly his voice shook, “it seems to be useless. Good\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nHe picked up his hat and walked slowly toward the door, but Jethro did\r\nnot move or speak. Mr. Worthington reached the door opened it, and the\r\nnight breeze started the lamp to smoking. Wetherell got up and turned it\r\ndown, and the first citizen was still standing in the doorway. His back\r\nwas toward them, but the fingers of his left hand--working convulsively\r\ncaught Wetherell's eye and held it; save for the ticking of the clock\r\nand the chirping of the crickets in the grass, there was silence. Then\r\nMr. Worthington closed the door softly, hesitated, turned, and came back\r\nand stood before Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass,” he said, “we've got to have that franchise.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell glanced at the countryman who, without moving in\r\nhis chair, without raising his voice, had brought the first citizen of\r\nBrampton to his knees. The thing frightened the storekeeper, revolted\r\nhim, and yet its drama held him fascinated. By some subtle process which\r\nhe had actually beheld, but could not fathom, this cold Mr. Worthington,\r\nthis bank president who had given him sage advice, this preacher of\r\npolitical purity, had been reduced to a frenzied supplicant. He stood\r\nbending over Jethro.\r\n\r\n“What's your price? Name it, for God's sake.”\r\n\r\n“B-better wait till you get the bill--hadn't you? b-better wait till you\r\nget the bill.”\r\n\r\n“Will you put the franchise through?”\r\n\r\n“Goin' down to the capital soon?” Jethro inquired.\r\n\r\n“I'm going down on Thursday.”\r\n\r\n“B-better come in and see me,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Mr. Worthington; “I'll be in at two o'clock on\r\nThursday.” And then, without another word to either of them, he swung on\r\nhis heel and strode quickly out of the store. Jethro did not move.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell's hand was trembling so that he could not write,\r\nand he could not trust his voice to speak. Although Jethro had never\r\nmentioned Isaac Worthington's name to him, Wetherell knew that Jethro\r\nhated the first citizen of Brampton.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the sound of the wheels had died away, Jethro broke the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“Er--didn't laugh--did he, Will? Didn't laugh once--did he?”\r\n\r\n“Laugh!” echoed the storekeeper, who himself had never been further from\r\nlaughter in his life.\r\n\r\n“M-might have let him off easier if he'd laughed,” said Jethro, “if he'd\r\nlaughed just once, m-might have let him off easier.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this remark he went out of the store and left Wetherell alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe weekly letter to the Newcastle Guardian was not finished that night,\r\nbut Coniston slept, peacefully, unaware of Mr. Worthington's visit; and\r\nnever, indeed, discovered it, since the historian for various reasons\r\nof his own did not see fit to insert the event in his plan of the Town\r\nHistory. Before another sun had set Jethro Bass had departed for the\r\nstate capital, not choosing to remain to superintend the haying of the\r\nmany farms which had fallen into his hand,--a most unusual omission for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPresently rumors of a mighty issue about the Truro Railroad began to\r\nbe discussed by the politicians at the Coniston store, and Jake\r\nWheeler held himself in instant readiness to answer a summons to the\r\ncapital--which never came.\r\n\r\nDelegations from Brampton and Harwich went to petition the Legislature\r\nfor the franchise, and the Brampton Clarion and Harwich Sentinel\r\ndeclared that the people of Truro County recognized in Isaac Worthington\r\na great and public-spirited man, who ought by all means to be the next\r\ngovernor--if the franchise went through.\r\n\r\nOne evening Lem Hallowell, after depositing a box of trimmings at\r\nEphraim Prescott's harness shop, drove up to the platform of the store\r\nwith the remark that “things were gittin' pretty hot down to the capital\r\nin that franchise fight.”\r\n\r\n“Hain't you b'en sent for yet, Jake?” he cried, throwing his reins over\r\nthe backs of his sweating Morgans; “well, that's strange. Guess the\r\nfight hain't as hot as we hear about. Jethro hain't had to call out his\r\nbest men.”\r\n\r\n“I'm a-goin' down if there's trouble,” declared Jake, who consistently\r\nignored banter.\r\n\r\n“Better git up and git,” said Lem; “there's three out of the five\r\nrailroads against Truro, and Steve Merrill layin' low. Bije Bixby's\r\ndown there, and Heth Sutton, and Abner Parkinson, and all the big bugs.\r\nBetter get aboard, Jake.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the discussion was interrupted by the sight of Cynthia\r\nWetherell coming across the green with an open letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n“It's a message from Uncle Jethro,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was sufficient to warrant the sensation it produced on\r\nall sides.\r\n\r\n“'Tain't a letter from Jethro, is it?” exclaimed Sam Price, overcome by\r\na pardonable curiosity. For it was well known that one of Jethro's fixed\r\nprinciples in life was embodied in his own motto, “Don't write--send.”\r\n\r\n“It's very funny,” answered Cynthia, looking down at the paper with a\r\npuzzled expression. “'Dear Cynthia: Judge Bass wished me to say to you\r\nthat he would be pleased if you and Will would come to the capital and\r\nspend a week with him at the Pelican House, and see the sights. The\r\njudge says Rias Richardson will tend store. Yours truly, P. Hartington.'\r\nThat's all,” said Cynthia, looking up.\r\n\r\nFor a moment you could have heard a pine needle drop on the stoop. Then\r\nRias thrust his hands in his pockets and voiced the general sentiment.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll be--goldurned!” said he.\r\n\r\n“Didn't say nothin' about Jake?” queried Lem.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Cynthia, “that's all--except two pieces of cardboard with\r\nsomething about the Truro Railroad and our names. I don't know what they\r\nare.” And she took them from the envelope.\r\n\r\n“Guess I could tell you if I was pressed,” said Lem, amid a shout of\r\nmerriment from the group.\r\n\r\n“Air you goin', Will?” said Sam Price, pausing with his foot on the step\r\nof his buggy, that he might have the complete news before he left.\r\n\r\n“Godfrey, Will,” exclaimed Rigs, breathlessly, “you hain't a-goin' to\r\nthrow up a chance to stay a hull week at the Pelican, be you?” The mere\r\npossibility of refusal overpowered Rias.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with that delightful French song which treats of\r\nthe leave-taking of one Monsieur Dumollet will appreciate, perhaps, the\r\nattentions which were showered upon William Wetherell and Cynthia upon\r\ntheir departure for the capital next morning. Although Mr. Wetherell\r\nhad at one time been actually a resident of Boston, he received quite as\r\nmany cautions from his neighbors as Monsieur Dumollet. Billets doux and\r\npistols were, of course, not mentioned, but it certainly behooved him,\r\nwhen he should have arrived at that place of intrigues, to be on the\r\nlookout for cabals.\r\n\r\nThey took the stage-coach from Brampton over the pass: picturesque\r\nstage-coach with its apple-green body and leather springs, soon to be\r\nlaid away forever if the coveted Truro Franchise Bill becomes a law;\r\nstage-coach which pulls up defiantly beside its own rival at Truro\r\nstation, where our passengers take the train down the pleasant waterways\r\nand past the little white villages among the fruit trees to the capital.\r\nThe thrill of anticipation was in Cynthia's blood, and the flush of\r\npleasure on her cheeks, when they stopped at last under the sheds. The\r\nconductor snapped his fingers and cried, “This way, Judge,” and there\r\nwas Jethro in his swallow-tailed coat and stove-pipe hat awaiting them.\r\nHe seized Wetherell's carpet-bag with one hand and Cynthia's arm with\r\nthe other, and shouldered his way through the people, who parted when\r\nthey saw who it was.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” cried Cynthia, breathlessly, “I didn't know you were a\r\njudge. What are you judge of?”\r\n\r\n“J-judge of clothes, Cynthy. D-don't you wish you had the red cloth to\r\nwear here?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don't,” said Cynthia. “I'm glad enough to be here without it.”\r\n\r\n“G-glad to hev you in any fixin's, Cynthy,” he said, giving her arm\r\na little squeeze, and by that time they were up the hill and William\r\nWetherell quite winded. For Jethro was strong as an ox, and Cynthia's\r\nmuscles were like an Indian's.\r\n\r\nThey were among the glories of Main Street now. The capital was then,\r\nand still remains, a typically beautiful New England city, with wide\r\nstreets shaded by shapely maples and elms, with substantial homes set\r\nback amidst lawns and gardens. Here on Main Street were neat brick\r\nbusiness buildings and banks and shops, with the park-like grounds of\r\nthe Capitol farther on, and everywhere, from curb to doorway, were\r\nknots of men talking politics; broad-faced, sunburned farmers in store\r\nclothes, with beards that hid their shirt fronts; keen-featured, sallow,\r\ncountry lawyers in long black coats crumpled from much sitting on the\r\nsmall of the back; country storekeepers with shrewd eyes, and local\r\nproprietors and manufacturers.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro, I didn't know you were such a great man,” she said.\r\n\r\n“H-how did ye find out, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“The way people treat you here. I knew you were great, of course,” she\r\nhastened to add.\r\n\r\n“H-how do they treat me?” he asked, looking down at her.\r\n\r\n“You know,” she answered. “They all stop talking when you come along and\r\nstare at you. But why don't you speak to them?”\r\n\r\nJethro smiled and squeezed her arm again, and then they were in the\r\ncorridor of the famous Pelican Hotel, hazy with cigar smoke and\r\nfilled with politicians. Some were standing, hanging on to pillars,\r\ngesticulating, some were ranged in benches along the wall, and a chosen\r\nfew were in chairs grouped around the spittoons. Upon the appearance\r\nof Jethro's party, the talk was hushed, the groups gave way, and they\r\naccomplished a kind of triumphal march to the desk. The clerk, descrying\r\nthem, desisted abruptly from a conversation across the cigar counter,\r\nand with all the form of a ceremony dipped the pen with a flourish into\r\nthe ink and handed it to Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Your rooms are ready, Judge,” he said.\r\n\r\nAs they started for the stairs, Jethro and Cynthia leading the way,\r\nWetherell felt a touch on his elbow and turned to confront Mr. Bijah\r\nBixby--at very close range, as usual.\r\n\r\n“C-come down at last, Will?” he said. “Thought ye would. Need everybody\r\nthis time--you understand.”\r\n\r\n“I came on pleasure,” retorted Mr. Wetherell, somewhat angrily.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby appeared hugely to enjoy the joke.\r\n\r\n“So I callated,” he cried, still holding Wetherell's hand in a mild, but\r\npersuasive grip. “So I callated. Guess I done you an injustice, Will.”\r\n\r\n“How's that?”\r\n\r\n“You're a leetle mite smarter than I thought you was. So long. Got a\r\nleetle business now--you understand a leetle business.”\r\n\r\nWas it possible, indeed, for the simple-minded to come to the capital\r\nand not become involved in cabals? With some misgivings William\r\nWetherell watched Mr. Bixby disappear among the throng, kicking up his\r\nheels behind, and then went upstairs. On the first floor Cynthia was\r\nstanding by an open door.\r\n\r\n“Dad,” she cried, “come and see the rooms Uncle Jethro's got for us!”\r\n She took Wetherell's hand and led him in. “See the lace curtains, and\r\nthe chandelier, and the big bureau with the marble top.”\r\n\r\nJethro had parted his coat tails and seated himself enjoyably on the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n“D-don't come often,” he said, “m-might as well have the best.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” said Wetherell, coughing nervously and fumbling in the pocket\r\nof his coat, “you've been very kind to us, and we hardly know how to\r\nthank you. I--I didn't have any use for these.”\r\n\r\nHe held out the pieces of cardboard which had come in Cynthia's letter.\r\nHe dared not look at Jethro, and his eye was fixed instead upon the\r\nsomewhat grandiose signature of Isaac D. Worthington, which they bore.\r\nJethro took them and tore them up, and slowly tossed the pieces into\r\na cuspidor conveniently situated near the foot of the bed. He rose and\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets.\r\n\r\n“Er--when you get freshened up, come into Number 7,” he said.\r\n\r\nNumber 7! But we shall come to that later. Supper first, in a great\r\npillared dining room filled with notables, if we only had the key.\r\nJethro sits silent at the head of the table eating his crackers and\r\nmilk, with Cynthia on his left and William Wetherell on his right.\r\nPoor William, greatly embarrassed by his sudden projection into the\r\nlimelight, is helpless in the clutches of a lady-waitress who is\r\ndemanding somewhat fiercely that he make an immediate choice from a list\r\nof dishes which she is shooting at him with astonishing rapidity. But\r\nwho is this, sitting beside him, who comes to William's rescue, and\r\ndemands that the lady repeat the bill of fare? Surely a notable, for he\r\nhas a generous presence, and jet-black whiskers which catch the light,\r\nwhich give the gentleman, as Mr. Bixby remarked, “quite a settin'.”\r\n Yes, we have met him at last. It is none other than the Honorable Heth\r\nSutton, Rajah of Clovelly, Speaker of the House, who has condescended to\r\nhelp Mr. Wetherell.\r\n\r\nHis chamberlain, Mr. Bijah Bixby, sits on the other side of the\r\nHonorable Heth, and performs the presentation of Mr. Wetherell. But\r\nMr. Sutton, as becomes a man of high position, says little after he\r\nhas rebuked the waitress, and presently departs with a carefully chosen\r\ntoothpick; whereupon Mr. Bixby moves into the vacant seat--not to Mr.\r\nWetherell's unqualified delight.\r\n\r\n“I've knowed him ever sense we was boys,” said Mr. Bixby; “you saw how\r\nintimate we was. When he wants a thing done, he says, 'Bije, you go\r\nout and get 'em.' Never counts the cost. He was nice to you--wahn't he,\r\nWill?” And then Mr. Bixby leaned over and whispered in Mr. Wetherell's\r\near; “He knows--you understand--he knows.”\r\n\r\n“Knows what?” demanded Mr. Wetherell.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby gave him another admiring look.\r\n\r\n“Knows you didn't come down here with Jethro jest to see the sights.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant the talk in the dining room fell flat, and looking up\r\nWilliam Wetherell perceived a portly, rubicund man of middle age\r\nbeing shown to his seat by the headwaiter. The gentleman wore a great,\r\nglittering diamond in his shirt, and a watch chain that contained much\r\nfine gold. But the real cause of the silence was plainly in the young\r\nwoman who walked beside him, and whose effective entrance argued no\r\nlittle practice and experience. She was of a type that catches the eye\r\ninvoluntarily and holds it,--tall, well-rounded, fresh-complexioned,\r\nwith heavy coils of shimmering gold hair. Her pawn, which was far\r\nfrom unbecoming, was in keeping with those gifts with which nature had\r\nendowed her. She carried her head high, and bestowed swift and evidently\r\nfatal glances to right and left during her progress through the room.\r\nMr. Bixby's voice roused the storekeeper from this contemplation of the\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n“That's Alvy Hopkins of Gosport and his daughter. Fine gal, hain't she?\r\nEver sense she come down here t'other day she's stirred up more turmoil\r\nthan any railroad bill I ever seed. She was most suffocated at the\r\ngovernor's ball with fellers tryin' to get dances--some of 'em old\r\nfellers, too. And you understand about Alvy?”\r\n\r\n“What about him?”\r\n\r\n“Alvy says he's a-goin' to be the next governor, or fail up.” Mr.\r\nBixby's voice sank to a whisper, and he spoke into Mr. Wetherell's ear.\r\n“Alvy says he has twenty-five thousand dollars to put in if necessary.\r\nI'll introduce you to him, Will,” he added meaningly. “Guess you can\r\nhelp him some--you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bixby!” cried Mr. Wetherell, putting down his knife and fork.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Mr. Bixby, reassuringly; “'twon't be no bother. I know him\r\nas well as I do you--call each other by our given names. Guess I was the\r\nfirst man he sent for last spring. He knows I go through all them river\r\ntowns. He says, 'Bije, you get 'em.' I understood.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell began to realize the futility of trying to convince\r\nMr. Bixby of his innocence in political matters, and glanced at Jethro.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't think he was listenin', would you, Will?” Mr. Bixby\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“Listening?”\r\n\r\n“Ears are sharp as a dog's. Callate he kin hear as far as the governor's\r\ntable, and he don't look as if he knows anything. One way he built up\r\nhis power--listenin' when they're talkin' sly out there in the rotunda.\r\nThey're almighty surprised when they l'arn he knows what they're up to.\r\nGuess you understand how to go along by quiet and listen when they're\r\ntalkin' sly.”\r\n\r\n“I never did such a thing in my life,” cried William Wetherell,\r\nindignantly aghast.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bixby winked.\r\n\r\n“So long, Will,” he said, “see you in Number 7.”\r\n\r\nNever, since the days of Pompadour and Du Barry, until modern American\r\npolitics were invented, has a state been ruled from such a place as\r\nNumber 7 in the Pelican House--familiarly known as the Throne Room. In\r\nthis historic cabinet there were five chairs, a marble-topped table,\r\na pitcher of iced water, a bureau, a box of cigars and a Bible, a\r\nchandelier with all the gas jets burning, and a bed, whereon sat such\r\ndignitaries as obtained an audience,--railroad presidents, governors and\r\nex-governors and prospective governors, the Speaker, the President of\r\nthe Senate, Bijah Bixby, Peleg Hartington, mighty chiefs from the North\r\nCountry, and lieutenants from other parts of the state. These sat on the\r\nbed by preference. Jethro sat in a chair by the window, and never took\r\nany part in the discussions that raged, but listened. Generally there\r\nwas some one seated beside him who talked persistently in his ear; as at\r\npresent, for instance, Mr. Chauncey Weed, Chairman of the Committee on\r\nCorporations of the House, who took the additional precaution of putting\r\nhis hand to his mouth when he spoke.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen Merrill was in the Throne Room that evening, and\r\nconfidentially explained to the bewildered William Wetherell the exact\r\nsituation in the Truro Franchise fight. Inasmuch as it has become our\r\nduty to describe this celebrated conflict,--in a popular and engaging\r\nmanner, if possible,--we shall have to do so through Mr. Wetherell's\r\neyes, and on his responsibility. The biographies of some of\r\nthe gentlemen concerned have since been published, and for some\r\nunaccountable reason contain no mention of the Truro franchise.\r\n\r\n“All Gaul,” said Mr. Merrill--he was speaking to a literary man--“all\r\nGaul is divided into five railroads. I am one, the Grand Gulf and\r\nNorthern, the impecunious one. That is the reason I'm so nice to\r\neverybody, Mr. Wetherell. The other day a conductor on my road had\r\na shock of paralysis when a man paid his fare. Then there's Batch,\r\npresident of the 'Down East' road, as we call it. Batch and I are out\r\nof this fight,--we don't care whether Isaac D. Worthington gets his\r\nfranchise or not, or I wouldn't be telling you this. The two railroads\r\nwhich don't want him to get it, because the Truro would eventually\r\nbecome a competitor with them, are the Central and the Northwestern.\r\nAlexander Duncan is president of the Central.”\r\n\r\n“Alexander Duncan!” exclaimed Wetherell. “He's the richest man in the\r\nstate, isn't he?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Merrill, “and he lives in a big square house right here\r\nin the capital. He ain't a bad fellow, Duncan. You'd like him. He loves\r\nbooks. I wish you could see his library.”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid there's not much chance of that,” answered Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Well, as I say, there's Duncan, of the Central, and the other is\r\nLovejoy, of the Northwestern. Lovejoy's a bachelor and a skinflint.\r\nThose two, Duncan and Lovejoy, are using every means in their power\r\nto prevent Worthington from getting that franchise. Have I made myself\r\nclear?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think Mr. Worthington will get it?” asked Wetherell, who had in\r\nmind a certain nocturnal visit at his store.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill almost leaped out of his chair at the question. Then he\r\nmopped his face, and winked very deliberately at the storekeeper. Then\r\nMr. Merrill laughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” he said, “for a man who comes down here to stay with\r\nJethro Bass to ask me that!” Whereupon Mr. Wetherell flushed, and began\r\nto perspire himself. “Didn't you hear Isaac D. Worthington's virtuous\r\nappeal to the people at Brampton?” said Mr. Merrill.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Wetherell, getting redder.\r\n\r\n“I like you, Will,” said Mr. Merrill, unexpectedly, “darned if I don't.\r\nI'll tell you what I know about it, and you can have a little fun while\r\nyou're here, lookin' on, only it won't do to write about it to the\r\nNewcastle Guardian. Guess Willard wouldn't publish it, anyhow. I\r\nsuppose you know that Jethro pulls the strings, end we little railroad\r\npresidents dance. We're the puppets now, but after a while, when I'm\r\ncrowded out, all these little railroads will get together and\r\nthere'll be a row worth looking at, or I'm mistaken. But to go back to\r\nWorthington,” continued Mr. Merrill, “he made a little mistake with\r\nhis bill in the beginning. Instead of going to Jethro, he went to Heth\r\nSutton, and Heth got the bill as far as the Committee on Corporations,\r\nand there she's been ever since, with our friend Chauncey Weed, who's\r\nwhispering over there.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sutton couldn't even get it out of the Committee!” exclaimed\r\nWetherell.\r\n\r\n“Not an inch. Jethro saw this thing coming about a year ago, and he took\r\nthe precaution to have Chauncey Weed and the rest of the Committee in\r\nhis pocket--and of course Heth Sutton's always been there.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell thought of that imposing and manly personage, the\r\nHonorable Heth Sutton, being in Jethro's pocket, and marvelled.\r\nMr. Chauncey Weed seemed of a species better able to thrive in the\r\natmosphere of pockets.\r\n\r\n“Well, as I say, there was the Truro Franchise Bill sound asleep in the\r\nCommittee, and when Isaac D. Worthington saw that his little arrangement\r\nwith Heth Sutton wasn't any good, and that the people of the state\r\ndidn't have anything more to say about it than the Crow Indians, and\r\nthat the end of the session was getting nearer and nearer, he got\r\ndesperate and went to Jethro, I suppose. You know as well as I do that\r\nJethro has agreed to put the bill through.”\r\n\r\n“Then why doesn't he get the Committee to report it and put it through?”\r\n asked Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Bless your simple literary nature,” exclaimed Mr Merrill, “Jethro's\r\ngot more power than any man in the state, but that isn't saying that he\r\ndoesn't have to fight occasionally. He has to fight now. He has seven\r\nof the twelve senators hitched, and the governor. But Duncan and Lovejoy\r\nhave bought up all the loose blocks of representatives, and it is\r\nsupposed that the franchise forces only control a quorum. The end of the\r\nsession is a week off, and never in all my experience have I seen a more\r\npraiseworthy attendance on the part of members.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that they are being paid to remain in their seats?” cried\r\nthe amazed Mr. Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered Mr. Merrill, with a twinkle in his eye, “that is a\r\nlittle bald and--and unparliamentary, perhaps, but fairly accurate. Our\r\nfriend Jethro is confronted with a problem to tax even his faculties,\r\nand to look at him, a man wouldn't suspect he had a care in the world.”\r\n\r\nJethro was apparently quite as free from anxiety the next morning when\r\nhe offered, after breakfast, to show Wetherell and Cynthia the sights of\r\nthe town, though Wetherell could not but think that the Throne Room and\r\nthe Truro Franchise Bill were left at a very crucial moment to take care\r\nof themselves. Jethro talked to Cynthia--or rather, Cynthia talked to\r\nJethro upon innumerable subject's; they looked upon the statue of a\r\ngreat statesman in the park, and Cynthia read aloud the quotation graven\r\non the rock of the pedestal, “The People's Government, made for the\r\nPeople, made by the People, and answerable to the People.” After that\r\nthey went into the state library, where Wetherell was introduced to the\r\nlibrarian, Mr. Storrow. They did not go into the State House because, as\r\neverybody knows, Jethro Bass never went there. Mr. Bijah Bixby and other\r\nlieutenants might be seen in the lobbies, and the governor might sign\r\nbills in his own apartment there, but the real seat of government was\r\nthat Throne Room into which we have been permitted to enter.\r\n\r\nThey walked out beyond the outskirts of the town, where there was a\r\ngrove or picnic ground which was also used as a park by some of the\r\ninhabitants. Jethro liked the spot, and was in the habit sometimes of\r\ntaking refuge there when the atmosphere of the Pelican House became too\r\nthick. The three of them had sat down on one of the board benches to\r\nrest, when presently two people were seen at a little distance walking\r\namong the trees, and the sight of them, for some reason, seemed to give\r\nJethro infinite pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Why,” exclaimed Cynthia, “one of them is that horrid girl everybody was\r\nlooking at in the dining room last night.”\r\n\r\n“D-don't like her, Cynthy?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cynthia, “I don't.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty--hain't she--pretty?”\r\n\r\n“She's brazen,” declared Cynthia.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, Miss Cassandra Hopkins, daughter of that Honorable Alva\r\nwho--according to Mr. Bixby was all ready with a certain sum of money to\r\nbe the next governor. Miss Cassandra was arrayed fluffily in cool, pink\r\nlawn, and she carried a fringed parasol, and she was gazing upward with\r\ntelling effect into the face of the gentleman by her side. This\r\nwould have all been very romantic if the gentleman had been young and\r\nhandsome, but he was certainly not a man to sweep a young girl off\r\nher feet. He was tall, angular, though broad-shouldered, with a long,\r\nscrawny neck that rose out of a very low collar, and a large head,\r\nscantily covered with hair--a head that gave a physical as well as a\r\nmental effect of hardness. His smooth-shaven face seemed to bear witness\r\nthat its owner was one who had pushed frugality to the borders of a\r\nvice. It was not a pleasant face, but now it wore an almost benign\r\nexpression under the influence of Miss Cassandra's eyes. So intent,\r\napparently, were both of them upon each other that they did not notice\r\nthe group on the bench at the other side of the grove. William Wetherell\r\nventured to ask Jethro who the man was.\r\n\r\n“N-name's Lovejoy,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Lovejoy!” ejaculated the storekeeper, thinking of what Mr. Merrill had\r\ntold him of the opponents of the Truro Franchise Bill. “President of the\r\n'Northwestern' Railroad?”\r\n\r\nJethro gave his friend a shrewd look.\r\n\r\n“G-gettin' posted--hain't you, Will?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Is she going to marry that old man?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nJethro smiled a little. “G-guess not,” said he, “g-guess not, if the old\r\nman can help it. Nobody's married him yet, and hain't likely to.”\r\n\r\nJethro was unusually silent on the way back to the hotel, but he did\r\nnot seem to be worried or displeased. He only broke his silence once,\r\nin fact, when Cynthia called his attention to a large poster of some\r\nbloodhounds on a fence, announcing the fact in red letters that “Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin” would be given by a certain travelling company at the Opera\r\nHouse the next evening.\r\n\r\n“L-like to go, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Uncle Jethro, do you think we can go?”\r\n\r\n“Never b'en to a show--hev you--never b'en to a show?”\r\n\r\n“Never in my life,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“We'll all go,” said Jethro, and he repeated it once or twice as they\r\ncame to Main Street, seemingly greatly tickled at the prospect. And\r\nthere was the Truro Franchise Bill hanging over him, with only a week\r\nleft of the session, and Lovejoy's and Duncan's men sitting so tight in\r\ntheir seats! William Wetherell could not understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when Mr. Wetherell knocked timidly at Number\r\n7,--drawn thither by an irresistible curiosity,--the door was opened by\r\na portly person who wore a shining silk hat and ample gold watch chain.\r\nThe gentleman had, in fact, just arrived; but he seemed perfectly at\r\nhome as he laid down his hat on the marble-topped bureau, mopped his\r\nface, took a glass of iced water at a gulp, chose a cigar, and sank\r\ndown gradually on the bed. Mr. Wetherell recognized him instantly as the\r\nfather of the celebrated Cassandra.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jethro,” said the gentleman, “I've got to come into the Throne\r\nRoom once a day anyhow, just to make sure you don't forget me--eh?”\r\n\r\n“A-Alvy,” said Jethro, “I want you to shake hands with a particular\r\nfriend of mine, Mr. Will Wetherell of Coniston. Er--Will, the Honorable\r\nAlvy Hopkins of Gosport.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins rose from the bed as gradually as he had sunk down upon it,\r\nand seized Mr. Wetherell's hand impressively. His own was very moist.\r\n\r\n“Heard you was in town, Mr. Wetherell,” he said heartily. “If Jethro\r\ncalls you a particular friend, it means something, I guess. It means\r\nsomething to me, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Will hain't a politician,” said Jethro. “Er--Alvy?”\r\n\r\n“Hello!” said Mr. Hopkins.\r\n\r\n“Er--Will don't talk.”\r\n\r\n“If Jethro had been real tactful,” said the Honorable Alvy, sinking\r\ndown again, “he'd have introduced me as the next governor of the state.\r\nEverybody knows I want to be governor, everybody knows I've got twenty\r\nthousand dollars in the bank to pay for that privilege. Everybody knows\r\nI'm going to be governor if Jethro says so.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was a little taken aback at this ingenuous statement\r\nof the gentleman from Gosport. He looked out of the window through the\r\nfoliage of the park, and his eye was caught by the monument there in\r\nfront of the State House, and he thought of the inscription on the base\r\nof it, “The People's Government.” The Honorable Alva had not mentioned\r\nthe people--undoubtedly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Wetherell, twenty thousand dollars.” He sighed. “Time was\r\nwhen a man could be governor for ten. Those were the good old days--eh,\r\nJethro?”\r\n\r\n“A-Alvy, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin's' comin' to town tomorrow--to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“You don't tell me,” said the Honorable Alva, acquiescing cheerfully\r\nin the change of subject. “We'll go. Pleased to have you, too, Mr.\r\nWetherell.”\r\n\r\n“Alvy,” said Jethro, again, “'Uncle Tom's Cabin' comes to town\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins stopped fanning himself, and glanced at Jethro\r\nquestioningly.\r\n\r\n“A-Alvy, that give you an idea?” said Jethro, mildly.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell looked blank: it gave him no idea whatsoever, except of\r\nlittle Eva and the bloodhounds. For a few moments the Honorable Alva\r\nappeared to be groping, too, and then his face began to crease into a\r\nsmile of comprehension.\r\n\r\n“By Godfrey, Jethro, but you are smart.” he exclaimed, with involuntary\r\ntribute; “you mean buy up the theatre?”\r\n\r\n“C-callate you'll find it's bought up.”\r\n\r\n“You mean pay for it?” said Mr. Hopkins.\r\n\r\n“You've guessed it, Alvy, you've guessed it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins gazed at him in admiration, leaned out of the perpendicular,\r\nand promptly drew from his trousers' pocket a roll of stupendous\r\nproportions. Wetting his thumb, he began to push aside the top bills.\r\n\r\n“How much is it?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nBut Jethro put up his hand.\r\n\r\n“No hurry, Alvy--n-no hurry. H-Honorable Alvy Hopkins of\r\nGosport--p-patron of the theatre. Hain't the first time you've b'en a\r\npatron, Alvy.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” said Mr. Hopkins, solemnly, putting up his money, “I'm much\r\nobliged to you. I'm free to say I'd never have thought of it. If you\r\nain't the all-firedest smartest man in America to-day,--I don't except\r\nany, even General Grant,--then I ain't the next governor of this state.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he lapsed into an even more expressive silence, his face still\r\nglowing.\r\n\r\n“Er--Alvy,” said Jethro presently, “what's the name of your gal?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Hopkins, “I guess you've got me. We did christen her\r\nLily, but she didn't turn out exactly Lily. She ain't the type,” said\r\nMr. Hopkins, slowly, not without a note of regret, and lapsed into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“W-what did you say her name was, Alvy?”\r\n\r\n“I guess her name's Cassandra,” said the Honorable Alva.\r\n\r\n“C-Cassandry?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” he explained a trifle apologetically, “she's kind of\r\ntaken some matters in her own hands, my gal. Didn't like Lily, and it\r\ndidn't seem to fit her anyway, so she called herself Cassandra. Read\r\nit in a book. It means, 'inspirer of love,' or some such poetry, but I\r\ndon't deny that it goes with her better than Lily would.”\r\n\r\n“Sh-she's a good deal of a gal, Alvy--fine-appearin' gal, Alvy.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Jethro, I didn't know you ever looked at a woman. But I\r\nsuppose you couldn't help lookin' at my gal--she does seem to draw men's\r\neyes as if she was magnetized some way.” Mr. Hopkins did not speak as\r\nthough this quality of his daughter gave him unmixed delight. “But she's\r\na good-hearted gal, Cassy is, high-spirited, and I won't deny she's\r\nhandsome and smart.”\r\n\r\n“She'll kind of grace my position when I'm governor. But to tell you the\r\ntruth, Jethro, one old friend to another, durned if I don't wish she was\r\nmarried. It's a terrible thing for a father to say, I know, but I'd feel\r\neasier about her if she was married to some good man who could hold her.\r\nThere's young Joe Turner in Gosport, he'd give his soul to have her,\r\nand he'd do. Cassy says she's after bigger game than Joe. She's\r\nyoung--that's her only excuse. Funny thing happened night before last,”\r\n continued Mr. Hopkins, laughing. “Lovejoy saw her, and he's b'en out\r\nof his head ever since. Al must be pretty near my age, ain't he? Well,\r\nthere's no fool like an old fool.”\r\n\r\n“A-Alvy introduce me to Cassandry sometime will you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly,” answered Mr. Hopkins, heartily, “I'll bring her in\r\nhere. And now how about gettin' an adjournment to-morrow night for\r\n'Uncle Tom's Cabin'? These night sessions kind of interfere.”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when the representatives were pouring into the\r\nrotunda for dinner, a crowd was pressing thickly around the desk to read\r\na placard pinned on the wall above it. The placard announced the coming\r\nof Mr. Glover's Company for the following night, and that the Honorable\r\nAlva Hopkins of Gosport, ex-Speaker of the House, had bought three\r\nhundred and twelve seats for the benefit of the members. And the\r\nHonorable Alva himself, very red in the face and almost smothered, could\r\nbe dimly discerned at the foot of the stairs trying to fight his way\r\nout of a group of overenthusiastic friends and admirers. Alva--so it was\r\nsaid on all sides--was doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nSo it was that one sensation followed another at the capital, and the\r\npoliticians for the moment stopped buzzing over the Truro Franchise Bill\r\nto discuss Mr. Hopkins and his master-stroke. The afternoon Chronicle\r\nwaxed enthusiastic on the subject of Mr. Hopkins's generosity, and\r\npredicted that, when Senator Hartington made the motion in the upper\r\nhouse and Mr. Jameson in the lower, the General Court would unanimously\r\nagree that there would be no evening session on the following day. The\r\nHonorable Alva was the hero of the hour.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Cynthia and her father walked through the green park to\r\nmake their first visit to the State House. They stood hand in hand on\r\nthe cool, marble-paved floor of the corridor, gazing silently at the\r\nstained and battered battle-flags behind the glass, and Wetherell seemed\r\nto be listening again to the appeal of a great President to a great\r\nCountry in the time of her dire need--the soul calling on the body to\r\nfight for itself. Wetherell seemed to feel again the thrill he felt when\r\nhe saw the blue-clad men of this state crowded in the train at Boston:\r\nand to hear again the cheers, and the sobs, and the prayers as he looked\r\nupon the blood that stained stars and stripes alike with a holy stain.\r\nWith that blood the country had been consecrated, and the state--yes,\r\nand the building where they stood. So they went on up the stairs,\r\nreverently, nor heeded the noise of those in groups about them, and\r\nthrough a door into the great hall of the representatives of the state.\r\n\r\nLife is a mixture of emotions, a jumble of joy and sorrow and reverence\r\nand mirth and flippancy, of right feeling and heresy. In the morning\r\nWilliam Wetherell had laughed at Mr. Hopkins and the twenty thousand\r\ndollars he had put in the bank to defraud the people; but now he could\r\nhave wept over it, and as he looked down upon the three hundred members\r\nof that House, he wondered how many of them represented their neighbors\r\nwho supposedly had sent them here--and how many Mr. Lovejoy's railroad,\r\nMr. Worthington's railroad, or another man's railroad.\r\n\r\nBut gradually he forgot the battle-flags, and his mood changed. Perhaps\r\nthe sight of Mr. Speaker Sutton towering above the House, the very\r\nessence and bulk of authority, brought this about. He aroused in\r\nWetherell unwilling admiration and envy when he arose to put a question\r\nin his deep voice, or rapped sternly with his gavel to silence the\r\ntumult of voices that arose from time to time; or while some member was\r\nspeaking, or the clerk was reading a bill at breathless speed, he\r\nturned with wonderful nonchalance to listen to the conversation of the\r\ngentlemen on the bench beside him, smiled, nodded, pulled his whiskers,\r\nat once conscious and unconscious of his high position. And, most\r\nremarkable of all to the storekeeper, not a man of the three hundred,\r\nhowever obscure, could rise that the Speaker did not instantly call him\r\nby name.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was occupied by such reflections as these when\r\nsuddenly there fell a hush through the House. The clerk had stopped\r\nreading, the Speaker had stopped conversing, and, seizing his gavel,\r\nlooked expectantly over the heads of the members and nodded. A sleek,\r\ncomfortably dressed mail arose smilingly in the middle of the House, and\r\nsubdued laughter rippled from seat to seat as he addressed the chair.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jameson of Wantage.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jameson cleared his throat impressively and looked smilingly about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the House,” he said, “if I desired to\r\narouse the enthusiasm--the just enthusiasm--of any gathering in this\r\nHouse, or in this city, or in this state, I should mention the name of\r\nthe Honorable Alva Hopkins of Gosport. I think I am right.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jameson was interrupted, as he no doubt expected, by applause from\r\nfloor and gallery. He stood rubbing his hands together, and it seemed to\r\nWilliam Wetherell that the Speaker did not rap as sharply with his gavel\r\nas he had upon other occasions.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen of the House,” continued Mr. Jameson, presently, “the\r\nHonorable Alva Hopkins, whom we all know and love, has with unparalleled\r\ngenerosity--unparalleled, I say--bought up three hundred and twelve\r\nseats in Fosters Opera House for to-morrow night” (renewed applause),\r\n“in order that every member of this august body may have the opportunity\r\nto witness that most classic of histrionic productions, 'Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin'.” (Loud applause, causing the Speaker to rap sharply.) “That\r\nwe may show a proper appreciation of this compliment--I move you, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, that the House adjourn not later than six o'clock to-morrow,\r\nWednesday evening, not to meet again until Thursday morning.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jameson of Wantage handed the resolution to a page and sat down\r\namidst renewed applause. Mr. Wetherell noticed that many members turned\r\nin their seats as they clapped, and glancing along the gallery he caught\r\na flash of red and perceived the radiant Miss Cassandra herself leaning\r\nover the rail, her hands clasped in ecstasy. Mr. Lovejoy was not with\r\nher--he evidently preferred to pay his attentions in private.\r\n\r\n“There she is again,” whispered Cynthia, who had taken an instinctive\r\nand extraordinary dislike to Miss Cassandra. Then Mr. Sutton rose\r\nmajestically to put the question.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, are you ready for the question?” he cried. “All those in\r\nfavor of the resolution of the gentleman from Wantage, Mr. Jameson--”\r\n the Speaker stopped abruptly. The legislators in the front seats\r\nswung around, and people in the gallery craned forward to see a member\r\nstanding at his seat in the extreme rear of the hall. He was a little\r\nman in an ill-fitting coat, his wizened face clean-shaven save for the\r\nbroom-shaped beard under his chin, which he now held in his hand. His\r\nthin, nasal voice was somehow absurdly penetrating as he addressed\r\nthe chair. Mr. Sutton was apparently, for once, taken by surprise, and\r\nstared a moment, as though racking his brain for the name.\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Suffolk, Mr. Heath,” he said, and smiling a little,\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Suffolk, still holding on to his beard, pitched in\r\nwithout preamble.\r\n\r\n“We farmers on the back seats don't often get a chance to be heard, Mr.\r\nSpeaker,” said he, amidst a general tittering from the front seats. “We\r\ncome down here without any l'arnin' of parli'ment'ry law, and before we\r\nknow what's happened the session's over, and we hain't said nothin'.”\r\n (More laughter.) “There's b'en a good many times when I wanted to say\r\nsomethin', and this time I made up my mind I was a-goin' to--law or no\r\nlaw.”\r\n\r\n(Applause, and a general show of interest in the gentleman from\r\nSuffolk.) “Naow, Mr. Speaker, I hain't ag'in' 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' It's\r\na good play, and it's done an almighty lot of good. And I hain't sayin'\r\nnothin' ag'in' Alvy Hopkins nor his munificence. But I do know there's a\r\nsight of little bills on that desk that won't be passed if we don't set\r\nto-morrow night--little bills that are big bills for us farmers. That\r\nthar woodchuck bill, for one.” (Laughter.) “My constituents want I\r\nshould have that bill passed. We don't need a quorum for them bills, but\r\nwe need time. Naow, Mr. Speaker, I say let all them that wants to go and\r\nsee 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' go and see it, but let a few of us fellers that\r\nhas woodchuck bills and other things that we've got to get through come\r\ndown here and pass 'em. You kin put 'em on the docket, and I guess if\r\nanything comes along that hain't jest right for everybody, somebody can\r\nchallenge a quorum and bust up the session. That's all.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Suffolk sat down amidst thunderous applause, and\r\nbefore it died away Mr. Jameson was on his feet, smiling and rubbing his\r\nhands together, and was recognized.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Speaker,” he said, as soon as he could be heard, “if the gentleman\r\nfrom Suffolk desires to pass woodchuck bills” (renewed laughter), “he\r\ncan do so as far as I'm concerned. I guess I know where most of the\r\nmembers of this House will be to-morrow night-” (Cries of 'You're\r\nright', and sharp rapping of the gavel.) “Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my\r\nresolution.”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Wantage,” said the Speaker, smiling broadly now,\r\n“withdraws his resolution.”\r\n\r\nAs William Wetherell was returning to the Pelican House, pondering over\r\nthis incident, he almost ran into a distinguished-looking man walking\r\nbriskly across Main Street.\r\n\r\n“It was Mr. Worthington!” said Cynthia, looking after him.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Worthington had a worried look on his face, and was probably too\r\nmuch engrossed in his own thoughts to notice his acquaintances. He had,\r\nin fact, just come from the Throne Room, where he had been to remind\r\nJethro that the session was almost over, and to ask him what he meant to\r\ndo about the Truro Bill. Jethro had given him no satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Duncan and Lovejoy have their people paid to sit there night and day,”\r\n Mr. Worthington had said. “We've got a bare majority on a full House;\r\nbut you don't seem to dare to risk it. What are you going to do about\r\nit, Mr. Bass?”\r\n\r\n“W-want the bill to pass--don't you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” Mr. Worthington had cried, on the edge of losing his\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\n“L-left it to me--didn't you?\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I'm entitled to know what's being done. I'm paying for it.”\r\n\r\n“H-hain't paid for it yet--hev you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I most assuredly haven't.”\r\n\r\n“B-better wait till you do.”\r\n\r\nThere was very little satisfaction in this, and Mr. Worthington had at\r\nlength been compelled to depart, fuming, to the house of his friend the\r\nenemy, Mr. Duncan, there to attempt for the twentieth time to persuade\r\nMr. Duncan to call off his dogs who were sitting with such praiseworthy\r\npertinacity in their seats. As the two friends walked on the lawn, Mr.\r\nWorthington tried to explain, likewise for the twentieth time, that\r\nthe extension of the Truro Railroad could in no way lessen the Canadian\r\ntraffic of the Central, Mr. Duncan's road. But Mr. Duncan could not see\r\nit that way, and stuck to his present ally, Mr. Lovejoy, and refused\r\npoint-blank to call off his dogs. Business was business.\r\n\r\nIt is an apparently inexplicable fact, however, that Mr. Worthington\r\nand his son Bob were guests at the Duncan mansion at the capital. Two\r\ncountries may not be allies, but their sovereigns may be friends. In\r\nthe present instance, Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington's railroads were\r\nopposed, diplomatically, but another year might see the Truro Railroad\r\nand the Central acting as one. And Mr. Worthington had no intention\r\nwhatever of sacrificing Mr. Duncan's friendship. The first citizen\r\nof Brampton possessed one quality so essential to greatness--that of\r\nlooking into the future, and he believed that the time would come when\r\nan event of some importance might create a perpetual alliance between\r\nhimself and Mr. Duncan. In short, Mr. Duncan had a daughter, Janet, and\r\nMr. Worthington, as we know, had a son. And Mr. Duncan, in addition\r\nto his own fortune, had married one of the richest heiresses in New\r\nEngland. Prudens futuri, that was Mr. Worthington's motto.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Cynthia, who was walking about the town alone, found\r\nherself gazing over a picket fence at a great square house with a very\r\nwide cornice that stood by itself in the centre of a shade-flecked lawn.\r\nThere were masses of shrubbery here and there, and a greenhouse, and a\r\nlatticed summer-house: and Cynthia was wondering what it would be like\r\nto live in a great place like that, when a barouche with two shining\r\nhorses in silver harness drove past her and stopped before the gate.\r\nFour or five girls and boys came laughing out on the porch, and one of\r\nthem, who held a fishing-rod in his hand, Cynthia recognized. Startled\r\nand ashamed, she began to walk on as fast as she could in the opposite\r\ndirection, when she heard the sound of footsteps on the lawn behind her,\r\nand her own name called in a familiar voice. At that she hurried the\r\nfaster; but she could not run, and the picket fence was half a block\r\nlong, and Bob Worthington had an advantage over her. Of course it was\r\nBob, and he did not scruple to run, and in a few seconds he was leaning\r\nover the fence in front of her. Now Cynthia was as red as a peony by\r\nthis time, and she almost hated him.\r\n\r\n“Well, of all people, Cynthia Wetherell!” he cried; “didn't you hear me\r\ncalling after you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Why didn't you stop?”\r\n\r\n“I didn't want to,” said Cynthia, glancing at the distant group on the\r\nporch, who were watching them. Suddenly she turned to him defiantly. “I\r\ndidn't know you were in that house, or in the capital,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And I didn't know you were,” said Bob, upon whose masculine\r\nintelligence the meaning of her words was entirely lost. “If I had known\r\nit, you can bet I would have looked you up. Where are you staying?”\r\n\r\n“At the Pelican House.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Bob, “with all the politicians? How did you happen to go\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass asked my father and me to come down for a few days,” answered\r\nCynthia, her color heightening again. Life is full of contrasts, and\r\nCynthia was becoming aware of some of them.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro?” said Bob.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Uncle Jethro,” said Cynthia, smiling in spite of herself. He\r\nalways made her smile.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro owns the Pelican House,” said Bob.\r\n\r\n“Does he? I knew he was a great man, but I didn't know how great he was\r\nuntil I came down here.”\r\n\r\nCynthia said this so innocently that Bob repented his flippancy on the\r\nspot. He had heard occasional remarks of his elders about Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I didn't mean quite that,” he said, growing red in his turn. “Uncle\r\nJethro--Mr. Bass--is a great man of course. That's what I meant.”\r\n\r\n“And he's a very good man,” said Cynthia, who understood now that he had\r\nspoken a little lightly of Jethro, and resented it.\r\n\r\n“I'm sure of it,” said Bob, eagerly. Then Cynthia began to walk on,\r\nslowly, and he followed her on the other side of the fence. “Hold on,”\r\n he cried, “I haven't said half the things I want to say--yet.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want to say?” asked Cynthia, still walking. “I have to go.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, you don't! Wait just a minute--won't you?”\r\n\r\nCynthia halted, with apparent unwillingness, and put out her toe between\r\nthe pickets. Then she saw that there was a little patch on that toe, and\r\ndrew it in again.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to say?” she repeated. “I don't believe you have\r\nanything to say at all.” And suddenly she flashed a look at him that\r\nmade his heart thump.\r\n\r\n“I do--I swear I do!” he protested. “I'm coming down to the Pelican\r\nto-morrow morning to get you to go for a walk.”\r\n\r\nCynthia could not but think that the remoteness of the time he set was\r\nscarce in keeping with his ardent tone.\r\n\r\n“I have something else to do to-morrow morning,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Then I'll come to-morrow afternoon,” said Bob, instantly.\r\n\r\n“Who lives here?” she asked irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Duncan. I'm visiting the Duncans.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a carryall joined the carriage at the gate. Cynthia\r\nglanced at the porch again. The group there had gown larger, and they\r\nwere still staring. She began to feel uncomfortable again, and moved on\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n“Mayn't I come?” asked Bob, going after her; and scraping the butt of\r\nthe rod along the palings.\r\n\r\n“Aren't there enough girls here to satisfy you?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“They're enough--yes,” he said, “but none of 'em could hold a candle to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“I believe you tell them all something like that,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I don't do any such thing,” he retorted, and then he laughed himself,\r\nand Cynthia laughed again.\r\n\r\n“I like you because you don't swallow everything whole,” said Bob,\r\n“and--well, for a good many other reams.” And he looked into her face\r\nwith such frank admiration that Cynthia blushed and turned away.\r\n\r\n“I don't believe a word you say,” she answered, and started to walk off,\r\nthis time in earnest.\r\n\r\n“Hold on,” cried Bob. They were almost at the end of the fence by this,\r\nand the pickets were sharp and rather high, or he would have climbed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCynthia paused hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“I'll come at two o'clock to-morrow,” said he; “We're going on a picnic\r\nto-day, to Dalton's Bend, on the river. I wish I could get out of it.”\r\n\r\nJust then there came a voice from the gateway.\r\n\r\n“Bob! Bob Worthington!”\r\n\r\nThey both turned involuntarily. A slender girl with light brown hair was\r\nstanding there, waving at him.\r\n\r\n“Who's that?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“That?” said Bob, in some confusion, “oh, that's Janet Duncan.”\r\n\r\n“Good-by,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“I'm coming to-morrow,” he called after her, but she did not turn. In\r\na little while she heard the carryall behind her clattering down the\r\nstreet, its passengers laughing and joking merrily. Her face burned,\r\nfor she thought that they were laughing at her; she wished with all\r\nher heart that she had not stopped to talk with him at the palings.\r\nThe girls, indeed, were giggling as the carryall passed, and she heard\r\nsomebody call out his name, but nevertheless he leaned out of the seat\r\nand waved his hat at her, amid a shout of laughter. Poor Cynthia! She\r\ndid not look at him. Tears of vexation were in her eyes, and the light\r\nof her joy at this visit to the capital flickered, and she wished she\r\nwere back in Coniston. She thought it would be very nice to be rich, and\r\nto live in a great house in a city, and to go on picnics.\r\n\r\nThe light flickered, but it did not wholly go out. If it has not been\r\nshown that Cynthia was endowed with a fair amount of sense, many of\r\nthese pages have been written in vain. She sat down for a while in the\r\npark and thought of the many things she had to be thankful for--not the\r\nleast of which was Jethro's kindness. And she remembered that she was to\r\nsee “Uncle Tom's Cabin” that evening.\r\n\r\nSuch are the joys and sorrows of fifteen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMr. Amos Cuthbert named it so--our old friend Amos who lives high up in\r\nthe ether of Town's End ridge, and who now represents Coniston in the\r\nLegislature. He is the same silent, sallow person as when Jethro first\r\ntook a mortgage on his farm, only his skin is beginning to resemble\r\ndried parchment, and he is a trifle more cantankerous. On the morning of\r\nthat memorable day when, “Uncle Tom's Cabin” came to the capital, Amos\r\nhad entered the Throne Room and given vent to his feelings in regard to\r\nthe gentleman in the back seat who had demanded an evening sitting on\r\nbehalf of the farmers.\r\n\r\n“Don't that beat all?” cried Amos. “Let them have their darned\r\nwoodchuck session; there won't nobody go to it. For cussed, crisscross\r\ncontrariness, give me a moss-back Democrat from a one-boss, one-man town\r\nlike Suffolk. I'm a-goin' to see the show.”\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to the show, be you, Amos?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I be,” answered Amos, bitterly. “I hain't agoin' nigh the house\r\nto-night.” And with this declaration he departed.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if he really is going?” queried Mr. Merrill looking at the\r\nceiling. And then he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn't he go?” asked William Wetherell.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill's answer to this question was a wink, whereupon he, too,\r\ndeparted. And while Wetherell was pondering over the possible meaning of\r\nthese words the Honorable Alva Hopkins entered, wreathed in smiles, and\r\nclosed the door behind him.\r\n\r\n“It's all fixed,” he said, taking a seat near Jethro in the window.\r\n\r\n“S-seen your gal--Alvy--seen your gal?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins gave a glance at Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Will don't talk,” said Jethro, and resumed his inspection through the\r\nlace curtains of what was going on in the street.\r\n\r\n“Cassandry's, got him to go,” said Mr. Hopkins. “It's all fixed, as sure\r\nas Sunday. If it misses fire, then I'll never mention the governorship\r\nagain. But if it don't miss fire,” and the Honorable Alva leaned over\r\nand put his hand on Jethro's knee, “if it don't miss fire, I get the\r\nnomination. Is that right?”\r\n\r\n“Y-you've guessed it, Alvy.”\r\n\r\n“That's all I want to know,” declared the Honorable Alva; “when you say\r\nthat much, you never go back on it. And, you can go ahead and give the\r\norders, Jethro. I have to see that the boys get the tickets. Cassandry's\r\ngot a head on her shoulders, and she kind of wants to be governor, too.”\r\n He got as far as the door, when he turned and bestowed upon Jethro a\r\nglance of undoubted tribute. “You've done a good many smart things,”\r\n said he, “but I guess you never beat this, and never will.”\r\n\r\n“H-hain't done it yet, Alvy,” answered Jethro, still looking out through\r\nthe window curtains at the ever ganging groups of gentlemen in the\r\nstreet. These groups had a never ceasing interest for Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell didn't talk, but had he been the most incurable of gossips\r\nhe felt that he could have done no damage to this mysterious affair,\r\nwhatever it was. In a certain event, Mr. Hopkins was promised the\r\ngovernorship: so much was plain. And it was also evident that Miss\r\nCassandra Hopkins was in some way to be instrumental. William Wetherell\r\ndid not like to ask Jethro, but he thought a little of sounding Mr.\r\nMerrill, and then he came to the conclusion that it would be wiser for\r\nhim not to know.\r\n\r\n“Er--Will,” said Jethro, presently, “you know Heth Sutton--Speaker Heth\r\nSutton?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Er--wouldn't mind askin' him to step in and see me before the\r\nsession--if he was comin' by--would you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“Er--if he was comin' by,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell found Mr. Speaker Sutton glued to a pillar in the rotunda\r\nbelow. He had some difficulty in breaking through the throng that\r\npressed around him, and still more in attracting his attention, as Mr.\r\nSutton took no manner of notice of the customary form of placing one's\r\nhand under his elbow and pressing gently up. Summoning up his courage,\r\nMr. Wetherell tried the second method of seizing him by the buttonhole.\r\nHe paused in his harangue, one hand uplifted, and turned and glanced at\r\nthe storekeeper abstractedly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass asked me to tell you to drop into Number 7,” said Wetherell,\r\nand added, remembering express instructions, “if you were going by.”\r\n\r\nWetherell had not anticipated the magical effect this usual message\r\nwould have on Mr. Sutton, nor had he thought that so large and dignified\r\na body would move so rapidly. Before the astonished gentlemen who had\r\npenned him could draw a breath, Mr. Sutton had reached the stairway and,\r\nwas mounting it with an agility that did him credit. Five minutes later\r\nWetherell saw the Speaker descending again, the usually impressive\r\nquality of his face slightly modified by the twitching of a smile.\r\n\r\nThus the day passed, and the gentlemen of the Lovejoy and Duncan\r\nfactions sat, as tight as ever in their seats, and the Truro Franchise\r\nbill still slumbered undisturbed in Mr. Chauncey Weed's committee.\r\n\r\nAt supper there was a decided festal air about the dining room of the\r\nPelican House, the little band of agricultural gentlemen who wished to\r\nhave a session not being patrons of that exclusive hotel. Many of the\r\nSolons had sent home for their wives; that they might do the utmost\r\njustice to the Honorable Alva's hospitality. Even Jethro, as he ate\r\nhis crackers and milk, had a new coat with bright brass buttons, and\r\nCynthia, who wore a fresh gingham which Miss Sukey Kittredge of Coniston\r\nhad helped to design, so far relented in deference to Jethro's taste as\r\nto tie a red bow at her throat.\r\n\r\nThe middle table under the chandelier was the immediate firmament of\r\nMiss Cassandra Hopkins. And there, beside the future governor, sat the\r\npresident of the “Northwestern” Railroad, Mr. Lovejoy, as the chief\r\nof the revolving satellites. People began to say that Mr. Lovejoy was\r\nhooked at last, now that he had lost his head in such an unaccountable\r\nfashion as to pay his court in public; and it was very generally known\r\nthat he was to make one of the Honorable Alva's immediate party at the\r\nperformance of “Uncle Tam's Cabin.”\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker Sutton, of course, would have to forego the pleasure of\r\nthe theatre as a penalty of his high position. Mr. Merrill, who sat at\r\nJethro's table next to Cynthia that evening, did a great deal of\r\njoking with the Honorable Heth about having to preside aver a\r\nwoodchuck session, which the Speaker, so Mr. Wetherell thought, took\r\nin astonishingly good part, and seemed very willing to make the great\r\nsacrifice which his duty required of him.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Mr. Wetherell took a seat in the rotunda. As an observer of\r\nhuman nature, he had begun to find a fascination in watching the group\r\nof politicians there. First of all he encountered Mr. Amos Cuthbert,\r\nhis little coal-black eyes burning brightly, and he was looking very\r\nirritable indeed.\r\n\r\n“So you're going to the show, Amos?” remarked the storekeeper, with an\r\nattempt at cordiality.\r\n\r\nTo his bewilderment, Amos turned upon him fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Who said I was going to the show?” he snapped.\r\n\r\n“You yourself told me.”\r\n\r\n“You'd ought to know whether I'm a-goin' or not,” said Amos, and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Wetherell sat meditating, upon this inexplicable retort,\r\na retired, scholarly looking gentleman with a white beard, who wore\r\nspectacles, came out of the door leading from the barber shop and\r\nquietly took a seat beside him. The storekeeper's attention was next\r\ndistracted by the sight of one who wandered slowly but ceaselessly from\r\ngroup to group, kicking up his heels behind, and halting always in the\r\nrear of the speakers. Needless to say that this was our friend Mr. Bijah\r\nBixby, who was following out his celebrated tactics of “going along by\r\nwhen they were talkin' sly.” Suddenly Mr. Bixby's eye alighted on Mr.\r\nWetherell, who by a stretch of imagination conceived that it expressed\r\nboth astonishment and approval, although he was wholly at a loss to\r\nunderstand these sentiments. Mr. Bixby winked--Mr. Wetherell was sure\r\nof that. But to his surprise, Bijah did not pause in his rounds to greet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell was beginning to be decidedly uneasy, and was about to\r\ngo upstairs, when Mr. Merrill came down the rotunda whistling, with\r\nhis hands in his pockets. He stopped whistling when he spied the\r\nstorekeeper, and approached him in his usual hearty manner.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, this is fortunate,” said Mr. Merrill; “how are you, Duncan?\r\nI want you to know Mr. Wetherell. Wetherell writes that weekly letter\r\nfor the Guardian you were speaking to me about last year. Will, this is\r\nMr. Alexander Duncan, president of the 'Central.'”\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Wetherell?” said the scholarly gentleman with the\r\nspectacles, putting out his hand. “I'm glad to meet you, very glad,\r\nindeed. I read your letters with the greatest pleasure.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell, as he took Mr. Duncan's hand, had a variety of emotions\r\nwhich may be imagined, and need not be set down in particular.\r\n\r\n“Funny thing,” Mr. Merrill continued, “I was looking for you, Duncan. It\r\noccurred to me that you would like to meet Mr. Wetherell. I was afraid\r\nyou were in Boston.”\r\n\r\n“I have just got back,” said Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\n“I wanted Wetherell to see your library. I was telling him about it.”\r\n\r\n“I should be delighted to show it to him,” answered Mr. Duncan. That\r\nlibrary, as is well known, was a special weakness of Mr. Duncan's.\r\n\r\nPoor William Wetherell, who was quite overwhelmed by the fact that the\r\ngreat Mr. Duncan had actually read his letters and liked them, could\r\nscarcely utter a sensible word. Almost before he realized what had\r\nhappened he was following Mr. Duncan out of the Pelican House, when the\r\nstorekeeper was mystified once more by a nudge and another wink from Mr.\r\nBixby, conveying unbounded admiration.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you write a book, Mr. Wetherell?” inquired the railroad\r\npresident, when they were crossing the park.\r\n\r\n“I don't think I could do it,” said Mr. Wetherell, modestly. Such\r\nincense was overpowering, and he immediately forgot Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you can,” said Mr. Duncan, “only you don't know it. Take your\r\nletters for a beginning. You can draw people well enough, when you try.\r\nThere was your description of the lonely hill-farm on the spur--I shall\r\nalways remember that: the gaunt farmer, toiling every minute between sun\r\nand sun; the thin, patient woman bending to a task that never charged or\r\nlightened; the children growing up and leaving one by one, some to the\r\ncities, some to the West, until the old people are left alone in the\r\nevening of life--to the sunsets and the storms. Of course you must write\r\na book.”\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan quoted other letters, and William Wetherell thrilled. Poor\r\nman! he had had little enough incense in his time, and none at all from\r\nthe great. They came to the big square house with the cornice which\r\nCynthia had seen the day before, and walked across the lawn through the\r\nopen door. William Wetherell had a glimpse of a great drawing-room\r\nwith high windows, out of which was wafted the sound of a piano and of\r\nyouthful voice and laughter, and then he was in the library. The thought\r\nof one man owning all those books overpowered him. There they were, in\r\nstately rows, from the floor to the high ceiling, and a portable ladder\r\nwith which to reach them.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan, understanding perhaps something of the storekeeper's\r\nembarrassment, proceeded to take down his treasures: first editions from\r\nthe shelves, and folios and mistrals from drawers in a great iron safe\r\nin one corner and laid them on the mahogany desk. It was the railroad\r\npresident's hobby, and could he find an appreciative guest, he was\r\nhappy. It need scarcely be said that he found William Wetherell\r\nappreciative, and possessed of knowledge of Shaksperiana and other\r\nmatters that astonished his host as well as pleased him. For Wetherell\r\nhad found his tongue at last.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mr. Duncan drew out his watch and gave a start.\r\n\r\n“By George!” he exclaimed, “it's after eight o'clock. I'll have to ask\r\nyou to excuse me to-night, Mr. Wetherell. I'd like to show you the rest\r\nof them--can't you come around to-morrow afternoon?”\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell, who had forgotten his own engagement and “Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin,” said he would be happy to come. And they went out together and\r\nbegan to walk toward the State House.\r\n\r\n“It isn't often I find a man who knows anything at all about these\r\nthings,” continued Mr. Duncan, whose heart was quite won. “Why do you\r\nbury yourself in Coniston?”\r\n\r\n“I went there from Briton for my health,” said the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass lives there, doesn't he” said Mr. Duncan, with a laugh. “But\r\nI suppose you don't know anything about politics.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing at all,” said Mr. Wetherell, which was quite true. He\r\nhad been in dreamland, but now the fact struck him again, with something\r\nof a shock, that this mild-mannered gentleman was one of those who had\r\nbeen paying certain legislators to remain in their seats. Wetherell\r\nthought of speaking to Mr. Duncan of his friendship with Jethro Bass,\r\nbut the occasion passed.\r\n\r\n“I wish to heaven I didn't have to know anything about politics,” Mr.\r\nDuncan was saying; “they disgust me. There's a little matter on now,\r\nabout an extension of the Truro Railroad to Harwich, which wouldn't\r\ninterest you, but you can't conceive what a nuisance it has been to\r\nwatch that House day and night, as I've had to. It's no joke to have\r\nthat townsman of yours; Jethro Bass, opposed to you. I won't say\r\nanything against him, for he many be a friend of yours, and I have to\r\nuse him sometimes myself.” Mr. Duncan sighed. “It's all very sordid and\r\nannoying. Now this evening, for instance, when we might have enjoyed\r\nourselves with those books, I've' got to go to the House, just because\r\nsome backwoods farmers want to talk about woodchucks. I suppose it's\r\nfoolish,” said Mr. Duncan; “but Bass has tricked us so often that I've\r\ngot into the habit of being watchful. I should have been here twenty\r\nminutes ago.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they had come to the entrance of the State House, and\r\nWetherell followed Mr. Duncan in, to have a look at the woodchuck\r\nsession himself. Several members hurried by and up the stairs, some\r\nof them in their Sunday black; and the lobby above seemed, even to the\r\nstorekeeper's unpractised eye, a trifle active for a woodchuck session.\r\nMr. Duncan muttered something, and quickened his gait a little on the\r\nsteps that led to the gallery. This place was almost empty. They went\r\ndown to the rail, and the railroad president cast his eye over the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” he said sharply, “there's almost a quorum here.” He ran his\r\neye over the members. “There is a quorum here.”\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan stood drumming nervously with his fingers on the rail,\r\nscanning the heads below. The members were scattered far and wide\r\nthrough the seats, like an army in open order, listening in silence to\r\nthe droning voice of the clerk. Moths burned in the gas flames, and June\r\nbugs hummed in at the high windows and tilted against the walls. Then\r\nMr. Duncan's finger nails whitened as his thin hands clutched the rail,\r\nand a sense of a pending event was upon Wetherell. Slowly he realized\r\nthat he was listening to the Speaker's deep voice.\r\n\r\n“'The Committee on Corporations, to whom was referred House Bill Number\r\n109, entitled, 'An Act to extend the Truro Railroad to Harwich, having\r\nconsidered the same, report the same with the following resolution:\r\nResolved, that the bill ought to pass. Chauncey Weed, for the\r\nCommittee.'”\r\n\r\nThe Truro Franchise! The lights danced, and even a sudden weakness\r\ncame upon the storekeeper. Jethro's trick! The Duncan and Lovejoy\r\nrepresentatives in the theatre, the adherents of the bill here!\r\nWetherell saw Mr. Duncan beside him, a tense figure leaning on the rail,\r\ncalling to some one below. A man darted up the centre, another up the\r\nside aisle. Then Mr. Duncan flashed at William Wetherell from his blue\r\neye such a look of anger as the storekeeper never forgot, and he, too,\r\nwas gone. Tingling and perspiring, Wetherell leaned out over the railing\r\nas the Speaker rapped calmly for order. Hysteric laughter, mingled with\r\nhoarse cries, ran over the House, but the Honorable Heth Sutton did not\r\neven smile.\r\n\r\nA dozen members were on their feet shouting to the chair. One was\r\nrecognized, and that man Wetherell perceived with amazement to be Mr.\r\nJameson of Wantage, adherent of Jethro's--he who had moved to adjourn\r\nfor “Uncle Tom's Cabin”! A score of members crowded into the aisles, but\r\nthe Speaker's voice again rose above the tumult.\r\n\r\n“The doorkeepers will close the doors! Mr. Jameson of Wantage moves that\r\nthe report of the Committee be accepted, and on this motion a roll-call\r\nis ordered.”\r\n\r\nThe doorkeepers, who must have been inspired, had already slammed the\r\ndoors in the faces of those seeking wildly to escape. The clerk already\r\nhad the little, short-legged desk before him and was calling the roll\r\nwith incredible rapidity. Bewildered and excited as Wetherell was, and\r\nknowing as little of parliamentary law as the gentleman who had proposed\r\nthe woodchuck session, he began to form some sort of a notion of\r\nJethro's generalship, and he saw that the innocent rural members who\r\nbelonged to Duncan and Lovejoy's faction had tried to get away before\r\nthe roll-call, destroy the quorum, and so adjourn the House. These,\r\nneedless to say, were not parliamentarians, either. They had lacked a\r\nleader, they were stunned by the suddenness of the onslaught, and had\r\nnot moved quickly enough. Like trapped animals, they wandered blindly\r\nabout for a few moments, and then sank down anywhere. Each answered the\r\nroll-call sullenly, out of necessity, for every one of them was a marked\r\nman. Then Wetherell remembered the two members who had escaped, and Mr.\r\nDuncan, and fell to calculating how long it would take these to reach\r\nFosters Opera House, break into the middle of an act, and get out enough\r\npartisans to come back and kill the bill. Mr. Wetherell began to wish he\r\ncould witness the scene there, too, but something held him here, shaking\r\nwith excitement, listening to each name that the clerk called.\r\n\r\nWould the people at the theatre get back in time?\r\n\r\nDespite William Wetherell's principles, whatever these may have been,\r\nhe was so carried away that he found himself with his watch in his hand,\r\ncounting off the minutes as the roll-call went on. Fosters Opera House\r\nwas some six squares distant, and by a liberal estimate Mr. Duncan and\r\nhis advance guard ought to get back within twenty minutes of the time he\r\nleft. Wetherell was not aware that people were coming into the gallery\r\nbehind him; he was not aware that one sat at his elbow until a familiar\r\nvoice spoke, directly into his ear.\r\n\r\n“Er--Will--held Duncan pretty tight--didn't you? He's a hard one to\r\nfool, too. Never suspected a mite, did he? Look out for your watch!”\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby seized it or it would have fallen. If his life had depended on\r\nit, William Wetherell could not have spoken a word to Mr. Bixby then.\r\n\r\n“You done well, Will, sure enough,” that gentleman continued to whisper.\r\n“And Alvy's gal done well, too--you understand. I guess she's the only\r\none that ever snarled up Al Lovejoy so that he didn't know where he\r\nwas at. But it took a fine, delicate touch for her job and yours, Will.\r\nGodfrey, this is the quickest roll-call I ever seed! They've got halfway\r\nthrough Truro County. That fellow can talk faster than a side-show,\r\nticket-seller at a circus.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk was, indeed, performing prodigies of pronunciation. When he\r\nreached Wells County, the last, Mr. Bixby so far lost his habitual sang\r\nfroid as to hammer on the rail with his fist.\r\n\r\n“If there hain't a quorum, we're done for,” he said. “How much time has\r\ngone away? Twenty minutes! Godfrey, some of 'em may break loose and git\r\nhere is five minutes!”\r\n\r\n“Break loose?” Wetherell exclaimed involuntarily.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby screwed up his face.\r\n\r\n“You understand. Accidents is liable to happen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell didn't understand in the least, but just then the clerk\r\nreached the last name on the roll; an instant of absolute silence, save\r\nfor the June-bugs, followed, while the assistant clerk ran over his\r\nfigures deftly and handed them to Mr. Sutton, who leaned forward to\r\nreceive them.\r\n\r\n“One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative\r\nand forty-eight in the negative, and the report of the Committee is\r\naccepted.”\r\n\r\n“Ten more'n a quorum!” ejaculated Mr. Bixby, in a voice of thanksgiving,\r\nas the turmoil below began again. It seemed as though every man in the\r\nopposition was on his feet and yelling at the chair: some to adjourn;\r\nsome to indefinitely postpone; some demanding roll-calls; others\r\nswearing at these--for a division vote would have opened the doors.\r\nOthers tried to get out, and then ran down the aisles and called\r\nfiercely on the Speaker to open the doors, and threatened him. But\r\nthe Honorable Heth Sutton did not lose his head, and it may be doubted\r\nwhether he ever appeared to better advantage than at that moment. He had\r\na voice like one of the Clovelly bulls that fed in his own pastures\r\nin the valley, and by sheer bellowing he got silence, or something\r\napproaching it,--the protests dying down to a hum; had recognised\r\nanother friend of the bill, and was putting another question.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gibbs of Wareham moves that the rules of the House be so far\r\nsuspended that this bill be read a second and third time by its title,\r\nand be put upon its final passage at this time. And on this motion,”\r\n thundered Mr. Sutton, above the tide of rising voices, “the yeas and\r\nnays are called for. The doorkeepers will keep the doors shut.”\r\n\r\n“Abbey of Ashburton.”\r\n\r\nThe nimble clerk had begun on the roll almost before the Speaker was\r\nthrough, and checked off the name. Bijah Bixby mopped his brow with a\r\nblue pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“My God,” he said, “what a risk Jethro's took! they can't git through\r\nanother roll-call. Jest look at Heth! Ain't he carryin' it magnificent?\r\nHain't as ruffled as I be. I've knowed him ever sence he wahn't no\r\nhigher'n that desk. Never would have b'en in politics if it hadn't b'en\r\nfor me. Funny thing, Will--you and I was so excited we never thought to\r\nlook at the clock. Put up your watch. Godfrey, what's this?”\r\n\r\nThe noise of many feet was heard behind them. Men and women were\r\ncrowding breathlessly into the gallery.\r\n\r\n“Didn't take it long to git noised araound,” said Mr. Bixby. “Say, Will,\r\nthey're bound to have got at 'em in the thea'tre. Don't see how they\r\nheld 'em off, c-cussed if I do.”\r\n\r\nThe seconds ticked into minutes, the air became stifling, for now the\r\nfront of the gallery was packed. Now, if ever, the fate of the Truro\r\nFranchise hung in the balance, and, perhaps, the rule of Jethro Bass.\r\nAnd now, as in the distance, came a faint, indefinable stir, not yet to\r\nbe identified by Wetherell's ears as a sound, but registered somewhere\r\nin his brain as a warning note. Bijah Bixby, as sensitive as he,\r\nstraightened up to listen, and then the whispering was hushed. The\r\nmembers below raised their heads, and some clutched the seats in front\r\nof them and looked up at the high windows. Only the Speaker sat like a\r\nwax statue of himself, and glanced neither to the right nor to the left.\r\n\r\n“Harkness of Truro,” said the clerk.\r\n\r\n“He's almost to Wells County again,” whispered Bijah, excitedly. “I\r\ndidn't callate he could do it. Will?”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Will--you hear somethin'?”\r\n\r\nA distant shout floated with the night breeze in at the windows; a man\r\non the floor got to his feet and stood straining: a commotion was going\r\non at the back of the gallery, and a voice was heard crying out:--\r\n\r\n“For the love of God, let me through!”\r\n\r\nThen Wetherell turned to see the crowd at the back parting a little, to\r\nsee a desperate man in a gorgeous white necktie fighting his way toward\r\nthe rail. He wore no hat, his collar was wilted, and his normally ashen\r\nface had turned white. And, strangest of all, clutched tightly in his\r\nhand was a pink ribbon.\r\n\r\n“It's Al Lovejoy,” said Bijah, laconically.\r\n\r\nUnmindful of the awe-stricken stares he got from those about him when\r\nhis identity became known, Mr. Lovejoy gained the rail and shoved aside\r\na man who was actually making way for him. Leaning far out, he scanned\r\nthe house with inarticulate rage while the roll-call went monotonously\r\non. Some of the members looked up at him and laughed; others began to\r\nmake frantic signs, indicative of helplessness; still others telegraphed\r\nhim obvious advice about reenforcements which, if anything, increased\r\nhis fury. Mr. Bixby was now fanning himself with the blue handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“I hear 'em!” he said, “I hear 'em, Will!”\r\n\r\nAnd he did. The unmistakable hum of the voices of many men and the sound\r\nof feet on stone flagging shook the silent night without. The clerk read\r\noff the last name on the roll.\r\n\r\n“Tompkins of Ulster.”\r\n\r\nHis assistant lost no time now. A mistake would have been fatal, but he\r\nwas an old hand. Unmindful of the rumble on the wooden stairs below, Mr.\r\nSutton took the list with an admirable deliberation.\r\n\r\n“One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative,\r\nforty-eight in the negative, the rules of the House are suspended, and”\r\n (the clerk having twice mumbled the title of the bill) “the question is:\r\nShall the bill pass? As many as are of opinion that the bill pass will\r\nsay Aye, contrary minded No.”\r\n\r\nFeet were in the House corridor now, and voices rising there, and noises\r\nthat must have been scuffling--yes, and beating of door panels.\r\nAlmost every member was standing, and it seemed as if they were all\r\nshouting,--“personal privilege,” “fraud,” “trickery,” “open the doors.”\r\n Bijah was slowly squeezing the blood out of William Wetherell's arm.\r\n\r\n“The doorkeepers has the keys in their pockets!” Mr. Bixby had to shout,\r\nfor once.\r\n\r\nEven then the Speaker did not flinch. By a seeming miracle he got a\r\nsemblance of order, recognized his man, and his great voice rang through\r\nthe hall and drowned all other sounds.\r\n\r\n“And on this question a roll-call is ordered. The doorkeepers will close\r\nthe doors!”\r\n\r\nThen, as in reaction, the gallery trembled with a roar of laughter.\r\nBut Mr. Sutton did not smile. The clerk scratched off the names with\r\nlightning rapidity, scarce waiting for the answers. Every man's color\r\nwas known, and it was against the rules to be present and fail to vote.\r\nThe noise in the corridors grew louder, some one dealt a smashing kick\r\non a panel, and Wetherell ventured to ask Mr. Bixby if he thought the\r\ndoors would hold.\r\n\r\n“They can break in all they've a mind to now,” he chuckled; “the Truro\r\nFranchise is safe.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Wetherell demanded excitedly.\r\n\r\n“If a member hain't present when a question is put, he can't git into a\r\nroll-call,” said Bijah.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the day was lost was evidently brought home to those\r\nbelow, for the strife subsided gradually, and finally ceased altogether.\r\nThe whispers in the gallery died down, the spectators relayed a little.\r\nLovejoy alone remained tense, though he had seated himself on a\r\nbench, and the hot anger in which he had come was now cooled into a\r\nvindictiveness that set the hard lines of his face even harder. He\r\nstill clutched the ribbon. The last part of that famous roll-call was\r\nconducted so quietly that a stranger entering the House would have\r\nsuspected nothing unusual. It was finished in absolute silence.\r\n\r\n“One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative,\r\nforty-eight in the negative, and the bill passes. The House will attend\r\nto the title of the bill.”\r\n\r\n“An act to extend the Truro Railroad to Harwich,” said the clerk,\r\nglibly.\r\n\r\n“Such will be the title of the bill unless otherwise ordered by the\r\nHouse,” said Mr. Speaker Sutton. “The doorkeepers will open the doors.”\r\n\r\nSomebody moved to adjourn, the motion was carried, and thus ended what\r\nhas gone down to history as the Woodchuck Session. Pandemonium reigned.\r\nOne hundred and forty belated members fought their way in at the\r\nfour entrances, and mingled with them were lobbyists of all sorts and\r\nconditions, residents and visitors to the capital, men and women to whom\r\nthe drama of “Uncle Tom's Cabin” was as nothing to that of the Truro\r\nFranchise Bill. It was a sight to look down upon. Fierce wrangles began\r\nin a score of places, isolated personal remarks rose above the din, but\r\nyour New Englander rarely comes to blows; in other spots men with broad\r\nsmiles seized others by the hands and shook them violently, while Mr.\r\nSpeaker Sutton seemed in danger of suffocation by his friends. His\r\nenemies, for the moment, could get nowhere near him. On this scene Mr.\r\nBijah Bixby gazed with pardonable pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Guess there wahn't a mite of trouble about the river towns,” he said,\r\n“I had 'em in my pocket. Will, let's amble round to the theatre. We\r\nought to git in two acts.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell went. There is no need to go into the psychology\r\nof the matter. It may have been numbness; it may have been temporary\r\ninsanity caused by the excitement of the battle he had witnessed, for\r\nhis brain was in a whirl; or Mr. Bixby may have hypnotized him. As they\r\nwalked through the silent streets toward the Opera House, he listened\r\nperforce to Mr. Bixby's comments upon some of the innumerable details\r\nwhich Jethro had planned and quietly carried out while sitting, in the\r\nwindow of the Throne Room. A great light dawned on William Wetherell,\r\nbut too late.\r\n\r\nJethro's trusted lieutenants (of whom, needless to say, Mr. Bixby\r\nwas one) had been commanded to notify such of their supporters whose\r\nfidelity and secrecy could be absolutely depended upon to attend the\r\nWoodchuck Session; and, further to guard against surprise, this order\r\nhad not gone out until the last minute (hence Mr. Amos Cuthbert's\r\nconduct). The seats of these members at the theatre had been filled by\r\naccommodating townspeople and visitors. Forestalling a possible vote on\r\nthe morrow to recall and reconsider, there remained some sixty members\r\nwhose loyalty was unquestioned, but whose reputation for discretion was\r\nnot of the best. So much for the parliamentary side of the affair, which\r\nwas a revelation of generalship and organization to William Wetherell.\r\nBy the time he had grasped it they were come in view of the lights of\r\nFosters Opera House, and they perceived, among a sprinkling of idlers,\r\na conspicuous and meditative gentleman leaning against a pillar. He was\r\nludicrously tall and ludicrously thin, his hands were in his trousers\r\npockets, and the skirts of his Sunday broadcloth coat hung down behind\r\nhim awry. One long foot was crossed over the other and rested on the\r\npoint of the toe, and his head was tilted to one side. He had, on the\r\nwhole, the appearance of a rather mournful stork. Mr. Bixby approached\r\nhim gravely, seized him by the lower shoulder, and tilted him down until\r\nit was possible to speak into his ear. The gentleman apparently did not\r\nresent this, although he seemed in imminent danger of being upset.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Peleg? Er--you know Will?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby seized Mr. Wetherell under the elbow, and addressed himself to\r\nthe storekeeper's ear.\r\n\r\n“Will, I want you to shake hands with Senator Peleg Hartington,\r\nof Brampton. This is Will Wetherell, Peleg,--from Coniston--you\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nThe senator took one hand from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“How be you?” he said. Mr. Bixby was once more pulling down on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“H-haow was it here?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Almighty funny,” answered Senator Hartington, sadly, and waved at the\r\nlobby. “There wahn't standin' room in the place.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass Republican Club come and packed the entrance,” explained\r\nMr. Bixby with a wink. “You understand, Will? Go on, Peleg.”\r\n\r\n“Sidewalk and street, too,” continued Mr. Hartington, slowly. “First\r\ncome along Ball of Towles, hollerin' like blazes. They crumpled him all\r\nup and lost him. Next come old man Duncan himself.”\r\n\r\n“Will kep' Duncan,” Mr. Bixby interjected.\r\n\r\n“That was wholly an accident,” exclaimed Mr. Wetherell, angrily.\r\n\r\n“Will wahn't born in the country,” said Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington bestowed on the storekeeper a mournful look, and\r\ncontinued:--\r\n\r\n“Never seed Duncan sweatin' before. He didn't seem to grasp why the boys\r\nwas there.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't seem to understand,” put in Mr. Bixby, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“'For God's sake, gentlemen,' says he, 'let me in! The Truro Bill!' 'The\r\nTruro Bill hain't in the theatre, Mr. Duncan,' says Dan Everett.\r\nCussed if I didn't come near laughin'. 'That's “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” Mr.\r\nDuncan,' says Dan. 'You're a dam fool,' says Duncan. I didn't know he\r\nwas profane. 'Make room for Mr. Duncan,' says Dan, 'he wants to see the\r\nshow.' 'I'm a-goin' to see you in jail for this, Everett,' says Duncan.\r\nThey let him push in about half a rod, and they swallowed him. He\r\nwas makin' such a noise that they had to close the doors of the\r\ntheatre--so's not to disturb the play-actors.”\r\n\r\n“You understand,” said Mr. Bixby to Wetherell. Whereupon he gave another\r\nshake to Mr. Hartington, who had relapsed into a sort of funereal\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n“Well,” resumed that personage, “there was some more come, hollerin'\r\nabout the Truro Bill. Not many. Guess they'll all have to git their\r\nwimmen-folks to press their clothes to-morrow. Then Duncan wanted to\r\ngit out again, but 'twan't exactly convenient. Callated he was\r\nsuffocatin'--seemed to need air. Little mite limp when he broke loose,\r\nDuncan was.”\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Peleg stopped again, as if he were overcome by the\r\nrecollection of Mr. Duncan's plight.\r\n\r\n“Er--er--Peleg!”\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington started.\r\n\r\n“What'd they do?--what'd they do?”\r\n\r\n“Do?”\r\n\r\n“How'd they git notice to 'em?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Mr. Hartington, “cussed if that wuhn't funny. Let's see,\r\nwhere was I? After awhile they went over t'other side of the street,\r\ntalkin' sly, waitin' for the act to end. But goldarned if it ever did\r\nend.”\r\n\r\nFor once Mr. Bixby didn't seem to understand.\r\n\r\n“D-didn't end?”\r\n\r\n“No,” explained Mr. Hartington; “seems they hitched a kind of nigger\r\nminstrel show right on to it--banjos and thingumajigs in front of the\r\ncurtain while they was changin' scenes, and they hitched the second act\r\nright on to that. Nobody come out of the theatre at all. Funny notion,\r\nwahn't it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby's face took on a look of extreme cunning. He smiled broadly\r\nand poked Mr. Wetherell in an extremely sensitive portion of his ribs.\r\nOn such occasions the nasal quality of Bijah's voice seemed to grow.\r\n\r\n“You see?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Know that little man, Gibbs, don't ye?” inquired Mr. Hartington.\r\n\r\n“Airley Gibbs, hain't it? Runs a livery business daown to Rutgers, on\r\nLovejoy's railroad,” replied Mr. Bixby, promptly. “I know him. Knew old\r\nman Gibbs well's I do you. Mean cuss.”\r\n\r\n“This Airley's smart--wahn't quite smart enough, though. His bright idea\r\ncome a little mite late. Hunted up old Christy, got the key to his law\r\noffice right here in the Duncan Block, went up through the skylight,\r\nclumb down to the roof of Randall's store next door, shinned up the\r\nlightnin' rod on t'other side, and stuck his head plump into the Opery\r\nHouse window.”\r\n\r\n“I want to know!” ejaculated Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\n“Somethin' terrible pathetic was goin' on on the stage,” resumed Mr.\r\nHartington, “the folks didn't see him at first,--they was all cryin' and\r\neverythin' was still, but Airley wahn't affected. As quick as he got his\r\nbreath he hollered right out loud's he could: 'The Truro Bill's up in\r\nthe House, boys. We're skun if you don't git thar quick.' Then they tell\r\nme' the lightnin' rod give way; anyhow, he came down on Randall's gravel\r\nroof considerable hard, I take it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington, apparently, had an aggravating way of falling into\r\nmournful revery and of forgetting his subject. Mr. Bixby was forced to\r\njog him again.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they did,” he said, “they did. They come out like the theatre was\r\nafire. There was some delay in gettin' to the street, but not much--not\r\nmuch. All the Republican Clubs in the state couldn't have held 'em then,\r\nand the profanity they used wahn't especially edifyin'.”\r\n\r\n“Peleg's a deacon--you understand,” said Mr. Bixby. “Say, Peleg, where\r\nwas Al Lovejoy?”\r\n\r\n“Lovejoy come along with the first of 'em. Must have hurried some--they\r\ntell me he was settin' way down in front alongside of Alvy Hopkins's\r\ngal, and when Airley hollered out she screeched and clutched on to Al,\r\nand Al said somethin' he hadn't ought to and tore off one of them pink\r\ngew-gaws she was covered with. He was the maddest man I ever see. Some\r\nof the club was crowded inside, behind the seats, standin' up to see\r\nthe show. Al was so anxious to git through he hit Si Dudley in the\r\nmouth--injured him some, I guess. Pity, wahn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Si hain't in politics, you understand,” said Mr. Bixby. “Callate Si\r\npaid to git in there, didn't he, Peleg?”\r\n\r\n“Callate he did,” assented Senator Hartington.\r\n\r\nA long and painful pause followed. There seemed, indeed, nothing more\r\nto be said. The sound of applause floated out of the Opera House doors,\r\naround which the remaining loiterers were clustered.\r\n\r\n“Goin' in, be you, Peleg?” inquired Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Will and me had a notion to see somethin' of the show,” said Mr. Bixby,\r\nalmost apologetically. “I kep' my ticket.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Hartington, reflectively, “I guess you'll find some of\r\nthe show left. That hain't b'en hurt much, so far as I can ascertain.”\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, when Mr. Isaac D. Worthington happened to be sitting\r\nalone in the office of the Truro Railroad at the capital, there came a\r\nknock at the door, and Mr. Bijah Bixby entered. Now, incredible as it\r\nmay seem, Mr. Worthington did not know Mr. Bixby--or rather, did not\r\nremember him. Mr. Worthington had not had at that time much of an\r\nexperience in politics, and he did not possess a very good memory for\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby, who had, as we know, a confidential and winning manner,\r\nseated himself in a chair very close to Mr. Worthington--somewhat to\r\nthat gentleman's alarm. “How be you?” said Bijah, “I-I've got a little\r\nbill here--you understand.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington didn't understand, and he drew his chair away from Mr.\r\nBixby's.\r\n\r\n“I don't know anything about it, sir,” answered the president of the\r\nTruro Railroad, indignantly; “this is neither the manner nor the place\r\nto present a bill. I don't want to see it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby moved his chair up again. “Callate you will want to see this\r\nbill, Mr. Worthington,” he insisted, not at all abashed. “Jethro Bass\r\nsent it--you understand--it's engrossed.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr. Bixby drew from his capacious pocket a roll, tied with\r\nwhite ribbon, and pressed it into Mr. Worthington's hands. It was the\r\nTruro Franchise Bill.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that Mr. Worthington understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThere are certain instruments used by scientists so delicate that they\r\nhave to be wrapped in cotton wool and kept in ductless places, and so\r\nsensitive that the slightest shock will derange them. And there are\r\ncertain souls which cannot stand the jars of life--souls created\r\nto register thoughts and sentiments too fine for those of coarser\r\nconstruction. Such was the soul of the storekeeper of Coniston. Whether\r\nor not he was one of those immortalized in the famous Elegy, it is\r\nnot for us to say. A celebrated poet who read the letters to the\r\nGuardian--at Miss Lucretia Penniman's request--has declared Mr.\r\nWetherell to have been a genius. He wrote those letters, as we know,\r\nafter he had piled his boxes and rolled his barrels into place; after\r\nhe had added up the columns in his ledger and recorded, each week, the\r\nsmall but ever increasing deficit which he owed to Jethro Bass. Could\r\nhe have been removed from the barrels and the ledgers, and the debts\r\nand the cares and the implications, what might we have had from his pen?\r\nThat will never be known.\r\n\r\nWe left him in the lobby of the Opera House, but he did not go in to see\r\nthe final act of “Uncle Tom's Cabin.” He made his way, alone, back to\r\nthe hotel, slipped in by a side entrance, and went directly to his room,\r\nwhere Cynthia found him, half an hour later, seated by the open window\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\n“Aren't you well, Dad?” she asked anxiously. “Why didn't you come to see\r\nthe play?”\r\n\r\n“I--I was detained Cynthia,” he said. “Yes--I am well.”\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him and felt his forehead and his hands, and the\r\nevents of the evening which were on her lips to tell him remained\r\nunspoken.\r\n\r\n“You ought not to have left Coniston,” she said; “the excitement is too\r\nmuch for you. We will go back tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cynthia, we will go back to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“In the morning?”\r\n\r\n“On the early train,” said Wetherell, “and now you must go to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad,” said Cynthia, as she kissed him good night. “I have enjoyed\r\nit here, and I am grateful to Uncle Jethro for bringing us, but--but I\r\nlike Coniston best.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell could have slept but a few hours. When he awoke the\r\nsparrows were twittering outside, the fresh cool smells of the morning\r\nwere coming in at his windows, and the sunlight was just striking across\r\nthe roofs through the green trees of the Capitol Park. The remembrance\r\nof a certain incident of the night before crept into his mind, and he\r\ngot up, and drew on his clothes and thrust his few belongings into the\r\ncarpet-bag, and knocked on Cynthia's door. She was already dressed, and\r\nher eyes rested searchingly on his face.\r\n\r\n“Dad, you aren't well. I know it,” she said.\r\n\r\nBut he denied that he was not.\r\n\r\nHer belongings were in a neat little bundle under her arm. But when she\r\nwent to put them in the bag she gave an exclamation, knelt down, took\r\neverything out that he had packed, and folded each article over again\r\nwith amazing quickness. Then she made a rapid survey of the room lest\r\nshe had forgotten anything, closed the bag, and they went out and along\r\nthe corridor. But when Wetherell turned to go down the stairs, she\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n“Aren't you going to say goodby to Uncle Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“I--I would rather go on and get in the train, Cynthia,” he said.\r\n“Jethro will understand.”\r\n\r\nCynthia was worried, but she did not care to leave him; and she led him,\r\nprotesting, into the dining room. He had a sinking fear that they might\r\nmeet Jethro there, but only a few big-boned countrymen were scattered\r\nabout, attended by sleepy waitresses. Lest Cynthia might suspect how his\r\nhead was throbbing, Wetherell tried bravely to eat his breakfast. He did\r\nnot know that she had gone out, while they were waiting, and written a\r\nnote to Jethro, explaining that her father was ill, and that they were\r\ngoing back to Coniston. After breakfast, when they went to the desk, the\r\nclerk stared at them in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Going, Mr. Wetherell?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I find that I have to get back,” stammered the storekeeper. “Will you\r\ntell me the amount of my bill?”\r\n\r\n“Judge Bass gave me instructions that he would settle that.”\r\n\r\n“It is very kind of Mr. Bass,” said Wetherell, “but I prefer to pay it\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated.\r\n\r\n“The judge will be very angry, Mr. Wetherell.”\r\n\r\n“Kindly give me the bill.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk made it out and handed it over in silence. Wetherell had in\r\nhis pocket the money from several contributions to the Guardian, and he\r\npaid him. Then they set out for the station, bought their tickets and\r\nhurried past the sprinkling of people there. The little train for Truro\r\nwas standing under the sheds, the hissing steam from the locomotive\r\nrising perpendicular in the still air of the morning, and soon they were\r\nsettled in one of the straight-backed seats. The car was almost empty,\r\nfor few people were going up that day, and at length, after what, seemed\r\nan eternity of waiting, they started, and soon were in the country once\r\nmore in that wonderful Truro valley with its fruit trees and its clover\r\nscents; with its sparkling stream that tumbled through the passes and\r\nmirrored between green meadow-banks the blue and white of the sky. How\r\nhungrily they drank in the freshness of it.\r\n\r\nThey reached Truro village at eleven. Outside the little tavern there,\r\nafter dinner, the green stage was drawn up; and Tom the driver cracked\r\nhis long whip over the Morgan leaders and they started, swaying in the\r\nsand ruts and jolting over the great stones that cropped out of the\r\nroad. Up they climbed, through narrow ways in the forest--ways hedged\r\nwith alder and fern and sumach and wild grape, adorned with oxeye\r\ndaisies and tiger lilies, and the big purple flowers which they knew\r\nand loved so well. They passed, too, wild lakes overhung with primeval\r\ntrees, where the iris and the waterlily grew among the fallen trunks and\r\nthe water-fowl called to each other across the blue stretches. And at\r\nlength, when the sun was beginning visibly to fall, they came out into\r\nan open cut on the western side and saw again the long line of Coniston\r\nonce more against the sky.\r\n\r\n“Dad,” said Cynthia, as she gazed, “don't you love it better than any\r\nother place in the world?”\r\n\r\nHe did. But he could not answer her.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, from the hilltops above Isaac Worthington's mills, they\r\nsaw the terraced steeple of Brampton church, and soon the horses were\r\nstanding with drooping heads and wet sides in front of Mr. Sherman's\r\ntavern in Brampton Street; and Lem Hallowell, his honest face aglow with\r\njoy, was lifting Cynthia out of the coach as if she were a bundle of\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” he cried, “this is a little might sudden! What's the\r\nmatter with the capital, Will? Too wicked and sophisticated down thar to\r\nsuit ye?” By this time, Wetherell, too, had reached the ground, and as\r\nLem Hallowell gazed into his face the laughter in his own died away and\r\ngave place to a look of concern. “Don't wonder ye come back,” he said,\r\n“you're as white as Moses's hoss.”\r\n\r\n“He isn't feeling very well, Lem;” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Jest tuckered, that's all,” answered Lem; “you git him right into the\r\nstage, Cynthy, I won't be long. Hurry them things off, Tom,” he called,\r\nand himself seized a huge crate from the back of the coach and flung it\r\non his shoulder. He had his cargo on in a jiffy, clucked to his horses,\r\nand they turned into the familiar road to Coniston just as the sun was\r\ndipping behind the south end of the mountain.\r\n\r\n“They'll be surprised some, and disappointed some,” said Lem, cheerily;\r\n“they was kind of plannin' a little celebration when you come back,\r\nWill--you and Cynthy. Amandy Hatch was a-goin' to bake a cake, and the\r\nminister was callatin' to say some word of welcome. Wahn't goin' to\r\nbe anything grand--jest homelike. But you was right to come if you was\r\ntuckered. I guess Cynthy fetched you. Rias he kep' store and done it\r\nwell,--brisker'n I ever see him, Rias was. Wait till I put some of them\r\nthings back, and make you more comfortable, Will.”\r\n\r\nHe moved a few parcels and packages from Wetherell's feet and glanced at\r\nCynthia as he did so. The mountain cast its vast blue shadow over forest\r\nand pasture, and above the pines the white mist was rising from Coniston\r\nWater--rising in strange shapes. Lem's voice seemed to William Wetherell\r\nto have given way to a world-wide silence, in the midst of which he\r\nsought vainly for Cynthia and the stage driver. Most extraordinary of\r\nall, out of the silence and the void came the checker-paned windows\r\nof the store at Coniston, then the store itself, with the great oaks\r\nbending over it, then the dear familiar faces,--Moses and Amandy, Eph\r\nPrescott limping toward them, and little Rias Richardson in an apron\r\nwith a scoop shovel in his hand, and many others. They were not smiling\r\nat the storekeeper's return--they looked very grave. Then somebody\r\nlifted him tenderly from the stage and said:--\r\n\r\n“Don't you worry a mite, Cynthy. Jest tuckered, that's all.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was “just tuckered.” The great Dr. Coles, authority\r\non pulmonary troubles, who came all the way from Boston, could give no\r\nbetter verdict than that. It was Jethro Bass who had induced Dr. Coles\r\nto come to Coniston--much against the great man's inclination, and to\r\nthe detriment of his patients: Jethro who, on receiving Cynthia's note,\r\nhad left the capital on the next train and had come to Coniston, and had\r\nat once gone to Boston for the specialist.\r\n\r\n“I do not know why I came,” said the famous physician to Dr. Abraham\r\nRowell of Tarleton, “I never shall know. There is something about\r\nthat man Jethro Bass which compels you to do his will. He has a most\r\nextraordinary personality. Is this storekeeper a great friend of his?”\r\n\r\n“The only intimate friend he had in the world,” answered Dr. Rowell;\r\n“none of us could ever understand it. And as for the girl, Jethro Bass\r\nworships her.”\r\n\r\n“If nursing could cure him, I'd trust her to do it. She's a natural-born\r\nnurse.”\r\n\r\nThe two physicians were talking in low tones in the little garden behind\r\nthe store when Jethro came out of the doorway.\r\n\r\n“He looks as if he were suffering too,” said the Boston physician, and\r\nhe walked toward Jethro and laid a hand upon his shoulders. “I give him\r\nuntil winter, my friend,” said Dr. Coles.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass sat down on the doorstep--on that same millstone where he\r\nhad talked with Cynthia many years before--and was silent for a long\r\nwhile. The doctor was used to scenes of sorrow, but the sight of this\r\nman's suffering unnerved him, and he turned from it.\r\n\r\n“D-doctor?” said Jethro, at last.\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned again: “Yes?” he said.\r\n\r\n“D-doctor--if Wetherell hadn't b'en to the capital would he have\r\nlived--if he hadn't been to the capital?”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Dr. Coles, “if Mr. Wetherell had always lived in a\r\nwarm house, and had always been well fed, and helped over the rough\r\nplaces and shielded from the storms, he might have lived longer. It is a\r\nmarvel to me that he has lived so long.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the doctor went way, back to Boston. Many times in his long\r\nprofessional life had the veil been lifted for him--a little. But as he\r\nsat in the train he said to himself that in this visit to the hamlet\r\nof Coniston he had had the strangest glimpse of all. William Wetherell\r\nrallied, as Dr. Coles had predicted, from that first sharp attack, and\r\none morning they brought up a reclining chair which belonged to Mr.\r\nSatterlee, the minister, and set it in the window. There, in the still\r\ndays of the early autumn, Wetherell looked down upon the garden he\r\nhad grown to love, and listened to the song of Coniston Water. There\r\nCynthia, who had scarcely left his side, read to him from Keats and\r\nShelley and Tennyson--yet the thought grew on her that he did not seem\r\nto hear. Even that wonderful passage of Milton's, beginning “So sinks\r\nthe day-star in the ocean bed,” which he always used to beg her to\r\nrepeat, did not seem to move him now.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors came and sat with him, but he would not often speak.\r\nCheery Lem Hallowell and his wife, and Cousin Ephraim, to talk about\r\nthe war, hobbling slowly up the stairs--for rheumatism had been added to\r\nthat trouble of the Wilderness bullet now, and Ephraim was getting\r\nalong in years; and Rias Richardson stole up in his carpet slippers;\r\nand Moses, after his chores were done, and Amandy with her cakes and\r\ndelicacies, which he left untouched--though Amandy never knew it. Yes,\r\nand Jethro came. Day by day he would come silently into the room, and\r\nsit silently for a space, and go as silently out of it. The farms were\r\nneglected now on Thousand Acre Hill. William Wetherell would take his\r\nhand, and speak to him, but do no more than that.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Cynthia leaned over him, listening as he breathed\r\nto know whether he slept or were awake. If he were not sleeping, he\r\nwould speak her name: he repeated it often in those days, as though the\r\nsound of it gave him comfort; and he would fall asleep with it on his\r\nlips, holding her hand, and thinking, perhaps, of that other Cynthia\r\nwho had tended and nursed and shielded him in other days. Then she would\r\nsteal down the stairs to Jethro on the doorstep: to Jethro who would\r\nsit there for hours at a time, to the wonder and awe of his neighbors.\r\nAlthough they knew that he loved the storekeeper as he loved no other\r\nman, his was a grief that they could not understand.\r\n\r\nCynthia used to go to Jethro in the garden. Sorrow had brought them very\r\nnear together; and though she had loved him before, now he had become\r\nher reliance and her refuge. The first time Cynthia saw him; when the\r\nworst of the illness had passed and the strange and terrifying apathy\r\nhad come, she had hidden her head on his shoulder and wept there. Jethro\r\nkept that coat, with the tear stains on it, to his dying day, and never\r\nwore it again.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes--sometimes I think if he hadn't gone to the capital, Cynthy,\r\nthis mightn't hev come,” he said to her once.\r\n\r\n“But the doctor said that didn't matter, Uncle Jethro,” she answered,\r\ntrying to comfort him. She, too, believed that something had happened at\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n“N-never spoke to you about anything there--n-never spoke to you,\r\nCynthia?”\r\n\r\n“No, never,” she said. “He--he hardly speaks at all, Uncle Jethro.”\r\n\r\nOne bright morning after the sun had driven away the frost, when the\r\nsumacs and maples beside Coniston Water were aflame with red, Bias\r\nRichardson came stealing up the stairs and whispered something to\r\nCynthia.\r\n\r\n“Dad,” she said, laying down her book, “it's Mr. Merrill. Will you see\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell gave her a great fright. He started up from his\r\npillows, and seized her wrist with a strength which she had not thought\r\nremained in his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Merrill!” he cried--“Mr. Merrill here!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Cynthia, agitatedly, “he's downstairs--in the store.”\r\n\r\n“Ask him to come up,” said Wetherell, sinking back again, “ask him to\r\ncome up.”\r\n\r\nCynthia, as she stood in the passage, was of two minds about it. She\r\nwas thoroughly frightened, and went first to the garden to ask Jethro's\r\nadvice. But Jethro, so Milly Skinner said, had gone off half an hour\r\nbefore, and did not know that Mr. Merrill had arrived. Cynthia went back\r\nagain to her father.\r\n\r\n“Where's Mr. Merrill?” asked Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“Dad, do you think you ought to see him? He--he might excite you.”\r\n\r\n“I insist upon seeing him, Cynthia.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell had never said anything like that before. But Cynthia\r\nobeyed him, and presently led Mr. Merrill into the room. The kindly\r\nlittle railroad president was very serious now. The wasted face of the\r\nstorekeeper, enhanced as it was by the beard, gave Mr. Merrill such a\r\nshock that he could not speak for a few moments--he who rarely lacked\r\nfor cheering words on any occasion. A lump rose in his throat as he went\r\nover and stood by the chair and took the sick man's hand.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you came, Mr. Merrill,” said Wetherell, simply, “I wanted to\r\nspeak to you. Cynthia, will you leave us alone for a few minutes?”\r\n\r\nCynthia went, troubled and perplexed, wondering at the change in him. He\r\nhad had something on his mind--now she was sure of it--something which\r\nMr. Merrill might be able to relieve.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Merrill who spoke first when she was gone.\r\n\r\n“I was coming up to Brampton,” he said, “and Tom Collins, who drives the\r\nTruro coach, told me you were sick. I had not heard of it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill, too, had something on his mind, and did not quite know how\r\nto go on. There was in William Wetherell, as he sat in the chair with\r\nhis eyes fixed on his visitor's face, a dignity which Mr. Merrill had\r\nnot seen before--had not thought the man might possess.\r\n\r\n“I was coming to see you, anyway,” Mr. Merrill said.\r\n\r\n“I did you a wrong--though as God judges me, I did not think of it at\r\nthe time. It was not until Alexander Duncan spoke to me last week that I\r\nthought of it at all.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“You see,” continued Mr. Merrill wiping his brow, for he found the\r\nmatter even more difficult than he had imagined, “it was not until\r\nDuncan told me how you had acted in his library that I guessed the\r\ntruth--that I remembered myself how you had acted. I knew that you were\r\nnot mixed up in politics, but I also knew that you were an intimate\r\nfriend of Jethro's, and I thought that you had been let into the secret\r\nof the woodchuck session. I don't defend the game of politics as it is\r\nplayed, Mr. Wetherell, but all of us who are friends of Jethro's are\r\ngenerally willing to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going\r\non, and have a practical joke when we can. It was not until I saw you\r\nsitting there beside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make\r\na great deal of difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or\r\nnot, provided they didn't learn of the matter too early, because some\r\nof their men had been bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of\r\nhumor to play the game that way--and it was very effective. When I\r\nsaw you there beside Duncan I remembered that he had spoken about the\r\nGuardian letters, and the notion occurred to me to get him to show you\r\nhis library. I have explained to him that you were innocent. I--I hope\r\nyou haven't been worrying.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell sat very still for a while, gazing out of the window,\r\nbut a new look had come into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass did not know that you--that you had used me?” he asked at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Mr. Merrill thickly, “no. He didn't know a thing about\r\nit--he doesn't know it now, I believe.”\r\n\r\nA smile came upon Wetherell's face, but Mr. Merrill could not look at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“You have made me very happy,” said the storekeeper, tremulously. “I--I\r\nhave no right to be proud--I have taken his money--he has supported my\r\ndaughter and myself all these years. But he had never asked me to--to do\r\nanything, and I liked to think that he never would.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill could not speak. The tears were streaming down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n“I want you to promise me, Mr. Merril!” he went on presently, “I want\r\nyou to promise me that you will never speak to Jethro, of this, or to my\r\ndaughter, Cynthia.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill merely nodded his head in assent. Still he could not speak.\r\n\r\n“They might think it was this that caused my death. It was not. I know\r\nvery well that I am worn out, and that I should have gone soon in any\r\ncase. And I must leave Cynthia to him. He loves her as his own child.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell, his faith in Jethro restored, was facing death as he\r\nhad never faced life. Mr. Merrill was greatly affected.\r\n\r\n“You must not speak of dying, Wetherell,” said he, brokenly. “Will you\r\nforgive me?”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to forgive, now that you have explained matters, Mr.\r\nMerrill” said the storekeeper, and he smiled again. “If my fibre had\r\nbeen a little tougher, this thing would never have happened. There is\r\nonly one more request I have to make. And that is, to assure Mr. Duncan,\r\nfrom me, that I did not detain him purposely.”\r\n\r\n“I will see him on my way to Boston,” answered Mr. Merrill.\r\n\r\nThen Cynthia was called. She was waiting anxiously in the passage\r\nfor the interview to be ended, and when she came in one glance at her\r\nfather's face told her that he was happier. She, too, was happier.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would come every day, Mr. Merrill” she said, when they\r\ndescended into the garden after the three had talked awhile. “It is the\r\nfirst time since he fell ill that he seems himself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill's answer was to take her hand and pat it. He sat down on the\r\nmillstone and drew a deep breath of that sparkling air and sighed,\r\nfor his memory ran back to his own innocent boyhood in the New England\r\ncountry. He talked to Cynthia until Jethro came.\r\n\r\n“I have taken a fancy to this girl, Jethro,” said the little railroad\r\npresident, “I believe I'll steal her; a fellow can't have too many of\r\n'em, you know. I'll tell you one thing,--you won't keep her always shut\r\nup here in Coniston. She's much too good to waste on the desert air.”\r\n Perhaps Mr. Merrill, too, had been thinking of the Elegy that morning.\r\n“I don't mean to run down Coniston it's one of the most beautiful places\r\nI ever saw. But seriously, Jethro, you and Wetherell ought to send her\r\nto school in Boston after a while. She's about the age of my girls, and\r\nshe can live in my house: Ain't I right?”\r\n\r\n“D-don't know but what you be, Steve,” Jethro answered slowly.\r\n\r\n“I am right,” declared Mr. Merrill “you'll back me in this, I know\r\nit. Why, she's like your own daughter. You remember what I say. I mean\r\nit.--What are you thinking about, Cynthia?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't leave Dad and Uncle Jethro,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Why, bless your soul,” said Mr. Merrill “bring Dad along. We'll find\r\nroom for him. And I guess Uncle Jethro will get to Boston twice a month\r\nif you're there.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Merrill got into the buggy with Mr. Sherman and drove away to\r\nBrampton, thinking of many things.\r\n\r\n“S-Steve's a good man,” said Jethro. “C-come up here from Brampton to\r\nsee your father--did he?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Cynthia, “he is very kind.” She was about to tell Jethro\r\nwhat a strange difference this visit had made in her father's spirits,\r\nbut some instinct kept her silent. She knew that Jethro had never ceased\r\nto reproach himself for inviting Wetherell to the capital, and she was\r\nsure that something had happened there which had disturbed her father\r\nand brought on that fearful apathy. But the apathy was dispelled now,\r\nand she shrank from giving Jethro pain by mentioning the fact.\r\n\r\nHe never knew, indeed, until many years afterward, what had brought\r\nStephen Merrill to Coniston. When Jethro went up the stairs that\r\nafternoon, he found William Wetherell alone, looking out over the garden\r\nwith a new peace and contentment in his eyes. Jethro drew breath when he\r\nsaw that look, as if a great load had been lifted from his heart.\r\n\r\n“F-feelin' some better to-day, Will?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am well again, Jethro,” replied the storekeeper, pressing Jethro's\r\nhand for the first time in months.\r\n\r\n“S-soon be, Will,” said Jethro, “s-soon be.”\r\n\r\nWetherell, who was not speaking of the welfare of the body, did not\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” he said presently, “there is a little box lying in the top of\r\nmy trunk over there in the corner. Will you get it for me.”\r\n\r\nJethro rose and opened the rawhide trunk and handed the little rosewood\r\nbox to his friend. Wetherell took it and lifted the lid reverently, with\r\nthat same smile on his face and far-off look in his eyes, and drew out\r\na small daguerreotype in a faded velvet frame. He gazed at the picture\r\na long time, and then he held it out to Jethro; and Jethro looked at it,\r\nand his hand trembled.\r\n\r\nIt was a picture of Cynthia Ware. And who can say what emotions it awoke\r\nin Jethro's heart? She was older than the Cynthia he had known, and yet\r\nshe did not seem so. There was the same sweet, virginal look in the\r\ngray eyes, and the same exquisite purity in the features. He saw her\r\nagain--as if it were yesterday--walking in the golden green light under\r\nthe village maples, and himself standing in the tannery door; he saw the\r\nface under the poke bonnet on the road to Brampton, and heard the thrush\r\nsinging in the woods. And--if he could only blot out that scene from his\r\nlife!--remembered her, a transformed Cynthia,--remembered that face in\r\nthe lantern-light when he had flung back the hood that shaded it; and\r\nthat hair which he had kissed, wet, then, from the sleet. Ah, God, for\r\nthat briefest of moments she had been his!\r\n\r\nSo he stared at the picture as it lay in the palm of his hand, and\r\nforgot him who had been her husband. But at length he started, as from a\r\ndream, and gave it back to Wetherell, who was watching him. Her name had\r\nnever been mentioned between the two men, and yet she had been the one\r\nwoman in the world to both.\r\n\r\n“It is strange,” said William Wetherell, “it is strange that I should\r\nhave had but two friends in my life, and that she should have been one\r\nand you the other. She found me destitute and brought me back to life\r\nand married me, and cared for me until she died. And after that--you\r\ncared for me.”\r\n\r\n“You--you mustn't think of that, Will, 'twahn't much what I did--no more\r\nthan any one else would hev done!”\r\n\r\n“It was everything,” answered the storekeeper, simply; “each of you came\r\nbetween me and destruction. There is something that I have always meant\r\nto tell you, Jethro,--something that it may be a comfort for you to\r\nknow. Cynthia loved you.”\r\n\r\nJethro Bass did not answer. He got up and stood in the window, looking\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“When she married me,” Wetherell continued steadily, “she told me that\r\nthere was one whom she had never been able to drive from her heart. And\r\none summer evening, how well I recall it!--we were walking under the\r\ntrees on the Mall and we met my old employer, Mr. Judson, the jeweller.\r\nHe put me in mind of the young countryman who had come in to buy a\r\nlocket, and I asked her if she knew you. Strange that I should have\r\nremembered your name, wasn't it? It was then that she led me to a bench\r\nand confessed that you were the man whom she could not forget. I used to\r\nhate you then--as much as was in me to hate. I hated and feared you when\r\nI first came to Coniston. But now I can tell you--I can even be happy in\r\ntelling you.”\r\n\r\nJethro Bass groaned. He put his hand to his throat as though he were\r\nstifling. Many, many years ago he had worn the locket there. And now?\r\nNow an impulse seized him, and he yielded to it. He thrust his hand in\r\nhis coat and drew out a cowhide wallet, and from the wallet the oval\r\nlocket itself. There it was, tarnished with age, but with that memorable\r\ninscription still legible,--“Cynthy, from Jethro”; not Cynthia, but\r\nCynthy. How the years fell away as he read it! He handed it in silence\r\nto the storekeeper, and in silence went to the window again. Jethro Bass\r\nwas a man who could find no outlet for his agony in speech or tears.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Wetherell, “I thought you would have kept it. Dear, dear,\r\nhow well I remember it! And I remember how I patronized you when you\r\ncame into the shop. I believed I should live to be something in the\r\nworld, then. Yes, she loved you, Jethro. I can die more easily now that\r\nI have told you--it has been on my mind all these years.”\r\n\r\nThe locket fell open in William Wetherell's hand, for the clasp had\r\nbecome worn with time, and there was a picture of little Cynthia within:\r\nof little Cynthia,--not so little now,--a photograph taken in Brampton\r\nthe year before. Wetherell laid it beside the daguerreotype.\r\n\r\n“She looks like her,” he said aloud; “but the child is more vigorous,\r\nmore human--less like a spirit. I have always thought of Cynthia Ware as\r\na spirit.”\r\n\r\nJethro turned at the words, and came and stood looking over Wetherell's\r\nshoulder at the pictures of mother and daughter. In the rosewood box\r\nwas a brooch and a gold ring--Cynthia Ware's wedding ring--and two small\r\nslips of yellow paper. William Wetherell opened one of these, disclosing\r\na little braid of brown hair. He folded the paper again and laid it in\r\nthe locket, and handed that to Jethro.\r\n\r\n“It is all I have to give you,” he said, “but I know that you will\r\ncherish it, and cherish her, when I am gone. She--she has been a\r\ndaughter to both of us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jethro, “I will.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell lived but a few days longer. They laid him to rest at\r\nlast in the little ground which Captain Timothy Prescott had hewn out\r\nof the forest with his axe, where Captain Timothy himself lies under\r\nhis slate headstone with the quaint lettering of bygone days.--That same\r\nautumn Jethro Bass made a pilgrimage to Boston, and now Cynthia Ware\r\nsleeps there, too, beside her husband, amid the scenes she loved so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOne day, in the November following William Wetherell's death, Jethro\r\nBass astonished Coniston by moving to the little cottage in the village\r\nwhich stood beside the disused tannery, and which had been his father's.\r\nIt was known as the tannery house. His reasons for this step, when\r\nat length discovered, were generally commended: they were, in fact, a\r\ndisinclination to leave a girl of Cynthia's tender age alone on Thousand\r\nAcre Hill while he journeyed on his affairs about the country. The Rev.\r\nMr. Satterlee, gaunt, red-faced, but the six feet of him a man and\r\na Christian, from his square-toed boots to the bleaching yellow hair\r\naround his temples, offered to become her teacher. For by this time\r\nCynthia had exhausted the resources of the little school among the\r\nbirches.\r\n\r\nThe four years of her life in the tannery house which are now briefly\r\nto be chronicled were, for her, full of happiness and peace. Though the\r\nyoung may sorrow, they do not often mourn. Cynthia missed her father; at\r\ntimes, when the winds kept her wakeful at night, she wept for him. But\r\nshe loved Jethro Bass and served him with a devotion that filled his\r\nheart with strange ecstasies--yes, and forebodings. In all his existence\r\nhe had never known a love like this. He may have imagined it once, back\r\nin the bright days of his youth; but the dreams of its fulfilment had\r\nfallen far short of the exquisite touch of the reality in which he now\r\nspent his days at home. In summer, when she sat, in the face of all the\r\nconventions of the village, reading under the butternut tree before the\r\nhouse, she would feel his eyes upon her, and the mysterious yearning in\r\nthem would startle her. Often during her lessons with Mr. Satterlee in\r\nthe parlor of the parsonage she would hear a noise outside and perceive\r\nJethro leaning against the pillar. Both Cynthia and Mr. Satterlee knew\r\nthat he was there, and both, by a kind of tacit agreement, ignored the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nCynthia, in this period, undertook Jethro's education, too. She could\r\nhave induced him to study the making of Latin verse by the mere asking.\r\nDuring those days which he spent at home, and which he had grown to\r\nvalue beyond price, he might have been seen seated on the ground\r\nwith his back to the butternut tree while Cynthia read aloud from the\r\nwell-worn books which had been her father's treasures, books that took\r\non marvels of meaning from her lips. Cynthia's powers of selection were\r\nnot remarkable at this period, and perhaps it was as well that she never\r\nknew the effect of the various works upon the hitherto untamed soul of\r\nher listener. Milton and Tennyson and Longfellow awoke in him by their\r\nvery music troubled and half-formed regrets; Carlyle's “Frederick the\r\nGreat” set up tumultuous imaginings; but the “Life of Jackson” (as did\r\nthe story of Napoleon long ago) stirred all that was masterful in his\r\nblood. Unlettered as he was, Jethro had a power which often marks the\r\nAmerican of action--a singular grasp of the application of any sentence\r\nor paragraph to his own life; and often, about this time, he took\r\naway the breath of a judge or a senator by flinging at them a chunk of\r\nCarlyle or Parton.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps as well that Cynthia was not a woman at this time, and\r\nthat she had grown up with him, as it were. His love, indeed, was that\r\nof a father for a daughter; but it held within it as a core the\r\nrevived love of his youth for Cynthia, her mother. Tender as were the\r\nmanifestations of this love, Cynthia never guessed the fires within, for\r\nthere was in truth something primeval in the fierceness of his passion.\r\nShe was his now--his alone, to cherish and sweeten the declining years\r\nof his life, and when by a chance Jethro looked upon her and thought of\r\nthe suitor who was to come in the fulness of her years, he burned with\r\na hatred which it is given few men to feel. It was well for Jethro that\r\nthese thoughts came not often.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the summer afternoons, they took long drives through the\r\ntown behind Jethro's white horse on business. “Jethro's gal,” as Cynthia\r\ncame to be affectionately called, held the reins while Jethro went in\r\nto talk to the men folk. One August evening found Cynthia thus beside\r\na poplar in front of Amos Cuthbert's farmhouse, a poplar that shimmered\r\ngreen-gold in the late afternoon, and from the buggy-seat Cynthia looked\r\ndown upon a thousand purple hilltops and mountain peaks of another\r\nstate. The view aroused in the girl visions of the many wonders which\r\nlife was to hold, and she did not hear the sharp voice beside her\r\nuntil the woman had spoken twice. Jethro came out in the middle of the\r\nconversation, nodded to Mrs. Cuthbert, and drove off.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” asked Cynthia, presently, “what is a mortgage?”\r\n\r\nJethro struck the horse with the whip, an uncommon action with him, and\r\nthe buggy was jerked forward sharply over the boulders.\r\n\r\n“Er--who's b'en talkin' about mortgages, Cynthy?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Cuthbert said that when folks had mortgage held over them they had\r\nto take orders whether they liked them or not. She said that Amos had to\r\ndo what you told him because there was a mortgage. That isn't so is it?”\r\n\r\nJethro did not speak. Presently Cynthia laid her hand over his.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Cuthbert is a spiteful woman,” she said. “I know the reason why\r\npeople obey you--it's because you're so great. And Daddy used to tell me\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nA tremor shook Jethro's frame and the hand on which hers rested, and all\r\nthe way down the mountain valleys to Coniston village he did not speak\r\nagain. But Cynthia was used to his silences, and respected them.\r\n\r\nTo Ephraim Prescott, who, as the days went on, found it more and more\r\ndifficult to sew harness on account of his rheumatism, Jethro was not\r\nonly a great man but a hero. For Cynthia was vaguely troubled at having\r\nfound one discontent. She was wont to entertain Ephraim on the days when\r\nhis hands failed him, when he sat sunning himself before his door; and\r\nshe knew that he was honest.\r\n\r\n“Who's b'en talkin' to you, Cynthia?” he cried. “Why, Jethro's the\r\nbiggest man I know, and the best. I don't like to think where some of us\r\nwould have b'en if he hadn't given us a lift.”\r\n\r\n“But he has enemies, Cousin Eph,” said Cynthia, still troubled. “What\r\ngreat man hain't?” exclaimed the soldier. “Jethro's enemies hain't worth\r\nthinkin' about.”\r\n\r\nThe thought that Jethro had enemies was very painful to Cynthia, and she\r\nwanted to know who they were that she might show them a proper contempt\r\nif she met them. Lem Hallowell brushed aside the subject with his usual\r\nbluff humor, and pinched her cheek and told her not to trouble her head;\r\nAmanda Hatch dwelt upon the inherent weakness in the human race, and the\r\nRev. Mr. Satterlee faced the question once, during a history lesson. The\r\nnation's heroes came into inevitable comparison with Jethro Bass. Was\r\nWashington so good a man? and would not Jethro have been as great as the\r\nFather of his Country if he had had the opportunities?\r\n\r\nThe answers sorely tried Mr. Satterlee's conscience, albeit he was not\r\na man of the world. It set him thinking. He liked Jethro, this man of\r\nrugged power whose word had become law in the state. He knew best that\r\nside of him which Cynthia saw; and--if the truth be told--as a native of\r\nConiston Mr. Satterlee felt in the bottom of his heart a certain pride\r\nin Jethro. The minister's opinions well represented the attitude of his\r\ntime. He had not given thought to the subject--for such matters had came\r\nto be taken for granted. A politician now was a politician, his ways and\r\nstandards set apart from those of other citizens, and not to be judged\r\nby men without the pale of public life. Mr. Satterlee in his limited\r\nvision did not then trace the matter to its source, did not reflect that\r\nJethro Bass himself was almost wholly responsible in that state for the\r\ncondition of politics and politicians. Coniston was proud of\r\nJethro, prouder of him than ever since his last great victory in the\r\nLegislature, which brought the Truro Railroad through to Harwich and\r\nsettled their townsman more firmly than ever before in the seat of\r\npower. Every statesman who drove into their little mountain village\r\nand stopped at the tannery house made their blood beat faster. Senators\r\ncame, and representatives, and judges, and governors, “to git their\r\norders,” as Rias Richardson briefly put it, and Jethro could make or\r\nunmake them at a word. Each was scanned from the store where Rias now\r\nreigned supreme, and from the harness shop across the road. Some drove\r\naway striving to bite from their lips the tell-tale smile which arose in\r\nspite of them; others tried to look happy, despite the sentence of doom\r\nto which they had listened.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass was indeed a great man to make such as these tremble or\r\nrejoice. When he went abroad with Cynthia awheel or afoot, some took off\r\ntheir hats--an unheard-of thing in Coniston. If he stopped at the store,\r\nthey scanned his face for the mood he was in before venturing their\r\nremarks; if he lingered for a moment in front of the house of Amanda\r\nHatch, the whole village was advised of the circumstance before\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nTwo personages worthy of mention here visited the tannery house during\r\nthe years that Cynthia lived with Jethro. The Honorable Heth Sutton\r\ndrove over from Clovelly attended by his prime minister, Mr. Bijah\r\nBixby. The Honorable Heth did not attempt to conceal the smile with\r\nwhich he went away, and he stopped at the store long enough to enable\r\nRias to produce certain refreshments from depths unknown to the United\r\nStates Internal Revenue authorities. Mr. Sutton shook hands with\r\neverybody, including Jake Wheeler. Well he might. He came to Coniston\r\na private citizen, and drove away to all intents and purposes a\r\ncongressman: the darling wish of his life realized after heaven knows\r\nhow many caucuses and conventions of disappointment, when Jethro had\r\njudged it expedient for one reason or another that a north countryman\r\nshould go. By the time the pair reached Brampton, Chamberlain Bixby was\r\nintroducing his chief as Congressman Sutton, and by this title he was\r\nknown for many years to come.\r\n\r\nAnother day, when the snow lay in great billows on the ground and filled\r\nthe mountain valleys, when the pines were rusty from the long winter,\r\ntwo other visitors drove to Coniston in a two-horse sleigh. The sun was\r\nshining brightly, the wind held its breath, and the noon-day warmth was\r\nalmost like that of spring. Those who know the mountain country will\r\nremember the joy of many such days. Cynthia, standing in the sun on the\r\nporch, breathing deep of the pure air, recognized, as the sleigh drew\r\nnear, the somewhat portly gentleman driving, and the young woman beside\r\nhim regally clad in furs who looked patronizingly at the tannery house\r\nas she took the reins. The young woman was Miss Cassandra Hopkins, and\r\nthe portly gentleman, the Honorable Alva himself, patron of the drama,\r\nwho had entered upon his governorship and now wished to be senator.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass home?” he called out.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass is home,” answered Cynthia. The girl in the sleigh murmured\r\nsomething, laughing a little, and Cynthia flushed. Mr. Hopkins gave\r\na somewhat peremptory knock at the door and was admitted by Millicent\r\nSkinner, but Cynthia stood staring at Cassandra in the sleigh, some\r\ninstinct warning her of a coming skirmish.\r\n\r\n“Do you live here all the year round?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nMiss Cassandra shrugged as though that were beyond her comprehension.\r\n\r\n“I'd die in a place like this,” she said. “No balls, or theatres.\r\nDoesn't your father take you around the state?”\r\n\r\n“My father's dead,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Your name's Cynthia Wetherell, isn't it? You know Bob Worthington,\r\ndon't you? He's gone to Harvard now, but he was a great friend of mine\r\nat Andover.”\r\n\r\nCynthia didn't answer. It would not be fair to say that she felt a pang,\r\nthough it might add to the romance of this narrative. But her dislike\r\nfor the girl in the sleigh decidedly increased. How was she, in her\r\ninexperience, to know that the radiant beauty in furs was what the boys\r\nat Phillips Andover called an “old stager.”\r\n\r\n“So you live with Jethro Bass,” was Miss Cassandra's next remark. “He's\r\nrich enough to take you round the state and give you everything you\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\n“I have everything I want,” replied Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn't call living here having everything I wanted,” declared Miss\r\nHopkins, with a contemptuous glance at the tannery house.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you wouldn't,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nMiss Hopkins was nettled. She was out of humor that day, besides\r\nshe shared some of her father's political ambition. If he went to\r\nWashington, she went too.\r\n\r\n“Didn't you know Jethro Bass was rich?” she demanded, imprudently. “Why,\r\nmy father gave twenty thousand dollars to be governor, and Jethro Bass\r\nmust have got half of it.”\r\n\r\nCynthia's eyes were of that peculiar gray which, lighted by love or\r\nanger, once seen, are never forgotten. One hand was on the dashboard of\r\nthe cutter, the other had seized the seat. Her voice was steady, and the\r\nthree words she spoke struck Miss Hopkins with startling effect.\r\n\r\nMiss Hopkins's breath was literally taken away, and for once she found\r\nno retort. Let it be said for her that this was a new experience with a\r\nnew creature. A demure country girl turn into a wildcat before her very\r\neyes! Perhaps it was as well for both that the door of the house opened\r\nand the Honorable Alva interrupted their talk, and without so much as a\r\nglance at Cynthia he got hurriedly into the sleigh and drove off. When\r\nCynthia turned, the points of color still high in her cheeks and the\r\nlight still ablaze in her eyes, she surprised Jethro gazing at her\r\nfrom the porch, and some sorrow she felt rather than beheld stopped the\r\nconfession on her lips. It would be unworthy of her even to repeat such\r\nslander, and the color surged again into her face for very shame of her\r\nanger. Cassandra Hopkins had not been worthy of it.\r\n\r\nJethro did not speak, but slipped his hand into hers, and thus they\r\nstood for a long time gazing at the snow fields between the pines on the\r\nheights of Coniston.\r\n\r\nThe next summer, was the first which the painter--pioneer of summer\r\nvisitors there--spent at Coniston. He was an unsuccessful painter,\r\nwho became, by a process which he himself does not to-day completely\r\nunderstand, a successful writer of novels. As a character, however, he\r\nhimself confesses his inadequacy, and the chief interest in him for the\r\nreaders of this narrative is that he fell deeply in love with Cynthia\r\nWetherell at nineteen. It is fair to mention in passing that other young\r\nmen were in love with Cynthia at this time, notably Eben Hatch--history\r\nrepeating itself. Once, in a moment of madness, Eben confessed his love,\r\nthe painter never did: and he has to this day a delicious memory which\r\nhas made Cynthia the heroine of many of his stories. He boarded with\r\nChester Perkins, and he was humored by the village as a harmless but\r\namiable lunatic.\r\n\r\nThe painter had never conceived that a New England conscience and a\r\ntemper of no mean proportions could dwell together in the body of a\r\nwood nymph. When he had first seen Cynthia among the willows by Coniston\r\nWater, he had thought her a wood nymph. But she scolded him for his\r\nimpropriety with so unerring a choice of words that he fell in love\r\nwith her intellect, too. He spent much of his time to the neglect of his\r\ncanvases under the butternut tree in front of Jethro's house trying to\r\npersuade Cynthia to sit for her portrait; and if Jethro himself had not\r\noverheard one of these arguments, the portrait never would have been\r\npainted. Jethro focussed a look upon the painter.\r\n\r\n“Er--painter-man, be you? Paint Cynthy's picture?”\r\n\r\n“But I don't want to be painted, Uncle Jethro. I won't be painted!”\r\n\r\n“H-how much for a good picture? Er--only want the best--only want the\r\nbest.”\r\n\r\nThe painter said a few things, with pardonable heat, to the\r\neffect--well, never mind the effect. His remarks made no impression\r\nwhatever upon Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Er---paint the picture--paint the picture, and then we'll talk about\r\nthe price. Er--wait a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe went into the house, and they heard him lumbering up the stairs.\r\nCynthia sat with her back to the artist, pretending to read, but\r\npresently she turned to him.\r\n\r\n“I'll never forgive you--never, as long as I live,” she cried, “and I\r\nwon't be painted!”\r\n\r\n“N-not to please me, Cynthy?” It was Jethro's voice.\r\n\r\nHer look softened. She laid down the book and went up to him on the\r\nporch and put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Do you really want it so much as all that, Uncle Jethro?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Callate I do, Cynthy,” he answered. He held a bundle covered with\r\nnewspaper in his hand, he looked down at Cynthia.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself on the edge of the porch and for the moment seemed\r\nlost in revery. Then he began slowly to unwrap the newspaper from the\r\nbundle: there were five layers of it, but at length he disclosed a bolt\r\nof cardinal cloth.\r\n\r\n“Call this to mind, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered with a smile.\r\n\r\n“H-how's this for the dress, Mr. Painter-man?” said Jethro, with a pride\r\nthat was ill-concealed.\r\n\r\nThe painter started up from his seat and took the material in his hands\r\nand looked at Cynthia. He belonged to a city club where he was popular\r\nfor his knack of devising costumes, and a vision of Cynthia as the\r\ndaughter of a Doge of Venice arose before his eyes. Wonder of wonders,\r\nthe daughter of a Doge discovered in a New England hill village! The\r\npainter seized his pad and pencil and with a few strokes, guided by\r\ninspiration, sketched the costume then and there and held it up to\r\nJethro, who blinked at it in astonishment. But Jethro was suspicious of\r\nhis own sensations.\r\n\r\n“Er--well--Godfrey--g-guess that'll do.” Then came the involuntary:\r\n“W-wouldn't a-thought you had it in you. How about it, Cynthy?” and he\r\nheld it up for her inspection.\r\n\r\n“If you are pleased, it's all I care about, Uncle Jethro,” she answered,\r\nand then, her face suddenly flushing, “You must promise me on your honor\r\nthat nobody in Coniston shall know about it, 'Mr. Painter-man'.”\r\n\r\nAfter this she always called him “Mr. Painter-man,”--when she was\r\npleased with him.\r\n\r\nSo the cardinal cloth was come to its usefulness at last. It was\r\ninevitable that Sukey Kittredge, the village seamstress, should be taken\r\ninto confidence. It was no small thing to take Sukey into confidence,\r\nfor she was the legitimate successor in more ways than one of Speedy\r\nBates, and much of Cynthia and the artist's ingenuity was spent upon\r\ndevising a form of oath which would hold Sukey silent. Sukey, however,\r\ngot no small consolation from the sense of the greatness of the trust\r\nconfided in her, and of the uproar she could make in Coniston if she\r\nchose. The painter, to do him justice, was the real dressmaker, and did\r\neverything except cut the cloth and sew it together. He sent to friends\r\nof his in the city for certain paste jewels and ornaments, and one\r\nday Cynthia stood in the old tannery shed--hastily transformed into a\r\nstudio--before a variously moved audience. Sukey, having adjusted the\r\nlast pin, became hysterical over her handiwork, Millicent Skinner stared\r\nopenmouthed, words having failed her for once, and Jethro thrust his\r\nhands in his pockets in a quiet ecstasy of approbation.\r\n\r\n“A-always had a notion that cloth'd set you off, Cynthy,” said he,\r\n“er--next time I go to the state capital you come along--g-guess it'll\r\nsurprise 'em some.”\r\n\r\n“I guess it would, Uncle Jethro,” said Cynthia, laughing.\r\n\r\nJethro postponed two political trips of no small importance to be\r\npresent at the painting of that picture, and he would sit silently by\r\nthe hour in a corner of the shed watching every stroke of the brush.\r\nNever stood Doge's daughter in her jewels and seed pearls amidst\r\nstranger surroundings,--the beam, and the centre post around which\r\nthe old white horse had toiled in times gone by, and all the piled-up,\r\ndisused machinery of forgotten days. And never was Venetian lady more\r\nunconscious of her environment than Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThe portrait was of the head and shoulders alone, and when he had given\r\nit the last touch, the painter knew that, for once in his life, he\r\nhad done a good thing. Never before; perhaps, had the fire of such\r\ninspiration been given him. Jethro, who expressed himself in terms\r\n(for him) of great enthusiasm, was for going to Boston immediately to\r\npurchase a frame commensurate with the importance of such a work of art,\r\nbut the artist had his own views on that subject and sent to New York\r\nfor this also.\r\n\r\nThe day after the completion of the picture a rugged figure in rawhide\r\nboots and coonskin cap approached Chester Perkins's house, knocked\r\nat the door, and inquired for the “Painter-man.” It was Jethro. The\r\n“Painter-man” forthwith went out into the rain behind the shed, where a\r\nsomewhat curious colloquy took place.\r\n\r\n“G-guess I'm willin' to pay you full as much as it's worth,” said\r\nJethro, producing a cowhide wallet. “Er--what figure do you allow it\r\ncomes to with the frame?”\r\n\r\nThe artist was past taking offence, since Jethro had long ago become for\r\nhim an engrossing study.\r\n\r\n“I will send you the bill for the frame, Mr. Bass,” he said, “the\r\npicture belongs to Cynthia.”\r\n\r\n“Earn your livin' by paintin', don't you--earn your livin'?”\r\n\r\nThe painter smiled a little bitterly.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “if I did, I shouldn't be--alive. Mr. Bass, have you ever\r\ndone anything the pleasure of doing which was pay enough, and to spare?”\r\n\r\nJethro looked at him, and something very like admiration came into the\r\nface that was normally expressionless.\r\n\r\nHe put up his wallet a little awkwardly, and held out his hand more\r\nawkwardly.\r\n\r\n“You be more of a feller than I thought for,” he said, and strode off\r\nthrough the drizzle toward Coniston. The painter walked slowly to the\r\nkitchen, where Chester Perkins and his wife were sitting down to supper.\r\n\r\n“Jethro got a mortgage on you, too?” asked Chester.\r\n\r\nThe artist had his reward, for when the picture was hung at length in\r\nthe little parlor of the tannery house it became a source of pride to\r\nConiston second only to Jethro himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTime passes, and the engines of the Truro Railroad are now puffing in\r\nand out of the yards of Worthington's mills in Brampton, and a fine\r\nlayer of dust covers the old green stage which has worn the road for so\r\nmany years over Truro Gap. If you are ever in Brampton, you can still\r\nsee the stage, if you care to go into the back of what was once Jim\r\nSanborn's livery stable, now owned by Mr. Sherman of the Brampton House.\r\n\r\nConventions and elections had come and gone, and the Honorable Heth\r\nSutton had departed triumphantly to Washington, cheered by his neighbors\r\nin Clovelly. Chamberlain Bixby was left in charge there, supreme. Who\r\ncould be more desirable as a member of Congress than Mr. Sutton, who had\r\nso ably served his party (and Jethro) by holding the House against the\r\ninsurgents in the matter of the Truro Bill? Mr. Sutton was, moreover, a\r\ngentleman, an owner of cattle and land, a man of substance whom lesser\r\nmen were proud to mention as a friend--a very hill-Rajah with stock in\r\nrailroads and other enterprises, who owed allegiance and paid tribute\r\nalone to the Great Man of Coniston.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton was one who would make himself felt even in the capital of\r\nthe United States--felt and heard. And he had not been long in the Halls\r\nof Congress before he made a speech which rang under the very dome of\r\nthe Capitol. So said the Brampton and Harwich papers, at least, though\r\nrivals and detractors of Mr. Sutton declared that they could find no\r\nmatter in it which related to the subject of a bill, but that is\r\nneither here nor there. The oration began with a lengthy tribute to the\r\nresources and history of his state, and ended by a declaration that the\r\nspeaker was in Congress at no man's bidding, but as the servant of the\r\ncommon people of his district.\r\n\r\nUnder the lamp of the little parlor in the tannery house, Cynthia (who\r\nhas now arrived at the very serious age of nineteen) was reading the\r\npapers to Jethro and came upon Mr. Sutton's speech. There were four\r\ncolumns of it, but Jethro seemed to take delight in every word; and\r\nportions of the noblest parts of it, indeed, he had Cynthia read over\r\nagain. Sometimes, in the privacy of his home, Jethro was known to\r\nchuckle, and to Cynthia's surprise he chuckled more than usual that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said at length, when she had laid the paper down, “I\r\nthought that you sent Mr. Sutton to Congress.”\r\n\r\nJethro leaned forward.\r\n\r\n“What put that into your head, Cynthy?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” answered the girl, “everybody says so,--Moses Hatch, Rias, and\r\nCousin Eph. Didn't you?”\r\n\r\nJethro looked at her, as she thought, strangely.\r\n\r\n“You're too young to know anything about such things, Cynthy,” he said,\r\n“too young.”\r\n\r\n“But you make all the judges and senators and congressmen in the state,\r\nI know you do. Why,” exclaimed Cynthia, indignantly, “why does Mr.\r\nSutton say the people elected him when he owes everything to you?”\r\n\r\nJethro, arose abruptly and flung a piece of wood into the stove, and\r\nthen he stood with his back to her. Her instinct told her that he was\r\nsuffering, though she could not fathom the cause, and she rose swiftly\r\nand drew him down into the chair beside her.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” she said anxiously. “Have you got rheumatism, too, like\r\nCousin Eph? All old men seem to have rheumatism.”\r\n\r\n“No, Cynthy, it hain't rheumatism,” he managed to answer; “wimmen folks\r\nhadn't ought to mix up in politics. They--they don't understand 'em,\r\nCynthy.”\r\n\r\n“But I shall understand them some day, because I am your daughter--now\r\nthat--now that I have only you, I am your daughter, am I not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he answered huskily, with his hand on her hair.\r\n\r\n“And I know more than most women now,” continued Cynthia, triumphantly.\r\n“I'm going to be such a help to you soon--very soon. I've read a lot of\r\nhistory, and I know some of the Constitution by heart. I know why old\r\nTimothy Prescott fought in the Revolution--it was to get rid of kings,\r\nwasn't it, and to let the people have a chance? The people can always be\r\ntrusted to do what is right, can't they, Uncle Jethro?”\r\n\r\nJethro was silent, but Cynthia did not seem to notice that. After a\r\nspace she spoke again:--“I've been thinking it all out about you, Uncle\r\nJethro.”\r\n\r\n“A-about me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know why you are able to send men to Congress and make judges\r\nof them. It's because the people have chosen you to do all that for\r\nthem--you are so great and good.”\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer.\r\n\r\nAlthough the month was March, it was one of those wonderful still nights\r\nthat sometimes come in the mountain-country when the wind is silent\r\nin the notches and the stars seem to burn nearer to the earth. Cynthia\r\nawoke and lay staring for an instant at the red planet which hung over\r\nthe black and ragged ridge, and then she arose quickly and knocked at\r\nthe door across the passage.\r\n\r\n“Are you ill, Uncle Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered, “no, Cynthy. Go to bed. Er--I was just\r\nthinkin'--thinkin', that's all, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\nThough all his life he had eaten sparingly, Cynthia noticed that he\r\nscarcely touched his breakfast the next morning, and two hours later\r\nhe went unexpectedly to the state capital. That day, too, Coniston was\r\nclothed in clouds, and by afternoon a wild March snowstorm was sweeping\r\ndown the face of the mountain, piling against doorways and blocking the\r\nroads. Through the storm Cynthia fought her way to the harness shop,\r\nfor Ephraim Prescott had taken to his bed, bound hand and foot by\r\nrheumatism.\r\n\r\nMuch of that spring Ephraim was all but helpless, and Cynthia spent\r\nmany days nursing him and reading to him. Meanwhile the harness industry\r\nlanguished. Cynthia and Ephraim knew, and Coniston guessed, that Jethro\r\nwas taking care of Ephraim, and strong as was his affection for Jethro\r\nthe old soldier found dependence hard to bear. He never spoke of it to\r\nCynthia, but he used to lie and dream through the spring days of what he\r\nmight have done if the war had not crippled him. For Ephraim Prescott,\r\nlike his grandfather, was a man of action--a keen, intelligent American\r\nwhose energy, under other circumstances, might have gone toward the\r\nmaking of the West. Ephraim, furthermore, had certain principles which\r\nsome in Coniston called cranks; for instance, he would never apply for\r\na pension, though he could easily have obtained one. Through all his\r\ntroubles, he held grimly to the ideal which meant more to him than ease\r\nand comfort,--that he had served his country for the love of it.\r\n\r\nWith the warm weather he was able to be about again, and occasionally to\r\nmend a harness, but Doctor Rowell shook his head when Jethro stopped\r\nhis buggy in the road one day to inquire about Ephraim. Whereupon Jethro\r\nwent on to the harness shop. The inspiration, by the way, had come from\r\nCynthia.\r\n\r\n“Er--Ephraim, how'd you like to, be postmaster? H-haven't any objections\r\nto that kind of a job, hev you?”\r\n\r\n“Why no,” said Ephraim. “We hain't agoin' to hev a post-office at\r\nConiston--air we?”\r\n\r\n“H-how'd you like to be postmaster at Brampton?” demanded Jethro,\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nEphraim dropped the trace he was shaving.\r\n\r\n“Postmaster at Brampton!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“H-how'd you like it?” said Jethro again.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Ephraim, “I hain't got any objections.”\r\n\r\nJethro started out of the shop, but paused again at the door.\r\n\r\n“W-won't say nothin' about it, will you, Eph?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Not till I git it,” answered Ephraim. The sorrows of three years were\r\nsuddenly lifted from his shoulders, and for an instant Ephraim wanted\r\nto dance until he remembered the rheumatism and the Wilderness leg.\r\nSuddenly a thought struck him, and he hobbled to the door and called out\r\nafter Jethro's retreating figure. Jethro returned.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he said, “well?”\r\n\r\n“What's the pay?” said Ephraim, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nJethro named the sum instantly, also in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“You don't tell me!” said Ephraim, and sank stupefied into the chair in\r\nfront of the shop, where lately he had spent so much of his time.\r\n\r\nJethro chuckled twice on his way home: he chuckled twice again to\r\nCynthia's delight at supper, and after supper he sent Millicent Skinner\r\nto find Jake Wheeler. Jake as usual, was kicking his heels in front of\r\nthe store, talking to Rias and others about the coming Fourth of July\r\ncelebration at Brampton. Brampton, as we know, was famous for its Fourth\r\nof July celebrations. Not neglecting to let it be known that Jethro\r\nhad sent for him, Jake hurried off through the summer twilight to the\r\ntannery house, bowed ceremoniously to Cynthia under the butternut tree,\r\nand discovered Jethro behind the shed. It was usually Jethro's custom to\r\nallow the other man to begin the conversation, no matter how trivial\r\nthe subject--a method which had commended itself to Mr. Bixby and other\r\nminor politicians who copied him. And usually the other man played\r\ndirectly into Jethro's hands. Jake Wheeler always did, and now, to cover\r\nthe awkwardness of the silence, he began on the Brampton celebration.\r\n\r\n“They tell me Heth Sutton's a-goin' to make the address--seems prouder\r\nthan ever sence he went to Congress. I guess you'll tell him what to say\r\nwhen the time comes, Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“Er--goin' to Clovelly after wool this week, Jake?”\r\n\r\n“I kin go to-morrow,” said Jake, scenting an affair.\r\n\r\n“Er--goin' to Clovelly after wool this week, Jake?”\r\n\r\nJake reflected. He saw it was expedient that this errand should not\r\nsmell of haste.\r\n\r\n“I was goin' to see Cutter on Friday,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Er--if you should happen to meet Heth--”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” interrupted Jake.\r\n\r\n“If by chance you should happen to meet Heth, or Bije” (Jethro knew that\r\nJake never went to Clovelly without a conference with one or the other\r\nof these personages, if only to be able to talk about it afterward at\r\nthe store), “er--what would you say to 'em?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Jake, scratching his head for the answer, “I'd tell him you\r\nwas at Coniston.”\r\n\r\n“Think we'll have rain, Jake?” inquired Jethro, blandly.\r\n\r\nJake wended his way back to the store, filled with renewed admiration\r\nfor the great man. Jethro had given him no instructions whatever, could\r\ndeny before a jury if need be that he had sent him (Jake) to Clovelly to\r\ntell Heth Sutton to come to Coniston for instructions on the occasion\r\nof his Brampton speech. And Jake was filled with a mysterious importance\r\nwhen he took his seat once more in the conclave.\r\n\r\nJake Wheeler, although in many respects a fool, was one of the most\r\nefficient pack of political hounds that the state has ever known. By\r\nsix o'clock on Friday morning he was descending a brook valley on the\r\nClovelly side of the mountain, and by seven was driving between the\r\nforest and river meadows of the Rajah's domain, and had come in sight of\r\nthe big white house with its somewhat pretentious bay-windows and Gothic\r\ndoorway; it might be dubbed the palace of these parts. The wide river\r\nflowed below it, and the pastures so wondrously green in the morning sun\r\nwere dotted with fat cattle and sheep. Jake was content to borrow a cut\r\nof tobacco from the superintendent and wonder aimlessly around the farm\r\nuntil Mr. Sutton's family prayers and breakfast were accomplished. We\r\nshall not concern ourselves with the message or the somewhat lengthy\r\nmanner in which it was delivered. Jake had merely dropped in by\r\naccident, but the Rajah listened coldly while he picked his teeth, said\r\nhe didn't know whether he was going to Brampton or not--hadn't decided;\r\ndidn't know whether he could get to Coniston or not--his affairs were\r\nmultitudinous now. In short, he set Jake to thinking deeply as his horse\r\nwalked up the western heights of Coniston on the return journey. He\r\nhad, let it be repeated, a sure instinct once his nose was fairly on\r\nthe scent, and he was convinced that a war of great magnitude was in the\r\nair, and he; Jake Wheeler, was probably the first in all the elate to\r\ndiscover it! His blood leaped at the thought.\r\n\r\nThe hill-Rajah's defiance, boiled down, could only mean one thing,--that\r\nsomebody with sufficient power and money was about to lock horns with\r\nJethro Bass. Not for a moment did Jake believe that, for all his pomp\r\nand circumstance, the Honorable Heth Sutton was a big enough man to do\r\nthis. Jake paid to the Honorable Heth all the outward respect that his\r\nhigh position demanded, but he knew the man through and through. He\r\nthought of the Honorable Heth's reform speech in Congress, and laughed\r\nloudly in the echoing woods. No, Mr. Sutton was not the man to lead a\r\nfight. But to whom had he promised his allegiance? This question puzzled\r\nMr. Wheeler all the way home, and may it be said finally for many\r\ndays thereafter. He slid into Coniston in the dusk, big with impending\r\nevents, which he could not fathom. As to giving Jethro the careless\r\nanswer of the hill-Rajah, that was another matter.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July came at last, nor was any contradiction made in the\r\nBrampton papers that the speech of the Honorable Heth Sutton had been\r\ncancelled. Instead, advertisements appeared in the 'Brampton\r\nClarion' announcing the fact in large letters. When Cynthia read\r\nthis advertisement to Jethro, he chuckled again. They were under the\r\nbutternut tree, for the evenings were long now.\r\n\r\n“Will you take me to Brampton, Uncle Jethro?” said she, letting fall the\r\npaper on her lap.\r\n\r\n“W-who's to get in the hay?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Hay on the Fourth of July!” exclaimed Cynthia, “why, that's--sacrilege!\r\nYou'd much better come and hear Mr. Sutton's speech--it will do you\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\nCynthia could see that Jethro was intensely amused, for his eyes had a\r\nway of snapping on such occasions when he was alone with her. She was\r\npuzzled and slightly offended, because, to tell the truth, Jethro had\r\nspoiled her.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” she said, “I'll go with the Painter-man.”\r\n\r\nJethro came and stood over her, his expression the least bit wistful.\r\n\r\n“Er--Cynthy,” he said presently, “hain't fond of that Painter-man, be\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said Cynthia, “aren't you?”\r\n\r\n“He's fond of you,” said Jethro, “sh-shouldn't be surprised if he was in\r\nlove with you.”\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up at him, the corners of her mouth twitching, and then\r\nshe laughed. The Rev. Mr. Satterlee, writing his Sunday sermon in his\r\nstudy, heard her and laid down his pen to listen.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” said Cynthia, “sometimes I forget that you're a great,\r\nwise man, and I think that you are just a silly old goose.”\r\n\r\nJethro wiped his face with his blue cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Then you hain't a-goin' to marry the Painter-man?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I'm not going to marry anybody,” cried Cynthia, contritely; “I'm going\r\nto live with you and take care of you all my life.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Fourth, Cynthia drove to Brampton with the\r\nPainter-man, and when he perceived that she was dreaming, he ceased to\r\nworry her with his talk. He liked her dreaming, and stole many glances\r\nat her face of which she knew nothing at all. Through the cool and\r\nfragrant woods, past the mill-pond stained blue and white by the sky,\r\nand scented clover fields and wayside flowers nodding in the morning\r\nair--Cynthia saw these things in the memory of another journey to\r\nBrampton. On that Fourth her father had been with her, and Jethro and\r\nEphraim and Moses and Amanda Hatch and the children. And how well she\r\nrecalled, too, standing amidst the curious crowd before the great house\r\nwhich Mr. Worthington had just built.\r\n\r\nThere are weeks and months, perhaps, when we do not think of people,\r\nwhen our lives are full and vigorous, and then perchance a memory will\r\nbring them vividly before us--so vividly that we yearn for them. There\r\nrose before Cynthia now the vision of a boy as he stood on the Gothic\r\nporch of the house, and how he had come down to the wondering country\r\npeople with his smile and his merry greeting, and how he had cajoled her\r\ninto lingering in front of the meeting-house. Had he forgotten her? With\r\njust a suspicion of a twinge, Cynthia remembered that Janet Duncan she\r\nhad seen at the capital, whom she had been told was the heiress of the\r\nstate. When he had graduated from Harvard, Bob would, of course, marry\r\nher. That was in the nature of things.\r\n\r\nTo some the great event of that day in Brampton was to be the speech of\r\nthe Honorable Heth Sutton in the meeting-house at eleven; others (and\r\nthis party was quite as numerous) had looked forward to the base-ball\r\ngame between Brampton and Harwich in the afternoon. The painter would\r\nhave preferred to walk up meeting-house hill with Cynthia, and from\r\nthe cool heights look down upon the amphitheatre in which the town\r\nwas built. But Cynthia was interested in history, and they went to the\r\nmeeting-house accordingly, where she listened for an hour and a half to\r\nthe patriotic eloquence of the representative. The painter was glad to\r\nsee and hear so great a man in the hour of his glory, though so much as\r\na fragment of the oration does not now remain in his memory. In size,\r\nin figure, in expression, in the sonorous tones of his voice, Mr. Sutton\r\nwas everything that a congressman should be. “The people,” said Isaac D.\r\nWorthington in presenting him, “should indeed be proud of such an able\r\nand high-minded representative.” We shall have cause to recall that word\r\nhigh-minded.\r\n\r\nMany persons greeted Cynthia outside the meetinghouse, for the girl\r\nseemed genuinely loved by all who knew her--too much loved, her\r\ncompanion thought, by certain spick-and-span young men of Brampton. But\r\nthey ate the lunch Cynthia had brought, far from the crowd, under the\r\ntrees by Coniston Water. It was she who proposed going to the base-ball\r\ngame, and the painter stifled a sigh and acquiesced. Their way brought\r\nthem down Brampton Street, past a house with great iron dogs on the\r\nlawn, so imposing and cityfied that he hung back and asked who lived\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington,” answered Cynthia, making to move on impatiently.\r\n\r\nHer escort did not think much of the house, but it interested him as\r\nthe type which Mr. Worthington had built. On that same Gothic porch,\r\nsublimely unconscious of the covert stares and subdued comments of the\r\npassers-by, the first citizen himself and the Honorable Heth Sutton\r\nmight be seen. Mr. Worthington, whose hawklike look had become more\r\npronounced, sat upright, while the Honorable Heth, his legs crossed,\r\nfilled every nook and cranny of an arm-chair, and an occasional fragrant\r\nwhiff from his cigar floated out to those on the tar sidewalk. Although\r\nthe pedestrians were but twenty feet away, what Mr. Worthington said\r\nnever reached them; but the Honorable Heth on public days carried his\r\nvoice of the Forum around with him.\r\n\r\n“Come on,” said Cynthia, in one of those startling little tempers she\r\nwas subject to; “don't stand there like an idiot.”\r\n\r\nThen the voice of Mr. Sutton boomed toward them.\r\n\r\n“As I understand, Worthington,” they heard him say, “you want me to\r\nappoint young Wheelock for the Brampton post-office.” He stuck his\r\nthumb into his vest pocket and recrossed his legs “I guess it can be\r\narranged.”\r\n\r\nWhen the painter at last overtook Cynthia the jewel paints he had so\r\noften longed to catch upon a canvas were in her eyes. He fell back,\r\nwondering how he could so greatly have offended, when she put her hand\r\non his sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Did you hear what he said about the Brampton postoffice?” she cried.\r\n\r\n“The Brampton post-office?” he repeated; dazed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia; “Uncle Jethro has promised it to Cousin Ephraim,\r\nwho will starve without it. Did you hear this man say he would give it\r\nto Mr. Wheelock?”\r\n\r\nHere was a new Cynthia, aflame with emotions on a question of politics\r\nof which he knew nothing. He did, understand, however, her concern for\r\nEphraim Prescott, for he knew that she loved the soldier. She turned\r\nfrom the painter now with a gesture which he took to mean that his\r\nprofession debarred him from such vital subjects, and she led the way\r\nto the fair-grounds. There he meekly bought tickets, and they found\r\nthemselves hurried along in the eager crowd toward the stand.\r\n\r\nThe girl was still unaccountably angry over that mysterious affair of\r\nthe post-office, and sat with flushed cheeks staring out on the green\r\nfield, past the line of buggies and carryalls on the farther side to\r\nthe southern shoulder of Coniston towering, above them all. The painter,\r\nalready, beginning to love his New England folk, listened to the homely\r\nchatter about him, until suddenly a cheer starting in one corner ran\r\nlike a flash of gunpowder around the field, and eighteen young men\r\ntrotted across the turf. Although he was not a devotee of sport, he\r\nnoticed that nine of these, as they took their places on the bench, wore\r\nblue,--the Harwich Champions. Seven only of those scattering over the\r\nfield wore white; two young gentlemen, one at second base and the\r\nother behind the batter, wore gray uniforms with crimson stockings, and\r\ncrimson piping on the caps, and a crimson H embroidered on the breast--a\r\nsight that made the painter's heart beat a little faster, the honored\r\nlivery of his own college.\r\n\r\n“What are those two Harvard men doing here?” he asked.\r\n\r\nCynthia, who was leaning forward, started, and turned to him a face\r\nwhich showed him that his question had been meaningless. He repeated it.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said she, “the tall one, burned brick-red like an Indian, is Bob\r\nWorthington.”\r\n\r\n“He's a good type,” the artist remarked.\r\n\r\n“You're right, Mister, there hain't a finer young feller anywhere,”\r\n chimed in Mr. Dodd, a portly person with a tuft of yellow beard on his\r\nchin. Mr. Dodd kept the hardware store in Brampton.\r\n\r\n“And who,” asked the painter, “is the bullet-headed little fellow, with\r\nfreckles and short red hair, behind the bat?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” said Cynthia, indifferently.\r\n\r\n“Why,” exclaimed Mr. Dodd, with just a trace of awe in his voice,\r\n“that's Somers Duncan, son of Millionaire Duncan down to the capital. I\r\nguess,” he added, “I guess them two will be the richest men in the state\r\nsome day. Duncan come up from Harvard with Bob.”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the game was in full swing, Brampton against Harwich,\r\nthe old rivalry in another form. Every advantage on either side awoke\r\nthundering cheers from the partisans; beribboned young women sprang to\r\ntheir feet and waved the Harwich blue at a home run, and were on the\r\nverge of tears when the Brampton pitcher struck out their best batsman.\r\nBut beyond the facts that the tide was turning in Brampton's favor; that\r\nyoung Mr. Worthington stopped a ball flying at a phenomenal speed and\r\nbatted another at a still more phenomenal speed which was not stopped;\r\nthat his name and Duncan's were mingled generously in the cheering, the\r\npainter remembered little of the game. The exhibition of human passions\r\nwhich the sight of it drew from an undemonstrative race: the shouting,\r\nthe comments wrung from hardy spirits off their guard, the joy and\r\nthe sorrow,--such things interested him more. High above the turmoil\r\nConiston, as through the ages, looked down upon the scene impassive.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused from these reflections by an incident. Some one had\r\nleaped over the railing which separated the stand from the field and\r\nstood before Cynthia,--a tanned and smiling young man in gray and\r\ncrimson. His honest eyes were alight with an admiration that was\r\nunmistakable to the painter--perhaps to Cynthia also, for a glow that\r\nmight have been of annoyance or anger, and yet was like the color of the\r\nmountain sunrise, answered in her cheek. Mr. Worthington reached out a\r\nlarge brown hand and seized the girl's as it lay on her lap.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Cynthia,” he cried, “I've been looking for you all day. I\r\nthought you might be here. Where were you?”\r\n\r\n“Where did you look?” answered Cynthia, composedly, withdrawing her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Everywhere,” said Bob, “up and down the street, all through the hotel.\r\nI asked Lem Hallowell, and he didn't know where you were. I only got\r\nhere last night myself.”\r\n\r\n“I was in the meeting-house,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“The meeting-house!” he echoed. “You don't mean to tell me that you\r\nlistened to that silly speech of Sutton's?”\r\n\r\nThis remark, delivered in all earnestness, was the signal for uproarious\r\nlaughter from Mr. Dodd and others sitting near by, attending earnestly\r\nto the conversation.\r\n\r\nCynthia bit her lip.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did,” she said; “but I'm sorry now.”\r\n\r\n“I should think you would be,” said Bob; “Sutton's a silly, pompous old\r\nfool. I had to sit through dinner with him. I believe I could represent\r\nthe district better myself.”\r\n\r\n“By gosh!” exploded Mr. Dodd, “I believe you could!”\r\n\r\nBut Bob paid no attention to him. He was looking at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia, you've grown up since I saw you,” he said. “How's Uncle\r\nJethro.\r\n\r\n“He's well--thanks,” said Cynthia, and now she was striving to put down\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n“Still running the state?” said Bob. “You tell him I think he ought to\r\nmuzzle Sutton. What did he send him down to Washington for?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do after the game?” Bob demanded.\r\n\r\n“I'm going home of course,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nHis face fell.\r\n\r\n“Can't you come to the house for supper and stay for the fireworks?” he\r\nbegged pleadingly. “We'd be mighty glad to have your friend, too.”\r\n\r\nCynthia introduced her escort.\r\n\r\n“It's very good of you, Bob,” she said, with that New England demureness\r\nwhich at times became her so well, “but we couldn't possibly do it. And\r\nthen I don't like Mr. Sutton.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hang him!” exclaimed Bob. He took a step nearer to her. “Won't you\r\nstay this once? I have to go West in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“I think you are very lucky,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nBob scanned her face searchingly, and his own fell.\r\n\r\n“Lucky!” he cried, “I think it's the worst thing that ever happened to\r\nme. My father's so hard-headed when he gets his mind set--he's making me\r\ndo it. He wants me to see the railroads and the country, so I've got to\r\ngo with the Duncans. I wanted to stay--” He checked himself, “I think\r\nit's a blamed nuisance.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” said a voice behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Mr. Somers Duncan had spoken, but Bob\r\neither had not heard him or pretended not to. Mr. Duncan's freckled face\r\nsmiled at them from the top of the railing, his eyes were on\r\nCynthia's face, and he had been listening eagerly. Mr. Duncan's chief\r\ncharacteristic, beyond his freckles, was his eagerness--a quality\r\nprobably amounting to keenness.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” said Bob, turning impatiently, “I might have known you couldn't\r\nkeep away. You're the cause of all my troubles--you and your father's\r\nprivate car.”\r\n\r\nSomers became apologetic.\r\n\r\n“It isn't my fault,” he said; “I'm sure I hate going as much as you do.\r\nIt's spoiled my summer, too.”\r\n\r\nThen he coughed and looked at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bob, “I suppose I'll have to introduce you. This,” he\r\nadded, dragging his friend over the railing, “is Mr. Somers Duncan.”\r\n\r\n“I'm awfully glad to meet you, Miss. Wetherell,” said Somers, fervently;\r\n“to tell you the truth, I thought he was just making up yarns.”\r\n\r\n“Yarns?” repeated Cynthia, with a look that set Mr. Duncan floundering.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” he stammered. “Worthy said that you were up here, but I\r\nthought he was crazy the way he talked--I didn't think--”\r\n\r\n“Think what?” inquired Cynthia, but she flushed a little.\r\n\r\n“Oh, rot, Somers!” said Bob, blushing furiously under his tan; “you\r\nought never to go near a woman--you're the darndest fool with 'em I ever\r\nsaw.”\r\n\r\nThis time even the painter laughed outright, and yet he was a little\r\nsorrowful, too, because he could not be even as these youths. But\r\nCynthia sat serene, the eternal feminine of all the ages, and it is no\r\nwonder that Bob Worthington was baffled as he looked at her. He lapsed\r\ninto an awkwardness quite as bad as that of his friend.\r\n\r\n“I hope you enjoyed the game,” he said at last, with a formality that\r\nwas not at all characteristic.\r\n\r\nCynthia did not seem to think it worth while to answer this, so the\r\npainter tried to help him out.\r\n\r\n“That was a fine stop you made, Mr. Worthington,” he said; “wasn't it,\r\nCynthia?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody seemed to think so,” answered Cynthia, cruelly; “but if I\r\nwere a man and had hands like that” (Bob thrust them in his pockets), “I\r\nbelieve I could stop a ball, too.”\r\n\r\nSomers laughed uproariously.\r\n\r\n“Good-by,” said Bob, with uneasy abruptness, “I've got to go into the\r\nfield now. When can I see you?”\r\n\r\n“When you get back from the West--perhaps,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Bob (they were calling him), “I must see you to-night!” He\r\nvaulted over the railing and turned. “I'll come back here right after\r\nthe game,” he said; “there's only one more inning.”\r\n\r\n“We'll come back right after the game,” repeated Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\nBob shot one look at him,--of which Mr. Duncan seemed blissfully\r\nunconscious,--and stalked off abruptly to second base.\r\n\r\nThe artist sat pensive for a few moments, wondering at the ways\r\nof women, his sympathies unaccountably enlisted in behalf of Mr.\r\nWorthington.\r\n\r\n“Weren't you a little hard on him?” he said.\r\n\r\nFor answer Cynthia got to her feet.\r\n\r\n“I think we ought to be going home,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Going home!” he ejaculated in amazement.\r\n\r\n“I promised Uncle Jethro I'd be there for supper,” and she led the way\r\nout of the grand stand.\r\n\r\nSo they drove back to Coniston through the level evening light, and when\r\nthey came to Ephraim Prescott's harness shop the old soldier waved at\r\nthem cheerily from under the big flag which he had hung out in honor\r\nof the day. The flag was silk, and incidentally Ephraim's most valued\r\npossession. Then they drew up before the tannery house, and Cynthia\r\nleaped out of the buggy and held out her hand to the painter with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“It was very good of you to take me,” she said.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass, rugged, uncouth, in rawhide boots and swallowtail and\r\ncoonskin cap, came down from the porch to welcome her, and she ran\r\ntoward him with an eagerness that started the painter to wondering\r\nafresh over the contrasts of life. What, he asked himself, had Fate in\r\nstore for Cynthia Wetherell?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n“H-have a good time, Cynthy?” said Jethro, looking down into her face.\r\nLove had wrought changes in Jethro; mightier changes than he suspected,\r\nand the girl did not know how zealous were the sentries of that love,\r\nhow watchful they were, and how they told him often and again whether\r\nher heart, too, was smiling.\r\n\r\n“It was very gay,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“P-painter-man gay?” inquired Jethro.\r\n\r\nCynthia's eyes were on the orange line of the sunset over Coniston, but\r\nshe laughed a little, indulgently.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Er--that Painter-man hain't such a bad fellow--w-why didn't you ask him\r\nin to supper?”\r\n\r\n“I'll give you three guesses,” said Cynthia, but she did not wait for\r\nthem. “It was because I wanted to be alone with you. Milly's gone out,\r\nhasn't she?”\r\n\r\n“G-gone a-courtin',” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and went into the house to see whether Milly had done her\r\nduty before she left. It was characteristic of Cynthia not to have\r\nmentioned the subject which was agitating her mind until they were\r\nseated on opposite sides of the basswood table.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said, “I thought you told Mr. Sutton to give Cousin\r\nEph the Brampton post-office? Do you trust Mr. Sutton?” she demanded\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n“Er--why?” said Jethro. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because I don't,” she answered with conviction; “I think he's a big\r\nfraud. He must have deceived you, Uncle Jethro. I can't see why you ever\r\nsent him to Congress.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Jethro was in no mood for mirth, he laughed in spite of\r\nhimself, for he was an American. His lifelong habit would have made him\r\ndefend Heth to any one but Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“'D you see Heth, Cynthy?” he asked. “Yes,” replied the girl,\r\ndisgustedly, “I should say I did, but not to speak to him. He was\r\nsitting on Mr. Worthington's porch, and I heard him tell Mr. Worthington\r\nhe would give the Brampton post-office to Dave Wheelock. I don't want\r\nyou to think that I was eavesdropping,” she added quickly; “I couldn't\r\nhelp hearing it.”\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer.\r\n\r\n“You'll make him give the post-office to Cousin Eph, won't you, Uncle\r\nJethro?”\r\n\r\n“Yes;” said Jethro, very simply, “I will.” He meditated awhile, and then\r\nsaid suddenly, “W-won't speak about it--will you, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“You know I won't,” she answered.\r\n\r\nLet it not be thought by any chance that Coniston was given over to\r\nrevelry and late hours, even on the Fourth of July. By ten o'clock the\r\nlights were out in the tannery house, but Cynthia was not asleep. She\r\nsat at her window watching the shy moon peeping over Coniston ridge, and\r\nshe was thinking, to be exact, of how much could happen in one short day\r\nand how little in a long month. She was aroused by the sound of wheels\r\nand the soft beat of a horse's hoofs on the dirt road: then came stifled\r\nlaughter, and suddenly she sprang up alert and tingling. Her own name\r\ncame floating to her through the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that happened will be long remembered in Coniston. A\r\ntentative chord or two from a guitar, and then the startled village\r\nwas listening with all its might to the voices of two young men singing\r\n“When I first went up to Harvard”--probably meant to disclose the\r\nidentity of the serenaders, as if that were necessary! Coniston, never\r\nhaving listened to grand opera, was entertained and thrilled, and\r\nthought the rendering of the song better on the whole than the church\r\nchoir could have done it, or even the quartette that sung at the\r\nBrampton celebrations behind the flowers. Cynthia had her own views on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThere were five other songs--Cynthia remembers all of them, although she\r\nwould not confess such a thing. “Naughty, naughty Clara,” was another\r\none; the other three were almost wholly about love, some treating it\r\nflippantly, others seriously--this applied to the last one, which had\r\nmany farewells in it. Then they went away, and the crickets and frogs on\r\nConiston Water took up the refrain.\r\n\r\nAlthough the occurrence was unusual,--it might almost be said\r\nepoch-making,--Jethro did not speak of it until they had reached the\r\nsparkling heights of Thousand Acre Hill the next morning. Even then he\r\ndid not look at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Know who that was last night, Cynthy?” he inquired, as though the\r\nmatter were a casual one.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Cynthia heroically, “I believe it was a boy named\r\nSomers Duncan-and Bob Worthington.”\r\n\r\n“Er--Bob Worthington,” repeated Jethro, but said nothing more.\r\n\r\nOf course Coniston, and presently Brampton, knew that Bob Worthington\r\nhad serenaded Cynthia--and Coniston and Brampton talked. It is\r\nnoteworthy that (with the jocular exceptions of Ephraim and Lem\r\nHallowell) they did not talk to the girl herself. The painter had long\r\nago discovered that Cynthia was an individual. She had good blood\r\nin her: as a mere child she had shouldered the responsibility of her\r\nfather; she had a natural aptitude for books--a quality reverenced\r\nin the community; she visited, as a matter of habit; the sick and the\r\nunfortunate; and lastly (perhaps the crowning achievement) she had bound\r\nJethro Bass, of all men, with the fetters of love. Of course I have\r\nended up by making her a paragon, although I am merely stating what\r\npeople thought of her. Coniston decided at once that she was to marry\r\nthe heir to the Brampton Mills.\r\n\r\nBut the heir had gone West, and as the summer wore on, the gossip died\r\ndown. Other and more absorbing gossip took its place: never distinctly\r\nformulated, but whispered; always wishing for more definite news that\r\nnever came. The statesmen drove out from Brampton to the door of the\r\ntannery house, as usual, only it was remarked by astute observers and\r\nJake Wheeler that certain statesmen did not come who had been in the\r\nhabit of coming formerly. In short, those who made it a custom to\r\nobserve such matters felt vaguely a disturbance of some kind. The organs\r\nof the people felt it, and became more guarded in their statements. What\r\nno one knew, except Jake and a few in high places, was that a war of no\r\nmean magnitude was impending.\r\n\r\nThere were three men in the State--and perhaps only three--who\r\nrealized from the first that all former political combats would pale\r\nin comparison to this one to come. Similar wars had already started in\r\nother states, and when at length they were fought out another twist\r\nhad been given to the tail of a long-suffering Constitution; political\r\nhistory in the United States had to be written from an entirely new and\r\nunforeseen standpoint, and the unsuspecting people had changed masters.\r\n\r\nThis was to be a war of extermination of one side or the other. No\r\nquarter would be given or asked, and every weapon hitherto known to\r\npolitics would be used. Of the three men who realized this, and all that\r\nwould happen if one side or the other were victorious, one was Alexander\r\nDuncan, another Isaac D. Worthington, and the third was Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nJethro would never have been capable of being master of the state had he\r\nnot foreseen the time when the railroads, tired of paying tribute, would\r\nturn and try to exterminate the boss. The really astonishing thing about\r\nJethro's foresight (known to few only) was that he perceived clearly\r\nthat the time would come when the railroads and other aggregations of\r\ncapital would exterminate the boss, or at least subserviate him. This\r\nalone, the writer thinks, gives him some right to greatness. And Jethro\r\nBass made up his mind that the victory of the railroads, in his state\r\nat least, should not come in his day. He would hold and keep what he had\r\nfought all his life to gain.\r\n\r\nJethro knew, when Jake Wheeler failed to bring him a message back\r\nfrom Clovelly, that the war had begun, and that Isaac D. Worthington,\r\ncommander of the railroad forces in the field, had captured his pawn,\r\nthe hill-Rajah. By getting through to Harwich, the Truro had made a\r\nsad muddle in railroad affairs. It was now a connecting link; and its\r\npresident, the first citizen of Brampton, a man of no small importance\r\nin the state. This fact was not lost upon Jethro, who perceived\r\nclearly enough the fight for consolidation that was coming in the next\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nSeated on an old haystack on Thousand Acre Hill, that sits in turn on\r\nthe lap of Coniston, Jethro smiled as he reflected that the first\r\ntrial of strength in this mighty struggle was to be over (what the\r\nunsuspecting world would deem a trivial matter) the postmastership of\r\nBrampton. And Worthington's first move in the game would be to attempt\r\nto capture for his faction the support of the Administration itself.\r\n\r\nJethro thought the view from Thousand Acre Hill, especially in\r\nSeptember, to be one of the sublimest efforts of the Creator. It was\r\nSeptember, first of the purple months in Coniston, not the red-purple of\r\nthe Maine coast, but the blue-purple of the mountain, the color of the\r\nbloom on the Concord grape. His eyes, sweeping the mountain from\r\nthe notch to the granite ramp of the northern buttress, fell on the\r\nweather-beaten little farmhouse in which he had lived for many years,\r\nand rested lovingly on the orchard, where the golden early apples shone\r\namong the leaves. But Jethro was not looking at the apples.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy,” he called out abruptly, “h-how'd you like to go to\r\nWashington?”\r\n\r\n“Washington!” exclaimed Cynthia. “When?”\r\n\r\n“N-now--to-morrow.” Then he added uneasily, “C-can't you get ready?”\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed.\r\n\r\n“Why, I'll go to-night, Uncle Jethro,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said admiringly, “you hain't one of them clutterin' females.\r\nWe can get some finery for you in New York, Cynthy. D-don't want any of\r\nthem town ladies to put you to shame. Er--not that they would,” he added\r\nhastily--“not that they would.”\r\n\r\nCynthia climbed up beside him on the haystack.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said solemnly, “when you make a senator or a judge,\r\nI don't interfere, do I?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her uneasily, for there were moments when he could not for\r\nthe life of him make out her drift.\r\n\r\n“N-no,” he assented, “of course not, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\n“Why is it that I don't interfere?”\r\n\r\n“I callate,” answered Jethro, still more uneasily, “I callate it's\r\nbecause you're a woman.”\r\n\r\n“And don't you think,” asked Cynthia, “that a woman ought to know what\r\nbecomes her best?”\r\n\r\nJethro reflected, and then his glance fell on her approvingly.\r\n\r\n“G-guess you're right, Cynthy,” he said. “I always had some success in\r\ndressin' up Listy, and that kind of set me up.”\r\n\r\nOn such occasions he spoke of his wife quite simply. He had been\r\ngenuinely fond of her, although she was no more than an episode in his\r\nlife. Cynthia smiled to herself as they walked through the orchard to\r\nthe place where the horse was tied, but she was a little remorseful.\r\nThis feeling, on the drive homeward, was swept away by sheer elation at\r\nthe prospect of the trip before her. She had often dreamed of the great\r\nworld beyond Coniston, and no one, not even Jethro, had guessed the\r\nlongings to see it which had at times beset her. Often she had dropped\r\nher book to summon up a picture of what a great city was like, to\r\nreconstruct the Boston of her early childhood. She remembered the Mall,\r\nwhere she used to walk with her father, and the row of houses where\r\nthe rich dwelt, which had seemed like palaces. Indeed, when she read of\r\npalaces, these houses always came to her mind. And now she was to behold\r\na palace even greater than these,--and the house where the President\r\nhimself dwelt. But why was Jethro going to Washington?\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to the question, he drove directly to the harness shop\r\ninstead of to the tannery house. Ephraim greeted them from within with a\r\ncheery hail, and hobbled out and stood between the wheels of the buggy.\r\n\r\n“That bridle bust again?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Er--Ephraim,” said Jethro, “how long since you b'en away from\r\nConiston--how long?”\r\n\r\nEphraim reflected.\r\n\r\n“I went to Harwich with Moses before that bad spell I had in March,” he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled from pure happiness, for she began to see the drift of\r\nthings now.\r\n\r\n“H-how long since you've b'en in foreign parts?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“'Sixty-five,” answered Ephraim, with astonishing promptness.\r\n\r\n“Er--like to go to Washington with us to-morrow like to go to\r\nWashington?”\r\n\r\nEphraim gasped, even as Cynthia had.\r\n\r\n“Washin'ton!” he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy and I was thinkin' of takin' a little trip,” said Jethro, almost\r\napologetically, “and we kind of thought we'd like to have you with us.\r\nDidn't we, Cynthy? Er--we might see General Grant,” he added meaningly.\r\n\r\nEphraim was a New Englander, and not an adept in expressing his\r\nemotions. Both Cynthia and Jethro felt that he would have liked to have\r\nsaid something appropriate if he had known how. What he actually said\r\nwas:--“What time to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“C-callate to take the nine o'clock from Brampton,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I'll report for duty at seven,” said Ephraim, and it was then he\r\nsqueezed the hand that he found in his. He watched them calmly enough\r\nuntil they had disappeared in the barn behind the tannery house, and\r\nthen his thoughts became riotous. Rumors had been rife that summer,\r\nprophecies of changes to come, and the resignation of the old man who\r\nhad so long been postmaster at Brampton was freely discussed--or rather\r\nthe matter of his successor. As the months passed, Ephraim had heard\r\nDavid Wheelock mentioned with more and more assurance for the place. He\r\nhad had many nights when sleep failed him, but it was characteristic of\r\nthe old soldier that he had never once broached the subject since Jethro\r\nhad spoken to him two months before. Ephraim had even looked up the law\r\nto see if he was eligible, and found that he was, since Coniston had\r\nno post-office, and was within the limits of delivery of the Brampton\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Coniston was treated to a genuine surprise. After\r\nloading up at the store, Lem Hallowell, instead of heading for Brampton,\r\ndrove to the tannery house, left his horses standing as he ran in, and\r\npresently emerged with a little cowhide trunk that bore the letter W.\r\nFollowing the trunk came a radiant Cynthia, following Cynthia, Jethro\r\nBass in a stove-pipe hat, with a carpetbag, and hobbling after Jethro,\r\nEphraim Prescott, with another carpet-bag. It was remarked in the buzz\r\nof query that followed the stage's departure that Ephraim wore the blue\r\nsuit and the army hat with a cord around it which he kept for occasions.\r\nConiston longed to follow them, in spirit at least, but even Milly\r\nSkinner did not know their destination.\r\n\r\nFortunately we can follow them. At Brampton station they got into the\r\nlittle train that had just come over Truro Pass, and steamed, with many\r\nstops, down the valley of Coniston Water until it stretched out into a\r\nwide range of shimmering green meadows guarded by blue hills veiled in\r\nthe morning haze. Then, bustling Harwich, and a wait of half an hour\r\nuntil the express from the north country came thundering through the\r\nGap; then a five-hours' journey down the broad river that runs southward\r\nbetween the hills, dinner in a huge station amidst a pleasant buzz\r\nof excitement and the ringing of many bells. Then into another train,\r\nthrough valleys and factory towns and cities until they came, at\r\nnightfall, to the metropolis itself.\r\n\r\nCynthia will always remember the awe with which that first view of New\r\nYork inspired her, and Ephraim confessed that he, too, had felt it, when\r\nhe had first seen the myriad lights of the city after the long, dusty\r\nride from the hills with his regiment. For all the flags and bunting it\r\nhad held in '61, Ephraim thought that city crueller than war itself.\r\nAnd Cynthia thought so too, as she clung to Jethro's arm between the\r\ncarriages and the clanging street-cars, and looked upon the riches and\r\npoverty around her. There entered her soul that night a sense of that\r\nwhich is the worst cruelty of all--the cruelty of selfishness. Every\r\nman going his own pace, seeking to gratify his own aims and desires,\r\nunconscious and heedless of the want with which he rubs elbows. Her\r\nnatural imagination enhanced by her life among the hills, the girl\r\npeopled the place in the street lights with all kinds of strange\r\nevil-doers of whose sins she knew nothing, adventurers, charlatans,\r\nalert cormorants, who preyed upon the unwary. She shrank closer to\r\nEphraim from a perfumed lady who sat next to her in the car, and was\r\nthankful when at last they found themselves in the corridor of the Astor\r\nHouse standing before the desk.\r\n\r\nHotel clerks, especially city ones, are supernatural persons. This one\r\nknew Jethro, greeted him deferentially as Judge Bass, and dipped the\r\npen in the ink and handed it to him that he might register. By half-past\r\nnine Cynthia was dreaming of Lem Hallowell and Coniston, and Lem was\r\ndriving a yellow street-car full of queer people down the road to\r\nBrampton.\r\n\r\nThere were few guests in the great dining room when they breakfasted at\r\nseven the next morning. New York, in the sunlight, had taken on a more\r\nkindly expression, and those who were near by smiled at them and seemed\r\nfull of good-will. Persons smiled at them that day as they walked the\r\nstreets or stood spellbound before the shop windows, and some who saw\r\nthem felt a lump rise in their throats at the memories they aroused of\r\nforgotten days: the three seemed to bring the very air of the hills with\r\nthem into that teeming place, and many who, had come to the city with\r\nhigh hopes, now in the shackles of drudgery; looked after them. They\r\nwere a curious party, indeed: the straight, dark girl with the light in\r\nher eyes and the color in her cheeks; the quaint, rugged figure of\r\nthe elderly man in his swallow-tail and brass buttons and square-toed,\r\ncountry boots; and the old soldier hobbling along with the aid of his\r\ngreen umbrella, clad in the blue he had loved and suffered for. Had they\r\nremained until Sunday, they might have read an amusing account of their\r\nvisit,--of Jethro's suppers of crackers and milk at the Astor House,\r\nof their progress along Broadway. The story was not lacking in pathos,\r\neither, and in real human feeling, for the young reporter who wrote it\r\nhad come, not many years before, from the hills himself. But by that\r\ntime they had accomplished another marvellous span in their journey, and\r\nwere come to Washington itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCynthia was deprived, too, of that thrilling first view of the capital\r\nfrom the train which she had pictured, for night had fallen when they\r\nreached Washington likewise. As the train slowed down, she leaned a\r\nlittle out of the window and looked at the shabby houses and shabby\r\nstreets revealed by the flickering lights in the lamp-posts. Finally\r\nthey came to a shabby station, were seized upon by a grinning darky\r\nhackman, who would not take no for an answer, and were rattled away\r\nto the hotel. Although he had been to Washington but once in his life\r\nbefore, as a Lincoln elector, Jethro was greeted as an old acquaintance\r\nby this clerk also.\r\n\r\n“Glad to see you, Judge,” said he, genially. “Train late? You've come\r\npurty nigh, missin' supper.”\r\n\r\nA familiar of great men, the clerk was not offended when he got no\r\nresponse to his welcome. Cynthia and Ephraim, intent on getting rid of\r\nsome of the dust of their journey, followed the colored hallboy up\r\nthe stairs. Jethro stood poring over the register, when a\r\ndistinguished-looking elderly gentleman with a heavy gray beard and eyes\r\nfull of shrewdness and humor paused at the desk to ask a question.\r\n\r\n“Er--Senator?”\r\n\r\nThe senator (for such he was, although he did not represent Jethro's\r\nstate) turned and stared, and then held out his hand with unmistakable\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass,” he exclaimed, “upon my word! What are you doing in\r\nWashington?”\r\n\r\nJethro took the hand, but he did not answer the question.\r\n\r\n“Er--Senator--when can I see the President?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” answered the senator, somewhat taken aback, “why, to-night, if\r\nyou like. I'm going to the White House in a few minutes and I think I\r\ncan arrange it.”\r\n\r\n“T-to-morrow afternoon--t-to-morrow afternoon?”\r\n\r\nThe senator cast his eye over the swallow-tail coat and stove-pipe hat\r\ntilted back, and laughed.\r\n\r\n“Thunder!” he exclaimed, “you haven't changed a bit. I'm beginning to\r\nlook like an old man; but that milk-and-crackers diet seems to keep you\r\nyoung, Jethro. I'll fix it for to-morrow afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“W-what time--two?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll fix it for two to-morrow afternoon. I never could understand\r\nyou, Jethro; you don't do things like other men. Do I smell gunpowder?\r\nWhat's up now--what do you want to see Grant about?”\r\n\r\nJethro cast his eye around the corridor, where a few men were taking\r\ntheir ease after supper, and looked at the senator mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“Any place where we can talk?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“We can go into the writing room and shut the door,” answered the\r\nsenator, more amused than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Cynthia came downstairs, Jethro was standing with the gentleman in\r\nthe corridor leading to the dining room, and she heard the gentleman say\r\nas he took his departure:--“I haven't forgotten what you did for us in\r\n'70, Jethro. I'll go right along and see to it now.”\r\n\r\nCynthia liked the gentleman's looks, and rightly surmised that he was\r\none of the big men of the nation. She was about to ask Jethro his name\r\nwhen Ephraim came limping along and put the matter out of her mind, and\r\nthe three went into the almost empty dining room. There they were served\r\nwith elaborate attention by a darky waiter who had, in some mysterious\r\nway, learned Jethro's name and title. Cynthia reflected with pride that\r\nJethro, too, was one of the nation's great men, who could get anything\r\nhe wanted simply by coming to the capital and asking for it.\r\n\r\nEphraim was very much excited on finding himself in Washington, the\r\nsight of the place reviving in his mind a score of forgotten incidents\r\nof the war. After supper they found seats in a corner of the corridor,\r\nwhere a number of people were scattered about, smoking and talking.\r\nIt did not occur to Jethro or Cynthia, or even to Ephraim, that these\r\npeople were all of the male sex, and on the other hand the guests of\r\nthe hotel were apparently used once in a while to see a lady from the\r\ncountry seated there. At any rate, Cynthia was but a young girl, and\r\nher two companions, however unusual their appearance, were clearly most\r\nrespectable. Jethro, his hands in his pockets and his hat tilted, sat\r\non the small of his back rapt in meditation; Cynthia, her head awhirl,\r\nlooked around her with sparkling eyes; while Ephraim was smoking a cigar\r\nhe had saved for just such a festal occasion. He did not see the stout\r\nman with the button and corded hat until he was almost on top of him.\r\n\r\n“Eph Prescott, I believe!” exclaimed the stout one. “How be you,\r\nComrade?”\r\n\r\nHeedless of his rheumatism, Ephraim sprang to his feet and dropped the\r\ncigar, which the stout one picked up with much difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Ephraim, in a voice that shook with unwonted emotion, “you\r\nkin skin me if it ain't Amasy Beard!” His eye travelled around Amasa's\r\nfigure. “Wouldn't a-knowed you, I swan, I wouldn't. Why, when I seen you\r\nlast, Amasy, your stomach was havin' all it could do to git hold of your\r\nbackbone.”\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright, and even Jethro sat up and smiled.\r\n\r\n“When was it?” said Amasa, still clinging on to Ephraim's hand and\r\nincidentally to the cigar, which Ephraim had forgotten; “Beaver Creek,\r\nwahn't it?”\r\n\r\n“July 10, 1863,” said Ephraim, instantly.\r\n\r\nGradually they reached a sitting position, the cigar was restored to\r\nits rightful owner, and Mr. Beard was introduced, with some ceremony, to\r\nCynthia and Jethro. From Beaver Creek they began to fight the war over\r\nagain, backward and forward, much to Cynthia's edification, when her\r\nattention was distracted by the entrance of a street band of wind\r\ninstruments. As the musicians made their way to another corner and\r\nbegan tuning up, she glanced mischievously at Jethro, for she knew his\r\npeculiarities by heart. One of these was a most violent detestation of\r\nany but the best music. He had often given her this excuse, laughingly,\r\nfor not going to meeting in Coniston. How he had come by his love for\r\ngood music, Cynthia never knew--he certainly had not heard much of it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great volume of sound filled the corridor, and the band\r\nburst forth into what many supposed to be “The Watch on the Rhine.” Some\r\npeople were plainly delighted; the veterans, once recovered from their\r\nsurprise, shouted their reminiscences above the music, undismayed;\r\nJethro held on to himself until the refrain, when he began to squirm,\r\nand as soon as the tune was done and the scattering applause had died\r\ndown, he reached over and grabbed Mr. Amasa Beard by the knee. Mr. Beard\r\ndid not immediately respond, being at that moment behind logworks facing\r\na rebel charge; he felt vaguely that some one was trying to distract his\r\nattention, and in some lobe of his brain was registered the fact that\r\nthat particular knee had gout in it. Jethro increased the pressure, and\r\nthen Mr. Beard abandoned his logworks and swung around with a snort of\r\npain.\r\n\r\n“H-how much do they git for that noise--h-how much do they git?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beard tenderly lifted the hand from his knee and stared at Jethro\r\nwith his mouth open, like a man aroused from a bad dream.\r\n\r\n“Who? What noise?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“The Dutchmen,” said Jethro. “H-how much do they git for that noise?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Mr. Beard glanced at the band and began to laugh. He thought\r\nJethro a queer customer, no doubt, but he was a friend of Comrade\r\nPrescott's. “By gum!” said Mr. Beard, “I thought for a minute a rebel\r\nchain-shot had took my leg off. Well, sir, I guess that band gets about\r\ntwo dollars. They've come in here every evening since I've been at the\r\nhotel.”\r\n\r\n“T-two dollars? Is that the price? Er--you say two dollars is their\r\nprice?”\r\n\r\n“Thereabouts,” answered Mr. Beard, uneasily. Veteran as he was, Jethro's\r\nappearance and earnestness were a little alarming.\r\n\r\n“You say two dollars is their price?”\r\n\r\n“Thereabouts,” shouted Mr. Beard, seating himself on the edge of his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nBut Jethro paid no attention to him. He rose, unfolding by degrees his\r\nsix feet two, and strode diagonally across the corridor toward the band\r\nleader. Conversation was hushed at the sight of his figure, a titter ran\r\naround the walls, but Jethro was oblivious to these things. He drew a\r\ngreat calfskin wallet from an inside pocket of his coat, and the band\r\nleader, a florid German, laid down his instrument and made an elaborate\r\nbow. Jethro waited until the man had become upright and then held out a\r\ntwo-dollar bill.\r\n\r\n“Is that about right for the performance?” he said “is that about\r\nright?”\r\n\r\n“Ja, mein Herr,” said the man, nodding vociferously.\r\n\r\n“I want to pay what's right--I want to pay what's right,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“I thank you very much, sir,” said the leader, finding his English, “you\r\nhaf pay for all.”\r\n\r\n“P-paid for everything--everything to-night?” demanded Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe leader spread out his hands.\r\n\r\n“You haf pay for one whole evening,” said he, and bowed again.\r\n\r\n“Then take it, take it,” said Jethro, pushing the bill into the man's\r\npalm; “but don't you come back to-night--don't you come back to-night.”\r\n\r\nThe amazed leader stared at Jethro--and words failed him. There was\r\nsomething about this man that compelled him to obey, and he gathered\r\nup his followers and led the way silently out of the hotel. Roars of\r\nlaughter and applause arose on all sides; but Jethro was as one who\r\nheard them not as he made his way back to his seat again.\r\n\r\n“You did a good job, my friend,” said Mr. Beard, approvingly. “I'm going\r\nto take Eph Prescott down the street to see some of the boys. Won't you\r\ncome, too?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beard doubtless accepted it as one of the man's eccentricities that\r\nJethro did not respond to him, for without more ado he departed arm in\r\narm with Ephraim. Jethro was looking at Cynthia, who was staring toward\r\nthe desk at the other end of the corridor, her face flushed, and her\r\nfingers closed over the arms of her chair. It never occurred to Jethro\r\nthat she might have been embarrassed.\r\n\r\n“W-what's the matter, Cynthy?” he asked, sinking into the chair beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer breath caught sharply, but she tried to smile at him. He did not\r\ndiscover what was the matter until long afterward, when he recalled\r\nthat evening to mind. Jethro was a man used to hotel corridors, used to\r\nsitting in an attitude that led the unsuspecting to believe he was half\r\nasleep; but no person of note could come or go whom he did not remember.\r\nHe had seen the distinguished party arrive at the desk, preceded by a\r\nhost of bell-boys with shawls and luggage. On the other hand, some of\r\nthe distinguished party had watched the proceeding of paying off the\r\nband with no little amusement. Miss Janet Duncan had giggled audibly,\r\nher mother had smiled, while her father and Mr. Worthington had\r\npretended to be deeply occupied with the hotel register. Somers was not\r\nthere. Bob Worthington laughed heartily with the rest until his eye,\r\ntravelling down the line of Jethro's progress, fell on Cynthia, and now\r\nhe was striding across the floor toward them. And even in the horrible\r\nconfusion of that moment Cynthia had a vagrant thought that his clothes\r\nhad an enviable cut and became him remarkably.\r\n\r\n“Well, of all things, to find you here!” he cried; “this is the best\r\nluck that ever happened. I am glad to see you. I was going to steal away\r\nto Brampton for a couple of days before the term opened, and I meant to\r\nlook you up there. And Mr. Bass,” said Bob, turning to Jethro, “I'm glad\r\nto see you too.”\r\n\r\nJethro looked at the young man and smiled and held out his hand. It was\r\nevident that Bob was blissfully unaware that hostilities between powers\r\nof no mean magnitude were about to begin; that the generals themselves\r\nwere on the ground, and that he was holding treasonable parley with the\r\nenemy. The situation appealed to Jethro, especially as he glanced at the\r\nbacks of the two gentlemen facing the desk. These backs seemed to him\r\nfull of expression. “Th-thank you, Bob, th-thank you,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I like the way you fixed that band,” said Bob; “I haven't laughed as\r\nmuch for a year. You hate music, don't you? I hope you'll forgive that\r\nawful noise we made outside of your house last July, Mr. Bass.”\r\n\r\n“You--you make that noise, Bob, you--you make that?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bob, “I'm afraid I did most of it. There was another fellow\r\nthat helped some and played the guitar. It was pretty bad,” he added,\r\nwith a side glance at Cynthia, “but it was meant for a compliment.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said she, “it was meant for a compliment, was it?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he answered, glad of the opportunity to turn his attention\r\nentirely to her. “I was for slipping away right after supper, but my\r\nfather headed us off.”\r\n\r\n“Slipping away?” repeated Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“You see, he had a kind of a reception and fireworks afterward. We\r\ndidn't get away till after nine, and then I thought I'd have a lecture\r\nwhen I got home.”\r\n\r\n“Did you?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bob, “he didn't know where I'd been.”\r\n\r\nCynthia felt the blood rush to her temples, but by habit and instinct\r\nshe knew when to restrain herself.\r\n\r\n“Would it have made any difference to him where you had been?” she asked\r\ncalmly enough.\r\n\r\nBob had a presentiment that he was on dangerous ground. This new and\r\nself-possessed Cynthia was an enigma to him--certainly a fascinating\r\nenigma.\r\n\r\n“My father world have thought I was a fool to go off serenading,” he\r\nanswered, flushing. Bob did not like a lie; he knew that his father\r\nwould have been angry if he had heard he had gone to Coniston; he felt,\r\nin the small of his back, that his father was angry mow, and guessed the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nShe regarded him gravely as he spoke, and then her eyes left his face\r\nand became fixed upon an object at the far end of the corridor. Bob\r\nturned in time to see Janet Duncan swing on her heel and follow her\r\nmother up the stairs. He struggled to find words to tide over what he\r\nfelt was an awkward moment.\r\n\r\n“We've had a fine trip;” he said, “though I should much rather have\r\nstayed at home. The West is a wonderful country, with its canons and\r\nmountains and great stretches of plain. My father met us in Chicago, and\r\nwe came here. I don't know why, because Washington's dead at this time\r\nof the year. I suppose it must be on account of politics.” Looking at\r\nJethro with a sudden inspiration, “I hadn't thought of that.”\r\n\r\nJethro had betrayed no interest in the conversation. He was seated,\r\nas usual, on the small of his back. But he saw a young man of short\r\nstature, with a freckled face and close-cropped, curly red hair, come\r\ninto the corridor by another entrance; he saw Isaac D. Worthington draw\r\nhim aside and speak to him, and he saw the young man coming towards\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Miss Wetherell?” cried the young man joyously, while\r\nstill ten feet away, “I'm awfully glad to see you, upon my word; I am.\r\nHow long are you going to be in Washington?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know, Mr. Duncan,” answered Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Did Worthy know you were here?” demanded Mr. Duncan, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“He did when he saw me,” said Cynthia, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Not till then?” asked Mr. Duncan. “Say, Worthy; your father wants to\r\nsee you right away. I'm going to be in Washington a day or two--will you\r\ngo walking with me to-morrow morning, Miss Wetherell?”\r\n\r\n“She's going walking with me,” said Bob, not in the best of tempers.\r\n\r\n“Then I'll go along,” said Mr. Duncan, promptly.\r\n\r\nBy this time Cynthia got up and was holding out her hand to Bob\r\nWorthington. “I'm not going walking with either of you,” she said\r\n“I have another engagement. And I think I'll have to say good night,\r\nbecause I'm very tired.”\r\n\r\n“When can I see you?” Both the young men asked the question at once.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you'll have plenty of chances,” she answered, and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe young men looked at each other somewhat blankly; and then down at\r\nJethro, who did not seem to know that they were there, and then they\r\nmade their way toward the desk. But Isaac D. Worthington and his friends\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the distinguished-looking senator with whom Jethro\r\nhad been in conversation before supper entered the hotel. He seemed\r\npreoccupied, and heedless of the salutations he received; but when he\r\ncaught sight of Jethro he crossed the corridor rapidly and sat down\r\nbeside him. Jethro did not move. The corridor was deserted now, save for\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n“Bass,” began the senator, “what's the row up in your state?”\r\n\r\n“H-haven't heard of any row,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“What did you come to Washington for?” demanded the senator, somewhat\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n“Er--vacation,” said Jethro, “vacation--to show my gal, Cynthy, the\r\ncapital.”\r\n\r\n“Now see here, Bass,” said the senator, “I don't forget what happened\r\nin '70. I don't object to wading through a swarm of bees to get a little\r\nhoney for a friend, but I think I'm entitled to know why he wants it.”\r\n\r\n“G-got the honey?” asked Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe senator took off his hat and wiped his brow, and then he stole a\r\nlook at Jethro, with apparently barren results.\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” he said, “people say you run that state of yours right up\r\nto the handle. What's all this trouble about a two-for-a-cent\r\npostmastership?”\r\n\r\n“H-haven't heard of any trouble,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Well, there is trouble,” said the senator, losing patience at last.\r\n“When I told Grant you were here and mentioned that little Brampton\r\nmatter to him,--it didn't seem much to me,--the bees began to fly pretty\r\nthick, I can tell you. I saw right away that somebody had been stirring\r\n'em up. It looks to me, Jethro,” said the senator gravely, “it looks to\r\nme as if you had something of a rebellion on your hands.”\r\n\r\n“W-what'd Grant say?” Jethro inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, he didn't say a great deal--he isn't much of a talker, you know,\r\nbut what he did say was to the point. It seems that your man, Prescott,\r\ndoesn't come from Brampton, in the first place, and Grant says that\r\nwhile he likes soldiers, he hasn't any use for the kind that want to\r\nlie down and make the government support 'em. I'll tell you what I\r\nfound out. Worthington and Duncan wired the President this morning, and\r\nthey've gone up to the White House now. They've got a lot of railroad\r\ninterests back of them, and they've taken your friend Sutton into camp;\r\nbut I managed to get the President to promise not to do anything until\r\nhe saw you tomorrow afternoon at two.”\r\n\r\nJethro sat silent so long that the senator began to think he wasn't\r\ngoing to answer him at all. In his opinion, he had told Jethro some very\r\ngrave facts.\r\n\r\n“W-when are you going to see the President again?” said Jethro, at last.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow morning,” answered the senator; “he wants me to walk over\r\nwith him to see the postmaster-general, who is sick in bed.”\r\n\r\n“What time do you leave the White House?--”\r\n\r\n“At eleven,” said the senator, very much puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Er--Grant ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street?”\r\n\r\nThe senator glanced at Jethro, and a twinkle came into his eye.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes he has been known to,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“You--you ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street?”\r\n\r\nThen the senator's eyes began to snap.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I have been known to.”\r\n\r\n“Er--suppose an old soldier was in front of the White House at eleven\r\no'clock--an old soldier with a gal suppose?”\r\n\r\nThe senator saw the point, and took no pains to restrain his admiration.\r\n\r\n“Jethro,” he said, slapping him on the shoulder, “I'm willing to bet a\r\nfew thousand dollars you'll run your state for a while yet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n“Heard you say you was goin' for a walk this morning, Cynthy,” Jethro\r\nremarked, as they sat at breakfast the next morning.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” answered Cynthia, “Cousin Eph and I are going out to\r\nsee Washington, and he is to show me the places that he remembers.” She\r\nlooked at Jethro appealingly. “Aren't you coming with us?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“M-meet you at eleven, Cynthy,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Eleven!” exclaimed Cynthia in dismay, “that's almost dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“M-meet you in front of the White House at eleven,” said Jethro, “plumb\r\nin front of it, under a tree.”\r\n\r\nBy half-past seven, Cynthia and Ephraim with his green umbrella were\r\nin the street, but it would be useless to burden these pages with a\r\ndescription of all the sights they saw, and with the things that Ephraim\r\nsaid about them, and incidentally about the war. After New York, much of\r\nWashington would then have seemed small and ragged to any one who lacked\r\nideals and a national sense, but Washington was to Cynthia as Athens\r\nto a Greek. To her the marble Capitol shining on its hill was a sacred\r\ntemple, and the great shaft that struck upward through the sunlight,\r\nthough yet unfinished, a fitting memorial to him who had led the\r\nbarefoot soldiers of the colonies through ridicule to victory. They\r\nlooked up many institutions and monument, they even had time to go to\r\nthe Navy Yard, and they saved the contemplation of the White House till\r\nthe last. The White House, which Cynthia thought the finest and most\r\ngraceful mansion in all the world, in its simplicity and dignity, a\r\nfitting dwelling for the chosen of the nation. Under the little tree\r\nwhich Jethro had mentioned, Ephraim stood bareheaded before the walls\r\nwhich had sheltered Lincoln, which were now the home of the greatest\r\nof his captains, Grant: and wondrous emotions played upon the girl's\r\nspirit, too, as she gazed. They forgot the present in the past and the\r\nfuture, and they did not see the two gentlemen who had left the portico\r\nsome minutes before and were now coming toward them along the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen, however, slowed their steps involuntarily at a\r\nsight which was uncommon, even in Washington. The girl's arm was in the\r\nsoldier's, and her face, which even in repose had a true nobility, now\r\nwas alight with an inspiration that is seen but seldom in a lifetime. In\r\nmarble, could it have been wrought by a great sculptor, men would have\r\ndreamed before it of high things.\r\n\r\nThe two, indeed, might have stood for a group, the girl as the spirit,\r\nthe man as the body which had risked and suffered all for it, and still\r\nheld it fast. For the honest face of the soldier reflected that spirit\r\nas truly as a mirror.\r\n\r\nEphraim was aroused from his thoughts by Cynthia nudging his arm. He\r\nstarted, put on his hat, and stared very hard at a man smoking a cigar\r\nwho was standing before him. Then he stiffened and raised his hand in\r\nan involuntary salute. The man smiled. He was not very tall, he had a\r\nclosely trimmed light beard that was growing a little gray, he wore a\r\nsoft hat something like Ephraim's, a black tie on a white pleated shirt,\r\nand his eyeglasses were pinned to his vest. His eyes were all kindness.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Comrade?” he said, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n“General,” said Ephraim, “Mr. President,” he added, correcting himself,\r\n“how be you?” He shifted the green umbrella, and shook the hand timidly\r\nbut warmly.\r\n\r\n“General will do,” said the President, with a smiling glance at the tall\r\nsenator beside him, “I like to be called General.”\r\n\r\n“You've growed some older, General,” said Ephraim, scanning his face\r\nwith a simple reverence and affection, “but you hain't changed so much\r\nas I'd a thought since I saw you whittlin' under a tree beside the Lacy\r\nhouse in the Wilderness.”\r\n\r\n“My duty has changed some,” answered the President, quite as simply. He\r\nadded with a touch of sadness, “I liked those days best, Comrade.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess!” exclaimed Ephraim, “you're general over everything now,\r\nbut you're not a mite bigger man to me than you was.”\r\n\r\nThe President took the compliment as it was meant.\r\n\r\n“I found it easier to run an army than I do to run a country,” he said.\r\n\r\nEphraim's blue eyes flamed with indignation.\r\n\r\n“I don't take no stock in the bull-dogs and the gold harness at Long\r\nBranch and--and all them lies the dratted newspapers print about\r\nyou,”--Ephraim hammered his umbrella on the pavement as an expression of\r\nhis feelings,--“and what's more, the people don't.”\r\n\r\nThe President glanced at the senator again, and laughed a little,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you; Comrade,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You're a plain, common man,” continued Ephraim, paying the highest\r\ncompliment known to rural New England; “the people think a sight of you,\r\nor they wouldn't hev chose you twice, General.”\r\n\r\n“So you were in the Wilderness?” said the President, adroitly changing\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“Yes, General. I was pressed into orderly duty the first day--that's\r\nwhen I saw you whittlin' under the tree, and you didn't seem to have no\r\nmore consarn than if it had been a company drill. Had a cigar then, too.\r\nBut the second day; May the 6th, I was with the regiment. I'll never\r\nforget that day,” said Ephraim, warming to the subject, “when we was\r\nfightin' Ewell up and down the Orange Plank Road, playin' hide-and-seek\r\nwith the Johnnies in the woods. You remember them woods, General?”\r\n\r\nThe President nodded, his cigar between his teeth. He looked as though\r\nthe scene were coming back to him.\r\n\r\n“Never seen such woods,” said Ephraim, “scrub oak and pine and cedars\r\nand young stuff springin' up until you couldn't see the length of a\r\ncompany, and the Rebs jumpin' and hollerin' around and shoutin' every\r\nwhich way. After a while a lot of them saplings was mowed off clean by\r\nthe bullets, and then the woods caught afire, and that was hell.”\r\n\r\n“Were you wounded?” asked the President, quickly.\r\n\r\n“I was hurt some, in the hip,” answered Ephraim.\r\n\r\n“Some!” exclaimed Cynthia, “why, you have walked lame ever since.” She\r\nknew the story by heart, but the recital of it never failed to stir her\r\nblood! “They carried him out just as he was going to be burned up, in a\r\nblanket hung from rifles, and he was in the hospital nine months, and\r\nhad to come home for a while.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthy,” said Ephraim in gentle reproof, “I callate the General don't\r\nwant to hear that.”\r\n\r\nCynthia flushed, but the President looked at her with an added interest.\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady,” he said, “that seems to me the vital part of the\r\nstory. If I remember rightly,” he added, turning again to Ephraim, “the\r\nFifth Corps was on the Orange turnpike. What brigade were you in?”\r\n\r\n“The third brigade of the First Division,” answered Ephraim.\r\n\r\n“Griffin's,” said the President. “There were several splendid New\r\nEngland regiments in that brigade. I sent them with Griffin to help\r\nSheridan at Five Forks.”\r\n\r\n“I was thar too,” cried Ephraim.\r\n\r\n“What!” said the President, “with the lame hip?”\r\n\r\n“Well, General, I went back, I couldn't help it. I couldn't stay away\r\nfrom the boys--just couldn't. I didn't limp as bad then as I do now. I\r\nwahn't much use anywhere else, and I had l'arned to fight. Five Forks!”\r\n exclaimed Ephraim. “I call that day to mind as if it was yesterday. I\r\nremember how the boys yelled when they told us we was goin' to Sheridan.\r\nWe got started about daylight, and it took us till four o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon to git into position. The woods was just comin' a little\r\ngreen, and the white dogwoods was bloomin' around. Sheridan, he galloped\r\nup to the line with that black horse of his'n and hollered out, 'Come\r\non, boys, go in at a clean, jump or You won't ketch one of 'em.' You\r\nknow how men, even veterans like that Fifth Corps, sometimes hev to be\r\npushed into a fight. There was a man from a Maine regiment got shot in\r\nthe head fust thing. 'I'm killed,' said he. 'Oh, no, you're not,' says\r\nSheridan, 'pickup your gun and go for 'em.' But he was killed. Well,\r\nwe went for 'em through all the swamps and briers and everything, and\r\nSheridan, thar in front, had got the battle-flag and was rushin' round\r\nwith it swearin' and prayin' and shoutin', and the first thing we knowed\r\nhe'd jumped his horse clean over their logworks and landed right on top\r\nof the Johnnie's.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the President, “that was Sheridan, sure enough.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” said the senator, who stood by wonderingly while\r\nGeneral Grant had lost himself in this conversation, “do you realize\r\nwhat time it is?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said the President, “we must go on. What was your rank,\r\nComrade?”\r\n\r\n“Sergeant, General.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you have got a good pension for that hip,” said the President,\r\nkindly. It may be well to add that he was not always so incautious, but\r\nthis soldier bore the unmistakable stamp of simplicity and sincerity on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nEphraim hesitated.\r\n\r\n“He never would ask for a pension, General,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed the President in real astonishment, “are you so rich\r\nas all that?” and he glanced at the green umbrella.\r\n\r\n“Well, General,” said Ephraim, uncomfortably, “I never liked the notion\r\nof gittin' paid for it. You see, I was what they call a war-Democrat.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said the President, but more to himself. “What do you do\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“I callate to make harness,” answered Ephraim.\r\n\r\n“Only he can't make it any more on account of his rheumatism, Mr.\r\nPresident,” Cynthia put in.\r\n\r\n“I think you might call me General, too,” he said, with the grace that\r\nmany simple people found inherent in him. “And may I ask your name,\r\nyoung lady?”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia Wetherell--General,” she said smiling.\r\n\r\n“That sounds more natural,” said the President, and then to Ephraim,\r\n“Your daughter?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't think more of her if she was,” answered Ephraim; “Cynthy's\r\npulled me through some tight spells. Her mother was my cousin, General.\r\nMy name's Prescott--Ephraim Prescott.”\r\n\r\n“Ephraim Prescott!” ejaculated the President, sharply, taking his cigar\r\nfrom his mouth, “Ephraim Prescott!”\r\n\r\n“Prescott--that's right--Prescott, General,” repeated Ephraim, sorely\r\npuzzled by these manifestations of amazement.\r\n\r\n“What did you come to Washington for?” asked the President.\r\n\r\n“Well, General, I kind of hate to tell you--I didn't intend to mention\r\nthat. I guess I won't say nothin' about it,” he added, “we've had such\r\na sociable time. I've always b'en a little mite ashamed of it, General,\r\never since 'twas first mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said the President again, and then he looked at Cynthia.\r\n“What is it, Miss Cynthia?” he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was now Cynthia's turn to be a little confused.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro--that is, Mr. Bass” (the President nodded), “went to\r\nCousin Eph when he couldn't make harness any more and said he'd give him\r\nthe Brampton post-office.”\r\n\r\nThe President's eyes met the senator's, and both gentlemen laughed.\r\nCynthia bit her lip, not seeing any cause for mirth in her remark, while\r\nEphraim looked uncomfortable and mopped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n“He said he'd give it to him, did he?” said the President. “Is Mr. Bass\r\nyour uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, General,” replied Cynthia, “he's really no relation. He's done\r\neverything for me, and I live with him since my father died. He was\r\ngoing to meet us here,” she continued, looking around hurriedly, “I'm\r\nsure I can't think what's kept him.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, we are half an hour late already,” said the senator,\r\nhurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said the President, “I suppose I must go. Good-by, Miss\r\nCynthia,” said he, taking the girl's hand warmly. “Good-by, Comrade. If\r\never you want to see General Grant, just send in your name. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nThe President lifted his hat politely to Cynthia and passed. He said\r\nsomething to the senator which they did not hear, and the senator\r\nlaughed heartily. Ephraim and Cynthia watched them until they were out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\n“Godfrey!” exclaimed Ephraim, “they told me he was hard to talk to. Why,\r\nCynthy, he's as simple as a child.”\r\n\r\n“I've always thought that all great men must be simple,” said Cynthia;\r\n“Uncle Jethro is.”\r\n\r\n“To think that the President of the United States stood talkin' to us on\r\nthe sidewalk for half an hour,” said Ephraim, clutching Cynthia's arm.\r\n“Cynthy, I'm glad we didn't press that post-office matter it was worth\r\nmore to me than all the post-offices in the Union to have that talk with\r\nGeneral Grant.”\r\n\r\nThey waited some time longer under the tree, happy in the afterglow of\r\nthis wonderful experience. Presently a clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\n“Why, it's dinner-time, Cynthy,” said Ephraim. “I guess Jethro haint'\r\na-comin'--must hev b'en delayed by some of them politicians.”\r\n\r\n“It's the first time I ever knew him to miss an appointment,” said\r\nCynthia, as they walked back to the hotel.\r\n\r\nJethro was not in the corridor, so they passed on to the dining room and\r\nlooked eagerly from group to group. Jethro was not there, either, but\r\nCynthia heard some one laughing above the chatter of the guests,\r\nand drew back into the corridor. She had spied the Duncans and the\r\nWorthingtons making merry by themselves at a corner table, and it was\r\nSomers's laugh that she heard. Bob, too, sitting next to Miss Duncan,\r\nwas much amused about something. Suddenly Cynthia's exaltation over the\r\nincident of the morning seemed to leave her, and Bob Worthington's words\r\nwhich she had pondered over in the night came back to her with renewed\r\nforce. He did not find it necessary to steal away to see Miss Duncan.\r\nWhy should he have “stolen away” to see her? Was it because she was a\r\ncountry girl, and poor? That was true; but on the other hand, did she\r\nnot live in the sunlight, as it were, of Uncle Jethro's greatness, and\r\nwas it not an honor to come to his house and see any one? And why had\r\nMr. Worthington turned hid back on Jethro, and sent for Bob when he\r\nwas talking to them? Cynthia could not understand these things, and her\r\npride was sorely wounded by them.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps Jethro's in his room,” suggested Ephraim.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed they found him there seated on the bed, poring over some\r\nnewspapers, and both in a breath demanded where he had been. Ephraim did\r\nnot wait for an answer.\r\n\r\n“We seen General Grant, Jethro,” he cried; “while we was waitin' for\r\nyou under the tree he come up and stood talkin' to us half an hour. Full\r\nhalf an hour, wahn't it, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” answered Cynthia, forgetting her own grievance at the\r\nrecollection; “only it didn't seem nearly that long.”\r\n\r\n“W-want to know!” exclaimed Jethro, in astonishment, putting down his\r\npaper. “H-how did it happen?”\r\n\r\n“Come right up and spoke to us,” said Ephraim, in a tone he might have\r\nused to describe a miracle, “jest as if he was common folk. Never had\r\na more sociable talk with anybody. Why, there was times when I clean\r\nforgot he was President of the United States. The boys won't believe it\r\nwhen we git back at Coniston.”\r\n\r\nAnd Ephraim, full of his subject, began to recount from the beginning\r\nthe marvellous affair, occasionally appealing to Cynthia for\r\nconfirmation. How he had lived over again the Wilderness and Five Forks;\r\nhow the General had changed since he had seen him whittling under a\r\ntree; how the General had asked about his pension.\r\n\r\n“D-didn't mention the post-office, did you, Ephraim?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no,” replied Ephraim, “I didn't like to exactly. You see, we was\r\nhavin' such a good time I didn't want to spoil it, but Cynthy--”\r\n\r\n“I told the President about it, Uncle Jethro; I told him how sick Cousin\r\nEph had been, and that you were going to give him the postmastership\r\nbecause he couldn't work any more with his hands.”\r\n\r\nThe training of a lifetime had schooled Jethro not to betray surprise.\r\n\r\n“K-kind of mixin' up in politics, hain't you, Cynthy? P-President say\r\nhe'd give you the postmastership, Eph?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He didn't say nothin' about it, Jethro,” answered Ephraim slowly; “I\r\ncallate he has other views for the place, and he was too kind to come\r\nright out with 'em and spoil our mornin'. You see, Jethro, I wahn't only\r\na sergeant, and Brampton's gittin' to be a big town.”\r\n\r\n“But, surely,” cried Cynthia, who could scarcely wait for him to finish,\r\n“surely you're going to give Cousin Eph the post-office, aren't you,\r\nUncle Jethro? All you have to do is to tell the President that you want\r\nit for him. Why, I had an idea that we came down for that.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Cynthy,” Ephraim put in, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n“Who else would get the post-office?” asked Cynthia. “Surely you're not\r\ngoing to let Mr. Sutton have it for Dave Wheelock!”\r\n\r\n“Er--Cynthy,” said Jethro, slyly, “w-what'd you say to me once about\r\ninterferin' with women's fixin's?”\r\n\r\nCynthia saw the point. She perceived also that the mazes of politics\r\nwere not to be understood by a young woman, of even by an old soldier.\r\nShe laughed and seized Jethro's hands and pulled him from the bed.\r\n\r\n“We won't get any dinner unless we hurry,” she said.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the dining room she was relieved to discover that the\r\nparty in the corner had gone.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon there were many more sights to be viewed, but they were\r\nback in the hotel again by half-past four, because Ephraim's Wilderness\r\nleg had its limits of endurance. Jethro (though he had not mentioned the\r\nfact to them) had gone to the White House.\r\n\r\nIt was during the slack hours that our friend the senator, whose\r\ninterest in the matter of the Brampton post office out-weighed for the\r\npresent certain grave problems of the Administration in which he was\r\ninvolved, hurried into the Willard Hotel, looking for Jethro Bass. He\r\nfound him without much trouble in his usual attitude, occupying one of\r\nthe chairs in the corridor.\r\n\r\n“Well,” exclaimed the senator, with a touch of eagerness he did not\r\noften betray, “did you see Grant? How about your old soldier? He's one\r\nof the most delightful characters I ever met--simple as a child,” and\r\nhe laughed at the recollection. “That was a masterstroke of yours, Bass,\r\nputting him under that tree with that pretty girl. I doubt if you ever\r\ndid anything better in your life. Did they tell you about it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jethro, “they told me about it.”\r\n\r\n“And how about Grant? What did he say to you?”\r\n\r\n“W-well, I went up there and sent in my card. D-didn't have to wait a\r\ngreat while, as I was pretty early, and soon he came in, smokin' a black\r\ncigar, head bent forward a little. D-didn't ask me to sit down, and what\r\ntalkin' we did we did standin'. D-didn't ask me what he could do for\r\nme, what I wanted, or anything else, but just stood there, and I stood\r\nthere. F-fust time in my life I didn't know how to commerce or what to\r\nsay; looked--looked at me--didn't take his eye off me. After a while I\r\ngot started, somehow; told him I was there to ask him to appoint Ephraim\r\nPrescott to the Brampton postoffice--t-told him all about Ephraim from\r\nthe time he was locked in the cradle--never was so hard put that I\r\ncould remember. T-told him how Ephraim shook butternuts off my\r\nfathers tree--for all I know. T-told him all about Ephraim's war\r\nrecord--leastways all I could call to mind--and, by Godfrey! before\r\nI got through, I wished I'd listened to more of it. T-told him\r\nabout Ephraim's Wilderness bullets--t-told him about Ephraim's\r\nrheumatism,--how it bothered him when he went to bed and when he got up\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nIf Jethro had glanced at his companion, he would have seen the senator\r\nwas shaking with silent and convulsive laughter.\r\n\r\n“All the time I talked to him I didn't see a muscle move in his face,”\r\n Jethro continued, “so I started in again, and he looked--looked--looked\r\nright at me. W-wouldn't wink--don't think he winked once while I was in\r\nthat room. I watched him as close as I could, and I watched to see if a\r\nmuscle moved or if I was makin' any impression. All he would do was to\r\nstand there and look--look--look. K-kept me there ten minutes and never\r\nopened his mouth at all. Hardest man to talk to I ever met--never see a\r\nman before but what I could get him to say somethin', if it was only a\r\ncuss word. I got tired of it after a while, made up my mind that I had\r\nfound one man I couldn't move. Then what bothered me was to get out of\r\nthat room. If I'd a had a Bible I believe I'd a read it to him. I didn't\r\nknow what to say, but I did say this after a while:--“'W-well, Mr.\r\nPresident, I guess I've kept you long enough--g-guess you're a pretty\r\nbusy man. H-hope you'll give Mr. Prescott that postmastership. Er--er\r\ngood-by.'\r\n\r\n“'Wait, sir,' he said.\r\n\r\n“'Yes,' I said, 'I-I'll wait.'\r\n\r\n“Thought you was goin' to give him that postmastership, Mr. Bass,' he\r\nsaid.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the senator could not control his mirth, and the empty\r\ncorridor echoed his laughter.\r\n\r\n“By thunder! what did you say to that?”\r\n\r\n“Er--I said, 'Mr. President, I thought I was until a while ago.'\r\n\r\n“'And when did you change your mind?' says he.”\r\n\r\nThen he laughed a little--not much--but he laughed a little.\r\n\r\n“'I understand that your old soldier lives within the limits of the\r\ndelivery of the Brampton office,' said he.”\r\n\r\n“'That's correct, Mr. President,' said I.”\r\n\r\n“'Well,' said he, 'I will app'int him postmaster at Brampton, Mr.\r\nBass.'”\r\n\r\n“'When?' said I.”\r\n\r\nThen he laughed a little more.\r\n\r\n“I'll have the app'intment sent to your hotel this afternoon,' said he.”\r\n\r\n“'Then I said to him, 'This has come out full better than I expected,\r\nMr. President. I'm much obliged to you.' He didn't say nothin' more, so\r\nI come out.”\r\n\r\n“Grant didn't say anything about Worthington or Duncan, did he?” asked\r\nthe senator, curiously, as he rose to go.\r\n\r\n“G-guess I've told you all he said,” answered Jethro; “'twahn't a great\r\ndeal.”\r\n\r\nThe senator held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“Bass,” he said, laughing, “I believe you came pretty near meeting your\r\nmatch. But if Grant's the hardest man in the Union to get anything out\r\nof, I've a notion who's the second.” And with this parting shot the\r\nsenator took his departure, chuckling to himself as he went.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, there were but few visitors in Washington at\r\nthis time, and the hotel corridor was all but empty. Presently a\r\nsubstantial-looking gentleman came briskly in from the street, nodding\r\naffably to the colored porters and bell-boys, who greeted him by name.\r\nHe wore a flowing Prince Albert coat, which served to dignify a growing\r\nportliness, and his coal-black whiskers glistened in the light. A voice,\r\nwhich appeared to come from nowhere in particular, brought the gentleman\r\nup standing.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Heth?”\r\n\r\nIt may not be that Mr. Sutton's hand trembled, but the ashes of his\r\ncigar fell to the floor. He was not used to visitations, and for the\r\ninstant, if the truth be told, he was not equal to looking around.\r\n\r\n“Like Washington, Heth--like Washington?”\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Sutton turned. His presence of mind, and that other presence of\r\nwhich he was so proud, seemed for the moment to have deserted him.\r\n\r\n“S-stick pretty close to business, Heth, comin' down here out of session\r\ntime. S-stick pretty close to business, don't you, since the people sent\r\nyou to Congress?”\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton might have offered another man a cigar or a drink, but (as is\r\nwell known) Jethro was proof against tobacco or stimulants.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Honorable Heth, catching his breath and making a dive,\r\n“I am surprised to see you, Jethro,” which was probably true.\r\n\r\n“Th-thought you might be,” said Jethro. “Er--glad to see me, Heth--glad\r\nto see me?”\r\n\r\nAs has been recorded, it is peculiarly difficult to lie to people who\r\nare not to be deceived.\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly I am,” answered the Honorable Heth, swallowing hard,\r\n“certainly I am, Jethro. I meant to have got to Coniston this summer,\r\nbut I was so busy--”\r\n\r\n“Peoples' business, I understand. Er--hear you've gone in for\r\nhigh-minded politics, Heth--r-read a highminded speech of yours--two\r\nhigh-minded speeches. Always thought you was a high-minded man, Heth.”\r\n\r\n“How did you like those speeches, Jethro?” asked Mr. Sutton, striving as\r\nbest he might to make some show of dignity.\r\n\r\n“Th-thought they was high-minded,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThen there was a silence, for Mr. Sutton could think of nothing more to\r\nsay. And he yearned to depart with a great yearning, but something held\r\nhim there.\r\n\r\n“Heth,” said Jethro after a while, “you was always very friendly and\r\nobliging. You've done a great many favors for me in your life.”\r\n\r\n“I've always tried to be neighborly, Jethro,” said Mr. Sutton, but his\r\nvoice sounded a little husky even to himself.\r\n\r\n“And I may have done one or two little things for you, Heth,” Jethro\r\ncontinued, “but I can't remember exactly. Er--can you remember, Heth.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton was trying with becoming nonchalance to light the stump of\r\nhis cigar. He did not succeed this time. He pulled himself together with\r\na supreme effort.\r\n\r\n“I think we've both been mutually helpful, Jethro,” he said, “mutually\r\nhelpful.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jethro, reflectively, “I don't know as I could have put it\r\nas well as that--there's somethin' in being an orator.”\r\n\r\nThere was another silence, a much longer one. The Honorable Heth threw\r\nhis butt away, and lighted another cigar. Suddenly, as if by magic,\r\nhis aplomb returned, and in a flash of understanding he perceived the\r\nsituation. He saw himself once more as the successful congressman,\r\nthe trusted friend of the railroad interests, and he saw Jethro as a\r\ndiscredited boss. He did not stop to reflect that Jethro did not act\r\nlike a discredited boss, as a keener man might have done. But if the\r\nHonorable Heth had been a keener man, he would not have been at that\r\ntime a congressman. Mr. Sutton accused himself of having been stupid in\r\nnot grasping at once that the tables were turned, and that now he was\r\nthe one to dispense the gifts.\r\n\r\n“K-kind of fortunate you stopped to speak to me, Heth. N-now I come to\r\nthink of it, I hev a little favor to ask of you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Sutton, blowing out the smoke; “of course anything I\r\ncan do, Jethro--anything in reason.”\r\n\r\n“W-wouldn't ask a high-minded man to do anything he hadn't ought to,”\r\n said Jethro; “the fact is, I'd like to git Eph Prescott appointed at\r\nthe Brampton post-office. You can fix that, Heth--can't you--you can fix\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton stuck his thumb into his vest pocket and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“I can't tell you how sorry I am not to oblige you, Jethro, but I've\r\narranged to give that post-office to Dave Wheelock.”\r\n\r\n“A-arranged it, hev You--a-arranged it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said Mr. Sutton, scarcely believing his own ears. Could it\r\nbe possible that he was using this patronizingly kind tone to Jethro\r\nBass?\r\n\r\n“Well, that's too bad,” said Jethro; “g-got it all fixed, hev you?”\r\n\r\n“Practically,” answered Mr. Sutton, grandly; “indeed, I may go as far\r\nas to say that it is as certain as if I had the appointment here in my\r\npocket. I'm sorry not to oblige you, Jethro; but these are matters which\r\na member of Congress must look after pretty closely.” He held out his\r\nhand, but Jethro did not appear to see it,--he had his in his pockets.\r\n“I've an important engagement,” said the Honorable Heth, consulting a\r\nlarge gold watch. “Are you going to be in Washington long?”\r\n\r\n“G-guess I've about got through, Heth--g-guess I've about got through,”\r\n said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you have time and there's any other little thing, I'm in Room\r\n29,” said Mr. Sutton, as he put his foot on the stairway.\r\n\r\n“T-told Worthington you got that app'intment for Wheelock--t-told\r\nWorthington?” Jethro called out after him.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton turned and waved his cigar and smiled in acknowledgment of\r\nthis parting bit of satire. He felt that he could afford to smile. A\r\nfew minutes later he was ensconced on the sofa of a private sitting room\r\nreviewing the incident, with much gusto, for the benefit of Mr. Isaac\r\nD. Worthington and Mr. Alexander Duncan. Both of these gentlemen laughed\r\nheartily, for the Honorable Heth Sutton knew the art of telling a story\r\nwell, at least, and was often to be seen with a group around him in the\r\nlobbies of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock that afternoon Ephraim was sitting in his\r\nshirt-sleeves by the window of his room, and Cynthia was reading aloud\r\nto him an article (about the war, of course) from a Washington paper,\r\nwhich his friend, Mr. Beard, had sent him. There was a knock at the\r\ndoor, and Cynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n“Mistah Ephum Prescott?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Ephraim, “that's me.”\r\n\r\nCynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as\r\nthough he were afraid of its contents.\r\n\r\n“Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cousin Eph,” exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, “why don't you open it?\r\nIf you don't I will.”\r\n\r\n“Guess you'd better, Cynthy,” and he held it out to her with a trembling\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nCynthia did open it, and drew out a large document with seals and\r\nprinting and signatures.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Eph,” she cried, holding it under his nose, “Cousin Eph, you're\r\npostmaster of Brampton!”\r\n\r\nEphraim looked at the paper, but his eyes swam, and he could only make\r\nout a dancing, bronze seal.\r\n\r\n“I want to know!” he exclaimed. “Fetch Jethro.”\r\n\r\nBut Cynthia had already flown on that errand. Curiously enough, she ran\r\ninto Jethro in the hall immediately outside of Ephraim's door. Ephraim\r\ngot to his feet; it was very difficult for him to realize that his\r\ntroubles were ended, that he was to earn his living at last. He looked\r\nat Jethro, and his eyes filled with tears. “I guess I can't thank you as\r\nI'd ought to, Jethro,” he said, “leastways, not now.”\r\n\r\n“I'll thank him for you, Cousin Eph,” said Cynthia. And she did.\r\n\r\n“D-don't thank me,” said Jethro, “I didn't have much to do with it, Eph.\r\nThank the President.”\r\n\r\nEphraim did thank the President, in one of the most remarkable letters,\r\nfrom a literary point of view, ever received at the White House. For the\r\nart of literature largely consists in belief in what one is writing, and\r\nEphraim's letter had this quality of sincerity, and no lack of vividness\r\nas well. He spent most of the evening in composing it.\r\n\r\nCynthia, too, had received a letter that day--a letter which she had\r\nread several times, now with a smile, and again with a pucker of the\r\nforehead which was meant for a frown. “Dear Cynthia,” it said. “Where do\r\nyou keep yourself? I am sure you would not be so cruel if you knew\r\nthat I was aching to see you.” Aching! Cynthia repeated the word, and\r\nremembered the glimpse she had had of him in the dining room with Miss\r\nJanet Duncan. “Whenever I have been free” (Cynthia repeated this also,\r\nsomewhat ironically, although she conceded it the merit of frankness),\r\n“Whenever I have been free, I have haunted the corridors for a sight\r\nof you. Think of me as haunting the hotel desk for an answer to this,\r\ntelling me when I can see you--and where. P.S. I shall be around all\r\nevening.” And it was signed, “Your friend and playmate, R. Worthington.”\r\n\r\nIt is a fact--not generally known--that Cynthia did answer the\r\nletter--twice. But she sent neither answer. Even at that age she was\r\ngiven to reflection, and much as she may have approved of the spirit of\r\nthe letter, she liked the tone of it less. Cynthia did not know a great\r\ndeal of the world, it is true, but the felt instinctively that something\r\nwas wrong when Bob resorted to such means of communication. And she\r\nwas positively relieved, or thought that she was, when she went down to\r\nsupper and discovered that the table in the corner was empty.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Ephraim had his letter to write, and Jethro wished to sit\r\nin the corridor. But Cynthia had learned that the corridor was not the\r\nplace for a girl, so she explained--to Jethro that he would find her in\r\nthe parlor if he wanted her, and that she was going there to read. That\r\nparlor Cynthia thought a handsome room, with its high windows and lace\r\ncurtains, its long mirrors and marble-topped tables. She established\r\nherself under a light, on a sofa in one corner, and sat, with the book\r\non her lap watching the people who came and went. She had that delicious\r\nsensation which comes to the young when they first travel--the sensation\r\nof being a part of the great world; and she wished that she knew these\r\npeople, and which were the great, and which the little ones. Some of\r\nthem looked at her intently, she thought too intently, and at such\r\ntimes she pretended to read. She was aroused by hearing some one\r\nsaying:--“Isn't this Miss Wetherell?”\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up and caught her breath, for the young lady who\r\nhad spoken was none other than Miss Janet Duncan herself. Seen thus\r\nstartlingly at close range, Miss Duncan was not at all like what Cynthia\r\nhad expected--but then most people are not. Janet Duncan was, in fact,\r\none of those strange persons who do not realize the picture which their\r\nnames summon up. She was undoubtedly good-looking; her hair, of a\r\nmore golden red than her brother's, was really wonderful; her neck was\r\nslender; and she had a strange, dreamy face that fascinated Cynthia, who\r\nhad never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nShe put down her book on the sofa and got up, not without a little\r\ntremor at this unexpected encounter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I'm Cynthia Wetherell,” she replied.\r\n\r\nTo add to her embarrassment, Miss Duncan seized both her hands\r\nimpulsively and gazed into her face.\r\n\r\n“You're really very beautiful,” she said. “Do you know it?”\r\n\r\nCynthia's only answer to this was a blush. She wondered if all city\r\ngirls were like Miss Duncan.\r\n\r\n“I was determined to come up and speak to you the first chance I had,”\r\n Janet continued. “I've been making up stories about you.”\r\n\r\n“Stories!” exclaimed Cynthia, drawing away her hands.\r\n\r\n“Romances,” said Miss Duncan--“real romances. Sometimes I think I'm\r\ngoing to be a novelist, because I'm always weaving stories about people\r\nthat I see people who interest me, I mean. And you look as if you might\r\nbe the heroine of a wonderful romance.”\r\n\r\nCynthia's breath was now quite taken away.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “I--had never thought that I looked like that.”\r\n\r\n“But you do,” said Miss Duncan; “you've got all sorts of possibilities\r\nin your face--you look as if you might have lived for ages.”\r\n\r\n“As old as that?” exclaimed Cynthia, really startled.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I don't express myself very well” said the other, hastily; “I\r\nwish you could see what I've written about you already. I can do it so\r\nmuch better with pen and ink. I've started quite a romance already.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Cynthia, not without interest.\r\n\r\n“Sit down on the sofa and I'll tell you,” said Miss Duncan; “I've done\r\nit all from your face, too. I've made you a very poor girl brought up by\r\npeasants, only you are really of a great family, although nobody knows\r\nit. A rich duke sees you one day when he is hunting and falls in love\r\nwith you, and you have to stand a lot of suffering and persecution\r\nbecause of it, and say nothing. I believe you could do that,” added\r\nJanet, looking critically at Cynthia's face.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I could if I had to,” said Cynthia, “but I shouldn't like\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it would do you good,” said Janet; “it would ennoble your\r\ncharacter. Not that it needs it,” she added hastily. “And I could write\r\nanother story about that quaint old man who paid the musicians to go\r\naway, and who made us all laugh so much.”\r\n\r\nCynthia's eye kindled.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass isn't a quaint old man,” she said; “he's the greatest man in\r\nthe state.”\r\n\r\nMiss Duncan's patronage had been of an unconscious kind. She knew that\r\nshe had offended, but did not quite realize how.\r\n\r\n“I'm so sorry,” she cried, “I didn't mean to hurt you. You live with\r\nhim, don't you--Coniston?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Cynthia, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\r\n\r\n“I've heard about Coniston. It must be quite a romance in itself to\r\nlive all the year round in such a beautiful place and to make your own\r\nclothes. Yours become you very well,” said Miss Duncan, “although I\r\ndon't know why. They're not at all in style, and yet they give you\r\nquite an air of distinction. I wish I could live in Coniston for a year,\r\nanyway, and write a book about you. My brother and Bob Worthington went\r\nout there one night and serenaded you, didn't they?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia, that peculiar flash coming into her eyes again,\r\n“and I think it was very foolish of them.”\r\n\r\n“Do you?” exclaimed Miss Duncan, in surprise; “I wish somebody would\r\nserenade me. I think it was the most romantic thing Bob ever did.\r\nHe's wild about you, and so is Somers they have both told me so in\r\nconfidence.”\r\n\r\nCynthia's face was naturally burning now.\r\n\r\n“If it were true,” she said, “they wouldn't have told you about it.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that's so,” said Miss Duncan, thoughtfully, “only you're\r\nvery clever to have seen it. Now that I know you, I think you a more\r\nremarkable person than ever. You don't seem at all like a country girl,\r\nand you don't talk like one.”\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright. She could not help liking Janet Duncan, mere\r\nflesh and blood not being proof against such compliments.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it's because my father was an educated man,” she said; “he\r\ntaught me to read and speak when I was young.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you are just like a person out of a novel! Who was your father?”\r\n\r\n“He kept the store at Coniston,” answered Cynthia, smiling a little\r\nsadly. She would have liked to have added that William Wetherell would\r\nhave been a great man if he had had health, but she found it difficult\r\nto give out confidences, especially when they were in the nature of\r\nsurmises.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Janet, stoutly, “I think that is more like a story than\r\never. Do you know,” she continued, “I saw you once at the state capital\r\noutside of our grounds the day Bob ran after you. That was when I was in\r\nlove with him. We had just come back from Europe then, and I thought he\r\nwas the most wonderful person I had ever seen.”\r\n\r\nIf Cynthia had felt any emotion from this disclosure, she did not betray\r\nit. Janet, moreover, was not looking for it.\r\n\r\n“What made you change your mind?” asked Cynthia, biting her lip.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bob hasn't the temperament,” said Janet, making use of a word that\r\nshe had just discovered; “he's too practical--he never does or says the\r\nthings you want him to. He's just been out West with us on a trip, and\r\nhe was always looking at locomotives and brakes and grades and bridges\r\nand all such tiresome things. I should like to marry a poet,” said Miss\r\nDuncan, dreamily; “I know they want me to marry Bob, and Mr. Worthington\r\nwants it. I'm sure, of that. But he wouldn't at all suit me.”\r\n\r\nIf Cynthia had been able to exercise an equal freedom of speech, she\r\nmight have been impelled to inquire what young Mr. Worthington's views\r\nwere in the matter. As it was, she could think of nothing appropriate to\r\nsay, and just then four people entered the room and came towards them.\r\nTwo of these were Janet's mother and father, and the other two were Mr.\r\nWorthington, the elder, and the Honorable Heth Sutton. Mrs. Duncan,\r\nwhom Janet did not at all resemble was a person who naturally commanded\r\nattention. She had strong features, and a very decided, though not\r\ndisagreeable, manner.\r\n\r\n“I couldn't imagine what had become of you, Janet,” she said, coming\r\nforward and throwing off her lace shawl. “Whom have you found--a school\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mamma,” said Janet, “this is Cynthia Wetherell.” “Oh,” said Mrs.\r\nDuncan, looking very hard at Cynthia in a near-sighted way, and, not\r\nknowing in the least who she was; “you haven't seen Senator and Mrs.\r\nMeade, have you, Janet? They were to be here at eight o'clock.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Janet, turning again to Cynthia and scarcely hearing the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Janet hasn't seen them, Dudley,” said Mrs. Duncan, going up to Mr.\r\nWorthington, who was pulling his chop whiskers by the door. “Janet has\r\ndiscovered such a beautiful creature,” she went on, in a voice which she\r\ndid not take the trouble to lower. “Do look at her, Alexander. And you,\r\nMr. Sutton--who are such a bureau of useful information, do tell me\r\nwho she is. Perhaps she comes from your part of the country--her name's\r\nWetherell.”\r\n\r\n“Wetherell? Why, of course I know her,” said Mr. Sutton, who was greatly\r\npleased because Mrs. Duncan had likened him to an almanac: greatly\r\npleased this evening in every respect, and even the diamond in his bosom\r\nseemed to glow with a brighter fire. He could afford to be generous\r\nto-night, and he turned to Mr. Worthington and laughed knowingly. “She's\r\nthe ward of our friend Jethro,” he explained.\r\n\r\n“What is she?” demanded Mrs. Duncan, who knew and cared nothing about\r\npolitics, “a country girl, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Mr. Sutton, “a country girl from a little village not\r\nfar from Clovelly. A good girl, I believe, in spite of the atmosphere in\r\nwhich she has been raised.”\r\n\r\n“It's really wonderful, Mr. Sutton, how you seem to know every one in\r\nyour district, including the women and children,” said the lady; “but I\r\nsuppose you wouldn't be where you are if you didn't.”\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Heth cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“Wetherell,” Mr. Duncan was saying, staring at Cynthia through his\r\nspectacles, “where have I heard that name?”\r\n\r\nHe must suddenly have remembered, and recalled also that he and his ally\r\nWorthington had been on opposite sides in the Woodchuck Session, for he\r\nsat down abruptly beside the door, and remained there for a while. For\r\nMr. Duncan had never believed Mr. Merrill's explanation concerning poor\r\nWilliam Wetherell' s conduct.\r\n\r\n“Pretty, ain't she?” said Mr. Sutton to Mr. Worthington. “Guess she's\r\nmore dangerous than Jethro, now that we've clipped his wings a little.”\r\n The congressman had heard of Bob's infatuation.\r\n\r\nIsaac D. Worthington, however, was in a good humor this evening and was\r\nmoved by a certain curiosity to inspect the girl. Though what he had\r\nseen and heard of his son's conduct with her had annoyed him, he did not\r\nregard it seriously.\r\n\r\n“Aren't you going to speak to your constituent, Mr. Sutton?” said\r\nMrs. Duncan, who was bored because her friends had not arrived; “a\r\ncongressman ought to keep on the right side of the pretty girls, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nIt hadn't occurred to the Honorable Heth to speak to his constituent.\r\nThe ways of Mrs. Duncan sometimes puzzled him, and he could not see why\r\nthat lady and her daughter seemed to take more than a passing interest\r\nin the girl. But if they could afford to notice her, certainly he\r\ncould; so he went forward graciously and held out his hand to Cynthia;\r\ninterrupting Miss Duncan in the middle of a discourse upon her diary.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Cynthia?” said Mr. Sutton. Had he been in Coniston, he\r\nwould have said, “How be you?”\r\n\r\nCynthia took the hand, but did not rise, somewhat to Mr. Sutton's\r\nannoyance. A certain respect was due to a member of Congress and the\r\nRajah of Clovelly.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Sutton?” said Cynthia, very coolly.\r\n\r\n“I like her,” remarked Mrs. Duncan to Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“This is a splendid trip for you, eh, Cynthia?” Mr. Sutton persisted,\r\nwith a praiseworthy determination to be pleasant.\r\n\r\n“It has turned out to be so, Mr. Sutton,” replied Cynthia. This was\r\nnot precisely the answer Mr. Sutton expected, and to tell the truth, he\r\ndidn't know quite what to make of it.\r\n\r\n“A great treat to see Washington and New York, isn't it?” said Mr.\r\nSutton, kindly, “a great treat for a Coniston girl. I suppose you came\r\nthrough New York and saw the sights?”\r\n\r\n“Is there another way to get to Washington?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncan nudged Mr. Worthington and drew a little nearer, while\r\nMr. Sutton began to wish he had not been lured into the conversation.\r\nCynthia had been very polite, but there was something in the quiet\r\nmanner in which the girl's eyes were fixed upon him that made him\r\nvaguely uneasy. He could not back out with dignity, and he felt himself\r\non the verge of becoming voluble. Mr. Sutton prided himself on never\r\nbeing voluble.\r\n\r\n“Why, no,” he answered, “we have to go to New York to get anywhere in\r\nthese days.” There was a slight pause. “Uncle Jethro taking you and\r\nMr. Prescott on a little pleasure trip?” He had not meant to mention\r\nJethro's name, but he found himself, to his surprise, a little at a loss\r\nfor a subject.\r\n\r\n“Well, partly a pleasure trip. It's always a pleasure for Uncle Jethro\r\nto do things for others,” said Cynthia, quietly, “although people do not\r\nalways appreciate what he does for them.”\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Heth coughed. He was now very uncomfortable, indeed.\r\nHow much did this astounding young person know, whom he had thought so\r\ninnocent?\r\n\r\n“I didn't discover he was in town until I ran across him in the corridor\r\nthis evening. Should have liked to have introduced him to some of the\r\nWashington folks--some of the big men, although not many of 'em are\r\nhere,” Mr. Sutton ran on, not caring to notice the little points of\r\nlight in Cynthia's eyes. (The idea of Mr. Sutton introducing Uncle\r\nJethro to anybody!) “I haven't seen Ephraim Prescott. It must be a\r\ngreat treat for him, too, to get away on a little trip and see his army\r\nfriends. How is he?”\r\n\r\n“He's very happy,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Happy!” exclaimed Mr. Sutton. “Oh, yes, of course, Ephraim's always\r\nhappy, in spite of his troubles and his rheumatism. I always liked\r\nEphraim Prescott.”\r\n\r\nCynthia did not answer this remark at all, and Mr. Sutton suspected\r\nstrongly that she did not believe it, therefore he repeated it.\r\n\r\n“I always liked Ephraim. I want you to tell Jethro that I'm downright\r\nsorry I couldn't get him that Brampton postmastership.”\r\n\r\n“I'll tell him that you are sorry, Mr. Sutton,” replied Cynthia,\r\ngravely, “but I don't think it'll do any good.”\r\n\r\nNot do any good!--What did the girl mean? Mr. Sutton came to the\r\nconclusion that he had been condescending enough, that somehow he\r\nwas gaining no merit in Mrs. Duncan's eyes by this kindness to a\r\nconstituent. He buttoned up his coat rather grandly.\r\n\r\n“I hope you won't misunderstand me, Cynthia,” he said. “I regret\r\nextremely that my sense of justice demanded that I should make David\r\nWheelock postmaster at Brampton, and I have made him so.”\r\n\r\nIt was now Cynthia's turn to be amazed.\r\n\r\n“But,” she exclaimed, “but Cousin Ephraim is postmaster of Brampton.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton started violently, and that part of his face not hidden\r\nby his whiskers seemed to pale, and Mr. Worthington, usually\r\nself-possessed, took a step forward and seized him by the arm.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean, Sutton?” he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton pulled himself together, and glared at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“I think you are mistaken,” said he, “the congressman of the district\r\nusually arranges these matters, and the appointment will be sent to Mr.\r\nWheelock to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“But Cousin Ephraim already has the appointment,” said Cynthia; “it\r\nwas sent to him this afternoon, and he is up in his room now writing to\r\nthank the President for it.”\r\n\r\n“What in the world's the matter?” cried Mrs. Duncan, in astonishment.\r\n\r\nCynthia's simple announcement had indeed caused something of a panic\r\namong the gentlemen present. Mr. Duncan had jumped up from his seat\r\nbeside the door, and Mr. Worthington, his face anything but impassive,\r\ntightened his hold on the congressman's arm.\r\n\r\n“Good God, Sutton!” he exclaimed, “can this be true?”\r\n\r\nAs for Cynthia, she was no less astonished than Mrs. Duncan by the fact\r\nthat these rich and powerful gentlemen were so excited over a little\r\nthing like the postmastership of Brampton. But Mr. Sutton laughed; it\r\nwas not hearty, but still it might have passed muster for a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” he exclaimed, making a fair attempt to regain his composure,\r\n“the girl's got it mixed up with something else--she doesn't know what\r\nshe's talking about.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncan thought the girl did look uncommonly as if she knew what\r\nshe was talking about, and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington had some such\r\nimpression, too, as they stared at her. Cynthia's eyes flashed, but her\r\nvoice was no louder than before.\r\n\r\n“I am used to being believed, Mr. Sutton,” she said, “but here's Uncle\r\nJethro himself. You might ask him.”\r\n\r\nThey all turned in amazement, and one, at least, in trepidation, to\r\nperceive Jethro Bass standing behind them with his hands in his pockets,\r\nas unconcerned as though he were under the butternut tree in Coniston.\r\n\r\n“How be you, Heth?” he said. “Er--still got that appointment\r\np-practically in your pocket?”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” said Cynthia, “Mr. Sutton does not believe me when I\r\ntell him that Cousin Ephraim has been made postmaster of Brampton. He\r\nwould like to have you tell him whether it is so or not.”\r\n\r\nBut this, as it happened, was exactly what the Honorable Heth did\r\nnot want to have Jethro tell him. How he got out of the parlor of the\r\nWillard House he has not to this day a very clear idea. As a matter of\r\nfact, he followed Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan, and they made their\r\nexit by the farther door. Jethro did not appear to take any notice of\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\n“Janet,” said Mrs. Duncan, “I think Senator and Mrs. Meade must have\r\ngone to our sitting room.” Then, to Cynthia's surprise, the lady took\r\nher by the hand. “I can't imagine what you've done, my dear,” she\r\nsaid pleasantly, “but I believe that you are capable of taking care of\r\nyourself, and I like you.”\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that Mrs. Duncan was an independent person.\r\nSometimes heiresses are apt to be.\r\n\r\n“And I like you, too,” said Janet, taking both of Cynthia's hands, “and\r\nI hope to see you very, very often.”\r\n\r\nJethro looked after them.\r\n\r\n“Er--the women folks seem to have some sense,” he said. Then he turned\r\nto Cynthia. “B-be'n havin' some fun with Heth, Cynthy?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“I haven't any respect for Mr. Sutton,” said Cynthia, indignantly; “it\r\nserves him right for presuming to think that he could give a post-office\r\nto any one.”\r\n\r\nJethro made no remark concerning this presumption on the part of the\r\ncongressman of the district. Cynthia's indignation against Mr. Sutton\r\nwas very real, and it was some time before she could compose herself\r\nsufficiently to tell Jethro what had happened. His enjoyment as he\r\nlistened may be imagined but presently he forgot this, and became aware\r\nthat something really troubled her.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she asked suddenly, “why do they treat me as they do?”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer at once. This was because of a pain around his\r\nheart--had she known it. He had felt that pain before.\r\n\r\n“H-how do they treat you, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. She had not yet learned to use the word patronize in the\r\nsocial sense, and she was at a loss to describe the attitude of Mrs.\r\nDuncan and her daughter, though her instinct had registered it. She was\r\nat a loss to account for Mr. Worthington's attitude, too. Mr. Sutton's\r\nshe bitterly resented.\r\n\r\n“Are they your enemies?” she demanded.\r\n\r\nJethro was in real distress.\r\n\r\n“If they are,” she continued, “I won't speak to them again. If they\r\ncan't treat me as--as your daughter ought to be treated, I'll turn\r\nmy back on them. I am--I am just like your daughter--am I not, Uncle\r\nJethro?”\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand and seized hers roughly, and his voice was thick\r\nwith suffering.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cynthy,” he said, “you--you're all I've got in the world.”\r\n\r\nShe squeezed his hand in return.\r\n\r\n“I know it, Uncle Jethro,” she cried contritely, “I oughtn't to have\r\ntroubled you by asking. You--you have done everything for me, much more\r\nthan I deserve. And I shan't be hurt after this when people are too\r\nsmall to appreciate how good you are, and how great.”\r\n\r\nThe pain tightened about Jethro's heart--tightened so sharply that he\r\ncould not speak, and scarcely breathe because of it. Cynthia picked up\r\nher novel, and set the bookmark.\r\n\r\n“Now that Cousin Eph is provided for, let's go back to Coniston, Uncle\r\nJethro.” A sudden longing was upon her for the peaceful life in the\r\nshelter of the great ridge, and she thought of the village maples all\r\nred and gold with the magic touch of the frosts. “Not that I haven't\r\nenjoyed my trip,” she added; “but we are so happy there.”\r\n\r\nHe did not look at her, because he was afraid to.\r\n\r\n“C-Cynthy,” he said, after a little pause, “th-thought we'd go to\r\nBoston.”\r\n\r\n“Boston, Uncle Jethro!”\r\n\r\n“Er--to-morrow--at one--to-morrow--like to go to Boston?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said thoughtfully, “I remember parts of it. The Common, where\r\nI used to walk with Daddy, and the funny old streets that went uphill.\r\nIt will be nice to go back to Coniston that way--over Truro Pass in the\r\ntrain.”\r\n\r\nThat night a piece of news flashed over the wires to New England, and\r\nthe next morning a small item appeared in the Newcastle Guardian to\r\nthe effect that one Ephraim Prescott had bean appointed postmaster\r\nat Brampton. Copied in the local papers of the state, it caused some\r\nsurprise in Brampton, to be sure, and excitement in Coniston. Perhaps\r\nthere were but a dozen men, however, who saw its real significance,\r\nwho knew through this item that Jethro Bass was still supreme--that the\r\nrailroads had failed to carry this first position in their war against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was with a light heart the next morning that Cynthia, packed the\r\nlittle leather trunk which had been her father's. Ephraim was in the\r\ncorridor regaling his friend, Mr. Beard, with that wonderful encounter\r\nwith General Grant which sounded so much like a Fifth Reader anecdote\r\nof a chance meeting with royalty. Jethro's room was full of visiting\r\npoliticians. So Cynthia, when she had finished her packing, went out\r\nto walk about the streets alone, scanning the people who passed her,\r\nlooking at the big houses, and wondering who lived in them. Presently\r\nshe found herself, in the middle of the morning, seated on a bench in a\r\nlittle park, surrounded by colored mammies and children playing in the\r\npaths. It seemed a long time since she had left the hills, and this\r\nglimpse of cities had given her many things to think and dream about.\r\nWould she always live in Coniston? Or was her future to be cast among\r\nthose who moved in the world and helped to sway it? Cynthia felt that\r\nshe was to be of these, though she could not reason why, and she told\r\nherself that the feeling was foolish. Perhaps it was that she knew\r\nin the bottom of her heart that she had been given a spirit and\r\nintelligence to cope with a larger life than that of Coniston. With a\r\nsense that such imaginings were vain, she tried to think what the would\r\ndo if she were to become a great lady like Mrs. Duncan.\r\n\r\nShe was aroused from these reflections by a distant glimpse, through\r\nthe trees, of Mr. Robert Worthington. He was standing quite alone on the\r\nedge of the park, his hands in his pockets, staring at the White House.\r\nCynthia half rose, and then sat down and looked at him again. He wore\r\na light gray, loose-fitting suit and a straw hat, and she could not but\r\nacknowledge that there was something stalwart and clean and altogether\r\nappealing in him. She wondered, indeed, why he now failed to appeal to\r\nMiss Duncan, and she began to doubt the sincerity of that young lady's\r\nstatements. Bob certainly was not romantic, but he was a man--or would\r\nbe very soon.\r\n\r\nCynthia sat still, although her impulse was to go away. She scarcely\r\nanalyzed her feeling of wishing to avoid him. It may not be well,\r\nindeed, to analyze them on paper too closely. She had an instinct that\r\nonly pain could come from frequent meetings, and she knew now what but\r\na week ago was a surmise, that he belonged to the world of which she\r\nhad been dreaming--Mrs. Duncan's world. Again, there was that mysterious\r\nbarrier between them of which she had seen so many evidences. And yet\r\nshe sat still on her bench and looked at him.\r\n\r\nPresently he turned, slowly, as if her eyes had compelled his. She sat\r\nstill--it was too late, then. In less than a minute he was standing\r\nbeside her, looking down at her with a smile that had in it a touch of\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Worthington?” said Cynthia, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington!” he cried, “you haven't called me that before. We are\r\nnot children any more,” she said.\r\n\r\n“What difference does that make?”\r\n\r\n“A great deal,” said Cynthia, not caring to define it.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” said Mr. Worthington, sitting down on the beach and facing\r\nher, “do you think you've treated me just right?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do,” she said, “or I should have treated you differently.”\r\n\r\nBob ignored such quibbling.\r\n\r\n“Why did you run away from that baseball game in Brampton? And why\r\ncouldn't you have answered my letter yesterday, if it were only a line?\r\nAnd why have you avoided me here in Washington?”\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to answer for another questions which one cannot\r\nanswer for one's self.\r\n\r\n“I haven't avoided you,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“I've been looking for you all over town this morning,” said Bob, with\r\npardonable exaggeration, “and I believe that idiot Somers has, too.”\r\n\r\n“Then why should you call him an idiot?” Cynthia flashed.\r\n\r\nBob laughed.\r\n\r\n“How you do catch a fellow up!” said he; admiringly. “We both found out\r\nyou'd gone out for a walk alone.”\r\n\r\n“How did you find it out?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bob, hesitating, “we asked the colored doorkeeper.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington,” said Cynthia, with an indignation that made\r\nhim quail, “do you think it right to ask a doorkeeper to spy on my\r\nmovements?”\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry, Cynthia,” he gasped, “I--I didn't think of it that way--and\r\nhe won't tell. Desperate cases require desperate remedies, you know.”\r\n\r\nBut Cynthia was not appeased.\r\n\r\n“If you wanted to see me,” she said, “why didn't you send your card to\r\nmy room, and I would have come to the parlor.”\r\n\r\n“But I did send a note, and waited around all day.”\r\n\r\nHow was she to tell him that it was to the tone of the note she\r\nobjected--to the hint of a clandestine meeting? She turned the light of\r\nher eyes full upon him.\r\n\r\n“Would you have been content to see me in the parlor?” she asked. “Did\r\nyou mean to see me there?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said he; “I would have given my head to see you anywhere,\r\nonly--”\r\n\r\n“Only what?”\r\n\r\n“Duncan might have came in and spoiled it.”\r\n\r\n“Spoiled what?”\r\n\r\nBob fidgeted.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Cynthia,” he said, “you're not stupid--far from it. Of\r\ncourse you know a fellow would rather talk to you alone.”\r\n\r\n“I should have been very glad to have seen Mr. Duncan, too.”\r\n\r\n“You would, would you!” he exclaimed. “I shouldn't have thought that.”\r\n\r\n“Isn't he your friend?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Bob, “and one of the best in the world. Only--I\r\nshouldn't have thought you'd care to talk to him.” And he looked\r\naround for fear the vigilant Mr. Duncan was already in the park and had\r\ndiscovered them. Cynthia smiled, and immediately became grave again.\r\n\r\n“So it was only on Mr. Duncan's account that you didn't ask me to come\r\ndown to the parlor?” she said.\r\n\r\nBob was in a quandary. He was a truthful person, and he had learned\r\nsomething of the world through his three years at Cambridge. He had seen\r\nmany young women, and many kinds of them. But the girl beside him was\r\nsuch a mixture of innocence and astuteness that he was wholly at a loss\r\nhow to deal with her--how to parry her searching questions.\r\n\r\n“Naturally--I wanted to have you all to myself,” he said; “you ought to\r\nknow that.”\r\n\r\nCynthia did not commit herself on this point. She wished to go\r\nmercilessly to the root of the matter, but the notion of what this would\r\nimply prevented her. Bob took advantage of her silence.\r\n\r\n“Everybody who sees you falls a victim, Cynthia,” he went on; “Mrs.\r\nDuncan and Janet lost their hearts. You ought to have heard them\r\npraising you at breakfast.” He paused abruptly, thinking of the rest of\r\nthat conversation, and laughed. Bob seemed fated to commit himself that\r\nday. “I heard the way you handled Heth Sutton,” he said, plunging\r\nin. “I'll bet he felt as if he'd been dropped out of the third-story\r\nwindow,” and Bob laughed again. “I'd have given a thousand dollars to\r\nhave been there. Somers and I went out to supper with a classmate who\r\nlives in Washington, in that house over there,” and he pointed casually\r\nto one of the imposing mansions fronting on the park. “Mrs. Duncan said\r\nshe'd never heard anybody lay it on the way you did. I don't believe you\r\nhalf know what happened, Cynthia. You made a ten-strike.”\r\n\r\n“A ten-strike?” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “you not only laid out Heth, but my father and Mr.\r\nDuncan, too. Mrs. Duncan laughed at 'em--she isn't afraid of anything.\r\nBut they didn't say a word all through breakfast. I've never seen my\r\nfather so mad. He ought to have known better than to run up against\r\nUncle Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“How did they run up against Uncle Jethro?” asked Cynthia, now keenly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n“Don't you know?” exclaimed Bob, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cynthia, “or I shouldn't have asked.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't Uncle Jethro tell you about it?”\r\n\r\n“He never tells me anything about his affairs,” she answered.\r\n\r\nBob's astonishment did not wear off at once. Here was a new phase, and\r\nhe was very hard put. He had heard, casually, a good deal of abuse of\r\nJethro and his methods in the last two days.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “I don't know anything about politics. I don't know\r\nmyself why father and Mr. Duncan were so eager for this post-mastership.\r\nBut they were. And I heard them say something about the President going\r\nback on them when they had telegraphed from Chicago and come to see him\r\nhere. And maybe they didn't let Heth in for it. It seems Uncle Jethro\r\nonly had to walk up to the White House. They ought to have sense enough\r\nto know that he runs the state. But what's the use of wasting time over\r\nthis business?” said Bob. “I told you I was going to Brampton before the\r\nterm begins just to see you, didn't I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I didn't believe you,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Because it's my nature, I suppose,” she replied.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Bob, exasperated though he was, and he burst into\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“You're the queerest girl I've ever known,” he said.\r\n\r\nNot a very original remark.\r\n\r\n“That must be saying a great deal,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“You must have known many.”\r\n\r\n“I have,” he admitted, “and none of 'em, no matter how much they'd\r\nknocked about, were able to look out for themselves any better than\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Not even Cassandra Hopkins?” Cynthia could not resist saying. She\r\nsaw that she had scored; his expressions registered his sensations so\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\n“What do you know about her?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Cynthia, mysteriously, “I heard that you were very fond of\r\nher at Andover.”\r\n\r\nBob could not help pluming himself a little. He thought the fact that\r\nshe had mentioned the matter a flaw in Cynthia's armor, as indeed it\r\nwas. And yet he was not proud of the Cassandra Hopkins episode in his\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n“Cassandra is one of the institutions at Andover,” said he; “most\r\nfellows have to take a course in Cassandra to complete their education.”\r\n\r\n“Yours seems to be very complete,” Cynthia retorted.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” he exclaimed, looking at her, “no wonder you made\r\nmince-meat of the Honorable Heth. Where did you learn it all, Cynthia?”\r\n\r\nCynthia did not know. She merely wondered where she would be if she\r\nhadn't learned it. Something told her that if it were not for this\r\nanchor she would be drifting out to sea: might, indeed, soon be drifting\r\nout to sea in spite of it. It was one thing for Mr. Robert Worthington,\r\nwith his numerous resources, to amuse himself with a girl in her\r\nposition; it would be quite another thing for the girl. She got to her\r\nfeet and held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n“Good-by,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Good-by?”\r\n\r\n“We are leaving Washington at one o'clock, and Uncle Jethro will be\r\nworried if I am not in time for dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Leaving at one! That's the worst luck I've had yet. But I'm going back\r\nto the hotel myself.”\r\n\r\nCynthia didn't see how she was to prevent him walking with her. She\r\nwould not have admitted to herself that she had enjoyed this encounter,\r\nsince she was trying so hard not to enjoy it. So they started together\r\nout of the park. Bob, for a wonder, was silent awhile, glancing now and\r\nthen at her profile. He knew that he had a great deal to say, but he\r\ncouldn't decide exactly what it was to be. This is often the case with\r\nyoung men in his state of mind: in fact, to be paradoxical again, he\r\nmight hardly be said at this time to have had a state of mind. He lacked\r\nboth an attitude and a policy.\r\n\r\n“If you see Duncan before I do, let me know,” he remarked finally.\r\n\r\nCynthia bit her lip. “Why should I?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Because we've only got five minutes more alone together, at best. If we\r\nsee him in time, we can go down a side street.”\r\n\r\n“I think it would be hard to get away from Mr. Duncan if we met\r\nhim--even if we wanted to,” she said, laughing outright.\r\n\r\n“You don't know how true that is,” he replied, with feeling.\r\n\r\n“That sounds as though you'd tried it before.”\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention to this thrust.\r\n\r\n“I shan't see you again till I get to Brampton,” he said; “that will be\r\na whole week. And then,” he ventured to look at her, “I shan't see you\r\nuntil the Christmas holidays. You might be a little kind, Cynthia. You\r\nknow I've--I've always thought the world of you. I don't know how I'm\r\ngoing to get through the three months without seeing you.”\r\n\r\n“You managed to get through a good many years,” said Cynthia, looking at\r\nthe pavement.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said; “I was sent away to school and college, and our lives\r\nseparated.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, our lives separated,” she assented.\r\n\r\n“And I didn't know you were going to be like--like this,” he went on,\r\nvaguely enough, but with feeling.\r\n\r\n“Like what?”\r\n\r\n“Like--well, I'd rather be with you and talk to you than any girl I ever\r\nsaw. I don't care who she is,” Bob declared, “or how much she may\r\nhave traveled.” He was running into deep water. “Why are you so cold,\r\nCynthia?” “Why can't you be as you used to be? You used to like me well\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\n“And I like you now,” answered Cynthia. They were very near the hotel by\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n“You talk as if you were ten years older than I,” he said, smiling\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and turned to him, smiling. They had reached the steps.\r\n\r\n“I believe I am, Bob,” she replied. “I haven't seen much of the world,\r\nbut I've seen something of its troubles. Don't be foolish. If you're\r\ncoming to Brampton just to see me, don't come. Good-by.” And she gave\r\nhim her hand frankly.\r\n\r\n“But I will come to Brampton,” he cried, taking her hand and squeezing\r\nit. “I'd like to know why I shouldn't come.”\r\n\r\nAs Cynthia drew her hand away a gentleman came out of the hotel, paused\r\nfor a brief moment by the door and stared at them, and then passed on\r\nwithout a word or a nod of recognition. It was Mr. Worthington. Bob\r\nlooked after his father, and then glanced at Cynthia. There was a trifle\r\nmore color in her cheeks, and her head was raised a little, and her eyes\r\nwere fixed upon him gravely.\r\n\r\n“You should know why not,” she said, and before he could answer her she\r\nwas gone into the hotel. He did not attempt to follow her, but stood\r\nwhere she had left him in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused by the voice of the genial colored doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n“Wal, suh, you found the lady, Mistah Wo'thington. Thought you would,\r\nsuh. T'other young gentleman come in while ago--looked as if he was\r\nfeelin' powerful bad, Mistah Wo'thington.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Boston, Cynthia felt almost as if she were home again,\r\nand Ephraim declared that he had had the same feeling when he returned\r\nfrom the war. Though it be the prosperous capital of New England, it is\r\na city of homes, and the dwellers of it have held stanchly to the belief\r\nof their forefathers that the home is the very foundation-rock of the\r\nnation. Held stanchly to other beliefs, too: that wealth carries with it\r\nsome little measure of responsibility. The stranger within the gates of\r\nthat city feels that if he falls, a heedless world will not go charging\r\nover his body: that a helping hand will be stretched out,--a helping and\r\na wise hand that will inquire into the circumstances of his fall--but\r\nstill a human hand.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in the parlor of the Tremont House that morning with\r\nthe sun streaming in the windows, waiting for Ephraim.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” Cynthia asked, abruptly, “did you ever know my mother?”\r\n\r\nJethro started, and looked at her quickly.\r\n\r\n“W-why, Cynthy?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Because she grew up in Coniston,” answered Cynthia. “I never thought of\r\nit before, but of course you must have known her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I knew her,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Did you know her well?” she persisted.\r\n\r\nJethro got up and went over to the window, where he stood with his back\r\ntoward her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cynthy,” he answered at length.\r\n\r\n“Why haven't you ever told me about her?” asked Cynthia. How was she to\r\nknow that her innocent questions tortured him cruelly; that the spirit\r\nof the Cynthia who had come to him in the tannery house had haunted\r\nhim all his life, and that she herself, a new Cynthia, was still that\r\nspirit? The bygone Cynthia had been much in his thoughts since they came\r\nto Boston.\r\n\r\n“What was she like?”\r\n\r\n“She--she was like you, Cynthy,” he said, but he did not turn round.\r\n“She was a clever woman, and a good woman, and--a lady, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing for a while, but she tingled with pleasure because\r\nJethro had compared her to her mother. She determined to try to be like\r\nthat, if he thought her so.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said presently, “I'd like to go to see the house\r\nwhere she lived.”\r\n\r\n“Er--Ephraim knows it,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nSo when Ephraim came the three went over the hill; past the State House\r\nwhich Bulfinch set as a crown on the crest of it looking over the sweep\r\nof the Common, and on into the maze of quaint, old-world streets on\r\nthe slope beyond: streets with white porticos, and violet panes in the\r\nwindows. They came to an old square hidden away on a terrace of the\r\nhill, and after that the streets grew narrower and dingier. Ephraim,\r\nwhose memory never betrayed him, hobbled up to a shabby house in the\r\nmiddle of one of these blocks and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n“Here's where I found Will when I come back from the war,” he said, and\r\nexplained the matter in full to the slatternly landlady who came to the\r\ndoor. She was a good-natured woman, who thought her boarder would not\r\nmind, and led the way up the steep stairs to the chamber over the roofs\r\nwhere Wetherell and Cynthia had lived and hoped and worked together;\r\nwhere he had written those pages by which, with the aid of her loving\r\ncriticism, he had thought to become famous. The room was as bare now as\r\nit had been then, and Ephraim, poking his stick through a hole in the\r\ncarpet, ventured the assertion that even that had not been changed.\r\nJethro, staring out over the chimney tops, passed his hand across his\r\neyes. Cynthia Ware had come to this!\r\n\r\n“I found him right here in that bed,” Ephraim was saying, and he poked\r\nthe bottom boards, too. “The same bed. Had a shack when I saw him.\r\nCallate he wouldn't have lived two months if the war hadn't bust up and\r\nI hadn't come along.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cousin Eph!” exclaimed Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThe old soldier turned and saw that there were tears in her eyes. But,\r\nstranger than that, Cynthia saw that there were tears in his own.\r\nHe took her gently by the arm and led her down the stairs again, she\r\nsupporting him, and Jethro following.\r\n\r\nThat same morning, Jethro, whose memory was quite as good as Ephraim's,\r\nfound a little shop tucked away in Cornhill which had been miraculously\r\nspared in the advance of prosperity. Mr. Judson's name, however, was\r\nno longer in quaint lettering over the door. Standing before it, Jethro\r\ntold the story in his droll way, of a city clerk and a country bumpkin,\r\nand Cynthia and Ephraim both laughed so heartily that the people who\r\nwere passing turned round to look at them and laughed too. For the three\r\nwere an unusual group, even in Boston. It was not until they were seated\r\nat dinner in the hotel, Ephraim with his napkin tucked under his chin,\r\nthat Jethro gave them the key to the characters in this story.\r\n\r\n“And who was the locket for, Uncle Jethro?” demanded Cynthia.\r\n\r\nJethro, however, shook his head, and would not be induced to tell.\r\n\r\nThey were still so seated when Cynthia perceived coming toward them\r\nthrough the crowded dining roam a merry, middle-aged gentleman with a\r\nbald head. He seemed to know everybody in the room, for he was kept busy\r\nnodding right and left at the tables until he came to theirs. He was Mr.\r\nMerrill who had come to see her father in Coniston, and who had spoken\r\nso kindly to her on that occasion.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well,” he said; “Jethro, you'll be the death of me yet.\r\n'Don't write-send,' eh? Well, as long as you sent word you were here, I\r\ndon't complain. So you licked 'em again, eh--down in Washington? Never\r\nhad a doubt but what you would. Is this the new postmaster? How are\r\nyou, Mr. Prescott--and Cynthia--a young lady! Bless my soul,” said Mr.\r\nMerrill, looking her over as he shook her hand. “What have you done to\r\nher, Jethro? What kind of beauty powder do they use in Coniston?”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill took the seat next to her and continued to talk, scattering\r\nhis pleasantries equally among the three, patting her arm when her\r\nown turn came. She liked Mr. Merrill very much; he seemed to her (as,\r\nindeed, he was) honest and kind-hearted. Cynthia was not lacking in a\r\nproper appreciation of herself--that may have been discovered. But she\r\nwas puzzled to know why this gentleman should make it a point to pay\r\nsuch particular attention to a young country girl. Other railroad\r\npresidents whom she could name had not done so. She was thinking of\r\nthese things, rather than listening to Mr. Merrill's conversation, when\r\nthe sound of Mr. Worthington's name startled her.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jethro,” Mr. Merrill was saying, “you certainly nipped this\r\nlittle game of Worthington's in the bud. Thought he'd take you in the\r\nrear by going to Washington, did he? Ha, ha! I'd like to know how you\r\ndid it. I'll get you to tell me to-night--see if I don't. You're all\r\ncoming in to supper to-night, you know, at seven o'clock.”\r\n\r\nEphraim laid down his knife and fork for the first time. Were the\r\nwonders of this journey never to cease? And Jethro, once in his life,\r\nlooked nervous.\r\n\r\n“Er--er--Cyn'thy'll go, Steve--Cynthy'll go.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cynthy'll go,” laughed Mr. Merrill, “and you'll go, and Ephraim'll\r\ngo.” Although he by no means liked everybody, as would appear at first\r\nglance, Mr. Merrill had a way of calling people by their first names\r\nwhen he did fancy them.\r\n\r\n“Er--Steve,” said Jethro, “what would your wife say if I was to drink\r\ncoffee out of my saucer?”\r\n\r\n“Let's see,” said Mr. Merrill grave for once. “What's the punishment for\r\nthat in my house? I know what she'd do if you didn't drink it. What do\r\nyou think she'd do, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Ask him what was the matter with it,” said Cynthia, promptly.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cynthy,” said he, “I know why these old fellows take you round\r\nwith 'em. To take care of 'em, eh? They're not fit to travel alone.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it was settled, after much further argument, that they were all\r\nto sup at Mr. Merrill's house, Cynthia stoutly maintaining that she\r\nwould not desert them. And then Mr. Merrill, having several times\r\nrepeated the street and number, went, back to his office. There was much\r\nmysterious whispering between Ephraim and Jethro in the hotel parlor\r\nafter dinner, while Cynthia was turning over the leaves of a magazine,\r\nand then Ephraim proposed going out to see the sights.\r\n\r\n“Where's Uncle Jethro going?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“He'll meet us,” said Ephraim, promptly, but his voice was not quite\r\nsteady.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Uncle Jethro!” cried Cynthia, “you're trying to get out of it. You\r\nremember you promised to meet us in Washington.”\r\n\r\n“Guess he'll keep this app'intment,” said Ephraim, who seemed to be full\r\nof a strange mirth that bubbled over, for he actually winked at Jethro.\r\n went first to Faneuil Hall. Presently they found themselves among the\r\ncrowd in Washington Street, where Ephraim confessed the trepidation\r\nwhich he felt over the coming supper party: a trepidation greater, so\r\nhe declared many times, than he had ever experienced before any of his\r\nbattles in the war. He stopped once or twice in the eddy of the crowd to\r\nglance up at the numbers; and finally came to a halt before the windows\r\nof a large dry-goods store.\r\n\r\n“I guess I ought to buy a new shirt for this occasion, Cynthy,” he said,\r\nstaring hard at the articles of apparel displayed there: “Let's go in.”\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright, since Ephraim could not by any chance have\r\nworn any of the articles in question.\r\n\r\n“Why, Cousin Ephraim,” she exclaimed, “you can't buy gentlemen's things\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I guess you can,” said Ephraim, and hobbled confidently in at the\r\ndoorway. There we will leave him for a while conversing in an undertone\r\nwith a floor-walker, and follow Jethro. He, curiously enough, had some\r\nfifteen minutes before gone in at the same doorway, questioned the\r\nsame floor-walker, and he found himself in due time walking amongst a\r\nbewildering lot of models on the third floor, followed by a giggling\r\nsaleswoman.\r\n\r\n“What kind of a dress do you want, sir?” asked the saleslady,--for we\r\nare impelled to call her so.\r\n\r\n“S-silk cloth,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“What shades of silk would you like, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Shades? shades? What do you mean by shades?”\r\n\r\n“Why, colors,” said the saleslady, giggling openly.\r\n\r\n“Green,” said Jethro, with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe saleslady clapped her hand over her mouth and led the way to another\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n“You don't call that green--do you? That's not green enough.”\r\n\r\nThey inspected another dress, and then another and another,--not all of\r\nthem were green,--Jethro expressing very decided if not expert views on\r\neach of them. At last he paused before two models at the far end of the\r\nroom, passing his hand repeatedly over each as he had done so often with\r\nthe cattle of Coniston.\r\n\r\n“These two pieces same kind of goods?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Er-this one is a little shinier than that one?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the finish is a little higher,” ventured the saleslady.\r\n\r\n“Sh-shinier,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Yes, shinier, if you please to call it so.”\r\n\r\n“W-what would you call it?”\r\n\r\nBy this time the saleslady had become quite hysterical, and altogether\r\nincapable of performing her duties. Jethro looked at her for a moment in\r\ndisgust, and in his predicament cast around for another to wait on him.\r\nThere was no lack of these, at a safe distance, but they all seemed to\r\nbe affected by the same mania. Jethro's eye alighted upon the back of\r\nanother customer. She was, apparently, a respectable-looking lady\r\nof uncertain age, and her own attention was so firmly fixed in the\r\ncontemplation of a model that she had not remarked the merriment about\r\nher, nor its cause. She did not see Jethro, either, as he strode across\r\nto her. Indeed, her first intimation of his presence was a dig in her\r\narm. The lady turned, gave a gasp of amazement at the figure confronting\r\nher, and proceeded to annihilate it with an eye that few women possess.\r\n\r\n“H-how do, Ma'am,” he said. Had he known anything about the appearance\r\nof women in general, he might have realized that he had struck a tartar.\r\nThis lady was at least sixty-five, and probably unmarried. Her face,\r\nthough not at all unpleasant, was a study in character-development: she\r\nwore ringlets, a peculiar bonnet of a bygone age, and her clothes had\r\ncertain eccentricities which, for, lack of knowledge, must be omitted.\r\nIn short, the lady was no fool, and not being one she glanced at the\r\ngiggling group of saleswomen and--wonderful to relate--they stopped\r\ngiggling. Then she looked again at Jethro and gave him a smile. One of\r\nsuperiority, no doubt, but still a smile.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, sir?”\r\n\r\n“T-trying to buy a silk cloth gown for a woman. There's two over here I\r\nfancied a little. Er--thought perhaps you'd help me.”\r\n\r\n“Where are the dresses?” she demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nJethro led the way in silence until they came to the models. She planted\r\nherself in front of them and looked them over swiftly but critically.\r\n\r\n“What is the age of the lady?”\r\n\r\n“W-what difference does that make?” said Jethro, whose instinct was\r\nagainst committing himself to strangers.\r\n\r\n“Difference!” she exclaimed sharply, “it makes a considerable\r\ndifference. Perhaps not to you, but to the lady. What coloring is she?”\r\n\r\n“C-coloring? She's white.”\r\n\r\nHis companion turned her back on him.\r\n\r\n“What size is she?”\r\n\r\n“A-about that size,” said Jethro, pointing to a model.\r\n\r\n“About! about!” she ejaculated, and then she faced him. “Now look here,\r\nmy friend,” she said vigorously, “there's something very mysterious\r\nabout all this. You look like a good man, but you may be a very wicked\r\none for all I know. I've lived long enough to discover that appearances,\r\nespecially where your sex is concerned, are deceitful. Unless you\r\nare willing to tell me who this lady is for whom you are buying silk\r\ndresses, and what your relationship is to her, I shall leave you. And\r\nmind, no evasions. I can detect the truth pretty well when I hear it.”\r\n\r\nUnexpected as it was, Jethro gave back a step or two before this\r\nonslaught of feminine virtue, and the movement did not tend to raise him\r\nin the lady's esteem. He felt that he would rather face General Grant\r\na thousand times than this person. She was, indeed, preparing to sweep\r\naway when there came a familiar tap-tap behind them on the bare floor,\r\nand he turned to behold Ephraim hobbling toward them with the aid of his\r\ngreen umbrella, Cynthia by his side.\r\n\r\n“Why, it's Uncle Jethro,” cried Cynthia, looking at him and the lady in\r\nastonishment, and then with equal astonishment at the models. “What in\r\nthe world are you doing here?” Then a light seemed to dawn on her.\r\n\r\n“You frauds! So this is what you were whispering about! This is the way\r\nCousin Ephraim buys his shirts!”\r\n\r\n“C-Cynthy,” said Jethro, apologetically, “d-don't you think you ought to\r\nhave a nice city dress for that supper party?”\r\n\r\n“So you're ashamed of my country clothes, are you?” she asked gayly.\r\n\r\n“W-want you to have the best, Cynthy,” he replied. “I-I-meant to have\r\nit all chose and bought when you come, but I got into a kind of argument\r\nwith this lady.”\r\n\r\n“Argument!” exclaimed the lady. But she did not seem displeased. She had\r\nbeen staring very fixedly at Cynthia. “My dear,” she continued kindly,\r\n“you look like some one I used to know a long, long time ago, and I'll\r\nbe glad to help you. Your uncle may be sensible enough in other matters,\r\nbut I tell him frankly he is out of place here. Let him go away and sit\r\ndown somewhere with the other gentleman, and we'll get the dress between\r\nus, if he'll tell us how much to pay.”\r\n\r\n“P-pay anything, so's you get it,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro, do you really want it so much?”\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that Cynthia did not wish for a dress, too. But\r\nthe sense of dependence on Jethro and the fear of straining his purse\r\nnever quite wore off. So Jethro and Ephraim took to a bench at some\r\ndistance, and at last a dress was chosen--not one of the gorgeous models\r\nJethro had picked out, but a pretty, simple, girlish gown which Cynthia\r\nherself had liked and of which the lady highly approved. Not content\r\nwith helping to choose it, the lady must satisfy herself that it fit,\r\nwhich it did perfectly. And so Cynthia was transformed into a city\r\nperson, though her skin glowed with a health with which few city people\r\nare blessed.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said the lady, still staring at her, “you look very well. I\r\nshould scarcely have supposed it.” Cynthia took the remark in good part,\r\nfor she thought the lady a character, which she was. “I hope you will\r\nremember that we women were created for a higher purpose than mere\r\nbeauty. The Lord gave us brains, and meant that we should use them. If\r\nyou have a good mind, as I believe you have, learn to employ it for the\r\nbetterment of your sex, for the time of our emancipation is at hand.”\r\n Having delivered this little lecture, the lady continued to stare at her\r\nwith keen eyes. “You look very much like someone I used to love when I\r\nwas younger. What is your name.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia Wetherell.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia Wetherell? Was your mother Cynthia Ware, from Coniston?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia, amazed.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the strange lady had risen and had taken Cynthia in her\r\nembrace, new dress and all.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she said, “I thought your face had a familiar look. It was\r\nyour mother I knew and loved. I'm Miss Lucretia Penniman.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman! Could this be, indeed, the authoress of the\r\n“Hymn to Coniston,” of whom Brampton was so proud? The Miss Lucretia\r\nPenniman who sounded the first clarion note for the independence of\r\nAmerican women, the friend of Bryant and Hawthorne and Longfellow?\r\nCynthia had indeed heard of her. Did not all Brampton point to the house\r\nwhich had held the Social Library as to a shrine?\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” said Miss Lucretia, “I have a meeting now of a girls' charity\r\nto which I must go, but you will come to me at the offices of the\r\nWoman's Hour to-morrow morning at ten. I wish to talk to you about your\r\nmother and yourself.”\r\n\r\nCynthia promised, provided they did not leave for Coniston earlier, and\r\nin that event agreed to write. Whereupon Miss Lucretia kissed her again\r\nand hurried off to her meeting. On the way back to the Tremont House\r\nCynthia related excitedly the whole circumstance to Jethro and Ephraim.\r\nEphraim had heard of Miss Lucretia, of course. Who had not? But he did\r\nnot read the Woman's Hour. Jethro was silent. Perhaps he was thinking\r\nof that fresh summer morning, so long ago, when a girl in a gig had\r\novertaken him in the canon made by the Brampton road through the woods.\r\nThe girl had worn a poke bonnet, and was returning a book to this same\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman's Social Library. And the book was the “Life of\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro, shall we still be in Boston to-morrow morning?” Cynthia\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself. “Yes,” he said, “yes.” “When are you going home?”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer this simple question, but countered. “Hain't you\r\nenjoyin' yourself, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I am,” she declared. But she thought it strange that he would\r\nnot tell her when they would be in Coniston.\r\n\r\nEphraim did buy a new shirt, and also (in view of the postmastership in\r\nhis packet) a new necktie, his old one being slightly frayed.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the approaching supper party and the fear of Mrs.\r\nMerrill hung very heavy over him; nor was Jethro's mind completely at\r\nrest. Ephraim even went so far as to discuss the question as to whether\r\nMr. Merrill had not surpassed his authority in inviting him, and full\r\nexpected to be met at the door by that gentleman uttering profuse\r\napologies, which Ephraim was quite prepared and willing to take in good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind happened, however. Mr. Merrill's railroad being a\r\nmodest one, his house was modest likewise. But Ephraim thought it grand\r\nenough, and yet acknowledged a homelike quality in its grandeur. He\r\nbegan by sitting on the edge of the sofa and staring at the cut-glass\r\nchandelier, but in five minutes he discovered with a shock of surprise\r\nthat he was actually leaning back, describing in detail how his regiment\r\nhad been cheered as they marched through Boston. And incredible as it\r\nmay seem, the person whom he was entertaining in this manner was Mrs.\r\nStephen Merrill herself. Mrs. Merrill was as tall as Mr. Merrill was\r\nshort. She wore a black satin dress with a big cameo brooch pinned at\r\nher throat, her hair was gray, and her face almost masculine until it\r\nlighted up with a wonderfully sweet smile. That smile made Ephraim and\r\nJethro feel at home; and Cynthia, too, who liked Mrs. Merrill the moment\r\nshe laid eyes on her.\r\n\r\nThen there were the daughters, Jane and Susan, who welcomed her with a\r\nhospitality truly amazing for city people. Jane was big-boned like her\r\nmother, but Susan was short and plump and merry like her father. Susan\r\ntalked and laughed, and Jane sat and listened and smiled, and Cynthia\r\ncould not decide which she liked the best. And presently they all went\r\ninto the dining room to supper, where there was another chandelier over\r\nthe table. There was also real silver, which shone brilliantly on the\r\nwhite cloth--but there was nothing to eat.\r\n\r\n“Do tell us another story, Mr. Prescott,” said Susan, who had listened\r\nto his last one.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the table, however, had for the moment upset Ephraim, “Get\r\nJethro to tell you how he took dinner with Jedge Binney,” he said.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, under the circumstances, might not have been a happy\r\none, but its lack of appropriateness did not strike Jethro either. He\r\nyielded to the demand.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “I supposed I was goin' to set down same as I would at\r\nhome, where we put the vittles on the table. W-wondered what I was goin'\r\nto eat--wahn't nothin' but a piece of bread on the table. S-sat there\r\nand watched 'em--nobody ate anything. Presently I found out that\r\nBinney's wife ran her house same as they run hotels. Pretty soon a\r\ncouple of girls come in and put down some food and took it away again\r\nbefore you had a chance. A-after a while we had coffee, and when I set\r\nmy cup on the table, I noticed Mis' Binney looked kind of cross and\r\nbegan whisperin' to the girls. One of 'em fetched a small plate and took\r\nmy cup and set it on the plate. That was all right. I used the plate.\r\n\r\n“Well, along about next summer Binney had to come to Coniston to see me\r\non a little matter and fetched his wife. Listy, my wife, was alive then.\r\nI'd made up my mind that if I could ever get Mis' Binney to eat at my\r\nplace I would, so I asked 'em to stay to dinner. When we set down, I\r\nsaid: 'Now, Mis' Binney, you and the Judge take right hold, and anything\r\nyou can't reach, speak out and we'll wait on you.' And Mis' Binney?'\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said. “She was a little mite scared, I guess. B-begun to\r\nsuspect somethin'.”\r\n\r\n“Mis' Binney,” said I, “y-you can set your cup and sarcer where you've\r\na mind to.' O-ought to have heard the Judge laugh. Says he to his wife:\r\n'Fanny, I told you Jethro'd get even with you some time for that sarcer\r\nbusiness.'”\r\n\r\nThis story, strange as it may seem, had a great success at Mr. Merrill's\r\ntable. Mr. Merrill and his daughter Susan shrieked with laughter when\r\nit was finished, while Mrs. Merrill and Jane enjoyed themselves quite as\r\nmuch in their quiet way. Even the two neat Irish maids, who were serving\r\nthe supper very much as poor Mis' Binney's had been served, were fain\r\nto leave the dining room abruptly, and one of them disgraced herself\r\nat sight of Jethro when she came in again, and had to go out once mare.\r\nMrs. Merrill insisted that Jethro should pour out his coffee in what she\r\nwas pleased to call the old-fashioned way. All of which goes to prove\r\nthat table-silver and cut glass chandeliers do not invariably make their\r\nowners heartless and inhospitable. And Ephraim, whose plan of campaign\r\nhad been to eat nothing to speak of and have a meal when he got back to\r\nthe hotel, found that he wasn't hungry when he arose from the table.\r\n\r\nThere was much bantering of Jethro by Mr. Merrill, which the ladies did\r\nnot understand--talk of a mighty coalition of the big railroads which\r\nwas to swallow up the little railroads. Fortunately, said Mr.\r\nMerrill, humorously, fortunately they did not want his railroad. Or\r\nunfortunately, which was it? Jethro didn't know. He never laughed at\r\nanybody's jokes. But Cynthia, who was listening with one ear while Susan\r\ntalked into the other, gathered that Jethro had been struggling with the\r\nrailroads, and was sooner or later to engage in a mightier struggle with\r\nthem. How, she asked herself in her innocence, was any one, even Uncle\r\nJethro, to struggle with a railroad? Many other people in these latter\r\ndays have asked themselves that very question.\r\n\r\nAll together the evening at Mr. Merrill's passed off so quickly and so\r\nhappily that Ephraim was dismayed when he discovered that it was ten\r\no'clock, and he began to make elaborate apologies to the ladies. But\r\nJethro and Mr. Merrill were still closeted together in the dining room:\r\nonce Mrs. Merrill had been called to that conference, and had returned\r\nafter a while to take her place quietly again among the circle of\r\nEphraim's listeners. Now Mr. Merrill came out of the dining room alone.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he said, and his tone was a little more grave than usual,\r\n“your Uncle Jethro wants to speak to you.”\r\n\r\nCynthia rose, with a sense of something in the air which concerned her,\r\nand went into the dining room. Was it the light falling from above that\r\nbrought out the lines of his face so strongly? Cynthia did not know, but\r\nshe crossed the room swiftly and sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Uncle Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“C-Cynthy,” he said, putting his hand over hers on the table, “I want\r\nyou to do something for me er--for me,” he repeated, emphasizing the\r\nlast word.\r\n\r\n“I'll do anything in the world for you, Uncle Jethro,” she answered;\r\n“you know that. What--what is it?”\r\n\r\n“L-like Mr. Merrill, don't you?” “Yes, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“L-like Mrs. Merrill--like the gals--don't you?” “Very much,” said\r\nCynthia, perplexedly.\r\n\r\n“Like 'em enough to--to live with 'em a winter?”\r\n\r\n“Live with them a winter!”\r\n\r\n“C-Cynthy, I want you should stay in Boston this winter and go to a\r\nyoung ladies' school.”\r\n\r\nIt was out. He had said it, though he never quite knew where he had\r\nfound the courage.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro!” she cried. She could only look at him in dismay, but the\r\ntears came into her eyes and sparkled.\r\n\r\n“You--you'll be happy here, Cynthy. It'll be a change for you. And I\r\nshan't be so lonesome as you'd think. I'll--I'll be busy this winter,\r\nCynthy.”\r\n\r\n“You know that I wouldn't leave you, Uncle Jethro,” she said\r\nreproachfully. “I should be lonesome, if you wouldn't. You would be\r\nlonesome--you know you would be.”\r\n\r\n“You'll do this for me, Cynthy. S-said you would, didn't you--said you\r\nwould?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you want me to do this?”\r\n\r\n“W-want you to go to school for a winter, Cynthy. Shouldn't think I'd\r\ndone right by you if I didn't.”\r\n\r\n“But I have been to school. Daddy taught me a lot, and Mr. Satterlee has\r\ntaught me a great deal more. I know as much as most girls of my age, and\r\nI will study so hard in Coniston this winter, if that is what you want.\r\nI've never neglected my lessons, Uncle Jethro.”\r\n\r\n“Tain't book-larnin'--'tain't what you'd get in book larnin' in Boston,\r\nCynthy.”\r\n\r\n“What, then?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jethro, “they'd teach you to be a lady, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\n“A lady!”\r\n\r\n“Your father come of good people, and--and your mother was a lady. I'm\r\nonly a rough old man, Cynthy, and I don't know much about the ways of\r\nfine folks. But you've got it in ye, and I want you should be equal to\r\nthe best of 'em: You can. And I shouldn't die content unless I'd felt\r\nthat you'd had the chance. Er--Cynthy--will you do it for me?”\r\n\r\nShe was silent a long while before she turned to him, and then the tears\r\nwere running very swiftly down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will do it for you,” she answered. “Uncle Jethro, I believe you\r\nare the best man, in the world.”\r\n\r\n“D-don't say that, Cynthy--d-don't say that,” he exclaimed, and a sharp\r\nagony was in his voice. He got to his feet and went to the folding doors\r\nand opened them. “Steve!” he called, “Steve!”\r\n\r\n“S-says she'll stay, Steve.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had come in, followed by his wife. Cynthia saw them but\r\ndimly through her tears. And while she tried to wipe the tears away she\r\nfelt Mrs. Merrill's arm about her, and heard that lady say:--“We'll\r\ntry to make you very happy, my dear, and send you back safely in the\r\nspring.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAn attempt will be made in these pages to set down such incidents which\r\nalone may be vital to this chronicle, now so swiftly running on. The\r\nreasons why Mr. Merrill was willing to take Cynthia into his house must\r\ncertainly be clear to the reader. In the first place, he was under very\r\nheavy obligations to Jethro Bass for many favors; in the second place,\r\nMr. Merrill had a real affection for Jethro, which, strange as it may\r\nseem to some, was quite possible; and in the third place, Mr.\r\nMerrill had taken a fancy to Cynthia, and he had never forgotten the\r\nunintentional wrong he had done William Wetherell. Mr. Merrill was a man\r\nof impulses, and generally of good impulses. Had he not himself urged\r\nupon Jethro the arrangement, it would never have come about. Lastly, he\r\nhad invited Cynthia to his house that his wife might inspect her, and\r\nMrs. Merrill's verdict had been instant and favorable--a verdict not\r\ngiven in words. A single glance was sufficient, for these good people\r\nso understood each other that Mrs. Merrill had only to raise her eyes\r\nto her husband's, and this she did shortly after the supper party began;\r\nwhile she was pouring the coffee, to be exact. Thus the compact that\r\nCynthia was to spend the winter in their house was ratified.\r\n\r\nThere was, first of all, the parting with Jethro and the messages\r\nwith which he and Ephraim were laden for the whole village and town of\r\nConiston. It was very hard, that parting, and need not be dwelt upon.\r\nEphraim waved his blue handkerchief as the train pulled out, but Jethro\r\nstood on the platform, silent and motionless: more eloquent in his\r\nsorrow--so Mr. Merrill thought--than any human being he had ever known.\r\nMr. Merrill wondered if Jethro's sorrow were caused by this parting\r\nalone; he believed it was not, and suddenly guessed at the true note\r\nof it. Having come by chance upon the answer to the riddle, Mr. Merrill\r\nstood still with his hand on the carriage door and marvelled that he had\r\nnot seen it all sooner. He was a man to take to heart the troubles of\r\nhis friends. A subtle change had indeed come over Jethro, and he was not\r\nthe same man Mr. Merrill had known for many years. Would others, the men\r\nwith whom Jethro contended and the men he commanded, mark this change?\r\nAnd what effect would it have on the conflict for the mastery of a state\r\nwhich was to be waged from now on?\r\n\r\n“Father,” said his daughter Susan, “if you don't get in and close the\r\ndoor, we'll drive off and leave you standing on the sidewalk.”\r\n\r\nThus Cynthia went to her new friends in their own carriage. Mrs. Merrill\r\nwas goodness itself, and loved the girl for what she was. How, indeed,\r\nwas she to help loving her? Cynthia was scrupulous in her efforts to\r\ngive no trouble, and yet she never had the air of a dependent or a\r\nbeneficiary; but held her head high, and when called upon gave an\r\nopinion as though she had a right to it. The very first morning Susan,\r\nwho was prone to be late to breakfast, came down in a great state of\r\nexcitement and laughter.\r\n\r\n“What do you think Cynthia's done, Mother?” she cried. “I went into her\r\nroom a while ago, and it was all swept and aired, and she was making up\r\nthe bed.”\r\n\r\n“That's an excellent plan,” said Mrs. Merrill, “tomorrow morning you\r\nthree girls will have a race to see who makes up her room first.”\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the race at bed-making never came off, Susan\r\nand Jane having pushed Cynthia into a corner as soon as breakfast was\r\nover, and made certain forcible representations which she felt bound to\r\nrespect, and a treaty was drawn up and faithfully carried out,\r\nbetween the three, that she was to do her own room if necessary to her\r\nhappiness. The chief gainer by the arrangement was the chambermaid.\r\n\r\nOdd as it may seem, the Misses Merrill lived amicably enough\r\nwith Cynthia. It is a difficult matter to force an account of the\r\nrelationship of five people living in one house into a few pages, but\r\nthe fact that the Merrills had large hearts makes this simpler. There\r\nare few families who can accept with ease the introduction of a stranger\r\ninto their midst, even for a time, and there are fewer strangers who can\r\nwith impunity be introduced. The sisters quarrelled among themselves\r\nas all sisters will, and sometimes quarrelled with Cynthia. But oftener\r\nthey made her the arbiter of their disputes, and asked her advice on\r\ncertain matters. Especially was this true of Susan, whom certain young\r\ngentlemen from Harvard College called upon more or less frequently, and\r\nCynthia had all of Susan's love affairs--including the current one--by\r\nheart in a very short time.\r\n\r\nAs for Cynthia, there were many subjects on which she had to take the\r\nadvice of the sisters. They did not criticise the joint creations of\r\nherself and Miss Sukey Kittredge as frankly as Janet Duncan had done;\r\nbut Jethro had left in Mrs. Merrill's hands a certain sufficient sum for\r\nnew dresses for Cynthia, and in due time the dresses were got and worn.\r\nTo do them justice, the sisters were really sincere in their rejoicings\r\nover the very wonderful transformation which they had been chiefly\r\ninstrumental in effecting.\r\n\r\nIt is not a difficult task to praise a heroine, and one that should be\r\nindulged in but charily. But let some little indulgence be accorded this\r\nparticular heroine by reason of the life she had led, and the situation\r\nin which she now found herself: a poor Coniston girl, dependent on one\r\nwho was not her father, though she loved him as a father; beholden to\r\nthese good people who dwelt in a world into which she had no reasonable\r\nexpectations of entering, and which, to tell the truth, she now feared.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that Cynthia should be brought into contact with many\r\nfriends and relations of the family. Some of these noticed and admired\r\nher; others did neither; others gossiped about Mrs. Merrill behind her\r\nback at her own dinners and sewing circles and wondered what folly could\r\nhave induced her to bring the girl into her house. But Mrs. Merrill,\r\nlike many generous people who do not stop to calculate a kindness, was\r\nalways severely criticised.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were Jane's and Susan's friends, in and out of Miss\r\nSadler's school. For Mrs. Merrill's influence had been sufficient\r\nto induce Miss Sadler to take Cynthia as a day scholar with her own\r\ndaughters. This, be it known, was a great concession on the part of Miss\r\nSadler, who regarded Cynthia's credentials as dubious enough; and her\r\nyoung ladies were inclined to regard them so, likewise. Some of these\r\nyoung ladies came from other cities,--New York and Philadelphia and\r\nelsewhere,--and their fathers and mothers were usually people to be\r\nmentioned as a matter of course--were, indeed, frequently so mentioned\r\nby Miss Sadler, especially when a visitor called at the school.\r\n\r\n“Isabel, I saw that your mother sailed for Europe yesterday,”\r\n or, “Sally, your father tells me he is building a gallery for his\r\ncollection.” Then to the visitor, “You know the Broke house in\r\nWashington Square, of course.”\r\n\r\nOf course the visitor did. But Sally or Isabel would often imitate\r\nMiss Sadler behind her back, showing how well they understood her\r\nsnobbishness.\r\n\r\nMiss Sadler was by no means the type which we have come to recognize in\r\nthe cartoons as the Boston school ma'am. She was a little, round person\r\nwith thin lips and a sharp nose all out of character with her roundness,\r\nand bright eyes like a bird's. To do her justice, so far as instruction\r\nwent, her scholars were equally well cared for, whether they hailed from\r\nWashington Square or Washington Court House. There were, indeed, none\r\nfrom such rural sorts of places--except Cynthia. But Miss Sadler did not\r\ntake her hand on the opening day--or afterward--and ask her about Uncle\r\nJethro. Oh, no. Miss Sadler had no interest for great men who did not\r\nsail for Europe or add picture galleries on to their houses. Cynthia\r\nlaughed, a little bitterly, perhaps, at the thought of a picture gallery\r\nbeing added to the tannery house. And she told herself stoutly that\r\nUncle Jethro was a greater man than any of the others, even if Miss\r\nSadler did not see fit to mention him. So she had her first taste of a\r\nkind of wormwood that is very common in the world though it did not grow\r\nin Coniston.\r\n\r\nFor a while after Cynthia's introduction to the school she was calmly\r\nignored by many of the young ladies there, and once openly--snubbed, to\r\nuse the word in its most disagreeable sense. Not that she gave any of\r\nthem any real cause to snub her. She did not intrude her own affairs\r\nupon them, but she was used to conversing kindly with the people about\r\nher as equals, and for this offence; on the third day, Miss Sally Broke\r\nsnubbed her. It is hard not to make a heroine of Cynthia, not to be able\r\nto relate that she instantly put Miss Sally's nose out of joint. Susan\r\nMerrill tried to do that, and failed signally, for Miss Sally's nose was\r\nnot easily dislodged. Susan fought more than one of Cynthia's battles.\r\nAs a matter of fact, Cynthia did not know that she had been affronted\r\nuntil that evening. She did not tell her friends how she spent the night\r\nyearning fiercely for Coniston and Uncle Jethro, at times weeping for\r\nthem, if the truth be told; how she had risen before the dawn to write\r\na letter, and to lay some things in the rawhide trunk. The letter was\r\nnever sent, and the packing never finished. Uncle Jethro wished her to\r\nstay and to learn to be a lady, and stay she would, in spite of Miss\r\nBroke and the rest of them. She went to school the next day, and for\r\nmany days and weeks thereafter, and held communion with the few alone\r\nwho chose to treat her pleasantly. Unquestionably this is making a\r\nheroine of Cynthia.\r\n\r\nIf young men are cruel in their schools, what shall be written of young\r\nwomen? It would be better to say that both are thoughtless. Miss Sally\r\nBroke, strange as it may seem, had a heart, and many of the other young\r\nladies whose fathers sailed for Europe and owned picture galleries; but\r\nthese young ladies were absorbed, especially after vacation, in affairs\r\nof which a girl from Coniston had no part. Their friends were not her\r\nfriends, their amusements not her amusements, and their talk not her\r\ntalk. But Cynthia watched them, as was her duty, and gradually absorbed\r\nmany things which are useful if not essential--outward observances of\r\nwhich the world takes cognizance, and which she had been sent there by\r\nUncle Jethro to learn. Young people of Cynthia's type and nationality\r\nare the most adaptable in the world.\r\n\r\nBefore the December snows set in Cynthia had made one firm friend, at\r\nleast, in Boston; outside of the Merrill family. That friend was Miss\r\nLucretia Penniman, editress of the Woman's Hour. Miss Lucretia lived in\r\nthe queerest and quaintest of the little houses tucked away under the\r\nhill, with the back door a story higher than the fronts an arrangement\r\nwhich in summer enabled the mistress to walk out of her sitting-room\r\nwindows into a little walled garden. In winter that sitting room was the\r\nsunniest, cosiest room in the city, and Cynthia spent many hours there,\r\nreading or listening to the wisdom that fell from the lips of Miss\r\nLucretia or her guests. The sitting room had uneven, yellow-white\r\npanelling that fairly shone with enamel, mahogany bookcases filled with\r\nauthors who had chosen to comply with Miss Lucretia's somewhat rigorous\r\ncensorship; there was a table laden with such magazines as had to do\r\nwith the uplifting of a sex, a delightful wavy floor covered with a rose\r\ncarpet; and, needless to add, not a pin or a pair of scissors out of\r\nplace in the whole apartment.\r\n\r\nThere is no intention of enriching these pages with Miss Lucretia's\r\nhomilies. Their subject-matter may be found in the files of the Woman's\r\nHour. She did not always preach, although many people will not believe\r\nthis statement. Miss Lucretia, too, had a heart, though she kept it\r\nhidden away, only to be brought out on occasions when she was sure\r\nof its appreciation, and she grew strangely interested in this\r\nself-contained girl from Coniston whose mother she had known. Miss\r\nLucretia understood Cynthia, who also was the kind who kept her heart\r\nhidden, the kind who conceal their troubles and sufferings because they\r\nfind it difficult to give them out. So Miss Lucretia had Cynthia to take\r\nsupper with her at least once in the week, and watched her quietly, and\r\nlet her speak of as much of her life as she chose--which was not much,\r\nat first. But Miss Lucretia was content to wait, and guessed at many\r\nthings which Cynthia did not tell her, and made some personal effort,\r\nunknown to Cynthia, to find out other things. It will be said that she\r\nhad designs on the girl. If so, they were generous designs; and perhaps\r\nit was inevitable that Miss Lucretia should recognize in every young\r\nwoman of spirit and brains a possible recruit for the cause.\r\n\r\nIt has now been shown in some manner and as briefly as possible how\r\nCynthia's life had changed, and what it had become. We have got her\r\npartly through the winter, and find her still dreaming of the sparkling\r\nsnow on Coniston and of the wind whirling it on clear, cold days like\r\nsmoke among the spruces; of Uncle Jethro sitting by his stove through\r\nthe long evenings all alone; of Rias in his store and Moses Hatch and\r\nLem Hallowell, and Cousin Ephraim in his new post-office. Uncle Jethro\r\nwrote for the first time in his life--letters: short letters, but in\r\nhis own handwriting, and deserving of being read for curiosity's sake\r\nif there were time. The wording was queer enough and guarded enough,\r\nbut they were charged with a great affection which clung to them like\r\nlavender.\r\n\r\nAnd Cynthia kept them every one, and read them over on such occasions\r\nwhen she felt that she could not live another minute out of sight of her\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs one gray afternoon in December when\r\nCynthia, who was sitting in Mrs. Merrill's parlor, suddenly looked up\r\nfrom her book to discover that two young men were in the room. The young\r\nmen were apparently quite as much surprised as she, and the parlor maid\r\nstood grinning behind them.\r\n\r\n“Tell Miss Susan and Miss Jane, Ellen,” said Cynthia, preparing to\r\ndepart. One of the young men she recognized from a photograph on Susan's\r\nbureau. He was, for the time being, Susan's. His name, although it does\r\nnot matter much, was Morton Browne, and he would have been considerably\r\nastonished if he had guessed how much of his history Cynthia knew. It\r\nwas Mr. Browne's habit to take Susan for a walk as often as propriety\r\npermitted, and on such occasions he generally brought along a\r\ngood-natured classmate to take care of Jane. This, apparently, was\r\none of the occasions. Mr. Browne was tall and dark and generally\r\ngood-looking, while his friends were usually distinguished for their\r\ngood nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Browne stood between her and the door and looked at her rather\r\nfixedly. Then he said:--“Excuse me.”\r\n\r\nA great many friendships, and even love affairs, have been inaugurated\r\nby just such an opening.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Cynthia, and tried to pass out. But Mr. Browne had no\r\nintention of allowing her to do so if he could help it.\r\n\r\n“I hope I am not intruding,” he said politely.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” answered Cynthia, wondering how she could get by him.\r\n\r\n“Were you waiting for Miss Merrill?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Cynthia again.\r\n\r\nThe other young man turned his back and became absorbed in the picture\r\nof a lion getting ready to tear a lady to pieces. But Mr. Browne was of\r\nthat mettle which is not easily baffled in such matters. He introduced\r\nhimself, and desired to know whom he had the honor of addressing.\r\nCynthia could not but enlighten him. Mr. Browne was greatly astonished,\r\nand showed it.\r\n\r\n“So you are the mysterious young lady who has been staying here in the\r\nhouse this winter,” he exclaimed, as though it were a marvellous thing.\r\n“I have heard Miss Merrill speak of you. She admires you very much. Is\r\nit true that you come from--Coniston?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Let me see--where is Coniston?” inquired Mr. Browne.\r\n\r\n“Do you know where Brampton is?” asked Cynthia. “Coniston is near\r\nBrampton.”\r\n\r\n“Brampton!” exclaimed Mr. Browne, “I have a classmate who comes from\r\nBrampton--Bob Worthington--You must know Bob, then.”\r\n\r\nYes, Cynthia knew Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“His father's got a mint of money, they say. I've been told that old\r\nWorthington was the whole show up in those parts. Is that true?”\r\n\r\n“Not quite,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nNot quite! Mr. Morton Browne eyed her in surprise, and from that moment\r\nshe began to have decided possibilities. Just then Jane and Susan\r\nentered arrayed for the walk, but Mr. Browne showed himself in no\r\nhurry to depart: began to speak, indeed, in a deprecating way about the\r\nweather, appealed to his friend, Mr. King, if it didn't look remarkably\r\nlike rain, or hail, or snow. Susan sat down, Jane sat down, Mr. Browne\r\nand his friend prepared to sit down when Cynthia moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n“You're not going, Cynthia!” cried Susan, in a voice that may have had\r\na little too much eagerness in it. “You must stay and help us entertain\r\nMr. Browne.” (Mr. King, apparently, was not to be entertained.) “We've\r\ntried so hard to make her come down when people called, Mr. Browne, but\r\nshe never would.”\r\n\r\nCynthia was not skilled in the art of making excuses. She hesitated for\r\none, and was lost. So she sat down, as far from Mr. Browne as possible,\r\nnext to Jane. In a few minutes Mr. Browne was seated beside her, and how\r\nhe accomplished this manoeuvre Cynthia could not have said, so skilfully\r\nand gradually was it done. For lack of a better subject he chose Mr.\r\nRobert Worthington. Related, for Cynthia's delectation, several of Bob's\r\nescapades in his freshman year: silly escapades enough, but very bold\r\nand daring and original they sounded to Cynthia, who listened (if Mr.\r\nBrowne could have known it) with almost breathless interest, and forgot\r\nall about poor Susan talking to Mr. King. Did Mr. Worthington still\r\nwhile away his evenings stealing barber poles and being chased around\r\nCambridge by irate policemen? Mr. Browne laughed at the notion. O dear,\r\nno! seniors never descended to that. Had not Miss Wetherell heard the\r\nsong wherein seniors were designated as grave and reverend? Yes,\r\nMiss Wetherell had heard the song. She did not say where, or how. Mr.\r\nWorthington, said his classmate, had become very serious-minded this\r\nyear. Was captain of the base-ball team and already looking toward the\r\nstudy of law.\r\n\r\n“Study law!” exclaimed Cynthia, “I thought he would go into his father's\r\nmills.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know Bob very well?” asked Mr. Browne.\r\n\r\nShe admitted that she did not.\r\n\r\n“He's been away from Brampton a good deal, of course,” said Mr. Browne,\r\nwho seemed pleased by her admission. To do him justice, he would not\r\nundermine a classmate, although he had other rules of conduct which\r\nmight eventually require a little straightening out. “Worthy's a\r\nfirst-rate fellow, a little quick-tempered, perhaps, and inclined to go\r\nhis own way. He's got a good mind, and he's taken to using it lately. He\r\nhas come pretty near being suspended once or twice.”\r\n\r\nCynthia wanted to ask what “suspended” was. It sounded rather painful.\r\nBut at this instant there was the rattle of a latch key at the door, and\r\nMr. Merrill walked in.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” he said, spying Cynthia, “so you have got Cynthia to come\r\ndown and entertain the young men at last.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Susan, “we have got Cynthia to come down at last.”\r\n\r\nSusan did not go to Cynthia's room that night to chat, as usual, and Mr.\r\nMorton Browne's photograph was mysteriously removed from the prominent\r\nposition it had occupied. If Susan had carried out a plan which she\r\nconceived in a moment of folly of placing that photograph on Cynthia's\r\nbureau, there would undoubtedly have been a quarrel. Cynthia's\r\nown feelings--seeing that Mr. Browne had not dazzled her--were\r\nnot--enviable.\r\n\r\nBut she held her peace, which indeed was all she could do, and the\r\nnext time Mr. Browne called, though he took care to mention her name\r\nparticularly at the door, she would not go down to entertain him: though\r\nSusan implored and Jane appealed, she would not go down. Mr. Browne\r\ncalled several times again, with the same result. Cynthia was\r\ninexorable--she would have none of him. Then Susan forgave her. There\r\nwas no quarrel, indeed, but there was a reconciliation, which is the\r\nbest part of a quarrel. There were tears, of Susan's shedding; there was\r\na character-sketch of Mr. Browne, of Susan's drawing, and that gentleman\r\nflitted lightly out of Susan's life.\r\n\r\nSome ten days subsequent to this reconciliation Ellen, the parlor maid,\r\nbrought up a card to Cynthia's room. The card bore the name of Mr.\r\nRobert Worthington. Cynthia stared at it, and bent it in her fingers,\r\nwhile Ellen explained how the gentleman had begged that she might see\r\nhim. To tell the truth, Cynthia had wondered more than once why he had\r\nnot come before, and smiled when she thought of all the assurances of\r\nundying devotion she had heard in Washington. After all, she reflected,\r\nwhy should she not see him--once? He might give her news of Brampton\r\nand Coniston. Thus willingly deceiving herself, she told Ellen that she\r\nwould go down: much to the girl's delight, for Cynthia was a favorite in\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nAs she entered the parlor Mr. Worthington was standing in the window.\r\nWhen he turned and saw her he started to come forward in his old\r\nimpetuous way, and stopped and looked at her in surprise. She herself\r\ndid not grasp the reason for this.\r\n\r\n“Can it be possible,” he said, “can it be possible that this is my\r\nfriend from the country?” And he took her hand with the greatest\r\nformality, pressed it the least little bit, and released it. “How do you\r\ndo, Miss Wetherell? Do you remember me?”\r\n\r\n“How do you do--Bob,” she answered, laughing in spite of herself at his\r\nbanter. “You haven't changed, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“It was Mr. Worthington in Washington,” said he. “Now it is 'Bob' and\r\n'Miss Wetherell.' Rank patronage! How did you do it, Cynthia?”\r\n\r\n“You are like all men,” said Cynthia, “you look at the clothes, and not\r\nthe woman. They are not very fine clothes; but if they were much finer,\r\nthey wouldn't change me.”\r\n\r\n“Then it must be Miss Sadler.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Sadler would willingly change me--if she could,” said Cynthia, a\r\nlittle bitterly. “How did you find out I was at Miss Sadler's?”\r\n\r\n“Morton Browne told me yesterday,” said Bob. “I felt like punching his\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\n“What did he tell you?” she asked with some concern.\r\n\r\n“He said that you were here, visiting the Merrills, among other things,\r\nand said that you knew me.”\r\n\r\nThe “other things” Mr. Browne had said were interesting, but flippant.\r\nHe had seen Bob at a college club and declared that he had met a witch\r\nof a country girl at the Merrills. He couldn't make her out, because she\r\nhad refused to see him every time he called again. He had also repeated\r\nCynthia's remark about Bob's father not being quite the biggest man\r\nin his part of the country, and ventured the surmise that she was the\r\ndaughter of a rival mill owner.\r\n\r\n“Why didn't you let me know you were in Boston?” said Bob,\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n“Why should I?” asked Cynthia, and she could not resist adding, “Didn't\r\nyou find it out when you went to Brampton--to see me?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, getting fiery red, “the fact is--I didn't go to\r\nBrampton.”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad you were sensible enough to take my advice, though I suppose\r\nthat didn't make any difference. But--from the way you spoke, I should\r\nhave thought nothing could have kept you away.”\r\n\r\n“To tell you the truth,” said Bob, “I'd promised to visit a fellow named\r\nBroke in my class, who lives in New York. And I couldn't get out of it.\r\nHis sister, by the way, is in Miss Sadler's. I suppose you know her. But\r\nif I'd thought you'd see me, I should have gone to Brampton, anyway. You\r\nwere so down on me in Washington.”\r\n\r\n“It was very good of you to take the trouble to come to see me here.\r\nThere must be a great many girls in Boston you have to visit.”\r\n\r\nHe caught the little note of coolness in her voice. Cynthia was asking\r\nherself whether, if Mr. Browne had not seen fit to give a good report of\r\nher, he would have come at all. He would have come, certainly. It is to\r\nbe hoped that Bob Worthington's attitude up to this time toward Cynthia\r\nhas been sufficiently defined by his conversation and actions. There\r\nhad been nothing serious about it. But there can be no question that Mr.\r\nBrowne's openly expressed admiration had enhanced her value in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“There's no girl in Boston that I care a rap for,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I'm relieved to hear it,” said Cynthia, with feeling.\r\n\r\n“Are you really?”\r\n\r\n“Didn't you expect me to be, when you said it?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“You've learned more than one thing since you've been in the city,” he\r\nremarked, “I suppose there are a good many fellows who come here all the\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there are,” she said demurely.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he remarked, “you've changed a lot in three months. I always\r\nthought that, if you had a chance, there'd be no telling where you'd end\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn't sound very complimentary,” said Cynthia. She had, indeed,\r\nchanged. “In what terrible place do you think I'll end up?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you'll marry one of these Boston men.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she laughed, “that wouldn't be so terrible, would it?”\r\n\r\n“I believe you're engaged to one of 'em now,” he remarked, looking very\r\nhard at her.\r\n\r\n“If you believed that, I don't think you would say it,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“I can't make you out. You used to be so frank with me, and now you're\r\nnot at all so. Are you going to Coniston for the holidays?”\r\n\r\nHer face fell at the question.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bob,” she cried, surprising him utterly by a glimpse of the real\r\nCynthia, “I wish I were--I wish I were! But I don't dare to.”\r\n\r\n“Don't dare to?”\r\n\r\n“If I went, I should' never come back--never. I should stay with Uncle\r\nJethro. He's so lonesome up there, and I'm so lonesome down here,\r\nwithout him. And I promised him faithfully I'd stay a whole winter at\r\nschool in Boston.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” said Bob, in a strange voice as he leaned toward her, “do\r\nyou--do you care for him as much as all that?”\r\n\r\n“Care for him?” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“Care for--for Uncle Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I care for him,” she cried, her eyes flashing at the thought.\r\n“I love him better than anybody in the world. Certainly no one ever had\r\nbetter reason to care for a person. My father failed when he came to\r\nConiston--he was not meant for business, and Uncle Jethro took care of\r\nhim all his life, and paid his debts. And he has taken care of me and\r\ngiven me everything that a girl could wish. Very few people know what a\r\nfine character Uncle Jethro has,” continued Cynthia, carried away as she\r\nwas by the pent-up flood of feeling within her. “I know what he has done\r\nfor others, and I should love him for that even if he never had done\r\nanything for me.”\r\n\r\nBob was silent. He was, in the first place, utterly amazed at this\r\noutburst, revealing as it did a depth of passionate feeling in the girl\r\nwhich he had never suspected, and which thrilled him. It was unlike\r\nher, for she was usually so self-repressed; and, being unlike her,\r\naccentuated both sides of her character the more.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to say of the defence of Jethro Bass? Bob was not a\r\nyoung man who had pondered much over the problems of life, because these\r\nproblems had hitherto never touched him. But now he began to perceive,\r\ndimly, things that might become the elements of a tragedy, even as Mr.\r\nMerrill had perceived them some months before. Could a union endure\r\nbetween so delicate a creature as the girl before him and Jethro Bass?\r\nCould Cynthia ever go back to him again, and live with him happily,\r\nwithout seeing many things which before were hidden by reason of her\r\nyouth and innocence?\r\n\r\nBob had not been nearly four years at college without learning something\r\nof the world; and it had not needed the lecture from his father, which\r\nhe got upon leaving Washington, to inform him of Jethro's political\r\npractices. He had argued soundly with his father on that occasion,\r\nhaving the courage to ask Mr. Worthington in effect whether he did\r\nnot sanction his underlings to use the same tools as Jethro used.\r\nMr. Worthington was righteously angry, and declared that Jethro had\r\ninaugurated those practices in the state, and had to be fought with his\r\nown weapons. But Mr. Worthington had had the sense at that time not to\r\nmention Cynthia's name. He hoped and believed that that affair was not\r\nserious, and merely a boyish fancy--as indeed it was.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be said, however, that the lecture had not been without\r\nits effect upon Bob. Jethro Bass, after all, was--Jethro Bass. All his\r\nlife Bob had heard him familiarly and jokingly spoken of as the boss\r\nof the state, and had listened to the tales, current in all the country\r\ntowns, of how Jethro had outwitted this man or that. Some of them\r\nwere not refined tales. Jethro Bass as the boss of the state--with the\r\ntolerance with which the public in general regard politics--was one\r\nthing. Bob was willing to call him “Uncle Jethro,” admire his great\r\nstrength and shrewdness, and declare that the men he had outwitted had\r\nrichly deserved it. But Jethro Bass as the ward of Cynthia Wetherell was\r\nquite another thing.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that Cynthia had suddenly and inevitably become a lady.\r\nThat would not have mattered, for such as she would have borne Coniston\r\nand the life of Coniston cheerfully. But Bob reflected, as he walked\r\nback to his rooms in the dark through the snow-laden streets, that\r\nCynthia, young though she might be, possessed principles from which no\r\nlove would sway her a hair's breadth. How, indeed, was she to live with\r\nJethro once her eyes were opened?\r\n\r\nThe thought made him angry, but returned to him persistently during the\r\ndays that followed,--in the lecture room, in the gymnasium, in his own\r\nstudy, where he spent more time than formerly. By these tokens it will\r\nbe perceived that Bob, too, had changed a little. And the sight of\r\nCynthia in Mrs. Merrill's parlor had set him to thinking in a very\r\ndifferent manner than the sight of her in Washington had affected him.\r\nBob had managed to shift the subject from Jethro, not without an effort,\r\nthough he had done it in that merry, careless manner which was so\r\ncharacteristic of him. He had talked of many things,--his college life,\r\nhis friends,--and laughed at her questions about his freshman escapades.\r\nBut when at length, at twilight, he had risen to go, he had taken both\r\nher hands and looked down into her face with a very different expression\r\nthan she had seen him wear before--a much more serious expression, which\r\npuzzled her. It was not the look of a lover, nor yet that of a man who\r\nimagines himself in love. With either of these her instinct would have\r\ntold her how to deal. It was more the look of a friend, with much of the\r\nmasculine spirit of protection in it.\r\n\r\n“May I come to see you again?” he asked.\r\n\r\nGently she released her hands, and she did not answer at once. She\r\nwent to the window, and stared across the sloping street at the grilled\r\nrailing before the big house opposite, thinking. Her reason told her\r\nthat he should not come, but her spirit rebelled against that reason. It\r\nwas a pleasure to see him, so she freely admitted to herself. Why should\r\nshe not have that pleasure? If the truth be told, she had argued it all\r\nout before, when she had wondered whether he would come. Mrs. Merrill,\r\nshe thought, would not object to his coming. But--there was the question\r\nshe had meant to ask him.\r\n\r\n“Bob,” she said, turning to him, “Bob, would your father want you to\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark, and she could scarcely see his face. He hesitated,\r\nbut he did not attempt to evade the question.\r\n\r\n“No, he would not,” he answered. And added, with a good deal of force\r\nand dignity: “I am of age, and can choose my own friends. I am my own\r\nmaster. If he knew you as I knew you, he would look at the matter in a\r\ndifferent light.”\r\n\r\nCynthia felt that this was not quite true. She smiled a little sadly.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid you don't know me very well, Bob.” He was about to protest,\r\nbut she went on, bravely, “Is it because he has quarrelled with Uncle\r\nJethro?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bob. She was making it terribly hard for him, sparing indeed\r\nneither herself nor him.\r\n\r\n“If you come here to see me, it will cause a quarrel between you and\r\nyour father. I--I cannot do that.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing wrong in my seeing you,” said Bob, stoutly; “if he\r\ncares to quarrel with me for that, I cannot help it. If the people I\r\nchoose for my friends are good people, he has no right to an objection,\r\neven though he is my father.”\r\n\r\nCynthia had never come so near real admiration for him as at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“No, Bob, you must not come,” she said. “I will not have you quarrel\r\nwith him on my account.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will quarrel with him on my own account,” he had answered.\r\n“Good-by. You may expect me this day week.”\r\n\r\nHe went into the hall to put on his overcoat. Cynthia stood still on\r\nthe spot of the carpet where he had left her. He put his head in at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“This day week,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Bob, you must not come,” she answered. But the street door closed after\r\nhim as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n“You must not come.” Had Cynthia made the prohibition strong enough?\r\nOught she not to have said, “If you do come, I will not see you?” Her\r\nknowledge of the motives of the men and women in the greater world was\r\nlargely confined to that which she had gathered from novels--not trashy\r\nnovels, but those by standard authors of English life. And many another\r\ngirl of nineteen has taken a novel for a guide when she has been\r\nsuddenly confronted with the first great problem outside of her\r\nexperience. Somebody has declared that there are only seven plots in\r\nthe world. There are many parallels in English literature to Cynthia's\r\nposition,--so far as she was able to define that position,--the wealthy\r\nyoung peer, the parson's or physician's daughter, and the worldly,\r\ninexorable parents who had other plans.\r\n\r\nCynthia was, of course, foolish. She would not look ahead, yet there\r\nwas the mirage in the sky when she allowed herself to dream. It can\r\ntruthfully be said that she was not in love with Bob Worthington. She\r\nfelt, rather than knew, that if love came to her the feeling she had for\r\nJethro Bass--strong though that was--would be as nothing to it. The girl\r\nfelt the intensity of her nature, and shrank from it when her thoughts\r\nran that way, for it frightened her.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Merrill” she said, a few days later, when she found herself alone\r\nwith that lady, “you once told me you would have no objection if a\r\nfriend came to see me here.”\r\n\r\n“None whatever, my dear,” answered Mrs. Merrill. “I have asked you to\r\nhave your friends here.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill knew that a young man had called on Cynthia. The girls had\r\ndiscussed the event excitedly, had teased Cynthia about it; they had\r\ndiscovered, moreover, that the young man had not been a tiller of the\r\nsoil or a clerk in a country store. Ellen, with the enthusiasm of her\r\nrace, had painted him in glowing colors--but she had neglected to read\r\nthe name on his card.\r\n\r\n“Bob Worthington came to see me last week, and he wants to come again.\r\nHe lives in Brampton,” Cynthia explained, “and is at Harvard College.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill was decidedly surprised. She went on with her sewing,\r\nhowever, and did not betray the fact. She knew of Dudley Worthington as\r\none of the richest and most important men in his state; she had heard\r\nher husband speak of him often; but she had never meddled with politics\r\nand railroad affairs.\r\n\r\n“By all means let him come, Cynthia,” she replied.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Merrill got home that evening she spoke of the matter to him.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia is a strange character,” she said. “Sometimes I can't\r\nunderstand her--she seems so much older than our girls, Stephen. Think\r\nof her keeping this to herself for four days!”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill laughed, but he went off to a little writing room he had\r\nand sat for a long time looking into the glowing coals. Then he laughed\r\nagain. Mr. Merrill was a philosopher. After all, he could not forbid\r\nDudley Worthington's son coming to his house, nor did he wish to.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Cynthia wrote a letter and posted it. She found it a\r\nvery difficult letter to write, and almost as difficult to drop into the\r\nmail-box. She reflected that the holidays were close at hand, and then\r\nhe would go to Brampton and forget, even as he had forgotten before. And\r\nshe determined when Wednesday afternoon came around that she would take\r\na long walk in the direction of Brookline. Cynthia loved these walks,\r\nfor she sadly missed the country air,--and they had kept the color in\r\nher cheeks and the courage in her heart that winter. She had amazed\r\nthe Merrill girls by the distances she covered, and on more than one\r\noccasion she had trudged many miles to a spot from which there was a\r\nview of Blue Hills. They reminded her faintly of Coniston.\r\n\r\nWho can speak or write with any certainty of the feminine character, or\r\ndeclare what unexpected twists perversity and curiosity may give to it?\r\nWednesday afternoon came, and Cynthia did not go to Brookline. She put\r\non her coat, and took it off again. Would he dare to come in the face of\r\nthe mandate he had received? If he did come, she wouldn't see him. Ellen\r\nhad received her orders.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the doorbell rang, and shortly thereafter Ellen\r\nappeared, simpering and apologetic enough, with a card. She had taken\r\nthe trouble to read it this time. Cynthia was angry, or thought she was,\r\nand her cheeks were very red.\r\n\r\n“I told you to excuse me, Ellen. Why did you let him in?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Cynthia, darlin',” said Ellen, “if it was made of flint I was,\r\nwouldn't he bring the tears out of me with his wheedlin' an' coaxin'?\r\nAn' him such a fine young gintleman! And whin he took to commandin'\r\nlike, sure I couldn't say no to him at all at all. 'Take the card to\r\nher, Ellen,' he says--didn't he know me name!--'an' if she says she\r\nwon't see me, thin I won't trouble her more.' Thim were his words,\r\nMiss.”\r\n\r\nThere he was before the fire, his feet slightly apart and his hands in\r\nhis pockets, waiting for her. She got a glimpse of him standing thus, as\r\nshe came down the stairs. It was not the attitude of a culprit. Nor did\r\nhe bear the faintest resemblance to a culprit as he came up to her in\r\nthe doorway. The chief recollection she carried away of that moment\r\nwas that his teeth were very white and even when he smiled. He had the\r\nimpudence to smile. He had the impudence to seize one of her hands in\r\nhis, and to hold aloft a sheet of paper in the other.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” said he.\r\n\r\n“What do you thick it means?” retorted Cynthia, with dignity.\r\n\r\n“A summons to stay away,” said Bob, thereby more or less accurately\r\ndescribing it. “What would you have thought of me if I had not come?”\r\n\r\nCynthia was not prepared for any such question as this. She had meant\r\nto ask the questions herself. But she never lacked for words to protect\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what I think of you for coming, Bob, for insisting upon\r\nseeing me as you did,” she said, remembering with shame Ellen's account\r\nof that proceeding. “It was very unkind and very thoughtless of you.”\r\n\r\n“Unkind?” Thus she succeeded in putting him on the defensive.\r\n\r\n“Yes, unkind, because I know it is best for you not to come to see me,\r\nand you know it, and yet you will not help me when I try to do what is\r\nright. I shall be blamed for these visits,” she said. The young ladies\r\nin the novels always were. But it was a serious matter for poor Cynthia,\r\nand her voice trembled a little. Her troubles seemed very real.\r\n\r\n“Who will blame you?” asked Bob, though he knew well enough. Then he\r\nadded, seeing that she did not answer: “I don't at all agree with you\r\nthat it is best for me not to see you. I know of nobody in the world it\r\ndoes me more good to see than yourself. Let's sit down and talk it all\r\nover,” he said, for she still remained standing uncompromisingly by the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion of a smile came over Cynthia's face. She remembered how\r\nEllen had been wheedled. Her instinct told her that now was the time to\r\nmake a stand or never.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't do any good, Bob,” she replied, shaking her head; “we\r\ntalked it all over last week.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said he, “we only touched upon a few points last week. We\r\nought to thrash it out. Various aspects of the matter have occurred to\r\nme which I ought to call to your attention.”\r\n\r\nHe could not avoid this bantering tone, but she saw that he was very\r\nmuch in earnest too. He realized the necessity of winning; likewise, and\r\nhe had got in and meant to stay.\r\n\r\n“I don't want to argue,” said Cynthia. “I've thought it all out.”\r\n\r\n“So have I,” said Bob. “I haven't thought of anything else, to speak\r\nof. And by the way,” he declared, shaking the envelope, “I never got a\r\ncolder and more formal letter in my life. You must have taken it from\r\none of Miss Sadler's copy books.”\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry I haven't been able to equal the warmth of your other\r\ncorrespondents,” said Cynthia, smiling at the mention of Miss Sadler.\r\n\r\n“You've got a good many degrees yet to go,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“I have no idea of doing so,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nIf Cynthia had lured him there, and had carefully thought out a plan of\r\nfanning his admiration into a flame, she could not have done better\r\nthan to stand obstinately by the door. Nothing appeals to a man like\r\nresistance--resistance for a principle appealed to Bob, although he did\r\nnot care a fig about that particular principle. In his former dealings\r\nwith young women--and they had not been few--the son of Dudley\r\nWorthington had encountered no resistance worth the mentioning. He\r\nlooked at the girl before him, and his blood leaped at the thought of a\r\nconquest over her. She was often demure, but behind that demureness was\r\nfirmness: she was mistress of herself, and yet possessed a marvellous\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Cynthia, “don't you think you had better go?”\r\n\r\nGo! He laughed outright. Never! He would sit down under that fortress,\r\nand some day he meant to scale the walls. Like John Paul Jones, he\r\nhad not yet begun to fight. But he did not sit down just yet, because\r\nCynthia remained standing.\r\n\r\n“I'm here now,” he said, “what's the good of going away? I might as well\r\nstay the rest of the afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“You will find a photograph album on the table,” said Cynthia, “with\r\npictures of all the Merrill family and their friends and relations.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the threat this remark conveyed, he could not help laughing\r\nat it. Mrs. Merrill in her sitting room heard the laugh, and felt that\r\nshe would like Bob Worthington.\r\n\r\n“It's a heavy album, Cynthia,” he said; “perhaps you would hold up one\r\nside of it.”\r\n\r\nIt was Cynthia's turn to laugh. She could not decide whether he were a\r\nman or a boy. Sometimes, she had to admit, he was very much of a man.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Upstairs, of course,” she answered.\r\n\r\nThis was really alarming. But fate thrust a final weapon into his hands.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said he, “I'll look at the album. What time does Mr.\r\nMerrill get home?”\r\n\r\n“About six,” answered Cynthia. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“When he comes,” said Bob, “I shall put on my most disconsolate\r\nexpression. He'll ask me what I'm doing, and I'll tell him you went\r\nupstairs at half-past four and haven't come down. He'll sympathize, I'll\r\nbet anything.”\r\n\r\nWhether Bob were really capable of doing this, Cynthia could not tell.\r\nShe believed he was. Perhaps she really did not intend to go upstairs\r\njust then. To his intense relief she seated herself on a straight-backed\r\nchair near the door, although she had the air of being about to get up\r\nagain at any minute. It was not a surrender, not at all--but a parley,\r\nat least.\r\n\r\n“I really want to talk to you seriously, Bob,” she said, and her voice\r\nwas serious. “I like you very much--I always have--and I want you\r\nto listen seriously. All of us have friends. Some people--you, for\r\ninstance--have a great many. We have but one father.” Her voice failed\r\na little at the word. “No friend can ever be the same to you as your\r\nfather, and no friendship can make up what his displeasure will cost\r\nyou. I do not mean to say that I shan't always be your friend, for I\r\nshall be.”\r\n\r\nYoung men seldom arrive at maturity by gradual steps--something sets\r\nthem thinking, a week passes, and suddenly the world has a different\r\naspect. Bob had thought much of his father during that week, and had\r\nconsidered their relationship very carefully. He had a few precious\r\nmemories of his mother before she had been laid to rest under that\r\nhideous and pretentious monument in the Brampton hill cemetery. How\r\nunlike her was that monument! Even as a young boy, when on occasions he\r\nhad wandered into the cemetery, he used to stand before it with a lump\r\nin his throat and bitter resentment in his heart, and once he had shaken\r\nhis fist at it. He had grown up out of sympathy with his father, but he\r\nhad never until now began to analyze the reasons for it. His father had\r\ngiven him everything except that communion of which Cynthia spoke so\r\nfeelingly. Mr. Worthington had acted according to his lights: of all the\r\npeople in the world he thought first of his son. But his thoughts and\r\ncare had been alone of what the son would be to the world: how that son\r\nwould carry on the wealth and greatness of Isaac D. Worthington.\r\n\r\nBob had known this before, but it had had no such significance for him\r\nthen as now. He was by no means lacking in shrewdness, and as he had\r\ngrown older he had perceived clearly enough Mr. Worthington's reasons\r\nfor throwing him socially with the Duncans. Mr. Worthington had never\r\nbeen a plain-spoken man, but he had as much as told his son that it was\r\ndecreed that he should marry the heiress of the state. There were other\r\nplans connected with this. Mr. Worthington meant that his son should\r\neventually own the state itself, for he saw that the man who controlled\r\nthe highways of a state could snap his fingers at governor and council\r\nand legislature and judiciary: could, indeed, do more--could own them\r\neven more completely than Jethro Bass now owned them, and without\r\neffort. The dividends would do the work: would canvass the counties and\r\npersuade this man and that with sufficient eloquence. By such tokens\r\nit will be seen that Isaac D. Worthington is destined to become great,\r\nthough the greatness will be akin to that possessed by those gentlemen\r\nwho in past ages had built castles across the highway between Venice and\r\nthe North Sea. All this was in store for Bob Worthington, if he could\r\nonly be brought to see it. These things would be given him, if he would\r\nbut confine his worship to the god of wealth.\r\n\r\nWe are running ahead, however, of Bob's reflections in Mr. Merrill's\r\nparlor in Mount Vernon Street, and the ceremony of showing him the\r\ncities of his world from Brampton hill was yet to be gone through. Bob\r\nknew his father's plans only in a general way, but in the past week he\r\nhad come to know his father with a fair amount of thoroughness. If Isaac\r\nD. Worthington had but chosen a worldly wife, he might have had a more\r\nworldly son. As it was, Bob's thoughts were a little bitter when Cynthia\r\nspoke of his father, and he tried to think instead what his mother\r\nwould have him do. He could not, indeed, speak of Mr. Worthington's\r\nshortcomings as he understood them, but he answered Cynthia vigorously\r\nenough--even if his words were not as serious as she desired.\r\n\r\n“I tell you I am old enough to judge for myself, Cynthia,” said he, “and\r\nI intend to judge for myself. I don't pretend to be a paragon of virtue,\r\nbut I have a kind of a conscience which tells me when I am doing wrong,\r\nif I listen to it. I have not always listened to it. It tells me I'm\r\ndoing right now, and I mean to listen to it.”\r\n\r\nCynthia could not but think there was very little self-denial attached\r\nto this. Men are not given largely to self-denial.\r\n\r\n“It is easy enough to listen to your conscience when you think it impels\r\nyou to do that which you want to do, Bob,” she answered, laughing at his\r\nargument in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n“Are you wicked?” he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Why, no, I don't think I am,” said Cynthia, taken aback. But she\r\ncorrected herself swiftly, perceiving his bent. “I should be doing wrong\r\nto let you come here.”\r\n\r\nHe ignored the qualification.\r\n\r\n“Are you vain and frivolous?”\r\n\r\nShe remembered that she had looked in the glass before she had come down\r\nto him, and bit her lip.\r\n\r\n“Are you given over to idle pursuits, to leading young men from their\r\noccupations and duties?”\r\n\r\n“If you've come here to recite the Blue Laws,” said she, laughing again,\r\n“I have something better to do than to listen to them.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he cried, “I'll tell you what you are. I'll draw your\r\ncharacter for you, and then, if you can give me one good reason why I\r\nshould not associate with you, I'll go away and never come back.”\r\n\r\n“That's all very well,” said Cynthia, “but suppose I don't admit your\r\nqualifications for drawing my character. And I don't admit them, not for\r\na minute.”\r\n\r\n“I will draw it,” said he, standing up in front of her. “Oh, confound\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nThis exclamation, astonishing and out of place as it was, was caused\r\nby a ring at the doorbell. The ring was followed by a whispering and\r\ngiggling in the hall, and then by the entrance of the Misses Merrill\r\ninto the parlor. Curiosity had been too strong for them. Susan was\r\nhuman, and here was the opportunity for a little revenge. In justice to\r\nher, she meant the revenge to be very slight.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cynthia, you should have come to the concert,” she said; “it was\r\nfine, wasn't it, Jane? Is this Mr. Worthington? How do you do. I'm Miss\r\nSusan Merrill, and this is Miss Jane Merrill.” Susan only intended\r\nto stay a minute, but how was Bob to know that? She was tempted into\r\nstaying longer. Bob lighted the gas, and she inspected him and approved.\r\nHer approval increased when he began to talk to her in his bantering\r\nway, as if he had known her always. Then, when she was fully intending\r\nto go, he rose to take his leave.\r\n\r\n“I'm awfully glad to have met you at last,” he said to Susan, “I've\r\nheard so much about you.” His leave-taking of Jane was less effusive,\r\nand then he turned to Cynthia and took her hand. “I'm going to Brampton\r\non Friday,” he said, “for the holidays. I wish you were going.”\r\n\r\n“We couldn't think of letting her go, Mr. Worthington,” cried Susan, for\r\nthe thought of the hills had made Cynthia incapable of answering. “We're\r\nonly to have her for one short winter, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” said Mr. Worthington, gravely. “I'll see old Ephraim,\r\nand tell him you're well, and what a marvel of learning, you've become.\r\nAnd--and I'll go to Coniston if that will please you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, Bob, you mustn't do anything of the kind,” answered Cynthia,\r\ntrying to keep back the tears. “I--I write to Uncle Jethro very often.\r\nGood-by. I hope you will enjoy your holidays.”\r\n\r\n“I'm coming to see you the minute I get back and tell you all about\r\neverybody,” said he.\r\n\r\nHow was she to forbid him to come before Susan and Jane! She could only\r\nbe silent.\r\n\r\n“Do come, Mr. Worthington,” said Susan, warmly, wondering at Cynthia's\r\ncoldness and, indeed, misinterpreting it. “I am sure she will be glad to\r\nsee you. And we shall always make you welcome, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was out of the door, Susan became very repentant, and\r\nslipped her hand about Cynthia's waist.\r\n\r\n“We shouldn't have come in at all if we had known he would go so soon,\r\nindeed we shouldn't, Cynthia.” And seeing that Cynthia was still silent,\r\nshe added: “I wouldn't do such a mean thing, Cynthia, I really wouldn't.\r\nWon't you believe me and forgive me?”\r\n\r\nCynthia scarcely heard her at first. She was thinking of Coniston\r\nmountain, and how the sun had just set behind it. The mountain would be\r\nultramarine against the white fields, and the snow on the hill pastures\r\nto the east stained red as with wine. What would she not have given to\r\nbe going back to-morrow--yes, with Bob. She confessed--though startled\r\nby the very boldness of the thought--that she would like to be going\r\nthere with Bob. Susan's appeal brought her back to Boston and the\r\ngas-lit parlor.\r\n\r\n“Forgive you, Susan! There's nothing to forgive. I wanted him to go.”\r\n\r\n“You wanted him to go?” repeated Susan, amazed. She may be pardoned if\r\nshe did not believe this, but a glance at Cynthia's face scarcely left a\r\nroom for doubt. “Cynthia Wetherell, you're the strangest girl I've ever\r\nknown in all my life. If I had a--a friend” (Susan had another word on\r\nher tongue) “if I had such a friend as Mr. Worthington, I shouldn't be\r\nin a hurry to let him leave me. Of course,” she added, “I shouldn't let\r\nhim know it.”\r\n\r\nCynthia's heart was very heavy during the next few days, heavier by far\r\nthan her friends in Mount Vernon Street imagined. They had grown to love\r\nher almost as one of themselves, and because of the sympathy which comes\r\nof such love they guessed that her thoughts would be turning homeward\r\nat Christmastide. At school she had listened, perforce, to the festival\r\nplans of thirty girls of her own age; to accounts of the probable\r\npresents they were to receive, the cost of some of which would support\r\na family in Coniston for several months; to arrangements for visits,\r\nduring which there were to be theatre-parties and dances and other\r\ngaieties. Cynthia could not help wondering, as she listened in silence\r\nto this talk, whether Uncle Jethro had done wisely in sending her to\r\nMiss Sadler's; whether she would not have been far happier if she had\r\nnever known about such things.\r\n\r\nThen came the last day of school, which began with leave-takings and\r\nembraces. There were not many who embraced Cynthia, though, had she\r\nknown it, this was largely her own fault. Poor Cynthia! how was she to\r\nknow it? Many more of them than she imagined would have liked to embrace\r\nher had they believed that the embrace would be returned. Secretly they\r\nhad grown to admire this strange, dark girl, who was too proud to bend\r\nfor the good opinion of any one--even of Miss Sally Broke. Once during\r\nthe term Cynthia had held some of them--in the hollow of her hand, and\r\nhad incurred the severe displeasure of Miss Sadler by refusing to tell\r\nwhat she knew of certain mischief-makers.\r\n\r\nNow, Miss Sadler was going about among them in the school parlor saying\r\ngood-by, sending particular remembrance to such of the fathers and\r\nmothers as she thought worthy of that honor; kissing some, shaking,\r\nhands with all. It was then that a dramatic incident occurred--dramatic\r\nfor a girls' school, at least. Cynthia deliberately turned her back on\r\nMiss Sadler and looked out of the window. The chatter in the room was\r\nhushed, and for a moment a dangerous wrath flamed in Miss Sadler's eyes.\r\nThen she passed on with a smile, to send most particular messages to the\r\nmother of Miss Isabel Burrage.\r\n\r\nSome few moments afterward Cynthia felt a touch on her arm, and turned\r\nto find herself confronted by Miss Sally Broke. Unfortunately there is\r\nnot much room for Miss Broke in this story, although she may appear in\r\nanother one yet to be written. She was extremely good-looking, with real\r\ngolden hair and mischievous blue eyes. She was, in brief, the leader of\r\nMiss Sadler's school.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” she said, “I was rude to you when you first came here, and\r\nI'm sorry for it. I want to beg your pardon.” And she held out her hand.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's suspense for those watching to see if Cynthia would\r\ntake it. She did take it.\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry, too,” said Cynthia, simply, “I couldn't see what I'd done to\r\noffend you. Perhaps you'll explain now.”\r\n\r\nMiss Broke blushed violently, and for an instant looked decidedly\r\nuncomfortable. Then she burst into laughter,--merry, irresistible\r\nlaughter that carried all before it.\r\n\r\n“I was a snob, that's all,” said she, “just a plain, low down snob. You\r\ndon't understand what that means, because you're not one.” (Cynthia did\r\nunderstand, ) “But I like you, and I want you to be my friend. Perhaps\r\nwhen I get to know you better, you will come home with me sometime for a\r\nvisit.”\r\n\r\nGo home with her for a visit to that house in Washington Square with the\r\npicture gallery!\r\n\r\n“I want to say that I'd give my head to have been able to turn my back\r\non Miss Sadler as you did,” continued Miss Broke; “if you ever want a\r\nfriend, remember Sally Broke.”\r\n\r\nSome of Cynthia's trouble, at least, was mitigated by this episode; and\r\nMiss Broke having led the way, Miss Broke's followers came shyly, one by\r\none, with proffers of friendship. To the good-hearted Merrill girls the\r\nwalk home that day was a kind of a triumphal march, a victory over Miss\r\nSadler and a vindication of their friend. Mrs. Merrill, when she heard\r\nof it, could not find it in her heart to reprove Cynthia. Miss Sadler\r\nhad got her just deserts. But Miss Sadler was not a person who was\r\nlikely to forget such an incident. Indeed, Mrs. Merrill half expected to\r\nreceive a note before the holidays ended that Cynthia's presence was no\r\nlonger desired at the school. No such note came, however.\r\n\r\nIf one had to be away from home on Christmas, there could surely be no\r\nbetter place to spend that day than in the Merrill household. Cynthia\r\nremembers still, when that blessed season comes around, how each member\r\nof the family vied with the others to make her happy; how they showered\r\npresents on her, and how they strove to include her in the laughter and\r\njokes at the big family dinner. Mr. Merrill's brother was there with\r\nhis wife, and Mrs. Merrill's aunt and her husband, and two broods of\r\ncousins. It may be well to mention that the Merrill relations, like\r\nSally Broke, had overcome their dislike for Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThere were eatables from Coniston on that board. A turkey sent by\r\nJethro for which, Mr. Merrill declared, the table would have to be\r\nstrengthened; a saddle of venison--Lem Hallowell having shot a deer on\r\nthe mountain two Sundays before; and mince-meat made by Amanda Hatch\r\nherself. Other presents had come to Cynthia from the hills: a gorgeous\r\ncopy of Mr. Longfellow's poems from Cousin Ephraim, and a gold locket\r\nfrom Uncle Jethro. This locket was the precise counterpart (had she but\r\nknown it) of a silver one bought at Mr. Judson's shop many years before,\r\nthough the inscription “Cynthy, from Uncle Jethro,” was within. Into\r\nthe other side exactly fitted that daguerreotype of her mother which her\r\nfather had given her when he died. The locket had a gold chain with\r\na clasp, and Cynthia wore it hidden beneath her gown-too intimate a\r\npossession to be shown.\r\n\r\nThere was still another and very mysterious present, this being a huge\r\nbox of roses, addressed to Miss Cynthia Wetherell, which was delivered\r\non Christmas morning. If there had been a card, Susan Merrill would\r\ncertainly have found it. There was no card. There was much pretended\r\nspeculation on the part of the Merrill girls as to the sender, sly\r\nreference to Cynthia's heightened color, and several attempts to pin on\r\nher dress a bunch of the flowers, and Susan declared that one of them\r\nwould look stunning in her hair. They were put on the dining-room table\r\nin the centre of the wreath of holly, and under the mistletoe which hung\r\nfrom the chandelier. Whether Cynthia surreptitiously stole one has never\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nSo Christmas came and went: not altogether unhappily, deferring for a\r\nday at least the knotty problems of life. Although Cynthia accepted the\r\npresent of the roses with such magnificent unconcern, and would not\r\nmake so much as a guess as to who sent them, Mr. Robert Worthington was\r\nfrequently in her thoughts. He had declared his intention of coming\r\nto Mount Vernon Street as soon as the holidays ended, and had been\r\ncordially invited by Susan to do so. Cynthia took the trouble to procure\r\na Harvard catalogue from the library, and discovered that he had many\r\nholidays yet to spend. She determined to write another letter, which he\r\nwould find in his rooms when he returned. Just what terrible prohibitory\r\nterms she was to employ in that letter Cynthia could not decide in a\r\nmoment, nor yet in a day, or a week. She went so far as to make several\r\ndrafts, some of which she destroyed for the fault of leniency, and\r\nothers for that of severity. What was she to say to him? She had\r\nexpended her arguments to no avail. She could wound him, indeed, and\r\nat length made up her mind that this was the only resource left her,\r\nalthough she would thereby wound herself more deeply. When she had\r\narrived at this decision, there remained still more than a week in which\r\nto compose the letter.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after New Year's, when the family were assembled\r\naround the breakfast table, Mrs. Merrill remarked that her husband was\r\nneglecting a custom which had been his for many years.\r\n\r\n“Didn't the newspaper come, Stephen?” she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had read it.\r\n\r\n“Read it!” repeated his wife, in surprise, “you haven't been down long\r\nenough to read a column.”\r\n\r\n“It was full of trash,” said Mr. Merrill, lightly, and began on his\r\nusual jokes with the girls. But Mrs. Merrill was troubled. She thought\r\nhis jokes not as hearty as they were wont to be, and disquieting\r\nsurmises of business worries filled her mind. The fact that he beckoned\r\nher into his writing room as soon as breakfast was over did not tend\r\nto allay her suspicions. He closed and locked the door after her, and\r\ntaking the paper from a drawer in his desk bade her read a certain\r\narticle in it.\r\n\r\nThe article was an arraignment of Jethro Bass--and a terrible\r\narraignment indeed. Step by step it traced his career from the\r\nbeginning, showing first of all how he had debauched his own town of\r\nConiston; how, enlarging on the same methods, he had gradually extended\r\nhis grip over the county and finally over the state; how he had bought\r\nand sold men for his own power and profit, deceived those who had\r\ntrusted in him, corrupted governors and legislators, congressmen\r\nand senators, and even justices of the courts: how he had trafficked\r\nruthlessly in the enterprises of the people. Instance upon instance was\r\ngiven, and men of high prominence from whom he had received bribes were\r\nnamed, not the least important of these being the Honorable Alva Hopkins\r\nof Gosport.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill looked up from the paper in dismay.\r\n\r\n“It's copied from the Newcastle Guardian,” she said, for lack of\r\nimmediate power to comment. “Isn't the Guardian the chief paper in that\r\nstate?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Worthington's bought it, and he instigated the article, of course.\r\nI've been afraid of this for a long time, Carry,” said Mr. Merrill,\r\npacing up and down. “There's a bigger fight than they've ever had coming\r\non up there, and this is the first gun. Worthington, with Duncan behind\r\nhim, is trying to get possession of and consolidate all the railroads in\r\nthe western part of that state. If he succeeds, it will mean the end of\r\nJethro's power. But he won't succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Stephen,” said his wife, “do you mean to say that Jethro Bass will try\r\nto defeat this consolidation simply to keep his power?”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear,” answered Mr. Merrill, still pacing, “two wrongs don't\r\nmake a right, I admit. I've known these things a long time, and I've\r\nthought about them a good deal. But I've had to run along with the tide,\r\nor give place to another man who would; and--and starve.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill's eyes slowly filled with tears.\r\n\r\n“Stephen,” she began, “do you mean to say--?” There she stopped, utterly\r\nunable to speak. He ceased his pacing and sat down beside her and took\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear, I mean to say I've submitted to these things. God knows\r\nwhether I've been right or wrong, but I have. I've often thought I'd\r\nbe happier if I resigned my office as president of my road and became\r\na clerk in a store. I don't attempt to excuse myself, Carry, but my sin\r\nhas been in holding on to my post. As long as I remain president I have\r\nto cope with things as I find them.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill spoke thickly, for the sight of his wife's tears wrung his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“Stephen,” she said, “when we were first married and you were a district\r\nsuperintendent, you used to tell me everything.”\r\n\r\nStephen Merrill was a man, and a good man, as men go. How was he to tell\r\nher the degrees by which he had been led into his present situation?\r\nHow was he to explain that these degrees had been so gradual that his\r\nconscience had had but a passing wrench here and there? Politics being\r\nwhat they were, progress and protection had to be obtained in accordance\r\nwith them, and there was a duty to the holders of bonds and stocks.\r\n\r\nHis wife had a question on her lips, a question for which she had to\r\nsummon all her courage. She chose that form for it which would hurt him\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington is going to try to change these things?”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill roused himself at the words, and his eyes flashed. He became\r\na different man.\r\n\r\n“Change them!” he cried bitterly, “change them for the worse, if he can.\r\nHe will try to wrest the power from Jethro Bass. I don't defend him.\r\nI don't defend myself. But I like Jethro Bass. I won't deny it. He's\r\nhuman, and I like him, and whatever they say about him I know that he's\r\nbeen a true friend to me. And I tell you as I hope for happiness here\r\nand hereafter, that if Worthington succeeds in what he is trying to\r\ndo, if the railroads win in this fight, there will be no mercy for\r\nthe people of that state. I'm a railroad man myself, though I have no\r\ninterest in this affair. My turn may come later. Will come later, I\r\nsuppose. Isaac D. Worthington has a very little heart or soul or mercy\r\nhimself; but the corporation which he means to set up will have none at\r\nall. It will grind the people and debase them and clog their progress a\r\nhundred times more than Jethro Bass has done. Mark my words, Carry. I'm\r\nrunning ahead of the times a little, but I can see it all as clearly as\r\nif it existed now.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill went about her duties that morning with a heavy heart, and\r\nmore than once she paused to wipe away a tear that would have fallen\r\non the linen she was sorting. At eleven o'clock the doorbell rang, and\r\nEllen appeared at the entrance to the linen closet with a card in her\r\nhand. Mrs. Merrill looked at it with a flurry of surprise. It read:--\r\n\r\n           MISS LUCRETIA PENNIMAN\r\n\r\n            The Woman's Hour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIt was certainly affinity that led Miss Lucretia to choose the rosewood\r\nsofa of a bygone age, which was covered with horsehair. Miss Lucretia's\r\nfeatures seemed to be constructed on a larger and more generous\r\nprinciple than those of women are nowadays. Her face was longer. With\r\nher curls and her bonnet and her bombazine,--which she wore in all\r\nseasons,--she was in complete harmony with the sofa. She had thrown\r\naside the storm cloak which had become so familiar to pedestrians in\r\ncertain parts of Boston.\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Penniman,” said Mrs. Merrill, “I am delighted and honored.\r\nI scarcely hoped for such a pleasure. I have so long admired you and\r\nyour work, and I have heard Cynthia speak of you so kindly.”\r\n\r\n“It is very good of you to say so, Mrs. Merrill” answered Miss Lucretia,\r\nin her full, deep voice. It was by no means an unpleasant voice. She\r\nsettled herself, though she sat quite upright, in the geometrical centre\r\nof the horsehair sofa, and cleared her throat. “To be quite honest\r\nwith you, Mrs. Merrill,” she continued, “I came upon particular errand,\r\nthough I believe it would not be a perversion of the truth if I were\r\nto add that I have had for a month past every intention of paying you a\r\nfriendly call.”\r\n\r\nGood Mrs. Merrill's breath was a little taken away by this extremely\r\nscrupulous speech. She also began to feel a misgiving about the cause of\r\nthe visit, but she managed to say something polite in reply.\r\n\r\n“I have come about Cynthia,” announced Miss Lucretia, without further\r\npreliminaries.\r\n\r\n“About Cynthia?” faltered Mrs. Merrill.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia opened a reticule at her waist and drew forth a newspaper\r\nclipping, which she unfolded and handed to Mrs. Merrill.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen this?” she demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill took it, although she guessed very well what it was,\r\nglanced at it with a shudder, and handed it back.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have read it,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I have come to ask you, Mrs. Merrill” said Miss Lucretia, “if it is\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\nHere was a question, indeed, for the poor lady to answer! But Mrs.\r\nMerrill was no coward.\r\n\r\n“It is partly true, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Partly?” said Miss Lucretia, sharply.\r\n\r\n“Yes, partly,” said Mrs. Merrill, rousing herself for the trial; “I have\r\nnever yet seen a newspaper article which was wholly true.”\r\n\r\n“That is because newspapers are not edited by women,” observed Miss\r\nLucretia. “What I wish you to tell me, Mrs. Merrill, is this: how much\r\nof that article is true, and how much of it is false?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Miss Penniman,” replied Mrs. Merrill, with spirit, “I don't see\r\nwhy you should expect me to know.”\r\n\r\n“A woman should take an intelligent interest in her husband's affairs,\r\nMrs. Merrill. I have long advocated it as an entering wedge.”\r\n\r\n“An entering wedge!” exclaimed Mrs. Merrill, who had never read a page\r\nof the Woman's Hour.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Your husband is the president of a railroad, I believe, which is\r\nlargely in that state. I should like to ask him whether these statements\r\nare true in the main. Whether this Jethro Bass is the kind of man they\r\ndeclare him to be.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill was in a worse quandary than ever. Her own spirits were\r\nnone too good, and Miss Lucretia's eye, in its search for truth, seemed\r\nto pierce into her very soul. There was no evading that eye. But Mrs.\r\nMerrill did what few people would have had the courage or good sense to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n“That is a political article, Miss Penniman,” she said, “inspired by\r\na bitter enemy of Jethro Bass, Mr. Worthington, who has bought the\r\nnewspaper from which it was copied. For that reason, I was right in\r\nsaying that it is partly true. You nor I, Miss Penniman, must not be\r\nthe judges of any man or woman, for we know nothing of their problems or\r\ntemptations. God will judge them. We can only say that they have acted\r\nrightly or wrongly according to the light that is in us. You will find\r\nit difficult to get a judgment of Jethro Bass that is not a partisan\r\njudgment, and yet I believe that that article is in the main a history\r\nof the life of Jethro Bass. A partisan history, but still a history. He\r\nhas unquestionably committed many of the acts of which he is accused.”\r\n\r\nHere was talk to make the author of the “Hymn to Coniston” sit up, if\r\nshe hadn't been sitting up already.\r\n\r\n“And don't you condemn him for those acts?” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Mrs. Merrill, thinking of her own husband. Yesterday she\r\nwould certainly have condemned. Jethro Bass. But now! “I do not condemn\r\nanybody, Miss Penniman.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia thought this extraordinary, to say the least.\r\n\r\n“I will put the question in another way, Mrs. Merrill,” said she. “Do\r\nyou think this Jethro Bass a proper guardian for Cynthia Wetherell?”\r\n\r\nTo her amazement Mrs. Merrill did not give her an instantaneous answer\r\nto this question. Mrs. Merrill was thinking of Jethro's love for the\r\ngirl, manifold evidences of which she had seen, and her heart was filled\r\nwith a melting pity. It was such a love, Mrs. Merrill knew, as is not\r\ngiven to many here below. And there was Cynthia's love for him. Mrs.\r\nMerrill had suffered that morning thinking of this tragedy also.\r\n\r\n“I do not think he is a proper guardian for her, Miss Penniman.”\r\n\r\nIt was then that the tears came to Mrs. Merrill's eyes for there is a\r\nlimit to all human endurance. The sight of these caused a remarkable\r\nchange in Miss Lucretia, and she leaned forward and seized Mrs.\r\nMerrill's arm.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she cried, “my dear, what are we to do? Cynthia can't go\r\nback to that man. She loves him, I know, she loves him as few girls are\r\ncapable of loving. But when she, finds out what he is! When she finds\r\nout how he got the money to support her father!” Miss Lucretia fumbled\r\nin her reticule and drew forth a handkerchief and brushed her own\r\neyes--eyes which a moment ago were so piercing. “I have seen many young\r\nwomen,” she continued; “but I have known very few who were made of as\r\nfine a fibre and who have such principles as Cynthia Wetherell.”\r\n\r\n“That is very true,” assented Mrs. Merrill too much cast down to be\r\namazed by this revelation of Miss Lucretia's weakness.\r\n\r\n“But what are we to do?” insisted that lady; “who is to tell her what he\r\nis? How is it to be kept from her, indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill, “there will be more, articles. Mr. Merrill\r\nsays so. It seems there is to be a great political struggle in that\r\nstate.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” said Miss Lucretia, sadly. “And whoever tells the girl will\r\nforfeit her friendship. I--I am very fond of her,” and here she applied\r\nagain to the reticule.\r\n\r\n“Whom would she believe?” asked Mrs. Merrill, whose estimation of Miss\r\nLucretia was increasing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” agreed Miss Lucretia. “But she must hear about it\r\nsometime.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn't it be better to let her hear?” suggested Mrs. Merrill; “we\r\ncannot very well soften that shock: I talked the matter over a little\r\nwith Mr. Merrill, and he thinks that we must take time over it, Miss\r\nPenniman. Whatever we do, we must not act hastily.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Miss Lucretia, “as I said, I am very fond of the girl, and\r\nI am willing to do my duty, whatever it may be. And I also wished\r\nto say, Mrs. Merrill, that I have thought about another matter very\r\ncarefully. I am willing to provide for the girl. I am getting too old to\r\nlive alone. I am getting too old, indeed, to do my work properly, as I\r\nused to do it. I should like to have her to live with me.”\r\n\r\n“She has become as one of my own daughters,” said Mrs. Merrill. Yet she\r\nknew that this offer of Miss Lucretia's was not one to be lightly set\r\naside, and that it might eventually be the best solution of the problem.\r\nAfter some further earnest discussion it was agreed between them that\r\nthe matter was, if possible, to be kept from Cynthia for the present,\r\nand when Miss Lucretia departed Mrs. Merrill promised her an early\r\nreturn of her call.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill had another talk with her husband, which lasted far into\r\nthe night. This talk was about Cynthia alone, and the sorrow which\r\nthreatened her. These good people knew that it would be no light thing\r\nto break the faith of such as she, and they made her troubles their own.\r\n\r\nCynthia little guessed as she exchanged raillery with Mr. Merrill the\r\nnext morning that he had risen fifteen minutes earlier than usual to\r\nsearch his newspaper through. He would read no more at breakfast, so he\r\ndeclared in answer to his daughters' comments; it was a bad habit which\r\ndid not agree with his digestion. It was something new for Mr. Merrill\r\nto have trouble with his digestion.\r\n\r\nThere was another and scarcely less serious phase of the situation which\r\nMr. and Mrs. Merrill had yet to discuss between them--a phase of which\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman knew nothing.\r\n\r\nThe day before Miss Sadler's school was to reopen nearly a week before\r\nthe Harvard term was to commence--a raging, wet snowstorm came charging\r\nin from the Atlantic. Snow had no terrors for a Coniston person, and\r\nCynthia had been for her walk. Returning about five o'clock, she was\r\nsurprised to have the door opened for her by Susan herself.\r\n\r\n“What a picture you are in those furs!” she cried, with an intention\r\nwhich for the moment was lost upon Cynthia. “I thought you would never\r\ncome. You must have walked to Dedham this time. Who do you think is\r\nhere? Mr. Worthington.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington!”\r\n\r\n“I have been trying to entertain him, but I am afraid I have been a very\r\npoor substitute. However, I have persuaded him to stay for supper.”\r\n\r\n“It needed but little persuasion,” said Bob, appearing in the doorway.\r\nAll the snowstorms of the wide Atlantic could not have brought such\r\ncolor to her cheeks. Cynthia, for all her confusion at the meeting, had\r\nnot lost her faculty of observation. He seemed to have changed again,\r\neven during the brief time he had been absent. His tone was grave.\r\n\r\n“He needs to be cheered up, Cynthia,” Susan went on, as though reading\r\nher thoughts. “I have done my best, without success. He won't confess\r\nto me that he has come back to make up some of his courses. I don't mind\r\nowning that I've got to finish a theme to be handed in tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Susan departed, and left them standing in the hall\r\ntogether. Bob took hold of Cynthia's jacket and helped her off with it.\r\nHe could read neither pleasure nor displeasure in her face, though he\r\nsearched it anxiously enough. It was she who led the way into the\r\nparlor and seated herself, as before, on one of the uncompromising,\r\nstraight-backed chairs. Whatever inward tremors the surprise of this\r\nvisit had given her, she looked at him clearly and steadily, completely\r\nmistress of herself, as ever.\r\n\r\n“I thought your holidays did not end until next week,” she said.\r\n\r\n“They do not.”\r\n\r\n“Then why are you here?”\r\n\r\n“Because I could not stay away, Cynthia,” he answered. It was not the\r\nmanner in which he would have said it a month ago. There was a note of\r\nintense earnestness in his voice--now, and to it she could make no light\r\nreply. Confronted again with an unexpected situation, she could not\r\ndecide at once upon a line of action.\r\n\r\n“When did you leave Brampton?” she asked, to gain time. But with the\r\nwords her thoughts flew to the hill country.\r\n\r\n“This morning,” he said, “on the early train. They have three feet\r\nof snow up there.” He, too, seemed glad of a respite from something.\r\n“They're having a great fuss in Brampton about a new teacher for the\r\nvillage school. Miss Goddard has got married. Did you know Miss Goddard,\r\nthe lanky one with the glasses?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia, beginning to be amused at the turn the conversation\r\nwas taking.\r\n\r\n“Well, they can't find anybody smart enough to replace Miss Goddard. Old\r\nEzra Graves, who's on the prudential committee, told Ephraim they ought\r\nto get you. I was in the post-office when they were talking about it.\r\nJust see what a reputation for learning you have in Brampton!”\r\n\r\nCynthia was plainly pleased by the compliment.\r\n\r\n“How is Cousin Eph?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Happy as a lark,” said Bob, “the greatest living authority in New\r\nEngland on the Civil War. He's made the post-office the most popular\r\nsocial club I ever saw. If anybody's missing in Brampton, you can nearly\r\nalways find them in the post-office. But I smiled at the notion of your\r\nbeing a school ma'am.”\r\n\r\n“I don't see anything so funny about it,” replied Cynthia, smiling too.\r\n“Why shouldn't I be? I should like it.”\r\n\r\n“You were made for something different,” he answered quietly.\r\n\r\nIt was a subject she did not choose to discuss with him, and dropped her\r\nlashes before the plainly spoken admiration in his eyes. So a silence\r\nfell between them, broken only by the ticking of the agate clock on the\r\nmantel and the music of sleigh-bells in a distant street. Presently the\r\nsleigh-bells died away, and it seemed to Cynthia that the sound of her\r\nown heartbeats must be louder than the ticking of the clock. Her tact\r\nhad suddenly deserted her; without reason, and she did not dare to\r\nglance again at Bob as he sat under the lamp. That minute--for it was\r\na full minute--was charged with a presage which she could not grasp.\r\nCynthia's instincts were very keen. She understood, of course, that he\r\nhad cut short his holiday to come to see her, and she might have dealt\r\nwith him had that been all. But--through that sixth sense with which\r\nsome women are endowed--she knew that something troubled him. He, too,\r\nhad never yet been at a loss for words.\r\n\r\nThe silence forced him to speak first, and he tried to restore the light\r\ntone to the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Ephraim gave me a piece of news,” he said. “Ezra Graves got it,\r\ntoo. He told us you were down in Boston at a fashionable school. Cousin\r\nEphraim knows a thing or two. He says he always callated you were cut\r\nout for a fine lady.”\r\n\r\n“Bob,” said Cynthia, nerving herself for the ordeal, “did you tell\r\nCousin Ephraim you had seen me?”\r\n\r\n“I told him and Ezra that I had been a constant and welcome visitor at\r\nthis house.”\r\n\r\n“Did, you tell your father that you had seen me?”\r\n\r\nThis was too serious a question to avoid.\r\n\r\n“No, I did not. There was no reason why I should have.”\r\n\r\n“There was every reason,” said Cynthia, “and you know it. Did you tell\r\nhim why you came to Boston to-day?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Why does he think you came?”\r\n\r\n“He doesn't think anything about it,” said Bob. “He went off to Chicago\r\nyesterday to attend a meeting of the board of directors of a western\r\nrailroad.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” she said reproachfully, “you slipped off as soon as his back\r\nwas turned. I would not have believed that of you, Bob. Do you think\r\nthat was fair to him or me?”\r\n\r\nBob Worthington sprang to his feet and stood over her. She had spoken to\r\na boy, but she had aroused a man, and she felt an amazing thrill at the\r\nresult. The muscles in his face tightened, and deepened the lines about\r\nhis mouth, and a fire was lighted about his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he said slowly, “even you shall not speak to me like that. If\r\nI had believed it were right, if I had believed that it would have done\r\nany good to you or me, I should have told my father the moment I got to\r\nBrampton. In affairs of this kind--in a matter of so much importance in\r\nmy life,” he continued, choosing his words carefully, “I am likely to\r\nknow whether I am doing right or wrong. If my mother were alive, I am\r\nsure that she would approve of this--this friendship.”\r\n\r\nHaving got so far, he paused. Cynthia felt that she was trembling, as\r\nthough the force and feeling that was in him had charged her also.\r\n\r\n“I did not intend to come so soon,” he went on, “but--I had a reason for\r\ncoming. I knew that you did not want me.”\r\n\r\n“You know that that is not true, Bob,” she faltered. His next words\r\nbrought her to her feet.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he said, in a voice shaken by the intensity of his passion,\r\n“I came because I love you better than all the world--because I always\r\nwill love you so. I came to protect you, and care for you whatever\r\nhappens. I did not mean to tell you so, now. But it cannot matter,\r\nCynthia!”\r\n\r\nHe seized her, roughly indeed, in his arms, but his very roughness was\r\na proof of the intensity of his love. For an instant she lay palpitating\r\nagainst him, and as long as he lives he will remember the first\r\nexquisite touch of her firm but supple figure and the marvellous\r\ncommunion of her lips. A current from the great store that was in her,\r\npent up and all unknown, ran through him, and then she had struggled out\r\nof his arms and fled, leaving him standing alone in the parlor.\r\n\r\nIt is true that such things happen, and no man or woman may foretell\r\nthe day or the hour thereof. Cynthia fled up the stairs, miraculously\r\narriving unnoticed at her own room, and locked the door and flung\r\nherself on the bed.\r\n\r\nTears came--tears of shame, of joy, of sorrow, of rejoicing, of regret;\r\ntears that burned, and yet relieved her, tears that pained while they\r\ncomforted. Had she sinned beyond the pardon of heaven, or had she\r\ncommitted a supreme act of right? One moment she gloried in it, and the\r\nnext upbraided herself bitterly. Her heart beat with tumult, and again\r\nseemed to stop. Such, though the words but faintly describe them, were\r\nher feelings, for thoughts were still to emerge out of chaos. Love comes\r\nlike a flame to few women, but so it came to Cynthia Wetherell, and\r\nburned out for a while all reason.\r\n\r\nOnly for a while. Generations which had practised self-restraint were\r\nstrong in her--generations accustomed, too, to thinking out, so far as\r\nin them lay, the logical consequences of their acts; generations ashamed\r\nof these very instants when nature has chosen to take command. After\r\na time had passed, during which the world might have shuffled from its\r\ncourse, Cynthia sat up in the darkness. How was she ever to face the\r\nlight again? Reason had returned.\r\n\r\nSo she sat for another space, and thought of what she had done--thought\r\nwith a surprising calmness now which astonished her. Then she thought\r\nof what she would do, for there was an ordeal still to be gone through.\r\nAlthough she shrank from it, she no longer lacked the courage to endure\r\nit. Certain facts began to stand out clearly from the confusion. The\r\nleast important and most immediate of these was that she would have to\r\nface him, and incidentally face the world in the shape of the Merrill\r\nfamily, at supper. She rose mechanically and lighted the gas and bathed\r\nher face and changed her gown. Then she heard Susan's voice at the door.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia, what in the world are you doing?”\r\n\r\nCynthia opened the door and the sisters entered. Was it possible that\r\nthey did not read her terrible secret in her face? Apparently not. Susan\r\nwas busy commenting on the qualities and peculiarities of Mr. Robert\r\nWorthington, and showering upon Cynthia a hundred questions which she\r\nanswered she knew not how; but neither Susan nor Jane, wonderful as it\r\nmay seem, betrayed any suspicion. Did he send the flowers? Cynthia had\r\nnot asked him. Did he want to know whether she read the newspapers? He\r\nhad asked Susan that, before Cynthia came. Susan was ready to repeat the\r\nwhole of her conversation with him. Why did he seem so particular about\r\nnewspapers? Had he notions that girls ought not to read them?\r\n\r\nThe significance of Bob's remarks about newspapers was lost upon Cynthia\r\nthen. Not till afterward did she think of them, or connect them with his\r\nunexpected visit. Then the supper bell rang, and they went downstairs.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be spared Mr. Worthington's feelings after Cynthia left\r\nhim, although they were intense enough, and absorbing and far-reaching\r\nenough. He sat down on a chair and buried his head in his hands. His\r\nimpulse had been to leave the house and return again on the morrow, but\r\nhe remembered that he had been asked to stay for supper, and that such a\r\nproceeding would cause comment. At length he got up and stood before\r\nthe fire, his thoughts still above the clouds, and it was thus that Mr.\r\nMerrill found him when he entered.\r\n\r\n“Good evening,” said that gentleman, genially, not knowing in the least\r\nwho Bob was, but prepossessed in his favor by the way he came forward\r\nand shook his hand and looked him clearly in the eye.\r\n\r\n“I'm Robert Worthington, Mr. Merrill” said he.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” Mr. Merrill gasped, “eh! Oh, certainly, how do you do, Mr.\r\nWorthington?” Mr. Merrill would have been polite to a tax collector or a\r\nsheriff. He separated the office from the man, which ought not always to\r\nbe done. “I'm glad to see you, Mr. Worthington. Well, well, bad storm,\r\nisn't it? I had an idea the college didn't open until next week.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington's going to stay for supper, Papa,” said Susan,\r\nentering.\r\n\r\n“Good!” cried Mr. Merrill. “Capital! You won't miss the old folks after\r\nsupper, will you, girls? Your mother wants me to go to a whist party.”\r\n\r\n“It can't be helped, Carry,” said Mr. Merrill to his wife, as they\r\nwalked up the hill to a neighbor's that evening.\r\n\r\n“He's in love with Cynthia,” said Mrs. Merrill, somewhat sadly; “it's as\r\nplain as the nose on your face, Stephen.”\r\n\r\n“That isn't very plain. Suppose he is! You can dam a mountain stream,\r\nbut you can't prevent it reaching the sea, as we used to say when I\r\nwas a boy in Edmundton. I like Bob,” said Mr. Merrill, with his usual\r\nweakness for Christian names, “and he isn't any more like Dudley\r\nWorthington than I am. If you were to ask me, I'd say he couldn't do a\r\nbetter thing than marry Cynthia.”\r\n\r\n“Stephen!” exclaimed Mrs. Merrill. But in her heart she thought so,\r\ntoo. “What will Mr. Worthington say when he hears the young man has been\r\ncoming to our house to see her?”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had been thinking of that very thing, but with more\r\namusement than concern.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Merrill's house, the three girls and the one young man\r\nwere seated around the fire, and their talk, Merrill as it had begun,\r\nwas becoming minute by minute more stilted. This was largely the fault\r\nof Susan, who would not be happy until she had taken Jane upstairs and\r\nleft Mr. Worthington and Cynthia together. This matter had been arranged\r\nbetween the sisters before supper. Susan found her opening at last, and\r\nupbraided Jane for her unfinished theme; Jane, having learned her lesson\r\nwell, accused Susan. But Cynthia, who saw through the ruse, declared\r\nthat both themes were finished. Susan, naturally indignant at such\r\ningratitude, denied this. The manoeuvre, in short, was executed very\r\nclumsily and very obviously, but executed nevertheless--the sisters\r\nmarching out of the room under a fire of protests. The reader, too, will\r\nno doubt think it a very obvious manoeuvre, but some things are managed\r\nbadly in life as well as in books.\r\n\r\nCynthia and Bob were left alone: left, moreover, in mortal terror of\r\neach other. It is comparatively easy to open the door of a room and\r\nrush into a lady's arms if the lady be willing and alone. But to be\r\nabandoned, as Susan had abandoned them, and with such obvious intent,\r\ncreates quite a different atmosphere. Bob had dared to hope for such an\r\nopportunity: had made up his mind during supper, while striving to be\r\nagreeable, just what he would do if the opportunity came. Instead, all\r\nhe could do was to sit foolishly in his chair and look at the coals, not\r\nso much as venturing to turn his head until the sound of footsteps had\r\ndied away on the upper floors. It was Cynthia who broke the silence\r\nand took command--a very different Cynthia from the girl who had thrown\r\nherself on the bed not three hours before. She did not look at him, but\r\nstared with determination into the fire.\r\n\r\n“Bob, you must go,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Go!” he cried. Her voice loosed the fetters of his passion, and he\r\ndared to seize the band that lay on the arm of her chair. She did not\r\nresist this.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you must go. You should not have stayed for supper.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he said, “how can I leave you? I will not leave you.”\r\n\r\n“But you can and must,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Why?” he asked, looking at her in dismay.\r\n\r\n“You know the reason,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Know it?” he cried. “I know why I should stay. I know that I love you\r\nwith my whole heart and soul. I know that I love you as few men have\r\never loved--and that you are the one woman among millions who can\r\ninspire such a love.”\r\n\r\n“No, Bob, no,” she said, striving hard to keep her head, withdrawing her\r\nhand that it might not betray the treason of her lips. Aware, strange as\r\nit may seem, of the absurdity of the source of what she was to say, for\r\na trace of a smile was about her mouth as she gazed at the coals.\r\n“You will get over this. You are not yet out of college, and many such\r\nfancies happen there.”\r\n\r\nFor the moment he was incapable of speaking, incapable of finding an\r\nanswer sufficiently emphatic. How was he to tell her of the rocks upon\r\nwhich his love was built?\r\n\r\nHow was he to declare that the very perils which threatened her had made\r\na man of him, with all of a man's yearning to share these perils and\r\nshield her from them? How was he to speak at all of those perils? He did\r\nnot declaim, yet when he spoke, an enduring sincerity which she could\r\nnot deny was in his voice.\r\n\r\n“You know in your heart that what you say is not true, Cynthia. Whatever\r\nhappens, I shall always love you.”\r\n\r\nWhatever happens: She shuddered at the words, reminding her as they did\r\nof all her vague misgivings and fears.\r\n\r\n“Whatever happens!” she found herself repeating them involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“Yes, whatever happens I will love you truly and faithfully. I will\r\nnever desert you, never deny you, as long as I live. And you love me,\r\nCynthia,” he cried, “you love me, I know it.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she answered, her breath coming fast. He was on his feet now,\r\ndangerously near her, and she rose swiftly to avoid him.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head, that he might not read the denial in her eyes;\r\nand yet had to look at him again, for he was coming toward her quickly.\r\n“Don't touch me,” she said, “don't touch me.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked at her so pitifully that she could scarce keep\r\nback her tears.\r\n\r\n“You do love me,” he repeated.\r\n\r\nSo they stood for a moment, while Cynthia made a supreme effort to speak\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Bob,” she said at last, “if you ever wish to see me again, you\r\nmust do as I say. You must write to your father, and tell him what you\r\nhave done and--and what you wish to do. You may come to me and tell me\r\nhis answer, but you must not come to me before.” She would have said\r\nmore, but her strength was almost gone. Yes, and more would have implied\r\na promise or a concession. She would not bind herself even by a hint.\r\nBut of this she was sure: that she would not be the means of wrecking\r\nhis opportunities. “And now--you must go.”\r\n\r\nHe stayed where he was, though his blood leaped within him, his\r\nadmiration and respect for the girl outran his passion. Robert\r\nWorthington was a gentleman.\r\n\r\n“I will do as you say, Cynthia,” he answered, “but I am doing it for\r\nyou. Whatever my father's reply may be will not change my love or my\r\nintentions. For I am determined that you shall be my wife.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, and one long, lingering look, he turned and left\r\nher. He had lacked the courage to speak of his father's bitterness and\r\nanimosity. Who will blame him? Cynthia thought none the less of him\r\nfor not telling her. There was, indeed, no need now to describe Dudley\r\nWorthington's feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen the door had closed she stoke to the window, and listened to his\r\nfootfalls in the snow until she heard them no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe next morning Cynthia's heart was heavy as she greeted her new\r\nfriends at Miss Sadler's school. Life had made a woman of her long ago,\r\nwhile these girls had yet been in short dresses, and now an experience\r\nhad come to her which few, if any, of these could ever know. It was of\r\nno use for her to deny to herself that she loved Bob Worthington--loved\r\nhim with the full intensity of the strong nature that was hers. To how\r\nmany of these girls would come such a love? and how many would be called\r\nupon to make such a renunciation as hers had been? No wonder she felt\r\nout of place among them, and once more the longing to fly away to\r\nConiston almost overcame her. Jethro would forgive her, she knew, and\r\nstretch out his arms to receive her, and understand that some trouble\r\nhad driven her to him.\r\n\r\nShe was aroused by some one calling her name--some one whose voice\r\nsounded strangely familiar. Cynthia was perhaps the only person in the\r\nschool that day who did not know that Miss Janet Duncan had entered it.\r\nMiss Sadler certainly knew it, and asked Miss Duncan very particularly\r\nabout her father and mother and even her brother. Miss Sadler knew, even\r\nbefore Janet's unexpected arrival, that Mr. and Mrs. Duncan had come to\r\nBoston after Christmas, and had taken a large house in the Back Bay\r\nin order to be near their son at Harvard. Mrs. Duncan was, in fact, a\r\nBostonian, and more at home there than at any other place.\r\n\r\nMiss Sadler observed with a great deal of astonishment the warm embrace\r\nthat Janet bestowed on Cynthia. The occurrence started in Miss Sadler a\r\ntrain of thought, as a result of which she left the drawing-room where\r\nthese reunions were held, and went into her own private study to write\r\na note. This she addressed to Mrs. Alexander Duncan, at a certain number\r\non Beacon Street, and sent it out to be posted immediately. In the\r\nmeantime, Janet Duncan had seated herself on the sofa beside Cynthia,\r\nnot having for an instant ceased to talk to her. Of what use to write a\r\nromance, when they unfolded themselves so beautifully in real life! Here\r\nwas the country girl she had seen in Washington already in a fine way to\r\nbecome the princess, and in four months! Janet would not have thought it\r\npossible for any one to change so much in such a time. Cynthia listened,\r\nand wondered what language Miss Duncan would use if she knew how great\r\nand how complete that change had been. Romances, Cynthia thought sadly,\r\nwere one thing to theorize about and quite another thing to endure--and\r\nsmiled at the thought. But Miss Duncan had no use for a heroine without\r\na heartache.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that Miss Janet Duncan may appear with Miss Sally\r\nBroke in another volume. The style of her conversation is known, and\r\nthere is no room to reproduce it here. She, too, had a heart, but she\r\nwas a young woman given to infatuations, as Cynthia rightly guessed.\r\nCynthia must spend many afternoons at her house--lunch with her, drive\r\nwith her. For one omission Cynthia was thankful: she did not mention Bob\r\nWorthington's name. There was the romance under Miss Duncan's nose, and\r\nshe did not see it. It is frequently so with romancers.\r\n\r\nCynthia's impassiveness, her complete poise, had fascinated Miss Duncan\r\nwith the others. Had there been nothing beneath that exterior, Janet\r\nwould never have guessed it, and she would have been quite as happy.\r\nCynthia saw very clearly that Mr. Worthington or no other man or woman\r\ncould force Bob to marry Janet.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in such intervals as her studies permitted, Janet\r\ncontinued her attentions to Cynthia. That same morning she had brought a\r\nnote from her father to Miss Sadler, of the contents of which Janet\r\nknew nothing. Miss Sadler retired into her study to read it, and two\r\nnewspaper clippings fell out of it under the paper-cutter. This was the\r\nnote:--\r\n\r\n   “My DEAR MISS SADLER:\r\n\r\n   “Mrs. Duncan has referred your note to me, and I enclose two\r\n   clippings which speak for themselves. Miss Wetherell, I believe,\r\n   stands in the relation of ward to the person to whom they refer, and\r\n   her father was a sort of political assistant to this person.\r\n   Although, as you say, we are from that part of the country (Miss\r\n   Sadler bad spoken of the Duncans as the people of importance there),\r\n   it was by the merest accident that Miss Wetherell's connection with\r\n   this Jethro Bass was brought to my notice.\r\n\r\n   “Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n   “ALEXANDER DUNCAN.”\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to know that there were people in the world who could\r\nsnub Miss Sadler; and there could be no doubt, from the manner in which\r\nshe laid the letter down and took up the clippings, that Miss Sadler\r\nfelt snubbed: equally, there could be no doubt that the revenge\r\nwould fall on other shoulders than Mr. Duncan's. And when Miss Sadler\r\nproceeded to read the clippings, her hair would have stood on end with\r\nhorror had it not been so efficiently plastered down. Miss Sadler seized\r\nher pen, and began a letter to Mrs. Merrill. Miss Sadler's knowledge of\r\nthe proprieties--together with other qualifications--had made her school\r\nwhat it was. No Cynthia Wetherells had ever before entered its sacred\r\nportals, or should again.\r\n\r\nThe first of these clippings was the article containing the arraignment\r\nof Jethro Bass which Mr. Merrill had shown to his wife, and which had\r\nbeen the excuse for Miss Penniman's call. The second was one which Mr.\r\nDuncan had clipped from the Newcastle Guardian of the day before,\r\nand gave, from Mr. Worthington's side, a very graphic account of the\r\nconflict which was to tear the state asunder. The railroads were tired\r\nof paying toll to the chief of a band of thieves and cutthroats, to a\r\nman who had long throttled the state which had nourished him, to--in\r\nshort,--to Jethro Bass. Miss Sadler was not much interested in the\r\nfigures and metaphors of political compositions. Right had found\r\na champion--the article continued--in Mr. Isaac D. Worthington of\r\nBrampton, president of the Truro Road and owner of large holdings\r\nelsewhere. Mr. Worthington, backed by other respectable property\r\ninterests, would fight this monster of iniquity to the death, and\r\nrelease the state from his thraldom. Jethro Bass, the article alleged,\r\nwas already about his abominable work--had long been so--as in mockery\r\nof that very vigilance which is said to be the price of liberty. His\r\nagents were busy in every town of the state, seeing to it that the\r\nslaves of Jethro Bass should be sent to the next legislature.\r\n\r\nAnd what was this system which he had built up among these rural\r\ncommunities? It might aptly be called the System of Mortgages. The\r\nmortgage--dread name for a dreadful thing--was the chief weapon of the\r\nmonster. Even as Jethro Bass held the mortgages of Coniston and Tarleton\r\nand round about, so his lieutenants held mortgages in every town and\r\nhamlet of the state, What was a poor farmer to do--? His choice was not\r\nbetween right and wrong, but between a roof over the heads of his wife\r\nand children and no roof. He must vote for the candidate of Jethro Bass\r\nend corruption or become a homeless wanderer. How the gentleman and his\r\nother respectable backers were to fight the system the article did not\r\nsay. Were they to buy up all the mortgages? As a matter of fact, they\r\nintended to buy up enough of these to count, but to mention this would\r\nbe to betray the methods of Mr. Worthington's reform. The first bitter\r\nfrontier fighting between the advance cohorts of the new giant and the\r\nold--the struggle for the caucuses and the polls--had begun. Miss Sadler\r\ncared but little and understood less of all this matter. She lingered\r\nover the sentences which described Jethro Bass as a monster of iniquity,\r\nas a pariah with whom decent men would have no intercourse, and in the\r\nheat of her passion that one who had touched him had gained admittance\r\nto the most exclusive school for young ladies in the country she wrote a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nMiss Sadler wrote the letter, and three hours later tore it up and wrote\r\nanother and more diplomatic one. Mrs. Merrill, though not by any means\r\nof the same importance as Mrs. Duncan, was not a person to be wantonly\r\noffended, and might--knowing nothing about the monster--in the goodness\r\nof her heart have taken the girl into her house. Had it been otherwise,\r\nsurely Mrs. Merrill would not have had the effrontery! She would give\r\nMrs. Merrill a chance. The bell of release from studies was ringing as\r\nshe finished this second letter, and Miss Sadler in her haste forgot to\r\nenclose the clippings. She ran out in time to intercept Susan Merrill at\r\nthe door, and to press into her hands the clippings and the note, with a\r\nrequest to take both to her mother.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Duncans dined in the evening, the Merrills had dinner at\r\nhalf-past one in the afternoon, when the girls returned from school.\r\nMr. Merrill usually came home, but he had gone off somewhere for this\r\nparticular day, and Mrs. Merrill had a sewing circle. The girls sat\r\ndown to dinner alone. When they got up from the table, Susan suddenly\r\nremembered the note which she had left in her coat pocket. She drew out\r\nthe clippings with it.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what Miss Sadler is sending mamma clippings for,” she said.\r\n“Why, Cynthia, they're about your uncle. Look!”\r\n\r\nAnd she handed over the article headed “Jethro Bass.” Jane, who\r\nhad quicker intuitions than her sister, would have snatched it from\r\nCynthia's hand, and it was a long time before Susan forgave herself for\r\nher folly. Thus Miss Sadler had her revenge.\r\n\r\nIt is often mercifully ordained that the mightiest blows of misfortune\r\nare tempered for us. During the winter evenings in Coniston, Cynthia\r\nhad read little newspaper attacks on Jethro, and scorned them as the\r\ncowardly devices of enemies. They had been, indeed, but guarded and\r\ncovert allusions--grimaces from a safe distance. Cynthia's first\r\nsensation as she read was anger--anger so intense as to send all the\r\nblood in her body rushing to her head. But what was this? “Right had\r\nfound a champion at last” in--in Isaac D. Worthington! That was the\r\nfirst blow, and none but Cynthia knew the weight of it. It sank but\r\nslowly into her consciousness, and slowly the blood left her face,\r\nslowly but surely: left it at length as white as the lace curtain of\r\nthe window which she clutched in her distress. Words which somebody had\r\nspoken were ringing in her ears. Whatever happens! “Whatever happens I\r\nwill never desert you, never deny you, as long as I live.” This, then,\r\nwas what he had meant by newspapers, and why he had come to her!\r\n\r\nThe sisters, watching her, cried out in dismay. There was no need to\r\ntell them that they were looking on at a tragedy, and all the love and\r\nsympathy in their hearts went out to her.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia! Cynthia! What is it?” cried Susan, who, thinking she would\r\nfaint, seized her in her arms. “What have I done?”\r\n\r\nCynthia did not faint, being made of sterner substance. Gently, but\r\nwith that inexorable instinct of her kind which compels them to look for\r\nreliance within themselves even in the direst of extremities, Cynthia\r\nreleased herself from Susan's embrace and put a hand to her forehead.\r\n\r\n“Will you leave me here a little while--alone?” she said.\r\n\r\nIt was Jane now who drew Susan out and shut the door of the parlor after\r\nthem. In utter misery they waited on the stairs while Cynthia fought out\r\nher battle for herself.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone she sank down into the big chair under the reading\r\nlamp--the very chair in which he had sat only two nights before. She saw\r\nnow with a terrible clearness the thing which for so long had been but a\r\nvague premonition of disaster, and for a while she forgot the clippings.\r\nAnd when after a space the touch of them in her hand brought them back\r\nto her remembrance, she lacked the courage to read them through. But not\r\nfor long. Suddenly her fear of them gave place to a consuming hatred of\r\nthe man who had inspired these articles: of Isaac D. Worthington, for\r\nshe knew that he must have inspired them. And then she began again to\r\nread them.\r\n\r\nTruth, though it come perverted from the mouth of an enemy, has\r\nin itself a note to which the soul responds, let the mind deny as\r\nvehemently as it will. Cynthia read, and as she read her body was shaken\r\nwith sobs, though the tears came not. Could it be true? Could the least\r\nparticle of the least of these fearful insinuations be true? Oh, the\r\ntreason of those whispers in a voice that was surely not her own, and\r\nyet which she could not hush! Was it possible that such things could be\r\nprinted about one whom she had admired and respected above all men--nay,\r\nwhom she had so passionately adored from childhood? A monster of\r\niniquity, a pariah! The cruel, bitter calumny of those names! Cynthia\r\nthought of his goodness and loving kindness and his charity to her and\r\nto many others. His charity! The dreaded voice repeated that word, and\r\nsent a thought that struck terror into her heart: Whence had come the\r\nsubstance of that charity? Then came another word--mortgage. There it\r\nwas on the paper, and at sight of it there leaped out of her memory\r\na golden-green poplar shimmering against the sky and the distant blue\r\nbillows of mountains in the west. She heard the high-pitched voice of a\r\nwoman speaking the word, and even then it had had a hateful sound, and\r\nshe heard herself asking, “Uncle Jethro, what is a mortgage?” He had\r\nstruck his horse with the whip.\r\n\r\nLoyal though the girl was, the whispers would not hush, nor the doubts\r\ncease to assail her. What if ever so small a portion of this were true?\r\nCould the whole of this hideous structure, tier resting upon tier, have\r\nbeen reared without something of a foundation? Fiercely though she told\r\nherself she would believe none of it, fiercely though she hated Mr.\r\nWorthington, fervently though she repeated aloud that her love for\r\nJethro and her faith in him had not changed, the doubts remained. Yet\r\nthey remained unacknowledged.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. It was a thing beyond belief that one hour could have\r\nheld such a store of agony. An hour passed, and Cynthia came dry-eyed\r\nfrom the parlor. Susan and Jane, waiting to give her comfort when she\r\nwas recovered a little from this unknown but overwhelming affliction,\r\nwere fain to stand mute when they saw her to pay a silent deference to\r\none whom sorrow had lifted far above them and transfigured. That was the\r\nlook on Cynthia's face. She went up the stairs, and they stood in the\r\nhall not knowing what to do, whispering in awe-struck voices. They were\r\nstill there when Cynthia came down again, dressed for the street. Jane\r\nseized her by the hand.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going, Cynthia?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I shall be back by five,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nShe went up the hill, and across to old Louisburg Square, and up the\r\nhill again. The weather had cleared, the violet-paned windows caught the\r\nslanting sunlight and flung it back across the piles of snow. It was\r\na day for wedding-bells. At last Cynthia came to a queerly fashioned\r\nlittle green door that seemed all askew with the slanting street, and\r\nrang the bell, and in another moment was standing on the threshold of\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman's little sitting room. To Miss Lucretia, at her\r\nwriting table, one glance was sufficient. She rose quickly to meet\r\nthe girl, kissed her unresponsive cheek, and led her to a chair. Miss\r\nLucretia was never one to beat about the bush, even in the gravest\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n“You have read the articles,” she said.\r\n\r\nRead them! During her walk hither Cynthia had been incapable of thought,\r\nbut the epithets and arraignments and accusations, the sentences and\r\nparagraphs, wars printed now, upon her brain, never, she believed, to\r\nbe effaced. Every step of the way she had been unconsciously repeating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Have you read them?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Has everybody read them?” Did the whole world, then, know of her shame?\r\n\r\n“I am glad you came to me, my dear,” said Miss Lucretia, taking her\r\nhand. “Have you talked of this to any one else?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cynthia, simply.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia was puzzled. She had not looked for apathy, but she\r\ndid not know all of Cynthia's troubles. She wondered whether she had\r\nmisjudged the girl, and was misled by her attitude.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” she said, with a briskness meant to hide emotion for Miss\r\nLucretia had emotions, “I am a lonely old woman, getting too old,\r\nindeed, to finish the task of my life. I went to see Mrs. Merrill the\r\nother day to ask her if she would let you come and live with me. Will\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nCynthia shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, Miss Lucretia, I cannot,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“I won't press it on you now,” said Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n“I cannot, Miss Lucretia. I'm going to Coniston.”\r\n\r\n“Going to Coniston!” exclaimed Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\nThe name of that place--magic name, once so replete with visions of\r\nhappiness and content--seemed to recall Cynthia's spirit from its\r\nflight. Yes, the spirit was there, for it flashed in her eyes as she\r\nturned and looked into Miss Lucretia's face.\r\n\r\n“Are these the articles you read?” she asked; taking the clippings from\r\nher muff.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia put on her spectacles.\r\n\r\n“I have seen both of them,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And do you believe what they say about--about Jethro Bass?”\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Lucretia! For once in her life she was at a loss. She, too,\r\npaid a deference to that face, young as it was. She had robbed herself\r\nof sleep trying to make up her mind what she would say upon such an\r\noccasion if it came. A wonderful virgin faith had to be shattered, and\r\nwas she to be the executioner? She loved the girl with that strange,\r\nintense affection which sometimes comes to the elderly and the lonely,\r\nand she had prayed that this cup might pass from her. Was it possible\r\nthat it was her own voice using very much the same words for which she\r\nhad rebuked Mrs. Merrill?\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” she said, “those articles were written by politicians, in a\r\npolitical controversy. No such articles can ever be taken literally.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Lucretia, do you believe what it says about Jethro Bass?” repeated\r\nCynthia.\r\n\r\nHow was she to avoid those eyes? They pierced into, her soul, even as\r\nher own had pierced into Mrs. Merrill's. Oh, Miss Lucretia, who pride\r\nyourself on your plain speaking, that you should be caught quibbling!\r\nMiss Lucretia blushed for the first time in many, years, and into her\r\nface came the light of battle.\r\n\r\n“I am a coward, my dear. I deserve your rebuke. To the best of my\r\nknowledge and belief, and so far as I can judge from the inquiries I\r\nhave undertaken, Jethro Bass has made his living and gained and held his\r\npower by the methods described in those articles.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia took off her spectacles and wiped them. She had committed\r\na fine act of courage.\r\n\r\nCynthia stood up.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she said, “that is what I wanted to know.”\r\n\r\n“But--” cried Miss Lucretia, in amazement and apprehension, “but what\r\nare you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to Coniston,” said Cynthia, “to ask him if those things are\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\n“To ask him!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. If he tells me they are true, then I shall believe them.”\r\n\r\n“If he tells you?” Miss Lucretia gasped. Here was a courage of which she\r\nhad not reckoned. “Do you think he will tell you?”\r\n\r\n“He will tell me, and I shall believe him, Miss Lucretia.”\r\n\r\n“You are a remarkable girl, Cynthia,” said Miss Lucretia, involuntarily.\r\nThen she paused for a moment. “Suppose he tells you they are true? You\r\nsurely can't live with him again, Cynthia.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose I am going to desert him, Miss Lucretia?” she asked. “He\r\nloves me, and--and I love him.” This was the first time her voice had\r\nfaltered. “He kept my father from want and poverty, and he has brought\r\nme up as a daughter. If his life has been as you say, I shall make my\r\nown living!”\r\n\r\n“How?” demanded Miss Lucretia, the practical part of her coming\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\n“I shall teach school. I believe I can get a position, in a place where\r\nI can see him often. I can break his heart, Miss Lucretia, I--I can\r\nbring sadness to myself, but I will not desert him.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia stared at her for a moment, not knowing what to say or do.\r\nShe perceived that the girl had a spirit as strong as her own: that her\r\nplans were formed, her mind made up, and that no arguments could change\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Why did you come to me?” she asked irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n“Because I thought that you would have read the articles, and I knew\r\nif you had, you would have taken the trouble to inform yourself of the\r\nworld's opinion.”\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Lucretia stared at her.\r\n\r\n“I will go to Coniston with you,” she said, “at least as far as\r\nBrampton.”\r\n\r\nCynthia's face softened a little at the words.\r\n\r\n“I would rather go alone, Miss Lucretia,” she answered gently, but with\r\nthe same firmness. “I--I am very grateful to you for your kindness to me\r\nin Boston. I shall not forget it--or you. Good-by, Miss Lucretia.”\r\n\r\nBut Miss Lucretia, sobbing openly, gathered the girl in her arms and\r\npressed her. Age was coming on her indeed, that she should show such\r\nweakness. For a long time she could not trust herself to speak, and then\r\nher words were broken. Cynthia must come to her at the first sign of\r\ndoubt or trouble: this, Miss Lucretia's house, was to be a refuge in any\r\nstorm that life might send--and Miss Lucretia's heart. Cynthia promised,\r\nand when she went out at last through the little door her own tears were\r\nfalling, for she loved Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\nCynthia was going to Coniston. That journey was as fixed, as inevitable,\r\nas things mortal can be. She would go to Coniston unless she perished\r\non the way. No loving entreaties, no fears of Mrs. Merrill or her\r\ndaughters, were of any avail. Mrs. Merrill too, was awed by the vastness\r\nof the girl's sorrow, and wondered if her own nature were small by\r\ncomparison. She had wept, to be sure, at her husband's confession, and\r\nlain awake over it in the night watches, and thought of the early days\r\nof their marriage.\r\n\r\nAnd then, Mrs. Merrill told herself, Cynthia would have to talk with Mr.\r\nMerrill. How was he to come unscathed out of that? There was pain and\r\nbitterness in that thought, and almost resentment against Cynthia,\r\nquivering though she was with sympathy for the girl. For Mrs. Merrill,\r\nthough the canker remained, had already pardoned her husband and had\r\nasked the forgiveness of God for that pardon. On other occasions, in\r\nother crisis, she had waited and watched for him in the parlor window,\r\nand to-night she was at the door before his key was in the lock, while\r\nhe was still stamping the snow from his boots. She drew him into the\r\nroom and told him what had happened.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Stephen,” she cried, “what are you going to say to her?”\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed? His wife had sorrowed, but she had known the obstacles and\r\nperils by which he had been beset. But what was he to say to Cynthia?\r\nHer very name had grown upon him, middle-aged man of affairs though he\r\nwas, until the thought of it summoned up in his mind a figure of purity,\r\nand of the strength which was from purity. He would not have believed\r\nit possible that the country girl whom they had taken into their house\r\nthree months before should have wrought such an influence over them all.\r\n\r\nEven in the first hour of her sorrow which she had spent that afternoon\r\nin the parlor, Cynthia had thought of Mr. Merrill. He could tell her\r\nwhether those accusations were true or false, for he was a friend of\r\nJethro's. Her natural impulse--the primeval one of a creature which is\r\nhurt--had been to hide herself; to fly to her own room, and perhaps\r\nby nightfall the courage would come to her to ask him the terrible\r\nquestions. He was a friend of Jethro's. An illuminating flash revealed\r\nto her the meaning of that friendship--if the accusations were true. It\r\nwas then she had thought of Miss Lucretia Penniman, and somehow she had\r\nfound the courage to face the sunlight and go to her. She would spare\r\nMr. Merrill.\r\n\r\nBut had she spared him? Sadly the family sat down to supper without her,\r\nand after supper Mr. Merrill sent a message to his club that he could\r\nnot attend a committee meeting there that evening. He sat with his wife\r\nin the little writing room, he pretending to read and she pretending to\r\nsew, until the silence grew too oppressive, and they spoke of the matter\r\nthat was in their hearts. It was one of the bitterest evenings in\r\nMr. Merrill's life, and there is no need to linger on it. They talked\r\nearnestly of Cynthia, and of her future. But they both knew why she did\r\nnot come down to them.\r\n\r\n“So she is really going to Coniston,” said Mr. Merrill.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mrs. Merrill, “and I think she is doing right, Stephen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill groaned. His wife rose and put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Come, Stephen,” she said gently, “you will see her in the morning.\r\n\r\n“I will go to Coniston with her,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Mrs. Merrily “she wants to go alone. And I believe it is\r\nbest that she should.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGreat afflictions generally bring in their train a host of smaller\r\nsorrows, each with its own little pang. One of these sorrows had been\r\nthe parting with the Merrill family. Under any circumstance it was not\r\neasy for Cynthia to express her feelings, and now she had found it very\r\ndifficult to speak of the gratitude and affection which she felt. But\r\nthey understood--dear, good people that they were: no eloquence was\r\nneeded with them. The ordeal of breakfast over, and the tearful “God\r\nbless you, Miss Cynthia,” of Ellen the parlor-maid, the whole family had\r\ngone with her to the station. For Susan and Jane had spent their last\r\nday at Miss Sadler's school.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had sent for the conductor and bidden him take care of Miss\r\nWetherell, and recommend her in his name to a conductor on the Truro\r\nRoad. The man took off his cap to Mr. Merrill and called him by name\r\nand promised. It was a dark day, and long after the train had pulled out\r\nCynthia remembered the tearful faces of the family standing on the\r\ndamp platform of the station. As they fled northward through the flat\r\nriver-meadows, the conductor would have liked to talk to her of Mr.\r\nMerrill; there were few employees on any railroad who did not know the\r\ngenial and kindly president of the Grand Gulf and sympathize with\r\nhis troubles. But there was a look on the girl's face that forbade\r\nintrusion. Passengers stared at her covertly, as though fascinated by\r\nthat look, and some tried to fathom it. But her eyes were firmly fixed\r\nupon a point far beyond their vision. The car stopped many times, and\r\nflew on again, but nothing seemed to break her absorption.\r\n\r\nAt last she was aroused by the touch of the conductor on her sleeve. The\r\npeople were beginning to file out of the car, and the train was under\r\nthe shadow of the snow-covered sheds in the station of the state\r\ncapital. Cynthia recognized the place, though it was cold and bare\r\nand very different in appearance from what it had been on the summer's\r\nevening when she had come into it with her father. That, in effect, had\r\nbeen her first glimpse of the world, and well she recalled the thrill\r\nit had given her. The joy of such things was gone now, the rapture of\r\nholidays and new sights. These were over, so she told herself. Sorrow\r\nhad quenched the thrills forever.\r\n\r\nThe kind conductor led her to the eating room, and when she would not\r\neat his concern drew greater than ever. He took a strange interest in\r\nthis young lady who had such a face and such eyes. He pointed her out to\r\nhis friend the Truro conductor, and gave him some sandwiches and fruit\r\nwhich he himself had bought, with instructions to press them on her\r\nduring the afternoon.\r\n\r\nCynthia could not eat. She hated this place, with its memories. Hated\r\nit, too, as a mart where men were bought and sold, for the wording\r\nof those articles ran in her head as though some priest of evil were\r\nchanting them in her ears. She did not remember then the sweeter aspect\r\nof the old town, its pretty homes set among their shaded gardens--homes\r\nfull of good and kindly people. State House affairs were far removed\r\nfrom most of these, and the sickness and corruption of the body politic.\r\nAnd this political corruption, had she known it, was no worse than that\r\nof the other states in the wide Union: not so bad, indeed, as many,\r\nthough this was small comfort. No comfort at all to Cynthia, who did not\r\nthink of it.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she rose and followed the new conductor to the Truro\r\ntrain, glad to leave the capital behind her. She was going to the\r\nhills--to the mountains. They, in truth, could not change, though the\r\nseasons passed over them, hot and cold, wet and dry. They were immutable\r\nin their goodness. Presently she saw them, the lower ones: the waters of\r\nthe little stream beside her broke the black bonds of ice and raced over\r\nthe rapids; the engine was puffing and groaning on the grade. Then the\r\nsun crept out, slowly, from the indefinable margin of vapor that hung\r\nmassed over the low country.\r\n\r\nYes, she had come to the hills. Up and up climbed the train, through\r\nthe little white villages in the valley nooks, banked with whiter snow;\r\nthrough the narrow gorges,--sometimes hanging over them,--under steep\r\ngranite walls seared with ice-filled cracks, their brows hung with\r\nicicles.\r\n\r\nTruro Pass is not so high as the Brenner, but it has a grand, wild look\r\nin winter, remote as it is from the haunts of men. A fitting refuge,\r\nit might be, for a great spirit heavy with the sins of the world\r\nbelow. Such a place might have been chosen, in the olden time, for a\r\nmonastery--a gray fastness built against the black forest over the crag\r\nlooking down upon the green clumps of spruces against the snow. Some\r\nvague longing for such a refuge was in Cynthia's heart as she gazed\r\nupon that silent place, and then the waters had already begun to run\r\nwestward--the waters of Tumble Down brook, which flowed into Coniston\r\nWater above Brampton. The sun still had more than two hours to go on its\r\njourney to the hill crests when the train pulled into Brampton station.\r\nThere were but a few people on the platform, but the first face she saw\r\nas she stepped from the car was Lem Hallowell's. It was a very red face,\r\nas we know, and its owner was standing in front of the Coniston stage,\r\non runners now. He stared at her for an instant, and no wonder, and then\r\nhe ran forward with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy--Cynthy Wetherell!” he cried. “Great Godfrey!”\r\n\r\nHe got so far, he seized her hands, and then he stopped, not knowing\r\nwhy. There were many more ejaculations and welcomes and what not on the\r\nend of his tongue. It was not that she had become a lady--a lady of a\r\ntype he had never before seen. He meant to say that, too, in his own\r\nway, but he couldn't. And that transformation would have bothered Lem\r\nbut little. What was the change, then? Why was he in awe of her--he, Lem\r\nHallowell, who had never been in awe of any one? He shook his head,\r\nas though openly confessing his inability to answer that question. He\r\nwanted to ask others, but they would not come.\r\n\r\n“Lem,” she said, “I am so glad you are here.”\r\n\r\n“Climb right in, Cynthy. I'll get the trunk.” There it lay, the little\r\nrawhide one before him on the boards, and he picked it up in his bare\r\nhands as though it had been a paper parcel. It was a peculiarity of the\r\nstage driver that he never wore gloves, even in winter, so remarkable\r\nwas the circulation of his blood. After the trunk he deposited,\r\napparently with equal ease, various barrels and boxes, and then he\r\njumped in beside Cynthia, and they drove down familiar Brampton Street,\r\nas wide as a wide river; past the meeting-house with the terraced\r\nsteeple; past the postoffice,--Cousin Ephraim's postoffice,--where Lem\r\ngave her a questioning look--but she shook her head, and he did not wait\r\nfor the distribution of the last mail that day; past the great mansion\r\nof Isaac D. Worthington, where the iron mastiffs on the lawn were up to\r\ntheir muzzles in snow. After that they took the turn to the right, which\r\nwas the road to Coniston.\r\n\r\nWell-remembered road, and in winter or summer, Cynthia knew every tree\r\nand farmhouse beside it. Now it consisted of two deep grooves in the\r\ndeep snow; that was all, save for a curving turnout here and there for\r\nteam to pass team. Well-remembered scene! How often had Cynthia looked\r\nupon it in happier days! Such a crust was on the snow as would bear a\r\nheavy man; and the pasture hillocks were like glazed cakes in the window\r\nof a baker's shop. Never had the western sky looked so yellow through\r\nthe black columns of the pine trunks. A lonely, beautiful road it was\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the silence of the great hills was broken only by the\r\nsweet jingle of the bells on the shaft. Many a day, winter and summer,\r\nLem had gone that road alone, whistling, and never before heeding that\r\nsilence. Now it seemed to symbolize a great sorrow: to be in subtle\r\nharmony with that of the girl at his side. What that sorrow was he could\r\nnot guess. The good man yearned to comfort her, and yet he felt his\r\ncomfort too humble to be noticed by such sorrow. He longed to speak,\r\nbut for the first time in his life feared the sound of his own voice.\r\nCynthia had not spoken since she left the station, had not looked at\r\nhim, had not asked for the friends and neighbors whom she had loved so\r\nwell--had not asked for Jethro! Was there any sorrow on earth to be felt\r\nlike that? And was there one to feel it?\r\n\r\nAt length, when they reached the great forest, Lem Hallowell knew\r\nthat he must speak or cry aloud. But what would be the sound of his\r\nvoice--after such an age of disuse? Could he speak at all? Broken and\r\nhoarse and hideous though the sound might be, he must speak. And hoarse\r\nand broken it was. It was not his own, but still it was a voice.\r\n\r\n“Folks--folks'll be surprised to see you, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\nNo, he had not spoken at all. Yes, he had, for she answered him.\r\n\r\n“I suppose they will, Lem.”\r\n\r\n“Mighty glad to have you back, Cynthy. We think a sight of you. We\r\nmissed you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Lem.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro hain't lookin' for you by any chance, be he?\r\n\r\n“No,” she said. But the question startled her. Suppose he had not been\r\nat home! She had never once thought of that. Could she have borne to\r\nwait for him?\r\n\r\nAfter that Lem gave it up. He had satisfied himself as to his vocal\r\npowers, but he had not the courage even to whistle. The journey to\r\nConiston was faster in the winter, and at the next turn of the road the\r\nlittle village came into view. There it was, among the snows. The pain\r\nin Cynthia's heart, so long benumbed, quickened when she saw it. How\r\nwrite of the sharpness of that pain to those who have never known\r\nit? The sight of every gable brought its agony,--the store with the\r\nchecker-paned windows, the harness shop, the meeting-house, the white\r\nparsonage on its little hill. Rias Richardson ran out of the store in\r\nhis carpet slippers, bareheaded in the cold, and gave one shout. Lem\r\nheeded him not; did not stop there as usual, but drove straight to the\r\ntannery house and pulled up under the butternut tree. Milly Skinner ran\r\nout on the porch, and gave one long look, and cried:--\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, it's Cynthy!”\r\n\r\n“Where's Jethro?” demanded Lem.\r\n\r\nMilly did not answer at once. She was staring at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“He's in the tannery shed,” she said, “choppin' wood.” But still she\r\nkept her eyes on Cynthia's face. “I'll fetch him.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cynthia, “I'll go to him there.”\r\n\r\nShe took the path, leaving Millicent with her mouth open, too amazed to\r\nspeak again, and yet not knowing why.\r\n\r\nIn the tannery shed! Would Jethro remember what happened there almost\r\nsix and thirty years before? Would he remember how that other Cynthia\r\nhad come to him there, and what her appeal had been?\r\n\r\nCynthia came to the doors. One of these was open now--both had been\r\nclosed that other evening against the storm of sleet--and she caught\r\na glimpse of him standing on the floor of chips and bark--tan-bark no\r\nmore. Cynthia caught a glimpse of him, and love suddenly welled up into\r\nher heart as waters into a spring after a drought. He had not seen her,\r\nnot heard the sound of the sleigh-bells. He was standing with his foot\r\nupon the sawbuck and the saw across his knee, he was staring at the\r\nwoodpile, and there was stamped upon his face a look which no man or\r\nwoman had ever seen there, a look of utter loneliness and desolation, a\r\nlook as of a soul condemned to wander forever through the infinite, cold\r\nspaces between the worlds--alone.\r\n\r\nCynthia stopped at sight of it. What had been her misery and affliction\r\ncompared to this? Her limbs refused her, though she knew not whether she\r\nwould have fled or rushed into his arms. How long she stood thus, and he\r\nstood, may not be said, but at length he put down his foot and took the\r\nsaw from his knee, his eyes fell upon her, and his lips spoke her name.\r\n\r\n“Cynthy!”\r\n\r\nSpeechless, she ran to him and flung her arms about his neck, and he\r\ndropped the saw and held her tightly--even as he had held that other\r\nCynthia in that place in the year gone by. And yet not so. Now he clung\r\nto her with a desperation that was terrible, as though to let go of\r\nher would be to fall into nameless voids beyond human companionship and\r\nlove. But at last he did release her, and stood looking down into her\r\nface, as if seeking to read a sentence there.\r\n\r\nAnd how was she to pronounce that sentence! Though her faith might\r\nbe taken away, her love remained, and grew all the greater because he\r\nneeded it. Yet she knew that no subterfuge or pretence would avail her\r\nto hide why she had come. She could not hide it. It must be spoken out\r\nnow, though death was preferable.\r\n\r\nAnd he was waiting. Did he guess? She could not tell. He had spoken no\r\nword but her name. He had expressed no surprise at her appearance, asked\r\nno reasons for it. Superlatives of suffering or joy or courage are hard\r\nto convey--words fall so far short of the feeling. And Cynthia's pain\r\nwas so far beyond tears.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said, “yesterday something--something happened. I\r\ncould not stay in Boston any longer.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“I had to come to you. I could not wait.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\n“I--I read something.” To take a white-hot iron and sear herself would\r\nhave been easier than this.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe felt that the look was coming again--the look which she had\r\nsurprised in his face. His hands dropped lifelessly from her shoulders,\r\nand he turned and went to the door, where he stood with his back to\r\nher, silhouetted against the eastern sky all pink from the reflection\r\nof sunset. He would not help her. Perhaps he could not. The things were\r\ntrue. There had been a grain of hope within her, ready to sprout.\r\n\r\n“I read two articles from the Newcastle Guardian about you--about your\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said. But he did not turn.\r\n\r\n“How you had--how you had earned your living. How you had gained your\r\npower,” she went on, her pain lending to her voice an exquisite note of\r\nmany modulations.\r\n\r\n“Yes--Cynthy,” he said, and still stared at the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nShe took two steps toward him, her arms outstretched, her fingers\r\nopening and closing. And then she stopped.\r\n\r\n“I would believe no one,” she said, “I will believe no\r\none--until--unless you tell me. Uncle Jethro,” she cried in agony,\r\n“Uncle Jethro, tell me that those things are not true!”\r\n\r\nShe waited a space, but he did not stir. There was no sound, save the\r\nsong of Coniston Water under the shattered ice.\r\n\r\n“Won't you speak to me?” she whispered. “Won't you tell me that they are\r\nnot true?”\r\n\r\nHis shoulders shook convulsively. O for the right to turn to her and\r\ntell her that they were lies! He would have bartered his soul for it.\r\nWhat was all the power in the world compared to this priceless treasure\r\nhe had lost? Once before he had cast it away, though without meaning to.\r\nThen he did not know the eternal value of love--of such love as those\r\ntwo women had given him. Now he knew that it was beyond value, the one\r\nprecious gift of life, and the knowledge had come too late. Could he\r\nhave saved his life if he had listened to that other Cynthia?\r\n\r\n“Won't you tell me that they are not true?”\r\n\r\nEven then he did not turn to her, but he answered. Curious to relate,\r\nthough his heart was breaking, his voice was steady--steady as it always\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n“I--I've seen it comin', Cynthy,” he said. “I never knowed anything\r\nI was afraid of before--but I was afraid of this. I knowed what your\r\nnotions of right and wrong was--your--your mother had them. They're the\r\nprinciples of good people. I--I knowed the day would come when you'd\r\nask, but I wanted to be happy as long as I could. I hain't been happy,\r\nCynthy. But you was right when you said I'd tell you the truth. S-so I\r\nwill. I guess them things which you speak about are true--the way I got\r\nwhere I am, and the way I made my livin'. They--they hain't put just as\r\nthey'd ought to be, perhaps, but that's the way I done it in the main.”\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Jethro Bass met the supreme crisis of his life. And\r\nwho shall say he did not meet it squarely and honestly? Few men of finer\r\nfibre and more delicate morals would have acquitted themselves as well.\r\nThat was a Judgment Day for Jethro; and though he knew it not, he spoke\r\nthrough Cynthia to his Maker, confessing his faults freely and humbly,\r\nand dwelling on the justness of his punishment; putting not forward any\r\ngood he may have done; nor thinking of it; nor seeking excuse because\r\nof the light that was in him. Had he been at death's door in the face of\r\nnameless tortures, no man could have dragged such a confession from him.\r\nBut a great love had been given him, and to that love he must speak the\r\ntruth, even at the cost of losing it.\r\n\r\nBut he was not to lose it. Even as he was speaking a thrill of\r\nadmiration ran through Cynthia, piercing her sorrow. The superb strength\r\nof the man was there in that simple confession, and it is in the nature\r\nof woman to admire strength. He had fought his fight, and gained, and\r\npaid the price without a murmur, seeking no palliation. Cynthia had not\r\ncome to that trial--so bitter for her--as a judge. If the reader has\r\nseen youth and innocence sitting in the seat of justice, with age and\r\nexperience at the bar, he has mistaken Cynthia. She came to Coniston\r\ninexorable, it is true, because hers was a nature impelled to do right\r\nthough it perish. She did not presume to say what Jethro's lights and\r\nopportunities might have been. Her own she knew, and by them she must\r\nact accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished speaking, she stole silently to his side and\r\nslipped her hand in his. He trembled violently at her touch.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said in a low tone, “I love you.”\r\n\r\nAt the words he trembled more violently still.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Cynthy,” he answered thickly, “don't say that--I--I don't\r\nexpect it, Cynthy, I know you can't--'twouldn't be right, Cynthy. I\r\nhain't fit for it.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said, “I love you better than I have ever loved you\r\nin my life.”\r\n\r\nOh, how welcome were the tears! and how human! He turned, pitifully\r\nincredulous, wondering that she should seek by deceit to soften the\r\nblow; he saw them running down her cheeks, and he believed. Yes, he\r\nbelieved, though it seemed a thing beyond belief. Unworthy, unfit though\r\nhe were, she loved him. And his own love as he gazed at her, sevenfold\r\nincreased as it had been by the knowledge of losing her, changed in\r\ntexture from homage to worship--nay, to adoration. His punishment would\r\nstill be heavy; but whence had come such a wondrous gift to mitigate it?\r\n\r\n“Oh, don't you believe me?” she cried, “can't you see that it is true?”\r\n\r\nAnd yet he could only hold her there at arm's length with that new and\r\nstrange reverence in his face. He was not worthy to touch her, but still\r\nshe loved him.\r\n\r\nThe flush had faded from the eastern sky, and the faintest border of\r\nyellow light betrayed the ragged outlines of the mountain as they walked\r\ntogether to the tannery house.\r\n\r\nMillicent, in the kitchen, was making great preparations--for Millicent.\r\nMiss Skinner was a person who had hitherto laid it down as a principle\r\nof life to pay deference or do honor to no human made of mere dust, like\r\nherself. Millicent's exception; if Cynthia had thought about it, was a\r\ntribute of no mean order. Cynthia, alas, did not think about it: she\r\ndid not know that, in her absence, the fire had not been lighted in the\r\nevening, Jethro supping on crackers and milk and Milly partaking of the\r\nevening meal at home. Moreover, Miss Skinner had an engagement with a\r\nyoung man. Cynthia saw the fire, and threw off her sealskin coat which\r\nMr. and Mrs. Merrill had given her for Christmas, and took down the\r\nsaucepan from the familiar nail on which it hung. It was a miraculous\r\nfact, for which she did not attempt to account, that she was almost\r\nhappy: happy, indeed, in comparison to that which had been her state\r\nsince the afternoon before. Millicent snatched the saucepan angrily from\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n“What be you doin', Cynthy?” she demanded.\r\n\r\nSuch was Miss Skinner's little way of showing deference. Though\r\ndeference is not usually vehement, Miss Skinner's was very real,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\n“Why, Milly, what's the matter?” exclaimed Cynthia, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“You hain't a-goin' to do any cookin', that's all,” said Milly, very red\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\n“But I've always helped,” said Cynthia. “Why not?”\r\n\r\nWhy not? A tribute was one thing, but to have to put the reasons for\r\nthat tribute, into words was quite another.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” cried Milly, “because you hain't a-goin' to, that's all.”\r\n\r\nStrange deference! But Cynthia turned and looked at the girl with a\r\nlittle, sad smile of comprehension and affection. She took her by the\r\nshoulders and kissed her.\r\n\r\nWhereupon a most amazing thing happened--Millicent burst into\r\ntears--wild, ungovernable tears they were.\r\n\r\n“Because you hain't a-goin' to,” she repeated, her words interspersed\r\nwith violent sobs. “You go 'way, Cynthy,” she cried, “git out!”\r\n\r\n“Milly,” said Cynthia, shaking her head, “you ought to be ashamed of\r\nyourself.” But they were not words of reproof. She took a little lamp\r\nfrom the shelf, and went up the narrow stairs to her own room in the\r\ngable, where Lemuel had deposited the rawhide trunk.\r\n\r\nThough she had had nothing all day, she felt no hunger, but for Milly's\r\nsake she tried hard to eat the supper when it came. Before it had fairly\r\nbegun Moses Hatch had arrived, with Amandy and Eben; and Rias Richardson\r\ncame in, and other neighbors, to say a word of welcome to hear (if the\r\ntruth be not too disparaging to their characters) the reasons for her\r\nsudden appearance, and such news of her Boston experiences as she might\r\nchoose to give them. They had learned from Lem Hallowell that Cynthia\r\nhad returned a lady: a real lady, not a sham one who relied on airs and\r\ngraces, such as had come to Coniston the summer before to look for a\r\nsummer place on the painter's recommendation. Lem was not a gossip, in\r\nthe disagreeable sense of the term, and he had not said a word to his\r\nneighbors of his feelings on that terrible drive from Brampton. Knowing\r\nthat some blow had fallen upon Cynthia, he would have spared her these\r\nvisits if he could. But Lem was wise and kind, so he merely said that\r\nshe had returned a lady.\r\n\r\nAnd they had found a lady. As they stood or sat around the kitchen (Eben\r\nand Rias stood), Cynthia talked to them--about Coniston: rather, be it\r\nsaid, that they talked about Coniston in answer to her questions. The\r\nsledding had been good; Moses had hauled so many thousand feet of lumber\r\nto Brampton; Sam Price's woman (she of Harwich) had had a spell of\r\nsciatica; Chester Perkins's bull had tossed his brother-in-law, come\r\nfrom Iowy on a visit, and broke his leg; yes, Amandy guessed her\r\ndyspepsy was somewhat improved since she had tried Graham's Golden\r\nRemedy--it made her feel real lighthearted; Eben (blushing furiously)\r\nwas to have the Brook Farm in the spring; there was a case of spotted\r\nfever in Tarleton.\r\n\r\nYes, Lem Hallowell had been right, Cynthia was a lady, but not a mite\r\nstuck up. What was the difference in her? Not her clothes, which she\r\nwore as if she had been used to them all her life. Poor Cynthia, the\r\nclothes were simple enough. Not her manner, which was as kind and sweet\r\nas ever. What was it that compelled their talk about themselves, that\r\nmade them refrain from asking those questions about Boston, and why\r\nshe had come back? Some such query was running in their minds as they\r\ntalked, while Jethro, having finished his milk and crackers, sat\r\nsilent at the end of the table with his eyes upon her. He rose when Mr.\r\nSatterlee came in.\r\n\r\nMr. Satterlee looked at her, and then he went quietly across the room\r\nand kissed her. But then Mr. Satterlee was the minister. Cynthia thought\r\nhis hair a little thinner and the lines in his face a little deeper. And\r\nMr. Satterlee thought perhaps he was the only one of the visitors who\r\nguessed why she had come back. He laid his thin hand on her head, as\r\nthough in benediction, and sat down beside her.\r\n\r\n“And how is the learning, Cynthia?” he asked.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, they were going to hear something at last. An intuition\r\nimpelled Cynthia to take advantage of that opportunity.\r\n\r\n“The learning has become so great, Mr. Satterlee,” she said, “that I\r\nhave come back to try to make some use of it. It shall be wasted no\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nShe did not dare to look at Jethro, but she was aware that he had sat\r\ndown abruptly. What sacrifice will not a good woman make to ease the\r\nburden of those whom she loves! And Jethro's burden would be heavy\r\nenough. Such a woman will speak almost gayly, though her heart be heavy.\r\nBut Cynthia's was lighter now than it had been.\r\n\r\n“I was always sure you would not waste your learning, Cynthia,” said Mr.\r\nSatterlee, gravely; “that you would make the most of the advantages God\r\nhas given you.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to try, Mr. Satterlee. I cannot be content in idleness. I\r\nwas wasting time in Boston, and I--I was not happy so far away from you\r\nall--from Uncle Jethro. Mr. Satterlee, I am going to teach school. I\r\nhave always wanted to, and now I have made up my mind to do it.”\r\n\r\nThis was Jethro's punishment. But had she not lightened it for him a\r\nlittle by choosing this way of telling him that she could not eat his\r\nbread or partake of his bounty? Though by reason of that bounty she was\r\nwhat she was, she could not live and thrive on it longer, coming as it\r\ndid from such a source. Mr. Satterlee might perhaps surmise the truth,\r\nbut the town and village would think her ambition a very natural one,\r\ncertainly no better time could have been chosen to announce it.\r\n\r\n“To teach school.” She was sure now that Mr. Satterlee knew and\r\napproved, and perceived something, at least, of her little ruse. He\r\nwas a man whose talents fitted him for a larger flock than he had at\r\nConiston, but he possessed neither the graces demanded of city ministers\r\nnor the power of pushing himself. Never was a more retiring man. The\r\nyears she had spent in his study had not gone for nothing, for he who\r\nhas cherished the bud can predict what the flower will be, and Mr.\r\nSatterlee knew her spiritually better than any one else in Coniston. He\r\nhad heard of her return, and had walked over to the tannery house, full\r\nof fears, the remembrance of those expressions of simple faith in\r\nJethro coming back to his mind. Had the revelation which he had so long\r\nexpected come at last? and how had she taken it? would it embitter her?\r\nThe good man believed that it would not, and now he saw that it had not,\r\nand rejoiced accordingly.\r\n\r\n“To teach school,” he said. “I expected that you would wish to, Cynthia.\r\nIt is a desire that most of us have, who like books and what is in them.\r\nI should have taught school if I had not become a minister. It is a high\r\ncalling, and an absorbing one, to develop the minds of the young.” Mr.\r\nSatterlee was often a little discursive, though there was reason for\r\nit on this occasion, and Moses Hatch half closed his eyes and bowed his\r\nhead a little out of sheer habit at the sound of the minister's\r\nvoice. But he raised it suddenly at the next words. “I was in Brampton\r\nyesterday, and saw Mr. Graves, who is on the prudential committee of\r\nthat district. You may not have heard that Miss Goddard has left. They\r\nhave not yet succeeded in filling her place, and I think it more than\r\nlikely that you can get it.”\r\n\r\nCynthia glanced at Jethro, but the habit of years was so strong in him\r\nthat he gave no sign.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so, Mr. Satterlee?” she said gratefully. “I had heard of\r\nthe place, and hoped for it, because it is near enough for me to spend\r\nthe Saturdays and Sundays with Uncle Jethro. And I meant to go to\r\nBrampton tomorrow to see about it.”\r\n\r\n“I will go with you,” said the minister; “I have business in Brampton\r\nto-morrow.” He did not mention that this was the business.\r\n\r\nWhen at length they had all departed, Jethro rose and went about the\r\nhouse making fast the doors, as was his custom, while Cynthia sat\r\nstaring through the bars at the dying embers in the stove. He knew now,\r\nand it was inevitable that he should know, what she had made up her mind\r\nto do. It had been decreed that she, who owed him everything, should be\r\nmade to pass this most dreadful of censures upon his whole life. Oh, the\r\ncruelty of that decree!\r\n\r\nHow, she mused, would it affect him? Had the blow been so great that he\r\nwould relinquish those practices which had become a lifelong habit with\r\nhim? Would he (she caught her breath at this thought) would he abandon\r\nthat struggle with Isaac D. Worthington in which he was striving to\r\nmaintain the mastery of the state by those very practices? Cynthia\r\nhated Mr. Worthington. The term is not too strong, and it expresses her\r\nfeeling. But she would have got down on her knees on the board floor\r\nof the kitchen that very night and implored Jethro to desist from that\r\ncontest, if she could. She remembered how, in her innocence, she had\r\nbelieved that the people had given Jethro his power,--in those days when\r\nshe was so proud of that very power,--now she knew that he had wrested\r\nit from them. What more supreme sacrifice could he make than to\r\nrelinquish it! Ah, there was a still greater sacrifice that Jethro was\r\nto make, had she known it.\r\n\r\nHe came and stood over her by the stove, and she looked up into his face\r\nwith these yearnings in her eyes. Yes, she would have thrown herself\r\non her knees, if she could. But she could not. Perhaps he would abandon\r\nthat struggle. Perhaps--perhaps his heart was broken. And could a man\r\nwith a broken heart still fight on? She took his hand and pressed it\r\nagainst her face, and he felt that it was wet with her tears.\r\n\r\n“B-better go to bed now, Cynthy,” he said; “m-must be worn out--m-must\r\nbe worn out.”\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her on the forehead. It was thus that Jethro Bass\r\naccepted his sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, in that Coniston hill-country, it is the western hills which\r\nare red; and a distant hillock on the meadow farm which was soon to be\r\nEden's looked like the daintiest conical cake with pink icing as Cynthia\r\nsurveyed the familiar view the next morning. There was the mountain, the\r\npastures on the lower slopes all red, too, and higher up the dark masses\r\nof bristling spruce and pine and hemlock mottled with white where the\r\nsnow-covered rocks showed through.\r\n\r\nSunrise in January is not very early, and sunrise at any season is not\r\nearly for Coniston. Cynthia sat at her window, and wondered whether that\r\nbeautiful landscape would any longer be hers. Her life had grown up on\r\nit; but now her life had changed. Would the beauty be taken from it,\r\ntoo? Almost hungrily she gazed at the scene. She might look upon it\r\nagain--many times, perhaps--but a conviction was strong in her that its\r\ndaily possession would now be only a memory.\r\n\r\nMr. Satterlee was as good as his word, for he was seated in the stage\r\nwhen it drew up at the tannery house, ready to go to Brampton. And as\r\nthey drove away Cynthia took one last look at Jethro standing on the\r\nporch. It seemed to her that it had been given her to feel all things,\r\nand to know all things: to know, especially, this strange man, Jethro\r\nBass, as none other knew him, and to love him as none other loved him.\r\nThe last severe wrench was come, and she had left him standing there\r\nalone in the cold, divining what was in his heart as though it were in\r\nher own. How worthless was this mighty power which he had gained, how\r\nhateful, when he could not bestow the smallest fragment of it upon one\r\nwhom he loved? Someone has described hell as disqualification in the\r\nface of opportunity. Such was Jethro's torment that morning as he saw\r\nher drive away, the minister in the place where he should have been, at\r\nher side, and he, Jethro Bass, as helpless as though he had indeed been\r\nin the pit among the flames. Had the prudential committee at Brampton\r\npromised the appointment ten times over, he might still have obtained it\r\nfor her by a word. And he must not speak even that word. Who shall say\r\nthat a large part of the punishment of Jethro Bass did not come to him\r\nin the life upon this earth.\r\n\r\nSome such thoughts were running in Cynthia's head as they jingled away\r\nto Brampton that dazzling morning. Perhaps the stage driver, too, who\r\nknew something of men and things and who meddled not at all, had made\r\na guess at the situation. He thought that Cynthia's spirits seemed\r\nlightened a little, and he meant to lighten them more; so he joked as\r\nmuch as his respect for his passengers would permit, and told the news\r\nof Brampton. Not the least of the news concerned the first citizen\r\nof that place. There was a certain railroad in the West which had got\r\nitself much into Congress, and much into the newspapers, and Isaac D.\r\nWorthington had got himself into that railroad: was gone West, it was\r\nsaid on that business, and might not be back for many weeks. And Lem\r\nHallowell remembered when Mr. Worthington was a slim-cheated young\r\nman wandering up and down Coniston Water in search of health. Good Mr.\r\nSatterlee, thinking this a safe subject, allowed himself to be led into\r\na discussion of the first citizen's career, which indeed had something\r\nfascinating in it.\r\n\r\nThus they jingled into Brampton Street and stopped before the cottage of\r\nJudge Graves--a courtesy title. The judge himself came to the door and\r\nbestowed a pronounced bow on the minister, for Mr. Satterlee was honored\r\nin Brampton. Just think of what Ezra Graves might have looked like, and\r\nyou have him. He greeted Cynthia, too, with a warm welcome--for Ezra\r\nGraves,--and ushered them into a best parlor which was reserved for\r\nministers and funerals and great occasions in general, and actually\r\nraised the blinds. Then Mr. Satterlee, with much hemming and hawing,\r\nstated the business which had brought them, while Cynthia looked out of\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves sat and twirled his lean thumbs. He went so far as to say\r\nthat he admired a young woman who scorned to live in idleness, who\r\nwished to impart the learning with which she had been endowed. Fifteen\r\napplicants were under consideration for the position, and the prudential\r\ncommittee had so far been unable to declare that any of them were\r\ncompletely qualified. (It was well named, that prudential committee?)\r\nMr. Graves, furthermore, volunteered that he had expressed a wish to\r\nColonel Prescott (Oh, Ephraim, you too have got a title with your new\r\nhonors!), to Colonel Prescott and others, that Miss Wetherell might take\r\nthe place. The middle term opened on the morrow, and Miss Bruce, of the\r\nWorthington Free Library, had been induced to teach until a successor\r\ncould be appointed, although it was most inconvenient for Miss Bruce.\r\n\r\nCould Miss Wetherell start in at once, provided the committee agreed?\r\nCynthia replied that she would like nothing better. There would be an\r\nexamination before Mr. Errol, the Brampton Superintendent of Schools.\r\nIn short, owing to the pressing nature of the occasion, the judge would\r\ntake the liberty of calling the committee together immediately. Would\r\nMr. Satterlee and Miss Wetherell make themselves at home in the parlor?\r\n\r\nIt very frequently happens that one member of a committee is the brain,\r\nand the other members form the body of it. It was so in this case. Ezra\r\nGraves typified all of prudence there was about it, which, it must be\r\nadmitted, was a great deal. He it was who had weighed in the balance\r\nthe fifteen applicants and found them wanting. Another member of the\r\ncommittee was that comfortable Mr. Dodd, with the tuft of yellow beard,\r\nthe hardware dealer whom we have seen at the baseball game. Mr. Dodd\r\nwas not a person who had opinions unless they were presented to him\r\nfrom certain sources, and then he had been known to cling to them\r\ntenaciously. It is sufficient to add that, when Cynthia Wetherell's name\r\nwas mentioned to him, he remembered the girl to whom Bob Worthington\r\nhad paid such marked attentions on the grand stand. He knew literally\r\nnothing else about Cynthia. Judge Graves, apparently, knew all about\r\nher; this was sufficient, at that time, for Mr. Dodd; he was sick and\r\ntired of the whole affair, and if, by the grace of heaven, an\r\napplicant had been sent who conformed with Judge Graves's multitude of\r\nrequirements, he was devoutly thankful. The other member, Mr. Hill, was\r\na feed and lumber dealer, and not a very good one, for he was always in\r\ndifficulties; certain scholarly attainments were attributed to him,\r\nand therefore he had been put on the committee. They met in Mr. Dodd's\r\nlittle office back of the store, and in five minutes Cynthia was a\r\nschoolmistress, subject to examination by Mr. Errol.\r\n\r\nJust a word about Mr. Errol. He was a retired lawyer, with some means,\r\nwho took an interest in town affairs to occupy his time. He had a very\r\ndelicate wife, whom he had been obliged to send South at the beginning\r\nof the winter. There she had for a while improved, but had been taken\r\nill again, and two days before Cynthia's appointment he had been\r\nsummoned to her bedside by a telegram. Cynthia could go into the school,\r\nand her examination would take place when Mr. Errol returned.\r\n\r\nAll this was explained by the judge when, half an hour after he had left\r\nthem, he returned to the best parlor. Miss Wetherell would, then, be\r\nprepared to take the school the following morning. Whereupon the judge\r\nshook hands with her, and did not deny that he had been instrumental in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n“And, Mr. Satterlee, I am so grateful to you,” said Cynthia, when they\r\nwere in the street once more.\r\n\r\n“My dear Cynthia, I did nothing,” answered the minister, quite\r\nbewildered by the quick turn affairs had taken; “it is your own good\r\nreputation that got you the place.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless Mr. Satterlee had done his share in the matter. He had\r\nknown Mr. Graves for a long time, and better than any other person in\r\nBrampton. Mr. Graves remembered Cynthia Ware, and indeed had spoken to\r\nCynthia that day about her mother. Mr. Graves had also read poor William\r\nWetherell's contributions to the Newcastle Guardian, and he had not read\r\nthat paper since they had ceased. From time to time Mr. Satterlee had\r\nmentioned his pupil to the judge, whose mind had immediately flown to\r\nher when the vacancy occurred. So it all came about.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Mr. Satterlee, “what will you do, Cynthia? We've got\r\nthe good part of a day to arrange where you will live, before the stage\r\nreturns.”\r\n\r\n“I won't go back to-night, I think,” said Cynthia, turning her head\r\naway; “if you would be good enough to tell Uncle Jethro to send my trunk\r\nand some other things.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that is just as well,” assented the minister, understanding\r\nperfectly. “I have thought that Miss Bruce might be glad to board you,”\r\n he continued, after a pause. “Let us go to see her.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Satterlee,” said Cynthia, “would you mind if we went first to see\r\nCousin Ephraim?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course, we must see Ephraim,” said Mr. Satterlee, briskly. So\r\nthey walked on past the mansion of the first citizen, and the new block\r\nof stores which the first citizen had built, to the old brick building\r\nwhich held the Brampton post-office, and right through the door of the\r\npartition into the sanctum of the postmaster himself, which some one had\r\nnicknamed the Brampton Club. On this occasion the postmaster was\r\nseated in his shirt sleeves by the stove, alone, his listeners being\r\nconspicuously absent. Cynthia, who had caught a glimpse of him through\r\nthe little mail-window, thought he looked very happy and comfortable.\r\n\r\n“Great Tecumseh!” he cried,--an exclamation he reserved for\r\nextraordinary occasions, “if it hain't Cynthy!”\r\n\r\nHe started to hobble toward her, but Cynthia ran to him.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, looking at her closely after the greeting was over, “you\r\nbe changed, Cynthy. Mercy, I don't know as I'd have dared done that if\r\nI'd seed you first. What have you b'en doin' to yourself? You must have\r\nseed a whole lot down there in Boston. And you're a full-blown lady,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, I'm not, Cousin Eph,” she answered, trying to smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you be,” he insisted, still scrutinizing her, vainly trying to\r\naccount for the change. Tact, as we know, was not Ephraim's strong\r\npoint. Now he shook his head. “You always was beyond me. Got a sort\r\nof air about you, and it grows on you, too. Wouldn't be surprised,” he\r\ndeclared, speaking now to the minister, “wouldn't be a mite surprised to\r\nsee her in the White House, some day.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Cousin Eph,” said Cynthia, coloring a little, “you mustn't talk\r\nnonsense. What have you done with your coat? You have no business to go\r\nwithout it with your rheumatism.”\r\n\r\n“It hain't b'en so bad since Uncle Sam took me over again, Cynthy,” he\r\nanswered, “with nothin' to do but sort letters in a nice hot room.” The\r\nroom was hot, indeed. “But where did you come from?”\r\n\r\n“I grew tired of being taught, Cousin Eph. I--I've always wanted to\r\nteach. Mr. Satterlee has been with me to see Mr. Graves, and they've\r\ngiven me Miss Goddard's place. I'm coming to Brampton to live, to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Great Tecumseh!” exclaimed Ephraim again, overpowered by the yews. “I\r\nwant to know! What does Jethro say to that?”\r\n\r\n“He--he is willing,” she replied in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Ephraim, “I always thought you'd come to it. It's in the\r\nblood, I guess--teachin'. Your mother had it too. I'm kind of sorry\r\nfor Jethro, though, so I be. But I'm glad for myself, Cynthy. So you're\r\ncomin' to Brampton to live with me!\r\n\r\n“I was going to ask Miss Bruce to take me in,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“No you hain't, anything of the kind,” said Ephraim, indignantly. “I've\r\ngot a little house up the street, and a room all ready for you.”\r\n\r\n“Will you let me share expenses, Cousin Eph?”\r\n\r\n“I'll let you do anything you want,” said he, “so's you come. Don't you\r\nthink she'd ought to come and take care of an old man, Mr. Satterlee?”\r\n\r\nMr. Satterlee turned. He had been contemplating, during this\r\nconversation, a life-size print of General Grant under two crossed\r\nflags, that was hung conspicuously on the wall.\r\n\r\n“I do not think you could do better, Cynthia,” he answered, smiling.\r\nThe minister liked Ephraim, and he liked a little joke, occasionally.\r\nHe felt that one would not be, particularly out of place just now; so he\r\nrepeated, “I do not think you could do better than to accept the offer\r\nof Colonel Prescott.”\r\n\r\nEphraim grew very red, as was his wont when twitted about his new title.\r\nHe took things literally.\r\n\r\n“I hain't a colonel, no more than you be, Mr. Satterlee. But the boys\r\ndown here will have it so.”\r\n\r\nThree days later, by the early train which leaves the state capital at\r\nan unheard-of hour in the morning, a young man arrived in Brampton. His\r\njaw seemed squarer than ever to the citizens who met the train out of\r\ncuriosity, and to Mr. Dodd, who was expecting a pump; and there was a\r\nset look on his face like that of a man who is going into a race or a\r\nfight. Mr. Dodd, though astonished, hastened toward him.\r\n\r\n“Well, this is unexpected, Bob,” said he. “How be you? Harvard College\r\nfailed up?”\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Dodd never let slip a chance to assure a member of the\r\nWorthington family of his continued friendship.\r\n\r\n“How are you, Mr. Dodd?” answered Bob, nodding at him carelessly, and\r\npassing on. Mr. Dodd did not dare to follow. What was young Worthington\r\ndoing in Brampton, and his father in the West on that railroad business?\r\nFilled with curiosity, Mr. Dodd forgot his pump, but Bob was already\r\nstriding into Brampton Street, carrying his bag. If he had stopped for\r\na few moments with the hardware dealer, or chatted with any of the dozen\r\npeople who bowed and stared at him, he might have saved himself a good\r\ndeal of trouble. He turned in at the Worthington mansion, and rang the\r\nbell, which was answered by Sarah, the housemaid.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bob!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Where's Mrs. Holden?” he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Holden was the elderly housekeeper. She had gone, unfortunately,\r\nto visit a bereaved relative; unfortunately for Bob, because she, too,\r\nmight have told him something.\r\n\r\n“Get me some breakfast, Sarah. Anything,” he commanded, “and tell Silas\r\nto hitch up the black trotters to my cutter.”\r\n\r\nSarah, though in consternation, did as she was bid. The breakfast was\r\nforthcoming, and in half an hour Silas had the black trotters at the\r\ndoor. Bob got in without a word, seized the reins, the cutter flew down\r\nBrampton Street (observed by many of the residents thereof) and turned\r\ninto the Coniston road. Silas said nothing. Silas, as a matter of fact,\r\nnever did say anything. He had been the Worthington coachman for five\r\nand twenty years, and he was known in Brampton as Silas the Silent.\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington had no desire to talk that morning.\r\n\r\nThe black trotters covered the ten miles in much quicker time than Lem\r\nHallowell could do it in his stage, but the distance seemed endless to\r\nBob. It was not much more than half an hour after he had left Brampton\r\nStreet, however, that he shot past the store, and by the time Rias\r\nRichardson in his carpet slippers reached the platform the cutter was in\r\nfront of the tannery house, and the trotters, with their sides smoking,\r\nwere pawing up the snow under the butternut tree.\r\n\r\nBob leaped out, hurried up the path, and knocked at the door. It was\r\nopened by Jethro Bass himself!\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Bass,” said the young man, gravely, and he held out\r\nhis hand. Jethro gave him such a scrutinizing look as he had given many\r\na man whose business he cared to guess, but Bob looked fearlessly into\r\nhis eyes. Jethro took his hand.\r\n\r\n“C-come in,” he said.\r\n\r\nBob went into that little room where Jethro and Cynthia had spent so\r\nmany nights together, and his glance flew straight to the picture on the\r\nwall,--the portrait of Cynthia Wetherell in crimson and seed pearls, so\r\nstrangely set amidst such surroundings. His glance went to the portrait,\r\nand his feet followed, as to a lodestone. He stood in front of it for\r\nmany minutes, in silence, and Jethro watched him. At last he turned.\r\n\r\n“Where is she?” he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer question, and Jethro's answer was quite as lacking in\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n“G-gone to Brampton--gone to Brampton.”\r\n\r\n“Gone to Brampton! Do you mean to say--? What is she doing there?” Bob\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n“Teachin' school,” said Jethro; “g-got Miss Goddard's place.”\r\n\r\nBob did not reply for a moment. The little schoolhouse was the only\r\nbuilding in Brampton he had glanced at as he came through. Mrs. Merrill\r\nhad told him that she might take that place, but he had little imagined\r\nshe was already there on her platform facing the rows of shining little\r\nfaces at the desks. He had deemed it more than possible that he might\r\nsee Jethro at Coniston, but he had not taken into account that which he\r\nmight say to him. Bob had, indeed, thought of nothing but Cynthia,\r\nand of the blow that had fallen upon her. He had tried to realize the\r\nmultiple phases of the situation which confronted him. Here was the man\r\nwho, by the conduct of his life, had caused the blow; he, too, was her\r\nbenefactor; and again, this same man was engaged in the bitterest\r\nof conflicts with his father, Isaac D. Worthington, and it was this\r\nconflict which had precipitated that blow. Bob could not have guessed,\r\nby looking at Jethro Bass, how great was the sorrow which had fallen\r\nupon him. But Bob knew that Jethro hated his father, must hate him now,\r\nbecause of Cynthia, with a hatred given to few men to feel. He thought\r\nthat Jethro would crush Mr. Worthington and ruin him if he could; and\r\nBob believed he could.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to say? He did not fear Jethro, for Bob Worthington had\r\ncourage enough; but these things were running in his mind, and he felt\r\nthe power of the man before him, as all men did. Bob went to the window\r\nand came back again. He knew that he must speak.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass,” he said at last, “did Cynthia ever mention me to you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass, I love her. I have told her so, and I have asked her to be my\r\nwife.”\r\n\r\nThere was no need, indeed, to have told Jethro this. The shock of that\r\nrevelation had come to him when he had seen the trotters, had been\r\nconfirmed when the young man had stood before the portrait. Jethro's\r\nface might have twitched when Bob stood there with his back to him.\r\n\r\nJethro could not speak. Once more there had come to him a moment when\r\nhe would not trust his voice to ask a question. He dreaded the answer,\r\nthough none might have surmised this. He knew Cynthia. He knew that,\r\nwhen she had given her heart, it was for all time. He dreaded the\r\nanswer; because it might mean that her sorrow was doubled.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” Bob continued painfully, seeing that Jethro would say\r\nnothing, “I believe that Cynthia loves me. I should not dare to say it\r\nor to hope it, without reason. She has not said so, but--” the words\r\nwere very hard for him, yet he stuck manfully to the truth; “but she\r\ntold me to write to my father and let him know what I had done, and not\r\nto come back to her until I had his answer. This,” he added, wondering\r\nthat a man could listen to such a thing without a sign, “this was\r\nbefore--before she had any idea of coming home.”\r\n\r\nYes, Cynthia, did love him. There was no doubt about it in Jethro's\r\nmind. She would not have bade Bob write to his father if she had not\r\nloved him. Still Jethro did not speak, but by some intangible force\r\ncompelled Bob to go on.\r\n\r\n“I shall write to my father as soon as he comes back from the West, but\r\nI wish to say to you, Mr. Bass, that whatever his answer contains, I\r\nmean to marry Cynthia. Nothing can shake me from that resolution. I tell\r\nyou this because my father is fighting you, and you know what he will\r\nsay.” (Jethro knew Dudley Worthington well enough to appreciate that\r\nthis would make no particular difference in his opposition to the\r\nmarriage except to make that opposition more vehement.) “And because you\r\ndo not know me,” continued Bob. “When I say a thing, I mean it. Even if\r\nmy father cuts me off and casts me out, I will marry Cynthia. Good-by,\r\nMr. Bass.”\r\n\r\nJethro took the young man's hand again. Bob imagined that he even\r\npressed it--a little--something he had never done before.\r\n\r\n“Good-by, Bob.”\r\n\r\nBob got as far as the door.\r\n\r\n“Er--go back to Harvard, Bob?”\r\n\r\n“I intend to, Mr. Bass.”\r\n\r\n“Er--Bob?”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“D-don't quarrel with your father--don't quarrel with your father.”\r\n\r\n“I shan't be the one to quarrel, Mr. Bass.”\r\n\r\n“Bob--hain't you pretty young--pretty young?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bob, rather unexpectedly, “I am.” Then he added, “I know my\r\nown mind.”\r\n\r\n“P-pretty young. Don't want to get married yet awhile--do you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” said Bob, “but I suppose I shan't be able to.”\r\n\r\n“Er--wait awhile, Bob. Go back to Harvard. W-wouldn't write that letter\r\nif I was you.”\r\n\r\n“But I will. I'll not have him think I'm ashamed of what I've done. I'm\r\nproud of it, Mr. Bass.”\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of Coniston, which had been waiting for his reappearance,\r\nBob Worthington jumped into the sleigh and drove off. He left behind him\r\nJethro Bass, who sat in his chair the rest of the morning with his\r\nhead bent in revery so deep that Millicent had to call him twice to his\r\nsimple dinner. Bob left behind him, too, a score of rumors, sprung full\r\ngrown into life with his visit. Men and women an incredible distance\r\naway heard them in an incredible time: those in the village found an\r\nimmediate pretext for leaving their legitimate occupation and going\r\nto the store, and a gathering was in session there when young Mr.\r\nWorthington drove past it on his way back. Bob thought little about the\r\nrumors, and not thinking of them it did not occur to him that they might\r\naffect Cynthia. The only person then in Coniston whom he thought\r\nabout was Jethro Bass. Bob decided that his liking for Jethro had not\r\ndiminished, but rather increased; he admired Jethro for the advice he\r\nhad given, although he did not mean to take it. And for the first time\r\nhe pitied him.\r\n\r\nBob did not know that rumor, too, was spreading in Brampton. He had his\r\ndinner in the big walnut dining room all alone, and after it he smoked\r\nhis father's cigars and paced up and down the big hall, watching the\r\nclock. For he could not go to her in the school hours. At length he\r\nput on his hat and hurried out, crossing the park-like enclosure in the\r\nmiddle of the street; bowed at by Mr. Dodd, who always seemed to be on\r\nhand, and others, and nodding absently in return. Concealment was not\r\nin Bob Worthington's nature. He reached the post-office, where the\r\npartition door was open, and he walked right into a comparatively full\r\nmeeting of the Brampton Club. Ephraim sat in their midst, and for once\r\nhe was not telling war stories. He was silent. And the others fell\r\nsuddenly silent, too, at Bob's entrance.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Prescott?” he said, as Ephraim struggled to his\r\nfeet. “How is the rheumatism?”\r\n\r\n“How be you, Mr. Worthington?” said Ephraim; “this is a kind of a\r\nsurprise, hain't it?” Ephraim was getting used to surprises. “Well, it\r\nis good-natured of you to come in and shake hands with an old soldier.”\r\n\r\n“Don't mention it, Mr. Prescott,” answered honest Bob, a little abashed,\r\n“I should have done so anyway, but the fact is, I wanted to speak to you\r\na moment in private.”\r\n\r\n“Certain,” said Ephraim, glancing helplessly around him, “jest come out\r\nfront.” That space, where the public were supposed to be, was the\r\nonly private place in the Brampton post-office. But the members of the\r\nBrampton Club could take a hint, and with one consent began to make\r\nexcuses. Bob knew them all from boyhood and spoke to them all. Some of\r\nthem ventured to ask him if Harvard had bust up.\r\n\r\n“Where does Cynthia-live?” he demanded, coming straight to the point.\r\n\r\nEphraim stared at him for a moment in a bewildered fashion, and then a\r\nlight began to dawn on him.\r\n\r\n“Lives with me,” he answered. He was quite as ashamed, for Bob's sake,\r\nas if he himself had asked the question, and he went on talking to cover\r\nthat embarrassment. “It's made some difference, too, sence she come.\r\nHouse looks like a different place. Afore she, come I cooked with a\r\nkit, same as I used to in the harness shop. I l'arned it in the army.\r\nCynthy's got a stove.”\r\n\r\nIt was not the way Ephraim would have gone about a love affair, had he\r\nhad one. Sam Price's were the approved methods in that section of the\r\ncountry, though Sam had overdone them somewhat. It was an unheard-of\r\nthing to ask a man right out like that where a girl lived.\r\n\r\n“Much obliged,” said Bob, and was gone. Ephraim raised his hands in\r\ndespair, and hobbled to the little window to get a last look at him.\r\nWhere were the proprieties in these days? The other aspect of the\r\naffair, what Mr. Worthington would think of it when he returned, did not\r\noccur to the innocent mind of the old soldier until people began to\r\ntalk about it that afternoon. Then it worried him into another attack of\r\nrheumatism.\r\n\r\nHalf of Brampton must have seen Bob Worthington march up to the little\r\nyellow house which Ephraim had rented from John Billings. It had four\r\nrooms around the big chimney in the middle, and that was all. Simple as\r\nit was, an architect would have said that its proportions were nearly\r\nperfect. John Billings had it from his Grandfather Post, who built\r\nit, and though Brampton would have laughed at the statement, Isaac D.\r\nWorthington's mansion was not to be compared with it for beauty. The\r\nold cherry furniture was still in it, and the old wall papers and the\r\npanelling in the little room to the right which Cynthia had made into a\r\nsitting room.\r\n\r\nHalf of Brampton, too, must have seen Cynthia open the door and Bob walk\r\ninto the entry. Then the door was shut. But it had been held open for\r\nan appreciable time, however,--while you could count twenty,--because\r\nCynthia had not the power to close it. For a while she could only look\r\ninto his eyes, and he into hers. She had not seen him coming, she had\r\nbut answered the knock. Then, slowly, the color came into her cheeks,\r\nand she knew that she was trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he said, “mayn't I come in?”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, for fear her voice would tremble, too. And she could\r\nnot send him away in the face of all Brampton. She opened the door a\r\nlittle wider, a very little, and he went in. Then she closed it, and for\r\na moment they stood facing each other in the entry, which was lighted\r\nonly by the fan-light over the door, Cynthia with her back against the\r\nwall. He spoke her name again, his voice thick with the passion which\r\nhad overtaken him like a flood at the sight of her--a passion to seize\r\nher in his arms, and cherish and comfort and protect her forever and\r\never. All this he felt and more as he looked into her face and saw the\r\ntraces of her great sorrow there. He had not thought that that face\r\ncould be more beautiful in its strength and purity, but it was even so.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia-my love!” he cried, and raised his arms. But a look as of\r\na great fear came into her eyes, which for one exquisite moment had\r\nyielded to his own; and her breath came quickly, as though she were\r\nspent--as indeed she was. So far spent that the wall at her back was\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\n“No!” she said; “no--you must not--you must not--you must not!” Again\r\nand again she repeated the words, for she could summon no others. They\r\nwere a mandate--had he guessed it--to herself as to him. For the time\r\nher brain refused its functions, and she could think of nothing but the\r\nfact that he was there, beside her, ready to take her in his arms. How\r\nshe longed to fly into them, none but herself knew--to fly into them as\r\ninto a refuge secure against the evil powers of the world. It was not\r\nreason that restrained her then, but something higher in her, that\r\nrestrained him likewise. Without moving from the wall she pushed open\r\nthe door of the sitting room.\r\n\r\n“Go in there,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe went in as she bade him and stood before the flickering logs in the\r\nwide and shallow chimney-place--logs that seemed to burn on the very\r\nhearth itself, and yet the smoke rose unerring into the flue. No stove\r\nhad ever desecrated that room. Bob looked into the flames and waited,\r\nand Cynthia stood in the entry fighting this second great battle which\r\nhad come upon her while her forces were still spent with that other one.\r\nWoman in her very nature is created to be sheltered and protected; and\r\nthe yearning in her, when her love is given, is intense as nature itself\r\nto seek sanctuary in that love. So it was with Cynthia leaning against\r\nthe entry wall, her arms full length in front of her, and her hands\r\nclasped as she prayed for strength to withstand the temptation. At last\r\nshe grew calmer, though her breath still came deeply, and she went into\r\nthe sitting room.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he knew, vaguely, why she had not followed him at once. He had\r\ngrown calmer himself, calmer with that desperation which comes to a man\r\nof his type when his soul and body are burning with desire for a woman.\r\nHe knew that he would have to fight for her with herself. He knew now\r\nthat she was too strong in her position to be carried by storm, and the\r\ninterval had given him time to collect himself. He did not dare at\r\nfirst to look up from the logs, for fear he should forget himself and be\r\ndefeated instantly.\r\n\r\n“I have been to Coniston, Cynthia,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I have been to Coniston this morning, and I have seen Mr. Bass, and I\r\nhave told him that I love you, and that I will never give you up. I\r\ntold you so in Boston, Cynthia,” he said; “I knew that this this trouble\r\nwould come to you. I would have given my life to have saved you from\r\nit--from the least part of it. I would have given my life to have been\r\nable to say 'it shall not touch you.' I saw it flowing in like a great\r\nsea between you and me, and yet I could not tell you of it. I could not\r\nprepare you for it. I could only tell you that I would never give you\r\nup, and I can only repeat that now.”\r\n\r\n“You must, Bob,” she answered, in a voice so low that it was almost a\r\nwhisper; “you must give me up.”\r\n\r\n“I would not,” he said, “I would not if the words were written on all\r\nthe rocks of Coniston Mountain. I love you.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” she said gently. “I have to say some things to you. They will be\r\nvery hard to say, but you must listen to them.”\r\n\r\n“I will listen,” he said doggedly; “but they will not affect my\r\ndetermination.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure you do not wish to drive me away from Brampton,” she\r\ncontinued, in the same low voice, “when I have found a place to earn my\r\nliving near-near Uncle Jethro.”\r\n\r\nThese words told him all he had suspected--almost as much as though he\r\nhad been present at the scene in the tannery shed in Coniston. She knew\r\nnow the life of Jethro Bass, but he was still “Uncle Jethro” to her. It\r\nwas even as Bob had supposed,--that her affection once given could not\r\nbe taken away.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he said, “I would not by an act or a word annoy or trouble\r\nyou. If you bade me, I would go to the other side of the world\r\nto-morrow. You must know that. But I should come back again. You must\r\nknow, that, too. I should come back again for you.”\r\n\r\n“Bob,” she said again, and her voice faltered a very little now, “you\r\nmust know that I can never be your wife.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know it,” he exclaimed, interrupting her vehemently, “I will\r\nnot know it.”\r\n\r\n“Think,” she said, “think! I must say what I, have to say, however it\r\nhurts me. If it had not been for--for your father, those things never\r\nwould have been written. They were in his newspaper, and they express\r\nhis feelings toward--toward Uncle Jethro.”\r\n\r\nOnce the words were out, she marvelled that she had found the courage to\r\npronounce them.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “yes, I know that, but listen--”\r\n\r\n“Wait,” she went on, “wait until I have finished. I am not speaking of\r\nthe pain I had when I read these things, I--I am not speaking of the\r\ntruth that may be in them--I have learned from them what I should have\r\nknown before, and felt, indeed, that your father will never consent\r\nto--to a marriage between us.”\r\n\r\n“And if he does not,” cried Bob, “if he does not, do you think that I\r\nwill abide by what he says, when my life's happiness depends upon you,\r\nand my life's welfare? I know that you are a good woman, and a true\r\nwoman, that you will be the best wife any man could have. Though he is\r\nmy father, he shall not deprive me of my soul, and he shall not take my\r\nlife away from me.”\r\n\r\nAs Cynthia listened she thought that never had words sounded sweeter\r\nthan these--no, and never would again. So she told herself as she let\r\nthem run into her heart to be stored among the treasures there. She\r\nbelieved in his love--believed in it now with all her might. (Who,\r\nindeed, would not?) She could not demean herself now by striving to\r\nbelittle it or doubt its continuance, as she had in Boston. He was\r\nyoung, yes; but he would never be any older than this, could never love\r\nagain like this. So much was given her, ought she not to be content?\r\nCould she expect more?\r\n\r\nShe understood Isaac Worthington, now, as well as his son understood\r\nhim. She knew that, if she were to yield to Bob Worthington, his father\r\nwould disown and disinherit him. She looked ahead into the years as a\r\nwoman will, and allowed herself for the briefest of moments to wonder\r\nwhether any happiness could thrive in spite of the violence of that\r\nschism--any happiness for him. She would be depriving him of his\r\nbirthright, and it may be that those who are born without birthrights\r\noften value them the most. Cynthia saw these things, and more, for\r\nthose who sit at the feet of sorrow soon learn the world's ways. She saw\r\nherself pointed out as the woman whose designs had beggared and ruined\r\nhim in his youth, and (agonizing and revolting thought!) the name of one\r\nwould be spoken from whom she had learned such craft. Lest he see the\r\nscalding tears in her eyes, she turned away and conquered them. What\r\ncould she do? Where should she hide her love that it might not be seen\r\nof men? And how, in truth, could she tell him these things?\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” he went on, seeing that she did not answer, and taking heart,\r\n“I will not say a word against my father. I know you would not respect\r\nme if I did. We are different, he and I, and find happiness in different\r\nways.” Bob wondered if his father had ever found it. “If I had never\r\nmet you and loved you, I should have refused to lead the life my father\r\nwishes me to lead. It is not in me to do the things he will ask. I shall\r\nhave to carve out my own life, and I feel that I am as well able to do\r\nit as he was. Percy Broke, a classmate of mine and my best friend, has\r\na position for me in a locomotive works in which his father is largely\r\ninterested. We are going in together, the day after we graduate; it is\r\nall arranged, and his father has agreed. I shall work very hard, and\r\nin a few years, Cynthia, we shall be together, never to part again. Oh,\r\nCynthia,” he cried, carried away by the ecstasy of this dream which he\r\nhad, summoned up, “why do you resist me? I love you as no man has ever\r\nloved,” he exclaimed, with scornful egotism and contempt of those who\r\nhad made the world echo with that cry through the centuries, “and you\r\nlove me! Ah, do you think I do not see it--cannot feel it? You love\r\nme--tell me so.”\r\n\r\nHe was coming toward her, and how was she to prevent his taking her by\r\nstorm? That was his way, and well she knew it. In her dreams she had\r\nfelt herself lifted and borne off, breathless in his arms, to Elysium.\r\nHer breath was going now, her strength was going, and yet she made him\r\npause by the magic of a word. A concession was in that word, but one\r\ncould not struggle so piteously and concede nothing.\r\n\r\n“Bob,” she said, “do you love me?”\r\n\r\nLove her! If there was a love that acknowledged no bounds, that was\r\nconfined by no superlatives, it was his. He began to speak, but she\r\ninterrupted him with a wild passion that was new to her. As he sat in\r\nthe train on his way back to Cambridge through the darkening afternoon,\r\nthe note of it rang in his ears and gave him hope--yes, and through many\r\nmonths afterward.\r\n\r\n“If you love me I beg, I implore, I beseech you in the name of that\r\nlove--for your sake and my sake, to leave me. Oh, can you not see why\r\nyou must go?”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, even as he had before in the parlor in Mount Vernon Street.\r\nHe could but stop in the face of such an appeal--and yet the blood beat\r\nin his head with a mad joy.\r\n\r\n“Tell me that you love me,--once,” he cried,--“once, Cynthia.”\r\n\r\n“Do-do not ask me,” she faltered. “Go.”\r\n\r\nHer words were a supplication, not a command. And in that they were a\r\nsupplication he had gained a victory. Yes, though she had striven with\r\nall her might to deny, she had bade him hope. He left her without so\r\nmuch as a touch of the hand, because she had wished it. And yet she\r\nloved him! Incredible fact! Incredible conjury which made him doubt that\r\nhis feet touched the snow of Brampton Street, which blotted, as with a\r\ngolden glow, the faces and the houses of Brampton from his sight. He saw\r\nno one, though many might have accosted him. That part of him which was\r\nclay, which performed the menial tasks of his being, had kindly taken\r\nupon itself to fetch his bag from the house to the station, and to board\r\nthe train.\r\n\r\nAh, but Brampton had seen him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nGreat events, like young Mr. Worthington's visit to Brampton, are all\r\nvery well for a while, but they do not always develop with sufficient\r\nrapidity to satisfy the audiences of the drama. Seven days were an\r\ninterlude quite long enough in which to discuss every phase and bearing\r\nof this opening scene, and after that the play in all justice ought to\r\nmove on. But there it halted--for a while--and the curtain obstinately\r\nrefused to come up. If the inhabitants of Brampton had only known that\r\nthe drama, when it came, would be well worth waiting for, they might\r\nhave been less restless.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enrich the pages of this folio with all the\r\nfootnotes and remarks of, the sages of Brampton. These can be condensed\r\ninto a paragraph of two--and we can ring up the curtain when we like\r\non the next scene, for which Brampton had to wait considerably over a\r\nmonth. There is to be no villain in this drama with the face of an Abbe\r\nMaury like the seven cardinal sins. Comfortable looking Mr. Dodd of the\r\nprudential committee, with his chin-tuft of yellow beard, is cast for\r\nthe part of the villain, but will play it badly; he would have been\r\nbetter suited to a comedy part.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington left Brampton on the five o'clock train, and at\r\nsix Mr. Dodd met his fellow-member of the committee, Judge Graves.\r\n\r\n“Called a meetin'?” asked Mr. Dodd, pulling the yellow tuft.\r\n\r\n“What for?” said the judge, sharply.\r\n\r\n“What be you a-goin' to do about it?” said Mr. Dodd.\r\n\r\n“Do about what?” demanded the judge, looking at the hardware dealer from\r\nunder his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd knew well enough that this was not ignorance on the part of Mr.\r\nGraves, whose position in the matter dad been very well defined in\r\nthe two sentences he had spoken. Mr. Dodd perceived that the judge\r\nwas trying to get him to commit himself, and would then proceed to\r\nannihilate him. He, Levi Dodd, had no intention of walking into such a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, with a final tug at the tuft, “if that's the way you\r\nfeel about it.”\r\n\r\n“Feel about what?” said the judge, fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Callate you know best,” said Mr. Dodd, and passed on up the street. But\r\nhe felt the judge's gimlet eyes boring holes in his back. The judge's\r\nposition was very fine, no doubt for the judge. All of which tends to\r\nshow that Levi Dodd had swept his mind, and that it was ready now for\r\nthe reception of an opinion.\r\n\r\nSix weeks or more, as has been said, passed before the curtain rose\r\nagain, but the snarling trumpets of the orchestra played a fitting\r\nprelude. Cynthia's feelings and Cynthia's life need not be gone into\r\nduring this interval knowing her character, they may well be imagined.\r\nThey were trying enough, but Brampton had no means of guessing them.\r\nDuring the weeks she came and went between the little house and the\r\nlittle school, putting all the strength that was in her into her duties.\r\nThe Prudential Committee, which sometimes sat on the platform, could\r\nfind no fault with the performance of these duties, or with the\r\ncapability of the teacher, and it is not going too far to state that the\r\nchildren grew to love her better than Miss Goddard had been loved. It\r\nmay be declared that children are the fittest citizens of a republic,\r\nbecause they are apt to make up their own minds on any subject without\r\nregard to public opinion. It was so with the scholars of Brampton\r\nvillage lower school: they grew to love the new teacher, careless of\r\nwhat the attitude of their elders might be, and some of them could have\r\nbeen seen almost any day walking home with her down the street.\r\n\r\nAs for the attitude of the elders--there was none. Before assuming one\r\nthey had thought it best, with characteristic caution, to await the next\r\nact in the drama. There were ladies in Brampton whose hearts prompted\r\nthem, when they called on the new teacher, to speak a kindly word of\r\nwarning and advice; but somehow, when they were seated before her in\r\nthe little sitting room of the John Billings house, their courage\r\nfailed them. There was something about this daughter of the Coniston\r\nstorekeeper and ward of Jethro Bass that made them pause. So much for\r\nthe ladies of Brampton. What they said among themselves would fill a\r\nchapter, and more.\r\n\r\nThere was, at this time, a singular falling-off in the attendance of the\r\nBrampton Club. Ephraim sat alone most of the day in his Windsor chair\r\nby the stove, pretending to read newspapers. But he did not mention this\r\nfact to Cynthia. He was more lonesome than ever on the Saturdays and\r\nSundays which she spent with Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass! It is he who might be made the theme of the music of the\r\nsnarling trumpets. What was he about during those six weeks? That is\r\nwhat the state at large was beginning to wonder, and the state at large\r\nwas looking on at a drama, too. A rumor reached the capital and radiated\r\nthence to every city and town and hamlet, and was followed by other\r\nrumors like confirmations. Jethro Bass, for the first time in a long\r\nlife of activity, was inactive: inactive, too, at this most critical\r\nperiod of his career, the climax of it, with a war to be waged which for\r\nbitterness and ferocity would have no precedent; with the town meetings\r\nat hand, where the frontier fighting was to be done, and no quarter\r\ngiven. Lieutenants had gone to Coniston for further orders and\r\ninstructions, and had come back without either. Achilles was sulking in\r\nthe tannery house--some said a broken Achilles. Not a word could be got\r\nout of him, or the sign of an intention. Jake Wheeler moped through the\r\ndays in Rias Richardson's store, too sore at heart to speak to any man,\r\nand could have wept if tears had been a relief to him. No more blithe\r\nerrands over the mountain to Clovelly and elsewhere, though Jake\r\nknew the issue now and itched for the battle, and the vassals of\r\nthe hill-Rajah under a jubilant Bijah Bixby were arming cap-a-pie.\r\nLieutenant-General-and-Senator Peleg Hartington of Brampton, in his\r\noffice over the livery stable, shook his head like a mournful stork\r\nwhen questioned by brother officers from afar. Operations were at a\r\nstandstill, and the sinews of war relaxed. Rural givers of mortgages,\r\nwho had not had the opportunity of selling them or had feared to do\r\nso, began (mirabile dictu) to express opinions. Most ominous sign of\r\nall--the proprietor of the Pelican Hotel had confessed that the Throne\r\nRoom had not been engaged for the coming session.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that Jethro Bass lay crushed under the weight of the\r\naccusations which had been printed, and were still being printed, in\r\nthe Newcastle Guardian? He did not answer them, or retaliate in other\r\nnewspapers, but Jethro Bass had never made use of newspapers in this\r\nway. Still, nothing ever printed about him could be compared with those\r\narticles. Had remorse suddenly overtaken him in his old age? Such were\r\nthe questions people we're asking all over the state--people, at least,\r\nwho were interested in politics, or in those operations which went\r\nby the name of politics: yes, and many private citizens--who had\r\nparticipated in politics only to the extent of voting for such\r\ncandidates as Jethro in his wisdom had seen fit to give them, read the\r\narticles and began to say that boss domination was at an end. A new era\r\nwas at hand, which they fondly (and very properly) believed was to be\r\na golden era. It was, indeed, to be a golden era--until things got\r\nworking; and then the gold would cease. The Newcastle Guardian, with\r\nunconscious irony, proclaimed the golden era; and declared that its\r\ncolumns, even in other days and under other ownership, had upheld the\r\nwisdom of Jethro Bass. And he was still a wise man, said the Guardian,\r\nfor he had had sense enough to give up the fight.\r\n\r\nHad he given up the fight? Cynthia fervently hoped and prayed that he\r\nhad, but she hoped and prayed in silence. Well she knew, if the event in\r\nthe tannery shed had not made him abandon his affairs, no appeal could\r\ndo so. Her happiest days in this period were the Saturdays and Sundays\r\nspent with him in Coniston, and as the weeks went by she began to\r\nbelieve that the change, miraculous as it seemed, had indeed taken\r\nplace. He had given up his power. It was a pleasure that made the weeks\r\nbearable for her. What did it matter--whether he had made the sacrifice\r\nfor the sake of his love for her? He had made it.\r\n\r\nOn these Saturdays and Sundays they went on long drives together over\r\nthe hills, while she talked to him of her life in Brampton or the books\r\nshe was reading, and of those she had chosen for him to read. Sometimes\r\nthey did not turn homeward until the delicate tracery of the branches\r\non the snow warned them of the rising moon. Jethro was often silent for\r\nhours at a time, but it seemed to Cynthia that it was the silence of\r\npeace--of a peace he had never known before. There came no newspapers\r\nto the tannery house now: during the mid-week he read the books of which\r\nshe had spoken William Wetherell's books; or sat in thought, counting,\r\nperhaps; the days until she should come again. And the boy of those\r\ndays for him was more pathetic than much that is known to the world as\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd what did Coniston think? Coniston, indeed, knew not what to think,\r\nwhen, little by little, the great men ceased to drive up to the door of\r\nthe tannery house, and presently came no more. Coniston sank then from\r\nits proud position as the real capital of the state to a lonely hamlet\r\namong the hills. Coniston, too, was watching the drama, and had had a\r\nbetter view of the stage than Brampton, and saw some reason presently\r\nfor the change in Jethro Bass. Not that Mr. Satterlee told, but such\r\nevidence was bound, in the end, to speak for itself. The Newcastle\r\nGuardian had been read and debated at the store--debated with some heat\r\nby Chester Perkins and other mortgagors; discussed, nevertheless, in a\r\npolitical rather than a moral light. Then Cynthia had returned home;\r\nher face had awed them by its sorrow, and she had begun to earn her own\r\nliving. Then the politicians had ceased to come. The credit belongs to\r\nRias Richardson for hawing been the first to piece these three facts\r\ntogether, causing him to burn his hand so severely on the stove that\r\nhe had to carry it bandaged in soda for a week. Cynthia Wetherell had\r\nreformed Jethro.\r\n\r\nThough the village loved and revered Cynthia, Coniston as a whole did\r\nnot rejoice in that reform. The town had fallen from its mighty estate,\r\nand there were certain envious ones who whispered that it had remained\r\nfor a young girl who had learned city ways to twist Jethro around\r\nher finger; that she had made him abandon his fight with Isaac D.\r\nWorthington because Mr. Worthington had a son--but there is no use\r\nwriting such scandal. Stripped of his power--even though he stripped\r\nhimself--Jethro began to lose their respect, a trait tending to prove\r\nthat the human race may have had wolves for ancestors as well as apes.\r\nPeople had small opportunity, however, of showing a lack of respect to\r\nhis person, for in these days he noticed no one and spoke to none.\r\n\r\nWhen the lion is crippled, the jackals begin to range. A jackal\r\nreconnoitered the lair to see how badly the lion was crippled, and\r\nconceived with astounding insolence the plan of capturing the lion's\r\nquarry. This jackal, who was an old one, well knew how to round up a\r\nquarry, and fled back over the hills to consult with a bigger jackal,\r\nhis master. As a result, two days before March town-meeting day, Mr.\r\nBijah Bixby paid a visit to the Harwich bank and went among certain\r\nConiston farmers looking over the sheep, his clothes bulging out in\r\nplaces when he began, and seemingly normal enough when he had finished.\r\nHistory repeats itself, even among lions and jackals. Thirty-six\r\nyears before there had been a town-meeting in Coniston and a surprise.\r\nEstablished Church, decent and orderly selectmen and proceedings\r\nhad been toppled over that day, every outlying farm sending its\r\nrepresentative through the sleet to do it. And now retribution was at\r\nhand. This March-meeting day was mild, the grass showing a green color\r\non the south slopes where the snow had melted, and the outlying farmers\r\ndrove through mud-holes up to the axles. Drove, albeit, in procession\r\nalong the roads, grimly enough, and the sheds Jock Hallowell had built\r\naround the meeting-house could not hold the horses; they lined the\r\nfences and usurped the hitching posts of the village street, and still\r\nthey came. Their owners trooped with muddy boots into the meeting-house,\r\nand when the moderator rapped for order the Chairman of the Board of\r\nSelectmen, Jethro Bass, was not in his place; never, indeed, would be\r\nthere again. Six and thirty years he had been supreme in that town--long\r\nenough for any man. The beams and king posts would know him no more. Mr.\r\nAmos Cuthbert was elected Chairman, not without a gallant and desperate\r\nbut unsupported fight of a minority led by Mr. Jake Wheeler, whose\r\nloyalty must be taken as a tribute to his species. Farmer Cuthbert was\r\nelected, and his mortgage was not foreclosed! Had it been, there was\r\nmore money in the Harwich bank.\r\n\r\nThere was no telegraph to Coniston in these days, and so Mr. Sam Price,\r\nwith his horse in a lather, might have been seen driving with unseemly\r\nhaste toward Brampton, where in due time he arrived. Half an hour later\r\nthere was excitement at Newcastle, sixty-five miles away, in the office\r\nof the Guardian, and the next morning the excitement had spread over the\r\nwhole state.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass was dethroned in Coniston--discredited in his own town!\r\n\r\nAnd where was Jethro? Did his heart ache, did he bow his head as\r\nhe thought of that supremacy, so hardly won, so superbly held, gone\r\nforever? Many were the curious eyes on the tannery house that day, and\r\nfor days after, but its owner gave no signs of concern. He read and\r\nthought and chopped wood in the tannery shed as usual. Never, I believe,\r\ndid man, shorn of power, accept his lot more quietly. His struggle was\r\nover, his battle was fought, a greater peace than he had ever thought to\r\nhope for was won. For the opinion and regard of the world he had never\r\ncared. A greater reward awaited him, greater than any knew--the opinion\r\nand regard and the praise of one whom he loved beyond all the world. On\r\nFriday she came to him, on Friday at sunset, for the days were growing\r\nlonger, and that was the happiest sunset of his life. She said nothing\r\nas she raised her face to his and kissed him and clung to him in the\r\nlittle parlor, but he knew, and he had his reward. So much for earthly\r\npower Cynthia brought the little rawhide trunk this time, and came to\r\nConiston for the March vacation--a happy two weeks that was soon gone.\r\nHappy by comparison, that is, with what they both had suffered, and a\r\nhaven of rest after the struggle and despair of the wilderness. The bond\r\nbetween them had, in truth, never been stronger, for both the young girl\r\nand the old man had denied themselves the thing they held most dear.\r\nJethro had taken refuge and found comfort in his love. But Cynthia! Her\r\ngreatest love had now been bestowed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf there were letters for the tannery house, Milly Skinner, who made it\r\na point to meet the stage, brought them. And there were letters during\r\nCynthia's sojourn,--many of them, bearing the Cambridge postmark. One\r\nevening it was Jethro who laid the letter on the table beside her as she\r\nsat under the lamp. He did not look at her or speak, but she felt that\r\nhe knew her secret--felt that he deserved to have from her own lips what\r\nhe had been too proud--yes--and too humble to ask. Whose sympathy\r\ncould she be sure of, if not of his? Still she had longed to keep this\r\ntreasure to herself. She took the letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n“I do not answer them, Uncle Jethro, but--I cannot prevent his writing\r\nthem,” she faltered. She did not confess that she kept them, every one,\r\nand read them over and over again; that she had grown, indeed, to look\r\nforward to them as to a sustenance. “I--I do love him, but I will not\r\nmarry him.”\r\n\r\nYes, she could be sure of Jethro's sympathy, though he could not express\r\nit in words. Yet she had not told him for this. She had told him, much\r\nas the telling had hurt her, because she feared to cut him more deeply\r\nby her silence.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible moment for Jethro, and never had he desired the gift\r\nof speech as now. Had it not been for him; Cynthia might have been\r\nRobert Worthington's wife. He sat down beside her and put his hand over\r\nhers that lay on the letter in her lap. It was the only answer he could\r\nmake, but perhaps it was the best, after all. Of what use were words at\r\nsuch a time!\r\n\r\nFour days afterward, on a Monday morning, she went back to Brampton to\r\nbegin the new term.\r\n\r\nThat same Monday a circumstance of no small importance took place in\r\nBrampton--nothing less than the return, after a prolonged absence in the\r\nWest and elsewhere, of its first citizen. Isaac D. Worthington was again\r\nin residence. No bells were rung, indeed, and no delegation of citizens\r\nas such, headed by the selectmen, met him at the station; and\r\nother feudal expressions of fealty were lacking. No staff flew Mr.\r\nWorthington's arms; nevertheless the lord of Brampton was in his castle\r\nagain, and Brampton felt that he was there. He arrived alone, wearing\r\nthe silk hat which had become habitual with him now, and stepping into\r\nhis barouche at the station had been driven up Brampton Street behind\r\nhis grays, looking neither to the right nor left. His reddish chop\r\nwhiskers seemed to cling a little more closely to his face than\r\nformerly, and long years of compression made his mouth look sterner\r\nthan ever. A hawk-like man, Isaac Worthington, to be reckoned with and\r\nfeared, whether in a frock coat or in breastplate and mail.\r\n\r\nHis seneschal, Mr. Flint, was awaiting him in the library. Mr. Flint was\r\nlarge and very ugly, big-boned, smooth-shaven, with coarse features all\r\naskew, and a large nose with many excrescences, and thick lips. He was\r\nforty-two. From a foreman of the mills he had risen, step by step,\r\nto his present position, which no one seemed able to define. He was,\r\nindeed, a seneschal. He managed the mills in his lord's absence, and--if\r\nthe truth be told--in his presence; knotty questions of the Truro\r\nRailroad were brought to Mr. Flint and submitted to Mr. Worthington,\r\nwho decided them, with Mr. Flint's advice; and, within the last three\r\nmonths, Mr. Flint had invaded the realm of politics, quietly, as such a\r\nman would, under the cover of his patron's name and glory. Mr. Flint\r\nit was who had bought the Newcastle Guardian, who went occasionally to\r\nNewcastle and spoke a few effective words now and then to the editor;\r\nand, if the truth will out, Mr. Flint had largely conceived that scheme\r\nabout the railroads which was to set Mr. Worthington on the throne of\r\nthe state, although the scheme was not now being carried out according\r\nto Mr. Flint's wishes. Mr. Flint was, in a sense, a Bismarck, but he\r\nwas not as yet all powerful. Sometimes his august master or one of his\r\nfellow petty sovereigns would sweep Mr. Flint's plans into the waste\r\nbasket, and then Mr. Flint would be content to wait. To complete the\r\ncharacter sketch, Mr. Flint was not above hanging up his master's hat\r\nand coat, Which he did upon the present occasion, and went up to Mr.\r\nWorthington's bedroom to fetch a pocket handkerchief out of the second\r\ndrawer. He even knew where the handkerchiefs were kept. Lucky petty\r\nsovereigns sometimes possess Mr. Flints to make them emperors.\r\n\r\nThe august personage seated himself briskly at his desk.\r\n\r\n“So that scoundrel Bass is actually discredited at last,” he said,\r\nblowing his nose in the pocket handkerchief Mr. Flint had brought him.\r\n“I lose patience when I think how long we've stood the rascal in this\r\nstate. I knew the people would rise in their indignation when they\r\nlearned the truth about him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Flint did not answer this. He might have had other views.\r\n\r\n“I wonder we did not think of it before,” Mr. Worthington continued. “A\r\nvery simple remedy, and only requiring a little courage and--and--” (Mr.\r\nWorthington was going to say money, but thought better of it) “and the\r\nchimera disappears. I congratulate you, Flint.”\r\n\r\n“Congratulate yourself,” said Mr. Flint; “that would not have been my\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, I congratulate myself,” said the august personage, who was\r\nin too good a humor to be put out by the rejection of a compliment. “You\r\nremember what I said: the time was ripe, just publish a few biographical\r\narticles telling people what he was, and Jethro Bass would snuff out\r\nlike a candle. Mr. Duncan tells me the town-meeting results are very\r\ngood all over the state. Even if we hadn't knocked out Jethro Bass, we'd\r\nhave a fair majority for our bill in the next legislature.”\r\n\r\n“You know Bass's saying,” answered Mr. Flint, “You can hitch that kind\r\nof a hoss, but they won't always stay hitched.”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” said Mr. Worthington; “don't croak, Flint. We can\r\nbuy more hitch ropes, if necessary. Well, what's the outlay up to the\r\npresent? Large, I suppose. Well, whatever it is, it's small compared to\r\nwhat we'll get for it.” He laughed a little and rubbed his hands, and\r\nthen he remembered that capacity in which he stood before the world.\r\nYes, and he stood before himself in the same capacity. Isaac Worthington\r\nmay have deceived himself, but he may or may not have been a hero to\r\nhis seneschal. “We have to fight fire with fire,” he added, in a pained\r\nvoice. “Let me see the account.”\r\n\r\n“I have tabulated the expense in the different cities and towns,”\r\n answered Mr. Flint; “I will show you the account in a little while. The\r\nexpenses in Coniston were somewhat greater than the size of the town\r\njustified, perhaps. But Sutton thought--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” interrupted Mr. Worthington, “if it had cost as much to\r\ncarry Coniston as Newcastle, it would have been worth it--for the moral\r\neffect alone.”\r\n\r\nMoral effect! Mr. Flint thought of Mr. Bixby with his bulging pockets\r\ngoing about the hills, and smiled at the manner in which moral effects\r\nare sometimes obtained.\r\n\r\n“Any news, Flint?”\r\n\r\nNo news yet, Mr. Flint might have answered. In a few minutes there might\r\nbe news, and plenty of it, for it lay ready to be hatched under Mr.\r\nWorthington's eye. A letter in the bold and upright hand of his son\r\nwas on the top of the pile, placed there by Mr. Flint himself, who had\r\nexamined Mr. Worthington's face closely when he came in to see how much\r\nhe might know of its contents. He had decided that Mr. Worthington was\r\nin too good a humor to know anything of them. Mr. Flint had not steamed\r\nthe letter open, and read the news; but he could guess at them pretty\r\nshrewdly, and so could have the biggest fool in Brampton. That letter\r\ncontained the opening scene of the next act in the drama.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington cut the envelope and began to read, and while he did so\r\nMr. Flint, who was not afraid of man or beast, looked at him. It was a\r\nmanly and straight forward letter, and Mr. Worthington, no matter what\r\nhis opinions on the subject were, should have been proud of it. Bob\r\nannounced, first of all, that he was going to marry Cynthia Wetherell;\r\nthen he proceeded with praiseworthy self-control (for a lover) to\r\ndescribe Cynthia's character and attainments: after which he stated\r\nthat Cynthia had refused him--twice, because she believed that Mr.\r\nWorthington would oppose the marriage, and had declared that she would\r\nnever be the cause of a breach between father and son. Bob asked for his\r\nfather's consent, and hoped to have it, but he thought it only right to\r\nadd that he had given his word and his love, and did not mean to retract\r\neither. He spoke of his visit to Brampton, and explained that Cynthia\r\nwas teaching school there, and urged his father to see her before he\r\nmade a decision. Mr. Worthington read it through to the end, his lips\r\nclosing tighter and tighter until his mouth was but a line across his\r\nface. There was pain in the face, too, the kind of pain which anger\r\nsends, and which comes with the tottering of a pride that is false. Of\r\nwhat gratification now was the overthrow of Jethro Bass?\r\n\r\nHe stared at the letter for a moment after he had finished it, and\r\nhis face grew a dark red. Then he seized the paper and tore it slowly,\r\ndeliberately, into bits.\r\n\r\nDudley Worthington was not thinking then--not he!--of the young man in\r\nthe white beaver who had called at the Social Library many years\r\nbefore to see a young woman whose name, too, had been Cynthia.--He was\r\nthinking, in fact, for he was a man to think in anger, whether it were\r\nnot possible to remove this Cynthia from the face of the earth--at least\r\nto a place beyond his horizon and that of his son. Had he worn the chain\r\nmail instead of the frock coat he would have had her hung outside the\r\ntown walls.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” he exclaimed. And the words sounded profane indeed as\r\nhe fixed his eyes upon Mr. Flint. “You knew that Robert had been to\r\nBrampton.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Flint, “the whole village knew it.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” cried Mr. Worthington again, “why was I not informed of\r\nthis? Why was I not warned of this? Have I no friends? Do you pretend to\r\nlook after my interests and not take the trouble to write me on such a\r\nsubject.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could have prevented it?” asked Mr. Flint, very calmly.\r\n\r\n“You allow this--this woman to come here to Brampton and teach school in\r\na place where she can further her designs? What were you about?”\r\n\r\n“When the prudential committee appointed her, nothing of this was known,\r\nMr. Worthington.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but now--now! What are you doing, what are they doing to allow her\r\nto remain? Who are on that committee?”\r\n\r\nMr. Flint named the men. They had been reelected, as usual, at the\r\nrecent town-meeting. Mr. Errol, who had also been reelected, had\r\nreturned but had not yet issued the certificate or conducted the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n“Send for them, have them here at once,” commanded Mr. Worthington,\r\nwithout listening to this.\r\n\r\n“If you take my advice, you will do nothing of the kind,” said Mr.\r\nFlint, who, as usual, had the whole situation at his fingers' ends.\r\nHe had taken the trouble to inform himself about the girl, and he had\r\ndiscovered, shrewdly enough, that she was the kind which might be led,\r\nbut not driven. If Mr. Flint's advice had been listened to, this story\r\nmight have had quite a different ending. But Mr. Flint had not reached\r\nthe stage where his advice was always listened to, and he had a maddened\r\nman to deal with now. At that moment, as if fate had determined to\r\nintervene, the housemaid came into the room.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dodd to see you, sir,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Show him in,” shouted Mr. Worthington; “show him in!”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd was not a man who could wait for a summons which he had felt in\r\nhis bones was coming. He was ordinarily, as we have seen, officious.\r\nBut now he was thoroughly frightened. He had seen the great man in the\r\nbarouche as he drove past the hardware store, and he had made up his\r\nmind to go up at once, and have it over with. His opinions were formed\r\nnow, He put a smile on his face when he was a foot outside of the\r\nlibrary door.\r\n\r\n“This is a great pleasure, Mr. Worthington, a great pleasure, to see you\r\nback,” he said, coming forward. “I callated--”\r\n\r\nBut the great man sat in his chair, and made no attempt to return the\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dodd, I thought you were my friend,” he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd went all to pieces at this reception.\r\n\r\n“So I be, Mr. Worthington--so I be,” he cried. “That's why I'm here now.\r\nI've b'en a friend of yours ever since I can remember--never fluctuated.\r\nI'd rather have chopped my hand off than had this happen--so I would. If\r\nI could have foreseen what she was, she'd never have had the place, as\r\nsure as my name's Levi Dodd.”\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Dodd had taken the trouble to look at the seneschal's face, he\r\nwould have seen a well-defined sneer there.\r\n\r\n“And now that you know what she is,” cried Mr. Worthington, rising and\r\nsmiting the pile of letters on his desk, “why do you keep her there an\r\ninstant?”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd stopped to pick up the letters, which had flown over the floor.\r\nBut the great man was now in the full tide of his anger.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the letters,” he shouted; “tell me why you keep her there.”\r\n\r\n“We callated we'd wait and see what steps you'd like taken,” said the\r\ntrembling townsman.\r\n\r\n“Steps! Steps! Good God! What kind of man are you to serve in such a\r\nplace when you allow the professed ward of Jethro Bass--of Jethro Bass,\r\nthe most notoriously depraved man in this state, to teach the children\r\nof this town. Steps! How soon can you call your committee together?”\r\n\r\n“Right away,” answered Mr. Dodd, breathlessly. He would have gone on to\r\nexculpate himself, but Mr. Worthington's inexorable finger was pointing\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n“If you are a friend of mine,” said that gentleman, “and if you have any\r\nregard for the fair name of this town, you will do so at once.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd departed precipitately, and Mr. Worthington began to pace the\r\nroom, clasping his hands now in front of him, now behind him, in his\r\nagony: repeating now and again various appellations which need not be\r\nprinted here, which he applied in turn to the prudential committee, to\r\nhis son, and to Cynthia Wetherell.\r\n\r\n“I'll run her out of Brampton,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“If you do,” said Mr. Flint, who had been watching him apparently\r\nunmoved, “you may have Jethro Bass on your back.”\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass?” shouted Mr. Worthington, with a laugh that was not\r\npleasant to hear, “Jethro Bass is as dead as Julius Caesar.”\r\n\r\nIt was one thing for Mr. Dodd to promise so readily a meeting of the\r\ncommittee, and quite another to decide how he was going to get through\r\nthe affair without any more burns and scratches than were absolutely\r\nnecessary. He had reversed the usual order, and had been in the\r\nfire--now he was going to the frying-pan. He stood in the street for\r\nsome time, pulling at his tuft, and then made his way to Mr. Jonathan\r\nHill's feed store. Mr. Hill was reading “Sartor Resartus” in his little\r\noffice, the temperature of which must have been 95, and Mr. Dodd was\r\nperspiring when he got there.\r\n\r\n“It's come,” said Mr. Dodd, sententiously.\r\n\r\n“What's come?” inquired Mr. Hill, mildly.\r\n\r\n“Isaac D.'s come, that's what,” said Mr. Dodd. “I hain't b'en sleepin'\r\nwell of nights, lately. I can't think what we was about, Jonathan,\r\nputtin' that girl in the school. We'd ought to've knowed she wahn't\r\nfit.”\r\n\r\n“What's the matter with her?” inquired Mr. Hill.\r\n\r\n“Matter with her!” exclaimed his fellow-committeeman, “she lives with\r\nJethro Bass--she's his ward.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of it?” said Mr. Hill, who never bothered himself about\r\ngossip or newspapers, or indeed about anything not between the covers of\r\na book, except when he couldn't help it.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” exclaimed Mr. Dodd, “he's the most notorious, depraved man\r\nin the state. Hain't we got to look out for the fair name of Brampton?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hill sighed and closed his book.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said; “I'd hoped we were through with that. Let's go up and\r\nsee what Judge Graves says about it.”\r\n\r\n“Hold on,” said Mr. Dodd, seizing the feed dealer by the coat, “we've\r\ngot to get it fixed in our minds what we're goin' to do, first. We can't\r\nallow no notorious people in our schools. We've got to stand up to the\r\njedge, and tell him so. We app'inted her on his recommendation, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“I like the girl,” replied Mr. Hill. “I don't think we ever had a better\r\nteacher. She's quiet, and nice appearin', and attends to her business.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd pulled his tuft, and cocked his head.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington holds a note of yours, don't he, Jonathan?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hill reflected. He said he thought perhaps Mr. Worthington did.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Dodd, “I guess we might as well go along up to the\r\njedge now as any time.”\r\n\r\nBut when they got there Mr. Dodd's knock was so timid that he had to\r\nrepeat it before the judge came to the door and peered at them over his\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?” he asked, severely, though he\r\nknew well enough. He had not been taken by surprise many times during\r\nthe last forty years. Mr. Dodd explained that they wished a little\r\nmeeting of the committee. The judge ushered them into his bedroom, the\r\nparlor being too good for such an occasion.\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “let us get down to business. Mr. Worthington\r\narrived here to-day, he has seen Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Dodd has seen Mr.\r\nHill. Mr. Worthington is a political opponent of Jethro Bass, and wishes\r\nMiss Wetherell dismissed. Mr. Dodd and Mr. Hill have agreed, for various\r\nreasons which I will spare you, that Miss Wetherell should be dismissed.\r\nHave I stated the case, gentlemen, or have I not?”\r\n\r\nMr. Graves took off his spectacles and wiped them, looking from one to\r\nthe other of his very uncomfortable fellow-members. Mr. Hill did not\r\nattempt to speak; but Mr. Dodd, who was not sure now that this was not\r\nthe fire and the other the frying-pan, pulled at his tuft until words\r\ncame to him.\r\n\r\n“Jedge,” he said finally, “I must say I'm a mite surprised. I must say\r\nyour language is unwarranted.”\r\n\r\n“The truth is never unwarranted,” said the judge.\r\n\r\n“For the sake of the fair name of Brampton,” began Mr. Dodd, “we cannot\r\nallow--”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dodd,” interrupted the judge, “I would rather have Mr.\r\nWorthington's arguments from Mr. Worthington himself, if I wanted them\r\nat all. There is no need of prolonging this meeting. If I were to waste\r\nmy breath until six o'clock, it would be no use. I was about to say\r\nthat your opinions were formed, but I will alter that, and say that your\r\nminds are fixed. You are determined to dismiss Miss Wetherell. Is it not\r\nso?”\r\n\r\n“I wish you'd hear me, Jedge,” said Mr. Dodd, desperately.\r\n\r\n“Will you kindly answer me yes or no to that question,” said the judge;\r\n“my time is valuable.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you put it that way, I guess we are agreed that she hadn't\r\nought to stay. Not that I've anything against her personally--”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the judge, with a calmness that made them tremble.\r\nThey had never bearded him before. “All right, you are two to one and\r\nno certificate has been issued. But I tell you this, gentlemen, that you\r\nwill live to see the day when you will bitterly regret this injustice\r\nto an innocent and a noble woman, and Isaac D. Worthington will live to\r\nregret it. You may tell him I said so. Good day, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nThey rose.\r\n\r\n“Jedge,” began Mr. Dodd again, “I don't think you've been quite fair\r\nwith us.”\r\n\r\n“Fair!” repeated the judge, with unutterable scorn. “Good day,\r\ngentlemen.” And he slammed the door behind them.\r\n\r\nThey walked down the street some distance before either of them spoke.\r\n\r\n“Goliah,” said Mr. Dodd, at last, “did you ever hear such talk? He's got\r\nthe drattedest temper of any man I ever knew, and he never callates to\r\nmake a mistake. It's a little mite hard to do your duty when a man talks\r\nthat way.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not sure we've done it,” answered Mr. Hill.\r\n\r\n“Not sure!” ejaculated the hardware dealer, for he was now far enough\r\naway from the judge's house to speak in his normal tone, “and she\r\nconnected with that depraved--”\r\n\r\n“Hold on,” said Mr. Hill, with an astonishing amount of spirit for him,\r\n“I've heard that before.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd looked at him, swallowed the wrong way and began to choke.\r\n\r\n“You hain't wavered, Jonathan?” he said, when he got his breath.\r\n\r\n“No, I haven't,” said Mr. Hill, sadly; “but I wish to hell I had.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd looked at him again, and began to choke again. It was the first\r\ntime he had known Jonathan Hill to swear.\r\n\r\n“You're a-goin' to stick by what you agreed--by your principles?”\r\n\r\n“I'm going to stick by my bread and butter,” said Mr. Hill, “not by my\r\nprinciples. I wish to hell I wasn't.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying that gentleman departed, cutting diagonally across the\r\nstreet through the snow, leaving Mr. Dodd still choking and pulling at\r\nhis tuft. This third and totally-unexpected shaking-up had caused him\r\nto feel somewhat deranged internally, though it had not altered the\r\nopinions now so firmly planted in his head. After a few moments,\r\nhowever, he had collected himself sufficiently to move on once\r\nmore, when he discovered that he was repeating to himself, quite\r\nunconsciously, Mr. Hill's profanity “I wish to hell I wasn't.” The iron\r\nmastiffs glaring at him angrily out of the snow banks reminded him that\r\nhe was in front of Mr. Worthington's door, and he thought he might as\r\nwell go in at once and receive the great man's gratitude. He certainly\r\ndeserved it. But as he put his hand on the bell Mr. Worthington himself\r\ncame out of the house, and would actually have gone by without noticing\r\nMr. Dodd if he had not spoken.\r\n\r\n“I've got that little matter fixed, Mr. Worthington,” he said, “called\r\nthe committee, and we voted to discharge the--the young woman.” No, he\r\ndid not deliver Judge Graves's message.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mr. Dodd,” answered the great man, passing on so that Mr.\r\nDodd was obliged to follow him in order to hear, “I'm glad you've come\r\nto your senses at last. Kindly step into the library and tell Miss Bruce\r\nfrom me that she may fill the place to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Certain,” said Mr. Dodd, with his hand to his chin. He watched the\r\ngreat man turn in at his bank in the new block, and then he did as he\r\nwas bid.\r\n\r\nBy the time school was out that day the news had leaped across Brampton\r\nStreet and spread up and down both sides of it that the new teacher had\r\nbeen dismissed. The story ran fairly straight--there were enough clews,\r\ncertainly. The great man's return, the visit of Mr. Dodd, the call on\r\nJudge Graves, all had been marked. The fiat of the first citizen\r\nhad gone forth that the ward of Jethro Bass must be got rid of; the\r\ndesigning young woman who had sought to entrap his son must be punished\r\nfor her amazing effrontery.\r\n\r\nCynthia came out of school happily unaware that her name was on the\r\nlips of Brampton: unaware, too, that the lord of the place had come into\r\nresidence that day. She had looked forward to living in the same town\r\nwith Bob's father as an evil which was necessary to be borne, as one of\r\nthe things which are more or less inevitable in the lives of those who\r\nhave to make their own ways in the world. The children trooped around\r\nher, and the little girls held her hand, and she talked and laughed with\r\nthem as she came up the street in the eyes of Brampton,--came up the\r\nstreet to the block of new buildings where the bank was. Stepping out of\r\nthe bank, with that businesslike alertness which characterized him,\r\nwas the first citizen--none other. He found himself entangled among\r\nthe romping children and--horror of horrors he bumped into the\r\nschoolmistress herself! Worse than this, he had taken off his hat and\r\nbegged her pardon before he looked at her and realized the enormity of\r\nhis mistake. And the schoolmistress had actually paid no attention to\r\nhim, but with merely heightened color had drawn the children out of his\r\nway and passed on without a word. The first citizen, raging inwardly,\r\nbut trying to appear unconcerned, walked rapidly back to his house. On\r\nthe street of his own town, before the eyes of men, he had been snubbed\r\nby a school-teacher. And such a schoolteacher!\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington, as he paced his library burning with the shame of this\r\noccurrence, remembered that he had had to glance at her twice before it\r\ncame over him who she was. His first sensation had been astonishment.\r\nAnd now, in spite of his bitter anger, he had to acknowledge that the\r\nface had made an impression on him--a fact that only served to increase\r\nhis rage. A conviction grew upon him that it was a face which his son,\r\nor any other man, would not be likely to forget. He himself could not\r\nforget it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cynthia had reached her home, her cheeks still smarting,\r\nconscious that people had stared at her. This much, of course, she\r\nknew--that Brampton believed Bob Worthington to be in love with her: and\r\nthe knowledge at such times made her so miserable that the thought of\r\nJethro's isolation alone deterred her from asking Miss Lucretia Penniman\r\nfor a position in Boston. For she wrote to Miss Lucretia about her life\r\nand her reading, as that lady had made her promise to do. She sat down\r\nnow at the cherry chest of drawers that was also a desk, to write: not\r\nto pour out her troubles, for she never had done that,--but to calm her\r\nmind by drawing little character sketches of her pupils. But she had\r\nonly written the words, “My dear Miss Lucretia,” when she looked out of\r\nthe window and saw Judge Graves coming up the path, and ran to open the\r\ndoor for him.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Judge?” she said, for she recognized Mr. Graves as\r\none of her few friends in Brampton. “I have sent to Boston for the new\r\nreader, but it has not come.”\r\n\r\nThe judge took her hand and pressed it and led her into the little\r\nsitting room. His face was very stern, but his eyes, which had flung\r\nfire at Mr. Dodd, looked at her with a vast compassion. Her heart\r\nmisgave her.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” he said,--it was long since the judge had called any woman\r\n“my dear,”--“I have bad news for you. The committee have decided that\r\nyou cannot teach any longer in the Brampton school.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Judge,” she answered, trying to force back the tears which would\r\ncome, “I have tried so hard. I had begun to believe that I could fill\r\nthe place.”\r\n\r\n“Fill the place!” cried the judge, startling her with his sudden anger.\r\n“No woman in the state can fill it better than you.”\r\n\r\n“Then why am I dismissed?” she asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\nThe judge looked at her in silence, his blue lips quivering. Sometimes\r\neven he found it hard to tell the truth. And yet he had come to tell\r\nit, that she might suffer less. He remembered the time when Isaac D.\r\nWorthington had done him a great wrong.\r\n\r\n“You are dismissed,” he said, “because Mr. Worthington has come\r\nhome, and because the two other members of the committee are dogs and\r\ncowards.” Mr. Graves never minced matters when he began, and his voice\r\nshook with passion. “If Mr. Errol had examined you, and you had your\r\ncertificate, it might have been different. Errol is not a sycophant.\r\nWorthington does not hold his mortgage.”\r\n\r\n“Mortgage!” exclaimed Cynthia. The word always struck terror to her\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington holds Mr. Hill's mortgage,” said Mr. Graves, more than\r\never beside himself at the sight of her suffering. “That man's tyranny\r\nis not to be borne. We will not give up, Cynthia. I will fight him in\r\nthis matter if it takes my last ounce of strength, so help me God!”\r\n\r\nMortgage! Cynthia sank down in the chair by the desk. In spite of the\r\nmisery the news had brought, the thought that his father, too, who was\r\nfighting Jethro Bass as a righteous man, dealt in mortgages and coerced\r\nmen to do his will, was overwhelming. So she sat for a while staring at\r\nthe landscape on the old wall paper.\r\n\r\n“I will go to Coniston to-night,” she said at last.\r\n\r\n“No,” cried the judge, seizing her shoulder in his excitement, “no. Do\r\nyou think that I have been your friend--that I am your friend?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Judge Graves--”\r\n\r\n“Then stay here, where you are. I ask it as a favor to me. You need not\r\ngo to the school to-morrow--indeed, you cannot. But stay here for a day\r\nor two at least, and if there is any justice left in a free country, we\r\nshall have it. Will you stay, as a favor to me?”\r\n\r\n“I will stay, since you ask it,” said Cynthia. “I will do what you think\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nHer voice was firmer than he expected--much firmer. He glanced at her\r\nquickly, with something very like admiration in his eye.\r\n\r\n“You are a good woman, and a brave woman,” he said, and with this\r\nsomewhat surprising tribute he took his departure instantly.\r\n\r\nCynthia was left to her thoughts, and these were harassing and sorrowful\r\nenough. One idea, however, persisted through them all. Mr. Worthington,\r\nwhose power she had lived long enough in Brampton to know, was an unjust\r\nman and a hypocrite. That thought was both sweet and bitter: sweet, as a\r\nretribution; and bitter, because he was Bob's father. She realized, now,\r\nthat Bob knew these things, and she respected and loved him the more,\r\nif that were possible, because he had refrained from speaking of them to\r\nher. And now another thought came, and though she put it resolutely from\r\nher, persisted. Was she not justified now in marrying him? The reasoning\r\nwas false, so she told herself. She had no right to separate Bob from\r\nhis father, whatever his father might be. Did not she still love Jethro\r\nBass? Yes, but he had renounced his ways. Her heart swelled gratefully\r\nas she spoke the words to herself, and she reflected that he, at least,\r\nhad never been a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nOf one thing she was sure, now. In the matter of the school she had\r\nright on her side, and she must allow Judge Graves to do whatever\r\nhe thought proper to maintain that right. If Isaac D. Worthington's\r\ncharacter had been different, this would not have been her decision. Now\r\nshe would not leave Brampton in disgrace, when she had done nothing to\r\nmerit it. Not that she believed that the judge would prevail against\r\nsuch mighty odds. So little did she think so that she fell, presently,\r\ninto a despondency which in all her troubles had not overtaken her--the\r\ndespondency which comes even to the pure and the strong when they feel\r\nthe unjust strength of the world against them. In this state her eyes\r\nfell on the letter she had started to Miss Lucretia Penniman, and in\r\ndesperation she began to write.\r\n\r\nIt was a short letter, reserved enough, and quite in character. It was\r\nright that she should defend herself, which she did with dignity, saying\r\nthat she believed the committee had no fault to find with her duties,\r\nbut that Mr. Worthington had seen fit to bring influence to bear upon\r\nthem because of her connection with Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nIt was not the whole truth, but Cynthia could not bring herself to\r\nwrite of that other reason. At the end she asked, very simply, if Miss\r\nLucretia could find her something to do in Boston in case her dismissal\r\nbecame certain. Then she put on her coat, and walked to the postoffice\r\nto post the letter, for she resolved that there could be no shame\r\nwithout reason for it. There was a little more color in her cheeks,\r\nand she held her head high, preparing to be slighted. But she was not\r\nslighted, and got more salutations, if anything, than usual. She was,\r\nindeed, in the right not to hide her head, and policy alone would have\r\nforbade it, had Cynthia thought of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is like the wind--it bloweth where it listeth. It\r\nwhistled around Brampton the next day, whirling husbands and wives\r\napart, and families into smithereens. Brampton had a storm all to\r\nitself--save for a sympathetic storm raging in Coniston--and all about a\r\nschool-teacher.\r\n\r\nHad Cynthia been a certain type of woman, she would have had all the men\r\non her side and all of her own sex against her. It is a decided point\r\nto be recorded in her favor that she had among her sympathizers as many\r\nwomen as men. But the excitement of a day long remembered in Brampton\r\nbegan, for her, when a score or more of children assembled in front of\r\nthe little house, tramping down the snow on the grass plots, shouting\r\nfor her to come to school with them. Children give no mortgages, or keep\r\nno hardware stores.\r\n\r\nCynthia, trying to read in front of the fire, was all in a tremble at\r\nthe sound of the high-pitched little voices she had grown to love, and\r\nshe longed to go out and kiss them, every one. Her nature, however,\r\nshrank from any act which might appear dramatic or sensational. She\r\ncould not resist going to the window and smiling at them, though they\r\nappeared but dimly--little dancing figures in a mist. And when they\r\nshouted, the more she shook her head and put her finger to her lips in\r\nreproof and vanished from their sight. Then they trooped sadly on to\r\nschool, resolved to make matters as disagreeable as possible for poor\r\nMiss Bruce, who had not offended in any way.\r\n\r\nTwo other episodes worthy of a place in this act of the drama occurred\r\nthat morning, and one had to do with Ephraim. Poor Ephraim! His way had\r\never been to fight and ask no questions, and in his journey through the\r\nworld he had gathered but little knowledge of it. He had limped home the\r\nnight before in a state of anger of which Cynthia had not believed him\r\ncapable, and had reappeared in the sitting room in his best suit of\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going, Cousin Eph?” Cynthia had asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Never you mind, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\n“But I do mind,” she said, catching hold of his sleeve. “I won't let you\r\ngo until you confess.”\r\n\r\n“I'm a-goin' to tell Isaac Worthington what I think of him, that's whar\r\nI'm a-goin',” cried Ephraim “what I always hev thought of him sence he\r\nsent a substitute to the war an' acted treasonable here to home talkin'\r\nag'in' Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cousin Eph, you mustn't,” said Cynthia, clinging to him with all\r\nher strength in her dismay. It had taken every whit of her influence\r\nto persuade him to relinquish his purpose. Cynthia knew very well that\r\nEphraim meant to lay hands on Mr. Worthington, and it would indeed have\r\nbeen a disastrous hour for the first citizen if the old soldier had ever\r\ngot into his library. Cynthia pointed out, as best she might, that it\r\nwould be an evil hour for her, too, and that her cause would be greatly\r\ninjured by such a proceeding; she knew very well that it would ruin\r\nEphraim, but he would not have listened to such an argument.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he wished to do was to go to Coniston and rouse Jethro.\r\nCynthia's heart stood still when he proposed this, for it touched upon\r\nher greatest fear,--which had impelled her to go to Coniston. But she\r\nhad hoped and believed that Jethro, knowing her feelings, would do\r\nnothing--since for her sake he had chosen to give up his power. Now an\r\nacute attack of rheumatism had come to her rescue, and she succeeded in\r\ngetting Ephraim off to bed, swathed in bandages.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he had insisted upon hobbling away to the postoffice,\r\nwhere in due time he was discovered by certain members of the Brampton\r\nClub nailing to the wall a new engraving of Abraham Lincoln, and draping\r\nit with a little silk flag he had bought in Boston. By which it will be\r\nseen that a potion of the Club were coming back to their old haunt. This\r\nportion, it may be surmised, was composed of such persons alone as were\r\nlikely to be welcomed by the postmaster. Some of these had grievances\r\nagainst Mr. Worthington or Mr. Flint; others, in more prosperous\r\ncircumstances, might have been moved by envy of these gentlemen; still\r\nothers might have been actuated largely by righteous resentment at what\r\nthey deemed oppression by wealth and power. These members who came that\r\nmorning comprised about one-fourth of those who formerly had been in\r\nthe habit of dropping in for a chat, and their numbers were a fair\r\nindication of the fact that those who from various motives took the part\r\nof the schoolteacher in Brampton were as one to three.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to repeat their expressions of indignation and\r\nsympathy. There was a certain Mr. Gamaliel Ives in the town, belonging\r\nto an old Brampton family, who would have been the first citizen if\r\nthat other first citizen had not, by his rise to wealth and power, so\r\ncompletely overshadowed him. Mr. Ives owned a small mill on Coniston\r\nWater below the town. He fairly bubbled over with civic pride, and he\r\nwas an authority on all matters pertaining to Brampton's history. He\r\nknew the “Hymn to Coniston” by heart. But we are digressing a\r\nlittle. Mr. Ives, like that other Gamaliel of old, had exhorted his\r\nfellow-townsmen to wash their hands of the controversy. But he was\r\nan intimate of Judge Graves, and after talking with that gentleman he\r\nbecame a partisan overnight; and when he had stopped to get his mail he\r\nhad been lured behind the window by the debate in progress. He was in\r\nthe midst of some impromptu remarks when he recognized a certain brisk\r\nstep behind him, and Isaac D. Worthington himself entered the sanctum!\r\n\r\nIt must be explained that Mr. Worthington sometimes had an important\r\nletter to be registered which he carried to the postoffice with his own\r\nhands. On such occasions--though not a member of the Brampton Club--he\r\nwalked, as an overlord will, into any private place he chose, and\r\nrecognized no partitions or barriers. Now he handed the letter\r\n(addressed to a certain person in Cambridge, Massachusetts) to the\r\npostmaster.\r\n\r\n“You will kindly register that and give me a receipt, Mr. Prescott,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nEphraim turned from his contemplation of the features of the martyred\r\nPresident, and on his face was something of the look it might have worn\r\nwhen he confronted his enemies over the log-works at Five Forks. No, for\r\nthere was a vast contempt in his gaze now, and he had had no contempt\r\nfor the Southerners, and would have shaken hands with any of them\r\nthe moment the battle was over. Mr. Worthington, in spite of himself,\r\nrecoiled a little before that look, fearing, perhaps, physical violence.\r\n\r\n“I hain't a-goin' to hurt you, Mr. Worthington,” Ephraim said, “but I am\r\na-goin' to ask you to git out in front, and mighty quick. If you hev any\r\nbusiness with the postmaster, there's the window,” and Ephraim pointed\r\nto it with his twisted finger. “I don't allow nobody but my friends\r\nhere, Mr. Worthington, and people I respect.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington looked--well, eye-witnesses give various versions as\r\nto how he looked. All agree that his lip trembled; some say his eyes\r\nwatered: at any rate, he quailed, stood a moment undecided, and then\r\nswung on his heel and walked to the partition door. At this safe\r\ndistance he turned.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Prescott,” he said, his voice quivering with passion and\r\nperhaps another emotion, “I will make it my duty to report to the\r\npostmaster-general the manner in which this office is run. Instead of\r\nattending to your business, you make the place a resort for loafers and\r\nidlers. Good morning, sir.”\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Mr. Flint himself came to register the letter. But it\r\nwas done at the window, and the loafers and idlers were still there.\r\n\r\nThe curtain had risen again, indeed, and the action was soon fast enough\r\nfor the most impatient that day. No sooner had the town heard with bated\r\nbreath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of\r\nthe post-office, than the news of another event began to go the rounds.\r\nMr. Worthington had other and more important things to think about than\r\nminor postmasters, and after his anger and--yes, and momentary fear\r\nhad subsided, he forgot the incident except to make a mental note\r\nto remember to deprive Mr. Prescott of his postmastership, which he\r\nbelieved could be done readily enough now that Jethro Bass was out of\r\nthe way. Then he had stepped into the bank, which he had come to regard\r\nas his own bank, as he regarded most institutions in Brampton. He had,\r\nin the old days, been president of it, as we know. He stepped into the\r\nbank, and then--he stepped out again.\r\n\r\nMost people have experienced that sickly feeling of the diaphragm which\r\nsometimes comes from a sadden shock. Mr. Worthington had it now as he\r\nhurried up the street, and he presently discovered that he was walking\r\nin the direction opposite to that of his own home. He crossed the\r\nstreet, made a pretence of going into Mr. Goldthwaite's drug store, and\r\nhurried back again. When he reached his own library, he found Mr. Flint\r\nbusy there at his desk. Mr. Flint rose. Mr. Worthington sat down\r\nand began to pull the papers about in a manner which betrayed to his\r\nseneschal (who knew every mood of his master) mental perturbation.\r\n\r\n“Flint,” he said at last, striving his best for an indifferent accent,\r\n“Jethro Bass is here--I ran across him just now drawing money in the\r\nbank.”\r\n\r\n“I could have told you that this morning,” answered Mr. Flint. “Wheeler,\r\nwho runs errands for him in Coniston, drove him in this morning, and\r\nhe's been with Peleg Hartington for two hours over Sherman's livery\r\nstable.”\r\n\r\nAn interval of silence followed, during which Mr. Worthington shuffled\r\nwith his letters and pretended to read them.\r\n\r\n“Graves has called a mass meeting to-night, I understand,” he remarked\r\nin the same casual way. “The man's a demagogue, and mad as a loon. I\r\nbelieve he sent back one of our passes once, didn't he? I suppose Bass\r\nhas come in to get Hartington to work up the meeting. They'll be laughed\r\nout of the town hall, or hissed out.”\r\n\r\n“I guess you'll find Bass has come down for something else,” said Mr.\r\nFlint, looking up from a division report.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” demanded Mr. Worthington, changing his attitude to\r\none of fierceness. But he was well aware that whatever tone he took with\r\nhis seneschal, he never fooled him.\r\n\r\n“I mean what I told you yesterday,” said Flint, “that you've stirred up\r\nthe dragon.”\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Flint did not know how like a knell his words sounded in Isaac\r\nWorthington's ears.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” he cried, “you're talking nonsense, Flint. We maimed him too\r\nthoroughly for that. He hasn't power enough left to carry his own town.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the seneschal.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that?” said his master, with extreme irritation.\r\n\r\n“I mean what I said yesterday, that we haven't maimed him at all. He had\r\nhis own reasons for going into his hole, and he never would have come\r\nout again if you hadn't goaded him. Now he's out, and we'll have to step\r\naround pretty lively, I can tell you, or he'll maim us.”\r\n\r\nAll of which goes to show that Mr. Flint had some notion of men and\r\naffairs. He became, as may be predicted, the head of many material\r\nthings in later days, and he may sometime reappear in company with other\r\ncharacters in this story.\r\n\r\nThe sickly feeling in Mr. Worthington's diaphragm had now returned.\r\n\r\n“I think you will find you are mistaken, Flint,” he said, attempting\r\ndignity now. “Very much mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Flint, “perhaps I am. But I believe you'll find he\r\nleft for the capital on the eleven o'clock, and if you take the trouble\r\nto inquire from Bedding you will probably learn that the Throne Room is\r\nbespoken for the session.”\r\n\r\nAll of that which Mr. Flint had predicted turned out to be true. The\r\ndragon had indeed waked up. It all began with the news Milly Skinner had\r\ngot from the stage driver, imparted to Jethro as he sat reading about\r\nHiawatha. And terrible indeed had been that awakening. This dragon did\r\nnot bellow and roar and lash his tail when he was roused, but he stood\r\nup, and there seemed to emanate from him a fire which frightened poor\r\nMilly Skinner, upset though she was by the news of Cynthia's dismissal.\r\nO, wondrous and paradoxical might of love, which can tame the most\r\npowerful of beasts, and stir them again into furies by a touch!\r\n\r\nConiston was the first to tremble, as though the forces stretching\r\nthemselves in the tannery house were shaking the very ground, and the\r\nname of Jethro Bass took on once more, as by magic, a terrible meaning.\r\nWhen Vesuvius is silent, pygmies may make faces on the very lip of the\r\ncrater, and they on the slopes forget the black terror of the fiery\r\nhail. Jake Wheeler himself, loyal as he was, did not care to look into\r\nthe crater now that he was summoned; but a force pulled him all the way\r\nto the tannery house. He left behind him an awe-stricken gathering at\r\nthe store, composed of inhabitants who had recently spoken slightingly\r\nof the volcano.\r\n\r\nWe are getting a little mixed in our metaphors between lions and dragons\r\nand volcanoes, and yet none of them are too strong to represent Jethro\r\nBass when he heard that Isaac Worthington had had the teacher dismissed\r\nfrom Brampton lower school. He did not stop to reason then that action\r\nmight distress her. The beast in him awoke again; the desire for\r\nvengeance on a man whom he had hated most of his life, and who now had\r\ndared to cause pain to the woman whom he loved with all his soul, and\r\neven idolize, was too great to resist. He had no thought of resisting\r\nit, for the waters of it swept over his soul like the Atlantic over a\r\nlost continent. He would crush Isaac Worthington if it took the last\r\nbreath from his body.\r\n\r\nJake went to the tannery house and received his orders--orders of which\r\nhe made a great mystery afterward at the store, although they consisted\r\nsimply of directions to be prepared to drive Jethro to Brampton the next\r\nmorning. But the look of the man had frightened Jake. He had never seen\r\nvengeance so indelibly written on that face, and he had never before\r\nrealized the terrible power of vengeance. Mr. Wheeler returned from that\r\nmeeting in such a state of trepidation that he found it necessary to\r\naccompany Rias to a certain keg in the cellar; after which he found his\r\ntongue. His description of Jethro's appearance awed his hearers, and\r\nJake declared that he would not be in Isaac Worthington's shoes for all\r\nof Isaac Worthington's money. There were others right here in Coniston,\r\nJake hinted, who might now find it convenient to emigrate to the far\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nJethro's face had not changed when Jake drove him out of Coniston the\r\nnext morning. Good Mr. Satterlee saw it, and felt that the visit he had\r\nwished to make would have been useless; Mr. Amos Cuthbert and Mr. Sam\r\nPrice saw it, from a safe distance within the store, and it is a fact\r\nthat Mr. Price seriously thought of taking Mr. Wheeler's advice about\r\na residence in the West; Mr. Cuthbert, of a sterner nature, made up his\r\nmind to be hung and quartered. A few minutes before Jethro walked into\r\nhis office over the livery stable, Senator Peleg Hartington would have\r\ndenied, with that peculiar and mournful scorn of which he was master,\r\nthat Jethro Bass could ever again have any influence over him. Peleg\r\nwas, indeed, at that moment preparing, in his own way, to make overtures\r\nto the party of Isaac D. Worthington. Jethro walked into the office,\r\nleaving Jake below with Mr. Sherman; and Senator Hartington was very\r\nglad he had not made the overtures. And when he accompanied Jethro to\r\nthe station when he left for the capital, the senator felt that the eyes\r\nof men were upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd Cynthia? Happily, Cynthia passed the day in ignorance that Jethro\r\nhad gone through Brampton. Ephraim, though he knew of it, did not\r\nspeak of it when he came home to his dinner; Mr. Graves had called, and\r\ninformed her of the meeting in the town hall that night.\r\n\r\n“It is our only chance,” he said obdurately, in answer to her protests.\r\n“We must lay the case before the people of Brampton. If they have not\r\nthe courage to right the wrong, and force your reinstatement through\r\npublic opinion, there is nothing more to be done.”\r\n\r\nTo Cynthia, the idea of having a mass meeting concerning herself was\r\nparticularly repellent.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Judge Graves!” she cried, “if there isn't any other way, please\r\ndrop the matter. There are plenty of teachers who will--be acceptable to\r\neverybody.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” said the judge, “I can understand that this publicity is\r\nvery painful to you. I beg you to remember that we are contending for a\r\nprinciple. In such cases the individual must be sacrificed to the common\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“But I cannot go to the meeting--I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the judge; “I don't think that will be necessary.”\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone, she could think of nothing but the horror of having\r\nher name--yes, and her character--discussed in that public place; and\r\nit seemed to her, if she listened, she could hear a clatter of tongues\r\nthroughout the length of Brampton Street, and that she must fain stop\r\nher ears or go mad. The few ladies who called during the day out of\r\nkindness or curiosity, or both, only added to her torture. She was not\r\none who could open her heart to acquaintances: the curious ones got but\r\nlittle satisfaction, and the kind ones thought her cold, and they did\r\nnot perceive that she was really grateful for their little attentions.\r\nGratitude, on such occasions, does not always consist in pouring out\r\none's troubles in the laps of visitors.\r\n\r\nSo the visitors went home, wondering whether it were worth while after\r\nall to interest themselves in the cause of such a self-contained and\r\nself-reliant young woman. In spite of all her efforts, Cynthia had never\r\nwholly succeeded in making most of the Brampton ladies believe that she\r\ndid not secretly deem herself above them. They belonged to a reserved\r\nrace themselves; but Cynthia had a reserve which was even different from\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nAs night drew on the predictions of Mr. Worthington seemed likely to be\r\nfulfilled, and it looked as if Judge Graves would have a useless bill\r\nto pay for gas in the new town hall. The judge had never been a man who\r\ncould compel a following, and he had no magnetism with which to lead\r\na cause: the town tradesmen, especially those in the new brick block,\r\nwould be chary as to risking the displeasure of their best customer.\r\nAt half-past seven Mr. Graves: came in, alone, and sat on the platform\r\nstaring grimly at his gas. Is there a lecturer, or, a playwright, or\r\na politician, who has not, at one time or another, been in the judge's\r\nplace? Who cannot sympathize with him as he watched the thin and\r\nhesitating stream of people out of the corner of his eye as they came in\r\nat the door? The judge despised them with all his soul, but it is human\r\nnature not to wish to sit in a hall or a theatre that is three-quarters\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nAt sixteen minutes to eight a mild excitement occurred, an incident of\r\nsome significance which served to detain many waverers. Senator Peleg\r\nHartington walked up the aisle, and the judge rose and shook him by the\r\nhand, and as Deacon Hartington he was invited to sit on the platform.\r\nThe senator's personal influence was not to be ignored; and it had\r\nsufficed to carry his district in the last election against the\r\nWorthington forces, in spite of the abdication of Jethro Bass. Mr. Page,\r\nthe editor of the Clarion, Senator Hartington's organ, was also on the\r\nplatform. But where was Mr. Ives? Where was that Gamaliel who had been\r\nsuch a warm partisan in the postoffice that morning?\r\n\r\n“Saw him outside the hall--wahn't but ten minutes ago,” said Deacon\r\nHartington, sadly; “thought he was a-comin' in.”\r\n\r\nEight o'clock came, and no Mr. Ives; ten minutes past--fifteen minutes\r\npast. If the truth must be told, Mr. Ives had been on the very threshold\r\nof the hall, and one glance at the poor sprinkling of people there had\r\ndecided him. Mr. Ives had a natural aversion to being laughed at, and as\r\nhe walked back on the darker side of the street he wished heartily that\r\nhe had stuck to his original Gamaliel-advocacy of no interference, of\r\nallowing the Supreme Judge to decide. Such opinions were inevitably\r\njust, Mr. Ives was well aware, though not always handed down\r\nimmediately. If he were to humble the first citizen, Mr. Ives reflected\r\nthat a better opportunity might present itself. The whistle of the\r\nup-train served to strengthen his resolution, for he was reminded\r\nthereby that his mill often had occasion to ask favors of the Truro\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was twenty minutes past eight in the town hall, and\r\nMr. Graves had not rapped for order. Deacon Hartington sat as motionless\r\nas a stork on the borders of a glassy lake at sunrise, the judge had\r\nbegun seriously to estimate the gas bill, and Mr. Page had chewed up the\r\nend of a pencil. There was one, at least, in the audience of whom the\r\njudge could be sure. A certain old soldier in blue sat uncompromisingly\r\non the front bench with his hands crossed over the head of his stick;\r\nbut the ladies and gentlemen nearest the door were beginning to vanish,\r\none by one, silently as ghosts, when suddenly the judge sat up. He would\r\nhave rubbed his eyes, had he been that kind of a man. Four persons had\r\nentered the hall--he was sure of it--and with no uncertain steps as\r\nif frightened by its emptiness. No, they came boldly. And after them\r\ntrooped others, and still others were heard in the street beyond, not\r\nwhispering, but talking in the unmistakable tones of people who had more\r\ncoming behind them. Yes, and more came. It was no illusion, or delusion:\r\nthere they were filling the hall as if they meant to stay, and buzzing\r\nwith excitement. The judge was quivering with excitement now, but\r\nhe, too, was only a spectator of the drama. And what a drama, with a\r\nmiracle-play for Brampton!\r\n\r\nMr. Page rose from his chair and leaned over the edge of the platform\r\nthat something might be whispered in his ear. The news, whatever it\r\nwas, was apparently electrifying, and after the first shock he turned to\r\nimpart it to Mr. Graves; but turned too late, for the judge had already\r\nrapped for order and was clearing his throat. He could not account for\r\nthis extraordinary and unlooked-for audience, among whom he spied many\r\nwho had thought it wiser not to protest against the dictum of the\r\nfirst citizen, and many who had professed to believe that the teacher's\r\nconnection with Jethro Bass was a good and sufficient reason for\r\ndismissal. The judge was prepared to take advantage of the tide,\r\nwhatever its cause.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “I take the liberty of calling this\r\nmeeting to order. And before a chairman be elected, I mean to ask your\r\nindulgence to explain my purposes in requesting the use of this hall\r\nto-night. In our system of government, the inalienable and most precious\r\ngift--”\r\n\r\nWhatever the gift was, the judge never explained. He paused at the\r\nwords, and repeated them, and stopped altogether because no one was\r\npaying any attention to him. The hall was almost full, the people\r\nhad risen, with a hum, and as one man had turned toward the door. Mr.\r\nGamaliel Ives was triumphantly marching down the aisle, and with him\r\nwas--well, another person. Nay, personage would perhaps be the better\r\nword.\r\n\r\nLet us go back for a moment. There descended from that train of which\r\nwe have heard the whistle a lady with features of no ordinary moulding,\r\nwith curls and a string bonnet and a cloak that seemed strangely\r\nto harmonize with the lady's character. She had the way of one in\r\nauthority, and Mr. Sherman himself ran to open the door of his only\r\nclosed carriage, and the driver galloped off with her all the way to the\r\nBrampton House. Once there, the lady seized the pen as a soldier seizes\r\nthe sword, and wrote her name in most uncompromising characters on the\r\nregister, Miss Lucretia Penniman, Boston. Then she marched up to her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman, author of the “Hymn to Coniston,” in the\r\nreflected glory of whose fame Brampton had shone for thirty years!\r\nWhose name was lauded and whose poem was recited at every Fourth of\r\nJuly celebration, that the very children might learn it and honor its\r\ncomposer! Stratford-on-Avon is not prouder of Shakespeare than Brampton\r\nof Miss Lucretia, and now she was come back, unheralded, to her\r\nbirthplace. Mr. Raines, the clerk, looked at the handwriting on the\r\nbook, and would not believe his own sight until it was vouched for by\r\nsundry citizens who had followed the lady from the station--on foot. And\r\nthen there was a to-do.\r\n\r\nSend for Mr. Gamaliel Ives; send for Miss Bruce, the librarian; send\r\nfor Mr. Page, editor of the Clarion, and notify the first citizen. He,\r\nindeed, could not be sent for, but had he known of her coming he would\r\nundoubtedly have had her met at the portals and presented with the keys\r\nin gold. Up and down the street flew the news which overshadowed and\r\nblotted out all other, and the poor little school-teacher was forgotten.\r\n\r\nOne of these notables was at hand, though he did not deserve to be.\r\nMr. Gamaliel Ives sent up his card to Miss Lucretia, and was shown\r\ndeferentially into the parlor, where he sat mopping his brow and growing\r\nhot and cold by turns. How would the celebrity treat him? The celebrity\r\nherself answered the question by entering the room in such stately\r\nmanner as he had expected, to the rustle of the bombazine. Whereupon Mr.\r\nIves bounced out of his chair and bowed, though his body was not formed\r\nto bend that way.\r\n\r\n“Miss Penniman,” he exclaimed, “what an honor for Brampton! And what a\r\npleasure, the greater because so unexpected! How cruel not to have given\r\nus warning, and we could have greeted you as your great fame deserves!\r\nYou could never take time from your great duties to accept the\r\ninvitations of our literary committee, alas! But now that you are\r\nhere, you will find a warm welcome, Miss Penniman. How long it has\r\nbeen--thirty years,--you see I know it to a day, thirty years since you\r\nleft us. Thirty years, I may say, we have kept burning the vestal fire\r\nin your worship, hoping for this hour.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia may have had her own ideas about the propriety of the\r\nreference to the vestal fire.\r\n\r\n“Gamaliel,” she said sharply, “straighten up and don't talk nonsense to\r\nme. I've had you on my knee, and I knew your mother and father.”\r\n\r\nGamaliel did straighten up, as though Miss Lucretia had applied a lump\r\nof ice to the small of his back. So it is when the literary deities,\r\nvestal or otherwise, return to their Stratfords. There are generally\r\nsurprises in store for the people they have had on their knees, and for\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n“Gamaliel,” said Miss Lucretia, “I want to see the prudential committee\r\nfor the village district.”\r\n\r\n“The prudential committee!” Mr. Ives fairly shrieked the words in his\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“I tried to speak plainly,” said Miss Lucretia. “Who are on that\r\ncommittee?”\r\n\r\n“Ezra Graves,” said Mr. Ives, as though mechanically compelled, for his\r\nhead was spinning round. “Ezra Graves always has run it, until now. But\r\nhe's in the town hall.”\r\n\r\n“What's he doing there?”\r\n\r\nMr. Ives was no fool. Some inkling of the facts began to shoot through\r\nhis brain, and he saw his chance.\r\n\r\n“He called a mass meeting to protest against the dismissal of a\r\nteacher.”\r\n\r\n“Gamaliel,” said Miss Lucretia, “you will conduct me to that meeting. I\r\nwill get my cloak.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ives wasted no time in the interval, and he fairly ran out into the\r\noffice. Miss Lucretia Penniman was in town, and would attend the\r\nmass meeting. Now, indeed, it was to be a mass meeting. Away flew the\r\ntidings, broadcast, and people threw off their carpet slippers and\r\ndressing gowns, and some who had gone to bed got up again. Mr. Dodd\r\nheard it, and changed his shoes three times, and his intentions three\r\ntimes three. Should he go, or should he not? Already he heard in\r\nimagination the first distant note of the populace, and he was not of\r\nthe metal to defend a Bastille or a Louvre for his royal master with the\r\nlast drop of his blood.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Gamaliel Ives was conducting Miss Lucretia toward\r\nthe town hall, and speaking in no measured tones of indignation of the\r\ncringing, truckling qualities of that very Mr. Dodd. The injustice to\r\nMiss Wetherell, which Mr. Ives explained as well as he could, made his\r\nblood boil: so he declared.\r\n\r\nAnd note we are back again at the meeting, when the judge, with his\r\nhand on his Adam's apple, is pronouncing the word “gift.” Mr. Ives\r\nis triumphantly marching down the aisle, escorting the celebrity of\r\nBrampton to the platform, and quite aware of the heart burnings of\r\nhis fellow-citizens on the benches. And Miss Lucretia, with that stern\r\ncomposure with which celebrities accept public situations, follows up\r\nthe steps as of right and takes the chair he assigns her beside the\r\nchairman. The judge, still grasping his Adam's apple, stares at the\r\nnewcomer in amazement, and recognizes her in spite of the years, and\r\ntrembles. Miss Lucretia Penniman! Blucher was not more welcome to\r\nWellington, or Lafayette to Washington, than was Miss Lucretia to\r\nEzra Graves as he turned his back on the audience and bowed to her\r\ndeferentially. Then he turned again, cleared his throat once more to\r\ncollect his senses, and was about to utter the familiar words, “We have\r\nwith us tonight,” when they were taken out of his mouth--taken out of\r\nhis mouth by one who had in all conscience stolen enough thunder for one\r\nman,--Mr. Gamaliel Ives.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman,” said Mr. Ives, taking a slight dropping of the judge's\r\nlower jaw for recognition, “and ladies and gentlemen of Brampton. It is\r\nour great good fortune to have with us to-night, most unexpectedly,\r\none of whom Brampton is, and for many years has been, justly proud.”\r\n (Cheers.) “One whose career Brampton has followed with a mother's eyes\r\nand with a mother's heart. One who has chosen a broader field for\r\nthe exercise of those great powers with which Nature endowed her than\r\nBrampton could give. One who has taken her place among the luminaries of\r\nliterature of her time.” (Cheers.) “One who has done more than any\r\nother woman of her generation toward the uplifting of the sex which she\r\nhonors.” (Cheers and clapping of hands.) “And one who, though her lot\r\nhas fallen among the great, has not forgotten the home of her childhood.\r\nFor has she not written those beautiful lines which we all know by\r\nheart?\r\n\r\n     'Ah, Coniston! Thy lordly form I see\r\n     Before mine eyes in exile drear.'\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman and fellow-townsmen and women, I have the extreme honor\r\nof introducing to you one whom we all love and revere, the author of\r\nthe 'Hymn to Coniston,' the editor of the Woman's Hour, Miss Lucretia\r\nPenniman.'” (Loud and long-continued applause.)\r\n\r\nWell might Brampton be proud, too, of Gamaliel Ives, president of\r\nits literary club, who could make such a speech as this on such short\r\nnotice. If the truth be told, the literary club had sent Miss Lucretia\r\nno less than seven invitations, and this was the speech Mr. Ives had\r\nintended to make on those seven occasions. It was unquestionably a neat\r\nspeech, and Judge Graves or no other chairman should cheat him out of\r\nmaking it. Mr. Ives, with a wave of his hand toward the celebrity, sat\r\ndown by no means dissatisfied with himself. What did he care how the\r\njudge glared. He did not see how stiffly Miss Lucretia sat in her chair.\r\nShe could not take him on her knee then, but she would have liked to.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia rose, and stood quite as stiffly as she had sat, and the\r\njudge rose, too. He was very angry, but this was not the time to get\r\neven with Mr. Ives. As it turned out, he did not need to bother about\r\ngetting even.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” said he, “in the absence of any other chairman I\r\ntake pleasure in introducing to you Miss Lucretia Penniman.”\r\n\r\nMore applause was started, but Miss Lucretia put a stop to it by the\r\nlifting of a hand. Then there was a breathless silence. Then she\r\ncast her eyes around the hall, as though daring any one to break that\r\nsilence, and finally they rested upon Mr. Ives.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman,” she said, with an inclination toward the judge, “my\r\nfriends--for I hope you will be my friends when I have finished” (Miss\r\nLucretia made it quite clear by her tone that it entirely depended upon\r\nthem whether they would be or not), “I understood when I came here that\r\nthis was to be a mass meeting to protest against an injustice, and not a\r\nfeast of literature and oratory, as Gamaliel Ives seems to suppose.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, and when the first shock of amazement was past an audible\r\ntitter ran through the audience, and Mr. Ives squirmed visibly.\r\n\r\n“Am I right, Mr. Chairman?” asked Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n“You are unquestionably right, Miss Penniman,” answered the chairman,\r\nrising, “unquestionably.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will proceed,” said Miss Lucretia. “I wrote the Hymn to\r\nConiston' many years ago, when I was younger, and yet it is true that I\r\nhave always remembered Brampton with kindly feelings. The friends of our\r\nyouth are dear to us. We look indulgently upon their failings, even as\r\nthey do on ours. I have scanned the faces here in the hall to-night, and\r\nthere are some that have not changed beyond recognition in thirty years.\r\nEzra Graves I remember, and it is a pleasure to see him in that chair.”\r\n (Mr. Graves inclined his head, reverently. None knew how the inner man\r\nexulted.) “But there was one who was often in Brampton in those days,”\r\n Miss Lucretia continued, “whom we all loved and with whom we found\r\nno fault, and I confess that when I have thought of Brampton I have\r\noftenest thought of her. Her name,” said Miss Lucretia, her hand now in\r\nthe reticule, “her name was Cynthia Ware.”\r\n\r\nThere was a decided stir among the audience, and many leaned forward to\r\ncatch every word.\r\n\r\n“Even old people may have an ideal,” said Miss Lucretia, “and you will\r\nforgive me for speaking of mine. Where should I speak of it, if not in\r\nthis village, among those who knew her and among their children? Cynthia\r\nWare, although she was younger than I, has been my ideal, and is\r\nstill. She was the daughter of the Rev. Samuel Ware of Coniston, and\r\na descendant of Captain Timothy Prescott, whom General Stark called\r\n'Honest Tim.' She was, to me, all that a woman should be, in intellect,\r\nin her scorn of all that is ignoble and false, and in her loyalty to her\r\nfriends.” Here the handkerchief came out of the reticule. “She went to\r\nBoston to teach school, and some time afterward I was offered a position\r\nin New York, and I never saw her again. But she married in Boston a man\r\nof learning and literary attainments, though his health was feeble and\r\nhe was poor, William Wetherell.” (Another stir.) “Mr. Wetherell was a\r\ngentleman--Cynthia Ware could have married no other--and he came of good\r\nand honorable people in Portsmouth. Very recently I read a collection of\r\nletters which he wrote to the Newcastle Guardian, which some of you may\r\nknow. I did not trust my own judgment as to those letters, but I took\r\nthem to an author whose name is known wherever English is spoken, but\r\nwhich I will not mention. And the author expressed it as his opinion, in\r\nwriting to me, that William Wetherell was undoubtedly a genius of a high\r\norder, and that he would have been so recognized if life had given him\r\na chance. Mr. Wetherell, after his wife died, was taken in a dying\r\ncondition to Coniston, where he was forced, in order to earn his living,\r\nto become the storekeeper there. But he took his books with him, and\r\nfound time to write the letters of which I have spoken, and to give his\r\ndaughter an early education such as few girls have.\r\n\r\n“My friends, I am rejoiced to see that the spirit of justice and the\r\nsense of right are as strong in Brampton as they used to be--strong\r\nenough to fill this town hall to overflowing because a teacher has been\r\nwrongly--yes, and iniquitously--dismissed from the lower school.” (Here\r\nthere was a considerable stir, and many wondered whether Miss Lucretia\r\nwas aware of the irony in her words.) “I say wrongly and iniquitously,\r\nbecause I have had the opportunity in Boston this winter of learning to\r\nknow and love that teacher. I am not given to exaggeration, my friends,\r\nand when I tell you that I know her, that her character is as high and\r\npure as her mother's, I can say no more. I am here to tell you this\r\nto-night because I do not believe you know her as I do. During the\r\nseventy years I have lived I have grown to have but little faith in\r\noutward demonstration, to believe in deeds and attainments rather than\r\nexpressions. And as for her fitness to teach, I believe that even the\r\nprudential committee could find no fault with that.” (I wonder whether\r\nMr. Dodd was in the back of the hall.) “I can find no fault with it. I\r\nam constantly called upon to recommend teachers, and I tell you I should\r\nhave no hesitation in sending Cynthia Wetherell to a high school, young\r\nas she is.”\r\n\r\n“And now, my friends, why was she dismissed? I have heard the facts,\r\nthough not from her. Cynthia Wetherell does not know that I have come\r\nto Brampton, unless somebody has told her, and did not know that I was\r\ncoming. I have heard the facts, and I find it difficult to believe that\r\nso great a wrong could be attempted against a woman, and if the name\r\nof Cynthia Wetherell had meant no more to me than the letters in it I\r\nshould have travelled twice as far as Brampton, old as I am, to do my\r\nutmost to right that wrong. I give you my word of honor that I have\r\nnever been so indignant in my life. I do not come here to stir up\r\nenmities among you, and I will mention no more names. I prefer to\r\nbelieve that the prudential committee of this district has made a\r\nmistake, the gravity of which they must now realize, and that they will\r\nreinstate Cynthia Wetherell to-morrow. And if they should not of their\r\nown free will, I have only to look around this meeting to be convinced\r\nthat they will be compelled to. Compelled to, my friends, by the sense\r\nof justice and the righteous indignation of the citizens of Brampton.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia sat down, her strong face alight with the spirit that\r\nwas in her. Not the least of the compelling forces in this world is\r\nrighteous anger, and when it is exercised by a man or a woman whose life\r\nhas been a continual warfare against the pests of wrong, it is well-nigh\r\nirresistible. While you could count five seconds the audience sat\r\nsilent, and then began such tumult and applause as had never been seen\r\nin Brampton--all started, so it is said, by an old soldier in the front\r\nrow with his stick. Isaac D. Worthington, sitting alone in the library\r\nof his mansion, heard it, and had no need to send for Mr. Flint to ask\r\nwhat it was, or who it was had fired the Third Estate. And Mr. Dodd\r\nheard it. He may have been in the hall, but now he sat at home, seeing\r\nvisions of the lantern, and he would have fled to the palace had he\r\nthought to get any sympathy from his sovereign. No, Mr. Dodd did not\r\nhold the Bastille or even fight for it. Another and a better man gave\r\nup the keys, for heroes are sometimes hidden away in meek and retiring\r\npeople who wear spectacles and have a stoop to their shoulders. Long\r\nbefore the excitement died away a dozen men were on their feet shouting\r\nat the chairman, and among them was the tall, stooping man with\r\nspectacles. He did not shout, but Judge Graves saw him and made up his\r\nmind that this was the man to speak. The chairman raised his hand and\r\nrapped with his gavel, and at length he had obtained silence.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “I am going to recognize Mr. Hill of\r\nthe prudential committee, and ask him to step up on the platform.”\r\n\r\nThere fell another silence, as absolute as the first, when Mr. Hill\r\nwalked down the aisle and climbed the steps. Indeed, people were\r\nstupefied, for the feed dealer was a man who had never opened his mouth\r\nin town-meeting; who had never taken an initiative of any kind; who had\r\nallowed other men to take advantage of him, and had never resented it.\r\nAnd now he was going to speak. Would he defend the prudential committee,\r\nor would he declare for the teacher? Either course, in Mr. Hill's case,\r\nrequired courage, and he had never been credited with any. If Mr. Hill\r\nwas going to speak at all, he was going to straddle.\r\n\r\nHe reached the platform, bowed irresolutely to the chairman, and then\r\nstood awkwardly with one knee bent, peering at his audience over his\r\nglasses. He began without any address whatever.\r\n\r\n“I want to say,” he began in a low voice, “that I had no intention of\r\ncoming to this meeting. And I am going to confess--I am going to confess\r\nthat I was afraid to come.” He raised his voice a little defiantly a the\r\nwords, and paused. One could almost hear the people breathing. “I was\r\nafraid to come for fear that I should do the very thing I am going to\r\ndo now. And yet I was impelled to come. I want to say that my conscience\r\nhas not been clear since, as a member of the prudential committee, I\r\ngave my consent to the dismissal of Miss Wetherell. I know that I was\r\ninfluenced by personal and selfish considerations which should have had\r\nno weight. And after listening to Miss Penniman I take this opportunity\r\nto declare, of my own free will, that I will add my vote to that of\r\nJudge Graves to reinstate Miss Wetherell.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hill bowed slightly, and was about to descend the steps when the\r\nchairman, throwing parliamentary dignity to the winds, arose and seized\r\nthe feed dealer's hand. And the people in the hall almost as one man\r\nsprang to their feet and cheered, and some--Ephraim Prescott among\r\nthese--even waved their hats and shouted Mr. Hill's name. A New England\r\naudience does not frequently forget itself, but there were few present\r\nwho did not understand the heroism of the man's confession, who were not\r\ncarried away by the simple and dramatic dignity of it. He had no need to\r\nmention Mr. Worthington's name, or specify the nature of his obligations\r\nto that gentleman. In that hour Jonathan Hill rose high in the respect\r\nof Brampton, and some pressed into the aisle to congratulate him on his\r\nway back to his seat. Not a few were grateful to him for another reason.\r\nHe had relieved the meeting of the necessity of taking any further\r\naction: of putting their names, for instance, in their enthusiasm to a\r\npaper which the first citizen might see.\r\n\r\nJudge Graves, whose sense of a climax was acute, rapped for order.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, in a voice not wholly free from\r\nemotion, “you will all wish to pay your respects to the famous lady, who\r\nis with us. I see that the Rev. Mr. Sweet is present, and I suggest that\r\nwe adjourn, after he has favored us with a prayer.”\r\n\r\nAs the minister came forward, Deacon Hartington dropped his head and\r\nbegan to flutter his eyelids. The Rev. Mr. Sweet prayed, and so was\r\nbrought to an end the most exciting meeting ever held in Brampton town\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Lucretia did not like being called “a famous lady.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Lucretia was standing, unwillingly enough, listening to\r\nthe speeches that were poured into her ear by various members of the\r\naudience, receiving the incense and myrrh to which so great a celebrity\r\nwas entitled, the old soldier hobbled away to his little house as\r\nfast as his three legs would carry him. Only one event in his life had\r\neclipsed this in happiness--the interview in front of the White House.\r\nHe rapped on the window with his stick, thereby frightening Cynthia half\r\nout of her wits as she sat musing sorrowfully by the fire.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Ephraim,” she said, taking off his corded hat, “what in the\r\nworld's the matter with you?”\r\n\r\n“You're a schoolmarm again, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Lucretia Penniman done it.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Lucretia Penniman!” Cynthia began to think his rheumatism was\r\ndriving him out of his mind.\r\n\r\n“You bet. 'Long toward the openin' of the engagement there wahn't\r\nscarcely anybody thar but me, and they was a-goin'. But they come fast\r\nenough when they l'arned she was in town, and she blew 'em up higher'n\r\nthe Petersburg crater. Great Tecumseh, there's a woman! Next to General\r\nGrant, I'd sooner shake her hand than anybody's livin'.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that Miss Lucretia is in Brampton and spoke at the\r\nmass meeting?”\r\n\r\n“Spoke!” exclaimed Ephraim, “callate she did--some. Tore 'em all up.\r\nThey'd a hung Isaac D. Worthington or Levi Dodd if they'd a had 'em\r\nthar.”\r\n\r\nCynthia, striving to be calm herself, got him into a chair and took his\r\nstick and straightened out his leg, and then Ephraim told her the story,\r\nand it lost no dramatic effect in his telling. He would have talked\r\nall night. But at length the sound of wheels was heard in the street,\r\nCynthia flew to the door, and a familiar voice came out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n“You need not wait, Gamaliel. No, thank you, I think I will stay at the\r\nhotel.”\r\n\r\nGamaliel was still protesting when Miss Lucretia came in and seized\r\nCynthia in her arms, and the door was closed behind her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Miss Lucretia, why did you come?” said Cynthia, “if I had known you\r\nwould do such a thing, I should never have written that letter. I have\r\nbeen sorry to-day that I did write it, and now I'm sorrier than ever.”\r\n\r\n“Aren't you glad to see me?” demanded Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lucretia!”\r\n\r\n“What are friends for?” asked Miss Lucretia, patting her hand. “If you\r\nhad known how I wished to see you, Cynthia, and I thought a little trip\r\nwould be good for such a provincial Bostonian as I am. Dear, dear, I\r\nremember this house. It used to belong to Gabriel Post in my time, and\r\nright across from it was the Social Library, where I have spent so many\r\npleasant hours with your mother. And this is Ephraim Prescott. I thought\r\nit was, when I saw him sitting in the front row, and I think he must\r\nhave been very lonesome there at one time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma'am,” said Ephraim, giving her his gnarled fingers; “I was just\r\nsayin' to Cynthy that I'd ruther shake your hand than anybody's livin'\r\nexceptin' General Grant.”\r\n\r\n“And I'd rather shake yours than the General's,” said Miss Lucretia,\r\nfor the Woman's Hour had taken the opposition side in a certain recent\r\npublic question concerning women.\r\n\r\n“If you'd a fit with him, you wouldn't say that, Miss Lucrety.”\r\n\r\n“I haven't a word to say against his fighting qualities,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Guess the General might say the same of you,” said Ephraim. “If you'd a\r\nb'en a man, I callate you'd a come out of the war with two stars on your\r\nshoulder. Godfrey, Miss Lucrety, you'd ought to've b'en a man.”\r\n\r\n“A man!” cried Miss Lucretia, “and 'stars on my shoulder'! I think this\r\nkind of talk has gone far enough, Ephraim Prescott.”\r\n\r\n“Cousin Eph,” said Cynthia, laughing, “you're no match for Miss\r\nLucretia, and it's long past your bedtime.”\r\n\r\n“A man!” repeated Miss Lucretia, after he had retired, and after Cynthia\r\nhad tried to express her gratitude and had been silenced. They sat\r\nside by side in front of the chimney. “I suppose he meant that as a\r\ncompliment. I never yet saw the man I couldn't back down, and I haven't\r\nany patience with a woman who gives in to them.” Miss Lucretia poked\r\nvigorously a log which had fallen down, as though that were a man, too,\r\nand she was putting him back in his proper place.\r\n\r\nCynthia, strange to say, did not reply to this remark.\r\n\r\n“Cynthia,” said Miss Lucretia, abruptly, “you don't mean to say that you\r\nare in love!”\r\n\r\nCynthia drew a long breath, and grew as red as the embers.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lucretia!” she exclaimed, in astonishment and dismay.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Miss Lucretia said, “I should have thought you could have gotten\r\nalong, for a while at least, without anything of that kind. My dear,”\r\n she said leaning toward Cynthia, “who is he?”\r\n\r\nCynthia turned away. She found it very hard to speak of her troubles,\r\neven to Miss Lucretia, and she would have kept this secret even from\r\nJethro, had it been possible.\r\n\r\n“You must let him know his place,” said Miss Lucretia, “and I hope he is\r\nin some degree worthy of you.”\r\n\r\n“I do not intend to marry him,” said Cynthia, with head still turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt was now Miss Lucretia who was silent.\r\n\r\n“I came near getting married once,” she said presently, with\r\ncharacteristic abruptness.\r\n\r\n“You!” cried Cynthia, looking around in amazement.\r\n\r\n“You see, I am franker than you, my dear--though I never told any one\r\nelse. I believe you can keep a secret.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I can. Who--was it anyone in Brampton, Miss Lucretia?” The\r\nquestion was out before Cynthia realized its import. She was turning the\r\ntables with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n“It was Ezra Graves,” said Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n“Ezra Graves!” And then Cynthia pressed Miss Lucretia's hand in silence,\r\nthinking how strange it was that both of them should have been her\r\nchampions that evening.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia poked the fire again.\r\n\r\n“It was shortly after that, when I went to Boston, that I wrote the\r\n'Hymn to Coniston.' I suppose we must all be fools once or twice, or we\r\nshould not be human.”\r\n\r\n“And--weren't you ever--sorry?” asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence.\r\n\r\n“I could not have done the work I have had to do in the world if I\r\nhad married. But I have often wondered whether that work was worth the\r\nwhile. Such a feeling must come over all workers, occasionally. Yes,”\r\n said Miss Lucretia, “there have been times when I have been sorry, my\r\ndear, though I have never confessed it to another soul. I am telling you\r\nthis for your own good--not mine. If you have the love of a good man,\r\nCynthia, be careful what you do with it.”\r\n\r\nThe tears had come into Cynthia's eyes.\r\n\r\n“I should have told you, Miss Lucretia,” she faltered. “If I could have\r\nmarried him, it would have been easier.”\r\n\r\n“Why can't you marry him?” demanded Miss Lucretia, sharply--to hide her\r\nown emotion.\r\n\r\n“His name,” said Cynthia, “is Bob Worthington:”\r\n\r\n“Isaac Worthington's son?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nAnother silence, Miss Lucretia being utterly unable to say anything for\r\na space.\r\n\r\n“Is he a good man?”\r\n\r\nCynthia was on the point of indignant-protest, but she stopped herself\r\nin time.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you what he has done,” she answered, “and then you shall\r\njudge for yourself.”\r\n\r\nAnd she told Miss Lucretia, simply, all that Bob had done, and all that\r\nshe herself had done.\r\n\r\n“He is like his mother, Sarah Hollingsworth; I knew her well,” said\r\nMiss Lucretia. “If Isaac Worthington were a man, he would be down on his\r\nknees begging you to marry his son. He tried hard enough to marry your\r\nown mother.”\r\n\r\n“My mother!” exclaimed Cynthia, who had never believed that rumor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Miss Lucretia, “and you may thank your stars he didn't\r\nsucceed. I mistrusted him when he was a young man, and now I know that\r\nhe hasn't changed. He is a coward and a hypocrite.”\r\n\r\nCynthia could not deny this.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” she said, after a moment's silence, “I am sure you will say\r\nthat I have been right. My own conscience tells me that it is wrong to\r\ndeprive Bob of his inheritance, and to separate him from his father,\r\nwhatever his father--may be.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see what happens in five years,” said Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n“Five years!” said Cynthia, in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n“Jacob served seven for Rachel,” answered Miss Lucretia; “that period is\r\nscarcely too short to test a man, and you are both young.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cynthia, “I cannot marry him, Miss Lucretia. The world would\r\naccuse me of design, and I feel that I should not be happy. I am sure\r\nthat he would never reproach me, even if things went wrong, but--the day\r\nmight come when--when he would wish that it had been otherwise.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia kissed her.\r\n\r\n“You are very young, my dear,” she repeated, “and none of us may say\r\nwhat changes time may bring forth. And now I must go.”\r\n\r\nCynthia insisted upon walking with her friend down the street to the\r\nhotel--an undertaking that was without danger in Brampton. And it was\r\nonly a step, after all. A late moon floated in the sky, throwing in\r\nrelief the shadow of the Worthington mansion against the white patches\r\nof snow. A light was still burning in the library.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after breakfast Miss Lucretia appeared at the little\r\nhouse, and informed Cynthia that she would walk to school with her.\r\n\r\n“But I have not yet been notified by the Committee,” said Cynthia. There\r\nwas a knock at the door, and in walked Judge Ezra Graves. Miss Lucretia\r\nmay have blushed, but it is certain that Cynthia did. Never had she seen\r\nthe judge so spick and span, and he wore the broadcloth coat he usually\r\nreserved for Sundays. He paused at the threshold, with his hand on his\r\nAdam's apple.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, ladies,” he said, and looked shyly at Miss Lucretia and\r\ncleared his throat, and spoke with the elaborate decorum he used on\r\noccasions, “Miss Penniman, I wish to thank you again for your noble\r\naction of last evening.”\r\n\r\n“Don't 'Miss Penniman' me, Ezra Graves,” retorted Miss Lucretia; “the\r\nonly noble action I know of was poor Jonathan Hill's--unless it was\r\npaying for the gas.”\r\n\r\nThis was the way in which Miss Lucretia treated her lover after thirty\r\nyears! Cynthia thought of what the lady had said to her a few hours\r\nsince, by this very fire, and began to believe she must have dreamed it.\r\nFires look very differently at night--and sometimes burn brighter then.\r\nThe judge parted his coat tails, and seated himself on the wooden edge\r\nof a cane-bottomed chair.\r\n\r\n“Lucretia,” he said, “you haven't changed.”\r\n\r\n“You have, Ezra,” she replied, looking at the Adam's apple.\r\n\r\n“I'm an old man,” said Ezra Graves.\r\n\r\nCynthia could not help thinking that he was a very different man,\r\nin Miss Lucretia's presence, than when at the head of the prudential\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n“Ezra,” said Miss Lucretia, “for a man you do very well.”\r\n\r\nThe judge smiled.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Lucretia,” said he. He seemed to appreciate the full extent\r\nof the compliment.\r\n\r\n“Judge Graves,” said Cynthia, “I can tell you how good you are, at\r\nleast, and thank you for your great kindness to me, which I shall never\r\nforget.”\r\n\r\nShe took his withered hands from his knees and pressed them. He returned\r\nthe pressure, and then searched his coat tails, found a handkerchief,\r\nand blew his nose violently.\r\n\r\n“I merely did my duty, Miss Wetherell,” he said. “I would not wilfully\r\nsubmit to a wrong.”\r\n\r\n“You called me Cynthia yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“So I did,” he answered, “so I did.” Then he looked at Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n“Ezra,” said that lady, smiling a little, “I don't believe you have\r\nchanged, after all.”\r\n\r\nWhat she meant by that nobody knows.\r\n\r\n“I had thought, Cynthia,” said the judge, “that it might be more\r\ncomfortable for you to have me go to the school with you. That is the\r\nreason for my early call.”\r\n\r\n“Judge Graves, I do appreciate your kindness,” said Cynthia; “I hope you\r\nwon't think I'm rude if I say I'd rather go alone.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, my dear,” replied the judge, “I think I can understand\r\nand esteem your feeling in the matter, and it shall be as you wish.”\r\n\r\n“Then I think I had better be going,” said Cynthia. The judge rose in\r\nalarm at the words, but she put her hand on his shoulder. “Won't you sit\r\ndown and stay,” she begged, “you haven't seen Miss Lucretia for how many\r\nyears,--thirty, isn't it?”\r\n\r\nAgain he glanced at Miss Lucretia, uncertainly. “Sit down, Ezra,” she\r\ncommanded, “and for goodness' sake don't be afraid of the cane bottom.\r\nYou won't go through it. I should like to talk to you, and most of the\r\ngossips of our day are dead. I shall stay in Brampton to-day, Cynthia,\r\nand eat supper with you here this evening.”\r\n\r\nCynthia, as she went out of the door, wondered what they would talk\r\nabout. Then she turned toward the school. It was not the March wind that\r\nburned her cheeks; as she thought of the mass meeting the night before,\r\nwhich was all about her, she wished she might go to school that morning\r\nthrough the woods and pasture lots rather than down Brampton Street.\r\nWhat--what would Bob say when he heard of the meeting? Would he come\r\nagain to Brampton? If he did, she would run away to Boston with Miss\r\nLucretia. Every day it had been a trial to pass the Worthington house,\r\nbut she could not cross the wide street to avoid it. She hurried\r\na little, unconsciously, when she came to it, for there was Mr.\r\nWorthington on the steps talking to Mr. Flint. How he must hate her now,\r\nCynthia reflected! He did not so much as look up when she passed.\r\n\r\nThe other citizens whom she met made up for Mr. Worthington's coldness,\r\nand gave her a hearty greeting, and some stopped to offer their\r\ncongratulations. Cynthia did not pause to philosophize: she was learning\r\nto accept the world as it was, and hurried swiftly on to the little\r\nschoolhouse. The children saw her coming, and ran to meet her and\r\nescorted her triumphantly in at the door. Of their welcome she could be\r\nsure. Thus she became again teacher of the lower school.\r\n\r\nHow the judge and Miss Lucretia got along that morning, Cynthia never\r\nknew. Miss Lucretia spent the day in her old home, submitting to\r\nhero-worship, and attended an evening party in her honor at Mr. Gamaliel\r\nIves's house--a mansion not so large as the first citizen's, though\r\nit had two bay-windows and was not altogether unimposing. The first\r\ncitizen, needless to say, was not there, but the rest of the elite\r\nattended. Mr. Ives will tell you all about the entertainment if you go\r\nto Brampton, but the real reason Miss Lucretia consented to go was to\r\nplease Lucy Baird, who was Gamaliel's wife, and to chat with certain old\r\nfriends whom she had not seen. The next morning she called at the school\r\nto bid Cynthia good-by, and to whisper something in her ear which made\r\nher very red before all the scholars. She shook her head when Miss\r\nLucretia said it, for it had to do with an incident in the 29th chapter\r\nof Genesis.\r\n\r\nWhile Jonathan Hill was being made a hero of in the little two-by-four\r\noffice of the feed store the morning after the mass meeting (though\r\nnobody offered to take over his mortgage), Mr. Dodd was complaining to\r\nhis wife of shooting pains, and “callated” he would stay at home that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“Shootin' fiddlesticks!” said Mrs. Dodd. “Get along down to the store\r\nand face the music, Levi Dodd. You'd have had shootin' pains if you'd a\r\nwent to the meetin'.”\r\n\r\n“I might stop by at Mr. Worthington's house and explain how powerless I\r\nwas--”\r\n\r\n“For goodness' sake git out, Levi. I guess he knows how powerless\r\nyou are with your shootin' pains. If you only could forget Isaac D.\r\nWorthington for three minutes, you wouldn't have 'em.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd's two clerks saw him enter the store by the back door and\r\nhe was very much interested in the new ploughs which were piled up in\r\ncrates outside of it. Then he disappeared into his office and shut the\r\ndoor, and supposedly became very much absorbed in book-keeping. If any\r\none called, he was out--any one. Plenty of people did call, but he was\r\nnot disturbed--until ten o'clock. Mr. Dodd had a very sensitive ear, and\r\nhe could often recognize a man by his step, and this man he recognized.\r\n\r\n“Where's Mr. Dodd?” demanded the owner of the step, indignantly.\r\n\r\n“He's out, Mr. Worthington. Anything I can do for you, Mr. Worthington?”\r\n\r\n“You can tell him to come up to my house the moment he comes in.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Mr. Dodd in the office had got into a strained position.\r\nHe found it necessary to move a little; the day-book fell heavily to the\r\nfloor, and the perspiration popped out all over his forehead. Come out,\r\nLevi Dodd. The Bastille is taken, but there are other fortresses still\r\nin the royal hands where you may be confined.\r\n\r\n“Who's in the office?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know, sir,” answered the clerk, winking at his companion, who\r\nwas sorting nails.\r\n\r\nIn three strides the great man had his hand on the office door and had\r\nflung it open, disclosing the culprit cowering over the day-book on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dodd,” cried the first citizen, “what do you mean by--?”\r\n\r\nSome natures, when terrified, are struck dumb. Mr. Dodd's was the kind\r\nwhich bursts into speech.\r\n\r\n“I couldn't help it, Mr. Worthington,” he cried, “they would have it. I\r\ndon't know what got into 'em. They lost their senses, Mr. Worthington,\r\nplumb lost their senses. If you'd a b'en there, you might have brought\r\n'em to. I tried to git the floor, but Ezry Graves--”\r\n\r\n“Confound Ezra Graves, and wait till I have done, can't you,”\r\n interrupted the first citizen, angrily. “What do you mean by putting a\r\nbath-tub into my house with the tin loose, so that I cut my leg on it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd nearly fainted from sheer relief.\r\n\r\n“I'll put a new one in to-day, right now,” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“See that you do,” said the first citizen, “and if I lose my leg, I'll\r\nsue you for a hundred thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“I was a-goin' to explain about them losin' their heads at the mass\r\nmeetin'--”\r\n\r\n“Damn their heads!” said the first citizen. “And yours, too,” he may\r\nhave added under his breath as he stalked out. It was not worth a swing\r\nof the executioner's axe in these times of war. News had arrived from\r\nthe state capital that morning of which Mr. Dodd knew nothing.\r\nCertain feudal chiefs from the North Country, of whose allegiance\r\nMr. Worthington had felt sure, had obeyed the summons of their old\r\nsovereign, Jethro Bass, and had come South to hold a conclave under\r\nhim at the Pelican. Those chiefs of the North Country, with their\r\nclans behind them as one man, what a power they were in the state! What\r\nmagnificent qualities they had, in battle or strategy, and how cunning\r\nand shrewd was their generalship! Year after year they came down from\r\ntheir mountains and fought shoulder to shoulder, and year after year\r\nthey carried back the lion's share of the spoils between them. The great\r\nSouth, as a whole, was powerless to resist them, for there could be no\r\nlasting alliance between Harwich and Brampton and Newcastle and Gosport.\r\nNow their king had come back, and the North Country men were rallying\r\nagain to his standard. No wonder that Levi Dodd's head, poor thing that\r\nit was, was safe for a while.\r\n\r\n“Organize what you have left, and be quick about it,” said Mr. Flint,\r\nwhen the news had come, and they sat in the library planning a new\r\ncampaign in the face of this evident defection. There was no time to cry\r\nover spilt milk or reinstated school-teachers. The messages flew far and\r\nwide to the manufacturing towns to range their guilds into line for the\r\nrailroads. The seneschal wrote the messages, and sent the summons to the\r\nsleek men of the cities, and let it be known that the coffers were full\r\nand not too tightly sealed, that the faithful should not lack for the\r\nsinews of war. Mr. Flint found time, too, to write some carefully worded\r\nbut nevertheless convincing articles for the Newcastle Guardian, very\r\ndamaging to certain commanders who had proved unfaithful.\r\n\r\n“Flint,” said Mr. Worthington, when they had worked far into the night,\r\n“if Bass beats us, I'm a crippled man.”\r\n\r\n“And if you postpone the fight now that you have begun it? What then?”\r\n\r\nThe answer, Mr. Worthington knew, was the same either way. He did not\r\nrepeat it. He went to his bed, but not to sleep for many hours, and when\r\nhe came down to his breakfast in the morning, he was in no mood to read\r\nthe letter from Cambridge which Mrs. Holden had put on his plate. But he\r\ndid read it, with what anger and bitterness may be imagined. There was\r\nthe ultimatum,--respectful, even affectionate, but firm. “I know that\r\nyou will, in all probability, disinherit me as you say, and I tell you\r\nhonestly that I regret the necessity of quarrelling with you more than\r\nI do the money. I do not pretend to say that I despise money, and I like\r\nthe things that it buys, but the woman I love is more to me than all\r\nthat you have.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington laid the letter down, and there came irresistibly to his\r\nmind something that his wife had said to him before she died, shortly\r\nafter they had moved into the mansion. “Dudley, how happy we used to be\r\ntogether before we were rich!” Money had not been everything to Sarah\r\nWorthington, either. But now no tender wave of feeling swept over him\r\nas he recalled those words. He was thinking of what weapon he had to\r\nprevent the marriage beyond that which was now useless--disinheritance.\r\nHe would disinherit Bob, and that very day. He would punish his son\r\nto the utmost of his power for marrying the ward of Jethro Bass. He\r\nwondered bitterly, in case a certain event occurred, whether he would\r\nhave much to alienate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Flint arrived, fresh as usual in spite of the work he had\r\naccomplished and the cigars he had smoked the night before, Mr.\r\nWorthington still had the letter in his hand, and was pacing his library\r\nfloor, and broke into a tirade against his son.\r\n\r\n“After all I have done for him, building up for him a position and a\r\nfortune that is only surpassed by young Duncan's, to treat me in this\r\nway, to drag down the name of Worthington in the mire. I'll never\r\nforgive him. I'll send for Dixon and leave the money for a hospital in\r\nBrampton. Can't you suggest any way out of this, Flint?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Flint, “not now. The only chance you have is to ignore the\r\nthing from now on. He may get tired of her--I've known such things to\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\n“When she hears that I've disinherited him, she will get tired of him,”\r\n declared Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“Try it and see, if you like,” said Flint.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Flint, if the woman has a spark of decent feeling, as you\r\nseem to think, I'll send for her and tell her that she will ruin\r\nRobert if she marries him.” Mr. Worthington always spoke of his son as\r\n“Robert.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to have thought of that before the mass meeting. Perhaps it\r\nwould have done some good then.”\r\n\r\n“Because this Penniman woman has stirred people up--is that what you\r\nmean? I don't care anything about that. Money counts in the long run.”\r\n\r\n“If money counted with this school-teacher, it would be a simple matter.\r\nI think you'll find it doesn't.”\r\n\r\n“I've known you to make some serious mistakes,” snapped Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“Then why do you ask for my advice?”\r\n\r\n“I'll send for her, and appeal to her better nature,” said Mr.\r\nWorthington, with an unconscious and sublime irony.\r\n\r\nFlint gave no sign that he heard. Mr. Worthington seated himself at\r\nhis desk, and after some thought wrote on a piece of note-paper the\r\nfollowing lines: “My dear Miss Wetherell, I should be greatly obliged if\r\nyou would find it convenient to call at my house at eight o'clock this\r\nevening,” and signed them, “Sincerely Yours.” He sealed them up in an\r\nenvelope and addressed it to Miss Wetherell, at the schoolhouse; and\r\nhanded it to Mr. Flint. That gentleman got as far as the door, and then\r\nhe hesitated and turned.\r\n\r\n“There is just one way out of this for you, that I can see, Mr.\r\nWorthington,” he said. “It's a desperate measure, but it's worth\r\nthinking about.”\r\n\r\n“What's that?”\r\n\r\nIt took some courage for Mr. Flint, to make the suggestion. “The girl's\r\na good girl, well educated, and by no means bad looking. Bob might do a\r\nthousand times worse. Give your consent to the marriage, and Jethro Bass\r\nwill go back to Coniston.”\r\n\r\nIt was wisdom such as few lords get from their seneschals, but Isaac D.\r\nWorthington did not so recognize it. His anger rose and took away his\r\nbreath as he listened to it.\r\n\r\n“I will never give my consent to it, never--do you hear?--never. Send\r\nthat note!” he cried.\r\n\r\nMr. Flint walked out, sent the note, and returned and took his place\r\nsilently at his own table. He was a man of concentration, and he put his\r\nmind on the arguments he was composing to certain political leaders. Mr.\r\nWorthington merely pretended to work as he waited for the answer to come\r\nback. And presently, when it did come back, he tore it open and read\r\nit with an expression not often on his lips. He flung the paper at Mr.\r\nFlint.\r\n\r\n“Read that,” he said.\r\n\r\nThis is what Mr. Flint read: “Miss Wetherell begs to inform Mr. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington that she can have no communication or intercourse with him\r\nwhatsoever.”\r\n\r\nMr. Flint handed it back without a word. His opinion of the\r\nschool-teacher had risen mightily, but he did not say so. Mr.\r\nWorthington took the note, too, without a word. Speech was beyond him,\r\nand he crushed the paper as fiercely as he would have liked to have\r\ncrushed Cynthia, had she been in his hands.\r\n\r\nOne accomplishment which Cynthia had learned at Miss Sadler's school was\r\nto write a letter in the third person, Miss Sadler holding that there\r\nwere occasions when it was beneath a lady's dignity to write a direct\r\nnote. And Cynthia, sitting at her little desk in the schoolhouse during\r\nher recess, had deemed this one of the occasions. She could not bring\r\nherself to write, “My dear Mr. Worthington.” Her anger, when the note\r\nhad been handed to her, was for the moment so great that she could not\r\ngo on with her classes; but she had controlled it, and compelled Silas\r\nto stand in the entry until recess, when she sat with her pen in her\r\nhand until that happy notion of the third person occurred to her.\r\nAnd after Silas had gone she sat still; though trembling a little at\r\nintervals, picturing with some satisfaction Mr. Worthington's appearance\r\nwhen he received her answer. Her instinct told her that he had received\r\nhis son's letter, and that he had sent for her to insult her. By sending\r\nfor her, indeed, he had insulted her irrevocably, and that is why she\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\nPoor Cynthia! her troubles came thick and fast upon her in those days.\r\nWhen she reached home, there was the letter which Ephraim had left\r\non the table addressed in the familiar, upright handwriting, and when\r\nCynthia saw it, she caught her hand sharply at her breast, as if the\r\npain there had stopped the beating of her heart. Well it was for Bob's\r\npeace of mind that he could not see her as she read it, and before she\r\nhad come to the end there were drops on the sheets where the purple ink\r\nhad run. How precious would have been those drops to him! He would\r\nnever give her up. No mandate or decree could separate them--nothing\r\nbut death. And he was happier now so he told her--than he had been for\r\nmonths: happy in the thought that he was going out into the world to win\r\nbread for her, as became a man. Even if he had not her to strive for, he\r\nsaw now that such was the only course for him. He could not conform.\r\n\r\nIt was a manly letter,--how manly Bob himself never knew. But Cynthia\r\nknew, and she wept over it and even pressed it to her lips--for there\r\nwas no one to see. Yes, she loved him as she would not have believed it\r\npossible to love, and she sat through the afternoon reading his words\r\nand repeating them until it seemed that he were there by her side,\r\nspeaking them. They came, untrammelled and undefiled, from his heart\r\ninto hers.\r\n\r\nAnd now that he had quarrelled with his father for her sake, and was\r\nbent with all the determination of his character upon making his own way\r\nin the world, what was she to do? What was her duty? Not one letter\r\nof the twoscore she had received (so she kept their count from day to\r\nday)--not one had she answered. His faith had indeed been great. But\r\nshe must answer this: must write, too, on that subject of her dismissal,\r\nlest it should be wrongly told him. He was rash in his anger, and\r\nfearless; this she knew, and loved him for such qualities as he had.\r\n\r\nShe must stay in Brampton and do her work,--so much was clearly her\r\nduty, although she longed to flee from it. And at last she sat down and\r\nwrote to him. Some things are too sacred to be set forth on a printed\r\npage, and this letter is one of those things. Try as she would, she\r\ncould not find it in her heart at such a time to destroy his hope,--or\r\nher own. The hope which she would not acknowledge, and the love which\r\nshe strove to conceal from him seeped up between the words of her letter\r\nlike water through grains of sand. Words, indeed, are but as grains of\r\nsand to conceal strong feelings, and as Cynthia read the letter over she\r\nfelt that every line betrayed her, and knew that she could compose no\r\nlines which would not.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing of the summons which she had received that morning,\r\nor of her answer; and her account of the matter of the dismissal and\r\nreinstatement was brief and dignified, and contained no mention of Mr.\r\nWorthington's name or agency. It was her duty, too, to rebuke Bob for\r\nthe quarrel with his father, to point out the folly of it, and the\r\nwrong, and to urge him as strongly as she could to retract, though she\r\nfelt that all this was useless. And then--then came the betrayal of\r\nhope. She could not ask him never to see her again, but she did beseech\r\nhim for her sake, and for the sake of that love which he had declared,\r\nnot to attempt to see her: not for a year, she wrote, though the word\r\nlooked to her like eternity. Her reasons, aside from her own scruples,\r\nwere so obvious, while she taught in Brampton, that she felt that he\r\nwould consent to banishment--until the summer holidays in July, at\r\nleast: and then she would be in Coniston,--and would have had time to\r\ndecide upon future steps. A reprieve was all she craved,--a reprieve\r\nin which to reflect, for she was in no condition to reflect now. Of one\r\nthing she was sure, that it would not be right at this time to encourage\r\nhim although she had a guilty feeling that the letter had given him\r\nencouragement in spite of all the prohibitions it contained. “If, in the\r\nfuture years,” thought Cynthia, as she sealed the envelope, “he persists\r\nin his determination, what then?” You, Miss Lucretia, of all people in\r\nthe world, have planted the seeds with your talk about Genesis!\r\n\r\nThe letter was signed “One who will always remain your friend, Cynthia\r\nWetherell.” And she posted it herself.\r\n\r\nWhen Ephraim came home to supper that evening, he brought the Brampton\r\nClarion, just out, and in it was an account of Miss Lucretia Penniman's\r\nspeech at the mass meeting, and of her visit, and of her career. It was\r\nwritten in Mr. Page's best vein, and so laudatory was it that we shall\r\nhave to spare Miss Lucretia in not repeating it here: yes, and omit\r\nthe encomiums, too, on the teacher of the Brampton lower school. Mr.\r\nWorthington was not mentioned, and for this, at least, Cynthia drew\r\nalong breath of relief, though Ephraim was of the opinion that the\r\nfirst citizen should have been scored as he deserved, and held up to the\r\ncontempt of his fellow-townsmen. The dismissal of the teacher, indeed,\r\nwas put down to a regrettable misconception on the part of “one of the\r\nprudential committee,” who had confessed his mistake in “a manly and\r\naltogether praiseworthy speech.” The article was as near the truth,\r\nperhaps, as the Clarions may come on such matters--which is not very\r\nnear. Cynthia would have been better pleased if Mr. Page had spared\r\nhis readers the recital of her qualities, and she did not in the least\r\nrecognize the paragon whom Miss Lucretia had befriended and defended.\r\nShe was thankful that Mr. Page did pot state that the celebrity had come\r\nup from Boston on her account. Miss Penniman had been “actuated by a\r\nsudden desire to see once more the beauties of her old home, to look\r\ninto the faces of the old friends who had followed her career with such\r\npardonable pride.” The speech of the president of the literary club,\r\nyou may be sure, was printed in full, for Mr. Ives himself had taken the\r\ntrouble to write it out for the editor--by request, of course.\r\n\r\nCynthia turned over the sheet, and read many interesting items: one\r\nconcerning the beauty and fashion and intellect which attended the party\r\nat Mr. Gamaliel Ives's; in the Clovelly notes she saw that Miss Judy\r\nHatch, of Coniston, was visiting relatives there; she learned the output\r\nof the Worthington Mills for the past week. Cynthia was about to fold up\r\nthe paper and send it to Miss Lucretia, whom she thought it would amuse,\r\nwhen her eyes were arrested by the sight of a familiar name.\r\n\r\n        “Jethro Bass come to life again.\r\n          From the State Tribune.”\r\n\r\nThat was the heading. “One of the greatest political surprises in many\r\nyears was the arrival in the capital on Wednesday of Judge Bass, whom\r\nit was thought, had permanently retired from politics. This, at least,\r\nseems to have been the confident belief of a faction in the state who\r\nhave at heart the consolidation of certain lines of railroads. Judge\r\nBass was found by a Tribune reporter in the familiar Throne Room at the\r\nPelican, but, as usual, he could not be induced to talk for publication.\r\nHe was in conference throughout the afternoon with several well-known\r\nleaders from the North Country. The return of Jethro Bass to activity\r\nseriously complicates the railroad situation, and many prominent\r\npoliticians are freely predicting to-night that, in spite of the\r\ntown-meeting returns, the proposed bill for consolidation will not go\r\nthrough. Judge Bass is a man of such remarkable personality that he has\r\nregained at a stroke much of the influence that he lost by the sudden\r\nand unaccountable retirement which electrified the state some months\r\nsince. His reappearance, the news of which was the one topic in all\r\npolitical centres yesterday, is equally unaccountable. It is hinted that\r\nsome action on the part of Isaac D. Worthington has brought Jethro Bass\r\nto life. They are known to be bitter enemies, and it is said that\r\nJethro Bass has but one object in returning to the field--to crush the\r\npresident of the Truro Railroad. Another theory is that the railroads\r\nand interests opposed to the consolidation have induced Judge Bass\r\nto take charge of their fight for them. All indications point to the\r\nfiercest struggle the state has ever seen in June, when the Legislature\r\nmeets. The Tribune, whose sentiments are well known to be opposed to\r\nthe iniquity of consolidation, extends a hearty welcome to the judge. No\r\nstate, we believe, can claim a party leader of a higher order of ability\r\nthan Jethro Bass.”\r\n\r\nCynthia dropped the paper in her lap, and sat very still. This, then,\r\nwas what happened when Jethro had heard of her dismissal--he had left\r\nConiston without writing her a word and passed through Brampton without\r\nseeing her. He had gone back to that life which he had abandoned for her\r\nsake; the temptation had been too strong, the desire for vengeance too\r\ngreat. He had not dared to see her. And yet the love for her which had\r\nbeen strong enough to make him renounce the homage of men, and even\r\nincur their ridicule, had incited him to this very act of vengeance.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do now, indeed? Had those peaceful and happy Saturdays\r\nand Sundays in Coniston passed away forever? Should she follow him to\r\nthe capital and appeal to him? Ah no, she felt that were a useless pain\r\nto them both. She believed, now, that he had gone away from her for all\r\ntime, that the veil of limitless space was set between, them. Silently\r\nshe arose,--so silently that Ephraim, dozing by the fire, did not awake.\r\nShe went into her own room and wept, and after many hours fell into a\r\ndreamless sleep of sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, and the weeks; the snow ran from the brown fields, and\r\nmelted at length even in the moist crotches under the hemlocks of the\r\nnorthern slopes; the robin and bluebird came, the hillsides were mottled\r\nwith exquisite shades of green, and the scent of fruit blossom and balm\r\nof Gilead was in the air. June came as a maiden and grew into womanhood.\r\nBut Jethro Bass did not return to Coniston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe legends which surround the famous war which we are about to touch\r\nupon are as dim as those of Troy or Tuscany. Decorous chronicles and\r\nbiographies and monographs and eulogies exist, bound in leather and\r\nstamped in gold, each lauding its own hero: chronicles written in really\r\nbeautiful language, and high-minded and noble, out of which the heroes\r\ncome unstained. Horatius holds the bridge, and not a dent in his armor;\r\nand swims the Tiber without getting wet or muddy. Castor and Pollux\r\nfight in the front rank at Lake Regillus, in the midst of all that gore\r\nand slaughter, and emerge all white and pure at the end of the day--but\r\nthey are gods.\r\n\r\nOut of the classic wars to which we have referred sprang the great Roman\r\nRepublic and Empire, and legend runs into authentic and written history.\r\nJust so, parva componere magnis, out of the cloud-wrapped conflicts\r\nof the five railroads of which our own Gaul is composed, emerged one\r\nimperial railroad, authentically and legally written down on the statute\r\nbooks, for all men to see. We cannot go behind that statute except to\r\ncollect the legends and write homilies about the heroes who held the\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nIf we were not in mortal terror of the imperial power, and a little\r\nfearful, too, of tiring our readers, we would write out all the legends\r\nwe have collected of this first fight for consolidation, and show the\r\nblood, too.\r\n\r\nIn the statute books of a certain state may be found a number of laws\r\nsetting forth the various things that a railroad or railroads may do,\r\nand on the margin of these pages is invariably printed a date, that\r\nbeing the particular year in which these laws were passed. By a singular\r\ncoincidence it is the very year at which we have now arrived in our\r\nstory. We do not intend to give a map of the state, or discuss\r\nthe merits or demerits of the consolidation of the Central and the\r\nNorthwestern and the Truro railroads. Such discussions are not the\r\nprovince of a novelist, and may all be found in the files of the Tribune\r\nat the State Library. There were, likewise, decisions without number\r\nhanded down by the various courts before and after that celebrated\r\nsession,--opinions on the validity of leases, on the extension of\r\nrailroads, on the rights of individual stockholders--all dry reading\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of being picked to pieces by the corporation lawyers who may\r\nread these pages, we shall attempt to state the situation and with all\r\nmodesty and impartiality--for we, at least, hold no brief. When Mr.\r\nIsaac D. Worthington obtained that extension of the Truro Railroad\r\n(which we have read about from the somewhat verdant point of view of\r\nWilliam Wetherell), that railroad then formed a connection with another\r\nroad which ran northward from Harwich through another state, and with\r\nwhich we have nothing to do. Having previously purchased a line to the\r\nsouthward from the capital, Mr. Worthington's railroad was in a position\r\nto compete with Mr. Duncan's (the “Central”) for Canadian traffic, and\r\nalso to cut into the profits of the “Northwestern,” Mr. Lovejoy's road.\r\nIn brief, the Truro Railroad found itself very advantageously placed, as\r\nMr. Worthington and Mr. Flint had foreseen. There followed a period of\r\nbickering and recrimination, of attempts of the other two railroads to\r\nsecure representation in the Truro directorate, of suits and injunctions\r\nand appeals to the Legislature and I know not what else--in all of which\r\naffairs Mr. Bijah Bixby and other gentlemen we could name found both\r\npleasure and remuneration.\r\n\r\nOh, that those halcyon days of the little wars would come again, when\r\na captain could ride out almost any time at the held of his band of\r\nmercenaries and see honest fighting and divide honest spoils! There was\r\nmuch knocking about of men and horses, but very little bloodshed, so we\r\nare told. Mr. Bixby will sit on the sunny side of his barns in Clovelly\r\nand tell you stories of that golden period with tears in his eyes, when\r\nhe went to conventions with a pocketful of proxies from the river towns,\r\nand controlled in the greatest legislative year of all a “block” which\r\nincluded the President of the Senate, for which he got the fabulous sum\r\nof----. He will tell you, but I won't. Mr. Bixby's occupation is gone\r\nnow. We have changed all that, and we are ruled from imperial Rome. If\r\nyou don't do right, they cut off your (political) head, and it is of no\r\nuse to run away, because there is no one to run to.\r\n\r\nIt was Isaac D. Worthington--or shall we say Mr. Flint?--who was\r\nresponsible for this pernicious change for the worse, who conceived the\r\nnotion of leasing for the Truro the Central and the Northwestern,--thus\r\nmaking one railroad out of the three. If such a gigantic undertaking\r\ncould be got through, Mr. Worthington very rightly deemed that the other\r\nrailroads of the state would eventually fall like ripe fruit into their\r\ncaps--owning the ground under the tree, as they would. A movement, which\r\nwe need not go unto, was first made upon the courts, and for a while\r\nadverse decisions came down like summer rain. A genius by the name of\r\nJethro Bass had for many years presided (in the room of the governor and\r\ncouncil at the State House) at the political birth of justices of the\r\nSupreme Court. None of them actually wore livery, but we have seen one\r\nof them--along time ago--in a horse blanket. None of them were favorable\r\nto the plans of Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\nWe have listened to the firing on the skirmish lines for a long time,\r\nand now the real battle is at hand. It is June, and the Legislature is\r\nmeeting, and Bijah Bixby has come down to the capital at the head of his\r\nregiment of mercenaries, of which Mr. Sutton is the honorary colonel;\r\nthe clans are here from the north, well quartered and well fed; the\r\nThrone Room, within the sacred precincts of which we have been before,\r\nis occupied. But there is another headquarters now, too, in the Pelican\r\nHouse--a Railroad Room; larger than the Throne Room, with a bath-room\r\nleading out of it. Another old friend of ours, Judge Abner Parkinson of\r\nHarwich, he who gave the sardonic laugh when Sam Price applied for the\r\npost of road agent, may often be seen in that Railroad Room from now\r\non. The fact is that the judge is about to become famous far beyond\r\nthe confines of Harwich; for he, and none other, is the author of the\r\nConsolidation Bill itself.\r\n\r\nMr. Flint is the generalissimo of the allied railroads, and sits in his\r\nheadquarters early and late, going over the details of the campaign with\r\nhis lieutenants; scanning the clauses of the bill with Judge Parkinson\r\nfor the last time, and giving orders to the captains of mercenaries as\r\nto the disposition of their forces; writing out passes for the deserving\r\nand the true. For these latter, also, and for the wavering there is a\r\nclaw-hammer on the marble-topped mantel wielded by Mr. Bijah Bixby, pro\r\ntem chief of staff--or of the hammer, for he is self-appointed and\r\nvery useful. He opens the mysterious packing cases which come up to\r\nthe Railroad Room thrice a week, and there is water to be had in the\r\nbath-room--and glasses. Mr. Bixby also finds time to do some of\r\nthe scouting about the rotunda and lobbies, for which he is justly\r\ncelebrated, and to drill his regiment every day. The Honorable Heth\r\nSutton, M.C.,--who held the bridge in the Woodchuck Session,--is there\r\nalso, sitting in a corner, swelled with importance, smoking big Florizel\r\ncigars which come from--somewhere. There are, indeed, many great and\r\nbattle-scarred veterans who congregate in that room--too numerous and\r\ngreat to mention; and saunterers in the Capitol Park opposite know when\r\na council of war is being held by the volumes of smoke which pour out\r\nof the window, just as the Romans are made cognizant by the smoking of a\r\nchimney of when another notable event takes place.\r\n\r\nWho, then, are left to frequent the Throne Room? Is that ancient seat\r\nof power deserted, and does Jethro Bass sit there alone behind the\r\ncurtains, in his bitterness, thinking of other bright June days that are\r\ngone?\r\n\r\nOf all those who had been amazed when Jethro Bass suddenly emerged from\r\nhis retirement and appeared in the capital some months before, none\r\nwere more thunderstruck than certain gentlemen who had been to Coniston\r\nrepeatedly, but in vain, to urge him to make this very fight. The most\r\nimportant of these had been Mr. Balch, president of the “Down East”\r\n Road, and the representatives of two railroads of another state. They\r\nhad at last offered Jethro fabulous sums to take charge of their armies\r\nin the field--sums, at least, that would seem fabulous to many people,\r\nand had seemed so to them. When they heard that the lion had roused and\r\nshaken himself and had unaccountably come forth of his own accord, they\r\nhastened to the state capital to renew their offers. Another shock, but\r\nof a different kind, was in store for them. Mr. Balch had not actually\r\ndriven the pack-mules, laden with treasure, to the door of the Pelican\r\nHouse, where Jethro might see them from his window; but he requested\r\na private audience, and it was probably accidental that the end of his\r\npersonal check-book protruded a little from his pocket. He was a big,\r\ncoarse-grained man, Mr. Balch, who had once been a brakeman, and had\r\nrisen by what is known as horse sense to the presidency of his road.\r\nThere was a wonderful sunset beyond the Capitol, but Mr. Balch did not\r\ntalk about the sunset, although Jethro was watching it from behind the\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\n“If you are willing to undertake this fight against consolidation,” said\r\nMr. Balch, “we are ready to talk business with you.”\r\n\r\n“D-don't know what you're going to, do,” answered Jethro; “I'm going to\r\nprevent consolidation, if I can.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Balch, smiling. He regarded this reply as one of\r\nJethro's delicate euphemisms. “We're prepared to give that same little\r\nretainer.”\r\n\r\nJethro did not look up. Mr. Balch went to the table and seized a pen and\r\nfilled out a check for an amount that shall be nameless.\r\n\r\n“I have made it payable to bearer, as usual,” he said, and he handed it\r\nto Jethro.\r\n\r\nJethro took it, and absently tore it into little pieces, and threw the\r\npieces on the floor. Mr. Balch watched him in consternation. He began to\r\nthink the report that Jethro had reached his second childhood was true.\r\n\r\n“What in Halifax are you doing, Bass?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“W-want to stop this consolidation, don't you--want' to stop it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do.”\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to do all you can to stop it hain't you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I am.”\r\n\r\n“I-I'll help you,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Help us!” exclaimed Balch. “Great Scott, we want you to take charge of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I-I'll do all I can, but I won't guarantee it--w-won't guarantee it,”\r\n said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“We don't ask you to guarantee it. If you'll do all you can, that's\r\nenough. You won't take a retainer?”\r\n\r\n“W-won't take anything,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“You mean to say you don't want anything for your for your time and your\r\nservices if the bill is defeated?”\r\n\r\n“T-that's about it, Ed. Little p-private matter with both of us. You\r\ndon't want consolidation, and I don't. I hain't offered to give you a\r\nretainer--have I?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the astounded Mr. Balch. He scratched his head and fingered\r\nthe leaves of his check-book. The captains over the tens and the\r\ncaptains over the hundreds would want little retainers--and who was to\r\npay these? “How about the boys?” asked Mr. Balch.\r\n\r\n“S-still got the same office in the depot--hain't you, Ed, s-same\r\noffice?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“G-guess the boys hev b'en there before,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Balch went away, meditating upon those sayings, and took the train\r\nfor Boston. If he had waked up of a fine morning to find himself at\r\nthe head of some benevolent and charitable organization, instead of the\r\n“Down East” Railroad, he could not have been more astonished than he\r\nhad been at the unaccountable change of heart of Jethro Bass. He did not\r\nknow what to make of it, and told his colleagues so; and at first they\r\nfeared one of two things,--treachery or lunacy. But a little later\r\na rumor reached Mr. Balch's ears that Jethro's hatred of Isaac D.\r\nWorthington was at the bottom of his reappearance in public life,\r\nalthough Jethro himself never mentioned Mr. Worthington's name. Jethro\r\nsat in the Throne Room, consulting, directing day after day, and when\r\nthe Legislature assembled, “the boys” began to call at Mr. Balch's\r\noffice. But Mr. Balch never again broached the subject of money to\r\nJethro Bass.\r\n\r\nWe have to sing the song of sixpence for the last time in these pages;\r\nand as it is an old song now, there will be no encores. If you can buy\r\none member of the lower house for ten dollars, how many members can you\r\nbuy for fifty? It was no such problem in primary arithmetic that Mr.\r\nBalch and his associates had to solve--theirs was in higher mathematics,\r\nin permutations and combinations, and in least squares. No wonder the\r\nold campaigners speak with tears in their eyes of the days of that ever\r\nmemorable summer. There were spoils to be picked up in the very streets\r\nricher than the sack of the thirty cities; and as the session wore on\r\nit is affirmed by men still living that money rained down in the Capitol\r\nPark and elsewhere like manna from the skies, if you were one of a\r\nchosen band. If you were, all you had to do was to look in your vest\r\npockets when you took your clothes off in the evening and extract enough\r\nlegal tender to pay your bill at the Pelican for a week. Mr. Lovejoy\r\nhaving been overheard one day to make a remark concerning the diet of\r\nhogs, the next morning certain visitors to the capital were horrified\r\nto discover trails of corn leading from the Pelican House to their\r\ndoorways. Men who had never seen a receiving teller opened bank\r\naccounts. No, it was not a problem in simple arithmetic, and Mr. Balch\r\nand Mr. Flint, and even Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington, covered whole\r\nsheets with figures during the stifling days in July. Some men are so\r\nvaluable that they can be bought twice, or even three times, and they\r\nmake figuring complicated.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass did no calculating. He sat behind the curtains, and he must\r\nhave kept the figures in his head.\r\n\r\nThe battle had closed in earnest, and for twelve long, sultry weeks it\r\nraged with unabated fierceness. Consolidation had a terror for the\r\nrural mind, and the state Tribune skilfully played its stream upon the\r\nconstituents of those gentlemen who stood tamely at the Worthington\r\nhitching-posts, and the constituents flocked to the capital; that able\r\nnewspaper, too, found space to return, with interest, the attacks of Mr.\r\nWorthington's organ, the Newcastle Guardian. These amenities are much\r\ntoo personal to reproduce here, now that the smoke of battle has rolled\r\naway. An epic could be written upon the conflict, if there were space:\r\nCanto One, the first position carried triumphantly, though at some\r\nexpense, by the Worthington forces, who elect the Speaker. That had\r\nbeen a crucial time before the town meetings, when Jethro abdicated. The\r\nWorthington Speaker goes ahead with his committees, and it is needless\r\nto say that Mr. Chauncey Weed is not made Chairman of the Committee\r\non Corporations. As an offset to this, the Jethro forces gain on the\r\nextreme right, where the Honorable Peleg Hartington is made President of\r\nthe Senate, etc.\r\n\r\nFor twelve hot weeks, with a public spirit which is worthy of the\r\nhighest praise, the Committee sit in their shirt sleeves all day long\r\nand listen to arguments for and against consolidation; and ask learned\r\nquestions that startle rural witnesses; and smoke big Florizel cigars (a\r\nmajority of them). Judge Abner Parkinson defends his bill, quoting from\r\nthe Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and the Bible;\r\na celebrated lawyer from the capital riddles it, using the same\r\nauthorities, and citing the Federalist and the Golden Rule in addition.\r\nThe Committee sit open-minded, listening with laudable impartiality; it\r\ndoes not become them to arrive at a hasty decision on a question of such\r\nmagnitude. In the meantime the House passes an important bill dealing\r\nwith the bounty on hedgehogs, and there are several card games going on\r\nin the cellar, where it is cool.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the state is a free lance, and may be seen any afternoon\r\nwalking through the park, consorting with no one. He may be recognized\r\neven at a distance by his portly figure, his silk hat, and his dignified\r\nmien. Yes, it is an old and valued friend, the Honorable Alva Hopkins,\r\npatron of the drama, and sometimes he has a beautiful young woman (still\r\nunattached) by his side. He lives in a suite of rooms at the Pelican.\r\nIt is a well-known fact (among Mr. Worthington's supporters) that the\r\nHonorable Alva promised in January, when Mr. Bass retired, to sign the\r\nConsolidation Bill, and that he suddenly became open-minded in March,\r\nand has remained open-minded ever since, listening gravely to arguments,\r\nand giving much study to the subject. He is an executive now, although\r\nit is the last year of his term, and of course he is never seen either\r\nin the Throne Room or the Railroad Room. And besides, he may become a\r\nsenator.\r\n\r\nAugust has come, and the forces are spent and panting, and neither side\r\ndares to risk the final charge. The reputation of Jethro Bass is at\r\nstake. Should he risk and lose, he must go back to Coniston a beaten\r\nman, subject to the contempt of his neighbors and his state. People\r\ndo not know that he has nothing now to go back to, and that he cares\r\nnothing for contempt. As he sits in his window day after day he has only\r\none thought and one wish,--to ruin Isaac D. Worthington. And he will do\r\nit if he can. Those who know--and among them is Mr. Balch himself--say\r\nthat Jethro has never conducted a more masterly campaign than this, and\r\nthat all the others have been mere childish trials of strength compared\r\nto it. So he sits there through those twelve weeks while the session\r\nslips by, while his opponents grumble, and while even his supporters,\r\neager for the charge, complain. The truth is that in all the years of\r\nhis activity be has never had such an antagonist as Mr. Flint. Victory\r\nhangs in the balance, and a false move will throw it to either side.\r\n\r\nVictory hangs now, to be explicit, upon two factors. The first and\r\nmost immediate of these is a certain canny captain of many wars whose\r\nregiment is still at the disposal of either army--for a price, a\r\nregiment which has hitherto remained strictly neutral. And what a\r\nregiment it is! A block of river towns and a senator, and not a casualty\r\nsince they marched boldly into camp twelve weeks ago. Mr. Batch is\r\ngetting very much worried about this regiment, and beginning to doubt\r\nJethro's judgment.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Bass,” he said one evening, “if you allow him to run around\r\nloose much longer, we're lost, that's all there is to it!” (Mr. Batch\r\nreferred to the captain in question.) “They'll buy up his block at his\r\nfigure--see, if they don't. They're getting desperate. Don't you think\r\nI'd better bid him in?”\r\n\r\n“B-bid him in if you've a mind to; Ed.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Jethro,” said Mr. Batch, savagely biting off the end of a\r\ncigar, “I'm beginning to think you don't care a continental about this\r\nbusiness. Which side are you on, anyway?” The heat and the length\r\nand the uncertainty of the struggle were telling on the nerves of the\r\nrailroad president. “You sit there from morning till night and won't say\r\nanything; and now, when there's only one block out, you won't give the\r\nword to buy it.”\r\n\r\n“N-never told you to buy anything, did I--Ed?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Mr. Batch, “you haven't. I don't know what the devil's\r\ngot into you.”\r\n\r\n“D-done all the payin' without consultin' me, hain't you, Ed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have. What are you driving at?”\r\n\r\n“D-done it if I hadn't b'en here, wouldn't you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and more too,” said Mr. Batch.\r\n\r\n“W-wouldn't make much difference to you if I wasn't here--would it?”\r\n\r\n“Great Scott, Jethro, what do you mean?” cried the railroad president,\r\nin genuine alarm; “you're not going to pull out, are you?”\r\n\r\n“W-wouldn't make much odds if I did--would it, Ed?”\r\n\r\n“The devil it wouldn't!” exclaimed Mr. Balch. “If you pulled out, we'd\r\nlose the North Country, and Peleg, and Gosport, and nobody can\r\ntell which way Alva Hopkins will swing. I guess you know what he'll\r\ndo--you're so d--d secretive I can't tell whether you do or not. If you\r\npulled out, they'd have their bill on Friday.”\r\n\r\n“H-hain't under any obligations to you, Ed--am I?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mr. Batch, “but I don't see why you keep harping on that.”\r\n\r\n“J-dust wanted to have it clear,” said Jethro, and relapsed into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThere was a fireproof carpet on the Throne Room, and Mr. Batch flung\r\ndown his cigar and stamped on it and went out. No wonder he could not\r\nunderstand Jethro's sudden scruples about money and obligations--about\r\nrailroad money, that is. Jethro was spending some of his own, but not in\r\nthe capital, and in a manner which was most effective. In short, at the\r\nvery moment when Mr. Batch stamped on his cigar, Jethro had the victory\r\nin his hands--only he did not choose to say so. He had had a mysterious\r\ntelegram that day from Harwich, signed by Chauncey Weed, and Mr. Weed\r\nhimself appeared at the door of Number 7, fresh from his travels,\r\nshortly after Mr. Batch had gone out of it. Mr. Weed closed the door\r\ngently, and locked it, and sat down in a rocking chair close to Jethro\r\nand put his hand over his mouth. We cannot hear what Mr. Weed is saying.\r\nAll is mystery here, and in order to preserve that mystery we shall\r\ndelay for a little the few words which will explain Mr. Weed's\r\nsuccessful mission.\r\n\r\nMr. Batch, angry and bewildered, descended into the rotunda, where he\r\nshortly heard two astounding pieces of news. The first was that the\r\nHonorable Heth Sutton had abandoned the Florizel cigars and had gone\r\nhome to Clovelly. The second; that Mr. Bijah Bixby had resigned the\r\nclaw-hammer and had ceased to open the packing cases in the Railroad\r\nRoom. Consternation reigned in that room, so it was said (and this was\r\ntrue). Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Lovejoy were closeted\r\nthere with Mr. Flint, and the door was locked and the transom shut, and\r\nsmoke was coming out of the windows.\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Bijah Bixby is the canny captain of whom Mr. Balch spoke: he\r\nit is who owns that block of river towns, intact, and the one senator.\r\nImpossible! We have seen him opening the packing cases, we have seen him\r\nworking for the Worthington faction for the last two years. Mr.\r\nBixby was very willing to open boxes, and to make himself useful and\r\nagreeable; but it must be remembered that a good captain of mercenaries\r\nowes a sacred duty to his followers. At first Mr. Flint had thought he\r\ncould count on Mr. Bixby; after a while he made several unsuccessful\r\nattempts to talk business with him; a particularly difficult thing to\r\ndo, even for Mr. Flint, when Mr. Bixby did not wish to talk business.\r\nMr. Balch had found it quite as difficult to entice Mr. Bixby away from\r\nthe boxes and the Railroad Room. The weeks drifted on, until twelve went\r\nby, and then Mr. Bixby found himself, with his block of river towns and\r\none senator, in the incomparable position of being the arbiter of the\r\nfate of the Consolidation Bill in the House and Senate. No wonder Mr.\r\nBalch wanted to buy the services of that famous regiment at any price!\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bixby, for once in his life, had waited too long.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Balch, rejoicing, but not a little indignant at not having\r\nbeen taken into confidence, ascended to the Throne Room after supper to\r\nquestion Jethro concerning the meaning of the things he had heard, he\r\nfound Senator Peleg Hartington seated mournfully on the bed, talking at\r\nintervals, and Jethro listening.\r\n\r\n“Come up and eat out of my hand,” said the senator.\r\n\r\n“Who?” demanded Mr. Balch.\r\n\r\n“Bije,” answered the senator.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott, do you mean to say you've got Bixby?” exclaimed the\r\nrailroad president. He felt as if he would like to shake the senator,\r\nwho was so deliberate and mournful in his answers. “What did you pay\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington appeared shocked by the question.\r\n\r\n“Guess Heth Sutton will settle with him,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Heth Sutton! Why the--why should Heth pay him?”\r\n\r\n“Guess Heth'd like to make him a little present, under the\r\ncircumstances. I was goin' through the barber shop,” Mr. Hartington\r\ncontinued, speaking to Jethro and ignoring the railroad president,\r\n“and I heard somebody whisperin' my name. Sound came out of that little\r\nshampoo closet; went in there and found Bije. 'Peleg,' says he, right\r\ninto my ear, 'tell Jethro it's all right--you understand. We want Heth\r\nto go back--break his heart if he didn't--you understand. If I'd knowed\r\nlast winter Jethro meant business, I wouldn't hev' helped Gus Flint out.\r\nTell Jethro he can have 'em--you know what I mean.' Bije waited a little\r\nmite too long,” said the senator, who had given a very fair imitation of\r\nMr. Bixby's nasal voice and manner.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm d--d!” ejaculated Mr. Balch, staring at Jethro. “How did you\r\nwork it?”\r\n\r\n“Sent Chauncey through the deestrict,” said Mr. Hartington.\r\n\r\nMr. Chauncey Weed had, in truth, gone through a part of the\r\ncongressional district of the Honorable Heth Sutton with a little\r\nleather bag. Mr. Weed had been able to do some of his work (with the\r\nlittle leather bag) in the capital itself. In this way Mr. Bixby's\r\nregiment, Sutton was the honorary colonel, had been attacked in the rear\r\nand routed. Here was to be a congressional convention that autumn, and a\r\nlarge part of Mr. Sutton's district lay in the North Country, which, as\r\nwe have seen, was loyal to Jethro to the back bone. The district, too,\r\nwas largely rural, and therefore anti-consolidation, and the inability\r\nof the Worthington forces to get their bill through had made it apparent\r\nthat Jethro Bass was as powerful as ever. Under these circumstances\r\nit had not been very difficult for a gentleman of Mr. Chauncey Weed's\r\npowers of persuasion to induce various lieutenants in the district\r\nto agree to send delegates to the coming convention who would be\r\nconscientiously opposed to Mr. Sutton's renomination: hence the\r\ndeparture from the capital of Mr. Sutton; hence the generous offer\r\nof Mr. Bixby to put his regiment at the disposal of Mr. Bass--free of\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe second factor on which victory hung (we can use the past tense now)\r\nwas none other than his Excellency Alva Hopkins, governor of the state.\r\nThe bill would never get to his Excellency now--so people said; would\r\nnever get beyond that committee who had listened so patiently to the\r\ntwelve weeks of argument. These were only rumors, after all, for the\r\nrotunda never knows positively what goes on in high circles; but the\r\nrotunda does figuring, too, when at length the problem is reduced to a\r\nsimple equation, with Bijah Bixby as x. If it were true that Bijah had\r\ngone over to Jethro Bass, the Consolidation Bill was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nWhen Jethro Bass walked out of the hotel that evening men looked at him,\r\nand made way for him, but none spoke to him. There was something in his\r\nface that forbade speech. He was a great man once more--a greater man\r\nthan ever; and he had, if the persistent rumors were true, accomplished\r\nan almost incomprehensible feat, even for Jethro Bass. There was another\r\nreason, too, why they stared at him. In all those twelve weeks of that\r\nmost trying of all sessions he had not once gone into the street, and\r\nhe had been less than ever common in the eyes of men. Twice a day he had\r\ndescended to the dining room for a simple meal--that was all; and fewer\r\nhad gained entrance to Room Number 7 this session than ever before.\r\n\r\nThere is a river that flows by the capital, a wide and gentle river\r\nbordered by green meadows and fringed with willows; higher up, if you go\r\nfar enough, a forest comes down to the water on the western side. Jethro\r\nwalked through the hooded bridge, and up the eastern bank until he could\r\nsee the forest like a black band between the orange sky and the orange\r\nriver, and there he sat down upon a fallen log on the edge of the bank.\r\nBut Jethro was thinking of another scene,--of a granite-ribbed pasture\r\non Coniston Mountain that swings in limitless space, from either end of\r\nwhich a man may step off into eternity. William Wetherell, in one of\r\nhis letters, had described that place as the Threshold of the Nameless\r\nWorlds, and so it had seemed to Jethro in the years of his desolation.\r\nHe was thinking of it now, even as it had been in his mind that winter's\r\nevening when Cynthia had come to Coniston and had surprised him with\r\nthat look of terrible loneliness on his face.\r\n\r\nYes, and he was thinking of Cynthia. When, indeed, had he not been\r\nthinking of her? How many tunes had he rehearsed the events in the\r\ntannery house--for they were the events of his life now. The triumphs\r\nover his opponents and enemies fell away, and the pride of power. Such\r\nhad not been his achievements. She had loved him, and no man had reached\r\na higher pinnacle than that.\r\n\r\nWhy he had forfeited that love for vengeance, he could not tell. The\r\nembers of a man's passions will suddenly burst into flame, and he will\r\nfiddle madly while the fire burns his soul. He had avenged her as well\r\nas himself; but had he avenged her, now that he held Isaac Worthington\r\nin his power? By crushing him, had he not added to her trouble and her\r\nsorrow? She had confessed that she loved Isaac Worthington's son, and\r\nwas not he (Jethro) widening the breach between Cynthia and the son by\r\ncrushing the father? Jethro had not thought of this. But he had thought\r\nof her, night and day, as he had sat in his room directing the battle.\r\nNot a day had passed that he had not looked for a letter, hoping against\r\nhope. If she had written to him once, if she had come to him once, would\r\nhe have desisted? He could not say--the fires of hatred had burned so\r\nfiercely, and still burned so fiercely, that he clenched his fists when\r\nit came over him that Isaac Worthington was at last in his power.\r\n\r\nA white line above the forest was all that remained of the sunset when\r\nhe rose up and took from his coat a silver locket and opened it and held\r\nit to the fading light. Presently he closed it again, and walked slowly\r\nalong the river bank toward the little city twinkling on its hill. He\r\ncrossed the hooded bridge and climbed the slope, stopping for a moment\r\nat a little stationery shop; he passed through the groups which were\r\nstill loudly discussing this thing he had done, and gained his room and\r\nlocked the door. Men came to it and knocked and got no answer. The room\r\nwas in darkness, and the night breeze stirred among the trees in the\r\npark and blew in at the window.\r\n\r\nAt last Jethro got up and lighted the gas and paused at the centre\r\ntable. He was to violate more than one principle of his life that night,\r\nthough not without a struggle; and he sat for a long while looking at\r\nthe blank paper before him. Then he wrote, and sealed the letter--which\r\ncontained three lines--and pulled the bell cord. The call was answered\r\nby a messenger who had been far many years in the service of the Pelican\r\nHouse, and who knew many secrets of the gods. The man actually grew pale\r\nwhen he saw the address on the envelope which was put in his hand and\r\nread the denomination of the crisp note under it that was the price of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“F-find the gentleman and give it to him yourself. Er--John?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Bass?”\r\n\r\n“If you don't find him, bring it--back.”\r\n\r\nWhen the man had gone, Jethro turned down the gas and went again to his\r\nchair by the window. For a while voices came up to him from the street,\r\nbut at length the groups dispersed, one by one; and a distant clock\r\nboomed out eleven solemn strokes. Twice the clock struck again, at the\r\nhalf-hour and midnight, and the noises in the house--the banging\r\nof doors and the jangling of keys and the hurrying of feet in the\r\ncorridors--were hushed. Jethro took no thought of these or of time, and\r\nsat gazing at the stars in the depths of the sky above the capital dome\r\nuntil a shadow emerged from the black mass of the trees opposite\r\nand crossed the street. In a few minutes there were footsteps in the\r\ncorridor,--stealthy footsteps--and a knock on the door. Jethro got up\r\nand opened it, and closed it again and locked it. Then he turned up the\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n“S-sit down,” he said, and nodded his head toward the chair by the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington laid his silk hat on the table, and sat down. He\r\nlooked very haggard and worn in that light, very unlike the first\r\ncitizen who had entered Brampton in triumph on his return from the West\r\nnot many months before. The long strain of a long fight, in which he had\r\nrisked much for which he had labored a life to gain, had told on him,\r\nand there were crow's-feet at the corners of, his eyes, and dark circles\r\nunder them. Isaac Worthington had never lost before, and to destroy the\r\nfruits of such a man's ambition is to destroy the man. He was not as\r\nyoung as he had once been. But now, in the very hour of defeat, hope\r\nhad rekindled the fire in the eyes and brought back the peculiar,\r\ntight-lipped, mocking smile to the mouth. An hour ago, when he had\r\nbeen pacing Alexander Duncan's library, the eyes and the mouth had been\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nLong habit asserts itself at the strangest moments. Jethro Bass took his\r\nseat by the window, and remained silent. The clock tolled the half-hour\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\n“You wanted to see me,” said Mr. Worthington, finally.\r\n\r\nJethro nodded, almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Mr. Worthington, slowly, “I suppose you are ready to\r\nsell out.” He found it a little difficult to control his voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Jethro, “r-ready to sell out.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington was somewhat taken aback by this simple admission. He\r\nglanced at Jethro sitting motionless by the window, and in his heart\r\nhe feared him: he had come into that room when the gas was low, afraid.\r\nAlthough he would not confess it to himself, he had been in fear of\r\nJethro Bass all his life, and his fear had been greater than ever since\r\nthe March day when Jethro had left Coniston. And could he have known,\r\nnow, the fires of hatred burning in Jethro's breast, Isaac Worthington\r\nwould have been in terror indeed.\r\n\r\n“What have you got to sell?” he demanded sharply.\r\n\r\n“G-guess you know, or you wouldn't have come here.”\r\n\r\n“What proof have I that you have it to sell?”\r\n\r\nJethro looked at him for an instant.\r\n\r\n“M-my word,” he said.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington was silent for a while: he was striving to calm\r\nhimself, for an indefinable something had shaken him. The strange\r\nstillness of the hour and the stranger atmosphere which seemed to\r\nsurround this transaction filled him with a nameless dread. The man in\r\nthe window had been his lifelong enemy: more than this, Jethro Bass, was\r\nnot like ordinary men--his ways were enshrouded in mystery, and when he\r\nstruck, he struck hard. There grew upon Isaac Worthington a sense that\r\nthis midnight hour was in some way to be the culmination of the long\r\nyears of hatred between them.\r\n\r\nHe believed Jethro: he would have believed him even if Mr. Flint had not\r\ninformed him that afternoon that he was beaten, and bitterly he wished\r\nhe had taken Mr. Flint's advice many months before. Denunciation\r\nsprang to his lips which he dared not utter. He was beaten, and he must\r\npay--the pound of flesh. Isaac Worthington almost thought it would be a\r\npound of flesh.\r\n\r\n“How much do you want?” he said.\r\n\r\nAgain Jethro looked at him.\r\n\r\n“B-biggest price you can pay,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“You must have made up your mind what you want. You've had time enough.”\r\n\r\n“H-have made up my mind,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Make your demand,” said Mr. Worthington, “and I'll give you my answer.”\r\n\r\n“B-biggest price you can pay,” said Jethro, again.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington's nerves could stand it no longer.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he cried, rising in his chair, “if you've brought me here\r\nto trifle with me, you've made a mistake. It's your business to get\r\ncontrol of things that belong to other people, and sell them out. I\r\nam here to buy. Nothing but necessity brings me here, and nothing but\r\nnecessity will keep me here a moment longer than I have to stay to\r\nfinish this abominable affair. I am ready to pay you twenty thousand\r\ndollars the day that bill becomes a law.”\r\n\r\nThis time Jethro did not look at him.\r\n\r\n“P-pay me now,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I will pay you the day the bill becomes a law. Then I shall know where\r\nI stand.”\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer this ultimatum in any manner, but remained\r\nperfectly still looking out of the window. Mr. Worthington glanced at\r\nhim, twice, and got his fingers on the brim of his hat, but he did not\r\npick it up. He stood so for a while, knowing full well that if he went\r\nout of that room his chance was gone. Consolidation might come in other\r\nyears, but he, Isaac Worthington, would not be a factor in it.\r\n\r\n“You don't want a check, do you?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“No--d-don't want a check.”\r\n\r\n“What in God's name do you want? I haven't got twenty thousand dollars\r\nin currency in my pocket.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Isaac Worthington,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington sat down--out of sheer astonishment, perhaps.\r\n\r\n“W-want the consolidation--don't you? Want it bad--don't you?”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington did, not answer. Jethro stood over him now, looking down\r\nat him from the other side of the narrow table.\r\n\r\n“Know Cynthy Wetherell?” he said.\r\n\r\nThen Isaac Worthington understood that his premonitions had been real.\r\nThe pound of flesh was to be demanded, but strangely enough, he did not\r\nyet comprehend the nature of it.\r\n\r\n“I know that there is such a person,” he answered, for his pride would\r\nnot permit him to say more.\r\n\r\n“W-what do you know about her?”\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington was bitterly angry--the more so because he was\r\nhelpless, and could not question Jethro's right to ask. What did he\r\nknow about her? Nothing, except that she had intrigued to marry his son.\r\nBob's letter had described her, to be sure, but he could not be expected\r\nto believe that: and he had not heard Miss Lucretia Penniman's speech.\r\nAnd yet he could not tell Jethro that he knew nothing about her, for he\r\nwas shrewd enough to perceive the drift of the next question.\r\n\r\n“Kn-know anything against her?” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n“I can't see what Miss Wetherell has to do with the present occasion,”\r\n he replied.\r\n\r\n“H-had her dismissed by the prudential committee had her\r\ndismissed--didn't you?”\r\n\r\n“They chose to act as they saw fit.”\r\n\r\n“T-told Levi Dodd to dismiss her--didn't you?”\r\n\r\nThat was a matter of common knowledge in Brampton, having leaked out\r\nthrough Jonathan Hill.\r\n\r\n“I must decline to discuss this,” said Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“W-wouldn't if I was you.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“What I say. T-told Levi Dodd to dismiss her, didn't you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did.” Isaac Worthington had lost in self-esteem by not saying so\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Why? Wahn't she honest? Wahn't she capable? Wahn't she a lady?”\r\n\r\n“I can't say that I know anything against Miss Wetherell's character, if\r\nthat's what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“F-fit to teach--wahn't she--fit to teach?”\r\n\r\n“I believe she has since qualified before Mr. Errol.”\r\n\r\n“Fit to teach--wahn't fit to marry your son--was she?”\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington clutched the table and started from his chair. He\r\ngrew white to his lips with anger, and yet he knew that he must control\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bass,” he said, “you have something to sell, and I have something\r\nto buy--if the price is not ruinous. Let us confine ourselves to that.\r\nMy affairs and my son's affairs are neither here nor there. I ask you\r\nagain, how much do you want for this Consolidation Bill?”\r\n\r\n“N-no money will buy it.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“C-consent to this marriage, c-consent to this marriage.” There was yet\r\nroom for Isaac Worthington to be amazed, and for a while he stared up at\r\nJethro, speechless.\r\n\r\n“Is that your price?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“Th-that's my price,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington got up and went to the window and stood looking\r\nout above the black mass of trees at the dome outlined against the\r\nstar-flecked sky. At first his anger choked him, and he could not\r\nthink; he had just enough reason left not to walk out of the door. But\r\npresently habit asserted itself in him, too, and he began to reflect\r\nand calculate in spite of his anger. It is strange that memory plays so\r\nsmall a part in such a man. Before he allowed his mind to dwell on the\r\nfearful price, he thought of his ambitions gratified; and yet he did\r\nnot think then of the woman to whom he had once confided those\r\nambitions--the woman who was the girl's mother. Perhaps Jethro was\r\nthinking of her.\r\n\r\nIt may have been--I know not--that Isaac Worthington wondered at this\r\nrevelation of the character of Jethro Bass, for it was a revelation. For\r\nthis girl's sake Jethro was willing to forego his revenge, was willing\r\nat the end of his days to allow the world to believe that he had sold\r\nout to his enemy, or that he had been defeated by him.\r\n\r\nBut when he thought of the marriage, Isaac Worthington ground his teeth.\r\nA certain sentiment which we may call pride was so strong in him that he\r\nfelt ready to make almost any sacrifice to prevent it. To hinder it\r\nhe had quarrelled with his son, and driven him away, and threatened\r\ndisinheritance. The price was indeed heavy--the heaviest he could pay.\r\nBut the alternative--was not that heavier? To relinquish his dream of\r\npower, to sink for a while into a crippled state; for he had spent large\r\nsums, and one of those periodical depressions had come in the business\r\nof the mills, and those Western investments were not looking so bright\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nSo, with his hands opening and closing in front of him, Isaac\r\nWorthington fought out his battle. A terrible war, that, between\r\nambition and pride--a war to the knife. The issue may yet have been\r\nundecided when he turned round to Jethro with a sneer which he could not\r\nresist.\r\n\r\n“Why doesn't she marry him without my consent?”\r\n\r\nIn a moment Mr. Worthington knew he had gone too far. A certain kind of\r\nan eye is an incomparable weapon, and armed men have been cowed by those\r\nwho possess it, though otherwise defenceless. Jethro Bass had that kind\r\nof an eye.\r\n\r\n“G-guess you wouldn't understand if I was to tell you,” he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington walked to the window again, perhaps to compose himself,\r\nand then came back again.\r\n\r\n“Your proposition is,” he said at length, “that if I give my consent\r\nto this marriage, we are to have Bixby and the governor, and the\r\nConsolidation Bill will become a law. Is that it?”\r\n\r\n“Th-that's it,” said Jethro, taking his accustomed seat.\r\n\r\n“And this consent is to be given when the bill becomes a law?”\r\n\r\n“Given now. T-to-night.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington took another turn as far as the door, and suddenly came\r\nand stood before Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Well, I consent.”\r\n\r\nJethro nodded toward the table.\r\n\r\n“Er--pen and paper there,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What do you want me to do?” demanded Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n“W-write to Bob--write to Cynthy. Nice letters.”\r\n\r\n“This is carrying matters with too high a hand, Mr. Bass. I will write\r\nthe letters to-morrow morning.” It was intolerable that he, the first\r\ncitizen of Brampton, should have to submit to such humiliation.\r\n\r\n“Write 'em now. W-want to see 'em.”\r\n\r\n“But if I give you my word they will be written and sent to you\r\nto-morrow afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“T-too late,” said Jethro; “sit down and write 'em now.”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington went irresolutely to the table, stood for a minute,\r\nand dropped suddenly into the chair there. He would have given anything\r\n(except the realization of his ambitions) to have marched out of the\r\nroom and to have slammed the door behind him. The letter paper and\r\nenvelopes which Jethro had bought stood in a little pile, and Mr.\r\nWorthington picked up the pen. The clock struck two as he wrote the\r\ndate, as though to remind him that he had written it wrong. If Flint\r\ncould see him now! Would Flint guess? Would anybody guess? He stared at\r\nthe white paper, and his rage came on again like a gust of wind, and he\r\nfelt that he would rather beg in the streets than write such a thing.\r\nAnd yet--and yet he sat there. Surely Jethro Bass must have known that\r\nhe could have taken no more exquisite vengeance than this, to compel a\r\nman--and such a man--to sit down in the white heat of passion--and write\r\ntwo letters of forgiveness! Jethro sat by the window, to all appearances\r\noblivious to the tortures of his victim.\r\n\r\nHe who has tried to write a note--the simplest note when his mind was\r\nharassed, will understand something of Isaac Worthington's sensations.\r\nHe would no sooner get an inkling of what his opening sentence was to be\r\nthan the flames of his anger would rise and sweep it away. He could\r\nnot even decide which letter he was to write first: to his son, who had\r\ndefied him and who (the father knew in his heart) condemned him? or\r\nto the schoolteacher, who was responsible for all his misery; who--Mr.\r\nWorthington believed--had taken advantage of his son's youth by feminine\r\nwiles of no mean order so as to gain possession of him. I can almost\r\nbring myself to pity the first citizen of Brampton as he sits there\r\nwith his pen poised over the paper, and his enemy waiting to read those\r\ntender epistles of forgiveness which he has yet to write. The clock has\r\nalmost got round to the half-hour again, and there is only the date--and\r\na wrong one at that.\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Wetherell,--Circumstances (over which I have no\r\ncontrol?)”--ought he not to call her Cynthia? He has to make the letter\r\ncredible in the eyes of the censor who sits by the window. “My dear Miss\r\nWetherell, I have come to the conclusion”--two sheets torn up, or thrust\r\ninto Mr. Worthington's pocket. By this time words have begun to have a\r\ncolorless look. “My dear Miss Wetherell,--Having become convinced of\r\nthe sincere attachment which my son Robert has for you, I am writing\r\nhim to-night to give my full consent to his marriage. He has given me\r\nto understand that you have hitherto persistently refused to accept him\r\nbecause I have withheld that consent, and I take this opportunity of\r\nexpressing my admiration of this praiseworthy resolution on your part.”\r\n (If this be irony, it is sublime! Perhaps Isaac Worthington has a little\r\nof the artist in him, and now that he is in the heat of creation has\r\nforgotten the circumstances under which he is composing.) “My son's\r\nhappiness and career in life are of such moment to me that, until the\r\npresent, I could not give my sanction to what I at first regarded as\r\na youthful fancy. Now that, my son, for your sake, has shown his\r\ndetermination and ability to make his own way in the world,” (Isaac\r\nWorthington was not a little proud of this) “I have determined that it\r\nis wise to withdraw my opposition, and to recall Robert to his proper\r\nplace, which is near me. I am sure that my feelings in this matter will\r\nbe clear to you, and that you will look with indulgence upon any acts\r\nof mine which sprang from a natural solicitation for the welfare and\r\nhappiness of my only child. I shall be in Brampton in a day or two, and\r\nI shall at once give myself the pleasure of calling on you. Sincerely\r\nyours, Isaac D. Worthington.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps a little formal and pompous for some people, but an admirable\r\nand conciliatory letter for the first citizen of Brampton. Written under\r\nsuch trying circumstances, with I know not how many erasures and false\r\nstarts, it is little short of a marvel in art: neither too much said,\r\nnor too little, for a relenting parent of Mr. Worthington's character,\r\nand I doubt whether Talleyrand or Napoleon or even Machiavelli himself\r\ncould have surpassed it. The second letter, now that Mr. Worthington had\r\ngot into the swing, was more easily written. “My dear Robert” (it said),\r\n“I have made up my mind to give my consent to your marriage to Miss\r\nWetherell, and I am ready to welcome you home, where I trust I shall\r\nsee you shortly. I have not been unimpressed by the determined manner in\r\nwhich you have gone to work for yourself, but I believe that your place\r\nis in Brampton, where I trust you will show the same energy in learning\r\nto succeed me in the business which I have founded there as you have\r\nexhibited in Mr. Broke's works. Affectionately, your Father.”\r\n\r\nA very creditable and handsome letter for a forgiving father. When Mr.\r\nWorthington had finished it, and had addressed both the envelopes, his\r\nshame and vexation had, curious to relate, very considerably abated.\r\nNot to go too deeply into the somewhat contradictory mental and cardiac\r\nprocesses of Mr. Worthington, he had somehow tricked himself by that\r\nmagic exercise of wielding his pen into thinking that he was doing a\r\nnoble and generous action: into believing that in the course of a very\r\nfew days--or weeks, at the most, he would have recalled his erring son\r\nand have given Cynthia his blessing. He would, he told himself, have\r\nbeen forced eventually to yield when that paragon of inflexibility, Bob,\r\ndictated terms to him at the head of the locomotive works. Better\r\nlet the generosity be on his (Mr. Worthington's) side. At all events,\r\nvictory had never been bought more cheaply. Humiliation, in Mr.\r\nWorthington's eyes, had an element of publicity in it, and this\r\nepisode had had none of that element; and Jethro Bass, moreover, was a\r\nhighwayman who had held a pistol to his head. In such logical manner he\r\ngradually bolstered up again his habitual poise and dignity. Next\r\nweek, at the latest, men would point to him as the head of the largest\r\nrailroad interests in the state.\r\n\r\nHe pushed back his chair, and rose, merely indicating the result of his\r\nlabors by a wave of his hand. And he stood in the window as Jethro Bass\r\ngot up and went to the table. I would that I had a pen able to describe\r\nJethro's sensations when he read them. Unfortunately, he is a man with\r\nfew facial expressions. But I believe that he was artist enough himself\r\nto appreciate the perfections of the first citizen's efforts. After\r\na much longer interval than was necessary for their perusal, Mr.\r\nWorthington turned.\r\n\r\n“G-guess they'll do,” said Jethro, as he folded them up. He was too\r\ngenerous not to indulge, for once, in a little well-deserved praise.\r\n“Hain't underdone it, and hain't overdone it a mite hev you? M-man of\r\nresource. Callate you couldn't hev beat that if you was to take a week\r\nto it.”\r\n\r\n“I think it only fair to tell you,” said Mr. Worthington, picking up his\r\nsilk hat, “that in those letters I have merely anticipated a very little\r\nmy intentions in the matter. My son having proved his earnestness, I was\r\nabout to consent to the marriage of my own accord.”\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to do it anyway--was you?”\r\n\r\n“I had so determined.”\r\n\r\n“A-always thought you was high-minded,” said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington was on the point of giving a tart reply to this, but\r\nrestrained himself.\r\n\r\n“Then I may look upon the matter as settled?” he said. “The\r\nConsolidation Bill is to become a law?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jethro, “you'll get your bill.” Mr. Worthington had got his\r\nhand on the knob of the door when Jethro stopped him with a word. He had\r\nno facial expressions, but he had an eye, as we have seen--an eye\r\nthat for the second time appeared terrible to his visitor. “Isaac\r\nWorthington,” he said, “a-act up to it. No trickery--or look out--look\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nThen, the incident being closed so far as he was concerned, Jethro went\r\nback to his chair by the window, but it is to be recorded that Isaac\r\nWorthington did not answer him immediately. Then he said:--\r\n\r\n“You seem to forget that you are talking to a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“That's so,” answered Jethro, “so you be.”\r\n\r\nHe sat where he was long after the sky had whitened and the stars had\r\nchanged from gold to silver and gone out, and the sunlight had begun to\r\nglance upon the green leaves of the park. Perhaps he was thinking of the\r\nlife he had lived, which was spent now: of the men he had ruled, of the\r\nvictories he had gained from that place which would know him no more.\r\nHe had won the last and the greatest of his victories there, compared\r\nto which the others had indeed been as vanities. Perhaps he looked back\r\nover the highway of his life and thought of the woman whom he had loved,\r\nand wondered what it had been if she had trod it by his side. Who will\r\njudge him? He had been what he had been; and as the Era was, so was he.\r\nVerily, one generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Isaac Worthington arrived at Mr. Duncan's house, where he was\r\nstaying, at three o'clock in the morning, he saw to his surprise light\r\nfrom the library windows lying in bars across the lawn under the trees.\r\nHe found Mr. Duncan in that room with Somers, his son, who had just\r\nreturned from a seaside place, and they were discussing a very grave\r\nevent. Miss Janet Duncan had that day eloped with a gentleman\r\nwho--to judge from the photograph Somers held--was both handsome and\r\nromantic-looking. He had long hair and burning eyes, and a title not to\r\nbe then verified, and he owned a castle near some place on the peninsula\r\nof Italy not on the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWe are back in Brampton, owning, as we do, an annual pass over the Truro\r\nRailroad. Cynthia has been there all the summer, and as it is now the\r\nfirst of September, her school has begun again. I do not by any means\r\nintend to imply that Brampton is not a pleasant place to spend the\r\nsummer: the number of its annual visitors is a refutation of that; but\r\nto Cynthia the season had been one of great unhappiness. Several times\r\nLem Hallowell had stopped the stage in front of Ephraim's house to beg\r\nher to go to Coniston, and Mr. Satterlee had come himself; but she could\r\nnot have borne to be there without Jethro. Nor would she go to Boston,\r\nthough urged by Miss Lucretia; and Mrs. Merrill and the girls had\r\nimplored her to join them at a seaside place on the Cape.\r\n\r\nCynthia had made a little garden behind Ephraim's house, and she spent\r\nthe summer there with her flowers and her books, many of which Lem had\r\nfetched from Coniston. Ephraim loved to sit there of an evening and\r\nsmoke his pipe and chat with Ezra Graves and the neighbors who dropped\r\nin. Among these were Mr. Gamaliel Ives, who talked literature with\r\nCynthia; and Lucy Baird, his wife, who had taken Cynthia under her\r\nwing. I wish I had time to write about Lucy Baird. And Mr. Jonathan Hill\r\ncame--his mortgage not having been foreclosed, after all. When Cynthia\r\nwas alone with Ephraim she often read to him,--generally from books of\r\na martial flavor,--and listened with an admirable hypocrisy to certain\r\nnarratives which he was in the habit of telling.\r\n\r\nThey never spoke of Jethro. Ephraim was not a casuist, and his sense of\r\nright and wrong came largely through his affections. It is safe to\r\nsay that he never made an analysis of the sorrow which he knew was\r\nafflicting the girl, but he had had a general and most sympathetic\r\nunderstanding of it ever since the time when Jethro had gone back to the\r\ncapital; and Ephraim never brought home his Guardian or his Clarion now,\r\nbut read them at the office, that their contents might not disturb her.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Cynthia was unhappy. The letters came, almost every day,\r\nwith the postmark of the town in New Jersey where Mr. Broke's locomotive\r\nworks were; and she answered them now (but oh, how scrupulously!),\r\nthough not every day. If the waters of love rose up through the grains\r\nof sand, it was, at least, not Cynthia's fault. Hers were the letters of\r\na friend. She was reading such and such a book--had he read it? And he\r\nmust not work too hard. How could her letters be otherwise when Jethro\r\nBass, her benefactor, was at the capital working to defeat and perhaps\r\nto ruin Bob's father? when Bob's father had insulted and persecuted her?\r\nShe ought not to have written at all; but the lapses of such a heroine\r\nare very rare, and very dear.\r\n\r\nYes, Cynthia's life was very bitter that summer, with but little hope\r\non the horizon of it. Her thoughts were divided between Bob and Jethro.\r\nMany a night she lay awake resolving to write to Jethro, even to go to\r\nhim, but when morning came she could not bring herself to do so. I do\r\nnot think it was because she feared that he might believe her appeal\r\nwould be made in behalf of Bob's father. Knowing Jethro as she did,\r\nshe felt that it would be useless, and she could not bear to make it in\r\nvain; if the memory of that evening in the tannery shed would not serve,\r\nnothing would serve. And again--he had gone to avenge her.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that she should hear tidings from the capital. Isaac\r\nWorthington's own town was ringing with it. And as week after week\r\nof that interminable session went by, the conviction slowly grew\r\nupon Brampton that its first citizen had been beaten by Jethro Bass.\r\nSomething of Mr. Worthington's affairs was known: the mills, for\r\ninstance, were not being run to their full capacity. And then had\r\ncome the definite news that Mr. Worthington was beaten, a local\r\nrepresentative having arrived straight from the rotunda. Cynthia\r\noverheard Lem Hallowell telling it to Ephraim, and she could not for the\r\nlife of her help rejoicing, though she despised herself for it. Isaac\r\nWorthington was humbled now, and Jethro had humbled him to avenge her.\r\nDespite her grief over his return to that life, there was something\r\nto compel her awe and admiration in the way he had risen and done this\r\nthing after men had fallen from him. Her mother had had something of\r\nthese same feelings, without knowing why.\r\n\r\nPeople who had nothing but praise for him before were saying hard things\r\nabout Isaac Worthington that night. When the baron is defeated, the\r\nserfs come out of their holes in the castle rock and fling their curses\r\nacross the moat. Cynthia slept but little, and was glad when the day\r\ncame to take her to her scholars, to ease her mind of the thoughts which\r\ntortured it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when she stopped at the post-office to speak to Ephraim on\r\nher way homeward in the afternoon, she heard men talking behind the\r\npartition, and she stood, as one stricken, listening beside the window.\r\nOther tidings had come in the shape of a telegram. The first rumor\r\nhad been false. Brampton had not yet received the details, but the\r\nConsolidation Bill had gone into the House that morning, and would be\r\na law before the week was out. A part of it was incomprehensible to\r\nCynthia, but so much she had understood. She did not wait to speak to\r\nEphraim, and she was going out again when a man rushed past her and\r\nthrough the partition door. Cynthia paused instinctively, for she\r\nrecognized him as one of the frequenters of the station and a bearer of\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n“Jethro's come home, boys,” he shouted; “come in on the four o'clock,\r\nand went right off to Coniston. Guess he's done for, this time, for\r\ncertain. Looks it. By Godfrey, he looks eighty! Callate his day's over,\r\nfrom the way the boys talked on the train.”\r\n\r\nCynthia lingered to hear no more, and went out, dazed, into the\r\nSeptember sunshine: Jethro beaten, and broken, and gone to Coniston.\r\nResolution came to her as she walked. Arriving home, she wrote a little\r\nnote and left it on the table for Ephraim; and going out again, ran by\r\nthe back lane to Mr. Sherman's livery stable behind the Brampton House,\r\nand in half an hour was driving along that familiar road to Coniston,\r\nalone; for she had often driven Jethro's horses, and knew every turn of\r\nthe way. And as she gazed at the purple mountain through the haze and\r\ndrank in the sweet scents of the year's fulness, she was strangely\r\nhappy. There was the village green in the cool evening light, and the\r\nflagstaff with its tip silvered by the departing sun. She waved to Rias\r\nand Lem and Moses at the store, but she drove on to the tannery house,\r\nand hitched the horse at the rough granite post, and went in, and\r\nthrough the house, softly, to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nJethro was standing in the doorway, and did not turn. He may have\r\nthought she was Millicent Skinner. Cynthia could see his face. It was\r\nolder, indeed, and lined and worn, but that fearful look of desolation\r\nwhich she had once surprised upon it, and which she in that instant\r\nfeared to see, was not there. Jethro's soul was at peace, though Cynthia\r\ncould not understand why it was so. She stole to him and flung her arms\r\nabout his neck, and with a cry he seized her and held her against him\r\nfor I know not how long. Had it been possible to have held her there\r\nalways, he would never have let her go. At last he looked down into her\r\ntear-wet face, into her eyes that were shining with tears.\r\n\r\n“D-done wrong, Cynthy.”\r\n\r\nCynthia did not answer that, for she remembered how she, too,\r\nhad exulted when she had believed him to have accomplished Isaac\r\nWorthington's downfall. Now that he had failed, and she was in his arms,\r\nit was not for her to judge--only to rejoice.\r\n\r\n“Didn't look for you to come back--didn't expect it.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro!” she faltered. Love for her had made him go, and she\r\nwould not say that, either.\r\n\r\n“D-don't hate me, Cynthy--don't hate me?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Love me--a little?”\r\n\r\nShe reached up her hands and brushed back his hair, tenderly, from his\r\nforehead. Such--a loving gesture was her answer.\r\n\r\n“You are going to stay here always, now,” she said, in a low voice, “you\r\nare never going away again.”\r\n\r\n“G-goin' to stay always,” he answered. Perhaps he was thinking of the\r\nhillside clearing in the forest--who knows! “You'll come-sometime,\r\nCynthy--sometime?”\r\n\r\n“I'll come every Saturday and Sunday, Uncle Jethro,” she said, smiling\r\nup at him. “Saturday is only two days away, now. I can hardly wait.”\r\n\r\n“Y-you'll come sometime?”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro, do you think I'll be away from you, except--except when I\r\nhave to?”\r\n\r\n“C-come and read to me--won't you--come and read?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I will!”\r\n\r\n“C-call to mind the first book you read to me, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“It was 'Robinson Crusoe,'” she said.\r\n\r\n“'R-Robinson Crusoe.' Often thought of that book. Know some of it by\r\nheart. R-read it again, sometime, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him a little anxiously. His eyes were on the great hill\r\nopposite, across Coniston Water.\r\n\r\n“I will, indeed, Uncle Jethro, if we can find it,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Guess I can find it,” said Jethro. “R-remember when you saw him makin'\r\na ship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia, “and I had my feet in the pool.”\r\n\r\nThe book had made a profound impression upon Jethro, partly because\r\nCynthia had first read it to him, and partly for another reason. The\r\nisolation of Crusoe; depicted by Defoe's genius, had been comparable to\r\nhis own isolation, and he had pondered upon it much of late. Yes, and\r\nupon a certain part of another book which he had read earlier in life:\r\nNapoleon had ended his days on St. Helena.\r\n\r\nThey walked out under the trees to the brook-side and stood listening\r\nto the tinkling of the cowbells in the wood lot beyond. The light faded\r\nearly on these September evenings, and the smoky mist had begun to rise\r\nfrom the water when they turned back again. The kitchen windows were\r\nalready growing yellow, and through them the faithful Millicent could be\r\nseen bustling about in her preparations for supper. But Cynthia, having\r\naccomplished her errand, would not go in. She could not have borne to\r\nhave any one drive back with her to Brampton then, and she must not be\r\nlate upon the road.\r\n\r\n“I will come Friday evening, Uncle Jethro,” she said, as she kissed him\r\nand gave one last, lingering look at his face. Had it been possible,\r\nshe would not have left him, and on her way to Brampton through the\r\ngathering darkness she mused anxiously upon that strange calmness he had\r\nshown after defeat.\r\n\r\nShe drove her horse on to the floor of Mr. Sherman's stable, that\r\ngentleman himself gallantly assisting her to alight, and walked homeward\r\nthrough the lane. Ephraim had not yet returned from the postoffice,\r\nwhich did not close until eight, and Cynthia smiled when she saw the\r\nutensils of his cooking-kit strewn on the hearth. In her absence he\r\ninvariably unpacked and used it, and of course Cynthia at once set\r\nherself to cleaning and packing it again. After that she got her own\r\nsupper--a very simple affair--and was putting the sitting room to rights\r\nwhen Ephraim came thumping in.\r\n\r\n“Well, I swan!” he exclaimed when he saw her. “I didn't look for you to\r\ncome back so soon, Cynthy. Put up the kit--hev you?” He stood in front\r\nof the fireplace staring with apparent interest at the place where the\r\nkit had been, and added in a voice which he strove to make quite casual,\r\n“How be Jethro?”\r\n\r\n“He looks older, Cousin Eph,” she answered, after a pause, “and I think\r\nhe is very tired. But he seems he seems more tranquil and contented than\r\nI hoped to find him.”\r\n\r\n“I want to know,” said Ephraim. “I am glad to hear it. Glad you went up,\r\nCynthy--you done right to go.\r\n\r\n“I'd have gone with you, if you'd only told me. I'll git a chance to go\r\nup Sunday.”\r\n\r\nThere was an air of repressed excitement about the veteran which did\r\nnot escape Cynthia. He held two letters in his hand, and, being a\r\npostmaster, he knew the handwriting on both. One had come from that\r\nplace in New Jersey, and drew no comment. But the other! That one had\r\nbeen postmarked at the capital, and as he had sat at his counter at the\r\npost-office waiting for closing time he had turned it over and over with\r\nmany ejaculations and futile guesses. Past master of dissimulation that\r\nhe was, he had made up his mind--if he should find Cynthia at home--to\r\nlay the letters indifferently on the table and walk into his bedroom.\r\nThis campaign he now proceeded to carry out.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled again when he was gone, and shook her head and picked\r\nup the letters: Bob's was uppermost and she read that first, without a\r\nthought of the other one. And she smiled as she read for Bob had had\r\na promotion. He was not yet at the head of the locomotive works, he\r\nhastened to add, for fear that Cynthia might think that Mr. Broke had\r\nresigned the presidency in his favor; and Cynthia never failed to laugh\r\nat these little facetious asides. He was now earning the princely sum of\r\nninety dollars a month--not enough to marry on, alas! On Saturday nights\r\nhe and Percy Broke scrubbed as much as possible of the grime from their\r\nhands and faces and went to spend Sunday at Elberon, the Broke place on\r\nthe Hudson; from whence Miss Sally Broke, if she happened to be at home,\r\nalways sent Cynthia her love. As Cynthia is still a heroine, I shall\r\nnot describe how she felt about Sally Broke's love. There was plenty\r\nof Bob's own in the letter. Cynthia would got have blamed him if he\r\nbad fallen in love with Miss Broke. It seemed to her little short of\r\nmiraculous that, amidst such surroundings, he could be true to her.\r\n\r\nAfter a period which was no briefer than that usually occupied by Bob's\r\nletters, Cynthia took the other one from her lap, and stared at it in\r\nmuch perplexity before she tore it open. We have seen its contents over\r\nMr. Worthington's shoulder, and our hearts will not stop beating--as\r\nCynthia's did. She read it twice before the full meaning of it came to\r\nher, and after that she could not well mistake it,--the language being\r\nso admirable in every way. She sat very still for a long while, and\r\npresently she heard Ephraim go out. But Cynthia did not move. Mr.\r\nWorthington relented and Bob recalled! The vista of happiness suddenly\r\nopened up, widened and widened until it was too bright for\r\nCynthia's vision, and she would compel her mind to dwell on another\r\nprospect,--that of the father and son reconciled. Although her\r\ntemples throbbed, she tried to analyze the letter. It implied that Mr.\r\nWorthington had allowed Bob to remain away on a sort of probation; it\r\nimplied that it had been dictated by a strong paternal love mingled with\r\na strong paternal justice. And then there was the appeal to her: “You\r\nwill look with indulgence upon any acts of mine which sprang from a\r\nnatural solicitation for the welfare and happiness of my only child.” A\r\nterrible insight is theirs to whom it is given to love as Cynthia loved.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a knock which frightened her, for her mind was\r\nrunning on swiftly from point to point: had, indeed, flown as far as\r\nConiston by now, and she was thinking of that strange look of peace on\r\nJethro's face which had troubled her. One letter she thrust into her\r\ndress, but the other she laid aside, and her knees trembled under her\r\nas she rose and went into the entry and raised the latch and opened the\r\ndoor. There was a moon, and the figure in the frock coat and the silk\r\nhat was the one which she expected to see. The silk hat came off very\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n“I hope I am not disturbing you, Miss Wetherell,” said the owner of it.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Cynthia, faintly.\r\n\r\n“May I come in?”\r\n\r\nCynthia held open the door a little wider, and Mr. Worthington walked\r\nin. He seemed very majestic and out of place in the little house which\r\nGabriel Post had built, and he carried into it some of the atmosphere\r\nof the walnut and high ceilings of his own mansion. His manner of laying\r\nhis hat, bottom up, on the table, and of unbuttoning his coat, subtly\r\nindicated the honor which he was conferring upon the place. And he eyed\r\nCynthia, standing before him in the lamplight, with a modification\r\nof the hawk-like look which was meant to be at once condescending\r\nand conciliatory. He did not imprint a kiss upon her brow, as some\r\nprospective fathers-in-law would have done. But his eyes, perhaps\r\ninvoluntarily, paid a tribute to her personal appearance which\r\nheightened her color. She might not, after all, be such a discredit to\r\nthe Worthington family.\r\n\r\n“Won't you sit down?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Cynthia,” he said; “I hope I may now be allowed to call you\r\nCynthia?”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him, but sat down herself, and he followed her\r\nexample; with his eyes still upon her.\r\n\r\n“You have doubtless received my letter,” began Mr. Worthington. “I only\r\narrived in Brampton an hour ago, but I thought it best to come to you at\r\nonce, under the circumstances.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Cynthia, “I received the letter.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad,” said Mr. Worthington. He was beginning to be a little taken\r\naback by her calmness and her apparent absence of joy. It was scarcely\r\nthe way in which a school-teacher should receive the advances of the\r\nfirst citizen, come to give a gracious consent to her marriage with his\r\nson. Had he known it, Cynthia was anything but calm. “I am glad,” he\r\nsaid, “because I took pains to explain the exact situation in that\r\nletter, and to set forth my own sentiments. I hope you understood them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understood them,” said Cynthia, in a low tone.\r\n\r\nThis was enigmatical, to say the least. But Mr. Worthington had come\r\nwith such praiseworthy intentions that he was disposed to believe\r\nthat the girl was overwhelmed by the good fortune which had suddenly\r\novertaken her. He was therefore disposed to be a little conciliatory.\r\n\r\n“My conduct may have appeared harsh to you,” he continued. “I will not\r\ndeny that I opposed the matter at first. Robert was still in college,\r\nand he has a generous, impressionable nature which he inherits from his\r\npoor mother--the kind of nature likely to commit a rash act which\r\nwould ruin his career. I have since become convinced that he\r\nhas--ahem--inherited likewise a determination of purpose and an ability\r\nto get on in the world which I confess I had underestimated. My friend,\r\nMr. Broke, has written me a letter about him, and tells me that he has\r\nalready promoted him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“You hear from him?” inquired Mr. Worthington, giving her a quick\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cynthia, her color rising a little.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Mr. Worthington, slowly, “I have been under the\r\nimpression that you have persistently refused to marry him.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“I cannot refrain from complimenting you, Cynthia, upon such rare\r\nconduct,” said he. “You will be glad to know that it has contributed\r\nmore than anything else toward my estimation of your character, and has\r\nstrengthened me in my resolution that I am now doing right. It may\r\nbe difficult for you to understand a father's feelings. The complete\r\nseparation from my only son was telling on me severely, and I could not\r\nforget that you were the cause of that separation. I knew nothing about\r\nyou, except--” He hesitated, for she had turned to him.\r\n\r\n“Except what?” she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington coughed. Mr. Flint had told him, that very morning, of\r\nher separation from Jethro, and of the reasons which people believed had\r\ncaused it. Unfortunately, we have not time to go into that conversation\r\nwith Mr. Flint, who had given a very good account of Cynthia indeed.\r\nAfter all (Mr. Worthington reflected), he had consented to the marriage,\r\nand there was no use in bringing Jethro's name into the conversation.\r\nJethro would be forgotten soon.\r\n\r\n“I will not deny to You that I had other plans for my son,” he said. “I\r\nhad hoped that he would marry a daughter of a friend of mine. You must\r\nbe a little indulgent with parents, Cynthia,” he added with a little\r\nsmile, “we have our castles in the air, too. Sometimes, as in this case,\r\nby a wise provision of providence they go astray. I suppose you have\r\nheard of Miss Duncan's marriage.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“She ran off with a worthless Italian nobleman. I believe, on the\r\nwhole,” he said, with what was an extreme complaisance for the first\r\ncitizen, “that I have reason to congratulate myself upon Robert's\r\nchoice. I have made inquiries about you, and I find that I have had the\r\npleasure of knowing your mother, whom I respected very much. And your\r\nfather, I understand, came of very good people, and was forced by\r\ncircumstances to adopt the means of livelihood he did. My attention has\r\nbeen called to the letters he wrote to the Guardian, which I hear have\r\nbeen highly praised by competent critics, and I have ordered a set of\r\nthem for the files of the library. You yourself, I find, are highly\r\nthought of in Brampton” (a, not unimportant factor, by the way); “you\r\nhave been splendidly educated, and are a lady. In short, Cynthia, I have\r\ncome to give my formal consent to your engagement to my son Robert.”\r\n\r\n“But I am not engaged to him,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“He will be here shortly, I imagine,” said Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\nCynthia was trembling more than ever by this time. She was very angry,\r\nand she had found it very difficult to repress the things which she\r\nhad been impelled to speak. She did not hate Isaac Worthington now--she\r\ndespised him. He had not dared to mention Jethro, who had been her\r\nbenefactor, though he had done his best to have her removed from the\r\nschool because of her connection with Jethro.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Worthington,” she said, “I have not yet made up my mind whether I\r\nshall marry your son.”\r\n\r\nTo say that Mr. Worthington's breath was taken away when he heard these\r\nwords would be to use a mild expression. He doubted his senses.\r\n\r\n“What?” he exclaimed, starting forward, “what do you mean?”\r\n\r\nCynthia hesitated a moment. She was not frightened, but she was trying\r\nto choose her words without passion.\r\n\r\n“I refused to marry him,” she said, “because you withheld your consent,\r\nand I did not wish to be the cause of a quarrel between you. It was not\r\ndifficult to guess your feelings toward me, even before certain things\r\noccurred of which I will not speak. I did my best, from the very first,\r\nto make Bob give up the thought of marrying me, although I loved and\r\nhonored him. Loving him as I do, I do not want to be the cause of\r\nseparating him from his father, and of depriving him of that which is\r\nrightfully his. But something was due to myself. If I should ever make\r\nup my mind to marry him,” continued Cynthia, looking at Mr. Worthington\r\nsteadfastly, “it will not be because your consent is given or withheld.”\r\n\r\n“Do you tell me this to my face?” exclaimed Mr. Worthington, now in a\r\nrage himself at such unheard-of presumption.\r\n\r\n“To your face,” said Cynthia, who got more self-controlled as he grew\r\nangry. “I believe that that consent, which you say you have given\r\nfreely, was wrung from you.”\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that the first citizen might not always have Mr.\r\nFlint by him to restrain and caution him. But Mr. Flint could have no\r\ncommand over his master's sensations, and anger and apprehension goaded\r\nMr. Worthington to indiscretion.\r\n\r\n“Jethro Bass told you this!” he cried out.\r\n\r\n“No,” Cynthia answered, not in the least surprised by the admission,\r\n“he did not tell me--but he will if I ask him. I guessed it from your\r\nletter. I heard that he had come back to-day, and I went to Coniston to\r\nsee him, and he told me--he had been defeated.”\r\n\r\nTears came into her eyes at the remembrance of the scene in the tannery\r\nhouse that afternoon, and she knew now why Jethro's face had worn that\r\nlook of peace. He had made his supreme sacrifice--for her. No, he had\r\ntold her nothing, and she might never have known. She sat thinking of\r\nthe magnitude of this thing Jethro had done, and she ceased to speak,\r\nand the tears coursed down her cheeks unheeded.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington had a habit of clutching things when he was in a rage,\r\nand now he clutched the arms of the chair. He had grown white. He was\r\nfurious with her, furious with himself for having spoken that which\r\nmight be construed into a confession. He had not finished writing\r\nthe letters before he had stood self-justified, and he had been\r\nself-justified ever since. Where now were these arguments so wonderfully\r\nplausible? Where were the refutations which he had made ready in case of\r\na barely possible need? He had gone into the Pelican House intending to\r\ntell Jethro of his determination to agree to the marriage. That was one.\r\nHe had done so--that was another--and he had written the letters that\r\nJethro might be convinced of his good will. There were still more,\r\ninvolving Jethro's character for veracity and other things. Summoning\r\nthese, he waited for Cynthia to have done speaking, but when she had\r\nfinished--he said nothing. He looked a her, and saw the tears on her\r\nface, and he saw that she had completely forgotten his presence.\r\n\r\nFor the life of him, Isaac Worthington could not utter a word. He was a\r\nman, as we know, who did not talk idly, and he knew that Cynthia would\r\nnot hear what he said; and arguments and denunciations lose their effect\r\nwhen repeated. Again, he knew that she would not believe him. Never in\r\nhis life had Isaac Worthington been so ignored, so put to shame, as by\r\nthis school-teacher of Brampton. Before, self-esteem and sophistry\r\nhad always carried him off between them; sometimes, in truth, with a\r\nwound--the wound had always healed. But he had a feeling, to-night, that\r\nthis woman had glanced into his soul, and had turned away from it. As he\r\nlooked at her the texture of his anger changed; he forgot for the first\r\ntime that which he had been pleased to think of as her position in life,\r\nand he feared her. He had matched his spirit against hers.\r\n\r\nBefore long the situation became intolerable to him, for Cynthia still\r\nsat silent. She was thinking of how she had blamed Jethro for going back\r\nto that life, even though his love for her had made him do it. But Isaac\r\nWorthington did not know of what she was thinking--he thought only of\r\nhimself and his predicament. He could not remain, and yet he could not\r\ngo--with dignity. He who had come to bestow could not depart like a\r\nwhipped dog.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a fear transfixed him: suppose that this woman, from whom he\r\ncould not hide the truth, should tell his son what he had done. Bob\r\nwould believe her. Could he, Isaac Worthington, humble his pride and ask\r\nher to keep her suspicions to herself? He would then be acknowledging\r\nthat they were more than suspicions. If he did so, he would have to\r\nappear to forgive her in spite of what she had said to him. And Bob\r\nwas coming home. Could he tell Bob that he had changed his mind and\r\nwithdrawn his consent to the marriage? There world be the reason, and\r\nagain Bob would believe her. And again, if he withdrew his consent,\r\nthere was Jethro to reckon with. Jethro must have a weapon still, Mr.\r\nWorthington thought, although he could not imagine what it might be.\r\nAs Isaac Worthington sat there, thinking, it grew clear, to him at last\r\nthat there was but one exit out of a very desperate situation.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Cynthia again, this time appraisingly. She had dried her\r\neyes, but she made no effort to speak. After all, she would make such\r\na wife for his son as few men possessed. He thought of Sarah\r\nHollingsworth. She had been a good woman, but there had been many\r\ntimes when he had deplored--especially in his travels the lack of other\r\nqualities in his wife. Cynthia, he thought, had these qualities,--so\r\nnecessary for the wife of one who would succeed to power--though whence\r\nshe had got them Isaac Worthington could not imagine. She would become\r\na personage; she was a woman of whom they had no need to be ashamed\r\nat home or abroad. Having completed these reflections, he broke the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry that you should have been misled into thinking such a thing\r\nas you have expressed, Cynthia,” he said, “but I believe that I can\r\nunderstand something of the feelings which prompted you. It is natural\r\nthat you should have a resentment against me after everything that has\r\nhappened. It is perhaps natural, too, that I should lose my temper under\r\nthe circumstances. Let us forget it. And I trust that in the future\r\nwe shall grow into the mutual respect and affection which our nearer\r\nrelationship will demand.”\r\n\r\nHe rose, and took up his hat, and Cynthia rose too. There was something\r\nvery fine, he thought, about her carriage and expression as she stood in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\n“There is my hand,” he said,--“will you take it?”\r\n\r\n“I will take it,” Cynthia answered, “because you are Bob's father.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Worthington went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nI am able to cite one notable instance, at least, to disprove the saying\r\na part of which is written above, and I have yet to hear of a case in\r\nwhich a gentleman ever hesitated a single instant on account of the\r\nfirst letter of a lady's last name. I know, indeed, of an occasion when\r\nlocomotives could not go fast enough, when thirty miles an hour seemed a\r\nsnail's pace to a young main who sat by the open window of a train that\r\ncrept northward on a certain hazy September morning up the beautiful\r\nvalley of a broad river which we know.\r\n\r\nIt was after three o'clock before he caught sight of the familiar crest\r\nof Farewell Mountain, and the train ran into Harwich. How glad he was to\r\nsee everybody there, whether he knew them or not! He came near hugging\r\nthe conductor of the Truro accommodation; who, needless to say, did\r\nnot ask him for a ticket, or even a pass. And then the young man went\r\nforward and almost shook the arms off of the engineer and the fireman,\r\nand climbed into the cab, and actually drove the engine himself as far\r\nas Brampton, where it arrived somewhat ahead of schedule, having taken\r\nsome of the curves and bridges at a speed a little beyond the law. The\r\nengineer was richer by five dollars, and the son of a railroad president\r\nis a privileged character, anyway.\r\n\r\nYes, here was Brampton, and in spite of the haze the sun had never shone\r\nso brightly on the terraced steeple of the meeting-house. He leaped\r\nout of the cab almost before the engine had stopped, and beamed upon\r\neverybody on the platform,--even upon Mr. Dodd, who chanced to be there.\r\nIn a twinkling the young man is in Mr. Sherman's hack, and Mr. Sherman\r\ngalloping his horse down Brampton Street, the young man with his head\r\nout of the window, smiling; grinning would be a better word. Here are\r\nthe iron mastiffs, and they seem to be grinning, too. The young man\r\nflings open the carriage door and leaps out, and the door is almost\r\nbroken from its hinges by the maple tree. He rushes up the steps and\r\nthrough the hall, and into the library, where the first citizen and his\r\nseneschal are sitting.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Father, you see I didn't waste any time,” he cried; grasping his\r\nfather's hand in a grip that made Mr. Worthington wince. “Well, you\r\nare a trump, after all. We're both a little hot-headed, I guess, and do\r\nthings we're sorry for,--but that's all over now, isn't it? I'm sorry.\r\nI might have known you'd come round when you found out for yourself what\r\nkind of a girl Cynthia was. Did you ever see anybody like her?”\r\n\r\nMr. Flint turned his back, and started to walk out of the room.\r\n\r\n“Don't go, Flint, old boy,” Bob called out, seizing Mr. Flint's hand,\r\ntoo. “I can't stay but a minute, now. How are you?”\r\n\r\n“All right, Bob,” answered Mr. Flint, with a curious, kindly look in his\r\neyes that was not often there. “I'm glad to see you home. I have to go\r\nto the bank.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Father,” said Bob, “school must be out, and I imagine you know\r\nwhere I'm going. I just thought I'd stop in to--to thank you, and get a\r\nbenediction.”\r\n\r\n“I am very happy to have you back, Robert,” replied Mr. Worthington,\r\nand it was true. It would have been strange indeed if some tremor of\r\nsentiment had not been in his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye\r\nas he looked upon his son.\r\n\r\n“So you saw her, and couldn't resist her,” said Bob. “Wasn't that how it\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington sat down again at the desk, and his hand began to stray\r\namong the papers. He was thinking of Mr. Flint's exit.\r\n\r\n“I do not arrive at my decisions quite in that way, Robert,” he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“But you have seen her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have seen her.”\r\n\r\nThere was a hesitation, an uneasiness in his father's tone for which Bob\r\ncould not account, and which he attributed to emotion. He did not guess\r\nthat this hour of supreme joy could hold for Isaac Worthington another\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n“Isn't she the finest girl in the world?” he demanded. “How does she\r\nseem? How does she look?”\r\n\r\n“She looks extremely well,” said Mr. Worthington, who had now schooled\r\nhis voice. “In fact, I am quite ready to admit that Cynthia Wetherell\r\npossesses the qualifications necessary for your wife. If she had not, I\r\nshould never have written you.”\r\n\r\nBob walked to the window.\r\n\r\n“Father;” he said, speaking with a little difficulty, “I can't tell you\r\nhow much I appreciate your--your coming round. I wanted to do the right\r\nthing, but I just couldn't give up such a girl as that.”\r\n\r\n“We shall let bygones be bygones, Robert,” answered Mr. Worthington,\r\nclearing his throat.\r\n\r\n“She never would have me without your consent. By the way,” he cried,\r\nturning suddenly, “did she say she'd have me now?”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Mr. Worthington, clearing his throat again, “I believe\r\nshe reserved her decision.”\r\n\r\n“I must be off,” said Bob, “she goes to Coniston on Fridays. I'll drive\r\nher out. Good-by, Father.”\r\n\r\nHe flew out of the room, ran into Mrs. Holden, whom he astonished by\r\nsaluting on the cheek, and astonished even more by asking her to tell\r\nSilas to drive his black horses to Gabriel Post's house--as the cottage\r\nwas still known in Brampton. And having hastily removed some of the\r\ncinders, he flew out of the door and reached the park-like space in the\r\nmiddle of Brampton Street. Then he tried to walk decorously, but it was\r\nhard work. What if she should not be in?\r\n\r\nThe door and windows of the little house were open that balmy afternoon,\r\nand the bees were buzzing among the flowers which Cynthia had planted on\r\neither side of the step. Bob went up the path, and caught a glimpse of\r\nher through the entry standing in the sitting room. She was, indeed,\r\nwaiting for the Coniston stage, and she did not see him. Shall I destroy\r\nthe mental image of the reader who has known her so long by trying\r\nto tell what she looked like? Some heroines grow thin and worn by the\r\ntroubles which they are forced to go through. Cynthia was not this kind\r\nof a heroine. She was neither tall nor short, and the dark blue gown\r\nwhich she wore set off (so Bob thought) the curves of her figure to\r\nperfection. Her face had become a little more grave--yes, and more\r\nnoble; and the eyes and mouth had an indescribable, womanly sweetness.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment outside the doorway gazing at her; hesitating to\r\ndesecrate that revery, which seemed to him to have a touch of sadness\r\nin it. And then she turned her head, slowly, and saw him, and her lips\r\nparted, and a startled look came into her eyes, but she did not move.\r\nHe came quickly into the room and stopped again, quivering from head\r\nto foot with the passion which the sight of her never failed to unloose\r\nwithin him. Still she did not speak, but her lip trembled, and the love\r\nleaping in his eyes kindled a yearning in hers,--a yearning she was\r\npowerless to resist. He may by that strange power have drawn her toward\r\nhim--he never knew. Neither of them could have given evidence on that\r\nmarvellous instant when the current bridged the space between them. He\r\ncould not say whether this woman whom he had seized by force before had\r\nshown alike vitality in her surrender. He only knew that her arms were\r\nwoven about his neck, and that the kiss of which he had dreamed was\r\nagain on his lips, and that he felt once more her wonderful, supple body\r\npressed against his, and her heart beating, and her breast heaving. And\r\nhe knew that the strength of the love in her which he had gained was\r\nbeyond estimation.\r\n\r\nThus for a time they swung together in ethereal space, breathless\r\nwith the motion of their flight. The duration of such moments is--in\r\nwords--limitless. Now he held her against him, and again he held her\r\naway that his eyes might feast upon hers until she dropped her lashes\r\nand the crimson tide flooded into her face and she hid it again in the\r\nrefuge she had longed for,--murmuring his name. But at last, startled by\r\nsome sound without and so brought back to earth, she led him gently to\r\nthe window at the side and looked up at him searchingly. He was tanned\r\nno longer.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid you had been working too hard,” she said.\r\n\r\n“So you do love me?” was Bob's answer to this remark.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled at him with her eyes: gravely, if such a thing may be\r\nsaid of a smile.\r\n\r\n“Bob, how can you ask?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cynthia,” he cried, “if you knew what I have been through, you\r\nwouldn't have held out, I know it. I began to think I should never have\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“But you have me now,” she said, and was silent.\r\n\r\n“Why do you look like that?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe smiled up at him again.\r\n\r\n“I, too, have suffered, Bob,” she said. “And I have thought of you night\r\nand day.”\r\n\r\n“God bless you, sweetheart,” he cried, and kissed her again,--many\r\ntimes. “It's all right now, isn't it? I knew my father would give his\r\nconsent when he found out what you were.”\r\n\r\nThe expression of pain which had troubled him crossed her face again,\r\nand she put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Listen, dearest,” she said, “I love you. I am doing this for you. You\r\nmust understand that.”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, Cynthia, I understand it--of course I do,” he answered,\r\nperplexed. “I understand it, but I don't deserve it.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to know,” she continued in a low voice, “that I should have\r\nmarried you anyway. I--I could not have helped it.”\r\n\r\n“Cynthia!”\r\n\r\n“If you were to go back to the locomotive works' tomorrow, I would marry\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“On ninety dollars a month?” exclaimed Bob.\r\n\r\n“If you wanted me,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Wanted you! I could live in a log cabin with you the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\nShe drew down his face to hers, and kissed him.\r\n\r\n“But I wished you to be reconciled with your father,” she said; “I could\r\nnot bear to come between you. You--you are reconciled, aren't you?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, we are,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am glad, Bob,” she answered simply. “I should not have been happy if\r\nI had driven you away from the place where you should be, which is your\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\n“Wherever you are will be my home; sweetheart,” he said, and pressed her\r\nto him once more.\r\n\r\nAt length, looking past his shoulder into the street, she saw Lem\r\nHallowell pulling up the Brampton stage before the door.\r\n\r\n“Bob,” she said, “I must go to Coniston and see Uncle Jethro. I promised\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nBob's answer was to walk into the entry, where he stood waving the most\r\njoyous of greetings at the surprised stage driver.\r\n\r\n“I guess you won't get anybody here, Lem,” he called out.\r\n\r\n“But, Bob,” protested Cynthia, from within, afraid to show her face just\r\nthen, “I have to go, I promised. And--and I want to go,” she added when\r\nhe turned.\r\n\r\n“I'm running a stage to Coniston to-day myself, Lem,” said he “and I'm\r\ngoing to steal your best passenger.”\r\n\r\nLemuel immediately flung down his reins and jumped out of the stage and\r\ncame up the path and into the entry, where he stood confronting Cynthia.\r\n\r\n“Hev you took him, Cynthy?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Lem,” she answered, “won't you congratulate me?”\r\n\r\nThe warm-hearted stage driver did congratulate her in a most\r\nunmistakable manner.\r\n\r\n“I think a sight of her, Bob,” he said after he had shaken both of Bob's\r\nhands and brushed his own eyes with his coat sleeve. “I've knowed her\r\nso long--” Whereupon utterance failed him, and he ran down the path and\r\njumped into his stage again and drove off.\r\n\r\nAnd then Cynthia sent Bob on an errand--not a very long one, and\r\nwhile he was gone, she sat down at the table and tried to realize her\r\nhappiness, and failed. In less than ten minutes Bob had come back with\r\nCousin Ephraim, as fast as he could hobble. He flung his arms around\r\nher, stick and all, and he was crying. It is a fact that old soldiers\r\nsometimes cry. But his tears did not choke his utterance.\r\n\r\n“Great Tecumseh!” said Cousin Ephraim, “so you've went and done it,\r\nCynthy. Siege got a little mite too hot. I callated she'd capitulate in\r\nthe end, but she held out uncommon long.”\r\n\r\n“That she did,” exclaimed Bob, feelingly.\r\n\r\n“I--I was tellin' Bob I hain't got nothin' against him,” continued\r\nEphraim.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cousin Eph,” said Cynthia, laughing in spite of herself, and\r\nglancing at Bob, “is that all you can say?”\r\n\r\n“Cousin Eph's all right,” said Bob, laughing too. “We understand each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“Callate we do,” answered Ephraim. “I'll go so far as to say there\r\nhain't nobody I'd ruther see you marry. Guess I'll hev to go back to the\r\nkit, now. What's to become of the old pensioner, Cynthy?”\r\n\r\n“The old pensioner needn't worry,” said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThen drove up Silas the Silent, with Bob's buggy and his black trotters.\r\nAll of Brampton might see them now; and all of Brampton did see them.\r\nSilas got out,--his presence not being required,--and Cynthia was helped\r\nin, and Bob got in beside her, and away they went, leaving Ephraim\r\nwaving his stick after them from the doorstep.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded against the black trotters that they made very poor time\r\nto Coniston that day, though I cannot discover that either of them\r\nwas lame. Lem Hallowell, who was there nearly an hour ahead of them,\r\ndeclares that the off horse had a bunch of branches in his mouth.\r\nPerhaps Bob held them in on account of the scenery that September\r\nafternoon. Incomparable scenery! I doubt if two lovers of the\r\nrenaissance ever wandered through a more wondrous realm of pleasance--to\r\nquote the words of the poet. Spots in it are like a park, laid out by\r\nthat peerless landscape gardener, nature: dark, symmetrical pine trees\r\non the sward, and maples in the fulness of their leaf, and great oaks on\r\nthe hillsides, and, coppices; and beyond, the mountain, the evergreens\r\nmassed like cloud-shadows on its slopes; and all-trees and coppice and\r\nmountain--flattened by the haze until they seemed woven in the softest\r\nof blues and blue greens into one exquisite picture of an ancient\r\ntapestry. I, myself, have seen these pictures in that country, and\r\nmarvelled.\r\n\r\nSo they drove on through that realm, which was to be their realm,\r\nand came all too soon to Coniston green. Lem Hallowell had spread the\r\nwell-nigh incredible news, that Cynthia Wetherell was to marry the son\r\nof the mill-owner and railroad president of Brampton, and it seemed to\r\nCynthia that every man and woman and child of the village was gathered\r\nat the store. Although she loved them, every one, she whispered\r\nsomething to Bob when she caught sight of that group on the platform,\r\nand he spoke to the trotters. Thus it happened that they flew by, and\r\nwere at the tannery house before they knew it; and Cynthia, all unaided,\r\nsprang out of the buggy and ran in, alone. She found Jethro sitting\r\noutside of the kitchen door with a volume on his knee, and she saw that\r\nthe print of it was large, and she knew that the book was “Robinson\r\nCrusoe.”\r\n\r\nCynthia knelt down on the grass beside him and caught his hands in hers.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro,” she said, “I am going to marry Bob Worthington.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cynthy,” he answered. And taking the initiative for the first time\r\nin his life, he stooped down and kissed her.\r\n\r\n“I knew--you would be happy--in my happiness,” she said, the tears\r\nbrimming in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“N-never have been so happy, Cynthy,--never have.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Jethro, I never will desert you. I shall always take care of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“R-read to me sometimes, Cynthy--r-read to me?”\r\n\r\nBut she could not answer him. She was sobbing on the pages of that book\r\nhe had given her--long ago.\r\n\r\nI like to dwell on happiness, and I am reluctant to leave these people\r\nwhom I have grown to love. Jethro Bass lived to take Cynthia's children\r\ndown by the brook and to show them the pictures, at least, in that\r\nwonderful edition of “Robinson Crusoe.” He would never depart from the\r\ntannery house, but Cynthia went to him there, many times a week. There\r\nis a spot not far from the Coniston road, and five miles distant alike\r\nfrom Brampton and Coniston, where Bob Worthington built his house, and\r\nwhere he and Cynthia dwelt many years; and they go there to this day, in\r\nthe summer-time. It stands in the midst of broad lands, and the ground\r\nin front of it slopes down to Coniston Water, artificially widened here\r\nby a stone dam into a little lake. From the balcony of the summer-house\r\nwhich overhangs the lake there is a wonderful view of Coniston Mountain,\r\nand Cynthia Worthington often sits there with her sewing or her book,\r\nlistening to the laughter of her children, and thinking, sometimes, of\r\nbygone days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERWORD\r\n\r\nThe reality of the foregoing pages has to the author, at least, become\r\nso vivid that he regrets the necessity of having to add an afterword.\r\nEvery novel is, to some extent, a compound of truth and fiction, and he\r\nhas done his best to picture conditions as they were, and to make the\r\nspirit of his book true. Certain people who were living in St. Louis\r\nduring the Civil War have been mentioned as the originals of characters\r\nin “The Crisis,” and there are houses in that city which have been\r\npointed out as fitting descriptions in that novel. An author has,\r\nfrequently, people, houses, and localities in mind when he writes; but\r\nhe changes them, sometimes very materially, in the process of literary\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable, perhaps, that many people of a certain New England\r\nstate will recognize Jethro Bass. There are different opinions extant\r\nconcerning the remarkable original of this character; ardent defenders\r\nand detractors of his are still living, but all agree that he was\r\na strange man of great power. The author disclaims any intention of\r\nwriting a biography of him. Some of the things set down in this book\r\nhe did, and others he did not do. Some of the anecdotes here related\r\nconcerning him are, in the main, true, and for this material the author\r\nacknowledges his indebtedness particularly to Colonel Thomas B. Cheney\r\nof Ashland, New Hampshire, and to other friends who have helped him.\r\nJethro Bass was typical of his Era, and it is of the Era that this book\r\nattempts to treat.\r\n\r\nConcerning the locality where Jethro Bass was born and lived, it will\r\nand will not be recognized. It would have been the extreme of bad taste\r\nto have put into these pages any portraits which might have offended\r\nfamilies or individuals, and in order that it may be known that the\r\nauthor has not done so he has written this Afterword. Nor has he\r\nparticularly chosen for the field of this novel a state of which he is\r\na citizen, and for which he has a sincere affection. The conditions\r\nhere depicted, while retaining the characteristics of the locality,\r\nhe believes to be typical of the Era over a large part of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMany of the Puritans who came to New England were impelled to emigrate\r\nfrom the old country, no doubt, by an aversion to pulling the forelock\r\nas well as by religious principles, and the spirit of these men\r\nprevailed for a certain time after the Revolution was fought. Such men\r\nlived and ruled in Coniston before the rise of Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nSelf-examination is necessary for the moral health of nations as well\r\nas men, and it is the most hopeful of signs that in the United States we\r\nare to-day going through a period of self-examination.\r\n\r\nWe shall do well to ascertain the causes which have led us gradually to\r\nstray from the political principles laid down by our forefathers for\r\nall the world to see. Some of us do not even know what those principles\r\nwere. I have met many intelligent men, in different states of the Union,\r\nwho could not even repeat the names of the senators who sat for them in\r\nCongress. Macaulay said, in 1852, “We now know, by the clearest of all\r\nproof, that universal suffrage, even united with secret voting, is no\r\nsecurity, against the establishment of arbitrary power.” To quote James\r\nRussell Lowell, writing a little later: “We have begun obscurely to\r\nrecognize that... popular government is not in itself a panacea, is no\r\nbetter than any other form except as the virtue and wisdom of the people\r\nmake it so.”\r\n\r\nAs Americans, we cannot but believe that our political creed goes down\r\nin its foundations to the solid rock of truth. One of the best reasons\r\nfor our belief lies in the fact that, since 1776, government after\r\ngovernment has imitated our example. We have, by our very existence\r\nand rise to power, made any decided retrogression from these doctrines\r\nimpossible. So many people have tried to rule themselves, and are still\r\ntrying, that one begins to believe that the time is not far distant\r\nwhen the United States, once the most radical, will become the most\r\nconservative of nations.\r\n\r\nThus the duty rests to-day, more heavily than ever, upon each American\r\ncitizen to make good to the world those principles upon which his\r\ngovernment was built. To use a figure suggested by the calamity which\r\nhas lately befallen one of the most beloved of our cities, there is a\r\ntheory that earthquakes are caused by a necessary movement on the part\r\nof the globe to regain its axis. Whether or not the theory be true, it\r\nhas its political application. In America to-day we are trying--whatever\r\nthe cost--to regain the true axis established for us by the founders of\r\nour Republic.\r\n\r\nHARLAKENDEN HOUSE, May 7, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PG EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\n    Books she had known from her earliest infancy\r\n    But I wanted to be happy as long as I could\r\n    Curiosity as a factor has never been given its proper weight\r\n    Even old people may have an ideal\r\n    Every novel is, to some extent, a compound of truth and fiction\r\n    Fond of her, although she was no more than an episode in his life\r\n    Giant pines that gave many a mast to King George's navy\r\n    Had exhausted the resources of the little school\r\n    He hain't be'n eddicated a great deal\r\n    Life had made a woman of her long ago\r\n    Not that I've anything against her personally--\r\n    Pious belief in democracy, with a firmer determination to get on top\r\n    Riddle he could not solve--one that was best left alone\r\n    Stray from the political principles laid down by our forefathers\r\n    That which is the worst cruelty of all--the cruelty of selfishness\r\n    The home is the very foundation-rock of the nation\r\n    The old soldier found dependence hard to bear\r\n    The one precious gift of life\r\n    They don't take notice of him, because he don't say much\r\n    Though his heart was breaking, his voice was steady\r\n    We know nothing of their problems or temptations",
