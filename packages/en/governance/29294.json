The main question to be determined is: Shall the\r\nrailroads be owned and operated as public or as private property? Shall\r\nthese great arteries of commerce be owned and controlled by a few\r\npersons for their own private use and gain, or shall they be made\r\nhighways to be kept under strict government control and to be open for\r\nthe use of all for a fixed, equal and reasonable compensation?\r\n\r\nIn a new and sparsely settled country which is rich in natural resources\r\nthere may be no great danger in pursuing a _laissez-faire_ policy in\r\ngovernmental affairs, but as the population of a commonwealth becomes\r\ndenser, the quickened strife for property and the growing complexity of\r\nsocial and industrial interests make an extension of the functions of\r\nthe state absolutely necessary to secure protection to property and\r\nfreedom to the individual.\r\n\r\nThe American people have shown themselves capable of solving any\r\npolitical question yet presented to them, and the author has no doubt\r\nthat with full information upon the subject they will find the proper\r\nsolution of the railroad problem. The masses have an honest purpose and\r\na keen sense of right and wrong. With them a question is not settled\r\nuntil it is settled right.\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded that of all the great inventions of modern times\r\nnone has contributed as much to the prosperity and happiness of mankind\r\nas the railroad.\r\n\r\nOur age is under lasting obligations to Watt and Stephenson and many\r\nother heroes of industry who have aided in bringing the railroad to its\r\npresent state of perfection. Their genius is the product of our\r\ncivilization, and their legacies should be shared by all the people to\r\nthe greatest extent possible. An earnest desire to aid in attaining this\r\nend has prompted this contribution to the literature on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe author is not an entire novice in railroad affairs. He has had\r\nexperience as a shipper and as a railroad promoter, owner and\r\nstockholder, and has even had thrust upon him for a short time the\r\nresponsibility of a director, president and manager of a railroad\r\ncompany. He has, moreover, had every opportunity to familiarize himself\r\nwith the various phases of the subject during his more than twenty\r\nyears' connection with active legislation.\r\n\r\nHe came to the young State of Iowa before any railroad had reached the\r\nMississippi. Engaging early in manufacturing, he suffered all the\r\ninconveniences of pioneer transportation, and his experience instilled\r\ninto him liberal opinions concerning railroads and their promoters. He\r\nextended to them from the beginning all the assistance in his power,\r\nmaking not only private donations to new roads, but advocating also\r\npublic aid upon the ground that railroads are public roads.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Iowa Senate he introduced and fathered the bill for\r\nthe act enabling townships, incorporated towns and cities to vote a five\r\nper cent. tax in aid of railroad construction. He favored always such\r\nlegislation as would most encourage the building of railroads, believing\r\nthat with an increase of competitive lines the common law and\r\ncompetition could be relied upon to correct abuses and solve the rate\r\nproblem. He has since become convinced of the falsity of this doctrine,\r\nand now realizes the truth of Stephenson's saying that where\r\ncombination is possible competition is impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is the object of this work to show that as long as the railroads are\r\npermitted to be managed as private property and are used by their\r\nmanagers for speculative purposes or other personal gain, or as long\r\neven as they are used with regard only for the interest of stockholders,\r\nthey are not performing their proper functions; and that they will not\r\nserve their real purpose until they become in fact what they are in\r\ntheory, highways to be controlled by the government as thoroughly and\r\neffectually as the common road, the turnpike and the ferry, or the\r\npost-office and the custom-house.\r\n\r\nThis book has been written at such odd hours as the author could snatch\r\nfrom his time, which is largely occupied with other business. He is\r\nunder obligations to many of our ministers and consuls abroad for\r\nstatistics and other valuable information concerning foreign railroads,\r\nas well as to a number of personal friends for other assistance,\r\nconsisting chiefly in rendering the railroad literature of Europe\r\naccessible to him.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM LARRABEE.\r\n  _Clermont, Iowa, May, 1893._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I.

The free circulation of commercial commodities is as\r\nessential to the welfare of a people as is the unimpaired circulation of\r\nthe blood to the human organism.\r\n\r\nThe interest taken by man in the improvement of the roads over which he\r\nmust travel is one of the chief indications of civilization, and it\r\nmight even be said that the condition of the roads of a country shows\r\nthe degree of enlightenment which its people have reached. The trackless\r\nthough very fertile regions of Central Africa have for thousands of\r\nyears remained the seat of savages; but no nation that established a\r\nsystem of public thoroughfares through its dominion ever failed to make\r\na distinguished figure in the theater of the world. There are some\r\nauthors who go even so far as to call the high roads of commerce the\r\npioneers of enlightenment and political eminence. It is true that as\r\nroads and canals developed the commerce of Eastern Asia and Europe, the\r\nattention of their people was turned to those objects which distinguish\r\ncultured nations and lead to political consequence among the powers of\r\nthe world. The systems of roads and canals which we find among those\r\nancients who achieved an advanced state of civilization might well put\r\nto shame the roads which disgraced not a few of the European states as\r\nlate as the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAmong the early nations of Asia of whose internal affairs we have any\r\nhistoric knowledge are the Hindoos, the Assyrians and Babylonians, the\r\nPhoenicians, the Persians and the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of India was proverbial long before the Christian era. She\r\nsupplied Nineveh and Babylon, and later Greece and Rome, with steel,\r\nzinc, pearls, precious stones, cotton, silk, sugar-cane, ivory, indigo,\r\npepper, cinnamon, incense and other commodities. If we accept the\r\ntestimony of the Vedas, the religious books of the ancient Hindoos, a\r\nhigh degree of culture must have prevailed on the shores of the Ganges\r\nmore than three thousand years ago. Highways were constructed by the\r\nstate and connected the interior of the realm with the sea and the\r\ncountries to the northeast and northwest. For this purpose forests were\r\ncleared, hills leveled, bridges built and tunnels dug. But the broad\r\nstatesmanship of the Hindoo did not pause here. To administer to the\r\nconvenience and comfort of the wayfaring public, and thus still more\r\nencourage travel and the exchange of commodities, the state proceeded to\r\nline these public roads with shade trees, to set out mile-stones, and to\r\nestablish stations provided with shady seats of repose, and wells at\r\nwhich humane priests watered the thirsty beasts.\r\n\r\nAt intervals along these routes were also found commodious and\r\ncleanly-kept inns to give shelter to the traveler at night. Buddha, the\r\ngreat religious reformer of the Hindoos, commended the roads and\r\nmountain passes of the country to the care of the pious, and the Greek\r\ngeographers speak with high praise of the excellence of the public\r\nhighways of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nAmong the Babylonians and Assyrians agriculture, trade and commerce\r\nflourished at an almost equally remote period. The ancient inhabitants\r\nof Mesopotamia cultivated the soil with the aid of dikes and canals, and\r\nwere experts in the manufacture of delicate fabrics, as linen, muslin\r\nand silk. To them is attributed the invention, or at least the\r\nperfection, of the cart, and the first use of domestic animals as beasts\r\nof burden. Their cities had well-built and commodious streets, and the\r\nroads which connected them with their dependencies aided to make them\r\nthe busy marts of Southeastern Asia.\r\n\r\nDuring the later Babylonian Empire immense lakes were dug for retaining\r\nthe water of the Euphrates, whence a net-work of canals distributed it\r\nover the plains to irrigate the land; and quays and breakwaters were\r\nconstructed along the Persian Gulf for the encouragement of commerce.\r\nWhile highways among the Babylonians served the development of\r\nagriculture and the exchange of industrial commodities, they were\r\nconstructed chiefly for strategic purposes by the more warlike\r\nAssyrians, whose many wars made a system of good roads a necessity. The\r\nGreek geographer Pausanias was shown a well-kept military road upon\r\nwhich Memnon was said to have marched with an Assyrian army from Susa to\r\nTroy to rescue King Priam. Traces of this road, called by the natives\r\n\"Itaki Atabeck,\" may be seen to this day.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenicians, who were the first of the great historic maritime\r\nnations of antiquity, occupied the narrow strip of territory between the\r\nmountains of Northern Palestine and the Mediterranean Sea. From their\r\nsituation they learned to rely upon the sea as their principal highway.\r\nThey transported to the islands of the Mediterranean as well as the\r\ncoast of Northern Africa and Southern Europe heavy cargoes consisting of\r\nthe product of their own skill and industry as well as of the manifold\r\nexports of the east. They sailed even beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules\"\r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. Through their hands \"passed\r\nthe gold and pearls of the east and the purple of Tyre, slaves, ivory,\r\nlion and panther skins from the interior of Africa, frankincense from\r\nArabia, the linen of Egypt, the pottery and fine wares of Greece, the\r\ncopper of Cyprus, the silver of Spain, tin from England, and iron from\r\nElba.\"\r\n\r\nBut while the Phoenicians for their commercial intercourse with other\r\nnations relied chiefly upon the sea, the great highway of nature, they\r\nneglected by no means road-building at home. They connected their great\r\ncities, Sidon and Tyre, by a coast road, which they extended in time as\r\nfar as the Isthmus of Suez. They also established great commercial\r\nroutes by which their merchants penetrated the interior of Europe and\r\nAsia. Caravan roads extended south to Arabia and east to Mesopotamia and\r\nArmenia, penetrating the whole Orient as far as India, and even the\r\nfrontiers of China. The Phoenicians thus became the traders of\r\nantiquity, Tyre being the link between the east and the west.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Empire, which under Darius stretched from east to west for a\r\ndistance of 3,000 miles and comprised no less than two million square\r\nmiles, with a population of seventy or eighty millions, had, with the\r\nexception of the Romans, perhaps the best system of roads known to\r\nancient history. Indeed, it is doubtful whether without it such a vast\r\nempire, more than half as large as modern Europe, could have been held\r\ntogether. Each satrap, or prefect of a province, was obliged to make\r\nregular reports to the king, who was also kept informed by spies of what\r\nwas taking place in every part of the empire. To aid the administration\r\nof the government, postal communication for the exclusive use of the\r\nking and his trusted servants connected the capital with the distant\r\nprovinces. This postal service was, four or five centuries later,\r\npatterned after by the Romans. From Susa to Sardes led a royal road\r\nalong which were erected caravansaries at certain intervals. Over this\r\nroad, 1,700 miles long, the couriers of the king rode in six or seven\r\ndays. Under Darius the roads of the empire were surveyed and distances\r\nmarked by means of mile-stones, many of which are still found on the\r\nroad which led from Ecbatana to Babylon. These roads crossed the wildest\r\nregions of that great monarchy. They connected the cities of Ionia with\r\nSardes in Lydia, with Babylon and with the royal city of Susa; they led\r\nfrom Syria into Mesopotamia, from Ecbatana to Persepolis, from Armenia\r\ninto Southern Persia, and thence to Bactria and India.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese commenced road-building long before the Christian era. They\r\ngraded the roadway and then covered the whole with hewn blocks of stone,\r\ncarefully jointed and cemented together so that the entire surface\r\npresented a perfectly smooth plane. Such roads, although very costly to\r\nbuild, are almost indestructible by time. In China, as well as in\r\nseveral other countries of Asia, the executive power has always charged\r\nitself with both the construction and maintenance of roads and navigable\r\ncanals. In the instructions which are given to the governors of the\r\nvarious provinces these objects, it is said, are constantly commanded to\r\nthem, and the judgment which the court forms of the conduct of each is\r\nvery much regulated by the attention which he appears to have paid to\r\nthis part of his instructions. This solicitude of the sovereign for the\r\ninternal thoroughfares is easily accounted for when it is considered\r\nthat his revenue arises almost entirely from a land-tax, or rent, which\r\nrises and falls with the increase and decrease of the annual produce of\r\nthe land. The greatest interest of the sovereign, his revenue, is\r\ntherefore directly connected with the cultivation of the land, with the\r\nextent of its produce and its value. But in order to render that produce\r\nas great and as valuable as possible, it is necessary to procure for it\r\nas extensive a market as possible, and, consequently, to establish the\r\nfreest, the easiest and the least expensive communication between all\r\nthe different parts of the country, which can be done only by means of\r\nthe best roads and the best navigable canals.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the Egyptians and Carthaginians are the only nations of\r\nantiquity of which we have much historic knowledge. The former kept up a\r\nvery active commerce not only with the south, but also with the tribes\r\nof Lydia on the west and with Palestine and the adjoining countries on\r\nthe east. To facilitate commerce, they constructed and maintained a\r\nnumber of excellent highways leading in all directions. One of the most\r\nimportant among these was the old royal road on the coast of the\r\nMediterranean Sea, or the \"Road of the Philistines\" of the Scriptures.\r\nThis road crossed the Isthmus of Suez and led through the land of the\r\nPhilistines and Samaria to Tyre and Sidon. Another road led, in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction, from Rameses to Pelusium. This, however,\r\ncrossed marshes, lagoons and a whole system of canals, and was used only\r\nby travelers without baggage, while the Pharaohs, accompanied by their\r\nhorses, chariots and troops, preferred the former road. A third road\r\nled from Coptos, on the Nile, to Berenice, on the Red Sea. There were\r\nbetween these two cities ten stations, about twenty-five miles apart\r\nfrom each other, where travelers might rest with their camels each day,\r\nafter traveling all night, to avoid the heat. Still another road led\r\nfrom the town of Babylon, opposite Memphis, along the east bank of the\r\nNile, into Nubia. Much of the commerce of Egypt in ancient times, as in\r\nour day, was conducted on the Nile and its canals. The boatman and the\r\nhusbandman were, in fact, the founders of the gentle manners of the\r\npeople who flourished four thousand years ago in the blessed valley of\r\nthe Nile. There is one canal among the many which deserves special\r\nmention. It flowed from the Bitter Lakes into the Red Sea near the city\r\nof Arsinoe. It was first cut by Sesostris before the Trojan times, or,\r\naccording to other writers, by the son of Psammitichus, who only began\r\nthe work and then died. Darius I. set about to complete it, but gave up\r\nthe undertaking when it was nearly finished, influenced by the erroneous\r\nopinion that the level of the Red Sea was higher than Egypt, and that if\r\nthe whole of the intervening isthmus were cut through, the country would\r\nbe overflowed by the sea. The Ptolemaic kings, however, did cut it\r\nthrough and placed locks upon the canal.\r\n\r\nCarthage was a Phoenician colony. The city was remarkable for its\r\nsituation. It was surrounded by a very fertile territory and had a\r\nharbor deep enough for the anchorage of the largest vessels. Two long\r\npiers reached out into the sea, forming a double harbor, the outer for\r\nmerchant ships and the inner for the navy. This city early became the\r\nhead of a North African empire, and her fleets plied in all navigable\r\nwaters known to antiquity. Her navy was the largest in the world, and\r\nin the sea-fight with Regulus comprised three hundred and fifty vessels,\r\ncarrying one hundred and fifty thousand men. Though we have but meager\r\naccounts of the internal affairs of Carthage, there can be no doubt that\r\nmuch attention was given, both at home and in the colonies, to the\r\nconstruction of highways, which were distinguished for their solidity.\r\nIt is said that the Romans learned from the Carthaginians the art of\r\npaving roads.\r\n\r\nEuropean history began in Greece, the civilization of whose people\r\npassed to the Romans and from them to the other Aryan nations which have\r\nplayed an important role in the great historical drama of modern times.\r\nThe physical features of the Balkan Peninsula were an important factor\r\nin the formation of the character of its inhabitants. The coast has a\r\nlarge number of well-protected bays, most of which form good harbors.\r\nNavigation and commerce were greatly stimulated in a country thus\r\nfavored by Nature. Nearly all the principal cities of Hellas could be\r\nreached by ships, and the need of internal thoroughfares was but little\r\nfelt. Nevertheless, public highways connected all of the larger towns\r\nwith the national sanctuaries and oracles, as Olympia, the Isthmus,\r\nDelphi and Dodona. Athens, after the Persian wars the metropolis of\r\nGreece, was by the so-called Long Walls connected with the Piræus, its\r\nharbor. This highway, protected by high walls built two hundred yards\r\napart, was over four miles long, and enabled the Athenians, as long as\r\nthey held the command of the sea, to bring supplies to their city, even\r\nwhen it was surrounded by an enemy on the land.\r\n\r\nRome is the connecting link between antiquity and mediævalism. The great\r\nempire sprang from a single city, whose power and dominion grew until\r\nit comprised every civilized nation living upon the three continents\r\nthen known. Under the emperors, the Roman empire extended from the\r\nAtlantic to the Euphrates, a distance of more than three thousand miles,\r\nand from the Danube and the English Channel to the cataracts of the Nile\r\nand the Desert of Sahara. Its population was from eighty to one hundred\r\nand twenty millions. The empire was covered with a net-work of excellent\r\nroads, which stimulated, together with the safety and peace which\r\nfollowed the civil wars, traffic and intercourse between the different\r\nregions united under the imperial government. More than 50,000 miles of\r\nsolidly constructed highways connected the various provinces of this\r\nvast realm. There was one great chain of communication of 4,080 Roman\r\nmiles in length from the Wall of Antoninus in the northwest to Rome, and\r\nthence to Jerusalem, a southeastern point of the empire. There were\r\nseveral thousand miles of road in Italy alone. Rome's highways were\r\nconstructed for the purpose of facilitating military movements, but the\r\nbenefits which commerce derived from them cannot easily be\r\noverestimated. These military roads were usually laid out in straight\r\nlines from one station to another. Natural obstacles were frequently\r\npassed by means of very extensive works, as excavations, bridges, and,\r\nin some instances, long tunnels. The resources of the Roman Empire were\r\nalmost inexhaustible, and no public expenditures were larger than those\r\nmade on account of the construction of new roads. The fact that many of\r\nthese roads have borne the traffic of almost two thousand years without\r\nmaterial injury is abundant proof of the unsurpassed solidity of their\r\nconstruction. The Roman engineers always secured a firm bottom, which\r\nwas done, when necessary, by ramming the ground with small stones, or\r\nfragments of brick. Upon this foundation was placed a pavement of large\r\nstones, which were firmly set in cement. These stones were sometimes\r\nsquare, but more frequently irregular. They were, however, always\r\naccurately fitted to each other. Many varieties of stone were used, but\r\nthe preference was given to basalt. Where large blocks could not be\r\nconveniently obtained, small stones of hard quality were sometimes\r\ncemented together with lime, forming a kind of concrete, of which masses\r\nextending to a depth of several feet are still in existence. The\r\nstrength of the pavements is illustrated by the fact that the substrata\r\nof some have been so completely washed away by water, without disturbing\r\nthe surface, that a man may creep under the road from side to side while\r\ncarriages pass over the pavement as over a bridge. The roads were\r\ngenerally raised above the ordinary surface of the ground. They\r\nfrequently had two wagon-tracks, which were separated by a raised\r\nfoot-path in the center, and blocks of stone at intervals, to enable\r\ntravelers to mount on horseback. Furthermore, each mile was marked by a\r\nnumbered post, the distance being counted from the gate of the wall of\r\nServius. The mile-post was at first a roughly hewn stone, which in time\r\nwas exchanged for a monument, especially in the vicinity of Rome and\r\nother large cities. The most celebrated road of Italy, which has always\r\nexcited the admiration of the student of antiquity, was the Via Appia,\r\nthe remains of which are still an object of wonder. It was first built\r\nfrom Rome to Capua by Appius Claudius Cæcus in the fourth century before\r\nChrist, and was afterwards continued as far as Brundisium. It was broad\r\nenough for two carriages to pass each other, and was built of solid\r\nstone. The stones were hewn sharp and smooth, and their corners fitted\r\ninto one another without the aid of any connecting material, so that,\r\naccording to Procopius, the whole appeared to be one natural stone. Each\r\nside of the street had a high border for foot-passengers, on which were\r\nalso placed alternately seats and mile-stones. In spite of its age and\r\nheavy traffic parts of this road are still in a good state of\r\npreservation. After the completion of the Via Appia similar roads were\r\nconstructed, so that under the emperors seven great highways started\r\nfrom Rome, viz.: the Via Appia and Latina to the south; two, Valeria and\r\nSalaria, to the Adriatic; two, Cassia and Aurelia, to the northwest; and\r\nthe Via Æmilia, serving for both banks of the Po.\r\n\r\nNor were the provinces by any means neglected. During the last Punic war\r\na paved road was constructed from Spain through Gaul to the Alps, and\r\nsimilar roads were afterwards built in every part of Spain and Gaul,\r\nthrough Illyricum, Macedonia and Thrace, to Constantinople, and along\r\nthe Danube to its mouths on the Black Sea. So, likewise, were the\r\nislands of Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and Great Britain crossed by them.\r\nIt has justly been said that the roads of the Roman Empire, whose strong\r\nnet-work enlaced the known world, were the architectural glory of its\r\npeople. These military roads caused in the various parts of the empire a\r\nwonderful social and commercial revolution. They made it possible for\r\ncivilization to penetrate into the most remote retreats and to conquer\r\ntheir inhabitants more completely than could Cæsar at the head of his\r\nlegions.\r\n\r\nThe Romans also had an efficient postal service, which was first\r\ninstituted by Augustus and greatly improved by Hadrian. The former, as\r\nGibbon states in his \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" placed\r\nupon all roads leading away from the golden milestone of the Forum, at\r\nshort distances, relays of young men to serve as couriers, and later\r\nprovided vehicles to hurry information from the provinces. These posts\r\nfacilitated communication through all parts of the empire, and while\r\nthey were originally established in the interest of the government, they\r\nproved serviceable to individuals as well, for there is no doubt, that,\r\ntogether with the official dispatches, every courier carried private\r\nletters also.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the post were largely defrayed by the cities through\r\nwhich it passed, these cities being obliged to provide the stations\r\nestablished within their territories with the necessary stores. At the\r\nprincipal stations were found inns, where the proprietors were held\r\nresponsible for injuries suffered by travelers while in their houses.\r\n\r\nThe communication of the Roman Empire was scarcely less free and open by\r\nsea than it was by land. Italy has by nature few safe harbors, but the\r\nenergy and industry of the Romans corrected the deficiencies of nature\r\nby the construction of several artificial ports.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of the Roman Empire its roads were either destroyed\r\nby the people through whose territories they led or by the conquerors,\r\nto render more difficult the approach of an enemy.\r\n\r\nCivilization and commerce greatly suffered through the downfall of Rome,\r\nand did not again revive until after the struggles of the Northern\r\nChristian races with the Southern and Eastern nations, which had become\r\nMohammedan. The sixth and seventh centuries were the darkest in the\r\nhistory of Europe. Charlemagne, toward the close of the eighth century,\r\ncaused many of the old Roman roads to be repaired and new ones to be\r\nconstructed. He, as well as several of his immediate successors, made\r\nuse of mounted messengers to send imperial mandates from one part of the\r\nrealm to the other. The rulers of the succeeding centuries did not\r\nprofit, however, by this example, and the roads of the empire again fell\r\ninto decay. Moreover, the public safety was greatly impaired by robbers\r\nand feudal knights, whose depredations were so heavy a tax upon commerce\r\nas to greatly discourage it. Trade under these circumstances would have\r\nbeen entirely destroyed, had it not been for the merchants' unions which\r\nwere formed by the larger cities for the protection of their interests.\r\nThese organizations maintained the most important thoroughfares, and\r\neven furnished armed escorts to wayfaring merchants. Commerce thus\r\nflourished in, and commercial relations were kept up among, the cities\r\nimmediate between Venice and Genoa, as well as the cities on the Rhine\r\nand Danube. Florence, Verona, Milan, Strasbourg, Mayence, Augsburg, Ulm,\r\nRatisbon, Vienna and Nuremberg were flourishing marts, and through them\r\nflowed the currents of trade between the north and the south. Out of\r\nthese commercial unions grew in time the Hanseatic League, which from\r\nthe thirteenth to the fifteenth century controlled the commerce of the\r\nnorthern part of Europe on both the water and the land. The object of\r\nthis league, which at the height of its power included eighty-five\r\ncities, was to protect its members against the feudal lords on the land\r\nand against pirates on the sea. Its power extended from Norway to\r\nBelgium and from England to Russia. In all the principal towns on the\r\nhighways of commerce the flag of the Hansa floated over its counting\r\nhouses. Wherever its influence reached, its members controlled roads,\r\nmines, agriculture and manufactures. It often dictated terms to kings,\r\nand almost succeeded in monopolizing the trade of Europe north of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the social and political condition of this time\r\nthat the postal service was not carried on by the state, but was in the\r\nhands of the various municipalities, convents and universities. During\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries national power and national life\r\nmade themselves felt, and with a change in the political system the\r\nsystem of communication and transportation changed also. Louis XI. of\r\nFrance took the first step toward making a nation of the French when he\r\ntransferred the postal service from the cities and other feudal\r\nauthorities to the state. Two or three centuries later, France obtained\r\na national system of roads and canals. The idea was largely due to\r\nColbert, the minister of Louis XIV. It was, however, not executed in\r\ndetail until the middle of the last century. Many abuses grew up in\r\nconnection with it, but on the whole it was probably the soundest and\r\nmost efficient part of the French administration. A system of lines of\r\ncommunication, radiating from Paris, was constructed by skilled\r\nengineers, and placed under the supervision of men of talent, especially\r\ntrained for the purpose at the Ecôle des Fonts et Chaussées. The whole\r\nsystem was further improved by Napoleon, and has served as a basis for\r\nthe present system of railroad supervision.\r\n\r\nThe first artificial waterway constructed in France was the Languedoc\r\nCanal, connecting the Bay of Biscay with the Mediterranean. This\r\ngigantic work, designed by Riquet, was commenced in 1666, and completed\r\nin 1681. The canal is 148 miles long and its summit level is 600 feet\r\nabove the sea, the works along its line embracing over one hundred locks\r\nand fifty aqueducts. A large number of canals have since been\r\nconstructed, and France has at present over 4,000 miles of artificial\r\nwaterways, or more than any other country of Europe.\r\n\r\nNowhere else was the same completeness of organization possible. The\r\nregular mail service of Germany dates back to the year of 1516, when\r\nEmperor Maximilian established a postal route between Brussels and\r\nVienna and made Francis Count of Taxis Imperial Postmaster-General. The\r\npostal service of the empire greatly improved up to the time of the\r\nThirty Years' War, which completely demoralized it. After the war the\r\nindividual states and free cities, usurping imperial prerogatives,\r\nestablished postal routes of their own and thereby crippled the national\r\nservice. The same war also did great damage to the public thoroughfares,\r\nand the commercial and manufacturing interests of the German empire were\r\nuntil the end of the eighteenth century in a deplorable condition.\r\nFrederick the Great, recognizing the fact that the industrial paralysis\r\nof Germany was owing chiefly to its defective means of communication,\r\ncommenced to construct turnpikes and canals in Prussia, and the minor\r\nGerman princes one by one imitated his example, until the Napoleonic\r\nwars again put an end to internal improvements. The good work was\r\nresumed, however, after the downfall of Napoleon, and in 1830 Germany\r\nwas intercrossed by from three to four thousand miles of turnpike.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands canals were constructed as early as the twelfth\r\ncentury. Being particularly well adapted to the flat country of Holland,\r\nthey were rapidly extended until they connected all the cities, towns\r\nand villages of the country, and to a large extent took the place of\r\nroads. The largest canal of Holland is the one which connects the city\r\nof Amsterdam with the North Sea. It was constructed between the years\r\nof 1819 and 1825 at an expense of more than four million dollars. The\r\ncity of Amsterdam owes to this canal its present commercial prosperity.\r\n\r\nPublic roads and the state postal service are of comparatively recent\r\norigin in Great Britain. The first public postal route was established\r\nin 1635, during the reign of Charles I. In 1678 a public stage-coach\r\nroute was established between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The distance is\r\nonly forty-four miles, but the roads were so bad that, though the coach\r\nwas drawn by six able horses, the journey took three days. It was\r\nconsidered a great improvement when in 1750 it could be completed in\r\nhalf the time originally required. In 1763 a mail-coach made only\r\nmonthly trips between London and Edinburgh, eight long days being\r\nrequired for the journey, which to-day is made in less than twelve\r\nhours. The number of stage passengers between these two capitals\r\naveraged about twenty-five a month, and rose to fifty on extraordinary\r\noccasions. In those days coaches were very heavy and without springs,\r\nand travelers not unfrequently cut short their journeys for want of\r\nconveniences.\r\n\r\nTurnpikes in Great Britain do not even date as far back as\r\nstage-coaches. It is true the first turnpike act was passed as early as\r\n1653, but the system was not extensively adopted until a century later.\r\nPrevious to that time the roads of England, such as they were, were\r\nmaintained by parish and statute labor. In the latter half of the last\r\ncentury, under improved methods of construction, turnpike roads\r\nmultiplied rapidly. Both roads and vehicles attained, previous to the\r\nadvent of the railroads, such a degree of perfection that the\r\nstage-coach made the journey between London and Manchester, 178 miles,\r\nin 19 hours; between London and Liverpool, 203 miles, in less than 21\r\nhours; and between London and Holyhead, 261 miles, in less than 27\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these improved facilities, the transportation of merchandise\r\ncontinued to be very expensive. Goods had to be conveyed from town to\r\ntown by heavy wagons, and the cost of land-carriage between Manchester\r\nand Liverpool, a distance of thirty miles, was at times as high as forty\r\nshillings per ton.\r\n\r\nThe various disadvantages of land transportation directed, toward the\r\nmiddle of the last century, the attention of the British people to the\r\nimportance of a system of canals. They realized that these water\r\nhighways would open an easier and cheaper communication between distant\r\nparts of the country, thus enabling manufacturers to collect their\r\nmaterials and fuel from remote districts with less labor and expense,\r\nand to convey their goods to a more distant and more profitable market.\r\nIt would also facilitate the conveyance of farm produce to a greater\r\ndistance and would thereby benefit both the producer and consumer. The\r\ncanal era was formally inaugurated in 1761, when the Duke of Bridgewater\r\npresented to Parliament a petition for a bill to construct the canal\r\nwhich has since borne his name. The canal was commenced in 1767 and was\r\ncompleted in 1772. The next forty years were a period of great activity\r\nin canal building, but it was left to private enterprise, with very\r\nlittle aid from the government. Over a hundred canal acts were passed by\r\nParliament before the year 1800. The largest canal of the British Isles\r\nis the Caledonian, extending from Inverness to Fort William, a distance\r\nof sixty-three miles. It was commenced in 1803 and completed in 1847,\r\nand cost £1,256,000. Other canals of importance are the Great Canal,\r\nwhich connects the North Sea with the Atlantic Ocean, and the Grand\r\nFunction Canal, which is over one hundred miles long and connects most\r\nof the water-ways of central England with the Thames River. It is\r\nestimated that there were over 2,200 miles of navigable canals in Great\r\nBritain before the introduction of railroads.\r\n\r\nCanal-building in Spain dates back to the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when Charles V. built the Imperial Canal of Aragon, which is\r\nover sixty miles long. The political and commercial decline of the\r\ncountry during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however,\r\nbrought the development of her highways to a standstill, and, with the\r\nexception of Turkey, probably no European country has at the present\r\ntime more deficient transportation facilities than Spain.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively high state of civilization which existed in the\r\nItalian cities during the middle ages, their commercial and industrial\r\nthrift and the importance of Rome as the metropolis of the Catholic\r\nChurch combined to maintain many of the excellent ancient highways of\r\nItaly. A number of canals were built in Northern Italy as early as the\r\nfifteenth century, and it is claimed by some writers that locks were\r\nfirst used on the Milanese canals in 1497. But while public\r\nthoroughfares have always been well maintained in Northern Italy and\r\neven as far south as Naples, they were during the past two or three\r\ncenturies permitted to greatly deteriorate in the southern part of the\r\npeninsula, to the great detriment of both agriculture and commerce. The\r\ncondition of the large Italian islands is still more lamentable, Sicily\r\nand Sardinia being almost entirely devoid of roads. She that was the\r\ngranary of ancient Rome to-day scarcely produces enough grain to supply\r\nher own people.\r\n\r\nDenmark and the Scandinavian peninsula had a good system of highways\r\nlong before the railroad era. Among the many excellent canals of Sweden\r\nmay be mentioned the Göta Canal, which was commenced by Charles XII. in\r\nthe early part of the last century, but was not entirely completed until\r\n1832. It is, inclusive of the lakes, 118 miles long, and its\r\nconstruction cost $3,750,000, three-fifths of which was contributed by\r\nthe state. This canal connects the Baltic Sea with Lake Wener, as well\r\nas, through the Göta-Elf, with the North Sea.\r\n\r\nNext to Turkey and Spain, no country of Europe has been as slow to\r\nappreciate the advantages of a system of highways as Russia. At the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century the vast empire of the Czar had but\r\na few roads connecting its principal cities, and these were almost\r\nimpassable in the spring and fall. Much progress has, however, been made\r\nsince then, and at present Russia has over 75,000 miles of wagon-road\r\nand artificial waterway, and 19,000 miles of railroad. A road has been\r\nbuilt through Siberia, extending from the Ural Mountains to the city of\r\nJakutsk on the Lena and sending out many branch roads north and south.\r\nThe development of Russia's resources has kept pace with that of her\r\nsystem of highways, and the agricultural and mineral products of that\r\ncountry are in the markets of the world constantly gaining ground in\r\ntheir competition with the products of Western Europe and America.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the Western Hemisphere, we find that in ancient Peru the\r\nIncas built great roads, the remains of which still attest their\r\nmagnificence. Probably the most remarkable were the two which extended\r\nfrom Quito to Cuzco, and thence on toward Chile, one passing over the\r\ngreat Plateau, the other following the coast, Humboldt, in his \"Aspects\r\nof Nature,\" says of this mountain road: \"But what above all things\r\nrelieves the severe aspect of the deserts of the Cordilleras are the\r\nremains, as marvelous as unexpected, of a gigantic road, the work of the\r\nIncas. In the pass of the Andes between Mausi and Loja we found on the\r\nplain of Puttal much difficulty in making a way for the mules over a\r\nmarshy piece of ground, while for more than a German mile our sight\r\ncontinually rested on the superb remains of a paved road of the Incas,\r\ntwenty feet wide, which we marked resting on its deep foundations, and\r\npaved with well-cut, dark porphyritic stone. This road was wonderful and\r\ndoes not fall behind the most imposing Roman ways which I have seen in\r\nFrance, Spain and Italy. By barometrical observation I found that this\r\ncolossal work was at an elevation of 12,440 feet.\" The length of this\r\nroad, of which only parts remain, is variously estimated at from 1,500\r\nto 2,000 miles. It was built of stone and was, in some parts at least,\r\ncovered with a bituminous cement, which time had made harder than the\r\nstone itself. All the difficulties which a mountainous country presents\r\nto the construction of roads were here overcome. Suspension bridges led\r\nover mountain torrents, stairways cut in the rock made possible the\r\nclimbing of steep precipices, and mounds of solid masonry facilitated\r\nthe crossing of ravines. Under the rule of the Spaniards the roads of\r\nthe Incas went to ruin. In fact, throughout South America but little, if\r\nanything, was done by the mother country to aid transportation.\r\n\r\nNorth America, or at least that part of it which was settled by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race, fared much better in this respect. The great utility\r\nof good roads was universally recognized even in the colonial times, but\r\nthe scarcity of capital, the great extent of territory as compared with\r\nthe population, and the want of harmonious action among the various\r\ncolonies, delayed extensive road and canal building until after the\r\nestablishment of the Union. Mistaken local interests but too often\r\nwrecked well-advanced plans, and what road-building was done during the\r\ncolonial times was almost entirely left to individual exertion, without\r\nany direct aid from the government.\r\n\r\nThe first American turnpike was built in Pennsylvania in 1790. From\r\nthere the system extended into New York and Southern New England. Up to\r\n1822 more than six million dollars had been expended in Pennsylvania for\r\nturnpikes, one-third of which sum, or over $1,000 a mile, had been\r\ncontributed by the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 three wagon-roads connected the Atlantic coast with the country\r\nwest of the Alleghanies, one leading from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh,\r\none from the Potomac to the Monongahela, and a third passed through\r\nVirginia to Knoxville, in Tennessee. Much as was done during this period\r\nfor the improvement of the roads, stage-coach travel remained for years\r\ncomparatively slow. In 1792 Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State,\r\nwrote to the Postmaster-General to know if the post, which was then\r\ncarried at the rate of fifty miles a day, could not be expedited to one\r\nhundred. Even this latter rate was considered slow on the great\r\npost-roads forty years later. In the year 1800 one general mail-route\r\nwas extended from Maine to Georgia, the trip being made in twenty days.\r\nFrom Philadelphia a line went to Lexington in sixteen and to Nashville\r\nin twenty-two days. The government of the United States, appreciating\r\nthe importance, for military purposes, of good roads leading to the\r\nfrontiers, commenced the construction of national, or military, roads.\r\nA road was thus built from Baltimore through Cincinnati to St. Louis,\r\nand another from Bangor to Houlton, in Maine. In 1807 Albert Gallatin,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, advocated the extensive construction of\r\npublic roads and canals by the general government. Mr. Gallatin took the\r\nground that the inconveniences, complaints, and perhaps dangers,\r\nresulting from a vast extent of territory cannot otherwise be radically\r\nremoved than by opening speedy and easy communications through all its\r\nparts; that good roads and canals would shorten distances, facilitate\r\ncommercial and personal intercourse, and unite by a still more intimate\r\ncommunity of interests the most remote quarters of the United States,\r\nand that no other single operation within the power of the government\r\ncould more effectually tend to strengthen and perpetuate that union\r\nwhich secured external independence, domestic peace and internal\r\nliberty. The principal improvements recommended by Mr. Gallatin were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. Canals opening an inland navigation from Massachusetts to North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n2. Improvement of the navigation of the four great Atlantic rivers,\r\nincluding canals parallel to them.\r\n\r\n3. Great inland navigation by canals from the North River to Lake\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\n4. Inland navigation from the North River to Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\n5. Canal around the Falls and Rapids of Niagara.\r\n\r\n6. A great turnpike road from Maine to Georgia, along the whole extent\r\nof the Atlantic sea-coast.\r\n\r\n7. Four turnpike roads from the four great Atlantic rivers across the\r\nmountains to the four corresponding Western rivers.\r\n\r\n8. Improvement of the roads to Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. Gallatin also recommended that a sufficient number of local\r\nimprovements, consisting either of roads or canals, be undertaken so as\r\nto do substantial justice to all parts of the country. The expenditure\r\nnecessary for these improvements was estimated at twenty million\r\ndollars. Local jealousy and State rights prejudice practically defeated\r\nthis movement, the Cumberland road, or National Pike, being the only\r\nresult of any importance. The failure of the government to provide the\r\ncountry with adequate roads left the construction of turnpike roads to\r\nprivate enterprise, and these roads, before the general introduction of\r\nrailroads, often yielded much profit to capitalists. Great as were the\r\nconveniences afforded by the turnpike, they were entirely inadequate for\r\nthe development of the resources of the interior of the country. The\r\nproducts of a forest or a mine could not be transported upon them to any\r\ngreat extent. The crossing of a single water-shed, owing to the\r\nnecessity for largely increased motive power, would often materially\r\ndecrease the value of the goods to be transported.\r\n\r\nThese drawbacks of land transportation directed, toward the close of the\r\nlast century, the attention of the people of the United States to the\r\nnecessity of providing for a system of canals that should bind together\r\nthe various parts of their extended country in the interest of commerce.\r\nGeneral Washington was among the first to urge upon his countrymen the\r\nintroduction of this great highway of interstate traffic, although but\r\nlittle was done in this direction until after the War of 1812. The\r\npeople of New York had from an early period of the settlement of their\r\nState been impressed with the importance of connecting the Hudson with\r\nthe Western lakes. In 1768 the provincial legislature discussed this\r\nsubject, but the political agitations of the times and the following\r\nrevolutionary struggle arrested further proceedings. After the war the\r\nproject was frequently brought before the legislature, but nothing was\r\ndone until 1808, when the assembly appointed a committee to investigate\r\nthe subject and to solicit the coöperation of the general government, if\r\nthe project should be found practicable. The report of the committee\r\nconcerning the practicability of the undertaking was in every respect\r\nfavorable, and in 1810 the legislature provided for a survey of the\r\nentire route from the Hudson River to Lake Erie. The survey was made,\r\nbut, the expected aid from the national government not being\r\nforthcoming, the matter rested until after the war with England. In 1816\r\na new board of commissioners was appointed, and the following year an\r\nact was passed providing for a system of internal improvements in the\r\nState. On the 4th day of July next the excavation of the Erie Canal was\r\ncommenced, and on the 26th of October, 1825, the first boat passed from\r\nLake Erie to the Hudson. The canal was 378 miles long and four feet\r\ndeep. It had a width of 40 feet at the surface and 28 feet on the\r\nbottom, and carried boats of 76 tons burden. Owing to the rapid increase\r\nof trade, the capacity of the canal was found inadequate within ten\r\nyears after its opening, and in 1835 measures were taken to enlarge it\r\nto a width of 70 and 56 feet by a depth of seven feet, thus allowing the\r\npassage of boats of 240 tons. The total length of the canal was,\r\nhowever, subsequently shortened 12-1/2 miles, making its present length\r\n365-1/2 miles. This enlargement was completed in 1862, and cost the\r\nState over $7,000,000, making the total cost of the canal about\r\n$50,000,000. New York has, inclusive of branches, some ten other canals\r\nin operation, among them the Champlain Canal, extending from the head of\r\nLake Champlain to its junction with the Erie Canal at Waterford; the\r\nOswego Canal, from Lake Ontario at the city of Oswego to the Erie Canal\r\nat Syracuse; the Black River Canal, from Rome to Lyon Falls; the Cayuga\r\nand Seneca canals, extending from the Erie Canal to the Seneca and\r\nCayuga lakes. The State has expended for the construction of canals not\r\nless than $70,000,000.\r\n\r\nCanal-building in the State of Pennsylvania commenced about the time\r\nthat the original Erie Canal was completed in New York. In 1824 the\r\nlegislature authorized the appointment of commissioners to explore canal\r\nroutes from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and the West. A year later\r\nsurveys were authorized to be made from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, from\r\nAllegheny to Erie, from Philadelphia to the northern boundary of the\r\nState, and also south to the Potomac River. The construction of the main\r\nlines of communication between the east and the west and the coal fields\r\nin the north was soon commenced. Large loans were repeatedly made, and\r\nthe work was vigorously prosecuted. In 1834 Pennsylvania had 589 miles\r\nof State canals, among them the Central Division Canal, 172 miles long,\r\nand the Western Division Canal, 104 miles long. Public opinion strongly\r\nfavored an extended system of internal improvements, and it was believed\r\nthat these water-ways would soon become a source of revenue to the\r\nState. These expectations might have been realized had the State carried\r\non enterprises on a less extensive and more economical basis. In 1840\r\nthe financial condition of the State had become such that canal-building\r\nhad to be abandoned. The amount expended by the State of Pennsylvania\r\nfor canals, including the Columbia Railroad, was about $40,000,000,\r\nwhile the difference between net earnings and interest paid by the State\r\nup to that time is estimated at $30,000,000. In 1857 and 1858 these\r\nworks were sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Sunbury and\r\nErie Railway Company for $11,375,000, or about one-sixth of their cost\r\nto the State.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio the legislature authorized the survey of a canal from Lake Erie\r\nto the Ohio River. In 1825 an act was passed providing for the\r\nconstruction of the Ohio Canal and a number of feeders. In 1831 the\r\ncanal was in operation from Cleveland to Newark, a distance of 176\r\nmiles, and the whole system was finished in 1833.\r\n\r\nThe State of Illinois completed in 1848 the Illinois and Michigan Canal,\r\nconnecting Chicago with La Salle on the Illinois River. This canal is\r\n102 miles long, 60 feet wide and six feet deep. The construction by the\r\ngeneral government of the Hennepin Ship Canal, connecting the\r\nMississippi with Lake Michigan, has long been agitated in the Northwest.\r\nSuch a canal would be one of the most important channels of commerce in\r\nthe country, and it is to be hoped that this great project will be\r\ncompleted at no distant day.\r\n\r\nWe have besides in the United States a large number of canals that were\r\nconstructed, and are still operated, by private companies, as the\r\nDelaware and Hudson in New York and Pennsylvania, the Schuylkill, Lehigh\r\nand Union canals in Pennsylvania, the Morris Canal in New Jersey, the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio and Maryland, etc. A large number of canals, some\r\npublic and others private property, have since the construction of\r\nrailroads been abandoned. Thus in New York 356 miles of canals, costing\r\n$10,235,000; in Pennsylvania 477 miles, costing $12,745,000; in Ohio 205\r\nmiles, costing $3,000,000; in Indiana 379 miles, costing $6,325,000, are\r\nno longer in use. All the canals that were ever built in New England\r\nhave likewise been abandoned for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nNor was Canada slow in realizing the advantages which a system of canals\r\nconnecting the great lakes with the Atlantic Ocean promised to give her.\r\nThe construction of the Welland and St. Lawrence canals made it possible\r\nfor vessels to clear from Chicago direct for Liverpool, and this has to\r\na considerable extent diverted grain shipments to Montreal, giving the\r\nCanadian dealers a decided advantage in this traffic.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact that, at least in this country, the zenith of the\r\ncanal-building era is found in the decade following the invention of the\r\nsteam railroad. For many years it was not believed that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the iron horse could ever compete with the canal boat in\r\nrates. The most sagacious business men had unlimited faith in the\r\ndestiny of the canal as a prime commercial factor and invested largely\r\nin canal stocks. To many these investments proved a disappointment. The\r\nmarvelous improvements in locomotives and other rolling stock, the\r\nunprecedented reductions in the prices of iron and steel, and above all\r\nthe fact that in our climate canal carriage is unavailable during five\r\nmonths of the year, gave the railroads a decided advantage in their\r\ncompetition with canal transportation. There can be no doubt, however,\r\nthat the presence of this competition was one of the chief causes of the\r\ngreat reduction of railroad rates on through routes. In this respect\r\nalone the canals have accomplished a very important mission. In the\r\ntransportation of many of the raw products of the soil and the mine\r\ncanals still compete successfully with the railroads, and it is still an\r\nopen question whether future inventions may not enable them to regain\r\nlost ground in the carriage of other goods. It would certainly be a\r\nshort-sighted policy for our people to discourage the construction of\r\nnew canals.\r\n\r\nFor the improvement of navigable rivers, appropriations have been made\r\nby Congress ever since the establishment of our national government, and\r\nthese appropriations now amount to millions of dollars annually. Since\r\nthe introduction of railroads the usefulness of these national highways\r\nof commerce has ceased to depend upon the tonnage carried upon them, but\r\nthe influence which they exert upon the cost of transportation is so\r\ngreat that it is not likely that the policy of making annual\r\nappropriations for the improvement of these water ways will be abandoned\r\nby the American people for many years to come.\r\n\r\nThere has recently been a strong agitation in some portions of the\r\nUnited States in favor of extending government aid to the Nicaragua Ship\r\nCanal, and there seem to be indeed many arguments in favor of such a\r\npolicy. President Harrison said in his annual message to Congress in\r\nDecember, 1891:\r\n\r\n      \"The annual report of the Maritime Canal Company of\r\n      Nicaragua shows that much costly and necessary preparatory\r\n      work has been done during the past year in the construction\r\n      of shops, railroad tracks and harbor piers and breakwaters,\r\n      and that the work of canal construction has made some\r\n      progress. I deem it to be a matter of the highest concern to\r\n      the United States that this canal, connecting the waters of\r\n      the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and giving to us a short\r\n      water communication between our ports upon those two great\r\n      seas, should be speedily constructed, and at the smallest\r\n      practical limit of cost. The gain in freights to the people\r\n      and the direct saving to the government of the United\r\n      States in the use of its naval vessels would pay the entire\r\n      cost of the work within a short series of years. The report\r\n      of the Secretary of the Navy shows the saving in our naval\r\n      expenditures which would result. The Senator from Alabama,\r\n      Mr. Morgan, in his argument upon this subject before the\r\n      Senate of the last session, did not overestimate the\r\n      importance of the work when he said that 'The canal is the\r\n      most important subject now connected with the commercial\r\n      growth and progress of the United States.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his message of 1892 that:\r\n\r\n      \"It is impossible to overestimate the value from every\r\n      standpoint of this great enterprise, and I hope that there\r\n      will be time, even in this Congress, to give it an impetus\r\n      that will insure the early completion of the canal and\r\n      secure to the United States its proper relation to it when\r\n      completed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is sincerely to be hoped that the people of the United States can be\r\nconvinced of the advisability of extending government aid to this\r\nenterprise. It must be admitted that the experience of our government\r\nwith the Pacific railroads has created a strong prejudice among the\r\nmasses against such subsidies as were granted to those corporations, but\r\nit is probable, with the people on the alert, that Congress would not\r\nagain permit great impositions to be practiced against the government.\r\nWhen the great advantages to be derived by the people of the United\r\nStates from the use of this canal and the small outlay required are\r\nconsidered, it would seem to be a wise policy for our government at once\r\nto take such steps as are necessary to secure the early completion and\r\nthe future control of this great international highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF RAILROADS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making inquiry into those inventions and improvements which were the\r\nprecursors of the modern railroad, we meet early the desire to render\r\nthe movement of wagons easier by a smooth roadway. Traces of this may be\r\nfound even in ancient times. The Romans constructed tracks consisting of\r\ntwo lines of cut stones, and in the older Italian cities stone tracks\r\nmay still be seen in the streets, corresponding to wagon tracks, and\r\nevidently designed for the purpose of rendering the movement of the\r\nwheels easier.\r\n\r\nThe first rail tracks of which we have any knowledge were constructed at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century. These rails, which were made of wood,\r\nappear to have been an invention of miners in the Hartz Mountains. They\r\nwere the result of pressing necessity, for, as mines were usually so\r\nsituated that roads could only with great difficulty and expense have\r\nbeen built to them, some cheaper sort of communication with the high\r\nroad had to be contrived.\r\n\r\nAfter various experiments the wooden railway was adopted, and the\r\nproduct of the mine was carried upon them to the place of shipment by\r\nmeans of small cars. Queen Elizabeth had miners brought into England, to\r\ndevelop the English mines, and through them the rail track was\r\nintroduced into Great Britain. Later the wooden rail was covered with an\r\niron strap to prevent the rapid wear of the wood, and about the year\r\n1768 cast-iron rails commenced to be used. At the end of the last\r\ncentury wheels were constructed with flanges, to prevent derailing.\r\nMore attention was also paid to the substructure, wood, iron and stone\r\nbeing used for this purpose. Wrought-iron rails were patented in 1820.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic account of heat or steam engines is found in the\r\n\"Pneumatica\" of Hero of Alexandria, who lived in the second century\r\nbefore Christ. Hero describes a number of contrivances by which steam\r\nwas utilized as a source of power. Although these contrivances were at\r\nthe time of very little practical value, they are interesting as the\r\nprototypes of the modern steam engine. The attempts to move wheels by\r\nsteam date back to the seventeenth century, when a number of experiments\r\nwere made, but their exact nature is not known, because they were all\r\nsoon abandoned, either on account of unsuccessful results or lack of\r\nmeans. At the beginning of the eighteenth century Denis Papin\r\nconstructed a small steamboat, upon which he sailed in 1707 on the Fulda\r\nRiver from Cassel to Munden, a distance of about fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe construction of locomotives engaged the attention of ingenious minds\r\na century and a half ago. It is claimed that Newton experimented with a\r\nsteam motor in 1680. Dr. Robinson described in 1759, in his \"Mechanical\r\nPhilosophy,\" a steam vehicle. The Glasgow engineer James Watt devoted\r\nhimself from 1769 to 1785, with great energy, to the development of the\r\nsteam engine, and succeeded in inventing the system which became the\r\nparent of the modern engine. An American, Oliver Evans, constructed at\r\nthe beginning of the present century a carriage propelled by steam, and\r\nexhibited it, in 1804, in the streets of Philadelphia, before twenty\r\nthousand spectators. While Evans' invention was never put to any\r\npractical use, he prophesied that the time would come when steam cars\r\nwould be considered the most perfect means of transportation. On\r\nChristmas eve, 1801, Richard Trevithick exhibited at Camborne, England,\r\na steam coach, and soon afterwards he and his cousin, A. Vivian,\r\nobtained an English patent on a \"steam engine for propelling carriages.\"\r\nSeven years later a Mr. Blinkensop, of Middleton Colliery, near Leeds,\r\nconstructed another locomotive engine, upon which he obtained a patent\r\nin 1811. These and a number of other inventors of steam engines vainly\r\nexpended great ingenuity in attempting to overcome a purely imaginary\r\ndifficulty. They believed that the adhesion between the face of the\r\nwheel and the surface of the road was so slight that a considerable\r\nportion of the propelling power would be lost by the slipping of the\r\nwheels. It was not until about the year 1813 that the important fact was\r\nascertained that the friction of the wheels with the rails was\r\nsufficient to propel the locomotive and even drag after it a load of\r\nconsiderable weight. On the other hand these inventors failed to provide\r\nin their engines adequate heating-power for the production of steam. In\r\n1814 George Stephenson commenced to apply himself to the construction of\r\nan improved locomotive. When, owing to his invention of the tubular\r\nboiler, he saw, after fifteen years of arduous toil, his labors crowned\r\nwith success, the civilized world entered upon a new era of social,\r\nindustrial and commercial life. The first line upon which Stephenson's\r\ninvention was used was the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In the year\r\n1821, a number of Liverpool merchants formulated a plan for the\r\nconstruction of a tramway between their city and Manchester. The\r\nquestion of motive power was left open as between horses and the steam\r\nengine, with which Mr. Stephenson was then experimenting. After much\r\nopposition on the part of Parliament and the public a charter was\r\nobtained in 1826. When the construction of the road was nearly\r\ncompleted, the directors of the company, after having determined upon\r\nthe use of steam engines, offered a prize of £500 for the best\r\nlocomotive engine to run at a public trial on the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway. This proposal was announced in the spring of 1829,\r\nand the trial took place at Rainhill on the 6th of October of that year.\r\nThe competing engines were the Rocket, constructed by Mr. Stephenson;\r\nthe Sanspareil, by Hackworth; the Perseverance, by Burstall, and the\r\nNovelty, by Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericsson. Both Braithwaite and\r\nEricsson became subsequently residents of the United States, and the\r\nlatter achieved immortal fame as the inventor of the screw propeller and\r\nthe builder of the Monitor. The Rocket was the only engine that\r\nperformed the complete journey proposed, and obtained the prize. It is\r\nclaimed by the biographers of John Ericsson that he had really built a\r\nmuch faster locomotive than Stephenson, and that, although it had to be\r\nconstructed very hastily and therefore broke down during the trial, the\r\nsuperiority of the principle involved in it was universally recognized\r\nby the engineers of that time. The Stephenson engines became the motive\r\npower of the Liverpool and Manchester road, which was opened for public\r\ntraffic on the 16th of September, 1830. This line was, however, neither\r\nthe first public railway nor even the first steam railway. The first\r\nrailway or tramway act was passed in England in 1758, and in 1824 no\r\nless than thirty-three private railway or tramway companies had been\r\nchartered. In 1824 a charter was granted by Parliament authorizing the\r\nconstruction of the Darlington and Stockton Railway, to be worked with\r\n\"men and horses, or otherwise.\" By a subsequent act the company was\r\nempowered to work its railway with locomotive engines. The road was\r\nopened in September, 1825, and was practically the first public carrier\r\nof goods and passengers. The Monklands Railway in Scotland, opened in\r\n1826, and several other small lines soon followed the example of the\r\nDarlington and Stockton line and adopted steam traction, but the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway was the first to convince the world\r\nthat a revolution in traveling had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe road was from the very first successful, its traffic and income\r\ngreatly exceeding the expectations of its managers. It should also be\r\nnoted here that the cost of construction fell largely below the\r\nelaborate estimates made by several distinguished engineers. The company\r\nhad expected to earn about £10,000 a year from passenger traffic, and\r\nthe very first year the receipts from that source were £101,829. The\r\ngross annual receipts from freight had been estimated at £50,000, but\r\nwere £80,000 in 1833. From the first the stockholders obtained a\r\ndividend of eight per cent., which soon rose to nine and to ten per\r\ncent. It has since been demonstrated that the revenues of new roads\r\nalmost always exceed expectations.\r\n\r\nThe success of this railway stimulated railway enterprise throughout\r\nEurope and America. But while railroad projects created much enthusiasm\r\non one side, they also met with bitter opposition on the other. The\r\nprejudice of the short-sighted and the avarice of those whose interests\r\nwere threatened by a change in the mode of transportation used every\r\nweapon in their power against the proposed innovation. The arguments\r\nused were often most absurd. It was said that the smoke of the engine\r\nwas injurious to both man and beast, and that the sparks escaping from\r\nit would set fire to the buildings along the line of road, the cows\r\nwould be scared and would cease to give their milk, that horses would\r\ndepreciate in value, and that their race would finally become extinct.\r\nNor did many of the European governments favor the new system of\r\ntransportation. Some openly opposed it as revolutionary and productive\r\nof infinitely more evil than good. The Austrian court and statesmen\r\nespecially looked upon the new contrivance with undisguised distrust;\r\nand from their point of view this distrust was perhaps well founded. The\r\nrapid movement of the iron horse seemed to savor of dangerous\r\nradicalism, not to say revolution. When the Emperor finally, in 1836,\r\nconcluded to sign a railroad charter, he based his action upon the\r\ndubious ground that \"the thing cannot maintain itself, anyhow.\" It may\r\nbe said that the history of the railroad is a conspicuous illustration\r\nof human short-sightedness. The Prussian Postmaster-General Von Nagler\r\nopposed the construction of a railroad between Berlin and Potsdam upon\r\nthe ground that the passenger business between those two cities was not\r\nsufficient to keep even the stage-coach always full. It never occurred\r\nto the Postmaster-General, as it does not occur to many railroad men of\r\nto-day, that new and cheaper means of transportation increase the\r\ntraffic. Even so wise a statesman as Thiers said when railroad\r\nconstruction was first agitated in France: \"I do not see how railroads\r\ncan compete with our stage-coaches.\" M. Thiers also opposed for years\r\nthe building of a railroad between Paris and Versailles, declaring that\r\non account of a railroad not one passenger more would make the journey\r\nbetween these two places.\r\n\r\nBut railroads came whether monarchical governments liked them or not.\r\nThe success of the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad stimulated railroad\r\nbuilding in England to a marvelous extent. Between 1830 and 1843 no\r\nless than seventy-one different companies were organized, representing\r\nabout 2,100 miles. During the next four years 637 more roads, with an\r\nauthorized length of 9,400 miles, were chartered. The construction of\r\neach new road required a special act of Parliament. These early roads\r\naveraged only fifteen to thirty miles in length. The competition which\r\nensued soon led to the consolidation of roads, which continued until now\r\nthe 14,000 miles of railway in England and Wales are practically owned\r\nby only a dozen companies. The total number of miles of railroad in\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland is at present over 20,000.\r\n\r\nThe news of the opening of the first steam railway in England spread\r\nthrough Europe comparatively slowly. There were in those days but few\r\nnewspapers printed on the continent, and these were read very sparingly.\r\nRailroad discussions were confined to merchants and manufacturers. Even\r\nafter the success of the railroad was assured in England, a large number\r\nof people would not believe that, except between the largest cities,\r\nrailroads on the continent could ever be profitable. But few railroads\r\nhave ever been built which with honest, efficient and economical\r\nmanagement would not pay a fair rate of interest on actual cost of\r\nconstruction. But in spite of this we have to this day a large number of\r\notherwise well-informed people who question the financial success of\r\nevery new railroad that is proposed.\r\n\r\nIn those days it occurred only to the most sagacious minds that with\r\nincreased facilities commerce would expand. The missionaries of railroad\r\nenterprise found it therefore a difficult matter to interest capital in\r\ntheir projects. Railroad committees were in time formed in all cities of\r\nany importance, but, with capital cowardly, as usual, and governments\r\ndistrustful, their task was often a thankless one. Railroad projects\r\nmatured very slowly, and, when matured, were often wrecked by jealous\r\nand short-sighted governments. After the formation of a company five and\r\neven ten years would often pass away before a charter could be secured\r\nand the work of construction commenced. It is true, there were some\r\nlaudable exceptions to this rule. Thus the governments of France and\r\nBelgium led the people in railroad construction; but upon the whole it\r\ncan be said that the railroad forced itself by its intrinsic merit upon\r\nmonarchical governments. It soon became evident even to the most stupid\r\nof autocratic ministries that it was a choice between the new mode of\r\ntransportation and national atrophy.\r\n\r\nThe first German line was built between the cities of Nuremberg and\r\nFurth in 1835. It was only about four miles long, but the success of the\r\nexperiment gave an impetus to railroad building in other parts of\r\nGermany. The Leipzig and Dresden line followed in 1837, and the\r\nBerlin-Potsdam and Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel lines in 1838. At the end of\r\n1840 Germany had 360 miles of railroad. In that year Frederick William\r\nIV. succeeded to the throne of Prussia and inaugurated a new and\r\nexceedingly liberal railroad policy in his realm. In 1843 the Prussian\r\ngovernment concluded to guarantee certain railroad companies a dividend\r\nof 3-1/2 per cent. on the capital actually invested. The state also\r\nsecured considerable influence in the administration of the roads as\r\nwell as in the right to assume the management of the various lines under\r\ncertain conditions. The governments of the states of Southern Germany\r\nnow commenced to build state roads, and their example was, chiefly for\r\nstrategic reasons, soon imitated by Prussia. The system has since grown\r\nto over 26,000 miles, and no less than eighty-seven per cent. of the\r\nmileage is under state control. In all the states and provinces of the\r\nempire, except Bavaria, the rates for transportation of passengers and\r\nfreight on all lines are controlled absolutely by the government.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, as has already been indicated, the building of railways was\r\ngreatly discouraged by the government until 1836. In that year the\r\nEmperor rather reluctantly granted Baron Rothschild a charter for a\r\nrailway from Vienna into the province of Galicia. Another charter was\r\ngranted to a Baron Sina for a line from Vienna to Raab and Gloggnitz.\r\nThe policy then adopted in Austria guaranteed to each railroad company a\r\nmonopoly in its own district during the period for which the charter was\r\ngranted. Soon after the state also commenced building lines, but the\r\ngrowth of the Austrian system was slow until after the war of 1866. An\r\nera of railroad speculation was then inaugurated, which ended with the\r\ncrisis of 1873. The total length of the railroads of Austria-Hungary was\r\n10,790 miles in 1875. At present that monarchy has nearly 16,400 miles\r\nof railway, 8,600 of which are owned by private companies.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of Austria to reduce rates, and several roads,\r\nespecially those built in mountainous districts, have a certain revenue\r\nguaranteed to them by the government.\r\n\r\nThe zone system recently adopted in Hungary reduced both the passenger\r\nand freight rates of the government roads at least one-third, and this\r\nreduction has, contrary to expectation, greatly increased their net\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\nIn France railroad agitation commenced in 1832. A few short lines were\r\nopened, as those from Paris to St. Germain and to Versailles; but,\r\nowing to the conservatism of French capitalists, but little more was\r\ndone until the state took the matter in hand. Thiers proposed a scheme\r\nby which the state was to furnish about half the cost while private\r\ncompanies were to build the lines and operate them. The Western\r\nRailroad, the first line of any great extent, was opened in 1837 between\r\nParis and Rouen, and the Eastern Railroad was opened two years later.\r\nThere were in 1859 six large companies operating their lines with\r\nprofit, but, to induce them to build additional lines that were needed,\r\nthe state guaranteed the interest on the capital required to make their\r\nimprovements. In 1884 there were about 17,000 miles of railroad in\r\noperation. To bring about the construction of another 7,000 miles of\r\nroad, and to thus complete the railroad system of the country, the\r\ngovernment now guaranteed each company a dividend equal to the average\r\nof recent years, but not to exceed seven per cent. It is doubtful\r\nwhether this system of monopoly has in all respects been favorable to\r\nthe encouragement of enterprise in the railroad circles of France. In\r\ngranting charters the state has, however, reserved valuable rights which\r\nat a future period it will have an opportunity to assert for the public\r\nbenefit. The railroad companies have generally a lease for ninety-nine\r\nyears, and their lines become the property of the state after the\r\nexpiration of that period. To extinguish the bonded debt and stock, a\r\nsinking fund has been created, from which a certain portion of the\r\nshares and outstanding bonds is annually paid off and canceled. The\r\ngovernment requires of the companies the free carriage of the mails and\r\nthe transportation of military and other employes at very low rates.\r\nBesides this the state levies upon the traffic of the railroads a duty\r\nof ten per cent. of their gross earnings from passengers and from all\r\ngoods carried by fast trains. These facts are usually overlooked by our\r\nrailroad men when they indulge in making comparisons between the\r\nrailroad rates of this country and those of France. The French Republic\r\nhad 13,400 miles of road in 1875, and 22,600 in 1890. When all of the\r\nproposed lines are completed, the total mileage of that country will be\r\nover 25,000.\r\n\r\nBelgium has the best-developed track system on the continent. The state\r\ncommenced the construction of railroads as early as 1834, and the first\r\nline (Brussels Malines) was opened May 5th, 1835. Four great state lines\r\nwere constructed in different directions, and between these lines\r\nprivate roads were permitted to be built. Between 1850 and 1870 the\r\nprivate lines increased from 200 to 1,400 miles, and competition between\r\nthem and the state lines became so active as to reduce rates to the\r\nlowest possible point. In 1870 the government decided to buy a large\r\nnumber of competing lines. In 1874 it had acquired more than half, and\r\nat present, with a few exceptions, they are all owned and controlled by\r\nthe state. The exceptions to this are a few short lines that were built\r\nin the early days of railroad construction. The total mileage is now\r\n3,210. Rates have, however, not been increased since this consolidation,\r\nand they are still lower than any other country in Europe. The\r\ntransportation of mails is free, and troops, military materials and\r\nprison vans are carried at reduced rates.\r\n\r\nRailroads were originally built in Switzerland merely for the\r\naccommodation of tourists and the local traffic. The first line, between\r\nZurich and Aarau, was completed in 1847, but general railroad enterprise\r\ndid not develop until after 1860. The St. Gothard route was then\r\nprojected, which opened a direct through line between Italy and\r\nGermany. The roads are all owned by private companies, but are under\r\nstrict government control. Great publicity of their affairs is required.\r\nThe total mileage of Switzerland was 2,043 in 1891.\r\n\r\nIn Italy railroad enterprises have received attention since 1853. The\r\nfirst roads were those of Lombardy, being commenced while that province\r\nwas still under Austrian rule. The treaties of Zurich in 1859 and of\r\nVienna in 1866 delivered these roads and the Venetian lines to the\r\nkingdom of Italy. Between 1860 and 1870 the systematic construction of a\r\nrailroad net was commenced which connected the various lines with each\r\nother and with Rome. Nearly all the railroads of Italy fell into the\r\nhands of the government, but in 1885 they were leased for a term of\r\nsixty years to three companies, terminable at the end of twenty or forty\r\nyears by either party upon two years' notice. Under the lease the state\r\nreceived two per cent. of the gross receipts. The tariffs are fixed by\r\nthe state, are uniform and can be reduced by the state. A Council of\r\nTariffs, composed of delegates for the government, for agriculture,\r\ncommerce and industry, and for the railroad companies, all elected by\r\ntheir own boards, has been instituted to study the wants and best\r\ninterests of the country. The total number of miles of railroad in Italy\r\nwas 8,110 in 1889.\r\n\r\nThe first road in Spain was opened in 1848 between Barcelona and Mataro.\r\nThe government greatly encouraged railroad construction by subsidies,\r\nand during the decade following 1855 the development of the railway\r\nsystem of the country was rapid. More than thirty companies have been\r\nformed, which have built about twenty main lines, aggregating 6,200\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal very little railroad building was done previous to 1863,\r\nwhen a little over three hundred miles of road was constructed. The\r\ngovernment owns nearly half of the roads of the country, the remaining\r\nlines being the property of private companies. The total number of miles\r\noperated in the kingdom in 1889 was 1,280. The service and the financial\r\ncondition of the roads of Portugal are far from being satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the first railroad was built on the island of Seeland in\r\n1847. Previous to 1880 the larger part of the roads of the kingdom was\r\nowned by private companies. Since then several of the most important\r\nprivate roads have been purchased by the state, which in 1889 owned 963\r\nmiles, while only 251 miles remained in private control. Only about\r\nthirty miles more have since been constructed. The roads are well\r\nmanaged, but their net earnings are less than two per cent. of the\r\ncapital invested.\r\n\r\nOn the Scandinavian Peninsula the railroad system has developed rather\r\nslowly. Norway built the first line from Christiana to Eidsvold in 1854,\r\nand Sweden commenced railroad building two years later. The narrow-gauge\r\nsystem is fully developed here. While in Norway the greater part of the\r\nlines is owned by the state, the roads of Sweden are chiefly in the\r\nhands of private companies which on an average control but little more\r\nthan twenty-five miles each. The total mileage of Sweden is 5,970, and\r\nthat of Norway 970.\r\n\r\nThe first line of railroad in the Russian Empire was constructed from\r\nSt. Petersburg, sixteen miles, to Tsarskoji-Sielo, in 1842. The St.\r\nPetersburg and Moscow line was opened in 1851. Railroad building then\r\nstagnated until after the Crimean War, when a large number of lines\r\nwere constructed at once. The roads were surveyed by the government, but\r\nconstructed and operated by private companies.\r\n\r\nState aid was, however, freely given. During the past ten years the\r\nRussian government has directed its attention to the development of the\r\nrailroad system in its Asiatic possessions. A railway between the Black\r\nand Caspian seas was completed in 1883, and the Siberian railroad is\r\nextended as fast as the financial condition of the empire permits. There\r\nare now about 20,000 miles of road in the Russian Empire operated by\r\nprivate companies. The construction of a large number of the Russian\r\nrailways was dictated by military rather than commercial considerations.\r\nMaximum rates are specified in charter, and every change of rates must\r\nbe approved by the Minister of Finance.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkan Peninsula railroad facilities are still ill provided for.\r\nA few lines have been built, but these are, as a rule, badly managed.\r\nTrains are slow, and rates often so high as to be prohibitory. Roumania\r\nhas undoubtedly the best railroad system of any of the Balkan states,\r\nthe government controlling 1,000 miles of road. Greece is also making\r\nsome progress and has at the present time 610 miles of railway. There is\r\nreason to believe that through communication will soon be established in\r\nthese countries on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the railway into Asia has been, except in the\r\nRussian and English possessions, a very difficult task. The conservatism\r\nor ignorance of the governments and the superstition of the people\r\ncombined to throw numberless obstacles before those who proposed to pave\r\nthe way for the iron horse. British India opened her first railway for\r\npublic traffic between Bombay and Tannah on November 18, 1852. In 1855\r\nshe had 841 miles of road, which increased to 6,515 miles in 1875 and to\r\n15,828 miles in 1889, of which 8,423 miles were owned and operated by\r\nthe state. The total cost of these roads was $880,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn Asiatic Turkey the first line was opened between Smyrna and Trianda\r\non the 24th day of December, 1860. This line was in 1866 extended to\r\nAiden, and in 1882 to Sarakio. There are at present five lines with a\r\ntotal extent of 446 miles, all owned by English companies. New lines,\r\ncovering in all 3,952 miles, have recently been projected.\r\n\r\nThe first line in Persia, only seven miles long, and extending from\r\nTeheran to Schah-Abdal-Azzim, was opened on the 25th day of June, 1888.\r\nAnother line, from the Caspian Sea to Amol, is now in process of\r\nconstruction. A line was opened last September between Joppa and\r\nJerusalem. It is 53 miles in length.\r\n\r\nJapan may be said to be already thoroughly familiar with the European\r\nsystem. The first and principal line was opened on the island of Napon,\r\nbetween Tokio and Yokohama, on the 14th of October, 1872. Two other\r\nshort lines followed in 1874 and 1876, when the total extent of the\r\nJapanese roads was about 135 miles. In 1883 the construction of the\r\nGrand Trunk Railroad, from Tokio to Kioto, was commenced, which line has\r\nbeen in operation for the past five years. Other lines, aggregating over\r\n400 miles, will soon be opened for traffic. The total extent of road in\r\noperation in 1888 was 580 miles, 310 of which were controlled by the\r\nstate, and the remainder by private companies. In 1890 the total number\r\nof miles exceeded 900. The total average cost per mile was $58,000.\r\n\r\nNo nation has probably opposed the introduction of the railway as\r\nstubbornly as the Chinese. The first railroad, scarcely seven miles\r\nlong, was built by an English company near Kaiping to facilitate the\r\ntransportation of coal from the mines in that vicinity. In 1886 a\r\nChinese company purchased this line and has since extended it to\r\nTientsin, making its present length about eighty-four miles. The Chinese\r\ngovernment has recently authorized the further extension of this line to\r\nYangchou, a place but a few miles distant from Pekin.\r\n\r\nOf the Asiatic islands Java has the largest and oldest railroad system.\r\nOn the 10th of August, 1867, the first line was opened between Samarang\r\nand Tangveng. Other coast lines have since been constructed, but\r\ncommunication is still sadly neglected in the interior. In 1889 there\r\nwere operated on the island nearly 800 miles of road, the greater part\r\nbeing the property of private companies.\r\n\r\nA road was opened upon the island of Ceylon between Colombo and Kandy in\r\n1867, to which several branch lines and extensions have since been\r\nadded. The total system comprises at present about 180 miles.\r\n\r\nShort lines have also been built in Burmah (1889); in the Malay\r\nPeninsula (1885), in Sumatra (1876), and in Cochin China (1885). A line\r\nfrom Bangkok to Bianghsen, in Siam, is being projected at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, if we except its northern coast, the construction of\r\nrailroads has only kept pace with the slow development of the resources\r\nof that continent. Its European colonies are still but thinly inhabited,\r\nand their industrial and commercial life still resembles much that of\r\nthe American colonies of the seventeenth century. There can be little\r\ndoubt, however, that with the increasing immigration the growing demand\r\nfor better transportation facilities will speedily be met by European\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad upon African soil was built by the Egyptian\r\ngovernment from Alexandria to Cairo, and from there through the desert\r\nto Suez. A part of this line, 130 miles long, was opened to traffic in\r\n1856, and the remaining ninety miles the year following. Nothing further\r\nwas done until after Ismail Pasha ascended the throne, in 1863. The\r\nrailroad system of Lower Egypt, between Alexandria in the west, Cairo in\r\nthe south, and Ismaila in the east, was then greatly extended and the\r\nservice materially improved.\r\n\r\nAfter the opening of the Suez Canal the line through the desert to Suez\r\nwas abandoned. The railroad system of Egypt comprises at present about\r\n1,250 miles, all of which belongs to the government except two short\r\nlines which are private property.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the railroad system of Algiers dates back to 1860, when\r\nthe French government gave a charter to the Companie des Chemins de Fer\r\nAlgérians, authorizing it to build a number of lines connecting the\r\nprincipal cities of the province with the Mediterranean. The line from\r\nAlgiers to Blidah, thirty-two miles long, was opened on September 8,\r\n1862. Further construction was then delayed until 1863, when the charter\r\nof the original company was transferred to the Paris, Lyons and\r\nMediterranean Railroad Company. The original plans were then in the main\r\ncarried out, until the disturbances caused by the Franco-Prussian war\r\nagain put an end to railroad enterprises. In 1874 three new companies\r\nwere chartered and railroad building was resumed. In 1888 the Algerian\r\nrailroad system comprised 1,350 miles.\r\n\r\nThe first road in Tunis was built in 1872 from the city of Tunis to\r\nBardo and Gouletta by English capitalists. It was, in 1880, sold to an\r\nItalian company to which the Italian government for political reasons\r\nhad seen fit to guarantee certain dividends. Other small lines have\r\nsince been constructed, and more important ones have been prospected.\r\nThe number of miles at present in operation is 153.\r\n\r\nThe French colony on the Senegal River has a number of short lines, of\r\nwhich the first was opened in July, 1883. These lines aggregate at\r\npresent about 200 miles. It is now contemplated to extend this system to\r\nthe upper Niger. This would necessitate the construction of 240\r\nadditional miles of road.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Colony has the largest mileage of any of the European colonies\r\nin Africa, the absence of navigable rivers rendering railroads here more\r\nnecessary than elsewhere. The first line was opened on the 13th of\r\nFebruary, 1862. It then extended from Cape Town to Earste River, but was\r\nextended to Wellington the following year. The number of miles of road\r\nin operation in 1875 was 906, and in 1891 it had increased to 2,067. All\r\nthe roads of the colony, excepting a line of 93 miles belonging to the\r\nCape Copper Mining Company, are operated by the colonial government.\r\nTheir net revenue in 1886 was 2.84 per cent. of the capital actually\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nPort Natal built her first railroad in 1860. It was only two miles long\r\nand extended from the city of Durban to its harbor. Since then several\r\ninland lines, aggregating over four hundred miles, have been constructed\r\nat a cost of twenty-two million dollars. The roads are operated by the\r\ncolonial government and yielded in 1891 a net revenue of 4.4 per cent.\r\non the capital expended.\r\n\r\nShort lines have also been built on Mauritius and Reunion, and there is\r\nnow every indication that Portuguese Africa and the Congo State will be\r\nprovided with railroad facilities in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of railroads into Australia dates back to the sixth\r\ndecade of the present century. The total number of miles of road\r\nreported in 1889 by the several colonies was 8,883. If we estimate the\r\npopulation of the continent at 3,000,000 for that year it will be seen\r\nthat Australia has more miles of road per capita than any other grand\r\ndivision of the globe, save North America.\r\n\r\nNew South Wales, the mother colony of the Australian continent, opened\r\nits first road on September 26, 1855, between Sydney and Paramalta. This\r\nroad was built by a private company, but was soon after its completion\r\npurchased by the colonial government, and was in 1869 extended to\r\nGoulbourn. In 1875 the colony had only 436 miles of road in operation.\r\nThe mountains, however, which separated the wide plains of the interior\r\nfrom the coast had been surmounted, and the government commenced to push\r\nthe construction of new roads with great vigor. At the end of the year\r\n1886 New South Wales had no less than 1,888 miles of road in operation,\r\nfor which the colony had expended $113,000,000. The net revenue during\r\nthat year was 2.9 per cent. on the capital invested. The total number of\r\nmiles of railroad in this colony was 2,247 in 1889.\r\n\r\nVictoria, the smallest of the colonies, has made by far the greatest\r\nprogress in railroad building. The first road in the colony, and, in\r\nfact, the first road upon the Australian continent, was built in 1854\r\nbetween the city of Melbourne and its port, a distance of two and\r\none-half miles. Within the next five years four other lines were\r\nconstructed, connecting Melbourne with Williamstown, St. Kilda,\r\nBrighton and Echuca, respectively. In 1870 there were in the colony 275\r\nmiles of railroad, which had increased to 1,198 miles in 1880, and to\r\n2,283 miles in 1889. Several of the roads were originally owned by\r\nprivate companies, but all of them were in time acquired by the colonial\r\ngovernment, the last one in 1878. The total capital invested in 1887 was\r\n$125,000,000, which yielded a net revenue of $5,800,000. All lines are\r\nunder the control of a board so constituted as to be entirely removed\r\nfrom political influence.\r\n\r\nIn South Australia a short line was built in 1856 from the city of\r\nAdelaide to Port Adelaide. Another line was constructed in 1857 from\r\nAdelaide to Salisbury, which three years later was extended to Kapunda.\r\nThe colony had then forty miles of road. The increase during the next\r\ndecade was only ninety-three miles. Since then the development has been\r\nmuch more rapid, the whole system of railroads comprising 1,752 miles in\r\n1889. All the roads save a few suburban lines are owned and operated by\r\nthe colony. Their total cost is not far from $60,000,000, and their net\r\nannual revenue is about two and one-half per cent. of the capital\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Queensland has only a system of narrow-gauge roads, with\r\nthe construction of which it commenced in 1865. Up to September, 1887,\r\nthe colonial government had constructed 1,641 miles of road at a total\r\ncost of $47,700,000. The total number of miles has since been increased\r\nto 2,058. The net revenue of the roads was a little over one million\r\ndollars in 1886.\r\n\r\nThe transportation facilities of West Australia are still far behind\r\nthose of her sister colonies. The first line was opened in 1873, and the\r\ntotal number of miles of road operated in the colony in 1889 was only\r\n496. The government controls nearly all the railroads of the colony.\r\n\r\nOf the islands of Australasia, Tasmania and New Zealand are as yet the\r\nonly ones that have railroad communication. The former built its first\r\nroad in 1870 and had at the end of the year 1890 about 1,900 miles in\r\noperation. New Zealand opened its first railroad between Christchurch\r\nand Lyttleton on December 1, 1863. The development of the system was\r\nslow at first, there being but 25 miles of road in operation in 1870. In\r\n1891 the number of miles of road had increased to 1,916, all but 92\r\nmiles being operated by the colonial government. The total amount\r\nexpended by the government for railroads is $55,000,000. The net revenue\r\nin 1887 was about 2-1/2 per cent of the amount invested.\r\n\r\nIn South America railroad building is of comparatively recent date. The\r\nfirst road was built in 1851, but the line was short and remained the\r\nonly one for several years. With thirty million people the South\r\nAmerican states have at present but little more than 16,000 miles of\r\nrailroad, a condition which must at least in part be ascribed to the\r\npeculiar conservatism of the Latin race.\r\n\r\nThe United States of Colombia possesses less than 250 miles of road. Its\r\nfirst line was the Panama Railroad, from Colon to Aspinwall. It connects\r\nthe Pacific with the Atlantic ocean, is 48 miles long and was\r\nconstructed in 1855. This, as well as the several other roads of\r\nColombia, is the property of private companies. A number of new roads\r\nhave recently been surveyed.\r\n\r\nVenezuela opened in 1866 a road, 56 miles long, from Puerto Caballo to\r\nPalito, which in 1870 was extended to Aroa. A number of other short\r\nroads, aggregating about 350 miles, have since been constructed. The\r\ntotal extent of railroad in Venezuela was 432 miles in 1889, of which\r\nthe greater part was operated by private companies. Several important\r\nlines are in the process of construction, and will connect Caracas with\r\nCarabobo, San Carlos and the port of La Guayra.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Ecuador constructed in 1876 a road from Jaguachi to\r\nPuente de Chimbo, a distance of 43 miles. This line was recently\r\nextended to Siambe, and has now a total length of 94 miles. In 1886 a\r\ncharter was granted to a North American company, authorizing the\r\nconstruction of a road from San Lorenzo to Esmeraldas and guaranteeing\r\ncertain dividends on the investment. At the close of the year 1889\r\nEcuador had 167 miles of road.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad in Peru was built in 1851, connecting the seaport\r\nCallao with the capital, Lima. After this but little was done for more\r\nthan twenty years. At the beginning of the seventies an extensive\r\nrailroad system was projected at the instigation of President Don Manuel\r\nPardo, and the construction of the principal road of the system from\r\nMollendo on the Pacific Ocean to Santa Rosa was at once entered upon.\r\nThis road ascends the Western Cordillera, crosses a number of prodigious\r\nmountain passes, reaches Lake Titicaca, and then proceeds in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction to Santa Rosa. It is over 300 miles long, and\r\nreaches near Puna an altitude of 14,700 feet. An extension of this line\r\nfrom Santa Rosa to the old Inca city Cuzco was opened in 1875, but was\r\nsubsequently destroyed in the war with Chile, and has not been reopened.\r\nAnother road, extending from Callao to San Mateo, was opened in 1876. It\r\nis eighty-seven miles long, and reaches with its enormous grades a\r\nheight of over 13,000 feet. It belongs, with the Santa Rosa road, to the\r\nboldest creations of railroad engineering. Since the war with Chile\r\nrailroad enterprise has been checked. The number of miles of road in\r\noperation rose from 962 in 1875 to 1,615 in 1880, but was, owing to the\r\nabandonment of certain lines, diminished to 813 in 1884. Since that time\r\nabout 400 miles of new road have been opened.\r\n\r\nIn the Republic of Bolivia the first railroad was built about twenty\r\nyears ago from Antofogasta to Solar. After the cession of the province\r\nof Antofogasta to Chile there remained but thirty-five miles of road in\r\nBolivia. More than 200 miles have since been added by the construction\r\nof several short roads, chiefly the property of mining companies.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Chile was the first of the South American states to\r\ninitiate the construction of railways. The building of a line from the\r\nseaport Caldera to Copiapo was commenced in May, 1850, and was completed\r\non January 2, 1852. This line was constructed and operated by a private\r\ncompany. The first state road, extending from Valparaiso to Santiago,\r\nwas opened on the 15th of September, 1865. To this road has since been\r\nadded an extension to Talcahuana, as well as several branch lines. The\r\ntotal amount that has been expended by the Chilean government for the\r\nconstruction of railroads is $43,000,000. The total number of miles of\r\nroad operated in Chile in 1887 was 1,674, of which 992 were the property\r\nof private companies and 682 miles were owned by the state. Two hundred\r\nand fifty miles of road have since been constructed, and the\r\nconstruction of 700 additional miles of railroad has been authorized by\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic opened its first road, extending from Buenos\r\nAyres to Belgrano, in December, 1862. Several other lines soon\r\nfollowed, and in 1870 over 600 miles of road had been constructed. This\r\nnumber had increased to 1,440 in 1880 and to 5,100 in 1889. Since then\r\nseveral new lines have been completed, aggregating over 600 miles. Among\r\nthe principal lines of the Argentine Republic is the transcontinental\r\nroad which connects the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean. The whole line\r\nis 880 miles long, of which 665 miles are in the Argentine Republic and\r\nthe remaining 115 miles in Chile. Of the 3,705 miles of road which were\r\nin operation at the beginning of the year 1887 the republic owned 1,148,\r\nthe province of Buenos Ayres 572, the province of Santa Fe 102, and\r\nprivate companies 1,888 miles. The total amount invested in railroads\r\nwas $154,000,000 in 1887, which yielded an average dividend of 3.9 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe oldest railroad in Brazil is the Petropolis road. It was built by a\r\nprivate company and opened on December 16, 1856. In 1881 the total\r\nnumber of miles in operation was 2,422, and in 1889 it had increased to\r\n5,766. Furthermore charters had been granted for the additional\r\nconstruction of 2,271 miles of road. Of the lines in operation about\r\n1,200 miles are the property of the state, yielding a revenue of nearly\r\n3 per cent. on the capital invested. The state gives aid, besides, to\r\nseveral private roads. The most important road of Brazil is the state\r\nroad Dom Pedro I., which connects the three richest provinces of the\r\ncountry, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerals and Sao Paolo, with the national\r\ncapital. It was opened in 1883, and has a total extent of 544 miles.\r\n\r\nThe principal roads of Uruguay were built between 1865 and 1875. In the\r\nlatter year the total number of miles in operation in Uruguay was 190,\r\nwhich in 1880 had increased to 230, and in 1889 to 469 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining political divisions of South America the railroad\r\nextended its dominion still more slowly. Paraguay opened as early as\r\n1863 a line 45 miles long from Asuncion to Itangua, and in 1892 her\r\nrailroad system had increased to 159 miles in extent. British Guiana\r\ncompleted in 1866 a line from Georgetown to New Amsterdam, but not one\r\nmile of railroad has been built in that colony since. Of the islands of\r\nSouth America Trinidad is the only one into which the railroad has been\r\nintroduced. The island has at present 50 miles of road, to 16 in 1878.\r\n\r\nCentral America has less than 600 miles of railway. The causes which\r\nhave retarded the development of the railroad system in South America\r\nare also operative here. Of the five republics of Central America Costa\r\nRica has the largest number of miles of railroad, viz.: 161. It has\r\nthree different lines, of which the Limon and Carillo line, seventy\r\nmiles long, is the most important. This road, which connects with a New\r\nYork line of steamers at Limon, has greatly furthered the cultivation of\r\nbananas in the Santa Clara valley.\r\n\r\nNicaragua completed its first road in 1880 between Corinto and\r\nChinandega, and has at present about 100 miles of railway in operation.\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal Company is constructing a road from Juan del Norte\r\nto Ochoa, a distance of thirty-two miles, to be used in the construction\r\nof the canal.\r\n\r\nHonduras opened in 1871 its only line, thirty-seven miles long, between\r\nPuerto Caballo and San Jago. In recent years an extension of nine miles\r\nhas been added to it.\r\n\r\nSan Salvador has, besides a street-car line between the cities of San\r\nSalvador and Santa Tecla, only one line of railroad between Acajutla\r\nand Armea, which was constructed with public funds and opened for\r\ntraffic on July 15, 1882.\r\n\r\nGuatemala was the last of the Central American States to introduce the\r\nrailroad. Its first road, seventy-four miles long, and extending from\r\nSan Jose on the Pacific Ocean to the capital, Guatemala, was built by a\r\nSan Francisco company and opened on August 20, 1884. The state has at\r\nthe present time about 100 miles of road, with several short but quite\r\nimportant lines under construction.\r\n\r\nThe West Indies have between 1,200 and 1,400 miles of railway, of which\r\nmore than 1,000 are in Cuba. The first road upon this island, 179 miles\r\nlong and extending from Habana to Guanajay, was opened as early as 1837.\r\nThe next ten years developed almost the whole of the railroad system of\r\nthe western half of Cuba. A number of important roads have since been\r\nopened in the central and eastern portions of the island, whose railroad\r\nmileage is at present larger per capita than that of any other political\r\ndivision of the Western Hemisphere save that of Canada and the United\r\nStates. The second of the West India islands to construct a railroad was\r\nJamaica. A line connecting Kingston and Spanishtown was opened on the\r\n21st of November, 1845. Two branch lines have since been added, making\r\nthe total number of miles of road on this island seventy-six at the\r\npresent time. About twenty-five miles more are now in the process of\r\nconstruction. San Domingo and Hayti have also recently commenced to\r\nbuild railroads. In the former republic a line from Sanchez to LaVega,\r\nsixty-two and one-half miles long, is now open to traffic, and Hayti is\r\nconstructing a line from Gonaives, on the western coast, to Porte de\r\nPaix, on the eastern coast of the island. The Spanish government in\r\n1888 also granted a charter for the construction of a railroad on the\r\nisland of Porto Rica.\r\n\r\nOf our neighbors on the North American continent, Mexico and Canada, the\r\nformer has been by far the slower to avail herself of the advantages of\r\nrailroad communication. The slow growth of the railroad system of Mexico\r\nmust be ascribed chiefly to the frequent political disturbances of the\r\ncountry as well as to the many topographical obstacles which presented\r\nthemselves to the railroad engineer. The first Mexican railway,\r\nexcepting tramways, was the one which connects the capital with the city\r\nof Vera Cruz. It was constructed by an English company and was opened on\r\nthe first day of January, 1873. In 1875 the total number of miles of\r\nroad in Mexico was 327, and five years later somewhat less than 700.\r\nSince then the development of the system has been much more rapid. In\r\n1880 several companies were formed for the purpose of building a system\r\nof roads which would connect the Mexican capital with the United States\r\nas well as with the most important harbors of the gulfs of Mexico and\r\nCalifornia. The projectors of these lines, who were citizens of the\r\nUnited States, received the hearty coöperation of the Mexican\r\ngovernment, and the work was at once pushed very vigorously. At the end\r\nof the year 1885 more than 2,500 miles of new road were open for\r\ntraffic, and a thousand miles more at the end of the following year. In\r\n1889 Mexico had 5,332 miles of road. The principal one of the newly\r\nconstructed roads is the Mexican Central, which connects Paso del Norte\r\nwith the City of Mexico. This line will also, when its branches are\r\ncompleted, form a through route between the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nPacific Ocean. Another scarcely less important through line north and\r\nsouth is the National Mexican Railway, which is 722 miles long and\r\nconnects Laredo, on the Rio Grande, with the capital and the southern\r\nstates. Another line has recently been opened from Torreon to Durango.\r\nThe number of miles of road at present in operation in the Republic of\r\nMexico is about 6,800, with a number of new lines rapidly nearing\r\ncompletion. The development of Mexico's resources has, during the past\r\ndecade, kept pace with the rapid expansion of its railroad system.\r\n\r\nIn the Dominion of Canada about fifteen miles of railroad line were\r\nbuilt as early as 1837, but only forty-three miles was added during the\r\nnext ten years. In 1852 there was still only 212 miles of railroad in\r\nall of the British possessions in North America. At that time the\r\nconstruction of the Grand Trunk system was commenced, the first section\r\nof the system, Portland-Montreal, being opened in 1853. After this\r\nrailroads increased very rapidly in Canada, reaching an extent of 2,087\r\nmiles in 1860, 4,826 miles in 1875, 6,891 miles in 1880, and 10,150\r\nmiles in 1890. The majority of Canadian railroads are in the hands of\r\nprivate companies, some of which have been very materially aided by the\r\ngovernment. One of the conditions upon which the union of the several\r\nBritish provinces, except Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, was\r\neffected in 1867, was the construction of a railroad by the Dominion\r\ngovernment connecting the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick. This road, the main line of which extends from Point\r\nLevis, opposite Quebec, to Halifax, was accordingly built, and is still\r\noperated by the Canadian government. Its cost was about 46,000,000.\r\n\r\nBut the most important enterprise in which the government is interested\r\nis the Canadian Pacific Railway. Like the intercolonial railway, this\r\nline was a result of the political union of the colonies. Its\r\nconstruction was commenced by the government, but was subsequently\r\nassigned to a private corporation, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company,\r\nall that had been done by the government being turned over to the\r\ncompany as a gift. It is estimated that the direct gifts of money, the\r\nland grant and other privileges conferred by the Dominion government\r\nupon the Pacific Railway Company exceed $100,000,000 in value, and that,\r\nwith the amount of bonds and stock guaranteed by the government, the par\r\nvalue of its various aids amounts to $215,000,000, or $48,000,000 more\r\nthan the cost of the road, as will be shown by the following table,\r\ntaken from the report of the Interstate Commerce Committee of the Senate\r\nof the Fifty-first Congress:\r\n\r\n  Subsidy granted by the act of Parliament of\r\n    February 13, 1881                                 $25,000,000\r\n  Seven hundred and fourteen miles of railroad\r\n    constructed by the Dominion Government, original\r\n    cost and interest                                  36,760,785\r\n  Capital stock guaranteed                             65,000,000\r\n  Loan to the company authorized by Parliament of\r\n    1884, in part                                      29,880,912\r\n  Balance of above loan                                15,000 000\r\n  Bonds, interest guaranteed by the Dominion for\r\n    50 years at 3-1/2 per cent                         15,000,000\r\n  Land grant bonds                                     25,000,000\r\n  Subsidy of $186,000 a year, for 20 years              3,720,000\r\n                                                     ------------\r\n  Total                                              $215,361,697\r\n\r\n  Total cost of road, according to the company's\r\n    balance sheet of December, 1888                  $131,350,019\r\n\r\nThe Dominion Government owns and operates four railways, the cost of\r\nwhich up to June 30, 1890, was $52,800,000. It has also granted to\r\nrailroad companies cash subsidies which to June 30, 1889, amounted to\r\nover $46,000,000. The total number of miles of railroad in Canada was\r\n14,004 in 1890. The people of Canada have, since the political union of\r\nthe colonies, pursued an exceedingly liberal policy toward their\r\nrailroads, but it appears that the great indulgence of the government\r\nonly bred license in railroad circles. The evil increased from year to\r\nyear, until the many complaints on the part of the public against\r\nrailroad management caused Parliament in 1886 to appoint a commission to\r\nexamine into the alleged abuses and to report as to the advisability of\r\nthe adoption of a general railroad law, and the appointment of a Board\r\nof Railroad Commissioners. The committee reported to the\r\nGovernor-General of Canada on the 14th of January, 1888, and, acting\r\nupon its recommendation, Parliament passed the Railway Act of May 22,\r\n1888. This act, containing 309 paragraphs, provides for the complete\r\nregulation of railroad affairs, and for this purpose creates a Board of\r\nRailroad Commissioners, consisting of the Minister for Railroads and\r\nCanals, the Minister of Justice and two or more members of the Privy\r\nCouncil. The act also repeals all former railroad laws. Though it has\r\nbeen in force less than five years, its beneficial effects are already\r\nextensively felt by the Canadian public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF RAILROADS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world has the growth of railroads been so rapid as\r\nin the United States. With a population less than one-fifth as large as\r\nthat of Europe this country has a larger number of miles of railroad\r\nthan that continent. While European countries generally opposed the\r\nintroduction of the new system of transportation, our people extended to\r\nit a hearty welcome. This difference of sentiment can easily be\r\naccounted for. At the time of the invention of railroads Europe had a\r\nsystem of turnpikes and canals which, at least for the time being,\r\nanswered every purpose. It became necessary for the railroads to enter\r\ninto competition with these well-established agencies of transportation,\r\nwhich had the test of time, popular prejudice and governmental sanction\r\nin their favor. Moreover, the railroad as a new and unknown quantity\r\ncaused a feeling of uneasiness in all conservative circles. It seemed to\r\nmake war against time-honored principles of statecraft and society, and\r\nthreatened to bring about a revolution the outcome of which no one could\r\nforesee.\r\n\r\nThe condition of things was entirely different in the United States.\r\nThere were but few good roads and still fewer turnpikes and canals. A\r\nvast territory in the interior awaited cultivation. Excepting the coast\r\nand a few cities situated on the large navigable rivers, the East and\r\nthe West and the North and the South were practically without commercial\r\nrelations, and were only held together by a community of political\r\ntraditions and the artificial cement of a common constitution. Even had\r\nthe country had a system of turnpikes and canals, the Mississippi River\r\nwould still have been a forty days', and the extreme Northwest a three\r\nmonths' journey distant from New York. It seems extremely doubtful\r\nwhether the different sections of so large a realm, having so little\r\ncommunity of commercial interests, could long be kept together under a\r\nrepublican system of government. The settlement of the central portion\r\nof the country and the development of its resources seemed to be the\r\ntask of future centuries. The railroad under these circumstances made\r\nits appearance at a most opportune time for America, and the American\r\npeople were not slow to make the best of the opportunities presented to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as in England, the railroad was preceded by the\r\ntram-road. The first tram-road in this country was opened in 1826. It\r\nconnected the granite quarries of Quincy with the Neponset River, and\r\nwas operated by horsepower. The second road of this kind was the Mauch\r\nChunk tramway, in Pennsylvania, opened in 1826, for the transportation\r\nof coal. The trains were drawn up an inclined plane by stationary\r\nengines and were moved down by their own weight. During the same year\r\nthe Delaware and Hudson Canal Company opened the Carbondale and\r\nHomesdale tramway, connecting their mines with the Delaware and Hudson\r\nCanal. It appears that an English locomotive was imported for use on\r\nthis line in 1828, but that it did not answer its purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year was commenced the construction of the first line of\r\nimportance in this country, the Baltimore and Ohio. The line was opened\r\nfor traffic in 1830, having then an extent of fourteen miles. In 1831 it\r\nwas extended sixty-one miles, and the year following sixty-seven miles.\r\nFor a year the road was operated by horsepower, but in 1831 the company\r\npurchased for its road an American locomotive.\r\n\r\nThe first road upon which a locomotive engine of American manufacture\r\nwas used was the South Carolina Railroad, which was commenced in 1830.\r\nThe engine was manufactured at West Point and was placed upon the road\r\nin December of the same year. The line had then an extent of ten miles.\r\nIn 1832 it had increased to sixty-two miles, and in 1833 to 136 miles.\r\nThe construction of the Mohawk and Hudson was commenced in August, 1830,\r\nand the road was opened in September of the following year. Its first\r\nlocomotive engine was also imported from England, but, being found too\r\nheavy, was soon replaced by an American engine of half its weight. In\r\n1831 two other New York roads were commenced, the Saratoga and the New\r\nYork and Harlem. A small portion of the latter was opened during the\r\nsame year, and the former in July, 1832. The Camden and Amboy Railroad\r\nin New Jersey was likewise commenced in 1831, but its completion was not\r\nreached till 1834. The New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad was completed\r\nin 1832, the Philadelphia and Trenton in 1833, and the New Jersey in\r\n1834. In 1835 the Washington branch of the Baltimore and Ohio was\r\nopened, and the entire line had at the end of that year attained an\r\nextent of 115 miles. During the same year three Massachusetts roads,\r\nconnecting Boston with Providence, Worcester and Lowell respectively,\r\nwere opened. In 1836 the New York Central route was opened to Utica. In\r\n1837 the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad was completed\r\nfrom Richmond to Fredericksburg. In 1838 the Richmond and Petersburg and\r\nthe Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore railroads were opened. The\r\nWilmington and Weldon Railroad was completed in 1840, and the Petersburg\r\nand Roanoke three years later. There was now a continuous line of\r\nrailway from the Potomac to Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1842 the\r\nwhole line of the Boston and Albany road was completed, which thus\r\nbecame the first important through route in America.\r\n\r\nThe construction of railroads in the United States was from the first\r\ncarried on without a system. Railroads in an early day were purely local\r\naffairs. Each locality operated its own road in its own interest and\r\nwithout any supervision from the State which had granted its charter.\r\nActs of incorporation or charters were granted as a matter of course.\r\nRailroads were looked upon as the natural feeders of canals, and their\r\nfuture importance was foreseen by very few men. The early roads were a\r\nheavy burden on the capital of the country. A number of small roads were\r\nbuilt that proved unprofitable and had to be abandoned. After the\r\nfinancial panic of 1837 there was, except in New England, a very\r\nperceptible stagnation in railroad enterprise, which lasted until the\r\ndiscovery of gold in California, in 1848. The average number of miles of\r\nroad constructed per annum during the ten years preceding 1848 was 380,\r\nwhile it was nearly 1,800 per annum during the seven years following.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that with the discovery of gold in the West ends the\r\nfirst or formative period of railroad construction. From the first\r\nopening of the Baltimore and Ohio to the beginning of the year 1848, a\r\nperiod of eighteen years, there were constructed in the United States\r\n5,205 miles of railroad, or an average of 289 miles per annum. The\r\ndiscovery of gold on the Pacific gave a new impetus to railroad\r\nconstruction throughout the country. Railroads now ceased to be local\r\nworks and became interstate or national thoroughfares. Extensive new\r\nlines were built and through routes were formed by the coalition of\r\nlocal roads. It was during this period that railroad companies first\r\nbecame conscious of the importance of their mission and that they\r\ncommenced to compete with river and canal carriers. In 1848 a through\r\nroute was completed between Cincinnati and Lake Erie. A more direct\r\nline, the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati road, was opened in 1851.\r\nDuring the same year the Erie Railroad reached Lake Erie and connected\r\nthe lake with the Hudson, and a year later Chicago received railroad\r\nconnection with the East by the completion of the Michigan Central and\r\nMichigan Southern. In 1854 the Chicago and Rock Island reached the\r\nMississippi River, and in 1855 the Chicago and Galena was opened. One\r\nyear later the Illinois Central reached the Mississippi at Cairo, and\r\nthe Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was opened to Quincy. The\r\nOhio and Mississippi, between Cincinnati and St. Louis, was completed at\r\nabout the same time. The Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago, an\r\nextension of the Pennsylvania road, was completed to Chicago in 1858. At\r\nthe beginning of 1859 the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad reached the\r\nMissouri River, and eight years later the Cedar Rapids and Missouri was\r\ncompleted to the Missouri at Council Bluffs.\r\n\r\nTo encourage the extension of railroads into new and thinly settled\r\nterritories, and to thus hasten their settlement and the development of\r\ntheir resources, the people of the United States began at the\r\ncommencement of this period to favor the policy of land grants. Such\r\ngrants had repeatedly been made to roads and canals prior to the crisis\r\nof 1837. The first railroad that received a land grant was the Illinois\r\nCentral. The scheme was proposed as early as 1836, but the act making\r\nthe grant was not passed until September 20, 1850. Other grants followed\r\nin 1852 in Missouri, in 1853 in Arkansas, in 1856 in Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Iowa, Florida and Louisiana. As a rule these lands were\r\ngranted by the National Government to the States, and by them to the\r\nrailroads. The land grants made during President Fillmore's\r\nadministration amounted to eight million, and those made during Pierce's\r\nadministration to nineteen million acres. The financial crisis of 1857\r\nand the War of the Rebellion again checked railroad building, but this\r\nperiod developed a new phase of railroad enterprise as well as of the\r\nland grant policy. In those times of national trial a railroad to the\r\nPacific Coast seemed a political necessity. The project of connecting\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a line of railroads was first brought\r\nprominently before the American people by Asa Whitney of New York. At a\r\nmeeting held under his auspices in Philadelphia on the 23d day of\r\nDecember, 1846, a movement was inaugurated for the purpose of\r\ninteresting the people in this enterprise and securing the aid of the\r\ngovernment for its accomplishment. Various plans were urged, and earnest\r\ndiscussions followed, in which the ablest minds of the nation\r\nparticipated. The continual agitation of the subject finally led, on the\r\n1st of July, 1862, to the passage by Congress of an act incorporating\r\nthe Union Pacific Railway Company and the adoption of the central route.\r\nThe Union and the Central Pacific companies received a virtual money\r\nsubsidy of $30,000,000 and a land grant aggregating nearly twenty-three\r\nmillion acres, a domain almost equal to the State of Indiana. Other\r\ndirect grants of territorial lands soon followed. The Northern Pacific\r\nreceived, just before the close of the war, a grant of forty-seven\r\nmillion acres of land. In the Southwest public lands were also freely\r\ngiven to new Pacific lines. The various grants made to railroads\r\ncomprise no less than 300,000 square miles, equal to four and a half\r\ntimes the area of New England, or six times that of the State of New\r\nYork, or equal to the total area of Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nMichigan and Ohio. Where these grants were not deemed sufficient\r\ninducement for the construction of roads, counties, cities and towns\r\nfreely voted subsidies, while private citizens made donations to or\r\nsubscribed for the securities of the new railroads.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the consolidation of connecting lines and\r\ntheir transformation into a few large through routes was one of the\r\ncharacteristic features of this period. As through traffic, and\r\nparticularly through freight, grew in importance, it became more and\r\nmore apparent that frequent transhipment was an expense to the railroads\r\nas well as a burden to the public. The system of railroad ownership and\r\nmanagement soon adapted itself to the necessities of business. The\r\nchange seems to have been inevitable, for it occurred in all parts of\r\nthe world at about the same time. Sagacious men early recognized the\r\nimportance of railroads as national lines of communication. This idea no\r\ndoubt controlled the projectors of the Baltimore and Ohio, of the Erie,\r\nand of the Boston and Albany roads. The first consolidation of any\r\nimportance took place in 1853, when eleven different roads between\r\nAlbany and Buffalo were united to form the New York Central. Five branch\r\nroads were added to the system between 1855 and 1858. In 1864 Cornelius\r\nVanderbilt secured control of the Hudson River road, and in 1867 of the\r\nNew York Central, which lines he consolidated in 1869. By gaining soon\r\nafterward control of the Lake Shore and Michigan Central and Southern\r\nCanadian roads, he united under one management over 4,000 miles of\r\nrailroad between New York and Chicago, and thus created the first\r\nthrough line between the East and the West.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the Pennsylvania road gained control of the\r\nPittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago in 1858 and thus extended its system\r\nas far as Chicago. Through the absorption of other lines it reached an\r\nextent of over 7,000 miles. The creation of this through route was\r\nchiefly the work of Thomas A. Scott, at that time vice-president, and\r\nlater president, of the Pennsylvania railroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the Baltimore and Ohio, under the management of John W. Garrett,\r\nextended its system to Chicago, and became a competitor of the two older\r\nlines in the transportation of through freight. At about the same time\r\ntwo other parallel trunk lines were developed, the Grand Trunk on the\r\nnorth, and the Erie, between the Lake Shore and Pennsylvania lines.\r\nThere were, therefore, in 1874 five rival trunk lines competing for the\r\nbusiness between the West and the seaboard.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period large rival lines developed west of Chicago and\r\nSt. Louis. From the former city radiate the St. Paul and Northwestern\r\nsystems, each with from 6,000 to 8,000 miles; the Atchison, Topeka and\r\nSanta Fe with over 9,000 miles; then the Rock Island, the Chicago,\r\nBurlington and Quincy, the Illinois Central, the Chicago Great-Western,\r\nand the Chicago and Alton, their systems ranging from 1,000 to 6,000\r\nmiles in extent. From St. Louis radiate the various branches of the\r\nMissouri Pacific and the closely allied Wabash system, controlling\r\ntogether some 10,000 miles of road.\r\n\r\nThis process of consolidation also went on in the Southern States,\r\nthough to a less extent. Their systems do not run parallel, like the\r\ntrunk lines, nor do they radiate from a common center, like the roads of\r\nthe Northwest, but they radiate from the principal ports of the Atlantic\r\nand the Gulf of Mexico toward the interior.\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the third period of the history of American railroads,\r\nthe period of combinations. During the time of great activity in\r\nrailroad construction following the War of the Rebellion many abuses in\r\nrailroad management had been developed, which caused general complaint\r\nand led to what is known as the Granger movement. Laws were demanded,\r\nespecially in the agricultural States of the West, which should regulate\r\nthe rates, methods of operation, and the political relations of the\r\nrailroads. The friends of this movement were successful in the political\r\ncontests that followed, and Granger legislatures were elected in the\r\nStates of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. Laws were passed\r\nfixing the rates on different classes of roads and providing penalties\r\nfor their violation. The companies contested these acts in the courts,\r\nbut were defeated at every step, until in 1877 the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States sustained the constitutionality of the Granger laws. In\r\nthe meantime railroad managers tried their utmost to render, by shrewd\r\nmanipulation, these laws obnoxious, and they finally succeeded in having\r\nthem repealed or so amended as to render them largely ineffectual.\r\n\r\nIt was the principal object of the Granger movement to do away with the\r\nmany discriminating tariffs which so injuriously affected local points.\r\nIt is true, discriminations between individuals were practiced at\r\nbusiness centers, but rates upon the whole were low at such points as\r\ncompared with those which obtained at local stations. While the Granger\r\ncontest was still going on in the West, a new evil developed in the\r\nEast, which became characteristic of the period and finally grew into\r\none of the most intolerable abuses of railroad management. Railroad men\r\nhad gradually learned that it was in their power to maintain high rates\r\nat competitive as well as at non-competitive points, provided all the\r\nroads centering at such points could be induced to coöperate, or rather\r\nto conspire for that purpose. The final solution of the problem was,\r\nafter some experimentation, found in the device to control the prices of\r\ntransportation generally known as the pool. It is doubtful whether any\r\ncontrivance connected with railroad management ever threatened to\r\nsubvert long-established principles of the common law more completely\r\nthan this. Within a few years it extended its dominion over the whole\r\ncountry, exacting a heavy tribute from its commerce, until the people's\r\npatience finally became exhausted and their determined demand for\r\nrailroad reform led to the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act in\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nWhen this act passed, dire results were predicted by nearly every\r\nrailroad man in the country. Prophecies were freely made that it would\r\nruin half of the roads and seriously cripple and sadly interfere with\r\nthe usefulness of the other half, that it would derange the business of\r\nthe country, greatly depreciate all railroad securities and put an end\r\nto railroad construction. Nearly seven years have passed since the\r\nadoption of the law, but not one of these prophecies has come to pass.\r\nThere are at present probably less bankrupt roads in the United States\r\nthan there have been at any time for twenty years, our business\r\ninterests have been improved, the securities of honestly managed roads\r\nare in better repute than they were previous to the passage of the law,\r\nand the railroad mileage of the country is increasing at the rate of\r\nabout 6,000 miles a year. If any branch of business has suffered in\r\nconsequence of the enactment of the law, it is the branch monopolized by\r\nWall Street. Since 1885, the time when the Interstate Commerce Bill was\r\nfirst seriously agitated, the aggregate of railroad securities has\r\nincreased nearly $2,500,000,000, or about one-third. This certainly does\r\nnot look as if capital had been seriously frightened by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act. There are other proofs of railroad prosperity. In 1885 the\r\ngross earnings of the railroads of the United States were $772,568,833,\r\nor 9.9 per cent. on their reported capital. In 1886 their gross earnings\r\nwere $829,940,836, or 10.2 per cent. on the reported railroad capital.\r\nIn 1890 the gross earnings had increased to $1,097,847,428, and equaled\r\n10.8 per cent. on the reported capital. This includes even the\r\ncapitalization of new lines and others not reporting operations. Mr.\r\nPoor gives the reported cost of the lines actually operated as\r\n$8,519,670,421, against $10,122,635,900 reported cost of all the\r\nrailroads built. Omitting from the computation the lines not reporting\r\noperations, the gross earnings of the roads actually operated equaled\r\n12.7 per cent. and their net earnings 4 per cent. on the actual cost of\r\nthe lines which reported. The gross earnings for 1891 were\r\n$1,138,024,459, and for the year ending June 30, 1892, $1,222,711,698.\r\n\r\nThe gross earnings per mile have increased from $6,265 in 1885, and\r\n$6,570 in 1886, to $6,946 in 1890, and $7,409 in 1892. In 1885 the\r\ncapitalization per mile of road was $55,059 and the net earnings per\r\nmile were $2,185. In 1890 the capitalization per mile had decreased to\r\n$53,783, while the net earnings per mile increased to $2,195. The\r\nrailroad mileage of the country has grown from 128,361 in 1885 to\r\n166,817 in 1890, to 170,601 in 1891, and to 175,000 in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe railroad system of the United States has had a phenomenal growth,\r\nespecially since 1870, since which time nearly 120,000 miles of road, or\r\nmore than two-thirds of the total mileage, have been constructed. The\r\ntable below shows the number of miles of railroad constructed and in\r\noperation, by quinquennial periods from 1830 to the close of 1890,\r\ninclusive:\r\n\r\n  YEAR.

During the former period\r\nrailroad construction was partially checked by the War of the Rebellion,\r\nduring the latter by the general financial depression following the\r\npanic of 1873.\r\n\r\nThe length of railroads in the world has grown from 206 miles in 1830 to\r\nabout 400,000 miles in 1892. The following table shows the growth of\r\nrailroad mileage by quinquennial periods:\r\n\r\n  YEAR.

There is no doubt that\r\nthe extent of railroad construction has everywhere exceeded all\r\nanticipations. So fast has the railroad system expanded in the most\r\nhighly civilized countries that it soon outgrew in nearly all of them\r\nthe laws originally adopted for railroad control. In time an almost\r\nuniversal demand arose for reform, and the most progressive governments\r\nwere not slow in heeding it. For the past fifteen years there has been a\r\ndecided drift on the European continent toward state ownership of\r\nrailroads, or to such strict control of the transportation business as\r\nvirtually deprives the operating companies of the power to do injustice\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nThe railroad is assuming more and more the character of an international\r\nhighway. A movement is on foot to connect the railroad systems of the\r\nUnited States with those of South America by an intercontinental or\r\n\"Pan-American\" railroad. Appropriations have been made by the United\r\nStates and several of the South American republics for a preliminary\r\nsurvey of the proposed line. Three different surveying parties are in\r\nthe field, one in Central America and the other two in the United States\r\nof Colombia and Ecuador. The progress so far reported by them is\r\nencouraging, and there is now some hope that before the close of the\r\nnineteenth century one may be able to travel by railroad from New York\r\nto Valparaiso without even a change of cars.\r\n\r\nIt has also been proposed to span Behring Strait and connect North\r\nAmerica with Asia and Europe by an international railway. This line, if\r\nconstructed, would be simply an extension of the proposed Pan-American\r\nrailroad and would follow the western coast of the United States as far\r\nas Behring Strait, then cross over into Asia, traverse Siberia and\r\nfinally reach London via St. Petersburg, Berlin and Paris. It is very\r\nquestionable whether such a line is at present feasible either from a\r\ntechnical or financial point of view, but the time will probably come\r\nwhen the railroad track will connect New York and London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLY IN TRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial efforts have been made by designing men to control\r\neither commerce or its avenues, the highways on the land and on the sea,\r\nby a power which law, custom, ingenuity, artifice or some other agency\r\nhad placed into their hands.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Phoenicians early aimed at and finally obtained the empire\r\nof the sea by making themselves masters of the most commodious harbors\r\nof the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Gulf. They established a\r\nregular intercourse with the countries bordering on the Mediterranean as\r\nwell as with India and the eastern coast of Africa. From these latter\r\ncountries they imported many valuable commodities which were not known\r\nto the people of other parts of the world, and during a long period they\r\nheld this lucrative branch of commerce without a rival. The character\r\nand the situation of the Phoenicians aided them greatly in acquiring\r\nthis mastery of commerce. Neither their manners and customs nor their\r\ninstitutions showed any marked national peculiarity; they had no\r\nunsocial prejudices and they mingled with the people of other countries\r\nwithout the least scruple or repugnance. As their native country was\r\nsmall and quite barren, they early learned to rely upon commerce as the\r\nbest source of riches and power. Like the other Semitic tribes, the\r\nPhoenicians were noted for their energy and acumen, and while they\r\nwere not a literary people in the strict sense of the word, ancient\r\ncivilization received probably a more powerful impetus through their\r\ncommercial supremacy than through any other agency.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King Solomon the Jews made an attempt to wrest from\r\nthe Phoenicians at least a part of the world's trade. Solomon built\r\nships and imported Phoenician sailors for his fleet. For a time it\r\nseemed as if the Israelites might become the rivals of their teachers in\r\nthe art of navigation and in the mysteries of trade; but their peculiar\r\nreligious customs in that early day proved a serious impediment to\r\ncommercial ascendancy, as it rendered them incapable of that unreserved\r\nintercourse with strangers so essential in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly of the sea, at least of the Mediterranean, passed to the\r\nCarthaginians, their descendants. The latter extended their navigation\r\ntoward the west and north. They planted colonies and opened new harbors,\r\nand up to the time of the Punic wars kept almost the entire trade of the\r\ncountries bordering on the Mediterranean in their hands.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Carthage the control of the commerce of Southern\r\nEurope and Northern Africa descended to the Romans. When Rome became the\r\ncapital of the world, it gathered the wealth and valuable productions of\r\nall its provinces. Under the consuls and the earlier emperors the\r\nvigilance of the Roman magistrates and the spirit of the Roman\r\ngovernment gave every possible security to commerce and prevented for a\r\ntime the rise of monopoly. Nowhere was national union so complete or\r\ncommercial intercourse so perfect as in the Roman empire. The\r\nintelligence and the power of Rome stimulated and regulated the industry\r\nof her people and permitted them to enjoy the fruits of their efforts\r\nwithout public or private restrictions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the intercourse of Rome and her provinces was\r\nfacilitated by the construction of roads and the establishment of\r\nimperial posts. During the decline of the empire the maintenance of\r\nthese posts led, however, to a grave abuse. We are informed by Gibbon in\r\nhis \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\":\r\n\r\n\"But these beneficial establishments were accidentally connected with a\r\npernicious and intolerable abuse. Two or three hundred agents or\r\nmessengers were employed, under the jurisdiction of the master of the\r\noffices, to announce the names of the annual consuls and the edicts or\r\nvictories of the emperors. They insensibly assumed the license of\r\nreporting whatever they could observe of the conduct either of the\r\nmagistrates or private citizens, and were soon considered as the eyes of\r\nthe monarch and the scourge of the people. Under the warm influence of a\r\nfeeble reign they multiplied to the incredible number of ten thousand,\r\ndisdained the mild though frequent admonitions of the laws, and\r\nexercised in the profitable management of the posts a rapacious and\r\ninsolent oppression. These official spies, who regularly corresponded\r\nwith the palace, were encouraged by favor and reward anxiously to watch\r\nthe progress of every treasonable design, from the faint and latent\r\nsymptoms of disaffection to the actual preparation of an open revolt.\r\nTheir careless or criminal violation of truth was covered by the\r\nconsecrated mask of zeal; and they might securely aim their poisoned\r\narrows at the breast either of the guilty or the innocent, who had\r\nprovoked their resentment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of the Romans, commerce remained paralyzed during the\r\nperiod of Gothic ignorance and barbarism. The crusades for the recovery\r\nof the Holy Land from the Saracens, in the eleventh and following\r\ncenturies, opened again communication between the east and the west by\r\nleading multitudes from every European country into Asia; and though the\r\nobject of these expeditions was conquest, and not commerce, their\r\ncommercial effects were both beneficial and permanent. The crusades were\r\nespecially favorable to the commercial pursuits of the Italian states.\r\nThe vast armies which marched from all parts of Europe toward Asia gave\r\nencouragement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, which\r\nsometimes transported them, and always supplied them with provisions and\r\nmilitary stores. Besides the immense sums which these states received on\r\nthis account, they obtained commercial privileges of great consequence\r\nin the settlements which the crusaders made in the East. All the\r\ncommodities which they imported or exported were exempted from every\r\nimposition, the property of entire suburbs in some of the maritime\r\ntowns, and of large streets in others, was vested in them, and all\r\nquestions arising among persons residing within their precincts, or who\r\ntraded under their protection, were decided by their own laws and by\r\njudges of their own appointment. When the crusaders took Constantinople,\r\nthe Venetians did not neglect to secure to themselves many advantages\r\nfrom that event. Nearly all the branches of commerce were in time\r\ntransferred from Constantinople to their city. At the end of the crusade\r\nperiod Venice had monopolized nearly all the foreign trade of Europe.\r\nShe supplied the people of Italy, France and Germany with those\r\ncommodities with which the crusaders by their intercourse with more\r\nrefined nations had become acquainted. The possession of many Eastern\r\nports and the maintenance of a powerful navy made it possible for the\r\nVenetians to retain their monopoly for several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe growth of commerce in Central Europe was but slow, owing to the\r\ndangers to which it was exposed in those days of feudalism. The mountain\r\nfastnesses of robber knights, which controlled every road and navigable\r\nriver, were so many toll-gates at which the wayfaring merchant was\r\nstopped to pay tribute. In time this system of plunder grew to such an\r\nextent that hundreds of feudal lords relied upon it for their support.\r\nSuch a tax upon commerce greatly enhanced the value of all commodities,\r\nand this deplorable state of things lasted until the cities made their\r\npower felt by forming alliances for mutual protection. One of these\r\nalliances, the Rhenish League, comprised in time seventy towns, and the\r\nruins of the strong castles destroyed by its forces still exist along\r\nthe Rhine, picturesque memorials of these lawless times.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most powerful commercial union of the middle ages was the\r\nHanseatic League. To protect their commerce, the cities of Hamburg and\r\nLubeck formed about the middle of the thirteenth century an alliance for\r\nmutual defense. The advantages derived from this union attracted other\r\ntowns to the confederacy. In a short time about eighty of the largest\r\ncities lying between the Baltic and the Rhine joined this famous league,\r\nwhich in time became so formidable that its alliance was courted and its\r\nenmity was dreaded by the greatest monarchs. The League divided its\r\nterritory into several districts. Its members, like railway associations\r\nof the present day, made their own laws, and met for this purpose at\r\nregular intervals in the city of Lubeck. The original object of the\r\nLeague, mutual assistance against outside attacks, was soon lost sight\r\nof, and its constantly growing power was used to obtain still greater\r\ncommercial privileges in the adjoining countries, and even to force\r\ntheir rulers to concede to its members a commercial monopoly. In 1361 a\r\ncontroversy arose between the League and the King of Denmark, which led\r\nto a long and bitter war between them. This war was participated in by\r\nno less than seventy-seven cities on the part of the League. It\r\nterminated in 1370, leaving the Hansa master of the situation. For many\r\nyears after this the League exerted its power in Denmark, Sweden and\r\nNorway, and the rulers of these countries were compelled to respect the\r\nwishes and even submit to the orders of these proud merchants. The\r\ncountries bordering on the Baltic Sea remained the domain of the League\r\nfor several centuries. They gathered there immense quantities of raw\r\nmaterial, which they sold in the various ports of Europe. The influence\r\nof the League even reached as far as Novgorod in the east and London in\r\nthe west. In both cities the League had its quarters, and within them it\r\nvirtually exercised the right of sovereignty. Its main market was at\r\nBruges in Flanders, which was then a bee-hive of industry and thrift.\r\nThere the Italian traders came with the products of the east, such as\r\nspices, perfumes, oil, sugar, cotton and silk, to exchange them for the\r\nraw materials of the north. While taxes and imposts everywhere else\r\nharassed merchants, commerce was free in the cities of Flanders, owing\r\nto the liberality, or rather shrewdness, of her rulers. In Bruges the\r\nmembers of the Hansa met the merchants of Venice on equal terms, and the\r\nexchange of the products of the north for those of the east and south\r\ncould be effected there to the greatest advantage of both.\r\n\r\nWhile it must be admitted that the Hanseatic League developed the\r\nresources of Northern Europe, and that, even at the time of its greatest\r\npower, there was always competition among its own members, the fact\r\nremains that it abused its power by the suppression of all outside\r\ncompetition, and that it usurped rights which belong only to the state,\r\nthus often producing abuses as great as those which it was organized to\r\nremedy. Its final downfall was caused by the development of national\r\npower in the northern kingdoms and the growth of commerce and\r\nnavigation in Great Britain. A stubborn assertion of antiquated\r\nprivileges on the part of the Hansa involved it in a feud with the\r\nillustrious and lion-hearted Queen Elizabeth of England. In 1589 the\r\nQueen caused sixty of their vessels to be captured on the Tagus, and\r\nlater even took possession of their hall and wharves in London. After\r\nthis the League's decline was very rapid, though its organization was\r\nkept up till 1669, when its delegates held their last session.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the decline of the Hanseatic commerce in the north was\r\nthat of the Italian cities, especially Venice, in the south. They had\r\nprospered by their commerce with the Levant until Vasco de Gama\r\ndiscovered the sea route to East India in 1497. His countrymen, the\r\nPortuguese, soon utilized this discovery. They took possession of the\r\ncoast of India and of the islands to the south of it. They also\r\nsucceeded in excluding the Arabs from the commerce with that country, of\r\nwhich up to that time they had had exclusive control. For this purpose\r\nthey built fortresses and factories on the west coast of Hindostan, took\r\npossession of the island of Socotra in the Arabian, and of Ormus in the\r\nPersian Gulf, and forced the Indian princes to grant them the exclusive\r\nprivilege of trading with their subjects. They also captured the city of\r\nMalacca, where the trade between China, Japan, the Philippine Islands,\r\nthe Moluccas and India had concentrated itself. In this way they got in\r\na comparatively short time control of the commerce of India, Arabia, and\r\neven Egypt. By forcing the Venetians and their commercial allies out of\r\nthose markets, they secured for themselves a monopoly of the commerce\r\nbetween Europe and the east. The political ascendancy of the Turks in\r\nthe islands situated in, and in the countries bordering on, the Eastern\r\nMediterranean, caused the loss of Cyprus, Crete (Candia) and Morea to\r\nthe Venetians and greatly aided the Portuguese in establishing their\r\ncommercial supremacy. Less profitable for the latter was the possession\r\nof their American colonies. They, as well as the Spaniards, adopted here\r\na policy which ultimately brought commercial and industrial ruin upon\r\nboth. Entirely neglecting agriculture and relying on the mineral\r\nresources of their transatlantic colonies, which were believed to be\r\ninexhaustible, they strove to amass riches by reserving for themselves\r\nthe exclusive privilege of supplying them with the manufactures of\r\nEurope in exchange for American gold. Neglecting home industries, they\r\nbought their supplies as well as those of their colonies in France,\r\nHolland and England. A spirit of speculation and adventure enervated\r\ntheir people, and led in time to commercial bankruptcy and political\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nSpain also drained her treasury by her wars with her Dutch dependencies,\r\nand the loss of her northern provinces was a serious blow to her\r\ncommerce. Antwerp, which had become the successor of Bruges as the\r\ncommercial emporium of the north, began to decline, and Amsterdam, the\r\nmetropolis of the new Dutch republic, became heir to its glory and its\r\nriches. The young republic at once commenced to compete in the carrying\r\ntrade with Spain and Portugal, and to make inroads into the eastern\r\ncommerce of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch East India Company, which was organized in 1602, sent a fleet\r\nof fourteen vessels into the Indian Archipelago to found colonies in\r\nJava, Sumatra and the Moluccas. In a short time they had monopolized the\r\nentire spice trade, which immediately became a source of great wealth.\r\nA cargo of five vessels, which returned to Amsterdam in 1603, consisted\r\nof over two million pounds of spices. This cargo was purchased for\r\n588,874 florins and was sold for 2,000,000 florins. It is under these\r\ncircumstances not surprising that the dividends of the company's\r\nstockholders often amounted to 75 per cent., and never went below 12-1/2\r\nper cent. previous to 1720. Holland's colonial trade made Amsterdam the\r\ncommercial metropolis of Europe. It became the grain market from which\r\nSpain, Italy and other countries drew their supplies. All the products\r\nof the world found purchasers here, and a well-developed banking system\r\ngreatly facilitated the exchange. The rapid accumulation of fortunes by\r\nthe Dutch merchants and bankers was without precedent in Europe. Besides\r\nthis, the progress which Holland made in ship-building and navigation\r\nand the advantages which she derived from her colonial trade placed her\r\nin a position to outstrip all other nations in the carrying trade of\r\nEurope. During the first half of the seventeenth century the Dutch were\r\njustly called the freighters of Europe. But the injury which their\r\npolicy did to the commercial and manufacturing interests of other\r\nEuropean nations led both England and France to adopt measures well\r\ncalculated to accomplish, in a short time, their commercial\r\nemancipation. Louis XIV., in order to build up French shipping,\r\ncollected a tonnage from every foreign ship which entered a French\r\nharbor. England went still further. In 1651 Oliver Cromwell promulgated\r\nthe Navigation Act, by which foreign ships were prohibited from\r\nimporting into England any goods except such as were produced or\r\nmanufactured in their own countries. This was a heavy blow at the Dutch,\r\nwho were thus deprived of the privilege of effecting the exchange of\r\ncommercial commodities between England and her colonies as well as the\r\ncontinent. The war which the Dutch Republic waged against England, to\r\nforce her to revoke this act, resulted in favor of the latter and ended\r\nthe commercial supremacy of the Dutch in Europe.\r\n\r\nEngland, which before this time had played but a secondary role as a\r\ncommercial power, rose fast to prominence after her successful struggle\r\nwith the Dutch. She commenced to strengthen her industries by the\r\nadoption of a high tariff policy, and her merchants were encouraged to\r\nenter into commercial relations with colonists and foreigners. The\r\nprivileges which had been given to foreign tradesmen were revoked, while\r\nship-building and navigation were greatly favored by the government. As\r\nEngland gained greater strength as a naval power, her foreign policy\r\nbecame more aggressive.\r\n\r\nIn 1600 the \"Company of Merchants of London Trading to the East Indies\"\r\nobtained a charter, and, in spite of Dutch and Portuguese opposition,\r\nsoon gained a foothold on the Moluccas and the coast of Malabar, whence\r\nit extended in time its dominion to Surat, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta.\r\nHere they built forts and established their commerce. From these places\r\nthe company pushed into the interior, until finally, after repeated\r\nstruggles with the natives and European rivals, the whole of Hindostan\r\ncame under English dominion. As its power increased, the company\r\ncommenced to abuse shamefully the monopoly which it had been granted, by\r\ninaugurating a system of plunder and oppression which is perhaps without\r\nits equal in the annals of history. These growing abuses led to frequent\r\nrevolts and seriously imperiled England's dominion in these territories.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these evils, Parliament at the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury annulled the charter of the company and declared the commerce\r\nwith the East Indies open to all of the King's subjects. A number of\r\nsmall companies were formed, but in 1702 they all combined and organized\r\nthe East India Company. Monopoly was again established, but the patience\r\nof the natives was exhausted, and England's interests in Hindostan were\r\nin a critical condition. At this juncture the East India Company adopted\r\na policy of moderation, and this, together with the aid which the\r\ngovernment gave to the company, enabled it to strengthen again its\r\nweakened commercial relations and to further enlarge its territory. But\r\nthe temptation to abuse its power was too great for this strong\r\ncorporation to be long resisted. Abuses again crept into its management\r\nand continued to grow until its charter was finally repealed.\r\n\r\nThe policy adopted by Great Britain for the government of her American\r\ncolonies during the eighteenth century was less rapacious, but scarcely\r\nmore just than that pursued in her eastern possessions. To retain those\r\ncolonies as commercial no less than as political dependencies,\r\nParliament enacted laws compelling their people to trade with the mother\r\ncountry exclusively and laying restraint on their manufactures. But the\r\nAmerican pioneers felt that they had brought with them across the ocean\r\nthe rights of Englishmen; they objected to taxation without\r\nrepresentation, and the men who for opinion's sake had left comfortable\r\nhomes to brave upon a distant shore the dangers of frontier life were\r\nprepared, if necessary, to emphasize their objection by armed\r\nresistance. England, intent upon maintaining her barbaric system of\r\ndiscriminative duties and commercial monopolies, blindly attempted\r\ncoercion, but the war which resulted wrested from the English crown its\r\nbrightest jewel, and the War of 1812 established upon American soil the\r\nprinciple of industrial and commercial liberty.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that America and the United States in\r\nparticular have been free from monopolies growing out of the\r\ntransportation business. Nothing would be farther from the truth. There\r\nis no law so stringent but that it will be violated; there is no\r\ngovernment so vigilant but that it will at times be imposed upon. It is\r\ntrue, our government sanctions no monopoly, but the very liberty of\r\naction which exists here among corporations as well as individuals\r\noffers to organized wealth and power a wide field for abuses.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the foregoing that almost from time immemorial efforts\r\nhave been made to monopolize transportation and trade, and that these\r\nefforts were successful whenever either from ignorance or weakness the\r\nmasses fell into political apathy. There is a natural tendency among men\r\nto utilize commercial advantages to the detriment of others. In modern\r\ntimes the opportunities for building up large monopolies have greatly\r\nincreased and have been turned to the most profitable account by\r\ndesigning men. Great and even unbearable abuses have always followed\r\nwhere the greed and ambition of such men have not been checked by\r\ngovernmental agencies. In this respect the people of the United States\r\nhave had about the same experience as the rest of mankind. Ever since\r\nthe introduction of railroads into this country there has been a\r\nwell-marked drift toward monopolizing the transportation business.\r\n\r\nAs long as the dangers of monopoly remained unknown to the American\r\npeople, legislation for the control of railroads and other public\r\ncarriers was both scarce and crude, and shrewd railroad men were not\r\nslow in taking advantage of the situation. It is foreign to the design\r\nof this treatise to give a complete history of railroad monopoly in the\r\nUnited States. The author will therefore confine himself to showing that\r\ntransportation companies will, like the great commercial organizations\r\nof the past, when left to follow their instincts, invariably use their\r\npower to oppress the public by exacting excessive charges for their\r\nservices, or to discriminate against the many by extending special\r\nprivileges to the few. Hundreds of cases might be given to illustrate\r\nthe above rule, but a history of two of these corporations will suffice\r\nto show to what extent corporate abuses can be carried, and to serve as\r\na warning against the adoption of any \"_laissez faire_\" policy in the\r\nrailroad legislation of the future. The corporations selected for this\r\npurpose are the Camden and Amboy Railroad and the Standard Oil\r\nCompanies, both typical representatives of the Rob Roy policy which\r\norganized wealth has pursued since the dawn of civilization, when not\r\nprevented by the wisdom and strength of a good government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMDEN AND AMBOY RAILROAD COMPANY.\r\n\r\nFor almost forty years the Camden and Amboy Railroad was the only direct\r\nroute between the cities of New York and Philadelphia. It is doubtful\r\nwhether previous to the war a more important or a more remunerative road\r\nexisted in the United States, for, besides connecting the two largest\r\ncities in the Union, it formed part of the direct land route from the\r\nEast to the South.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to open a direct through route between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia date back to the year 1812, when the construction of a\r\ncanal between the Hudson and the Delaware was proposed, but an\r\nill-advised jealousy of the State of Pennsylvania delayed for many years\r\nthe realization of the project. When this obstacle was finally overcome,\r\na change of sentiment had taken place in New Jersey. Railroads had just\r\nmade their appearance in the United States, and a large number of the\r\npeople of New Jersey preferred a railroad to a canal.\r\n\r\nThe matter was finally compromised in the legislature of New Jersey,\r\nwhich on the 4th of February, 1830, simultaneously granted charters to\r\nthe Delaware and Raritan Canal Company and the Camden and Amboy\r\nTransportation Company, fixing the capital stock of each company at\r\n$1,000,000, with the right to increase it to $1,500,000. The charter\r\nfurther stipulated what taxes should be paid to the State, and also\r\ncontained the provision that within five miles of the starting-point and\r\nwithin three miles of the terminus of each line no other railroad or\r\ncanal should be built. It was believed the existence of both a water and\r\na land route would be sufficient to maintain competition on this\r\nimportant thoroughfare of interstate traffic. The construction of the\r\nrailroad, which had been surveyed in almost a straight line between its\r\ntermini, was at once commenced. A number of well-to-do and practical men\r\ntook hold of the enterprise, among them one John Stevens, who together\r\nwith his three sons took one-half of the capital stock. The canal\r\nproject did not do so well at first. At the middle of the year 1830 only\r\nabout one-twelfth of its capital stock had been sold, and there was\r\ngreat danger that the company might forfeit its charter, as the time\r\nallowed for the subscription of its stock was nearing its end. At this\r\njuncture Robert Field Stockton, a young man of ability, enthusiasm and\r\nwealth, came to the rescue of the canal company. He not only bought for\r\nhimself a goodly share of the canal stock, but also prevailed on his\r\nrich father-in-law, Mr. John Porter, to invest $400,000 in the\r\nenterprise. The financial difficulties of the company were thus removed.\r\nAt the next session of the legislature Mr. Stockton secured an amendment\r\nto their charter which apparently only authorized the enlargement of the\r\ncanal, but in reality empowered the canal company to construct a second\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nIt was from the beginning Mr. Stockton's object to share with the\r\nrailroad company the advantages which their line promised to give them.\r\nThe enlargement of his company's franchise placed him in a position to\r\ndictate terms to the Camden and Amboy Transportation Company. The latter\r\nwas given the choice, to prepare for competition with a rival railroad\r\nline, or to consolidate with the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company. It\r\nchose the latter alternative, and on the 15th day of February, 1831, the\r\ntwo companies became one. The consolidation still required the sanction\r\nof the legislature. This was obtained in consideration of the transfer\r\nof 2,000 shares of the capital stock of the company to the State. It was\r\nfurther stipulated that the new company should pay to the State a tax of\r\n10 cents for each passenger and of 15 cents for each ton of freight\r\ncarried over its line through the State, as well as an annual tax of\r\n$30,000, and that the State in return should protect the company against\r\nany and all competition in the direct passenger and freight traffic\r\nbetween the cities of New York and Philadelphia. Serious doubts were at\r\nthe time entertained by many, whether the State of New Jersey under the\r\nFederal Constitution possessed the right to thus create a monopoly in\r\ntransportation facilities, and to regulate arbitrarily the commerce\r\nbetween sister States.\r\n\r\nFive days after it had granted this charter to the Camden and Amboy\r\nCompany, the legislature granted another charter authorizing the\r\nconstruction of a railroad from Jersey City to New Brunswick on the\r\nRaritan River. On the 23d of February of the same year a charter had\r\nbeen granted by the legislature of the State of Pennsylvania to a\r\ncompany which had been formed for the purpose of constructing a railroad\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Trenton. This company had likewise been authorized\r\nby its charter to buy the right of way for a railroad from Trenton to\r\nNew York, which it proceeded at once to do. It was evident that as soon\r\nas the two new roads would meet at New Brunswick, an understanding would\r\nbe reached between them, by which another through line would be created\r\nbetween New York and Philadelphia, which would have the advantage over\r\nthe Camden and Amboy road that it touched the capital of New Jersey and\r\ncould thus make itself serviceable to members of the legislature,\r\nofficers of State and influential politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Camden and Amboy Freight Company soon arrived at the conclusion that\r\nit could not permit such rivalry. It appealed to the legislature for\r\nprotection. Resolutions were passed in its favor, but the Philadelphia\r\nand Trenton Railroad Company paid no attention to those resolutions, but\r\nquietly continued to lay its track. Mr. Stockton and his friends did not\r\ndare to invoke the aid of the courts, because a judicial investigation\r\nmight have resulted in the destruction of their own charter. The\r\nsituation was critical, but Mr. Stockton was equal to the occasion. He\r\nbought quietly a sufficient number of shares to control the management\r\nof the Philadelphia and Trenton road, and, in April, 1836, secured the\r\nconsolidation of the Philadelphia and Trenton and the Camden and Amboy\r\nrailroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe canal of the company was not completed until 1838. It had consumed a\r\nsum of money largely in excess of the original estimate. To connect the\r\ntwo lines of the consolidated company, a branch road was constructed\r\nfrom Trenton to Bordentown. Later the road from Trenton to Brunswick was\r\ncompleted and an agreement entered into with the Jersey City company for\r\na division of the traffic of the two roads. The large cost of these\r\nimprovements suggested to the company the advisability of increasing its\r\nrevenues and of decreasing its expenditures. Its charter provided for a\r\npayment to the State of 10 cents for each through passenger. By an\r\nartifice the company avoided the payment of this tax. It compelled its\r\nthrough passengers to walk over the bridge at Trenton and then continue\r\ntheir journey by rail via Bordentown to Jersey City.\r\n\r\nThe company's charter also stipulated, that the fare between New York\r\nand Philadelphia should not exceed $3 per passenger. Its officers\r\ninterpreted this stipulation to apply only to the intermediate traffic\r\nand proceeded to collect $2.50 for the trip from New York to Trenton,\r\nand $1.50 from there to Philadelphia, thus increasing the fare for the\r\nentire journey to $4.00, one dollar above the maximum allowed by law.\r\nOne Jacob Ridgway, who was the owner of a ferry-boat at Camden, saw here\r\nan opportunity for starting a lucrative business. He bought a steamer\r\nand carried passengers from Philadelphia to Trenton for one-third of the\r\nfare demanded by the railroad. After the Camden and Amboy Company had\r\nmade several unsuccessful attempts to intimidate Mr. Ridgway and his\r\nforce, one of which even brought Mr. Stockton in contact with the\r\ncriminal courts, it purchased the boat with all terminal facilities at\r\nPhiladelphia and Trenton. The attention of the legislature of New\r\nJersey was repeatedly called to the company's failure to comply with the\r\nprovisions of its charter, but these appeals were on the whole of no\r\navail. In 1842, after a long discussion, a resolution was carried\r\ndeclaring the charge of $4 for the through journey illegal, but the\r\ncompany entirely ignored this legislative reminder and continued its old\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nThe company's charter also reserved for the State the right to acquire\r\nthe Camden and Amboy road under certain conditions upon the payment of a\r\nreasonable compensation. In 1844, through Mr. Stockton's engineering,\r\nthe constitution of New Jersey was so amended as to practically deprive\r\nthe State of the power to acquire the company's property.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few years of the existence of the Camden and Amboy\r\nTransportation Company its business was managed in the interest of its\r\nowners, but soon a few of its leading stockholders managed to turn its\r\nenormous profits into their own pockets. The Stevens and Stockton\r\nfamilies, together with two other directors of the Camden and Amboy\r\nCompany, had come into possession of a line of steamers that plied on\r\nthe Raritan, between New Brunswick and New York. The enterprise, in\r\nspite of its largely watered capital, had been made to pay dividends\r\nranging from 30 to 40 per cent. Its owners saw an opportunity for a\r\nlarger field of usefulness and larger dividends. In 1834 a majority of\r\nthe board of directors of the Camden and Amboy Company proposed that the\r\ncompany rid itself of the responsibility connected with the\r\ntransportation business and lease its railroad and canal. Mr. Stevens,\r\nas representative of the Camden and Amboy Company, then negotiated with\r\nMr. Stevens, the representative of the Napoleon Steamer Company, and the\r\nnegotiations soon resulted in an agreement between the two companies by\r\nwhich the latter leased the railroad and canal lines of the former and\r\nagreed to pay it a fixed toll of $7.64 per ton upon all freights carried\r\nby rail, and one-quarter of all its revenues derived from the canal.\r\nSoon afterward the Napoleon Company entered into a similar contract with\r\nthe Camden Ferry Company and now had a complete monopoly of the\r\ntransportation business between New York and Philadelphia. It at once\r\ncommenced to develop a system of organized plunder. Instead of the\r\nmaximum charter tariff of 8 cents per ton per mile, it charged 10, 12,\r\nand even 15 cents. The through rates charged were several times as high\r\nas those fixed by the charter. Canal rates were raised to such an extent\r\nas to make them prohibitory and to compel the public to ship by rail. It\r\nis difficult even to estimate the total annual profits of the\r\ndirectorial syndicate. Their accounts, if any were kept, were not\r\naccessible, and surmises can only be based upon such data as\r\noccasionally found their way to the public. In 1845 the share of the\r\ncanal tolls paid to the company's stockholders was $359,000. The\r\ndirectors' share under the terms of their lease is thus found not to\r\nhave been less than $1,077,000. Another item of $170,000, tolls\r\ncollected for the transportation of 27,000 tons of freight, was so\r\ndivided that the Camden Ferry Company, or its other self, the\r\ndirectorial syndicate, received $32,000 for one mile, while the Camden\r\nand Amboy Railroad Company received $63,000, or less than twice as much,\r\nfor ninety-two miles. The directors under their lease were entitled to\r\nthe remaining $75,000.\r\n\r\nThe service of the company was as bad as it was expensive; its trains\r\nwere slow and irregular, and its employes arrogant. The syndicate which\r\ncontrolled the company defied its stockholders, the public and the\r\ncourts alike. When one of the stockholders, a Trenton merchant by the\r\nname of Hagar, applied to the courts for an order to compel the\r\ndirectors to produce their books and render an account, the syndicate\r\nbought Mr. Hagar's shares, for which he had paid $125 a share, at the\r\nprice of $1,456 a share. The suit was then withdrawn and the matter\r\nhushed up.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 a number of articles appeared in a paper published at\r\nBurlington, Pa., which were signed by \"A Citizen of Burlington\" and\r\ncontained much surprising information concerning the Camden and Amboy\r\nTransportation Company. It was charged that the directors had defrauded\r\nboth the State and the company's stockholders of large sums of money,\r\nthat they had grossly violated their charter by charging illegal and\r\nextortionate rates, oppressive to both commerce and travel. It was shown\r\nthat while the average rate per ton per mile of thirty-five neighboring\r\nroads was 2.85 cents, that of the Camden and Amboy Company was 4.54\r\ncents. It was also shown that neither the stockholders nor the State had\r\nreceived the share of the company's revenues to which they were\r\nentitled. These articles were extensively reprinted and caused a great\r\ncommotion wherever they appeared. After the first storm had subsided the\r\ndirectors issued an address to the people of New Jersey, in which they\r\nbitterly complained of the people's loss of confidence in their\r\nintegrity, and declared that the charges preferred against them were\r\nfounded on falsehoods.\r\n\r\nThe \"Citizen of Burlington\" replied by accusing the directors of\r\ndefalcation and falsifying their books. He charged that from 1840 to\r\n1847 no account had been rendered of the receipt of no less than\r\n$5,266,431, on which $493,066 was due to the State. As soon as the\r\nlegislature convened, a resolution was introduced that a commission be\r\nappointed to investigate the charges preferred against the Camden and\r\nAmboy Transportation Company. The resolution was adopted, but it was\r\nvirtually left to the accused to select the members of the commission.\r\nThat the directors had a guilty conscience appeared from the fact that\r\nthe last annual report of the company, which had just been printed, was\r\nwithdrawn and destroyed. To silence their unknown accuser, they\r\nthreatened him with criminal prosecution. He now gave his name. It was\r\nHenry C. Carey, the noted writer and authority on political economy. Mr.\r\nCarey did not give up the contest. He proceeded to show how the policy\r\nof the managers of the Camden and Amboy Transportation Company depressed\r\ncommerce, manufactures and agriculture alike. He showed how the company\r\nas a public carrier discriminated in favor of industries which they\r\ncarried on as private individuals. He claimed that the company had\r\nforfeited its charter, and that it was the duty of the State to\r\nauthorize the construction of another road. In the meantime, early in\r\n1849, the legislative investigation committee submitted its report. It\r\nwas perhaps as shameless a document as was ever placed before a\r\nlegislative assembly. It lauded the directors, to whose influence the\r\nmembers of the commission owed their selection, and whitewashed their\r\npast management of the company's affairs.\r\n\r\nBut the people of New Jersey were far from being satisfied with this\r\nreport and demanded the appointment of another committee. Another\r\ninvestigation was ordered, and this time the company, or rather its\r\ndirectors, found it impossible to control the selection of its members.\r\nSoon after their appointment the committee asked Mr. Carey to lend them\r\nhis assistance in their labors, and he readily consented. During the\r\nsummer of 1849 the members of the committee had occasion to go to\r\nBordentown, to inspect the company's books. From that time on a\r\nwonderful change seemed to have come over the committee. They found they\r\ncould dispense with Mr. Carey's further services. What had previously\r\nappeared to them a ring of rapacious monopolists seemed now an\r\nassociation of worthy philanthropical gentlemen. In their report to the\r\nlegislature they completely exonerated the company's managers. They\r\nadmitted that the State had not been paid all that was due to it, but\r\nthey asserted that this difference in the company's accounts was due\r\nsolely to clerical errors, for which the management were in no wise\r\nresponsible. The report was accepted, although not even the annexed\r\ntestimony supported it, and thus the matter was dropped.\r\n\r\nThis was a great victory for Mr. Stockton and his friends. It\r\ndemonstrated the success of their methods of dealing with public\r\nservants. Mr. Carey repeated his charges, but the directors failed to\r\nprosecute him for libel as they had threatened. He asked that he be\r\npermitted to inspect the company's books, but was met with a peremptory\r\nrefusal. Public opinion was defied, and the old methods were continued.\r\n\r\nThe extortionate and discriminating tariff of the only through route of\r\nNew Jersey affected seriously the agricultural as well as the commercial\r\ninterests of that State. The Camden and Amboy monopoly kept the State of\r\nNew Jersey for many years far behind the New England States in railroad\r\nfacilities. In 1860 New Jersey had only one mile of railroad for every\r\n17.6 square miles of territory, while the proportion of miles of\r\nrailroad to square miles of territory for the same year was 1 to 7.9 in\r\nConnecticut, 1 to 7.6 in Rhode Island, and 1 to 6 in Massachusetts. At\r\npresent New Jersey has one mile of railroad to every 3.79 square miles,\r\nand therefore leads all the States in the Union in density of railroad\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked how the Camden and Amboy Transportation\r\nCompany, or rather the syndicate which controlled it, contrived to\r\nmaintain its power for so many years, to the great detriment of industry\r\nand commerce. The only answer that can be given is that the men for whom\r\nthe maintenance of the monopoly was a source of great wealth were\r\nconstantly using a part of this wealth for the corruption of those who\r\nwere in a position to influence public opinion or to direct the policy\r\nof the State. Prominent politicians were favored with passes, attorneys\r\nwere retained by the company as local solicitors, corrupt and servile\r\nlegislators were bribed by money or the promise of lucrative positions,\r\nand newspapers were given large subsidies. In addition to this public\r\nmen were constantly made to realize the political power of the company,\r\nwhose many employes had always been trained to do the bidding of their\r\nmasters. If the opposition, in spite of this, was ever successful at\r\nlegislative elections, the company's managers found it less expensive to\r\ngain the good will of a few members of the legislature after election\r\nthan it would have been to gain the good will of their constituents\r\nbefore election. Dissatisfied stockholders who threatened with judicial\r\ninvestigation were quietly bought out or impressed with the danger of\r\ninviting public discussion in regard to the validity of the company's\r\ncharter, as it might lead to its annihilation. The good people of New\r\nJersey made several attempts to rid the State of the despotism of the\r\ncompany by making the question a political issue, but they were each\r\ntime defeated through the lavish and scandalous expenditure of the\r\ncompany's money.\r\n\r\nThe original charter of the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company was\r\ngranted for a period of twenty years, and should have expired in 1853,\r\nbut its managers succeeded in having it extended to January 1, 1859. In\r\n1854 another extension was asked for, and after a long and bitter debate\r\nthe company was again triumphant. An act was passed on the 16th of\r\nMarch, 1854, making it illegal to build previous to the first day of\r\nJanuary, 1869, without the consent of the Camden and Amboy\r\nTransportation Company, a railroad in the State of New Jersey for the\r\ntransportation of passengers and freight between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. At the end of this period even a third extension was\r\ngranted, and the company, though after January 1, 1867, under a new\r\nname, maintained its monopoly until it consolidated, in 1871, with the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nThat the spirit of the past is still at work was shown by the recent act\r\nof the legislature of New Jersey legalizing the consolidation of the\r\ncoal roads. The coal barons found the legislature as servile as the\r\nmanagers of the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company had found them of\r\nyore, and their well-planned scheme would probably have been successful\r\nhad it not been for Governor Abbot's courageous veto of the disgraceful\r\nact, and it is more than probable that they will yet succeed. They have,\r\nin fact, during the last year advanced the price of coal about one\r\ndollar per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STANDARD OIL MONOPOLY.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil monopoly may be said to be the crowning monument of\r\ncorporation conspiracy. It is, indeed, doubtful whether the combined\r\nbrotherhoods of mediæval knights ever were guilty of such acts of\r\nplunder and oppression as the Standard Oil Company and its railroad\r\nallies stand convicted of before the American people. The facts that\r\nhave been unearthed by official investigations show a frightful\r\nprevalence of corporate lawlessness and official corruption, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that, could certain high railroad dignitaries have been\r\ncompelled to testify, and could the truth have been fathomed, it would\r\nhave been found that not only the public, but railroad stockholders as\r\nwell, were victimized by those transactions.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Standard Oil monopoly was some twenty years ago part\r\nowner of a petroleum refinery at Cleveland, Ohio. His fertile brain\r\nconceived the thought that with the coöperation of the railroad\r\ncompanies a few men of means could control the petroleum business of the\r\nUnited States. With this end in view he approached the managers of the\r\nNew York Central, the Erie and the Pennsylvania Central railroad\r\ncompanies, and on January 18, 1872, entered with them into a secret\r\ncompact by which they agreed to coöperate with the South Improvement\r\nCompany (an organization formed by that gentleman to aid in the\r\naccomplishment of his designs) to grant to said companies certain\r\nrebates and to secure it against loss or injury by competition. The\r\nSouth Improvement Company, in consideration of these favors, guaranteed\r\nto the railroad companies a fair division of its freights. The existence\r\nof this contract soon became known and caused a violent protest among\r\nthe oil-producers. An indignation meeting was held and a committee was\r\nappointed to wait on the railroad managers and demand fair treatment for\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies yielded and promised to give equal rates to all\r\nshippers and to grant to no person either rebates or any other advantage\r\nwhatever. New rates were fixed for the transportation of both crude and\r\nrefined oil, and it was agreed on the part of the railroad companies\r\nthat at least ninety days' notice should be given of any change that\r\nmight be made in the rates. Steps were also taken to have the charter of\r\nthe South Improvement Company canceled because it had been found that it\r\nwas neither the owner of a refinery nor of an oil well, and could\r\ntherefore not comply with the legal requirements concerning the\r\norganization of stock companies. While the South Improvement Company\r\nthus came to a sudden and rather inglorious end, its founders soon\r\ncontrived other means to carry out their ingenious plans. They bought a\r\nrefinery, reorganized by taking the prepossessing title of Standard Oil\r\nCompany, and were now prepared to resume their operations under the\r\nguise of legal authority.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies seemed to have relished their novel business\r\nconnections, for, without paying the least attention to the agreement\r\ninto which they had entered with the other producers and refiners of\r\noil, they extended the privileges of the defunct South Improvement\r\nCompany to its successors. The new company received secret rebates\r\nranging from 50 cents to $1.32 per barrel. The agreement also contained\r\nthe stipulation that if lower rates should ever be granted to their\r\ncompetitors, an additional rebate should be given to the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. Endowed with these privileges, the favored company proceeded to\r\nunite under its banner, by consolidation, purchase or lease, the\r\nleading refineries of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the discriminations practiced against independent\r\nrefineries soon became apparent. In less than two years there were\r\nclosed in Pittsburgh twenty-one refineries, that represented an\r\naggregate capital of $2,000,000 and had given employment to over 3,000\r\npeople. A large number of the remaining refineries were forced to\r\nconsolidate with the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\nThe next step toward the entire suppression of competition was an attack\r\nplanned against the independent pipe lines. The Standard had early\r\nsecured control of the United Pipe Line. To exterminate competing lines,\r\nthey again appealed to the railroad companies, and on the 9th day of\r\nSeptember, 1874, J. H. Rutter, general freight agent of the New York\r\nCentral, issued a new oil tariff which discriminated greatly in favor of\r\nthe oil brought by the United Pipe Line to the refineries. Up to that\r\ntime this company had done from 25 to 30 per cent. of the total business\r\nof the various pipe lines. Within one year after the adoption of the new\r\ntariff it did fully 80 per cent. of the entire business. This forced the\r\nindependent lines either to sell out to the Standard or to suspend\r\nbusiness, for the latter's rebate was larger than their toll. The oil\r\ntariff of the Pennsylvania Central compelled the independent Pittsburgh\r\nrefiners to ship their refined oil over that company's line, if they\r\nwould avail themselves of the rebate which it granted on the rates for\r\nthe transportation of crude oil to Pittsburgh. The evident purpose and\r\nthe effect of such a tariff was to prohibit oil shipments over the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio. Had this road made ever so reasonable a tariff, the\r\ncombined charges for the transportation of the crude petroleum from the\r\noil regions to Pittsburgh by the Pennsylvania Central, and for that of\r\nthe refined oil to the sea coast by the Baltimore and Ohio, would still\r\nhave been prohibitive in competition with the special transit rates\r\ngranted to the Standard Oil Company. As a remedy it was proposed to\r\norganize a new pipe line, it being believed that the crude oil could be\r\nbrought to Pittsburgh by that line, refined there, shipped to the\r\nseaboard by the Baltimore and Ohio, and sold there at as good or even a\r\nbetter profit than the product of the Standard, notwithstanding the\r\nfavors received by the latter from the allied trunk lines. This movement\r\nresulted in the creation of the Columbia Conduit Company, which at once\r\nproceeded to lay its pipes from the oil wells to Pittsburgh. Under the\r\nlaws of the State of Pennsylvania it became necessary for this company\r\nto obtain the permission of property-holders to lay the pipes through\r\ntheir lands. Consent was everywhere readily given, and the pipes were\r\nlaid without hindrance until the track of the Pennsylvania Railroad was\r\nreached, within a few miles of the Pittsburgh refineries. This company\r\nperemptorily refused to let the pipes be laid under its track. The pipe\r\nline company after some delay contrived a way to obviate the difficulty.\r\nIt laid its pipes on each side of the road as close to the track as it\r\ncould without trespassing against the legal rights of the Pennsylvania\r\nCentral, and then conveyed the oil from one side of the track to the\r\nother by means of large oil tanks on wheels, which could not be\r\nprevented from passing over the railroad track at the public crossing.\r\nAfter several months the railroad company allowed the pipes to be laid\r\nunder its track, but it soon appeared that another combination had been\r\neffected to destroy the value of this concession. A railroad war had\r\ngiven the three trunk lines an opportunity to force the Baltimore and\r\nOhio into the pool. A uniform rate of $1.15 was established for\r\nshipments of refined petroleum from any point to the seaboard. While\r\nthis was in itself an unjust discrimination against Pittsburgh, which is\r\n250 miles nearer tidewater than Cleveland, the railroads in addition\r\ngranted the Standard secret rebates which enabled it to sell its oil on\r\nthe coast for less than the sum of its first cost at the refineries and\r\nthe open rate of transportation to the points of export. The independent\r\nrefiners of Pittsburgh found themselves again cut off from the market,\r\nbut necessity soon made them discover another outlet. Shipping their oil\r\ndown the Ohio River to Huntington, W. Va., they had it taken by the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Railroad to Richmond. In spite of the fact that this\r\nroute was more than twice as long as the direct line from Pittsburgh to\r\nthe seaboard, and in spite of the further fact that it necessitated an\r\nexpensive transfer, a rate equal to about two-thirds of the trunk line\r\nrate for the direct shipment proved remunerative to the Chesapeake and\r\nOhio. The independent refiners kept up their competition for some time,\r\nbut the great disadvantage of river travel and the insufficient export\r\nfacilities of Richmond finally forced them to give up the contest.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1877 the Standard Oil Company had worked hand in hand\r\nwith the railroads. It had obtained all its privileges by asking for\r\nthem and by holding out inducements to railroad managers to grant them.\r\nIt now commenced to dictate terms to refractory railroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania road ventured to carry oil not the property of the\r\nStandard on terms which that company did not approve. The latter ordered\r\nthe road to refuse to carry the product of their competitors. This the\r\nrailroad company declined to do, and the Standard at once withdrew its\r\ncustom. The Pennsylvania retaliated by carrying the oil of the\r\nindependent refineries at merely nominal rates and even went so far as\r\nto make its rates dependent upon the profits realized by the shippers. A\r\nfierce freight war was thus precipitated, in which the Erie and New York\r\nCentral supported the Standard Company. The Pennsylvania road was soon\r\nforced to surrender and sign an ignominious treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore and Ohio, which had again commenced to carry the product\r\nof those Pittsburgh refineries which received their crude oil through\r\nthe Columbia Conduit Company, was in a similar manner forced to reject\r\ntheir freights. The pipe line, whose value was thus almost entirely\r\ndestroyed, was soon after sold to the Standard Oil Company. This company\r\nhad now an almost complete monopoly of the oil business of the United\r\nStates, and still it was not satisfied. It appears that some of the\r\nproducers of crude oil had been in the habit of shipping a part of their\r\nproduct in spite of the advantages which the Standard had through its\r\nrebates. To prevent even these shipments, or rather to exact another\r\ntribute from railroad stockholders, the American Transfer Company, one\r\nof the auxiliaries of the Standard Oil Trust, in 1878, demanded and\r\nreceived from the Pennsylvania road a \"commission\" of 20 cents a barrel\r\non all shipments of petroleum _made by any_ shipper. It had been shown\r\nto the satisfaction of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company that similar\r\ncommissions, ranging from 20 to 35 cents a barrel, were being paid by\r\nthe New York Central and Erie roads.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1879, an effort was made to establish a pipe line from the oil\r\nregions to the seaboard, nothing was left undone by the trunk lines to\r\nthwart the enterprise. The new company finally succeeded in making\r\nconnection with a railway which had no part in the pool, and there was\r\nsome hope that under this arrangement competition might at least be\r\nmaintained at some points. The Standard Company again appealed to the\r\ntrunk lines to protect it against injury by competition and obtained\r\nfrom them a special rate of 20 cents per barrel, which rate was even\r\nreduced to 15 cents per barrel two months later. Against such a rate it\r\nwas impossible to compete, and after a short struggle the new line found\r\nitself compelled to sell its works to the Standard.\r\n\r\nTo crown its monopoly, the Standard Oil Company finally bought of the\r\nNew York Central and Erie roads their terminal facilities for the\r\ntransportation of oil, and thereby made it virtually impossible for them\r\nto transport oil for any of its few remaining competitors. Mr. Josiah\r\nLombard, part owner of the New York refinery, stated in 1879 before the\r\ninvestigating committee of the legislature of New York that in 1878 he\r\nhad requested the Erie Company to transport for him 100 cars of crude\r\noil from Carrollton to New York; that he had called upon Mr. Vilas, the\r\ngeneral freight agent of the company, in person, but had never been able\r\nto obtain the cars, though the oil had been held in Carrollton three or\r\nfour months ready to be loaded. This gentleman also testified that he\r\nhad found it impossible to obtain cars from the New York Central, and\r\nthat the company's general freight agent had informed him that the road\r\ndid not own and could not furnish any oil cars.\r\n\r\nAfter the Standard Oil Company had secured control of the various pipe\r\nlines of the oil regions, it frequently lowered the price of crude oil\r\nto such an extent as to make its production unprofitable. It even\r\nrefused to buy oil, basing its refusal upon the ground that the railroad\r\ncompanies failed to furnish cars for its transportation. When the\r\nwell-owners had their tanks filled, they had the choice to let the oil\r\nrun away or to be at the expense of closing up their wells. In one\r\ninstance, however, when their ruse threatened to cause a riot, several\r\nhundred cars were brought to the wells within a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil Trust, not satisfied with the monopoly of the wholesale\r\ntrade, even tried in places to control the retail trade by peddling oil\r\nat private houses. This method of destroying competition was chiefly\r\nresorted to where independent dealers obtained their supply by a water\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nThat many of the deeds of the Standard are dark is evident from the fact\r\nthat its members, when summoned by the Hepburn committee, declined to\r\ntestify, lest their testimony be used to convict them of crime.\r\nOfficials of the trust have bribed or attempted to bribe employes of\r\nrival firms, for the purpose of ruining their business. By its peculiar\r\nmethods the company has been successful in courts of justice and\r\nlegislative halls, and has enjoyed an impunity for its conspiracy\r\nagainst the public that is without precedent in America. It has\r\naccumulated a capital of more than $100,000,000, and it is even claimed\r\nthat for years its annual dividends have exceeded in amount the capital\r\nactually invested. This is not at all strange when it is considered that\r\nthey have levied upon the producers, consumers and transporters alike.\r\nMr. Cassat testified before the New York investigating committee that in\r\neighteen months the railroads had paid the Standard in rebates no less\r\nthan $10,000,000. And the very payment of these enormous rebates\r\nenabled the Standard to decrease the price of oil to the producer and to\r\nincrease it to the consumer.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the defenders of the Standard monopoly that under the\r\ntrust the price of petroleum has been constantly decreased to the\r\nconsumer. That the price of kerosene is lower now than it was fifteen\r\nyears ago is undoubtedly true, but the reductions were brought about not\r\nby the trust, but in spite of the trust. The price now maintained is an\r\nunnatural one. The Standard Oil Company never lowered the price of its\r\noil except when compelled to do so by competition. The largely increased\r\noutput of crude oil, the improved methods of refining, the greatly\r\nlowered cost of transportation would have lowered the price of coal oil\r\nwithout the philanthropy of the Standard Oil Company. Iron, steel,\r\ncalico, woolen goods and a thousand other commodities have within almost\r\nthe same period suffered much larger reductions than coal oil. But even\r\nif the Standard monopoly had voluntarily lowered the price of its\r\nproducts, the American people could never approve of its methods. They\r\ncan never be made to believe that the end sanctifies the means,\r\nespecially when those means are railroad favors, secret combinations,\r\nbribery, intimidation and lawless arrogance.\r\n\r\nMany other interesting cases might be given. The Southern Pacific\r\nRailway Company, for instance, owns nearly all of the railways of\r\nCalifornia, and enjoys at the present time almost a complete monopoly of\r\nthe transportation business of that State and much more of the Pacific\r\nCoast. Perhaps no set of managers would be more considerate of the\r\npeople's rights in the absence of legal restraint than those in charge\r\nof this company, yet there is not a business man on the Pacific Coast\r\nwho comes in contact with this company who does not realize and feel\r\nthe power of its iron hand, unless it be those who for various reasons\r\nare recipients of its special favors. It has become notorious that the\r\nlegislature, Board of Railroad Commissioners and some of the judges of\r\nthe courts of that State are as servile to the demands of this railway\r\ncompany as are its own employes.\r\n\r\nThe railway company is a closely organized body of shrewd, active men,\r\nwhile those who furnish business for it are not organized, and they will\r\nnever be able to properly protect their own interests until they control\r\nthe machinery of their State government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD ABUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been shown, railroad enterprise met with comparatively\r\nlittle opposition in the United States, for, as compared with the\r\ninterests certain to be benefited by the introduction of the new mode of\r\ntransportation, those likely to be injured by it were insignificant. It\r\nis true, the innate conservatism of man even here recorded its\r\nobjections to the innovation. It viewed with distrust the new power\r\nwhich threatened to revolutionize well-established systems of\r\ntransportation and time-honored customs and to force upon the people\r\neconomic factors the exact nature and value of which could only be\r\nascertained by practical tests. But the progressive portion of the\r\ncommunity was so decidedly predominant that these protests were soon\r\ndrowned in the general demand for improved facilities of transportation.\r\nThe farmer who had to haul his produce a great distance to reach a\r\nmarket appreciated the advantages to be derived from the location of a\r\nrailroad station nearer home. The manufacturer who heretofore had, had a\r\nvery limited territory for the sale of his products well realized that\r\nhe could with the aid of a railroad enlarge his territory and increase\r\nhis output, and with it his profits. The pioneer merchant found that he\r\ncould no longer compete with former rivals in adjoining towns, since the\r\niron horse had reached them and lowered their freights, and he also\r\nbecame a convert to the new order of things and clamored loud for\r\nrailroad facilities. Railroads seemed the panacea for industrial and\r\ncommercial ills, and every inducement was held out and every sacrifice\r\nmade by communities to become participants of their blessings. So great\r\nwas the estimate of the conveniences afforded by them and so strongly\r\nwas public opinion prejudiced in their favor that it is no exaggeration\r\nto say that railroad companies as a rule were permitted to prepare their\r\nown charters, and that these charters almost invariably received\r\nlegislative sanction.\r\n\r\nTo such an extent was the public mind prepossessed in favor of railroads\r\nthat any legislator who would have been instrumental in delaying the\r\ngranting of a railroad charter for the purpose of perfecting it, to\r\nprotect the people against possible abuses, would have been denounced as\r\na short-sighted stickler and obstructor of public improvements. Anxious\r\nfor railroad facilities, the people were deaf to the warnings of\r\nhistory. Their liberality knew no bounds. National, State and county aid\r\nwas freely extended to new railroad enterprises. Communities taxed\r\nthemselves heavily for their benefit, and municipalities and individuals\r\nvied with each other in donating money, rights of way and station\r\nbuildings. This was especially true of the West, whose undeveloped\r\nresources had most to gain by railroad extension. So large were the\r\npublic and private donations in several of the Western States that their\r\nvalue was equal to one-fifth of the total cost of all the roads\r\nconstructed. To still more encourage promoters of railroad enterprises,\r\ngeneral incorporation laws were passed which permitted companies to be\r\nformed and roads to be built practically without State supervision. In\r\ntheir admiration for the bright side of the picture, the people entirely\r\noverlooked the shady side.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there was virtually an absence of all law regulating the\r\noperation of railroads. It was, under these circumstances, not strange\r\nthat abuses early crept into railroad management which, long tolerated\r\nby the people and unchecked and even encouraged by public officers,\r\nfinally assumed such proportions as to threaten the very foundation of\r\nfree government. Great discoveries that add rapidly to the wealth of a\r\ncountry tend to overthrow a settled condition of things, and organized\r\ncapital and power, if not restrained by wholesome laws and public\r\nwatchfulness, will ever take advantage of the unorganized masses. The\r\npeople of those regions which the railroad stimulus had caused to be\r\nsettled thrived for years so well upon a virgin soil that they gladly\r\ndivided their surplus with the railroad companies. They looked upon the\r\nrailroads as the source of their prosperity and upon railroad managers\r\nas high-minded philanthropists and public benefactors, with whom to\r\nquarrel would be an act of sordid ingratitude, and they paid but little\r\nattention to the means employed by them to exact an undue share of their\r\nearnings. Railroad men did whatever they could to foster through their\r\nemissaries this misplaced adoration. They posed before the public as the\r\nrightful heirs of the laurels of Watt and Stephenson, insisting that\r\ntheir genius, capital and enterprise had built up vast cities and opened\r\nfor settlement and civilization the boundless prairies of the West.\r\nThese claims have been persistently repeated by railroad men, though\r\nthey are so preposterous that they scarcely deserve refutation. The\r\nrailroad, gradually developed by active minds of the past, and greatly\r\nimproved by the inventions of hundreds of men in the humbler walks of\r\nlife, is the common inheritance of all mankind, though no class of\r\npeople have derived greater benefits from it than railroad constructors,\r\nmanagers and manipulators. Railroad managers are no more entitled to\r\nthe special gratitude of the public for dispensing railroad\r\ntransportation at much more than remunerative rates than is the Western\r\nUnion monopoly for maintaining among us an expensive and inefficient\r\ntelegraph service. No one believes that the disbanding of the Western\r\nUnion would leave us long without telegraphic communication. In like\r\nmanner railroads will be built whenever and wherever they promise to be\r\nprofitable. If one company does not take advantage of the opportunities\r\noffered, another will. That large cities have been built up by the\r\nrailroads is true, but it is equally true that these cities by their\r\ncommerce and manufactures administer to the prosperity of the railroads\r\nas much as the railroads administer to theirs. Commercial centers in\r\ndays gone by existed without railroads, but railroads could not long\r\nexist without the stimulating influence of these busy marts of trade.\r\nThe same argument applies with still greater force to the agricultural\r\nsections of our country, especially the great Northwest. The dry-goods\r\nmerchant might as well boast of having clad the public as the railroad\r\nmanager of having built up farming communities by selling to them\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the American people have never ceased to be mindful of the\r\nconveniences afforded to them by this modern mode of transportation. On\r\nthe contrary, they have been but too prone to credit railroad men with\r\nbeing benefactors, when they were but beneficiaries, and this liberality\r\nof spirit made them overlook, or at least tolerate, the abuses which\r\ngrew proportionately with the wealth and power of the companies.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad acts of England had contemplated to make the roads\r\nhighways, like turnpikes and canals. These roads were established by the\r\npower of eminent domain. Companies were empowered to build and maintain\r\nthem and to reimburse themselves by the collection of fixed tolls. Had\r\nthe owners of the roads from the beginning been deprived of the\r\nprivilege of becoming carriers over their own lines, the system might\r\nhave so adjusted itself as to become entirely practicable; but as they\r\nwere allowed to compete with other carriers in the transportation of\r\npassengers and merchandise, they were soon able to demonstrate, at least\r\nto the satisfaction of Parliament, that the use of the track by\r\ndifferent carriers was impracticable and unsafe. A number of\r\ncircumstances combined to aid the railroad companies in their efforts to\r\nmonopolize the trade on their lines. In the first place, when the early\r\nrailroad charters were granted, but few persons had any conception of\r\nthe enormous growth of commerce which was destined to follow everywhere\r\nthe introduction of railways. The tolls as fixed in the charters soon\r\nyielded an income out of proportion to the cost of the construction and\r\nmaintenance of the roads. Their large margins of profit enabled the\r\nowners of the roads to transport goods at lower rates than other\r\ncarriers and to thus compel the latter to abandon their business.\r\nAnother defect of the original charters worked greatly to the\r\ndisadvantage of independent carriers. They contained no provision as to\r\nthe use of terminal facilities. The railroad companies claimed that\r\nthese facilities were not affected by the public franchise and were\r\ntherefore their personal property. This placed independent carriers at a\r\ngreat disadvantage and made in itself competition on a large scale\r\nimpossible. These carriers were thus at the mercy of the railroad\r\ncompanies for the transportation of their cars, and the companies never\r\npermitted their business to become lucrative enough to induce many to\r\nengage in it. It soon became apparent that under the charters granted\r\nto the railroad companies such competition as existed on turnpikes and\r\ncanals was out of the question on their roads. In England the great\r\nabundance of water-ways exercised for many years a wholesome control\r\nover the rates of railway companies, until these companies, greatly\r\nannoyed by such restraint, absorbed many of the larger canals by\r\npurchase and made them tributary to their systems. These companies have\r\nalso acquired complete control over many important harbors.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the people depended from the beginning of the\r\nrailroad era on free competition for the regulation of railroad charges.\r\nThis desire to maintain free competition led to the adoption of general\r\nincorporation acts, it being quite generally believed that such\r\ncompetition as obtains between merchants, manufacturers and mechanics\r\nwas possible among railroads and would, when allowed to be operative,\r\nregulate prices and prevent abuses. The remedy was applied freely\r\nthroughout the country, but for once it did not prove successful.\r\nStephenson's saying, that where combination was possible competition was\r\nimpossible, was here fully verified. The great ingenuity of the class of\r\nmen usually engaged in railroad enterprises succeeded in thwarting this\r\npolicy of commercial freedom. The opportunities for those in control of\r\nrailroads to operate them in their own interest, regardless of the\r\ninterests of their patrons or stockholders, were so great that men of a\r\nspeculative turn of mind were attracted to this business, which indeed\r\nsoon proved a most productive field for them. One road after another\r\nfell into the control of men who had learned rapidly the methods\r\nemployed to make large fortunes in a short time.\r\n\r\nAs the roads multiplied, transportation abuses increased. A considerable\r\nnumber of people early favored State control of railroads as the best\r\nmeans of regulating transportation, but a majority looked upon the\r\nexisting abuses as being merely incidental to the formative period, and\r\nhoped that with a greater expansion of the railroad system they would\r\ncorrect themselves. And this doctrine was industriously disseminated by\r\nrailroad managers and their allies. They lost no opportunity to impress\r\nupon the people that State regulation was an undue interference with\r\nprivate business and that such a policy would soon react against those\r\nwho hoped to profit by it, inasmuch as it would prevent the building of\r\nnew roads and would thus hinder, rather than aid, in bringing about the\r\nright solution of the railway question, viz., regulation by competition.\r\nThey contended, in short, that State regulation would be destructive to\r\nrailroads as well as to every other class of property.\r\n\r\nRailroad sophistry for many years succeeded in preventing the masses\r\nfrom realizing that an increased supply of transportation does not\r\nnecessarily lower its price, or, in other words, that railroad abuses do\r\nnot necessarily correct themselves through the influence of competition.\r\nA large capital is required to build and maintain a railroad, which must\r\nnecessarily be managed by a few persons. Besides this, the construction\r\nof a railroad practically banishes at once from its field all other\r\nmeans of land transportation. The railroad has thus a practical monopoly\r\nwithin its territory, and its managers, if left to follow their\r\ninstinct, will despotically control all the business tributary to it,\r\nwith unlimited power to build up and tear down, to punish its enemies\r\nand to reward its friends.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that State control checks railroad building. While it may\r\nprevent the construction of useless lines and discourage speculation, it\r\nwill encourage the building of roads for which there is a legitimate\r\ndemand. Stockholders as a whole do not participate in the management of\r\nthe roads and do not profit by railroad abuses, the origin of which may\r\nalmost invariably be traced to selfish designs on the part of a few\r\nentrusted with the management of the property. Where through wise\r\nlegislation these abuses are prevented, the roads are managed in the\r\ninterest of all the stockholders, develop business and enjoy lasting\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a general rule that the policy which best\r\nsubserves the interests of the patrons of a road is always the best\r\npolicy for its owners. Injustice to a railroad will interfere with its\r\nusefulness; injustice to shippers depresses production and consumption;\r\nand in either case both the road and its patrons will suffer. State\r\ncontrol is therefore as much needed in the interest of the owners of\r\nrailroads as in the interest of their patrons. What should be the nature\r\nof such control will be discussed hereafter. A full understanding of the\r\nquestion at issue, however, makes necessary an inquiry into the various\r\nabuses which unrestrained railroad management of the past has developed.\r\nPerhaps no better presentation of the evils and abuses of railroads and\r\ntheir consequences can be found than that contained in the report of the\r\nSenate Committee on Interstate Commerce, submitted by Senator Cullom, in\r\n1886. This report charges:\r\n\r\n1. That local rates are unreasonably high, as compared with through\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n2. That local and through rates are unreasonably high at non-competing\r\npoints, either from the absence of competition or in consequence of\r\npooling agreements that restrict its operation.\r\n\r\n3. That rates are established without apparent regard to the actual cost\r\nof the service performed, and are based largely on \"what the traffic\r\nwill bear.\"\r\n\r\n4. That unjustifiable discriminations are constantly made between\r\nindividuals in the rates charged for like service under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n5. That improper discriminations are constantly made between articles of\r\nfreight and branches of business of a like character, and between\r\ndifferent quantities of the same class of freight.\r\n\r\n6. That unreasonable discriminations are made between localities\r\nsimilarly situated.\r\n\r\n7. That the effect of the prevailing policy of railroad management is,\r\nby an elaborate system of secret special rates, rebates, drawbacks and\r\nconcessions, to foster monopoly, to enrich favored shippers, and to\r\nprevent free competition in many lines of trade in which the item of\r\ntransportation is an important factor.\r\n\r\n8. That such favoritism and secrecy introduce an element of uncertainty\r\ninto legitimate business that greatly retards the development of our\r\nindustries and commerce.\r\n\r\n9. That the secret cutting of rates and the sudden fluctuations that\r\nconstantly take place are demoralizing to all business except that of a\r\npurely speculative character, and frequently occasion great injustice\r\nand heavy losses.\r\n\r\n10. That, in the absence of national and uniform legislation, the\r\nrailroads are able by various devices to avoid their responsibility as\r\ncarriers, especially on shipments over more than one road, or from one\r\nState to another, and that shippers find great difficulty in recovering\r\ndamages for the loss of property or for injury therefor.\r\n\r\n11. That railroads refuse to be bound by their own contracts, and\r\narbitrarily collect large sums in the shape of overcharges in addition\r\nto the rates agreed upon at the time of shipment.\r\n\r\n12. That railroads often refuse to recognize or to be responsible for\r\nthe acts of dishonest agents acting under their authority.\r\n\r\n13. That the common law fails to afford a remedy for such grievances,\r\nand that in cases of dispute the shipper is compelled to submit to the\r\ndecision of the railroad manager or pool commissioner, or run the risk\r\nof incurring further losses by greater discriminations.\r\n\r\n14. That the differences, in the classifications in use in various parts\r\nof the country, and sometimes for shipments over the same roads in\r\ndifferent directions, are a fruitful source of misunderstandings, and\r\nare often made a means of extortion.\r\n\r\n15. That a privileged class is created by the granting of passes, and\r\nthat the cost of the passenger service is largely increased by the\r\nextent of this abuse.\r\n\r\n16. That the capitalization and bonded indebtedness of the roads largely\r\nexceed the actual cost of their construction or their present value, and\r\nthat unreasonable rates are charged in the effort to pay dividends on\r\nwatered stock and interest on bonds improperly issued.\r\n\r\n17. That railroad corporations have improperly engaged in lines of\r\nbusiness entirely distinct from that of transportation, and that undue\r\nadvantages have been afforded to business enterprises where railroad\r\nofficials were interested.\r\n\r\n18. That the management of the railroad business is extravagant and\r\nwasteful, and that a needless tax is imposed upon the shipping and\r\ntraveling public by the necessary expenditure of large sums in the\r\nmaintenance of a costly force of agents engaged in a reckless strife for\r\ncompetitive business.\r\n\r\nUnder the operation of the Interstate Commerce Law some of these evils\r\nhave, so far at least as interstate commerce is concerned, disappeared,\r\nand others have been considerably mitigated. It cannot be expected,\r\nhowever, that a bad system of railroad management, to the development of\r\nwhich the ingenuity of railroad managers has contributed for two\r\ngenerations, could be entirely reformed in a few years. It is a\r\ncomparatively easy task for shrewd and unscrupulous men, assisted by\r\nable counsel and unlimited wealth, to evade the spirit of the law and to\r\nobey its letter, or to violate even both its letter and spirit, and\r\nescape punishment by making it impossible for the State to obtain proof\r\nof their guilt.\r\n\r\nIt is a humiliating spectacle to see the self-debased railroad officials\r\nconfessing their own guilt by refusing to testify before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission on the ground that they would thereby criminate\r\nthemselves. Congress should have sufficient respect for this commission\r\nand for itself to provide a way to punish such recusant witnesses who\r\nare willing to degrade themselves in so base a manner. Whether the law\r\nwill eventually be respected by all depends upon the vigilance and\r\ncourage of the people.\r\n\r\nThat our railroad legislation is not yet perfect even its friends will\r\nadmit; and as under a free government the demand of an enlightened\r\npublic opinion is the first step toward the enactment of a law, it\r\nbehooves the intelligent citizen to study the various railroad problems\r\nand to then exert his influence toward bringing about such a solution of\r\nthem as justice and wisdom demand.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the various evils of railroad management, the author will\r\ncommence with and dwell more particularly upon those abuses which maybe\r\nsaid to be the cardinal ones, viz., discrimination, extortion,\r\ncombinations and stock and bond inflation. When these are once\r\neffectually eradicated, other abuses of railroad management which have\r\nbeen the subject of public complaint will not long survive them.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest arguments that could be adduced by the founders of\r\nthe American Constitution in favor of the establishment of a more\r\nperfect union was that the inequality of taxes placed upon commerce by\r\nthe various States was a serious obstacle to its free development. Much\r\nas the individual States dislike to give up a part of their sovereignty\r\nto a central or national power, the demand for a common and uniform\r\nsystem of commercial taxation was so great that they were forced to\r\nyield and ratify the new Constitution. Our forefathers thus considered\r\nit a dangerous policy to permit a single State to lay any imposts upon\r\nthe commercial commodities which passed over its borders. They were\r\nrightly of the opinion that industrial and commercial liberty was as\r\nessential to the welfare of the nation as political freedom and that\r\ntherefore interstate commerce should not be hemmed in or controlled\r\nwithin State lines, but that the power to regulate it should be lodged\r\nin the supreme legislative authority of the nation, the Congress of the\r\nUnited States. For over half a century Congress alone exercised the\r\npower thus conferred upon it by the people. After the introduction of\r\nrailroads, however, their managers gradually assumed the right to\r\nregulate the commerce of the country in their own interest through the\r\nadoption of arbitrary freight tariffs. Freight charges are practically a\r\ntax which follows the commodity from the producer to the consumer. An\r\narbitrary and unjust charge is therefore an arbitrary and unjust tax\r\nimposed upon the public without its consent. It is a well-established\r\nrule of society that laws should be equitable and just to all citizens.\r\nCongress never assumed the role of Providence by attempting to equalize\r\nthose differences among individuals which superior intellect, greater\r\nindustry and a thousand other uncontrollable forces have ever created\r\nand will ever create. It has been reserved to railroad managers to\r\ndemonstrate to the public that a power has been allowed to grow up which\r\nhas assumed the right to counteract the dispensations of Providence, to\r\nenrich the slothful, to impoverish the industrious, to curtail the\r\nprofits of remunerative industries and revive by bounties those\r\nlanguishing for want of vitality, to humble proud and self-reliant marts\r\nof trade and to build up cities in the desert. It will scarcely be\r\nclaimed even by railroad managers that their policy of thus arbitrarily\r\nregulating commerce originated in philanthropic motives. They are forced\r\nto admit that it grew out of an attempt to increase the income of\r\nrailroads by the extension of favors to naturally weak enterprises and\r\nto recoup by overtaxing stronger ones.\r\n\r\nThe practical operation of this system soon showed to railroad managers\r\ntheir power and to the patrons of railroads their dependence upon those\r\nwho dispensed railroad favors. The former soon discovered that their\r\npower might be used to further their private interests as well as those\r\nof the roads, and unscrupulous patrons were not slow to offer\r\nconsiderations for favors which they coveted. When such favors were once\r\ngranted by the officials of one road, rival roads would grant similar\r\nones in self-protection. Thus this vicious system grew until the payment\r\nof a regular tariff rate was rather the exception than the rule, and\r\nspecial rates became an indispensable condition of success in business.\r\n\r\nWe may distinguish three classes of railroad discriminations, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Those which affect certain individuals.\r\n\r\n2. Those which affect certain localities.\r\n\r\n3. Those which affect certain branches of business.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination between individuals is the most objectionable, because it\r\nis the most demoralizing of all. Where such discrimination obtains,\r\nevery shipper is in the power of the railroad corporation. It makes of\r\nindependent citizens of a free country fawning parasites and obsequious\r\nsycophants who accept favors from railroad managers and in return do\r\ntheir bidding, however humiliating this may be. The shipper, realizing\r\nthat the manager's displeasure or good will toward him finds practical\r\nexpression in his daily freight bills, finally loses, like the serf, all\r\nself-esteem in his efforts to propitiate an overbearing master. He is\r\nintimidated to such an extent that he never speaks openly of existing\r\nabuses, lest he lose the special rates which have been given him, or, if\r\nhe is not a participant of such privileges, lest additional favors be\r\ngiven to his rivals and they be thus enabled to crush him. Intimidation\r\nof shippers prevailed to such an extent previous to the enactment of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law that when, in 1879, the special committee on\r\nrailroads appointed by the legislature of New York invited all persons\r\nhaving grievances against railroads to come before them to testify, not\r\none shipper testified voluntarily. On the contrary, they all insisted\r\nupon being subpoenaed, hoping that the railroad managers would not\r\nhold them responsible for any statement which they might be compelled to\r\nmake under such circumstances. The report of that committee stated that\r\nthe number of special contracts in force within the period of one year\r\non the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad alone was estimated\r\nby the railroad people at 6,000. Mr. Depew, when he made the statement:\r\n\"In territories comparatively new, and with little responsibility on the\r\npart of the managers to distant owners, they became in many cases very\r\narbitrary and exercised favoritism and discriminations, which led to\r\npopular indignation and legislation,\" had probably not heard of this.\r\nThe committee's report further stated that these special rates conformed\r\nto no system and varied without rule, that every application for a\r\nspecial rate was judged by itself and with reference to its own peculiar\r\ncircumstances, and that it depended upon the judgment, or rather\r\ncaprice, of the officer to whom the application was made, whether and to\r\nwhat extent a special rate should be granted. The reductions made to\r\nprivileged merchants often amounted to more than what would be a fair\r\nprofit to the dealer on the commodities shipped. The privileged dealer\r\nwas thus enabled to undersell his rivals and eventually force them out\r\nof business or into bankruptcy. It was not at all uncommon for railroad\r\ncompanies to allow discounts amounting to 50, 60, 70 and even 80 per\r\ncent. of the regular rates. The New York Central gave a Utica dry-goods\r\nmerchant a special rate of 9 cents while the regular rate was 33 cents\r\non first-class freights. The lowest special rate granted at Syracuse was\r\nas low as 20 per cent. of the regular tariff rate on first-class goods.\r\nDavid Dows & Company and Jesse Hoyt & Company, by means of a grain rate\r\nfrom 2-1/2 to 5 cents lower than those given to other firms, were\r\nenabled to control in the winter of 1877 the grain trade of New York.\r\nThe railroad even extended its fostering aid to A. T. Stewart & Co.,\r\ngiving them a special rate \"to build up and develop their business.\" The\r\ntestimony given by Mr. Goodman, assistant general freight agent of the\r\nNew York Central, in reference to the principle by which he was guided\r\nin granting special rates, is of sufficient interest to be given a place\r\nhere:\r\n\r\nQuestion. You made the rate for A. T. Stewart & Company? Answer. Yes,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nQ. Was that to build up and develop their business? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. That was the object? A. That was one of the objects.\r\n\r\nQ. January 11th, 1879? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. You thought that business was not yet sufficiently built up and\r\ndeveloped? A. No, sir; not the manufacturing part of it.\r\n\r\nQ. How long had the factories of A. T. Stewart & Company been in\r\nexistence? A. The one at Duchess Junction about three years, I think; it\r\nisn't completed yet.\r\n\r\nQ. And they were languishing and suffering? A. To a great extent; yes,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nQ. And you acted as a fostering mother to A. T. Stewart & Company to\r\nbuild it up? A. Yes, sir; I added my mite to develop their traffic; we\r\nwanted to carry the freight; boats might have carried it in the summer.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you know anything of G. C. Buell & Company? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. You wanted to develop their business? A. Yes, sir; they are at\r\nRochester--wholesale dealers.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you know H. S. Ballou, of Rochester? A. I do not.\r\n\r\nQ. He seems to be a grocer there? A. A small concern, perhaps.\r\n\r\nQ. Small concerns are not worth developing, according to your opinion?\r\nA. Our tariff rates are low enough for them at Rochester.\r\n\r\nQ. That is to say, a small concern ought to pay 40, 30, 25 and 20, as\r\nagainst a large concern, 13; that is your rule? A. Well, if he is a\r\ngrocer, most of his business is fourth-class freight.\r\n\r\nQ. And he ought to pay 20, as against 13? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. That small man has no right to develop? A. He has the same chance\r\nthat the other man has.\r\n\r\nQ. At 20 against 13? A. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you call that the same chance? A. About the same chance, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. You consider it the same chance? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMany reasons were assigned by railroad men in justification of their\r\npractices. It was claimed that special rates were given to regular\r\nshippers, but it has been proved that not all regular shippers had\r\nspecial rates, and that persons who made only single shipments were\r\noften fortunate enough to obtain special favors. It was further claimed\r\nthat special rates were given to those who, starting out new in business\r\nor developing new enterprises, needed aid and encouragement. But it was\r\nshown on the other hand that the aid and encouragement thus given to\r\nsome bankrupted others, and in the end deprived the companies of more\r\nbusiness than their policy of discrimination brought them. Railroad\r\nmanagers also argued that they could afford to make lower rates on large\r\nshipments than on small ones for the same reasons that the wholesale\r\nmerchant can sell his goods for less than the retailer. But while this\r\nmay be a good reason why rates on car-load shipments should be lower\r\nthan rates on shipments in less than car-load lots, it is certainly no\r\ngood reason why five car-loads belonging to one shipper should be\r\ntransported the same distance for less than five carloads belonging to\r\nfive shippers. In the case of local shipments the car is scarcely ever\r\nloaded to its full capacity; one shipment after another is taken from it\r\nas the train moves along, and the car perhaps reaches its final\r\ndestination nearly, if not entirely, empty. The terminal charges are\r\nhere also largely increased, and it is but just that the shipper should\r\npay the additional cost of carrying and handling the goods. The case is\r\nentirely different when the railroad company carries five full carloads\r\nfrom one station of its line to another. Whether they have been loaded\r\nby one or five persons, whether they are consigned to one or five\r\npersons, matters little to the railroad company. It merely transports\r\nthe cars, and in either case its responsibility and its services are the\r\nsame. The car-load must therefore be accepted and is now generally\r\naccepted by the best railroad men as the unit of wholesale shipments,\r\nand any discrimination made in favor of large wholesale shippers is\r\narbitrary and unjust. In the shipment of some commodities, such as\r\nwheat, flour and coal, a small advantage in rates is sufficient to\r\nenable the favored shipper to \"freeze out\" all competitors. It is\r\ncertainly not to the interest of any railroad company to pursue such a\r\npolicy; for by driving small establishments out of the business it\r\nencourages monopoly, which almost invariably enhances prices and\r\ndecreases consumption. The railroad thus suffers in common with the\r\npublic the consequences of its short-sighted policy. That even railroad\r\nmanagers realize that these practices cannot be defended upon any\r\nprinciple of justice or equity is apparent from the fact that one of the\r\nnever-varying conditions of special rates is that they be kept secret. A\r\nspecimen of a special rate agreement which was placed before the New\r\nYork investigating committee is here presented to the reader:\r\n\r\n      \"This agreement, made and entered into this eighteenth day of\r\n      March, 1878, by and between the New York Central and Hudson\r\n      River Railroad Company, party of the first part, and\r\n      Schoellkopf & Mathews, of the city of Buffalo, N.Y., party of\r\n      the second part:\r\n\r\n      \"Witnesseth, That said party of the first part hath promised\r\n      and agreed, and by these presents does promise and agree to\r\n      transport wheat from the elevator in Buffalo, reached directly\r\n      by said first party's tracks, except at such mills as time\r\n      said tracks may be obstructed by snow or ice, to the which\r\n      said second party may erect or operate at Niagara Falls, N. Y.,\r\n      at and for the rate of one and a quarter cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n      \"And further, that said first party shall and will at all\r\n      times give, grant and allow to said second parties as low\r\n      rate of transportation on all property shipped by them from\r\n      their said mills at Niagara Falls, and as favorable facilities\r\n      and accommodation in all respects as are afforded by the party\r\n      of the first part to the millers of Buffalo and Black Rock.\r\n      And also that the said party of the first part will transport\r\n      for said second party all of their east-bound New York freight\r\n      at and for the price or rate of forty-seven per cent. of the\r\n      current all-rail through rates, via the route of party of the\r\n      first part, from Chicago to New York, at the times of shipment,\r\n      adding thereto three cents per barrel for flour and one and\r\n      one-half cents per hundred pounds for mill feed or grain, as\r\n      a terminal charge, to provide for the incidental expenses\r\n      attending local transportation.\r\n\r\n      \"And will transport their freight to Boston and all points in\r\n      New England, taking Boston rates at the same rate as to New\r\n      York, with ten cents per barrel added for flour and five cents\r\n      per hundred pounds added for mill feed or grain.\r\n\r\n      \"Provided, however, and this agreement is made upon the express\r\n      understanding and consideration, that said second party shall\r\n      regard and treat this agreement as confidential, and will use\r\n      all reasonable precaution to keep the same secret.\r\n\r\n      \"And upon condition also that said second party shall ship\r\n      by the first party's road all the product from their mill at\r\n      Niagara Falls destined to all points in New York, Pennsylvania\r\n      and New England, reached by said first party, directly or by\r\n      connections with other routes.\r\n\r\n      \"And this agreement shall be and remain in force for the term\r\n      of five years from and following the first day of September,\r\n      1878, after which period it may be terminated by sixty days'\r\n      written notice from either party.\r\n\r\n      \"In witness whereof, the parties hereto have signed these\r\n      presents the day and year first above written.\r\n\r\n      \"N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. Co.,\r\n      By J. H. RUTLER,\r\n      General Traffic Manager.\r\n      SCHOELLKOPF & MATHEWS.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that this agreement was based upon the expressed\r\ncondition that Schoellkopf & Mathews treat it as \"confidential,\" and use\r\nall reasonable precaution to keep it secret. It is difficult to account\r\nfor this strong injunction of secrecy except upon the assumption that\r\nthe managers of the road, conscious of the great wrong which they\r\ninflicted upon the body of the people by their discriminations, hoped to\r\nescape public criticism by adopting a policy of secret dealing. Much as\r\nspecial rates were sought after, but few shippers to whom they had been\r\ngranted were contented with their lot, for none was confident that his\r\nrivals did not have better rates than himself.\r\n\r\nDiscriminations between localities had their origin in the natural\r\ndesire of competing roads to increase their business at the expense of\r\ntheir rivals. When two or more railroads touched the same point each\r\nwould attempt to secure the largest possible share of the through\r\nbusiness by holding out every possible inducement in rates to the\r\nshippers of that place. Indeed, the freight rates at competitive points\r\nwere often so low that railroad managers found themselves placed in a\r\nrather unpleasant dilemma. They either had to admit that the rates\r\ncharged by them at non-competitive places were exorbitant or that they\r\nwere carrying the freights of competitive points at a loss and were thus\r\nsquandering the money of their stockholders. They preferred as a rule\r\nto admit that they were doing competitive business at a loss, but\r\nasserted that, inasmuch as they were compelled to run their trains, they\r\ncould better afford to do competitive business temporarily at a loss\r\nthan not to do it at all. The same logic might with equal propriety be\r\nemployed by the grocer. To draw to him distant customers, he might offer\r\nto sell to them at cost or even at a loss; and then, to recuperate, he\r\nmight advance the prices of his goods for his regular customers. If\r\nthere is any difference between the grocer and the railroad company, it\r\nlies in the fact that the former's old customers would soon find relief\r\nat a rival store, while the patrons of the railroad at non-competitive\r\npoints are like the traveler in the hands of a highwayman, without\r\nimmediate redress. The railway company which discriminates between\r\ncompetitive and non-competitive points forgets that its line is a common\r\nhighway for all points tributary to it; that all have equal rights, and\r\nthat the only differences in tariff which the principles of the common\r\nlaw permit are those which arise from a difference of service and cost.\r\nAll other differences that railroad companies may make are unjust\r\ndiscriminations in violation of their charter and expose them to a\r\nforfeiture of the franchises conferred upon them.\r\n\r\nThe nature and extent of the discrimination practiced between different\r\nplaces are often such that no interest of the company can possibly be\r\nsubserved by them, and the conclusion is forced upon us that the\r\nadvantages granted by railroad managers to certain places are designed\r\nto serve chiefly personal and selfish interests. The great fortunes\r\namassed in a brief period of time by railroad managers can in almost\r\nevery case be traced to stock, real estate, commercial and other\r\nspeculations directly or indirectly connected with railroad\r\nconstruction or management. And where other than personal interest\r\ncannot be shown, this is the only basis upon which the many apparent\r\nabsurdities of railroad discrimination can be harmonized.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by railroad men that transportation by water is a\r\nregulator of railway rates which they must respect. It is contended, for\r\ninstance, that, although the cities situated on our large lakes enjoy\r\nsuperior commercial advantages which are mainly due to their having at\r\ntheir disposal water communication with the Atlantic Ocean, inland towns\r\nhave no cause to complain against the railroads for not equalizing those\r\ndifferences which nature has largely created. It might be more difficult\r\nto meet this argument if, owing to peculiar combinations, these water\r\nrates were not made to extend their influence to almost every inland\r\ncity north, east and south in the Union, and if those cities were not\r\ngiven much lower rates than hundreds of places much nearer the lakes.\r\nThe teamster who, half a century ago, found it impossible to compete\r\nwith the canal, river or lake boats, simply surrendered the field to\r\nthem and confined his operations to such a territory as could give him\r\nassurance of a profitable business. Let the railroads do likewise. No\r\ncompany has a right to destroy a rival route, water or rail, by adopting\r\nspecial tariffs for competing points. There are at points accessible to\r\nwater transportation certain freights requiring speedy carriage which\r\nwill go to the railroads at profitable rates, but the heavier freights,\r\nas coal, lumber and even certain kinds of grain, should go to the\r\ncarrier by water if he can afford to transport them at lower cost.\r\n\r\nThere have been but few legislative investigations of railroad abuses in\r\nthis country, but the disclosures which they have made to the public\r\nare astounding. The most noteworthy of these were made by the Hepburn\r\ncommittee, of New York, to which reference has already been made. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how a free and enlightened community could so\r\nlong and so patiently bear railroad despotism. Individual discrimination\r\nmight, under the veil of secrecy, long escape notice, but that a system\r\nof open and widespread discrimination affecting every non-competitive\r\nand even many a competitive point in the State, doing visible and\r\nirreparable injury to thousands of shippers, and infringing upon the\r\nrights of millions, should long be borne by a free and enlightened\r\npeople, is a strange phenomenon of democratic endurance.\r\n\r\nIt would lead us too far from our subject to review in detail the many\r\nand glaring instances of local discrimination which the report\r\nenumerates. A few will suffice to show their scope and nature.\r\n\r\nWilliam W. Mack, of Rochester, a manufacturer of edged tools, testified\r\nthat, in order to save fourteen cents per hundredweight on his freights\r\nto Cincinnati, he shipped his goods to New York and had them shipped\r\nfrom there to their destination, via Rochester; and that he availed\r\nhimself of the same roundabout route for his St. Louis shipments, and\r\nsaved thereby eighteen cents per hundredweight. In both of these cases\r\nthe railroad company carried the goods 700 miles farther than the direct\r\ndistance for a less charge.\r\n\r\nPort Jervis millers had their grain shipped from the West to Newburgh, a\r\npoint fifty miles to the east of them, and then had it returned to Port\r\nJervis on the same line, at a less rate than that charged for a direct\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThe grain rates from Chicago to Pittsburgh were 25 cents per hundred in\r\nMarch, 1878, and only 15 cents from Chicago to New York.\r\n\r\nFlour was carried from Milwaukee to New York for 20 cents, while the\r\nrate from Rochester to New York was 30 cents at the same time. It was\r\nalso carried from East St. Louis to Troy at the same rate as from\r\nRochester to Troy. The rate on butter from St. Lawrence County, N.Y., to\r\nBoston, over the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain and Vermont Central, was\r\n60 cents per hundred; from the nearer county of Franklin, 70 cents; it\r\nthen continued to increase as the distance decreased, until it reached\r\n90 cents at St. Albans, Vermont.\r\n\r\nSoap shipped by Babbit & Co., of New York, to Crouse & Co., of Syracuse,\r\npaid 8 cents per box when the freight was paid in Syracuse, but 12 cents\r\nper box when paid by the shipper in New York.\r\n\r\nIt cannot even be said that New York fared worse than any of her sister\r\nStates. There is hardly a business man in any community in the United\r\nStates who cannot cite many cases of similar discrimination. Hundreds of\r\nwell authenticated cases have been reported from every part of the\r\ncountry. A few striking ones may be given space here:\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Central Company hauled cotton from Memphis to New Orleans,\r\na distance of 450 miles, at $1.00 a bale, while the rate from Winona,\r\nMiss., to New Orleans, about two-thirds of the distance, was $3.25 a\r\nbale. The same company charged for fourth-class freight from Chicago to\r\nKankakee, a distance of 56 miles, 16 cents per hundred, and only 10\r\ncents to Mattoon, 116 miles farther. The rate from New York to Ogden was\r\n$4.65 per hundred, and only $2.25 per hundred from New York to San\r\nFrancisco. The car-load rate on the Northern Pacific was $200 from New\r\nYork to Portland and just twice as much to a number of points from 100\r\nto 125 miles east of Portland. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy hauled\r\nstock from points beyond the Missouri River to Chicago for $30 per\r\ncar-load, while it exacted $70 per car in Southwestern Iowa for a much\r\nshorter haul.\r\n\r\nTo what extent local discrimination has been carried by railroad\r\ncompanies is well illustrated by the following incident: A nurseryman\r\nresiding at Atlantic, Iowa, a station on the Chicago, Rock Island and\r\nPacific Railroad, 60 miles east of Council Bluffs, bought a car-load of\r\ngrapevines at Fredonia, New York. Finding that the through rate from\r\nFredonia to Council Bluffs, plus the local rate from the latter place to\r\nAtlantic, was less than the rate for the direct shipment from Fredonia\r\nto Atlantic, he caused the car to be consigned to Council Bluffs,\r\nintending to have it thence hauled back to Atlantic. Being short of\r\nstock at the time the train containing his car passed through his town\r\non its way to Council Bluffs, the consignee prevailed upon the station\r\nagent to set out his car. In due time he received a request from the\r\ngeneral office of the railroad to pay an amount equal to the rate per\r\ncar-load from Council Bluffs to Atlantic. The request was promptly\r\ncomplied with by the appreciative nurseryman, who after all had been\r\nsaved an annoying delay by the courtesy of the company's agent.\r\n\r\nAn infinite number of similar discriminations might be cited. They all\r\nshow the same violation of the fundamental principles of justice and\r\nequity, the same despotical assertion of the power of the railroads to\r\nregulate the commerce of the country as the caprice or selfish interests\r\nof their managers might direct.\r\n\r\nDiscriminations between commodities, or, as they might also be called,\r\ndiscriminations in classification, are probably the most common of\r\nunjust railroad practices. For the purpose of establishing as near as\r\nmay be uniform rules in all matters pertaining to rates, the various\r\nroads operating in a certain territory usually form traffic\r\nassociations. The general freight agents of the roads that are members\r\nof the association in turn form a select body known as the rate\r\ncommittee. These committees of freight agents have for more than twenty\r\nyears constituted the supreme authority in all matters pertaining to\r\nfreight classification. The trunk line classification recognizes six\r\nregular and two special classes, and every article known to commerce is\r\nplaced in one of these classes. One whom Providence has not favored with\r\nthe mysterious wisdom of a general freight agent might suppose that\r\nconsiderations of bulk, weight, insurance and similar factors formed a\r\nbasis of railroad classification. Nothing, however, is farther from the\r\ntruth. Freight charges, when permitted to be fixed by railroad\r\ncompanies, are invariably such as the traffic will bear, and freight\r\nclassifications are arranged on this principle, provided competition by\r\nwater, rail or other land transportation does not demand a modification.\r\nIt is, as a rule, not to the advantage of a railroad to entirely starve\r\nout any commercial or industrial concern along its line. Hence tariffs\r\nare scarcely ever made entirely prohibitory. Railroads proceed here upon\r\nthe principle of the robber knight of mediæval times, who simply\r\nplundered the wayfaring trader to such an extent as to reduce his\r\nprofits to a minimum. He never stripped him, for by doing so he would\r\nhave prevented his return and would have destroyed his own source of\r\nrevenue. In like manner a railroad will never annihilate any weak branch\r\nof business along its line, nor will it, if it is in its power, permit\r\nany business to prosper without paying to it heavy tributes out of its\r\nprofits. Every commodity is therefore made to pay a transportation tax\r\nbased chiefly on its value and the profit which it yields, and all\r\nclassifications are prepared with this object in view.\r\n\r\nThe protection which, through exceptionally low rates, is extended by\r\nthe railroad companies to certain industries, may not be objectionable\r\n_per se_, but the question arises whether the railroad companies or the\r\npeople should exercise the right to determine when and where such\r\nprotection is necessary. Moreover, to tax one branch of commerce for the\r\nbenefits bestowed upon another is a practice of extremely doubtful\r\npropriety, and the power to do so should certainly never be conferred\r\nupon a private corporation. When customs laws are proposed in Congress\r\nample opportunity is given to the representatives of the various\r\nindustries of the country to be heard upon the subject. No hasty step is\r\ntaken. Members of Congress have every opportunity to ascertain the\r\nsentiment of their constituents, through the public press, petitions and\r\nprivate correspondence. The subject is discussed in all its phases, both\r\nin the committee-rooms and upon the floors of both houses of Congress.\r\nEvery detail is fully considered, and many compromises are often\r\nnecessary to secure for a bill the support of the majority. When it\r\nfinally passes it represents the will of the people, or at least the\r\nwill of their legal representatives, who may be expected to know their\r\nwants and are accountable to them for their acts. Freight\r\nclassifications, however, while they are fully as far-reaching as\r\ncustoms laws, are made by a few freight agents meeting in secret\r\nsession, listening to no advice and acknowledging no higher authority.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the railroad men that it is to the interest of railroad\r\ncompanies to do justice to all, and that the best classification for\r\nthe largest number of people is also the best for the roads. If this be\r\ntrue, it is difficult to see why railroads should fail to consult their\r\npatrons in the arrangement of their freight classifications. Intelligent\r\nshippers may certainly be supposed to know as well as the railroad\r\ncompanies what classification is to their common interest. Railroad\r\nmanagers are naturally despotical. They do not wish and do not tolerate\r\nany outside interference with what they obstinately term their private\r\nbusiness. Even if the general policy of the companies designed the\r\ngreatest good to the greatest number, the opportunities and temptations\r\nof their agents to pursue selfish ends or take advantage of individuals\r\nin the preparation or application of their tariffs are such that in the\r\npractical execution the evil will always outweigh the good.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of the present inquiry to review in detail\r\nthe various classifications in force, or to point out the unjust\r\nfeatures. The author will confine himself to showing by a few\r\ncharacteristic examples that the power now in the hands of the railroad\r\ncompanies to classify the various commodities of commerce for the\r\npurpose of rating is greatly abused and is a potent means of railroad\r\nextortion. And that it may not be charged that abuses have been cited\r\nwhich are a thing of the past, the examples will chiefly be taken from\r\ncases which have come before the Interstate Commission for adjudication.\r\n\r\nA complaint was filed with the commission in 1887 by T. J. Reynolds\r\nagainst the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad Company, from\r\nwhich it appeared that that company charged a greater price for the\r\ntransportation of railroad ties from points in the State of Pennsylvania\r\nto points in the State of New York than was charged at the same time\r\nfor the transportation of lumber between the same points. The commission\r\nheld that this was a case of unjustifiable discrimination and ordered\r\nthe company to place railroad ties in the same class with other rough\r\nlumber. Many Western roads for years have been guilty of the same\r\ndiscrimination. The reasons for such a policy are obvious. A high tariff\r\non railroad ties prevents their being shipped, depreciates their market\r\nprice at home, to the sole benefit of the discriminating company, which\r\nis thus enabled to buy ties at a low price. Prohibitory rates on ties\r\nand rails are also often maintained by railroad companies to either\r\ndelay or render more costly the construction of new lines which threaten\r\nto become their competitors. The Union Pacific Railroad Company several\r\nyears ago even went so far as to make prohibitory rates on steel rails\r\nintended for the construction of a road which promised to become a\r\ncompetitor of one of its connecting lines.\r\n\r\nFrom another case decided by the Interstate Commerce Commission it\r\nappeared that the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company\r\ncharged for blocks intended for wagon-hubs, and upon which only so much\r\nlabor had been expended as was necessary to put them in condition, a\r\nhigher rate than for lumber, claiming that such blocks were unfinished\r\nwagon material and were therefore, as articles of manufacture, subject\r\nto higher charges than raw material. The commission justly held that\r\nthese blocks were as much to be regarded as raw material as the boards\r\nfrom which wagon-boxes are made.\r\n\r\nIn the classification of the Southern Railway and Steamship Association\r\npearline was placed in the fourth class, with a rate of 73 cents per\r\nhundred pounds, and common soap in the sixth class, with a rate of 49\r\ncents per hundred pounds. This latter article, when shipped by large\r\nmanufacturers, enjoyed besides a special rate of 33 cents per\r\nhundredweight. Pearline and soap are competitive; there is no\r\nappreciable difference between them as regards the cost of\r\ntransportation; but one commands a higher price in the market than the\r\nother, and upon this fact solely did the railroad company base its\r\nalleged right to levy upon pearline a transportation tax 120 per cent.\r\nin excess of that levied upon soap, though the service rendered by the\r\ncompany was the same in either case. The commission held that the\r\ndiscrimination made by the \"special rate\" of the Southern Railway and\r\nSteamship Association between pearline and common soap was unjust, and\r\nordered that it be discontinued and that, with common soap in the sixth\r\nclass, pearline be placed in the fifth.\r\n\r\nFor years the rate from Indianapolis to New York was the same for corn\r\nas for its direct products, such as ground corn, cracked corn, corn\r\nmeal, hominy and corn feed. Such a tariff made it possible for Western\r\nmills to compete with similar mills that had been established in the\r\nEast, since a discrimination of 5 per cent. was sufficient to absorb\r\nthree or four times the profits of any Western mill. It was shown by the\r\nevidence produced that the actual cost of transportation was\r\nsubstantially the same for direct corn products as for the raw corn. The\r\nonly defense which the railroad company could make for this\r\ndiscrimination was that in the carriage of raw corn they had to meet\r\nlake competition. The weakness of this argument will be perceived when\r\nit is remembered that Indianapolis is 154 miles from the nearest\r\nlake-shipping point. There is but little doubt that this discrimination\r\nwas made by the railroad company because it was to its interest to haul\r\nthe raw corn from the West to the East and to return it in altered\r\nform. Railroads care, as a rule, little for a waste of force, if such\r\nwaste is to their own advantage.\r\n\r\nIn another case brought before the commission in 1889 it was shown that\r\nthe \"Official Classification\" placed common soap in carload lots in\r\nClass V, while such articles as coffee, pickles, salted and smoked fish\r\nin boxes or packages, rice, starch in barrels or boxes, sugar, cereal\r\nline and cracked wheat are placed in Class VI. The chief reply of the\r\nrailroad companies to this complaint was that soap was justly placed in\r\nClass V because the components from which it is in part made stood in\r\nClass V.\r\n\r\nIn another case it was shown that one kind of soap was burdened with a\r\nhigher transportation tax than another, irrespective even of cost,\r\nbecause one had been advertised as toilet and the other as laundry soap.\r\n\r\nThe principle of charging what the traffic will bear is well illustrated\r\nby the relative rates on patent medicines and ale and beer, as\r\nmaintained by the Official Classification.\r\n\r\nIn a complaint made by a prominent manufacturer of proprietary medicines\r\nagainst the New York Central and other roads, it was shown that the\r\ncomplainant's products were shipped at owner's risk, and that they were\r\nin bulk and intrinsic value similar to ale and beer, but that in spite\r\nof these analogies the former were rated as first-class and the latter\r\nas third-class goods, simply because they retailed at a higher price.\r\n\r\nAnother unwarrantable discrimination is that in favor of live stock and\r\nagainst dressed beef. While Mr. Fink, the commissioner of the Trunk Line\r\nPool, himself admitted that the cost of carrying dressed beef from\r\nChicago to New York was only 6-1/4 cents per 100 pounds in excess of\r\nthe cost of hauling live stock, the trunk lines maintained on dressed\r\nbeef a rate 75 per cent. higher than that on live cattle. The railroad\r\ncompanies asserted that this was due to those people in the East whose\r\nliving depended on the live-stock interest. The railroads have in this\r\nassumed a paternalism which would not be tolerated even in the\r\nGovernment. To protect the East, railroads will not permit the West to\r\nengage in new industries.\r\n\r\nThe position which the Interstate Commerce Commission has assumed in\r\ninterpreting the rights of shippers under the law which railroad\r\ncompanies are bound to respect in the preparation of their tariff sheets\r\nand classifications cannot but be most gratifying to the people. In a\r\ndecision relating to the classification and rates for car-loads and less\r\nthan car-loads, filed March 14, 1890, the commission laid down the\r\nfollowing rules for the guidance of railroad companies:\r\n\r\n      \"1. Classification of freight for transportation purposes is\r\n      in terms recognized by the act to regulate commerce, and is\r\n      therefore lawful. It is also a valuable convenience both to\r\n      shippers and carriers.\r\n\r\n      \"2. A classification of freight designating different\r\n      classes for car-load quantities and for less than car-load\r\n      quantities for transportation at a lower rate in car-loads\r\n      than in less than car-loads is not in contravention of the\r\n      act to regulate commerce. The circumstances and conditions\r\n      of the transportation in respect to the work done by the\r\n      carrier and the revenue earned are dissimilar, and may\r\n      justify a reasonable difference in rate. The public\r\n      interests are subserved by car-load classification of\r\n      property that, on account of the volume transported to reach\r\n      markets or supply the demands of trade throughout the\r\n      country, legitimately or usually moves in such quantities.\r\n\r\n      \"3. Carriers are not at liberty to classify property as a\r\n      basis of transportation rates and impose charges for its\r\n      carriage with exclusive regard to their own interests, but\r\n      they must respect the interests of those who may have\r\n      occasion to employ their services, and conform their charges\r\n      to the rules of relative equality and justice which the act\r\n      prescribes.\r\n\r\n      \"4. Cost of service is an important element in fixing\r\n      transportation charges and entitled to fair consideration,\r\n      but is not alone controlling nor so applied in practice by\r\n      carriers, and the value of the service to the property\r\n      carried is an essential factor to be recognized in\r\n      connection with other considerations. The public interests\r\n      are not to be subordinated to those of carriers, and require\r\n      proper regard for the value of the service in the\r\n      apportionment of all charges upon traffic.\r\n\r\n      \"5. A difference in rates upon car-loads and less than\r\n      car-loads of the same merchandise, between the same points\r\n      of carriage, so wide as to be destructive to competition\r\n      between large and small dealers, especially upon articles of\r\n      general and necessary use, and which, under existing\r\n      conditions of trade furnish a large volume of business to\r\n      carriers, is unjust and violates the provisions and\r\n      principles of the act.\r\n\r\n      \"6. A difference in rate for a solid car-load of one kind of\r\n      freight from one consignor to one consignee, and a carload\r\n      quantity from the same point of shipment to the same\r\n      destination, consisting of like freight or freight of like\r\n      character, from more than one consignor to one consignee or\r\n      from one consignor to more than one consignee, is not\r\n      justified by the difference in cost of handling.\r\n\r\n      \"7. Under the official classification the articles known in\r\n      trade as grocery articles are so classified as to\r\n      discriminate unjustly in rates between car-loads and less\r\n      than car-loads upon many articles, and a revision of the\r\n      classification and rates to correct unjust differences and\r\n      give these respective modes of shipment more relatively\r\n      reasonable rates is necessary and is so ordered.\"\r\n\r\nThe efforts which the commission has made to bring about a uniform\r\nclassification throughout the country are in the right direction, while\r\nthe results of its labor are not yet satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn their fifth annual report, the Commissioners, after giving an account\r\nof their efforts and the shuffling and double-dealing of the railroad\r\ncompanies with them upon this matter of uniform classification, said:\r\n\r\n      \"Its conviction remains unchanged that the necessities of\r\n      commerce require that the existing classifications be\r\n      consolidated, and that this result should be accomplished as\r\n      speedily as may be found practicable; and it does not feel\r\n      justified in asking for the further efforts of the carriers\r\n      the same measure of indulgence which from time to time it\r\n      has heretofore suggested should be extended to them, and\r\n      which was thought to be required in the public interest.\r\n\r\n      \"The commission can not but think that if legislation to\r\n      that end be enacted by Congress the carriers will speedily\r\n      consummate the reform already begun in this direction. It is\r\n      therefore recommended that an act be passed requiring the\r\n      adoption within one year from the date of its passage of a\r\n      uniform classification of freight by all the carriers,\r\n      subject to the act to regulate commerce, and providing that\r\n      if the same be not adopted within the time limited, either\r\n      this commission or some other public authority be required\r\n      to adopt and enforce a uniform classification.\"\r\n\r\nThe present confusion which exists in the classification and rates of\r\nthe seventeen hundred railroad organizations of the country makes it\r\ndifficult for the commission to do justice to all interests and\r\nlocalities. With the adoption of a uniform classification it is to be\r\nhoped that in time many of the present inequalities will be adjusted,\r\nespecially if an intelligent public sentiment upon the subject of\r\nrailroad regulation is maintained. A prominent railroad manager in the\r\nEast, whose devotion to corporate interest is only equaled by his\r\npolitical ambition, has recently made repeated efforts to convince the\r\npeople that railroad abuses are things of the past and that, if any such\r\nabuses still linger in isolated districts, they are simply unavoidable\r\nexceptions to the rule which will soon have to yield to the general\r\nspirit of fairness and amity for which, in his opinion, the railroads\r\nhave of late been distinguished. He reasons that the law has fulfilled\r\nits mission, that the railroads have reformed, and that it now behooves\r\nthe people to relent and to extend to the much persecuted corporations\r\nthe hand of friendship and good will. The postprandial eloquence of this\r\ngentleman has often suavely intimated that the repeal of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act would be the most opportune recognition of restored\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nStill bolder champions of the railroad cause do not hesitate to demand\r\nthe repeal of the law. It is not likely that the sophistry of railroad\r\nhirelings will triumph over the practical logic of an intelligent\r\npublic. No law, be it ever so wise, can in the space of a few years\r\ncorrect all the abuses which half a century of unbridled railroad\r\ndomination has developed. Yet, since both the friends and the enemies of\r\nthe law agree that it has been partially successful in its operation, it\r\nshould be continued and improved to keep it in harmony with new\r\nconditions and a progressive public sentiment. It is claimed by railroad\r\nmanagers that the adoption of a uniform classification will remove the\r\nonly vestige of discrimination still left. This is not true, for by far\r\nthe largest number of complaints that have recently been brought before\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission charged personal and local\r\ndiscrimination independent of any question of classification.\r\n\r\nIt is shown by the reports of the commission that discriminations are\r\nstill practiced by various companies, that annual passes are still\r\nillegally issued to bribe or appease men of influence, that discounts\r\nare still given to favor shippers under various pretexts, that some\r\nlarge railroad centers still enjoy more favorable rates than smaller\r\ntowns, and that the long and short haul clause of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act is still violated by railroad companies. There are besides\r\nthese scores of other devices in vogue among railroad managers to\r\nsubvert the principles of the common law. No doubt discriminations are\r\nnow much less frequent, and are possibly the exception where but a few\r\nyears ago they were the rule, but the fact that such abuses still exist\r\nis a strong argument for the retention of the law as well as for the\r\nnecessity of continued vigilance on the part of the people and those\r\nespecially charged with the execution of the laws. The railroad acts of\r\nCongress and the various States ask nothing of common carriers but just\r\nand equitable treatment for all their patrons. If this is freely\r\naccorded, these laws are no burden to the railroads. If, on the other\r\nhand, there is a tendency on the part of the railroads to resort to\r\nsubterfuges and evasions, the wholesome restraint of the statute is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the protection of the shipper.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Interstate Commerce Law, or the adoption of such\r\namendments as are demanded by railroad men, would be interpreted by them\r\nas an abandonment of all its principles and would inaugurate an era of\r\nunprecedented railroad oppression. History ever repeats itself.\r\nUnchecked license will always lead to arrogance and despotism, and any\r\npower which is long permitted to defy the state will in time control it.\r\nIt is not likely that the people of the United States can be induced to\r\ndemonstrate to the world that democratic government is incapable of\r\nprofiting in the dear school of experience.\r\n\r\nOur railroad legislation contains no principle that is not found in the\r\ncommon law. Its maxims are our birthright and will be the birthright of\r\nour children and children's children, and while railroad companies may\r\nbe able in the future, as they have been in the past, to violate the law\r\ntemporarily with impunity, they will never be able to prevail upon the\r\nAmerican people to abandon the policy of railroad reform which the\r\npassage of the Interstate Commerce Law inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commissioners say in their sixth annual report:\r\n\r\n      \"Whoever will read the report of the special committee of\r\n      the United States Senate, commonly called the 'Cullom\r\n      Committee,' will be astounded at the magnitude and extent of\r\n      railroad abuses brought to light by their investigation.\r\n      Those unfamiliar with the facts made public at that time can\r\n      hardly believe the outrages which were proven to exist and\r\n      the manifold devices by which the most flagrant injustice\r\n      was perpetrated. A single illustration will furnish a better\r\n      reminder than extended comment.\r\n\r\n      \"It appears from that report that the Standard Oil Company,\r\n      in one instance at least, boldly demanded from a certain\r\n      railroad that its shipments should be carried for 10 cents a\r\n      barrel; that all other shippers should be charged 35 cents a\r\n      barrel on the same article, and that 25 cents of the 35 paid\r\n      by such other shippers should be handed over by the railroad\r\n      to the Standard Oil Company, and the penalty threatened for\r\n      non-compliance with this impudent extortion was a withdrawal\r\n      of its entire business.\r\n\r\n      \"The foregoing statements but imperfectly describe the\r\n      situation which existed when the Interstate Commerce Law was\r\n      enacted. In any reasonable view of the case it was too much\r\n      to expect that the common and long continued abuses of\r\n      railroad management could be corrected in less than half a\r\n      dozen years, or that the first scheme of legislative\r\n      regulation would prove adequate to that end. It would be\r\n      contrary to all experience if so great and radical a reform\r\n      could be thus speedily accomplished, or if the initial\r\n      statute should be found sufficient to bring it about. The\r\n      law was the outgrowth of an aroused and determined public\r\n      sentiment, which, while united in demanding Government\r\n      interference, was divided and uncertain as to the best\r\n      methods of affording relief. Like all attempts in a new\r\n      field of legislation, the statute was a compromise between\r\n      divergent theories and conflicting interests. It was\r\n      scarcely possible that it should be so complete and\r\n      comprehensive at the outset as to require no alteration or\r\n      amendment. Those who are familiar with the practices which\r\n      obtained prior to the passage of this law and contrast them\r\n      with the methods and conditions now existing will accord to\r\n      the present statute great influence in the direction of\r\n      necessary reforms and a high degree of usefulness in\r\n      promoting the public interest.\r\n\r\n      \"Whoever will candidly examine the reports of the commission\r\n      from year to year, and thus become acquainted with the work\r\n      which has been done and is now going on, will have no doubt\r\n      of the potential value of this enactment in correcting\r\n      public sentiment, restraining injustice and enforcing the\r\n      principle of reasonable charges and equal treatment.\r\n      Imperfections and weaknesses which could not be anticipated\r\n      at the time of its passage have since been disclosed by the\r\n      effort to give it effective administration. The test of\r\n      experience, so far from condemning the policy of public\r\n      regulation, has established its importance and intensified\r\n      its necessity. The very respects in which the existing law\r\n      has failed to meet public expectation point out the\r\n      advantages and demonstrate the utility of Government\r\n      supervision.\r\n\r\n      \"Moreover, it may be fairly claimed that much greater\r\n      benefits would have been realized had the statute as enacted\r\n      expressed the evident purpose of those who framed it, and\r\n      received a construction according to its apparent import. It\r\n      is not too much to say that judicial interpretation has\r\n      limited its scope and ascribed to it an intent not\r\n      contemplated when it was passed. If its supposed meaning, as\r\n      understood at the time of its passage, had been upheld by\r\n      the courts, it is believed that its operation would have\r\n      been much more effective and its usefulness greatly\r\n      increased. So far as failure has attended the efforts to\r\n      give it proper administration, that failure can be mainly\r\n      attributed to differences between its apparent meaning and\r\n      the judicial interpretation which some of its provisions\r\n      have received; and the commission is of the opinion that if\r\n      the present law could be so altered as to express clearly\r\n      and beyond doubt what it was evidently intended to express\r\n      at the time of its enactment, it would prove, even without\r\n      other amendment, an instrumentality of the highest value in\r\n      removing the evils against which it is aimed.\r\n\r\n      \"The specific instances in which the statute has received\r\n      judicial construction, and the limitations upon its scope\r\n      and meaning which the courts have imposed, will be alluded\r\n      to at greater length in another part of this report.\r\n\r\n      \"It seems proper, however, to observe in this connection\r\n      that the effect of these decisions in weakening the law and\r\n      preventing its enforcement has been greatly exaggerated. The\r\n      impression has been created in many directions that judicial\r\n      construction has invalidated the essential feature of the\r\n      statute and condemned the general principle which lies at\r\n      its foundation. That impression cannot be too speedily\r\n      corrected, for nothing has been decided which permits such\r\n      an inference. On the contrary, neither the power of the\r\n      national legislature to regulate the transportation of\r\n      interstate commerce nor the general policy of the existing\r\n      law has been questioned by any tribunal.\"\r\n\r\nProbably no law in the United States has ever before been so fiercely\r\nattacked at all of its vital points as has this law. It is not strange\r\nthat among the great number of National and State courts the railroad\r\ncompanies have found occasionally a judge ready and willing to assist\r\nthem in breaking it down, but upon the whole the judiciary has been\r\ndisposed to co-operate with other departments of the Government in their\r\nefforts to secure effective regulation of the transportation business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSTOCK AND BOND INFLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complaint is frequently heard from railroad men that our freight\r\nrates are too low, and in support of it the statement is usually made\r\nthat the greater part of the railroad stocks of the United States pays\r\ndividends considerably smaller than the average interest realized by\r\ncapitalists on money loaned or invested in other enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis statement may be true, and yet it is valueless as an argument for\r\nhigher rates. It may be admitted that the dividends declared upon the\r\nface values of railroad stocks are quite moderate, but it is a fact too\r\nwell authenticated to be contradicted that railroad securities represent\r\nto a considerable extent only fictitious capital. The public concedes\r\nthat liberal returns should be allowed to railroad companies on money\r\nactually invested, but it naturally objects to being taxed for the\r\npurpose of making dividends on watered stock. The evil referred to is a\r\nserious one, and has contributed much to the general demand for railroad\r\nreform. Most of the early roads of this country were built for the\r\naccommodation of local traffic. They were constructed and managed by\r\nbusiness men upon business principles. The stock issued by the companies\r\nwas in most cases paid for in full and was not unfrequently sufficient\r\nfor the completion of the entire road, and no incumbrance was permitted\r\nby the owners to be placed upon the property. These enterprises as a\r\nrule proved very profitable. One of the first roads running west of\r\nChicago will serve as an illustration. The Galena and Chicago Union\r\nRailroad Company paid a 10 per cent. dividend within a year after being\r\nopened to traffic, and gradually increased its dividends to 15, 20 and\r\n22 per cent. During the first two years of the road's operation its\r\nexpenses were only 38-1/2 per cent. of its earnings. During the second\r\nyear the company, after paying a 15 per cent. dividend, diminished its\r\ndebt nearly $60,000 and increased its surplus $11,700. In 1856 the road\r\nhad a length of 232 miles, on which the gross earnings amounted to\r\n$2,315,787. This revenue exceeded the estimate made by the company's\r\nofficers the year previous by $300,000. In his annual report for 1856\r\nthe president of the company said: \"This result shows an _increased\r\nsurplus_ of $65,000, after paying 22 per cent. in dividends and all\r\nexpenses and interests chargeable to income account.\" The report also\r\nshows that expensive improvements, such as large permanent bridges and\r\nstone culverts, displacing as a rule wooden ones, were charged to\r\ncurrent expenses.\r\n\r\nThe financial success of railroads soon attracted the cupidity of\r\nfinancial adventurers--men of great energy, but small means--whose aim\r\nwas to secure the greatest possible returns with the least possible\r\noutlay of money. With the introduction of these elements into railroad\r\ncircles the era of speculation commenced. Take the line just referred\r\nto. In 1852 the average number of miles operated was 62, and the year\r\nfollowing, 90. But while the number of miles operated increased less\r\nthan 50 per cent., the capital stock of the company grew from $444,193\r\nto $1,362,559, and its debt from $60,145 to $542,287. The capitalization\r\nof the road was thereby increased from $8,000 to $21,000 per mile, and\r\nthis was done for the purpose of making the capital appear adequate to\r\nits earnings. Nearly all railroads became in time the foot-balls of\r\nshrewd manipulators. They were bonded before they were constructed, and\r\noften for more than the value of the completed road. Stocks at the best\r\nonly represented nominal values and were given as premiums to the\r\nbondholders or promoters of the road.\r\n\r\nBut the science of stock-watering did not reach its fullest development\r\nuntil during the period of railroad consolidation. Fictitious values\r\nwere now created as often as a new consolidation took place. Watered\r\nstocks and bonds were watered again and again, until they represented\r\nlittle more than a purely imaginary capital upon the basis of which\r\ndividends might be declared. Take the case of the New York Central and\r\nHudson River Railroad companies, which consolidated in 1869 with a\r\ncapital of $103,110,137.31. The former of these roads was organized in\r\n1853 by the consolidation of ten smaller roads connecting the cities of\r\nAlbany and Buffalo. The capital stock of these companies amounted to\r\n$20,799,800, of which $16,852,870 was claimed to have been paid in.\r\nTheir funded debt was $2,497,526. It is impossible at this day to\r\nascertain the original cost of all these roads, but it is certain that\r\nthe above sums represent about three times the amount actually expended\r\nfor their construction.\r\n\r\nOne of the roads entering into the consolidation was the Utica and\r\nSchenectady. It was 78 miles long and formed about one-fourth of the\r\nconsolidated line. It had the heaviest grading and rock-cutting, was the\r\nbest-equipped and undoubtedly the most expensive, in proportion to its\r\nextent, of the ten roads out of which the New York Central was created.\r\nThe original cost of this line was $2,000,000. Bonds were never issued\r\nby the company. The line was profitable from the very beginning, paid\r\nregularly ten per cent. dividends,--the limit to which railroad\r\ncompanies were then restricted,--and had a large surplus, which it\r\nexpended mainly for improvements. No assessment was ever made on the\r\nstock beyond the $1,500,000 which was originally paid in by the\r\nshareholders and upon which they had drawn regular and liberal\r\ndividends. Taking the original cost of this line as a basis, it is but\r\nfair to presume that the entire line from Albany to Buffalo, covering a\r\ndistance of 297 miles, did not cost to exceed $6,000,000. These roads,\r\nhowever, entered into the consolidation with a capital stock of\r\n$15,274,800 and a bonded indebtedness of $1,696,326.\r\n\r\nEstimating the cost of the branches upon the same basis upon which we\r\nhave estimated that of the main line, we shall find that the total\r\noriginal cost of the consolidated lines cannot have exceeded $8,000,000.\r\nThe Mohawk Valley road was put in at $2,000,000 and the Syracuse and\r\nUtica direct at $600,000, though the roads only existed on paper and did\r\nnot represent any value whatever. The Schenectady and Troy road, which\r\nwent into the consolidation with $650,000 stock and $90,000 bonds, had\r\nbeen bought for less than $100,000 two months previous to the\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that already nearly one-third of the stocks and\r\nbonds of the consolidated companies was water. The consolidation\r\nagreement fixed the capital stock of the New York Central at $23,085,600\r\nand its funded debt at $11,564,033.62, increasing the stock over\r\n$2,000,000, and the bonded debt over $9,000,000. The latter was more\r\nthan quadrupled, and $8,000,000 worth of bonds were, under the name of\r\nconsolidation certificates, given as a present to the stockholders of\r\nthe new road. The capital stock of the New York Central grew steadily up\r\nto the time of its consolidation with the Hudson River road, when it was\r\n$28,795,000. All improvements made during this time were paid for out of\r\nits surplus earnings, with the single exception of the Athens branch,\r\nfor which the company issued $2,000,000 of its stock.\r\n\r\nThe gross earnings of the New York Central in 1854 were $5,000,000, and\r\nits net earnings $2,830,000. In 1863 its gross earnings were in round\r\nnumbers $10,000,000, and in 1869 they reached $15,000,000. The dividends\r\npaid during that year amounted to $4,300,000, and the interest to\r\n$894,000. In view of the fact that the bonded indebtedness of the road\r\nwas from two to three million dollars more than the original cost, this\r\ndividend of 15 per cent. upon a wholly fictitious capital must be\r\nregarded as an unwarranted tribute levied upon the commerce of the\r\ncountry. But we shall soon see that in railroad hydraulics, as well as\r\nin other branches of human industry, success stimulates to still greater\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson River Railroad Company was organized in 1847. It extended\r\nfrom New York City to East Albany and was 144 miles long. There are no\r\ndata extant upon which could be based a reliable estimate of its\r\noriginal cost. Estimating it upon the basis of that of the Utica and\r\nSchenectady, we should have to place it somewhat below $3,000,000. While\r\nsuch an estimate may be too low, the amount of its funded indebtedness\r\nin 1851, which was $5,640,000, probably more than covers the amount\r\nactually expended in the construction of the road. In 1851 the capital\r\nstock of the Hudson River road was $4,000,000. In 1853 the funded debt\r\nhad increased to $7,000,000, and in 1862 to $9,000,000. In 1869 the\r\nbonded indebtedness had decreased to $4,309,000, but the capital stock\r\nhad grown to over $16,000,000. Between 1853 and 1869 the company\r\nincreased its stock and bonded indebtedness nearly $11,000,000, while\r\nthe assessments paid by its stock and bondholders during this time did\r\nnot exceed $1,000,000. Improvements were made, but these were chiefly\r\npaid for out of the surplus earnings of the road. It has been shown by\r\nexperts that $6,640,000 is a high estimate of the actual original cost\r\nof the Hudson River road to its stock-and bondholders, and that\r\nsecurities to the amount of more than $13,000,000 represented surplus\r\nearnings and water. At the time of the consolidation of the Hudson River\r\nand New York Central railroads the capital stock of the two roads had\r\ngrown to $44,800,000. Under the consolidation agreement the stock was\r\nfixed at $45,000,000. The new company also assumed all the bonded and\r\nother indebtedness of both roads. If the consolidation manipulators had\r\npaused here, the capital of the new company would have been somewhat\r\nless than $60,000,000, or more than three times the cost of the\r\nproperty. But the road was, under existing rates, capable of earning\r\ndividends on a much larger capital, and this emergency was met by the\r\nissuance of consolidation certificates to the amount of $45,000,000. The\r\ntotal capital of the road was thus increased to and made to pay\r\ndividends on over $103,000,000, while the total cost of the road and its\r\nequipment, as claimed by the company in 1870, was less than $60,000,000,\r\ntheir estimate being based upon assumed consolidation values and the\r\nexpenditures made from surplus earnings. During the same year the gross\r\nearnings of the company were $22,363,320, and their net earnings\r\n$8,295,240. In 1880 the gross earnings had increased to $33,175,913,\r\nand the net earnings to $15,326,019. The company was able to declare in\r\nthat year 11.82 per cent. dividend on its $89,500,000 of fictitious\r\nstock. In 1890 its gross earnings were $37,008,403, or $26,050 per mile,\r\nwhile its total net earnings were $12,516,273. The gross earnings have\r\nlargely increased during the years 1891 and 1892. It is safe to say that\r\n$2,000,000 per annum would pay very liberal interest and dividends on\r\nthe amount of money expended upon the construction of the New York\r\nCentral and Hudson River Railroad from the proceeds of its bonds and\r\nstocks. By the creation of fictitious values the managers of the company\r\nhave attempted to impose an exorbitant tax upon the commerce and travel\r\nof the country for all time to come. The Government guarantees an\r\ninventor a monopoly only for a limited space of time, upon the\r\nexpiration of which his invention becomes the common property of the\r\npeople; but railroad managers endeavor to collect, under the protection\r\nof our laws, an exorbitant royalty from our people forever.\r\n\r\nThe case of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company is\r\nonly one of the innumerable instances of stock watering in the history\r\nof American railroads. Indeed, it can be shown that stock-watering\r\nreached a still higher degree of development in the case of the Erie\r\nroad. It has been demonstrated that the actual original cost to the\r\nstock-and bondholders of the New York Central Railroad Company, which\r\nwas, with its branch lines, 593 miles long, did not, including the\r\nAthens branch, exceed $10,000,000. Its cost to its owners, in 1869,\r\nincluding the bonuses, premiums, commissions and fictitious equalization\r\nvalues of several transfers, was reported by them to be only\r\n$37,600,000, or about $63,400 per mile. At about the same time the main\r\nstem of the Erie Railway, extending from New York to Dunkirk, a distance\r\nof 459 miles, was represented by a capital of $108,807,687, or $237,000\r\nper mile. Considering the inferiority of this road to the New York\r\nCentral, we are forced to the conclusion that nearly 85 per cent. of the\r\ncapital of the road represented water, or, in other words, that the\r\ncommerce of the United States was taxed to pay dividends on about\r\n$90,000,000 of watered securities. In 1863 the Erie Railroad had\r\noutstanding $11,437,500 of common stock. In 1864 this had been increased\r\nto $15,693,000, in 1868 to $37,765,000, and in 1869 to $70,000,000. Not\r\none-tenth of this enormous increase of capital was ever expended on the\r\nproperty of the road. The stock was sold at from 20 to 40 cents on the\r\ndollar, and the proceeds disappeared in the hands of its managers. To\r\nwhat extent this freebootery was carried will probably never be known.\r\nAn idea of the rottenness of the Erie management may be had from the\r\nfact that the courts at one time ordered its president to restore to the\r\ncompany $9,000,000 of diverted securities, which order was complied\r\nwith. Vast private fortunes were amassed by nearly all the men who\r\ndirected the affairs of the road, and the mismanagement became in time\r\nso notorious that the legislature of the State of New York was appealed\r\nto, to remove the directors of the road for the protection of its\r\nstockholders, and to reduce the capital stock of the company to the\r\namount actually paid for it. This movement failed, however, because it\r\nwas opposed by the very stockholders whose interests were supposed to\r\nhave suffered by directorial mismanagement. They preferred to continue\r\nto draw dividends on the face value of stocks which they had purchased\r\nat 20 cents on the dollar. The capitalization of the company has since\r\nbeen increased to $163,679,825, and it is by no means a secret among\r\nthose familiar with railroad values that the bonded indebtedness of the\r\nErie road represents alone many millions more than the total amount that\r\nwas ever invested in the property.\r\n\r\nThe principal competitor for through traffic of the two companies whose\r\nfinancial operations we have just reviewed is the Pennsylvania Central\r\nCompany. It has often been asserted by the managers and friends of this\r\ncompany that its capital is free from water; but this is not true. In\r\n1864 a dividend of $4,130,760 was made out of the surplus earnings of\r\nthe road. This dividend was payable in capital stock and was equal to 30\r\nper cent. of the then outstanding capital. Similar surplus dividends,\r\neach equal to 5 per cent. of the company's outstanding stock, were\r\ndeclared in 1867 and 1868. The people were thus taxed to pay dividends\r\non a capitalized surplus which had been derived from excessive charges\r\npreviously imposed on them. I shall not attempt here to determine\r\nwhether the capital represented by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company has\r\nbeen honestly invested. A committee of Congress has expressed the\r\nopinion that the capitalization of its main line exceeds the amount of\r\nthe actual cost of the property by more than eleven million dollars.\r\nThere is, however, a system of inflation practiced by the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company which is simply a new form of bond and stock watering.\r\nMore than one-half of the capital of this company has been invested in\r\nthe stocks and bonds of other corporations. In 1891 the amount so\r\ninvested was $154,319,240, and the income derived from it $4,852,181.\r\nThis does not only cause the stocks and bonds of certain companies to be\r\ncounted twice, but exacts a double tax from the commerce of the\r\ncountry, interests and dividends upon the same capital being paid both\r\nto the bond- and stockholders of the Pennsylvania Central and to the\r\nbond-and stockholders of the roads in whose securities it has made\r\ninvestments. The income of the company is thus swelled far beyond the\r\namount which the traffic reports indicate. It will be seen that, to\r\nperpetuate extortionate rates, this process of manifolding securities\r\nmight be continued indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe cost to its stock-and bondholders of the Baltimore and Chicago line\r\nof the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which has a length of 795 miles, was\r\nestimated by the company's officers at about $57,000,000. The actual\r\ncost of this road, owing to its expensive mountain grades, was probably\r\ngreater than that of any of the other through lines between the\r\nsea-coast and Chicago, but there can be no doubt that the capitalization\r\nof this road represents from one-half to one-third pure water. At the\r\ntime of the completion of this road to Chicago the surplus earnings of\r\nthe company, after the payment of interest and dividends, amounted to\r\nover $29,000,000. This had been charged to \"profit and loss\" and used in\r\nthe construction of branch lines. Thus an amount equal to more than half\r\nof the reported cost of this line had at the time of its completion been\r\nreturned to its owners in other railroad values.\r\n\r\nThe Select Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard in\r\n1874 estimated the excess of the capital over actual cost of the Erie\r\nroad, from New York to Dunkirk, at $68,807,000; that of the New York,\r\nLake Shore and Michigan Southern line to Chicago at $115,188,137, and\r\nthat of the Pennsylvania and Fort Wayne line to Chicago at $11,290,374.\r\nIf this estimate was correct the entire over-capitalization of these\r\nlines, on which the commerce between the West and the East was forced to\r\npay a dividend of 8 and 10 per cent. per annum, was no less than\r\n$195,000,000. The committee assumed the actual cost of these roads to be\r\n$182,000,000, or about $78,000 per mile. They based their estimate upon\r\nthe cost of the main branch of the Baltimore and Ohio, as reported by\r\ntheir officers, supposing it to represent the actual outlay made by its\r\nstock-and bondholders. Various revelations which have since been made to\r\nthe public, as to the real cost of railway construction, justify the\r\nbelief that the estimated cost of $78,000 per mile for those roads is\r\nfar too high. Mr. Henry Poor, several years ago, estimated the average\r\ncost of the roads of the United States at $30,000 a mile. Making\r\nallowance on one hand for Mr. Poor's tendency to favor the railroad side\r\nof the question, and on the other hand for the more expensive grades,\r\ndouble tracks and better terminal facilities of these trunk lines,\r\n$50,000 per mile may be considered a fair estimate of their average\r\ncost. Upon this basis the total cost of the three lines in question\r\nwould amount to $116,450,000, and the excess of their capital over\r\nactual cost would be the enormous sum of $261,000,000, or 325 per cent.\r\nof their actual cost, and probably not less than 400 per cent. of the\r\noriginal cost to their stock-and bondholders. The capital of these\r\ncompanies has since been considerably increased, to enable their\r\nmanagers to increase their dividends, and with it the tax levied upon\r\nthe commerce of the country.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the many instances of stock watering that might\r\nbe mentioned. In fact, there are to-day very few railroads in the United\r\nStates that are entirely free from it. It is a notorious fact that the\r\nstock of a large number of railroad companies represents little or no\r\nvalue, having either been sold at a mere nominal price or been donated\r\nas a premium or bonus to those who purchased a large amount of the\r\ncompany's bonds. In recommending, in his December, 1891, annual message,\r\nGovernment aid for the Nicaragua Canal, President Harrison said: \"But if\r\nits bonds are to be marketed at heavy discounts and every bond sold is\r\nto be accompanied by a gift of stock, as has come to be expected by\r\ninvestors in such enterprises, the traffic will be seriously burdened to\r\npay interest and dividends.\" It is not difficult to surmise to what\r\nenterprises the President referred. It has for many years been a\r\nwell-settled principle among railroad incorporators that no larger\r\nassessments should be made upon the stockholders than is necessary to\r\nfloat the company's bonds. A company, for instance, is organized with a\r\ncapital stock of, say, $1,000,000. Five per cent. of this sum, or\r\n$50,000, is paid into defray preliminary expenses. The road is then\r\nbonded for perhaps $2,000,000, but as the bonds are sold for only 80 per\r\ncent. of their face value and as the incorporators allow themselves 5\r\nper cent. for the negotiation of the bonds, only $1,500,000 is realized\r\nfor the construction of the road. The incorporators now vote to\r\nthemselves a contract to construct the road for $1,500,000 and at once\r\nsublet it to a contractor who is ready and anxious to build the road for\r\n$1,200,000. The incorporators thus realize $1,000,000 worth of stock, a\r\nportion of which is unloaded upon unsophisticated investors, and\r\n$300,000 in cash, at an outlay of $50,000; and the road, which cost\r\n$1,200,000, is made to pay interest and dividends on a total capital of\r\n$3,000,000, and this is subsequently watered indefinitely if the road\r\nproves profitable or a consolidation with some other road justifies the\r\nbelief that its earning capacity might be increased. Nor is this an\r\noverdrawn picture. On the contrary, instances might be cited where only\r\none-half of one per cent. of the company's stock was paid in by the\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\nIn the days of inflation such transactions did not seem to seriously\r\naffect railroad securities. Even when they were no longer a secret to\r\nthe public, stocks and bonds sold readily, because, owing to the large\r\nearnings of the roads, this class of investments was unusually\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the earnings of the railroads of Massachusetts averaged $15,400\r\na mile, and were equal to 38 per cent. of the total reported cost of all\r\nthe lines of the State. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy earned\r\n$15,386 per mile in 1867, and paid a 15 per cent. dividend. Its stocks\r\nwere quoted 100 per cent. above par. In 1867 the Lake Shore Railroad\r\nearned more than 50 per cent., and the Terre Haute and Indianapolis even\r\nas much as 57.2 per cent. of the amount of its cost. Previous to the war\r\nthe inflation of railroad securities was, as a rule, confined to the\r\nstock. Where roads were bonded for more than the cost of construction it\r\nwas, with but very few exceptions, done to make their capital to\r\ncorrespond with their earning capacity, or rather to divert public\r\nattention from the fact that the rates in force had outlived their\r\nreasonableness. It was reserved to the Union Pacific and the Central\r\nPacific companies to bond their roads from the beginning to an amount\r\nequal to twice their actual cost, or, in other words, to virtually\r\nreceive them as a present from the Federal Government, bond them for all\r\nthey were worth, and, in addition, issue stock to an amount largely in\r\nexcess of the cost of construction, and then try to earn interest and\r\ndividends on the whole amount of securities issued. The history of\r\nthese companies forms so interesting and instructive a chapter in the\r\nrailroad annals of America that a short synopsis of it may not seem out\r\nof place here.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Union Pacific Railroad Company was granted by\r\nCongress on the first day of July, 1862. Shortly after the beginning of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion it was made to appear to the country that a\r\ntranscontinental road was a national necessity; that without it we could\r\nnot hope to retain long the Pacific Coast. It was also very plausibly\r\nargued that the political benefits to be derived by the country from the\r\nconstruction of such a road, as well as its great length and\r\nextraordinary cost, made it the duty of the nation to aid liberally its\r\nenterprising and patriotic promoters in the prosecution of their\r\ngigantic task. In those stirring times few people were inclined to\r\nquestion the motives of those who advocated what appeared to be\r\npatriotic measures, or to be penurious in the expenditure of public\r\nfunds when the public weal seemed to demand such expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific Railroad charter, which in substance was passed by\r\nCongress as it had been drafted by the promoters of the enterprise, gave\r\nto the new company the right of way through the public lands, and\r\nauthorized it to take, from the lands adjacent to the line of its road,\r\nearth, stone, timber and other materials for its construction. It\r\nfurther granted to the company every alternate section of land to the\r\namount of five alternate sections per mile on each side of its line,\r\nexcepting only those lands to which preëmption or homestead claims\r\nattached at the time when the line of the road should be definitely\r\nfixed. In addition to these donations the United States issued to the\r\ncompany subsidy bonds in an amount equal to $16,000 per mile for the\r\ndistance from the Missouri River to the eastern line of the Rocky\r\nMountains, $48,000 per mile for a distance of 150 miles through the\r\nRocky Mountains, and $32,000 per mile from the western base of the Rocky\r\nMountains to the terminus of the road. Similar franchises were at the\r\nsame time given to the Central Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation\r\nwhich had previously been chartered by the State of California. Besides\r\nits grant of right of way, land, timber, etc., this company received\r\nsubsidy bonds at the rate of $16,000 a mile for a distance of 7.18 miles\r\neast of Sacramento, of $48,000 a mile for 150 miles through the Sierra\r\nNevada, and of $32,000 a mile for the distance from the eastern base of\r\nthat mountain range to its junction with the Union Pacific. The charters\r\nof the two companies provided that, to secure the repayment to the\r\nUnited States of the amount of those bonds, they should _ipso facto_\r\nconstitute a first mortgage on the entire lines of the road, together\r\nwith their rolling stock, fixtures and other property. The franchises\r\nand donations thus granted by Congress were most valuable; in fact, the\r\nlatter were alone sufficient to build and equip the roads. In spite,\r\nhowever, of the liberal grants and in spite of the urgent necessity of\r\nthe roads in those years of national trial, both of these enterprises\r\nmade very slow progress. Their promoters were men of small means, and\r\nthe capitalists to whom they appealed for help failed to realize the\r\nvalue of the franchises. No doubt when these men first engaged in their\r\ncause they expected to encounter serious obstacles in Congress,\r\nsupposing that that august body would consider the proposed measure with\r\nmuch deliberation and to act upon it with still more circumspection.\r\nTheir success greatly surprised them. They made the discovery that\r\nmembers of Congress could be imposed upon as easily as private\r\ncitizens, and when they fully realized how readily their demands had\r\nbeen granted, they were greatly provoked at themselves because they had\r\nnot asked for more.\r\n\r\nAccording to a story told by my old friend Mr. J. O. Crosby, an\r\nexperienced member of the brotherhood of tramps late one afternoon\r\nchanced to stroll into the city of Alton. Having no visible means of\r\nsupport, he was picked up by the police and brought before the Mayor to\r\ngive an account of himself and to be dealt with as that dignitary might\r\nsee fit. The tramp, a printer by profession, and by no means a tyro in\r\nmeeting such emergencies, so managed to impress the Mayor with his\r\nsuperior accomplishments that the latter concluded it would be a good\r\ninvestment, both for himself and the city over which he presided, to\r\noffer the genial stranger a contribution to his traveling fund, upon the\r\ncondition that he would no longer than absolutely necessary molest the\r\ncity with his presence. He accordingly told the intercepted tourist that\r\nwhile it had been for years the policy of the city and its officials to\r\nentertain all tramps found within the limits of Alton for thirty days at\r\nthe city jail in exchange for a fair amount of labor, he would, in\r\nconsideration of the apparent fact that he was of better metal than the\r\naverage tramp, make an exception in his case, and would, even at the\r\nrisk of being censured for it by his constituents, hand over to him five\r\ndollars from the municipal funds if he would agree to leave the city\r\nearly next morning. The tramp gladly accepted the proposition,\r\nreplenished his empty purse with the proffered bounty and withdrew from\r\nthe City Hall, to take a stroll through Main Street. The city seemed to\r\nhim as prosperous as the Mayor had shown himself liberal. It occurred to\r\nthe itinerant typographer that its treasury would not have been the\r\nworse off for a ten-dollar levy, and he hastily returned to the Mayor's\r\noffice to plead for a larger donation. The Mayor, not disposed to argue\r\nthe question, handed him another five-dollar bill and improved the\r\nopportunity to remind him of his previous promise and to give expression\r\nto the hope that as a gentleman of honor he would now discharge his\r\nobligation. The tramp fairly overwhelmed His Honor with assurances of\r\ngood faith and bade him an affectionate good-by. The next rising sun\r\nfound him on his onward journey. His route led through Alton on the\r\nHill, a portion of the city which he had not seen before. He viewed with\r\nsurprise the many fine residences and other evidences of opulence which\r\nthis part of the city contained. He passed on in a pensive mood until he\r\nreached the summit of the hill, which commanded a fine view of the\r\nentire city. Here he turned to cast a farewell glance over the town\r\nruled over by the most generous mayor that it had ever been his\r\nprivilege to meet. As he beheld before him the fine homes and beautiful\r\nyards, and below in the valley the lofty church-steeples, the many\r\nschool-houses, the massive business blocks, the long and well-paved\r\nstreets and the spacious and shady parks, an expression of mingled\r\nsurprise and disappointment stole over his face. He thrice slapped his\r\nwrinkled brow and then hurriedly retraced his steps down the hill. When\r\nthe chief magistrate of Alton came to his office that morning, he met\r\nthe irrepressible tramp anxiously waiting for him at the door. \"Mr.\r\nMayor,\" said the wily extortioner, \"I acted very hastily yesterday when\r\nI accepted your second proposition. You have here a much larger town\r\nthan I ever supposed. I have been constrained to take our last agreement\r\ninto reconsideration, and I shall not leave this point until you add\r\nanother five dollars to your consideration. You can certainly better\r\nafford to do that than to throw away thirty days' board and the ten\r\ndollars which you have already paid me besides.\"\r\n\r\nThe diplomacy of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railway companies\r\nwas the same as that of the Alton tramp. They had found Congress as\r\ngenerous as the tramp had found the Mayor of Alton, and now reproached\r\nthemselves for their modesty and resolved to bring the pliability of\r\nCongress to a severer test. They again appeared before that body in 1864\r\nand asked that their charter be so amended as to grant to them ten\r\nalternate sections instead of five on each side of the road, and also\r\nall the iron and coal found within ten miles of their track, which had\r\npreviously been reserved by Congress. And in addition to this they asked\r\nthat they be authorized to issue their own mortgage bonds on their\r\nrespective roads to an amount equal to the bonds of the United States,\r\nand that the lien of the United States bonds be made subordinate to the\r\nlien created by the companies' bonds. By the act of Congress, July 2,\r\n1864, all these demands were granted, and the two companies were thus\r\nvirtually presented with their roads and were at the same time given\r\npermission to mortgage this gift of the people and divide the proceeds\r\namong their shareholders, many of whom had received their stock chiefly\r\nin consideration of their influence in and out of Congress. The\r\ncontribution of the United States to these companies on account of their\r\nmain lines has not been far from $80,000,000, of which over $52,000,000\r\nwas paid in bonds, and the remainder in lands, which aggregated about\r\n23,000,000 acres. The whole line from Council Bluffs to Sacramento is\r\n1,780 miles long. It will thus be seen that the national contribution\r\nwas about $45,000 per mile, besides the right of way and all timber,\r\niron and coal found within ten miles of the road. There is no doubt that\r\nthis contribution was equal to, if it did not exceed, the actual cost of\r\nthe road. There has been an erroneous impression abroad which has\r\nlikened the Pacific road to those wonderful and very expensive lines\r\nwhich cross the Andes and the Alps. Those who have not crossed the\r\ncontinent can hardly believe that the construction of this line was\r\nneither more difficult nor more expensive than that of any of the\r\nnumerous railroads crossing the mountain ranges of the East, but such is\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nStarting from Omaha, the Union Pacific follows for nearly 500 miles, or\r\nalmost half of its entire length, the valley of the Platte River. A\r\nbetter route for a railroad cannot be found upon the western continent.\r\nThere are between Omaha and Cheyenne but three bridges worthy of the\r\nname. The Platte Valley is almost straight, rising toward the west at a\r\nnearly uniform rate of about 10 feet to the mile. Grading was\r\npractically unnecessary, and the work of construction consisted of\r\nlittle more than the laying of the ties and track. From the base of the\r\nmountains at Cheyenne to their summit is a distance of about thirty-two\r\nmiles, the difference in altitude between the two points being less than\r\n2,200 feet. The average grade is therefore about 68 feet to the mile,\r\nand nowhere are the grades heavier than 80 feet to the mile. There are\r\nheavier grades than these in the prairie State of Iowa, and the mountain\r\ngrades of a number of Eastern roads exceed those of the Union Pacific by\r\nfrom 30 to 40 feet to the mile. The rise is, if not uniform, at least\r\ngradual, and the construction of even this portion of the road required,\r\ntherefore, neither great engineering skill nor any unusual expenditure\r\nof money. The road now crosses a plateau which extends almost to the\r\nterminus of the Union Pacific at Ogden, and a very large portion of this\r\nis as favorable for a roadbed as the average railroad territory of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe route of the Central Pacific presented to the engineer no great\r\nobstacles between Ogden and the State line of California, the only\r\nelevation of any note to be surmounted being the Humboldt Mountains in\r\nNevada. Their highest point, Humboldt Wells, is 221 miles west of Ogden,\r\nand has an elevation of 5,650 feet above the level of the sea, while\r\nthat of Ogden is 4,320 feet. Upon an average the grades of this portion\r\nof the road do not differ from those found in the Mississippi Valley.\r\nThe portion of the Central Pacific Railroad which traverses the Sierra\r\nNevada is the most expensive of the whole line, but the cost of\r\nconstruction did not, even on this division, exceed the amount\r\ncontributed for it by the Federal Government; for the statement is made\r\nupon good authority that a few of the leading promoters of the road\r\nbuilt the first western section of twenty miles with their own capital,\r\nof less than $200,000, and a loan from the city of Sacramento and Placer\r\nCounty, amounting to $550,000, and then drew $848,000 Government\r\nsubsidy, or more than enough to build the second section and draw\r\nanother installment of the subsidy; and that they repeated the operation\r\nuntil the whole line was completed. These men were in such haste to\r\nrealize the profits which their undertaking promised them that they did\r\nnot even take sufficient time to make a proper survey of their line. Had\r\nthey done so, a great saving, both in the construction and in the\r\nsubsequent operation of the road, might have been effected. It is now\r\nwell known that a route could have been found through the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains, not far distant from the route chosen, which would have saved\r\n800 feet in elevation and at least 25 per cent. in the expense of\r\ngrading.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly safe to say that if less than forty thousand dollars a\r\nmile was sufficient to construct the road through the Sierra Nevadas the\r\nFederal contribution of $50,000,000 for the entire line, from Omaha to\r\nSan Francisco, left, after the completion, a respectable surplus, either\r\nto the companies or those of their members who had the construction\r\ncontract, and that the $75,000,000 of capital stock and the $55,000,000\r\nof first mortgage bonds which the two companies issued were a gigantic\r\ndividend to the stockholders, for which, practically, no consideration\r\nwas given.\r\n\r\nThe companies might well have been satisfied with the Government's\r\ngenerosity, but their success in imposing upon Congress stimulated their\r\ngreed. The act of 1864 provided that the charge for Government\r\ntransportation over these roads should be applied to the liquidation of\r\nits bonds, and that after the completion of the lines five per cent. of\r\ntheir net earnings should likewise be so applied. When the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, under the law, refused to pay them the amount earned by\r\nGovernment transportation, and in addition to this demanded the five per\r\ncent. of their net earnings in liquidation of their debt, the companies\r\napplied to Congress to again amend their charters so as to relieve them\r\nfor the time being from any direct payment of either principal or\r\ninterest of the Government bonds, and to make it the duty of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to pay to the companies in money one-half of\r\nthe compensation allowed to them by law for services performed for the\r\nGovernment. And again Congress responded to their demands, granting\r\nthem, by a rider to the army appropriation bill, passed March 3, 1871,\r\nall the relief asked for. Owing to the policy of the managers of the\r\nPacific line to pay as little of the interest on the Government subsidy\r\ndebt as is absolutely necessary to prevent foreclosure proceedings, the\r\nunpaid interest has accumulated until it now almost equals the amount of\r\nthe original indebtedness. The last report of the Commissioner of\r\nRailroads shows that the total indebtedness, principal and interest, to\r\nthe United States of the Pacific railroad companies, was $114,490,000 on\r\nJuly 1, 1892. The Commissioner seems to be of the opinion that the Union\r\nPacific Company will not be able to pay the subsidy bonds at maturity,\r\nand he urges that some step be taken in the matter by Congress, whether\r\nit be to extend the loan, which will mature within the next six years,\r\nor to sell the road. The managers of the Pacific roads and their friends\r\nask an extension of the Government subsidy bonds for fifty years, and a\r\nreduction of interest from 6 to 2 per cent. If Congress continues to be\r\nservile to these interests, the Pacific railroad lobby will secure just\r\nsuch legislation as they demand.\r\n\r\nAt the time the Pacific roads were built the people of the United States\r\nhad no adequate knowledge of the topography of the Territories, and the\r\npromoters of the road for a while found it a difficult task to convince\r\ncapitalists that the investment would be a safe one. That they knew the\r\nvalue of the projected road was shown by the contest between the Central\r\nPacific and the Union Pacific for mileage. For a distance of over 200\r\nmiles the two companies graded roads side by side in contest for the\r\nGovernment subsidy.\r\n\r\nThe promoters were even disappointed in the cost of the roads, as Mr.\r\nSidney Dillon states in an article published in the August number of\r\n_Scribner's Magazine_, 1892, in which he says:\r\n\r\n      \"At the end of 1867 the road was completed to the top of the\r\n      mountains and nearly half way to Salt Lake City. The cost of\r\n      building over the mountains was so much less than we had\r\n      expected that the construction company found itself with a\r\n      surplus from the proceeds of the subsidy bonds. This was\r\n      imprudently distributed in dividends.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States Government could parallel to-day the line of either\r\nroad for less than the amount of its first mortgage bonds, and its\r\nsubsidy bonds are therefore nearly worthless.\r\n\r\nMr. Clews, in his \"Twenty-Eight Years in Wall Street,\" says:\r\n\r\n      \"After the Thurman bill had been sustained by the Supreme\r\n      Court Mr. Gould had a plan to build a road from Omaha to\r\n      Ogden, just outside the right of way of the Union Pacific,\r\n      and give that road back to the Government. It would give\r\n      others 'a chance to walk.' The Government tried to squeeze\r\n      more out of the turnip than was in it. For $15,000,000 a\r\n      road could be built where it had cost the Union Pacific\r\n      $75,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that the Pacific roads, even at an extravagant cost,\r\nhave proved a good investment for the country, yet their history\r\nreflects severely on the statesmanship of those members of Congress\r\nwhose duty it was to properly protect the interests of the nation at\r\nthat time. They were unequal to their task.\r\n\r\nThe Great Northern Railway Company has just completed its road to the\r\nPacific Coast. Its line is very direct, and it has unusually light\r\ncurvature and low grades, which will enable it to be operated more\r\ncheaply than any Pacific line yet constructed. Much of its route is\r\nthrough a rich and productive country, insuring to it a heavy local\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics concerning it are given in the _Railway Age_:\r\n\r\n  Total mileage, December 18, 1890          2,850\r\n  Average bonded debt per mile            $18,636 75\r\n  Average stock per mile                    7,015 67\r\n  Total                                    25,652 42\r\n  Interest charges per mile                 1,005 76\r\n  Dividend charges per mile                   420 94\r\n\r\nA comparison of these figures with those corresponding of other\r\ntranscontinental lines is instructive, and is commended to Congressmen\r\nwho have to deal with the Union Pacific and Central Pacific questions.\r\n\r\nStock and bond inflation, it may confidently be asserted, has created\r\nfrom five to six thousand millions of dollars of fictitious railroad\r\ncapital. In 1890 the average liabilities of the railroads in the United\r\nStates, including the capital stock and the funded and unfunded debt,\r\nwere $63,600 per mile. According to Mr. Poor's estimate of the average\r\ncost of American railroads per mile, more than 50 per cent. of this vast\r\nsum is pure water. But, as has been stated before, Mr. Poor is partial\r\nto the railroad interest, and his estimate of $30,000 a mile is too high\r\nfor the time at which it was made. Furthermore, railroad building has\r\nsince then been materially cheapened. Tens of thousands of miles of road\r\nhave been built in recent years that did not cost to exceed $10,000 a\r\nmile. Very recently the Union Pacific Railroad Company proved, before\r\nthe Board of Equalization at Salt Lake City, by the testimony of\r\nengineers, that the average cost per mile of the Utah Central line was\r\nonly $7,298.20, itemized as follows:\r\n\r\n  Engineering                         $  300 00\r\n  Grading 5-ft. fill, 18,480 yds.      2,310 00\r\n  Ties, 2,640, at 30 cts.                792 00\r\n  Rails, 82 tons                       1,845 00\r\n  Splices                                 12 00\r\n  Bolts                                   24 00\r\n  Spikes                                 142 20\r\n  Track-laying                           600 00\r\n  Bridges                                200 00\r\n  Station-building                       100 00\r\n  Fences                                 150 00\r\n  Right of way                           720 00\r\n                                      ---------\r\n                                      $7,298 20\r\n\r\nIn a recent article Mr. C. Wood Davis states that \"many auxiliary lines\r\nhave been built at costs ranging from $8,000 to $15,000 per mile, and\r\ncapitalized at two, three, four, and even five times their cost, as in\r\nthe case of the 107 miles of the Kansas Midland, costing, including a\r\nsmall equipment, but $10,200 per mile, of which 30 per cent. was\r\nfurnished by the municipalities along its line. Yet, with construction\r\nprofits and other devices, this road shows a capitalization of $53,000\r\nper mile.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that \"the Missouri Pacific line from Eldora to McPherson, Kansas, a\r\ncomparatively expensive prairie road, being located across the line of\r\ndrainage, cost much less than $10,000 per mile, as have thousands of\r\nmiles of other prairie roads.\"\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that $25,000 is a liberal estimate of the average cost\r\nper mile of American roads to the stock-and bondholders, and that their\r\ncapitalization represents $38,000 of water per mile. The total net\r\nearnings of the railroads of the country were $341,666,639 in 1890, and\r\n$356,227,883 in 1891, upon an actual investment of only about\r\n$4,250,000,000. This is a return of about 8-1/2 per cent. and shows the\r\nforce of Mr. Poor's statement that, if the water were squeezed out of\r\nrailroad securities, no better-paying investment could be found in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe often see references to the fact that no dividends are paid upon a\r\nlarge portion of railroad stocks, but there is no reason why dividends\r\nshould be paid upon many of them, as they represent no capital whatever\r\nthat has gone into the road. It is probable that not to exceed ten cents\r\non the dollar upon an average was originally paid for these stocks, and\r\nthe $80,000,000 distributed annually as dividends upon them does not\r\nvary much from fifteen to twenty-five per cent. upon the amount actually\r\ninvested in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCOMBINATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the favorite argument of railroad men, and the writer must confess\r\nthat he himself formerly believed, that if all legal restraints were\r\nremoved from railroad business, the laws of trade would regulate it more\r\nsuccessfully and more satisfactorily, both to the railroad companies and\r\ntheir patrons, than the wisest statutes could ever regulate it. To give\r\nforce to their argument, they cite the old Democratic maxim that that\r\nState is governed best which is ruled the least. They also assert that\r\nit is the province of the State to guarantee to each of its citizens\r\nindustrial freedom; to permit him to transact any legitimate business\r\naccording to his best judgment; to buy and to sell where and at what\r\nprice he pleases; in short, to earn without restriction the reward of\r\nhis intelligence and his industry. They further contend that under a\r\nfree government the law of supply and demand should be allowed free\r\nsway, and that he who buys or sells transportation should not be\r\nhampered in his transactions any more than the grocer and his customer.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this is that, while the grocer is a natural person, the\r\nrailroad company is an artificial person, and that, while the business\r\nof the former is purely private, that of the latter is quasi-public. The\r\ngrocer must rely solely upon his personal rights and private resources,\r\nbut the railroad company accepts from the State the franchises which\r\nenable it to do business. And yet, if the public had any assurance that\r\nthe laws of trade would regulate both kinds of business alike, it is\r\nnot likely that the State would distinguish between the two. They claim\r\nthat their business is like other private business, and therefore they\r\nshould be let alone; that competition can be relied upon to correct\r\nabuses; and where competition does actually exist they forget, and then\r\nclaim that their business is not like other private business, and they\r\nshould be allowed to make pools and combinations, because in their\r\nbusiness competition is ruinous. Experience has certainly demonstrated\r\nthat competition is only possible where combination is impossible. Where\r\nthe same commodity is supplied by a large number of individuals, there\r\nis but little danger for the public from those who supply it, for an\r\nagreement among many cannot easily be effected; and even if an\r\nunderstanding could be reached, it would not long be satisfactory to all\r\nparties. Disagreements would arise which would end in the dissolution of\r\nthe combination. Where, however, the number of competitors is small,\r\nagreements can be easily effected and successfully maintained.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether there is at present any interest in the\r\ncommercial world which has a greater tendency to monopoly and\r\ncombination than the railroad interest. There are in the United States\r\nsome 40,000 railroad stations. Not more than 4,000 of these are\r\njunctions of two or more roads. At 90 per cent. of these stations\r\nshippers are therefore confined to one line of railroad, and are, in\r\nabsence of State regulation, compelled to pay for transportation\r\nwhatever price the companies may be disposed to charge, subject only to\r\nsuch restrictions as the proximity of competing points may impose. If\r\ncompetition obtained at all points where two or more roads meet, many\r\nrailroad companies could not afford to charge excessive rates at\r\nnon-competitive points along their lines of road, for such a policy\r\nwould slowly but surely drive a large volume of their legitimate\r\nbusiness to rival roads, to whose interest it would be to encourage by\r\nevery means in their power such diversion of traffic. Railroads early\r\nrecognized this fact and took steps to enable each line to control its\r\nlocal business. The first combinations among railroad companies to\r\ncontrol prices at competitive points were rather crude; in fact, much\r\ncruder than the first Granger legislation. They were simple agreements\r\namong the various roads touching a common point to maintain certain\r\nfixed rates. But while each road was anxious to have the rates agreed\r\nupon maintained by all of its rivals, it cared but little about\r\nmaintaining its own good faith, and it improved every opportunity to get\r\nbusiness at reduced rates so long as it could reasonably hope to escape\r\ndetection. As soon as any of the competing roads, through the\r\nfalling-off of its business, became convinced that it was the victim of\r\noverreaching rivals, it retaliated by offering still lower rates to\r\nclose-tongued shippers. This tricky rivalry would be continued until the\r\nanimosity engendered by it would lead to an open rupture, and what\r\nrailroad men are pleased to term a rate war would follow. As the\r\nschedule rates had before been unreasonably high, so they became now\r\nunreasonably low. Hostilities would be continued until all belligerents\r\nbecame exhausted and manifested a disposition to negotiate a treaty of\r\npeace. The former high rates would then be restored; the compact was\r\ncarried out for a short time, to be again violated and finally annulled.\r\nThese rate agreements were in vogue in New England before the War of the\r\nRebellion and gradually found their way to the Middle States and the\r\nWest. Wherever they were tried they were violated, until even among the\r\nmost unsophisticated of freight agents a rate agreement was looked upon\r\nas a farce.\r\n\r\nThe statement is often made by railroad managers that excesses in\r\nrailroad competition are the result of the peculiar conditions of their\r\nbusiness, which has heavy fixed charges on one hand and a fickle\r\npatronage on the other; that the uncertainty of through business compels\r\nthem to rely upon the local business for such revenue as is necessary to\r\nmeet these fixed charges; and that, inasmuch as their trains _must_ run,\r\nand any through freight hauled by them is so much business taken from\r\nthe enemy, they can better afford to take it at any price than to have\r\none of their competitors take it.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see why this reasoning should not be applied to other\r\nbranches of business; for instance, to milling. The mill-owner, like the\r\nrailroad company, has heavy fixed charges. He has to earn the interest\r\non his capital, he has to keep his mill in repair, he now and then has\r\nto meet the demands of the times and purchase improved appliances, and\r\nhe has to keep a certain number of employes, whether business is brisk\r\nor slack. He might, therefore, if he saw fit to employ the logic of\r\nrailroad managers, earn revenue enough to meet his fixed charges from\r\nthe business which his regular customers give him, and then do any\r\nbusiness coming from beyond this circle at any price rather than\r\nsurrender it to a rival.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be conceded that any enterprise conducted on such\r\nprinciples could, at the best, flourish only temporarily, for it would\r\nsoon encounter difficulties from two sources. Its local customers, thus\r\ndiscriminated against, would withdraw their patronage, while its\r\ncompetitors, finding their territory encroached upon, would, in\r\nself-defense, offer still better terms to the public to regain their\r\nlost customers. Such ruinous competition, if long persisted in, must\r\nnecessarily cripple, if it does not bankrupt, a majority of those who\r\nengage in it. It is fortunately as rare in industrial and commercial\r\ncircles as it is common among public carriers.\r\n\r\nThis difference can easily be accounted for. Where there are a large\r\nnumber of competitors the prices of the commodities supplied by them are\r\nleveled down until they reach a point where they will afford only a\r\nreasonable margin of profit, and beyond which they will cease to be\r\nprofitable, and will therefore cease to be supplied until the\r\nequilibrium is again established. Where, however, the number of\r\ncompetitors is small, the price of the commodities supplied by them\r\nwill, by agreement, for a time at least, be maintained at a point where\r\nit affords considerable more than a reasonable profit. Here the large\r\ngain presents to the various competitors such a temptation to outstrip\r\ntheir rivals and increase their business at the expense of good faith,\r\nthat but few, if any, of them will, in the long run, resist it. The\r\ntendency to underbid rivals will always be strong where profits are\r\nlarge, and it may safely be asserted that efforts to maintain, through\r\ncombinations, excessive rates are the most fruitful source of ruinous\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nIn time railroad managers became convinced that, unless it was possible\r\nto radically reform railroad ethics, rate agreements could never be\r\nrelied upon for the maintenance of excessive rates at competing points.\r\nThe combined roads found it an easy matter to agree upon excessive\r\nrates, but were powerless to enforce them. Experience convinced their\r\nmanagers that to make their tariffs effective it was necessary to\r\ndeprive individual roads of the power or the inducement to cut below the\r\nagreed rates. Their ingenuity in time developed a system which promised\r\nto remove from individual roads every temptation to take business at\r\nless than schedule prices. This device consists in a division of\r\nrailroad business and is commonly called a pool. There are various ways\r\nin which such a division is made. Either the traffic is divided among\r\nthe various companies meeting at a common point, or each road is allowed\r\nto carry all freights that it may receive, and then the earnings of the\r\ndifferent roads are divided, each road being paid the actual cost of\r\nsuch service as it has performed. There is still a third pooling\r\narrangement, consisting in a division of territory, but this has been\r\nfound less satisfactory and is now but rarely resorted to.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the first regular pool organized in the United States\r\nwas the Chicago-Omaha pool, formed in 1870 by the Chicago, Burlington\r\nand Quincy, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, and the Chicago and\r\nNorthwestern railroad companies, then the only three lines connecting\r\nthe cities of Chicago and Omaha. This pool, which was subsequently\r\njoined by other lines, made an equal division of the traffic, and was so\r\nwell organized that it lasted fourteen years \"without a break.\" The\r\nabuses practiced by the companies belonging to this pool were one of the\r\nchief causes of the Granger movement in Iowa. It is indeed doubtful\r\nwhether any other railroad combination ever maintained itself longer or\r\npursued its ends with greater pertinacity than this pool. Another pool\r\nof national notoriety was the Southern Railway and Steamship\r\nAssociation, which was organized, though at first under a different\r\nname, in the State of Georgia, in 1875. It was probably the first money\r\npool formed in the United States. Each member was awarded a certain\r\npercentage of the total business between the various competitive points\r\nalong its line. If a company carried more than its share, it was\r\ncompelled to turn over the receipts from such additional traffic to its\r\nrivals, which paid it a nominal price for carriage. This allowance was\r\nalways made so low that there was no inducement for any company to seek\r\nto carry more than its allotment. The pool had its own executive,\r\nlegislative and judicial departments, and it enforced its decrees with\r\nan iron hand. It maintained a strong centralized government, and\r\nrebellious members had but little mercy to expect from it. It provided\r\nthat if any officer or representative of any company should authorize or\r\npromise, directly or indirectly, any variation from established tariffs,\r\nhe should be discharged from the service, with the reason stated. The\r\nstrong sentiment which we to-day find in the South in favor of State\r\ncontrol of railways is the direct result of the many evils which this\r\npowerful pool introduced into the railway business of that section of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nOther pools followed, as the Southwestern Association, organized in\r\n1876, to control the traffic between Chicago and St. Louis, and the\r\nMinnesota and the Colorado pools. Within a few years railroad pools\r\ncovered the whole country. All pursued the same object, viz., the\r\ncontrol of rates at competitive points, which enabled the companies to\r\nmaintain excessive schedule rates at local points.\r\n\r\nBetween 1875 and 1880 the pooling system rapidly spread all over the\r\nUnion. Wherever competition promised to regulate rates by the\r\napplication of the law of supply and demand, the pool was resorted to as\r\nthe never-failing remedy to preserve dividends on watered stock. As long\r\nas lake and canal navigation controlled the carriage of heavy freights\r\nbetween Chicago and New York by means of rates so low that railroads\r\nfound it, or at least thought it, impossible to compete with them in the\r\ntransportation of agricultural products during the greater part of the\r\nyear, railroad pools between Chicago and New York could not be\r\nsuccessfully maintained. In 1873 the railroads transported only about 30\r\nper cent. of this kind of freight from the West to Eastern ports.\r\n\r\nOwing, however, to the rapid decrease of the cost of transportation,\r\nrailroad companies from this time on were enabled to encroach rapidly\r\nupon the business of water routes, so that in 1876 they carried over 52\r\nper cent. of the entire volume of agricultural products that were moved\r\nfrom the West to the East. As long as these products were carried almost\r\nentirely by water from lake ports to the East, New York, as the terminus\r\nof this route, enjoyed decided advantages over the other Atlantic ports.\r\nWhen, however, the railroads commenced to successfully compete with the\r\nwater routes in the transportation of these commodities, a considerable\r\nshare of this business was diverted to Boston, Philadelphia and\r\nBaltimore, and it soon became apparent that these ports, in some\r\nrespects, enjoyed advantages for the export trade not possessed by New\r\nYork. It was, therefore, not surprising that the business men of these\r\ncities, together with the railroads terminating in them, made every\r\neffort to come in for their share of the traffic which was drifting away\r\nfrom New York.\r\n\r\nCompetition between the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nfor the Western through traffic dated back as far as 1869, the year in\r\nwhich both systems secured, through consolidation with connecting roads,\r\nthrough lines to Chicago. Rates fell in one year from $1.80 to 25 cents\r\nper hundred pounds. After a time the managers of the two companies met,\r\nand schedule rates were restored. Rates were, at least outwardly,\r\nmaintained until the Baltimore and Ohio and the Erie system entered\r\nChicago, and the Grand Trunk made connections with Milwaukee and other\r\nlake points, and thus disturbed through rates. All efforts to maintain\r\nthe level of the old tariffs, through agreements, proved now fruitless,\r\nfor both the Baltimore and Ohio and the Grand Trunk found it to their\r\ninterest to pursue independent policies, and refused to have their hands\r\ntied by an agreement with roads that were interested in continuing, if\r\npossible, the commercial supremacy of New York.\r\n\r\nRate skirmishing finally developed into open war in 1876, when\r\nfourth-class rates between Chicago and the Atlantic fell as low as 16\r\ncents per hundred. This rate, however, was eclipsed in July, 1878, when\r\nwheat was carried from Chicago to New York for 10 cents per hundred. The\r\nexisting conditions left no doubt in the minds of those familiar with\r\nrailroad tactics that this war was simply the precursor of a gigantic\r\ncombination between the trunk lines. An unsuccessful attempt to effect\r\nsuch a combination had been made before. In 1874 the managers of the\r\nErie, Pennsylvania and New York Central met at Saratoga for the purpose\r\nof devising means for the suppression of competition in the trunk line\r\ntraffic. This meeting, however, known in railroad history as the\r\nSaratoga Conference, was the first step toward the organization of a\r\ntrunk line pool, although the conference did not lead to any immediate\r\nresults, the Grand Trunk and the Baltimore and Ohio refusing to be bound\r\nby its decision. It was certainly no easy task to devise means to bring\r\nabout an effective and permanent combination among five large through\r\nlines with greatly conflicting interests.\r\n\r\nSo far pools had never failed to suppress competition wherever they were\r\norganized. But in the past pools had, almost without exception, only\r\nattempted to control rates between common points. They accomplished\r\ntheir object by a division of the entire traffic or earnings from the\r\ntraffic between common points. The schedule rates remained the same for\r\nall. But the traffic of the trunk lines brought a new factor into the\r\nproblem. Here the rival routes did not terminate at the same points. It\r\nwas contended by the Baltimore and Ohio that, whatever might be the\r\nfacilities of Baltimore for exporting agricultural products, that port\r\nwas at a disadvantage as compared with the more northern ports on\r\naccount of the longer voyage and higher ocean rates to Liverpool, and\r\nthat it could therefore not enter into a combination with the roads\r\nleading directly to New York and Philadelphia upon equal terms, since\r\nthis would divert its legitimate share of the through business to those\r\nports. The Grand Trunk, on the other hand, refused to enter the\r\ncombination because, not having any direct Chicago connection, it feared\r\nthat the enforcement of pool rates would materially diminish the volume\r\nof its business. As yet the railroad wiseacres did not seem to be equal\r\nto the emergency, and matters drifted along in the old channel. The rate\r\nwar of 1876 gradually brought about an understanding among the\r\nbelligerents. The competing roads accepted the terms offered, and with\r\nthis a new principle entered into the science of pooling. Rates between\r\nChicago and Baltimore were fixed somewhat lower than those between\r\nChicago and Philadelphia, and in turn Philadelphia was allowed a small\r\nadvantage over New York. This concession was made to equalize the\r\ndifference in the ocean rates of the competing ports. These equalizing\r\nor--to use railroad nomenclature--differential rates were subsequently\r\ngranted by pools to such roads as, on account of some disadvantage,\r\ncould not compete with other members of the pool on equal terms. Thus\r\nthe longest route was usually permitted to charge the lowest, and the\r\nshortest route the highest rate. This practice is in conformity with the\r\nprinciple of charging whatever the traffic will bear, but it is\r\ncertainly devoid of every consideration of justice and equity. If the\r\nlonger line can afford to carry freight at rates lower than schedule\r\nprices, no further proof is needed under ordinary circumstances that the\r\nregular schedule rates of the shorter line are exorbitant.\r\n\r\nThe concession of differential rates settled, at least temporarily, the\r\ndifficulties that had arisen out of the east-bound traffic of the trunk\r\nlines. This arrangement did not, however, in any way affect the traffic\r\nmoving in the opposite direction. The volume of west-bound freight is\r\nvery much larger at New York than at any other of the Atlantic ports. In\r\norder to get its share of the business, each trunk line maintained an\r\noffice in New York. These offices eagerly solicited business for their\r\nrespective roads, and the freights which they received for\r\ntransportation to the West would be forwarded either directly or by a\r\ncircuitous route; but, the longer the route, the lower as a rule was the\r\ncompensation asked for the service. Under these circumstances\r\ncompetition was brisk, and the profits realized were far from satisfying\r\nthe cupidity of the competing lines. It was apparent to their managers\r\nthat the competition in the west-bound traffic was similar to that\r\nformerly existing between Chicago and Mississippi and Missouri River\r\npoints, which had promptly yielded to pools. The temporary adjustment of\r\nthe more perplexing questions which had arisen out of the east-bound\r\ntraffic now paved the way for a pooling arrangement for the west-bound\r\nfreight. The Southern Pool, under the management of Albert Fink, had\r\nlong attracted the attention of the trunk line managers. Its system of\r\ndividing the traffic, of reporting to a central office and of hearing\r\nand deciding complaints had enabled it to exert an almost absolute\r\ncontrol over its members, to compel them to make honest returns and to\r\nprevent rupture and rebellion. It was believed that a pool of the trunk\r\nlines could not be effective or permanent unless organized upon the\r\nSouthern basis and presided over by a trunk expert. Accordingly, when in\r\n1877 an agreement for the pooling of the west-bound traffic was reached\r\nby the trunk lines, Mr. Fink was tendered the position of pool\r\ncommissioner. Under the agreement reached the total tonnage of the\r\nwest-bound business was divided in such a way that the Erie and New York\r\nCentral roads each received 33 per cent., the Pennsylvania 25 per cent.,\r\nand the Baltimore and Ohio 9 per cent. of it. If any road received more\r\nfreight than was allotted to it by the pool, it delivered such surplus\r\nto the pool, or rather to such a road as the pool commissioner\r\ndesignated as not having received its allotment. The success of this\r\npool from a railroad point of view made the trunk lines anxious to\r\norganize a similar pool for the whole east-bound traffic. It was\r\nproposed to control by such a combination the rates on all the\r\neast-bound traffic of the Northwest, by making Chicago the pooling\r\ncenter, fixing for it a schedule of rates and making the rates of all\r\nthe railroad centers in the West and Northwest dependent upon it. The\r\ncombination was to comprise more than forty companies, controlling over\r\n25,000 miles of road. The scheme was tried for three months in 1878,\r\nbut proved a failure, owing to the fact that nearly all of the many\r\ndiverging interests sought their own advantage. The Eastern and Western\r\ntrunk line pools were, through the efforts of their commissioner,\r\nsuccessfully maintained, though even their harmony was occasionally\r\nmarred by a short war precipitated by such members as would think\r\nthemselves entitled to larger shares of the spoils. But a readjustment\r\nwould invariably follow, and the expenditures of the war would be taxed\r\nup to the public.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the gigantic Western pool which had been organized\r\nunder the protectorate of the trunk lines, the companies which had\r\ncomposed it formed such local combinations as their individual interests\r\ndictated. It is doubtful whether during the five years immediately\r\npreceding the passage of the Interstate Commerce Law there was any\r\njunction of two or more roads in the United States which, except during\r\nthe period of an occasional railroad war, had any competition in the\r\ntransportation business. As has been shown before, discriminations\r\nwithout number were practiced between places and persons; goods were not\r\nunfrequently carried at a loss; but the general public was, as a rule,\r\ncompelled to pay what the traffic would bear, or rather what the pooling\r\nroads thought it could bear.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by railroad managers that pools are the only effective\r\ncontrivances for checking ruinous competition among railroad carriers,\r\nand that they are therefore justifiable as a means of self-protection.\r\nThis might perhaps be a valid argument if any attack were made upon the\r\nrailroads which encroached upon their rights or endangered their\r\nexistence, but if railroad companies are disposed to cut each other's\r\nthroats, the public should not be made to pay the penalty of their\r\ndepravity. As long as schedule rates are unreasonably high, railroads\r\nwill be tempted to offer to certain shippers low secret rates; but as\r\nsoon as all rates have been leveled down to a point where they will\r\nyield only a fair profit with good management, the inducement to cut\r\nbelow them is largely taken away. Pools, far from being a remedy for the\r\nevils of excessive competition, will in the end only aggravate the\r\ndisease which they attempt to cure. The high rates which they maintain\r\nattract the attention of speculative men and lead to the construction of\r\nrival roads. While the traffic remains the same, the proceeds must then\r\nbe divided among a larger number of carriers. Thus the construction of\r\nunnecessary roads, which has often been the subject of bitter complaint\r\non the part of the older roads, is chargeable directly to their wrong\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objections to industrial and commercial\r\ncombinations is that they paralyze trade. Competition stimulates every\r\ncompetitor to offer the best at the lowest possible price. This\r\nincreases the demand for the commodity, and both the producer and the\r\nconsumer are in the end benefited by the operation of this law. On the\r\nother hand, combinations, or, what is the same, monopolies, increase the\r\nprice, remove the stimulus to excellence, and reduce the demand, and\r\nthereby affect injuriously the producer and consumer alike. Competition\r\nin the railway service would mean an improved service and lower rates\r\nand would speedily be followed by a large increase of business.\r\n\r\nAnother serious objection to pooling is that it invariably leads to\r\nperiodic wars, which unsettle all business, and but too often introduce\r\ninto legitimate trade the element of chance. These wars give, moreover,\r\nto designing railroad managers an opportunity to enrich themselves by\r\nstock speculations at the expense of the stockholders, whose interests\r\nthey use as a football for the accomplishment of their selfish ends.\r\nWhen rates are reduced to a right level, and are properly adjusted, and\r\nare equal to all, even railroad men will find no necessity for pools.\r\nThe desire for such a combination is a desire to impose upon somebody,\r\nor some locality, or the public at large. The proposition to give legal\r\nsanction to pools, made by railroad managers, is preposterous; and even\r\na pool to be approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission is out of\r\nthe question, as it would cause the railroads to increase their efforts\r\nto control the appointment of the commission. However honest it may look\r\non its face, however plausible may be the arguments produced in its\r\nfavor, it should not be permitted.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but under the proposed pooling arrangement railroad\r\ninterests, watered stocks and all, would be cared for, but there is\r\nevery reason to believe that public interests would not be properly\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nSo long as servility by a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nto railroad influences serves as a stepping-stone to a high position in\r\nthe employ of railroad combinations, with a salary of three or four\r\ntimes that of an Interstate Commerce Commissioner, so long will it be\r\nunsafe to permit such powers to be vested in that commission.\r\n\r\nPooling by railroads should not be permitted, if permitted at all, so\r\nlong as representatives of speculative interests have a voice in their\r\nmanagement, and not until all fictitious valuations are altogether\r\nbanished from the equation, and until the roads are brought under\r\ncomplete Government control. There is no more necessity for pools among\r\nrailroads than there is among merchants and manufacturers. The capital\r\nactually invested in railroads is now receiving larger returns than\r\ninvestments in other lines of business, and their incomes are increasing\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\nEvery pooling combination of railroad companies for the maintenance of\r\nrates is a violation of common law. From time immemorial the law has\r\nstamped as a conspiracy any agreement between individuals to support\r\neach other in an undertaking to injure public trade. The Interstate\r\nCommerce Act reasserts this principle, and provides penalties for the\r\nmaintenance of such combinations among railroad companies. If, in spite\r\nof this act, the evil still exists, it is no argument against the merits\r\nof the law, but it does prove that the machinery provided for its\r\nenforcement is insufficient. That railroad companies can be made to\r\nrespect the law there can be no doubt; but much cannot be accomplished\r\nunless the people fully realize the magnitude of the undertaking and\r\nvest the Government with sufficient power to cope with an organized\r\nforce whose total annual revenue is nearly three times as large as that\r\nof the United States. The discussion of the question how this may be\r\ndone will be reserved for a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS IN POLITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question might be asked how the railroad companies for many years in\r\nsuccession have been able to prevent State control and pursue a policy\r\nso detrimental to the best interests of the public. One might think that\r\nin a republic where the people are the source of all power, and where\r\nall officers are directly or indirectly selected by the people to carry\r\nout their wishes and to administer the government in their interest, a\r\ncoterie of men bent on pecuniary gain would not be permitted to subvert\r\nthose principles of the common law and public economy which from time\r\nimmemorial have been the recognized anchors of the liberty of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\nThe statement that under a free government it is possible for a few to\r\nsuppress the many might almost sound absurd to a monarchist, and yet is\r\nit true that for the past twenty-five years the public affairs of this\r\ncountry have been unduly controlled by a few hundred railroad managers.\r\n\r\nTo perpetuate without molestation their unjust practices and prevent any\r\napproach to an assertion of the principle of State control of railroad\r\ntransportation, railroad managers have secured, wherever possible, the\r\nco-operation of public officials, and, in fact, of every semi-public and\r\nprivate agency capable of affecting public opinion. Their great wealth\r\nand power has made it possible for them to influence to a greater or\r\nless extent every department of the National and State governments.\r\nTheir influence extends from the township assessor's office to the\r\nnational capital, from the publisher of the small cross-roads paper to\r\nthe editorial staff of the metropolitan daily. It is felt in every\r\ncaucus, in every nominating convention and at every election. Typical\r\nrailroad men draw no party lines, advocate no principles, and take\r\nlittle interest in any but their own cause; they are, as Mr. Gould\r\nexpressed it, Democrats in Democratic and Republicans in Republican\r\ndistricts. The large means at the command of railroad companies, their\r\nfavors, their vast armies of employes and attorneys and their almost\r\nequally large force of special retainers are freely employed to carry\r\ninto execution their political designs, and the standard of ethics\r\nrecognized by railroad managers in these exploits is an exceedingly low\r\none.\r\n\r\nIt is a settled principle of these men that, if they can prevent it, no\r\nperson not known to be friendly to their cause must be placed into any\r\npublic office where he might have an opportunity to aid or injure their\r\ninterests. The records of the various candidates of the principal\r\nparties for city, county, State and national offices are therefore\r\ncarefully canvassed previous to the primaries, the most acceptable among\r\nthe candidates of each party are selected as the railroad candidates,\r\nand the local representatives of the railroad interest in each party are\r\ninstructed to use all means in their power to secure their nomination.\r\n\r\nIf none but candidates who are servile to the railroad interest are\r\nnominated by the principal parties, the election is permitted to take\r\nits own course, for, whichever side is successful, the railroad interest\r\nis safe. If, however, there is reason to believe that a nominee is not\r\nas devoted to their interests as the nominee of an opposing party, the\r\nlatter is sure to receive at the polls whatever support railroad\r\ninfluence can give him. That a public official elected by the grace of a\r\nrailroad manager is but too apt to become a tool in his hands needs no\r\nproof. Both gratitude and fear tie the average politician to the\r\npowerful forces which can control his political destiny.\r\n\r\nThe railroad manager, on the other hand, always kindly remembers his\r\nofficeholding friends as long as they are loyal and in a position to\r\nserve him. Before the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act there was\r\nevery year a wholesale distribution of railroad passes among public\r\nofficeholders and other prominent politicians. The pass was the token of\r\nthe continued good will of the railroad dignitaries as the withholding\r\nof the \"courtesy\" was a certain indication of their displeasure. If the\r\nofficeholder had personal or political friends whom he desired to have\r\nrecognized, an intimation of this desire was generally sufficient to\r\nhave the pass privilege even extended to them. And yet these favors were\r\nnot bestowed indiscriminately. Thus the pass credit of a county official\r\nwas more limited than that of an officer of the State, and the latter\r\nclass were again rated according to their influence and rank.\r\nFurthermore, while annual passes were thus freely distributed among one\r\nclass of officials, others could obtain them only by making special\r\napplication for them. Members of the legislature would not unfrequently\r\nreceive their supply of railroad passes before their certificates of\r\nelection were issued, but legislative committee clerks and employes in\r\nthe various departments of the State government were required to satisfy\r\nthe railroad authorities that they were in a position to aid or to\r\ninjure the railroad cause before their names were placed on the list of\r\npersons \"entitled to the courtesy\".\r\n\r\nOf course the judiciary, as a coördinate branch of the government, could\r\nnot well be slighted. Indeed, previous to the enactment of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law, a judge would have regarded it an affront if he\r\nhad not been furnished with passes by the various companies operating\r\nrailroads in his district. It appears that the law has not entirely\r\ncorrected this abuse, for only about two years ago the Chicago _News_\r\nmade the discovery that nearly every judge in the city of Chicago\r\ntraveled on passes. It is strange to what extent the pass often debased\r\nthe judiciary. It was not unfrequent for judges to solicit passes for\r\nfamily and friends, and instances might be named where they demanded\r\nthem in a wholesale way.\r\n\r\nThe impudent demands were usually honored by the railroad authorities,\r\nwho reasoned that they could better afford to bear the shameless\r\neffrontery of the ermined extortioner than the damage which might result\r\nto them from adverse decisions.\r\n\r\nA railroad pass, when presented by a public official or even by any\r\npublic man, is now, in nine cases out of ten, a certificate of dishonor\r\nand a token of servility, and is so recognized by railroad officials.\r\nWhat equivalent railroad companies expect for the pass \"courtesy\" is\r\nwell illustrated by the experience of an Iowa judge. This gentleman, who\r\nhad been on the bench for years and always had been favored with passes\r\nby the various companies operating lines in his district, at the\r\nbeginning of a new year failed to receive the customary pass from a\r\nleading road. Meeting its chief attorney, he took occasion to call his\r\nattention to what he supposed to have been an oversight on the part of\r\nthe officer charged with the distribution of the passes. The attorney\r\nseemed to take in the situation at once. \"Judge,\" said he, \"did you not\r\nrecently decide an important case against our company?\" \"And was my\r\ndecision,\" replied the Judge, \"not in accordance with law as well as\r\nwith justice?\" The attorney did not answer this question, but in the\r\ncourse of a few days the Judge received the desired pass. A few months\r\nlater it again became the Judge's unpleasant duty to render a decision\r\nadverse to the same company. This second act of judicial independence\r\nwas not forgiven, and the next time he presented his pass it was\r\nunceremoniously taken up by the conductor in the presence of a large\r\nnumber of passengers, and he was required to pay his fare.\r\n\r\nEmployes, while engaged in the legitimate business of their companies,\r\nshould, of course, be transported free, but a great many persons receive\r\npasses and are classed as employes who never render any legitimate\r\nservice for the company giving the pass, and by far the greater portion\r\nof passes are not granted from pure motives, but are given for the\r\npurpose of corrupting their holders. It arouses antagonism, because as a\r\nrule passes are given to people who are fully able to pay their fare and\r\nare denied to those who are least able to pay it. The passenger who pays\r\nhis fare and then finds that a large number of his fellow-passengers\r\ntravel on passes realizes that he is compelled to pay a higher fare that\r\nothers may be carried free. He feels that he is unjustly discriminated\r\nagainst, and wonders why such discrimination is tolerated in a country\r\nwhose institutions are founded upon the very principle of equal rights\r\nto all. A good anecdote is related which well illustrates this feeling.\r\nA farmer and a lawyer occupied the same seat in a railroad car. When the\r\nconductor came the farmer presented his ticket, and the lawyer a pass.\r\nThe farmer's features did not conceal his disgust when he discovered\r\nthat his seat-mate was a deadhead. The lawyer, trying to assuage the\r\nindignation of the observing granger, said to him: \"My friend, you\r\ntravel very cheaply on this road.\" \"I think so myself,\" replied the\r\nfarmer, \"considering the fact that I have to pay fare for both of us.\"\r\n\r\nBut what must be a passenger's surprise when he finds that the judge who\r\nto-morrow is to preside at the trial of a case in which the railroad\r\ncompany is a party to-day accepts free transportation at its hands. A\r\njudge may scorn the charge that he is influenced by a railroad pass, but\r\nhis fellow-passenger who has paid his fare cannot understand why the\r\nrailroad company should give passes to one class of people and refuse\r\nthem to others, if it does not consider one more than others to be in a\r\nposition to reciprocate its favors.\r\n\r\nIn their endeavor to win over the courts, however, the railroads do by\r\nno means confine their attention to the judges. They are well aware that\r\na biased jury is often more useful to them than a biased judge, and\r\nefforts are made by them to contaminate juries, or at least prejudice\r\nthem in their favor. A prominent Iowa attorney, the legal and political\r\nfactotum of a large railroad corporation, for years made it a practice\r\nto supply jurors with passes. In one instance, when it was shown in\r\ncourt by the opposing counsel that all jurors in the case on trial had\r\naccepted passes from the railroad company which was the defendant in the\r\ncase, the judge found himself compelled to discharge the whole jury. The\r\nargument made by this counsel, in support of his motion that the jury be\r\ndischarged, was certainly to the point. He showed that in order to have\r\nan equal chance for justice it would be necessary for his client to give\r\neach juror at least fifty dollars to offset the bribes given to them by\r\nthe railroad company.\r\n\r\nThat it has always been the policy of railroad managers to propitiate\r\nthe judiciary is a fact too generally known among public men to admit of\r\ncontradiction. If a judge owes his nomination or election to railroad\r\ninfluences, railroad managers feel that they have in this a guarantee of\r\nloyalty. If, however, he acquires the ermine in spite of railroad\r\nopposition, every effort is made to conciliate the new dispenser of the\r\nlaws. The bestowal of unusual favors, flattery, simulated friendship and\r\na thousand other strategies are brought into requisition to capture the\r\nwayward jurist. If he proves docile, if his decisions improve with time\r\nand show a gradual appreciation of the particular sacredness of\r\ncorporate rights, the railroad manager will even forgive him his former\r\nheresy and rally to his support in the future. But if he asserts his\r\nconvictions, if he attempts to discharge the duties of his responsible\r\noffice without fear or favor, if he can neither be corrupted nor\r\nintimidated, all available railroad forces will be marshaled against him\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be surprising that, under such circumstances, there always has\r\nbeen a tendency among judges to be conservative and to give the\r\nrailroads the benefit of the doubt in their decisions. Judges well know\r\nthat railroad companies appeal almost invariably when the decision of a\r\nlower court is adverse to them, but private citizens only in exceptional\r\ncases. They also know that railroads never forgive adverse decisions,\r\nwhether right or wrong, while private citizens, as a rule, accept the\r\ndecision of the court as justice, and do not hold the judge responsible\r\nfor its being adverse to them. Our judiciary is, and probably always has\r\nbeen, as incorruptible as the judiciary of any country in the world; but\r\nour judges are made of no better material than our legislative or\r\nexecutive officers. Weak men, in all stations, are influenced by wealth\r\nand power, and weak judges can always be found who will be led or forced\r\nfrom the path of duty so long as corrupt men are permitted to manage\r\nrailroads and to remain in possession of a power only inferior to that\r\nof an autocratic ruler.\r\n\r\nThe influence which railroads exert extends from the lowest to the\r\nhighest court of the land. Federal courts have more than once been\r\nsuccessfully appealed to to give legal sanction to the perpetuation of\r\ngigantic frauds, or to frustrate attempts made by the individual States\r\nto place restrictions upon roads operated within their respective\r\nborders. Twenty years ago a Federal judge aided Mr. Gould in his\r\nnotorious Erie transactions, and in more recent years a Federal circuit\r\njudge in the West threw the property of the Wabash Railroad Company,\r\nupon the application of its own directors, into the hands of receivers\r\nselected by its former managers without the knowledge or notice of its\r\ncreditors, and issued orders for the management of the property which\r\ngreatly discriminated in favor of certain bondholders and were so\r\nmanifestly unjust that Judge Gresham, before whom the case was\r\nsubsequently brought, did not hesitate to say to them that \"the boldness\r\nof this scheme to aid the purchasing committee, by denying equal right\r\nto all bondholders secured by the same mortgages, is equaled only by its\r\ninjustice.\" At the same time one of the counsel for the dissenting\r\nbondholders characterized these strange orders as \"the highwayman's\r\nclutch on our throat, the robber's demand, 'Your money or your life.'\"\r\n\r\nThe decision which the Supreme Court of the United States rendered in\r\nthe Granger cases in 1876, affirming the right of a State to control\r\nrailroad charges for the transportation of passengers and freight wholly\r\nwithin the State, was a serious disappointment to railroad men, for it\r\nwas the first step toward wresting from them the power to arbitrarily\r\ncontrol the commerce of the country. Ever since that time it has been\r\ntheir determined purpose to bring about, if possible, a reconstruction\r\nof the Federal Supreme Court, in order to secure a reversal or\r\nmodification of the Granger decision. In the case of Peik vs. Chicago,\r\n94th U. S., 176, the Supreme Court laid down the following broad\r\nprinciple of law: \"Where property has been clothed with the public\r\ninterest, the legislature may fix a limit to that which shall in law be\r\nreasonable for its use. This limit binds the courts as well as the\r\npeople. If it has been improperly fixed, the legislature, not the\r\ncourts, must be appealed to for a change.\" In one of the Granger cases\r\nthe same court used the following language: \"We know that this is a\r\npower which may be abused, but that is no argument against its\r\nexistence. For protection against abuses by legislatures, the people\r\nmust resort to the polls.\"\r\n\r\nFourteen years later, in the case of C. M. & St. P. R. Co. vs. Minn.,\r\ndecided in October, 1890, the same court rendered a decision so\r\nindefinite that the lawyers differed much in their opinions as to its\r\nmeaning, and it appears that the members of the court who made the\r\ndecision also differed in their opinions as to the meaning of the\r\ndecision; for Justice Bradley said in his dissenting opinion, in which\r\nJustice Gray and Justice Lamar concurred, that the decision practically\r\noverruled Munn vs. Illinois; but the same court, in a case entitled Budd\r\nvs. New York, submitted in October, 1891, and decision rendered February\r\n29, 1892, and opinion delivered by Justice Blatchford, in referring to\r\nthe Minnesota case, after quoting the above statement from Justice\r\nBradley, said: \"But the opinion of the court did not say so, nor did it\r\nrefer to Munn vs. Illinois, and we are of opinion that the decision in\r\nthat case is, as will be hereafter shown, quite distinguishable from the\r\npresent case.\"\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that this court has adhered to the decision in Munn\r\nvs. Illinois, and to the doctrines announced in the opinion of the court\r\nin that case, and those doctrines have since been repeatedly enforced in\r\nthe decisions of the courts of the States.\r\n\r\nJudge Brewer, whose zeal for the defense of corporate interests seems to\r\namount almost to a craze, dissented. He said: \"I dissent from the\r\nopinion and judgment in these cases. The main proposition upon which\r\nthey rest is, in my judgment, radically unsound. It is the doctrine of\r\nMunn vs. Illinois reaffirmed. The paternal theory of government is to me\r\nodious. Justice Field and Justice Brown concur with me in this dissent.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that Justices Brewer and Brown were both\r\nappointed to the Supreme bench by President Harrison.\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to believe that, unless the people of the United\r\nStates are on the alert, as railroad managers always are, there is, with\r\nfurther changes in the personnel of the court, danger of its deviating\r\nfrom the sound principles of law laid down in its decision in the\r\nGranger cases. Railroad attorneys have repeatedly been raised to seats\r\nin the highest tribunal in the land. So great is the power of the\r\nrailroad interests, and so persistent are they in their demands, that,\r\nunless a strong public sentiment records its protest, their candidates\r\nfor appointive offices are but too apt to be successful. Representatives\r\nof the railroads sit in the Congress of the United States, others are\r\nmembers of the national campaign committees of both of the great\r\npolitical parties, others control the politics of the States, and their\r\ninfluence reaches to the White House, whether its occupant is aware of\r\nit or not. Other interests in the past have succeeded in securing the\r\nappointment of biased men as judges of the Supreme Court who afterwards\r\ncould always be relied upon to render decisions in their favor. Will the\r\npeople profit by their experience, or will they be indifferent to the\r\ndanger which surrounds them, until nothing short of a political upheaval\r\ncan restore to them these rights of sovereignty, of which they have so\r\ninsidiously been deprived?\r\n\r\nHuman gratitude is such that even high-minded men who, through the\r\ninfluence of the railroad interest, have been placed upon the Federal\r\nbench, find it impossible to divest themselves of all bias when called\r\nupon to decide a case in which their benefactors are interested. Such is\r\nthe human mind that, when clouded by prejudice, it will forever be blind\r\nto its own fault. Even the members of so high a tribunal as the\r\nElectoral Commission which decided the presidential contest between\r\nHayes and Tilden could not divest themselves of their prejudices; each\r\none, Republican or Democrat, voted for the candidate of the party with\r\nwhich he had cast his political fortune.\r\n\r\nLast January, in an address delivered before the New York State Bar\r\nAssociation at Albany, Mr. Justice Brewer reminded his hearers that the\r\nrights of the railroads \"stand as secure in the eye and in the custody\r\nof the law as the purposes of justice in the thought of God.\" And\r\nfurther on they were told that \"there are to-day $11,000,000,000\r\ninvested in railroad property, whose owners in this country number less\r\nthan two million persons. Can it be that whether that immense sum shall\r\nearn a dollar or bring the slightest recompense to those who have\r\ninvested perhaps their all in that business, and are thus aiding in the\r\ndevelopment of the country, depends wholly upon the whim and greed of\r\nthat great majority of sixty millions who do not own a dollar? It may be\r\nsaid that that majority will not be so foolish, selfish and cruel as to\r\nstrip that property of its earning capacity. I say that so long as\r\nconstitutional guarantees lift on American soil their buttresses and\r\nbulwarks against wrong, and so long as the American judiciary breathes\r\nthe free air of courage, it cannot.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately judicial buttresses and bulwarks have not always been\r\nlifted against wrong. Judge Taney, like Brewer, supposed that it was\r\nleft at his time for his court to preserve the peace and provide for the\r\nsafety of the nation; but history has shown that we cannot depend upon\r\nthat high tribunal for safety when it is controlled by weak or\r\ninefficient men.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider what \"that great majority\" has done for this country in\r\nthe past, and is doing for it at the present time, and especially when\r\nwe contrast its sense of justice and right with the weakness and\r\ninability of some of its public servants, does it not seem to be a\r\nlittle presumptuous for them to assume that \"the danger is from the\r\nmultitudes--the majority, with whom is the power,\" and that, were it not\r\nfor their superior wisdom and patriotic action, this great government of\r\nthe people, by the people and for the people would be a failure?\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln never feared \"the whim and greed\" of \"that great majority,\"\r\nbut he had at all times implicit confidence in the great mass of the\r\npeople, and they in return had full confidence that no temptation of\r\nwealth or power was sufficient to seduce his integrity.\r\n\r\nWe cannot dismiss this subject without referring to a stratagem which\r\nrailroads have in the past repeatedly resorted to for the purpose of\r\nremoving from the bench judges of independent minds whom they found it\r\nimpossible to control. This stratagem consists of a well-disguised\r\nbribe, by which a Federal judge is changed into a railroad attorney with\r\na princely salary. The railroad thus gets rid of an undesirable judge\r\nand gains a desirable solicitor at a price at which they could well have\r\nafforded to pension the judge.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of a broker's circular letter sent to prominent\r\nbankers of Iowa, and shows that even the Clerk of the United States\r\nCourt is not overlooked:\r\n\r\n      \"----, June 30th, 1892.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. ----,\r\n\r\n      \"We offer, subject to sale at par and interest, note $2,500.\r\n      Date, July 5th, 1892. Time, six months; rate, 6 per cent.\r\n      Payable where desired. Maker, ---- Endorser, Judge ---- Mr.\r\n      ----, the maker, is clerk of the United States Circuit Court\r\n      at ---- Judge ---- the well known attorney of the ---- and\r\n      ---- Railway Co., of ----, stated to us to be worth $150,000\r\n      to $200,000. Can you use it?\"\r\n\r\nWhile railroad managers rely upon servile courts as a last resort to\r\ndefeat the will of the sovereign people, they are far from losing sight\r\nof the importance of controlling the legislative branch of the\r\ngovernment. By preventing what they are pleased to call unfriendly\r\nlegislation they are more likely to prevent friction with public\r\nopinion, and they avoid at the same time the risk of permanently\r\nprejudicing their cause by an adverse opinion upon a constitutional\r\nquestion which they may find it necessary to raise in order to nullify a\r\nlegislative act. There are three distinct means employed by them to\r\ncontrol legislative action. First, the election to legislative offices\r\nof men who are, for some personal reason, adherents to the railroad\r\ncause. Second, the delusion, or even corruption, of weak or unscrupulous\r\nmembers of legislative bodies. Third, the employment of professional and\r\nincidental lobbyists and the subsidizing of newspapers, or their\r\nrepresentatives, for the purpose of influencing members of legislative\r\nbodies and their constituencies.\r\n\r\nThere are probably in every legislative body a number of members who are\r\nin some way or other connected with railroad corporations. No doubt, a\r\nmajority of these are personally irreproachable and even so high-minded\r\nas to always postpone private for public interest; yet there are also\r\nthose whose political advancement was brought about by railroad managers\r\nfor the very purpose of having in the legislative body servile members\r\nwho could always be relied upon to serve their corporate masters.\r\nNevertheless, were railroad interests restricted to the votes of these\r\nmen for their support, the public would probably have no cause for alarm\r\non account of the presence of railroad representatives in legislative\r\nbodies, but, as many other interests seek favorable legislation,\r\nrailroad men are often enabled to gain support for their cause by a\r\ncorrupt bargain for votes, and it is thus possible for them to double,\r\ntriple, and even quadruple, their original strength, by a policy of\r\nreciprocity.\r\n\r\nAs in Congress and State legislatures, so these representatives of the\r\nrailroads may be found in our city councils. The leaders of the\r\nrailroads in Congress and in the legislatures of the various States\r\nusually rely upon discretion for obtaining their end, but railroad\r\naldermen with but few exceptions seek to demonstrate their loyalty to\r\nthe cause to which they are committed by a zealous advocacy of extreme\r\nmeasures, and will not unfrequently even gain their end through the most\r\nunscrupulous combinations. If their votes, together with such support as\r\nthey obtain by making trades, are not sufficient to carry out or defeat\r\na measure which the railroad interests may favor or oppose, even more\r\nquestionable means are employed to gain a sufficient number of votes to\r\ncommand a majority.\r\n\r\nOutright bribery is probably the means least often employed by\r\ncorporations to carry their measures. While it may be true that the vote\r\nof every weak and unscrupulous legislator is a subject of barter, money\r\nis not often the compensation for which it is obtained. It is the policy\r\nof the political corruption committees of corporations to ascertain the\r\nweakness and wants of every man whose services they are likely to need,\r\nand to attack him, if his surrender should be essential to their\r\nvictory, at his weakest point. Men with political ambition are\r\nencouraged to aspire to preferment and are assured of corporate support\r\nto bring it about. Briefless lawyers are promised corporate business or\r\nsalaried attorneyships. Those in financial straits are accommodated with\r\nloans. Vain men are flattered and given newspaper notoriety. Others are\r\ngiven passes for their families and their friends. Shippers are given\r\nadvantages in rates over their competitors; in fact, every legislator\r\ndisposed to barter his vote away receives for it compensation which\r\ncombines the maximum of desirability with the minimum of violence to his\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nThose who attempt to influence or control legislative bodies in behalf\r\nof interested parties are collectively called the lobby. As a rule, the\r\nlobby consists of prominent politicians likely to have influence with\r\nmembers of their own party; of men of good address and easy conscience,\r\nfamiliar alike with the subject under consideration and legislative\r\nprocedure, and last, but not least, of confidential agents authorized\r\nand prepared to enter into secret negotiations with venal members. The\r\nlobby which represents the railroad companies at legislative sessions is\r\nusually the largest, the most sagacious and the most unscrupulous of\r\nall. Its work is systematic and thorough, its methods are unscrupulous\r\nand its resources great. Yet all the members of a legislative body\r\ncannot be bribed, either by money, or position, or favors. Some of them\r\nwill not vote for any proposed measure unless they can be convinced that\r\nit is for the public welfare. These legislators, if their votes are\r\nneeded, are turned over to the persuasive eloquence of those members of\r\nthe lobby who, apparently, have come to the capital moved by a patriotic\r\nimpulse to set erring legislators right on public questions. Their\r\nfamiliarity with public matters, their success in public life, their\r\nhigh standing in political circles, their apparent disinterestedness and\r\ntheir plausible arguments all combine to give them great influence over\r\nnew and inexperienced members. In extreme cases influential constituents\r\nof doubtful members are sent for at the last moment to labor with their\r\nrepresentatives, and to assure them that the sentiment of their\r\ndistricts is in favor of the measure advocated by the railroads.\r\nTelegrams pour in upon the unsuspecting members. Petitions in favor of\r\nthe proposed measure are also hastily circulated among the more\r\nunsophisticated constituents of members sensitive to public opinion, and\r\nare then presented to them as an unmistakable indication of the popular\r\nwill, although the total number of signers forms a very small percentage\r\nof the total number of voters of the districts in which these petitions\r\nwere circulated. A common method employed by the railroad lobby in Iowa\r\nhas been to arouse, by ingenious arguments, the prejudices of the people\r\nof one part of the State against those of another, or of one class\r\nagainst those of another class; for instance, the East against the West,\r\nor that portion of the State the least supplied with railroad facilities\r\nagainst that which is best supplied; or the river cities against the\r\ninterior cities; or the country people against the city people; or the\r\nfarmer against the merchant, and always artfully keeping in view the\r\nopportunity to utilize one side or the other in their own interest.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful reinforcement of the railroad lobby is not unfrequently\r\na subsidized press and its correspondents. The party organs at the\r\ncapital are especially selected to defend as sound measures, either from\r\na partisan or non-partisan standpoint, legislation of questionable\r\npropriety desired by the railroads. When such measures are advocated by\r\nparty organs, partisan members, either from fear or prejudice, are apt\r\nto \"fall into line,\" and then to rely upon these organs to defend their\r\naction. Editors, reporters and correspondents are even retained as\r\nactive lobbyists and give the railroad managers' cause the benefit of\r\ntheir prestige. To such an extent has the abuse of the press been\r\ncarried that a considerable number of its unworthy representatives look\r\nupon railroad subsidies as legitimate perquisites which they will exact\r\nthrough blackmailing and other means of compulsion if they are not\r\noffered. A case may be cited here to illustrate their mode of operation,\r\nas well as the ethics of railroad lobbies. During one of the sessions of\r\nthe Iowa legislature a newspaper correspondent came in possession of\r\nsome information which reflected severely on the railroad lobby. He made\r\nhis information the subject of a spicy article and showed it to a\r\nfriend who stood close to the gentleman chiefly implicated, with the\r\nremark that nothing but a hundred dollar bill would prevent the\r\ntransmission of the article by the evening mail to the paper which he\r\nrepresented. Before sundown the stipulated price for the correspondent's\r\nsilence was paid, and an enemy was turned into a friend.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bryce says of the American lobby system: \"All legislative\r\nbodies which control important pecuniary interests are as sure to have a\r\nlobby as an army to have its camp followers. Where the body is, there\r\nwill the vultures be gathered together.\" To such an extent is the lobby\r\nabuse carried that some large corporations select their regular\r\nsolicitors more for their qualifications as lobbyists than for their\r\nlegal lore. It is a common remark among lawyers that a great company in\r\nChicago pays a third-class lawyer, who has the reputation of being a\r\nfirst-class lobbyist, an extravagant salary and calls him general\r\nsolicitor, while it relies upon other lawyers to attend to its important\r\nlegal business. The readiness of members of the bar to serve wealthy\r\ncorporations is fast bringing the legal profession of America into\r\ndisrepute abroad. The author just quoted, in speaking of its moral\r\nstandard, says: \"But I am bound to add that some judicious American\r\nobservers hold that the last thirty years have witnessed a certain\r\ndecadence in the bar of the great cities. They say that the growth of\r\nenormously rich and powerful corporations, willing to pay vast sums for\r\nquestionable services, has seduced the virtue of some counsel whose\r\neminence makes their example important, and that in a few States the\r\ndegradation of the bench has led to secret understandings between judges\r\nand counsel for the perversion of justice.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, able and honorable attorneys employed by railroad\r\ncompanies, but often railroad lawyers are selected more for their\r\npolitical influence, tact and ingenuity than for legal ability, and, as\r\na rule, the political lawyer receives much better compensation for his\r\nservices than does the lawyer who attends strictly to legitimate legal\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe danger from railroad corporations lies in their great wealth,\r\ncontrolled by so few persons, and the want of publicity in their\r\nbusiness. Were they required to render accounts of their expenditures to\r\nthe public, legislative corruption funds would soon be numbered with the\r\ndefunct abuses of railroad corporations, and, with bribes wanting in the\r\nbalance of legislative equivalents, the representatives of the people\r\ncould be trusted to enact laws just alike to the corporations and the\r\npublic, while asserting the right of the people to control the public\r\nhighway and to make it subservient to the welfare of the many instead of\r\nthe enrichment of the few. A wise law regulating lobbies exists in\r\nMassachusetts. Every lobbyist is required to register, as soon as he\r\nappears at the Capitol, to state in whose interest and in what capacity\r\nhe attends the legislative session, to keep a faithful account of his\r\nexpenses and to file a copy of the same with the Secretary of State.\r\nWere a similar law enacted and enforced by every State legislature, as\r\nwell as by Congress, the power of railroad lobbies would be curtailed.\r\n\r\nRailroad managers never do things by halves. Well realizing that it is\r\nin the power of a fearless executive, by his veto, to render futile the\r\nachievements of a costly lobby and to injure or benefit their interests\r\nby pursuing an aggressive or conservative policy in the enforcement of\r\nthe laws, they never fail to make their influence felt in the selection\r\nof a chief magistrate, either of the Nation or of an individual State.\r\nNo delegate, with their permission, ever attends a national convention,\r\nRepublican or Democratic, if he is not known to favor the selection of a\r\nman as the presidential candidate of his party whose conservatism in all\r\nmatters pertaining to railroad interests is well established. At these\r\nconventions the railroad companies are always represented, and their\r\nrepresentatives do not hesitate to inform the delegates that this or\r\nthat candidate is not acceptable to their corporations and cannot\r\nreceive their support at the polls. During the Chicago convention of\r\n1888 the statement was openly made that two of the Western candidates\r\nlost Eastern support because they were not acceptable to a prominent New\r\nYork delegate who had come to Chicago in a threefold capacity--that of a\r\ndelegate, a presidential possibility, and special representative of one\r\nof the most powerful railroad interests in the country. This same man\r\nappeared again last year at the Minneapolis convention as chief\r\norganizer of the forces of a leading candidate. His counterpart was in\r\nattendance at the Chicago convention looking after the same interests\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt is the boast of prominent railroad men that their influence elected\r\nPresident Garfield, and the statement has been made upon good authority\r\nthat \"not until a few days before the election did the Garfield managers\r\nfeel secure,\" and that \"when the secret history of that campaign comes\r\nto be written it will be seen that Jay Gould had more influence upon the\r\nelection than Grant and Conkling.\" It cannot be said that railroad\r\nmanagers, as a class, have often openly supported a presidential\r\ncandidate. This may be due to the fact that with the uncertainty which\r\nhas for years attended national politics they deem it the part of\r\ndiscretion to pretend friendship for either party and then shout with\r\nthe victor. In conformity with this policy, a well-known New York\r\nrailroad millionaire has for years made large and secret contributions\r\nto the campaign funds of both political parties. He thereby places both\r\nparties under political obligations, and believes his interests safe,\r\nwhichever turn the political wheel may take. After the contest he is\r\nusually the first to congratulate the successful candidate. In the\r\nnational campaign of 1884 this railroad king completely outwitted a\r\nprominent Western politician and member of the Republican national\r\ncampaign committee who has always prided himself on his political\r\nsagacity. This gentleman had taken it upon himself to enlist the rich\r\nand powerful New Yorker in the Republican cause, and to obtain from him,\r\nas a token of his sincerity, a large contribution to the Blaine campaign\r\nfund. He succeeded, at least so far as the contribution was concerned;\r\nbut when the struggle was over and the opposition, in the exuberance of\r\njoy over their victory, told tales out of school, he was not a little\r\nchagrined to find that the managers of the Cleveland campaign had\r\nreceived from the astute railroad millionaire a campaign contribution\r\ntwice as large as that which he had obtained from him. The diatribes\r\nwhich for weeks after the election filled the columns of his paper\r\nreflected in every line the injured pride of the outwitted general.\r\n\r\nJudging from the laxity with which the railroad laws have been enforced\r\nin a considerable number of States, their executive departments are as\r\nmuch under the influence of railroad managers as are the legislative\r\ndepartments of others. This cannot be surprising to those who know how\r\noften governors of States are nominated and elected through railroad\r\ninfluences, and what efforts are made by corporations to humor servile\r\nand to propitiate independent executives. The time is not far remote\r\nwhen nearly every delegate to a State convention had free transportation\r\nfor the round trip. This transportation was furnished to delegates by\r\nrailroad managers through their local attorneys, or through favored\r\ncandidates and their confidants. It was only offered to those who were\r\nsupposed to be friendly to candidates approved by the railroad managers;\r\nand as free passage was looked upon as the legitimate perquisite of a\r\ndelegate, but few persons could be induced to attend a State convention\r\nand pay their fare. As a consequence, the railroad managers found it too\r\noften an easy matter to dictate the nomination of candidates.\r\n\r\nSince the adoption of the Interstate Commerce Law convention passes, as\r\nsuch, have largely disappeared; but many a prominent politician in going\r\nto and returning from political conventions travels as a railroad\r\nemploye, though the only service which he renders to the railroad\r\ncompanies consists in manipulating conventions in their favor. If all\r\nthe railroad candidates--and the companies usually take the precaution\r\nto support more than one candidate--are defeated in the convention of\r\none party, and a railroad candidate is nominated by the other party, the\r\nlatter is certain to receive at the polls every vote which railroad and\r\nallied corporate influence can command.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that an attempt would at least be made to hide from\r\nthe general public the interference of such a power with the politics of\r\na State; but railroad managers seem to rely for success as much upon\r\nintimidating political parties as upon gaining the good will of\r\nindividual citizens. To influence party action, the boast has in recent\r\nyears repeatedly and boldly been made in Iowa that 30,000 railroad\r\nemployes would vote as a unit against any party or individual daring to\r\nlegislate or otherwise take official action against their demands, and\r\nforgetting that, with the same means used in opposition to them, a few\r\nhundred thousand farmers and business men could be easily organized to\r\noppose them. Unscrupulous employers often endeavor to control the votes\r\nof their employes. This is particularly true of railroad companies, and\r\nthey use many ingenious plans to accomplish it. In the Northwest, and\r\nespecially in Iowa, they have for several years organized their employes\r\nas a political force for the purpose of defeating such candidates for\r\nState offices as were known to favor State control of the transportation\r\nbusiness. They have even paid the expenses of the organization, although\r\nthey have made every effort to make it appear as if the movement was a\r\nvoluntary one on the part of their employes. They are employing this\r\nmethod in Texas and other States at the present time, in opposition to\r\nthe effort that is being made by the people to secure just and\r\nreasonable treatment from the railroads.\r\n\r\nThat the chief executive of a State should be influenced in the\r\ndischarge of his official duties by such favors as passes, the freedom\r\nof the dining- and sleeping-car, by the free use of a special car, or\r\neven a special train, one is loath to believe; yet it is a fact, and\r\nespecially during political campaigns, that such favors are frequently\r\noffered to, and accepted by, the highest executive officers, and it is\r\nequally true that many of these officers often connive at the continued\r\nand defiant violations of law by railroad officials. While the men who\r\nmanage large railroad interests do not always possess that wisdom which\r\npopular reverence attributes to them, they certainly possess great\r\ncunning, and expend much of their artfulness in efforts to win over\r\nscrupulous, and to render still more servile unscrupulous executives.\r\nThe general railroad diplomate never omits to pay homage to the man in\r\npower, to flatter him, to impress him with the political influence of\r\nhis company, to intimate plainly that, as it has been in the past, so it\r\nwill be in the future its determined policy to reward its friends and to\r\npunish its enemies. If the executive proves intractable, if he can\r\nneither be flattered, nor coaxed, nor bribed into submission, he does\r\nnot hesitate to resort to intimidation to accomplish his purpose. This\r\nis by no means a rare occurrence. There are few public men who, if\r\ndetermined to do their duty, have not been subjected to railroad insult\r\nand intimidation. The author may be permitted to give an instance from\r\nhis personal experience. Soon after his inauguration as Governor of Iowa\r\na general officer of one of the oldest and strongest Western railroads\r\ncalled at his office and importuned him with unreasonable requests. When\r\nhe found that he had utterly failed to impress the author with his\r\narguments, he left abruptly, with the curt remark that these matters\r\ncould be settled on election day, and he emphasized his statement by\r\nslamming the door behind him.\r\n\r\nA servile railroad press has always been ready to misrepresent and\r\nmalign executive officers who have refused to acknowledge any higher\r\nauthority than the law, the expressed public will and their own\r\nconception of duty. This abuse has even been carried so far that the\r\neditorial columns of leading dailies have been prostituted by the\r\ninsertion of malicious tirades written by railroad managers and railroad\r\nattorneys; and the fact that public opinion has not been more seriously\r\ninfluenced by these venal sheets must be solely attributed to the good\r\njudgment and safe instinct of the masses of the people.\r\n\r\nHowever persistently railway organs deny it, it is a matter of general\r\nnotoriety that railway officials take an active part in political\r\ncampaigns. Hundreds of communications might be produced to show their\r\nwork in Iowa, but the following two letters, written by a prominent\r\nrailroad manager to an associate, will suffice for the purpose. It will\r\nbe noticed that one was written before and the other after election.\r\nComments upon their contents are unnecessary:\r\n\r\n      \"----, Iowa, Nov. 2nd, 1888.\r\n\r\n      \"DEAR SIR: I have just discovered this P. M. that the\r\n      Central Committee have sent electrotypes to all the\r\n      printing offices in the State of the State ticket, with\r\n      the names of the Railway Commissioners and Supreme Judge\r\n      in so small a space as to make it very difficult, if not\r\n      impossible, to write in the names. I am having slips made\r\n      with Commissioners' names and Judge written on them, and\r\n      they will be sent to all agents, not later than to-morrow,\r\n      to paste over the printed names on the ticket, and thus\r\n      beat this scheme. Have you seen any tickets yet? And what\r\n      do you think of this plan?\r\n\r\n      \"Yours truly, \"----\"\r\n\r\n      \"----, Iowa, Nov. 11, 1888.\r\n\r\n      \"DEAR SIR: Repeating the old and time-honored saying:\r\n      'We have met the enemy and we are theirs.' The Democratic\r\n      Granger and the largely increased Republican vote was too\r\n      much for us. Many friends voted with the railway men, but\r\n      to no purpose. The comparison between Granger and Smyth\r\n      will tell more than anything else the strength of the\r\n      railway vote. But we are badly used up, and may as well\r\n      take our dose.\r\n\r\n      \"Yours truly, \"----\"\r\n\r\nWhile the result of this election was indeed a bad dose for speculating\r\nrailway managers, it is the opinion of the masses and of railway\r\nstockholders, who are more interested in the general welfare of the\r\nroads than in speculation in their stocks, that the dose was well\r\nadministered, and should be repeated whenever the necessity for it may\r\nagain arise.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that railroad managers have lost much of their\r\nformer influence in politics. As their means of corruption have become\r\ngenerally known they have become less effective. The public is more on\r\nthe alert, and corrupt politicians often find themselves unable to carry\r\nout their discreditable compacts.\r\n\r\nBut it is unreasonable to expect the evil to cease until the cause is\r\nremoved. The trouble is inherent in the system, and the fault is there\r\nmore than in the men who manage the business, and not till the great\r\npower exercised by them is restrained within proper limits will the evil\r\ndisappear. All this can be accomplished when there shall be established\r\na most thorough and efficient system of State and National control over\r\nthe railroad business of the whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of the railroad manager has never been without time-servers.\r\nNot to speak of those newspaper editors who, for some consideration or\r\nanother, defend every policy and every practice inaugurated or approved\r\nby railroad authorities, there has always been a school of literati who\r\nfelt it their duty to enlighten, from a railroad standpoint, their\r\nfellow-men by book or pamphlet upon the transportation question, to\r\ncorrect what they supposed to be false impressions, and to round up with\r\nan apology or defense for the railroad manager, who is invariably\r\nrepresented by them as the most abused and at the same time most\r\npatriotic and most progressive man of the age.\r\n\r\nThe benefits derived from the railroad are great. It has been an\r\nimportant factor in the development of our country's resources and the\r\nadvancement of our civilization. Its value is fully appreciated, but\r\nthere is no reason why the men who have utilized the inventions of\r\nStephenson and others, and have grown rich by doing so, should be\r\neulogized any more than those who are ministering to the wants of the\r\npublic by the use of the Hoe printing press, McCormick's reaper,\r\nWhitney's cotton gin, or any of the thousands of other modern\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\nThese authors doubtless are prompted by various motives. Some have been\r\neducated in the railroad school and are therefore blind to railroad\r\nevils. Others naturally worship plutocrats, because they hold the\r\nopinion that capital is entitled to a larger reward than brains and\r\nmuscle, for the reason that the latter is more plentiful than the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nBut there is a third class of railroad authors, who, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, enter the literary arena in defense of railroad evils not\r\nsolely for the love they bear the cause, but as the paid advocates of a\r\nclass of men who feel that their cause is in need of a strong defense at\r\nthe bar of public sentiment. It would be difficult to account in any\r\nother way for the extravagant statements and one-sided arguments made by\r\nthis class of writers. Yet railroad literature has not confined itself\r\nto the retrospective field. Its scope has grown with the significance of\r\nits contributors. In more than one instance have men at the head of\r\nlarge railroad corporations, influenced by temporary interest, become\r\nthe authors of documents containing assertions and prophecies highly\r\npathetic at the time, but subsequently shown to be so replete with\r\nfalsehoods and absurdities that few railroad managers would to-day be\r\nwilling to father them. Thus Alexander Mitchell, the late president of\r\nthe Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, addressed on the\r\n28th of April, 1874, shortly after the passage of the Wisconsin Granger\r\nLaw, a letter to Governor Taylor, containing the following passages:\r\n\r\n      \"That it [the Wisconsin law] has effectually destroyed all\r\n      future railroad enterprises, no one who is acquainted with\r\n      its effect in money centers will for a moment doubt.... The\r\n      whole amount received on the investment [Chicago, Milwaukee\r\n      and St. Paul Railroad] for interest and cash and stock\r\n      dividends, amounts to only six per cent. per annum of the\r\n      actual cost of the property. I submit to your Excellency,\r\n      and through you to the people of the State, whether this is\r\n      more than a fair and reasonable return for the capital\r\n      invested in these improvements. Is it not far below such\r\n      reasonable amount? The best and most careful economists\r\n      admit that no less than ten per cent. per annum should be\r\n      allowed on such investments.... The directors of this\r\n      company have at all times had a due regard to the interests\r\n      of the public, and a desire to furnish transportation at the\r\n      lowest possible figures, and, although not receiving a fair\r\n      and reasonable return on their investments, they have for\r\n      the last four years prior to 1873 steadily reduced their\r\n      rates of freight and passengers from year to year, as will\r\n      be seen from the following tables, showing the charge for\r\n      freight per mile, and the average per mile for passengers\r\n      for each year, from 1868 to 1873 inclusive:\r\n\r\n           Charges per ton    Average passenger rate\r\n           per mile--cents.      per mile--cents.\r\n\r\n  1864                            .04\r\n  1868     .03      40-100        .03      86-100\r\n  1869     .03      10-100        .03      92-100\r\n  1870     .02      82-109        .03      85-100\r\n  1871     .02      54-100        .03      75-100\r\n  1872     .02      43-100        .03      54-100\r\n  1873     .02      50-100        .03      42-100\r\n\r\n      \"The law in question proposes to reduce our passenger rates\r\n      twenty-five per cent. and our freight rates about the same,\r\n      thus deducting from our present tariff about twenty-five per\r\n      cent. of our gross earnings.... This act, as we have seen,\r\n      proposes to take from us twenty-five per cent. of our\r\n      passenger and freight earnings, and the additional tax of\r\n      one per cent. of our gross earnings, all of which is\r\n      equivalent to taking from us twenty-six per cent. of our\r\n      gross earnings. Therefore, deducting this amount, equal to\r\n      twenty-six per cent. of our entire gross earnings, from\r\n      thirty-three per cent., our average net earnings on\r\n      business, would leave us only seven per cent. of our gross\r\n      earnings as the entire net earnings of the road, out of\r\n      which must be paid the interest on the bonds and the\r\n      dividends to our stockholders. It is therefore manifest that\r\n      this law will take from us over three-fourths of the net\r\n      income received under our present tariff.... The board of\r\n      directors have caused this act to be carefully examined and\r\n      considered by their own counsel, and by some of the most\r\n      eminent jurists in the land, and after such examination they\r\n      are unanimous in their opinion that it is unconstitutional\r\n      and void.... The board of directors are trustees of this\r\n      property, and are bound faithfully to discharge their trust,\r\n      and to the best of their ability to protect it from\r\n      spoliation and ruin. They have sought the advice of able\r\n      counsel, and, after mature consideration, believe it their\r\n      duty to disregard so much of said law as attempts\r\n      arbitrarily to fix rates of compensation for freight and\r\n      passengers.... Being fully conscious that the enforcement of\r\n      this law will ruin the property of the company, and feeling\r\n      assured of the correctness of the opinions of the eminent\r\n      counsel who have examined the question, the directors feel\r\n      compelled to disregard the provisions of the law so far as\r\n      it fixes a tariff of rates for the company, until the courts\r\n      have finally passed upon the question of its validity.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was at the time regarded by railroad men as a very strong\r\ndocument, and the railroad journals were filled with lengthy editorials\r\nin praise of the soundness of the doctrines and arguments which it\r\ncontained. The disinterested of the enlightened portion of the community\r\neven then realized that the \"eminent jurists\" whom the company had\r\nconsulted were hired attorneys and greatly biased in their views as to\r\nthe constitutional rights of corporations, and that President Mitchell\r\non his part had painted by far too dark a picture of the situation. It\r\nis now quite generally admitted that many of Mr. Mitchell's statements\r\nwere as false as his counsel's interpretation of the Constitution and\r\nthe law was erroneous. From the assertions made in this letter one is\r\nled to infer that the then stock-and bondholders of the Milwaukee road\r\nhad paid in full every dollar of the capitalized value of the road, and\r\nthat they derived from their investment an income of only about six per\r\ncent. on the money actually invested by them. The cost of the entire\r\nChicago and Milwaukee system in Wisconsin was stated in the letter as\r\nbeing $38,000 per mile. It is not likely that this line of road ever\r\ncost to exceed $25,000 a mile, or that those who then owned the road\r\npaid much more than two-thirds of its actual cost for it. The road, as\r\nthe letter itself admits, was bought at sheriff's sale, and no mercy\r\nwhatever was shown to the farmers who had mortgaged their farms to aid\r\nthe railroad company in raising funds for the construction of its line.\r\n\r\nThe letter contains other misstatements equally grave. Mr. A. B.\r\nStickney, the president of the Chicago, St. Paul and Kansas City\r\nRailroad, in his recent excellent work, \"The Railway Problem,\" reviews\r\nMr. Mitchell's letter as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Mitchell states the average rate per mile in 1873 for\r\n      passengers at 3.42 cents. It was well understood that this\r\n      was an average rate received from those passengers who paid\r\n      anything, and that, had the average rate been obtained by\r\n      using as a divisor the total number of paying passengers\r\n      plus the number of those who rode free the average would\r\n      have been much below three cents, the price fixed by the\r\n      law, and consequently, if the company would collect the\r\n      legal rate from all alike and abolish the free list, its\r\n      revenues from the passenger business would be increased\r\n      rather than decreased. If the same test is applied to the\r\n      freight rates it becomes equally evident that this statute\r\n      did not reduce the rates in Wisconsin below the average rate\r\n      of 2.50 cents per ton per mile, which, according to Mr.\r\n      Mitchell's statement, was the average for the year 1873. For\r\n      proof, it may be stated that the law classified freight into\r\n      four general classes, to be designated as first, second,\r\n      third and fourth classes, and into seven special classes, to\r\n      be designated as D, E, F, G, H, I and J. The rates on the\r\n      four general classes were made the same as were 'charged\r\n      for carrying freights in said four general classes on said\r\n      railroads on the first day of June, 1873,' and the rate per\r\n      ton per mile was fixed at certain rates for the first\r\n      twenty-five miles, a less for the second twenty-five miles,\r\n      and a fixed rate per mile after, as follows:\r\n\r\n             1st 25 Miles    2nd 25 Miles.   All Over 50 Miles.\r\n\r\n         D   4-4/5 cents      3-1/5 cents       1 3/5 cents.\r\n         E   Same as class above.\r\n         F   4     cents      2     cents       1     cent.\r\n         G   3-1/5 cents      2     cents       1     cent.\r\n         H   4     cents      2-4/5 cents       1-3/5 cents.\r\n         I   4-2/5 cents      2-2/5 cents       1-1/5 cents.\r\n         J   3-1/5 cents      2-2/5 cents       1     cent.\r\n\r\n      \"When it is considered, in connection with these figures,\r\n      that the four general classes were left by the legislature\r\n      under the same tariffs as had been enforced by the\r\n      companies, and, as a rule, first class is three times the\r\n      rate of class D, and third and fourth class materially\r\n      higher, the evidence seems conclusive that the rates fixed\r\n      by law would produce an average materially higher than the\r\n      average of the whole year, stated by Mr. Mitchell at 2-1/2\r\n      cents. It seems also probable that, had the rates fixed by\r\n      this law been applied to the whole business of the line, the\r\n      interstate as well as the State traffic, it would still have\r\n      produced a larger average. The latter of course is the\r\n      proper test. There are little inaccuracies in the material\r\n      facts as stated by Mr. Mitchell which were pointed out at\r\n      once. For example: In his tabulated statement of passenger\r\n      earnings per mile, averaging the gross earnings from\r\n      transportation of passengers who paid any fare, and omitting\r\n      the large number who went free, the rate is stated at 3\r\n      42-100 cents per mile; then he says: 'The law in question\r\n      proposes to reduce our passenger rate twenty-five per\r\n      cent.,' which would have reduced the rate to 2.57 cents per\r\n      mile, while, the rate fixed by the law complained of was\r\n      three cents per mile. Then Mr. Mitchell proceeds: 'And our\r\n      freight rates about the same; thus deducting from our\r\n      present tariff about twenty-five per cent. of our gross\r\n      earnings.' It was immediately pointed out that the law only\r\n      applied to strictly State business; that is, to traffic\r\n      that originated and ended in the State of Wisconsin. All\r\n      other traffic was interstate commerce, and could not be\r\n      controlled by State legislation. The volume of business\r\n      which would be affected by the law would therefore be\r\n      comparatively small--estimated at not over ten per cent., of\r\n      the total traffic of the line. Hence, if the rates fixed by\r\n      the law were twenty-five per cent. less than the rates the\r\n      company had been in the habit of collecting (which was\r\n      denied), it could not possibly have 'deducted from its\r\n      present tariff' more than two and one-half per cent.,\r\n      instead of twenty-five per cent. as stated by Mr. Mitchell.\r\n\r\n      \"It was claimed that the facts were, that the Chicago,\r\n      Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, in its efforts to bankrupt\r\n      the Lake Superior and Mississippi Company, had many of its\r\n      interstate rates so low that it had resulted in loss, and\r\n      that its other rates had been made unreasonably high in\r\n      order to recoup this loss, and that the State of Wisconsin\r\n      was compelled to pay a part of the expense of the\r\n      transportation of favored sections of the State of\r\n      Minnesota.\"\r\n\r\nAll through the Granger contests the railways have weakened the force of\r\ntheir arguments by their misrepresentation of facts and by their\r\nextravagant predictions of ruin. The companies were continually\r\nproclaiming: 'If this or that is done, it will ruin us; it will ruin the\r\nState,' when, in fact, a road cannot be mentioned that has suffered from\r\nState legislation. Nineteen years ago no railroad manager could have\r\nwritten what Mr. Stickney writes to-day, and few railroad managers would\r\nwrite to-day what Mr. Mitchell wrote then. And yet, such is the change\r\nwhich public sentiment is undergoing upon these questions, that the\r\nutterances of many of our present railroad authors will appear as absurd\r\na few years hence as Mr. Mitchell's letter of nineteen years ago appears\r\nto us now.\r\n\r\nMany railroad attorneys have since been guilty of resorting to the\r\nsophistry employed by President Mitchell in that strange letter which he\r\naddressed to the Governor of Wisconsin. Even so distinguished a\r\ngentleman as Hon. James W. McDill, now a member of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, made in 1888, as a member of a railroad lobby, the\r\nfollowing remarkable statements before the Railroad Committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Iowa, in a speech opposing a proposed reduction of\r\nthe passenger rate of first-class roads from three to two cents per\r\nmile:\r\n\r\n      \"The proposition, if confined to the first-class roads of\r\n      Iowa, proposes a one-third reduction of their revenues from\r\n      passenger business.... We have earned in Iowa by first-class\r\n      roads annually about $13,000,000, and a reduction of one\r\n      cent, or from a rate of three cents to two, will reduce\r\n      their revenues about $5,000,000 a year.... Thus it is seen\r\n      that it is proposed to take from the revenues of a part of\r\n      the railroads of Iowa, annually, almost as much as all the\r\n      railroads of Iowa have paid for taxes in nine years\r\n      ($6,549,505.84).\"\r\n\r\nMr. McDill was a member of the Iowa Railroad Commission for several\r\nyears. He may, therefore, be presumed to have known that the State of\r\nIowa could not, and did not propose to, regulate interstate traffic, and\r\nthat the thirteen million dollars railroad revenue to which he referred\r\nwas derived both from interstate and State traffic; that the latter was\r\nonly about one-fourth of the former, and that therefore the proposed\r\nreduction on the basis of schedule rates would have cut down the net\r\nrevenue of the roads only about one million instead of five million\r\ndollars. But Mr. McDill himself states that the average rate earned by\r\nall the railroads of the United States was, for the year 1886, only\r\n2.181 cents per passenger per mile. It certainly was not over 2-1/2\r\ncents per mile for the first-class roads of Iowa. Thus the proposed\r\nreduction, instead of being one cent per mile, as stated by Mr. McDill,\r\nwas only one-half cent per mile; and it only applied to the local\r\nbusiness of the first-class roads. In other words, the bill under\r\nconsideration, had it been enacted into law, would have caused a\r\nreduction of 20 per cent. on about 25 per cent. of the total revenue\r\nfrom passenger business of the first-class roads, or of five per cent.\r\non their total income from passenger traffic in the State of Iowa. It\r\nwill be noticed that Mr. McDill in his calculation made no allowance\r\nwhatever for the increase of business which would have followed such a\r\nreduction. The gain from this source would probably have greatly\r\nexceeded the loss due to this small reduction in the fare. In the same\r\naddress Mr. McDill made many other equally fallacious statements.\r\n\r\nOne of the most devoted advocates of the interests of railroad managers\r\nis Marshall M. Kirkman. He is the author of a number of books and\r\npamphlets upon railway subjects, among them a pamphlet entitled \"The\r\nRelation of the Railroads of the United States to the People and the\r\nCommercial and Financial Interests of the Country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kirkman introduces his subject with the following rather remarkable\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n      \"I shall show that while the railways of the United States\r\n      are designated as monopolies, they are not so in fact.\r\n      Accused of disregarding the interests of the community, I\r\n      will show that they are abnormally sensitive to their\r\n      obligations in this direction. While legislatures claim the\r\n      right to fix rates, I shall show that the abnormal\r\n      conditions under which the railway system has grown up and\r\n      its chaotic nature render the exercise of such a privilege\r\n      impossible. I will show that while it is assumed that rates\r\n      may be fixed arbitrarily, they must, on the contrary, be\r\n      based on natural causes, the competition of carriers, their\r\n      necessities and the rivalries of conflicting markets and\r\n      trade centers; conditions manifestly impossible to determine\r\n      or regulate in advance, and therefore beyond the control of\r\n      legislation.... While a division of business (by pooling) is\r\n      thought to be contrary to the interests of the people, I\r\n      shall show that it is the legitimate fruit of indiscriminate\r\n      railway building and offers the only escape from the\r\n      conditions such practice engenders. I shall show that, while\r\n      it is assumed that rates may be based progressively or\r\n      otherwise on distance, the enforcement of such a principle\r\n      would restrict the source of supply, and, in so far as this\r\n      was the case, render great markets or centers of industry\r\n      impossible.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the importance of the railroad, Mr. Kirkman says:\r\n\"Superseding every other form of inland conveyance, it determines the\r\nlocation of business centers, and vitalizes by its presence, or blasts\r\nby its absence.\" He contends that rigid and scrutinizing supervision\r\nshould be exercised by the Government over the location of railroads,\r\nand that only such lines should be permitted to be built as afford\r\nreasonable grounds for profitable enterprise. \"It should be,\" he says,\r\n\"an axiom in our day that a government that permits or encourages the\r\nconstruction of two railways where one would suffice is, to the extent\r\nthat it does this, a public nuisance.\" Mr. Kirkman here makes it the\r\nduty of the Government to arbitrarily meddle with railroad affairs. He\r\nwould give the Government the power to determine when and where an\r\nadditional railroad is needed, and to prohibit the construction of any\r\nnew road that has not the Government sanction. The interests of a\r\nthousand towns might suffer for want of adequate transportation\r\nfacilities, individuals and communities might be anxious to build their\r\nown lines for the development of local resources, but all railroad\r\nenterprise is doomed to a standstill until a conservative governmental\r\ncommission has been entirely satisfied that a prospected road will pay\r\nand not deprive existing roads of any part of their revenue. There can\r\nbe no doubt that if such a policy were ever adopted in America, few\r\nroads would be built without having first passed the ordeal of a legal\r\ninjunction, and many a prospected road, though greatly needed, would\r\nremain unbuilt because its promoters would be discouraged by the delay\r\nand cost of litigation.\r\n\r\nBut while this author is perfectly willing to trust the Government with\r\nthe great responsibility of prohibiting the construction of proposed\r\nroads, he is not willing to have it exercise the power to determine what\r\nare reasonable rates. He tries to sustain his objection by the following\r\nargument: \"The fixing of rates upon a railroad is as delicate a process\r\nas that of determining the pulse of a sick man. They cannot be\r\ndetermined abstractly, or in advance of the wants of business, but must\r\nbe adjusted from hour to hour to conform to its fluctuations. Five\r\nthousand men find active employment in the United States in connection\r\nwith the important duty of making rates. Each case requires particular\r\ninvestigation and involves, in many instances, prolonged study and\r\nresearch. The duty requires men of marked experience and capacity. They\r\nand men like them are the silent, unseen power that moves great\r\nenterprises of every nation. In the case of railroads we may enumerate\r\nthose having official positions, but the experts from whom the official\r\nheads derive information and assistance cannot be classified. They\r\ncomprise a vast army of experienced and able men familiar with railway\r\ntraffic and quick to respond to its requirements. Such a body of men\r\ncould not be organized by a government, or, if organized, would rapidly\r\ndeteriorate under conditions so unfavorable for their support and\r\ndevelopment. Whatever authority exercises the duty of fixing rates must\r\ntake up the subject in the same methodical way and, acting through\r\nskilled agents, pursue its inquiries and determine its results with the\r\nsame experience, minute care and _conscientious regard_ for the\r\ntechnical requirements of business that the railway companies observe.\r\nNo government can possess the facilities for perfecting so vast and\r\nintricate an organization and at the same time render it responsive to\r\nthe public good. The labor is too great and the responsibility too\r\nremote. It could not move with sufficient quickness to respond to the\r\nactual requirements of trade, and too many restrictions would\r\nnecessarily govern its actions. For these and other equally important\r\nreasons governments must always be satisfied to restrict their offices\r\nin this direction.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the men who are commonly termed railroad magnates, Mr.\r\nKirkman says: \"They alone possess the needed administrative ability that\r\nthe situation demands. They not only provide largely the capital, but\r\nthey discover the fields wherein it may be used most advantageously.\r\nThey are the advance guard of all great enterprises, the natural leaders\r\nof men. They are an integral part of the country, a necessary and\r\nvaluable element, without which its natural resources would avail\r\nlittle.\" This is a very strong statement in the face of the fact that\r\nbut very few of the class of men to whom Mr. Kirkman refers ever built a\r\nline of road. They have usually found it more profitable to \"gobble\"\r\nroads already built than to construct new lines.\r\n\r\nAccording to this author the public have no reason to complain of\r\nrailroads; on the contrary, the latter have always been the victims of\r\npublic persecution, and \"every species of folly, every conceivable\r\ndevice of malice, the impossible requirements of ignorance, the selfish\r\ncunning of personal interests, the ravings of demagogues, the\r\ndisappointments, envies, prejudices and jealousies of mankind have each\r\nin turn and in unison sought to injure the railway interest.\"\r\n\r\nBut probably the most extravagant passage in the whole treatise is the\r\none referring to special rates, which he calls \"the foundation and\r\nbuttress of business,\" without which it could not be carried on. He\r\nexpresses the opinion that without the continued and intelligent use of\r\nsuch rates \"our cities would soon be as destitute of manufactories as\r\none of the bridle paths of Afghanistan,\" and then continues: \"The\r\nspecial rate of carriers is like the delicate fluid that anoints and\r\nlubricates the joints of the human body. It is an essential oil. Without\r\nit the wheels of commerce would cease and we should quickly revert to\r\nthe period when the stage-coach and the overland teamster fixed the\r\nlimits of commerce and the stature of cities.\"\r\n\r\nThe most recent and probably the most radical of Mr. Kirkman's books is\r\n\"Railway Rates and Government Control.\" It would lead us too far from\r\nour subject to enter into a discussion of Mr. Kirkman's errors; in fact,\r\nit might prove an endless task. Suffice it to say that in discussing his\r\nsubject he revels in such phrases as: \"Subject too vast to be\r\ncomprehended.\" \"Acts of agrarian legislation and foolish manifestations\r\nof disappointment and hate.\" \"The rabble will avail itself of every\r\nexcuse to pass laws that would, under other circumstances, be called\r\nrobberies.\" \"Ignorance and demagogism.\" \"Government interference, the\r\npanacea of cranks and schemers.\" \"Only understood by the few.\" \"These\r\npeople are as sincere as they are ignorant.\" \"Governments have no\r\ncommercial sense.\" \"Those who condemn them are not so dishonest as\r\nignorant, and not so malicious as foolish.\" \"Silly people.\" \"Justice and\r\ncommon honesty are systematically denied [the railroads].\" \"Legal means\r\nof plundering them.\" \"The intelligence and facilities of Government are\r\nbut one step above the barbarian.\" \"Those who use railroads should pay\r\nfor them,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Kirkman's argument is in substance: Rate-making is a difficult\r\nsubject. The people are too ignorant to understand it. Those who carry\r\non the Government are for the most part fools and demagogues, and are\r\nutterly unfit to do justice to such a task. Railroad men are wise and\r\njust, and neither the people nor the Government should meddle with the\r\nrailroad business. In order to place a true estimate upon Mr. Kirkman's\r\nutterances, one should remember that he is a railroad employe as well as\r\nthe patentee and vendor of a number of railroad account forms which are\r\nextensively used by railroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago _Tribune_, in reviewing this last literary production of Mr.\r\nKirkman, says:\r\n\r\n      \"The great fault of Mr. Kirkman's statements is that they\r\n      are often so general in character as to be both true and\r\n      false at the same time.... He does not seem to comprehend\r\n      the nature of the railroad, or to perceive the danger of\r\n      allowing a railroad to exercise its powers uncontrolled. He\r\n      denies the State's right to interfere with any\r\n      discriminations which a railway corporation chooses to\r\n      adopt. He would allow railways to fix whatever charges they\r\n      please for long hauls and short hauls.... Mr. Kirkman does\r\n      not adduce a single fact in support of these remarkable\r\n      views. He simply says: 'Railroads cannot, if they would,\r\n      maintain any inequitable local tariff.' This is not\r\n      argument, it is simply assertion. Every one who has learned\r\n      the alphabet of this question knows that railways have been\r\n      exceedingly unjust wherever competition or the law did not\r\n      restrict their powers. If this were the proper place for it\r\n      we would give the author instances of this injustice by the\r\n      hundred, and almost any book on the subject refers to such\r\n      cases by the thousand.... When confronted with the facts\r\n      substantiating such charges the author answers the argument\r\n      by exclaiming: 'But how absurd! But how untrue! Our\r\n      commercial morals are equal to the highest in the world....'\r\n      Scarcely an assertion can be taken without qualification.\r\n      The author fairly revels in half-truths.... The book may\r\n      have its merits, but they are too modest to reveal\r\n      themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a failing of mankind to take for truth without further\r\ninvestigation any assertion that has often been reiterated. Most people\r\nare prone to believe that an assertion made by a thousand hearsay\r\nwitnesses is true, overlooking the possibility of their drawing from a\r\ncommon false source. But it is surprising that an author like Prof.\r\nArthur T. Hadley should fall into such an error. In his otherwise\r\nexcellent work, \"Railroad Transportation, Its History and Its Laws,\" Mr.\r\nHadley bases a number of his deductions upon false premises advanced by\r\nrailroad managers, and arrives at conclusions which appear strange when\r\ntheir source is considered. In the chapter on railroad legislation\r\nProfessor Hadley says: \"But a more powerful force than the authority of\r\nthe courts was working against the Granger system of regulation. The\r\nlaws of trade could not be violated with impunity. The effects were most\r\nsharply felt in Wisconsin. The law reducing railroad rates to the basis\r\nwhich competitive points enjoyed left nothing to pay fixed charges. In\r\nthe second year of its operation, no Wisconsin road paid a dividend;\r\nonly four paid interest on their bonds. Railroad construction had come\r\nto a standstill. Even the facilities of existing roads could not be kept\r\nup. Foreign capital refused to invest in Wisconsin; the development of\r\nthe State was sharply checked; the very men who had most favored the law\r\nfound themselves heavy losers.... By the time the Supreme Court\r\npublished the Granger decisions, the fight had been settled, not by\r\nconstitutional limitations, but by industrial ones.\"\r\n\r\nThese statements are either utterly untrue or greatly misleading. Mr.\r\nHadley ought to know that the railroad companies in the Granger States\r\nnever complied with the letter, much less with the spirit of the law.\r\nWhenever they made an apparent effort to live up to it they only did so\r\nto make it odious. Rates were never reduced by the legislature to the\r\nbasis previously enjoyed by competitive points, but merely to the\r\naverage charge which had obtained before the passage of the law. As a\r\nrule the railroad revenues increased. If any companies failed to earn\r\nenough to pay fixed charges it was simply because they were determined\r\nnot to do so. A non-payment of dividends did not injure the managers,\r\nbut simply other stockholders of the road. A permanent establishment of\r\nthe principle of non-discrimination, on the other hand, would have\r\nbenefited stockholders, while prejudicing the speculative interest which\r\nmanagers had in the roads. Railroad construction came, after the\r\nfinancial panic of 1873, to a practical standstill throughout the United\r\nStates; and if the Granger States did not get their share of the very\r\nsmall total increase during the five years following the panic, it was\r\ndue solely to a conspiracy on the part of the railroad managers to\r\nmisrepresent and pervert the legislation of these States. The laws, as\r\nhas already been stated, were finally repealed, not because the people\r\nhad tired of them or regarded them unwise or unjust, but because it was\r\nhoped that the commissioner system would prove more efficient. It was\r\noffered as a compromise measure and was accepted as such by the railroad\r\nmanagers, who, in their eagerness to rid themselves of the restrictions\r\nimposed by the Granger laws, gave every assurance of complete submission\r\nto the requirements of the proposed legislation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley even goes so far as to defend railroad pools. \"Unluckily,\" he\r\nsays, \"we place these combinations outside of the protection of the law,\r\nand by giving them this precarious and almost illegal character we tempt\r\nthem to seek present gain, even at the sacrifice of their own future\r\ninterests. We regard them, and we let them regard themselves, as a means\r\nof momentary profit and speculation, instead of recognizing them as\r\nresponsible public agencies of lasting influence and importance.\" We can\r\npartially account for this author's defense of pooling when we are\r\ninformed that he accepts it as an axiom that \"combination does not\r\nproduce arbitrary results any more than competition produces beneficent\r\nones.\" Referring to railroad profits, Mr. Hadley says: \"The statement\r\nthat corporations make too much money is scarcely borne out by the\r\nfacts. The average return of the railroads of this country is only four\r\nper cent., the bondholders receiving an average of four and a half per\r\ncent., the stockholders of two and a half per cent. True, much of the\r\nstock is water, not representing any capital actually expended; but,\r\neven making allowance for this, it is hardly probable that the roads are\r\nearning more than five per cent. on the total investment. This assumes\r\nan average cost of $45,000 per mile, implying that about half of the\r\nstock and one-sixth of the bonds are water.\" Mr. Hadley would probably\r\nhave come much nearer the truth if he had assumed three-fourths of the\r\nstock and one-fourth of the bonds to be water. Even Mr. Poor, who\r\ncertainly cannot be accused by railroad men of being inimical to their\r\ninterests, places the average cost of the railroads of this country no\r\nhigher than at $30,000 per mile; and this estimate, it should be\r\nremembered, includes the value of the large donations made to railroad\r\ncompanies by the public. With a full understanding of all the\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Poor said of railroad investments several years ago\r\nthat if the water were taken out of them no class of investments in this\r\ncountry would pay as well. In the face of this statement Mr. Hadley\r\nwould do well to revise his figures.\r\n\r\nWe find, however, in Prof. Hadley's book also eminently sound views,\r\nlike the following: \"If the object of a railroad manager is simply to\r\npay as large a dividend as possible for the current year, he can best do\r\nit by squeezing his local tariff, of which he is sure, and securing\r\nthrough traffic at the expense of other roads by specially low rates;\r\nthat is, by a policy of heavy discrimination. But the permanent effect\r\nof such a policy is to destroy the local trade, which gives a road its\r\nbest and surest custom, and to build up a trade which can go by another\r\nroute whenever it pleases. The permanent effect of such a policy is\r\nruinous to the railroad as well as the local shipper.\" And he continues:\r\n\"By securing publicity of management you do much to prevent the\r\npermanent interests of the railroads from being sacrificed to temporary\r\nones. By protecting the permanent interests of the public you enlist the\r\nstockholders and the best class of railroad managers on the side of\r\nsound policy.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Atkinson, in an essay entitled \"The Railway, the Farmer and the\r\nPublic,\" endeavors to prove that the farmers have no cause for\r\ncomplaining against the railroad, because rates of transportation have\r\nbeen greatly reduced during the past twenty years. Speaking of the\r\nreductions made in freight rates in the State of New York, he says: \"Had\r\nthe rate of 1870 been charged on the tariff of 1883 the sum would have\r\nbeen at 1.7016 cents on 9,286,216,628 tons, carried one mile,\r\n$158,014,262; the actual charge was $83,464,919, making a difference of\r\n$74,549,343 saved on one year's traffic on the lines reported in New\r\nYork.\" It either did not occur to Mr. Atkinson, or, if it did occur to\r\nhim, he failed to mention it, that these freight reductions were forced\r\nupon the railroads chiefly by water competition, and that if the\r\nrailroad companies had not saved these seventy-four million dollars for\r\nthe people, the canal lines, always subject to competition, would have\r\nsaved a large part of it. With equal propriety might it be said that the\r\nrailroads, by meeting canal competition, saved for themselves in the\r\nyear mentioned a goodly share of their gross earnings. Such reasoning is\r\nabsurd, and it is high time that the bubble of an argument so often used\r\nby railroad advocates be pricked. As Mr. Atkinson has introduced the\r\nfarmer, let us apply his rule to him. There was a time when the farmer\r\nsold his corn for a dollar a bushel. To-day he sells it for thirty\r\ncents. He therefore saves to the people of this country, on\r\n2,000,000,000 bushels, the enormous sum of $1,400,000,000. There is\r\nscarcely an industry in existence to which this argument does not apply\r\nwith equal force. Mr. Atkinson virtually admits that railroads charge\r\nall the traffic will bear when he says: \"The charge which can be put\r\nupon the wheat of Dakota or Iowa for moving it to market is fixed by the\r\nprice at which East Indian wheat can be sold in Market Lane.\" He is\r\nopposed to the Interstate Commerce Law, which he regards as \"obnoxious\r\nmeasures of national interference and futile attempts to control this\r\ngreat work.\" He would rely chiefly upon the publicity of accounts made\r\nby railway officers, as secured by the private publication of Poor's\r\nRailway Manual, for all needed regulation, but concedes the\r\nestablishment of a figurehead commission, concluding his remarks upon\r\nthe subject as follows: \"A commission which may bring public opinion to\r\nbear upon railway corporations may well be established, and there the\r\nwork of the legislator may well cease.\" When we consider the powerful\r\nagencies employed by railroads to create public sentiment in their favor\r\nwe can well understand the inefficiency of such a milk-and-water method\r\nof control.\r\n\r\nOne of the most radical books ever published at the instigation of\r\nrailroad managers appeared in 1888, under the title \"The People and the\r\nRailways.\" Its author is Appleton Morgan, who attempts to \"allay the\r\nanimosity towards the railway interests\" as shown in Mr. James F.\r\nHudson's book, \"The Railways and the Republic.\" The means which Mr.\r\nMorgan chooses are not well calculated to accomplish his purpose, for\r\nthe masses of the people prefer in such a controversy arguments to\r\nridicule and sarcasm, weapons of literary warfare to which this author\r\nresorts altogether too freely. Mr. Morgan's opinion as to the benefits\r\nof centralized wealth and trade combinations differs greatly from that\r\nheld by the great majority of the American people. He says: \"The fact,\r\nthe truth is, that (however it may be in other countries) the\r\naccumulation of wealth and centralization of commerce in great\r\ncombinations has never, in the United States, been a source of\r\noppression or of poverty to the non-capitalist or wage-worker.\" There is\r\nscarcely an evil in railroad management which Mr. Morgan does not\r\ndefend. Pools, construction companies, rebates, discriminations and\r\nover-capitalization all find favor in Mr. Morgan's eye. \"Rebates and\r\ndiscriminations,\" he says, \"are neither peculiar to railways nor\r\ndangerous to the 'Republic.' They are as necessary and as harmless to\r\nthe farmer as is the chromo which the seamstress or the shop girl gets\r\nwith her quarter-pound of tea from the small tea merchant, and no more\r\ndangerous to the latter than are the aforesaid chromos to the small\r\nrecipients.\" Pools and combinations receive an unusually large share of\r\nMr. Morgan's attention. A few selections from his effusions in their\r\nfavor may be given here, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"These pools are the legitimate and necessary results of the\r\nrechartering over and over again of railway companies to transact\r\nbusiness between the same points by paralleling each other. So long as\r\nthe people in their legislatures will thus charter parallel lines\r\nserving identical points--thus dividing territory they once granted\r\nentire--it is not exactly clear how they can complain if the lines built\r\n(by money invested, if not on the good faith of the people, at least in\r\nreliance upon an undivided business) combine to save themselves from\r\nbankruptcy.\" And again: \"Against the inequality of their own rates and\r\nthe hardship of the long and short haul (in other words, against the\r\ndiscrimination of nature and of physical laws) no less than against the\r\nperil of bankruptcy and the consequent speculative tendency of their\r\nstocks (after which may come the wrecking, the watering, and the vast\r\nindividual fortunes), the railways of this republic have endeavored, by\r\nestablishment of pool commissions, to defend both the public and\r\nthemselves.... The honest administration of railways for all interests,\r\nthe payment of their fixed charges, the solvency of their securities,\r\nthe faithful and valuable performance of their duties as carriers, can\r\nbe conserved in but one way--by living tariffs, such as the pools once\r\nguaranteed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following passage this author denies to the State the right to\r\nregulate rates: \"Granting that they [the railroads] must carry freights\r\nfor the public in such a way as not to injure either the public or the\r\nfreight in the carrying, most emphatically (it seems to me) it does not\r\nfollow that they must add to the value of the freights they carry by\r\ncharging only such rates as the public or the owners of the freight\r\ninsist on.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Morgan's indignation rises to the highest pitch in his\r\ndiscussion of the Interstate Commerce Act. He fears that it will cause\r\nthe downfall of our liberties and sees in the background the Venetian\r\nBridge of Sighs and the French Bastille. He asks: \"Why should for any\r\npublic reasons--for any reason of public safety--the Interstate Commerce\r\nLaw have come to stay?\" He then berates the act as follows: \"To begin\r\nwith, the present act abounds in punishments for and prohibitions\r\nagainst an industry chartered by the people, but nowhere extends to that\r\nindustry a morsel of approval or protection. It bristles with penalties,\r\nlegal, equitable, penal, and as for contempt, against railway companies,\r\nbut nowhere alludes to any possible case in which a railway company\r\nmight, by accident, be in the right, and the patron, customer, passenger\r\nor shipper in the wrong.... The constitutions of civilized nations, for\r\nthe last few centuries at least, have provided that not even guilt\r\nshould be punished except by due process of law, and have uniformly\r\nrefused to set even that due process in motion except upon a complaint\r\nof grievance. But the Interstate Commerce Law denies the one and does\r\naway with the necessity for the other. That statute provides that the\r\ncommission it creates shall proceed 'in such manner and by such means as\r\nit shall deem proper,' or 'on its own motion,' and that 'no complaint\r\nshall at any time be dismissed because of the absence of direct damage\r\nto the complainant.' Even the Venetian council often provided for a\r\ncertain and described hole in the wall through which the anonymous\r\nbringers of charges should thrust their accusations. Even the court of\r\nstar chamber was known to dismiss inquisitions when it found that no\r\nwrong had been done. But the statute of interstate commerce appears to\r\nissue _lettres de cachet_ against anything in the shape of a railway\r\ncompany--to scatter them broadcast, and to invite any one who happens to\r\nhave leisure to fill them out, by inserting the name of a railway\r\ncompany. It says to the bystander: 'Drop us a postal card, or mention to\r\nany of our commissioners, or to a mutual friend, the name of any railway\r\ncompany of which you may have heard, and so give us jurisdiction to\r\ninquire if that company may have by chance omitted to dot an i or cross\r\na t in its ledgers, or whether any one of its hundreds of thousands of\r\nagents--in the rush of a day's business, or in a shipper's hurry to\r\ncatch a train--may have named a rate not on the schedule then being\r\nprepared at headquarters, or charged a sixpence less than some other\r\nagent 250 miles down the line may have accepted a week ago for what\r\nmight turn out to be a fraction more mileage service in the same general\r\ndirection. No particular form is necessary. Drop in to luncheon with our\r\ncommission any day between twelve and one, and mention the name of a\r\nrailway company. The railway company may have done you no damage, nor\r\ngrieved you in any way; just mention the railroad, and we will take\r\njurisdiction of its private (or quasi-public) affairs. Or, if you don't\r\nhappen to have time to mention it, we will take jurisdiction anyhow, 'of\r\nour own motion,' of any railway company whose name we find in the\r\nOfficial Gazette. It really does not matter which; any one will do.\"\r\nThis is a fair example of the literature on the Interstate Commerce Law\r\npaid for by railroad men.\r\n\r\nMr. Stickney, although a railroad president, takes an entirely different\r\nview of the situation. He considers the law inadequate to bring about\r\nthe reforms needed. He says: \"This enormous business is now in the\r\ncontrol of several hundred petty chieftains, who are practically\r\nindependent sovereigns, exercising functions and prerogatives in\r\ndefiance of the laws, and practically denying their amenability to the\r\nlaws of the country. If the Government would seek to bring them to terms\r\nand compel them to recognize and obey the laws, it must use the means\r\nnecessary to accomplish the end. It must have executive officers\r\nsufficient in number as well as armed with an adequate power and dignity\r\nto command their respect.... The power conferred upon them [the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission] to enforce their judicial orders is the\r\npower 'to scold.' The penalties of the law which the courts are in power\r\nto impose are certainly severe, but the law has been operated for about\r\nfour years without any convictions, and yet no well-informed person is\r\nignorant of the fact that the law has not been obeyed. The president of\r\na large system is said to have remarked that 'if all who had offended\r\nagainst the law were convicted there would not be jails enough in the\r\nUnited States to hold them.' It is evident that the Government has not\r\nprovided adequate machinery for enforcing the law.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stickney is correct in his statement that adequate machinery for\r\nenforcement of the law has not been provided, but he does not give\r\nsufficient credit to the law or the commission. While much work remains\r\nto be done, much progress has been made.\r\n\r\nHe is of the opinion that the public welfare would be furthered if the\r\nNational Government assumed the sole control of railroads. He gives his\r\nreasons for the change which he proposes, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"There are many reasons besides these in the interest of\r\n      uniformity which make it desirable to transfer the entire\r\n      control of this important matter to the regulation of the\r\n      Nation. First, because of its constitution and more extended\r\n      sessions, Congress is able to consider the subject with\r\n      greater deliberation, and therefore with more intelligence,\r\n      than can a legislature composed of members who, as a rule,\r\n      hold their office for but one short session of about sixty\r\n      days' duration. There would also be removed from local\r\n      legislation a fruitful source of corruption, which is\r\n      gradually sapping the foundations of public morality.... In\r\n      the second place, the problem of regulating railway tolls\r\n      and managing railways is essentially and practically\r\n      indivisible, by State lines or otherwise, and therefore it\r\n      is not clear but that whenever the question may come before\r\n      the courts it may be held that the authority of Congress to\r\n      deal with interstate traffic carries with it, as a necessary\r\n      and inseparable part of the subject, to regulate the traffic\r\n      which is now assumed to be controlled by the several States.\r\n      The courts have held that the States have authority to\r\n      regulate strictly State traffic in the absence of\r\n      Congressional action, but their decisions do not preclude\r\n      the doctrine that Congress may have exclusive jurisdiction\r\n      whenever it may choose to exercise the authority. There is a\r\n      line of reasoning which would lead to that conclusion. It\r\n      may be that many will not care to follow the lead of the\r\n      writer as to the measure of aggregate net revenue which\r\n      railway companies are entitled to collect in tolls, but it\r\n      is evident that before the tolls can be intelligently\r\n      determined some measure of such aggregate revenue must be\r\n      ascertained. The question would then arise, what proportion\r\n      must be levied upon State and interstate traffic\r\n      respectively? If the State should refuse to levy its share\r\n      (and how could such share be ascertained?), then more than\r\n      its share would have to be levied on interstate traffic, and\r\n      thus the State by indirection would be able to do what the\r\n      Constitution prohibits. Of course, when the Constitution was\r\n      adopted railways and railway traffic were unknown. But it\r\n      was a similar question which brought the thirteen original\r\n      States together into one nation, under the present\r\n      Constitution. At least the first movement toward amending\r\n      the original Articles of Confederation was to give Congress\r\n      enlarged power over the subject of commerce.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this it may be said that it will be an unfortunate day for\r\nthe States when they surrender the power to control their home affairs.\r\nDifferences between State and interstate rates could easily be adjusted\r\nby the National and State commissions and by the courts. It certainly\r\nought not to be difficult for such tribunals to see that a rate which is\r\nmade higher or lower, as it may be for State or interstate traffic, is\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nMr. Stickney has fallen into the error common to railroad men in\r\nbelieving that lower rates of transportation will not prevail in the\r\nfuture. There are many reasons why it is probable that they will be\r\nlower. Present rates are highly profitable on well located lines.\r\nLabor-saving inventions will increase, and roads will be built and\r\noperated more cheaply. Lines will be located with lower grades, lighter\r\ncurvature and more directness. Business will increase largely, and the\r\nratio of expenses will decrease. Steel will be improved in quality and\r\nwill be substituted for iron. A heavier rail and more permanent roadway\r\nwill be used. Rates of interest will rule lower, and there will be much\r\nmore economy in superintending. Extravagant salaries to favorites will\r\nbe reduced, and sinecures and parasites will be cut off from the\r\npayrolls. Lower wages are inevitable as our population becomes more\r\ndense.\r\n\r\nA very interesting and instructive author upon railroad subjects is\r\nCharles Francis Adams, Jr., ex-president of the Union Pacific Railroad\r\nand formerly a member of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the\r\nState of Massachusetts. After twenty years' constant association with\r\nrailroad men, Mr. Adams should certainly know the character of his\r\nquondam colleagues. In his book, \"Railroads, Their Origin and Problems,\"\r\nhe says of them: \"Lawlessness and violence among themselves [_i. e._,\r\nthe various railroad systems], the continual effort of each member to\r\nprotect itself and to secure the advantage over others, have, as they\r\nusually do, bred a general spirit of distrust, bad faith and cunning,\r\nuntil railroad officials have become hardly better than a race of\r\nhorse-jockeys on a large scale. There are notable exceptions to this\r\nstatement, but, taken as a whole, the tone among them is indisputably\r\nlow. There is none of that steady confidence in each other, that easy\r\ngood faith, that _esprit du corps_, upon which alone system and order\r\ncan rest. On the contrary, the leading idea in the mind of the active\r\nrailroad agent is that some one is always cheating him, or that he is\r\nnever getting his share in something. If he enters into an agreement,\r\nhis life is passed in watching the other parties to it, lest by some\r\ncunning device they keep it in form and break it in spirit. Peace is\r\nwith him always a condition of semi-warfare, while honor for its own\r\nsake and good faith apart from self-interest are, in a business point of\r\nview, symptoms of youth and a defective education.\" And again, in an\r\naddress delivered before the Commercial Club of Boston in December,\r\n1888, Mr. Adams expressed his opinion concerning the average railroad\r\nmanager of to-day as follows: \"That the general railroad situation of\r\nthe country is at present unsatisfactory is apparent. Stockholders are\r\ncomplaining; directors are bewildered; bankers are frightened. Yet that\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Act is in the main responsible for all these\r\nresults, remains to be proved. In my opinion, the difficulty is far more\r\ndeep-seated and radical. In plain words, it does not lie in any act of\r\nlegislation, State or National; and it does lie in the covetousness,\r\nwant of good faith and low moral tone of those in whose hands the\r\nmanagement of the railroad system now is; in a word, in the absence\r\namong men of any high standard of commercial honor. These are strong\r\nwords, and yet, as the result of a personal experience stretching over\r\nnearly twenty years, I make bold to say they are not so strong as the\r\noccasion would justify. The railroad system of this country, especially\r\nof the regions west of Chicago, is to-day managed on principles\r\nwhich--unless a change of heart occurs, and that soon--must inevitably\r\nlead to financial disaster of the most serious kind. There is among the\r\nlines composing that system an utter disregard of those fundamental\r\nideas of truth, fair play and fair dealing which lies at the foundation,\r\nnot only of the Christian faith, but of civilization itself. With them\r\nthere is but one rule--that, many years ago, put by Wordsworth into the\r\nmouth of Rob Roy:\r\n\r\n    \"'The simple rule, the good old plan,\r\n    That he shall take who has the power,\r\n    And he shall keep who can.'\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the causes of the Granger movement, Mr. Adams says, in the\r\nwork above mentioned: \"That it [the Granger episode] did not originate\r\nwithout cause has already been pointed out. It is quite safe to go\r\nfurther, and to say that the movement was a necessary one, and through\r\nits results has made a solution of the railroad problem possible in this\r\ncountry. At the time that movement took shape the railroad corporations\r\nwere in fact rapidly assuming a position which could not be tolerated.\r\nCorporations, owning and operating the highways of commerce, claimed for\r\nthemselves a species of immunity from the control of the law-making\r\npower. When laws were passed with a view to their regulation they\r\nreceived them in a way which was at once arrogant and singularly\r\ninjudicious. The officers entrusted with the execution of those laws\r\nthey contemptuously ignored. Sheltering themselves behind the Dartmouth\r\nCollege decision, they practically undertook to set even public opinion\r\nat defiance. Indeed, there can be no doubt that those representing these\r\ncorporations had at this juncture not only become fully educated up to\r\nthe idea that the gross inequalities and ruinous discriminations to\r\nwhich in their business they were accustomed were necessary incidents to\r\nit which afforded no just ground of complaint to any one, but they also\r\nthought that any attempt to rectify them was a gross outrage on the\r\nelementary principles both of common sense and of constitutional law. In\r\nother words, they had thoroughly got it into their heads that they, as\r\ncommon carriers, were in no way bound to afford equal facilities to all,\r\nand, indeed, that it was in the last degree absurd and unreasonable to\r\nexpect them to do so. The Granger method was probably as good a method\r\nof approaching men in this frame of mind as could have been devised.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the educational value of railroad competition, Mr. Adams\r\nsays: \"Undoubtedly the fierce struggles between rival corporations\r\nwhich marked the history of railroad development, both here and in\r\nEngland, were very prominent factors in the work of forcing the systems\r\nof the two countries up to their present degree of efficiency. Railroad\r\ncompetition has been a great educator for railroad men. It has not only\r\ntaught them how much they could do, but also how very cheaply they could\r\ndo it. Under the strong stimulus of rivalry they have done not only what\r\nthey declared were impossibilities, but what they really believed to be\r\nsuch.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams has, from his long association with railroad managers, imbibed\r\none heresy which is in strange discord with the general soundness of his\r\nopinions. He holds that the railroad system was left to develop upon a\r\nfalse basis, inasmuch as the American people relied for protecting the\r\ncommunity from abuses upon general laws authorizing the freest possible\r\nrailroad construction everywhere and by any one. It can therefore not be\r\nsurprising that Mr. Adams is an advocate of the legalized pool. He is of\r\nthe opinion that secret combinations among railroads, inasmuch as they\r\nalways have existed, always will exist as long as the railroad system\r\ncontinues as it now is. Hence he proposes to legalize a practice which\r\nthe law cannot prevent, and by so doing to enable the railroads to\r\nconfederate themselves in a manner which shall be at once both public\r\nand responsible. The reply might be made that there are many other\r\nconspiracies which the law cannot always prevent, but that this is no\r\nreason why conspiracies should be legalized. If pools and other railroad\r\nabuses had, since the beginning of the railroad era, been treated as\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors, and punished as such by the imposition of heavy\r\nfines, few people would to-day be ready to offer apologies for them. If\r\nthe time shall ever come when pools must be legalized it will be time\r\nfor railroad control equivalent to Government ownership.\r\n\r\nAmong the more recent writers upon railroad subjects is W. D. Dabney,\r\nlate chairman of the Committee on Railways and Internal Navigation in\r\nthe Legislature of Virginia. Mr. Dabney favors State control, and is, on\r\nthe whole, friendly to the Interstate Commerce Act. He sees danger in\r\nthe pool, but inclines to the belief that the public benefit derived\r\nfrom the pooling system outweighs the danger of public detriment from\r\nits existence. The following is his chief argument for a legalized pool:\r\n\"Perhaps, so long as railroad companies continue to enjoy an absolute\r\nmonopoly of transportation over their own lines, so that free\r\ncompetition is restricted in its operation to a comparatively few\r\nfavored points, it may be worthy of serious consideration whether it\r\nwould not be better to legalize than to prohibit pooling, taking care to\r\nput the whole matter under strict public supervision and control. The\r\ncompanies would then be left comparatively free to bring their local\r\nrates into something like harmony with the long-distance rates, and\r\nshould they fail to do so where the needs of the local community and\r\ntheir revenues make it proper to be done, then it is the function of\r\npublic regulation to compel it to be done.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Interstate Commerce Act Mr. Dabney says: \"The legislation\r\nrecently enacted by Congress for the regulation of commerce by railway\r\nis the result of more careful and intelligent deliberation perhaps than\r\nany other measure of similar character, and it is not unlikely that the\r\nlegislation of many of the States will sooner or later be conformed to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe speaks at some length of the drift toward railroad centralization. A\r\nfew extracts from this passage may be here given: \"That the tendency\r\ntowards the unification and consolidation of different and competitive\r\nlines has been decidedly increased by the anti-pooling and the long and\r\nshort haul sections of the Interstate Commerce Law can hardly be\r\ndoubted.... The modern device of the 'trust' as a means of unifying\r\nindustrial interests and eliminating competition had not yet been\r\napplied in the field of railroad transportation.... The scheme of trust\r\nhere briefly outlined would probably require for its successful\r\noperation the concurrence of the entire stockholding interest of each\r\ncompany embraced in it; and herein, it seems likely, will be found the\r\nchief difficulty in perfecting such a scheme. Should it ever be\r\nperfected, a far more stringent public supervision and control of the\r\nrailroad transportation of the country will be demanded.\"\r\n\r\nAnother author, Charles Whitney Baker, associate editor of the\r\n_Engineering News_, suggests in his book, \"Monopolies and the People,\" a\r\nplan for the reorganization of our railroad system, to remedy the evils\r\nof monopoly which are at present connected with railroad management. The\r\nfollowing quotation from his work outlines the system proposed: \"Let the\r\nGovernment acquire the title of the franchise, permanent way and real\r\nestate of all the railway lines in the country. Let a few corporations\r\nbe organized under Government auspices, and let each, by the terms of\r\nits charter, receive a perpetual lease of all the railway lines built,\r\nor to be built, within a given territory. Let the territory of each of\r\nthese corporations be so large, and so planned with regard to its\r\nneighbors, that there shall be, so far as possible, no competition\r\nbetween them. For instance, one corporation would operate all the lines\r\nsouth of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi River; another all lines\r\neast of the Hudson and of Lake Champlain, etc. Let the terms of rental\r\nof these lines be about 3-1/4 per cent. on the road's actual 'present\r\ncost' (the sum of money it would cost to rebuild it entirely at present\r\nprices of material and labor), less a due allowance for depreciation.\r\nThe corporations would be obliged to keep the property in as good\r\ncondition as when received, and would own absolutely all their\r\nrolling-stock, machinery, etc.\" The proposed reform measures, it must be\r\nadmitted, are very good in theory, but their practical application is\r\nunfortunately entirely out of the question under our system of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. John M. Bonham is the author of a recent work entitled \"Railway\r\nSecrecy and Trusts.\" This writer, upon the whole, takes advanced ground\r\nin dealing with the question of railroad reform. He deems the present\r\ninterstate legislation inadequate to correct all the graver railroad\r\nevils, expressing his views upon this subject as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Railway construction continues to increase in the United\r\n      States with immense rapidity. Concurrent with this increase,\r\n      and notwithstanding all the efforts that have been made at\r\n      restraint, the aggressions upon political and industrial\r\n      rights increase also. Nor is it likely that without more\r\n      rigorous control than is now exercised these aggressions\r\n      will be any less active than they are to-day. It is coming\r\n      to be pretty generally realized that the Interstate Commerce\r\n      legislation has not fulfilled the expectation of its\r\n      friends. But this is a frequent trait of tentative\r\n      legislation. It is not reasonable to expect that the first\r\n      efforts to solve a problem the factors of which are so\r\n      hidden and complex will be followed by complete success.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the changes needed to make Government regulation in the\r\nUnited States more effective, he says:\r\n\r\n      \"A reform which would deal with an elaborate system of evil\r\n      cannot, therefore, be confined to treating consequences,\r\n      the separate instances of the system. There must be a power\r\n      which can go behind these and grapple with causes. There\r\n      must, therefore, be something more than a court. There must\r\n      be a commission, a department of government which will\r\n      provide organized supervision and inspection against which\r\n      the quasi-public corporation can claim no privacy as\r\n      inviolable. Such a department must be clothed with the power\r\n      to ascertain precisely where and how the evils of the\r\n      present methods originate, and when these are ascertained it\r\n      must be able to apply the remedy at the source of evil. The\r\n      remedial force must be of a preventive kind.\"\r\n\r\nA few grave misstatements of historical facts greatly mar Mr. Bonham's\r\nbook. He makes, for instance, the following statement:\r\n\r\n      \"Following this came restrictive legislation, which, in some\r\n      instances, was so unreasonable as to make any railway\r\n      management impossible. Some of the Granger legislation, and\r\n      especially that of Iowa, was of this character, as were also\r\n      some of the earlier efforts to secure Congressional\r\n      legislation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was left to Mr. Bonham to discover that legislation ever made\r\nrailroad management impossible in Iowa. The General Assembly of Iowa\r\npassed at two different times railroad laws that were greatly obnoxious\r\nto railroad managers. In 1874 it passed a maximum tariff act which, at\r\nthe urgent solicitation of the railroad forces, was repealed four years\r\nlater; and in 1888 it passed an act containing the principles of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act and in addition authorizing the Board of\r\nRailroad Commissioners to fix _prima facie_ rates. Strange as it may\r\nseem to Mr. Bonham and other people inclined to believe without\r\ninvestigation the statements of railroad men, the earnings of the Iowa\r\nroads greatly increased immediately after the enactment of the so-called\r\nGranger laws in 1874, as the following table will show:\r\n\r\n  Year.  Miles of Railroad.  Gross Receipts.\r\n\r\n  1871          2,850          $12,395,826\r\n  1872          3,642           14,534,408\r\n  1873          3,728           15,430,619\r\n  1874          3,765           15,568,907\r\n  1875          3,823           18,422,587\r\n  1876          3,938           17,221,032\r\n  1877          4,075           20,714,496\r\n  1878          4,157           21,294,275\r\n\r\nWhen the Granger law was repealed in 1878, the railroads were earning\r\n$1,000 per mile more than they were earning when the law was enacted.\r\nThe present railroad law, which was passed in 1888, and has also been\r\nthe subject of extreme criticism on the part of railroad organs, has had\r\nthe same beneficial effect. The law, owing to the obstacles thrown in\r\nits way by the railroad managers, did not become operative until 1889.\r\nFrom July 1st, 1889, to June 30th, 1892, the gross railroad earnings of\r\nthe Iowa roads, which for three years had been at a standstill,\r\nincreased and were over $7,000,000 more in 1892 than they had been any\r\nyear previous to 1889, as will be seen from the table below:\r\n\r\n  Gross Railroad Earnings in Iowa.\r\n\r\n   1886-87          $37,539,730\r\n   1887-88           37,295,586\r\n   1888-89           37,469,276\r\n   1889-90           41,318,133\r\n   1890-91           43,102,399\r\n   1891-92           44,540,000\r\n\r\nThe net earnings per mile of the Iowa roads were $1,421.91 in the year\r\n1888-89, and $1,821.37 the year following. The total net earnings of all\r\nIowa roads during the year ending June 30th, 1891, were $14,463,106,\r\nagainst $11,861,310 during the year ending June 30th, 1889, and were\r\nstill greater for the year ending June 30, 1892. No further vindication\r\nof the Iowa law is necessary. These figures show plainly that the\r\nlowering and equalizing of the rates not only increased the roads'\r\nbusiness and income, but also their net earnings. And it must be\r\nremembered that the reports showing these facts were made by the\r\nrailroad companies and were certainly not made with any intention of\r\nprejudicing the cause of the railroad manager.\r\n\r\nJames F. Hudson, the author of \"The Railways and the Republic,\" is a\r\nvery exhaustive and instructive writer upon the subject of railroad\r\nabuses. His material is well selected, and the subject ably presented.\r\nTo the assertion of railroad managers, that railroad regulation\r\ninjuriously affects the value of railroad property, he makes the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n      \"Suppose that it were true, as these jurists and writers\r\n      claim, that by the assertion of the public right to regulate\r\n      the railways the value of their property is decreased, are\r\n      there no other property rights involved? Do railway\r\n      investments form the only property in the land which\r\n      requires the protection of the law? Are we to understand\r\n      these judgments and their indorsers to mean that because\r\n      railroad property will depreciate if certain principles of\r\n      justice prevail, therefore justice is to be set aside for\r\n      the benefit of railway property? If the magnitude of\r\n      interests involved is to be of weight in deciding such\r\n      questions, let us put against 'the hundreds of millions' of\r\n      railway property on the one side the thousands of millions\r\n      of private property on the other. Railway regulation,\r\n      according to a writer in the _Princeton Review_, is\r\n      'confiscation of railroad property;' but this puts wholly\r\n      out of the question the idea of private property which is\r\n      rendered possible by leaving unchecked the power of the\r\n      railways over commerce and manufactures through the\r\n      manipulation of freight rates. Of the two parties in\r\n      interest the shippers represent far greater property\r\n      interests than the carriers, although the latter, by their\r\n      organization, are more powerful. I have yet to hear of a\r\n      single case where restrictive railway legislation has\r\n      seriously damaged the honest valuation of any railway. I\r\n      have yet to learn of any seriously proposed scheme of\r\n      regulation that has proposed to cut down railway profits\r\n      below a fair dividend on capital actually invested. But the\r\n      entire Nation knows of one notorious case in which the\r\n      discriminating policy of the leading railways of the country\r\n      has resulted in the wholesale confiscation of private\r\n      property for the benefit of a favored corporation.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the inconsistency presented by the plea of railroad managers\r\nfor a legalized pool, Mr. Hudson says:\r\n\r\n      \"It has been argued for years that the subject is so\r\n      delicate and vast that it must not be touched by legislation\r\n      in the public interest. To protect the rights of the\r\n      ordinary shipper against the favorite of the railway would\r\n      so hamper the operations of trade, it has been repeated\r\n      times without number, as to take away the independence of\r\n      the railways and destroy the freedom of competition. Yet,\r\n      after years of argument that Government has no\r\n      constitutional power to interfere with the railways, and of\r\n      demonstration that all such interference must be ill-advised\r\n      and injurious, the railway logic comes to the surprising\r\n      climax of appealing to legislation for the aid of the law in\r\n      upholding their efforts to prevent competition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson maintains that if the pool were legalized it would only be a\r\nmeans of swelling railroad earnings. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"If the pool would maintain equitable rates its success\r\n      might be desired, but what guarantee is there that the\r\n      complete establishment of its power would make such rates?\r\n      Its very character, the functions of the men who control its\r\n      policy, and its avowed object of swelling the earnings of\r\n      railways by artificial methods, forbid such an expectation.\r\n      Make the success of the pool absolute, so that it can work\r\n      without fear of competition, and its rates will be uniform,\r\n      but of such a character that their uniformity will be a\r\n      public grievance and burden.... A grave effect of this\r\n      policy, though not easily calculable, is the ability it\r\n      gives to railway officials to control the prices of stocks,\r\n      and the temptation to enhance their fortunes by so doing....\r\n      It is a heavy indictment against the pooling system that it\r\n      gives power to avaricious and unscrupulous men in railway\r\n      management to enrich themselves at the cost of shareholders\r\n      and investors, both by forming combinations and by exciting\r\n      disputes or ruptures in them.\"\r\n\r\nThe question whether the common law does not protect the public\r\nsufficiently is well answered by Mr. Hudson as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The common law is sufficient in theory, but it has failed\r\n      in practice.... In practice, legal remedies against railway\r\n      injustice can be applied to the courts only by fighting the\r\n      railways at such disadvantages that the ordinary business\r\n      man will never undertake it except in desperate cases. Every\r\n      advantage of strength and position is with the railways....\r\n      This [the railroad] power has kept courts in its pay; it\r\n      defies the principles of common law and nullifies the\r\n      constitutional provisions of a dozen States; it has many\r\n      representatives in Congress and unnumbered seats in the\r\n      State legislatures. No ordinary body of men can permanently\r\n      resist it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the remedy which Mr. Hudson proposes for the correction of railroad\r\nevils is one of doubtful efficacy. It is this:\r\n\r\n      \"Legislation should restore the character of public highways\r\n      to the railways by securing to all persons the right to run\r\n      trains over their track under proper regulations, and by\r\n      defining the distinction between the proprietorship and\r\n      maintenance of the railway and the business of common\r\n      carriers.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is admitted that the opening of the railroads to the free use\r\nof competing carriers is not necessarily impractical from a technical\r\npoint of view, it cannot be admitted that the proposed remedy would cure\r\nthe evil. There would certainly be nothing to hinder carrying companies\r\nforming a trust which might prove more dangerous to the interests of\r\nshippers than are to-day the combinations of the railroad companies.\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson devotes a chapter to the railroad power in politics, and\r\nshows how corporations, through their wealth, have secured the greatest\r\nand most responsible offices in the executive, legislative and judiciary\r\ndepartments of the Government. Speaking of their influence in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, he says:\r\n\r\n      \"The assertion that Jay Gould paid $100,000 to the\r\n      Republican campaign fund in 1880, in return for which Judge\r\n      Stanley Mathews was nominated to the Supreme Bench, is\r\n      denied as a political slander; but the fact remains that\r\n      this brilliant advocate of the railway theories of law has\r\n      been placed in the high tribunal, and that his presence\r\n      there together with Justice Field, long a judicial advocate\r\n      of the corporations, is expected to protect the railways in\r\n      future against such constructions of law as the Granger\r\n      decisions.\"\r\n\r\nAn English writer, Mr. J.S. Jeans, presents, in his \"Railway Problems,\"\r\na great deal that is of interest to American readers. The statistical\r\ndata of his work are especially interesting. We learn that the United\r\nKingdom has nearly twenty railroad employes per mile of road operated,\r\nto less than five in the United States, and that the average number of\r\nemployes per £1,000 ($4,850) of gross earnings is on the railroads of\r\nthe United Kingdom 5.4 to only about half as many in the United States.\r\nWe further learn that the average earnings per train mile in America are\r\nover 25 per cent. higher than they are in the United Kingdom, and exceed\r\nthose of most European countries.\r\n\r\nOf the remarkable increase in number and the profitableness of the\r\nthird-class passenger traffic in England Mr. Jeans says:\r\n\r\n      \"There has hitherto been a great lack of knowledge in this\r\n      country as to the extent to which the different classes of\r\n      passenger traffic yield adequate profit to the railroad\r\n      companies. English passenger traffic differs from that of\r\n      most other countries in this respect, that the chief\r\n      companies attach third-class carriages to almost every\r\n      train. The accommodation provided for third-class passengers\r\n      in England is also much superior to what is found in other\r\n      countries where there is the same distinction of classes.\r\n      The effect of those two distinguishing features of the\r\n      English railway system is that third-class carriages are\r\n      much more and first-class carriages much less utilized than\r\n      in other countries. The tendency appears to be towards an\r\n      increasing use of third-class, and a decreasing use of\r\n      first-class vehicles. But, all the same, the leading English\r\n      lines continue to provide a large proportion of first-class\r\n      accommodation in every train, and it is no unusual thing to\r\n      find the third-class carriages of express trains absolutely\r\n      full, while first-class carriages are almost empty. The\r\n      natural result is that third-class travel is a source of\r\n      profit, while first-class travel is not.... So far as\r\n      passenger traffic is a source of net profit, that profit is\r\n      contributed by the third-class. The total receipts from\r\n      passenger traffic in England and Wales amounted in 1885 to\r\n      £21,968,000. But if the average receipts per carriage over\r\n      the whole had been the same as in the case of the Midland\r\n      first-class vehicles, namely, £330, the total receipts from\r\n      passenger traffic would only have been about nine millions.\r\n      It is not necessary to be an expert in order to see that\r\n      traffic so conducted must be attended with a very serious\r\n      loss.\"\r\n\r\nOf the stock-watering of American railroad companies Mr. Jeans says:\r\n\r\n      \"It seldom happens that in the United States the cost of a\r\n      railway and its equivalent corresponds, as it ought to, to\r\n      the total capital expenditure. There is no country in the\r\n      world where the business of watering stocks is better\r\n      understood or carried out more systematically and on so\r\n      large a scale. For this reason there is liable to be a great\r\n      deal of error entertained in reference to the natural cost\r\n      of American lines.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many financial journals that are so closely identified with\r\nthe speculative interests of the country, and many railway papers that\r\ndepend so largely upon railway men for support, that railway managers\r\nare never without a medium through which they can present their views to\r\nthe public. A systematic and concerted effort is also constantly made by\r\nthe railroads to pervert the press of the country at large. The great\r\ncity papers generally yield to their influences and enlist in their\r\nservice, and yet there are notable exceptions to this.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the extravagant sums which the railroads paid to the\r\ngreat dailies, ostensibly for advertising, but in fact for their good\r\nwill and other services, a railroad superintendent recently said that it\r\nwas an infamous outrage, and yet it was the best investment of money\r\nthat his company could make. The country papers have shown more\r\nintegrity in maintaining their independence, but the railroads are not\r\nwithout their organs among them. It is not unfrequent to find some of\r\nthem defending railroad abuses with all the apparent zeal of a Wall\r\nStreet organ, and a glance at their columns often reminds one of Mr.\r\nLincoln's story of the Irishman and the pig. Mr. Lincoln defended an\r\nIrishman against the charge of stealing a pig. After the testimony was\r\ntaken in court, Mr. Lincoln called his client aside and told him that\r\nthe testimony was so strong against him, and that the case was so clear,\r\nthat it was impossible for him to escape conviction, and he advised him\r\nto plead guilty and throw himself on the mercy of the court. \"No, Mr.\r\nLincoln,\" said Patrick, \"you go back and make one of your great speeches\r\nand swing your long arms and talk loud to the jury, and you will win\r\nthe case.\" Mr. Lincoln, in accordance with that disposition to\r\naccommodate so strongly characteristic of him, did as he was directed by\r\nhis client, and to his great surprise the jury promptly brought in a\r\nverdict of not guilty. After it was all over, Mr. Lincoln said: \"Now,\r\nPatrick, tell me why that jury acquitted you. I know that you stole the\r\npig, and my speech had nothing to do in securing your acquittal.\"\r\nPatrick replied: \"And sure, Mr. Lincoln, every one of those jurymen ate\r\na piece of the pig.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD LITERATURE--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailroad questions have become of such general interest that their\r\ndiscussion has become a prominent factor of magazine literature. It is a\r\nsignificant fact that these contributors are usually railroad men, and\r\nunder these circumstances an unbiased discussion of the questions at\r\nissue is indeed a rare occurrence. It is but too frequently the sole\r\nobject of the contributor, and not unfrequently even of the publisher,\r\nto create a public sentiment in favor of the unjust demands of railroad\r\nmanagers.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years systematic efforts have been made by the\r\nrailroad interests to influence public opinion against the Interstate\r\nCommerce Law and restrictive State legislation through the leading\r\nmagazines of the country. Mr. Sidney Dillon, president of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad, in an article which appeared in the April (1891)\r\nnumber of the _North American Review_, under the title \"The West and the\r\nRailroads,\" endeavors to show that the West is indebted to the railroad\r\nmanagers for nearly all of the blessings which its people enjoy, and\r\nthat therefore railroad legislation in the West is a symptom of rank\r\ningratitude. He prefaces his argument with the remark that the elder\r\nportions of our commonwealth have already forgotten, and the younger\r\nportions do not comprehend or appreciate, that but for the railroads\r\nwhat we now style the Great West would be, except in the valley of the\r\nMississippi, an unknown and unproductive wilderness. He then argues\r\nthat, inasmuch as the railroads carry the wheat of Dakota and Minnesota\r\nto the sea-coast, and bring those sections of our community into direct\r\nrelation with hungry and opulent Liverpool, the world should \"thank the\r\nrailway for the opportunity to buy wheat, but none the less should the\r\nWest thank the railway for the opportunity to sell wheat.\" It does not\r\nseem to occur to Mr. Dillon that the railway might, with equal\r\npropriety, thank the world in general, and the Great West in particular,\r\nfor its opportunity to carry wheat.\r\n\r\nWe are also told that the railway has reclaimed from nature immense\r\ntracts of land that were worthless except as to their possibilities,\r\nwhich once seemed too vague and remote to be considered and are to-day\r\nvaluable; that it has changed the character of the soil as well as the\r\nclimate of the West, and we are almost given to understand that in many\r\nrespects it has assumed the functions of Providence. Mr. Dillon\r\ngenerously admits, however, that railways have not been built from\r\nphilanthropic motives and that we find among railroad promoters and\r\ncontractors men of large fortunes. He then proceeds to reprimand the\r\nStates west of the Mississippi for their \"ungrateful\" legislation,\r\nwhich, he says, interferes with the business of the railway, even to the\r\nminutest detail, and always to its detriment. Such legislation\r\nexasperates Mr. Dillon the more because it originated in States \"which\r\nhappened to be the communities that owe their birth, existence and\r\nprosperity to these very railways.\" Mr. Dillon then gives vent to his\r\nwrath by the use of such terms as impertinence, ignorance and\r\ndemagogism. He holds that legislative enactments as to the rights and\r\nliabilities of railway corporations are useless, \"because the common law\r\nhas long since established these as pertaining to common carriers, and\r\nthe courts are open to redress all real grievances of the citizen.\" Upon\r\nthis theory we might as well dispense with the legislative department of\r\nthe Government, for there is no relation in the community to which the\r\nprinciples of the common law can not be applied. Besides this, Mr.\r\nDillon entirely ignores the fact that the railway company is not only a\r\ncommon carrier, but the keeper of the highway, and as such is subject to\r\nGovernment control as much as the turnpike tollgate keeper or the\r\ncollector of customs. \"Then as to prices.\" Mr. Dillon continues: \"These\r\nwill always be taken care of by the great law of competition, which\r\nobtains wherever any human service is to be performed for a pecuniary\r\nconsideration. That any railway, anywhere in a republic, should be a\r\nmonopoly, is not a supposable case.\"\r\n\r\nLike the rest of railway men, Mr. Dillon excels in painting dark\r\npictures of railroad catastrophes. A sample production of his art is\r\nhere presented:\r\n\r\n      \"One of the greatest dangers to the community in a republic\r\n      is this: that it is in the power of reckless, misguided or\r\n      designing men to procure the passage of statutes that are\r\n      ostensibly for the public interest and that may lead to\r\n      enormous injuries. Let us imagine for a moment that all\r\n      railways in the United States were at once annihilated. Such\r\n      a catastrophe is not, in itself, inconceivable; the\r\n      imagination can grasp it, but no imagination can picture the\r\n      infinite sufferings that would at once result to every man,\r\n      woman and child in the entire country. Now, every step taken\r\n      to impede or cripple the business and progress of our\r\n      railways is a step towards just such a catastrophe, and\r\n      therefore a destructive tendency.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dillon, losing sight of all other interests, did not think that his\r\nnonsensical mode of reasoning would apply equally well to them. Let us,\r\nfor instance, imagine for a moment that all of the farms of the United\r\nStates were at once annihilated. Can the imagination picture the\r\ninfinite sufferings that would at once result to every man, woman and\r\nchild in the whole country? Now, is not any step taken to impede or\r\ncripple the business of farming a step towards just such a catastrophe,\r\nand therefore of a destructive tendency? Mr. Dillon then avails himself\r\nof an opportunity to give the people of the United States some\r\ngratuitous advice when he says:\r\n\r\n      \"We do not arrogate superior wisdom or intelligence to\r\n      ourselves when we suggest to the people of the United\r\n      States, and especially that portion of the country where\r\n      railroads have been the subject of what we consider to be\r\n      excessive legislation, that the rational mode of treating\r\n      any form of human industry that has for its object the\r\n      performance of desired and lawful service is to let it\r\n      alone, and that the railway is no exception to this\r\n      principle.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the very plea that Jefferson Davis made when he kindled the\r\nflame of treason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the March, 1891, number of the _Forum_, Mr. W. M. Acworth discusses,\r\nunder the title \"Railways under Government Control,\" the working of the\r\nrailway systems of the different nations. He holds that the management\r\nof railroads which are the property of the State is, as a rule, greatly\r\ninferior to the management of those roads which are the property of\r\nprivate trading corporations; he assigns to the railway experts of\r\nEngland and America the first places among the railway experts of the\r\nworld, and appears to attribute all the good in the railroad management\r\nof these countries to the absence of State interference, and all the\r\nevil in the management of the railroads of other countries to the fact\r\nthat such interference exists. He says of the railroads of England and\r\nthe United States:\r\n\r\n      \"In speed and accommodation, in the energy which pushes\r\n      railways into remote districts, and in the skill which\r\n      creates a traffic where no traffic existed before, they\r\n      stand to-day in the front rank, as they have stood for the\r\n      last half century. To say that they are very far from\r\n      perfect is nothing; it is only to say that they are worked\r\n      by human agency. Their worst enemies will scarcely deny that\r\n      they are at least alive; so long as there is life there may\r\n      be growth, and we may hope to see them outgrow the faults of\r\n      their youth. The charge made against State railway systems\r\n      is that they are incapable of vigorous life. The old adage\r\n      which proclaimed that 'necessity is the mother of invention'\r\n      has been re-stated of late years as the law of the survival\r\n      of the fittest in the struggle for existence. If the\r\n      doctrine is true, the State railway system, relieved from\r\n      the necessity of struggle, must cease to be fit and will\r\n      fail to survive.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is not intended to enter here into a defense of a State railway\r\nsystem, it may justly be questioned whether \"the State railway system,\r\nrelieved from the necessity of struggle, must cease to be fit and will\r\nfail to survive.\" The growth of the State system in Europe is in itself\r\na sufficient refutation of Mr. Acworth's theory. The mail service has\r\nfor several hundred years been a monopoly of the government; but, while\r\nit is far from being perfect, it remains to be demonstrated that private\r\nenterprise could give to the public a better service in the long run.\r\n\r\nMr. Acworth is an Englishman who in former years wrote many bitter\r\nthings concerning the abuses which he then thought he saw in the\r\nmanagement of the railroads of his native country, which, according to\r\nhis own statement, are, besides those of the United States, the only\r\nroads in the world for whose regulation competition has been relied upon\r\nin the past. Mr. Acworth has become a convert to the _laissez faire_\r\ntheory of dealing with railroads and now evinces an unusual, but perhaps\r\npardonable, zeal in the defense of his new position. In the preface to\r\nhis book, \"The Railways of England,\" he says upon the subject:\r\n\r\n      \"I have published before now not a few criticisms (which\r\n      were meant to be scathing) on English railways anonymously.\r\n      I find myself using, under my own name, the language of\r\n      almost unvarying panegyric. This is partly to be explained\r\n      by the plan of the book, which professes to set before the\r\n      reader those points on each line which best merit\r\n      description--its excellencies, therefore, rather than its\r\n      defects. Much more, however, is it due to a change of\r\n      opinion in the writer.... I have found in so many cases that\r\n      a satisfactory reply existed to my former criticisms, that I\r\n      have perhaps assumed that such an answer would be\r\n      forthcoming in all; and if I have taken up too much the\r\n      position of an apologist, where I should have been content\r\n      to be merely an observer, let me plead as my excuse that I\r\n      am only displaying the traditional zeal of the new-made\r\n      convert.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Hadley, of whose work, \"Railroad Transportation, its History and\r\nits Law,\" mention has been made above, contributed an article to the\r\nApril, 1891, number of the _Forum_, under the title \"Railway Passenger\r\nRates.\" He endeavors to show that the high passenger rates of American\r\nrailroads are due solely to superior service. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"Continental Europe pays two-thirds as much as America or\r\n      England and gets an inferior article. India pays still less\r\n      and gets still less. The difference is seen both in quality\r\n      and quantity of service. In India express trains rarely run\r\n      at a greater speed than 25 miles an hour. In Germany and\r\n      France their speed ranges from 25 to 35 miles an hour, and\r\n      only in exceptional instances is more than 40 miles an hour.\r\n      In the United States and in England the maximum speed rises\r\n      as high as 50, or, in exceptional instances, 60 miles an\r\n      hour. With regard to the comfort of the cars in different\r\n      countries, there is more room for difference of opinion;\r\n      but there can be no doubt that the average traveler in the\r\n      United States, or even in the English third-class car, fares\r\n      better than he would in the corresponding class on\r\n      continental railroads, and infinitely better than the bulk\r\n      of travelers in British India.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that upon the whole the speed of American and English\r\nrailroads is greater than that of continental roads, yet the difference\r\nis much less than Mr. Hadley would make us believe. The fast trains of\r\nthe Berlin and Hamburg Railroad, according to Röll's \"Railroad\r\nEncyclopedia,\" make the distance of 179 miles in three hours and\r\nforty-four minutes. The average speed is therefore 48 miles an hour.\r\nThere are but few lines in the United States whose regular express\r\ntrains run at a greater speed. The express trains of the Berlin and\r\nBrunswick line make 45-1/2 miles an hour. Trains are run on the Vienna\r\nand Buda-Pesth Railway at the rate of 42 miles an hour and on the Paris\r\nand Calais Railway at a rate of over 40 miles an hour. Official reports\r\ngive the average speed of express trains in Northern Germany as 32.2\r\nmiles per hour, which is considerably more than the average speed of our\r\nWestern trains, upon which the rates charged are twice as high as those\r\ncharged by German roads. The average speed of the express trains in\r\nEngland was 35.7 miles per hour in 1890, in the Netherlands 30.7 miles,\r\nin France 30 miles, in Denmark and Southern Germany 28.8 miles and in\r\nAustria 27.8 miles per hour. Accurate statistics showing the average\r\nspeed in America are not in existence, but it may well be questioned\r\nwhether the difference between the speed of American and European trains\r\nis sufficient to justify upon that score any essential difference in the\r\nrates. Mr. Hadley's statement that the average traveler in the United\r\nStates, or even in the English third class, fares better than he would\r\nin the corresponding class on continental railroads, is far too sweeping\r\nto be true. It is certain that the Belgian, German, Austrian or French\r\nsecond-class coupes are much to be preferred to the smoking and emigrant\r\ncars which in America are made to take their places.\r\n\r\nTo prove that much more work is demanded of American railroads than of\r\nEuropean railroads, Mr. Hadley presents the following table:\r\n\r\n                                                        Annual Train\r\n                                           Miles run     Service per\r\n                                           by Trains       head of\r\n    Countries.             Population.     annually.

The figures show that, for\r\nevery man, woman and child, a train is run twelve miles annually in the\r\nUnited States, in Great Britain eight miles, in Germany or France a\r\nlittle less than four miles, in Austria not much more than a mile and a\r\nhalf, and in British India less than a quarter of a mile.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement, even if correct, is certainly misleading. No allowance\r\nis made for the greater distances and the greater average haul in\r\nAmerica, and none for our bulky raw products, which require more car\r\nroom than the manufactured goods predominating as freight in Europe.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Hadley's statement of miles run by trains annually is used in\r\nconnection with Mr. Poor's statement showing the length, for 1889, of\r\nthe railroads of the countries given in the above table, it can be shown\r\nthat the average number of trains run annually per mile is considerably\r\nless here than in Europe:\r\n\r\n                    Length of                   Average Number\r\n                    Railroad      Miles run        of Trains\r\n                    in miles      by Trains      per mile per\r\n    Countries.

In Austria-Hungary it is\r\nsomewhat less than here. It is not claimed that this is in every respect\r\na fair argument; but it is at least as fair as Mr. Hadley's. As has been\r\nstated before, the average earnings per train mile are larger in the\r\nUnited States than in most nations, and, excepting Sweden, railway\r\ncapital has the highest gross earnings of any nation in the world; and\r\nwhen Mr. Hadley bases his argument in favor of higher rates for American\r\nrailroads than for those of Europe upon the claim that the latter secure\r\nlarger train loads, he simply reasons from false premises.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley then continues:\r\n\r\n      \"But why cannot our railroad men, with our present train\r\n      service, secure larger loads by making lower rates, and give\r\n      us cheap service as well as plenty of it? Why cannot we\r\n      secure two good things instead of one? For two reasons:\r\n      First, because it is not certain that low rates will be\r\n      followed by greatly increased travel; second, because such\r\n      increased travel would not be so economical to handle in\r\n      America as it is in Europe. It is wrong to assume that,\r\n      because reductions of charges in Europe have increased travel\r\n      enormously, they would have a proportionate effect in America\r\n      and a corresponding advantage in American railroad economy.\r\n      It is a somewhat significant fact that second-class trains at\r\n      reduced rates have been extremely successful in Europe and\r\n      not at all so in America. Other things being equal, the\r\n      American public would be glad to have its travel at lower\r\n      fares; but it cares more for comfort and speed, and for being\r\n      able to travel at its own times, than for a slight difference\r\n      in charge. The assumption so frequently made, that a\r\n      reduction in fares would cause an enormous increase in travel\r\n      in this country, is for the most part a pure assumption, not\r\n      borne out by the facts.\"\r\n\r\nThe great increase in business which has everywhere followed reductions\r\nin postage rates, telegraph rates and street-car fares, as well as\r\nrailroad rates, sufficiently refutes the assertion that it is not\r\ncertain that low rates would be followed by greatly increased travel. If\r\nthe second class has not been as successful here as in Europe this is\r\nsolely due to the fact that the American railroad companies have\r\nsystematically discouraged second-class travel by forcing passengers\r\ninto filthy and over-crowded cars. The statement that increased travel\r\nwould not be so economical to handle in America as in Europe scarcely\r\nneeds a reply. If, as Prof. Hadley says, the American public demand more\r\nfrequent trains than the people of Europe, and if these frequent trains\r\nare not at present profitable to our railroad companies, it would seem\r\nto be plainly to their interest to hold out every inducement to the\r\npublic to increase travel and thus fill their trains.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley does not aid his argument when, referring to the Hungarian\r\nzone system, he says: \"The importance of the zone system in Austria and\r\nin Hungary lies in the fact that its adoption was accompanied by a great\r\nreduction in rates. The unit rate for slow, third-class trains, which\r\nhad previously been nearly a cent and a half a mile, was reduced to less\r\nthan one cent.... The use of railroads under the new system, though\r\nvastly greater than it was before, is vastly less than that of a\r\nwell-managed American road at American rates.\" Mr. Hadley inadvertently\r\npresents here one of the very best reasons why our passenger rates\r\nshould be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, railroad men are opposed, and always have been opposed, to\r\nreduction of rates, and to all progressive movements that require\r\nincreased expenditures or threaten to temporarily reduce their revenues.\r\nWhen the introduction of the zone system was first advocated in Hungary\r\nit was opposed by just such men and just such arguments.\r\n\r\nNo one can contradict the following facts, viz.: That the average cost\r\nof European roads is much greater than that of American roads; that the\r\nnumber of railroad employes per mile is much greater there than here;\r\nthat much larger sums are expended for repairing and improving the\r\nroads, and that therefore the lives of passengers are much safer in\r\nEurope than in America; and that the average speed and corresponding\r\naccommodations of European trains, and especially those of England,\r\nGermany, France and Austria-Hungary, compare quite favorably with the\r\naverage speed and corresponding accommodations of our roads. It is,\r\nunder these circumstances, absurd to claim that the higher prices\r\ncharged by American roads are due to the greater cost of service.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley's labors as a railroad author have, it seems, greatly\r\nincreased his corporation bias. In an address which he delivered before\r\nthe American Bankers' Association at New Orleans in November, 1891, upon\r\nthe subject of \"Recent Railroad Legislation and its Effects upon the\r\nFinances of the Country,\" he made a number of assertions which ill\r\ncomport with the fairness of a public statistician or the wisdom of a\r\nYale professor. After a few introductory remarks, Prof. Hadley made the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows that railroad property has fallen in value since the\r\npassage of the Interstate Commerce Act four years and a half ago; few\r\nhave made any accurate estimate of the amount of that fall. Let us take\r\nthe stock of the leading railroad systems centering in Chicago as a\r\ntype. Here we find an aggregate shrinkage of over $60,000,000, or more\r\nthan one-quarter of the par value of the stocks.\r\n\r\n                           Par Value.       Price.

It is surprising that Prof.\r\nHadley should be ignorant of the real causes of this depreciation, which\r\nare known to nearly every Granger in the West. In 1887 the Chicago, Rock\r\nIsland and Pacific Railroad Company owned 1,121 miles of road, only 172\r\nof which were outside of the States of Illinois and Iowa. In 1891 the\r\nsame company owned 2,725 miles of road, with 1,776 miles outside of\r\nIllinois and Iowa and scattered through Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska,\r\nColorado, Indian Territory and Oklahoma. In Kansas alone the Rock Island\r\nsystem grew from two miles in 1887 to 1,059 miles in 1891. In other\r\nwords, to a little over a thousand miles of _good_ road the company's\r\nmanagers added nearly 2,000 miles of poor road and a proportionate\r\namount of new stock, and the depreciation in the company's stock which\r\nfollowed was no greater than one should have expected under such\r\ncircumstances. The managers of the Rock Island and the promoters of\r\nthese new lines found the transactions to their advantage, while the\r\noriginal stockholders of the company had to bear the imposition, as\r\nhundreds of thousands of railroad stockholders had done before them. But\r\nneither the law of Congress nor that of any State was to blame for this\r\ndepreciation of the Rock Island stock.\r\n\r\nSince 1891, railroad stocks have advanced on an average at least twenty\r\nper cent., and during the last sixty days have declined about\r\ntwenty-five per cent., although there has been no essential change in\r\ninterstate or State legislation. It is certainly as fair to call the\r\nadvance the ultimate result of restrictive railroad legislation as to\r\nattribute to that legislation the shrinkage above referred to. Extensive\r\nspeculations similar to those just mentioned were, during the same\r\nperiod, indulged in by the managers of the C., B. & Q. Railroad Company\r\nand its protegé, the C., B. & N., who, in addition to this, greatly\r\ninjured their road in 1888 by the unjust provocation of the engineers'\r\nstrike. So destructive were this strike and its consequences to the\r\ncompany's business that it is difficult to account for the motives of\r\nthose who provoked and stubbornly prolonged it except upon the theory\r\nthat it played an important role in their stock manipulations.\r\n\r\nBut the recent legislation of a considerable number of States has, in\r\nProf. Hadley's opinion, been still more detrimental to railroad\r\ninterests than that of Congress. He says;\r\n\r\n      \"In the second place, the legislatures of several States,\r\n      stimulated by the example of Congress, hastened to pass in\r\n      imitation, of the Interstate Commerce Act, laws which, in\r\n      many instances, went far beyond their model in point of\r\n      stringency. Examples are furnished by the statutes of Iowa,\r\n      Maryland, Minnesota and South Carolina in 1887-88; of\r\n      Florida in 1888-89, and of no less than thirteen States in\r\n      1889-90, viz.: Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts,\r\n      Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio,\r\n      Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Wyoming; as well as by\r\n      the recently adopted Constitution of Kentucky. The\r\n      legislation of 1890-91 shows a slight reaction against the\r\n      movement of the three years previous.\r\n\r\n      \"In two respects the State legislatures went quite beyond\r\n      the scope of the Interstate Commerce Act. They tried to\r\n      prescribe safety appliances to the operating department, and\r\n      rates to the traffic department. Of the first of these\r\n      groups little need be said, except that as a rule they have\r\n      failed to accomplish any great progress toward the result in\r\n      view, and have in some instances actually hindered such\r\n      progress. The attempt at prescribing rates was more serious.\r\n      It involved a return to the methods of the Granger\r\n      legislation, fifteen years earlier, which had operated so\r\n      disastrously upon the railroads and the public alike. The\r\n      system of commissioners with powers to make schedules which\r\n      should be at least _prima facie_ evidence of reasonable\r\n      rates had, during the intervening period, never been wholly\r\n      abandoned; but the powers thus conferred had been sparingly\r\n      exercised. It was either left unused, as was generally the\r\n      case in the North from 1877 to 1887, or the schedule rates\r\n      were put so high as not to interfere with good railroad\r\n      economy, of which examples are seen in Georgia and other\r\n      parts of the South. But from the year 1887 onward there was\r\n      a pressure upon the Commissioners to make schedules, and to\r\n      make them low; and lest these boards should not be able to\r\n      reflect the popular feeling directly enough, they were, in\r\n      some instances, no longer to be appointed by the Governor,\r\n      but elected by popular vote. The law which was most severely\r\n      applied and attracted most public attention was that of\r\n      Iowa.... The agitation against the railroads has many points\r\n      in common with the land agitation in Ireland. Absentee\r\n      ownership is at the bottom of the trouble in either case.\r\n      Property is owned in one place and used in another, and the\r\n      users, not satisfied with the conditions of use, insist on\r\n      taking the business direction into their own hands. They\r\n      claim the right to fix rates in Iowa for the same general\r\n      reasons by which they claim the right to fix rents in\r\n      Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be presumed that Mr. Hadley is ignorant of the fact that under\r\nthe Iowa Commissioners' tariff the gross earnings of the Iowa railroads\r\nincreased $7,000,000, or more than 17 per cent., in about three years,\r\nand their net revenue increased in proportion. Never have the railroads\r\nor the people of Iowa enjoyed a healthier prosperity than they do at\r\npresent. It is true that the State of Iowa denies to the railroad\r\ncompanies the right to charge what they please; but this claim does not\r\nprevent them from doing justice to the absentee owner of railroad\r\nproperty. That absentee owners of property are disposed to take undue\r\nadvantage of those who use it is illustrated in the very case which Mr.\r\nHadley cites. So flagrant was the injustice done by the English landlord\r\nto the Irish tenant that the English Parliament was constrained to\r\ninterfere and correct it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley says further:\r\n\r\n      \"It is seen in Iowa to-day, where, as a result of radical\r\n      legislation with regard to rates, railroad construction has\r\n      almost entirely ceased, the average for the years 1888-90\r\n      being less than fifty miles.\"\r\n\r\nNow Professor Hadley hails from the State of Connecticut, where\r\nrailroads are permitted to make their own tariffs and where legislators\r\nare supposed not to be hostile to them. According to Poor's Manual, that\r\nState had 1,004.02 miles of railroad in 1888, and just 2.52 miles more\r\nin 1891, while Iowa had 8,364 miles in 1888, 8,436 in 1891, and 8,505\r\nmiles on January 1, 1893. Will Mr. Hadley please explain why railroad\r\nconstruction has ceased in Connecticut? Iowa has one mile of railroad\r\nfor every 227 inhabitants, and Connecticut has one for every 741\r\ninhabitants, although the per capita valuation is $473 in the latter,\r\nand only $273 in the former State. Nor have other Eastern States done\r\nmuch better than Connecticut. During the three years 1888-1891 there\r\nwere built 74 miles of railroad in New Hampshire, 50 in Vermont, 23 in\r\nMassachusetts and 9 in Rhode Island. Iowa has an area of 56,000 square\r\nmiles and a population of 1,911,896, an assessed valuation of\r\n$520,000,000; New England has an area of 66,400 square miles, a\r\npopulation of 4,700,745, and an assessed valuation of $3,500,000,000.\r\nYet Iowa has 1,576 miles of railroad more than all the New England\r\nStates together. She has a railroad net as close as that of the Empire\r\nState, having one mile of road to about 6-1/2 miles of territory,\r\nalthough the population of that State is three times as dense as hers.\r\nNevertheless, railroad construction is at present active in Iowa,\r\nseveral lines of road are in the process of construction at the present\r\nwriting, and there is every indication of still greater activity in the\r\nnear future. The _Railway Age_ of March 17, 1893, in a detailed list of\r\nnew lines projected or under construction in the United States, gives\r\nfor Connecticut only 32 miles, while it gives for Iowa 930 miles.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley continues:\r\n\r\n      \"It is seen to some extent in the Northwest as a whole. At\r\n      the close of the year 1887 the States included by Henry V.\r\n      Poor in the Central, Northern and Northwestern groups had\r\n      25,040 miles of road, while those of the South Atlantic,\r\n      Gulf and Mississippi Valley had but 24,567. To-day this\r\n      relation is reversed: the Northwest has but 27,294 miles,\r\n      while the South has 30,696.\"\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Hadley taken the pains to look up the population of these groups\r\nhe would have found that the \"South\" is fully three times as populous as\r\nthe \"Northwest,\" and that therefore his figures prove nothing beyond the\r\nfact that at the present rate of gain the railroad facilities of the\r\nSouth will in a quarter of a century be equal to those of the Northwest\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nBut the argument is weak in another respect. The State in the Southern\r\ngroup that made by far the greatest gain in railroad mileage during the\r\nperiod mentioned by Mr. Hadley is Georgia, which gained about 1,000\r\nmiles in three years, yet that State prescribed rates for railroad\r\ncompanies six years before Iowa did, and has for many years exerted a\r\nmore thorough control over her railroads than perhaps any other State in\r\nthe Union. The smallest increase is in West Virginia, which during the\r\nperiod given gained an average of only 69 miles per annum; and yet in\r\nWest Virginia railroads charge their own rates and usually have their\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nFinally Prof. Hadley says:\r\n\r\n      \"Where are we to find the limit to such unwise action? The\r\n      United States Supreme Court can do something and has shown a\r\n      disposition to do something. In the Minnesota cases it\r\n      repudiated the doctrine of uncontrolled rights on the part\r\n      of the legislature to make rates, as emphatically as it\r\n      repudiated the doctrine of uncontrolled rights on the part\r\n      of agents of the corporation in the Granger cases, twelve\r\n      years before.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Mr. Hadley is as much mistaken in his interpretation\r\nof the decision of the court as he has been in his other assertions, as\r\nwill be seen from the following extract from Judge Blatchford's opinion\r\nin Budd vs. New York, in which he says, \"The main question involved is\r\nwhether this court will adhere to its decision in Munn vs. Illinois.\"\r\n\r\nThe court first quoted from the opinion of Judge Andrew of the Court of\r\nAppeals of New York, as follows: \"The opinion further said that the\r\ncriticism to which the case of Munn vs. Illinois had been subjected\r\nproceeded mainly upon a limited and strict construction and definition\r\nof the police power; that there was little reason, under our system of\r\ngovernment, for placing a close and narrow interpretation on the police\r\npower, or restricting its scope so as to hamper the legislative power in\r\ndealing with the varying necessities of society and the new\r\ncircumstances as they arise calling for legislative intervention in the\r\npublic interest; and that no serious invasion of constitutional\r\nguarantees by the legislature could withstand for a long time the\r\nsearching influence of public opinion, which was sure to come sooner or\r\nlater to the side of law, order and justice, however it might have been\r\nswayed for a time by passion or prejudice or whatever aberrations might\r\nhave marked its course.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Blatchford then said: \"We regard these views, which we have\r\nreferred to as announced by the Court of Appeals of New York, so far as\r\nthey support the validity of the statute in question, as sound and\r\njust.... We must regard the principle maintained in Munn vs. Illinois as\r\nfirmly established.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Horace Porter has made a contribution to the railway rate\r\nliterature by an article which appeared in the December, 1891, number\r\nof the _North American Review_. Unfortunately many of the General's\r\nstatements are either false or misleading. Thus, in a table which he\r\npresents for the purpose of comparing the passenger rates of Europe with\r\nthose of the United States, he gives the regular first-class schedule\r\nrates for the United Kingdom, France and Germany and the average\r\nearnings per passenger per mile for this country. That this is an unfair\r\ncomparison needs no further argument, especially when it is remembered\r\nthat in Europe from 85 to 90 per cent, of all passengers are carried in\r\nthe third class at a regular rate averaging about 1-1/2 cents per mile,\r\nand that considerable reductions are made for excursion, commutation and\r\nreturn tickets.\r\n\r\nBut General Porter says concerning American rates:\r\n\r\n      \"When we take into consideration the excursion and the\r\n      commutation rates, we find first-class passengers carried as\r\n      low as half a cent a mile.\"\r\n\r\nNow the question arises whether American railway companies carry\r\npassengers at such rates with or without loss to themselves. If they are\r\ncarried at a loss, an injustice is done to the regular passengers, whose\r\nfare must not only make up the loss, but yield a larger profit than\r\nwould otherwise be necessary. If, on the other hand, a rate of half a\r\ncent a mile can be made remunerative, there is certainly no justice in\r\nmaintaining rates five and six times as large on well-patronized lines.\r\nGeneral Porter places stress upon our superior accommodations in the way\r\nof lighting, ventilation, ice-water, lavatories, and free carriage of\r\nbaggage, etc., and then adds:\r\n\r\n      \"In this connection we must also recollect that the cost of\r\n      fuel, wages and all construction materials is considerably\r\n      higher here than in Europe, while the population from which\r\n      the railways derive their support is much more sparse; the\r\n      United States having 166,000 miles of railway with a\r\n      population of 63,000,000, while Europe has only 135,000\r\n      miles with a population of 335,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nWe grant the point which the General makes on ventilation, ice-water,\r\netc.; but, to make the comparison a fair one, he should also have\r\nreferred to the much greater cost of European roads, to their much\r\ngreater number of employes per mile, to the much shorter haul, to the\r\nhigher price of their fuel, to the superiority of their roadbed and the\r\ngreater security of their passengers. Moreover, whether the railroads of\r\na country are profitable or not cannot be ascertained by merely\r\ncomparing miles of road with square miles of territory and number of\r\ninhabitants. British India has a population of 275,000,000 and only\r\nabout 16,000 miles of railroad, and yet her roads are scarcely as\r\nprofitable as our own. China has 3,000,000 and Asia has about 4,000,000\r\npeople to every mile of railroad, but so far their railroads have proved\r\nno bonanza. The question is not how many people there are to each mile\r\nof railroad, but rather to what extent the railroad is used by the\r\npeople. The amount of freight carried annually by the railways of the\r\nUnited States is about 680,000,000 tons, or 85,000,000,000 ton miles,\r\nand the number of passengers carried is about 535,000,000, representing\r\nan aggregate of travel of nearly 13,000,000,000 miles. This shows an\r\naverage of 1,300 tons of freight carried one mile, and 200 miles\r\ntraveled annually for each inhabitant of the nation, and a greater use\r\nof railway facilities than that of any other country in the world. The\r\nincome of the railroads per capita is $17 in the United States, $11 in\r\nthe United Kingdom, $5 in Germany, $4 in France, and still less in\r\nItaly, Austria and Russia. The average freight haul is 63 miles in\r\nEurope and 120 miles in the United States; the average passenger haul 15\r\nmiles in Europe and 24 miles in the United States. It has already been\r\nshown that the average earnings per train mile are also larger here than\r\nthere. Röll's Encyclopedia of Railroads for 1892 shows that in France\r\nthe average rate for all traffic for the year 1888 was for passengers\r\n1.45 cents per mile, and for freight 1.14 cents per ton per kilometer,\r\nand that the nation had also received by way of free or reduced rates on\r\nGovernment business during that year benefits to the amount of\r\n$59,000,000. Large reductions have been made during the past year in\r\npassenger rates.\r\n\r\nThe General indulges in making the stereotyped railroad charge that \"the\r\nlegislatures of several of the States have enacted laws to effect a\r\nreduction of rates, the literal obedience to some of which would amount\r\nto the practical confiscation of railway property.\"\r\n\r\nThe General or any of his friends cannot name a road that was ever\r\nconfiscated by legislation, or even seriously injured. It is a fact that\r\nthe very legislation of which railroad managers so bitterly complain has\r\nhad a beneficial influence on railroad earnings. Thus, in Iowa, where,\r\naccording to the testimony of railroad men, Grangerism has reigned\r\nsupreme during the past few years, railroad earnings increased between\r\n1889 and 1892 from $37,000,000 to $44,000,000, or more than 18 per cent.\r\nStill better results could have been secured if the railroad managers\r\nhad been in sympathy with the law. There is no doubt that they would\r\ngladly suffer, or rather have their companies suffer, a loss of revenue,\r\nif this would lead to a repeal of the laws and restore to them the power\r\nto manipulate rates for their own purposes.\r\n\r\nBut the General comes to the main point of his article when he\r\ncomplains against \"the unreasonable requirements and restrictions of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law.\" He says:\r\n\r\n      \"Principal among these are what is known as the 'long and\r\n      short haul clause,' which prohibits railway companies from\r\n      receiving any greater compensation in the aggregate for a\r\n      shorter than for a longer haul over the same line in the\r\n      same direction, the shorter being included within the longer\r\n      distance; and the anti-pooling clause, which prevents\r\n      railway companies from entering into any agreement with each\r\n      other for an apportionment of joint earnings.\"\r\n\r\nIf we carefully examine the railroad literature of the last four years,\r\nwe find that it has concentrated its efforts toward the creation of\r\npublic sentiment in favor of the repeal of these two clauses of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law. Railroad men are well aware of the fact that,\r\nwith these two clauses stricken out, the Interstate Commerce Law would\r\nbe practically valueless, and in clamoring for their repeal they evince\r\na persistency worthy of a better cause. The practices which these\r\nclauses aim to prohibit cannot be defended upon any consideration of\r\njustice and equity, and it is folly to expect the American people to\r\nsacrifice their convictions of right to the selfish interest of a\r\ncomparatively small number of persons interested in the manipulation of\r\nrailroad stocks.\r\n\r\nThe July, 1891, number of the _Forum_ contains an article on the\r\noperation of the Interstate Commerce Law from the pen of Aldace F.\r\nWalker, formerly a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and now\r\ncommissioner of the Western Traffic Association. Mr. Walker evidently\r\nbelongs to the old school of railroad men, who have not yet accepted the\r\nGranger decision. Referring to it, he says:\r\n\r\n      \"This decision was not unanimous, and the reasoning\r\n      presented was not so convincing as to command universal\r\n      acceptance. It was at once challenged by the corporations,\r\n      and has been from time to time attacked in the same\r\n      tribunal; it has not yet been withdrawn, but it has been\r\n      materially modified, notably in a case from Minnesota,\r\n      decided in 1890, when it was established that there is a\r\n      limit beyond which the State cannot go in reducing railway\r\n      rates, which limit would be passed in case a State should\r\n      attempt to deprive a corporation of its property, without\r\n      due process of law, by fixing rates too low to permit of a\r\n      fair remuneration for its use. A large debatable ground yet\r\n      remains open, with a possibility that the position of the\r\n      railway in Federal jurisprudence may eventually be radically\r\n      modified.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage quoted clearly indicates that railroad men expect better\r\nthings of the court in the future, but Mr. Walker is much mistaken in\r\nsupposing the court materially modified the Granger decision, as will be\r\nseen by referring to the case of Budd vs. the State of New York, decided\r\nin February, 1892, by the same court.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker, unlike Mr. Depew, candidly admits the former universality of\r\nthe evil of discrimination. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"In order to secure traffic, a railway official felt called\r\n      upon to underbid his rival. He gave the shipper a private\r\n      rate, a rebate, a free pass--anything in the shape of a\r\n      concession or a favor. The land was honeycombed with special\r\n      arrangements of innumerable forms, all secret, because\r\n      otherwise they would have been useless, and all forced upon\r\n      the carriers by the exigencies of unbridled competition.\r\n      Many shippers became wealthy from such gains. Others were\r\n      envious of like success. At last the public sense of justice\r\n      demanded a reform.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Walker's candor rises to a still higher pitch when he admits\r\nthat the ingenuity of railroad managers has found ways to evade the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law. The following passage from the Commissioner's\r\narticle will, no doubt, be a great surprise to such law-abiding and\r\nconfiding managers as Mr. Depew:\r\n\r\n      \"There was nothing in the law specifically forbidding the\r\n      payment of 'commissions,' and it was found that the routing\r\n      of business might be secured by a slight expenditure of that\r\n      nature to a shipper's friend. Other kindred devices were\r\n      suggested, some new, some old; the payment of rent, clerk\r\n      hire, dock charges, elevator fees, drayage, the allowance of\r\n      exaggerated claims, free transportation within some single\r\n      State--a hundred ingenious forms of evading the plain\r\n      requirements of the law were said to be in use. The\r\n      demoralization was not by any means confined to the minor\r\n      roads. Shippers were ready to give information to other\r\n      lines concerning concessions which were offered them, and to\r\n      state the sum required to control their patronage. A freight\r\n      agent, thus appealed to, at first perhaps might let the\r\n      business go, but when the matter became more serious and he\r\n      saw one large shipper after another seeking a less desirable\r\n      route, he was very apt to throw up his hands and fall in\r\n      with the procession.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walker is very severe on the Interstate Commerce Act, which, he\r\nsays, might in its present form \"well be entitled, 'An act to promote\r\nrailway bankruptcies and consolidations by driving weak roads out of\r\ncompetitive business.'\" To remedy the evil which, in his opinion, the\r\nact causes, he favors the granting of differentials by the stronger to\r\nthe weaker roads. Such a device is simply a species of pool under a less\r\noffensive name. Its manifest object is to maintain rates through a\r\nconspiracy of rival railroads. Mr. Walker admits this when he says:\r\n\r\n      \"It operates in practice to affect a distribution of the\r\n      traffic somewhat roughly, giving rise to frequent\r\n      dissensions and bickerings over the 'differentials' which\r\n      are allowed; but after all it has enabled the trunk lines\r\n      usually to secure a better maintenance of tariff rates and a\r\n      better observance of the provisions of the law against\r\n      private rebates and discriminations than has been\r\n      attainable in other sections of the country where different\r\n      conditions make such an arrangement impracticable. It\r\n      vividly illustrates, however, the necessity of some plan by\r\n      which common business may be divided.\"\r\n\r\nThis problem, which apparently causes so much perplexity to railroad\r\nmanagers, would soon be solved if railroad abuses were done away with.\r\nSo long as these abuses exist and rates are maintained by artificial\r\nmeans there will be bickering and strife for business which legitimately\r\nbelongs to others. Mr. Walker then bewails the proscription of the pool,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n      \"It may be stated without fear of contradiction that if the\r\n      carriers had been left free to make arrangements among\r\n      themselves upon which each line might rely for eventually\r\n      receiving in some form a fair share of competitive traffic,\r\n      the temptation for secret rate-cutting would have been in\r\n      great measure removed and the country would have been spared\r\n      most of the traffic disturbances and illegitimate\r\n      contrivances for buying business which have since been\r\n      periodically rife.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument amounts to this, that, rather than place a law upon our\r\nstatute books which reckless railroad managers might be strongly tempted\r\nto violate, they should be permitted to combine and control the highways\r\nand levy _ad libitum_ upon the commerce of the country. It is a most\r\npreposterous proposition.\r\n\r\nThe article especially condemns the long and short haul clause of the\r\nlaw. That this clause is injurious to the commerce of the country is,\r\nhowever, not obvious from his reasoning. Mr. Walker makes the statement\r\nthat this clause of the law \"has removed from many jobbing centers\r\nimportant advantages which they previously had, and has enabled interior\r\ncommunities, formerly of little apparent consequence, to deal directly\r\nwith distant markets.\" If he means by this that this feature of the law\r\nhas equalized shipping throughout the country, he is doubtless right. If\r\nhe wishes us to infer, however, that it prevents the railroad companies\r\nfrom doing substantial justice to all, he presumes altogether too much\r\nupon the credulity of his readers.\r\n\r\nAnother article from the same author appeared under the title\r\n\"Unregulated Competition Self-destructive,\" in the December, 1891,\r\nnumber of the same periodical. He commences his article with an inquiry\r\ninto the pedigree and merit of the time-honored proverb, \"Competition is\r\nthe life of trade,\" and arrives at the conclusion that the phrase is\r\nfatherless and insignificant. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"'Competition is the life of trade;' 'Competition is the\r\n      death of trade;' one phrase is as true as the other. For all\r\n      that appears, it was a toss-up which of the two should\r\n      become current as the expression of the general thought.\"\r\n\r\nIt is its general recognition that gives a truth a proverb's currency.\r\nMr. Walker sneers at a disagreeable proverb because, like the majority\r\nof his colleagues, he holds the masses in contempt. He gives his\r\nestimate of popular intelligence in the following words:\r\n\r\n      \"Unfortunately most men do not think worthily, or do not\r\n      think at all; they are ruled by phrases, and they catch the\r\n      crude ideas of others as they fly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walker's whole argument is one in favor of the legalization of the\r\npool, though he carefully avoids the word which grates so harshly on the\r\nAmerican ear. He makes the broad statement, without offering the least\r\nproof in support of it, that measures have been everywhere adopted \"to\r\nsubdue and ameliorate the evil results of inordinate and excessive\r\ncompetitive strife,\" and then he asks:\r\n\r\n      \"Has not the time come for a reversal of the legislative\r\n      attitude? Would it not be well for Congress, State\r\n      legislatures and the judiciary to cease their futile\r\n      attempts to maintain unqualified freedom of competition, and\r\n      substitute therefore a recognition of the right of every\r\n      industry to combine under proper supervision, and to make\r\n      agreements for the maintenance of just and reasonable\r\n      prices, the prevention of the enormous wastage consequent\r\n      upon warlike conditions, and the preservation of existing\r\n      institutions through the years to come?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walker then proceeds to make the bold prediction that revolution and\r\nanarchy will follow if the demands of the railroad corporations are not\r\ncomplied with, saying:\r\n\r\n      \"Unless this course is adopted a social convulsion may\r\n      fairly be apprehended, forced by the universal and necessary\r\n      repudiation of existing laws and rules of decision, and by\r\n      the general formation of combinations without their pale.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a strange threat indeed, and unworthy of a man who has held as\r\ngreat a public trust as Mr. Walker has. The article also contains the\r\nstatement that combinations do not extinguish competition. \"They\r\nregulate it,\" says Mr. Walker, \"with more or less efficiency, and they\r\noften go so far as to suspend its operation in respect to one or more\r\nimportant features of the strife; for example, the price paid or the\r\ntime consumed. But as long as the employer or the purchaser has a\r\nchoice, so long there is competition.\" Here is a sample of Mr. Walker's\r\nirony, for the choice which the shipper has under the pool is simply\r\nHobson's choice.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker has also an article in the August, 1892, number of the\r\n_Forum_, the substance of which is to show that organizations among\r\nrailroad companies, like the Western Traffic Association, are necessary\r\nfor the purpose of restraining competition among them. He holds that\r\nsuch competition as exists in almost all other lines of business \"is\r\nradically vicious to all interests, however pleasant and desirable it\r\nmay seem to self-styled anti-monopolists,\" and that \"it is a calamity\r\nnot only to the owners of the roads, but to the public also.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to his statement, the Traffic Association is simply a little\r\ninnocent and inoffensive organization whose duty it is only to maintain\r\nrates, and he sees nothing wrong in allowing a few representatives of\r\ncorporations to meet in secret and discuss, scheme and levy such a tax\r\nupon the commerce of this country as may suit their convenience; and he\r\nregrets that their attempts are \"hampered by legislation which forbids\r\nthe formation of pools.\" In other words, he proposes to have the case in\r\ncourt decided by a jury made up entirely of the parties at interest in\r\nthe case. This piece of effrontery is about on a par with the average\r\nargument of this class of pleaders.\r\n\r\nSuppose we apply the same rule to other classes. Take the farmers, for\r\ninstance. Let them have an organization for the purpose of maintaining\r\nrates, with their representatives meeting in secret and fixing the price\r\nof their produce and asking the Government to enforce their orders,\r\npools and edicts, so as to afford them relief from selling corn at ten\r\ncents per bushel, beef and pork at a dollar and a half per hundred, and\r\nhay at two dollars per ton, and their other produce at proportionate\r\nrates. Who would condemn such an organization more severely than the\r\nadvocates of the Traffic Association? They never find terms sufficiently\r\nexpressive with which to condemn the Farmers' Alliance and other kindred\r\nassociations, which are organized solely for the purpose of lawfully\r\ncorrecting existing abuses and of forming a wholesome public sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that some progress is being made upon this question, as\r\nMr. Walker admits that \"the fortunes which have been made are seen to\r\nhave been the result of dealings in stocks and in titles, the\r\nconsequences of which, if involving wrong, are rightly charged against\r\nthe lax legislation which has made such operations possible.\" \"Every\r\nperson seeking for the services of a common carrier is entitled to know\r\nthat he is charged no more than his neighbor who obtains the same\r\nservice under the same conditions.\" \"The theory that any unjust\r\ndiscrimination or unjust preference or advantage in respect to\r\nindividuals, communities or descriptions of traffic must be suppressed\r\nby the State, has become firmly lodged in legislation.\" This improvement\r\nin the sentiment of railroad men is gratifying.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, as has already been stated, was for several years a\r\nmember of the Interstate Commerce Commission, a board created by\r\nCongress for the special purpose of enforcing the law which he so\r\nunreservedly condemns. No doubt Mr. Walker performed the duties of his\r\noffice as he understood them; but if he held then the views which he\r\nholds now, his work must have been a hindrance rather than a help to the\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nAmong financial journals, so many of which are devoted to the support of\r\nvicious and demoralizing methods, and are ever ready to defend whatever\r\nis bad in corporation management, it is refreshing to find occasionally\r\none that exposes abuses and favors the earning of legitimate dividends,\r\nand it is a pleasure to quote the following from the June number, 1892,\r\nof the _Banker's Magazine_:\r\n\r\n      \"There are two widely differing theories concerning the\r\n      management of railroads in this country; one theory is that\r\n      profits should be acquired from fluctuations in the stock,\r\n      and the other is that the profits should be acquired in the\r\n      old-fashioned way, by performing a useful service and\r\n      receiving a reward therefor, to be divided among the\r\n      stockholders in the way of a dividend. These two theories\r\n      are so different in their practical operation that they give\r\n      rise to the most diverse consequences. Of course, many\r\n      railroads are not dividend-earning, and with these the\r\n      profits to the managers and those who are allied with them\r\n      must come from stock fluctuations and from whatever sucking\r\n      arrangements can be devised whereby their vitality or\r\n      sustenance can be acquired by the favored few who are in\r\n      control. Unfortunately, there are many railroads in this\r\n      condition, the history of which is too well known to require\r\n      description. Once in control, the way is easy to retain it\r\n      and to make money by a thousand devices which ingenious and\r\n      unscrupulous managers are constantly planning and putting\r\n      into operation.\r\n\r\n      \"The consequences of the other theory are as different, both\r\n      to the corporate property and to the public, as can be\r\n      imagined. When a railroad is properly managed and earning\r\n      dividends, a policy of development is adopted, having for\r\n      its end the natural expansion of the property in harmony\r\n      with the growth of the country, the needs of business and\r\n      the desires of the people. The fruits of such a policy may\r\n      not be apparent at once, but they inevitably come, and, when\r\n      they are reaped, are enjoyed and appreciated by all. Only by\r\n      such a policy can our roads ever become great, commanding\r\n      the confidence of the people, and fulfilling their highest\r\n      uses; in short, only by such a policy can a railroad be\r\n      brought to a high degree of perfection.\r\n\r\n      \"The difference is clearly seen by contrasting a road of\r\n      this character with one that is run by the Wall Street\r\n      method for stock-jobbing purposes. By this method dividends\r\n      are not regarded as of so much consequence to investors as\r\n      an instrument or argument for affecting the value of the\r\n      stock. In other words, if a dividend is earned and paid at\r\n      all, it is chiefly as an instrument or agency for\r\n      stock-jobbing purposes, and not because the road is managed\r\n      primarily for this purpose. Furthermore, dividends, too\r\n      often, are disregarded altogether, as well as any policy of\r\n      permanent improvement or of general development. The\r\n      cardinal idea always is, how can the road be maintained and\r\n      manipulated so as to cause the largest variations in the\r\n      stock and the most money for the managers?\r\n\r\n      \"Too many managers, as is well known, have made great sums\r\n      for themselves and built additions long in advance of their\r\n      means, and have seriously crippled their corporations by so\r\n      doing. But they have made fortunes for themselves. What the\r\n      great majority of mankind consider is the immediate present,\r\n      and not the future.\r\n\r\n      \"It is undoubtedly a hard thing for those who are conducting\r\n      their corporations in an honest and able manner, for the\r\n      benefit of their owners, to keep still while their enemies\r\n      are pounding them and glorifying those who are managing\r\n      their corporations for personal and corrupt ends; but all\r\n      cheap and false practices must finally lead to disaster. We\r\n      hear a great deal of this kind of thing nowadays. One of the\r\n      evil effects of speculation and newspaper reading is, that\r\n      people have got in the way of not thinking much for\r\n      themselves; of regarding as truth whatever is printed, and\r\n      of not opening their eyes wide enough to discover the\r\n      shallowness of the reasonings and falsehoods that are put\r\n      forth at the behests of speculators, or of those who are\r\n      managing corporations for speculative purposes. The American\r\n      people have had an amazing experience in losses from\r\n      following advice thus plentifully and freely given;\r\n      nevertheless, there seem to be persons left who are willing\r\n      to listen and fall into the old ways and be trapped, as so\r\n      many others have been in the past. There is a considerable\r\n      class, having means and nothing to do, who perhaps might\r\n      just as well lose their money in poker, railroad or grain\r\n      speculation as in any other way, for this furnishes about\r\n      the only source of amusement to them; but, after all, there\r\n      is no reason why railroads should be managed so exclusively\r\n      for the amusement of this class. The time is coming, and\r\n      probably is not far off, when they will get enough of it;\r\n      and railroad investors will conclude that dividends for\r\n      themselves are better than profits for speculators; and when\r\n      they do, all stock-jobbing managers will be consigned to the\r\n      limbo which is their proper destination.\"\r\n\r\nThis magazine is edited by Mr. Albert S. Bolles, author of several\r\nexcellent financial works. We are much indebted to him for the sound\r\nbanking system which we now have, and which has contributed so largely\r\nto the unexampled prosperity which this country has enjoyed for the last\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\nOur national banking system illustrates well how service able the\r\ncorporation may be to a people when its use is restricted by wholesome\r\nlaws to the performance of its proper functions.\r\n\r\nThe old United States Bank was organized for practically the same\r\npurposes as our present national banks, but for lack of proper\r\nrestrictions its use was soon perverted to ignoble purposes. The bank\r\nmanagers showed so much partiality in the distribution of their favors\r\nand accommodations, and meddled in politics to such an extent, that the\r\npeople became disgusted with it, and a renewal of its charter was\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay clearly saw how dangerous a great money power might become to\r\nour country, and, in opposing the extension of the bank's charter, said:\r\n\r\n      \"The power to charter companies is one of the most exalted\r\n      attributes of sovereignty. In the exercise of this gigantic\r\n      power we have seen an East India Company created, which is\r\n      in itself a sovereignty, which has subverted empires and set\r\n      up new dynasties, and has not only made war, but war against\r\n      its legitimate sovereign! Under the influence of this power\r\n      we have seen rise a South Sea Company, and a Mississippi\r\n      Company, that distracted and convulsed all Europe, and\r\n      menaced a total overthrow of all credit and confidence, and\r\n      universal bankruptcy.\"\r\n\r\nCan we afford to ignore the lessons of history?\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Clews makes some spicy and pertinent observations on railroad\r\nmen's methods in an article which recently appeared in the _Railway\r\nAge_. Mr. Clews seems to have but little confidence in the average\r\nrailroad director. He advises stockholders to exercise constant\r\nvigilance and defensive conservatism, \"lest they become the instruments\r\nby which unscrupulous and crafty directors work out schemes that are in\r\nreality nothing but frauds or robbery.\" And then he adds:\r\n\r\n      \"In estimating corporate acts we must never forget that,\r\n      while the best of men will bear watching as to their\r\n      individual dealings with others, they need to be doubly\r\n      watched when they sit around a corporation board and vote as\r\n      to transactions in respect of which none of them can be\r\n      called to personal account. Temptations attack with enormous\r\n      force when the gains are prospectively great and the risk of\r\n      penalty inappreciable or non-existent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clews also tells us how roads are wrecked by their boards of\r\ndirectors. \"In one case,\" he says, \"the stock of a leading railway,\r\nwhich in 1880 sold at 174, in 1884 sold at 22-1/2, and in 1885 at 22.\r\nThis vast shrinkage of value was not owing to panic or to stringency of\r\nmoney, nor did it arise from a diminution of traffic on the original\r\nline; but it was because consolidation had been pushed to an extreme by\r\nthe directors of the corporation, so much so that the entire system\r\nyielded no dividends; a fleet and useful animal had been loaded down\r\nwith dead wood and rubbish till he could scarcely crawl; barren acres\r\nhad been added to an originally fruitful farm until the whole estate\r\ncould hardly pay taxes; a mass of rotten apples had been thrown into the\r\nmeasure with sound fruit, and buyers refused the whole as a mere heap\r\nof corruption. And it was generally believed that the men who\r\nperpetrated this mischief under the names of 'construction,' 'requisite\r\nconsolidation,' 'absorption of necessary branches,' etc., had made a\r\ngreat deal of money by it and had not made it honestly. But it was all\r\ndone pursuant to legal forms and by boards of directors, so that the\r\ndefrauded stockholders were without remedy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clews then gives us a more detailed account of the way in which\r\nbranch roads are built and absorbed, viz.:\r\n\r\n      \"Given a useful, well constructed, dividend-paying road, a\r\n      body of people with some capital and political influence,\r\n      aided by some of the directors of this prosperous line;\r\n      construct a branch road to some outside point; the more\r\n      important such point the better, but that is of small\r\n      consequence. The road gets itself built; it is bonded for\r\n      more than it cost, and it cost twice as much as it ought,\r\n      since the constructors were all together in the ring and\r\n      have favored each other. Then the capital stock is fixed at\r\n      so much, and this is mostly distributed among the\r\n      constructors. The road then, swelled to a fictitious price\r\n      of three or four to one, and not worth anything to start\r\n      with, is ripe for absorption and consolidation. Its\r\n      directors and those of the main line meet, confer and vote\r\n      the measure through. They all profit by it, more or less,\r\n      but their profits are enormously in excess of the trifling\r\n      losses due to the shrinkage of values of the shares of the\r\n      main line. A director of the main line may perhaps lose\r\n      $20,000 on a thousand shares, but what is this when compared\r\n      to a gain of hundreds of thousands in his holdings of the\r\n      branch road, whose liabilities are assumed by his victimized\r\n      corporation? And such a director would not be equal to the\r\n      demands of his covetousness if he had not sold thousands of\r\n      shares short, in anticipation of the fall which the\r\n      transactions of himself and his associates were inevitably\r\n      bound to produce.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clews concludes his article with the following passage:\r\n\r\n      \"The profits realized on the speculative constructions are\r\n      enormous and have constituted the chief source of the\r\n      phenomenal fortunes piled up by our railroad millionaires\r\n      within the last twenty years. It is no exaggeration to\r\n      characterize these transactions as direct frauds upon the\r\n      public. They may not be such in a sense recognized by the\r\n      law, for legislation has strangely neglected to provide\r\n      against their perpetration; but morally they are nothing\r\n      less, for they are essentially deceptive and unjust, and\r\n      involve an oppressive taxation of the public at large for\r\n      the benefit of a few individuals who have given no\r\n      equivalent for what they get. The result of this system is\r\n      that, on the average, the railroads of the country are\r\n      capitalized at probably fully 50 per cent. in excess of\r\n      their actual cost. The managers of the roads claim the right\r\n      to earn dividends upon this fictitious capital, and it is\r\n      their constant effort to accomplish that object. So far as\r\n      they succeed they exercise an utterly unjust taxation upon\r\n      the public by exacting a compensation in excess of a fair\r\n      return upon the capital actually invested. This unjust\r\n      exaction amounts to a direct charge and burden on the trade\r\n      of the country which limits the ability of the American\r\n      producer and merchant to compete with those of foreign\r\n      nations and checks the development of our vast natural\r\n      resources. In a country of 'magnificent distances' like ours\r\n      the cost of transportation is one of the foremost factors\r\n      affecting the capacity for progress; and the artificial\r\n      enhancement of freight and passenger rates due to this false\r\n      capitalization has been a far more serious bar to our\r\n      material development than public opinion has yet realized.\r\n      The hundreds of millions of wealth so suddenly accumulated\r\n      by our railroad monarchs is the measure of this iniquitous\r\n      taxation, this perverted distribution of wealth. This\r\n      creation of a powerful aristocracy of wealth, which\r\n      originated in a diseased system of finance, must ultimately\r\n      become a source of very serious social and political\r\n      disorder. The descendants of the mushroom millionaires of\r\n      the present generation will consolidate into a broad and\r\n      almost omnipotent money power, whose sympathies and\r\n      influence will conflict with our political institutions at\r\n      every point of contact. They will exercise a vast control\r\n      over the larger organizations and movements of capital;\r\n      monopolies will seek protection under their wing, and by the\r\n      ascendancy which wealth always confers they will steadily\r\n      broaden their grasp upon the legislation, the banking and\r\n      commerce of the nation.\"\r\n\r\nThese are strong words, but they come from a man whose thirty years'\r\nexperience in Wall Street enables him to speak intelligently upon this\r\nsubject and who certainly cannot be accused of being prejudiced against\r\nrailroad men or corporate investments. In a recent number of his _Weekly\r\nFinancial Review_ Mr. Clews said of the railroad stock market:\r\n\r\n      \"Judgment passes for little in estimating the future of many\r\n      securities, for the market is almost wholly under the\r\n      control of comparatively few persons, whose operations must\r\n      inevitably influence the value of thousands of millions of\r\n      stocks and bonds. Never in the history of Wall Street was\r\n      the value of such an enormous aggregation of securities so\r\n      absolutely under the control of so small a circle as at this\r\n      time. Such a state of affairs cannot be considered\r\n      satisfactory; hence not only is speculation likely to be\r\n      unhealthily stimulated, but the future of these combinations\r\n      gives birth to a variety of uncertainties which, while they\r\n      may elevate prices, will certainly not add to their\r\n      stability.\"\r\n\r\nIf the silly claim of railroad men, that Western people do not invest in\r\nrailroad securities on account of their unprofitableness, needed any\r\nanswer, the above words would furnish it.\r\n\r\nThe May, 1893, number of the _North American Review_ contains an article\r\nentitled \"A Railway Party in Politics,\" by Mr. H. P. Robinson, editor of\r\nthe _Railway Age_. Mr. Robinson belongs to that class of reformers who\r\ncan see but one side of a question, and only a short-sighted view of\r\nthat. He is as zealous as a new convert, and is expert, in the ward\r\npolitician's way, in defense of the worst abuses practiced by railway\r\nmen. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"That the right to 'regulate' the railways, which is vested\r\n      in the State, has now been carried in the West to a point\r\n      not only beyond the bounds of justice, but beyond its\r\n      constitutional limits, and that it would soon be impossible\r\n      for any railway company in the West to keep out of\r\n      bankruptcy unless some vigorous and concerted action were\r\n      taken to arouse public opinion, and to compel a modification\r\n      of the present policy.\r\n\r\n      \"It is easy to see how much strength such a party, if\r\n      formed, would possess. According to the reports of the\r\n      Interstate Commerce Commission there were in the immediate\r\n      employ of the railways of the United States a year and a\r\n      half ago 749,301 men, all or nearly all voters, which number\r\n      has now, it may be assumed, been increased to about 800,000.\r\n      There are, in addition, about one million and a quarter\r\n      shareholders in the railway properties of the country; and\r\n      in other trades and industries immediately dependent upon\r\n      the railways for their support there are estimated to be\r\n      engaged, as principals or employes, over one million voters\r\n      more. These three classes united would give at once a massed\r\n      voting strength of some three millions of voters. There are\r\n      also, in the smaller towns especially, and at points where\r\n      railway shops are located, all over the country, a number of\r\n      persons, small tradesmen, boarding-house keepers, etc., who\r\n      are dependent for their livelihood on the patronage of\r\n      railway employes, and whose vote could unquestionably be\r\n      cast in harmony with any concerted employes' movement.\r\n      Moreover, unlike most new parties, this party would be at no\r\n      loss for the sinews of war or for the means of organization.\r\n      The men whom it would include form even now almost a\r\n      disciplined army. With them co-operation is already a habit.\r\n      While the financial backing and the commercial and physical\r\n      strength of which the party would find itself possessed from\r\n      its birth would be practically unlimited....\r\n\r\n      \"For the present it seems to them better to believe that the\r\n      people--those people who are not railway men--are acting now\r\n      only in ignorance, and that as soon as they see the truth\r\n      they will, by their own instinctive sense of justice,\r\n      re-mould their opinions and their policy without political\r\n      coercion.\r\n\r\n      \"At the same time there has already come into existence in\r\n      some of the Western States a movement which has its\r\n      significance and its practical influence. This is what is\r\n      called the Railway Employes' Club movement. It started in\r\n      Minnesota, at a small meeting of railway employes held in\r\n      Minneapolis in 1888. From that meeting the movement grew,\r\n      and made a certain feeble effort, not entirely unsuccessful,\r\n      to influence the State election in the fall of that year. By\r\n      the State election of 1890 the movement had grown and was\r\n      better organized, and the Employes' Club did exercise\r\n      considerable influence in the election of certain of the\r\n      State officers and certain members of the State legislature\r\n      in that year.\r\n\r\n      \"From Minnesota the movement spread to Iowa, and there is no\r\n      contradiction of the fact that the railway employes' vote\r\n      was one of the strongest forces in the State election of the\r\n      fall of 1891. It also overflowed into Kansas, Nebraska,\r\n      Missouri and Texas. Had the election of last November been\r\n      normal it is probable that the effect of the Railway\r\n      Employes' Club vote would have been as visible in two or\r\n      three of those States then as it had been in Iowa in the\r\n      preceding year. But in the deluge which occurred all trace\r\n      of the smaller streams and currents was obliterated. Had the\r\n      members of the clubs not taken the precaution to do\r\n      considerable work in the local nominating conventions of\r\n      both parties they would be compelled to confess that their\r\n      campaign of 1892 was a failure....\r\n\r\n      \"So far the clubs have admitted and will admit of no\r\n      negotiations with the State committees of other parties.\r\n      They hold their own meetings and decide for themselves that\r\n      such and such a candidate is inimical to their interests as\r\n      railway employes, and such and such a man is their friend.\r\n      Then they go to the polls and vote--voting in the main\r\n      their normal party ticket, scratching only a man here and a\r\n      man there, their attention being chiefly centered upon\r\n      members of the boards of railroad commissioners and of the\r\n      State legislatures.\r\n\r\n      \"In Minnesota in 1890 their weight was thrown chiefly in\r\n      favor of Republicans. In Iowa in 1891 it was given to\r\n      Democrats. In all States the men whom they oppose are those\r\n      who have made themselves conspicuous as 'Granger' and\r\n      anti-railway politicians. The keynote of the movement and\r\n      the one plank in the platform of the clubs is that the\r\n      extreme anti-railroad legislation of late years has reduced\r\n      the earnings of the companies to a point at which they are\r\n      unable any longer to keep full forces on their payrolls or\r\n      to pay such wages as they should, and that by this\r\n      legislation the railway employes are necessarily the\r\n      immediate sufferers....\r\n\r\n      \"A railway party is therefore already in existence.... And\r\n      moreover, though accidentally only, it is working forcibly\r\n      in behalf of railway interests as a whole....\r\n\r\n      \"Meanwhile Mr. A. F. Walker, the chairman of the Joint\r\n      Committee of the Trunk Line and Central Traffic\r\n      Associations, prophesies that if things go on as they are\r\n      going now, before long 'the managers of the railways will be\r\n      chiefly receivers.' In the year 1891 receivers were\r\n      appointed for twenty-six companies in the United States,\r\n      representing $84,479,000 of capital, and twenty-one\r\n      companies, with 3,223 miles of road, with a capitalization\r\n      of $186,000,000, were sold under foreclosure.\r\n\r\n      \"It is doubtful whether the result which Mr. Walker\r\n      foretells would be regarded as a calamity by the 'uninformed\r\n      public opinion of the West.' That Minnesota railroad\r\n      commissioner was quite sure of the public applause before he\r\n      made his classic declaration that he proposed to 'shake the\r\n      railroads over hell' before he had done with them, and the\r\n      Governor of Iowa, who announced that he did not care if\r\n      'every d--d railroad in the State went into bankruptcy'\r\n      before the expiration of his term of office, knew that the\r\n      sentiment would have the sympathies of his constituents.\r\n      This attitude of the Western mind is, of course, largely\r\n      explained by the fact that the people of the West do not as\r\n      a rule own railway securities. In two States (the only two\r\n      in the West in which, so far as I am aware, the figures have\r\n      been compiled) out of 27,645 stockholders in the lines\r\n      within the State borders only 359 are residents of the\r\n      States. If the other 27,286 were also residents of these\r\n      States (that is to say, if 27,286 of the present residents\r\n      were also stockholders in the railways), it is probable that\r\n      the ferocity of the public opinion in these States against\r\n      railways would be materially modified.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Mr. Robinson has not been as successful in organizing\r\nsmall tradesmen, boarding-house keepers, employes and shareholders into\r\na new party as he contemplated, notwithstanding \"it was at no loss for\r\nthe sinews of war.\"\r\n\r\nHe attempts to show that this movement originated with the employes, but\r\nit is too well known that the employes who organized the movement were\r\nunder pay of the railroad companies and received their instructions from\r\nthe railroad managers. The statement which Mr. Robinson attributes to\r\nthe Governor of Iowa undoubtedly originated in the mind of one who is\r\nlaboring to modify the ferocity of \"the uninformed public opinion of the\r\nWest.\" No Governor of Iowa ever made any such statement, nor ever\r\nentertained any such sentiment. It is a sheer fabrication.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of standard text-books of law which are indispensable\r\nto the student of railroad questions desiring to go back to first\r\nprinciples. Only a few of them can be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nI. F. Redfield, in his \"Law of Railways,\" says concerning the necessity\r\nfor railroad supervision:\r\n\r\n      \"Railways being a species of highway, and in practice\r\n      monopolizing the entire traffic, both of travel and\r\n      transportation, in the country, it is just and necessary and\r\n      indispensable to the public security that a strict\r\n      legislative control over the subject should be constantly\r\n      exercised.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the original character of the railway as a common highway,\r\nRedfield says:\r\n\r\n      \"The Railways Clauses Consolidation Act provides, in detail,\r\n      for the use of railways by all persons who may choose to put\r\n      carriages thereon, upon the payment of the tolls demandable,\r\n      subject to the provisions of the statute and the regulations\r\n      of the company. The view originally taken of railways in\r\n      England evidently was to treat them as a common highway,\r\n      open to all who might choose to put carriages thereon. But\r\n      in practice it is found necessary for the safety of the\r\n      traffic that it should be exclusively under the control of\r\n      the company, and hence no use is, in fact, made of the\r\n      railway by others.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the questionable financial expedients so frequently resorted to in\r\nbuilding American railways, this author says:\r\n\r\n      \"This is not the place, nor are we disposed, to read a\r\n      homily upon the wisdom of legislative grants, or the\r\n      moralities of moneyed speculations in stocks on the exchange\r\n      or elsewhere. But it would seem that legislation upon this\r\n      subject should be conducted with sufficient deliberation and\r\n      firmness so as not to invest such incorporations with such\r\n      unlimited powers as to operate as a net to catch the unwary,\r\n      or as a gulf in which to bury out of sight the most\r\n      disastrous results to private fortunes, which has justly\r\n      rendered American investments, taken as a whole, a reproach\r\n      wherever the name has traveled.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinion is expressed in this work that under certain circumstances\r\nrailroad securities should be aided by State credit, and is supported by\r\nthe following argument:\r\n\r\n      \"Here we have no national funded stock in convenient sums\r\n      for small investment, and which, being sure, is really a\r\n      great blessing to the mass of those who wish to invest\r\n      moderate sums as a protection against age or calamity. In\r\n      those countries where such opportunities exist, it removes\r\n      all temptation to invest small sums in these enterprises,\r\n      which, however necessary for the public, such small owners\r\n      can but poorly afford to aid in carrying forward, and which\r\n      consequently should in justice either be guaranteed or owned\r\n      by the State, or at all events aided by State credit, when\r\n      they become indispensable for the public convenience.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of eminent domain Redfield says:\r\n\r\n      \"That railways are but improved highways, and are of such\r\n      public use as to justify the exercise of the right of\r\n      eminent domain, by the sovereign, in their construction, is\r\n      now almost universally conceded.\"\r\n\r\nKent says in his \"Commentaries on American Law\":\r\n\r\n      \"The right of eminent domain, or inherent sovereign power,\r\n      gives to the legislature the control of private property for\r\n      public uses, _and for public uses only_.... So, lands\r\n      adjoining New York canals were made liable to be assumed for\r\n      the public use, so far as was necessary for the great object\r\n      of the canals.... In these and other instances which might\r\n      be enumerated, the interest of the public is deemed\r\n      paramount to that of any private individual; and yet, even\r\n      here, the constitutions of the United States and of most of\r\n      the States of the Union have imposed a great and valuable\r\n      check upon the exercise of legislative power, by declaring\r\n      that private property should not be taken for public use\r\n      without just compensation.... It undoubtedly must rest, as a\r\n      general rule, in the wisdom of the legislature to determine\r\n      when public uses require the assumption of private property;\r\n      but if they should take it for a purpose not of a public\r\n      nature, as if the legislature should take the property of A\r\n      and give it to B, or if they should vacate a grant of\r\n      property, or of a franchise, under the pretext of some\r\n      public use or service, such cases would be gross abuses of\r\n      their discretion, and fraudulent attacks on private right,\r\n      and the law would clearly be unconstitutional and void.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the construction of corporate powers Kent lays down the\r\nfollowing rule:\r\n\r\n      \"The modern doctrine is to consider corporations as having\r\n      such powers as are specifically granted by the act of\r\n      incorporation, or as are necessary for the purpose of\r\n      carrying into effect the powers expressly granted, and as\r\n      having no other. The Supreme Court of the United States\r\n      declared this obvious doctrine, and it has been repeated in\r\n      the decisions of the State courts. No rule of law comes with\r\n      a more reasonable application, considering how lavishly\r\n      charter privileges have been granted. As corporations are\r\n      the mere creatures of law, established for special purposes,\r\n      and derive all their powers from the acts creating them, it\r\n      is perfectly just and proper that they should be obliged\r\n      strictly to show their authority for the business they\r\n      assume, and be confined in their operations to the mode and\r\n      manner and subject matter prescribed.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the duties of common carriers he says:\r\n\r\n      \"As they hold themselves to the world as common carriers for\r\n      a reasonable compensation, they assume to do and are bound\r\n      to do what is required of them in the course of their\r\n      employment, if they have the requisite convenience to carry\r\n      and are offered a reasonable and customary price; and if\r\n      they refuse without just ground, they are liable to an\r\n      action.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Cooley, in his very able work, \"Constitutional Limitations,\"\r\nrefers to the so-called vested rights of corporations and the abuse\r\ngrowing out of them as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"It is under the protection of the decision in the Dartmouth\r\n      College case that the most enormous and threatening powers\r\n      in our country have been created, some of the great and\r\n      wealthy corporations actually having greater influence in\r\n      the country at large, and upon the legislation of the\r\n      country, than the States to which they owe their corporate\r\n      existence. Every privilege granted or right conferred--no\r\n      matter by what means or on what pretense--being made\r\n      inviolable by the Constitution, the Government is\r\n      frequently found stripped of its authority in very important\r\n      particulars, by unwise, careless or corrupt legislation; and\r\n      a clause of the Federal Constitution whose purpose was to\r\n      preclude the repudiation of debts and just contracts\r\n      protects and perpetuates the evil.\"\r\n\r\nThe late President Garfield, in one of his legislative speeches, called\r\nattention to the fact that Chief Justice Marshall pronounced the\r\ndecision in the Dartmouth College case ten years before the steam\r\nrailway was born, and then said:\r\n\r\n      \"I have ventured to criticise the judicial application of\r\n      the Dartmouth College case, and I venture the further\r\n      opinion that some features of that decision, as applied to\r\n      the railway and similar corporations, must give way under\r\n      the new elements which time has added to the problem.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Fisk Beach, Jr., in his recent work entitled \"Commentaries on\r\nthe Law of Private Corporations,\" well defines what constitutes\r\ndedication to a public use. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"Whenever any person pursues a public calling and sustains\r\n      such relations to the public that the people must of\r\n      necessity deal with him, and are under a moral duress to\r\n      submit to his terms if he is unrestrained by law, then, in\r\n      order to prevent extortion and an abuse of his position, the\r\n      price he may charge for his services may be regulated by\r\n      law. When private property is affected with a public\r\n      interest it ceases to be _juris privati_ only. This was said\r\n      by Lord Chief Justice Hale more than three hundred years ago\r\n      in his treatise _De Portibus Maris_, and has been accepted\r\n      without objection as an essential element in the law of\r\n      property ever since.\"\r\n\r\nTreating of the fiduciary position of directors and officers of\r\ncorporations, the same author says:\r\n\r\n      \"The directors, officers and agents of a corporation are\r\n      held to the general rule of law resting 'upon our great\r\n      moral obligation to refrain from placing ourselves in\r\n      relations which ordinarily excite a conflict between\r\n      self-interest and integrity.' The directors and officers\r\n      are the agents of the company, and while acting in that\r\n      capacity for it cannot deal with themselves to the detriment\r\n      of the corporation. All contracts of that character are\r\n      voidable at the option of the corporation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd further he says:\r\n\r\n      \"A director whose personal interests are adverse to those of\r\n      the corporation has no right to act as a director. As soon\r\n      as he finds he has personal interests which are in conflict\r\n      with those of the company he ought to resign.\"\r\n\r\nT. Carl Spelling, in his treatise on \"The Law of Private Corporations,\"\r\nsays of pooling arrangements:\r\n\r\n      \"Courts long ago exercised jurisdiction to regulate rates of\r\n      _quasi_ public corporations, and on the same principle will\r\n      refuse to enforce pooling contracts between railroad and gas\r\n      companies. Such contracts are void as against public\r\n      policy.... There is substantial harmony between the English\r\n      and American definitions of monopoly, the two countries\r\n      agreeing that contracts entered into by and between two or\r\n      more corporations, the necessary result of whose performance\r\n      will crush and destroy competition, are illegal.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of eminent domain Mr. Spelling remarks:\r\n\r\n      \"That the legislature may thus select any agency it sees fit\r\n      for the exercise of eminent domain, and also that it may\r\n      determine what purposes shall be deemed public, are\r\n      propositions too deeply rooted in the jurisprudence of this\r\n      country to admit now of doubt or discussion. Making an\r\n      application of this doctrine to railway operations,\r\n      conceding it to be settled that these facilities for travel\r\n      and commerce are a public necessity, if the legislature,\r\n      reflecting the public sentiment, decide that the general\r\n      benefit is better promoted by their construction through\r\n      individuals or corporations than by the State itself, it\r\n      would clearly be pressing a constitutional maxim to an\r\n      absurd extreme if it were to be held that the public\r\n      necessity should be only provided for in the way which is\r\n      least consistent with the public interest.... The power of\r\n      eminent domain being an inherent element of sovereignty, it\r\n      cannot be divested out of the State or abridged by contract\r\n      or treaty so as to bind future legislatures. Nor can the\r\n      right be divested by private contract.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning State control of corporations the same author says:\r\n\r\n      \"The subordination of all private interests to the purposes\r\n      of government, subject only to the condition that the object\r\n      to be accomplished shall be one in which the public has an\r\n      interest, is no longer an open question. In its general\r\n      bearing this principle is too well settled and uniformly\r\n      recognized--underlying the adjudications by courts of all\r\n      cases involving constitutional provisions--to require more\r\n      than a mere statement.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he says:\r\n\r\n      \"Nor is it longer necessary to seek a justification of the\r\n      common practice of regulating the rates of charges and\r\n      general management of railroads on the ground that they have\r\n      received valuable franchises of a public nature and had\r\n      important powers of sovereign character conferred upon them.\r\n      That may be an important political consideration, and as\r\n      such may strengthen the argument in favor of the right; but\r\n      the right itself rests upon firmer ground, and upon other\r\n      considerations than that of pecuniary consideration derived\r\n      from the State. The State may regulate their business, not\r\n      because they are corporations, nor yet because they are\r\n      corporations of a particular kind, but because they, like\r\n      the individuals of which they are composed, are subject to\r\n      the laws which say that when one devotes his property to a\r\n      use in which the public has an interest, he in effect grants\r\n      to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be\r\n      controlled by the public for the common good to the extent\r\n      of the interest he has thus created.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS AND RAILROAD LEGISLATION IN IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first survey for a railroad in the State of Iowa was made in the\r\nfall of 1852. The proposed road had its initial point at Davenport and\r\nfollowed a westerly course. It was practically an extension of the\r\nChicago and Rock Island Railroad, which was then being built between\r\nChicago and the Mississippi River. On the 22d day of December, 1852, the\r\nMississippi and Missouri Railroad Company was formed, its object being\r\nto build, maintain and operate a railroad from Davenport to Council\r\nBluffs. The articles of association were acknowledged before John F.\r\nDillon, notary public, and filed for record in the office of the\r\nRecorder of Scott County, on the 26th of January, 1853, and in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of State on the first day of February following.\r\nIn 1853 the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company entered into an\r\nagreement with the Railroad Bridge Company of Illinois for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of a bridge over the Mississippi at Rock\r\nIsland. The work was commenced in the fall of that year, and the bridge\r\nwas completed on April 21, 1856, it being then the only bridge spanning\r\nthe Mississippi River. The first division of the Mississippi and\r\nMissouri Railroad, extending from Davenport to Iowa City, was completed\r\non the first of January, 1856, and was formally opened two days later. A\r\nbranch line to Muscatine was completed shortly thereafter. On the first\r\nday of July the State of Iowa had in all sixty-seven miles of railroad,\r\nbonded at $14,925 a mile, which at that time probably represented the\r\ntotal cost of construction. The earnings of these sixty-seven miles of\r\nroad during the six months following July 1, 1856, amounted to $184,193,\r\nor $2,749 per mile, which was equal to an annual income of about $5,500\r\nper mile.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, 1856, Congress granted to the State of Iowa certain\r\nlands for the purpose of \"aiding in the construction of railroads from\r\nBurlington, on the Mississippi River, to a point on the Missouri River\r\nnear the mouth of the Platte River; from the city of Davenport, Iowa, by\r\nway of Iowa City and Fort Des Moines, to Council Bluffs; from Lyons City\r\nnorthwesterly to a point of intersection with the main line of the Iowa\r\nCentral Air Line Railroad near Maquoketa, thence on said line running as\r\nnear as practical to the forty-second parallel across the State; and\r\nfrom the city of Dubuque to the Missouri River near Sioux City.\" The\r\ngrant comprised the alternate sections designated by odd numbers and\r\nlying within six miles from each of the proposed roads. Provision was\r\nalso made for indemnity for all lands covered by the grant which were\r\nalready sold or otherwise disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the land-grant policy has been questioned. When these\r\ngrants were made it was believed by many that railroads would not and\r\ncould not be built in the West without such aid. While others did not\r\nshare this opinion, they at least supposed that land grants would\r\ngreatly stimulate railroad enterprise and lead to the early construction\r\nof the lines thus favored.\r\n\r\nThe land grant of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was a mere\r\ndonation for that part of the line which was already completed at the\r\ntime the grant was made; and the extension of this line, as well as the\r\nconstruction of the other lines to which the grant applied, was not\r\nmade as fast as had been anticipated. The price of all Government lands\r\nlying outside of the land-grant belts was $1.25 per acre. To reimburse\r\nthe public treasury for the loss resulting from these grants, the price\r\nof lands situated within the land-grant belts was advanced to $2.50 per\r\nacre, practically compelling the purchasers of the even-numbered\r\nsections of land, instead of the Government, to make the donation to the\r\nrailroads, it being supposed that the benefits resulting to those\r\nregions from the immediate construction of railroads would\r\ncorrespondingly enhance the value of the alternate sections of land\r\nreserved by the Government. Designing men soon saw the advantages which\r\nthe situation offered. They combined with their friends to organize\r\ncompanies for the construction of the land-grant roads, built a small\r\nportion of the proposed line, to hold the grant, and then awaited\r\nfurther developments, or rather the settlement of the country beyond.\r\nThere are those who believe that the doubling of the price of Government\r\nland within the belt of the proposed land-grant roads greatly retarded\r\nimmigration and with it the construction of roads. They hold that, had\r\nno grant whatever been made to any railroad company and had equal\r\ncompetition in railroad construction been permitted, the Iowa through\r\nlines, instead of following, would have led, the tide of immigration.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that in 1856 the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was\r\ncompleted as far as Iowa City. On the second day of June of that year\r\nits Board of Directors asked the Governor of the State to convene the\r\nGeneral Assembly in extra session, to consider the disposition which\r\nshould be made of the recent Congressional grant. This urgency might\r\nlead one to suppose that the company was anxious to extend its line at\r\nthe earliest opportunity. The General Assembly was convened, and the\r\nland given to the State by Congress for the purpose of aiding in the\r\nconstruction of a railroad from Davenport to Council Bluffs was given to\r\nthe Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company. The act was approved by\r\nthe Governor on July 14, 1856, and three days later the company\r\n\"assented to and accepted the grant.\" It then executed mortgage after\r\nmortgage, and built a branch line through quite a populous territory,\r\nfrom Muscatine to Washington, but the main line made very slow progress.\r\nIn 1865 the bonded debt of the company amounted to $6,851,754, although\r\nthe line was completed only to Kellogg, in Jasper County, about forty\r\nmiles east of Des Moines. In spite of the fact that the cost of\r\noperating the road had from the beginning varied but little from 60 per\r\ncent. of its gross receipts, its president, in a circular letter to the\r\nstock-and bondholders, dated October 20th, 1865, made the statement that\r\nthe company was \"driven to the necessity of selling the road or\r\nreorganizing.\" In 1866 suit was brought in the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States for the District of Iowa for the foreclosure of the\r\ncompany's mortgages, and a decree of foreclosure was entered on the 11th\r\nday of May of that year. The property was sold on the 9th day of July\r\nfollowing at Davenport, and was purchased by the Chicago, Rock Island\r\nand Pacific Railroad Company, which was incorporated in this State a few\r\nweeks previous to the sale, for the purpose of acquiring the railroads\r\nbuilt by the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company with all its\r\nappurtenant property, \"and all the rights, privileges and franchises\r\ngranted by the act of Congress of May 15th, 1856, to the State of Iowa,\r\nand by the State of Iowa granted to the said Mississippi and Missouri\r\nRailroad Company, and when so acquired to maintain and operate the said\r\nrailroad.\" It is a significant fact that all the corporators of the new\r\ncompany, except one, were directors of the bankrupt company. On the 20th\r\nof August, 1866, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Company of the\r\nState of Iowa consolidated with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific\r\nRailroad Company of Illinois, and conveyed all its property, powers and\r\nfranchises to the consolidated company. The validity of the\r\nconsolidation was questioned by a large number of stock-and bondholders,\r\nand the courts were appealed to to issue injunctions restraining the\r\nconsolidated company from extending its line or expending any money\r\nobtained through the sale of its securities. In this predicament the\r\ncompany turned to the Iowa legislature for protection. Anxious to secure\r\nthe early completion of the road, the Twelfth General Assembly, by an\r\nact approved February 11th, 1868, recognized the consolidated company,\r\nand resumed and granted to it \"all right or interest\" which the State\r\nhad in the lands previously granted to the Mississippi and Missouri\r\nRailroad Company. The act expressly provided, however, that the Chicago,\r\nRock Island and Pacific Railway Company should \"at all times be subject\r\nto such rules, regulations and rates of tariff for transportation of\r\nfreight and passengers as may from time to time be enacted and provided\r\nfor by the General Assembly of the State of Iowa,\" and that if the\r\ncompany should neglect to comply with any of the requirements of the\r\nact, it should forfeit to the State all its franchises and corporate\r\nrights acquired by or under the laws of the State, and all lands granted\r\nto aid in the construction of its road. The line was completed to\r\nCouncil Bluffs in June, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe lands in aid of the construction of a railroad running across the\r\nState, as nearly as practicable along the forty-second parallel, were\r\ngranted by the General Assembly to the Iowa Central Air Line on the 14th\r\nof July, 1856, but as this company failed to fulfill the conditions of\r\nits grant, it was, on the 17th of March, 1860, transferred to the Cedar\r\nRapids and Missouri River Railroad Company. This company completed the\r\nroad to Marshalltown in 1862, to Nevada in 1864, to Boone in 1865, and\r\nto Council Bluffs in the fall of 1867.\r\n\r\nThe Burlington and Missouri River road reached the Missouri River but a\r\nfew months later. Ten years after this company had received its grant,\r\nits line had only been completed as far as Albia, in Monroe County. In\r\n1867 the road was built little more than half across the State. But it\r\nmanaged not to be far behind its two rivals on the north in reaching the\r\nMissouri River.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it might seem as if these companies had all at once\r\nbecome awake to their obligations. When it is remembered, however, that\r\nin 1869 the junction of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads\r\nwas effected, and thus a continuous line across the continent formed,\r\nthe conclusion lies near that the haste with which the three Iowa\r\nland-grant roads were completed was simply the result of a strife for\r\nthe large amount of through business which the completion of the Pacific\r\nroute promised to bring to them.\r\n\r\nNo such inducement existed for the Dubuque and Sioux City Company, and\r\ntwelve years after receiving its grant it had not yet built half of its\r\nline. In his message to the Twelfth General Assembly, delivered January\r\n14, 1868, Governor Stone said: \"Under the provisions of the act adopted\r\nby the General Assembly, at its extra session (in July, 1856), this (the\r\nDubuque and Sioux City) company became the beneficiary of the grant\r\ndesigned to secure the construction of a railroad leading from Dubuque\r\nto Sioux City, and this valuable donation was accepted from the State,\r\nwith all the terms and conditions imposed. A large portion of this grant\r\nhas already been absorbed by the company, in various ways, by pretended\r\nsales and incumbrances. This road has been constructed to Iowa Falls, a\r\ndistance of 143 miles from Dubuque, but I am unable to discover any\r\nreliable evidence of earnest intention on the part of this company to\r\nconstruct the line to its terminal point on the Missouri River.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor further recommended that the General Assembly pass an act\r\nresuming the control over these lands. At about the same time an\r\nagreement was effected between the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad\r\nCompany (which was organized in the fall of 1867) and the Dubuque and\r\nSioux City Railroad Company, by which the latter transferred to the\r\nformer its land grant for the unfinished portion of the Dubuque and\r\nSioux City road. This agreement was confirmed by the General Assembly,\r\nthrough an act approved April 7, 1868. The road was completed to Fort\r\nDodge in August, 1869, and to Sioux City a year or two later. The entire\r\nline was then leased to the Illinois Central.\r\n\r\nThe land grant to this line of road embraced over 1,000,000 acres of the\r\nfinest lands of the State. We can appreciate the magnitude of this\r\ndonation when we consider that, had these lands been sold at only $8 per\r\nacre, the proceeds would have paid the whole expense of building and\r\nequipping the road from Dubuque to Sioux City. The lands granted to the\r\nC., R. I. & P. R. R. were sold at an average price of over $8 per acre,\r\nand those of the B. & M. at over $12 per acre.\r\n\r\nAmong the other important land grants is that made to the McGregor\r\nWestern Railroad Company. This company was the successor of the\r\nMcGregor, St. Peters and Missouri River Railroad Company, which was\r\norganized in 1857 for the purpose of constructing a railroad from\r\nMcGregor to the Missouri River. The construction of the road was\r\ncommenced in 1857 at McGregor. Large local subscriptions were taken\r\nalong the proposed line, the writer being one of the subscribers. Work\r\nwas continued the next year until much of the heavy grading had been\r\ndone, when the road was allowed to go through the process of\r\nforeclosure, like many other roads built in the West at that time. The\r\nold stock was completely wiped out, and new owners came into possession\r\nof the property, reorganizing under the name of the McGregor Western\r\nRailway Company. Nearly all the early investments of Iowa people were\r\nthus confiscated by the same class of men who now cry out loudly against\r\nconfiscatory measures. By an act of Congress approved May 12, 1864, the\r\nState of Iowa was granted, for the use and benefit of the McGregor\r\nWestern Railroad Company, every alternate section of land designated by\r\nodd numbers for ten sections in width on each side of the proposed road.\r\nThe act contained the condition that in the event of the failure of said\r\nMcGregor Western Railroad Company to build twenty miles of said road\r\nduring each and every year from the date of its acceptance of the grant\r\nthe State might resume the grant and so dispose of it as to secure the\r\ncompletion of the road in question. The McGregor Western Railroad\r\nCompany failing to comply with the conditions of the grant, the General\r\nAssembly on the 27th day of February, 1868, resumed the lands and on the\r\n31st day of March of the same year regranted them to the McGregor and\r\nSioux City Railway Company. The act specially provided that the company\r\naccepting the grant \"shall at all times be subject to such rules,\r\nregulations and rates of tariff for the transportation of freight and\r\npassengers as may from time to time be enacted and provided for by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of Iowa, and further subject to the\r\nconditions, limitations, restrictions and provisions contained in this\r\nact and in the acts of Congress granting said lands to the State of\r\nIowa.\" It also contained the condition that at least twenty miles of\r\nroad should be built by the company every year and that the whole road\r\nshould be completed to the intersection of the then proposed railway\r\nfrom Sioux City to the Minnesota State line by the first day of\r\nDecember, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe McGregor and Sioux City Railway Company also failing to comply with\r\nthe terms of the grant, the lands were again resumed by the General\r\nAssembly on March 15th, 1876, and regranted to the McGregor and Missouri\r\nRiver Railroad Company upon the condition that it complete the road to\r\nthe intersection of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad on or before\r\nthe first day of December, 1877.\r\n\r\nBut the State found itself again disappointed, and two years later the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the third and last time resumed its grant and then\r\nconferred it upon the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company\r\nupon the express conditions that it complete the road to Spencer on or\r\nbefore the first day of January, 1879, and to Sheldon within a year\r\nthereafter, and that the road should at all times be subject to State\r\ncontrol. The road was completed to Sheldon without delay, and on the\r\n30th of November, 1878, the Governor of the State certified to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior that the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\r\nRailway Company had completed its road from Algona to Sheldon in\r\ncompliance with the conditions of the original grant and the laws of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIt thus took over twenty years to complete this road. Ten years after\r\nits construction had commenced it had only reached Calmar in Winneshiek\r\nCounty. In 1869 the road was completed to Clear Lake and in 1870 to\r\nAlgona. This point remained its terminus until it passed into the hands\r\nof the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company.\r\n\r\nThe State of Iowa has not derived that benefit from the large land\r\ngrants made to its railroads which her people had a right to expect. In\r\nspite of these grants roads were built only when there was reason to\r\nbelieve that they would be immediately profitable to their owners. The\r\nland grants enriched the promoters of these enterprises much more than\r\nthey did the State in whose interest the grants were presumed to be\r\nmade. As a rule they enabled scheming men to hold the selected territory\r\nuntil a railroad through it promised to be a safe and profitable\r\ninvestment, and to avoid the payment of taxes on their millions of acres\r\nof land, which in the meantime became very valuable. Other roads were\r\nbuilt at an early day without Government aid. They were pushed forward\r\nby the current of immigration until the threatened competition of roads\r\nfavored by these grants checked their progress. The Chicago, Iowa and\r\nNebraska road may be cited as a fair illustration. It was projected on\r\nthe 26th of January, 1856, in the town of Clinton, to be built from\r\nClinton to the Missouri River via Cedar Rapids. It was opened to De Witt\r\nin 1858 and completed to Cedar Rapids the following year. The road was\r\n82-1/2 miles long and was built entirely with private means, receiving\r\nneither legislative aid nor local subsidy. It is more than probable\r\nthat this road would at an early day have been completed to the Missouri\r\nRiver, had it not feared the rivalry of the subsidized Cedar Rapids and\r\nMissouri road.\r\n\r\nThe total number of acres of land granted by Congress to aid the\r\nconstruction of Iowa roads is 4,069,942. A fair idea of the value of\r\nthese lands may be obtained from the fact that the Chicago, Rock Island\r\nand Pacific Railroad Company sold over half a million acres of its lands\r\nat an average of $8.68 per acre, and the Chicago Burlington and Quincy\r\nsold nearly 350,000 acres at an average of $12.17 per acre.\r\n\r\nBut land grants form only a small part of the public and private\r\ndonations which have been made to Iowa roads. Including the railroad\r\ntaxes voted by counties, townships and municipalities, the grants of\r\nrights of way and depot sites and public and private gifts in money,\r\nthese roads have received subsidies amounting to more than $50,000,000,\r\nor enough to build 40 per cent. of all the roads of the State. There is\r\nno doubt that the contributions of the public toward the construction of\r\nthe railroads of Iowa is several times as large as the actual\r\ncontributions of their stockholders for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe people of Iowa were from the first very favorably disposed towards\r\nrailroads. Every inducement was held out to railroad builders to come\r\nhere and help to multiply the tracks for the iron horse. They came and\r\nbrought with them many abuses which since the first introduction of\r\nrailroads had gradually been developed in other States.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the old and the new mode of transportation was so\r\ngreat, and the public appreciated so highly the superior conveniences\r\nafforded by the latter, that for years the abuses practiced by the early\r\nrailroads were scarcely noticed, or, if they did attract the attention\r\nof the public, they appeared more like necessary features of the new\r\nsystem of transportation than like abuses. The evil gradually increased,\r\nbut for years no attempt was made to check its growth. The railroad\r\nmanagers construed this failure of the people to interfere with, or even\r\nprotest against, their unjust practices as a quasi-sanction of their\r\ncourse, and soon claimed to do by right what they had formerly done by\r\nsufferance. The evils increased until the patience of the people finally\r\nbecame exhausted.\r\n\r\nWhile the State thus for years dealt very leniently with the railroad\r\ncompanies, the laws of Iowa had from the beginning of railroad building\r\nemphasized the principle of State control. This principle was asserted\r\nin the very first railroad act ever passed in the State. Section 14 of\r\nchapter I. of the acts of the extra session of the Fifth General\r\nAssembly, regranting to the various railroad companies the lands granted\r\nto the State by Congress for railroad purposes, provides that \"railroad\r\ncompanies accepting the provisions of this act shall at all times be\r\nsubject to such rules and regulations as may from time to time be\r\nenacted and provided for by the General Assembly of Iowa....\" In 1866 an\r\nattempt was made in the General Assembly to regulate rates, but the\r\nAttorney-General, to whom the question of constitutionality was\r\nsubmitted, held in his opinion that it was not in the power of the\r\nlegislature to prescribe rates for railroad companies. This opinion\r\nprovoked much indignation among the people of the State, and led to the\r\nexpression of a sound public opinion by legislative acts which could not\r\nbe misunderstood.\r\n\r\nWhen the Twelfth General Assembly (in 1868) regranted to the Chicago,\r\nRock Island and Pacific Railroad Company the lands originally granted\r\nto the Mississippi and Missouri Company, it only did so upon the\r\ncondition that \"said railroad company, accepting the provisions of this\r\nact, shall at all times be subject to such rules, regulations and rates\r\nof tariff for transportation of freight and passengers as may from time\r\nto time be enacted and provided for by the General Assembly of the State\r\nof Iowa....\" The same restricting clause, known as the Doud Amendment,\r\nwas added to all other land grant acts passed by the Twelfth and\r\nsubsequent General Assemblies, and the various companies willingly and\r\ngladly accepted it.\r\n\r\nThe abuses of which the people of Iowa complained were far from being\r\nconfined to their State. They were practiced throughout the Northwest,\r\nand the demand for reform was as loud in Minnesota, Wisconsin and\r\nIllinois as it was in Iowa. In 1871 laws were passed in Illinois and\r\nMinnesota fixing maximum charges for the transportation of freight and\r\npassengers and prohibiting discriminations. The railroads claimed that a\r\nState did not have the right to prescribe rates and refused to be bound\r\nby these laws. Instead of modifying their policy, they became daily more\r\narrogant. Discriminations which had before been practiced under the veil\r\nof secrecy, or which had been defended by railroad managers as\r\nexceptions to the general rule made necessary by a peculiar combination\r\nof circumstances wholly beyond their control, were now openly and\r\ndefiantly practiced by several of the larger roads. The Chicago,\r\nMilwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, in its effort to annihilate a\r\nrival, went so far as to openly announce to the public its intention to\r\nentirely disregard distance as a factor in rate-making. It gradually\r\nbecame the general rule to wage war against rivals at competitive\r\npoints and to \"recoup\" by charging excessive rates at non-competitive\r\npoints. Every encouragement was thus given by the railroads to the\r\nGranger movement, which spread in less than two years over the whole\r\nNorthwest.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1873 Iowa elected a Granger legislature, like Minnesota,\r\nWisconsin and Illinois. The wildest predictions were made by railroad\r\nmen as to the extremes to which the Granger legislature would go, but it\r\nconfined itself to enacting a law establishing an official\r\nclassification and fixing maximum rates for all railroad companies. The\r\nlaw was approved March 23, 1874, and went into effect on the 4th of July\r\nfollowing. This law in no case compelled companies to carry freight at a\r\nlower rate than they had voluntarily carried it in the past. Many of the\r\nrates in force at the time of the passage of the act were considerably\r\nlower than the corresponding maximum rates fixed by the legislature. The\r\naverage rates fixed by the law were higher than the rates at which the\r\nrailroads had previously carried a large portion of corresponding\r\nfreight. The revenues of the road were not even curtailed by this law;\r\non the contrary, by equalizing rates, _i. e._, by leveling up the rates\r\ngiven to favored places and favored individuals and leveling down the\r\nexorbitant rates exacted from the public at non-competitive points, the\r\nrailroad companies were enabled to effect an increase in their total\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThe Granger law remained in force until 1878. Its constitutionality was\r\ntested by the railroad companies in the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, but this high tribunal held that rate-making was a legislative\r\nand not a judicial function, that it was within the province of the\r\nState legislature to prescribe rates for the transportation of\r\npassengers and freight wholly within the State, and that for protection\r\nagainst abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls, and\r\nnot to the courts.\r\n\r\nThe Granger laws have been and are still severely criticised by those\r\nopposed to the principle of State control and by the ignorant. It is\r\nnevertheless true that those laws were moderate, just and reasonably\r\nwell adapted to remedy the evils of which the public complained. It has\r\nbeen the policy of most railroad men to attack them as crude, intensely\r\nradical and socialistic. The obloquy heaped upon them was the work of\r\ndesigning men who desired to continue their impositions upon the people.\r\nMr. Charles Francis Adams, however, admits that the Granger method was\r\nprobably as good a method as could have been devised of approaching men\r\nwho had thoroughly got it into their heads that they, as common\r\ncarriers, were in no way bound to afford equal facilities to all, and,\r\nindeed, that it was in the last degree absurd and unreasonable to expect\r\nthem to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa law was imperfect in detail, and yet its enactment proved one\r\nof the greatest legislative achievements in the history of the State. It\r\ndemonstrated to the people their ability to correct by earnestness and\r\nperseverance the most far-reaching public abuses and led to an emphatic\r\njudicial declaration of the common-law principle that railroads are\r\nhighways and as such are subject to any legislative control which may be\r\ndeemed necessary for the public welfare.\r\n\r\nDefeated in the courts, the railroad managers now endeavored to make\r\nodious the new law which deprived them of the power to manipulate\r\nrailroad interests to their personal advantage. By complying with only\r\npart of its letter and none of its spirit, they contrived to create\r\nhardships for certain interests and localities. Instead of charging in\r\nall cases reasonable rates, as the spirit of the law demanded, they\r\nwould frequently charge the maximum rates permitted under the law, and\r\nwhen they by this practice succeeded in damaging certain interests, they\r\nwould point to the Granger law as the source of all existing railroad\r\nevils. So, likewise, when they were asked by their patrons to reduce a\r\nhigh rate, they would plead the legislative schedule in excuse of their\r\nfailure to comply with the request. When the legislature of 1878\r\nconvened, the railroad managers appeared before it and pleaded\r\nsubmissively for a repeal of the Granger law and the establishment of a\r\ncommissioner system. They claimed that they were ready and willing to\r\nsubmit to all reasonable regulation, but that a maximum tariff law was\r\nprejudicial both to the best interests of the roads and those of the\r\npublic. They further asserted that the people had grown tired of this\r\nmanner of regulating railroad charges and earnestly desired a change of\r\npolicy; that the interference of the State with the railroad business\r\nhad injuriously affected certain industrial interests and had greatly\r\nretarded railroad construction by driving capital and promoters of\r\nrailroad enterprises from the State. These statements would indeed have\r\nargued strongly in favor of a repeal of the law if they had been based\r\non facts. There had been, however, no expression of public\r\ndissatisfaction during the campaign preceding the session of the General\r\nAssembly. There were doubtless individuals and even communities to whom\r\nthe law had been made so odious that they felt they had but little to\r\nlose by a change, but the masses of the people believed that the law was\r\nbased upon just principles and desired its perfection rather than its\r\nrepeal. As to the claim that railroad construction had been checked by\r\nhostile legislation, statistics prove that during the five years\r\nfollowing the great panic of 1873 Iowa fared no worse in this respect\r\nthan her sister States east, west or south.\r\n\r\nThe arguments produced by the railroad managers no doubt influenced some\r\nmembers of the General Assembly; by far the greater number of them,\r\nhowever, realised that the failure of the law to bring the expected\r\nrelief was not due so much to its own imperfections as to the absence of\r\na power to enforce it. The writer, with others, was convinced that a\r\nstrong and conscientious commission would be a much more potent agency\r\nto secure reasonable rates for the shipper than a maximum tariff law\r\nwithout proper provisions for its efficient enforcement; they, in short,\r\npreferred a commission without a tariff law to a tariff law without a\r\ncommission. The question became the subject of many animated debates in\r\nboth houses of the General Assembly, but the commissioner system at last\r\nprevailed. The act establishing a Board of Railroad Commissioners, and\r\ndefining their duties, was approved on the 23rd of March, 1878, and went\r\ninto force a few days later. The act empowered the commission to\r\nexercise a general supervision over all railroads operated in the State,\r\nto inquire into any neglect or violation of the laws of the State by any\r\nrailroad corporation or its officers or employes, to examine the books\r\nand documents of any corporation, to investigate complaints of shippers\r\nthat unreasonable charges had been made by railroad companies, and to\r\nmodify any charge which they might deem unreasonable. It was also made\r\nthe commissioners' duty to make an annual report to the Governor\r\ndisclosing the working of the railroad system in the State, the officers\r\nof each company being required to make annual returns to the board for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nThough the enactment of this law was a surprise to the people, they\r\naccepted it in good cheer, and determined to give it an honest trial.\r\nThe law was extensive in its scope and stringent for that time, and, if\r\nstrictly enforced in letter and in spirit, promised to be, and would\r\nhave been, entirely sufficient for the thorough control of railroad\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the course of time it became apparent that either the\r\nlaw had not lodged sufficient authority in the commission or the\r\ncommission did not make use of the authority which the law had given\r\nthem. In spite of the commission, the railroad companies maintained\r\npools and charged extortionate and discriminating rates, in direct\r\nviolation of the law. It is true the commissioners righted many a wrong.\r\nIn investigating the complaints of shippers against railroad companies\r\nthey often rendered valuable services to those who had neither the means\r\nnor the inclination to prosecute their rights in the courts of law; but\r\nas they held that they could only pass upon individual charges, and did\r\nnot have the power to revise the companies' tariffs, the companies were\r\nvirtually in a position to become guilty of more extortions in one day\r\nthan the commission could investigate in a year. Moreover, the railroad\r\ncompany might be ordered by the commission to return an overcharge to a\r\ncertain shipper, but this did not prevent it from continuing the\r\nexcessive charge. If the overcharged shipper again wanted relief it was\r\nhis privilege to again apply to the commission, and to continue this\r\ntedious process until either his or the commissioners' patience became\r\nexhausted. The people soon found that the new system of control was\r\nalmost as inadequate as that which it had displaced. Some attributed the\r\nweakness of the commission to its personnel, others to the law. There\r\nis no doubt that the commission might have accomplished more than it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped by some that as the commission gained in experience it\r\nwould gain in influence, and that railroad evils would gradually\r\ndiminish. But they were disappointed in their expectations. Every year\r\nseemed to add to the grievances of the public. Success greatly\r\nemboldened the railway companies. Discriminations seemed to increase in\r\nnumber and gravity. At many points in the western part of the State\r\nfreight rates to Chicago were from 50 to 75 per cent. higher than from\r\npoints in Kansas and Nebraska. A car of wheat hauled only across the\r\nState paid twice as much freight as another hauled twice the distance\r\nfrom its point of origin to Chicago. Minnesota flour was hauled a\r\ndistance of 300 miles for a less rate than Iowa flour was carried 100\r\nmiles. Certain merchants received from the railroad companies a discount\r\nof 50 per cent. on all their freights and were thus enabled to undersell\r\nall their competitors. The rate on coal in carload lots from Cleveland,\r\nLucas County, to Glenwood was $1.80 per ton, and from the same point to\r\nCouncil Bluffs only $1.25, although the latter was about thirty miles\r\nlonger haul. Innumerable cases of this kind could be cited. There was\r\nnot a town or interest in the State that did not feel the influence of\r\nthese unjust practices. Many of the rates complained against, it is\r\ntrue, were beyond the direct control of the State commission, but there\r\nwas an impression among well-informed shippers that if the commission\r\nhad the power to fix local rates and exercised it judiciously, the\r\nrailroad companies would soon find it to their interest to be as\r\nreasonable in making through rates for Iowans as they expected the\r\ncommission, to be in prescribing local tariffs.\r\n\r\nThe demand of the people for more equitable rates and a more thorough\r\ncontrol of the railroad business increased from year to year. Repeated\r\nattempts were made in the General Assembly to secure the passage of an\r\nact looking to that end, but, owing to shrewd manipulations on the part\r\nof the railroad lobby, every attempt was defeated. There always was, of\r\ncourse, a large number of members who represented districts not well\r\nsupplied with railroad facilities. These, as a rule, honestly opposed\r\nrestrictive legislation, believing that such legislation would check\r\nbuilding, and that, on the other hand, competition could be relied upon\r\nto correct abuses. Of those members who had less positive convictions\r\nmany were retained as railroad attorneys and were thus made serviceable\r\nto the companies. Other members with political ambition were nattered or\r\nintimidated into subjection, and bribes in disguise, such as passes and\r\nspecial rates, were not unfrequently resorted to to strengthen the\r\nrailroad following in both houses of the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nRailroad corruption did not pause here. It is a notorious fact that\r\nlarge sums of money were paid to venal papers of both parties in\r\nconsideration of an agreement on their part to defend transportation\r\nabuses and exert their influence against progressive railroad\r\nlegislation. The vilest means were often resorted to by these sheets to\r\nobtain their end. Public men who had the courage to avow their\r\nopposition to existing railroad abuses or to favor a more perfect system\r\nof State control of railways were misrepresented, ridiculed, traduced\r\nand denounced as demagogues and socialists by hypocritical editors, who\r\nprostituted their political influence as long as they enjoyed railroad\r\nstipends, and who at intervals became converts to the cause of the\r\npeople for the purpose of extorting from the railroad companies a new\r\nand increased subsidy. But truth can not long be suppressed. The masses\r\nof the people may be imposed upon for a time, but even the shrewdest\r\nrogue will eventually be compelled to surrender. In time even rather\r\nunsophisticated voters learned to place a true estimate upon the motives\r\nof the editors, whose policy, as one of them expressed it in the\r\nauthor's presence, was \"controlled by the counting-room.\"\r\n\r\nRailroad politicians gradually lost their influence, and the symptoms of\r\npublic discontent greatly increased. In the political campaign of 1887\r\nState control of railroads became one of the main issues. Both of the\r\ngreat political parties in their platforms had declared themselves very\r\nemphatically in favor of such legislation as would bring railroad\r\ncorporations under complete State control, and with very few exceptions\r\nthe various legislative districts had nominated only such men as\r\ncandidates for legislative offices as were known to be in thorough\r\naccord with the masses of the people upon the railroad question.\r\n\r\nThe election resulted in an even more complete defeat of the railroad\r\nforces than had been generally anticipated. Yet no hasty step was taken\r\nwhen the General Assembly convened. A large number of bills\r\ncontemplating railroad reforms in various ways were introduced, but the\r\nmaterial presented was carefully sifted by the railroad committees and a\r\ncommittee bill was framed which incorporated the best features of them\r\nall. The committees listened patiently for weeks to the arguments of the\r\nrepresentatives of both the railroads and the shippers.\r\n\r\nNever before had so formidable a railroad lobby assembled at the State\r\nCapitol. The danger signal had been raised, and not only were the great\r\npolitical manipulators of the State called into requisition, but experts\r\nfrom adjoining States joined them in besieging the legislature. The\r\ndogs of war were let loose from all quarters. A legion of hirelings were\r\nzealous to show their servility and loyalty to their lords. The daily\r\nand weekly papers of the State in the service of railroad companies\r\nteemed with arguments from the pens of railroad attorneys, and their\r\ncolumns were profusely supplemented with editorials copied from\r\nprominent corporation papers like the New York _Tribune_, New York\r\n_Times_, New York _World_, Albany _Evening Argus_, Boston _Advertiser_,\r\nand others from various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThese papers, attempting to disguise the motives that prompted them to\r\ncome to the defense of the Wall Street interest, affected the position\r\nof disinterested and impartial observers. They condemned the proposed\r\nmeasures as wild and socialistic, and they painted in dark colors the\r\ndisasters to railroad property, the injustice to its owners, and\r\nmisfortunes to the people of Iowa, that would follow their adoption.\r\nEspecially did they bewail the losses that would fall upon the widows\r\nand orphans who had confidingly invested all of their hard earnings in\r\nthis property.\r\n\r\nThey never uttered a word of condemnation, but entirely ignored or\r\ndefended the abuses by which the stockholders were robbed at one end of\r\nthe line and the patrons were imposed on at the other.\r\n\r\nMany of these papers were notified that their statements were altogether\r\nerroneous, but they would not admit a line to their columns in relation\r\nto the matter that indicated any other disposition than complete\r\nsubserviency to the interests of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, an unusual number of strong men in this General\r\nAssembly, and this extraordinary display of railroad forces only tended\r\nto impress more strongly upon them the necessity of curbing the railroad\r\npower, and their best energies were concentrated upon the subject, with\r\na firm determination to deal with it in a manner dictated by reason and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nSo well did the bill which was finally adopted by the committee reflect\r\nthe general sentiment of the members of the General Assembly that not a\r\nsingle vote was cast against it in either house upon its final passage.\r\nSince the adjustment of business under this law, there has been less\r\nfriction between the people and the railroads than before for thirty\r\nyears, and so satisfactory has it proved to all that no one, not even a\r\nrailroad man, has to this day asked the legislature to repeal the law or\r\nany part of it. The act contains no new principle of railroad control.\r\nBy far the greater part of its provisions were taken from the old law.\r\nNearly every one of its features may be found either in the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act or upon the statute books of other States. It provides that\r\ncharges must be reasonable and just, that no undue preference or\r\nadvantage shall be given to any railroad patron, and that equal\r\nfacilities for interchange of traffic shall be given to all roads; it\r\nprohibits pooling, a greater charge for a shorter than longer haul, the\r\nshorter or any portion of it being included in the longer, and\r\ndiscrimination against any shipping point. It requires that schedules of\r\nrates and fares shall be printed and kept for public inspection, and\r\nthat no advance shall be made in rates or fares once established except\r\nafter ten days' public notice; and it empowers the Board of Railroad\r\nCommissioners to make and revise schedules for railroads, the rates\r\ncontained in such schedules to be received and held in all suits as\r\n_prima facie_ reasonable maximum rates. The act further provides\r\npenalties and means of enforcement.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that by the passage of this act the legislature\r\ndisclaimed the right to fix absolute rates; it simply chose this\r\nexpedient because in the present tentative stage of rate regulation it\r\nseemed most efficient.\r\n\r\nThere has been much misunderstanding concerning the Iowa law. Many\r\nsuppose that the Iowa commissioners have power to make confiscatory\r\nrates for the railroads, while in fact they can only name maximum rates\r\nwhich shall be deemed and taken in all courts of the State as _prima\r\nfacie_ evidence that they are reasonable and just maximum rates until\r\nthe railroads show that they are not. They are at liberty to go into\r\ncourt any day and show this, if they are able. They are, however,\r\ncareful not to undertake it, for no one knows better than they do that\r\nthe rates fixed by the commissioners are liberal for the railroads.\r\n\r\nThere are nine States, besides Iowa, in which the power to fix rates has\r\nbeen conferred upon railroad commissioners. This feature of the law was\r\ntherefore far from being a novel one, yet no provision of the act was,\r\nprevious to its passage, so furiously opposed, or subsequent to it so\r\nstubbornly resisted as this. Railroad managers realized that a surrender\r\nof the right to make their own rates was virtually a surrender of the\r\npower to practice abuses.\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the law the commissioners commenced the work\r\nof preparing schedules of the rates for the roads. They endeavored to do\r\njustice to both the railroad companies and their patrons by affording a\r\nfair compensation to the former and at the same time giving relief to\r\nthe depressed interests represented by the latter. Their rates were not\r\nas low as the special rates that had at various times been granted to\r\nfavorite shippers, but were a fair average of the various rates in vogue\r\nat the time. While the schedule was under consideration, the railroad\r\nmanagers were given frequent hearings, in which they endeavored to\r\nimpress their views upon the commissioners and to obtain many important\r\nconcessions, which they urged as essential to the welfare of the\r\nrailroad interests. Their views guided the commission to such an extent\r\nthat it was generally supposed that the schedule as finally adopted\r\nwould be accepted by the railroad companies without protest.\r\n\r\nThe schedule of the Iowa commission has been sharply criticised by Mr.\r\nStickney in his \"Railway Problem.\" He finds in it inconsistencies and\r\nconfusion, due, as he charges, to faulty mathematics. But it is claimed\r\nby the commission, and Mr. Stickney should know, that whenever\r\nmathematics were ignored in the construction of the schedule it was done\r\nat the earnest and persistent solicitation of the railroad managers,\r\nwho, it seems, were more interested in maintaining their interstate\r\nrates than in the consistency of the Iowa schedule.\r\n\r\nThe rates were published, as required by law, and June 28, 1888, was\r\nfixed as the day on which they were to take effect. A few days previous\r\nto this date the companies asked that the taking effect of the new\r\ntariff be postponed a week. When this request was granted by the\r\nchairman of the commission, the railroad managers took advantage of the\r\ncourtesy by enjoining the commissioners in the Federal court from\r\nenforcing it.\r\n\r\nSeveral months later the commissioners modified their schedule by the\r\nadoption of the Western Classification. Again the railroad managers\r\nasked the court for an injunction, but this time met with a refusal.\r\n\r\nAfter many suits for penalties had been instituted against them, and\r\nmany more threatened, they adopted the new schedule, but endeavored to\r\ninaugurate a policy of retaliation by reducing their train service and\r\ndischarging a large number of employes, and in many ingenious ways\r\ncontinued their seditious course with a determination characteristic of\r\na band of insurrectionists. But the impetus which railroad traffic\r\nreceived under the operation of the commissioners' schedule was such\r\nthat they soon found it necessary to restore to the service its former\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Commissioners' report shows that while the number of\r\nemployes was 24,642, and their yearly compensation was $14,212,500 in\r\n1889, in 1892 there were 30,492 employes, and their yearly compensation\r\n$18,070,915.\r\n\r\nThe increase in both the gross and net earnings of Iowa lines has been\r\nremarkable, as shown in the following table gathered from the\r\ncommissioners' reports:\r\n\r\n             Gross Earnings,    Net Earnings,\r\n   Year.         Total.            Total.         Per Mile.\r\n\r\n  1888-89     $37,369,276        $11,861,310       $1,421\r\n  1889-90      41,318,133         12,798,430        1,522\r\n  1890-91      43,102,399         14,463,106        1,720\r\n  1891-92      44,540,000         14,945,000        1,777\r\n\r\nIt was claimed by railroad men that the effect of Iowa legislation would\r\nbe particularly disastrous to her local roads, which had no opportunity\r\nto make up on through business the losses incurred in the local traffic.\r\nThe Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern was particularly cited as a\r\nline which would have to go into bankruptcy under the new law. Its\r\nearnings commenced to increase, however, immediately after the adoption\r\nof the commissioners' schedule, and at the end of the first year they\r\nwere large enough to change this line from a Class \"C\" to a Class \"B\"\r\nroad. They continued to increase, and in 1891 its gross earnings on\r\nsubstantially the same mileage were 36 per cent, and its net earnings 64\r\nper cent. larger than they had been in 1888. The increase continued and\r\nenabled the company to make a dividend to its stockholders February 1,\r\n1893, it being the first dividend ever made by the company. It is a good\r\nillustration of what the Iowa law has done for weak railroads. It has\r\nagain changed class and is now a Class \"A\" road.\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the fears, or rather the pretended fears of the railroad\r\nmanagers, that the legislature of Iowa would bankrupt her railroads,\r\nwere entirely groundless. As a result of the law railroads have been\r\nable to increase their gross earnings as well as their profits. They\r\nhave been enabled to give employment to a larger number of men, and\r\nthere has been no occasion for them to carry out the dishonest threat to\r\ndecrease the wages of their employes. Had it not been for their\r\nincreased earnings in Iowa, the losses recently sustained in other\r\nStates by several of the through lines would have made it impossible for\r\nthem to declare the dividends which they did.\r\n\r\nUnder her beneficial railroad policy Iowa has prospered wonderfully, and\r\nher railroads have been more prosperous than when they were allowed to\r\nhave their own way. The commissioners' tariff has made jobbing and\r\nmanufacturing profitable where it was unprofitable before. It has added\r\nto our industries and our commerce, and has made new business for the\r\npeople as well as the railroads. It has contributed to the increase in\r\nthe value of our farms and factories and their products, and the time\r\nwill come when wise railroad managers, like the majority of former\r\nslaveholders of the South, would not resurrect the past if they could.\r\nIn fact, honorable managers now acknowledge that they would not if they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies are at present making a systematic effort to\r\nweaken the Iowa commission, but if they should succeed in doing so, the\r\npeople, under our system of electing the commissioners, can readily\r\ncorrect the evil.\r\n\r\nOther States have much experience similar to that of Iowa. Nebraska has\r\njust adopted a maximum tariff law for the control of her roads. It will,\r\nof course, be resisted by the railroad managers of that State.\r\n\r\nThe State of Texas is not so productive in proportion, but is much\r\ngreater in extent than Iowa, and upon the whole resembles it much in its\r\nprominent characteristics. Both are thrifty, progressive States, with no\r\nlarge commercial or manufacturing centers where their people can easily\r\norganize to protect their financial interests.\r\n\r\nThe people of Texas endured patiently the abuses so prevalent in\r\nrailroad management until a few years since they enacted a railroad law\r\nsimilar to that of Iowa. The Wall Street managers of the Texas railroads\r\nare at the present time using all of their familiar methods to influence\r\nthe people of that State to repeal their law. The following letter\r\nserves to show the spirit with which they are approached:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"23 BROAD STREET,\r\n      NEW YORK, November 30, 1891.\r\n\r\n      James B. Simpson, Esq., Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\n      \"DEAR SIR: Yours of the 26th is received and contents\r\n      carefully noted. Very likely you have valuable franchises,\r\n      or what would be valuable in almost any other state than\r\n      Texas; but while there are many places in Texas where we\r\n      would like to build some railroads--mostly short ones--we\r\n      cannot do anything so long as the disposition exists that\r\n      now seems to in Texas; that is, to do all the harm they\r\n      can do this kind of property, and I think my views are\r\n      shared by all people who have money to invest. No one is\r\n      disposed to create property which, after being created, is\r\n      not to be controlled by its ownership. Of course, we all\r\n      expect to be subject to the police regulations and to pay\r\n      the taxes of any State even as other property, but whenever\r\n      anything is done beyond that it checks this kind of\r\n      improvement, and where it approaches so near confiscation as\r\n      the sentiment of Texas tends it entirely prevents capital\r\n      from being invested.\r\n\r\n      \"I think there is no road in Texas that is to-day earning\r\n      its operating and fixed charges. Every road, I think, has\r\n      been or is in the hands of a receiver, excepting our great\r\n      east and west line, which is supported by business going\r\n      entirely through the State, which business could also be\r\n      sent another way, and would be so sent, excepting that we\r\n      believe the people of Texas will some time take a sober\r\n      second thought and treat the railroads as they do other\r\n      kinds of property. When that time comes I shall be ready to\r\n      talk to you about your franchises, if it comes in my day,\r\n      and I believe it will, as I think no other people are\r\n      suffering from an unwise policy persistently pursued as are\r\n      the people of your State.\r\n\r\n      \"Yours truly,\r\n      C. P. HUNTINGTON.\"\r\n\r\n               \"Now, in the name of all the gods at once,\r\n               Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,\r\n               That he hath grown so great?\"\r\n\r\nIt was but a few years ago when this Mr. Huntington was keeping a small\r\nretail store in the city of Sacramento, and he exhibited then no greater\r\nability, except perhaps that he was a little more venturesome, than\r\nthousands of others engaged in the same occupation; subsequently he\r\nengaged, with several others, in the Central Pacific Railroad scheme,\r\nand received from the bounties of our generous Government as his share\r\nof the profits in that enterprise several million dollars, which sum has\r\never since been continually swelled by the exercise of a power scarcely\r\ninferior to the power of taxing the property of the Pacific Coast. He\r\nhas been so successful for years in manipulating Congressmen and State\r\nlegislatures and shaping the policies of States that he now considers it\r\nimpertinent and short-sighted for a people to take steps to limit his\r\nlevies upon them. It is to be hoped that the boycotting and intimidating\r\nmethods resorted to will have no more effect upon the people of that\r\nState than they had on the people of Iowa.\r\n\r\nIowa is the queen among the States of the Union. No other State has so\r\nlittle waste land or is so productive. Her annual output of staple\r\nproducts amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars in value. Her people\r\nare intelligent, progressive and just. None are governed more by the\r\nprecepts of the golden rule, or are more disposed to render unto Cæsar\r\nthe things that are Cæsar's. She can well be proud of the progress she\r\nhas made in State control of railroads. Let no backward step be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States was adopted nearly fifty years\r\nbefore the locomotive made its appearance. Had the steam railroad been\r\nin existence in 1787 and been as important an agency of commerce as it\r\nis to-day, there is every reason to believe that the railroad question\r\nwould have received the special attention of the framers of that\r\ninstrument. It is a well-known fact that the \"new and more perfect\r\ngovernment\" had its origin in the necessities of commerce, and while the\r\nfuture exigencies of trade were beyond the reach of the most speculative\r\nmind, the provisions of the Constitution relating to the subject of\r\ninterstate commerce were made broad and far-reaching. Section 8 of\r\nArticle I. of the Constitution provides that \"the Congress shall have\r\npower ... to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the\r\nseveral States, and with the Indian tribes ... and to make all laws\r\nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the\r\nforegoing powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the\r\nGovernment of the United States, or in any department or officer\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nIf any doubt ever existed as to the import of the phrase \"to regulate\r\ncommerce,\" it has been entirely removed by the decisions of the Supreme\r\nCourt. In the Passenger cases, 7 Howard, 416, the court said:\r\n\r\n      \"Commerce consists in selling the superfluity; in purchasing\r\n      articles of necessity, as well productions as manufactures;\r\n      in buying from one nation and selling to another, or _in\r\n      transporting the merchandise_ from the seller to the buyer\r\n      to gain the freight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, in the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad vs. Pennsylvania,\r\nthe Supreme Court said:\r\n\r\n      \"Beyond all question the transportation of freights or of\r\n      the subjects of commerce for the purpose of exchange or sale\r\n      is a constituent of commerce itself. This has never been\r\n      doubted, and probably the transportation of articles of\r\n      trade from one State to another was the prominent idea in\r\n      the minds of the framers of the Constitution when to\r\n      Congress was committed the power to regulate commerce among\r\n      the several States.... It would be absurd to suppose that\r\n      the transmission of the subjects of trade from the seller to\r\n      the buyer, or from the place of production to market, was\r\n      not contemplated, for without that there could be no\r\n      consummated trade with foreign nations or among the States.\"\r\n\r\nChief Justice Marshall, in Gibbons vs. Ogden, 9 Wheaten, 196, construed\r\nthe words \"power to regulate\" as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete\r\n      in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and\r\n      acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the\r\n      Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact that during the first eighty years of the\r\nGovernment's existence Congress did not exert its power to regulate the\r\nconduct of common carriers engaged in interstate transportation. The\r\nfirst act regulating such carriers was passed in July, 1866. It\r\nauthorized railroad companies chartered by the States to carry\r\npassengers, freights, etc., \"on their way from any State to another\r\nState, and to receive compensation therefor, and to connect with roads\r\nof other States so as to form continuous lines for transportation of the\r\nsame to the place of destination.\" The passage of this act, it should be\r\nremembered, was urged by the railroad companies themselves. Seven years\r\nlater an act was passed providing that \"no railway within the United\r\nStates, whose road forms any part of a line or road over which cattle,\r\nsheep, swine or other animals shall be conveyed from one State to\r\nanother, or the owners or masters of steam, sailing or other vessels\r\ncarrying or transporting cattle, sheep or swine or other animals from\r\none State to another, shall confine the same in cars, boats or vessels\r\nof any description for a longer period than twenty-eight consecutive\r\nhours, without unloading the same for water, rest and feeding, for a\r\nperiod of at least five consecutive hours, unless prevented from so\r\nunloading by storm or accidental causes.\"\r\n\r\nEvery violation of this act was made punishable by a penalty of from\r\n$100 to $500.\r\n\r\nThough Congress had asserted the right to regulate commerce among the\r\nStates, it had made previous to 1873 very limited use of that power. In\r\nthe midst of the Granger movement the Senate of the United States passed\r\non the 26th day of March, 1873, the following resolution:\r\n\r\n      \"_Resolved_, That the Select Committee on Transportation\r\n      Routes to the Seaboard be authorized to sit at such places\r\n      as they may designate during the recess, and to investigate\r\n      and report upon the subject of transportation between the\r\n      interior and the seaboard; that they have power to employ a\r\n      clerk and stenographer, and to send for persons and\r\n      papers....\"\r\n\r\nThe committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Windom, discharged their\r\nduty with great fidelity, and submitted their report to the Senate\r\nduring its next regular session. They declared that the defects and\r\nabuses of the then existing systems of transportation were insufficient\r\nfacilities, unfair discrimination and extortionate charges. As the\r\nprincipal causes of such excessive rates they assigned stock watering,\r\ncapitalization of surplus earnings, construction rings, general\r\nextravagance and corruption in railway management, and combinations and\r\nconsolidations of railway companies. The committee were of the opinion\r\nthat the promotion of competition would not permanently remedy the\r\nexisting evils, and laid it down as a general rule that competition\r\namong railways ends in combination and in enhanced rates. As expedient\r\nand practical remedies for the existing evils they recommended the\r\nfollowing measures:\r\n\r\n1. Direct Congressional regulation of railway transportation, under the\r\npower to regulate commerce among the several States.\r\n\r\n2. Indirect regulation and promotion of competition, through the agency\r\nof one or more lines of railway, to be owned and controlled by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n3. The improvement of natural water-ways and the construction of\r\nartificial channels of water communication.\r\n\r\nThe report was accepted and considered, but there the matter rested, so\r\nfar as the practical results were concerned.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Mr. John H. Reagan, of Texas, introduced in the House of\r\nRepresentatives a bill for an act to regulate railroad companies engaged\r\nin interstate commerce. This may be said to have been the first real\r\ninterstate commerce bill before Congress. It was a progressive, thorough\r\nand well-planned measure, but failed to receive the approval of Congress\r\nbecause a majority of its members considered it too radical a measure.\r\nThe bill contained many of the provisions of the present Interstate\r\nCommerce Act, including the anti-pooling and the long and short haul\r\nclauses; but instead of creating a commission it lodged in the courts,\r\nboth State and Federal, the power to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nOther bills were introduced from year to year, but during a period of\r\nnine years none of them drew sufficient votes to make it a law. Congress\r\nmay be said to have been divided into three camps upon the railroad\r\nquestion, viz.: those who favored the system of regulation proposed by\r\nMr. Reagan, those who favored the commissioner system and those who were\r\nopposed to every mode of Federal regulation of interstate commerce. In\r\nthe meantime, the inactivity of Congress caused considerable\r\nrestlessness among the people, and the demand for action became louder\r\nevery year. The issue entered into politics, and a number of Western\r\nCongressmen owed their failure to be re-elected to their indifference or\r\nenmity to Federal railroad legislation.\r\n\r\nOn March 21st, 1885, under authority of a resolution adopted by the\r\nSenate of the United States, the President of the Senate appointed a\r\nselect committee to investigate and report upon the subject of the\r\nregulation of the transportation of freight and passengers between the\r\nseveral States by railroad and water routes. Senator Cullom, of\r\nIllinois, became its chairman. The committee examined a large number of\r\nwitnesses, including railroad managers and shippers, addressed letters\r\nto the railroad commissioners of the several States, to boards of trade,\r\nchambers of commerce, State boards of agriculture, Patrons of Husbandry,\r\nFarmers' Alliances, etc., and made every effort to obtain the opinions\r\nof those who had given special attention to the transportation problem.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee was submitted to the Senate on January 18,\r\n1886. Concerning the abuses of railroad transportation it differed but\r\nlittle from that of the Windom committee. The report declared publicity\r\nto be the best remedy for unjust discrimination and recommended that\r\nthe posting of rates and public notice of all changes in tariffs be\r\nrequired. It also recommended that a greater charge for a shorter than a\r\nlonger haul be made presumptive evidence of an unjust discrimination,\r\nand that a national commission be established for the enforcement of any\r\nlaws that might be passed for the regulation of interstate commerce.\r\nUpon the question of pooling the report stated:\r\n\r\n      \"The committee does not deem it prudent to recommend the\r\n      prohibition of pooling, which has been urged by many\r\n      shippers, or the legalization of pooling compacts, as has\r\n      been suggested by many railroad officials and by others who\r\n      have studied the question.... The majority of the committee\r\n      are not disposed to endanger the success of the methods of\r\n      regulation proposed for the prevention of unjust\r\n      discrimination by recommending the prohibition of pooling,\r\n      but prefer to leave that subject for investigation by a\r\n      commission when the effects of the legislation herein\r\n      suggested shall have been developed and made apparent.\"\r\n\r\nThe report was accompanied by a bill representing \"the substantially\r\nunanimous judgment of the committee as to the regulations which are\r\nbelieved to be expedient and necessary for the government and control of\r\nthe carriers engaged in interstate traffic.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was before Congress for more than a year, receiving several\r\nimportant amendments before its final passage in both houses. It was\r\napproved by the President on the 4th day of February, 1887, and took\r\neffect sixty days after its passage, except as to the provisions\r\nrelating to the appointment and organization of an Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, which took effect at once.\r\n\r\nThe act contains twenty-four sections, but is by no means cumbersome. It\r\nis, in many respects, the most important piece of legislation that has\r\nbeen had in Congress for the past twenty years. It applies to common\r\ncarriers engaged in the transportation of passengers or property wholly\r\nby railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water, when both are\r\nused, under a common control, management or arrangement, for a\r\ncontinuous carriage or shipment from one State or Territory of the\r\nUnited States, or the District of Columbia, to any other State or\r\nTerritory in the United States or the District of Columbia, or from any\r\nplace in the United States to an adjacent foreign country, or from any\r\nplace in the United States through a foreign country to any other place\r\nin the United States. It prohibits unjust and unreasonable charges,\r\nspecial rates, rebates, drawbacks, undue or unreasonable preferences,\r\nadvantages, prejudices and disadvantages, as well as all discriminations\r\nbetween connecting lines. It makes unlawful a less charge for a longer\r\nthan for a shorter haul over the same line, in the same direction, the\r\nshorter being included within the longer distance, except when specially\r\nauthorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission. It prohibits pools,\r\nrequires schedules of freight rates and passenger fares to be kept in\r\nall depots and stations, permits no advance in the rates, fares and\r\ncharges once established, except after ten days' public notice, and\r\nmakes it unlawful for common carriers to charge either more or less than\r\nschedule rates.\r\n\r\nIt also requires them to file copies of all schedules, traffic contracts\r\nand joint schedules with the Interstate Commerce Commission, as well as\r\nto make them public when directed by the commission, and prohibits\r\ncombinations to prevent the carriage of freight from being continuous\r\nfrom the place of shipment to the place of destination. It makes common\r\ncarriers liable for all damages to persons injured by violations of the\r\nact, and specially provides that any court before which such a damage\r\nsuit may be pending may compel any director, officer, receiver, trustee\r\nor agent of the defendant company to appear and testify in the case, and\r\nthat the claim that any such testimony or evidence may tend to criminate\r\nthe person giving such evidence shall not excuse such witness from\r\ntestifying, but that such evidence or testimony shall not be used\r\nagainst such person on the trial of any criminal proceeding. It likewise\r\nsubjects such officers and employes of a railroad company as may be\r\nguilty of aiding or abetting in violations of the act to fines not\r\nexceeding $5,000 for each offense.\r\n\r\nThese provisions are covered by the first ten sections of the act.\r\nSection 11 establishes the Interstate Commerce Commission, to be\r\ncomposed of five commissioners appointed by the President by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate. It provides that the commissioners\r\nfirst appointed shall continue in office for the term of two, three,\r\nfour, five and six years, respectively, from the first of January, 1887,\r\nthe term of each to be designated by the President, and that their\r\nsuccessors shall be appointed for terms of six years, except that any\r\nperson chosen to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the\r\nunexpired term of the commissioner whom he shall succeed. No more than\r\nthree commissioners may be appointed from the same political party, and\r\nthe President has the power to remove any commissioner for inefficiency,\r\nneglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Authority is given to the\r\ncommission to inquire into the management of the business of all common\r\ncarriers subject to the provisions of the act and to require the\r\nattendance of witnesses and to invoke the aid of any court of the United\r\nStates for that purpose.\r\n\r\nSection 13 authorizes any person, firm, corporation or association, any\r\nmercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, any body politic or\r\nmunicipal organization to file complaints against any common carrier\r\nsubject to the provisions of the act, with the commission, whose duty it\r\nis made to forward a statement of the charges to such common carrier and\r\ncall upon him to satisfy the complaint or answer the same in writing,\r\nand to investigate the matters complained of, if the complaint is not\r\nsatisfied. The commission is also charged with the duty of making such\r\ninvestigations at the request of State or territorial railroad\r\ncommissions and may even institute them at its own motion. Section 14\r\nrequires the commission to make a report in writing of any investigation\r\nit may make and to enter it of record and furnish copies of it to the\r\ncomplainant and the common carrier complained of. Section 15 makes it\r\nthe commissioners' duty, when it is found that any law cognizable by it\r\nhas been violated by a common carrier, to serve notice on such carrier\r\nto desist from such violation and to make reparation for an injury found\r\nto have been done. If any lawful order or requirement of the commission\r\nis disobeyed by a common carrier, it becomes their duty and is lawful\r\nfor any company or person interested in such order to apply by petition\r\nto the Circuit Court of the United States sitting in equity in the\r\njudicial district in which the common carrier complained of has its\r\nprincipal office, and the court has power to hear and determine the\r\nmatter speedily and without the formal pleadings and proceedings\r\napplicable to ordinary suits, and to restrain the common carrier from\r\ncontinuing such violation or disobedience. It is further provided by\r\nthis section that on such hearings the report of the commission shall be\r\naccepted as _prima facie_ evidence.\r\n\r\nSection 17 regulates the proceedings of the commission. A majority\r\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The commission may\r\nfrom time to time make or amend rules for the regulation of proceedings\r\nbefore it. Any party may appear before it and be heard in person or by\r\nattorney, and every vote or official act of the commission must be\r\nentered of record and its proceedings made public upon the request of\r\neither party interested.\r\n\r\nSection 19 provides that the principal office of the commission shall be\r\nin Washington, but that for the convenience of the public it may hold\r\nspecial sessions in any part of the United States.\r\n\r\nSection 20 authorizes the commission to require annual reports from all\r\ncommon carriers subject to the provisions of the act, to fix the time\r\nand prescribe the manner in which such reports shall be made, and to\r\nrequire from such carriers specific answers to all questions upon which\r\nthe commission may need information.\r\n\r\nSection 21 excepts from the operation of the act the carriage of\r\nproperty for the United States, State or municipal governments, or for\r\ncharitable purposes, or for fairs and expositions; also the issuance of\r\nmileage, excursion and commutation tickets, the giving of reduced rates\r\nto ministers of religion, the free carriage by a railroad company of its\r\nown officers and employes, and the exchanging of passes or tickets among\r\nthe principal officers of railroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe sections not noticed are of minor importance, relating to annual\r\nreports, salaries, appropriations of funds, etc.\r\n\r\nThe act was amended on March 2, 1889, but the amendments made did not\r\nmaterially affect its principal provisions.\r\n\r\nWhen the law was passed its friends well realized that its success would\r\ngreatly depend on the character of the commissioners whom it was\r\nincumbent upon the President to appoint. It was feared that if the\r\nrailroad influence should control these appointments, the power to\r\nsuspend the long and short haul clause would be the chief and perhaps\r\nthe only power exercised by the commission. There was great danger that\r\nthe office of Interstate Commerce Commissioner might become a sinecure\r\nfor servile railroad lawyers, as similar State officers had been before,\r\nand that a public trust might be turned into an additional corporation\r\nagency for evil. The selection of the commissioners, and especially that\r\nof Judge T. M. Cooley, of Michigan, was greatly to the credit of\r\nPresident Cleveland. A man of unquestionable integrity, an eminent\r\njurist and close student of railroad affairs, Judge Cooley was\r\nparticularly well qualified for the office of chairman of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, which he occupied for nearly five years with signal\r\nfitness, and from which he only retired to the sincere regret of the\r\nAmerican people. Under Judge Cooley's leadership the commission has been\r\nmore than a purely executive board. It was under the Constitution not in\r\nthe power of Congress to clothe the Interstate Commerce Commission with\r\nfull judicial authority without giving its members, like other Federal\r\njudges, tenure for life, instead of a term of years. The inherent force\r\nof the commission's decisions in its interpretation of the law made them\r\nin many cases virtually the equivalent of judicial rulings.\r\n\r\nA few of the most important decisions of the commission may be mentioned\r\nhere. Construing the long and short haul clause, they held that, in case\r\nof complaint for violating this section of the act, \"the burden of proof\r\nis on the carrier to justify any departure from the general rule\r\ndescribed by the statute, by showing that the circumstances and\r\nconditions are substantially dissimilar.\" They also decided that \"when a\r\ngreater charge in the aggregate is made for the transportation of\r\npassengers or the like kind of property for a shorter than a longer\r\ndistance over the same line in the same direction, the shorter being\r\nincluded in the longer distance, it is not sufficient justification\r\ntherefor that the traffic which is subjected to such greater charge is\r\nway or local traffic and that which is given the more favorable rates is\r\nnot; and that it is not \"sufficient justification for such greater\r\ncharge that the short-haul traffic is more expensive to the carrier,\r\nunless when the circumstances are such as to make it exceptionally\r\nexcessive, or the long-haul traffic exceptionally inexpensive, the\r\ndifference being extraordinary and susceptible of definite proof; nor\r\nthat the lesser charge on the longer haul has for its motive the\r\nencouragement of manufactures or some other branch of industry, nor that\r\nit is designed to build up business or trade centers.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the question of publicity of the railroad business the commission\r\nheld that, as the books of the defendant carriers, as to rates charged,\r\nfacilities furnished and general movements of freight, are in the nature\r\nof semi-public records, the officers and agents of defendant carriers\r\nought to give promptly to a complainant any statement of facts called\r\nfor, if such statement may probably have importance on the hearing.\r\n\r\nJudge Brewer's opinion as to what constitutes a reasonable rate was\r\nevidently not shared by Judge Cooley and his colleagues, for in the case\r\nof the New Orleans Cotton Exchange vs. the Cincinnati, New Orleans and\r\nPacific Railway Company the commission decided that the fact that a\r\nroad earns but little more than operating expenses cannot be made to\r\njustify grossly excessive rates, and that \"wherever there are more roads\r\nthan the business at fair rates will remunerate, they must rely upon\r\nfuture earnings for the return of investments and profits.\" In another\r\ncase the commission hold that \"in fixing reasonable rates the\r\nrequirements of operating expenses, bonded debt, fixed charges and\r\ndividend on capital stock from the total traffic are all to be\r\nconsidered, but the claim that any particular rate is to be measured by\r\nthese as a fixed standard, below which the rate may not lawfully be\r\nreduced, is one rightly subject to some qualifications, one of which is\r\nthat the obligations must be actual and in good faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe rules governing the proper construction of classification sheets\r\nwhich the commission has laid down are founded upon common sense and\r\njustice. They say:\r\n\r\n      \"A classification sheet is put before the public for general\r\n      information; it is supposed to be expressed in plain terms\r\n      so that the ordinary business man can understand it and, in\r\n      connection with the rate sheets, determine for himself what\r\n      he can be lawfully charged for transportation. The persons\r\n      who prepare the classification have no more authority to\r\n      construe it than anybody else, and they must leave it to\r\n      speak for itself.\"\r\n\r\nIn defining what is legitimate traffic the commission made the following\r\ndecision:\r\n\r\n      \"The transportation of traffic under circumstances and\r\n      conditions that force a low rate for its carriage or an\r\n      abandonment of the business, but which affords some revenue\r\n      above the cost of its movement, and works no material\r\n      injustice to other patrons of a carrier, is to be deemed\r\n      legitimate competition. When, however, its carriage is at a\r\n      loss and imposes a burden on like traffic at other points\r\n      and on other traffic, it is to be deemed destructive and\r\n      illegitimate competition.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in a former chapter that the weaker oil refiners have\r\nbeen discriminated against by the railroads, which permitted the\r\nStandard Oil Company to use their own tank cars in the shipment of oil\r\nand charge its competitors excessive rates for like shipments in\r\nbarrels. Complaint being made of this discrimination, the commission\r\nheld that it is properly the business of a carrier by railroad to supply\r\nrolling stock for the freight he offers or proposes to carry, and that\r\n\"if the diversities and peculiarities of traffic are such that this is\r\nnot always practical, and the consignor is allowed to supply it for\r\nhimself, the carrier must not allow its own deficiencies in this\r\nparticular to be made the means of putting at unreasonable disadvantage\r\nthose who may use in the same traffic all the facilities which it\r\nsupplies.\"\r\n\r\nA most important ruling of the commission is that relating to the pass\r\nabuse. Complaint was made that the Boston and Maine Railroad Company\r\nissued in the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts\r\nfree passes to certain classes of persons, among them \"gentlemen long\r\neminent in the public service, higher officials of the States, prominent\r\nofficials of the United States, members of the legislative railroad\r\ncommittees of the above named States, and persons whose good will was\r\nclaimed to be important to the defendant.\" The commission decided that\r\nsuch a discrimination is unwarranted, that a carrier is bound to charge\r\nequally to all persons, regardless of their relative individual standing\r\nin the community, and that the words \"under substantially similar\r\ncircumstances and conditions\" relate to the nature and character of the\r\nservice rendered by the carrier, and not to the official, social or\r\nbusiness position of the passenger.\r\n\r\nIt is a notorious fact that the practice of issuing free passes to\r\npublic officials and other influential persons has been more or less\r\nindulged in by nearly every railroad in the country up to the present\r\ntime. It is to be hoped that this ruling of the commission will be\r\nenforced in such a manner as to put an end to this intolerable abuse.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission has been equally efficient in its\r\nadministrative capacity. From the very first it called attention to the\r\ngreat advantage of having one classification of freight throughout the\r\ncountry, and it has since labored diligently to unify the various\r\nclassifications in use. As the commission in this undertaking is only\r\narmed with the armor of moral suasion, it is a difficult task; but there\r\nis little doubt that the accomplishment of this great reform is only a\r\nquestion of a few years. Iniquities in classifications and rates are\r\nconstantly pointed out by the commission and corrected by the companies.\r\nMoreover, the annual reports of the commission, not to mention its very\r\nexcellent statistical data, diffuse much useful information and dispel\r\nmany delusions. Thus the fourth annual report of the commission says:\r\n\r\n      \"A stranger to the law might infer, from some public\r\n      addresses and pamphlets which have assumed to discuss this\r\n      subject, that the railroad companies were prohibited from\r\n      carrying the necessities of life over long distances at very\r\n      low rates, unless their rates on other subjects of\r\n      transportation for shorter distances were made to\r\n      correspond. Indeed, instances have been pointed out in which\r\n      it was said that certain articles of commerce could not now\r\n      be transported for long distances, because, by reason of\r\n      this provision, they would not bear the charges that must\r\n      under compulsion of law be imposed upon them. Among such\r\n      instances has been mentioned the granite industry of New\r\n      England, as to which it has been said that valuable\r\n      manufactories have ceased to be profitable because it has\r\n      now become impossible for the proprietors to obtain from\r\n      the railroad companies the nominal rates for the\r\n      transportation of their products which they formerly\r\n      enjoyed, since it is now, by the long and short haul clause,\r\n      made criminal for the companies to give such rates.\r\n\r\n      \"A complaint of this nature is not to be met by argument,\r\n      because it is baseless in point of fact. The instance\r\n      mentioned may safely be assumed to be chosen rather from\r\n      regard to the need of an attack upon the law than from any\r\n      belief in the justice of its application. The prohibition of\r\n      the fourth section, so far as concerns this article of\r\n      commerce, or any other that can be named, will have no\r\n      application whatever until it is made to appear that\r\n      elsewhere upon the lines of the road conveying it there is\r\n      property of the same kind, for transportation by the same\r\n      carriers in the same direction, upon which the carriers are\r\n      disposed to making greater charges in the aggregate for the\r\n      shorter hauls.\r\n\r\n      \"The wheat of the extreme West, it is also said, can no\r\n      longer have the nominal rates which were formerly made for\r\n      transportation to the seaboard, but this assertion is also\r\n      without point or applicability, unless it is shown that the\r\n      carriers are not only disposed to give such rates, but\r\n      propose to make up for the consequent losses to themselves\r\n      by the imposition of greater charges in the aggregate for\r\n      the carriage of the like grain when offered for carriage by\r\n      growers in the States nearer the seaboard. Nominal rates\r\n      impartially made as between shippers of like articles in the\r\n      same direction and under like circumstances and conditions\r\n      are as admissible now as they ever were.\"\r\n\r\nThe same report contains a rather pointed reply to Judge Brewer's ruling\r\nin the Iowa rate cases, viz., that, \"where the rates prescribed will not\r\npay some compensation to the owners, then it is the duty of the courts\r\nto interfere and protect the companies from such rates,\" and that\r\ncompensation implies three things: \"Payment of cost of service, interest\r\non bonds and then some dividends.\" The commission reviews this stupid\r\nrule as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The effort has sometimes been made to indicate a rule which\r\n      must constitute the minimum of reduction in all cases, and\r\n      it has been said that rates must not be made so low that the\r\n      carriers would be left unable to pay interest on their\r\n      obligations and something by way of dividend to\r\n      stockholders, after maintaining the road in proper condition\r\n      and paying all running expenses. This comes nearer to a\r\n      suggestion of a rule of law for these cases than any other\r\n      that has come to the knowledge of the commission. But it is\r\n      so far from being a rule of law, that it is not even a rule\r\n      of policy, or a practical rule to which any name can be\r\n      given, and to which the carriers themselves or the public\r\n      authorities can conform their action. In the first place,\r\n      when we take into consideration the question of the\r\n      condition of roads and of equipment, the proper improvements\r\n      to be made, the new conveniences and appliances to be\r\n      considered and made use of, if deemed desirable, and the\r\n      innumerable questions that are involved in the matter of\r\n      running expenses, it is very obvious that there can be no\r\n      standard of expenses which the court can act upon and apply,\r\n      but that the whole field is one of judgment in the exercise\r\n      of a reasonable discretion by the managing powers or by the\r\n      public authorities in reviewing their action. It is to be\r\n      borne in mind that there are many roads in the country that\r\n      never have been and in all probability never will be able to\r\n      pay their obligations and to pay dividends, even the\r\n      slightest, to their stockholders.... If the rule suggested\r\n      is a correct one, and must be adhered to by the public\r\n      authorities, then it is entirely impossible that those who\r\n      operate these roads can prescribe excessive charges, since\r\n      it is impossible to fix any rates that would bring their\r\n      revenues up to the point of enabling them to pay any\r\n      dividends.... But the rule suggested would also be one under\r\n      which those roads would be entitled to charge the most\r\n      which, instead of being built with the money of the\r\n      stockholders themselves, had been constructed with money\r\n      borrowed; the larger the debt the higher being the rates\r\n      that would be legal. If a road were out of debt so that it\r\n      had no bonds to provide for, it must content itself with\r\n      such rates as would pay some dividend to its stockholders.\r\n      If the road were in debt, though it perhaps served the same\r\n      communities, it might be entitled to charge rates 50, or\r\n      possibly 100 per cent higher.... But over and beyond all\r\n      this the attempt to apply the rule suggested would be\r\n      absolutely futile for the reason that the rates prescribed\r\n      for one road would necessarily affect all others that either\r\n      directly or indirectly came in competition with it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the annual reports of the commission\r\nstand unexcelled as dauntless, clear, concise and instructive public\r\ndocuments. It may also be asserted that whatever success has so far\r\nattended the Interstate Commerce Law, that success is in a great measure\r\ndue to the tact, courage and ability of the men who, in the past, have\r\nbeen the guiding spirits of the commission.\r\n\r\nEfforts will be made by railroad managers in the future, as they have\r\nbeen made in the past, to weaken the commission by securing the\r\nappointment of men servile to the railroad interest as members of that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nMr. Depew says that \"all railroad men are politicians, and active ones.\"\r\nThis is true as to manipulating managers and will continue to be so just\r\nas long as we allow such extraordinary powers to be exercised by them.\r\nThe saloon men are politicians, and active ones. There is not a city or\r\ntown in this broad land that is not in danger of falling under their\r\nsway unless their offensive efforts are resisted. The old United States\r\nBank managers were politicians, and active ones. They perverted the\r\ntrust reposed in their hands to such an extent that the indignation of\r\nthe people was aroused, and under the lead of a stern old patriot the\r\nbank was swept out of existence. Shall we restrain corporation\r\nmanagement within proper limits and make corporations serve the public\r\nwelfare, or shall we let the abuses go on until the people, under the\r\nlead of another Jackson, demand emphatically the application of some\r\nremedy, for better or for worse? Perhaps Government ownership, perhaps\r\nsomething else. Nations, like individuals, should profit by the\r\nexperience of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission, in their sixth annual report, say,\r\nconcerning the Interstate Commerce Law:\r\n\r\n      \"It was scarcely possible that it should be so complete and\r\n      comprehensive at the outset as to require no alteration or\r\n      amendment. Those who are familiar with the practices which\r\n      obtained prior to the passage of this law, and contrast them\r\n      with the methods and conditions now existing, will accord to\r\n      the present statute great influence in the direction of\r\n      necessary reforms and a high degree of usefulness in\r\n      promoting the public interest.\r\n\r\n      \"Whoever will candidly examine the reports of the commission\r\n      from year to year, and thus become acquainted with the work\r\n      which has been done and is now going on, will have no doubt\r\n      of the potential value of this enactment in correcting\r\n      public sentiment, restraining public injustice and enforcing\r\n      the principle of reasonable charges and equal treatment.\r\n      Imperfections and weaknesses which could not be anticipated\r\n      at the time of its passage have since been disclosed by the\r\n      effort to give it effective administration. The test of\r\n      experience, so far from condemning the policy of public\r\n      regulation, has established, its importance and intensified\r\n      its necessity. The very respects in which the existing law\r\n      has failed to meet public expectation point out the\r\n      advantages and demonstrate the utility of Government\r\n      supervision....\r\n\r\n      \"Of this much we are convinced: The public demand for\r\n      Government regulation and the necessity for legal\r\n      protection against the encroachments of railroad\r\n      corporations have not been diminished by the experience of\r\n      the last six years. The act to regulate commerce was not\r\n      framed to meet a temporary emergency, nor in obedience to a\r\n      transient and spasmodic sentiment. The people will not\r\n      tolerate a return to the injustice and wrong-doing which\r\n      inevitably occurs when no correction is undertaken and no\r\n      regulation attempted. The evils of unrestricted management\r\n      will not be permanently endured, and legal remedies will\r\n      continue to be sought until they are amply provided. The\r\n      present statute, however crude and inadequate in many\r\n      respects, was the constitutional exercise of most important\r\n      powers and the legislative expression of a great and\r\n      wholesome principle. Its fundamental and pervading purpose\r\n      is to secure equality of treatment. It assumes that the\r\n      railroads are engaged in a public service, and requires that\r\n      service to be impartially performed. It asserts the right of\r\n      every citizen to use the agencies which the carrier provides\r\n      on equal terms with all his fellows, and finds an invasion\r\n      of that right in every unauthorized exemption from charges\r\n      commonly imposed.\r\n\r\n      \"The railroad is justly regarded as a public facility which\r\n      every person may enjoy at pleasure, a common right to which\r\n      all are admitted and from which none are excluded. The\r\n      essence of this right is equality, and its enjoyment can be\r\n      complete only when it is secured on like conditions by all\r\n      who desire its benefits. The railroad exists by virtue of\r\n      authority proceeding from the State, and thus differs in its\r\n      essential nature from every form of private enterprise. The\r\n      carrier is invested with extraordinary powers, which are\r\n      delegated by the sovereign, and thereby performs a\r\n      governmental function. The favoritism, partiality and\r\n      exactions which the law was designed to prevent resulted, in\r\n      large measure, from a general misapprehension of the nature\r\n      of transportation and its vital relation to commercial and\r\n      industrial progress. So far from being a private possession,\r\n      it differs from every species of property, and is in no\r\n      sense a commodity. Its office is peculiar, for it is\r\n      essentially public. The railroad, therefore, can rightfully\r\n      do nothing which the State itself might not do if it\r\n      performed this public service through its own agents instead\r\n      of delegating it to corporations which it has created. The\r\n      large shipper is entitled to no advantage over his smaller\r\n      rival in respect of rates or accommodations, for the\r\n      compensation exacted in every case should be measured by the\r\n      same standard. To allow any exceptions to this fundamental\r\n      rule is to subvert the principle upon which free\r\n      institutions depend and substitute arbitrary caprice for\r\n      equality of right.\r\n\r\n      \"The spirit of the law is opposed to usages so long\r\n      continued and so familiar that their unjust and demoralizing\r\n      character has not been clearly perceived, but it is a long\r\n      step towards such regulation of the agencies of\r\n      transportation as will make them equally available to all\r\n      without discrimination between individuals or communities.\r\n      It can hardly be the fault of those who are charged with its\r\n      administration if the beneficial aims of this statute have\r\n      not been fully attained and compliance with its provisions\r\n      not completely secured. A better understanding of its\r\n      purpose and an educated public sentiment, aided by the\r\n      needful amendments which experience suggests, will fully\r\n      vindicate the policy of Congress in undertaking to bring the\r\n      great transportation interests of the country into general\r\n      harmony with its requirements.\r\n\r\n      \"It affords us gratification to add that many railroad\r\n      managers of the highest standing now concede the necessity\r\n      for Government regulation, and avow themselves in favor of\r\n      such further enactments as will make that regulation\r\n      effective.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RATE QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailroad managers frequently make the assertion that the average freight\r\nrates charged in the United States are lower than those usually charged\r\nin European countries and that this fact is in itself sufficient proof\r\nthat they are too low. A comparison of the transportation problem of\r\nEurope with our own will show this argument to be fallacious.\r\n\r\nWhile from $25,000 to $30,000 a mile is a very liberal estimate of the\r\naverage cost of American roads, the average cost of European railroads,\r\nowing to their expensive rights of way, substantial road-beds and heavy\r\ngrades, is probably not less than $75,000 per mile. British railway\r\ncompanies have laid out for the purchase of land, for right of way and\r\ndepot accommodations an amount about equal to the entire average cost of\r\nAmerican roads for the same number of miles.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Southeastern Company paid $20,000; the Manchester and\r\nLeeds Company, $30,750, and the London, Birmingham and Great Western,\r\n$31,500 per mile. The first Eastern Counties line paid even $60,000 per\r\nmile for land through an agricultural district. As nearly as can be\r\nascertained, the average cost of the right of way of railroads was over\r\n$20,000 for the United Kingdom. In Belgium the average cost of the right\r\nof way was $11,000. It was lower, however, in the other countries of the\r\nEuropean continent.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the country through which the English railways are\r\nbuilt is such as necessitated enormous expenses for heavy embankments,\r\ncuttings, viaducts, tunnels and bridges, and in some cases increased the\r\ncost of the roads to fabulous sums. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\r\nactually cost $260,000 per mile for the whole of its 403 miles. European\r\nroads have been built in a much more permanent manner and have terminal\r\nfacilities whose cost is far beyond any sum paid for such purposes in\r\nthis country. In Great Britain, moreover, the expenses of contests and\r\nof procuring charters have been very great and have probably averaged\r\n$3,000 per mile.\r\n\r\nEnglish railway men charge Americans with having indulged in\r\nstock-watering to a greater extent than any other people in the world.\r\nThis is probably true, yet the English have not been dull students of\r\nthis art, and they are far from free of having indulged in this luxury.\r\nMuch of their railroad stock was issued in a wasteful manner and\r\nrepresents no actual investment, and it is safe to say that from 30 to\r\n40 per cent. of their present railroad capitalization is water.\r\n\r\nIf upon the above basis both European and American railroads are to\r\nyield an interest of 4-1/2 per cent. on the actual investment, the\r\nformer will have to earn at least $2,250 per mile more than the latter,\r\nand this difference equals about 50 per cent. of the average operating\r\nexpenses of American roads per mile. Labor is cheaper across the\r\nAtlantic, but this difference is more than equalized by the employment\r\nof a much larger number of men per mile, as the following table will\r\nshow:\r\n\r\n  Countries.      No. of men employed   Average wages   Wages paid\r\n                       per mile.          per annum.      per mile.\r\n\r\n  United Kingdom          18                $335          $6,000\r\n  Belgium                 22                 210           4,620\r\n  Russia                  15                 240           3,600\r\n  Germany                 14                 250           3,500\r\n  France                  14                 220           3,080\r\n  United States            5                 555           2,625\r\n\r\nThe London and Northwestern Railway is 1,793 miles long and has over\r\n55,000 employes, or over 30 per mile. The Lancashire and Yorkshire\r\nCompany employs over 42 per mile.\r\n\r\nThe train men of Europe work less hours and earn less per capita for\r\ntheir employers than do the train men of this country. The average\r\nannual gross earnings per employe on sixteen of the leading lines of\r\nGreat Britain, as shown by Mr. Jeans, appear to be $975 against $1,600\r\non fifteen leading lines of the United States, while the average net\r\nearnings per employe are $465 on the British lines against $720 on the\r\nAmerican lines; making a difference in favor of this country of 70 per\r\ncent. in gross earnings and 53 per cent. in net earnings. If American\r\nlabor is more expensive, it is also more efficient than labor is\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt must also be considered that the average haul in Europe is much less\r\nthan the average haul in the United States. It has always been\r\nmaintained by the railroad companies, and very justly, too, that the\r\nterminal charges are as important a factor of freight rates as is the\r\ncost of carriage. The terminal charges are the same for a\r\ntwenty-five-mile haul as for a thousand-mile haul; they form a\r\ncomparatively large part of the total charges for the former and a very\r\nsmall part of the total charges for the latter. It is therefore\r\nmanifestly unjust to compare the rates per ton per mile of Europe with\r\nthose of the United States without making due allowance for the\r\ndifference in the length of their average hauls. All other things being\r\nequal, a fair comparison between the freight rates of different\r\ncountries should be based upon hauls of equal length.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration which should not be lost sight of. The\r\ncommodities in the United States which contribute principally to the\r\nlong haul are raw products. The universally low rates of these\r\ncommodities greatly lower the general average. In Europe, on the other\r\nhand, manufactured goods predominate as long-haul freight, and based\r\nupon increased risk and increased cost of carriage, considerably swell\r\nthe general average of freight charges. The railroads of the United\r\nStates also do more business per train mile than those of any other\r\ncountry excepting perhaps Austria, Russia and India. This should\r\ncertainly enable them to do business for less than it is done by\r\ntransatlantic lines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, a number of European countries, particularly\r\nFrance, require their railroads to perform large services, such as the\r\ncarrying of the mails and the transportation of the officers and\r\nemployes of the Government, gratuitously, and to carry soldiers at\r\nreduced rates.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in the equation should be considered. European roads are\r\nbuilt, equipped and all permanent improvements wholly made at the\r\nexpense of the stock- and bondholders, while in this country they are\r\npartially constructed at the expense of the patrons of the road. In the\r\nformer case the capitalization of the road represents what has been paid\r\nby the stock- and bondholders, and in the latter, not only what they\r\nhave paid, but large contributions paid from the income of the road and\r\nfrom public and private donations.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that railroad rates ought to be lower, and even\r\nmuch lower, here than in Europe. If it _is_ true that the average rate\r\nper ton per mile is lower in America than across the Atlantic, this is\r\nchiefly due to the fact that water transportation has forced down\r\nthrough (or long-haul) rates and has thus lowered the general average.\r\nThis reduction was by no means made voluntarily by the railway\r\ncompanies, but was forced upon them. Where in the United States water\r\ndoes not exist, as in local traffic, rates are usually much higher than\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in freight rates was brought about by a number of\r\ninventions which greatly lowered the cost of both the construction and\r\nthe operation of railways. Through the introduction of the steam shovel,\r\nof the wheel-scraper, of improved rock-drills, and of other labor-saving\r\nmachines, as well as by a general improvement in the methods of grading,\r\nthe cost of grading has been reduced from 25 to 50 per cent., and\r\nrailroad bridges are now built at one-third of their former cost. Owing\r\nto Bessemer's great invention, steel rails can at the present time be\r\nbought for one-half of what iron rails cost ten or fifteen years ago,\r\nand about one-third of the cost twenty years ago. According to David A.\r\nWells, the author of \"Recent Economic Changes,\" the annual producing\r\ncapacity of a Bessemer converter was increased fourfold between 1873 and\r\n1886, and four men can now make a given product of steel in the same\r\ntime and with less cost of material than it took ten men ten years ago\r\nto accomplish. A ton of steel can now be made with 5,000 pounds of coal,\r\nwhile it required twice that quantity in 1868. When it is considered\r\nthat rails and tires made of steel last three times as long as those\r\nmade of iron, permit greater speed, carry a much larger weight, and\r\nrequire less repairs, the importance to the railroad interests of the\r\nimprovements made in the manufacture of steel can hardly be\r\noverestimated. Similar reductions have been made in the car and machine\r\nshops. An average train to-day probably costs no more than one-half as\r\nmuch as it did twenty years ago. Mr. Wells, in the work just mentioned,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n      \"In 1870-'71 one of the leading railroads of the\r\n      Northwestern United States built 126 miles, which, with some\r\n      tunneling, was bonded for about $40,000 per mile. The same\r\n      road could now (1889) be constructed, with the payment of\r\n      higher wages to laborers of all classes, for about $20,000\r\n      per mile.\"\r\n\r\nA great saving has also been made in the consumption of coal. Under\r\nfavorable circumstances a loaded freight car can now be propelled a mile\r\nwith one pound of coal. A similar economy of fuel has, through the\r\nimprovement of their engines, been effected in ocean steamers. The\r\ninvention of the compound engine has reduced the expense of running\r\nabout one-half, while it has doubled the room left for the cargo. The\r\nstatement has recently been made that a piece of coal half as large as a\r\nwalnut, when burned in the compound engine of a modern steamboat, drives\r\na ton of food and its proportion of the ship one mile on its way to a\r\nforeign port.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the invention of the air-brake has materially reduced the\r\nnumber of train men formerly necessary to safely manage a train, just as\r\nthe introduction of steam-hoisting and other machines, both upon docks\r\nand vessels, has greatly decreased the number of men employed upon the\r\nmercantile marine.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly much similarity between the railroad and the\r\nsteamboat as agencies of transportation. Whatever fuel and labor-saving\r\ncauses operate on one must necessarily operate upon the other. When we,\r\ntherefore, find that the ocean rates are only from one-third to\r\none-fourth of what they were thirty years ago, we are justly surprised\r\nto see railroad rates maintained as high as they are. Operating expenses\r\nhave been greatly reduced and passenger travel has largely increased\r\nduring the past twenty years, but reductions corresponding in the\r\npassenger rates of the United States have not been made.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, no easy matter always to determine what are\r\nreasonable rates. It is easier to tell what rates are unreasonable.\r\nRates are unreasonable that bring an income in excess of sufficient to\r\nkeep the road in proper condition, to pay operating expenses, including\r\ntaxes and a fair rate of interest on the amount, not including\r\ndonations, actually invested in the road. The patrons of a road should\r\nnot be taxed to pay interest on their own donations, or on public\r\ndonations, to the road, as the donations were made for the benefit of\r\nthe public, and not for the benefit of private individuals. A rate which\r\nmay appear reasonable to the carrier is apt to be regarded as too high\r\nby the shipper; and, again, one that seems reasonable to the shipper is\r\ndenounced as too low by the railroad man. Each is tempted to consult\r\nonly his own interests and to disregard the just claims of the other\r\nside. Thus, while the shipper will claim that his rates ought to be low\r\nenough to enable him to compete with other shippers more advantageously\r\nlocated than he is, the railroad manager will demand a rate which would\r\nenable him to declare high dividends on largely fictitious values. The\r\nowners of roads which were built merely for purposes of speculation or\r\nblackmailing insist on being permitted to charge exorbitant rates to\r\nbring up their earnings to the level of those roads for whose\r\nconstruction there was a legitimate demand.\r\n\r\nIt is a settled principle of common law that all rates must be\r\nreasonable, but no uniform rule has as yet been adopted by which the\r\nquestion of reasonableness is to be determined. The doctrine laid down\r\nby Judge Brewer, that \"where the rates prescribed will not pay some\r\ncompensation to the owners, then it is the duty of the courts to\r\ninterfere and protect the companies from such rates,\" and that\r\n\"compensation implies three things: cost of service, interest on bonds,\r\nand then some dividends,\" is absurd. A question is never settled until\r\nit is settled right, and this rule is certainly open to very serious\r\nobjections. A road may be bonded for several times its cost or its real\r\nvalue, it may be managed with such recklessness or extravagance that its\r\noperating expenses may be twice what they would be under a careful and\r\neconomical management, yet under this rule the shipper must pay the\r\npremium which bond-watering and bad management command. The general\r\nenforcement of such a rule would place the public at the mercy of\r\nscheming railroad manipulators. No matter to what extent the business of\r\na road may increase, a reduction of rates can always be prevented by the\r\nissue of new bonds and the doubling of the already lordly salaries of\r\nits managers. Again, under the operation of this rule a road which\r\nentirely suffices to do the business between two points may be\r\nparalleled by another and the public be compelled to pay excessive rates\r\nto maintain both. It might be said that the public cannot be forced to\r\npatronize any road, that if it would not withdraw its patronage from the\r\nold line, the new line would soon become bankrupt, and that in such an\r\nevent its owners, and not the public, would be the sufferers. This\r\nargument may be met by the statement that, aside from the fact that\r\nconcerted action among a large number of people can never be secured,\r\nfew roads rely for their support solely upon local business, and that\r\nany loss which the older road sustains from encroachments by its rival\r\nupon its through traffic it is compelled to make up by raising its rates\r\nupon its local business. It is the almost inevitable consequence when\r\none road is paralleled by another that the business which was\r\npreviously done by one road will be nearly equally divided between the\r\ntwo, and under the rule laid down by Judge Brewer the public will be\r\ncalled upon to pay the operating expenses and the interest on the bonds\r\nof both, together with such dividends on the stock as the financiering\r\nability of their managers may secure. The better judgment seems to be\r\nthat to determine what are reasonable rates is not a question for\r\njudicial adjudication.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission, in their fourth annual report,\r\nassert that \"there can be no standard of expense which the courts can\r\nact upon and apply, but that the whole field is one of judgment in the\r\nexercise of a reasonable discretion by the managing powers, or by the\r\npublic authorities in reviewing their action.\" Their views upon this\r\nsubject are still more definitely stated in the following words\r\ncontained in the same report:\r\n\r\n      \"An attempt is made to give authority to the courts to\r\n      interfere by the suggestion that property or charter\r\n      contract rights, or both, are involved in the matter of\r\n      fixing rates, and therefore that it is not possible the\r\n      conclusions of administrative boards should be final. This\r\n      is an endeavor, by the mere use of words, to confer\r\n      jurisdiction upon the courts where the substance is\r\n      altogether wanting. Property or contract rights are involved\r\n      in these cases precisely as they are in numerous other cases\r\n      of the exercise of power under the police authority of the\r\n      State, either by the State itself or by its municipalities.\"\r\n\r\nThese views cannot fail to commend themselves to any unprejudiced mind.\r\nIt is a well-established fact that all officials will, if permitted,\r\nextend their jurisdiction, and judges are no exception to the rule. It\r\nwas therefore but natural that the courts should attempt to solve the\r\nproblem of railroad rates.\r\n\r\nThe attempt so far has been fruitless, nor will it be otherwise as long\r\nas the courts persist in approaching with abstract legal maxims a\r\nquestion which, above all things, requires the light of experience and\r\nthe exercise of sound discretion. The question of railroad rates will\r\nnever be satisfactorily settled until it is definitely referred to\r\nexpert administrative State and National boards empowered and prepared\r\nto meet the many contingencies that will always arise in the\r\ntransportation business.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to account for the inability of the courts to\r\nproperly adjudicate the question of reasonable rates. The legislature,\r\nor a board to which it has delegated its power, prescribes for a\r\nrailroad company a classification and tariff. The company claims that\r\nthe rates so fixed are unreasonably low and applies to the courts for\r\nredress.\r\n\r\nNow, if the rates were based upon the cost of service only, it might,\r\nperhaps, be possible for a court to determine whether the prescribed\r\nrates are adequate or not. But even in such a case the question would\r\narise whether the capitalization and the operating expenses of the road\r\nare not excessive, and its determination would require expert knowledge\r\nand sound discretion rather than legal lore. However, since the cost of\r\nservice is not the only, and with railroad men not even an essential,\r\nfactor in rate-making, it is evident that the rates upon single\r\ncommodities can not be reviewed upon their individual merits, but the\r\ntariff must, in the judicial determination of the question whether it is\r\nreasonable or not, be viewed as a whole. But as it is impossible to\r\nforetell what effect a readjusted tariff would have on the revenues of a\r\nroad, even courts are forced to admit that an actual trial of the tariff\r\nis necessary to establish its merits or demerits.\r\n\r\nIf the complaining company were as anxious to give the new tariff a fair\r\ntrial as it usually is to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court\r\nthat it is devoid of every principle of justice, such a test might be\r\naccepted by the public as a reliable basis of judicial procedure. But\r\nrailroad managers are not only striving to perpetuate their own high\r\nrates, but to show to the public that freight tariffs not emanating from\r\na railroad company's office are of necessity crude and unjust to the\r\ncarrier. They know that if they should succeed in convincing the public\r\nthat administrative boards are incapable of dealing with that question,\r\nthey might for years to come be left in undisputed possession of the\r\npower to make their own rates. This is certainly for the railroad\r\nmanager a prize worth contending for, and no sacrifice is too great for\r\nhim to make when there is any hope of ultimate victory. Being absolutely\r\nuncontrolled in his action, he finds it an easy matter, by temporarily\r\ndiverting business from his line, by the increase of operating expenses\r\nand by repressing growing industries, and in many other ways, to curtail\r\nthe business of his road and diminish its revenues. He can court losses\r\nin a thousand different ways discernible neither to the courts nor the\r\ngeneral public. In short, it is in the power of any railroad manager to\r\nmanipulate such a trial in his own interest, and, if determined, to\r\nobtain a verdict against any tariff not of his own making. This policy\r\nwas pursued by several Iowa roads subsequent to Judge Brewer's decision\r\nthat the alleged unreasonableness of the Iowa commissioners' tariff must\r\nbe established by an actual trial, and was persevered in until the suit\r\nwas withdrawn.\r\n\r\nBut even if the competency of the courts to properly determine such\r\nquestions were admitted, there would still exist one serious objection\r\nto their jurisdiction. Courts necessarily move slowly, while all\r\ndifferences arising between the public and the railways, and especially\r\nthose concerning rates of transportation, require prompt and decisive\r\naction. There are no fixed conditions in commerce. It is a kaleidoscope\r\nconstantly presenting new phases. Competition at home and abroad, tariff\r\nduties, the condition of the crops and a thousand other influences\r\naffect it and may require a prompt readjustment of the tariff. So long\r\nas railroad companies are permitted to resort to injunctions and effect\r\nother delays rendered possible through the machinery of the courts, to\r\nprevent for years the enforcement of tariffs prescribed by\r\nadministrative authorities, so long will the public be at their mercy.\r\nSo long as they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by a\r\njudicial contest, it will be their policy to delay through the courts\r\nthe enforcement of any tariff, whether prescribed by legislature or by\r\nan authorized commission, that falls below their standard. It is not to\r\nbe understood that the acts of railroad commissioners should never be\r\nsubject to a judicial view. If such boards clearly exceed their\r\nauthority or are otherwise guilty of maladministration, if they violate\r\nconstitutional rights, then railroad companies, if injured by their\r\nacts, should be permitted to seek redress in the courts; but they should\r\nnot be permitted to nullify an official tariff by legal maneuvers. It is\r\nclearly not within the province of the courts to make rates or to lay\r\ndown rules to be followed by those to whom the law has delegated the\r\npower to make them, nor should the courts aid the railroads in any\r\nattempt to nullify an official tariff that has been legally promulgated.\r\nA tariff prepared by sworn and disinterested officials is more likely to\r\nbe just than one prepared by interested railroad men, and railroad\r\ncompanies should be compelled to adopt it and continue it in use until\r\nit is amended or revoked by legal authority.\r\n\r\nIndividual shippers are powerless as against strong corporations.\r\nRailroads apply to the courts for what they are pleased to term redress,\r\nand in the meantime refuse with impunity to accept an official tariff;\r\nbut the shipper has no protection: he must pay their rates or go out of\r\nbusiness. What reason can be assigned why the weaker should thus be\r\ndiscriminated against? A promulgation of a tariff prepared by a\r\ncommission is equivalent to a declaration on the part of these officials\r\nthat the rates or some of the rates charged by the railroads are\r\nunreasonably high. The railroad, in applying to the courts for\r\nprotection, claims that the tariff prescribed by the commission is\r\nunreasonably low. Both tariffs are therefore impeached, one being that\r\nof an interested private company, the other that of a disinterested\r\npublic board. It is evident that, even if the people should see fit to\r\ngive the courts jurisdiction in such controversies, one of these tariffs\r\nmust temporarily prevail pending the decision of the court, and sound\r\npublic policy and justice to the patrons of the road certainly require\r\nthat the official tariff be recognized by the courts and made to be\r\nrespected by the railroad company until it is proved to be unreasonable\r\nand is set aside by lawful authority.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by railroad men that they should be allowed to make their\r\nown tariffs because rate-making is so intricate a subject that none but\r\nrailroad experts can do it justice. If this were so the courts would be\r\neven less competent to review a schedule of rates than a State or\r\nNational commission would be to make one. Courts cannot be expected to\r\nhave expert knowledge in all matters that are likely to be brought\r\nbefore them. They must rely upon the testimony of expert witnesses\r\nwhenever technical questions are involved in the determination of cases.\r\nThe identical sources of information from which courts draw are\r\naccessible, or may be made accessible, to a commission, which has the\r\nadditional advantage that its members may be selected with special\r\nreference to their fitness for the duties which they will be called upon\r\nto perform and are expected to devote their whole time to the settlement\r\nof questions arising in the transportation business. Such a commission\r\ncan practically be made a court with jurisdiction over all matters\r\nconnected with railroad business. The railroad manager, no doubt, is\r\nthoroughly familiar with the wants and desires of his company; but it\r\nmay fairly be presumed that he is less familiar with the needs of the\r\npublic than a railroad commission whose members are in constant\r\ncommunication with the people, patiently listen to the complaints of\r\nshippers, court and receive suggestions as to needed changes in\r\nclassification and rates, and study the relative advantages of the\r\ndifferent sections and different interests of the State or the country\r\nas regards transportation. A railroad freight agent, on the contrary, is\r\ndisposed to think that shippers ought to be satisfied with any rate\r\nlower than those charged fifty years ago for carting or other crude\r\nmethods of transportation. He regards their views and suggestions as\r\nchimerical and not worthy of any notice, and does not even hesitate to\r\ninform them that rate-making is a branch of the railroad business wholly\r\nbeyond their comprehension, and ought not to be meddled with or even\r\ninquired into by the public. The general freight agent is the employe of\r\na company which rates his usefulness solely by his ability to constantly\r\nincrease its revenues, and he invariably proceeds upon the theory that\r\nthe best tariff is that which comes nearest imposing upon each commodity\r\noffered for carriage the maximum transportation tax that it will bear. A\r\nman who entertains such opinions cannot be supposed to be able to do\r\njustice to the shipper, and should not be permitted to act as arbitrator\r\nin rate controversies between the public and the company whose employe\r\nand advocate he is. Nor have we any reason to hope for a change in the\r\npresent tariff policy of railroads. History has sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated the fact that reforms must come from without. As long as\r\nhuman nature remains as it is, railroad officials will, if permitted,\r\narrange tariffs in the interest of the men who give them employment, for\r\nif they did otherwise their services would soon be dispensed with. A\r\nfreight tariff should be in the nature of a contract between the carrier\r\nand the shipper, and the assent of both parties ought to be essential to\r\nits validity. But as it is impracticable for all the parties interested\r\nto meet for the purpose of effecting an agreement, the power to make\r\nrates has in several States wisely been conferred upon railroad\r\ncommissioners, and there is a strong tendency in others to adopt the\r\nsame policy. Such boards have every opportunity to obtain any\r\ninformation needed for the efficient and faithful discharge of their\r\nduties. They can hear the representatives of the railroads as well as\r\nthose of the shippers, investigate carefully disputed points, summon\r\nexperts and witnesses, and obtain official information relating to\r\nclassifications and rates from every State in the Union, and, if\r\nnecessary, from every quarter of the civilized world. The assertion may\r\nsafely be made that, with experience, a commission acquires more expert\r\nknowledge relating to the business of rate-making than a railroad\r\nmanager. If there is any mystery connected with the business of\r\nrate-making which has so far been in the sole possession of railroad\r\nmen, it is to their interest to initiate the commissioners into their\r\nprofound secrets. It will be their privilege to enlighten the\r\ncommissioners as to the actual cost of their respective lines, the cost\r\nof every branch of the railway service, and as to a thousand other\r\nmatters which the public has both a desire and a right to know. If,\r\nafter a schedule of rates has been prepared, and before it is\r\npromulgated, railroad men can suggest any improvement in it, they should\r\nhave the privilege to do so; or if, after giving it a fair trial, they\r\nshould be prepared to show that any rate is unreasonably low and\r\ninjurious to them, their complaint should be carefully investigated,\r\nand, if found well grounded, the wrong should at once be righted.\r\n\r\nBut the same privileges should be extended to shippers. Their rights and\r\ntheir welfare should be guarded as sacredly as those of the railroad\r\ncompanies. They should have the same opportunity to examine a proposed\r\nschedule before its promulgation and protest against any feature of it\r\nwhich they may regard prejudicial to their interests, and their\r\nstatements should receive the same consideration as is accorded to those\r\nof representatives of the railroad companies. So, likewise, when\r\nshippers prove to the satisfaction of the commission that a rate has\r\noutlived its reasonableness, their complaints should at once be\r\ninvestigated, and if their cause is found to be a just one, the tariff\r\nshould be so amended as to give them relief.\r\n\r\nThe labors of a board of railroad commissioners are onerous, and their\r\nresponsibility is great. No uniform rule can be laid down for their\r\nguidance in the fixing of rates, yet there are a few fundamental\r\nprinciples which should always be adhered to. The cost of service\r\nshould invariably be an important factor of a rate. Railroads should not\r\nbe compelled to carry any commodity for less than the actual cost of\r\nmoving it, nor should rates be fixed greatly in excess of such cost of\r\nservice. The carload should be the unit of wholesale shipments. Since it\r\ncosts the railroad company as much to move ten carloads of freight which\r\nbelong to one shipper as it costs to move ten carloads belonging to ten\r\nshippers, no advantage beyond the general carload rate should be given\r\nto the large shipper. The difference in the rates between shipments in\r\nless than carload lots ought to be determined solely by the difference\r\nin the cost of carriage and handling. Where shipments are made in\r\ncarload lots, the loading and unloading is usually done by the shipper\r\nand consignee, cars are loaded to their full capacity, and no loading or\r\nunloading of shipments at intermediate points is necessary. It is\r\ntherefore but just that the consignor and consignee should have the\r\nbenefit of the reduced cost of such shipments. Raw materials, and\r\nespecially coal and lumber and kindred articles, the transportation of\r\nwhich requires neither an expensive rolling stock nor warehouse\r\naccommodations nor speedy movement, and in which the risk of loss or\r\ndamage is insignificant, should be carried at the lowest rate possible.\r\nSuch a policy will tend to foster other interests, which will develop\r\nbusiness for the road and will build up remote sections of the country,\r\nand will often enable railroads to carry large quantities of these\r\ncommodities at times when they would otherwise be nearly idle. There\r\nshould be a uniform classification throughout the country, based upon\r\nconsiderations of justice and equity instead of railroad tradition. Such\r\narticles should be classed together as resemble each other as concerns\r\nbulk, weight and risk, or what is virtually the same, cost of carrying\r\nand handling. It may be safely assumed that a rate which has been made\r\nand used by railroad companies is remunerative. If it is claimed by\r\nrailroad men that it is not, the burden of proof should rest upon them.\r\nA rate may also be considered remunerative to a road if other lines\r\nsimilarly situated have voluntarily adopted it. A schedule finally must\r\nbe considered reasonable if it enables the company for which it is\r\nprescribed to earn under efficient and economical management sufficient\r\nto maintain its road in proper condition and a fair rate of interest\r\nupon a fair valuation of its road. Property is never worth more than\r\nwhat it can be duplicated for, and railroad property is no exception to\r\nthe rule. If there has been a depreciation in the property of a company,\r\nit should not demand dividends upon values which no longer exist. Nor\r\ncan the same returns be conceded to railroad property as to private\r\ncapital. Its investment is permanent and well secured, if it is honestly\r\nand intelligently made; and its dividends are net returns after the\r\npayment of all expenses, including taxes, cost of management and\r\nmaintenance. The three per cent. bonds of the United States Government\r\nfind a ready sale at prices above par. Were there less speculation and\r\nmore honesty and stability in railroad management, railroad securities\r\nyielding a revenue of from 2-1/2 to 4 per cent. on the actual investment\r\nwould be eagerly sought after by conservative capitalists.\r\n\r\nRate-making requires honesty of purpose, intelligence and discretion,\r\nqualities as likely to be found among the servants of the people as\r\namong those of corporations. A commission may err, but its errors are\r\nnot likely to prove as detrimental to the railroad companies as the\r\nextortionate and discriminating rates imposed by railroad managers have\r\nproved to the interests of the public. Railroad managers acknowledge no\r\nobligation except that of earning dividends for their companies, while\r\nthe members of a railroad commission, on the contrary, are responsible\r\nfor their acts to the people, with us the source of all government and\r\nall power. To question the justice and sincerity of the people, or to\r\ndeny the efficacy of such a control, is to deny the wisdom of popular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nRailroads might be permitted to reduce their rates below the official\r\ntariff, but they should be required to give at least thirty days' notice\r\nof such a change, to enable shippers to prepare for it. The companies\r\nshould not be permitted, however, to raise rates again without obtaining\r\nthe commissioners' consent and giving at least two months' notice of the\r\nproposed advance. Sudden fluctuations in rates are a fruitful source of\r\ndisaster in those branches of business in which the cost of\r\ntransportation forms an important factor in the price of commodities,\r\nand are as unjust and unwarrantable as would be fluctuations in import\r\nduties. As long as they are tolerated there can be no reliable basis for\r\nbusiness calculations or contracts. There is little doubt that, were\r\nsuch regulations enforced, railroad wars, so demoralizing to the\r\nbusiness of the country, would soon belong to the things of the past,\r\nand a far-reaching assurance of future welfare would be given to the\r\ncommercial, manufacturing and all other legitimate interests of the\r\ncountry. It should always be kept in view by the rate-making power that\r\nthe railroad company, like the gas company, the water company and the\r\nstreet car company, is acting in the capacity of a public agent, and the\r\nrate of compensation should be fixed by public authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railroad in America is still in its infancy, both as regards extent\r\nof mileage and methods of operation. In 1860 the United States had in\r\nround numbers 30,000 miles of road; in 1870 this number had increased to\r\n53,000; in 1880 to 93,000, and in 1890 to 167,000. It will thus be seen\r\nthat the average increase during each of those three decades was nearly\r\n80 per cent. Should this rate of increase continue during the next three\r\ndecades there would be in the present territory of the United States a\r\nlittle over three hundred thousand miles in 1900, 550,000 miles in 1910\r\nand close to one million miles in 1920, or about one mile of road for\r\nevery three miles of territory. It is not likely that the rate of\r\nincrease of the past will continue in the future; but even if this\r\nshould be reduced from 80 to 40 per cent. it would be less than\r\nfifty-five years when the railroad mileage of the United States would\r\nreach the million point.\r\n\r\nEven this might seem an extravagant estimate, but it must be remembered\r\nthat there are already a number of States in the Union with a railroad\r\nmileage closely approaching this proportion. The District of Columbia\r\nhas one mile of road for every 3.39 square miles of territory, New\r\nJersey for every 3.79, Massachusetts for every 3.96, and Connecticut for\r\nevery 4.96 square miles. Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Illinois\r\nfollow with one mile of railroad for every 5.14, 5.20, 5.57 and 5.59\r\nsquare miles of territory, respectively, and Indiana, New York, Delaware\r\nand Iowa are not far behind them.\r\n\r\nIt should also be borne in mind that many of the through lines have\r\ndouble, some triple, and some even quadruple tracks, which, if taken\r\ninto the account, would increase the mileage much more; and still\r\nrailroad construction in most of these States is far from being at a\r\nstandstill. The United States will eventually be able to sustain a\r\ncloser net of railways than any country in Europe, and we may rest\r\nassured that the time will come when the fertile prairie States of the\r\nNorthwest will have a mile of railroad for every square mile of\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn view of the future magnitude of the transportation interest the\r\nimportance of placing its control and management early upon sound\r\nprinciples should not be under-estimated. Abuses crept into railroad\r\nmanagement in the past, not because the men who controlled it were\r\nnecessarily worse than men engaged in other pursuits, but because the\r\nStates failed to provide adequate legislation for the control of this\r\nnew social and commercial force, and the license enjoyed by railroad men\r\ngradually turned into serious evils what seemed at first only harmless\r\npractices. It cannot be denied, however, that the absence of restraint\r\nin time attracted to the business unscrupulous men whose sharp practices\r\nfrequently forced their colleagues of better conscience to do what their\r\nsense of honor and justice condemned. These evils and abuses have\r\nincreased with the growth of the railroad system, and nothing short of\r\nthe sovereign power can now correct them. It is incumbent upon the state\r\nnot only to correct the evils of the past, but to base legislative\r\ncontrol of railroads upon principles so wise and so broad as to endure\r\nfor ages, permitting the unlimited growth of the system and at the same\r\ntime insuring commercial liberty and prosperity to the generations to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAs it is always easier to tear down than to build up, so it is likewise\r\neasier to point out evils than it is to provide proper remedies for\r\ntheir cure. Almost any one can criticise existing conditions, but it\r\nrequires wise and constructive statesmanship to propose practical\r\nmeasures which will bring about desired improvement. The apparent\r\nmagnitude of the work of correcting the evils and abuses connected with\r\nthe transportation business, many of which have been in vogue for more\r\nthan a generation, has discouraged many from seriously undertaking it.\r\nAnd yet we shall find the problem by no means a difficult one, if we\r\nproperly analyze it and go to the root of the evil. Prof. Bryce, in his\r\nwork \"The American Commonwealth,\" refers to the fact that the people of\r\nthis country have been equal to the task of solving the gravest problems\r\nwhich have been presented to them, and we need have no doubt of their\r\nability to solve the railroad problem. Railroad regulation does not\r\nrequire the adoption of any new principle of law. If the common law is\r\nrightly applied and provision is made for its strict and systematic\r\nenforcement, it will meet every condition that is likely to arise in the\r\ntransportation business. It should always be remembered that the\r\nrailroad is an improved highway, and the principal reason for which it\r\nis built is to accommodate the people and promote their welfare, and not\r\nto serve the selfish ends of a few individuals, and that private\r\ncompanies were permitted to build and operate it only because the State\r\nbelieved that the public interests could best be served in this way.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the duties of the State to facilitate transportation by\r\nestablishing highways. These highways may be built by the State directly\r\nor through municipalities or even private corporations. Thus, under\r\nauthority derived from the State, cities lay out, construct and\r\nmaintain streets within their limits. But these streets become public\r\nand are always subject to State control. The same rule applies to\r\nturnpikes and ferries. Although the State transfers to an individual or\r\na company its right to maintain a ferry or to build and maintain a\r\nturnpike, and to compensate itself for its outlay by the collection of\r\ntolls, the ferry and turnpike nevertheless remain highways, subject to\r\nthe control of the State.\r\n\r\nThe railroad partakes of two natures, that of a highway and that of a\r\ncommon carrier. Railroad companies therefore enjoy the privileges and\r\nassume the duties of both. The State justly exercises in behalf of such\r\ncompanies the right of eminent domain, _i. e._, the right of the\r\nsovereign to apply private property to public use; but it cannot\r\nrightfully appropriate private property for private use, even if legal\r\ncompensation were to be made for it. It is only upon the theory that\r\nrailroads are highways, constructed for the public good and subject to\r\npublic control, that the State has authorized railroad companies to take\r\nprivate property for their own use by paying for it a reasonable\r\ncompensation. A railroad may even take possession of and intersect a\r\npublic road for the purpose of carrying on its functions. But while the\r\nsovereign may exercise the right of eminent domain, it cannot delegate\r\nit to any individual or number of individuals, except to its agents,\r\nperforming its functions and being bound to comply with any rule which\r\nmay be prescribed for the public good. Under the common law the\r\nindividual is entitled to as full use of the railroad as he is of the\r\ncommon highway. If he is not allowed to put on his own vehicle, this\r\nrestriction is simply due to the fact that the people believe that the\r\nbusiness can be done most safely, most economically and most\r\nefficiently by one company or a limited number of companies operating\r\nthe road for a reasonable compensation. Nor does this restriction differ\r\nmaterially from that which the law has placed upon the use of the common\r\nroad. Without legislative sanction no one has a right to put upon it a\r\nteam of elephants or a locomotive and train of cars, or other strange\r\nmotors, and thereby obstruct the public travel. These restrictions might\r\nbe removed by the legislative power, and there is also no doubt that\r\nunder the common law the State has the right to permit the independent\r\nuse of the railroad track by any person having motive power and cars\r\nadapted to it. The persons and freight transported on the railroad are\r\ntaxed to maintain it, while in the case of the common road this tax is\r\nplaced upon the people and the adjoining property. How to collect the\r\ntax necessary to sustain the road is simply a question of public policy,\r\nand it cannot be collected in any case except with the expressed\r\npermission of the State. If a company is permitted by the State to\r\noperate a railroad it should only be permitted to collect such tolls as\r\nare just and reasonable, and what is just and reasonable should be\r\ndetermined by the sovereign State, and not by the operating company. The\r\nrailroads of the United States collect from our people in round numbers\r\na transportation tax of eleven hundred million dollars annually. This\r\ntax is equal to a levy of $17 per head, or $85 per family; it is about\r\nas large as all our other taxes combined. In the State of Iowa it\r\namounts to about $22 per head, or $110 per family, and is two and\r\none-half times as large as all the State, county, school and municipal\r\ntaxes collected within her borders.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider how thoroughly other public charges are hedged about,\r\nby careful restrictions and limitations, and with what caution the\r\namount to be collected is fixed after thorough public discussion, by\r\nagents of the people selected by them to serve only for short periods,\r\nand that those who collect and disburse the funds are under oath and\r\nbonds for a faithful performance of their duty, is it not preposterous\r\nto permit agents appointed by a few interested persons, and often\r\nserving for a long term of years, without any responsibility to the\r\npublic, to fix the rate of this tax, and to collect and disburse the\r\nimmense sums levied for the support of these highways without any\r\nsupervision or restraint?\r\n\r\nThe Government might as well lease the post-office, waterways and the\r\ncollection of import duties to the highest bidder and permit the lessees\r\nto reimburse themselves by the collection of such tolls as they might\r\nsee fit, without any governmental restraint whatever, their franchises\r\nenabling the operating companies to tax each individual, each locality\r\nand each letter, parcel or article as they saw fit. How long would the\r\npeople of this country endure such a condition of things? The collection\r\nof taxes has been farmed out, but not by any civilized nation in modern\r\ntimes. History shows that this system of taxation has always been\r\nproductive of the gravest abuses, and prejudicial to the public welfare.\r\nAs has already been shown, the railroad is an improved highway, and the\r\nrailroad company in operating it is doing a public business and not a\r\nprivate business, and therefore it should be governed by rules\r\napplicable to public business, and not such as are applicable to private\r\nbusiness. It is admitted by all that for the services which it performs\r\nthe operating company should receive a reasonable compensation; but to\r\nsay what a reasonable compensation is, how it shall be collected, and to\r\nprescribe rules regulating the business of the public carrier, is\r\nsolely the right and the duty of the State. The people have never\r\npermitted the rate of any other public charge to be fixed by the\r\nbeneficiary. Why, then, should privileges be conceded to one beneficiary\r\nwhich are denied to all others?\r\n\r\nThe assertion is often made by railroad managers that railroad\r\ntransportation is a private business as much as any other branch of\r\ncommerce. It is not likely that these same managers would wish to have\r\ntheir argument carried to its logical conclusion, for, should the courts\r\nat any time take their view, they would be under the necessity of\r\ndeclaring null and void all their charters, which were granted to them\r\nupon the assumption that the railroad was a highway operated under the\r\nauthority and control of the State by private companies for the public\r\ngood. If, on the other hand, railroad managers are, for their own\r\nprotection, forced to recognize the public character of railroads, they\r\ncan no longer question the right of the State to so control their\r\nbusiness as the public good may demand. And this shows the absurdity of\r\nthe claim often made by railroad managers, that, as long as the rates\r\ncharged by them are reasonable, the State has no right to interfere with\r\ntheir business, or, in other words, that they may discriminate between\r\nindividuals and localities, and that they may legally practice a\r\nthousand other abuses as long as individual shippers find it beyond\r\ntheir power to prove that they have been charged exorbitant rates.\r\n\r\nCharles Fisk Beach, Jr., in his \"Commentaries on the Law of Private\r\nCorporations,\" lays it down as a general principle of law that \"whenever\r\nany person pursues a public calling and sustains such relations to the\r\npublic that the people must of necessity deal with him, and are under a\r\nmoral duress to submit to his terms if he is unrestrained by law, then,\r\nin order to prevent extortion and an abuse of his position, the price he\r\nmay charge for his services may be regulated by law.\" And applying this\r\nprinciple to common carriers, and especially railroads, this author\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n      \"The sovereign has always assumed peculiar control over\r\n      common carriers as conducting a business in which the public\r\n      has an interest, and in the case of railway carriers an\r\n      additional basis of governmental control is grounded in the\r\n      extraordinary franchise of eminent domain conferred upon\r\n      these companies. For corporations engaged in carrying goods\r\n      for hire as common carriers have no right to discriminate in\r\n      freight rates in favor of one shipper, even when necessary\r\n      to secure his custom, if the discriminating rate will tend\r\n      to create a monopoly by excluding from their proper markets\r\n      the products of the competitors of the favored shipper.\"\r\n\r\nIf railroads had no obligations or advantages beyond those of other\r\ncommon carriers, such as stage lines and steamship companies, their\r\ndiscriminations might be less objectionable, but, as keepers of the\r\ntoll-gates of the public highways, they are no more at liberty to\r\nregulate their own business regardless of the public welfare than were\r\ntheir predecessors, the toll-collectors stationed along the public\r\nturnpikes and canals. As such public tax-collectors they are bound to\r\ngive equal treatment to all persons and places.\r\n\r\nAlthough the business of constructing and keeping in repair the turnpike\r\nroads was, as a rule, left to private persons, and the promoters of such\r\nenterprises were permitted to reimburse themselves for their outlay by\r\nthe collection of tolls, their schedules of tolls were prescribed by the\r\nState and their business was placed under the supervision of public\r\nofficers, whose duty it was to see that neither extortion nor\r\ndiscrimination was practiced in the collection of these tolls, and that\r\nthe private management of a public business did not become the source of\r\nabuse. The State thus insisted upon exercising a restraining influence\r\nover the business of turnpike companies because it realized the danger\r\nof entrusting the management of a semi-public business to companies\r\norganized solely for private gain, with officers responsible only to\r\ntheir stockholders, who, under ordinary circumstances, could be relied\r\nupon to measure the usefulness of an employe by his ability to\r\ncontribute to the increase of the annual dividends. It will scarcely be\r\nclaimed, even by railroad men, that since the days of turnpikes and\r\nstage-coaches corporations have become more unselfish and their officers\r\nless servile. The temptations have increased, while human frailty\r\nremains the same.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we consult the railroad managers as to the best policy to\r\nbe adopted for the future control of railroad companies, we shall be\r\ninformed that we have already gone too far in railroad legislation, that\r\nnearly all the present evils of transportation of which the public and\r\nthe railroad companies complain may be traced to legislative\r\nrestrictions, and especially to certain features of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act. They reluctantly admit that this act has been instrumental\r\nfor good inasmuch as it has corrected some of the abuses that formerly\r\nexisted, but they insist that several of its provisions are too radical\r\nand do infinitely more harm than good, both to the railroad companies\r\nand the people; that these obnoxious provisions ought to be repealed,\r\nand that under such restrictions as would still remain railroad\r\ncompanies ought to be permitted to manage their own business. If we\r\ninquire what modification of the Interstate Commerce Act the railroads\r\ndesire, we find that if the act were amended in conformity with their\r\nwishes there would be little of it left that is of value. But the\r\nfeatures which are specially obnoxious to them are the long and short\r\nhaul and the anti-pooling clauses. They even go so far as to demand that\r\nthe Government should not only permit pooling, but should use its strong\r\narm to enforce all pooling contracts which railroad companies might see\r\nfit to enter into. This means, in other words, that the Government\r\nshould enforce an agreement to restrict competition, which is made in\r\ndirect violation of the common law, and aid the companies in maintaining\r\nsuch rates as they see fit to establish. If the railroad manager is\r\ncross-examined and forced to confess the truth, he will have to admit\r\nthat what he really desires is freedom from all restraint, or, if public\r\nopinion will not tolerate this, then only law enough in letter to\r\nsatisfy a public clamor and permit him to violate its spirit, and to\r\nthen trust to him and the future to bring it into disrepute and cause\r\nits repeal.\r\n\r\nSome shrewd managers have recently expressed a willingness to submit\r\ntheir pooling arrangements to a public commission for approval, before\r\nthey should go into effect. This is objectionable on the ground that\r\nthey would then, more even than before, endeavor to control the making\r\nof the commission. It is far safer to absolutely prohibit pooling and\r\nall devices used as a substitute for it. No necessity for pooling\r\nexists, and no good reason can be given why it should be permitted\r\nunless complete government control is established.\r\n\r\nState control of railroad transportation is as essential to the welfare\r\nof the companies as it is to that of the public. The history of the past\r\ntwenty years has shown that railroad companies are utterly unable to\r\nregulate their relations with each other. They either cannot arrive at\r\nan understanding, and then the stronger companies resort to hostilities\r\nto bring the weaker ones to their terms; or, when an agreement has been\r\nreached among them, they find themselves unable to enforce it. Anarchy\r\nthen reigns supreme, until finally a truce is patched up, to be again\r\nfollowed by evasions, defiance and \"war.\" The nature of the railroad\r\nbusiness is in fact such that, in the absence of strict State control,\r\nit is impossible for a conscientious manager to retain the business to\r\nwhich his road is naturally entitled, and do full justice to both the\r\npatrons and the stockholders of his road. Efforts have been made again\r\nand again by railroad companies to regulate their affairs and adjust\r\ntheir difficulties by resorting to pools, agreements, associations and\r\ncombinations, formed with all the ingenuity of which men are capable,\r\nand supported by penalties and fines; but the unscrupulous railroad\r\nmanager has always found a way to violate or subvert the agreement.\r\nThere is a disposition among railroad companies to arrogate all the\r\npowers of sovereignty. They want to make their own laws, impose fines\r\nand declare war, and often go even so far as to openly defy the power of\r\nthe State that has given them their existence.\r\n\r\nWhen railroad managers are shorn of the power to practice abuses, they\r\nare at the same time deprived of the many advantages they now have to\r\nspeculate in railroad securities and enrich themselves at the expense of\r\nthe public and of other railroad stockholders. The great fortunes of\r\nthis country have been amassed within a few years, and chiefly from\r\nmanipulations of railroad property. If the people permit these practices\r\nto go on without restraint but a few years more, the property of the\r\nnation will be largely under the control of a few bold adventurers. The\r\ngreat fortunes of Europe which it has required centuries to accumulate\r\nare already outstripped by the \"self-made\" millionaires of this country.\r\nHowever persistently railroad managers may assure the people that abuses\r\nin the transportation business have been reduced to a minimum and that\r\nmore stringent legislation will be an evil, it is a fact that many of\r\nthe graver railroad abuses are still practiced and that much more\r\nreformation is needed in railroad management, or in railroad\r\nsupervision, or in both, to make the railroad what it was designed to\r\nbe, a highway operated for the public and open to all upon equal and\r\nequitable terms.\r\n\r\nThe virtual ruler of the United States is public opinion. It is the\r\npower that controls the legislative as well as the executive and\r\njudicial departments of the Government. Enactments of legislatures and\r\nof Congress and decisions of the courts, even of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, not in harmony with an intelligent and determined\r\npublic opinion, cannot endure, and executives not in accord with the\r\nmasses of the people cannot long retain public confidence or official\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances no reform movement has any prospect of success\r\nunless it is supported by public opinion. It should therefore be the\r\nprincipal endeavor of all advocates of railroad reform to create public\r\nopinion in favor of the measures proposed by them. With an intelligent\r\npublic on the alert, the Government may be relied upon to pursue a\r\nhealthy and progressive railroad policy. Unfortunately, there are times\r\nwhen public opinion upon great questions is dormant, while pecuniary\r\ninterests, like the force of gravity, never suspend their action. To\r\narouse the masses at such times, we must rely largely upon an honest,\r\nindependent and courageous press, not influenced by gift or patronage.\r\n\r\nMany plans have been proposed for a better control of railroads. Some of\r\nthese are merely theoretical; others have been tried in part, and a few\r\nhave been tried in their entirety, but under circumstances radically\r\ndifferent from those surrounding us. A system which may be well adapted\r\nto a monarchy with a centralization of governmental powers would\r\nprobably prove a failure here, when brought in contact with the\r\nprinciples of dual sovereignty and local rule. Unless a revolution\r\nshould change our system of government, a dual system of railroad\r\ncontrol will always be necessary in the United States; for it is not at\r\nall likely that the individual States will ever voluntarily give up\r\ntheir right to regulate commerce carried on within their respective\r\nborders. On the other hand, the common welfare requires that the\r\ncommerce which is carried on between the States should not be hampered\r\nby local interference, but should be regulated only by Congress. Our\r\nexperience as a nation has shown that such a quality of sovereignty is\r\nnot inconsistent with strength or efficiency, nor need it be productive\r\nof rivalry or friction. The fact that a certain mode of railroad\r\nmanagement has been successful elsewhere is not sufficient proof that it\r\nwould be successful here, nor is the fact that it has not been\r\nsuccessful elsewhere sufficient proof that it would not be successful\r\nhere. The more the conditions which exist here resemble those under\r\nwhich it was tested, the greater is the probability that it can be\r\nadapted to our circumstances. Independent thought and action is an\r\nessential element of progress, yet it is the part of wisdom to profit by\r\nthe speculation and experience of others.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal methods that have been tried or proposed\r\nfor the control and management of railroads:\r\n\r\n_1. Publicity of the railroad business._\r\n\r\nIt is held by some that the secrecy with which railroad business is at\r\npresent transacted is the source of all evils. It is contended that if\r\nrailroads were required to report to the public every item of income and\r\nexpenditure, discrimination and extortion, as well as bribery and\r\ncorrupt subsidizing, would soon cease. If the companies were compelled\r\nto render an account of all receipts, special rates and drawbacks could\r\nnot safely be granted by railroad managers, or, if granted, would soon\r\nlose their charm for recipients, for it would be but a short time until\r\nothers would demand and even exact the same privileges. An attorney\r\nwould, as a member of the legislature, be slow to accept a retaining fee\r\nif the amount of such fee were made known to his constituents.\r\nPublishers would hesitate to apply for railroad subsidies if the\r\ncompanies were compelled to render periodically an itemized account of\r\nsuch expenditures, and railroad companies would, under similar\r\ncircumstances, hesitate to pay subsidies, for the subsidized journal\r\nwould soon be without patrons. If the items annually expended upon\r\nrailroad lobbies were reported, these lobbies would soon be frowned, or\r\neven hissed, out of legislative halls. There can be no doubt that full\r\nand complete publicity in railroad business would correct a large number\r\nof existing abuses, and it should therefore be insisted upon as one of\r\nthe first and essential features of railroad reform. It is questionable,\r\nhowever, whether railroad managers are so sensitive to public opinion\r\nthat publicity could be relied upon as a cure for all railroad evils. To\r\nwhat extent it is desirable to supplement publicity by other measures\r\nof State control will be considered hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt will, of course, be urged by railroad managers that the State has no\r\nright to pry into the privacy of their business and that they should be\r\nguaranteed the same protection against intrusion that is enjoyed by\r\nother branches of business. To this we must reply that not even banks or\r\ninsurance companies are permitted to conduct their business as private,\r\nand that controlling the highway and levying a transportation tax upon\r\nevery article of commerce passing over it is essentially public business\r\nand unquestionably subject to public control. Every citizen is as much\r\ninterested in it as he is in the transactions of the custom-house, or of\r\nthe public treasury, and any transaction of a railroad manager that\r\nshuns public inspection can be set down as a public evil and should be\r\nsuppressed. It may safely be laid down as a general rule that the\r\nrefusal of a railroad company to give publicity to its transactions is\r\npresumptive evidence of wrong. The people are not alone interested in\r\nsuch publicity. Stockholders have likewise a right to be protected\r\nagainst the sinister manipulations of dishonest managers, and publicity\r\nfurnishes them the best guarantee of honest management.\r\n\r\nStockholders should attend the meetings of their companies and should\r\nobtain full knowledge of the management of their affairs. If they will\r\nmake thorough examination and get at bottom facts the chances are that\r\ncontracts will be found with owners of patents, white lines, blue lines,\r\nrefrigerator car lines, coal companies, ferry companies, manufacturing\r\ncompanies, packing companies and other kindred organizations, by which\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars are diverted from the treasuries of the\r\nrailroad companies to the pockets of influential persons connected with\r\nthe management of the roads.\r\n\r\nIt has recently come to light that the officers of a Pennsylvania\r\nrailroad company, during fifteen years, by some means of secret rebates\r\nand other allowances, have taken about $100,000,000 out of the treasury\r\nof the company and distributed it as largesses to about half a dozen\r\niron and steel establishments.\r\n\r\nThis is a method of getting wealthy at the expense of others not unknown\r\nto many another great fortune accumulated in the last twenty years.\r\nRailroad discriminations have been a fruitful source of those gross\r\ninequalities in wealth distribution which now agitate society and call\r\npeople's parties and the like into existence. The modern millionaire\r\nappears to be an entirely natural creation. Perhaps this money taken in\r\nspecial rates from the Pennsylvania railroad's treasury, or, rather,\r\nfrom the pockets of the road's other patrons, and of the men who may\r\nhave sought, without special rates, to compete with the favored ones in\r\ntheir business, only to be crushed in financial ruin, will be spent in a\r\npraiseworthy way, in accord with the principles of \"the gospel of\r\nwealth.\" What we need now is the gospel of distribution of facilities\r\nfor the accumulation of wealth, as well as the gospel of distribution of\r\ngreat fortunes.\r\n\r\nWhether inspired by a bull or a bear interest or neither, all will\r\nconcede the ability of Mr. Henry Clews to picture the evils of railroad\r\nmanagement; and his lack of generosity in accrediting ability or honesty\r\nto legislators who are called upon to provide remedies for the wrongs\r\nthat he so well depicts will not deter me from indorsing the following\r\nstatement made by him in a magazine article which is pertinent to this\r\ndiscussion:\r\n\r\n      \"One great difficulty that present railroad legislators have\r\n      to contend with is the evil methods of railroad building and\r\n      extension. A great deal of the mileage of the last two years\r\n      has been premature, and doubtless for speculative purposes.\r\n      Most of it has been constructed, however, by old companies\r\n      who had good credit to float bonds and could raise all the\r\n      money required. Hence there has been but little financial\r\n      embarrassment arising from the too rapid construction. But\r\n      people are beginning to find out that a great deal of this\r\n      building has been in the interest of speculative directors\r\n      and their friends, who, for a mere song, had bought up\r\n      barren lands considered worthless because there was no means\r\n      of transportation. But these lands soon become immensely\r\n      valuable for sites of villages, towns and cities. The\r\n      construction companies, by which these roads were generally\r\n      built, raised the cost to the highest possible figures, in\r\n      order, I fear, to make dividends for the construction\r\n      stockholders. It is noteworthy that the directors connected\r\n      with these construction schemes have been exceedingly\r\n      prosperous, while the stockholders of the roads have grown\r\n      poor in an inverse ratio. The dividends of the latter have\r\n      disappeared. The new mileage, much of which, I apprehend,\r\n      has been made on this principle, was about twenty-one\r\n      thousand miles, which is greater than the entire mileage of\r\n      Great Britain. There should be additions to the Interstate\r\n      Law, or a special law regulating the methods of construction\r\n      companies, which are probably doing more to demoralize the\r\n      railroad system--and doing it very insidiously, too--than\r\n      any other factor connected with these great arteries of the\r\n      country's prosperity.\r\n\r\n      \"Legislative reform is greatly needed in the matter of\r\n      railroad reports, especially for the safety of investors,\r\n      and to prevent speculative abuses among railroad officials\r\n      and their friends and favorites. There should be statements\r\n      issued annually, or perhaps more frequently, upon the truth\r\n      of which everybody might rely. These should be sworn\r\n      statements, and should bear the signatures of at least three\r\n      of the directors. These directors should be required to\r\n      call to their aid expert accountants, and should have placed\r\n      at their disposal all the books of the company or\r\n      corporation and all the other papers necessary to verify the\r\n      accuracy of their report. The correctness of the statement,\r\n      when issued, would then be a foregone conclusion, and an\r\n      investor in London, Paris or Berlin could buy or sell on his\r\n      own judgment, an experiment which, under existing\r\n      arrangements, might prove very costly. It is proverbial that\r\n      a railroad statement now is defective in the most essential\r\n      particulars, and, to put it mildly, usually covers a\r\n      multitude of sins. According to one plan approved by\r\n      railroad companies, the statement published to-day, for\r\n      instance, is made to show a surplus of many millions, but\r\n      there is nothing said about an open construction account to\r\n      which the surplus is debtor. On this favorable showing (with\r\n      this _suppressio veri_) the stock goes up and the insiders\r\n      quickly unload upon the investment public. The following\r\n      statement, which comes out six months later, shows that the\r\n      surplus has been used to settle the construction\r\n      indebtedness. The surplus has disappeared; consequently the\r\n      stock suffers a serious decline. Those who bought on the\r\n      strength of the large surplus sell out, on being informed of\r\n      its distribution. Then the inside sharks come forward again\r\n      and purchase at reduced prices, probably at a depreciation\r\n      of from ten to fifteen points or more, and keep their stock\r\n      until the next periodical appearance of the bogus surplus.\r\n      Thus the insiders grow rich, while the outsiders become\r\n      poor. The only remedy for this abuse is a sworn statement at\r\n      regular intervals, and if the directors should commit\r\n      perjury they would render themselves liable to State prison.\r\n      If a few of them should be tempted to fall into the trap,\r\n      and be made examples of in this way, nothing would do more\r\n      to work a speedy reform in this contemptible method of\r\n      book-keeping.\r\n\r\n      \"I would also suggest a change in the character of the\r\n      directors. Those usually chosen for this office now are men\r\n      who have vast interests of their own, more than sufficient\r\n      to absorb their entire time and thoughts. They are selected\r\n      mainly on account of their high-sounding names, to give\r\n      tone to the corporation and solidify its credit, in order\r\n      that the lambs of speculation may have proper objects in\r\n      whom confidence can be reposed and no questions asked. The\r\n      management of the affairs of the corporation is frequently\r\n      intrusted to one man, who runs the business to suit his own\r\n      individual interests.\"\r\n\r\nWe can appreciate the force of the above remarks when we consider that\r\nlast year seventy-five companies realized a gross income of\r\n$846,888,000, which is equal to about 80 per cent. of the total income\r\nreceived by all of the railroads of the United States.\r\n\r\n_2. Free competition upon all railroads._\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson, in his excellent work, \"The Railways and the Republic,\"\r\nrecommends the following remedy:\r\n\r\n      \"Legislation should restore the character of public highways\r\n      to the railways, by securing to all persons the right to run\r\n      trains over their tracks upon proper regulations, and by\r\n      defining the distinction between the proprietorship and\r\n      maintenance of the railway and the business of common\r\n      carriers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson proposes to leave the track in the possession of its present\r\nowners, but to permit any individual or company to run, upon the payment\r\nof a fixed toll, trains and cars over it, under the control of a\r\ntrain-dispatcher stationed at a central point. This train-dispatcher is\r\nto be notified by telegraph of the movement of each train, and is to\r\ngive his orders to the officers in charge of each train, as to what\r\npoints they are to go, where to pass one train and where to wait for\r\nanother. Each transportation company is to own, load and forward its own\r\ntrains; it is to be required to run its regular train on schedule time\r\nor to have it follow another train as an extra. They are to be liable to\r\ntheir shippers as well as to the railway company for all damages caused\r\nby their neglect, while the railroad company is to be held responsible\r\nfor the condition of its track. It will not be necessary to go into the\r\ndetails of Mr. Hudson's plan. Suffice it to say that he proposes to\r\nestablish free competition in the railway business by making the use of\r\nthe railway track as free as that of the turnpike or canal, subject only\r\nto such control on the part of the public train-dispatcher as the\r\nparamount considerations of speed and safety may require.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of Mr. Hudson's plan would simply be a return to the first\r\nprinciple of railroad transportation. It has already been shown that the\r\nfirst English charters permitted the public to use their own vehicles\r\nand motive power upon the railroad track, but that shippers and\r\nindependent carriers could not avail themselves of these provisions of\r\nthe early charters because it was in the power of the railroad companies\r\nto make their tolls prohibitory. There is but little question as to the\r\npracticability of Mr. Hudson's plan from a purely technical standpoint,\r\nand its adoption might be advisable if it should be demonstrated that a\r\nmonopoly of the track is inconsistent with the operation of the railways\r\nfor the public good. It is seriously doubted, however, whether such\r\nideal competition as Mr. Hudson desires to bring about could be secured\r\nexcept at the expense of true economy. Concentration, or, rather,\r\nconsolidation in the railroad business has, under proper legal\r\nrestriction, always resulted in a saving of operating expenses, and\r\nusually in a reduction of rates. Any step in the opposite direction,\r\nwhatever other merits it may possess, is in the end not likely to give\r\nlower rates. If it is a settled principle that railroads are only\r\nentitled to a fair compensation for their services, it must be evident\r\nthat what would be a fair compensation for the same or similar services\r\nto a large, well-organized, well-regulated and well-managed company\r\ncannot be sufficient compensation to an individual carrier or a small\r\ncompany, whose expenses will always be comparatively larger than those\r\nof its better-equipped rival. Monopoly and extortion need not\r\nnecessarily be synonymous. In fact, States and municipalities in their\r\npublic works often prefer monopoly to competition as the cheaper of the\r\ntwo. Nevertheless, should it ever be found that monopolies cannot be\r\nreconciled with justice and economy, a return to the first principles of\r\nrailroading may become advisable.\r\n\r\n_3. State ownership and management._\r\n\r\nA number of European states, notably Prussia, France and Belgium, as\r\nwell as Australia, British India and the British colonies in Southern\r\nAfrica, have adopted government ownership of railroads. The motives\r\nwhich led to this step in the various countries differ greatly. While in\r\nEurope military and political considerations predominated, in Africa and\r\nAustralia it was more the want of private capital and energy which led\r\nthe government to engage in railroad enterprises. There has in most of\r\nthese states been a desire to avoid the evils usually connected with\r\nprivate management. The experiment of state ownership and management of\r\nrailroads has been longest tried in Belgium, and with the best results.\r\nWith an excellent service the rates of the Belgian state roads are the\r\nlowest in Europe. Their first-class passenger tariffs are, next to the\r\nzone tariff recently adopted on the state roads of Hungary, the lowest\r\nin the world, and are, for the same distance, lower than those of\r\nAmerican roads. In Prussia the state service, upon the whole, is also\r\nsuperior to that of private companies, and is probably equal to the\r\npublic demand. In France the government only owns and operates less\r\nimportant lines, but furnishes upon these a more efficient and cheaper\r\nservice than private companies would either be able or disposed to\r\nfurnish. The oft-repeated statement of those opposed to government\r\nregulation to the contrary notwithstanding, government ownership and\r\nmanagement of railroads is a decided success in Europe, Mr. Jeans says\r\nof state railroads:\r\n\r\n      \"Notwithstanding the superior financial result, the lines\r\n      worked by the state are those kept in the best order, and\r\n      the working of which gives the greatest satisfaction to the\r\n      commercial world and the public in general as regards\r\n      regularity of conveyance, cheapness of transit and the\r\n      comfort of travelers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how any unbiased person can travel on any of the\r\nstate roads of Europe without coming to the same conclusion. State\r\nmanagement offers certainly some decided advantages to the public. Above\r\nall, the business of the roads is not conducted for the pecuniary\r\nadvantage of a few, but for the common good. Commerce is not arbitrarily\r\ndisturbed to aid unscrupulous managers in their stock speculations. New\r\nlines are not built for speculative purposes, but for the development of\r\nthe country. Rates are based more upon the cost of service than upon\r\nwhat the traffic will bear, and the ultimate object of the state's\r\npolicy is not high profits, but a healthy growth of the country's\r\ncommerce, while the sole aim of a private company is to get the largest\r\nrevenue possible. The permanent way of the state road is kept in better\r\ncondition, the public safety and convenience being paramount\r\nconsiderations. Rates are stable and uniform, instead of being\r\nchangeable and discriminating, and all persons and places are as equal\r\nbefore the railroad tax collector as before the law. It may be laid down\r\nas a general rule that under private management of railroads efforts\r\nwill be made to secure the highest rates possible, while it is the aim\r\nof the Government to grant the lowest rates possible. Mr. Jeans proves\r\nby statistics that the cost of maintenance of way is generally higher on\r\nthe state lines, and that traffic expenses are higher on the lines of\r\nprivate companies. In commenting upon this difference he says:\r\n\r\n      \"It might easily be contended, and even proved beyond all\r\n      doubt, that the first characteristic is a result of the\r\n      better condition in which the state keeps the permanent way;\r\n      and, so far as this is the case, the public convenience,\r\n      safety and general advantage are promoted.\r\n\r\n      \"The highest range of traffic expenses on companies' lines\r\n      undoubtedly argues greater laxity of management, since, as\r\n      we have already shown, this is one of the most elastic of\r\n      items, and may be either very high or very low, according as\r\n      economy or extravagance is the prevailing system.... The\r\n      experience of Continental Europe points unmistakably to the\r\n      exercise of greater economy in state management.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Dillon, of the United States Court, in his order appointing Hon.\r\nJ. B. Grinnell receiver for the Central Railroad of Iowa, in 1876, said:\r\n\r\n      \"The railroads in the hands of the court--and in the circuit\r\n      there are eight or ten--have all been run with less expense,\r\n      and have made more money, than when they were operated by\r\n      the companies; and we hope and believe under your\r\n      supervision that this road will prove no exception, and that\r\n      the property will be worth more at the end of the\r\n      litigation.\"\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Grinnell's resignation, after nearly three years of service,\r\nJudge Grant said, in asking for the discharge of his bondsmen:\r\n\r\n      \"I concur entirely in the opinion of the State commissioners\r\n      that he has very much improved the condition of the road,\r\n      and he left it in far superior condition to that in which he\r\n      received it.\"\r\n\r\nYet Government ownership and management of railroads also has its\r\ndrawbacks. It is claimed by some that such management is more expensive\r\nthan that of lines owned by private companies. It has already been shown\r\nthat the permanent way is kept in better condition by the state than by\r\nprivate corporations. In Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, France and\r\nItaly the state expends from 15 to 30 per cent. more for the maintenance\r\nof the permanent way than the private companies. It is perhaps also true\r\nthat the rank and file of railroad employes fare, on an average, better\r\nunder government than they do under private management; but, as an\r\noffset to this, it should be remembered that quite a saving is effected\r\nby the state in the salary account of general officers. The people will\r\nnot consent to pay the manager of a railroad line a salary six times as\r\nlarge as that of a cabinet officer, and provide at the same time\r\nsinecures for his sons, brothers, nephews and cousins.\r\n\r\nIt is furthermore claimed that, as government is organized, it cannot,\r\nall other things being equal, respond to the demands of commerce as\r\npromptly as private companies. This feature, however, may be an\r\nadvantage to the country at large rather than a detriment. But the\r\nstrongest argument that can be produced against state ownership of\r\nrailroads is that under a democratic form of government it might exert a\r\ndemoralizing influence in politics. The 1,700 railroad companies of the\r\nUnited States have at present an army of about 800,000 employes. This\r\nnumber is constantly increasing, and it is more than probable that\r\nbefore the end of the present century it will have reached a million.\r\nWhen it is considered what importance is at present attached to the\r\npolitical influence of a hundred thousand Federal officers, it is not\r\nsurprising that conservative citizens should hesitate to add to the\r\nranks of these officeholders a six or seven times larger force.\r\nDangerous as the railroad influence now is in politics, it would be ten\r\ntimes more dangerous if under a system of Government management\r\nconsiderations of self-interest should induce a million railroad\r\nemployes to act as a political unit and political parties should vie\r\nwith each other in bidding for the railroad vote. Could our civil\r\nservice ever be so organized as to divest it entirely of political\r\npower, state management of railroads might still offer the best solution\r\nof the railroad problem.\r\n\r\nMr. T. B. Blackstone, president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad\r\nCompany, has recently created somewhat of a surprise by declaring in\r\nfavor of Government ownership of railroads. That Mr. Blackstone's\r\nprogramme will eventually receive the approval of a large number of his\r\ncolleagues there can be but little doubt. With the people wide-awake\r\nupon this subject, the opportunities for railroad speculation are\r\nlessening, and the scheme to early unload the railroads of the country\r\non the Government at a highly inflated value speaks well for the\r\nfinancial farsightedness of its author. Mr. Blackstone proposes to have\r\nrailroad stockholders do here what the former owners of the telegraph\r\ndid in Great Britain, _i. e._, dispose of their property to the\r\nGovernment, at a price representing several times its original cost or\r\neven several times the cost of duplication.\r\n\r\nMr. C. Wood Davis, formerly general freight and passenger agent of one\r\nof the leading roads east from Chicago, is one of the best informed and\r\nclearest-headed writers upon the railroad question. He has, after much\r\nexperience and long study, been converted to the advocacy of national\r\nownership as a solution of the railroad problem. In a recent article\r\npublished by the Arena Publishing Company, entitled \"Should the Nation\r\nown the Railways?\" he presents the objections and advantages of national\r\nownership. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"The objections to national ownership are many, that most\r\n      frequently advanced, and having the most force, being the\r\n      possibility that, by reason of its control of a vastly\r\n      increased number of civil servants, the party in possession\r\n      of the Federal administration at the time such ownership was\r\n      assumed would be able to perpetuate its power\r\n      indefinitely.... This objection would seem to be well taken,\r\n      and indicates serious and far-reaching results unless some\r\n      way can be devised to neutralize the political power of such\r\n      a vast addition to the official army.... In the military\r\n      service we have a body of men that exerts little or no\r\n      political power, as the moment a citizen enters the army he\r\n      divests himself of political functions; and it is not\r\n      hazardous to say that 700,000 capable and efficient men can\r\n      be found who, for the sake of employment, to be continued so\r\n      long as they are capable and well behaved, will forego the\r\n      right to take part in political affairs. If a sufficient\r\n      number of such men can be found, this objection would, by\r\n      proper legislation, be divested of all its force....\r\n\r\n      \"2. That there would be constant political pressure to make\r\n      places for the strikers of the party in power, thus adding a\r\n      vast number of useless men to the force, and rendering it\r\n      progressively more difficult to effect a change in the\r\n      political complexion of the administration.\r\n\r\n      \"That this objection has much less force than is claimed is\r\n      clear from the conduct of the postal department, which is\r\n      unquestionably a political adjunct of the administration;\r\n      yet but few useless men are employed, while its conduct of\r\n      the mail service is a model of efficiency after which the\r\n      corporate-managed railways might well pattern. Moreover, if\r\n      the railways are put under non-partisan control, this\r\n      objection will lose nearly, if not quite, all its force.\r\n\r\n      \"3. That the service would be less efficient and cost more\r\n      than with continued corporate ownership. This appears to be\r\n      bare assertion, as from the very nature of the case there\r\n      can be no data outside those furnished by the\r\n      government-owned railways of the British colonies, and such\r\n      data negative these assertions; and the advocates of\r\n      national ownership are justified in asserting that such\r\n      ownership would materially lessen the cost, as any expert\r\n      can readily point out many ways in which the enormous costs\r\n      of corporate management would be lessened. With those\r\n      familiar with present methods, and not interested in their\r\n      perpetuation, this objection has no force whatever.\r\n\r\n      \"4. That with constant political pressure unnecessary lines\r\n      would be built for political ends. This is also bare\r\n      assertion, although it is not impossible that such results\r\n      would follow; yet such has not been the case in the British\r\n      colonies where the governments have had control of\r\n      construction....\r\n\r\n      \"5. That, with the amount of red tape that will be in use,\r\n      it will be impossible to secure the building of needed\r\n      lines. While such objection is inconsistent with the fourth,\r\n      it may have some force, but as the greater part of the\r\n      country is already provided with all the railways that will\r\n      be needed for a generation, it is not a very serious\r\n      objection even if it is as difficult as asserted to procure\r\n      the building of the new lines. It is not probable, however,\r\n      that the Government would refuse to build any line that\r\n      would clearly subserve public, convenience, the conduct of\r\n      the postal service negativing such a supposition....\r\n\r\n      \"6. That lines built by the Government would cost much more\r\n      than if built by corporations. Possibly this would be true,\r\n      but they would be much better built and cost far less for\r\n      maintenance and betterments, and would represent no more\r\n      than actual cost; and such lines as the Kansas Midland,\r\n      costing but $10,200 per mile, would not, as now, be\r\n      capitalized at $53,024 per mile, nor would the president of\r\n      the Union Pacific (as does Sidney Dillon, in the _North\r\n      American Review_ for April) say that \"a citizen, simply as\r\n      a citizen, commits an impertinence when he questions the\r\n      right of a corporation to capitalize its properties at any\r\n      sum whatever,\" as then there would be no Sidney Dillons who\r\n      would be presidents of corporations, pretending to own\r\n      railways built wholly from Government moneys and lands, and\r\n      who have never invested a dollar in the construction of a\r\n      property which they have now capitalized at the modest sum\r\n      of $106,000 per mile....\r\n\r\n      \"7. That they are incapable of as progressive improvement as\r\n      are corporate-owned ones, and will not keep pace with the\r\n      progress of the nation in other respects; and in his _Forum_\r\n      article Mr. Acworth lays great stress upon this phase of the\r\n      question and argues that as a result the service would be\r\n      far less satisfactory.\r\n\r\n      \"There may be force in this objection, but the evidence\r\n      points to an opposite conclusion. When the nation owns the\r\n      railways trains will run into union depots, the equipment\r\n      will become uniform and of the best character, and so\r\n      sufficient that the traffic in no part of the country would\r\n      have to wait while the worthless locomotives of some\r\n      bankrupt corporation were being patched up, nor would there\r\n      be the present difficulties in obtaining freight cars\r\n      growing out of the poverty of corporations which have been\r\n      plundered by the manipulators, and improvements would not be\r\n      hindered by the diverse ideas of the managers of various\r\n      lines in relation to the adoption of devices intended to\r\n      render life more secure or to add to the public\r\n      convenience.... Existing evidence all negatives Mr.\r\n      Acworth's postulate that \"state railway systems are\r\n      incapable of vigorous life.\"\r\n\r\n      \"8. An objection to national ownership which the writer has\r\n      not seen advanced is that States, counties, cities,\r\n      townships and school districts would lose some $27,000,000\r\n      of revenue derived from taxes upon railways. While this\r\n      would be a serious loss to some communities, there would be\r\n      compensating advantages for the public, as the cost of\r\n      transportation could be lessened in like measure.\r\n\r\n      \"Many believe stringent laws, enforced by commissions\r\n      having judicial power, will serve the desired end, and the\r\n      writer was long hopeful of the efficacy of regulation by\r\n      State and National commissions; but close observation of\r\n      their endeavors and of the constant efforts--too often\r\n      successful--of the corporations to place their tools on such\r\n      commissions, and to evade all laws and regulations, have\r\n      convinced him that such control is and must continue to be\r\n      ineffective and that the only hope of just and impartial\r\n      treatment for railway users is to exercise the 'right of\r\n      eminent domain,' condemn the railways, and pay their owners\r\n      what it would cost to duplicate them; and in this connection\r\n      it may be well to state what valuations some of the\r\n      corporations place upon their properties.\r\n\r\n      \"Some years since the Santa Fe filed in the counties on its\r\n      line a statement showing that at the then price of labor and\r\n      materials--rails were double the present price--their road\r\n      could be duplicated for $9,685 per mile, and, the materials\r\n      being much worn, the actual cash value of the road did not\r\n      exceed $7,725 per mile.\r\n\r\n      \"In 1885 the superintendent of the St. Louis and Iron\r\n      Mountain Railway, before the Arkansas State Board of\r\n      Assessors, swore that he could duplicate such a railway for\r\n      $11,000 per mile, and yet Mr. Gould has managed to float its\r\n      securities, notwithstanding a capitalization of five times\r\n      that amount.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages to be derived from Government ownership he names\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n      \"First would be the stability and practical uniformity of\r\n      rates, now impossible, as they are subject to change by\r\n      hundreds of officials, and are often made for the purpose of\r\n      enriching such officials....\r\n\r\n      \"It would place the rate-making power in one body, with no\r\n      inducement to act otherwise than fairly and impartially, and\r\n      this would simplify the whole business and relegate an army\r\n      of traffic managers, general freight agents, soliciting\r\n      agents, brokers, scalpers and hordes of traffic association\r\n      officials to more useful callings, while relieving the\r\n      honest user of the railway of intolerable burdens.\r\n\r\n      \"Under corporate control, railways and their officials have\r\n      taken possession of the majority of mines which furnish the\r\n      fuel so necessary to domestic and industrial life, and there\r\n      are few coal fields where they do not fix the price at which\r\n      so essential an article shall be sold, and the whole nation\r\n      is thus forced to pay undue tribute.\r\n\r\n      \"Controlling rates and the distribution of cars, railway\r\n      officials have driven nearly all the mine owners, who have\r\n      not railways or railway officials for partners, to the wall.\r\n\r\n      \"With the Government operating the railways, discriminations\r\n      would cease, as would individual and local oppression; and\r\n      we may be sure that an instant and absolute divorce would be\r\n      decreed between railways and their officials on one side,\r\n      and commercial enterprises of every name and kind on the\r\n      other.\r\n\r\n      \"The failure to furnish equipment to do the business of the\r\n      tributary country promptly is one of the greater evils of\r\n      corporate administration, enabling officials to practice\r\n      most injurious and oppressive forms of discrimination, and\r\n      is one that neither Federal nor State commission pays much\r\n      attention to. With national ownership a sufficiency of cars\r\n      would be provided. On many roads the funds that should have\r\n      been devoted to furnishing the needed equipment, and which\r\n      the corporations contracted to provide when they accepted\r\n      their charters, have been divided as construction profits,\r\n      or, as in the case of the Santa Fe, Union Pacific, and many\r\n      others, diverted to the payment of unearned dividends, while\r\n      the public suffers from this failure to comply with charter\r\n      obligations.\r\n\r\n      \"There would be such an adjustment of rates that traffic\r\n      would take the natural short route, and not, as under\r\n      corporate management, be sent around by the way of Robin\r\n      Hood's barn, when it might reach its destination by a route\r\n      but two-thirds as long, and thus save the unnecessary tax to\r\n      which the industries of the country are subjected. That\r\n      traffic can be sent by these roundabout routes at the same\r\n      or less rates than is charged by the shorter ones is _prima\r\n      facie_ evidence that rates are too high.\r\n\r\n      \"There would be a great reduction in the number of men\r\n      employed in towns entered by more than one line.

Under Government control these staffs--except in\r\n      very large cities--would be reduced to one, and all trains\r\n      would run into one centrally located depot; freight and\r\n      passengers be transferred without present cost, annoyance\r\n      and friction, and public convenience and comfort subserved,\r\n      and added to in manner and degree almost inconceivable.\r\n\r\n      \"The great number of expensive attorneys now employed, with\r\n      all the attendant corruption with the fountains of justice,\r\n      could be dispensed with, and there would be no corporations\r\n      to take from the bench the best legal minds, by offering\r\n      three or four times the Federal salary....\r\n\r\n      \"Every citizen riding would pay fare, adding immensely to\r\n      the revenues.

From the experience of the writer, as an\r\n      auditor of railway accounts, and as an executive officer\r\n      issuing passes, he is able to say that fully ten per cent.\r\n      travel free, the result being that the great mass of railway\r\n      users are yearly mulcted some thirty millions of dollars for\r\n      the benefit of the favored minority; hence it is evident\r\n      that if all were required to pay for railway services as\r\n      they are for mail services, the rates might be reduced ten\r\n      per cent, or more, and the corporate revenues be no less,\r\n      and the operating expenses no more. In no other\r\n      country--unless it be under the same system in Canada--are\r\n      nine-tenths of the people taxed to pay the traveling\r\n      expenses of the other tenth. By what right do the\r\n      corporations tax the public that members of Congress,\r\n      legislators, judges and other court officials and their\r\n      families may ride free?

In other\r\n      words, these exceptionally high salaries are paid for the\r\n      purpose, and because their recipients are believed to have\r\n      the ability to hold up their end in unscrupulous corporate\r\n      warfare where, as one railway president expressed it, 'the\r\n      greatest liar comes out ahead....'\r\n\r\n      \"Government control will enable railway users to dispense\r\n      with the services of such high-priced umpires as Mr. Aldace\r\n      F.

It\r\n      appears that each of these costly peace-making attachments\r\n      has an average of seven corporations to watch....\r\n\r\n      \"With National ownership the expenditures involved in the\r\n      maintenance of traffic associations would be saved and\r\n      railway users relieved of a tax that, judging from the\r\n      reports of a limited number of corporations of their\r\n      contribution towards the support of such organizations, must\r\n      annually amount to between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000.\r\n\r\n      \"Of the six hundred corporations operating railways,\r\n      probably five hundred maintain costly general offices,\r\n      where president, secretary and treasurer pass the time\r\n      surrounded by an expensive staff.

A still greater expense is involved in the\r\n      maintenance of freight and passenger offices off the\r\n      respective lines, for the purpose of securing a portion of\r\n      competitive traffic.

Many of the\r\npredictions and estimates are undoubtedly in the main correct, yet upon\r\nthe whole it must be admitted that it is a rather rosy and too hopeful\r\nview to take of Government ownership of our railroads.\r\n\r\n_4. State ownership with private management._\r\n\r\nThis is a compromise between a public and a private system of railway\r\nownership and management. It is claimed by the advocates of this system\r\nthat if the Government would acquire by purchase or through condemnation\r\nproceedings all of the railroads of the country, pay for them by issuing\r\nits bonds, and then lease the various lines to the highest responsible\r\nbidders, prescribing a schedule and rules of management, most of the\r\nbenefits resulting from state ownership of railroads could be secured\r\nwhile nearly all its disadvantages would be avoided. It is proposed to\r\npurchase railroads at their actual value and to issue in payment bonds\r\nbearing the same rate of interest as other Government securities. This\r\nwould deprive managers of every opportunity to manipulate the railroad\r\nbusiness for purposes of stock speculation. It would also reduce the\r\nfixed charges of our railroads at least 50 per cent., the benefits of\r\nwhich reduction the public would chiefly share. The acquisition of the\r\nrailroads by the Government would, moreover, afford the conservative\r\ncapitalist a safe and permanent investment, which, with the gradual\r\ndisappearance of our war debt, might become a national desideratum.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by the advocates of this system that the Government fix\r\nrates of transportation for a certain period, to be reviewed at the end\r\nof that period upon an agreed basis. The operating companies would be\r\nrequired to keep their roads in repair and give sufficient bonds for the\r\nfaithful performance of their contracts. If found guilty of persistent\r\nviolations of the terms of their leases or of such laws as Congress\r\nmight enact for their control, their bonds and leases might be declared\r\nforfeited. A new Government department or bureau would have to be\r\nestablished and charged with the duty of exercising the same control\r\nover railroads which the Government now exercises over national banks,\r\nand in addition to this complete publicity of the service would have to\r\nbe relied upon to prevent the introduction of abuses.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two valid objections that can be urged against the\r\nadoption of such a system. Responsible companies could not be induced to\r\nlease a line for a valid consideration unless their rates were\r\ndefinitely fixed for a series of years. Such a course might, however,\r\nin time result in great hardship to the commerce of the country, as the\r\ngreat and unavoidable difference in the rates of the various railroad\r\nlines of the country would give to the commercial interests of some\r\nsections decided advantages over those of others. Besides this it would\r\nbe very difficult to compel the different companies to keep the lines\r\nleased by them in repair. Controversies would constantly arise between\r\nthe officers charged with the supervision of the roads and the operating\r\ncompanies, which could be ultimately determined only by the courts,\r\ncausing to the Government loss, or at least delay in the adjustments.\r\n\r\n_5. National control._\r\n\r\nMr. A. B. Stickney, in his work, \"The Railway Problem,\" holds that in\r\nthe interest of uniformity it is desirable to transfer the entire\r\ncontrol of railroads to the National Government. He assigns two reasons\r\nfor the proposed change; one being that Congress would consider the\r\nsubject of railroad control with more intelligence and greater\r\ndeliberation; the other, that \"the problem of regulating railway tolls\r\nand of managing railways is essentially and practically indivisible by\r\nthe State lines or otherwise,\" and that the authority of Congress to\r\ndeal with interstate traffic carries with it the right to regulate the\r\ntraffic which is now assumed to be controlled by the several States.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that it is a difficult matter to draw the line of\r\ndemarcation between National and State control, and that Congressional\r\nregulation of railways would remedy many evils which now affect our\r\ntransportation system; yet there is reason to believe that the proposed\r\nchange would in the end be productive of more evil than good. It is an\r\nessentially American maxim that the home government only should be\r\ntrusted with the administration of home affairs. The people of each\r\nState know best their local needs, and it is safe to say that for a\r\ngeneration or two no serious effort will be made to amend the Federal\r\nConstitution in this respect or to secure from the courts an\r\ninterpretation of the interstate commerce clause greatly differing from\r\nthat which now obtains.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that nearly all the methods of railroad management which\r\nwe have discussed are, at the present time at least, more or less\r\nimpracticable on account of the radical changes which they would\r\nnecessitate. It is not likely that for many years to come the American\r\npeople could be induced to try any extensive experiments in state\r\nownership of railroads; nor is it any more likely that the present\r\ngeneration will undertake the difficult task of separating the ownership\r\nof railroads from their operation.\r\n\r\nA nation is, like the individual, inclined to follow beaten tracks. It\r\nfinds it, as a rule, easier to improve these tracks than to abandon them\r\nand mark out a new course. Any proposition made for the improvement of\r\nour system of railroad transportation is in the same proportion likely\r\nto receive the approval of the masses in which it makes use of existing\r\nconditions. It will, therefore, be my aim, in making suggestions as to a\r\nmore efficient control of this modern highway, to retain whatever good\r\nfeatures the present system possesses, and to only propose such changes\r\nas may seem essential to restore to the railroad the character of a\r\nhighway.\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated above, any system of railway regulation, to be\r\napplicable to our circumstances, must recognize the dual sovereignty of\r\nNation and State. The great majority of our railroad corporations were\r\noriginally created by the State, and are only responsible to the State\r\nas long as they do not engage in interstate commerce. Even foreign\r\ncorporations must submit to all police regulations of the State in which\r\nthey may do business, and as long as the American Constitution remains\r\nintact the individual States will, and should, assert their right to\r\nregulate local traffic and to exercise police supervision over all\r\nrailroads crossing their boundaries.\r\n\r\nAll power should be kept as closely to the people as is consistent with\r\nefficiency in the public service. It may even be questioned whether\r\nentire transfer to the Federal Government of the supervisory powers now\r\nexercised by the States in railroad affairs would tend to correct\r\nexisting railroad evils more speedily or more effectually than they can\r\nbe corrected through the agency of local rule. The conditions, and\r\ntherefore the wants, of the different States differ so greatly that\r\ngeneral legislation must always fail when it attempts to regulate\r\nmatters of merely local concern.\r\n\r\nThe means employed by the State for the regulation of the roads under\r\nits jurisdiction should be such as are least likely to lead to a\r\nconflict with Federal authority, and experience has shown that the\r\nauthority of the General Government and that of an individual State over\r\na railroad company, which is incorporated under the laws of the latter,\r\nbut is engaged in interstate commerce, may be so harmonized as to avoid\r\nconflicts between the two sovereignties without any great sacrifice of\r\npower on the part of either. Judge Cooley said recently in reference to\r\nregulation by National and State commissions:\r\n\r\n      \"There is no good reason in the nature of things why the\r\n      conformity should not be complete and perfect. It is\r\n      remarkable that up to this time there has been so little--I\r\n      will not say of conflict, but even of diversity of action\r\n      between the National and State commissions. Indeed, I recall\r\n      no instance at this time when anything done by the one has\r\n      seemed to me to afford just ground for complaint by the\r\n      other. This may justly be attributed to the fact that there\r\n      has been no purpose on the part of either to do any act that\r\n      could afford ground for just complaint on the part of\r\n      managers of the business regulated and no desire to do\r\n      anything else than to apply rules of right and equality for\r\n      the protection of the general public. The aim of all\r\n      regulation ought to be justice, and when it is apparent that\r\n      this is the purpose of the several commissions, the railroad\r\n      managers of the country may more reasonably be expected to\r\n      coöperate with them much more generally than they do now. If\r\n      these managers were to come generally and heartily into more\r\n      full and complete recognition of the rules of right and\r\n      justice that the law undertakes to lay down for the\r\n      performance of their duties in their management of the great\r\n      interests they represent, there cannot be the least doubt\r\n      that the general result would be, not only that their\r\n      service to the public would be more useful than it is now,\r\n      but that the revenues derived from their business would be\r\n      materially increased through the cutting off of many of the\r\n      drains upon them, which now, while affecting injuriously the\r\n      returns they can make to their stockholders, at the same\r\n      time have the effect of prejudicing the mind of the general\r\n      public against railroad management to an extent quite beyond\r\n      what is generally understood by those who suffer from it.\r\n      The prejudice is inevitable, and not at all unreasonable\r\n      when it is seen, as it very often is, that these drains\r\n      result from an unjust discrimination against the public or\r\n      some portion thereof, that they are of a character that\r\n      ought to need no law and no criminal or other penalties to\r\n      put them under the ban of condemnation in every office of\r\n      railroad management.\r\n\r\n      \"I take the liberty of adding one more thought: that the\r\n      more perfect is railroad legislation, the less we shall hear\r\n      of transportation by rail being made a Government function,\r\n      the General Government making purchase of all the roads and\r\n      entering upon a course which will lead we know not where or\r\n      into what disasters.\"\r\n\r\nThere has been during the past twenty years a tendency in a majority of\r\nthe States to place the local control of railroads in the hands of\r\nexecutive boards, usually styled \"railroad commissioners.\" Previous to\r\nthis period the various States relied solely upon legislation for the\r\nregulation of the transportation business, but in time they became\r\nconvinced that such laws were inoperative for the want of an enforcing\r\npower. It was found that the individual shipper was unable to cope with\r\na powerful company and usually would rather suffer wrong than to enter\r\ninto a contest which nearly always resulted in great pecuniary loss to\r\nhim. On the other hand, it was apparent that if the claim of the\r\nindividual were pressed by a railroad commission, even though such a\r\nbody had but limited powers, it would, under ordinary circumstances, be\r\nhonored, provided it was meritorious; and if the commission was\r\ncompelled to enforce a demand through the courts, it would have the\r\nsupport of the State to poise the wealth and power of the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe term \"railroad commissioner\" in the United States is nearly as old\r\nas the railroad itself; but the first officials bearing that title were\r\nmerely successors to the turnpike commissioners of yore; their duties\r\nconsisted chiefly in supervising, passing or reporting upon the\r\nconstruction and condition of the highway.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad commission, in the present acceptation of the term,\r\nwas created in the State of Massachusetts, in 1869. The commission\r\nconsisted of three persons, whose principal duty was to \"make an annual\r\nreport to the General Court, including such statements, facts and\r\nexplanations as will disclose the actual working of the system of\r\nrailroad transportation in its bearing upon the business and prosperity\r\nof the commonwealth, and such suggestions as to its general railroad\r\npolicy, or any part thereof, or the condition, affairs or conduct of any\r\nrailroad corporation, as may seem to it appropriate.\" This board also\r\nhad the general supervision of all railroads and power to examine the\r\nsame. It was required to give notice in writing to any railroad\r\ncorporation which, in its judgment, was guilty of any violation of the\r\nrailroad laws of the State; and if such company continued the violation,\r\nafter such notice, it became the duty of the commission to present the\r\nfacts to the Attorney-General. It was further made the duty of the board\r\nto examine, from time to time, the books and accounts of all railroads,\r\nto see that they were kept in a uniform manner, and upon the system\r\nprescribed by the board. It was also required to investigate the cause\r\nof any accident on a railroad resulting in loss of life. These being the\r\nprincipal duties of the board, its powers were very limited; but its\r\npersonnel supplied the power which the law had withheld. The success of\r\nthis commission exceeded even the expectations of the advocates of the\r\nsystem, who, in view of the limited powers of the commission, had\r\nanticipated but meager results.\r\n\r\nTo quiet the Granger movement the railroads favored and finally secured\r\nthe adoption of the commissioner system in the West, and South, in which\r\nsections it attained its highest development. It was soon found that a\r\ncommission after the Massachusetts model, when composed of men less\r\ncompetent or less disposed to do their duty, was liable to dwindle into\r\na statistical board or even become a pliant tool in the hands of the\r\nrailroads. Furthermore, the conditions in Massachusetts, where railroad\r\nowners and railroad patrons lived side by side and were in many\r\ninstances even identical, differed materially from those found in the\r\nWest and South, where railroad patrons were made to pay excessive rates,\r\nto produce liberal dividends on fictitious stocks for non-resident\r\nstockholders. Here a conflict between the railroads and such commissions\r\nas were determined to do their duty became often unavoidable. Railroad\r\ncompanies were as a rule disposed to disregard the recommendation of a\r\ncommission to reduce exorbitant rates. This led in those States which\r\nsuffered most from unjust tariffs to a popular demand to endow the\r\ncommission with the power to fix _prima facie_ rates. While the number\r\nof States which have taken this step is at present still limited, public\r\nopinion in its favor is growing throughout the nation, and a general\r\nadoption of this policy is probably only a question of time. There is\r\nevery reason for believing that a commission vested with the right to\r\nfix local rates, to require full and complete reports from railroad\r\ncompanies, and to make proper regulations for their control, aided by\r\npenal legislation to compel compliance with their orders, will be a\r\nsufficient aid to the State in exercising such control over the\r\ncompanies operating lines within its borders as its dignity and the\r\nwelfare of its people demand.\r\n\r\nViewing the question from a national point of view, we find that, owing\r\nto the great and constantly increasing importance of interstate traffic,\r\nimproved Federal agencies for railroad control are a pressing need.\r\nWhile much has been accomplished by the Interstate Commerce Act, much\r\nyet remains to be done. Violations of the act are still far too\r\nfrequent, and they have been encouraged by unfriendly decisions by some\r\nof the inferior Federal courts.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that nearly all the evils connected with interstate\r\ntransportation could soon be remedied were it not for the difficulties\r\nwhich the Interstate Commerce Commission encounters in the enforcement\r\nof the law. On the one hand it is not possible with the machinery at\r\npresent provided to detect and prove a considerable part of the\r\nviolations of which railroad managers are daily guilty; and on the other\r\nhand, if these violations are brought to light, there would not,\r\naccording to the testimony of a prominent railroad man, be courts enough\r\nin the country to try the violators. Besides this, such is the\r\nartfulness of railroad managers that in a majority of cases it would be\r\nimpossible to reach the guilty party, and subordinates would have to\r\nanswer for the transgressions of their superiors.\r\n\r\nTo provide adequate machinery for the supervision of the transportation\r\nbusiness, a national bureau of commerce and transportation should be\r\nestablished. As its chief a director-general of railroads should be\r\nappointed by the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This\r\nofficer should hold his office for a term of at least six years, unless\r\nsooner removed by the President, upon reasons to be communicated by him\r\nto the Senate. He should not be interested either directly or indirectly\r\nin railroad securities. The Interstate Commerce Commission should be\r\ncontinued as an advisory board. It should upon the whole retain its\r\npresent functions and should be consulted by the director-general in all\r\nmatters requiring expert investigation. A number of divisions or\r\nsub-bureaus should be established, and each should be entrusted, under\r\nthe supervision of the director-general, with such duties as may be\r\ndeemed necessary to secure the greatest efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere should be a division charged with the duty of carefully examining\r\nand compiling the detailed reports which the various companies should by\r\nlaw be required to make to the bureau. An inspection service should also\r\nbe established, similar to that now maintained by the Treasury and\r\nPost-office Departments. Its officers should be empowered to enter all\r\nrailroad offices and examine the companies' books, board trains and\r\nemploy other legal means to detect violations of the railroad law and\r\nreport them to the chief of the bureau.\r\n\r\nRailroad companies might be permitted to make interstate rates, but all\r\nschedules should be submitted to the bureau for approval or revision.\r\nLegal provision should be made against every sort of speculation in\r\nrailroad stocks on the part of railroad officers, who should, in\r\naddition, be prohibited from sharing in the profits of favorite rates,\r\nas at present. All executive officers and directors of railroad\r\ncompanies should, like officers of national banks, be required to\r\nqualify by taking an oath of office, and should be held to strict\r\naccountability for their official acts. Officers of railroad companies\r\nshould not be allowed to receive and use proxies at stockholders'\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nThe director-general should have the power, when he has proof that a\r\nrailroad manager is persistently violating the law, to remove him and to\r\nappoint a receiver to take charge of the road until its owners can make\r\nprovision and furnish sufficient guarantee for a more responsible\r\nmanagement. Such a procedure would not be without analogy in the sphere\r\nof Federal authority. The Comptroller of the Currency is authorized by\r\nlaw to remove the derelict officials of a national bank and place its\r\nbusiness in charge of a receiver. The beneficial effect of this\r\nprovision is evinced in the extreme rareness of such a step. When\r\nrailroad managers are held responsible for their own official acts, as\r\nwell as for those of their subordinates, and when all railroad\r\ntransgressions are visited upon their source in such a manner as to be\r\nremembered by the stings of disgrace and of a blighted career,\r\nunfaithful railroad managers will be extremely rare.\r\n\r\nThe plan here outlined is of course capable of being greatly improved.\r\nExperience only is a reliable guide as to the merits of the various\r\ndetails of such a system of control. What is needed above all things is\r\na beginning, the establishment of the principle of complete control of\r\nrailroad transportation by the State and the Nation. When this step is\r\nonce taken, the friends of railroad reform may safely trust to time for\r\nthe solution of the subordinate questions of this important problem.\r\n\r\nBy thorough State and Federal supervision of the railroad business many\r\nof the present abuses can be prevented. But the temptations of railroad\r\nmanagers to violate the law will continue to exist as long as the\r\nspeculative element is permitted to remain in railroad securities. To\r\nremove the fountain-head of the evil eventually, the way should\r\ngradually be paved for a change in railroad organization and ownership\r\nwhich would also greatly increase the responsibility and efficiency of\r\nrailroad management. In the beginning of the railroad era, nearly all,\r\nand not unfrequently all the capital needed for the construction of a\r\nnew line was supposed to be furnished by the company's stockholders. But\r\nas it often happened that the cost of construction considerably exceeded\r\nthe original estimate, the State authorized railroad companies to\r\nmortgage their property for the purpose of raising the money necessary\r\nto complete the road. In time this provision of the law was taken\r\nadvantage of by speculative stockholders to such an extent that roads\r\nwere often bonded for the full amount necessary to construct them, and\r\neven for more, while the stock was issued simply as a bonus to the\r\npromoters and the bondholders of the road. But as the bonds and shares\r\nscarcely ever remain in the same hands, such a condition was eventually\r\nbrought about that roads were controlled by those who had little or\r\nnothing invested in the enterprise, and their real owners were deprived\r\nof all influence in their management, retaining only the right to\r\nforeclose their mortgages when things came to the worst. It is evident\r\nthat men who have only a speculative interest in property cannot have\r\nthe same concern for its permanent value and prosperity as those who\r\nhold it as a permanent investment. Many of the railroad abuses of the\r\npast had their origin in the law permitting the bonding of railroad\r\nproperty. Were it desirable to make a property for the sole use and\r\nconvenience of speculators and gamblers, a better scheme could hardly be\r\ndevised than the present system of our railroad organizations. Were\r\nrailroad companies organized like national banks, were each shareholder\r\nrequired to pay the full amount of the face value of his shares, and\r\nwere mortgaging railroad property entirely prohibited, it is not likely\r\nthat the proportion of bankrupted railroads would be any larger than\r\nthat of bankrupted banks. Few, if any, railroads would be built for\r\npurely speculative or blackmailing purposes.\r\n\r\nCapital is naturally conservative, and speculation is only invited where\r\nthe chances of gain are greatly out of proportion to the capital\r\ninvested. Were the principle of ownership which applies to national\r\nbanks and other well regulated corporations also applied to the\r\nrailroads, and were bonds entirely abolished, only such persons would\r\nby the shareholders be placed in charge of their property as could give\r\nto them the best assurance of honest and conservative management. Such a\r\nchange would greatly increase public confidence in, and the value of,\r\nrailroad securities, and would eventually place them above bank stock as\r\ndesirable investments. With the great fluctuations which under present\r\ncircumstances obtain in railroad stocks, these securities are regarded\r\nas unsafe and unsatisfactory investments by conservative people. During\r\na period of less than twelve months in 1891 and 1892 the stock of the\r\nAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe fluctuated from 28-1/2 to 43-1/2, or 53\r\nper cent.; that of the Chesapeake and Ohio from 15-1/4 to 25-7/8, or 70\r\nper cent.; of the Chicago and Northwestern from 101 to 118, or 17 per\r\ncent.; of the Chicago, Saint Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha from 20-1/2 to\r\n38-1/2, or 88 per cent.; of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul from\r\n48-3/4 to 78-1/2, or 61 per cent.; of the Iowa Central from 6-1/2 to 13,\r\nor 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nIf we look over the stock quotations of the past ten or twelve years we\r\nfind still greater fluctuations. The following table, taken from the\r\n_United States Investor_, shows the range of prices of a few of the\r\nprincipal stocks during this period:\r\n\r\n        Name.

It is a gross outrage upon the investing public to let this\r\nstate of affairs continue. It should be corrected without delay.\r\n\r\nHow many high officials in charge of railroad property will under these\r\ncircumstances resist the temptation to speculate in the stock of their\r\ncompanies, and, so long as it is permitted, how many will resist the\r\ntemptation to adopt such policies in the government of their roads as\r\nwill cause such fluctuations? It is a common report that it is not an\r\nunfrequent occurrence for Senators and members of Congress to receive\r\ninformation from railway officials that enables them to raise their\r\ncampaign funds by speculation in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry C. Adams, statistician of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nsays in his third annual report:\r\n\r\n      \"It certainly appears ... that the motive for ownership in\r\n      railroad stock is quite different from the ordinary motives\r\n      which lead men to invest in corporate enterprises, thus\r\n      presenting an additional proof that railways are a business\r\n      not subject to ordinary business rules.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no safer business in the world than railroad transportation;\r\nthere is none that has less elements of uncertainty; none whose returns\r\nin the aggregate are less varying. Every other business in the country,\r\nwhether prospering or struggling, pays tribute to it. It rests on a cash\r\nbasis, and suffers probably less from hard times than any business of\r\nits magnitude. Both the merchant and the manufacturer run large risks in\r\ndoing business largely on a credit basis. The farmer sows in the spring,\r\nharvests in the fall, and often cannot realize on his products until\r\nwinter; but the railroad company always receives its pay as soon as its\r\nwork is done, and not unfrequently even before it is done. Statistics\r\nshow that railroad revenues are, in the aggregate, remarkably uniform,\r\nand there is no reason why railroad securities should be less stable\r\nthan bank or insurance stocks. Mr. Jeans says:\r\n\r\n      \"It is observable, in respect to the net profits from\r\n      railway working, that they have not fluctuated from year to\r\n      year in the same way as nearly all other profits have\r\n      done.... It comes, then, to this, that, next after land and\r\n      house property, the railway interest is the largest and most\r\n      important in the country. But it is superior to both of\r\n      these rival interests in its profit-earning capabilities,\r\n      yielding, as it does, more than 4 per cent. on the capital\r\n      expended, against a possible average of 2-1/2 to 3 per cent.\r\n      in respect to the others.\"\r\n\r\nThere may be some arguments in favor of bonding railroads, but this\r\npractice is, upon the whole, productive of infinitely more evil than\r\ngood. The State should, therefore, compel railroad companies to\r\nliquidate all of their bonded indebtedness without unnecessary delay. In\r\nthe proportion in which this is accomplished railroad shares will gain\r\nin stability and value.\r\n\r\nRailroad men complain that the small savings of the poor invested in\r\nrailroad securities do not yield adequate returns and are often lost in\r\nconsequence of the foreclosing of the roads in which these investments\r\nhave been made. Others complain that railroads are bankrupted in the\r\ninterest of designing bondholders. Still others charge that rich and\r\npowerful roads contrive to obtain a controlling interest in the\r\ndepreciated stock of weaker roads and then manage these roads in their\r\nown interest and greatly to the detriment of other stockholders. All\r\nthese evils would disappear if the law required the identity of actual\r\nand virtual ownership. \"Freezing-out\" processes could no longer be\r\nresorted to by expert directors to obtain without compensation the\r\nproperty of their less sophisticated fellow stockholders. One railroad\r\ncould no longer obtain control of another by acquiring an insignificant\r\npart of the sum total of its securities. There would be no longer any\r\nclashing between the interests of bondholders and stockholders, and\r\nrailroads would no longer be managed in the interest of a small minority\r\nof their owners.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cancellation of all railroad mortgages the State\r\nshould require that all railroad stocks should, in the future, be paid\r\nin full. Furthermore, roads should be built only from the proceeds of\r\nthe capital stock, and the expense of repairs should be defrayed from\r\nthe revenues of the road. Dividends should only be paid from surplus\r\nearnings and should in no case exceed a fair rate of interest on the\r\nactual present value of the road. The statistician to the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission suggests the creation of a special commission\r\ncharged with the duty of converting the actual capitalization of\r\nrailroad lines into a just value of their property. To do justice to\r\nboth the railroads and their patrons in the fixing of rates, it is\r\nimportant that the just value of railroad property be ascertained, but\r\nthe work could probably be done with less friction by a coöperation of\r\nNational and State commissions. A number of reforms are needed within\r\nthe province of railroad management. Passenger rates are, as a rule, too\r\nhigh, and out of all proportion to freight rates. Many passenger\r\ntariffs still recognize the old stage-coach principle of fixing the fare\r\nin an exact proportion to the distance traveled. Thus a passenger who\r\ntakes the train for a five-mile trip pays only fifteen cents for his own\r\ntransportation and that of one hundred pounds of baggage, while the\r\npassenger who buys a ticket for a journey of one hundred miles pays, on\r\nmost American lines, exactly twenty times the amount paid by the\r\nfive-mile passenger. Here the principle of collecting terminal charges\r\nis entirely ignored. Sufficient inducements are not held out to the\r\npassenger to prolong his journey, and as a consequence of this\r\nshort-sighted policy of the railroad companies the average distance\r\ntraveled in the United States by each passenger, instead of having\r\ngradually increased, has gradually decreased of late years until it is\r\nnow only 24.18 miles. The average freight haul in the United States is\r\n120 miles, or about five times as long as the average journey per\r\npassenger. How can such a difference be accounted for except by the\r\ndissimilarity in the principles which govern the computation of\r\npassenger and freight charges? The same rule should be adopted in fixing\r\npassenger rates that is recognized by railroad men in fixing freight\r\nrates: the rate per mile should decrease with the increase of the number\r\nof miles traveled.\r\n\r\nThe principle of arranging passenger tariffs on a sliding scale has\r\nfound recognition in Europe. In Denmark first-class passenger fare is\r\n3.13 cents for each of the first 47 miles, 2.67 cents for each of the\r\nnext 47 miles, and only 2.22 cents for every additional mile. The\r\npractical application of this principle is, in fact, only limited by the\r\nextent of the kingdom. In nearly all European countries a uniform\r\nreduction, ranging from 20 to 30 per cent., is made from regular rates\r\nfor return trip tickets, and coupon tickets are issued to tourists\r\nalmost everywhere at largely reduced rates.\r\n\r\nHungary recently adopted a new method of making passenger and freight\r\ntariffs for its state lines. This is now generally called the zone\r\nsystem. There are two classes of tickets sold, one for short trips on\r\nsuburban or branch lines, the other for longer journeys on the main\r\nlines. The distances that can be traveled on short or suburban lines are\r\ndivided into two zones of stations, and those on main lines into\r\nfourteen zones. The division of the kingdom into zones is made with\r\nBuda-Pesth as the center. A ticket purchased for a particular zone\r\ncarries the passenger to the end of that zone or any nearer station.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the extent of each zone and the fares\r\npaid:\r\n\r\n  --------------+---------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n                |               |   LOCAL TRAINS.    |   FAST TRAINS.\r\n       ZONE     |   DISTANCE    |------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                |               |First |Second|Third |First |Second|Third\r\n                |               |Class.|Class.|Class.|Class.|Class.|Class.\r\n  --------------+---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n    Short Lines.|               |  Fl. |  Fl. |  Fl. |  Fl. |  Fl. |  Fl.\r\n                |First Station. | 0.30 | 0.15 |  .10 |  -   |  -   |  -\r\n                |Second Station.|  .40 |  .22 |  .15 |  -   |  -   |  -\r\n    Main Lines. |               |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n       1        |    1-25 km.   |  .50 |  .40 |  .25 | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.30\r\n       2        |   26-40  \"    | 1.00 |  .80 |  .50 | 1.20 | 1.00 |  .60\r\n       3        |   41-55  \"    | 1.50 | 1.20 |  .75 | 1.80 | 1.50 |  .90\r\n       4        |   56-70  \"    | 2.00 | 1.60 | 1.00 | 2.40 | 2.00 | 1.20\r\n       5        |   71-85  \"    | 2.50 | 2.00 | 1.25 | 3.00 | 2.50 | 1.50\r\n       6        |   86-100 \"    | 3.00 | 2.40 | 1.50 | 3.60 | 3.00 | 1.80\r\n       7        |  101-115 \"    | 3.50 | 2.80 | 1.75 | 4.20 | 3.50 | 2.10\r\n       8        |  116-130 \"    | 4.00 | 3.20 | 2.00 | 4.80 | 4.00 | 2.40\r\n       9        |  131-145 \"    | 4.50 | 3.60 | 2.25 | 5.40 | 4.50 | 2.70\r\n      10        |  146-160 \"    | 5.00 | 4.00 | 2.50 | 6.00 | 5.00 | 3.00\r\n      11        |  161-175 \"    | 5.50 | 4.40 | 2.75 | 6.60 | 5.50 | 3.30\r\n      12        |  176-200 \"    | 6.00 | 4.80 | 3.00 | 7.20 | 6.00 | 3.60\r\n      13        |  201-225 \"    | 7.00 | 5.30 | 3.50 | 8.40 | 6.50 | 4.20\r\n      14        |  225 km.      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n                |    and over   | 8.00 | 5.80 | 4.00 | 9.60 | 7.00 | 4.80\r\n\r\n(The florin is a little more than one-third of a dollar.)\r\n\r\nA ride from a city to the first suburban station costs from 3 to 10\r\ncents, according to class of car, and to the second station 5 to 13.6\r\ncents. On through trains a person may travel 15 miles at a cost of from\r\n8-1/2 to 20 cents, according to kind of train and class of car, a\r\nhundred miles for from 85 cents to $2.00; 140 miles for from $1.15 to\r\n$2.80 and any distance above 140 miles for from $1.35 to $3.25. A person\r\nmay thus travel from Buda-Pesth to Predeal, a distance of 472 miles,\r\nwith a third-class ticket for zone 14, purchased at a cost of $1.35, or\r\n28-100 of a cent per mile.\r\n\r\nOur railroad men with much complacency point to the fact that these\r\nrates do not cover the forwarding of passengers' baggage and that this\r\nservice must be paid for separately. These charges, however, are very\r\nmoderate, being on 120 pounds of baggage 8-1/3 cents a distance of 34\r\nmiles or less, about 17 cents for a distance of more than 34 and less\r\nthan 62 miles, and about 34 cents for any distance over 62 miles. The\r\nadditional charge for carrying 120 pounds of baggage from Buda-Pesth to\r\nPredeal is therefore about one-fourteenth of one cent per mile. It must\r\nbe admitted that this system of charging separately for passenger and\r\nbaggage is eminently just, for there is no good reason why the passenger\r\nwithout baggage should be taxed to pay for the carriage of that of his\r\nfellow-traveler.\r\n\r\nThe zone tariff was introduced on the state railways of Hungary by M.\r\nBarosz, the Hungarian Minister of Commerce, on the 1st of August, 1889.\r\nThe adoption of the new tariff was ridiculed and condemned as visionary\r\nby road experts, who even went so far as to prove to the satisfaction of\r\npractical railroad men that the innovation was destined to be a failure.\r\nFor a month or two it almost seemed as if their prediction might be\r\nfulfilled, the number of passengers carried remaining behind the number\r\ncarried during the corresponding period of previous years. But soon the\r\nreaction set in. The month of November, 1889, already witnessed an\r\nincrease in the number of passengers as well as in receipts over the\r\nsame month of the year previous. The result of the first year's trial\r\ndemonstrated the wisdom of the \"innovation.\" The number of passengers\r\ncarried, which had been only 5,186,227 in 1888-89, rose to 13,060,751 in\r\n1889-90, and the total receipts for passengers and baggage rose from\r\n9,138,715 florins to 11,186,321 florins, a gain of 2,047,606 florins, or\r\n22 per cent., during the first year. There is a continued increase both\r\nin the number of passengers and in receipts, and the success of the\r\nsystem must be pronounced phenomenal. The railroad experts of Europe,\r\nwho had predicted the signal failure of the zone system, now that the\r\nunexpected has happened, are trying to discover the particular favorable\r\nconditions which made the success of the system possible in Hungary. It\r\nwill probably be a decade, or even two, before the railroad experts of\r\nboth hemispheres will be entirely reconciled to this new application of\r\nthe old principle that a reduction in the price of a commodity increases\r\nthe demand for it.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, indeed, that intelligent men should be so slow in\r\nrecognizing an economic principle for which both history and daily\r\nexperience furnish an unlimited number of illustrations. The post-office\r\nreceipts everywhere have increased with a reduction in postage. The\r\nGovernment telegraph in England did not become self-supporting until\r\nParliament made a sweeping reduction in its rates. The revenue from the\r\nBrooklyn bridge never paid a fair interest on the capital expended in\r\nits construction until its tolls were cut down. Were it necessary,\r\nhundreds of other examples could be added to these.\r\n\r\nHungary has also applied the zone system to its freight traffic. Three\r\nzones are fixed for the carrying of goods, viz.: Zone I, for distances\r\nless than 200 kilometers (124 miles); Zone II, for distances over 200\r\nand less than 400 kilometers, and Zone III, for distances over 400\r\nkilometers. A uniform tariff is established for each zone, which is\r\none-third less than the average freight rates for equal distances\r\nformerly in force. American railroads should profit by the wisdom and\r\nexperience of the Hungarian Government, and adopt at an early day such\r\nfeatures of its system as upon our soil and under our institutions may\r\nbe made practicable. The Hungarian system, with some modifications, is\r\nnow being tried by Austria and a few of the German states, and is\r\nincreasing railroad revenues wherever adopted.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing demand for lower fares. This demand increases in the\r\nsame proportion in which the desire and the necessity for travel\r\nincrease. European states have not been slow to meet it. Reductions are\r\nmade everywhere, and chiefly favor the lower classes. Thus, when France,\r\nwithin the last year, changed her passenger tariff, she reduced\r\nfirst-class fare 9 per cent., second-class fare 18 per cent., and\r\nthird-class 27 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe European passenger reports show the numbers of first and\r\nsecond-class passengers are continually falling off, while those of the\r\nthird-class passengers are fast increasing. In England and Wales the\r\nnumber of first-class passengers fell between 1875 and 1889 from\r\n37,000,000 to 24,000,000 while the number of third-class passengers\r\nincreased during that same period from 350,000,000 to 601,000,000, and\r\nthis increase still continues. In the United Kingdom the number of\r\nthird-class passengers for 1891 was over 750,000,000. Furthermore,\r\npassenger revenue comes chiefly from the third class. In the United\r\nKingdom the receipts from first-class passengers were in 1889\r\n£3,188,000; from second-class passengers, £2,705,000; and from\r\nthird-class passengers, £19,785,000. It is thus seen that receipts from\r\nthird-class passengers are nearly 3-1/2 times as large as those from the\r\nfirst and second-class passengers combined. A similar proportion is\r\nfound in nearly every country on the continent. European roads\r\ndiscovered some years ago that first and second-class passengers were\r\ncarried at a loss, and all the passenger earnings were derived from\r\nthird-class passengers. The profits from this source show a considerable\r\nincrease every year.\r\n\r\nThe average fare per mile is 2.15 cents in the United States, and only\r\n1.17 cents in Germany, 1.67 cents in Austria, 1.18 cents in Belgium,\r\n1.29 cents in Denmark, 1.45 cents in France, 1.64 cents in Italy, and\r\n1.45 cents in Russia. It is often claimed by railroad men that we travel\r\nmore luxuriously than the people of any other country in the world, but\r\nit should not be forgotten that traveling in the United States is also\r\nmore expensive than anywhere else. It is contended that class\r\ndistinctions are odious in America, and that second and third-class cars\r\nwould not be patronized. The same argument might be applied to theaters,\r\nhotels, clothiers, grocers, etc. It is difficult to see why distinction\r\nhere should be less odious than on the railroad train. The truth is,\r\nAmericans are just like other people and will avail themselves of\r\naccommodations in keeping with their means if they have the opportunity.\r\nMany passengers who will not travel in an uncouth smoking-car would, if\r\nclean second-class cars were provided, gladly dispense with the luxury\r\nof an upholstered seat if by doing so they could save from $5 to $10 a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nA common laborer in this country earns from a dollar to a dollar and a\r\nhalf a day, and in the performance of his labor as a rule suffers\r\ngreater inconvenience than does the traveler who travels the country in\r\na second-class car. Is it under these circumstances at all likely that\r\nthe American would hesitate to travel for a day in a plain but clean\r\ncar, if by doing so he could save a week's earnings? We may even go\r\nfurther and say that it is a very reasonable assumption that the man who\r\nearns his bread by the sweat of his brow would choose the cheaper car if\r\nthe difference in one day's fare were equal to one day's wages. It is a\r\ncommon saying in Europe that the first-class passengers consist of lords\r\nand fools, and few of the hundreds of thousands of American tourists\r\ntraveling abroad give the natives occasion to class them with either.\r\nThe first-class car has almost fallen into disuse in Europe, and even\r\nthe patronage of the second-class is less than ten per cent, of that of\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\nReduced rates for return tickets should be provided under rules and\r\nregulations of commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts legislature recently passed a law requiring the\r\nrailways of that State to sell interchangeable thousand-mile tickets for\r\n$20. The State commission is given power to except any company from its\r\nrequirements if the public welfare or the financial condition require or\r\ndemand it. This is a step in the right direction and should be followed\r\nby other States. Michigan also requires certain roads to carry\r\nfirst-class passengers at two cents per mile.\r\n\r\nRailroad companies should be compelled to discard the pass as a\r\ncourtesy as well as a consideration. The giving of passes under the\r\nguise of mileage books, or tickets for pretended or unnecessary\r\nservices, is very pernicious and should be prohibited. Such a reform\r\nwould soon enable them to offer low fares to all. An employe may be\r\nfurnished free transportation while actually engaged in the business of\r\nhis company, and it should be made the duty of the State and National\r\ncommissions to make proper regulations governing such free\r\ntransportation of employes. Half-fare tickets for adults should also be\r\nabolished. The pauper ticket is given to the minister of the gospel to\r\nsecure for the railroads the influence of the pulpit, though offered\r\nunder the pretense of charity or support of the church. The State should\r\nnot permit the railroad companies to practice this or any other kind of\r\ncharity at the expense of the general public. The railroad is a highway,\r\nand the company operating it is entitled to rates sufficient to pay\r\noperating expenses and a fair interest on the value of the property. It\r\ncan therefore easily be seen that the so-called gifts show no liberality\r\non the part of the railroad company, but are made at the expense of\r\nother people. Donations made by railroad companies should be made from\r\nthe pockets of their stockholders and not from the pockets of their\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nAll perquisites of railroad officers should be abolished. When a railway\r\nofficial has become so pompous and consequential that he requires a\r\nspecial car, it is about time to look about for his successor. If we are\r\nto have a special-car aristocracy in this country let it be supported at\r\nthe expense of some other interest.\r\n\r\nAnother railroad reform is needed on this side of the Atlantic. While\r\nthe great majority of railroad officials are courteous and considerate,\r\nand perform their duties in the most agreeable and acceptable manner,\r\nthere are a few who do not properly appreciate the relation which they\r\nsustain to the patrons of their companies. They are inclined to forget\r\nthat they are quasi-public servants, and that the public has a right to\r\ndemand courteous treatment at their hands. All railroad employes should\r\nrealize that their first duty is to administer to the welfare and the\r\nconvenience of the public, and each one should have the full protection\r\nof the law in his efforts to do so. The American public objects much\r\nless to an inferior car than to rude treatment by the companies' agents.\r\nRailroad superintendents may justly be blamed for the incivilities of\r\ntheir subordinates. It is their duty to know the character of those whom\r\nthey employ, and not to retain in their employ those who are derelict in\r\ntheir duty to the public. Nothing offends the feelings of a true\r\nAmerican more than the display of a bureaucratic spirit on the part of\r\npublic servants. Nothing more commends a line of railroad to the public\r\nthan uniform painstaking kindness and courteous treatment on the part of\r\nits employes. It is made the duty of railroad employes of France \"to so\r\ntreat the public as if they were eager to oblige it,\" and the very first\r\nparagraph of the official instructions to the railroad employes of\r\nGermany enjoins them \"to assume a modest and polite demeanor in their\r\nintercourse with the public.\" In this connection it might be stated that\r\nthe second paragraph of those instructions positively forbids the\r\nacceptance of any gratuity by a railroad employe. If our American\r\nsleeping and dining-car companies would give their employes adequate\r\ncompensation and then adopt and enforce the German rule concerning\r\n\"tipping,\" their service would gain popularity and their employes\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nEntrance into the railway service should be by agreement for a definite\r\ntime, and dismissals and resignations should be governed by rules agreed\r\nupon by boards of commissioners and the companies.\r\n\r\nThe use of the corporation has done so much to secure for capital so\r\nlarge a share of the profits of industrial enterprises, and large\r\nsalaries also for the officers who manage them, that laborers have been\r\nled to organize themselves into associations for like purposes, and\r\nambitious men have not been slow in availing themselves of the\r\nadvantages afforded them in this new field.\r\n\r\nIt is right and proper for laborers to organize such associations when\r\nthey can do so under wise and economical management, for the purpose of\r\nsecuring greater intelligence, better education, higher culture, higher\r\nwages, a shorter work-day, and a general ameliorating of their\r\ncondition, all of which will tend to make them more efficient workmen\r\nand also better enable them to resist the aggression of centralized\r\nwealth; for, in the absence of organization, the single-handed employe\r\nof the great modern employer is comparatively helpless. But if these\r\norganizations are allowed to be controlled by ignorant, unreasonable or\r\ndesigning men, who will, at trifling provocations, resort to violent and\r\nunlawful measures, they are sure to prove harmful, and a great\r\ndetriment, instead of a help, to their members, and the sooner they are\r\nabandoned the better for all.\r\n\r\nGreat conflicts are sure to arise between organized capital and\r\norganized labor, and they must be settled in a reasonable way, or\r\nanarchy will prevail. They cannot be left for headstrong or\r\ninconsiderate men representing either side to determine, but the line\r\nmust be drawn by the public authorities.\r\n\r\nEach year affords accumulated evidence of the necessity of extending\r\nlegal restrictions over the management of the railway business, and the\r\nlaw, as laid down by Judge Ricks to the Ann Arbor strikers last March,\r\nin the United States Circuit Court, at Toledo, is undoubtedly correct\r\nand will meet with general approval from the public.\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n      \"You are engaged in a service of a public character, and the\r\n      public are interested not only in the way in which you\r\n      perform your duties while you continue in that service, but\r\n      are quite as much interested in the time and circumstances\r\n      under which you quit that employment. You cannot always\r\n      choose your own time and place for terminating these\r\n      relations. If you are permitted to do so you might quit your\r\n      work at a time and place and under circumstances which would\r\n      involve irreparable damage to your employers and jeopardize\r\n      the lives of the traveling public.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Powderly, in commenting upon the above decision, does not complain\r\nof it, but says:\r\n\r\n      \"The decision shows, as I have said before, that the\r\n      principle of Government ownership of the railroads is being\r\n      recognized by the courts. While the decision is apparently\r\n      against the men, it emphasizes our position that the\r\n      Government has the right to supervise the railroads. Now it\r\n      is a poor rule that won't work both ways.\r\n\r\n      \"The Interstate Commerce Law was passed for the purpose of\r\n      controlling the railroads, but up to date no railroad has\r\n      paid any attention to the law. Anarchy of the worst kind has\r\n      prevailed. By that I mean a total disregard of the law, and\r\n      that is what the corporations charge against the anarchists.\r\n      The courts hold themselves in readiness to obey the will of\r\n      the corporations when a charge is made against the workmen,\r\n      but no effort is made to carry out the mandates of the law\r\n      when the provokers of strikes, the corporations, violate the\r\n      law.\"\r\n\r\nThere is but little doubt, if the judges of the Federal courts would\r\nshow the same zeal in holding railroad managers amenable to the law as\r\nJudge Ricks has displayed in this case with the employes, they would\r\nsecure increased confidence from the people in the tribunals over which\r\nthey preside.\r\n\r\nAll fair-minded persons will agree that labor as well as capital must be\r\nsubjected to proper restraints, and that the public will demand nothing\r\nunreasonable from either.\r\n\r\nAccidents are too frequent upon American railroads. The reports of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission give the following as the numbers killed\r\nand injured during the years named:\r\n\r\n  ---------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n           |      1888     |      1889     |      1890     |      1891\r\n           |Killed.

There was, therefore, one death for every 306 men employed and\r\none injury for every 33 men employed. For the previous year one was\r\nkilled for every 357 men employed, and one was injured for every 35 men\r\nemployed. While trainmen represent but 20 per cent, of the total number\r\nof employes, the casualties among them represent 58 per cent. of the\r\ntotal number of casualties.\r\n\r\nFor the year 1888, one passenger was killed in every 1,523,133\r\npassengers carried, and one injured in every 220,024 carried.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding rate in England for the year 1888 is one passenger\r\nkilled for every 6,942,336 carried, and one injured for every 527,577\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nRailroads doing a large business should be compelled to adopt the most\r\nimproved appliances for avoidance of accidents.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of trainmen is especially hazardous, and too long\r\ncontinued service should not be required, but proper intervals of rest\r\nshould be allowed. It is to the want of this, undoubtedly, that a great\r\nmany of the serious accidents are owing.\r\n\r\nNo more Sunday trains should be run than are absolutely necessary.\r\nProvision should be made by law to enable trainmen to procure insurance\r\nat the lowest rate possible, for indemnity against loss of health, life\r\nor limb.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few days before the great disaster occurred on the Hudson\r\nRiver Railroad at Hastings, over a year ago, that an announcement had\r\nbeen made to the public of the extreme prosperity of the road during the\r\nyear. The great slaughter that occurred there is another illustration of\r\nthe disregard of public duty, and another instance of the sacrifice of\r\nlife and limbs of passengers and employes by a railway corporation in\r\norder to secure large dividends on watered stock. It is not only gross,\r\nbut criminal neglect for a company with such an immense income not to\r\nprovide greater safety appliances, and the coroner's jury in this case\r\nwas too modest when it decided that the management of the road was\r\nmorally responsible for the disaster.\r\n\r\nParliament has compelled the British railways to adopt, in the interest\r\nof the public safety, the block system and continuous brake, and great\r\nlines like the New York Central and Hudson River companies should be\r\ncompelled to adopt such improvements.\r\n\r\nThe traveling public has another grievous cause for complaint. There are\r\nbut few companies that make any efforts to have their trains connect\r\nwith those of rival roads. On the contrary, a good deal of scheming is\r\noften done by railroad companies to so arrange their time-tables with\r\nreference to those of their rivals as to inconvenience passengers as\r\nmuch as possible by delays at competing points. To remedy this evil the\r\nState should require that every time-table should have the approval of\r\nproper authorities, and no change should be permitted without their\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nRailroad companies are chartered for the purpose of promoting the public\r\nwelfare, and every violation of their charter should be punished.\r\n\r\nIt should be the main object of railroad legislation to compel companies\r\nto fulfill their public obligations without depriving them of their\r\nefficiency. Above all things these companies should be stripped of the\r\npower to use their great wealth for the purposes of corruption or the\r\nattainment of political influence. Our railroads to-day probably\r\nrepresent no less than one-fourth of the personal property of the\r\ncountry, and this vast wealth is controlled by a comparatively small\r\nnumber of men, many of whom have in the course of time become so\r\narrogant and despotic that they have little regard for popular rights or\r\nthe expressed will of a free people.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that when, a few years ago, a representative of the press\r\ndirected Mr. Vanderbilt's attention to the fact that the public\r\ndisapproved of his railroad policy, the latter gave vent to his contempt\r\nfor public opinion by the no less profane than laconic reply: \"The\r\npublic be damned.\" Ex-Railroad Commissioner Coffin called on one of the\r\nGoulds to urge the adoption of the automatic car-coupler and other\r\nsafety appliances for the roads controlled by them. He was very curtly\r\ntold that not a cent would be expended by the Gould roads for such a\r\npurpose until the West had repealed its obnoxious railroad laws. The\r\nGould dynasty thus intends to accomplish the repeal of these laws by\r\ncoercion. Railroad magnates and their lieutenants often show still\r\ngreater arrogance in dealing directly with their employes.\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult for railroad managers of the present school to adapt\r\nthemselves to new conditions; it may be impossible for them to\r\nunderstand how any other practices than those which have long been\r\nestablished can succeed; yet in spite of them both the law and public\r\nsentiment have already undergone great changes, and still greater\r\nchanges will follow. It may take years to accomplish this work; to bring\r\nabout any great reform requires time and a deter, mined purpose on the\r\npart of its advocates. Yet I believe the era is not far off when\r\nrailroads will be limited to their legitimate sphere as common carriers,\r\nwhen they will treat all persons and all places as impartially as does\r\nthe Government in the mail service, when their chief factor in\r\nrate-making will be the cost of service, when they will respect the\r\nrights of the public and those of their stockholders, insuring perfect\r\nservice to the former and fair profits upon the actual value of the\r\nlines operated to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe fact should, finally, not be overlooked that it is in the power of\r\nthe General Government to prevent many railroad abuses, and especially\r\nexcessive freight charges, by the improvement of our rivers and harbors.\r\nThat our water-courses act as levelers of interstate rates is apparent\r\nfrom the fact that railroad rates invariably rise with the freezing of\r\nthe water-ways and fall with the opening of river and lake navigation.\r\nBy connecting, wherever feasible, our large Western rivers with the\r\ngreat lakes, the Government could greatly extend the reign of\r\ncompetition in transportation, and thereby keep freight rates within\r\nreasonable bounds. Lake transportation even now plays an important role.\r\nIn 1892 it was not less than 20,000,000,000 ton miles during the season\r\nof eight months' duration, and it is almost equal to one-fourth of the\r\ntotal ton mileage of all the railroads in the country for the entire\r\nyear. The average rate of lake transportation has been reduced to 1.3\r\nmills per ton per mile, which is only about one-seventh of the average\r\nrailroad freight rate in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhere the masses hold the sovereign power, there, if anywhere, the\r\nwelfare of the people should be the supreme law. Violent political\r\ncommotions never disturb the government whose policy is to secure the\r\ngreatest good to the greatest number. Thorold Rogers justly remarks that\r\nthe strength of communism lies in the misconduct of administrations, the\r\nsustentation of odious and unjust privileges and the support of what are\r\ncalled vested interests. Lord Coleridge, in a remarkable article\r\npublished not long ago, recommended a revision of the laws relating to\r\nproperty and contract, in order to facilitate the inevitable transition\r\nfrom feudalism to democracy, and laid down the rule that the laws of\r\nproperty should be made for the benefit of all, and not for the benefit\r\nof a class.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages, and even up to the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, nearly all the laws on the statute books looked towards the\r\nprotection of the rights of the feudal lord. Provision was made for the\r\nexpeditious collection of his dues and a severe punishment of his\r\ndelinquent debtor. The peasant was forced to labor fifteen hours per day\r\nand three hundred and sixty-five days in the year to pay the baron's\r\nrentals and sustain life. The law permitted him to be flogged for\r\nfailing to courtesy the feudal lord, and to be executed for injury to\r\nthe lord's person, while to kill a peasant was no worse a misdemeanor\r\nthan to kill his lordship's favorite dog or falcon. In short, all laws\r\nwere made to protect and perpetuate the wealth and power of the few by\r\nimpoverishing, humbling and enslaving the masses.\r\n\r\nThe age of feudalism has given way to an age of democratic liberty, but\r\nthere is many a feudal feature left in our statutes and many a feudal\r\ndoctrine is enunciated by our judges and learned expounders of modern\r\njurisprudence. In his decision in the Iowa tariff case Judge Brewer\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n      \"I read also in the first section of the Bill of Rights of\r\n      this State [Iowa] that 'all men are by nature free and equal\r\n      and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those\r\n      of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring,\r\n      possessing and protecting property and pursuing and\r\n      obtaining safety and happiness,' and I know that while that\r\n      remains as the supreme law of the State, no legislature can,\r\n      directly or indirectly, lay its withering or destroying hand\r\n      on a single dollar invested in the legitimate business of\r\n      transportation.\"\r\n\r\nHad Judge Brewer taken the pains to read on, he would have found in\r\nsection 2 of the Bill of Rights the following:\r\n\r\n      \"All political power is inherent in the people; government\r\n      is instituted for the protection, security and benefit of\r\n      the people.\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the learned Judge failed to see the difference\r\nbetween \"men,\" the creatures of God, \"by nature free and equal,\" and\r\n\"possessing certain inalienable rights,\" and corporations, the creatures\r\nof man, having no rights except those which the State sees fit to give\r\nthem. Had the learned Judge perused the whole of the document to which\r\nhe refers, he would have found in article VIII, section 12, the\r\nfollowing provision:\r\n\r\n      \"The General Assembly shall have power to amend or repeal\r\n      all laws for the organization or creation of corporations,\r\n      or granting of special or exclusive privileges or\r\n      immunities, by a vote of two-thirds of each branch of the\r\n      General Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nIt should thus have been plain to the learned Judge that in Iowa\r\ncorporations have not human or inalienable rights, and government was\r\nnot instituted for their special protection, but for the protection,\r\nsecurity and benefit of her people. Nor should it be otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe corporation for pecuniary gain has neither body nor soul. Its\r\ncorporeal existence is mythical and ethereal. It suffers neither from\r\ncold nor from hunger, has neither fear of future punishment nor hope of\r\nfuture reward. It takes no interest in schools or in churches. It knows\r\nneither charity nor love, neither pity nor sympathy, neither justice nor\r\npatriotism. It is deaf and blind to human woe and human happiness. Its\r\nonly aim is pecuniary gain, to which it subordinates all else.\r\n\r\nShould the State sacrifice the welfare of all her people rather than lay\r\nits \"withering or destroying\" hand on a single dollar of corporate\r\nwealth? Are there no human rights, for the protection of which\r\ngovernment was established, more sacred than the rights of a wealthy\r\ncorporation's dollar? Have the people made the judiciary a coördinate\r\nbranch of the Government in order that it may protect the vested or\r\nrather usurped rights of corporations against legislative attempts to\r\ncurtail them? If the courts so interpret the power which has been\r\ndelegated to them, they will awake one day to the painful reality that\r\npopular convictions of right are more potent than judicial decrees.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the State not so much to defend the so-called vested\r\nrights of corporations as to make such just and beneficial laws as will\r\ntemper inequality, mitigate poverty, protect the weak against the\r\nstrong, preserve life and health, and, in short, promote the welfare and\r\nthe happiness of the masses. Constitutions have been made to accomplish\r\nthese ends, to protect the lives, the liberty and the conscience of\r\nhuman beings, while laws have been sufficient to protect the dollars of\r\ncorporations. It is a short-sighted policy on the part of the latter to\r\ntake unfair advantage of their wealth and influence, for \"As ye sow, so\r\nshall ye reap,\" is the inexorable law of Providence. There is no dynasty\r\nso mighty, no class so privileged, no interest so influential or wealthy\r\nas to obtain immunity from its operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 1.\r\n\r\nCOMPILED FROM THE SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE\r\nCOMMISSION.\r\n\r\n  Mileage in the United States June 30, 1891           168,402.74\r\n  Number of men employed                               784,285\r\n  Number of employes per 100 miles                         486\r\n  Number of locomotives per 100 miles                       19\r\n  Number of passenger cars per 100 miles                    17\r\n  Number of cars per 100 miles                             721\r\n  Capital                                       $9,829,475,015\r\n  Capital per mile                                      60,942\r\n  Gross earnings                                 1,096,761,395\r\n  Gross earnings per mile                                6,801\r\n  Operating expenses                               731,887,893\r\n  Operating expenses per mile                            4,538\r\n  Net income from operation                        364,873,502\r\n  Net income per mile                                    2,263\r\n    Of gross income 67.17 per cent. was earned on freight.\r\n    Of gross income 25.64 per cent. was earned on passengers.\r\n  Received for carrying mails                     $ 24,870,015\r\n  Received rentals from express companies           21,594,349\r\n  Received from investments                        133,911,126\r\n  No. of passengers carried                        531,183,988\r\n  No. of tons freight carried                      675,608,323\r\n  Average journey per passenger                    24.18 miles\r\n  Average haul per ton of freight                    120 miles\r\n  Average number passengers per train                       42\r\n  Average number tons freight per train                    181.67\r\n  Average revenue per passenger per mile                     2.142 cents\r\n  Average revenue per ton per mile of freight                 .895 cents\r\n  Average revenue per train mile, passenger                 $1.06\r\n  Average revenue per train mile, freight                    1.64\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 2.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE RAILWAYS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR THE YEAR ENDING\r\nDEC. 31, 1891.\r\n\r\nFrom the English Reform Almanac for 1893 and from the Report of\r\nCommissioners R.

No subject is more worthy the\r\nprofound study of the statesman, the man of affairs, the scholar and the\r\ncitizen. Surely all who are trying to understand the good and evil of\r\nrailroads can turn to the pages of this book with the certain\r\nexpectation of learning much both in the way of fact and\r\nsuggestion.\"--_Bankers' Magazine._\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the most interesting chapters are the two in which the author\r\nreviews and criticises former publications on railway questions, and the\r\none in which he reviews the various remedies which have been from time\r\nto time advanced for railway abuses. The book is concisely and clearly\r\nwritten.\"--_Engineering News._\r\n\r\n\"Ex.-Gov. Larrabee of Iowa has written a highly meaty book on the\r\nrailroad question. It is a topic he is well qualified to handle, viewing\r\nthat he was no small part of the movement in former days to repress\r\nrailroad abuses in the West, and particularly in his own\r\nState.\"--_Chicago Tribune._\r\n\r\n\"A careful study of an important question, fortified by facts and\r\nfigures which are both interesting and valuable.\"--_New York Recorder._\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas M. Cooley says: \"I have read the book with interest,\r\nespecially that part which discusses State ownership and management. I\r\nhave not before seen the side you advocate so clearly and so ably\r\npresented.\"\r\n\r\n\"The book is the most valuable work yet issued on its subject.\"--_Des\r\nMoines News._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Larrabee is eminently fitted for the task to which he has set\r\nhimself. He is not a mere theorizer. He brings to the discussion the\r\nripe knowledge that comes from long experience in dealing with the\r\nrailroad question, not only as a State Senator and Governor, but also\r\n'as a shipper and as a railroad promoter, owner and stockholder,' and\r\nlikewise as 'a director, president and manager of a railroad company.'\r\nIn his treatment of the railroad problem, moreover, Mr. Larrabee\r\ndisplays a breadth of view and an earnestness of purpose that must\r\ncommand respect even where they fail to carry conviction.\"--_Public\r\nOpinion._\r\n\r\n\"It is devoid of the animus which usually enters into the works of the\r\nreformers, but on the contrary is written in admirable style, enhanced\r\nby happy anecdotes, and altogether is a much more readable book than one\r\nis accustomed to find upon so practical a question.\"--_Kansas City\r\nJournal._\r\n\r\n\"It justifies a claim to a place among the standard books upon the\r\nrailroad problem. It is particularly in those portions of the work which\r\ndeal with the relations of the Government to the railroads and the\r\nsolution of the difficulties that have arisen between the railways and\r\nthe people that the experience of the author both in guiding and\r\nexecuting the railway legislation of Iowa comes into prominent\r\nplay.\"--_Omaha Bee._\r\n\r\n\"We commend the book to the careful reading of the railroad\r\nstockholder.\"--_Railroad Record and Investor's Guide._\r\n\r\n\"A thoughtful volume, showing careful research and\r\nreflection.\"--_Chicago Inter-Ocean._\r\n\r\n\"A most interesting, valuable and timely book. Every student of the\r\nsubject will need to read it, and the popular vein of narrative makes it\r\nvery interesting and instructive to the general reader.\"--_New England\r\nHome._\r\n\r\n\"This work will present Governor Larrabee in a new and novel light\r\nbefore the public. Heretofore he has been known as the successful man of\r\naffairs and business; as the earnest and zealous legislator; as the\r\npersistent and vigorous executive; and now he comes as the laborious\r\nstudent upon a great economic and practical question who has aptly and\r\nclearly put his views into a book.\"--_Dubuque Herald._\r\n\r\n\"A thorough treatise by an able mind. The authorities quoted are the\r\nbest in print.\"--_Coming Nation._\r\n\r\n\"By far the best work on the popular side of the railroad\r\nquestion.\"--_Gen. M. M. Trumbull in the Open Court._\r\n\r\n\"Gov. Larrabee's book will rank among the greatest productions of the\r\nday on that question.\"--_Cedar Rapids Gazette._\r\n\r\n\"The book is the result of extraordinary observation, great reading and\r\ncareful study. * * * This element of completeness, of massing so much\r\ninformation between the covers of a book of ordinary size, makes it\r\ninvaluable for reference. Of all the many books called out by the\r\nagitation of the railroad question, this one will be oftenest referred\r\nto, not so much for its opinions as for its stores of facts.\"--\r\n_Davenport Democrat._\r\n\r\n\"Governor Larrabee has always been a careful and conscientious student\r\nof the railroad question, and in exposing the abuses to which the\r\nrailroad system has committed itself he renders a service from which the\r\npublic may derive great benefit.\"--_Good Roads._\r\n\r\n\"The high character and well known reputation of the author will create\r\na demand for this book, aside from the fact that it contains a vast\r\namount of information as well as sound reasoning on the railroad\r\nquestion.\"--_American Journal of Politics._\r\n\r\n\"The author's attitude, while firm, is by no means a sinister or\r\nfantastic one. He writes obviously from honest conviction, and he writes\r\nwith skill and force.\"--_Philadelphia Press._\r\n\r\n\"A temperate and instructive contribution to railroad\r\nliterature.\"--_Chicago Times._\r\n\r\n\"A mine of facts gathered by a man who has made a specialty of his\r\nsubject and who is evidently in earnest in his desire to lessen the\r\nburdens of the American people.\"--_San Francisco Chronicle._\r\n\r\n\"In point of authenticity the book is absolutely to be relied\r\nupon.\"--_St. Louis Post-Dispatch._\r\n\r\n\"Governor Larrabee came to Iowa before any railroad had reached the\r\nMississippi. Engaging in manufacturing, the inconveniences which he\r\nsuffered from want of transportation facilities instilled liberal\r\nopinions concerning railroads. He made private donations to new roads\r\nand he advocated public aid to them. As a legislator he introduced a\r\nbill authorizing a 5 per cent. tax in aid of railroad construction. He\r\nbelieved that the common law and competition could be relied upon to\r\ncorrect abuses and to solve the rate problem. It has not been until\r\nsince these efforts were made that he has become convinced, as he says\r\nin his preface, that 'where combination is possible competition is\r\nimpossible.' The object of this work is explained to be to set forth the\r\nobjections which lie against the management of railroads as private\r\nproperty. They are used by their managers for speculative purposes. They\r\ncannot perform their proper functions so long as they are used only for\r\nthe interests of their stockholders. In order to serve their real\r\npurpose, 'they must become in fact what they are in theory, highways to\r\nbe controlled by the Government as thoroughly and effectively as the\r\ncommon road, the turnpike and the ferry, the post-office and the\r\ncustom-house.'\"--_Council Bluffs Nonpareil._\r\n\r\n\r\n  =\"THE RAILROAD QUESTION\"=\r\n\r\n  may be ordered through any bookseller,\r\n  or will be sent by mail to any address,\r\n  on receipt of price, by the publishers.\r\n\r\n  The Schulte Publishing Company,\r\n  334 DEARBORN STREET,\r\n  CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Transcriber's Note:                           |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the  |\r\n    | original document have been preserved.        |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Roman numeral page numbers in the Appendix    |\r\n    | have been changed to Arabic numerals.         |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in the text:   |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Page  13  Ackworth changed to Acworth         |\r\n    | Page  25  Jerusalen changed to Jerusalem      |\r\n    | Page  26  Brundusium changed to Brundisium    |\r\n    | Page  27  af changed to of                    |\r\n    | Page  27  if changed to of                    |\r\n    | Page  29  Strasburg changed to Strasbourg     |\r\n    | Page  37  Pittsburg changed to Pittsburgh     |\r\n    | Page  45  subsides changed to subsidies       |\r\n    | Page  65  Williamston changed to Williamstown |\r\n    | Page  70  Cabello changed to Caballo          |\r\n    | Page 107  resolulution changed to resolution  |\r\n    | Page 215  prejudiee changed to prejudice      |\r\n    | Page 232  aquainted changed to acquainted     |\r\n    | Page 236  omiting changed to omitting         |\r\n    | Page 252  Bastile changed to Bastille         |\r\n    | Page 266  possiple changed to possible        |\r\n    | Page 342  Is changed to It                    |\r\n    | Page 346  their changed to there              |\r\n    | Page 350  cammerce changed to commerce        |\r\n    | Page 361  upan changed to upon                |\r\n    | Page 368  iujustice changed to injustice      |\r\n    | Page 373  Eurpean changed to European         |\r\n    | Page 407  despatcher changed to dispatcher    |\r\n    | Page 408  despatcher changed to dispatcher    |\r\n    | Page 417  Sante changed to Santa              |\r\n    | Page 422  aquire changed to acquire           |\r\n    | Page 478  reasonaable changed to reasonable   |\r\n    | Page 482  addres changed to address           |\r\n    | Page 485  Potuguese changed to Portuguese     |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Railroad Question, by William Larrabee",
