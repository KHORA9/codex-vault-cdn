On the paternal side he is of English origin. Moses Cleveland\r\nemigrated from Ipswich, County of Suffolk, England, in 1635, and settled\r\nat Woburn, Mass., where he died in 1701. His descendant William\r\nCleveland was a silversmith and watchmaker at Norwich, Conn. Richard\r\nFalley Cleveland, son of the latter named, was graduated at Yale in\r\n1824, was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry in 1829, and in the same\r\nyear married Ann Neal, daughter of a Baltimore merchant of Irish birth.\r\nThese two were the parents of Grover Cleveland. The Presbyterian\r\nparsonage at Caldwell, where he was born, was first occupied by the\r\nRev. Stephen Grover, in whose honor he was named; but the first name was\r\nearly dropped, and he has been since known as Grover Cleveland. When\r\nhe was 4 years old his father accepted a call to Fayetteville, near\r\nSyracuse, N.Y., where the son had common and academic schooling, and\r\nafterwards was a clerk in a country store. The removal of the family\r\nto Clinton, Oneida County, gave him additional educational advantages\r\nin the academy there. In his seventeenth year he became a clerk and an\r\nassistant teacher in the New York Institution for the Blind, in New York\r\nCity, in which his elder brother, William, a Presbyterian clergyman,\r\nwas then a teacher. In 1855 he left Holland Patent, in Oneida County,\r\nwhere his mother at that time resided, to go to the West in search of\r\nemployment. On his way he stopped at Black Rock, now a part of Buffalo,\r\nand called on his uncle, Lewis F. Allen, who induced him to remain and\r\naid him in the compilation of a volume of the American Herd Book,\r\nreceiving for six weeks' service $60. He afterwards, and while studying\r\nlaw, assisted in the preparation of several other volumes of this work,\r\nand the preface to the fifth volume (1861) acknowledges his services.\r\nIn August, 1855, he secured a place as clerk and copyist for the law\r\nfirm of Rogers, Bowen & Rogers, in Buffalo, began to read Blackstone,\r\nand in the autumn of that year was receiving $4 per week for his work.\r\nHe was admitted to the bar in 1859, but for three years longer remained\r\nwith the firm that first employed him, acting as managing clerk at a\r\nsalary of $600, a part of which he devoted to the support of his widowed\r\nmother, who died in 1882. Was appointed assistant district attorney of\r\nErie County January 1, 1863, and held the office for three years. At\r\nthis time the Civil War was raging. Two of his brothers were in the\r\nArmy, and his mother and sisters were largely dependent upon him for\r\nsupport. Unable himself to enlist, he borrowed money and sent a\r\nsubstitute to the war, and it was not till long after the war that\r\nhe was able to repay the loan. In 1865, at the age of 28, he was the\r\nDemocratic candidate for district attorney, but was defeated by the\r\nRepublican candidate, his intimate friend, Lyman K. Bass. He then became\r\nthe law partner of Isaac V. Vanderpool, and in 1869 became a member of\r\nthe firm of Lanning, Cleveland & Folsom. He continued a successful\r\npractice till 1870, when he was elected sheriff of Erie County. At the\r\nexpiration of his three years' term he formed a law partnership with\r\nhis personal friend and political antagonist, Lyman K. Bass, the firm\r\nbeing Bass, Cleveland & Bissell, and, after the forced retirement,\r\nfrom failing health, of Mr. Bass, Cleveland & Bissell. In 1881 he was\r\nnominated the Democratic candidate for mayor of Buffalo, and was elected\r\nby a majority of 3,530, the largest ever given to a candidate in that\r\ncity. In the same election the Republican State ticket was carried in\r\nBuffalo by an average majority of over 1,600. He entered upon the office\r\nJanuary 1, 1882, and soon became known as the \"Veto Mayor,\" using that\r\nprerogative fearlessly in checking unwise, illegal, and extravagant\r\nexpenditures. By his vetoes he saved the city nearly $1,000,000 in the\r\nfirst half year of his administration. He opposed giving $500 of the\r\ntaxpayers' money to the Firemen's Benevolent Society on the ground\r\nthat such appropriation was not permissible under the terms of the\r\nState constitution and the charter of the city. He vetoed a resolution\r\ndiverting $500 from the Fourth of July appropriations to the observance\r\nof Decoration Day for the same reason, and immediately subscribed\r\none-tenth of the sum wanted for the purpose. His administration of the\r\noffice won tributes to his integrity and ability from the press and the\r\npeople irrespective of party. On the second day of the Democratic State\r\nconvention at Syracuse, September 22, 1882, on the third ballot, was\r\nnominated for governor in opposition to the Republican candidate,\r\nCharles J. Folger, then Secretary of the United States Treasury. He had\r\nthe united support of his own party, while the Republicans were not\r\nunited on his opponent, and at the election in November he received a\r\nplurality over Mr. Folger of 192,854. His State administration was only\r\nan expansion of the fundamental principles that controlled his official\r\naction while mayor of Buffalo. In a letter written to his brother on\r\nthe day of his election he announced a policy he intended to adopt,\r\nand afterwards carried out, \"that is, to make the matter a business\r\nengagement between the people of the State and myself, in which the\r\nobligation on my side is to perform the duties assigned me with an\r\neye single to the interest of my employers.\" The Democratic national\r\nconvention met at Chicago July 8, 1884. On July 11 he was nominated as\r\ntheir candidate for President. The Republicans made James G. Blaine\r\ntheir candidate, while Benjamin F. Butler, of Massachusetts, was the\r\nLabor and Greenback candidate, and John P. St. John, of Kansas, was\r\nthe Prohibition candidate. At the election, November 4, Mr. Cleveland\r\nreceived 219 and Mr. Blaine 182 electoral votes. He was unanimously\r\nrenominated for the Presidency by the national Democratic convention\r\nin St. Louis on June 6, 1888. At the election in November he received\r\n168 electoral votes, while 233 were cast for Benjamin Harrison, the\r\nRepublican candidate. Of the popular vote, however, he received\r\n5,540,329, and Mr. Harrison received 5,439,853. At the close of his\r\nAdministration, March 4, 1889, he retired to New York City, where he\r\nreentered upon the practice of his profession. It soon became evident,\r\nhowever, that he would be prominently urged as a candidate for\r\nrenomination in 1892. At the national Democratic convention which met\r\nin Chicago June 21, 1892, he received more than two-thirds of the votes\r\non the first ballot. At the election in November he received 277 of\r\nthe electoral votes, while Mr. Harrison received 145 and Mr. James B.\r\nWeaver, the candidate of the People's Party, 22. Of the popular vote\r\nMr. Cleveland received 5,553,142, Mr. Harrison 5,186,931, and Mr.\r\nWeaver 1,030,128. He retired from office March 4, 1897, and removed to\r\nPrinceton, N.J., where he has since resided. He is the first of our\r\nPresidents who served a second term without being elected as his own\r\nsuccessor. President Cleveland was married in the White House on June 2,\r\n1886, to Miss Frances Folsom, daughter of his deceased friend and\r\npartner, Oscar Folsom, of the Buffalo bar. Mrs. Cleveland was the\r\nyoungest (except the wife of Mr. Madison) of the many mistresses of the\r\nWhite House, having been born in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1864. She is the\r\nfirst wife of a President married in the White House, and the first to\r\ngive birth to a child there, their second daughter (Esther) having been\r\nborn in the Executive Mansion in 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: In the presence of this vast assemblage of my\r\ncountrymen I am about to supplement and seal by the oath which I shall\r\ntake the manifestation of the will of a great and free people. In the\r\nexercise of their power and right of self-government they have committed\r\nto one of their fellow-citizens a supreme and sacred trust, and he here\r\nconsecrates himself to their service.\r\n\r\nThis impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of\r\nresponsibility with which I contemplate the duty I owe to all the people\r\nof the land. Nothing can relieve me from anxiety lest by any act of mine\r\ntheir interests may suffer, and nothing is needed to strengthen my\r\nresolution to engage every faculty and effort in the promotion of their\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nAmid the din of party strife the people's choice was made, but its\r\nattendant circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety\r\nof a government by the people. In each succeeding year it more clearly\r\nappears that our democratic principle needs no apology, and that in its\r\nfearless and faithful application is to be found the surest guaranty of\r\ngood government.\r\n\r\nBut the best results in the operation of a government wherein every\r\ncitizen has a share largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely\r\npartisan zeal and effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the\r\nheat of the partisan should be merged in the patriotism of the citizen.\r\n\r\nTo-day the executive branch of the Government is transferred to new\r\nkeeping. But this is still the Government of all the people, and it\r\nshould be none the less an object of their affectionate solicitude.\r\nAt this hour the animosities of political strife, the bitterness of\r\npartisan defeat, and the exultation of partisan triumph should be\r\nsupplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular will and a\r\nsober, conscientious concern for the general weal. Moreover, if from\r\nthis hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and\r\ndistrust, and determine, with manly confidence in one another, to work\r\nout harmoniously the achievements of our national destiny, we shall\r\ndeserve to realize all the benefits which our happy form of government\r\ncan bestow.\r\n\r\nOn this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion\r\nto the Constitution, which, launched by the founders of the Republic and\r\nconsecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion, has for almost a\r\ncentury borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through\r\nprosperity and peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the\r\nperils of domestic strife and vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nBy the Father of his Country our Constitution was commended for adoption\r\nas \"the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession.\" In that same\r\nspirit it should be administered, in order to promote the lasting\r\nwelfare of the country and to secure the full measure of its priceless\r\nbenefits to us and to those who will succeed to the blessings of our\r\nnational life. The large variety of diverse and competing interests\r\nsubject to Federal control, persistently seeking the recognition of\r\ntheir claims, need give us no fear that \"the greatest good to the\r\ngreatest number\" will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of\r\nnational legislation that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall\r\nprevail in which the Constitution had its birth. If this involves the\r\nsurrender or postponement of private interests and the abandonment of\r\nlocal advantages, compensation will be found in the assurance that the\r\ncommon interest is subserved and the general welfare advanced.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of my official duty I shall endeavor to be guided\r\nby a just and unstrained construction of the Constitution, a careful\r\nobservance of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal\r\nGovernment and those reserved to the States or to the people, and by a\r\ncautious appreciation of those functions which by the Constitution and\r\nlaws have been especially assigned to the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut he who takes the oath to-day to preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States only assumes the solemn obligation\r\nwhich every patriotic citizen--on the farm, in the workshop, in the busy\r\nmarts of trade, and everywhere--should share with him. The Constitution\r\nwhich prescribes his oath, my countrymen, is yours; the Government you\r\nhave chosen him to administer for a time is yours; the suffrage which\r\nexecutes the will of freemen is yours; the laws and the entire scheme\r\nof our civil rule, from the town meeting to the State capitals and the\r\nnational capital, is yours. Your every voter, as surely as your Chief\r\nMagistrate, under the same high sanction, though in a different sphere,\r\nexercises a public trust. Nor is this all. Every citizen owes to the\r\ncountry a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and\r\na fair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness. Thus\r\nis the people's will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil\r\npolity--municipal, State, and Federal; and this is the price of our\r\nliberty and the inspiration of our faith in the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of those serving the people in public place to closely\r\nlimit public expenditures to the actual needs of the Government\r\neconomically administered, because this bounds the right of the\r\nGovernment to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property\r\nof the citizen, and because public extravagance begets extravagance\r\namong the people. We should never be ashamed of the simplicity and\r\nprudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a\r\nrepublican form of government and most compatible with the mission of\r\nthe American people. Those who are selected for a limited time to manage\r\npublic affairs are still of the people, and may do much by their example\r\nto encourage, consistently with the dignity of their official functions,\r\nthat plain way of life which among their fellow-citizens aids integrity\r\nand promotes thrift and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe genius of our institutions, the needs of our people in their\r\nhome life, and the attention which is demanded for the settlement\r\nand development of the resources of our vast territory dictate the\r\nscrupulous avoidance of any departure from that foreign policy commended\r\nby the history, the traditions, and the prosperity of our Republic. It\r\nis the policy of independence, favored by our position and defended by\r\nour known love of justice and by our power. It is the policy of peace\r\nsuitable to our interests. It is the policy of neutrality, rejecting\r\nany share in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and\r\nrepelling their intrusion here. It is the policy of Monroe and of\r\nWashington and Jefferson--\"Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with\r\nall nations; entangling alliance with none.\"\r\n\r\nA due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands\r\nthat our finances shall be established upon such a sound and sensible\r\nbasis as shall secure the safety and confidence of business interests\r\nand make the wage of labor sure and steady, and that our system of\r\nrevenue shall be so adjusted as to relieve the people of unnecessary\r\ntaxation, having a due regard to the interests of capital invested\r\nand workingmen employed in American industries, and preventing the\r\naccumulation of a surplus in the Treasury to tempt extravagance and\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nCare for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers\r\nrequires that the public domain should be protected from purloining\r\nschemes and unlawful occupation.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of the people demands that the Indians within our\r\nboundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the\r\nGovernment and their education and civilization promoted with a view\r\nto their ultimate citizenship, and that polygamy in the Territories,\r\ndestructive of the family relation and offensive to the moral sense of\r\nthe civilized world, shall be repressed.\r\n\r\nThe laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of\r\na servile class to compete with American labor, with no intention of\r\nacquiring citizenship, and bringing with them and retaining habits and\r\ncustoms repugnant to our civilization.\r\n\r\nThe people demand reform in the administration of the Government and the\r\napplication of business principles to public affairs. As a means to this\r\nend, civil-service reform should be in good faith enforced. Our citizens\r\nhave the right to protection from the incompetency of public employees\r\nwho hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service, and from\r\nthe corrupting influence of those who promise and the vicious methods\r\nof those who expect such rewards; and those who worthily seek public\r\nemployment have the right to insist that merit and competency shall be\r\nrecognized instead of party subserviency or the surrender of honest\r\npolitical belief.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact\r\njustice to all men there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the\r\nprotection of the freedmen in their rights or their security in the\r\nenjoyment of their privileges under the Constitution and its amendments.\r\nAll discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as\r\nAmerican citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the\r\nnecessity for their improvement. The fact that they are citizens\r\nentitles them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them\r\nwith all its duties, obligations, and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThese topics and the constant and ever-varying wants of an active\r\nand enterprising population may well receive the attention and the\r\npatriotic endeavor of all who make and execute the Federal law.\r\nOur duties are practical and call for industrious application, an\r\nintelligent perception of the claims of public office, and, above all,\r\na firm determination, by united action, to secure to all the people\r\nof the land the full benefits of the best form of government ever\r\nvouchsafed to man. And let us not trust to human effort alone, but humbly\r\nacknowledging the power and goodness of Almighty God, who presides over\r\nthe destiny of nations, and who has at all times been revealed in our\r\ncountry's history, let us invoke His aid and His blessing upon our\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 13, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of their reexamination I withdraw certain treaties and\r\nconventions now pending in the Senate which were communicated to that\r\nbody by my predecessor in office, and I therefore request the return\r\nto me of the commercial convention between the United States and the\r\nDominican Republic which was transmitted to the Senate December 9, 1884;\r\nof the commercial treaty between the United States and Spain which\r\nwas transmitted to the Senate December 10, 1884, together with the\r\nsupplementary articles thereto of March 2, 1885; and of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Nicaragua for the construction of an\r\ninteroceanic canal which was transmitted to the Senate December 10,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 2, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of its reconsideration I withdraw the additional\r\narticle, now pending in the Senate, signed on the 23d of June last, to\r\nthe treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation which was concluded\r\nbetween the United States and the Argentine Confederation July 27, 1853,\r\nand communicated to the Senate by my predecessor in office 27th of\r\nJanuary, 1885.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas it is alleged that certain individuals, associations of persons,\r\nand corporations are in the unauthorized possession of portions of the\r\nterritory known as the Oklahoma lands, within the Indian Territory,\r\nwhich are designated, described, and recognized by the treaties and laws\r\nof the United States and by the executive authority thereof as Indian\r\nlands; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is further alleged that certain other persons or associations\r\nwithin the territory and jurisdiction of the United States have begun\r\nand set on foot preparations for an organized and forcible entry and\r\nsettlement upon the aforesaid lands and are now threatening such entry\r\nand occupation; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States provide for the removal of all\r\npersons residing or being found upon such Indian lands and territory\r\nwithout permission expressly and legally obtained of the Interior\r\nDepartment:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, for the purpose of protecting the public interests, as\r\nwell as the interests of the Indian nations and tribes, and to the end\r\nthat no person or persons may be induced to enter upon said territory,\r\nwhere they will not be allowed to remain without the permission of the\r\nauthority aforesaid, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United\r\nStates, do hereby warn and admonish all and every person or persons now\r\nin the occupation of such lands, and all such person or persons as are\r\nintending, preparing, or threatening to enter and settle upon the same,\r\nthat they will neither be permitted to enter upon said territory nor, if\r\nalready there, to remain thereon, and that in case a due regard for and\r\nvoluntary obedience to the laws and treaties of the United States and\r\nif this admonition and warning be not sufficient to effect the purposes\r\nand intentions of the Government as herein declared, the military power\r\nof the United States will be invoked to abate all such unauthorized\r\npossession, to prevent such threatened entry and occupation, and to\r\nremove all such intruders from the said Indian lands.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 13th day of March, 1885, and of the\r\nIndependence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninth.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  T.F.

All officials connected with any office where or for which any\r\n  examination is to take place will give the Civil Service Commission and\r\n  the chief examiner such information as may be reasonably required to\r\n  enable the Commission to select competent and trustworthy examiners;\r\n  and the examinations by those selected as examiners, and the work\r\n  incident thereto, will be regarded as a part of the public business to\r\n  be performed at such office, and with due regard to other parts of the\r\n  public business said examiners shall be allowed time during office\r\n  hours to perform the duties required of them.\r\n\r\n  2. It shall be the duty of every executive officer promptly to inform\r\n  the Commission, in writing, of the removal or discharge from the public\r\n  service of any examiner in his office, or of the inability or refusal of\r\n  any such examiner to act in that capacity; and, on the request of the\r\n  Commission, such officer shall thereupon name not less than two persons\r\n  serving under him whom he regards as most competent for a place on an\r\n  examining board, stating generally their qualifications; and from all\r\n  those who may be named for any such place the Commission shall select\r\n  a person to fill the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XI.\r\n\r\n  1. Every application, in order to entitle the applicant to appear for\r\n  examination or to be examined, must state under oath the facts on the\r\n  following subjects: (1) Full name, residence, and post-office address;\r\n  (2) citizenship; (3) age; (4) place of birth; (5) health and physical\r\n  capacity for the public service; (6) right of preference by reason of\r\n  military or naval service; (7) previous employment in the public\r\n  service; (8) business or employment and residence for the previous five\r\n  years; (9) education. Such other information shall be furnished as the\r\n  Commission may reasonably require touching the applicant's fitness for\r\n  the public service. The applicant must also state the number of members\r\n  of his family in the public service and where employed, and must also\r\n  assert that he is not disqualified under section. 8 of the civil-service\r\n  act, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"That no person habitually using intoxicating beverages to excess shall\r\n  be appointed to or retained in any office, appointment, or employment to\r\n  which the provisions of this act are applicable.\"\r\n\r\n  No person dismissed from the public service for misconduct shall be\r\n  admitted to examination within two years thereafter, and no person not\r\n  absolutely appointed or employed after probation shall be admitted to\r\n  an examination within one year thereafter.\r\n\r\n  2. No person under enlistment in the Army or Navy of the United States\r\n  shall be examined under these rules, except for some place requiring\r\n  special qualifications, and with the consent in writing of the head of\r\n  the Department under which he is enlisted.\r\n\r\n  3. The Commission may, by regulations subject to change at any time by\r\n  the President, declare the kind and measure of ill health, physical\r\n  incapacity, misrepresentation, and bad faith which may properly exclude\r\n  any person from the right of examination, grading, or certification\r\n  under these rules. It may also provide for medical certificates of\r\n  physical capacity in the proper cases, and for the appropriate\r\n  certification of persons so defective in sight, speech, hearing, or\r\n  otherwise as to be apparently disqualified for some of the duties of\r\n  the part of the service which they seek to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XII.\r\n\r\n  1. Every regular application must be supported by proper certificates of\r\n  good moral character, health, and physical and mental capacity for doing\r\n  the public work, the certificates to be in such form and number as the\r\n  regulations of the Commission shall provide; but no certificate will be\r\n  received which is inconsistent with the tenth section of the\r\n  civil-service act.\r\n\r\n  2. No one shall be examined for admission to the classified postal\r\n  service if under 16 or over 35 years of age, excepting messengers,\r\n  stampers, and other junior assistants, who must not be under 14 years\r\n  of age, or to the classified customs service or to the classified\r\n  departmental service if under 18 or over 45 years of age; but no one\r\n  shall be examined for appointment to any place in the classified customs\r\n  service, except that of clerk or messenger, who is under 21 years of\r\n  age; but these limitations of age shall not apply to persons honorably\r\n  discharged from the military or naval service of the country who are\r\n  otherwise duly qualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XVI.\r\n\r\n  1. Whenever any officer having the power of appointment or employment\r\n  shall so request, there shall be certified to him by the Commission or\r\n  the proper examining board four names for the vacancy specified, to be\r\n  taken from those graded highest on the proper register of those in his\r\n  branch of the service and remaining eligible, regard being had for any\r\n  right of preference and to the apportionments to States and Territories;\r\n  and from the said four a selection shall be made for the vacancy. But\r\n  if a person is on both a general and a special register he need not be\r\n  certified for the former, except at the discretion of the Commission,\r\n  until he has remained two months upon the latter.\r\n\r\n  2. These certifications for the service at Washington shall be made\r\n  in such order as to apportion, as nearly as may be practicable, the\r\n  original appointments thereto among the States and Territories and the\r\n  District of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained at the\r\n  last preceding census.\r\n\r\n  3. In case the request for any such certification or any law or\r\n  regulation shall call for those of either sex, persons of that sex shall\r\n  be certified; otherwise sex shall be disregarded in such certification.\r\n\r\n  4. Subject to the other provisions of this rule, persons eligible on\r\n  any register shall be entitled to three certifications only to the\r\n  same officer, but with his request in writing there may be a fourth\r\n  certification of such persons to him when reached in order. No one shall\r\n  remain eligible for more than one year upon any register, except as may\r\n  be provided by regulation; but these restrictions shall not extend to\r\n  examinations under clause 5 of Rule VII. No person while remaining\r\n  eligible on any register shall be admitted to a new examination, and no\r\n  person having failed upon any examination shall within six months be\r\n  admitted to another examination without the consent of the Commission.\r\n\r\n  5. Any person appointed to or employed in any place in the classified\r\n  service who shall be dismissed or separated therefrom without fault or\r\n  delinquency on his part may be reappointed or reemployed in the same\r\n  Department or office, at a grade for which no higher examination is\r\n  required than that for the position he last held, within one year next\r\n  following such dismissal or separation, without further examination, on\r\n  such certification as the Commission may provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XVII.\r\n\r\n  1. Every original appointment or employment in said classified service\r\n  shall be for the probationary period of six months, at the end of which\r\n  time, if the conduct and capacity of the person appointed have been\r\n  found satisfactory to the officer having the duty of selection, the\r\n  probationer shall be absolutely appointed or employed, but otherwise be\r\n  deemed out of the service.\r\n\r\n  2. Every officer under whom any probationer shall serve during any part\r\n  of the probation provided for by these rules shall carefully observe the\r\n  quality and value of the service rendered by such probationer, and shall\r\n  report to the proper appointing officer in writing the facts observed by\r\n  him, showing the character and qualifications of such probationer and of\r\n  the service performed by him; and such reports shall be preserved on\r\n  file.\r\n\r\n  3. Every false statement knowingly made by any person in his application\r\n  for examination, and every connivance by him at any false statement\r\n  made in any certificate which may accompany his application, and every\r\n  deception or fraud practiced by him or by any person in his behalf and\r\n  with his knowledge to influence his examination, certification, or\r\n  appointment, shall be regarded as good cause for refusing to certify\r\n  such person or for the removal or discharge of such person during his\r\n  probation or thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XIX.\r\n\r\n  There are excepted from examination the following: (1) The confidential\r\n  clerk or secretary of any head of a Department or office; (2) cashiers\r\n  of collectors; (3) cashiers of postmasters; (4) superintendents of\r\n  money-order divisions in post-offices; (5) the direct custodians of\r\n  money for whose fidelity another officer is under official bond, and\r\n  disbursing officers having the custody of money who give bond; but these\r\n  exceptions shall not extend to any official below the grade of assistant\r\n  cashier or teller; (6) persons employed exclusively in the secret\r\n  service of the Government, or as translators, or interpreters, or\r\n  stenographers; (7) persons whose employment is exclusively professional,\r\n  but medical examiners are not included among such persons; (8) chief\r\n  clerks, deputy collectors, deputy naval officers, deputy surveyors of\r\n  customs, and superintendents or chiefs of divisions or bureaus. But no\r\n  person so excepted shall be either transferred, appointed, or promoted,\r\n  unless to some excepted place, without an examination under the\r\n  Commission, which examination shall not take place within six months\r\n  after entering the service. Promotions may be made without examination\r\n  in offices where examinations are not now held until rules on the\r\n  subject shall be promulgated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XXI.\r\n\r\n  1. No person, unless excepted under Rule XIX, shall be admitted into the\r\n  classified civil service from any place not within said service without\r\n  an examination and certification under the rules; with this exception,\r\n  that any person who shall have been an officer for one year or more last\r\n  preceding in any Department or office, in a grade above the classified\r\n  service thereof, may be transferred or appointed to any place in the\r\n  service of the same without examination.\r\n\r\n  2. No person who has passed only a limited examination under clause 4\r\n  of Rule VII for the lower classes or grades in the departmental or\r\n  customs service shall be appointed, or be promoted within two years\r\n  after appointment, to any position giving a salary of $1,000 or upward,\r\n  without first passing an examination under clause 1 of said rule; and\r\n  such examination shall not be allowed within the first year after\r\n  appointment.\r\n\r\n  3. But a person who has passed the examination under said clause 1, and\r\n  has accepted a position giving a salary of $900 or less, shall have the\r\n  same right of promotion as if originally appointed to a position giving\r\n  a salary of $1,000 or more.\r\n\r\n  4. The Commission may at any time certify for a $900 or any lower place\r\n  in the classified service any person upon the register who has passed\r\n  the examination under clause 1 of Rule VII if such person does not\r\n  object before such certification is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE XXII.\r\n\r\n  Any person who has been in the classified departmental service for six\r\n  months or more immediately previous may, when the needs of the service\r\n  require it, be transferred or appointed to any other place therein upon\r\n  producing a certificate from the Civil Service Commission that such\r\n  person has passed at the required grade one or more examinations which\r\n  are together equal to that necessary for original entrance to the place\r\n  which would be secured by the transfer or appointment; and any person\r\n  who has for three years last preceding served as a clerk in the office\r\n  of the President of the United States may be transferred or appointed\r\n  to any place in the classified service without examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproved, November 27, 1885.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, November 28, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_It is hereby ordered_, That the Department of Agriculture, the\r\nGovernment Printing Office, and all other Government offices in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia be closed on Tuesday, December 1, 1885, the day of\r\nthe funeral of the late Thomas A. Hendricks, Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nYour assembling is clouded by a sense of public bereavement, caused by\r\nthe recent and sudden death of Thomas A. Hendricks, Vice-President of\r\nthe United States. His distinguished public services, his complete\r\nintegrity and devotion to every duty, and his personal virtues will find\r\nhonorable record in his country's history.\r\n\r\nAmple and repeated proofs of the esteem and confidence in which he was\r\nheld by his fellow-countrymen were manifested by his election to offices\r\nof the most important trust and highest dignity; and at length, full of\r\nyears and honors, he has been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and\r\nbenediction.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, which requires those chosen to legislate for the\r\npeople to annually meet in the discharge of their solemn trust, also\r\nrequires the President to give to Congress information of the state of\r\nthe Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall\r\ndeem necessary and expedient. At the threshold of a compliance with\r\nthese constitutional directions it is well for us to bear in mind that\r\nour usefulness to the people's interests will be promoted by a constant\r\nappreciation of the scope and character of our respective duties as they\r\nrelate to Federal legislation. While the Executive may recommend such\r\nmeasures as he shall deem expedient, the responsibility for legislative\r\naction must and should rest upon those selected by the people to make\r\ntheir laws.\r\n\r\nContemplation of the grave and responsible functions assigned to the\r\nrespective branches of the Government under the Constitution will\r\ndisclose the partitions of power between our respective departments and\r\ntheir necessary independence, and also the need for the exercise of all\r\nthe power intrusted to each in that spirit of comity and cooperation\r\nwhich is essential to the proper fulfillment of the patriotic\r\nobligations which rest upon us as faithful servants of the people.\r\n\r\nThe jealous watchfulness of our constituencies, great and small,\r\nsupplements their suffrages, and before the tribunal they establish\r\nevery public servant should be judged.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to announce that the relations of the United States\r\nwith all foreign powers continue to be friendly. Our position after\r\nnearly a century of successful constitutional government, maintenance of\r\ngood faith in all our engagements, the avoidance of complications with\r\nother nations, and our consistent and amicable attitude toward the\r\nstrong and weak alike furnish proof of a political disposition which\r\nrenders professions of good will unnecessary. There are no questions of\r\ndifficulty pending with any foreign government.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Government has revived the long dormant question of the\r\nFalkland Islands by claiming from the United States indemnity for their\r\nloss, attributed to the action of the commander of the sloop of war\r\n_Lexington_ in breaking up a piratical colony on those islands in\r\n1831, and their subsequent occupation by Great Britain. In view of the\r\nample justification for the act of the _Lexington_ and the derelict\r\ncondition of the islands before and after their alleged occupation by\r\nArgentine colonists, this Government considers the claim as wholly\r\ngroundless.\r\n\r\nQuestion has arisen with the Government of Austria-Hungary touching\r\nthe representation of the United States at Vienna. Having under my\r\nconstitutional prerogative appointed an estimable citizen of unimpeached\r\nprobity and competence as minister at that court, the Government of\r\nAustria-Hungary invited this Government to take cognizance of certain\r\nexceptions, based upon allegations against the personal acceptability\r\nof Mr. Keiley, the appointed envoy, asking that in view thereof the\r\nappointment should be withdrawn. The reasons advanced were such as\r\ncould not be acquiesced in without violation of my oath of office\r\nand the precepts of the Constitution, since they necessarily involved a\r\nlimitation in favor of a foreign government upon the right of selection\r\nby the Executive and required such an application of a religious test\r\nas a qualification for office under the United States as would have\r\nresulted in the practical disfranchisement of a large class of our\r\ncitizens and the abandonment of a vital principle in our Government. The\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government finally decided not to receive Mr. Keiley as\r\nthe envoy of the United States, and that gentleman has since resigned\r\nhis commission, leaving the post vacant. I have made no new nomination,\r\nand the interests of this Government at Vienna are now in the care of\r\nthe secretary of legation, acting as chargé d'affaires _ad interim_.\r\n\r\nEarly in March last war broke out in Central America, caused by the\r\nattempt of Guatemala to consolidate the several States into a single\r\ngovernment. In these contests between our neighboring States the United\r\nStates forebore to interfere actively, but lent the aid of their\r\nfriendly offices in deprecation of war and to promote peace and concord\r\namong the belligerents, and by such counsel contributed importantly to\r\nthe restoration of tranquillity in that locality.\r\n\r\nEmergencies growing out of civil war in the United States of Colombia\r\ndemanded of the Government at the beginning of this Administration\r\nthe employment of armed forces to fulfill its guaranties under the\r\nthirty-fifth article of the treaty of 1846, in order to keep the transit\r\nopen across the Isthmus of Panama. Desirous of exercising only the\r\npowers expressly reserved to us by the treaty, and mindful of the rights\r\nof Colombia, the forces sent to the Isthmus were instructed to confine\r\ntheir action to \"positively and efficaciously\" preventing the transit\r\nand its accessories from being \"interrupted or embarrassed.\"\r\n\r\nThe execution of this delicate and responsible task necessarily involved\r\npolice control where the local authority was temporarily powerless, but\r\nalways in aid of the sovereignty of Colombia.\r\n\r\nThe prompt and successful fulfillment of its duty by this Government was\r\nhighly appreciated by the Government of Colombia, and has been followed\r\nby expressions of its satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHigh praise is due to the officers and men engaged in this service.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of peace on the Isthmus by the reestablishment of the\r\nconstituted Government there being thus accomplished, the forces of the\r\nUnited States were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nPending these occurrences a question of much importance was presented by\r\ndecrees of the Colombian Government proclaiming the closure of certain\r\nports then in the hands of insurgents and declaring vessels held by\r\nthe revolutionists to be piratical and liable to capture by any power.\r\nTo neither of these propositions could the United States assent. An\r\neffective closure of ports not in the possession of the Government, but\r\nheld by hostile partisans, could not be recognized; neither could the\r\nvessels of insurgents against the legitimate sovereignty be deemed\r\n_hostes humani generis_ within the precepts of international law,\r\nwhatever might be the definition and penalty of their acts under the\r\nmunicipal law of the State against whose authority they were in revolt.\r\nThe denial by this Government of the Colombian propositions did not,\r\nhowever, imply the admission of a belligerent status on the part of the\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\nThe Colombian Government has expressed its willingness to negotiate\r\nconventions for the adjustment by arbitration of claims by foreign\r\ncitizens arising out of the destruction of the city of Aspinwall by the\r\ninsurrectionary forces.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the United States in a practicable transit for ships\r\nacross the strip of land separating the Atlantic from the Pacific has\r\nbeen repeatedly manifested during the last half century.\r\n\r\nMy immediate predecessor caused to be negotiated with Nicaragua a treaty\r\nfor the construction, by and at the sole cost of the United States,\r\nof a canal through Nicaraguan territory, and laid it before the Senate.\r\nPending the action of that body thereon, I withdrew the treaty for\r\nreexamination. Attentive consideration of its provisions leads me to\r\nwithhold it from resubmission to the Senate.\r\n\r\nMaintaining, as I do, the tenets of a line of precedents from\r\nWashington's day, which proscribe entangling alliances with foreign\r\nstates, I do not favor a policy of acquisition of new and distant\r\nterritory or the incorporation of remote interests with our own.\r\n\r\nThe laws of progress are vital and organic, and we must be conscious of\r\nthat irresistible tide of commercial expansion which, as the concomitant\r\nof our active civilization, day by day is being urged onward by those\r\nincreasing facilities of production, transportation, and communication\r\nto which steam and electricity have given birth; but our duty in the\r\npresent instructs us to address ourselves mainly to the development of\r\nthe vast resources of the great area committed to our charge and to\r\nthe cultivation of the arts of peace within our own borders, though\r\njealously alert in preventing the American hemisphere from being\r\ninvolved in the political problems and complications of distant\r\ngovernments. Therefore I am unable to recommend propositions involving\r\nparamount privileges of ownership or right outside of our own territory,\r\nwhen coupled with absolute and unlimited engagements to defend the\r\nterritorial integrity of the state where such interests lie. While the\r\ngeneral project of connecting the two oceans by means of a canal is to\r\nbe encouraged, I am of opinion that any scheme to that end to be\r\nconsidered with favor should be free from the features alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe Tehuantepec route is declared by engineers of the highest repute and\r\nby competent scientists to afford an entirely practicable transit for\r\nvessels and cargoes, by means of a ship railway, from the Atlantic to\r\nthe Pacific. The obvious advantages of such a route, if feasible, over\r\nothers more remote from the axial lines of traffic between Europe and\r\nthe Pacific, and particularly between the Valley of the Mississippi and\r\nthe western coast of North and South America, are deserving of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nWhatever highway may be constructed across the barrier dividing the two\r\ngreatest maritime areas of the world must be for the world's benefit--a\r\ntrust for mankind, to be removed from the chance of domination by any\r\nsingle power, nor become a point of invitation for hostilities or a\r\nprize for warlike ambition. An engagement combining the construction,\r\nownership, and operation of such a work by this Government, with an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance for its protection, with the foreign\r\nstate whose responsibilities and rights we would share is, in my\r\njudgment, inconsistent with such dedication to universal and neutral\r\nuse, and would, moreover, entail measures for its realization beyond the\r\nscope of our national polity or present means.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of years has abundantly confirmed the wisdom and foresight\r\nof those earlier Administrations which, long before the conditions of\r\nmaritime intercourse were changed and enlarged by the progress of the\r\nage, proclaimed the vital need of interoceanic transit across the\r\nAmerican Isthmus and consecrated it in advance to the common use of\r\nmankind by their positive declarations and through the formal obligation\r\nof treaties. Toward such realization the efforts of my Administration\r\nwill be applied, ever bearing in mind the principles on which it must\r\nrest, and which were declared in no uncertain tones by Mr. Cass, who,\r\nwhile Secretary of State, in 1858, announced that \"what the United\r\nStates want in Central America, next to the happiness of its people,\r\nis the security and neutrality of the interoceanic routes which lead\r\nthrough it.\"\r\n\r\nThe construction of three transcontinental lines of railway, all in\r\nsuccessful operation, wholly within our territory, and uniting the\r\nAtlantic and the Pacific oceans, has been accompanied by results of a\r\nmost interesting and impressive nature, and has created new conditions,\r\nnot in the routes of commerce only, but in political geography, which\r\npowerfully affect our relations toward and necessarily increase our\r\ninterests in any transisthmian route which may be opened and employed\r\nfor the ends of peace and traffic, or, in other contingencies, for uses\r\ninimical to both.\r\n\r\nTransportation is a factor in the cost of commodities scarcely second to\r\nthat of their production, and weighs as heavily upon the consumer.\r\n\r\nOur experience already has proven the great importance of having the\r\ncompetition between land carriage and water carriage fully developed,\r\neach acting as a protection to the public against the tendencies to\r\nmonopoly which are inherent in the consolidation of wealth and power in\r\nthe hands of vast corporations.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions may serve to emphasize what I have already said on the\r\nscore of the necessity of a neutralization of any interoceanic transit;\r\nand this can only be accomplished by making the uses of the route open\r\nto all nations and subject to the ambitions and warlike necessities of\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe drawings and report of a recent survey of the Nicaragua Canal route,\r\nmade by Chief Engineer Menocal, will be communicated for your\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe claims of citizens of the United States for losses by reason of the\r\nlate military operations of Chile in Peru and Bolivia are the subject of\r\nnegotiation for a claims convention with Chile, providing for their\r\nsubmission to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained.\r\n\r\nIn the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of\r\n1880, restrictive of the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United\r\nStates, individual cases of hardship have occurred beyond the power of\r\nthe Executive to remedy, and calling for judicial determination.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Chinese question in the Western States and\r\nTerritories is, despite this restrictive legislation, far from being\r\nsatisfactory. The recent outbreak in Wyoming Territory, where numbers of\r\nunoffending Chinamen, indisputably within the protection of the treaties\r\nand the law, were murdered by a mob, and the still more recent\r\nthreatened outbreak of the same character in Washington Territory, are\r\nfresh in the minds of all, and there is apprehension lest the bitterness\r\nof feeling against the Mongolian race on the Pacific Slope may find vent\r\nin similar lawless demonstrations. All the power of this Government\r\nshould be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the\r\ntreatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law in\r\nbringing the wrongdoers to justice should be insisted upon.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made by this Government to prevent these violent\r\noutbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation\r\nof these outrages; and it is but just to say that they are traceable to\r\nthe lawlessness of men not citizens of the United States engaged in\r\ncompetition with Chinese laborers.\r\n\r\nRace prejudice is the chief factor in originating these disturbances,\r\nand it exists in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our domestic\r\npeace and the good relationship we strive to maintain with China.\r\n\r\nThe admitted right of a government to prevent the influx of elements\r\nhostile to its internal peace and security may not be questioned, even\r\nwhere there is no treaty stipulation on the subject. That the exclusion\r\nof Chinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions\r\nprevail is strongly evidenced in the Dominion of Canada, where Chinese\r\nimmigration is now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If\r\nexisting laws are inadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be\r\nprepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measures,\r\nwithin the treaty limits, which the wisdom of Congress may devise.\r\n\r\nThe independent State of the Kongo has been organized as a government\r\nunder the sovereignty of His Majesty the King of the Belgians, who\r\nassumes its chief magistracy in his personal character only, without\r\nmaking the new State a dependency of Belgium. It is fortunate that a\r\nbenighted region, owing all it has of quickening civilization to the\r\nbeneficence and philanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have the\r\nadvantage and security of his benevolent supervision.\r\n\r\nThe action taken by this Government last year in being the first to\r\nrecognize the flag of the International Association of the Kongo has\r\nbeen followed by formal recognition of the new nationality which\r\nsucceeds to its sovereign powers.\r\n\r\nA conference of delegates of the principal commercial nations was held\r\nat Berlin last winter to discuss methods whereby the Kongo basin might\r\nbe kept open to the world's trade. Delegates attended on behalf of the\r\nUnited States on the understanding that their part should be merely\r\ndeliberative, without imparting to the results any binding character\r\nso far as the United States were concerned. This reserve was due to\r\nthe indisposition of this Government to share in any disposal by an\r\ninternational congress of jurisdictional questions in remote foreign\r\nterritories. The results of the conference were embodied in a formal act\r\nof the nature of an international convention, which laid down certain\r\nobligations purporting to be binding on the signatories, subject to\r\nratification within one year. Notwithstanding the reservation under\r\nwhich the delegates of the United States attended, their signatures\r\nwere attached to the general act in the same manner as those of the\r\nplenipotentiaries of other governments, thus making the United States\r\nappear, without reserve or qualification, as signatories to a joint\r\ninternational engagement imposing on the signers the conservation of the\r\nterritorial integrity of distant regions where we have no established\r\ninterests or control.\r\n\r\nThis Government does not, however, regard its reservation of liberty\r\nof action in the premises as at all impaired; and holding that an\r\nengagement to share in the obligation of enforcing neutrality in the\r\nremote valley of the Kongo would be an alliance whose responsibilities\r\nwe are not in a position to assume, I abstain from asking the sanction\r\nof the Senate to that general act.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence will be laid before you, and the instructive and\r\ninteresting report of the agent sent by this Government to the Kongo\r\ncountry and his recommendations for the establishment of commercial\r\nagencies on the African coast are also submitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by my predecessor last winter to visit the\r\nCentral and South American countries and report on the methods of\r\nenlarging the commercial relations of the United States therewith has\r\nsubmitted reports, which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nNo opportunity has been omitted to testify the friendliness of this\r\nGovernment toward Korea, whose entrance into the family of treaty powers\r\nthe United States were the first to recognize. I regard with favor the\r\napplication made by the Korean Government to be allowed to employ\r\nAmerican officers as military instructors, to which the assent of\r\nCongress becomes necessary, and I am happy to say this request has the\r\nconcurrent sanction of China and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe arrest and imprisonment of Julio R. Santos, a citizen of the United\r\nStates, by the authorities of Ecuador gave rise to a contention with\r\nthat Government, in which his right to be released or to have a speedy\r\nand impartial trial on announced charges and with all guaranties of\r\ndefense stipulated by treaty was insisted upon by us. After an elaborate\r\ncorrespondence and repeated and earnest representations on our part Mr.\r\nSantos was, after an alleged trial and conviction, eventually included\r\nin a general decree of amnesty and pardoned by the Ecuadorian Executive\r\nand released, leaving the question of his American citizenship denied by\r\nthe Ecuadorian Government, but insisted upon by our own.\r\n\r\nThe amount adjudged by the late French and American Claims Commission to\r\nbe due from the United States to French claimants on account of injuries\r\nsuffered by them during the War of Secession, having been appropriated\r\nby the last Congress, has been duly paid to the French Government.\r\n\r\nThe act of February 25, 1885, provided for a preliminary search of the\r\nrecords of French prize courts for evidence bearing on the claims of\r\nAmerican citizens against France for spoliations committed prior to\r\n1801. The duty has been performed, and the report of the agent will be\r\nlaid before you.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the restrictions upon the importation of our pork\r\ninto France continue, notwithstanding the abundant demonstration of the\r\nabsence of sanitary danger in its use; but I entertain strong hopes that\r\nwith a better understanding of the matter this vexatious prohibition\r\nwill be removed. It would be pleasing to be able to say as much with\r\nrespect to Germany, Austria, and other countries, where such food\r\nproducts are absolutely excluded, without present prospect of reasonable\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of our existing treaties of naturalization by Germany\r\nduring the past year has attracted attention by reason of an apparent\r\ntendency on the part of the Imperial Government to extend the scope of\r\nthe residential restrictions to which returning naturalized citizens of\r\nGerman origin are asserted to be liable under the laws of the Empire.\r\nThe temperate and just attitude taken by this Government with regard to\r\nthis class of questions will doubtless lead to a satisfactory\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe dispute of Germany and Spain relative to the domination of the\r\nCaroline Islands has attracted the attention of this Government by\r\nreason of extensive interests of American citizens having grown up in\r\nthose parts during the past thirty years, and because the question of\r\nownership involves jurisdiction of matters affecting the status of our\r\ncitizens under civil and criminal law. While standing wholly aloof from\r\nthe proprietary issues raised between powers to both of which the United\r\nStates are friendly, this Government expects that nothing in the present\r\ncontention shall unfavorably affect our citizens carrying on a peaceful\r\ncommerce or there domiciled, and has so informed the Governments of\r\nSpain and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe marked good will between the United States and Great Britain has\r\nbeen maintained during the past year.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the fishing clauses of the treaty of Washington, in\r\npursuance of the joint resolution of March 3, 1883, must have resulted\r\nin the abrupt cessation on the 1st of July of this year, in the midst\r\nof their ventures, of the operations of citizens of the United States\r\nengaged in fishing in British American waters but for a diplomatic\r\nunderstanding reached with Her Majesty's Government in June last,\r\nwhereby assurance was obtained that no interruption of those operations\r\nshould take place during the current fishing season.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of good neighborhood and of the commercial intercourse\r\nof adjacent communities, the question of the North American fisheries is\r\none of much importance. Following out the intimation given by me when\r\nthe extensory arrangement above described was negotiated, I recommend\r\nthat the Congress provide for the appointment of a commission in which\r\nthe Governments of the United States and Great Britain shall be\r\nrespectively represented, charged with the consideration and settlement,\r\nupon a just, equitable, and honorable basis, of the entire question of\r\nthe fishing rights of the two Governments and their respective citizens\r\non the coasts of the United States and British North America. The\r\nfishing interests being intimately related to other general questions\r\ndependent upon contiguity and intercourse, consideration thereof in all\r\ntheir equities might also properly come within the purview of such a\r\ncommission, and the fullest latitude of expression on both sides should\r\nbe permitted.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in relation to the fishing rights will be submitted.\r\n\r\nThe arctic exploring steamer _Alert_, which was generously given by\r\nHer Majesty's Government to aid in the relief of the Greely expedition,\r\nwas, after the successful attainment of that humane purpose, returned to\r\nGreat Britain, in pursuance of the authority conferred by the act of\r\nMarch 3, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the existing engagements for extradition between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain has been long apparent. The tenth\r\narticle of the treaty of 1842, one of the earliest compacts in this\r\nregard entered into by us, stipulated for surrender in respect of a\r\nlimited number of offenses. Other crimes no less inimical to the social\r\nwelfare should be embraced and the procedure of extradition brought in\r\nharmony with present international practice. Negotiations with Her\r\nMajesty's Government for an enlarged treaty of extradition have been\r\npending since 1870, and I entertain strong hopes that a satisfactory\r\nresult may be soon attained.\r\n\r\nThe frontier line between Alaska and British Columbia, as defined by\r\nthe treaty of cession with Russia, follows the demarcation assigned\r\nin a prior treaty between Great Britain and Russia. Modern exploration\r\ndiscloses that this ancient boundary is impracticable as a geographical\r\nfact. In the unsettled condition of that region the question has lacked\r\nimportance, but the discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the\r\nline is supposed to traverse admonishes that the time has come when an\r\naccurate knowledge of the boundary is needful to avert jurisdictional\r\ncomplications. I recommend, therefore, that provision be made for a\r\npreliminary reconnoissance by officers of the United States, to the end\r\nof acquiring more precise information on the subject. I have invited\r\nHer Majesty's Government to consider with us the adoption of a more\r\nconvenient line, to be established by meridian observations or by known\r\ngeographical features without the necessity of an expensive survey of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nThe late insurrectionary movements in Hayti having been quelled, the\r\nGovernment of that Republic has made prompt provision for adjudicating\r\nthe losses suffered by foreigners because of hostilities there, and the\r\nclaims of certain citizens of the United States will be in this manner\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending claims of two citizens of the United States, Pelletier\r\nand Lazare, have been disposed of by arbitration, and an award in favor\r\nof each claimant has been made, which by the terms of the engagement is\r\nfinal. It remains for Congress to provide for the payment of the\r\nstipulated moiety of the expenses.\r\n\r\nA question arose with Hayti during the past year by reason of the\r\nexceptional treatment of an American citizen, Mr. Van Bokkelen, a\r\nresident of Port-au-Prince, who, on suit by creditors residing in the\r\nUnited States, was sentenced to imprisonment, and, under the operation\r\nof a Haytian statute, was denied relief secured to a native Haytian.\r\nThis Government asserted his treaty right to equal treatment with\r\nnatives of Hayti in all suits at law. Our contention was denied by the\r\nHaytian Government, which, however, while still professing to maintain\r\nthe ground taken against Mr. Van Bokkelen's right, terminated the\r\ncontroversy by setting him at liberty without explanation.\r\n\r\nAn international conference to consider the means of arresting the\r\nspread of cholera and other epidemic diseases was held at Rome in May\r\nlast, and adjourned to meet again on further notice. An expert delegate\r\non behalf of the United States has attended its sessions and will submit\r\na report.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico continue to be most cordial, as befits\r\nthose of neighbors between whom the strongest ties of friendship and\r\ncommercial intimacy exist, as the natural and growing consequence of our\r\nsimilarity of institutions and geographical propinquity.\r\n\r\nThe relocation of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico\r\nwestward of the Rio Grande, under the convention of July 29, 1882, has\r\nbeen unavoidably delayed, but I apprehend no difficulty in securing a\r\nprolongation of the period for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe lately concluded commercial treaty with Mexico still awaits the\r\nstipulated legislation to carry its provisions into effect, for which\r\none year's additional time has been secured by a supplementary article\r\nsigned in February last and since ratified on both sides.\r\n\r\nAs this convention, so important to the commercial welfare of the\r\ntwo adjoining countries, has been constitutionally confirmed by the\r\ntreaty-making branch, I express the hope that legislation needed to make\r\nit effective may not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nThe large influx of capital and enterprise to Mexico from the United\r\nStates continues to aid in the development of the resources and in\r\naugmenting the material well-being of our sister Republic. Lines of\r\nrailway, penetrating to the heart and capital of the country, bring\r\nthe two peoples into mutually beneficial intercourse, and enlarged\r\nfacilities of transit add to profitable commerce, create new markets,\r\nand furnish avenues to otherwise isolated communities.\r\n\r\nI have already adverted to the suggested construction of a ship railway\r\nacross the narrow formation of the territory of Mexico at Tehuantepec.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual recovery of Peru from the effects of her late\r\ndisastrous conflict with Chile, and with the restoration of civil\r\nauthority in that distracted country, it is hoped that pending war\r\nclaims of our citizens will be adjusted.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with notification given by the Government of Peru, the\r\nexisting treaties of commerce and extradition between the United States\r\nand that country will terminate March 31, 1886.\r\n\r\nOur good relationship with Russia continues.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the Navy, detailed for the purpose, is now on his way to\r\nSiberia bearing the testimonials voted by Congress to those who\r\ngenerously succored the survivors of the unfortunate _Jeannette_\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to advert to the cordiality of our intercourse with\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending claim of the owners of the ship _Masonic_ for loss\r\nsuffered through the admitted dereliction of the Spanish authorities in\r\nthe Philippine Islands has been adjusted by arbitration and an indemnity\r\nawarded. The principle of arbitration in such cases, to which the United\r\nStates have long and consistently adhered, thus receives a fresh and\r\ngratifying confirmation.\r\n\r\nOther questions with Spain have been disposed of or are under diplomatic\r\nconsideration with a view to just and honorable settlement.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the commercial agreement with Spain of January\r\n2-February 13, 1884, has been found inadequate to the commercial needs\r\nof the United States and the Spanish Antilles, and the terms of the\r\nagreement are subjected to conflicting interpretations in those islands.\r\n\r\nNegotiations have been instituted at Madrid for a full treaty not open\r\nto these objections and in the line of the general policy touching the\r\nneighborly intercourse of proximate communities, to which I elsewhere\r\nadvert, and aiming, moreover, at the removal of existing burdens and\r\nannoying restrictions; and although a satisfactory termination is\r\npromised, I am compelled to delay its announcement.\r\n\r\nAn international copyright conference was held at Berne in September, on\r\nthe invitation of the Swiss Government. The envoy of the United States\r\nattended as a delegate, but refrained from committing this Government to\r\nthe results, even by signing the recommendatory protocol adopted. The\r\ninteresting and important subject of international copyright has been\r\nbefore you for several years. Action is certainly desirable to effect\r\nthe object in view; and while there may be question as to the relative\r\nadvantage of treating it by legislation or by specific treaty, the\r\nmatured views of the Berne conference can not fail to aid your\r\nconsideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the commercial treaty of 1862 between the United\r\nStates and Turkey has been sought by that Government. While there is\r\nquestion as to the sufficiency of the notice of termination given, yet\r\nas the commercial rights of our citizens in Turkey come under the\r\nfavored-nation guaranties of the prior treaty of 1830, and as equal\r\ntreatment is admitted by the Porte, no inconvenience can result from the\r\nassent of this Government to the revision of the Ottoman tariffs, in\r\nwhich the treaty powers have been invited to join.\r\n\r\nQuestions concerning our citizens in Turkey may be affected by the\r\nPorte's nonacquiescence in the right of expatriation and by the\r\nimposition of religious tests as a condition of residence, in which\r\nthis Government can not concur. The United States must hold in their\r\nintercourse with every power that the status of their citizens is to be\r\nrespected and equal civil privileges accorded to them without regard\r\nto creed, and affected by no considerations save those growing out of\r\ndomiciliary return to the land of original allegiance or of unfulfilled\r\npersonal obligations which may survive, under municipal laws, after such\r\nvoluntary return.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with Venezuela relative to the rehearing of the awards\r\nof the mixed commission constituted under the treaty of 1866 was resumed\r\nin view of the recent acquiescence of the Venezuelan envoy in the\r\nprincipal point advanced by this Government, that the effects of the old\r\ntreaty could only be set aside by the operation of a new convention. A\r\nresult in substantial accord with the advisory suggestions contained in\r\nthe joint resolution of March 3, 1883, has been agreed upon and will\r\nshortly be submitted to the Senate for ratification.\r\n\r\nUnder section 3659 of the Revised Statutes all funds held in trust by\r\nthe United States and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not\r\notherwise required by treaty, are to be invested in stocks of the United\r\nStates bearing a rate of interest not less than 5 per cent per annum.\r\nThere being now no procurable stocks paying so high a rate of interest,\r\nthe letter of the statute is at present inapplicable, but its spirit is\r\nsubserved by continuing to make investments of this nature in current\r\nstocks bearing the highest interest now paid. The statute, however,\r\nmakes no provision for the disposal of such accretions. It being\r\ncontrary to the general rule of this Government to allow interest on\r\nclaims, I recommend the repeal of the provision in question and the\r\ndisposition, under a uniform rule, of the present accumulations from\r\ninvestment of trust funds.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of existing legislation touching citizenship and\r\nnaturalization demands your consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile recognizing the right of expatriation, no statutory provision\r\nexists providing means for renouncing citizenship by an American\r\ncitizen, native born or naturalized, nor for terminating and vacating\r\nan improper acquisition of citizenship. Even a fraudulent decree of\r\nnaturalization can not now be canceled. The privilege and franchise of\r\nAmerican citizenship should be granted with care, and extended to those\r\nonly who intend in good faith to assume its duties and responsibilities\r\nwhen attaining its privileges and benefits. It should be withheld from\r\nthose who merely go through the forms of naturalization with the intent\r\nof escaping the duties of their original allegiance without taking upon\r\nthemselves those of their new status, or who may acquire the rights of\r\nAmerican citizenship for no other than a hostile purpose toward their\r\noriginal governments. These evils have had many flagrant illustrations.\r\n\r\nI regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors\r\nthat provision be made for a central bureau of record of the decrees of\r\nnaturalization granted by the various courts throughout the United\r\nStates now invested with that power.\r\n\r\nThe rights which spring from domicile in the United States, especially\r\nwhen coupled with a declaration of intention to become a citizen, are\r\nworthy of definition by statute. The stranger coming hither with intent\r\nto remain, establishing his residence in our midst, contributing to the\r\ngeneral welfare, and by his voluntary act declaring his purpose to\r\nassume the responsibilities of citizenship, thereby gains an inchoate\r\nstatus which legislation may properly define. The laws of certain\r\nStates and Territories admit a domiciled alien to the local franchise,\r\nconferring on him the rights of citizenship to a degree which places him\r\nin the anomalous position of being a citizen of a State and yet not of\r\nthe United States within the purview of Federal and international law.\r\n\r\nIt is important within the scope of national legislation to define this\r\nright of alien domicile as distinguished from Federal naturalization.\r\n\r\nThe commercial relations of the United States with their immediate\r\nneighbors and with important areas of traffic near our shores suggest\r\nespecially liberal intercourse between them and us.\r\n\r\nFollowing the treaty of 1883 with Mexico, which rested on the basis of a\r\nreciprocal exemption from customs duties, other similar treaties were\r\ninitiated by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the need of less obstructed traffic with Cuba and Puerto\r\nRico, and met by the desire of Spain to succor languishing interests\r\nin the Antilles, steps were taken to attain those ends by a treaty of\r\ncommerce. A similar treaty was afterwards signed by the Dominican\r\nRepublic. Subsequently overtures were made by Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nGovernment for a like mutual extension of commercial intercourse with\r\nthe British West Indian and South American dependencies, but without\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOn taking office I withdrew for reexamination the treaties signed with\r\nSpain and Santo Domingo, then pending before the Senate. The result has\r\nbeen to satisfy me of the inexpediency of entering into engagements of\r\nthis character not covering the entire traffic.\r\n\r\nThese treaties contemplated the surrender by the United States of large\r\nrevenues for inadequate considerations. Upon sugar alone duties were\r\nsurrendered to an amount far exceeding all the advantages offered in\r\nexchange. Even were it intended to relieve our consumers, it was evident\r\nthat so long as the exemption but partially covered our importation such\r\nrelief would be illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essential seemed\r\nhighly improvident at a time when new and large drains upon the Treasury\r\nwere contemplated. Moreover, embarrassing questions would have arisen\r\nunder the favored-nation clauses of treaties with other nations.\r\n\r\nAs a further objection, it is evident that tariff regulation by treaty\r\ndiminishes that independent control over its own revenues which is\r\nessential for the safety and welfare of any government. Emergency\r\ncalling for an increase of taxation may at any time arise, and no\r\nengagement with a foreign power should exist to hamper the action of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBy the fourteenth section of the shipping act approved June 26, 1884,\r\ncertain reductions and contingent exemptions from tonnage dues were made\r\nas to vessels entering ports of the United States from any foreign port\r\nin North and Central America, the West India Islands, the Bahamas and\r\nBermudas, Mexico, and the Isthmus as far as Aspinwall and Panama. The\r\nGovernments of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Portugal, and Sweden and\r\nNorway have asserted, under the favored-nation clause in their treaties\r\nwith the United States, a claim to like treatment in respect of vessels\r\ncoming to the United States from their home ports. This Government,\r\nhowever, holds that the privileges granted by the act are purely\r\ngeographical, inuring to any vessel of any foreign power that may choose\r\nto engage in traffic between this country and any port within the\r\ndefined zone, and no warrant exists under the most-favored-nation clause\r\nfor the extension of the privileges in question to vessels sailing to\r\nthis country from ports outside the limitation of the act.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the relations of commerce with our near neighbors, whose\r\nterritories form so long a frontier line difficult to be guarded, and\r\nwho find in our country, and equally offer to us, natural markets,\r\ndemand special and considerate treatment. It rests with Congress to\r\nconsider what legislative action may increase facilities of intercourse\r\nwhich contiguity makes natural and desirable.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge that Congress recast the appropriations for the\r\nmaintenance of the diplomatic and consular service on a footing\r\ncommensurate with the importance of our national interests. At every\r\npost where a representative is necessary the salary should be so graded\r\nas to permit him to live with comfort. With the assignment of adequate\r\nsalaries the so-called notarial extraofficial fees, which our officers\r\nabroad are now permitted to treat as personal perquisites, should be\r\ndone away with. Every act requiring the certification and seal of the\r\nofficer should be taxable at schedule rates and the fee therefor\r\nreturned to the Treasury. By restoring these revenues to the public use\r\nthe consular service would be self-supporting, even with a liberal\r\nincrease of the present low salaries.\r\n\r\nIn further prevention of abuses a system of consular inspection should\r\nbe instituted.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a limited number of secretaries of legation at large,\r\nto be assigned to duty wherever necessary, and in particular for\r\ntemporary service at missions which for any cause may be without a head,\r\nshould also be authorized.\r\n\r\nI favor also authorization for the detail of officers of the regular\r\nservice as military or naval attachés at legations.\r\n\r\nSome foreign governments do not recognize the union of consular with\r\ndiplomatic functions. Italy and Venezuela will only receive the\r\nappointee in one of his two capacities, but this does not prevent the\r\nrequirement of a bond and submission to the responsibilities of an\r\noffice whose duties he can not discharge. The superadded title of\r\nconsul-general should be abandoned at all missions.\r\n\r\nI deem it expedient that a well-devised measure for the reorganization\r\nof the extraterritorial courts in Oriental countries should replace the\r\npresent system, which labors under the disadvantage of combining\r\njudicial and executive functions in the same office.\r\n\r\nIn several Oriental countries generous offers have been made of\r\npremises for housing the legations of the United States. A grant of\r\nland for that purpose was made some years since by Japan, and has been\r\nreferred to in the annual messages of my predecessor. The Siamese\r\nGovernment has made a gift to the United States of commodious quarters\r\nin Bangkok. In Korea the late minister was permitted to purchase a\r\nbuilding from the Government for legation use. In China the premises\r\nrented for the legation are favored as to local charges. At Tangier\r\nthe house occupied by our representative has been for many years the\r\nproperty of this Government, having been given for that purpose in 1822\r\nby the Sultan of Morocco. I approve the suggestion heretofore made,\r\nthat, in view of the conditions of life and administration in the\r\nEastern countries, the legation buildings in China, Japan, Korea, Siam,\r\nand perhaps Persia, should be owned and furnished by the Government\r\nwith a view to permanency and security. To this end I recommend that\r\nauthority be given to accept the gifts adverted to in Japan and Siam,\r\nand to purchase in the other countries named, with provision for\r\nfurniture and repairs. A considerable saving in rentals would result.\r\n\r\nThe World's Industrial Exposition, held at New Orleans last winter, with\r\nthe assistance of the Federal Government, attracted a large number of\r\nforeign exhibits, and proved of great value in spreading among the\r\nconcourse of visitors from Mexico and Central and South America a wider\r\nknowledge of the varied manufactures and productions of this country and\r\ntheir availability in exchange for the productions of those regions.\r\n\r\nPast Congresses have had under consideration the advisability of\r\nabolishing the discrimination made by the tariff laws in favor of the\r\nworks of American artists. The odium of the policy which subjects to\r\na high rate of duty the paintings of foreign artists and exempts the\r\nproductions of American artists residing abroad, and who receive\r\ngratuitously advantages and instruction, is visited upon our citizens\r\nengaged in art culture in Europe, and has caused them with practical\r\nunanimity to favor the abolition of such an ungracious distinction; and\r\nin their interest, and for other obvious reasons, I strongly recommend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury fully exhibits the condition\r\nof the public finances and of the several branches of the Government\r\nconnected with his Department. The suggestions of the Secretary relating\r\nto the practical operations of this important Department, and his\r\nrecommendations in the direction of simplification and economy,\r\nparticularly in the work of collecting customs duties, are especially\r\nurged upon the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June\r\n30, 1885, were $322,690,706.38. Of this sum $181,471,939.34 was received\r\nfrom customs and $112,498,725.54 from internal revenue. The total\r\nreceipts, as given above, were $24,829,163.54 less than those for the\r\nyear ended June 30, 1884. This diminution embraces a falling off of\r\n$13,595,550.42 in the receipts from customs and $9,687,346.97 in the\r\nreceipts from internal revenue.\r\n\r\nThe total ordinary expenditures of the Government for the fiscal year\r\nwere $260,226,935.50, leaving a surplus in the Treasury at the close of\r\nthe year of $63,463,771.27. This is $40,929,854.32 less than the surplus\r\nreported at the close of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures are classified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  For civil expenses                                      $23,826,942.11\r\n  For foreign intercourse                                   5,439,609.11\r\n  For Indians                                               6,552,494.63\r\n  For pensions                                             56,102,267.49\r\n  For the military, including river and harbor             42,670,578.47\r\n    improvements and arsenals\r\n  For the Navy, including vessels, machinery, and          16,021,079.69\r\n    improvements of navy-yards\r\n  For interest on the public debt                          51,386,256.47\r\n  For the District of Columbia                              3,499,650.95\r\n  For miscellaneous expenditures, including public         54,728,056.21\r\n    buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount paid on the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1885, was $45,993,235.43, and there has been paid since that date and up\r\nto November 1, 1885, the sum of $369,828, leaving the amount of the debt\r\nat the last-named date $1,514,475,860.47. There was, however, at that\r\ntime in the Treasury, applicable to the general purposes of the\r\nGovernment, the sum of $66,818,292.38.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1886,\r\nascertained to October 1, 1885, and estimated for the remainder of the\r\nyear, are $315,000,000. The expenditures ascertained and estimated for\r\nthe same time are $245,000,000, leaving a surplus at the close of the\r\nyear estimated at $70,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe value of the exports from the United States to foreign countries\r\nduring the last fiscal year was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Domestic merchandise                                   $726,682,946.00\r\n  Foreign merchandise                                      15,506,809.00\r\n                                                          742,189,755.00\r\n\r\n  Gold                                                      8,477,892.00\r\n  Silver                                                   33,753,633.00\r\n                                                          784,421,280.00\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the principal exports, with their values and the percentage they\r\nrespectively bear to the total exportation, are given as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Articles.

Our Government is but\r\nthe means established by the will of a free people by which certain\r\nprinciples are applied which they have adopted for their benefit and\r\nprotection; and it is never better administered and its true spirit is\r\nnever better observed than when the people's taxation for its support is\r\nscrupulously limited to the actual necessity of expenditure and\r\ndistributed according to a just and equitable plan.\r\n\r\nThe proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction of the\r\nrevenue received by the Government, and indirectly paid by the people,\r\nfrom customs duties. The question of free trade is not involved, nor is\r\nthere now any occasion for the general discussion of the wisdom or\r\nexpediency of a protective system.\r\n\r\nJustice and fairness dictate that in any modification of our present\r\nlaws relating to revenue the industries and interests which have\r\nbeen encouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens have large\r\ninvestments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should\r\nalso deal with the subject in such manner as to protect the interests of\r\nAmerican labor, which is the capital of our workingmen. Its stability\r\nand proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a\r\nprotective policy.\r\n\r\nWithin these limitations a certain reduction should be made in our\r\ncustoms revenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined,\r\nthe inquiry follows, Where can it best be remitted and what articles can\r\nbest be released from duty in the interest of our citizens?\r\n\r\nI think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from a\r\ntax upon the imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen the\r\ncost of living in every family of the land and release to the people in\r\nevery humble home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal industry.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ended November 1, 1885, 145 national banks were\r\norganized, with an aggregate capital of $16,938,000, and circulating\r\nnotes have been issued to them amounting to $4,274,910. The whole number\r\nof these banks in existence on the day above mentioned was 2,727.\r\n\r\nThe very limited amount of circulating notes issued by our national\r\nbanks, compared with the amount the law permits them to issue upon a\r\ndeposit of bonds for their redemption, indicates that the volume of our\r\ncirculating medium may be largely increased through this\r\ninstrumentality.\r\n\r\nNothing more important than the present condition of our currency and\r\ncoinage can claim your attention.\r\n\r\nSince February, 1878, the Government has, under the compulsory\r\nprovisions of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the\r\nrate of more than $2,000,000 every month. By this process up to the\r\npresent date 215,759,431 silver dollars have been coined.\r\n\r\nA reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the General\r\nGovernment would limit its exercise, without express restrictive words,\r\nto the people's needs and the requirements of the public welfare.\r\n\r\nUpon this theory the authority to \"coin money\" given to Congress by the\r\nConstitution, if it permits the purchase by the Government of bullion\r\nfor coinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to\r\nan extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulating medium.\r\n\r\nThe desire to utilize the silver product of the country should not lead\r\nto a misuse or the perversion of this power.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for such an addition to the silver currency of the nation\r\nas is compelled by the silver-coinage act is negatived by the fact that\r\nup to the present time only about 50,000,000 of the silver dollars so\r\ncoined have actually found their way into circulation, leaving more than\r\n165,000,000 in the possession of the Government, the custody of which\r\nhas entailed a considerable expense for the construction of vaults for\r\nits deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver\r\ncertificates amounting to about $93,000,000.\r\n\r\nEvery month two millions of gold in the public Treasury are paid out for\r\ntwo millions or more of silver dollars, to be added to the idle mass\r\nalready accumulated.\r\n\r\nIf continued long enough, this operation will result in the substitution\r\nof silver for all the gold the Government owns applicable to its general\r\npurposes. It will not do to rely upon the customs receipts of the\r\nGovernment to make good this drain of gold, because the silver thus\r\ncoined having been made legal tender for all debts and dues, public and\r\nprivate, at times during the last six months 58 per cent of the receipts\r\nfor duties has been in silver or silver certificates, while the average\r\nwithin that period has been 20 per cent. The proportion of silver and\r\nits certificates received by the Government will probably increase as\r\ntime goes on, for the reason that the nearer the period approaches when\r\nit will be obliged to offer silver in payment of its obligations the\r\ngreater inducement there will be to hoard gold against depreciation in\r\nthe value of silver or for the purpose of speculating.\r\n\r\nThis hoarding of gold has already begun.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes that gold has been withdrawn from circulation, then\r\nwill be apparent the difference between the real value of the silver\r\ndollar and a dollar in gold, and the two coins will part company.\r\nGold, still the standard of value and necessary in our dealings with\r\nother countries, will be at a premium over silver; banks which have\r\nsubstituted gold for the deposits of their customers may pay them with\r\nsilver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome profit; rich\r\nspeculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neighbors who need it\r\nto liquidate their foreign debts, at a ruinous premium over silver, and\r\nthe laboring men and women of the land, most defenseless of all, will\r\nfind that the dollar received for the wage of their toil has sadly\r\nshrunk in its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result\r\nwill be but temporary, and that ultimately the price of labor will be\r\nadjusted to the change; but even if this takes place the wage-worker\r\ncan not possibly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the price he is\r\ncompelled to pay for his living will not only be measured in a coin\r\nheavily depreciated and fluctuating and uncertain in its value, but\r\nthis uncertainty in the value of the purchasing medium will be made\r\nthe pretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by actual\r\ndepreciation.\r\n\r\nThe words uttered in 1834 by Daniel Webster in the Senate of the United\r\nStates are true to-day:\r\n\r\n  The very man of all others who has the deepest interest in a sound\r\n  currency, and who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money\r\n  matters, is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished advocate of bimetallism, discussing our silver\r\ncoinage, has lately written:\r\n\r\n  No American citizen's hand has yet felt the sensation of cheapness,\r\n  either in receiving or expending the silver-act dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel that\r\nsensation of cheapness. However plenty silver dollars may become, they\r\nwill not be distributed as gifts among the people; and if the laboring\r\nman should receive four depreciated dollars where he now receives but\r\ntwo, he will pay in the depreciated coin more than double the price he\r\nnow pays for all the necessaries and comforts of life.\r\n\r\nThose who do not fear any disastrous consequences arising from the\r\ncontinued compulsory coinage of silver as now directed by law, and who\r\nsuppose that the addition to the currency of the country intended as its\r\nresult will be a public benefit, are reminded that history demonstrates\r\nthat the point is easily reached in the attempt to float at the same\r\ntime two sorts of money of different excellence when the better will\r\ncease to be in general circulation. The hoarding of gold which has\r\nalready taken place indicates that we shall not escape the usual\r\nexperience in such cases. So if this silver coinage be continued we may\r\nreasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field of\r\ncirculation to silver alone. This of course must produce a severe\r\ncontraction of our circulating medium, instead of adding to it.\r\n\r\nIt will not be disputed that any attempt on the part of the Government\r\nto cause the circulation of silver dollars worth 80 cents side by\r\nside with gold dollars worth 100 cents, even within the limit that\r\nlegislation does not run counter to the laws of trade, to be successful\r\nmust be seconded by the confidence of the people that both coins will\r\nretain the same purchasing power and be interchangeable at will.\r\nA special effort has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\nincrease the amount of our silver coin in circulation; but the fact\r\nthat a large share of the limited amount thus put out has soon returned\r\nto the public Treasury in payment of duties leads to the belief that the\r\npeople do not now desire to keep it in hand, and this, with the evident\r\ndisposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the suspicion that there\r\nalready exists a lack of confidence among the people touching our\r\nfinancial processes. There is certainly not enough silver now in\r\ncirculation to cause uneasiness, and the whole amount coined and now on\r\nhand might after a time be absorbed by the people without apprehension;\r\nbut it is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the land which\r\ncauses fear and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWhat has been thus far submitted upon this subject relates almost\r\nentirely to considerations of a home nature, unconnected with the\r\nbearing which the policies of other nations have upon the question. But\r\nit is perfectly apparent that a line of action in regard to our currency\r\ncan not wisely be settled upon or persisted in without considering the\r\nattitude on the subject of other countries with whom we maintain\r\nintercourse through commerce, trade, and travel. An acknowledgment of\r\nthis fact is found in the act by virtue of which our silver is\r\ncompulsorily coined. It provides that--\r\n\r\n  The President shall invite the governments of the countries composing\r\n  the Latin Union, so called, and of such other European nations as he may\r\n  deem advisable, to join the United States in a conference to adopt a\r\n  common ratio between gold and silver for the purpose of establishing\r\n  internationally the use of bimetallic money and securing fixity of\r\n  relative value between those metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis conference absolutely failed, and a similar fate has awaited all\r\nsubsequent efforts in the same direction. And still we continue our\r\ncoinage of silver at a ratio different from that of any other nation.\r\nThe most vital part of the silver-coinage act remains inoperative and\r\nunexecuted, and without an ally or friend we battle upon the silver\r\nfield in an illogical and losing contest.\r\n\r\nTo give full effect to the design of Congress on this subject I have\r\nmade careful and earnest endeavor since the adjournment of the last\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nTo this end I delegated a gentleman well instructed in fiscal science\r\nto proceed to the financial centers of Europe and, in conjunction\r\nwith our ministers to England, France, and Germany, to obtain a full\r\nknowledge of the attitude and intent of those governments in respect of\r\nthe establishment of such an international ratio as would procure free\r\ncoinage of both metals at the mints of those countries and our own. By\r\nmy direction our consul-general at Paris has given close attention to\r\nthe proceedings of the congress of the Latin Union, in order to indicate\r\nour interest in its objects and report its action.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in brief, as the result of these efforts, that the\r\nattitude of the leading powers remains substantially unchanged since the\r\nmonetary conference of 1881, nor is it to be questioned that the views\r\nof these governments are in each instance supported by the weight of\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nThe steps thus taken have therefore only more fully demonstrated the\r\nuselessness of further attempts at present to arrive at any agreement on\r\nthe subject with other nations.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we are accumulating silver coin, based upon our own\r\npeculiar ratio, to such an extent, and assuming so heavy a burden to be\r\nprovided for in any international negotiations, as will render us an\r\nundesirable party to any future monetary conference of nations.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that four of the five countries composing the\r\nLatin Union mentioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with their silver\r\ncurrency, have just completed an agreement among themselves that no more\r\nsilver shall be coined by their respective Governments and that such as\r\nhas been already coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold\r\nby the country of its coinage. The resort to this expedient by these\r\ncountries may well arrest the attention of those who suppose that we\r\ncan succeed without shock or injury in the attempt to circulate upon\r\nits merits all the silver we may coin under the provisions of our\r\nsilver-coinage act.\r\n\r\nThe condition in which our Treasury may be placed by a persistence in\r\nour present course is a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen who\r\ndoes not desire his Government to pay in silver such of its obligations\r\nas should be paid in gold. Nor should our condition be such as to oblige\r\nus, in a prudent management of our affairs, to discontinue the calling\r\nin and payment of interest-bearing obligations which we have the right\r\nnow to discharge, and thus avoid the payment of further interest\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nThe so-called debtor class, for whose benefit the continued compulsory\r\ncoinage of silver is insisted upon, are not dishonest because they are\r\nin debt, and they should not be suspected of a desire to jeopardize the\r\nfinancial safety of the country in order that they may cancel their\r\npresent debts by paying the same in depreciated dollars. Nor should it\r\nbe forgotten that it is not the rich nor the money lender alone that\r\nmust submit to such a readjustment, enforced by the Government and their\r\ndebtors. The pittance of the widow and the orphan and the incomes of\r\nhelpless beneficiaries of all kinds would be disastrously reduced. The\r\ndepositors in savings banks and in other institutions which hold in\r\ntrust the savings of the poor, when their little accumulations are\r\nscaled down to meet the new order of things, would in their distress\r\npainfully realize the delusion of the promise made to them that\r\nplentiful money would improve their condition.\r\n\r\nWe have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply the\r\npresent needs of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish\r\nto see them in circulation, and if their coinage is suspended they can\r\nbe readily obtained by all who desire them. If the need of more is at\r\nany time apparent, their coinage may be renewed.\r\n\r\nThat disaster has not already overtaken us furnishes no proof that\r\ndanger does not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage.\r\nWe have been saved by the most careful management and unusual\r\nexpedients, by a combination of fortunate conditions, and by a confident\r\nexpectation that the course of the Government in regard to silver\r\ncoinage would be speedily changed by the action of Congress.\r\n\r\nProsperity hesitates upon our threshold because of the dangers and\r\nuncertainties surrounding this question. Capital timidly shrinks\r\nfrom trade, and investors are unwilling to take the chance of the\r\nquestionable shape in which their money will be returned to them, while\r\nenterprise halts at a risk against which care and sagacious management\r\ndo not protect.\r\n\r\nAs a necessary consequence, labor lacks employment and suffering and\r\ndistress are visited upon a portion of our fellow-citizens especially\r\nentitled to the careful consideration of those charged with the duties\r\nof legislation. No interest appeals to us so strongly for a safe and\r\nstable currency as the vast army of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nI recommend the suspension of the compulsory coinage of silver dollars,\r\ndirected by the law passed in February, 1878.\r\n\r\nThe Steamboat-Inspection Service on the 30th day of June, 1885, was\r\ncomposed of 140 persons, including officers, clerks, and messengers. The\r\nexpenses of the service over the receipts were $138,822.22 during the\r\nfiscal year. The special inspection of foreign steam vessels, organized\r\nunder a law passed in 1882, was maintained during the year at an expense\r\nof $36,641.63. Since the close of the fiscal year reductions have been\r\nmade in the force employed which will result in a saving during the\r\ncurrent year of $17,000 without affecting the efficiency of the service.\r\n\r\nThe Supervising Surgeon-General reports that during the fiscal year\r\n41,714 patients have received relief through the Marine-Hospital\r\nService, of whom 12,803 were treated in hospitals and 28,911 at the\r\ndispensaries.\r\n\r\nActive and effective efforts have been made through the medium of this\r\nservice to protect the country against an invasion of cholera, which has\r\nprevailed in Spain and France, and the smallpox, which recently broke\r\nout in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe most gratifying results have attended the operations of the\r\nLife-Saving Service during the last fiscal year. The observance of the\r\nprovision of law requiring the appointment of the force employed in this\r\nservice to be made \"solely with reference to their fitness, and without\r\nreference to their political or party affiliation,\" has secured the\r\nresult which may confidently be expected in any branch of public\r\nemployment where such a rule is applied. As a consequence, this service\r\nis composed of men well qualified for the performance of their dangerous\r\nand exceptionally important duties.\r\n\r\nThe number of stations in commission at the close of the year was 203.\r\nThe number of disasters to vessels and craft of all kinds within their\r\nfield of action was 371. The number of persons endangered in such\r\ndisasters was 2,439, of whom 2,428 were saved and only 11 lost. Other\r\nlives which were imperiled, though not by disasters to shipping, were\r\nalso rescued, and a large amount of property was saved through the aid\r\nof this service. The cost of its maintenance during the year was\r\n$828,474.43.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was during the last fiscal\r\nyear carried on within the boundaries and off the coasts of thirty-two\r\nStates, two Territories, and the District of Columbia. In July last\r\ncertain irregularities were found to exist in the management of this\r\nBureau, which led to a prompt investigation of its methods. The abuses\r\nwhich were brought to light by this examination and the reckless\r\ndisregard of duty and the interests of the Government developed on\r\nthe part of some of those connected with the service made a change of\r\nsuperintendency and a few of its other officers necessary. Since the\r\nBureau has been in new hands an introduction of economies and the\r\napplication of business methods have produced an important saving to\r\nthe Government and a promise of more useful results.\r\n\r\nThis service has never been regulated by anything but the most\r\nindefinite legal enactments and the most unsatisfactory rules. It was\r\nmany years ago sanctioned apparently for a purpose regarded as temporary\r\nand related to a survey of our coast. Having gained a place in the\r\nappropriations made by Congress, it has gradually taken to itself powers\r\nand objects not contemplated in its creation and extended its operations\r\nuntil it sadly needs legislative attention.\r\n\r\nSo far as a further survey of our coast is concerned, there seems\r\nto be a propriety in transferring that work to the Navy Department. The\r\nother duties now in charge of this establishment, if they can not be\r\nprofitably attached to some existing Department or other bureau, should\r\nbe prosecuted under a law exactly defining their scope and purpose, and\r\nwith a careful discrimination between the scientific inquiries which may\r\nproperly be assumed by the Government and those which should be\r\nundertaken by State authority or by individual enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the report of the Congressional committee heretofore\r\nappointed to investigate this and other like matters will aid in the\r\naccomplishment of proper legislation on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War is herewith submitted. The attention\r\nof Congress is invited to the detailed account which it contains of the\r\nadministration of his Department, and his recommendations and\r\nsuggestions for the improvement of the service.\r\n\r\nThe Army consisted, at the date of the last consolidated returns, of\r\n2,154 officers and 24,705 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Departments for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1885,\r\nincluding $13,164,394.60 for public works and river and harbor\r\nimprovements, were $45,850,999.54.\r\n\r\nBesides the troops which were dispatched in pursuit of the small band of\r\nIndians who left their reservation in Arizona and committed murders and\r\noutrages, two regiments of cavalry and one of infantry were sent last\r\nJuly to the Indian Territory to prevent an outbreak which seemed\r\nimminent. They remained to aid, if necessary, in the expulsion of\r\nintruders upon the reservation, who seemed to have caused the discontent\r\namong the Indians, but the Executive proclamation[2] warning them to\r\nremove was complied with without their interference.\r\n\r\nTroops were also sent to Rock Springs, in Wyoming Territory, after the\r\nmassacre of Chinese there, to prevent further disturbance, and\r\nafterwards to Seattle, in Washington Territory, to avert a threatened\r\nattack upon Chinese laborers and domestic violence there. In both cases\r\nthe mere presence of the troops had the desired effect.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the number of desertions has diminished, but that during\r\nthe last fiscal year they numbered 2,927; and one instance is given by\r\nthe Lieutenant-General of six desertions by the same recruit. I am\r\nconvinced that this number of desertions can be much diminished by\r\nbetter discipline and treatment; but the punishment should be increased\r\nfor repeated offenses.\r\n\r\nThese desertions might also be reduced by lessening the term of first\r\nenlistments, thus allowing a discontented recruit to contemplate a\r\nnearer discharge and the Army a profitable riddance. After one term of\r\nservice a reenlistment would be quite apt to secure a contented recruit\r\nand a good soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Acting Judge-Advocate-General reports that the number of trials by\r\ngeneral courts-martial during the year was 2,328, and that 11,851 trials\r\ntook place before garrison and regimental courts-martial. The suggestion\r\nthat probably more than half the Army have been tried for offenses,\r\ngreat and small, in one year may well arrest attention. Of course many\r\nof these trials before garrison and regimental courts-martial were for\r\noffenses almost frivolous, and there should, I think, be a way devised\r\nto dispose of these in a more summary and less inconvenient manner than\r\nby court-martial.\r\n\r\nIf some of the proceedings of courts-martial which I have had occasion\r\nto examine present the ideas of justice which generally prevail in these\r\ntribunals, I am satisfied that they should be much reformed if the honor\r\nand the honesty of the Army and Navy are by their instrumentality to be\r\nvindicated and protected.\r\n\r\nThe Board on Fortifications or other defenses, appointed in pursuance of\r\nthe provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1885, will in a\r\nshort time present their report, and it is hoped that this may greatly\r\naid the legislation so necessary to remedy the present defenseless\r\ncondition of our seacoasts.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Signal Service has been prosecuted during the last\r\nyear with results of increasing benefit to the country. The field of\r\ninstruction has been enlarged with a view of adding to its usefulness.\r\nThe number of stations in operation June 30, 1885, was 489. Telegraphic\r\nreports are received daily from 160 stations. Reports are also received\r\nfrom 25 Canadian stations, 375 volunteer observers, 52 army surgeons at\r\nmilitary posts, and 333 foreign stations. The expense of the service\r\nduring the fiscal year, after deducting receipts from military telegraph\r\nlines, was $792,592.97. In view of the fact referred to by the Secretary\r\nof War, that the work of this service ordinarily is of a scientific\r\nnature, and the further fact that it is assuming larger proportions\r\nconstantly and becoming more and more unsuited to the fixed rules which\r\nmust govern the Army, I am inclined to agree with him in the opinion\r\nthat it should be separately established. If this is done, the scope and\r\nextent of its operations should, as nearly as possible, be definitely\r\nprescribed by law and always capable of exact ascertainment.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy at West Point is reported as being in a high state\r\nof efficiency and well equipped for the satisfactory accomplishment of\r\nthe purposes of its maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the class which graduates next year is an unusually\r\nlarge one has constrained me to decline to make appointments to second\r\nlieutenancies in the Army from civil life, so that such vacancies as\r\nexist in these places may be reserved for such graduates; and yet it is\r\nnot probable that there will be enough vacancies to provide positions\r\nfor them all when they leave the military school. Under the prevailing\r\nlaw and usage those not thus assigned to duty never actively enter the\r\nmilitary service. It is suggested that the law on this subject be\r\nchanged so that such of these young men as are not at once assigned to\r\nduty after graduation may be retained as second lieutenants in the Army\r\nif they desire it, subject to assignment when opportunity occurs, and\r\nunder proper rules as to priority of selection.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures on account of the Military Academy for the last fiscal\r\nyear, exclusive of the sum taken for its purposes from appropriations\r\nfor the support of the Army, were $290,712.07.\r\n\r\nThe act approved March 3, 1885, designed to compensate officers and\r\nenlisted men for loss of private property while in the service of the\r\nUnited States, is so indefinite in its terms and apparently admits so\r\nmany claims the adjustment of which could not have been contemplated\r\nthat if it is to remain upon the statute book it needs amendment.\r\n\r\nThere should be a general law of Congress prohibiting the construction\r\nof bridges over navigable waters in such manner as to obstruct\r\nnavigation, with provisions for preventing the same. It seems that under\r\nexisting statutes the Government can not intervene to prevent such a\r\nconstruction when entered upon without its consent, though when such\r\nconsent is asked and granted upon condition the authority to insist upon\r\nsuch condition is clear. Thus it is represented that while the officers\r\nof the Government are with great care guarding against the obstruction\r\nof navigation by a bridge across the Mississippi River at St. Paul a\r\nlarge pier for a bridge has been built just below this place directly in\r\nthe navigable channel of the river. If such things are to be permitted,\r\na strong argument is presented against the appropriation of large sums\r\nof money to improve the navigation of this and other important highways\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy gives a history of the\r\noperations of his Department and the present condition of the work\r\ncommitted to his charge.\r\n\r\nHe details in full the course pursued by him to protect the rights of\r\nthe Government in respect of certain vessels unfinished at the time\r\nof his accession to office, and also concerning the dispatch boat\r\n_Dolphin_, claimed to be completed and awaiting the acceptance of\r\nthe Department. No one can fail to see from recitals contained in this\r\nreport that only the application of business principles has been\r\ninsisted upon in the treatment of these subjects, and that whatever\r\ncontroversy has arisen was caused by the exaction on the part of the\r\nDepartment of contract obligations as they were legally construed. In\r\nthe case of the _Dolphin_, with entire justice to the contractor,\r\nan agreement has been entered into providing for the ascertainment by a\r\njudicial inquiry of the complete or partial compliance with the contract\r\nin her construction, and further providing for the assessment of any\r\ndamages to which the Government may be entitled on account of a partial\r\nfailure to perform such contract, or the payment of the sum still\r\nremaining unpaid upon her price in case a full performance is adjudged.\r\n\r\nThe contractor, by reason of his failure in business, being unable to\r\ncomplete the other three vessels, they were taken possession of by the\r\nGovernment in their unfinished state under a clause in the contract\r\npermitting such a course, and are now in process of completion in the\r\nyard of the contractor, but under the supervision of the Navy\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session authorized the construction of two\r\nadditional new cruisers and two gunboats, at a cost not exceeding in the\r\naggregate $2,995,000. The appropriation for this purpose having become\r\navailable on the 1st day of July last, steps were at once taken for the\r\nprocurement of such plans for the construction of these vessels as would\r\nbe likely to insure their usefulness when completed. These are of the\r\nutmost importance, considering the constant advance in the art of\r\nbuilding vessels of this character, and the time is not lost which is\r\nspent in their careful consideration and selection.\r\n\r\nAll must admit the importance of an effective navy to a nation like\r\nours, having such an extended seacoast to protect; and yet we have not\r\na single vessel of war that could keep the seas against a first-class\r\nvessel of any important power. Such a condition ought not longer to\r\ncontinue. The nation that can not resist aggression is constantly\r\nexposed to it. Its foreign policy is of necessity weak and its\r\nnegotiations are conducted with disadvantage because it is not in\r\ncondition to enforce the terms dictated by its sense of right and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nInspired, as I am, by the hope, shared by all patriotic citizens, that\r\nthe day is not very far distant when our Navy will be such as befits our\r\nstanding among the nations of the earth, and rejoiced at every step that\r\nleads in the direction of such a consummation, I deem it my duty to\r\nespecially direct the attention of Congress to the close of the report\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy, in which the humiliating weakness of the\r\npresent organization of his Department is exhibited and the startling\r\nabuses and waste of its present methods are exposed. The conviction is\r\nforced upon us with the certainty of mathematical demonstration that\r\nbefore we proceed further in the, restoration of a Navy we need a\r\nthoroughly reorganized Navy Department. The fact that within seventeen\r\nyears more than $75,000,000 have been spent in the construction, repair,\r\nequipment, and armament of vessels, and the further fact that instead\r\nof an effective and creditable fleet we have only the discontent and\r\napprehension of a nation undefended by war vessels, added to the\r\ndisclosures now made, do not permit us to doubt that every attempt to\r\nrevive our Navy has thus far for the most part been misdirected, and\r\nall our efforts in that direction have been little better than blind\r\ngropings and expensive, aimless follies.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably if we are content with the maintenance of a Navy\r\nDepartment simply as a shabby ornament to the Government, a constant\r\nwatchfulness may prevent some of the scandal and abuse which have found\r\ntheir way into our present organization, and its incurable waste may\r\nbe reduced to the minimum. But if we desire to build ships for present\r\nusefulness instead of naval reminders of the days that are past, we must\r\nhave a Department organized for the work, supplied with all the talent\r\nand ingenuity our country affords, prepared to take advantage of the\r\nexperience of other nations, systematized so that all effort shall\r\nunite and lead in one direction, and fully imbued with the conviction\r\nthat war vessels, though new, are useless unless they combine all that\r\nthe ingenuity of man has up to this day brought forth relating to their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nI earnestly commend the portion of the Secretary's report devoted\r\nto this subject to the attention of Congress, in the hope that his\r\nsuggestions touching the reorganization of his Department may be adopted\r\nas the first step toward the reconstruction of our Navy.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the postal service are exhibited by the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenue, whose ratio of gain upon the rising prosperity\r\nof 1882 and 1883 outstripped the increasing expenses of our growing\r\nservice, was checked by the reduction in the rate of letter postage\r\nwhich took effect with the beginning of October in the latter year, and\r\nit diminished during the two past fiscal years $2,790,000, in about the\r\nproportion of $2,270,000 in 1884 to $520,000 in 1885. Natural growth\r\nand development have meantime increased expenditure, resulting in a\r\ndeficiency in the revenue to meet the expenses of the Department of five\r\nand a quarter million dollars for the year 1884 and eight and a third\r\nmillion in the last fiscal year. The anticipated and natural revival of\r\nthe revenue has been oppressed and retarded by the unfavorable business\r\ncondition of the country, of which the postal service is a faithful\r\nindicator. The gratifying fact is shown, however, by the report that our\r\nreturning prosperity is marked by a gain of $380,000 in the revenue of\r\nthe latter half of the last year over the corresponding period of the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nThe change in the weight of first-class matter which may be carried\r\nfor a single rate of postage from a half ounce to an ounce, and the\r\nreduction by one-half of the rate of newspaper postage, which, under\r\nrecent legislation, began with the current year, will operate to\r\nrestrain the augmentation of receipts which otherwise might have been\r\nexpected to such a degree that the scale of expense may gain upon the\r\nrevenue and cause an increased deficiency to be shown at its close.\r\nYet, after no long period of reawakened prosperity, by proper economy\r\nit is confidently anticipated that even the present low rates, now as\r\nfavorable as any country affords, will be adequate to sustain the cost\r\nof the service.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the Post-Office Department is for the convenience\r\nand benefit of the people, and the method by which they pay the charges\r\nof this useful arm of their public service, so that it be just and\r\nimpartial, is of less importance to them than the economical expenditure\r\nof the means they provide for its maintenance and the due improvement of\r\nits agencies, so that they may enjoy its highest usefulness.\r\n\r\nA proper attention has been directed to the prevention of waste or\r\nextravagance, and good results appear from the report to have already\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General to reduce the\r\ncharges on domestic money orders of $5 and less from 8 to 5 cents. This\r\nchange will materially aid those of our people who most of all avail\r\nthemselves of this instrumentality, but to whom the element of cheapness\r\nis of the greatest importance. With this reduction the system would\r\nstill remain self-supporting.\r\n\r\nThe free-delivery system has been extended to 19 additional cities\r\nduring the year, and 178 now enjoy its conveniences. Experience has\r\ncommended it to those who enjoy its benefits, and further enlargement\r\nof its facilities is due to other communities to which it is adapted.\r\nIn the cities where it has been established, taken together, the local\r\npostage exceeds its maintenance by nearly $1,300,000. The limit to which\r\nthis system is now confined by law has been nearly reached, and the\r\nreasons given justify its extension, which is proposed.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, with my approbation, after a sufficient examination, to\r\nbe inexpedient for the Post-Office Department to contract for carrying\r\nour foreign mails under the additional authority given by the last\r\nCongress. The amount limited was inadequate to pay all within the\r\npurview of the law the full rate of 50 cents per mile, and it would have\r\nbeen unjust and unwise to have given it to some and denied it to others.\r\nNor could contracts have been let under the law to all at a rate to have\r\nbrought the aggregate within the appropriation without such practical\r\nprearrangement of terms as would have violated it.\r\n\r\nThe rate of sea and inland postage which was proffered under another\r\nstatute clearly appears to be a fair compensation for the desired\r\nservice, being three times the price necessary to secure transportation\r\nby other vessels upon any route, and much beyond the charges made to\r\nprivate persons for services not less burdensome.\r\n\r\nSome of the steamship companies, upon the refusal of the\r\nPostmaster-General to attempt, by the means provided, the distribution\r\nof the sum appropriated as an extra compensation, withdrew the services\r\nof their vessels and thereby occasioned slight inconvenience, though no\r\nconsiderable injury, the mails having been dispatched by other means.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the policy of subsidizing any line of public\r\nconveyance or travel, I am satisfied that it should not be done under\r\ncover of an expenditure incident to the administration of a Department,\r\nnor should there be any uncertainty as to the recipients of the subsidy\r\nor any discretion left to an executive officer as to its distribution.\r\nIf such gifts of the public money are to be made for the purpose of\r\naiding any enterprise in the supposed interest of the public, I can not\r\nbut think that the amount to be paid and the beneficiary might better be\r\ndetermined by Congress than in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe international congress of delegates from the Postal Union countries\r\nconvened at Lisbon, in Portugal, in February last, and after a session\r\nof some weeks the delegates signed a convention amendatory of the\r\npresent postal-union convention in some particulars designed to advance\r\nits purposes. This additional act has had my approval and will be laid\r\nbefore you with the departmental report.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that another\r\nassistant be provided for his Department. I invite your consideration to\r\nthe several other recommendations contained in his report.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains a history of the conduct of\r\nthe Department of Justice during the last year and a number of valuable\r\nsuggestions as to needed legislation, and I invite your careful\r\nattention to the same.\r\n\r\nThe condition of business in the courts of the United States is such\r\nthat there seems to be an imperative necessity for remedial legislation\r\non the subject. Some of these courts are so overburdened with pending\r\ncauses that the delays in determining litigation amount often to a\r\ndenial of justice. Among the plans suggested for relief is one submitted\r\nby the Attorney-General. Its main features are: The transfer of all the\r\noriginal jurisdiction of the circuit courts to the district courts and\r\nan increase of judges for the latter where necessary; an addition of\r\njudges to the circuit courts, and constituting them exclusively courts\r\nof appeal, and reasonably limiting appeals thereto; further restrictions\r\nof the right to remove causes from the State to Federal courts;\r\npermitting appeals to the Supreme Court from the courts of the District\r\nof Columbia and the Territories only in the same cases as they are\r\nallowed from State courts, and guarding against an unnecessary number of\r\nappeals from the circuit courts.\r\n\r\nI approve the plan thus outlined, and recommend the legislation\r\nnecessary for its application to our judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe present mode of compensating United States marshals and district\r\nattorneys should, in my opinion, be changed. They are allowed to charge\r\nagainst the Government certain fees for services, their income being\r\nmeasured by the amount of such fees within a fixed limit as to their\r\nannual aggregate. This is a direct inducement for them to make their\r\nfees in criminal cases as large as possible in an effort to reach the\r\nmaximum sum permitted. As an entirely natural consequence, unscrupulous\r\nmarshals are found encouraging frivolous prosecutions, arresting people\r\non petty charges of crime and transporting them to distant places for\r\nexamination and trial, for the purpose of earning mileage and other\r\nfees; and district attorneys uselessly attend criminal examinations far\r\nfrom their places of residence for the express purpose of swelling their\r\naccounts against the Government. The actual expenses incurred in these\r\ntransactions are also charged against the Government.\r\n\r\nThus the rights and freedom of our citizens are outraged and public\r\nexpenditures increased for the purpose of furnishing public officers\r\npretexts for increasing the measure of their compensation.\r\n\r\nI think marshals and district attorneys should be paid salaries,\r\nadjusted by a rule which will make them commensurate with services\r\nfairly rendered.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I desire to suggest the advisability,\r\nif it be found not obnoxious to constitutional objection, of investing\r\nUnited States commissioners with the power to try and determine certain\r\nviolations of law within the grade of misdemeanors. Such trials might\r\nbe made to depend upon the option of the accused. The multiplication\r\nof small and technical offenses, especially under the provisions of our\r\ninternal-revenue law, render some change in our present system very\r\ndesirable in the interests of humanity as well as economy. The district\r\ncourts are now crowded with petty prosecutions, involving a punishment\r\nin case of conviction, of only a slight fine, while the parties accused\r\nare harassed by an enforced attendance upon courts held hundreds of\r\nmiles from their homes. If poor and friendless, they are obliged to\r\nremain in jail during months, perhaps, that elapse before a session\r\nof the court is held, and are finally brought to trial surrounded by\r\nstrangers and with but little real opportunity for defense. In the\r\nmeantime frequently the marshal has charged against the Government his\r\nfees for an arrest, the transportation of the accused and the expense\r\nof the same, and for summoning witnesses before a commissioner, a grand\r\njury, and a court; the witnesses have been paid from the public funds\r\nlarge fees and traveling expenses, and the commissioner and district\r\nattorney have also made their charges against the Government.\r\n\r\nThis abuse in the administration of our criminal law should be remedied;\r\nand if the plan above suggested is not practicable, some other should be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, containing an account of\r\nthe operations of this important Department and much interesting\r\ninformation, will be submitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe most intricate and difficult subject in charge of this Department is\r\nthe treatment and management of the Indians. I am satisfied that some\r\nprogress may be noted in their condition as a result of a prudent\r\nadministration of the present laws and regulations for their control.\r\n\r\nBut it is submitted that there is lack of a fixed purpose or policy on\r\nthis subject, which should be supplied. It is useless to dilate upon the\r\nwrongs of the Indians, and as useless to indulge in the heartless belief\r\nthat because their wrongs are revenged in their own atrocious manner,\r\ntherefore they should be exterminated.\r\n\r\nThey are within the care of our Government, and their rights are, or\r\nshould be, protected from invasion by the most solemn obligations. They\r\nare properly enough called the wards of the Government; and it should be\r\nborne in mind that this guardianship involves on our part efforts for\r\nthe improvement of their condition and the enforcement of their rights.\r\nThere seems to be general concurrence in the proposition that the\r\nultimate object of their treatment should be their civilization and\r\ncitizenship. Fitted by these to keep pace in the march of progress with\r\nthe advanced civilization about them, they will readily assimilate with\r\nthe mass of our population, assuming the responsibilities and receiving\r\nthe protection incident to this condition.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty appears to be in the selection of the means to be at\r\npresent employed toward the attainment of this result.\r\n\r\nOur Indian population, exclusive of those in Alaska, is reported as\r\nnumbering 260,000, nearly all being located on lands set apart for their\r\nuse and occupation, aggregating over 134,000,000 acres. These lands are\r\nincluded in the boundaries of 171 reservations of different dimensions,\r\nscattered in 21 States and Territories, presenting great variations in\r\nclimate and in the kind and quality of their soils. Among the Indians\r\nupon these several reservations there exist the most marked differences\r\nin natural traits and disposition and in their progress toward\r\ncivilization. While some are lazy, vicious, and stupid, others are\r\nindustrious, peaceful, and intelligent; while a portion of them are\r\nself-supporting and independent, and have so far advanced in\r\ncivilization that they make their own laws, administered through\r\nofficers of their own choice, and educate their children in schools of\r\ntheir own establishment and maintenance, others still retain, in squalor\r\nand dependence, almost the savagery of their natural state.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this question the desires manifested by the Indians\r\nshould not be ignored. Here again we find a great diversity. With some\r\nthe tribal relation is cherished with the utmost tenacity, while its\r\nhold upon others is considerably relaxed; the love of home is strong\r\nwith all, and yet there are those whose attachment to a particular\r\nlocality is by no means unyielding; the ownership of their lands in\r\nseveralty is much desired by some, while by others, and sometimes among\r\nthe most civilized, such a distribution would be bitterly opposed.\r\n\r\nThe variation of their wants, growing out of and connected with the\r\ncharacter of their several locations, should be regarded. Some are upon\r\nreservations most fit for grazing, but without flocks or herds; and\r\nsome, on arable land, have no agricultural implements. While some of the\r\nreservations are double the size necessary to maintain the number of\r\nIndians now upon them, in a few cases, perhaps, they should be enlarged.\r\n\r\nAdd to all this the difference in the administration of the agencies.\r\nWhile the same duties are devolved upon all, the disposition of the\r\nagents and the manner of their contact with the Indians have much to do\r\nwith their condition and welfare. The agent who perfunctorily performs\r\nhis duty and slothfully neglects all opportunity to advance their moral\r\nand physical improvement and fails to inspire them with a desire for\r\nbetter things will accomplish nothing in the direction of their\r\ncivilization, while he who feels the burden of an important trust and\r\nhas an interest in his work will, by consistent example, firm yet\r\nconsiderate treatment, and well-directed aid and encouragement,\r\nconstantly lead those under his charge toward the light of their\r\nenfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe history of all the progress which has been made in the civilization\r\nof the Indian I think will disclose the fact that the beginning has been\r\nreligious teaching, followed by or accompanying secular education. While\r\nthe self-sacrificing and pious men and women who have aided in this good\r\nwork by their independent endeavor have for their reward the beneficent\r\nresults of their labor and the consciousness of Christian duty well\r\nperformed, their valuable services should be fully acknowledged by all\r\nwho under the law are charged with the control and management of our\r\nIndian wards.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said indicates that in the present condition of the\r\nIndians no attempt should be made to apply a fixed and unyielding plan\r\nof action to their varied and varying needs and circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Bureau, burdened as it is with their general oversight and\r\nwith the details of the establishment, can hardly possess itself of the\r\nminute phases of the particular cases needing treatment; and thus the\r\npropriety of creating an instrumentality auxiliary to those already\r\nestablished for the care of the Indians suggests itself.\r\n\r\nI recommend the passage of a law authorizing the appointment of six\r\ncommissioners, three of whom shall be detailed from the Army, to be\r\ncharged with the duty of a careful inspection from time to time of all\r\nthe Indians upon our reservations or subject to the care and control\r\nof the Government, with a view of discovering their exact condition\r\nand needs and determining what steps shall be taken on behalf of the\r\nGovernment to improve their situation in the direction of their\r\nself-support and complete civilization; that they ascertain from such\r\ninspection what, if any, of the reservations may be reduced in area,\r\nand in such cases what part not needed for Indian occupation may be\r\npurchased by the Government from the Indians and disposed of for their\r\nbenefit; what, if any, Indians may, with their consent, be removed to\r\nother reservations, with a view of their concentration and the sale on\r\ntheir behalf of their abandoned reservations; what Indian lands now\r\nheld in common should be allotted in severalty; in what manner and to\r\nwhat extent the Indians upon the reservations can be placed under the\r\nprotection of our laws and subjected to their penalties, and which,\r\nif any, Indians should be invested with the right of citizenship. The\r\npowers and functions of the commissioners in regard to these subjects\r\nshould be clearly defined, though they should, in conjunction with the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, be given all the authority to deal definitely\r\nwith the questions presented deemed safe and consistent.\r\n\r\nThey should be also charged with the duty of ascertaining the Indians\r\nwho might properly be furnished with implements of agriculture, and\r\nof what kind; in what cases the support of the Government should be\r\nwithdrawn; where the present plan of distributing Indian supplies should\r\nbe changed; where schools may be established and where discontinued;\r\nthe conduct, methods, and fitness of agents in charge of reservations;\r\nthe extent to which such reservations are occupied or intruded upon by\r\nunauthorized persons, and generally all matters related to the welfare\r\nand improvement of the Indian.\r\n\r\nThey should advise with the Secretary of the Interior concerning these\r\nmatters of detail in management, and he should be given power to deal\r\nwith them fully, if he is not now invested with such power.\r\n\r\nThis plan contemplates the selection of persons for commissioners who\r\nare interested in the Indian question and who have practical ideas upon\r\nthe subject of their treatment.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the Indian Bureau during the last fiscal year was more\r\nthan six and a half million dollars. I believe much of this expenditure\r\nmight be saved under the plan proposed; that its economical effects\r\nwould be increased with its continuance; that the safety of our frontier\r\nsettlers would be subserved under its operation, and that the nation\r\nwould be saved through its results from the imputation of inhumanity,\r\ninjustice, and mismanagement.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the policy of allotment of Indian lands in\r\nseveralty, when deemed expedient, it will be necessary to have surveys\r\ncompleted of the reservations, and I hope that provision will be made\r\nfor the prosecution of this work.\r\n\r\nIn May of the present year a small portion of the Chiricahua Apaches on\r\nthe White Mountain Reservation, in Arizona, left the reservation and\r\ncommitted a number of murders and depredations upon settlers in that\r\nneighborhood. Though prompt and energetic action was taken by the\r\nmilitary, the renegades eluded capture and escaped into Mexico. The\r\nformation of the country through which these Indians passed, their\r\nthorough acquaintance with the same, the speed of their escape, and\r\nthe manner in which they scattered and concealed themselves among the\r\nmountains near the scene of their outrages put our soldiers at a great\r\ndisadvantage in their efforts to capture them, though the expectation is\r\nstill entertained that they will be ultimately taken and punished for\r\ntheir crimes.\r\n\r\nThe threatening and disorderly conduct of the Cheyennes in the Indian\r\nTerritory early last summer caused considerable alarm and uneasiness.\r\nInvestigation proved that their threatening attitude was due in a great\r\nmeasure to the occupation of the land of their reservation by immense\r\nherds of cattle, which their owners claimed were rightfully there under\r\ncertain leases made by the Indians. Such occupation appearing upon\r\nexamination to be unlawful notwithstanding these leases, the intruders\r\nwere ordered to remove with their cattle from the lands of the Indians\r\nby Executive proclamation.[3] The enforcement of this proclamation had\r\nthe effect of restoring peace and order among the Indians, and they are\r\nnow quiet and well behaved.\r\n\r\nBy an Executive order issued on February 27, 1885, by my predecessor,\r\na portion of the tract of country in the territory known as the Old\r\nWinnebago and Crow Creek reservations was directed to be restored to\r\nthe public domain and opened to settlement under the land laws of the\r\nUnited States, and a large number of persons entered upon those lands.\r\nThis action alarmed the Sioux Indians, who claimed the territory as\r\nbelonging to their reservation under the treaty of 1868. This claim\r\nwas determined, after careful investigation, to be well founded, and\r\nconsequently the Executive order referred to was by proclamation of\r\nApril 17, 1885,[4] declared to be inoperative and of no effect, and\r\nall persons upon the land were warned to leave. This warning has been\r\nsubstantially complied with.\r\n\r\nThe public domain had its origin in cessions of land by the States to\r\nthe General Government. The first cession was made by the State of New\r\nYork, and the largest, which in area exceeded all the others, by the\r\nState of Virginia. The territory the proprietorship of which became\r\nthus vested in the General Government extended from the western line of\r\nPennsylvania to the Mississippi River. These patriotic donations of the\r\nStates were encumbered with no condition except that they should be held\r\nand used \"for the common benefit of the United States.\" By purchase with\r\nthe common fund of all the people additions were made to this domain\r\nuntil it extended to the northern line of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, and\r\nthe Polar Sea. The original trust, \"for the common benefit of the United\r\nStates,\" attached to all. In the execution of that trust the policy of\r\nmany homes, rather than large estates, was adopted by the Government.\r\nThat these might be easily obtained, and be the abode of security and\r\ncontentment, the laws for their acquisition were few, easily understood,\r\nand general in their character. But the pressure of local interests,\r\ncombined with a speculative spirit, have in many instances procured\r\nthe passage of laws which marred the harmony of the general plan and\r\nencumbered the system with a multitude of general and special enactments\r\nwhich render the land laws complicated, subject the titles to\r\nuncertainty, and the purchasers often to oppression and wrong. Laws\r\nwhich were intended for the \"common benefit\" have been perverted so\r\nthat large quantities of land are vesting in single ownerships. From\r\nthe multitude and character of the laws, this consequence seems incapable\r\nof correction by mere administration.\r\n\r\nIt is not for the \"common benefit of the United States\" that a large\r\narea of the public lands should be acquired, directly or through fraud,\r\nin the hands of a single individual. The nation's strength is in the\r\npeople. The nation's prosperity is in their prosperity. The nation's\r\nglory is in the equality of her justice. The nation's perpetuity is in\r\nthe patriotism of all her people. Hence, as far as practicable, the plan\r\nadopted in the disposal of the public lands should have in view the\r\noriginal policy, which encouraged many purchasers of these lands for\r\nhomes and discouraged the massing of large areas. Exclusive of Alaska,\r\nabout three-fifths of the national domain has been sold or subjected to\r\ncontract or grant. Of the remaining two-fifths a considerable portion is\r\neither mountain or desert. A rapidly increasing population creates a\r\ngrowing demand for homes, and the accumulation of wealth inspires an\r\neager competition to obtain the public land for speculative purposes.\r\nIn the future this collision of interests will be more marked than in\r\nthe past, and the execution of the nation's trust in behalf of our\r\nsettlers will be more difficult. I therefore commend to your attention\r\nthe recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior with reference to the repeal and modification of certain of our\r\nland laws.\r\n\r\nThe nation has made princely grants and subsidies to a system of\r\nrailroads projected as great national highways to connect the Pacific\r\nStates with the East. It has been charged that these donations from the\r\npeople have been diverted to private gain and corrupt uses, and thus\r\npublic indignation has been aroused and suspicion engendered. Our great\r\nnation does not begrudge its generosity, but it abhors peculation and\r\nfraud; and the favorable regard of our people for the great corporations\r\nto which these grants were made can only be revived by a restoration of\r\nconfidence, to be secured by their constant, unequivocal, and clearly\r\nmanifested integrity. A faithful application of the undiminished\r\nproceeds of the grants to the construction and perfecting of their\r\nroads, an honest discharge of their obligations, and entire justice to\r\nall the people in the enjoyment of their rights on these highways of\r\ntravel are all the public asks, and it will be content with no less. To\r\nsecure these things should be the common purpose of the officers of the\r\nGovernment, as well as of the corporations. With this accomplishment\r\nprosperity would be permanently secured to the roads, and national pride\r\nwould take the place of national complaint.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Commissioner of Pensions that there\r\nwere on the 1st day of July, 1885, 345,125 persons borne upon the\r\npension rolls, who were classified as follows: Army invalids, 241,456;\r\nwidows, minor children, and dependent relatives of deceased soldiers,\r\n78,841; navy invalids, 2,745; navy widows, minor children, and\r\ndependents, 1,926; survivors of the War of 1812, 2,945; and widows of\r\nthose who served in that war, 17,212. About one man in ten of all those\r\nwho enlisted in the late war are reported as receiving pensions,\r\nexclusive of the dependents of deceased soldiers. On the 1st of July,\r\n1875, the number of pensioners was 234,821, and the increase within the\r\nten years next thereafter was 110,304.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no expenditure of the public funds which the people more\r\ncheerfully approve than that made in recognition of the services of our\r\nsoldiers living and dead, the sentiment underlying the subject should\r\nnot be vitiated by the introduction of any fraudulent practices.\r\nTherefore it is fully as important that the rolls should be cleansed of\r\nall those who by fraud have secured a place thereon as that meritorious\r\nclaims should be speedily examined and adjusted. The reforms in the\r\nmethods of doing the business of this Bureau which have lately been\r\ninaugurated promise better results in both these directions.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Patent Office demonstrate the activity of the\r\ninventive genius of the country. For the year ended June 30, 1885, the\r\napplications for patents, including reissues, and for the registration\r\nof trade-marks and labels, numbered 35,688. During the same period there\r\nwere 22,928 patents granted and reissued and 1,429 trade-marks and\r\nlabels registered. The number of patents issued in the year 1875 was\r\n14,387. The receipts during the last fiscal year were $1,074,974.35, and\r\nthe total expenditures, not including contingent expenses, $934,123.11.\r\n\r\nThere were 9,788 applications for patents pending on the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1884, and 5,786 on the same date in the year 1885. There has been\r\nconsiderable improvement made in the prompt determination of\r\napplications and a consequent relief to expectant inventors.\r\n\r\nA number of suggestions and recommendations are contained in the report\r\nof the Commissioner of Patents which are well entitled to the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Utah the law of the United States passed for the\r\nsuppression of polygamy has been energetically and faithfully executed\r\nduring the past year, with measurably good results. A number of\r\nconvictions have been secured for unlawful cohabitation, and in some\r\ncases pleas of guilty have been entered and a slight punishment imposed,\r\nupon a promise by the accused that they would not again offend against\r\nthe law, nor advise, counsel, aid, or abet in any way its violation by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Utah commissioners express the opinion, based upon such information\r\nas they are able to obtain, that but few polygamous marriages have taken\r\nplace in the Territory during the last year. They further report that\r\nwhile there can not be found upon the registration lists of voters the\r\nname of a man actually guilty of polygamy, and while none of that class\r\nare holding office, yet at the last election in the Territory all the\r\nofficers elected, except in one county, were men who, though not\r\nactually living in the practice of polygamy, subscribe to the doctrine\r\nof polygamous marriages as a divine revelation and a law unto all\r\nhigher and more binding upon the conscience than any human law, local\r\nor national. Thus is the strange spectacle presented of a community\r\nprotected by a republican form of government, to which they owe\r\nallegiance, sustaining by their suffrages a principle and a belief which\r\nset at naught that obligation of absolute obedience to the law of the\r\nland which lies at the foundation of republican institutions.\r\n\r\nThe strength, the perpetuity, and the destiny of the nation rest upon\r\nour homes, established by the law of God, guarded by parental care,\r\nregulated by parental authority, and sanctified by parental love.\r\n\r\nThese are not the homes of polygamy.\r\n\r\nThe mothers of our land, who rule the nation as they mold the characters\r\nand guide the actions of their sons, live according to God's holy\r\nordinances, and each, secure and happy in the exclusive love of the\r\nfather of her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood,\r\nunperverted and unpolluted, upon all within her pure and wholesome\r\nfamily circle.\r\n\r\nThese are not the cheerless, crushed, and unwomanly mothers of polygamy.\r\n\r\nThe fathers of our families are the best citizens of the Republic. Wife\r\nand children are the sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental\r\naffection beget devotion to the country. The man who, undefiled with\r\nplural marriage, is surrounded in his single home with his wife and\r\nchildren has a stake in the country which inspires him with respect for\r\nits laws and courage for its defense.\r\n\r\nThese are not the fathers of polygamous families.\r\n\r\nThere is no feature of this practice or the system which sanctions it\r\nwhich is not opposed to all that is of value in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThere should be no relaxation in the firm but just execution of the law\r\nnow in operation, and I should be glad to approve such further discreet\r\nlegislation as will rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame.\r\n\r\nSince the people upholding polygamy in our Territories are reenforced\r\nby immigration from other lands, I recommend that a law be passed to\r\nprevent the importation of Mormons into the country.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural interest of the country demands just recognition and\r\nliberal encouragement. It sustains with certainty and unfailing strength\r\nour nation's prosperity by the products of its steady toil, and bears\r\nits full share of the burden of taxation without complaint. Our\r\nagriculturists have but slight personal representation in the councils\r\nof the nation, and are generally content with the humbler duties of\r\ncitizenship and willing to trust to the bounty of nature for a reward of\r\ntheir labor. But the magnitude and value of this industry are\r\nappreciated when the statement is made that of our total annual exports\r\nmore than three-fourths are the products of agriculture, and of our\r\ntotal population nearly one-half are exclusively engaged in that\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture was created for the purpose of\r\nacquiring and diffusing among the people useful information respecting\r\nthe subjects it has in charge, and aiding in the cause of intelligent\r\nand progressive farming, by the collection of statistics, by testing\r\nthe value and usefulness of new seeds and plants, and distributing\r\nsuch as are found desirable among agriculturists. This and other\r\npowers and duties with which this Department is invested are of the\r\nutmost importance, and if wisely exercised must be of great benefit to\r\nthe country. The aim of our beneficent Government is the improvement of\r\nthe people in every station and the amelioration of their condition.\r\nSurely our agriculturists should not be neglected. The instrumentality\r\nestablished in aid of the farmers of the land should not only be well\r\nequipped for the accomplishment of its purpose, but those for whose\r\nbenefit it has been adopted should be encouraged to avail themselves\r\nfully of its advantages.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the importation into several countries of certain of\r\nour animals and their products, based upon the suspicion that health is\r\nendangered in their use and consumption, suggests the importance of such\r\nprecautions for the protection of our stock of all kinds against disease\r\nas will disarm suspicion of danger and cause the removal of such an\r\ninjurious prohibition.\r\n\r\nIf the laws now in operation are insufficient to accomplish this\r\nprotection, I recommend their amendment to meet the necessities of\r\nthe situation; and I commend to the consideration of Congress the\r\nsuggestions contained in the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture\r\ncalculated to increase the value and efficiency of this Department.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Civil Service Commission, which will be submitted,\r\ncontains an account of the manner in which the civil-service law has\r\nbeen executed during the last year and much valuable information on this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that there is no sentiment more general in the\r\nminds of the people of our country than a conviction of the correctness\r\nof the principle upon which the law enforcing civil-service reform is\r\nbased. In its present condition the law regulates only a part of the\r\nsubordinate public positions throughout the country. It applies the test\r\nof fitness to applicants for these places by means of a competitive\r\nexamination, and gives large discretion to the Commissioners as to the\r\ncharacter of the examination and many other matters connected with its\r\nexecution. Thus the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission have\r\nmuch to do with the practical usefulness of the statute and with the\r\nresults of its application.\r\n\r\nThe people may well trust the Commission to execute the law with perfect\r\nfairness and with as little irritation as is possible. But of course no\r\nrelaxation of the principle which underlies it and no weakening of the\r\nsafeguards which surround it can be expected. Experience in its\r\nadministration will probably suggest amendment of the methods of its\r\nexecution, but I venture to hope that we shall never again be remitted\r\nto the system which distributes public positions purely as rewards for\r\npartisan service. Doubts may well be entertained whether our Government\r\ncould survive the strain of a continuance of this system, which upon\r\nevery change of Administration inspires an immense army of claimants for\r\noffice to lay siege to the patronage of Government, engrossing the time\r\nof public officers with their importunities, spreading abroad the\r\ncontagion of their disappointment, and filling the air with the tumult\r\nof their discontent.\r\n\r\nThe allurements of an immense number of offices and places exhibited to\r\nthe voters of the land, and the promise of their bestowal in recognition\r\nof partisan activity, debauch the suffrage and rob political action of\r\nits thoughtful and deliberative character. The evil would increase with\r\nthe multiplication of offices consequent upon our extension, and the\r\nmania for office holding, growing from its indulgence, would pervade\r\nour population so generally that patriotic purpose, the support of\r\nprinciple, the desire for the public good, and solicitude for the\r\nnation's welfare would be nearly banished from the activity of our\r\nparty contests and cause them to degenerate into ignoble, selfish, and\r\ndisgraceful struggles for the possession of office and public place.\r\n\r\nCivil-service reform enforced by law came none too soon to check the\r\nprogress of demoralization.\r\n\r\nOne of its effects, not enough regarded, is the freedom it brings to the\r\npolitical action of those conservative and sober men who, in fear of the\r\nconfusion and risk attending an arbitrary and sudden change in all the\r\npublic offices with a change of party rule, cast their ballots against\r\nsuch a chance.\r\n\r\nParties seem to be necessary, and will long continue to exist; nor can\r\nit be now denied that there are legitimate advantages, not disconnected\r\nwith office holding, which follow party supremacy. While partisanship\r\ncontinues bitter and pronounced and supplies so much of motive to\r\nsentiment and action, it is not fair to hold public officials in charge\r\nof important trusts responsible for the best results in the performance\r\nof their duties, and yet insist that they shall rely in confidential and\r\nimportant places upon the work of those not only opposed to them in\r\npolitical affiliation, but so steeped in partisan prejudice and rancor\r\nthat they have no loyalty to their chiefs and no desire for their\r\nsuccess. Civil-service reform does not exact this, nor does it require\r\nthat those in subordinate positions who fail in yielding their best\r\nservice or who are incompetent should be retained simply because they\r\nare in place. The whining of a clerk discharged for indolence or\r\nincompetency, who, though he gained his place by the worst possible\r\noperation of the spoils system, suddenly discovers that he is entitled\r\nto protection under the sanction of civil-service reform, represents an\r\nidea no less absurd than the clamor of the applicant who claims the\r\nvacant position as his compensation for the most questionable party\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe civil-service law does not prevent the discharge of the indolent\r\nor incompetent clerk, but it does prevent supplying his place with the\r\nunfit party worker. Thus in both these phases is seen benefit to the\r\npublic service. And the people who desire good government, having\r\nsecured this statute, will not relinquish its benefits without protest.\r\nNor are they unmindful of the fact that its full advantages can only be\r\ngained through the complete good faith of those having its execution in\r\ncharge. And this they will insist upon.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the salaries of the Civil Service Commissioners be\r\nincreased to a sum more nearly commensurate to their important duties.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of considerable and not unnatural discontent that no\r\nadequate provision has yet been made for accommodating the principal\r\nlibrary of the Government. Of the vast collection of books and\r\npamphlets gathered at the Capitol, numbering some 700,000, exclusive of\r\nmanuscripts, maps, and the products of the graphic arts, also of great\r\nvolume and value, only about 300,000 volumes, or less than half the\r\ncollection, are provided with shelf room. The others, which are\r\nincreasing at the rate of from twenty-five to thirty thousand volumes\r\na year, are not only inaccessible to the public, but are subject to\r\nserious damage and deterioration from other causes in their present\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the facts that the library of the Capitol has twice\r\nbeen destroyed or damaged by fire, its daily increasing value, and its\r\nimportance as a place of deposit of books under the law relating to\r\ncopyright makes manifest the necessity of prompt action to insure its\r\nproper accommodation and protection.\r\n\r\nMy attention has been called to a controversy which has arisen from the\r\ncondition of the law relating to railroad facilities in the city of\r\nWashington, which has involved the Commissioners of the District in much\r\nannoyance and trouble. I hope this difficulty will be promptly settled\r\nby appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners represent that enough of the revenues of the District\r\nare now on deposit in the Treasury of the United States to repay the sum\r\nadvanced by the Government for sewer improvements under the act of June\r\n30, 1884. They desire now an advance of the share which ultimately\r\nshould be borne by the District of the cost of extensive improvements\r\nto the streets of the city. The total expense of these contemplated\r\nimprovements is estimated at $1,000,000, and they are of the opinion\r\nthat a considerable sum could be saved if they had all the money in\r\nhand, so that contracts for the whole work could be made at the same\r\ntime. They express confidence that if the advance asked for should be\r\nmade the Government would be reimbursed the same within a reasonable\r\ntime. I have no doubt that these improvements could be made much cheaper\r\nif undertaken together and prosecuted according to a general plan.\r\n\r\nThe license law now in force within the District is deficient and\r\nuncertain in some of its provisions and ought to be amended. The\r\nCommissioners urge, with good reason, the necessity of providing a\r\nbuilding for the use of the District government which shall better\r\nsecure the safety and preservation of its valuable books and records.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the law relating to the succession to the\r\nPresidency in the event of the death, disability, or removal of both the\r\nPresident and Vice-President is such as to require immediate amendment.\r\nThis subject has repeatedly been considered by Congress, but no result\r\nhas been reached. The recent lamentable death of the Vice-President, and\r\nvacancies at the same time in all other offices the incumbents of which\r\nmight immediately exercise the functions of the Presidential office, has\r\ncaused public anxiety and a just demand that a recurrence of such a\r\ncondition of affairs should not be permitted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of\r\nCongress the needs, the welfare, and the aspirations of an intelligent\r\nand generous nation. To subordinate these to the narrow advantages of\r\npartisanship or the accomplishment of selfish aims is to violate the\r\npeople's trust and betray the people's interests; but an individual\r\nsense of responsibility on the part of each of us and a stern\r\ndetermination to perform our duty well must give us place among those\r\nwho have added in their day and generation to the glory and prosperity\r\nof our beloved land.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See pp. 303-304.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See pp. 224-225.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See pp. 305-307.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 14, 1885_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 9th instant, calling\r\nfor the correspondence on file in relation to the appointment of Mr.\r\nA.M.

the United\r\nStates of Mexico, touching the boundary line between the two countries\r\nwhere it follows the bed of the Rio Grande and the Rio Gila.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications could not, however, be

Romero, \"since they consist mainly in the\r\nrectification of the mistake made when the Gila River was mentioned as a\r\npart of the boundary line, the Colorado River being omitted, and in the\r\ncorrection of an error in the Spanish translation.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Senate may have the matter fully before it, I herewith transmit\r\na copy of Mr. Romero's note of December 26, 1885, with

present session of the Senate the\r\ndifferent heads of the Departments attached to the executive branch of\r\nthe Government have been plied with various requests and demands from\r\ncommittees of the Senate, from members of such committees, and at last\r\nfrom the Senate itself, requiring the transmission of reasons for the\r\nsuspension of certain officials during the recess of that body, or for\r\nthe papers touching the conduct of such officials, or for all papers and\r\ndocuments relating to such suspensions, or for all documents and papers\r\nfiled in such Departments in relation to the management and conduct of\r\nthe offices held by such suspended officials.\r\n\r\nThe different terms from time to time adopted in making these requests\r\nand demands, the order in which they succeeded each other, and the fact\r\nthat when made by the Senate the resolution for that purpose was passed\r\nin executive session have led to the presumption, the correctness of\r\nwhich will, I suppose, be candidly admitted, that from first to last the\r\ninformation thus sought and the papers thus demanded were desired for\r\nuse by the Senate and its committees in considering the propriety of the\r\nsuspensions referred to.\r\n\r\nThough these suspensions are my executive acts, based upon considerations\r\naddressed to me alone and for which I am wholly responsible, I have had\r\nno invitation from the Senate to state the position which I have felt\r\nconstrained to assume in relation to the same or to interpret for myself\r\nmy acts and motives in the premises.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs I have forborne addressing the Senate upon\r\nthe subject, lest I might be accused of thrusting myself unbidden upon\r\nthe attention of that body.\r\n\r\nBut the report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate lately\r\npresented and published, which censures the Attorney-General of the\r\nUnited States for his refusal to transmit certain papers relating to a\r\nsuspension from office, and which also, if I correctly interpret it,\r\nevinces a misapprehension of the position of the Executive upon the\r\nquestion of such suspensions, will, I hope, justify this communication.\r\n\r\nThis report is predicated upon a resolution of the Senate directed to\r\nthe Attorney-General and his reply to the same. This resolution was\r\nadopted in executive session devoted entirely to business connected\r\nwith the consideration of nominations for office. It required the\r\nAttorney-General \"to transmit to the Senate copies of all documents and\r\npapers that have been filed in the Department of Justice since the 1st\r\nday of January, 1885, in relation to the management and conduct of the\r\noffice of district attorney of the United States for the southern\r\ndistrict of Alabama.\"\r\n\r\nThe incumbent of this office on the 1st day of January, 1885, and until\r\nthe 17th day of July ensuing, was George M. Duskin, who on the day last\r\nmentioned was suspended by an Executive order, and John D. Burnett\r\ndesignated to perform the duties of said office. At the time of the\r\npassage of the resolution above referred to the nomination of Burnett\r\nfor said office was pending before the Senate, and all the papers\r\nrelating to said nomination were before that body for its inspection and\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this resolution the Attorney-General, after referring to the\r\nfact that the papers relating to the nomination of Burnett had already\r\nbeen sent to the Senate, stated that he was directed by the President to\r\nsay that--\r\n\r\n  The papers and documents which are mentioned in said resolution and\r\n  still remaining in the custody of this Department, having exclusive\r\n  reference to the suspension by the President of George M. Duskin, the\r\n  late incumbent of the office of district attorney for the southern\r\n  district of Alabama, it is not considered that the public interests will\r\n  be promoted by a compliance with said resolution and the transmission of\r\n  the papers and documents therein mentioned to the Senate in executive\r\n  session.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this resolution and the answer thereto the issue is thus stated by\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary at the outset of the report:\r\n\r\n  The important question, then, is whether it is within the constitutional\r\n  competence of either House of Congress to have access to the official\r\n  papers and documents in the various public offices of the United States\r\n  created by laws enacted by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that \"the public offices of the United States\" are\r\nregulated or controlled in their relations to either House of Congress\r\nby the fact that they were \"created by laws enacted by themselves.\"\r\nIt must be that these instrumentalities were created for the benefit of\r\nthe people and to answer the general purposes of government under the\r\nConstitution and the laws, and that they are unencumbered by any lien in\r\nfavor of either branch of Congress growing out of their construction,\r\nand unembarrassed by any obligation to the Senate as the price of their\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThe complaint of the committee that access to official papers in the\r\npublic offices is denied the Senate is met by the statement that at no\r\ntime has it been the disposition or the intention of the President or\r\nany Department of the executive branch of the Government to withhold\r\nfrom the Senate official documents or papers filed in any of the public\r\noffices. While it is by no means conceded that the Senate has the right\r\nin any case to review the act of the Executive in removing or suspending\r\na public officer, upon official documents or otherwise, it is considered\r\nthat documents and papers of that nature should, because they are\r\nofficial, be freely transmitted to the Senate upon its demand, trusting\r\nthe use of the same for proper and legitimate purposes to the good faith\r\nof that body; and though no such paper or document has been specifically\r\ndemanded in any of the numerous requests and demands made upon the\r\nDepartments, yet as often as they were found in the public offices they\r\nhave been furnished in answer to such applications.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the Attorney-General in response to the resolution of the\r\nSenate in the particular case mentioned in the committee's report was\r\nwritten at my suggestion and by my direction. There had been no official\r\npapers or documents filed in his Department relating to the case within\r\nthe period specified in the resolution. The letter was intended, by its\r\ndescription of the papers and documents remaining in the custody of the\r\nDepartment, to convey the idea that they were not official; and it was\r\nassumed that the resolution called for information, papers, and\r\ndocuments of the same character as were required by the requests and\r\ndemands which preceded it.\r\n\r\nEverything that had been written or done on behalf of the Senate\r\nfrom the beginning pointed to all letters and papers of a private and\r\nunofficial nature as the objects of search, if they were to be found in\r\nthe Departments, and provided they had been presented to the Executive\r\nwith a view to their consideration upon the question of suspension from\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAgainst the transmission of such papers and documents I have\r\ninterposed my advice and direction. This has not been done, as is\r\nsuggested in the committee's report, upon the assumption on my part that\r\nthe Attorney-General or any other head of a Department \"is the servant\r\nof the President, and is to give or withhold copies of documents in his\r\noffice according to the will of the Executive and not otherwise,\" but\r\nbecause I regard the papers and documents withheld and addressed to me\r\nor intended for my use and action purely unofficial and private, not\r\ninfrequently confidential, and having reference to the performance of a\r\nduty exclusively mine. I consider them in no proper sense as upon the\r\nfiles of the Department, but as deposited there for my convenience,\r\nremaining still completely under my control. I suppose if I desired to\r\ntake them into my custody I might do so with entire propriety, and if\r\nI saw fit to destroy them no one could complain.\r\n\r\nEven the committee in its report appears to concede that there may be\r\nwith the President or in the Departments papers and documents which, on\r\naccount of their unofficial character, are not subject to the inspection\r\nof the Congress. A reference in the report to instances where the House\r\nof Representatives ought not to succeed in a call for the production of\r\npapers is immediately followed by this statement:\r\n\r\n  The committee feels authorized to state, after a somewhat careful\r\n  research, that within the foregoing limits there is scarcely in the\r\n  history of this Government, until now, any instance of a refusal by a\r\n  head of a Department, or even of the President himself, to communicate\r\n  official facts and information, as distinguished from private and\r\n  unofficial papers, motions, views, reasons, and opinions, to either\r\n  House of Congress when unconditionally demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which of the classes thus recognized do the papers and documents\r\nbelong that are now the objects of the Senate's quest?\r\n\r\nThey consist of letters and representations addressed to the Executive\r\nor intended for his inspection; they are voluntarily written and\r\npresented by private citizens who are not in the least instigated\r\nthereto by any official invitation or at all subject to official\r\ncontrol. While some of them are entitled to Executive consideration,\r\nmany of them are so irrelevant, or in the light of other facts so\r\nworthless, that they have not been given the least weight in determining\r\nthe question to which they are supposed to relate.\r\n\r\nAre all these, simply because they are preserved, to be considered\r\nofficial documents and subject to the inspection of the Senate? If not,\r\nwho is to determine which belong to this class? Are the motives and\r\npurposes of the Senate, as they are day by day developed, such as would\r\nbe satisfied with my selection? Am I to submit to theirs at the risk of\r\nbeing charged with making a suspension from office upon evidence which\r\nwas not even considered?\r\n\r\nAre these papers to be regarded official because they have not only been\r\npresented but preserved in the public offices?\r\n\r\nTheir nature and character remain the same whether they are kept\r\nin the Executive Mansion or deposited in the Departments. There is no\r\nmysterious power of transmutation in departmental custody, nor is there\r\nmagic in the undefined and sacred solemnity of Department files. If the\r\npresence of these papers in the public offices is a stumbling block in\r\nthe way of the performance of Senatorial duty, it can be easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe papers and documents which have been described derive no official\r\ncharacter from any constitutional, statutory, or other requirement\r\nmaking them necessary to the performance of the official duty of the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied, I suppose, that the President may suspend a\r\npublic officer in the entire absence of any papers or documents to\r\naid his official judgment and discretion; and I am quite prepared to\r\navow that the cases are not few in which suspensions from office have\r\ndepended more upon oral representations made to me by citizens of known\r\ngood repute and by members of the House of Representatives and Senators\r\nof the United States than upon any letters and documents presented for\r\nmy examination. I have not felt justified in suspecting the veracity,\r\nintegrity, and patriotism of Senators, or ignoring their\r\nrepresentations, because they were not in party affiliation with the\r\nmajority of their associates; and I recall a few suspensions which bear\r\nthe approval of individual members identified politically with the\r\nmajority in the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, I am constrained to deny the right of the Senate to\r\nthe papers and documents described, so far as the right to the same is\r\nbased upon the claim that they are in any view of the subject official,\r\nI am also led unequivocally to dispute the right of the Senate by the\r\naid of any documents whatever, or in any way save through the judicial\r\nprocess of trial on impeachment, to review or reverse the acts of the\r\nExecutive in the suspension, during the recess of the Senate, of Federal\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nI believe the power to remove or suspend such officials is vested in the\r\nPresident alone by the Constitution, which in express terms provides\r\nthat \"the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United\r\nStates of America,\" and that \"he shall take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate belongs to the legislative branch of the Government. When the\r\nConstitution by express provision superadded to its legislative duties\r\nthe right to advise and consent to appointments to office and to sit as\r\na court of impeachment, it conferred upon that body all the control and\r\nregulation of Executive action supposed to be necessary for the safety\r\nof the people; and this express and special grant of such extraordinary\r\npowers, not in any way related to or growing out of general Senatorial\r\nduty, and in itself a departure from the general plan of our Government,\r\nshould be held, under a familiar maxim of construction, to exclude every\r\nother right of interference with Executive functions.\r\n\r\nIn the first Congress which assembled after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, comprising many who aided in its preparation, a\r\nlegislative construction was given to that instrument in which the\r\nindependence of the Executive in the matter of removals from office was\r\nfully sustained.\r\n\r\nI think it will be found that in the subsequent discussions of this\r\nquestion there was generally, if not at all times, a proposition pending\r\nto in some way curtail this power of the President by legislation, which\r\nfurnishes evidence that to limit such power it was supposed to be\r\nnecessary to supplement the Constitution by such legislation.\r\n\r\nThe first enactment of this description was passed under a stress of\r\npartisanship and political bitterness which culminated in the\r\nPresident's impeachment.\r\n\r\nThis law provided that the Federal officers to which it applied could\r\nonly be suspended during the recess of the Senate when shown by evidence\r\nsatisfactory to the President to be guilty of misconduct in office, or\r\ncrime, or when incapable or disqualified to perform their duties, and\r\nthat within twenty days after the next meeting of the Senate it should\r\nbe the duty of the President \"to report to the Senate such suspension,\r\nwith the evidence and reasons for his action in the case.\"\r\n\r\nThis statute, passed in 1867, when Congress was overwhelmingly and\r\nbitterly opposed politically to the President, may be regarded as\r\nan indication that even then it was thought necessary by a Congress\r\ndetermined upon the subjugation of the Executive to legislative will to\r\nfurnish itself a law for that purpose, instead of attempting to reach\r\nthe object intended by an invocation of any pretended constitutional\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe law which thus found its way to our statute book was plain in its\r\nterms, and its intent needed no avowal. If valid and now in operation,\r\nit would justify the present course of the Senate and command the\r\nobedience of the Executive to its demands. It may, however, be remarked\r\nin passing that under this law the President had the privilege of\r\npresenting to the body which assumed to review his executive acts his\r\nreasons therefor, instead of being excluded from explanation or judged\r\nby papers found in the Departments.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the law of 1867 was passed, and within less than\r\nfive weeks after the inauguration of a President in political accord\r\nwith both branches of Congress, the sections of the act regulating\r\nsuspensions from office during the recess of the Senate were entirely\r\nrepealed, and in their place were substituted provisions which, instead\r\nof limiting the causes of suspension to misconduct, crime, disability,\r\nor disqualification, expressly permitted such suspension by the\r\nPresident \"in his discretion,\" and completely abandoned the requirement\r\nobliging him to report to the Senate \"the evidence and reasons\" for his\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWith these modifications and with all branches of the Government in\r\npolitical harmony, and in the absence of partisan incentive to captious\r\nobstruction, the law as it was left by the amendment of 1869 was much\r\nless destructive of Executive discretion. And yet the great general and\r\npatriotic citizen who on the 4th day of March, 1869, assumed the duties\r\nof Chief Executive, and for whose freer administration of his high\r\noffice the most hateful restraints of the law of 1867 were, on the 5th\r\nday of April, 1869, removed, mindful of his obligation to defend and\r\nprotect every prerogative of his great trust, and apprehensive of the\r\ninjury threatened the public service in the continued operation of these\r\nstatutes even in their modified form, in his first message to Congress\r\nadvised their repeal and set forth their unconstitutional character and\r\nhurtful tendency in the following language:\r\n\r\n  It may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from\r\n  leaving on the statute books the so-called \"tenure-of-office acts,\" and\r\n  to earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the\r\n  intention of the framers of the Constitution, when providing that\r\n  appointments made by the President should receive the consent of the\r\n  Senate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office\r\n  persons placed there by Federal appointment against the will of the\r\n  President. The law is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient\r\n  administration of the Government. What faith can an Executive put in\r\n  officials forced upon him, and those, too, whom he has suspended for\r\n  reason? How will such officials be likely to serve an Administration\r\n  which they know does not trust them?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am unable to state whether or not this recommendation for a repeal of\r\nthese laws has been since repeated. If it has not, the reason can\r\nprobably be found in the experience which demonstrated the fact that the\r\nnecessities of the political situation but rarely developed their\r\nvicious character.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happens that after an existence of nearly twenty years of\r\nalmost innocuous desuetude these laws are brought forth--apparently the\r\nrepealed as well as the unrepealed--and put in the way of an Executive\r\nwho is willing, if permitted, to attempt an improvement in the methods\r\nof administration.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of these laws is by no means admitted. But why\r\nshould the provisions of the repealed law, which required specific cause\r\nfor suspension and a report to the Senate of \"evidence and reasons,\"\r\nbe now in effect applied to the present Executive, instead of the law,\r\nafterwards passed and unrepealed, which distinctly permits suspensions\r\nby the President \"in his discretion\" and carefully omits the requirement\r\nthat \"evidence and reasons for his action in the case\" shall be reported\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe requests and demands which by the score have for nearly three months\r\nbeen presented to the different Departments of the Government, whatever\r\nmay be their form, have but one complexion. They assume the right of the\r\nSenate to sit in judgment upon the exercise of my exclusive discretion\r\nand Executive function, for which I am solely responsible to the people,\r\nfrom whom I have so lately received the sacred trust of office. My oath\r\nto support and defend the Constitution, my duty to the people who have\r\nchosen me to execute the powers of their great office and not to\r\nrelinquish them, and my duty to the Chief Magistracy, which I must\r\npreserve unimpaired in all its dignity and vigor, compel me to refuse\r\ncompliance with these demands.\r\n\r\nTo the end that the service may be improved, the Senate is invited to\r\nthe fullest scrutiny of the persons submitted to them for public office,\r\nin recognition of the constitutional power of that body to advise and\r\nconsent to their appointment. I shall continue, as I have thus far done,\r\nto furnish, at the request of the confirming body, all the information\r\nI possess touching the fitness of the nominees placed before them for\r\ntheir action, both when they are proposed to fill vacancies and to take\r\nthe place of suspended officials. Upon a refusal to confirm I shall not\r\nassume the right to ask the reasons for the action of the Senate nor\r\nquestion its determination. I can not think that anything more is\r\nrequired to secure worthy incumbents in public office than a careful and\r\nindependent discharge of our respective duties within their well-defined\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nThough the propriety of suspensions might be better assured if the\r\naction of the President was subject to review by the Senate, yet if the\r\nConstitution and the laws have placed this responsibility upon the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government it should not be divided nor the\r\ndiscretion which it involves relinquished.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that the present Executive having pledged himself\r\nnot to remove officials except for cause, the fact of their suspension\r\nimplies such misconduct on the part of a suspended official as injures\r\nhis character and reputation, and therefore the Senate should review the\r\ncase for his vindication.\r\n\r\nI have said that certain officials should not, in my opinion, be removed\r\nduring the continuance of the term for which they were appointed solely\r\nfor the purpose of putting in their place those in political affiliation\r\nwith the appointing power, and this declaration was immediately followed\r\nby a description of official partisanship which ought not to entitle\r\nthose in whom it was exhibited to consideration. It is not apparent\r\nhow an adherence to the course thus announced carries with it the\r\nconsequences described. If in any degree the suggestion is worthy of\r\nconsideration, it is to be hoped that there may be a defense against\r\nunjust suspension in the justice of the Executive.\r\n\r\nEvery pledge which I have made by which I have placed a limitation upon\r\nmy exercise of executive power has been faithfully redeemed. Of course\r\nthe pretense is not put forth that no mistakes have been committed; but\r\nnot a suspension has been made except it appeared to my satisfaction\r\nthat the public welfare would be improved thereby. Many applications for\r\nsuspension have been denied, and the adherence to the rule laid down to\r\ngovern my action as to such suspensions has caused much irritation and\r\nimpatience on the part of those who have insisted upon more changes in\r\nthe offices.\r\n\r\nThe pledges I have made were made to the people, and to them I am\r\nresponsible for the manner in which they have been redeemed. I am not\r\nresponsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions and\r\nofficial conduct to them for judgment.\r\n\r\nThere are no grounds for an allegation that the fear of being found\r\nfalse to my professions influences me in declining to submit to the\r\ndemands of the Senate. I have not constantly refused to suspend\r\nofficials, and thus incurred the displeasure of political friends, and\r\nyet willfully broken faith with the people for the sake of being false\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nNeither the discontent of party friends, nor the allurements constantly\r\noffered of confirmations of appointees conditioned upon the avowal that\r\nsuspensions have been made on party grounds alone, nor the threat\r\nproposed in the resolutions now before the Senate that no confirmations\r\nwill be made unless the demands of that body be complied with, are\r\nsufficient to discourage or deter me from following in the way which\r\nI am convinced leads to better government for the people.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 1, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is made the constitutional duty of the President to recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress from time to time such measures as he shall\r\njudge necessary and expedient. In no matters can the necessity of this\r\nbe more evident than when the good faith of the United States under the\r\nsolemn obligation of treaties with foreign powers is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe question of the treatment of the subjects of China sojourning within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States presents such a matter for the\r\nurgent and earnest consideration of the Executive and the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my first annual message, upon the assembling of the present Congress,\r\nI adverted to this question in the following words:\r\n\r\n  The harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained.\r\n\r\n  In the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of\r\n  1880, restrictive of the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United\r\n  States, individual cases of hardship have occurred beyond the power of\r\n  the Executive to remedy, and calling for judicial determination.\r\n\r\n  The condition of the Chinese question in the Western States and\r\n  Territories is, despite this restrictive legislation, far from being\r\n  satisfactory. The recent outbreak in Wyoming Territory, where numbers\r\n  of unoffending Chinamen, indisputably within the protection of the\r\n  treaties and the law, were murdered by a mob, and the still more recent\r\n  threatened outbreak of the same character in Washington Territory, are\r\n  fresh in the minds of all, and there is apprehension lest the bitterness\r\n  of feeling against the Mongolian race on the Pacific Slope may find vent\r\n  in similar lawless demonstrations. All the power of this Government\r\n  should be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in\r\n  the treatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law in\r\n  bringing the wrongdoers to justice should be insisted upon.\r\n\r\n  Every effort has been made by this Government to prevent these violent\r\n  outbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation\r\n  of these outrages; and it is but just to say that they are traceable to\r\n  the lawlessness of men not citizens of the United States engaged in\r\n  competition with Chinese laborers.\r\n\r\n  Race prejudice is the chief factor in originating these disturbances,\r\n  and it exists in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our domestic\r\n  peace and the good relationship we strive to maintain with China.\r\n\r\n  The admitted right of a government to prevent the influx of elements\r\n  hostile to its internal peace and security may not be questioned, even\r\n  where there is no treaty stipulation on the subject. That the exclusion\r\n  of Chinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions\r\n  prevail is strongly evidenced in the Dominion of Canada, where Chinese\r\n  immigration is now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If\r\n  existing laws are inadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be\r\n  prepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measures,\r\n  within the treaty limits, which the wisdom of Congress may devise.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time I wrote this the shocking occurrences at Rock Springs, in\r\nWyoming Territory, were fresh in the minds of all, and had been recently\r\npresented anew to the attention of this Government by the Chinese\r\nminister in a note which, while not unnaturally exhibiting some\r\nmisconception of our Federal system of administration in the Territories\r\nwhile they as yet are not in the exercise of the full measure of that\r\nsovereign self-government pertaining to the States of the Union,\r\npresents in truthful terms the main features of the cruel outrage there\r\nperpetrated upon inoffensive subjects of China. In the investigation of\r\nthe Rock Springs outbreak and the ascertainment of the facts on which\r\nthe Chinese minister's statements rest the Chinese representatives were\r\naided by the agents of the United States, and the reports submitted,\r\nhaving been thus framed and recounting the facts within the knowledge of\r\nwitnesses on both sides, possess an impartial truthfulness which could\r\nnot fail to give them great impressiveness.\r\n\r\nThe facts, which so far are not controverted or affected by any\r\nexculpatory or mitigating testimony, show the murder of a number of\r\nChinese subjects in September last at Rock Springs, the wounding of many\r\nothers, and the spoliation of the property of all when the unhappy\r\nsurvivors had been driven from their habitations. There is no allegation\r\nthat the victims by any lawless or disorderly act on their part\r\ncontributed to bring about a collision; on the contrary, it appears that\r\nthe law-abiding disposition of these people, who were sojourners in our\r\nmidst under the sanction of hospitality and express treaty obligations,\r\nwas made the pretext for an attack upon them. This outrage upon law\r\nand treaty engagements was committed by a lawless mob. None of the\r\naggressors--happily for the national good fame--appear by the reports\r\nto have been citizens of the United States. They were aliens engaged in\r\nthat remote district as mining laborers, who became excited against the\r\nChinese laborers, as it would seem, because of their refusal to join\r\nthem in a strike to secure higher wages. The oppression of Chinese\r\nsubjects by their rivals in the competition for labor does not differ in\r\nviolence and illegality from that applied to other classes of native or\r\nalien labor. All are equally under the protection of law and equally\r\nentitled to enjoy the benefits of assured public order.\r\n\r\nWere there no treaty in existence referring to the rights of Chinese\r\nsubjects; did they come hither as all other strangers who voluntarily\r\nresort to this land of freedom, of self-government, and of laws, here\r\npeaceably to win their bread and to live their lives, there can be no\r\nquestion that they would be entitled still to the same measure of\r\nprotection from violence and the same free forum for the redress of\r\ntheir grievances as any other aliens.\r\n\r\nSo far as the treaties between the United States and China stipulate for\r\nthe treatment of the Chinese subjects actually in the United States as\r\nthe citizens or subjects of \"the most favored nation\" are treated, they\r\ncreate no new status for them; they simply recognize and confirm a\r\ngeneral and existing rule, applicable to all aliens alike, for none are\r\nfavored above others by domestic law, and none by foreign treaties\r\nunless it be the Chinese themselves in some respects. For by the third\r\narticle of the treaty of November 17, 1880, between the United States\r\nand China it is provided that--\r\n\r\n  ART. III. If Chinese laborers, or Chinese of any other class, now either\r\n  permanently or temporarily residing in the territory of the United\r\n  States, meet with ill treatment at the hands of any other persons, the\r\n  Government of the United States will exert all its power to devise\r\n  measures for their protection and to secure to them the same rights,\r\n  privileges, immunities, and exemptions as may be enjoyed by the citizens\r\n  or subjects of the most favored nation, and to which they are entitled\r\n  by treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article may be held to constitute a special privilege for Chinese\r\nsubjects in the United States, as compared with other aliens; not that\r\nit creates any peculiar rights which others do not share, but because,\r\nin case, of ill treatment of the Chinese in the United States, this\r\nGovernment is bound to \"exert all its power to devise measures for their\r\nprotection,\" by securing to them the rights to which equally with any\r\nand all other foreigners they are entitled.\r\n\r\nWhether it is now incumbent upon the United States to amend their\r\ngeneral laws or devise new measures in this regard I do not consider in\r\nthe present communication, but confine myself to the particular point\r\nraised by the outrage and massacre at Rock Springs.\r\n\r\nThe note of the Chinese minister and the documents which accompany\r\nit give, as I believe, an unexaggerated statement of the lamentable\r\nincident, and present impressively the regrettable circumstance that\r\nthe proceedings, in the name of justice, for the ascertainment of the\r\ncrime and fixing the responsibility therefor were a ghastly mockery\r\nof justice. So long as the Chinese minister, under his instructions,\r\nmakes this the basis of an appeal to the principles and convictions\r\nof mankind, no exception can be taken; but when he goes further, and,\r\ntaking as his precedent the action of the Chinese Government in past\r\ninstances where the lives of American citizens and their property in\r\nChina have been endangered, argues a reciprocal obligation on the part\r\nof the United States to indemnify the Chinese subjects who suffered at\r\nRock Springs, it became necessary to meet his argument and to deny most\r\nemphatically the conclusions he seeks to draw as to the existence of\r\nsuch a liability and the right of the Chinese Government to insist\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nI draw the attention of the Congress to the latter part of the note of\r\nthe Secretary of State of February 18, 1886, in reply to the Chinese\r\nminister's representations, and invite especial consideration of the\r\ncogent reasons by which he reaches the conclusion that whilst the United\r\nStates Government is under no obligation, whether by the express terms\r\nof its treaties with China or the principles of international law, to\r\nindemnify these Chinese subjects for losses caused by such means and\r\nunder the admitted circumstances, yet that in view of the palpable and\r\ndiscreditable failure of the authorities of Wyoming Territory to bring\r\nto justice the guilty parties or to assure to the sufferers an impartial\r\nforum in which to seek and obtain compensation for the losses which\r\nthose subjects have incurred by lack of police protection, and\r\nconsidering further the entire absence of provocation or contribution\r\non the part of the victims, the Executive may be induced to bring the\r\nmatter to the benevolent consideration of the Congress, in order that\r\nthat body, in its high discretion, may direct the bounty of the\r\nGovernment in aid of innocent and peaceful strangers whose maltreatment\r\nhas brought discredit upon the country, with the distinct understanding\r\nthat such action is in no wise to be held as a precedent, is wholly\r\ngratuitous, and is resorted to in a spirit of pure generosity toward\r\nthose who are otherwise helpless.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence exchanged is herewith submitted for the information\r\nof the Congress, and accompanies a like message to the House

The hardship has in some cases\r\nbeen remedied by the action of the courts. In other cases, however,\r\nwhere the phraseology of the statutes has appeared to be conclusive\r\nagainst any discretion on the part of the officers charged with the\r\nexecution of the law, Chinese persons expressly entitled to free\r\nadmission under the treaty have been refused a landing and sent back to\r\nthe country whence they came without being afforded any opportunity to\r\nshow in the courts or otherwise their right to the privilege of free\r\ningress and egress which it was the purpose of the treaty to secure.\r\n\r\nIn the language of one of the judicial determinations of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States to which I have referred--\r\n\r\n  The supposition should not be indulged that Congress, while professing\r\n  to faithfully execute the treaty stipulations and recognizing the fact\r\n  that they secure to a certain class the right to go from and come to\r\n  the United States, intended to make its protection depend upon the\r\n  performance of conditions which it was physically impossible to perform.\r\n  (112 U.S. Reports, p. 554, Chew Heong _vs._ United States.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of July 5, 1884, imposes such an impossible condition in not\r\nproviding for the admission, under proper certificate, of Chinese\r\ntravelers of the exempted classes in the cases most likely to arise in\r\nordinary commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe treaty provisions governing the case are as follows:\r\n\r\n  ART. I. * * * The limitation or suspension shall be reasonable, and\r\n  shall apply only to Chinese who may go to the United States as laborers,\r\n  other classes not being included in the limitations. * * *\r\n\r\n  ART. II. Chinese subjects, whether proceeding to the United States as\r\n  teachers, students, merchants, or from curiosity, together with their\r\n  body and household servants, * * * shall be allowed to go and come of\r\n  their own free will and accord, and shall be accorded all the rights,\r\n  privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the\r\n  citizens and subjects of the most favored nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 of the amended Chinese immigration act of 1884 purports to\r\nsecure this treaty right to the exempted classes named by means of\r\nprescribed certificates of their status, which certificates shall be the\r\n_prima facie_ and the sole permissible evidence to establish a\r\nright of entry into the United States. But it provides in terms for the\r\nissuance of certificates in two cases only:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Chinese subjects departing from a port of China; and\r\n\r\n(_b_) Chinese persons (_i.e._, of the Chinese race) who may at\r\nthe time be subjects of some foreign government other than China, and\r\nwho may depart for the United States from the ports of such other\r\nforeign government.\r\n\r\nA statute is certainly most unusual which, purporting to execute the\r\nprovisions of a treaty with China in respect of Chinese subjects, enacts\r\nstrict formalities as regards the subjects of other governments than\r\nthat of China.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient that I should call the earnest attention of Congress to\r\nthe circumstance that the statute makes no provision whatever for the\r\nsomewhat numerous class of Chinese persons who, retaining their Chinese\r\nsubjection in some countries other than China, desire to come from such\r\ncountries to the United States.\r\n\r\nChinese merchants have trading operations of magnitude throughout the\r\nworld. They do not become citizens or subjects of the country where they\r\nmay temporarily reside and trade; they continue to be subjects of China,\r\nand to them the explicit exemption of the treaty applies. Yet if such a\r\nChinese subject, the head of a mercantile house at Hongkong or Yokohama\r\nor Honolulu or Havana or Colon, desires to come from any of these places\r\nto the United States, he is met with the requirement that he must\r\nproduce a certificate, in prescribed form and in the English tongue,\r\nissued by the Chinese Government. If there be at the foreign place of\r\nhis residence no representative of the Chinese Government competent to\r\nissue a certificate in the prescribed form, he can obtain none, and is\r\nunder the provisions of the present law unjustly debarred from entry\r\ninto the United States. His usual Chinese passport will not suffice,\r\nfor it is not in the form which the act prescribes shall be the sole\r\npermissible evidence of his right to land. And he can obtain no such\r\ncertificate from the Government of his place of residence, because he\r\nis not a subject or citizen thereof \"at the time,\" or at any time.\r\n\r\nThere being, therefore, no statutory provision prescribing the terms\r\nupon which Chinese persons resident in foreign countries but not\r\nsubjects or citizens of such countries may prove their status and\r\nrights as members of the exempted classes in the absence of a Chinese\r\nrepresentative in such country, the Secretary of the Treasury, in whom\r\nthe execution of the act of July 5, 1884, was vested, undertook to\r\nremedy the omission by directing the revenue officers to recognize\r\nas lawful certificates those issued in favor of Chinese subjects by\r\nthe Chinese consular and diplomatic officers at the foreign port of\r\ndeparture, when viséed by the United States representative thereat.\r\nThis appears to be a just application of the spirit of the law, although\r\nenlarging its letter, and in adopting this rule he was controlled by the\r\nauthority of high judicial decision as to what evidence is necessary to\r\nestablish the fact that an individual Chinaman belongs to the exempted\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nHe, however, went beyond the spirit of the act and the judicial\r\ndecisions, by providing, in a circular dated January 14, 1885, for the\r\noriginal issuance of such a certificate by the United States consular\r\nofficer at the port of departure, in the absence of a Chinese diplomatic\r\nor consular representative thereat; for it is clear that the act of\r\nCongress contemplated the intervention of the United States consul only\r\nin a supervisory capacity, his function being to check the proceeding\r\nand see that no abuse of the privilege followed. The power or duty of\r\noriginal certification is wholly distinct from that supervisory\r\nfunction. It either dispenses with the foreign certificate altogether,\r\nleaving the consular visé to stand alone and sufficient, or else it\r\ncombines in one official act the distinct functions of certification and\r\nverification of the fact certified.\r\n\r\nThe official character attaching to the consular certification\r\ncontemplated by the unamended circular of January 14, 1885, is to be\r\nborne in mind. It is not merely _prima facie_ evidence of the\r\nstatus of the bearer, such as the courts may admit in their discretion;\r\nit was prescribed as an official attestation, on the strength of which\r\nthe customs officers at the port of entry were to admit the bearer\r\nwithout further adjudication of his status unless question should arise\r\nas to the truth of the certificate itself.\r\n\r\nIt became, therefore, necessary to amend the circular of January 14,\r\n1885, and this was done on the 13th of June following, by striking out\r\nthe clause prescribing original certification of status by the United\r\nStates consuls. The effect of this amendment is to deprive any\r\ncertificate the United States consuls may issue of the value it\r\npurported to possess as sole permissible evidence under the statute when\r\nits issuance was prescribed by Treasury regulations. There is, however,\r\nnothing to prevent consuls giving certificates of facts within their\r\nknowledge to be received as evidence in the absence of statutory\r\nauthentication.\r\n\r\nThe complaint of the Chinese minister in his note of March 24, 1886,\r\nis that the Chinese merchant Lay Sang, of the house of King Lee & Co.,\r\nof San Francisco, having arrived at San Francisco from Hongkong and\r\nexhibited a certificate of the United States consul at Hongkong as to\r\nhis status as a merchant, and consequently exempt under the treaty,\r\nwas refused permission to land and was sent back to Hongkong by the\r\nsteamer which brought him. While the certificate he bore was doubtless\r\ninsufficient under the present law, it is to be remembered that there is\r\nat Hongkong no representative of the Government of China competent or\r\nauthorized to issue the certificate required by the statute. The intent\r\nof Congress to legislate in execution of the treaty is thus defeated\r\nby a prohibition directly contrary to the treaty, and conditions are\r\nexacted which, in the words of the Supreme Court hereinbefore quoted,\r\n\"it was physically impossible to perform.\"\r\n\r\nThis anomalous feature of the act should be reformed as speedily as\r\npossible, in order that the occurrence of such cases may be avoided and\r\nthe imputation removed which would otherwise rest upon the good faith of\r\nthe United States in the execution of their solemn treaty engagements.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 9, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, in relation to\r\nthe mercantile marines of France, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 14, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th\r\nultimo, requesting the Secretary of State \"to communicate to the House\r\nof Representatives, if not incompatible with the public interest, copies\r\nof the recent correspondence and dispatches between the Secretary of\r\nState and the minister of the United States at The Hague touching the\r\nsubject of taxation of petroleum in Holland and in the Dutch colonies,\r\nand that of the export therefrom of leaf tobacco to the United States,\"\r\nI transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State on the subject.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 14, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n6th instant, requesting the Secretary of State \"to transmit, if not\r\nincompatible with the public interest, copies of all correspondence\r\nbetween his Department and the representatives of France, Germany,\r\nAustria, and any other European country which has partially or entirely\r\nrestricted the importation of American pork,\" I transmit herewith the\r\nreport of the Secretary of State on the subject.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 20, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State on the\r\nmanufacture of milk sugar in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution imposes upon the President the duty of recommending to\r\nthe consideration of Congress from time to time such measures as he\r\nshall judge necessary and expedient.\r\n\r\nI am so deeply impressed with the importance of immediately and\r\nthoughtfully meeting the problem which recent events and a present\r\ncondition have thrust upon us, involving the settlement of disputes\r\narising between our laboring men and their employers, that I am\r\nconstrained to recommend to Congress legislation upon this serious and\r\npressing subject.\r\n\r\nUnder our form of government the value of labor as an element of\r\nnational prosperity should be distinctly recognized, and the welfare\r\nof the laboring man should be regarded as especially entitled to\r\nlegislative care. In a country which offers to all its citizens the\r\nhighest attainment of social and political distinction its workingmen\r\ncan not justly or safely be considered as irrevocably consigned to the\r\nlimits of a class and entitled to no attention and allowed no protest\r\nagainst neglect.\r\n\r\nThe laboring man, bearing in his hand an indispensable contribution to\r\nour growth and progress, may well insist, with manly courage and as a\r\nright, upon the same recognition from those who make our laws as is\r\naccorded to any other citizen having a valuable interest in charge; and\r\nhis reasonable demands should be met in such a spirit of appreciation\r\nand fairness as to induce a contented and patriotic cooperation in the\r\nachievement of a grand national destiny.\r\n\r\nWhile the real interests of labor are not promoted by a resort to\r\nthreats and violent manifestations, and while those who, under the\r\npretext of an advocacy of the claims of labor, wantonly attack the\r\nrights of capital and for selfish purposes or the love of disorder sow\r\nseeds of violence and discontent should neither be encouraged nor\r\nconciliated, all legislation on the subject should be calmly and\r\ndeliberately undertaken, with no purpose of satisfying unreasonable\r\ndemands or gaining partisan advantage.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the relations between labor and capital is far\r\nfrom satisfactory. The discontent of the employed is due in a large\r\ndegree to the grasping and heedless exactions of employers and the\r\nalleged discrimination in favor of capital as an object of governmental\r\nattention. It must also be conceded that the laboring men are not always\r\ncareful to avoid causeless and unjustifiable disturbance.\r\n\r\nThough the importance of a better accord between these interests is\r\napparent, it must be borne in mind that any effort in that direction\r\nby the Federal Government must be greatly limited by constitutional\r\nrestrictions. There are many grievances which legislation by Congress\r\ncan not redress, and many conditions which can not by such means be\r\nreformed.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied, however, that something may be done under Federal\r\nauthority to prevent the disturbances which so often arise from disputes\r\nbetween employers and the employed, and which at times seriously\r\nthreaten the business interests of the country; and, in my opinion, the\r\nproper theory upon which to proceed is that of voluntary arbitration as\r\nthe means of settling these difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut I suggest that instead of arbitrators chosen in the heat of\r\nconflicting claims, and after each dispute shall arise, for the purpose\r\nof determining the same, there be created a commission of labor,\r\nconsisting of three members, who shall be regular officers of the\r\nGovernment, charged among other duties with the consideration and\r\nsettlement, when possible, of all controversies between labor and\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nA commission thus organized would have the advantage of being a stable\r\nbody, and its members, as they gained experience, would constantly\r\nimprove in their ability to deal intelligently and usefully with the\r\nquestions which might be submitted to them. If arbitrators are chosen\r\nfor temporary service as each case of dispute arises, experience and\r\nfamiliarity with much that is involved in the question will be lacking,\r\nextreme partisanship and bias will be the qualifications sought on\r\neither side, and frequent complaints of unfairness and partiality will\r\nbe inevitable. The imposition upon a Federal court of a duty so foreign\r\nto the judicial function as the selection of an arbitrator in such cases\r\nis at least of doubtful propriety.\r\n\r\nThe establishment by Federal authority of such a bureau would be\r\na just and sensible recognition of the value of labor and of its right\r\nto be represented in the departments of the Government. So far as its\r\nconciliatory offices shall have relation to disturbances which interfere\r\nwith transit and commerce between the States, its existence would\r\nbe justified under the provision of the Constitution which gives to\r\nCongress the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among\r\nthe several States;\" and in the frequent disputes between the laboring\r\nmen and their employers, of less extent, and the consequences of which\r\nare confined within State limits and threaten domestic violence, the\r\ninterposition of such a commission might be tendered, upon the\r\napplication of the legislature or executive of a State, under the\r\nconstitutional provision which requires the General Government to\r\n\"protect\" each of the States \"against domestic violence.\"\r\n\r\nIf such a commission were fairly organized, the risk of a loss of\r\npopular support and sympathy resulting from a refusal to submit to\r\nso peaceful an instrumentality would constrain both parties to such\r\ndisputes to invoke its interference and abide by its decisions. There\r\nwould also be good reason to hope that the very existence of such an\r\nagency would invite application to it for advice and counsel, frequently\r\nresulting in the avoidance of contention and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIf the usefulness of such a commission is doubted because it might lack\r\npower to enforce its decisions, much encouragement is derived from the\r\nconceded good that has been accomplished by the railroad commissions\r\nwhich have been organized in many of the States, which, having little\r\nmore than advisory power, have exerted a most salutary influence in the\r\nsettlement of disputes between conflicting interests.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1884, by a law of Congress, a Bureau of Labor was established\r\nand placed in charge of a Commissioner of Labor, who is required to\r\n\"collect information upon the subject of labor, its relations to\r\ncapital, the hours of labor and the earnings of laboring men and women,\r\nand the means of promoting their material, social, intellectual, and\r\nmoral prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission which I suggest could easily be ingrafted upon the bureau\r\nthus already organized by the addition of two more commissioners and by\r\nsupplementing the duties now imposed upon it by such other powers and\r\nfunctions as would permit the commissioners to act as arbitrators when\r\nnecessary between labor and capital, under such limitations and upon\r\nsuch occasions as should be deemed proper and useful.\r\n\r\nPower should also be distinctly conferred upon this bureau to\r\ninvestigate the causes of all disputes as they occur, whether submitted\r\nfor arbitration or not, so that information may always be at hand to aid\r\nlegislation on the subject when necessary and desirable.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 26, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanied by a report of Mr. Somerville P.

Drexel, esq., chairman of the executive committee of \"the\r\nAmerican committee on the pedestal of the great statue of 'Liberty\r\nEnlightening the World,'\" dated the 27th of April, 1886, suggesting\r\nthe propriety of the further execution by the President of the joint\r\nresolution referred to by prescribing the ceremonies of inauguration\r\nto be observed upon the complete erection of the statue upon its site\r\non Bedloes Island, in the harbor of New York.\r\n\r\nThursday, the 3d of September, being the anniversary of the signing of\r\nthe treaty of peace at Paris by which the independence of these United\r\nStates was recognized and secured, has been suggested by this committee\r\nunder whose auspices and agency the pedestal for the statue has been\r\nconstructed as an appropriate day for the ceremonies of inauguration.\r\n\r\nThe international character which has been imprinted upon this work by\r\nthe joint resolution of 1877 makes it incumbent upon Congress to provide\r\nmeans to carry their resolution into effect.\r\n\r\nTherefore I recommend the appropriation of such sum of money as in the\r\njudgment of Congress shall be deemed adequate and proper to defray the\r\ncost of the inauguration of this statue.\r\n\r\nI have been informed by the committee that certain expenses have been\r\nincurred in the care and custody of the statue since it was deposited on\r\nBedloes Island, and the phraseology of the joint resolution providing\r\nfor \"the permanent care and preservation thereof as a monument of art\"\r\nwould seem to include the payment by the United States of the expense so\r\nincurred since the reception of the statue in this country.\r\n\r\nThe action of the French Government and people in relation to the\r\npresentation of this statue to the United States will, I hope, meet with\r\nhearty and responsive action upon the part of Congress, in which the\r\nExecutive will be most happy to cooperate.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 11, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe last general appropriation bill passed by the legislature of\r\nUtah was vetoed by the then governor of that Territory.

It also appropriated for the\r\nsupport of the Territorial insane asylum, as well as the salaries of\r\nTerritorial officers, including that of the superintendent of the\r\ndistrict schools, the auditor, the librarian, and the treasurer of the\r\nTerritory. It also provided for internal improvements, such as roads and\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for the district courts, for the payment of witnesses\r\nand jurors in criminal cases, was $40,000; that for the Deseret\r\nUniversity and the deaf mutes was $66,000, and for the insane asylum\r\n$25,000.\r\n\r\nThe board of regents of the Deseret University have borrowed money for\r\nthe completion of the university buildings which were authorized by\r\nlegislative action, and which is now due and no provision made for the\r\npayment.

This included the sum\r\nof $13,000, which had been borrowed by the board of directors of the\r\nasylum for its completion and furnishing, and which now remains due and\r\nunpaid.

The suggestion was\r\nfavorably entertained by this Government, not only on account of the\r\nimportance of such a treaty to the execution of the criminal laws of the\r\nUnited States, but also because of the support which its conclusion\r\nwould give to Japan in her efforts toward judicial autonomy and complete\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 15, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, concerning the\r\nclaim of Benjamin Weil and La Abra Mining Company, of Mexico, agreeably\r\nto the resolution of the House of Representatives dated May 13, 1886.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of a bill originating in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, No. 4838, entitled \"An act to abolish certain fees for\r\nofficial services to American vessels, and to amend the laws relating to\r\nshipping commissioners, seamen, and owners of vessels, and for other\r\npurposes,\" I find that there is such a failure to adjust existing laws\r\nto the new departure proposed by the bill as to greatly endanger the\r\npublic service if this bill should not be amended or at once\r\nsupplemented by additional legislation.\r\n\r\nThe fees which are at present collected from vessels for services\r\nperformed by the Bureau of Inspection, and which made up the fund from\r\nwhich certain expenses appurtenant to that Bureau were paid, are by the\r\nproposed bill abolished, but no provision has been substituted directing\r\nthat such expenses shall be paid from the public Treasury or any other\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the bill are in the main so useful and important that I\r\nhave concluded to approve the same upon the assurance of those actively\r\npromoting its passage that another bill shall at once be introduced to\r\ncover the defect above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of such supplemental legislation is so obvious that I hope\r\nit will receive the immediate action of the Congress.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 28, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith inclose a report from the Secretary of State, with its\r\naccompanying copies of papers, relative to the case of the American\r\nschooner _Ounalaska_, which was duly condemned by the Government of\r\nSalvador for having been employed in aid of an insurrection against that\r\nRepublic, and was subsequently presented to the United States.

A site has been purchased for said\r\nbuilding, and, as is too often the case, it is now discovered that the\r\nsum appropriated is insufficient to meet the expense of such a building\r\nas is really needed.\r\n\r\nThe object of the bill which I have approved is to extend the limit of\r\nthe cost to $80,000 and to make the additional appropriation to reach\r\nthat sum. The first section fixes the limit above mentioned, but the\r\nsecond section appropriates $35,000, and thus, with the appropriation of\r\n$50,000 heretofore made, the aggregate appropriations exceed the sum to\r\nwhich the cost of the building is limited by $5,000.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this latter sum can not properly be applied to the\r\nconstruction of the building, attention is called to the existence of\r\nthis excess of appropriation and the suggestion made that it be returned\r\nto the Treasury.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 2, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of your honorable body of the 26th ultimo,\r\nI transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers,\r\ncommunicating the information possessed by the Department of State\r\n\"concerning the alleged illegal detention of A.K.

Many in opposition have\r\nurged its dangerous character as tending to break down the boundaries\r\nbetween the proper exercise of legislative power by Federal and State\r\nauthority; many in favor of the enactment have represented that it\r\npromised great advantages to a large portion of our population who sadly\r\nneed relief; and those on both sides of the question whose advocacy or\r\nopposition is based upon no broader foundation than local or personal\r\ninterest have outnumbered all the others.\r\n\r\nThis upon its face and in its main features is a revenue bill, and\r\nwas first introduced in the House of Representatives, wherein the\r\nConstitution declares that all bills for raising revenue shall\r\noriginate.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has invested Congress with a very wide legislative\r\ndiscretion both as to the necessity of taxation and the selection of the\r\nobjects of its burdens; and though if the question was presented to me\r\nas an original proposition I might doubt the present need of increased\r\ntaxation, I deem it my duty in this instance to defer to the judgment of\r\nthe legislative branch of the Government, which has been so emphatically\r\nannounced in both Houses of Congress upon the passage of this bill.\r\n\r\nMoreover, those who desire to see removed the weight of taxation now\r\npressing upon the people from other directions may well be justified in\r\nthe hope and expectation that the selection of an additional subject\r\nof internal taxation so well able to bear it will in consistency be\r\nfollowed by legislation relieving our citizens from other revenue\r\nburdens, rendered by the passage of this bill even more than heretofore\r\nunnecessary and needlessly oppressive.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged as an objection to this measure that while purporting\r\nto be legislation for revenue its real purpose is to destroy, by the use\r\nof the taxing power, one industry of our people for the protection and\r\nbenefit of another.\r\n\r\nIf entitled to indulge in such a suspicion as a basis of official action\r\nin this case, and if entirely satisfied that the consequences indicated\r\nwould ensue, I should doubtless feel constrained to interpose Executive\r\ndissent.\r\n\r\nBut I do not feel called upon to interpret the motives of Congress\r\notherwise than by the apparent character of the bill which has been\r\npresented to me, and I am convinced that the taxes which it creates can\r\nnot possibly destroy the open and legitimate manufacture and sale of the\r\nthing upon which it is levied. If this article has the merit which its\r\nfriends claim for it, and if the people of the land, with full knowledge\r\nof its real character, desire to purchase and use it, the taxes exacted\r\nby this bill will permit a fair profit to both manufacturer and dealer.\r\nIf the existence of the commodity taxed and the profits of its\r\nmanufacture and sale depend upon disposing of it to the people for\r\nsomething else which it deceitfully imitates, the entire enterprise is\r\na fraud and not an industry; and if it can not endure the exhibition\r\nof its real character which will be effected by the inspection,\r\nsupervision, and stamping which this bill directs, the sooner it is\r\ndestroyed the better in the interest of fair dealing.\r\n\r\nSuch a result would not furnish the first instance in the history of\r\nlegislation in which a revenue bill produced a benefit which was merely\r\nincidental to its main purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no industry better entitled to the incidental\r\nadvantages which may follow this legislation than our farming and dairy\r\ninterests, and to none of our people should they be less begrudged than\r\nour farmers and dairymen. The present depression of their occupations,\r\nthe hard, steady, and often unremunerative toil which such occupations\r\nexact, and the burdens of taxation which our agriculturists necessarily\r\nbear entitle them to every legitimate consideration.\r\n\r\nNor should there be opposition to the incidental effect of this\r\nlegislation on the part of those who profess to be engaged honestly and\r\nfairly in the manufacture and sale of a wholesome and valuable article\r\nof food which by its provisions may be subject to taxation. As long as\r\ntheir business is carried on under cover and by false pretenses such\r\nmen have bad companions in those whose manufactures, however vile and\r\nharmful, take their place without challenge with the better sort in a\r\ncommon crusade of deceit against the public. But if this occupation and\r\nits methods are forced into the light and all these manufactures must\r\nthus either stand upon their merits or fall, the good and bad must soon\r\npart company and the fittest only will survive.\r\n\r\nNot the least important incident related to this legislation is the\r\ndefense afforded to the consumer against the fraudulent substitution\r\nand sale of an imitation for a genuine article of food of very general\r\nhousehold use. Notwithstanding the immense quantity of the article\r\ndescribed in this bill which is sold to the people for their consumption\r\nas food, and notwithstanding the claim made that its manufacture\r\nsupplies a cheap substitute for butter, I venture to say that hardly a\r\npound ever entered a poor man's house under its real name and in its\r\ntrue character.\r\n\r\nWhile in its relation to an article of this description there should\r\nbe no governmental regulation of what the citizen shall eat, it is\r\ncertainly not a cause of regret if by legislation of this character he\r\nis afforded a means by which he may better protect himself against\r\nimposition in meeting the needs and wants of his daily life.\r\n\r\nHaving entered upon this legislation, it is manifestly a duty to render\r\nit as effective as possible in the accomplishment of all the good which\r\nshould legitimately follow in its train.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the suggestion that the article proposed to be taxed and\r\nthe circumstances which subject it thereto should be clearly and with\r\ngreat distinctness defined in the statute. It seems to me that this\r\nobject has not been completely attained in the phraseology of the second\r\nsection of the bill, and that question may well arise as to the precise\r\ncondition the article to be taxed must assume in order to be regarded as\r\n\"made in imitation or semblance of butter, or, when so made, calculated\r\nor intended to be sold as butter or for butter.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth and fifteenth sections of the bill, in my opinion, are in\r\ndanger of being construed as an interference with the police powers of\r\nthe States. Not being entirely satisfied of the unconstitutionality of\r\nthese provisions, and regarding them as not being so connected and\r\ninterwoven with the other sections as, if found invalid, to vitiate the\r\nentire measure, I have determined to commend them to the attention of\r\nthe House with a view to an immediate amendment of the bill if it should\r\nbe deemed necessary and if it is practicable at this late day in the\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe fact, too, that the bill does not take effect by its terms until\r\nninety days have elapsed after its approval, thus leaving it but one\r\nmonth in operation before the next session of Congress, when, if time\r\ndoes not now permit, the safety and efficiency of the measure may be\r\nabundantly protected by remedial legislative action, and the desire\r\nto see realized the beneficial results which it is expected will\r\nimmediately follow the inauguration of this legislation, have had their\r\ninfluence in determining my official action.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which have been referred to will, I hope, justify\r\nthis communication and the suggestions which it contains.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 4, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d instant (the Senate concurring), I return herewith Senate bill No.\r\n2056, entitled \"An act to amend the pension laws by increasing the\r\npensions of soldiers and sailors who have lost an arm or leg in the\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 10, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have carefully considered Senate bill No. 193, entitled \"An act for\r\nthe relief of John Hollins McBlair,\" and hereby return the same without\r\napproval to the Senate, where it originated, with my objections to the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe object of this bill is to suspend the provisions of law regulating\r\nappointments in the Army by promotion so far as they affect John Hollins\r\nMcBlair, and to authorize the President to nominate and, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, appoint said McBlair a first\r\nlieutenant in the Army and to place him upon the retired list as of the\r\ndate of April 8, 1864, with the pay of his rank from April 30, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was appointed a first lieutenant in\r\nthe Army, from civil life, in June, 1861, with rank from May 14, 1861.\r\n\r\nIt appears from his own testimony, afterwards taken before a retiring\r\nboard, that at the time he was commissioned he was but 17 years of age.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1861, he was in the field for five days with his regiment,\r\nwithin which time he participated in no battle, skirmish, or engagement\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\nAfter five days spent in marching and camping he was taken sick, and\r\nafter remaining in camp six or seven weeks, his illness still\r\ncontinuing, he was granted sick leave and came to Washington.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1862, he was put on duty in the Commissary Department at\r\nWashington and remained there until August, 1863, when he was summoned\r\nbefore a retiring board convened for the purpose of retiring disabled\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nFrom testimony before this board it appears that the illness which\r\ncaused him to leave his regiment was one not uncommon in the Army, and\r\nyielded to treatment, so that in April or May, 1862, he was completely\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, however, he was attacked with convulsions, which were\r\npronounced by the physicians examined before the board to be a form of\r\nepilepsy, and for this cause he was found to be incapacitated for active\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe medical testimony, while it suggested various causes for this\r\nepileptic condition, negatives entirely any claim that these attacks\r\nwere at all related to the illness which obliged this officer to abandon\r\nservice with his regiment. He testified himself that he had been told\r\nhe had one or two convulsions in childhood, but there is no direct\r\ntestimony that he was subject to epileptic attacks before he entered the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nThe retiring board determined upon the proof that this incapacity\r\ndid not result from any incident of military service, and therefore\r\nLieutenant McBlair was in October, 1863, retired wholly from the service\r\nwith one year's pay and allowances, which is the usual action in such\r\ncases, and which was approved by the President.\r\n\r\nBut in April, 1864, the President, in a review of the case, made an\r\norder that instead of this officer being wholly retired he should be\r\nplaced upon the retired list as of the date when the action of the\r\nretiring board was originally approved.\r\n\r\nFor about twenty years, and up to April 30, 1884, he remained upon the\r\nretired list and received the pay to which this position entitled him.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, in consequence of a claim of additional pay which he\r\nmade upon the Government, his status was examined by the Court of\r\nClaims, which decided that the action of the President in April, 1864,\r\nby which he sought to change the original disposition of the case upon\r\nthe findings of the retiring board, was nugatory, and that ever since\r\nOctober, 1863, this officer had not been connected with the Army and had\r\nbeen receiving from the Government money to which he was not entitled.\r\n\r\nIf the bill herewith returned becomes a law, it makes valid all payments\r\nmade, and if its purpose is carried out causes such payments to be\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nThe finding of the retiring board seems so satisfactory and the merits\r\nof this case so slight in the light of the large sum already paid to\r\nthe applicant, while the claims of thousands of wounded and disabled\r\nsoldiers wait for justice at the hands of the Government, that I am\r\nconstrained to interpose an objection to a measure which proposes to\r\nsuspend general and wholesome laws for the purpose of granting what\r\nappears to me to be an undeserved gratuity.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 11, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval, and with a statement of my\r\nobjections thereto, Senate bill No. 150, entitled \"An act to quiet title\r\nof settlers on the Des Moines River lands in the State of Iowa, and for\r\nother purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposed legislation grows out of a grant of land made to the\r\nTerritory of Iowa in the year 1846 to aid in the improvement of the\r\nnavigation of the Des Moines River.\r\n\r\nThe language of this grant was such that it gave rise to conflicting\r\ndecisions on the part of the Government Departments as to its extent,\r\nand it was not until 1860 that this question was authoritatively and\r\nfinally settled by the Supreme Court of the United States. Its decision\r\ndiminished the extent of the grant to a quantity much less than had been\r\ninsisted on by certain interested parties and rendered invalid the\r\ntitles of parties who held, under the Territory or State of Iowa, lands\r\nbeyond the limit of the grant fixed by the decision of the court.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of validating such titles and to settle all disputes so\r\nfar as the General Government was concerned, the Congress, in the year\r\n1861, by a joint resolution, transferred to the State of Iowa all the\r\ntitle then retained by the United States to the lands within the larger\r\nlimits which had been claimed, and then held by _bona fide_\r\npurchasers from the State; and in 1862 an act of Congress was passed for\r\nthe same general purpose.\r\n\r\nWithout detailing the exact language of this resolution and statute, it\r\ncertainly seems to be such a transfer and relinquishment of all\r\ninterests in the land mentioned on the part of the United States as to\r\nrelieve the Government from any further concern therein.\r\n\r\nThe questions unfortunately growing out of this grant and the\r\nlegislation relating thereto have been passed upon by the United States\r\nSupreme Court in numerous cases, and as late as 1883 that court,\r\nreferring to its many previous decisions, adjudged that \"the act of 1862\r\n(12 U.S. Statutes at Large, ch. 161, p. 543) transferred the title from\r\nthe United States and vested it in the State of Iowa for the use of its\r\ngrantees under the river grant.\"\r\n\r\nBills similar to this have been before Congress for a number of years\r\nand have failed of passage; and at least on one occasion the Committee\r\non the Judiciary of the Senate reported adversely upon a measure\r\ncovering the same ground.\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined the legislation upon the subject of this\r\ngrant, and studied the decisions of the court upon the numerous and\r\ncomplicated questions which have arisen from such legislation, and the\r\npositions of the parties claiming an interest in the land covered by\r\nsaid grant, and I can not but think that every possible question that\r\ncan be raised, or at least that ought to be raised, in any suit relating\r\nto these lands has been determined by the highest judicial authority in\r\nthe land; and if any substantial point remains yet unsettled, I believe\r\nthere is no difficulty in presenting it to the proper tribunal.\r\n\r\nThis bill declares that certain lands which nearly twenty-four years ago\r\nthe United States entirely relinquished are still public lands, and\r\ndirects the Attorney-General to begin suits to assert and protect the\r\ntitle of the United States in such lands.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that these are public lands, the declaration that they are\r\nso by enactment is entirely unnecessary; and if they are wrongfully\r\nwithheld from the Government, the duty and authority of the\r\nAttorney-General are not aided by the proposed legislation. If they are\r\nnot public lands because the United States have conveyed them to others,\r\nthe bill is subject to grave objections as an attempt to destroy vested\r\nrights and disturb interests which have long since become fixed.\r\n\r\nIf a law of Congress could, in the manner contemplated by the bill,\r\nchange, under the Constitution, the existing rights of any of the\r\nparties claiming interests in these lands, it hardly seems that any new\r\nquestions could be presented to the courts which would do more than\r\nraise false hopes and renew useless and bitter strife and litigation.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that all controversies which can hereafter arise between\r\nthose claiming these lands have been fairly remitted to the State of\r\nIowa, and that there they can be properly and safely left; and the\r\nGovernment, through its Attorney-General, should not be called upon to\r\nlitigate the rights of private parties.\r\n\r\nIt is not pleasant to contemplate loss threatened to any party acting\r\nin good faith, caused by uncertainty in the language of laws or their\r\nconflicting interpretation; and if there are persons occupying these\r\nlands who labor under such disabilities as prevent them from appealing\r\nto the courts for a redress of their wrongs, a plain statute, directed\r\nsimply to a remedy for such disabilities, would not be objectionable.\r\n\r\nShould there be meritorious cases of hardship and loss, caused by an\r\ninvitation on the part of the Government to settle upon lands apparently\r\npublic, but to which no right or lawful possession can be secured, it\r\nwould be better, rather than to attempt a disturbance of titles already\r\nsettled, to ascertain such losses and do equity by compensating the\r\nproper parties through an appropriation for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA law to accomplish this very object was passed by Congress in the year\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nValuable proof is thus furnished, by the only law ever passed upon the\r\nsubject, of the manner in which it was thought proper by the Congress\r\nat that time to meet the difficulties suggested by the bill now under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that there may be parties in the occupancy\r\nof these lands who suffer hardship by the application of strict legal\r\nprinciples to their claims, safety lies in noninterference by Congress\r\nwith matters which should be left to judicial cognizance; and I am\r\nunwilling to concur in legislation which, if not an encroachment upon\r\njudicial power, trenches so closely thereon as to be of doubtful\r\nexpediency, and which at the same time increases the elements of\r\nlitigation that have heretofore existed and endangers vested rights.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 26, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return Senate bill No. 349, entitled \"An act for the\r\npromotion of anatomical science and to prevent the desecration of\r\ngraves,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this bill is to permit the delivery of certain dead\r\nbodies to the medical colleges located in the District of Columbia for\r\ndissection.\r\n\r\nSuch disposition of the bodies of unknown and pauper dead is only\r\nexcused by the necessity of acquiring by this means proper and useful\r\nanatomical knowledge, and the laws by which it is permitted should, in\r\ndeference to a decent and universal sentiment, carefully guard against\r\nabuse and needless offense.\r\n\r\nThe measure under consideration does not with sufficient care specify\r\nand limit the officers and the parties who it is proposed to invest\r\nwith discretion in the disposition of dead bodies remaining in the\r\ninstitutions and places mentioned in the bill. The second section\r\nindicates an intention to prevent the use of said bodies for any other\r\npurpose than the promotion of anatomical and surgical knowledge within\r\nthe District of Columbia, and to secure after such use the decent burial\r\nof the remains. It declares that a bond shall be given providing for the\r\nperformance of these conditions. But instead of exacting the bond from\r\nthe medical colleges, to which alone, by the terms of the first section,\r\nthe bodies are to be delivered, such bond is required of \"every\r\nphysician or surgeon before receiving such dead body.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill also provides that a relative by blood or marriage, or a\r\nfriend, may, within forty-eight hours after death, demand that any body\r\nbe buried, upon satisfying \"the authorities\" of the relationship claimed\r\nto the deceased.\r\n\r\nThe \"authorities\" to be thus satisfied should be clearly defined, and\r\nthe determination of a question so important should be left with those\r\nonly who will perform this duty with proper care and consideration.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 30, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval Senate bill No. 141, entitled \"An\r\nact to extend the provisions of the act of June 10, 1880, entitled 'An\r\nact to amend the statutes in relation to immediate transportation of\r\ndutiable goods, and for other purposes,' to the port of Omaha, in the\r\nState of Nebraska.\"\r\n\r\nThe statute, which was passed June 10, 1880, referred to in the title of\r\nthis bill permitted certain merchandise imported at specified ports, but\r\nwhich was consigned to certain other ports which were mentioned by name\r\nin the seventh section of said act, to be shipped immediately after\r\nentry at the port of arrival to such destination.\r\n\r\nThe seventh section of said act contained the names of more than seventy\r\nports or places to which imported merchandise might be thus immediately\r\nshipped. One of the places thus named is \"Omaha, in Nebraska.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was declared in a proviso which was made a part of this section\r\nthat the privilege of immediate transportation contemplated by the act\r\nshould \"not extend to any place at which there are not the necessary\r\nofficers for the appraisement of merchandise and the collection of\r\nduties.\"\r\n\r\nBecause there were no such officers at Omaha the privilege mentioned was\r\nwithheld from that place by the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nThe bill submitted to me for approval provides that these privileges\r\nconferred by the act of June 10, 1880, be \"extended to the port of\r\nOmaha, in the State of Nebraska, as provided for as to the ports\r\nmentioned in section 7 of said act.\"\r\n\r\nI can not see that anything is gained by this legislation.\r\n\r\nIf the circumstances should warrant such a course, the authority which\r\nwithholds such privileges from any of the places mentioned in the law of\r\n1880 can confer the same without the aid of a new statute. This position\r\nis sustained by an opinion of the Attorney-General, dated in February,\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nIf the legislation now proposed should become operative, the privileges\r\nextended to the city of Omaha would still be subject to the proviso\r\nattached to the seventh section of the law of 1880, and such newly\r\ngranted privileges would be liable to immediate withdrawal by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThus, if the design of this bill is to restore to the city named the\r\nprivileges permitted by the law of 1880, it seems to be entirely\r\nunnecessary, since the power of such restoration is now fully vested\r\nin the Treasury Department. If the object sought is to bestow such\r\nprivileges entirely free from the operation of the proviso above\r\nrecited, the language of the bill does not accomplish that result.\r\n\r\nI understand that the Government has not now at Omaha \"the necessary\r\nofficers for the appraisement of merchandise and the collection of\r\nduties,\" which by such proviso are necessary in order to secure to any\r\nplace the advantages of immediate transportation. In the absence of such\r\nofficers the proposed legislation would be nugatory and inoperative.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 8, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval a bill numbered 3019, entitled \"An\r\nact to increase the pension of Abigail Smith,\" which bill originated in\r\nthe House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThis proposed legislation does injustice to a very worthy pensioner who\r\nwas on the pension roll at the time of the passage of the law which\r\ntook effect on the 19th day of March last, and by virtue of which all\r\npensions of her class were increased from $8 to $12 per month. Under\r\nthis law she became entitled to her increased pension from the date of\r\nits passage. The bill now returned allows her the same amount, but if it\r\nbecame a law I suppose it would supersede her claim under the previous\r\nstatute and postpone the receipt by her of the increase to the date of\r\nthe passage of the new law.\r\n\r\nShe would thus lose for nearly two months the increase of pension\r\nalready secured to her.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 8, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval House bill No. 1471, entitled \"An act\r\nincreasing the pension of Andrew J. Hill.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill doubles the pension which the person named therein has been\r\nreceiving for a number of years. It appears from the report of the\r\ncommittee to which the bill was referred that a claim made by him for\r\nincreased pension has been lately rejected by the Pension Bureau \"on the\r\nground that the claimant is now receiving a pension commensurate with\r\nthe degree of disability found to exist.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy of frequently reversing by special enactment the decisions\r\nof the Bureau invested by law with the examination of pension claims,\r\nfully equipped for such examination, and which ought not to be suspected\r\nof any lack of liberality to our veteran soldiers, is exceedingly\r\nquestionable. It may well be doubted if a committee of Congress has a\r\nbetter opportunity than such an agency to judge of the merits of these\r\nclaims. If, however, there is any lack of power in the Pension Bureau\r\nfor a full investigation, it should be supplied; if the system adopted\r\nis inadequate to do full justice to claimants, it should be corrected,\r\nand if there is a want of sympathy and consideration for the defenders\r\nof our Government the Bureau should be reorganized.\r\n\r\nThe disposition to concede the most generous treatment to the disabled,\r\naged, and needy among our veterans ought not to be restrained; and it\r\nmust be admitted that in some cases justice and equity can not be done\r\nnor the charitable tendencies of the Government in favor of worthy\r\nobjects of its care indulged under fixed rules. These conditions\r\nsometimes justify a resort to special legislation, but I am convinced\r\nthat the interposition by special enactment in the granting of pensions\r\nshould be rare and exceptional. In the nature of things if this is\r\nlightly done and upon slight occasion, an invitation is offered for the\r\npresentation of claims to Congress which upon their merits could not\r\nsurvive the test of an examination by the Pension Bureau, and whose\r\nonly hope of success depends upon sympathy, often misdirected, instead\r\nof right and justice. The instrumentality organized by law for the\r\ndetermination of pension claims is thus often overruled and discredited,\r\nand there is danger that in the end popular prejudice will be created\r\nagainst those who are worthily entitled to the bounty of the Government.\r\n\r\nThere has lately been presented to me, on the same day, for approval,\r\nnearly 240 special bills granting and increasing pensions and restoring\r\nto the pension list the names of parties which for cause have been\r\ndropped. To aid Executive duty they were referred to the Pension Bureau\r\nfor examination and report. After a delay absolutely necessary they have\r\nbeen returned to me within a few hours of the limit constitutionally\r\npermitted for Executive action. Two hundred and thirty-two of these\r\nbills are thus classified:\r\n\r\nEighty-one cover cases in which favorable action by the Pension Bureau\r\nwas denied by reason of the insufficiency of the testimony filed to\r\nprove the facts alleged.\r\n\r\nThese bills I have approved on the assumption that the claims were\r\nmeritorious and that by the passage of the bills the Government has\r\nwaived full proof of the facts.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six of the bills cover claims rejected by the Pension Bureau\r\nbecause the evidence produced tended to prove that the alleged\r\ndisability existed before the claimant's enlistment; 21 cover claims\r\nwhich have been denied by such Bureau because the evidence tended to\r\nshow that the disability, though contracted in the service, was not\r\nincurred in the line of duty; 33 cover claims which have been denied\r\nbecause the evidence tended to establish that the disability originated\r\nafter the soldier's discharge from the Army; 47 cover claims which have\r\nbeen denied because the general pension laws contain no provisions under\r\nwhich they could be allowed, and 24 of the claims have never been\r\npresented to the Pension Bureau.\r\n\r\nI estimate the expenditure involved in these bills at more than $35,000\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThough my conception of public duty leads me to the conclusion, upon the\r\nslight examination which I have been able to give such of these bills as\r\nare not comprised in the first class above mentioned, that many of them\r\nshould be disapproved, I am utterly unable to submit within the time\r\nallowed me for that purpose my objections to the same.\r\n\r\nThey will therefore become operative without my approval.\r\n\r\nA sufficient reason for the return of the particular bill now under\r\nconsideration is found in the fact that it provides that the name of\r\nAndrew J. Hill be placed upon the pension roll, while the records of the\r\nPension Bureau, as well as a medical certificate made a part of the\r\ncommittee's report, disclose that the correct name of the intended\r\nbeneficiary is Alfred J. Hill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 17, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1397, entitled \"An act to\r\nestablish a port of delivery at Springfield, in the State of\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the best reasons urged for the passage of this bill are\r\nthat Springfield has a population of about 40,000, that the imports to\r\nthe section of country where the city is located for the last year\r\namounted in value to nearly $3,000,000, and that the importers at this\r\npoint labored under a disadvantage in being obliged to go to New York\r\nand Boston to clear their goods, which are frequently greatly delayed.\r\n\r\nThe Government is now subjected to great loss of revenue through the\r\nintricacies of the present system relating to the collection of customs\r\ndues, and through the frauds and evasions which that system permits and\r\ninvites. It is also the cause of much of the delay and vexation to which\r\nthe honest importer is subjected.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that the reforms of present methods which have been\r\nlately earnestly pressed upon Congress should be inaugurated, instead of\r\nincreasing the number of ports where present evils may be further\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThe bill now under consideration provides that a surveyor of customs\r\nshall be appointed to reside at said port, who shall receive a salary\r\nnot to exceed $1,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that an experienced force of employees at the ports\r\nwhere goods for Springfield are entered would be much better qualified\r\nto adjust the duties upon the same than the person thus proposed to be\r\nadded to the vast army of Federal officials.\r\n\r\nThere are many cities in the different States having larger populations\r\nthan Springfield, and fully as much entitled, upon every ground\r\npresented, to the advantages sought by this bill; and yet it is clear\r\nthat the following of the precedent which the proposed legislation would\r\nestablish could not fail to produce confusion and uncertainty in the\r\nadjustment of customs dues, leading to irritating discriminations and\r\nprobable loss to the Government.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 24, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 2186, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Louis Melcher.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant enlisted on the 25th day of May, 1861, and was discharged\r\nfor disability on the 16th day of August, 1861, having been in the\r\nservice less than three months.\r\n\r\nThe certificate of the surgeon of his regiment, made at the time of his\r\ndischarge, stated his disability to be \"lameness, caused by previous\r\nrepeated and extensive ulcerations of his legs, extending deeply among\r\nthe muscles and impairing their powers and action by cicatrices, all\r\nexisting before enlistment and not mentioned to the mustering officers\r\nat the time.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this certificate, given at the time of the claimant's discharge and\r\nwhile he was actually under the surgeon's observation, an application\r\nfor a pension was rejected by the Pension Bureau.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of anything impeaching the ability and integrity of the\r\nsurgeon of the regiment, his certificate should, in my opinion, be\r\nregarded as a true statement of the condition of the claimant at the\r\ntime of his discharge, though the committee's report suggests that the\r\nsurgeon's skill may have been at fault when he declared that the ulcers\r\nexisted before enlistment. The cicatrices showing beyond a doubt the\r\nprevious existence of this difficulty would be plainly apparent upon an\r\nexamination by a surgeon, and their origin could hardly be mistaken.\r\nThe term of the claimant's service was not sufficiently long to have\r\ndeveloped and healed, even imperfectly, in a location previously\r\nhealthy, ulcers of the kind mentioned in the claimant's application.\r\n\r\nMy approval of this bill is therefore withheld upon the ground that I\r\nfind nothing in my examination of the facts connected with the case\r\nwhich impeaches the value of the surgeon's certificate upon which the\r\nadverse action of the Pension Bureau was predicated.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 24, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA bill which originated in the Senate, entitled \"An act granting a\r\npension to Edward Ayers,\" and numbered 363, is herewith returned without\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe person named in this bill enlisted October 3, 1861, in an Indiana\r\nregiment and was mustered out of the service December 13, 1865. He\r\nrepresents that he was injured in the hip at the battle of Days Gap,\r\nApril 30, 1863, and for this a pension is provided for him by the bill\r\nunder consideration. His application for pension has been rejected by\r\nthe Pension Bureau on the ground that it was proved on a special\r\nexamination of the case that the claimant was injured by a fall when a\r\nboy, and that the injury complained of existed prior to his enlistment.\r\n\r\nThere is not a particle of proof or a fact stated either in the\r\ncommittee's report or the records in the Pension Bureau, so far as they\r\nare brought to my notice, tending to show that the claimant was in\r\nhospital or under medical care a single day during the whole term of his\r\nenlistment.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee contains the following statement:\r\n\r\n  The record evidence proves that he was in this engagement, but there is\r\n  no proof from this source that he was wounded. By numerous comrades who\r\n  were present it is proven that he was hurt by the explosion of a shell\r\n  as claimed. It is also shown that he has been disabled ever since; and\r\n  the examining surgeon specifically describes the wound, and twice\r\n  verifies that he is permanently disabled. From the fact that a man was\r\n  exceedingly liable to injury under the circumstances in which he was\r\n  placed, and from the evidence of eyewitnesses, the committee are of\r\n  opinion that he was wounded as alleged.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wound from a shell causing the person injured to be \"disabled ever\r\nsince\" usually results in hospital or medical treatment. Not only is\r\nthere no such claim made in this case, but, on the contrary, it appears\r\nthat the claimant served in his regiment two years and nearly eight\r\nmonths after the alleged injury, and until he was mustered out.\r\n\r\nIt is represented to me by a report from the Pension Bureau that after\r\nhis alleged wound, and in May or June, 1863, the claimant deserted, and\r\nin July of that year was arrested in the State of Indiana and returned\r\nto duty without trial. If this report is correct, the party now seeking\r\na pension at the hands of the Government for disability incurred in the\r\nservice seems to have been capable of considerable physical exertion,\r\nthough not very creditable, within a few weeks after he claims to have\r\nreceived the injury upon which his application is based.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 24, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1630, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James C. Chandler.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the committee to whom this bill was\r\nreferred and from an examination of the official records that the\r\nproposed beneficiary first enlisted on the 27th day of August, 1861,\r\nand about nine months thereafter, on the 1st day of June, 1862, was\r\ndischarged on account of disability arising from chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the chronic character of his alleged disability, he\r\nenlisted again on the 3d day of January, 1864, seventeen months after\r\nsuch discharge.\r\n\r\nNo statement is presented of the bounty received by him upon either\r\nenlistment.\r\n\r\nHe was finally mustered out on the 19th day of September, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe first applied for a pension under the general law in May, 1869,\r\nalleging that in April, 1862, he was run over by a wagon and injured\r\nin his ankle. This accident occurred during his first enlistment; but\r\ninstead of the injury having been then regarded a disability, he was\r\ndischarged from such enlistment less than two months thereafter on\r\naccount of chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the committee's report that his application was rejected\r\nand that another was afterwards made, alleging that the claimant had\r\nbeen afflicted with typhoid fever contracted in May, 1862, resulting in\r\n\"rheumatism and disease of the back in region of kidneys.\"\r\n\r\nThis application was also rejected, on the ground that any disability\r\nthat might have arisen from the cause alleged \"had not existed in a\r\npensionable degree since the date of filing the claim therefor,\" which\r\nwas February 10, 1885.\r\n\r\nThere still remained an appeal to Congress, and probably there were not\r\nwanting those who found their interests in advising such an appeal and\r\nwho had at hand Congressional precedents which promised a favorable\r\nresult. That the parties interested did not miscalculate the chances\r\nof success is demonstrated by the bill now before me, which, in direct\r\nopposition to the action of the Pension Bureau, grants a pension to\r\na man who, though discharged from enlistment for a certain alleged\r\ndisability, made two applications for a pension based upon two distinct\r\ncauses, both claimed to exist within two months prior to such discharge,\r\nand both different from the one upon which he accepted the same, and\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the proposed beneficiary, after all these\r\ndisabilities had occurred, passed an examination as to his physical\r\nfitness for reenlistment, actually did reenlist, and served till finally\r\nmustered out at the close of the war.\r\n\r\nIf any money is to be given this man from the public Treasury, it should\r\nnot be done under the guise of a pension.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 24, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 857, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Dudley B. Branch.\"\r\n\r\nThis claim is based upon the allegation, as appears by the committee's\r\nreport, that the person named in the bill has a hernia, and that on the\r\n9th day of June, 1862, while in the military service and in the line of\r\nduty, \"in getting over a fence he fell heavily, striking a stone or hard\r\nsubstance, and received the hernia in his left side.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1875, thirteen and a half years thereafter, he filed an\r\napplication for a pension, which was rejected by the Pension Bureau on\r\nthe ground that there was no record of the alleged hernia, and the\r\nclaimant was unable to furnish satisfactory evidence of its origin in\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nThe fact is stated in the committee's report that late in the year 1863\r\nthis soldier was transferred to the Invalid Corps, and the records show\r\nthat he was thus transferred for a disability entirely different from\r\nthat upon which he now bases his claim. He was mustered out in\r\nSeptember, 1864, at the end of his term of service.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the rejection of this claim by the Pension Bureau\r\nwas correct, and think its action should not be reversed.\r\n\r\nI suppose an injury of the description claimed, if caused by violence\r\ndirectly applied, is quite palpable, its effect usually immediate, and\r\nits existence easily proved. The long time which elapsed between the\r\ninjury and the claimant's application for a pension may be fairly\r\nconsidered as bearing upon the merits of such application, while the\r\nfact that the claimant was transferred to the Invalid Corps more than\r\na year after he alleges the injury occurred, for an entirely different\r\ndisability, can not be overlooked. In the committee's report the\r\nstatement is found that the beneficiary named in the bill was in two\r\ndifferent hospitals during the year 1863, and yet it is not claimed that\r\nthe history of his hospital treatment furnishes any proof of the injury\r\nupon which his claim is now based.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 25, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1998, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of John D. Ham,\" which grants a pension to the party named.\r\n\r\nThe claimant alleges that he enrolled in the Army in January, 1862,\r\nand was \"sworn in at his own home;\" that the next day he started on\r\nhorseback to go to the regiment he was to join, and that on the way his\r\nhorse fell upon his left ankle, whereby he sustained an injury which\r\nentitles him to a pension.\r\n\r\nHis name is not borne upon any of the rolls of the regiment he alleges\r\nhe was on his way to join.\r\n\r\nHe filed his application for pension in the Pension Bureau October 17,\r\n1879 (seventeen years after his alleged injury), which was rejected\r\napparently on the ground that he was not in the military service when\r\nthe disability claimed was incurred.\r\n\r\nHe was drafted in 1863 and served until he was mustered out in 1865.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely clear that this claimant was not in the military service\r\nat the time he claims to have been injured; and his conduct in remaining\r\nat home until he was drafted, nearly two years afterwards, furnishes\r\nproof that he did not regard himself as in the meantime owing any\r\nmilitary duty. These considerations, and the further facts that upon\r\nbeing drafted he was accepted as physically qualified for service, that\r\nhe actually thereafter served a year and eight months, and that he\r\nwaited seventeen years before claiming pension for his injury, in my\r\nmind present a case upon which the claimant is entitled to no relief\r\neven if charity instead of just liberality is invoked.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 25, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 1290, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to David W. Hamilton.\"\r\n\r\nA claim for pension filed by him in November, 1879, was rejected by the\r\nPension Bureau on the ground that his alleged disability existed prior\r\nto his enlistment.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the records in the Adjutant-General's Office and\r\na statement from the Pension Bureau derived from the claimant's\r\napplication there for pension, with a reference to the report of the\r\ncommittee to whom this bill was referred, disclose the following facts:\r\n\r\nThe claimant was mustered in the service as first lieutenant in\r\nSeptember, 1861, and as captain June 12, 1862. He is reported as present\r\nwith his company until the 30th of that month. For the six months\r\nimmediately following the latter date he is reported as \"absent sick,\"\r\nand for the ten months next succeeding, and until October 27, 1863, as\r\n\"absent on detached service.\" On the day last mentioned he tendered his\r\nresignation at Camp Morton, in the State of Indiana, to enable him to\r\naccept an appointment as captain in the Invalid Corps. He was thereupon\r\nso appointed upon account of \"chronic enlargement of the spermatic cord\r\nof several years' standing, consequent upon hydrocele.\" He remained in\r\nthe Invalid Corps until July 12, 1864, when, upon the tender of his\r\nresignation, he was discharged.\r\n\r\nLess than four months afterwards, and on the 6th day of November, 1864,\r\nhe was mustered in the service as a captain in another regiment of\r\nvolunteers, and on the 17th day of November, 1865, again tendered his\r\nresignation, and was finally discharged.\r\n\r\nUpon his application for pension under the general law, fourteen years\r\nthereafter, he admitted that he suffered from hydrocele as early as\r\n1856, but claimed that an operation then performed for the same had\r\ngiven him permanent relief.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the claimant's term of service was liberally\r\ninterspersed with sick leave, detached service, resignations, and\r\nmembership in the Invalid Corps. He admits having the trouble which\r\nwould naturally result in his alleged disability long before he entered\r\nthe service. The surgeon upon whose certificate he was appointed to the\r\nInvalid Corps must have stated to him the character of his difficulty\r\nand that it was chronic. No application for pension was made until\r\nfourteen years after his discharge and just prior to the expiration of\r\nthe time within which large arrearages might have been claimed. There is\r\nno hint of any medical testimony at all contradicting the certificate of\r\nthe army surgeon made in 1863, but it is stated in the report of the\r\ncommittee that he can not procure medical testimony as to his soundness\r\nbefore entering the service because his family physician is dead. If he\r\nhad filed his application earlier, it would have appeared in better\r\nfaith, and it may be that he could have secured the evidence of his\r\nfamily physician if it was of the character he desired.\r\n\r\nAfter the Pension Bureau has been in operation for a score of years\r\nsince the late civil war, equipped with thousands of employees charged\r\nwith no other duty except the ascertainment and adjustment of the claims\r\nof our discharged soldiers and their surviving relatives, it seems\r\nto me that a stronger case than this should be presented to justify\r\nthe passage of a special act, twenty-three years after an alleged\r\ndisability, granting a pension which has been refused by the Bureau\r\nespecially organized for the purpose of allowing the same under just\r\nand liberal laws.\r\n\r\nI am by no means insensible to that influence which leads the judgment\r\ntoward the allowance of every claim alleged to be founded upon patriotic\r\nservice in the nation's cause; and yet I neither believe it to be a duty\r\nnor a kindness to the worthy citizens for whose benefit our scheme of\r\npensions was provided to permit the diversion of the nation's bounty to\r\nobjects not within its scope and purpose.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 1850, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mrs. Annie C. Owen.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the claimant was mustered into the service as second\r\nlieutenant December 14, 1861, and discharged October 16, 1862. It\r\nappears that he died in 1876 from neuralgia of the heart. In 1883 the\r\npresent claimant filed her application for pension, alleging that her\r\nhusband received two shell wounds, one in the calf of his left leg and\r\none in his left side, on the 1st day of July, 1862, and claiming that\r\nthey were in some way connected with the cause of his death.\r\n\r\nOn the records of his command there is no mention made of either wound,\r\nbut it does appear that on the 8th day of July, seven days after the\r\ndate of the alleged wounds, he was granted a leave of absence for thirty\r\ndays on account, as stated in a medical certificate, of \"remittent fever\r\nand diarrhea.\" A medical certificate dated August 5, 1862, while absent\r\non leave, represents him to be at that time suffering from \"chronic\r\nbronchitis and acute dysentery.\"\r\n\r\nThe application made for pension by the widow was rejected by the\r\nPension Bureau February 1, 1886.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing before me showing that the husband of the claimant ever\r\nfiled an application for pension, though he lived nearly fourteen years\r\nafter his discharge; and his widow's claim was not made until twenty-one\r\nyears after the alleged wounds and seven years after her husband's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIf the information furnished concerning this soldier's service is\r\ncorrect, this claim for pension must be based upon a mistake. It is\r\nhardly possible that wounds such as are alleged should be received in\r\nbattle by a second lieutenant and no record made of them; that he should\r\nseven days thereafter receive a leave of absence for other sickness,\r\nwith no mention of these wounds, and that a medical certificate should\r\nbe made (probably with a view of prolonging his leave) stating still\r\nother ailments, but silent as to wounds. The further facts that he made\r\nno claim for pension and that the claim of his widow was long delayed\r\nare worthy of consideration. And if the wounds were received as\r\ndescribed there is certainly no necessary connection between them and\r\ndeath fourteen years afterwards from neuralgia of the heart.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval a bill originating in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, numbered 2145, and entitled \"An act for the relief of\r\nRebecca Eldridge.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill provides for the payment of a pension to the claimant as the\r\nwidow of Wilber H. Eldridge, who was mustered into the service on the\r\n24th day of July, 1862, and discharged June 21, 1865. He was pensioned\r\nat the rate of $2 per month for a slight wound in the calf of the left\r\nleg, received on the 25th day of March, 1865. There is no pretense that\r\nthis wound was at all serious, and a surgeon who examined it in 1880\r\nreported that in his opinion the wounded man \"was not incapacitated from\r\nobtaining his subsistence by manual labor;\" that the ball passed \"rather\r\nsuperficially through the muscles,\" and that the party examined said\r\nthere was no lameness \"unless after long standing or walking a good\r\ndeal.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1881, while working about a building, he fell\r\nbackward from a ladder and fractured his skull, from which he died the\r\nsame day.\r\n\r\nWithout a particle of proof and with no fact established which connects\r\nthe fatal accident in the remotest degree with the wound referred to, it\r\nis proposed to grant a pension to the widow of $12 per month.\r\n\r\nIt is not a pleasant thing to interfere in such a case; but we are\r\ndealing with pensions, and not with gratuities.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 1253, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to J.D.

Bangham.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant in this case is the widow of John S. Bangham, who was\r\nmustered into the service of the United States as a private on the 26th\r\nday of March, 1864, and was discharged by general order June 23, 1865.\r\n\r\nIt appears that during his fifteen months of service he was sick a\r\nconsiderable part of the time, and the records in two of the hospitals\r\nto which he was admitted show that his sickness was epilepsy. There are\r\nno records showing the character of his illness in other hospitals.\r\n\r\nHis widow, the present claimant, filed an application for pension March\r\n12, 1878, alleging that her husband committed suicide September 10,\r\n1873, from the effects of chronic diarrhea and general debility\r\ncontracted in the service. Upon the evidence then produced her claim was\r\nallowed at the rate of $8 a month. She remained upon the rolls until\r\nJuly, 1885, when a special examination of the case was made, upon which\r\nit was developed and admitted by the pensioner that the deceased soldier\r\nhad suffered from epilepsy from early childhood, and that during a\r\ndespondent mood following an epileptic fit he committed suicide.\r\n\r\nUpon these facts it was determined by the Pension Bureau that the\r\npension should not have been granted, and it was withdrawn. It was so\r\nsatisfactorily proven that the disease which indirectly caused the death\r\nof the claimant's husband was not contracted in the service that, in my\r\nopinion, the conclusion arrived at on such examination should stand.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval bill No. 1406, which originated in the\r\nHouse of Representatives and is entitled \"An act granting a pension to\r\nSimmons W. Harden.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant mentioned in this bill enlisted as a private December 30,\r\n1863, and was discharged May 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe filed an application for pension in 1866, in which he alleged that\r\nhe was injured in the left side by a fall from a wagon while in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he filed another application, in which he claimed that he was\r\nafflicted with an enlargement of the lungs and heart from overexertion\r\nat a review. His record in the Army makes no mention of either of these\r\ntroubles, but does show that he had at some time during his service\r\ndyspepsia and intermittent fever.\r\n\r\nThe fact that fourteen years elapsed after he claimed to have been\r\ninjured by a fall from a wagon before he discovered that enlargement of\r\nthe lungs and heart was his real difficulty is calculated to at least\r\nraise a doubt as to the validity of his claim.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to his condition at the time of enlistment, as well as\r\nsince, seems quite contradictory and unsatisfactory. The committee to\r\nwhich the bill was referred report that \"the only question in the case\r\nis as to his condition at time of enlistment, and the evidence is so\r\nflatly contradictory on that point that it is impossible to decide that\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this declaration, it is proposed to allow him a pension\r\nof $16 a month, though he has survived all his ailments long enough to\r\nreach the age of 72 years.\r\n\r\nI think upon the case presented the action of the Pension Bureau\r\noverruling his claim should not be reversed.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 1, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith Senate bill No. 1441, entitled \"An act granting a\r\npension to M. Romahn.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted September 13, 1862, and was\r\ndischarged May 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe filed his claim in the Pension Bureau December 5, 1882, alleging\r\nthat in the winter of 1862, from being put on duty--standing guard\r\nexcessively--he became afflicted with varicose veins. His army record\r\nshows no disability of any kind, though he served more than two years\r\nafter the date at which he alleges his injury was incurred. His\r\napplication was rejected on the ground that no record of his disability\r\nappeared and that the evidence of the same filed upon such application\r\nwas insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe claim now made to Congress for relief is the same as that made to\r\nthe Pension Bureau, with the allegation added that in May, 1865, his\r\nbreast and shoulder were injured by a railroad accident while he was on\r\ndetail duty.\r\n\r\nIf the latter-described injury really existed, it is exceeding strange\r\nthat it found no place in his claim before the Pension Bureau, while the\r\naccount given of the cause of his alleged varicose veins must surprise\r\nthose who are at all familiar with the character of that difficulty and\r\nthe routine of army service. His continued performance of military\r\nduty after he incurred this infirmity, the fact that he made no claim\r\nfor pension on that account until twenty years had passed, and the\r\nunsatisfactory evidence now produced to support his allegation tend\r\nto induce the suspicion that the decision of the Pension Bureau was\r\nentirely just and that this bill is not based upon substantial merits.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 2, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nSenate bill No. 789, entitled \"An act granting a pension to John S.\r\nWilliams,\" is herewith returned without approval.\r\n\r\nThis claimant enlisted in 1861.

He served afterwards until 1865 and was discharged. His claim\r\nfor pension was rejected by the Pension Bureau in 1882, twenty years\r\nafter the time he fixes as the date of his injury; and after such long\r\ndelay he states as an excuse for the unsatisfactory nature of his proof\r\nthat the doctors, surgeons, and officers who knew him are dead.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the injury complained of is merely a dislocation of the\r\nshoulder, and in view of the other facts developed in the case, I think\r\nthe Pension Bureau arrived at a correct conclusion when this claim was\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 2, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 327, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to James E. O'Shea.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the committee to whom this bill was referred I learn\r\nthat the claimant enlisted in April, 1861, and was discharged in\r\nOctober, 1864.\r\n\r\nHe filed a claim in the Pension Bureau alleging that he received a saber\r\nwound in the head March 7, 1862, and a gunshot wound in the left leg in\r\nthe autumn of the same year.\r\n\r\nIt appears upon examination of his military record that there is no\r\nmention of either disability, and that he served two years after the\r\ntime he claims to have received these injuries. So far from being\r\ndisabled, it is reported as an incident of his army life that in the\r\nyear 1864 this soldier was found guilty of desertion and sentenced to\r\nforfeit all pay and allowances for the time he was absent.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee, in apparent explanation of the lack of any\r\nofficial mention of the injuries alleged, declares that \"the fact that\r\nthe records of the War Department are often imperfect works great\r\nhardship to men who apply for pensions;\" and his conviction of desertion\r\nand the lack of proof to sustain his allegations as to his injuries are\r\ndisposed of as follows in the committee's report:\r\n\r\n  The Adjutant-General's report shows that the man was under discipline\r\n  for some irregularities, but notwithstanding this and the lack of the\r\n  required proof that he was wounded in the line of duty the committee are\r\n  of the opinion that, situated as he was, he was very liable to and very\r\n  probably did receive the wound from which he has suffered and is still\r\n  suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am convinced that there exists serious difficulty on the part of the\r\nclaimant instead of in the record of the War Department; that the kind\r\nof irregularity for which he was under discipline is calculated to\r\nproduce a lack of confidence in his merits as a pensioner, and that the\r\nfact of his situation being such as to render him liable to receive a\r\nwound is hardly sufficient to establish his right to a soldier's\r\npension, which is only justified by injuries actually received and\r\naffirmatively proven.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 2, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 1726, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Augustus Field Stevens.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that this claimant enlisted August 21, 1861, and was\r\ndischarged on the 3d day of October, 1861, after a service of less than\r\ntwo months, upon a medical certificate of disability which represented\r\nhim as \"incapable of performing the duties of a soldier because of\r\ngeneral debility, advanced age, unfit for service before entering.\"\r\n\r\nHis claim is not based upon any wound or injury, but he alleges that\r\nhe contracted chronic diarrhea or dysentery while in the service. The\r\ncommittee to whom the bill was referred by the Senate admit that \"there\r\nis a quantity of contradictory testimony, biased in about equal\r\nproportion for and against the claimant.\"\r\n\r\nHis claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau in 1882 and again in 1885,\r\nafter a special examination concerning the facts, on the ground that the\r\nclaimant had failed to show any pensionable disability contracted while\r\nhe was in the service.\r\n\r\nThe medical certificate upon which he was discharged makes no mention\r\nof the disorders of which the applicant for pension now complains, but\r\ncontains other statements which demonstrate that no allowance should\r\nbe made to him by way of pension, unless such pension is to be openly\r\nand confessedly regarded as a mere charity, or unless the medical\r\ncertificate made at the time of discharge, with the patient under\r\nobservation, is to be, without any allegation to that effect, impeached.\r\n\r\nI am not prepared either to gratuitously set at naught two\r\ndeterminations of the Pension Bureau, one very lately made after a\r\nspecial examination, and especially when the evidence produced before\r\nthe committee to reverse the Bureau's action is admitted to be\r\n\"contradictory\" and \"biased in about equal proportion for and against\r\nthe claimant.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith Senate bill No. 226, entitled \"An act granting a\r\npension to Margaret D.

The application was rejected because of the\r\ninability to furnish evidence to prove that the death had any relation\r\nto the naval service of the deceased.\r\n\r\nI am unable to see how any other conclusion could have been reached. The\r\ninformation furnished by the report of the committee to whom this bill\r\nwas referred and derived from other data before me absolutely fails to\r\nconnect the death of Commodore Marchand with any incident of his naval\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis officer was undoubtedly brave and efficient, rendering his\r\ncountry valuable service; but it does not appear to have been of so\r\ndistinguished a character, nor are the circumstances of his widow\r\nalleged to be such, as to render a gratuity justifiable.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without my approval Senate bill No. 183, entitled \"An\r\nact for the relief of Thomas S.

He was sent to the Government hospital September 20, 1863, and\r\nthereupon transferred to the Invalid Corps.\r\n\r\nHe filed his declaration for a pension in November, 1880, alleging that\r\nwhile in the service he contracted malarial fever and chronic diarrhea,\r\nand was seized with convulsions, suffering from great general debility.\r\n\r\nA pension of $50 a month was granted to him in June, 1881, dating from\r\nthe time of filing his application, which sum he has been receiving up\r\nto the present time.\r\n\r\nThis bill proposes to remove the limitation fixed by the law of 1879\r\nprescribing the date prior to which an application for pension must be\r\nfiled in order to entitle the claimant to draw the pension allowed from\r\nthe time of his discharge from the service.\r\n\r\nIf this bill should become a law, it would entitle the claimant to about\r\n$9,000 of back pension. This is claimed upon the ground that the soldier\r\nwas so sick from the time of the passage of the act creating the\r\nlimitation up to the date allowed him to avail himself of the privileges\r\nof the act that he could not file his claim.\r\n\r\nI think the limitation thus fixed a very wise one, and that it should\r\nnot, in fairness to other claimants, be relaxed for causes not mentioned\r\nin the statute; nor should the door be opened to applications of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill had fifteen years after the accruing\r\nof his claim, and before it is alleged that he was incapacitated, within\r\nwhich he might have filed his application and entitled himself to the\r\nback pension now applied for.\r\n\r\nThe facts here presented come so far short of furnishing a satisfactory\r\nexcuse for his delay that, in my judgment, the discrimination asked in\r\nhis favor should not be granted.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 763, entitled \"An act for the\r\nerection of a public building at Sioux City, Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee of the House of Representatives to whom this\r\nbill was referred states that by the census of 1880 the population of\r\nSioux City was nearly 8,000, and that by other enumerations since made\r\nits population would seem to exceed 23,000. It is further stated in the\r\nreport that for the accommodation of this population the city contains\r\n393 brick and 2,984 frame buildings.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in the consideration of the merits of this bill the\r\nnecessities of the Government should control the question, and that it\r\nshould be decided as a business proposition, depending upon the needs of\r\na Government building at the point proposed in order to do the\r\nGovernment work.\r\n\r\nThis greatly reduces the value of statistics showing population, extent\r\nof business, prospective growth, and matters of that kind, which, though\r\nexceedingly interesting, do not always demonstrate the necessity of the\r\nexpenditure of a large sum of money for a public building.\r\n\r\nI find upon examination that United States courts are sometimes held\r\nat Sioux City, but that they have been thus far held in the county\r\ncourt-house without serious inconvenience and without any expense to the\r\nGovernment. There are actually no other Federal officers there for whom\r\nthe Government in any view should provide accommodations except the\r\npostmaster. The post-office is now located in a building rented by the\r\nGovernment until the 1st day of January, 1889, at the rate of $2,200 per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nBy the last report of the Supervising Architect it appears that on\r\nOctober 1, 1885, there were 80 new public buildings in course of\r\nconstruction, and that the amount expended thereon during the preceding\r\nyear was nearly $2,500,000, while large appropriations are asked to be\r\nexpended on these buildings during the current year.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the number of public buildings should not at this time be\r\nincreased unless a greater public necessity exists therefor than is\r\napparent in this case.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 206, entitled \"An act to\r\nprovide for the erection of a public building in the city of Zanesville,\r\nOhio.\"\r\n\r\nNo Federal courts are held at Zanesville, and there are no Government\r\nofficers located there who should be provided for at the public expense\r\nexcept the postmaster.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am informed the patrons of the post-office are fairly well\r\naccommodated in a building which is rented by the Government at the rate\r\nof $800 per annum; and though the postmaster naturally certifies that he\r\nand his fourteen employees require much more spacious surroundings, I\r\nhave no doubt he and they can be induced to continue to serve the\r\nGovernment in its present quarters.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings now in process of construction, numbering 80,\r\ninvolving constant supervision, are all the building projects which the\r\nGovernment ought to have on hand at one time, unless a very palpable\r\nnecessity exists for an increase in the number. The multiplication of\r\nthese structures involves not only the appropriations made for their\r\ncompletion, but great expense in their care and preservation thereafter.\r\n\r\nWhile a fine Government building is a desirable ornament to any town\r\nor city, and while the securing of an appropriation therefor is often\r\nconsidered as an illustration of zeal and activity in the interest of a\r\nconstituency, I am of the opinion that the expenditure of public money\r\nfor such a purpose should depend upon the necessity of such a building\r\nfor public uses.\r\n\r\nIn the case under consideration I have no doubt the Government can be\r\nwell accommodated for some time to come in all its business relations\r\nwith the people of Zanesville by renting quarters, at less expense than\r\nthe annual cost of maintaining the proposed new building after its\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 1990, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to John Hunter.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant was enrolled July 20, 1864, and was discharged by\r\nexpiration of his term of service July 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nDuring four months of the twelve while he remained in the service he is\r\nreported as \"absent sick.\" His hospital record shows that he was treated\r\nfor intermittent fever and rheumatism. In 1879, fourteen years after his\r\ndischarge, he filed his claim for a pension, alleging that in May, 1864,\r\nhe received a gunshot wound in the right leg while in a skirmish. The\r\nmonth of May, 1864, is included in the time during which, by the record,\r\nhe appears to have been absent sick and undergoing treatment for fever\r\nand rheumatism. His claim was rejected in December, 1884, on the ground\r\nthat there was no record of the alleged wound and the claimant was\r\nunable, though aided by the Bureau, to prove that the injury claimed was\r\ndue to the service.\r\n\r\nThe evidence recited in the report of the Congressional committee to\r\nwhom this bill was referred, though it tends to show, if reliable, that\r\nwhen the soldier returned from his service his leg was affected, fails\r\nto show a continuous disability from that cause. It is stated that about\r\nfive years ago, while the claimant was gathering dandelions, in stepping\r\nacross a ditch his leg broke. The doctor who attended him states that\r\nthe leg was about four weeks longer in uniting than is usual, but he is\r\nnot represented as giving an opinion that the fracture had anything to\r\ndo with his patient's military service.\r\n\r\nI find no reference to his condition since his recovery from the\r\nfracture of his leg, and there seems to be no allegation of present\r\ndisability either from army service or the injury sustained while\r\ngathering dandelions.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval House bill No. 4002, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Carter W. Tiller.\"\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department show that George W. Tiller, the son\r\nof the claimant, enlisted in a Kentucky regiment on the 8th day of\r\nOctober, 1861, and that he deserted on the 20th day of September, 1863;\r\nthat he was captured by the Confederates afterwards, but the time and\r\ncircumstances are not given. On the 21st day of July, 1864, he was\r\nadmitted to the Andersonville hospital, and died the same day of\r\nscorbutus.\r\n\r\nThe father filed his claim for a pension in 1877, alleging his\r\ndependence upon the deceased soldier. It is probably true that the son\r\nwhile in the Army sent money to the claimant, though he appears to have\r\nbeen employed as a policeman in the city of Louisville ever since his\r\nson's death, at a fair salary.\r\n\r\nThe claim thus made was rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground\r\nthat the claimant was not dependent upon his son.\r\n\r\nI am entirely satisfied of the correctness of this determination, and if\r\nthe records presented to me are reliable I think the fact which appears\r\ntherefrom, that the death of the soldier occurred ten months after\r\ndesertion and had no apparent relation to any service in the Union Army,\r\nis conclusive against the claim now made.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 3826, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of John Taylor.\"\r\n\r\nBy this bill it is proposed to increase the pension of the beneficiary\r\nnamed to $16 a month. He has been receiving a pension under the general\r\nlaw, dating from his discharge in 1865. His pension has been twice\r\nalready increased, once by the Pension Bureau and once by a special act\r\npassed in 1882. His wound is not such as to cause his disability to\r\nbecome aggravated by time. The increase allowed by this bill, when\r\napplied for at the Pension Bureau in 1885, was denied on the ground that\r\n\"the rate he was receiving was commensurate with the degree of his\r\ndisability, a board of surgeons having reported that he was receiving a\r\nliberal rating.\"\r\n\r\nI can discover no just ground for reversing this determination and\r\nmaking a further discrimination in favor of this pensioner.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5997, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Elizabeth Luce.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant named in this bill is the widow of John W. Luce, who\r\nentered the Army in August, 1861, and who was discharged in January,\r\n1864, for a disability declared at the time in the surgeon's certificate\r\nto arise from \"organic stricture of the urethra,\" which, from his\r\nstatement, existed at the time of his enlistment.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the admission which thus appears to have been made by\r\nhim at the time of his discharge, he soon afterwards made an application\r\nfor a pension, alleging that his difficulty arose from his being thrown\r\nforward on the pommel of his saddle when in the service.\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of this claim by a special examiner, it is stated\r\nthat no one could be found who had any knowledge of such an injury, and\r\nthe claim was rejected.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, twenty years after the soldier alleged he was injured in the\r\nmanner stated, he died, and the cause of his death was declared to be\r\n\"chronic gastritis, complicated with kidney difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that the examinations made by the Pension Bureau developed\r\nthe fact that the deceased soldier was a man of quite intemperate\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe theory upon which this widow should be pensioned can only be that\r\nthe death of her husband resulted from a disability or injury contracted\r\nor received in the military service. It seems to me that however\r\nsatisfactorily the injury which he described may be established, and\r\nthough every suspicion as to his habits be dismissed, there can hardly\r\npossibly be any connection between such an injury and the causes to\r\nwhich his death is attributed.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 19, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 4058, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Joel D.

He added to this allegation the further complaint that he\r\ncontracted rheumatism while in the service.\r\n\r\nThe application for a pension was rejected by the Pension Bureau because\r\nthere was no record of the disabilities claimed, nor was satisfactory\r\nproof furnished that any such disabilities originated in the service.\r\n\r\nI am so entirely satisfied with this determination of the Pension Bureau\r\nthat I am constrained to withhold my approval of this bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 21, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 3624, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Fred.

Farris,\" which bill is numbered 6136.\r\n\r\nThe claimant mentioned in this bill enlisted in the month of October,\r\n1861, and was mustered out of the service in August, 1865.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, sixteen years after his discharge, he filed an application\r\nfor a pension, alleging that he was afflicted with chronic diarrhea\r\ncontracted in the Army, and in 1885 his claim was allowed, and he was\r\ngranted a pension for that cause.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year, and after this pension was granted, he\r\nfiled an application for an increase of his rate, alleging that in 1884\r\nhis eyes became affected in consequence of his previous ailments and the\r\ndebility consequent thereupon.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity developed in the constant and persistent attacks upon\r\nthe public Treasury by those claiming pensions, and the increase of those\r\nalready granted, is exhibited in bold relief by this attempt to include\r\nsore eyes among the results of diarrhea.\r\n\r\nI am entirely satisfied with the opinion of the medical referee, who,\r\nafter examining this case in October, 1885, reported that \"the disease\r\nof the eyes can not be admitted to be a result of chronic diarrhea.\"\r\n\r\nOn all grounds it seems to me that this claimant should be contented\r\nwith the pension which has been already allowed him.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 21, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 1707, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Elijah P. Hensley.\"\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department show that this claimant was mustered\r\ninto the Third North Carolina Regiment, but on the muster-out roll of\r\nhis company he is reported to have deserted April 3, 1865, and there is\r\nno record of any discharge or disability.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1866, an order was issued from his department headquarters\r\nremoving the charge of desertion against him. Thirteen days afterwards,\r\nand on the 25th day of September, 1866, he filed an application for\r\npension, which in 1868 was granted. He drew such pension dating from\r\n1865 until 1877, when, upon evidence that the injury for which he was\r\npensioned was not received in the line of duty, his name was dropped\r\nfrom the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe pensioner appealed from this determination of the Pension Bureau to\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, who, as lately as May, 1885, rendered a\r\ndecision sustaining the action of the Bureau.\r\n\r\nI find nothing in the facts presented to me which, in my opinion,\r\njustifies the reversal of the judgment of the Bureau and the Secretary\r\nof the Interior.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 21, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2223, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Elizabeth S. De Krafft.\"\r\n\r\nMy objection to this bill is that it is of no possible advantage to the\r\nbeneficiary therein mentioned. It directs that her name be placed upon\r\nthe pension roll, subject to the provisions and limitations of the\r\npension laws. The effect of such legislation would be to permit Mrs. De\r\nKrafft to draw a pension at the rate of $30 each month from the date of\r\nthe approval of the bill.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of February, 1886, under the provisions of the general\r\npension law, she was allowed a pension of this exact sum, but the\r\npayments were to date from November 10, 1885.\r\n\r\nI am so thoroughly tired of disapproving gifts of public money to\r\nindividuals who in my view have no right or claim to the same,\r\nnotwithstanding apparent Congressional sanction, that I interpose with\r\na feeling of relief a veto in a case where I find it unnecessary to\r\ndetermine the merits of the application. In speaking of the promiscuous\r\nand ill-advised grants of pensions which have lately been presented to\r\nme for approval, I have spoken of their \"apparent Congressional\r\nsanction\" in recognition of the fact that a large proportion of these\r\nbills have never been submitted to a majority of either branch of\r\nCongress, but are the result of nominal sessions held for the express\r\npurpose of their consideration and attended by a small minority of the\r\nmembers of the respective Houses of the legislative branch of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThus in considering these bills I have not felt that I was aided by the\r\ndeliberate judgment of the Congress; and when I have deemed it my duty\r\nto disapprove many of the bills presented, I have hardly regarded my\r\naction as a dissent from the conclusions of the people's\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nI have not been insensible to the suggestions which should influence\r\nevery citizen, either in private station or official place, to exhibit\r\nnot only a just but a generous appreciation of the services of our\r\ncountry's defenders. In reviewing the pension legislation presented to\r\nme many bills have been approved upon the theory that every doubt should\r\nbe resolved in favor of the proposed beneficiary. I have not, however,\r\nbeen able to entirely divest myself of the idea that the public money\r\nappropriated for pensions is the soldiers' fund, which should be devoted\r\nto the indemnification of those who in the defense of the Union and in\r\nthe nation's service have worthily suffered, and who in the day of\r\ntheir dependence resulting from such suffering are entitled to the\r\nbenefactions of their Government. This reflection lends to the bestowal\r\nof pensions a kind of sacredness which invites the adoption of such\r\nprinciples and regulations as will exclude perversion as well as insure\r\na liberal and generous application of grateful and benevolent designs.\r\nHeedlessness and a disregard of the principle which underlies the\r\ngranting of pensions is unfair to the wounded, crippled soldier who is\r\nhonored in the just recognition of his Government. Such a man should\r\nnever find himself side by side on the pension roll with those who have\r\nbeen tempted to attribute the natural ills to which humanity is heir to\r\nservice in the Army. Every relaxation of principle in the granting of\r\npensions invites applications without merit and encourages those who\r\nfor gain urge honest men to become dishonest. Thus is the demoralizing\r\nlesson taught the people that as against the public Treasury the most\r\nquestionable expedients are allowable.\r\n\r\nDuring the present session of Congress 493 special pension bills have\r\nbeen submitted to me, and I am advised that 111 more have received the\r\nfavorable action of both Houses of Congress and will be presented within\r\na day or two, making over 600 of these bills which have been passed up\r\nto this time during the present session, nearly three times the number\r\npassed at any entire session since the year 1861. With the Pension\r\nBureau, fully equipped and regulated by the most liberal rules, in\r\nactive operation, supplemented in its work by constant special\r\nlegislation, it certainly is not unreasonable to suppose that in all the\r\nyears that have elapsed since the close of the war a majority of the\r\nmeritorious claims for pensions have been presented and determined.\r\n\r\nI have now more than 130 of these bills before me awaiting Executive\r\naction. It will be impossible to bestow upon them the examination they\r\ndeserve, and many will probably become operative which should be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I venture to suggest the significance of the startling\r\nincrease in this kind of legislation and the consequences involved in\r\nits continuance.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 21, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 1584, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Cornelia R.

Schenck, who entered the military service of the\r\nUnited States in August, 1861, and was mustered out October 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe record of his service contains no mention of any disability. He died\r\nin December, 1875, of a disease called gastroenteritis, which, being\r\ninterpreted, seems to denote \"inflammation of the stomach and small\r\nintestines.\" So far as the facts are made to appear, the soldier,\r\nneither during the term of his service nor during the eleven years he\r\nlived after his discharge, made any claim of any disability.\r\n\r\nThe claim of his widow was filed in the Pension Bureau in 1885, ten\r\nyears after her husband's death, and is still undetermined.\r\n\r\nThe fact that her application is still pending in that Bureau is\r\nsufficient reason why this bill should not become a law.\r\n\r\nA better reason is based upon the entire lack of any facts shown to\r\nexist which entitle the beneficiary named to a pension.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 1192, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Alfred Denny.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the claimant entered the United States military service\r\nas captain and assistant quartermaster of volunteers on the 12th day of\r\nJune, 1863. After remaining in such position for less than a year he\r\nresigned to accept a civil position.\r\n\r\nThe short record of his military service discloses no mention of any\r\naccident or disability. But twenty years after his resignation, and on\r\nthe 12th day of March, 1884, he reappears as an applicant for a pension,\r\nand alleges in his declaration filed in the Pension Bureau that in\r\nAugust, 1863, while in the line of duty, he was, by a sudden movement of\r\nthe horse he was riding, thrown forward upon the horn of his saddle and\r\nthereby received a rupture in his right side, which at some time and in\r\na manner wholly unexplained subsequently caused a rupture in his left\r\nside also.\r\n\r\nThe number of instances in which those of our soldiers who rode horses\r\nduring the war were injured by being thrown forward upon their saddles\r\nindicate that those saddles were very dangerous contrivances.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied there is not a particle of merit in this claim, and no\r\nfacts are presented to me which entitle it to charitable consideration.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 1400, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to William H. Beck.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant enlisted in 1861. He reenlisted as a veteran volunteer\r\nJanuary i, 1864, and was finally mustered out April 20, 1866. In all\r\nthis time of service his record shows no medical treatment or claim of\r\ndisability. Indeed, an abstract of his reenlistment January 1, 1864,\r\nshows a medical examination and perfect soundness.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, he filed his declaration on the 4th day of\r\nApril, 1879, nearly thirteen years after his discharge, alleging that in\r\nJune, 1863, he incurred epilepsy, to which he has been subject since,\r\nand that his fits have been from one to ten days apart. To connect this\r\nin some way with his military service he stated that the doctor at a\r\nhospital said his epilepsy was caused \"by jar to the head from heavy\r\nfiring.\"\r\n\r\nSix months after this alleged \"jar\" and his consequent epilepsy he\r\nreenlisted upon a medical certificate of perfect soundness and served\r\nmore than two years thereafter.\r\n\r\nEvery conceded fact in the case negatives the allegations of his\r\ndeclaration, and the rejection of his claim necessarily followed.\r\n\r\nIf this disease can be caused in the manner here detailed, its\r\nmanifestations are such as to leave no doubt of its existence, and it\r\nseems to me simply impossible under the circumstances detailed that\r\nthere should be any lack of evidence to support the claim upon which\r\nthis bill is predicated.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 2005, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mary J. Nottage.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is the widow of Thomas Nottage, who\r\nenlisted in August, 1861, and was discharged for disability September\r\n17, 1862. The assistant surgeon of his regiment, upon his discharge,\r\ncertified the cause to be \"disease of the urinary organs,\" which had\r\ntroubled him several years.\r\n\r\nHe died of consumption January 8, 1879, nearly seventeen years after his\r\ndischarge, without ever having made any application for a pension.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 his widow made an application for pension, alleging that he\r\ncontracted in the service \"malarial poisoning, causing remittent fever,\r\npiles, general debility, consumption, and death,\" and that he left two\r\nchildren, both born after his discharge, one in 1866 and the other in\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nThe only medical testimony which has been brought to my attention\r\ntouching his condition since his discharge is that of a single physician\r\nto the effect that he attended him from the year 1873 to the time of his\r\ndeath in 1879. He states that the patient had during that time \"repeated\r\nattacks of remittent fever and irritability of the bladder, with organic\r\ndeposits;\" that \"in the spring of 1878 he had sore throat and cough,\r\nwhich resulted in consumption, of which he died.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim of the widow was rejected in July, 1885, on the ground that\r\n\"the soldier's death was not the result of his service.\"\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that this conclusion of the Pension Bureau was correct.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 342, entitled \"An Act\r\ngranting a pension to Marrilla Parsons, of Detroit, Mich.\"\r\n\r\nNo claim has ever been made for a pension in this case to the Pension\r\nBureau, probably for the reason that there is no pretext that the\r\nbeneficiary named is entitled to a pension under any general law.\r\n\r\nDaniel P.

In 1876 his rate of pension was increased.\r\nIn 1877 he appears to have applied to have his pension again increased.\r\nIt is alleged that upon such application he was directed to appear\r\nbefore an examining board or a surgeon at Green Bay, Wis., for\r\nexamination, and in returning to his home from that place on the 7th day\r\nof September, 1877, he fell from the cars and was killed, his remains\r\nhaving been found on the track the next morning.\r\n\r\nNo one appears to have seen the accident, but it is claimed that he\r\ncould not depend upon his wounded leg, and that it \"gave way many times\r\nand caused him to fall.\" From this statement the inference seems to have\r\nbeen indulged that his death was attributable to the wound he had\r\nreceived thirteen years before.\r\n\r\nThe widow's claim based upon this state of facts was rejected by the\r\nPension Bureau on the ground that the accident resulting in death was\r\nnot the result of his military service, and on an appeal taken to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior from that determination the same was\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nThough this widow admits that prior to her marriage with the deceased\r\nsoldier she had married another man whom she could only say she believed\r\nto be dead, I believe her case to be a pitiable one and wish that I\r\ncould join in her relief; but, unfortunately, official duty can not\r\nalways be well done when directed solely by sympathy and charity.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1288, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Robert Holsey.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant enlisted in 1862, and though he appears to have been sick\r\non two occasions during his term of service, he remained with his\r\ncompany until it was mustered out in 1865.\r\n\r\nThis soldier was really sick during the time he remained in the Army,\r\nand in this respect his claim for a pension has a better origin than\r\nmany that are presented. But the fact must be recognized, I suppose,\r\nthat every army ailment does not necessarily result in death or\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, seventeen years after his discharge, this soldier filed his\r\ndeclaration for a pension, alleging that in 1863 he contracted\r\nintermittent fever, affecting his lungs, kidneys, and stomach.\r\n\r\nA board of surgeons, upon an examination made in 1882, find disease of\r\nkidneys, but no indication of lung and stomach trouble; and a medical\r\nreferee reported in 1885 that there had been no disease of the stomach\r\nand lungs since the filing of the claim, and that the difficulty\r\naffecting the kidneys had no relation to the sickness for which the\r\nclaimant had been treated while in the Army.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that a correct conclusion was reached when the\r\napplication for pension in this case was denied by the Pension Bureau.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 7979, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Jackson Steward.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant's application for pension is now pending in the Pension\r\nBureau, and has been sent to a special examiner for the purpose of\r\ntaking additional proof.\r\n\r\nThis I deem sufficient reason why the proposed bill should not now\r\nbecome a law.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 2025, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James Butler.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant was enrolled as a private in a New Hampshire regiment\r\nAugust 23, 1864, but on the organization of his company, on the 12th day\r\nof September, 1864, he was discharged on account of a fracture of his\r\nleg, which happened on the 11th day of September, 1864.\r\n\r\nIt appears that before the organization of the company to which he was\r\nattached, and on the 10th day of September, he obtained permission to\r\nleave the place of rendezvous for the purpose of visiting his family,\r\nand was to return the next day. At a very early hour in the morning,\r\neither while preparing to return or actually on his way, he fell into a\r\nnew cellar and broke his leg. It is said that the leg fractured is now\r\nshorter than the other.\r\n\r\nHis claim for pension was rejected in December, 1864, by the Pension\r\nBureau, and its action was affirmed in 1871 upon the ground that the\r\ninjury was received while the claimant was on an individual furlough,\r\nand therefore not in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that neither his regiment nor his company had at\r\nthe time of his accident been organized, and that he was in no sense in\r\nthe military service of the United States, and that his injury was\r\nreceived while on a visit, and not in the performance of duty, I can see\r\nno pretext for allowing a pension in this case.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 23, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 6688, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of William Bishop.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant was enrolled as a substitute on the 25th day of March,\r\n1865.

This was rejected on the\r\nground that the sickness which produced his disability having occurred\r\nmore than a year after his discharge from the Army, it can not be\r\naccepted as a result of his military service.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no allegation of any incident of his service which\r\nit is claimed is at all related to his sickness and disability.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 23, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 6170, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mary A.

The\r\napplication for pension was based upon the theory that during his\r\nmilitary service the deceased soldier contracted rheumatism, which so\r\ninterfered with his ability to save himself by swimming that his death\r\nmay be fairly traced to a disability incurred in the service.\r\n\r\nHe does not appear to have been treated while in the Army for\r\nrheumatism, though some evidence is presented of his complaining of\r\nrheumatic symptoms.\r\n\r\nHe was mustered out in 1863, and though he lived twelve years thereafter\r\nit does not appear that he ever applied for a pension; and though he was\r\ndrowned in 1875, his widow apparently did not connect his military\r\nservice with his death until ten years thereafter.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there is such an entire absence of direct and\r\ntangible evidence that the death of this soldier resulted from any\r\nincident of his service that the granting of a pension upon such a\r\ntheory is not justified.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 23, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 6117, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James D.

Afterwards he described\r\nhis trouble as inflammation of the muscles of the back, with pain in the\r\nkidneys. In another statement, filed in December, 1884, he alleges that\r\nwhile in the service he contracted diarrhea and was injured in one of\r\nhis testicles, producing a rupture.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be said of this claimant's achievements during his\r\nshort military career, it must be conceded that he accumulated a great\r\ndeal of disability.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that whatever ailments he may honestly lay\r\nclaim to, his title to the same was complete before he entered the Army.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 23, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 7703, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Anna A.

Shortly before his\r\ndeath, in 1878, he went to Memphis for the purpose of giving his\r\nprofessional assistance to those suffering from yellow fever at that\r\nplace.

Indeed the claimant\r\nhimself stated to the special examiner and also to the board of surgeons\r\nthat he had been somewhat deaf from childhood.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 an examining surgeon reports that he finds no scar or evidence\r\nof wound, but his hearing is very much impaired.\r\n\r\nThe claim was rejected in 1885 on the ground that deafness existed prior\r\nto enlistment, and also because of no ratable disability by reason of\r\nalleged wound in the cheek.\r\n\r\nI think, considering the manner of the soldier's discharge and the facts\r\ndeveloped, that the claimant should not be pensioned.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 29, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return Senate bill No. 1797, entitled \"An act granting a\r\npension to John S.

He is borne upon the rolls of his\r\ncompany as present up to June, 1862; in July and August, 1862, as on\r\ndetached service as hospital attendant, and so reported February 28,\r\n1863. In March and April, 1863, he is reported as present, and in May\r\nand June, 1863, as on detached service.

He appears also to have served\r\nfor two years after the date of his alleged injury, and that he did not\r\nfile his application for pension till about sixteen years afterwards.\r\n\r\nHis claim is still pending, undetermined, in the Pension Bureau, and if\r\nthere is merit in it there is no doubt that he will be able to make it\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 29, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 1077, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Newcomb Parker.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant filed an application for a pension in the year 1880.\r\n\r\nBefore the passage of the bill herewith returned the Commissioner of\r\nPensions, in ignorance of the action of Congress, allowed his claim\r\nunder the general law.

He enlisted in August, 1862; was in\r\naction November, 1862, and taken prisoner and at once paroled. During\r\nhis parole, and at Aurora, in the State of Illinois, he took part in the\r\ncelebration of the 4th day of July, 1863, and while so engaged was\r\nterribly injured by the discharge of a cannon. He is poor, and has a\r\nwife and a number of children.\r\n\r\nThese facts are derived from the report of the committee in Congress to\r\nwhom the bill was referred, and from a letter written by the soldier\r\nsince favorable action was had upon said bill by both Houses of\r\nCongress, which letter is now before me. In this letter he says:\r\n\"I never thought of trying getting a pension until my old comrades urged\r\nme to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration does not in the least, I think, militate against the\r\npresent application for pension, but it tends to show the ideas that\r\nhave become quite prevalent concerning the facts necessary to be\r\nestablished in order to procure a pension by special act of Congress.\r\n\r\nLet it be conceded that during the three months which elapsed between\r\nthe soldier's enlistment and his capture and parole he was constantly\r\nin the field and bravely did his duty. The case presented is that of\r\na brave soldier, not injured in any engagement with the enemy, but\r\nhonorably captured, and by his parole placed in a condition which\r\nprevented for the time being his further active military service. He\r\nproceeded to his home or to his friends and took his place among\r\nnoncombatants. Eight months afterwards he joined the citizens of the\r\nplace of his sojourn and the citizens of every town and hamlet in the\r\nloyal States in the usual and creditable celebration of our national\r\nholiday. Among the casualties which unfortunately always result from\r\nsuch celebrations there occurred a premature discharge of a cannon,\r\nwhich the present claimant for pension was assisting other citizens to\r\ndischarge and manage.\r\n\r\nWhether any of those thus engaged with him were injured is not\r\ndisclosed, but it is certain that the paroled soldier was very badly\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nI am utterly unable to discover any relation between this accident and\r\nthe military service, or any reason why, if a pension is granted as\r\nproposed by this bill, there should not also be a pension granted to any\r\nof the companions of the claimant who chanced to be injured at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA disabled man and a wife and family in need are objects which appeal to\r\nthe sympathy and charitable feelings of any decent man; but it seems to\r\nme that it by no means follows that those intrusted with the people's\r\nbusiness and the expenditure of the people's money are justified in so\r\nexecuting the pension laws as that they shall furnish a means of relief\r\nin every case of distress or hardship.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 3, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 365, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Martin L. Bundy.\"\r\n\r\nBy this bill it is proposed to allow in the settlement by the United\r\nStates with Mr. Bundy, who was lately a paymaster in the Army, the sum\r\nof $719.47 for the forage of two horses to which he claims he was\r\nentitled while in the service, and which has never been drawn by him.\r\nThe time during which it is alleged this forage was due is stated to be\r\nbetween July 17, 1862, and April 15, 1866.\r\n\r\nThis claimant was mustered out as paymaster on the last-mentioned date,\r\nand in 1872 a certificate was issued that, his accounts having been\r\nadjusted, they exhibited no indebtedness on his part to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, however, and in or about the year 1879, it was discovered\r\nthat by reason of a duplicate credit, which had been allowed him by\r\nmistake, he was actually indebted to the Government in the sum of\r\n$528.72.\r\n\r\nAfter the fact had been made known to him the claim embodied in this\r\nbill was suggested to or invented by him, which, if allowed, will not\r\nonly extinguish his indebtedness to the Government, but leave a balance\r\ndue to him.\r\n\r\nBy the law and the Army Regulations the forage upon which this claim is\r\nbased is or should be only allowed to those in the service who actually\r\nhave and use horses in the performance of their duties.\r\n\r\nAnd when thus entitled to forage it was necessary to draw it in kind or\r\nin the specific articles permitted every month, and if not thus drawn it\r\ncould not afterwards be claimed. There seems to be no such thing as\r\ncommutation of forage in such cases.\r\n\r\nThere is no suggestion that the claimant named in this bill had or\r\nused any horses while in the service. If he did and paid for their\r\nmaintenance and at the time of the settlement of his accounts made no\r\nclaim for reimbursement, he presents a case of incredible ignorance\r\nof his rights or a wonderful lack of that disposition to gain every\r\npossible advantage which is usually found among those who deal with the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that the claim is not valid, and the fact that it\r\nis made long after the discovery of his deficit leads to the suspicion\r\nthat it is insisted on merely for the purpose of paying his debt.\r\n\r\nThough in this particular case it would do but little more than to\r\nextinguish an indebtedness to the Government, the allowance of this\r\nclaim would set a precedent which could hardly be ignored, and which, if\r\nfollowed, would furnish another means of attack upon the public Treasury\r\nquite as effective as many which are now in active operation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 7018, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Aretus F.

Kyler.\"\r\n\r\nA pension was granted to the person named in this bill, dating from\r\nSeptember, 1864, for neuralgia and disease of the eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was mustered into the service, to serve one hundred days, May 14,\r\n1864, and mustered out September 8, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 information reached the Pension Bureau that the pensioner was\r\ntreated for neuralgia and disease of the eyes at various times between\r\nthe years 1859 and 1864, and this fact appearing to the satisfaction of\r\nthe Bureau upon the examination which followed, the pensioner's name was\r\ndropped from the roll.\r\n\r\nAfterwards another thorough examination of the case was made, when the\r\npensioner was permitted to confront the witnesses against him and\r\nproduce evidence in his own behalf.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that a Dr. Saunders, who testified to treating the\r\npensioner before his enlistment, was exceedingly unfriendly; but he was\r\ncorroborated by his son and by entries on his books. Another physician,\r\napparently disinterested, also testified to his treatment of the\r\npensioner in 1860 for difficulties with his eyes and ears. The pensioner\r\nhimself admitted that he had trouble with one of his eyes in 1860, but\r\nthat he entirely recovered. Six other witnesses testified to the\r\nexistence of disease of the pensioner's eyes before enlistment.\r\n\r\nThough twelve neighbors of the pensioner testified that he was free from\r\nneuralgia and disease of the eyes before enlistment, I am of the opinion\r\nthat the evidence against the pension was quite satisfactory, and that\r\nit should not be restored, as the bill before me proposes.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 3640, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James T.

He seems to have been treated for remittent fever, chronic\r\ndiarrhea, general debility, and palpitation of the heart.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 he filed a declaration for pension, alleging that at Petersburg,\r\nJuly 1, 1864, he contracted fever and inflammation of the eyes.\r\n\r\nHe filed an affidavit in January, 1877, in which he states that his\r\ndiseased eyes resulted from diseased nerves, caused by a wound received\r\nJune 18, 1864, at Petersburg, and from a consequent abscess on the back\r\nof the neck.\r\n\r\nIn an affidavit filed in July, 1878, he states that in June, 1864, in\r\nfront of Petersburg, he had his gun smashed in front of his face and his\r\neyes injured, and afterwards he had an abscess on the back of his neck,\r\ntyphoid fever, and disease of the left lung.\r\n\r\nHis claim founded upon these various allegations of injury was rejected\r\nin February, 1879.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1884, a declaration was filed for a pension, alleging\r\ndisease of the heart contracted at Petersburg June 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe claimant was examined once in 1882 and twice in 1884 by United\r\nStates examining surgeons and boards, and it is stated that these\r\nexaminations failed to reveal any disease or disability except disease\r\nof the eyes and an irritable heart, the result of indigestion.\r\n\r\nAn oculist who made an examination in 1884 reported that the unnatural\r\ncondition of claimant's eyes was congenital and in no manner the result\r\nof injury or disease.\r\n\r\nUpon a consideration of the very short time that the claimant was in\r\nactual service, the different claims he has made touching his alleged\r\ndisability, and the positive results of medical examinations, I am\r\nsatisfied this pension should not be allowed.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval House bill No. 5306, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Roxana V. Rowley.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is the widow of Franklin Rowley, who\r\nenlisted February 8, 1865, was promoted to first lieutenant March 13,\r\n1865, and was discharged May 22, 1865, having tendered his resignation,\r\nas it is stated, on account of incompetency. His tender of resignation\r\nwas indorsed by the commanding officer of his regiment as follows: \"This\r\nman is wholly unfit for an officer.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that he was in the service a little more than three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, fifteen years after his discharge, he applied for a pension,\r\nalleging that he contracted disease of the liver while in the service.\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of the claim his attending physician before\r\nenlistment stated that as early as 1854 the claimant was afflicted with\r\ndyspepsia and functional disease of the liver; that he regarded him as\r\nincurable, so far as being restored to sound health was concerned, and\r\nthat if he had been at home at the time when he enlisted he would have\r\nadvised against it.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of this physician as to the claimant's condition after his\r\ndischarge is referred to in the report of the Committee of the House to\r\nwhom this bill was referred, and I do not understand that he is at all\r\nimpeached. He certainly is better informed than any other person\r\nregarding the condition of the man who was his patient.\r\n\r\nThe soldier died in 1881, sixteen years after his discharge, and his\r\nwidow filed her claim for pension in 1882, alleging that the death of\r\nher husband was caused by a disease of the liver contracted in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nHer claim was rejected in 1883 upon the ground that the disease of which\r\nher husband died existed prior to his enlistment.\r\n\r\nI can not avoid the conclusion, upon all the facts presented, that his\r\ndeath was not chargeable to any incident of his brief military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 5021, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mrs. Margaret A.

Afterwards his pension was\r\nincreased to $15 a month, dating from December, 1867, and arrears at the\r\nrate of $8 a month from February, 1864. In 1876 the case was put in the\r\nhands of a special agent of the Pension Bureau for examination, and upon\r\nhis report, showing that the claimant's disease of the eyes existed\r\nprior to enlistment, his name was dropped from the rolls.\r\n\r\nAn application for restoration was made in 1879, and a thorough\r\nexamination was made by a special examiner in 1885, who reported that\r\nthe testimony taken conclusively established the fact that the claimant\r\nhad disease of the eyes prior to the time of enlistment, the result of a\r\ndisorder which he specifically mentions, and that he was treated for the\r\nsame more than a year subsequently to 1860. He adds:\r\n\r\n  There is no merit whatever in this case, and it is evident that he\r\n  obtained a large sum as pension to which, he must have known he was\r\n  not entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of these examinations, instituted for the express purpose of\r\ndeveloping the facts, and with nothing apparent to impeach them, should,\r\nI think, control as against the statements of neighbors and comrades\r\nbased upon mere general observation, and not necessarily covering the\r\nperiod which is important to the controversy.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 4782, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Elizabeth McKay.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named is the widow of Rowley S. McKay, who in 1862 seems\r\nto have been employed as pilot on the ram _Switzerland_. He seems\r\nto have been upon the rolls of two other vessels of the United States,\r\nthe _Covington_ and _General Price_, but was discharged by Admiral\r\nPorter in June, 1864, with loss of all pay and emoluments.\r\n\r\nHe filed an application for pension in 1870, alleging that while on duty\r\nas pilot and in action with the rebel ram _Arkansas_ his hearing\r\nbecame affected by heavy firing. He also claimed that in February, 1863,\r\nwhile on the vessel _Queen of the West_, she grounded, and to escape\r\ncapture he got off and floated down the river on a cotton bale, and,\r\nbeing in the water about three hours, the exposure caused a disease of\r\nthe urinary organs; and that a few days after, while coming up the river\r\non a transport, the boat was fired into and several balls passed through\r\nhis left thigh. It seems that this claim was not definitely passed upon,\r\nbut it is stated that the records failed to show that McKay was in the\r\nservice of the United States at the time he alleged the contraction of\r\ndisease of the urinary organs and was wounded in the thigh.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill never made application for pension\r\nto the Pension Bureau, but it appears that she bases her claims to\r\nconsideration by Congress upon the allegation that in 1862, while her\r\nhusband was acting as pilot of the ram or gunboat _Switzerland_, he\r\ncontracted chronic diarrhea, from which he never recovered, and that he\r\ndied from the effects of said disease in May, 1874.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that among the various causes which the soldier or\r\nsailor himself alleged as the grounds of his application for pension\r\nchronic diarrhea is not mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be any medical testimony to support the claim\r\nthus made by the widow, and the cause of death is not definitely stated.\r\n\r\nTaking all together, it has the appearance of a case, by no means rare,\r\nwhere chronic diarrhea or rheumatism are appealed to as a basis for a\r\npension claim in the absence of something more substantial and definite.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the claim of the beneficiary has never been presented to\r\nthe Pension Bureau influences in some degree my action in withholding my\r\napproval of this bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 3623, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to William H.

It is stated that he belonged to\r\nCaptain Frank Mason's company of volunteers, of Prostburg, in the State\r\nof Maryland.\r\n\r\nWhether this company was organized for the purpose of cooperating at any\r\ntime with the Union or State forces is not alleged, and it may well have\r\nbeen existing merely for the purpose of neighborhood protection.\r\n\r\nSuch as it was, the company was ordered in June, 1861, to proceed to\r\nCumberland to repel a threatened attack of Confederate forces. Upon\r\narriving at that place the men were ordered to uncap their muskets. In\r\ndoing this, and through the negligence of another member of the company,\r\nwhose musket was discharged, the claimant was wounded.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to me that the facts in this case, so far as they have\r\nbeen developed, justify the passage of this act.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 4226, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Fannie E.

He\r\nwas a soldier in the Mexican War, and entered the Union Army in the War\r\nof the Rebellion, on the 16th day of October, 1861, as major of a\r\nCalifornia regiment. He became a colonel in February, 1863, and resigned\r\nin April of that year, to take effect on the 31st of May ensuing.\r\n\r\nHis resignation seems to have been tendered on account of private\r\nmatters, and no mention was then made of any disability. It is stated in\r\nthe committee's report to the House that in 1864 he accepted the office\r\nof adjutant-general of the State of California, which he held for nearly\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1883 from cerebral apoplexy.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1884, his widow filed an application for pension, based upon\r\nthe allegation that from active and severe service in a battle with the\r\nIndians at Spanish Fort in 1863 her husband incurred a hernia, which\r\nincapacitated him for active service.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be evidence to justify this statement, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that the deceased during the twenty years that followed before\r\nhis death made no claim for such disability.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that the effort to attribute his death by apoplexy to\r\nthe existence of hernia ought not to be successful.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 2971, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Francis Deming.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant entered the service in August, 1861, and was discharged\r\nSeptember 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nHis hospital record shows that during his service he was treated for\r\nvarious temporary ailments, among which rheumatism is not included.\r\n\r\nHe filed an application for pension in September, 1884, alleging that in\r\nAugust, 1864, he contracted rheumatism, which had resulted in blindness.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of his case in November, 1884, he stated that his\r\neyesight began to fail in 1882.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no testimony showing his condition from the time of\r\nhis discharge to 1880, a period of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe claim that his present condition of blindness is the result of his\r\narmy service is not insisted upon as a reason for granting him relief as\r\nstrongly as his sad and helpless condition. The committee of the House\r\nto which this bill was referred, after detailing his situation, close\r\ntheir report with these words: \"He served well his country in its dire\r\nneed; his necessities now appeal for relief.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here presented the case of a soldier who did his duty during\r\nhis army service, and who was discharged in 1865 without any record of\r\nhaving suffered with rheumatism and without any claim of disability\r\narising from the same. He returned to his place as a citizen, and\r\nin peaceful pursuits, with chances certainly not impaired by the\r\ncircumstance that he had served his country, he appears to have held his\r\nplace in the race of life for fifteen years or more. Then, like many\r\nanother, he was subjected to loss of sight, one of the saddest\r\nafflictions known to human life.\r\n\r\nThereupon, and after nineteen years had elapsed since his discharge from\r\nthe Army, a pension is claimed for him upon a very shadowy allegation of\r\nthe incurrence of rheumatism while in the service, coupled with the\r\nstartling proposition that this rheumatism resulted, just previous to\r\nhis application, in blindness. Upon medical examination it appeared that\r\nhis blindness was caused by amaurosis, which is generally accepted as an\r\naffection of the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that a fair examination of the facts in this case\r\njustifies the statement that the bill under consideration can rest only\r\nupon the grounds that aid should be furnished to this ex-soldier because\r\nhe served in the Army and because he a long time thereafter became\r\nblind, disabled, and dependent.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether we are prepared to adopt this principle and\r\nestablish this precedent.\r\n\r\nNone of us are entitled to credit for extreme tenderness and\r\nconsideration toward those who fought their country's battles. These\r\nare sentiments con|»ion to all good citizens. They lead to the most\r\nbenevolent care on the part of the Government and deeds of charity and\r\nmercy in private life. The blatant and noisy self-assertion of those\r\nwho, from motives that may well be suspected, declare themselves above\r\nall others friends of the soldier can not discredit nor belittle the\r\ncalm, steady, and affectionate regard of a grateful nation.\r\n\r\nAn appropriation has just been passed setting apart $76,000,000 of\r\nthe public money for distribution as pensions, under laws liberally\r\nconstructed, with a view of meeting every meritorious case. More than\r\n$1,000,000 was added to maintain the Pension Bureau, which is charged\r\nwith the duty of a fair, just, and liberal apportionment of this fund.\r\n\r\nLegislation has been at the present session of Congress perfected\r\nconsiderably increasing the rate of pension in certain cases.\r\nAppropriations have also been made of large sums for the support of\r\nnational homes where sick, disabled, or needy soldiers are cared for,\r\nand within a few days a liberal sum has been appropriated for the\r\nenlargement and increased accommodation and convenience of these\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nAll this is no more than should be done.\r\n\r\nBut with all this, and with the hundreds of special acts which have been\r\npassed granting pensions in cases where, for my part, I am willing to\r\nconfess that sympathy rather than judgment has often led to the\r\ndiscovery of a relation between injury or death and military service, I\r\nam constrained by a sense of public duty to interpose against\r\nestablishing a principle and setting a precedent which must result in\r\nunregulated, partial, and unjust gifts of public money under the pretext\r\nof indemnifying those who suffered in their means of support as an\r\nincident of military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 4642, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James Carroll.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant alleges that he was wounded while in the service as a\r\nmember of Company B, Third Regiment North Carolina Mounted Volunteers,\r\nwhile securing recruits for the regiment at Watauga, N.C., January 25,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department develop the fact that the name of this\r\nman is not borne upon any roll of the company to which he claims to\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nHe stated in his application that he was sworn in by one George W.\r\nPerkins, who, it appears, was a private in said company, and that\r\nPerkins was with him at the time he was shot.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly true, and that the claimant was injured by a gunshot\r\nis also probably true. He was not, however, at the time regularly in the\r\nUnited States service, but this objection might in some circumstances\r\nbe regarded as technical. The difficulty is that the fact that he was\r\ncreditably employed in a service of benefit to the country is not\r\nsatisfactorily shown. He gives two accounts of the business in which he\r\nwas engaged, and Mr. Perkins's explanation of the manner in which the\r\ntwo were occupied is somewhat different still.\r\n\r\nCarroll's claim, presented to the Pension Bureau, was rejected upon\r\nthe ground that there was no record of his service on file; but in his\r\ntestimony he stated that Perkins was wounded on the same occasion as\r\nhimself, and that he (Perkins) was then a pensioner on account thereof.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Pension Bureau show that Perkins was pensioned in\r\n1873 on account of three wounds received at the time and place of\r\nCarroll's injury.\r\n\r\nIt also appears that his name was dropped from the rolls in 1877 on the\r\nground that his wounds were not received in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter an investigation made at that time by a special examiner, he\r\nreported that Perkins and Carroll had collected a number of men\r\ntogether, who made their headquarters at the home of Carroll's mother\r\nand were engaged in plundering the neighborhood, and that on account of\r\ntheir depredations they were hunted down by home guards and shot at the\r\ntime they stated.\r\n\r\nIf this report is accepted as reliable, it should of course lead to the\r\nrejection of the claim for pension on the part of Mr. Carroll.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 3043, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Lewis W.

In his examination he did not claim to have diarrhea for a\r\ngood many years. On the contrary, he claimed to be affected with\r\nconstipation, and said he had never had diarrhea of late years, except\r\nat times when he had taken medicine for constipation.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think it would have been a fortunate thing if in this\r\ncase it could have been demonstrated that a man could thrive so well\r\nwith the chronic diarrhea for fifty-two years as its existence in the\r\ncase of this good old gentleman would prove. We should then, perhaps,\r\nhave less of it in claims for pensions.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, in this case there is no disability which can be traced to\r\nthe forty days' military service of fifty-four years ago, and I think\r\nlittle, if any, more infirmity than is usually found in men of the age\r\nof the claimant.\r\n\r\nEntertaining this belief, I am constrained to withhold my signature from\r\nthis bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 5414, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Maria Cunningham.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the beneficiary named in this bill enlisted January 29,\r\n1862, and was discharged January 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe applied for a pension in 1876, alleging a shell wound in the head.\r\nHis claim was rejected on the ground that there appeared to be no\r\ndisability from that cause.

A medical examination made in 1882 showed a\r\nfracture of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs of the left side.\r\n\r\nIf these fractures were the result of the injury alleged, they were\r\nimmediately apparent, and the delay of twenty-one years in presenting\r\nthe claim for pension certainly needs explanation.\r\n\r\nClaims of this description, by a wise provision of law, must, to be\r\nvalid, be prosecuted to a successful issue prior to the 4th day of July,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nThe rank which this claimant held presupposes such intelligence as\r\nadmits of no excuse on the ground of ignorance of the law for his\r\nfailure to present his application within the time fixed by law.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of disability from the cause alleged is weak, to say the\r\nmost of it, and I can not think that such a wholesome provision of law\r\nas that above referred to, which limits the time for the adjustment of\r\nsuch claims, should be modified upon the facts presented in this case.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 5550, entitled \"An act\r\nto provide for the erection of a public building at Duluth, Minn.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quite a careful examination of the public needs at the point\r\nmentioned I am entirely satisfied that the public building provided for\r\nin this bill is not immediately necessary.\r\n\r\nNot a little legislation has lately been perfected, and very likely more\r\nwill be necessary, to increase miscalculated appropriations for and\r\ncorrect blunders in the construction of many of the public buildings now\r\nin process of erection.\r\n\r\nWhile this does not furnish a good reason for disapproving the erection\r\nof other buildings where actually necessary, it induces close scrutiny\r\nand gives rise to the earnest wish that new projects for public\r\nbuildings shall for the present be limited to such as are required by\r\nthe most pressing necessities of the Government's business.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 2043, entitled \"An act\r\nto place Mary Karstetter on the pension roll.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this beneficiary, Jacob Karstetter, was enrolled June 30,\r\n1864, as a substitute in a Pennsylvania regiment, and was discharged for\r\ndisability June 20, 1865, caused by a gunshot wound in the left hand.\r\n\r\nA declaration for pension was filed by him in 1865, based upon this\r\nwound, and the same was granted, dating from June in that year, which he\r\ndrew till the time of his death, August 21, 1874.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 his widow filed her application for pension, alleging that he\r\ndied of wounds received in battle. The claim was made that he was\r\ninjured while in the Army by a horse running over him.\r\n\r\nThere is little or no evidence of such an injury having been received;\r\nand if this was presented there would be no necessary connection between\r\nthat and the cause of the soldier's death, which was certified by the\r\nattending physician to be gastritis and congestion of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nI can hardly see how the Pension Bureau could arrive at any conclusion\r\nexcept that the death of the soldier was not due to his military\r\nservice, and the acceptance of this finding, after an examination of the\r\nfacts, leads me to disapprove this bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 5394, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Sallie Ann Bradley.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this proposed beneficiary was discharged from the\r\nmilitary service in 1865, after a long service, and was afterwards\r\npensioned for gunshot wound.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1882. The widow appears to have never filed a claim for\r\npension in her own right.\r\n\r\nNo cause is given of the soldier's death, but it is not claimed that it\r\nresulted from his military service, her pension being asked for entirely\r\nbecause of her needs and the faithful service of her husband and her\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nThis presents the question whether a gift in such a case is a proper\r\ndisposition of money appropriated for the purpose of paying pensions.\r\n\r\nThe passage of this law would, in my opinion, establish a precedent so\r\nfar-reaching and open the door to such a vast multitude of claims not on\r\nprinciple within our present pension laws that I am constrained to\r\ndisapprove the bill under consideration.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 5603, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mrs. Catherine McCarty.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary is the widow of John McCarty, of the First Missouri\r\nRegiment of State Militia Volunteers, who died at Clinton, Mo., April 8,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nThe widow filed her claim in 1866, alleging that her husband died while\r\nin the service from an overdose of colchicum.\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows without dispute that on the day previous to the death\r\nof the soldier a comrade procured some medicine from the regimental\r\nsurgeon and asked McCarty to smell and taste it; that he did so, and\r\nshortly afterwards became very sick and died the next morning.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the deceased soldier did more than taste this\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would be pleasant to aid the widow in this case, it is\r\nhardly fair to ask the Government to grant a pension for the freak or\r\ngross heedlessness and recklessness of this soldier.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval House bill No. 6648, entitled \"An\r\nact for the relief of Edward M. Harrington.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that this claimant was enrolled as a recruit December 31,\r\n1863, and mustered in at Dunkirk, N.Y. He remained at the barracks there\r\nuntil March, 1864, when he was received at the Elmira rendezvous. From\r\nthere he was sent to his regiment on the 7th day of April, 1864.\r\n\r\nHe was discharged June 15, 1864, upon a surgeon's certificate of\r\ndisability, declaring the cause of discharge to be epilepsy, produced by\r\nblows of violence over the hypochondrial region while in the service,\r\nproducing a deformity of sternum.\r\n\r\nThe claimant filed an application for pension in June, 1879, and in that\r\nand subsequent affidavits he alleged that while in barracks at Dunkirk,\r\nN.Y., and about the 9th day of January, 1864, and in the line of duty,\r\nhe was attacked by one Patrick Burnes, who struck him upon the head and\r\nstamped upon and kicked him, breaking his collar bone and a number of\r\nribs, causing internal injury and fits, the latter recurring every two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while considering the character of these alleged\r\ninjuries or their connection with the fits with which the claimant is\r\nafflicted.\r\n\r\nI am entirely unable to see how the injuries are related to the\r\nclaimant's army service.\r\n\r\nThe Government ought not to be called upon to insure against the\r\nquarrelsome propensities of its individual soldiers, nor to compensate\r\none who is worsted in a fight, or even in an unprovoked attack, when the\r\ncause of injury is in no way connected with or related to any\r\nrequirement or incident of military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 7, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2281, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting to railroads the right of way through the Indian reservation in\r\nnorthern Montana.\"\r\n\r\nThe reservation referred to stretches across the extreme northern\r\npart of Montana Territory, with British America for its northern\r\nboundary. It contains an area of over 30,000 square miles. It is\r\ndedicated to Indian occupancy by treaty of October 17, 1855, and act of\r\nCongress of April 15, 1874. No railroads are within immediate approach\r\nto its boundaries, and only one, as shown on recent maps, is under\r\nconstruction in the neighborhood leading in its direction. The\r\nsurrounding country is sparsely settled, and I have been unable to\r\nascertain that the necessities of commerce or any public exigencies\r\ndemand this legislation, which would affect so seriously the rights and\r\ninterests of the Indians occupying the reservation.\r\n\r\nThe bill is in the nature of a general right of way for railroads\r\nthrough this Indian reservation. The Indian occupants have not given\r\ntheir consent to it, neither have they been consulted regarding it, nor\r\nis there any provision in it for securing their consent or agreement to\r\nthe location or construction of railroads upon their lands. No routes\r\nare described, and no general directions on which the line of any\r\nrailroad will be constructed are given.\r\n\r\nNo particular organized railway company engaged in constructing a\r\nrailroad toward the reservation and ready or desirous to build its road\r\nthrough the Indian lands to meet the needs and requirements of trade\r\nand commerce is named. The bill gives the right to any railroad in the\r\ncountry, duly organized under the laws of any Territory, of any State,\r\nor of the United States, except those of the District of Columbia, to\r\nenter this Indian country, prospect for routes of travel, survey them,\r\nand construct routes of travel wherever it may please, with no check\r\nsave possible disapproval by the Secretary of the Interior of its maps\r\nof location, and no limitation upon its acts except such rules and\r\nregulations as he may prescribe.\r\n\r\nThis power vested in the Secretary of the Interior might itself be\r\nimprovidently exercised and subject to abuse.\r\n\r\nNo limit of time is fixed within which the construction of railroads\r\nshould begin or be completed. Without such limitations speculating\r\ncorporations would be enabled to seek out and secure the right of way\r\nover the natural and most feasible routes, with no present intention of\r\nconstructing railroads along such lines, but with the view of holding\r\ntheir advantageous easements for disposal at some future time to some\r\nother corporation for a valuable consideration. In this way the\r\nconstruction of needed railroad facilities in that country could be\r\nhereafter greatly obstructed and retarded.\r\n\r\nIf the United States must exercise its right of eminent domain over the\r\nIndian Territories for the general welfare of the whole country, it\r\nshould be done cautiously, with due regard for the interests of the\r\nIndians, and to no greater extent than the exigencies of the public\r\nservice require.\r\n\r\nBills tending somewhat in the direction of this general character of\r\nlegislation, affecting the rights of the Indians reserved to them by\r\ntreaty stipulations, have been presented to me during the present\r\nsession of Congress. They have received my reluctant approval, though\r\nI am by no means certain that a mistake has not been made in passing\r\nsuch laws without providing for the consent to such grants by the\r\nIndian occupants and otherwise more closely guarding their rights and\r\ninterests; and I hoped that each of those bills as it received my\r\napproval would be the last of the kind presented. They, however,\r\ndesignated particular railroad companies, laid down general routes over\r\nwhich the respective roads should be constructed through the Indian\r\nlands, and specified their direction and termini, so that I was enabled\r\nto reasonably satisfy myself that the exigencies of the public service\r\nand the interests of commerce probably demanded the construction of the\r\nroads, and that by their construction and operation the Indians would\r\nnot be too seriously affected.\r\n\r\nThe bill now before me is much more general in its terms than those\r\nwhich have preceded it. It is a new and wide departure from the general\r\ntenor of legislation affecting Indian reservations. It ignores the right\r\nof the Indians to be consulted as to the disposition of their lands,\r\nopens wide the door to any railroad corporation to do what, under the\r\ntreaty covering the greater portion of the reservation, is reserved to\r\nthe United States alone; it gives the right to enter upon Indian lands\r\nto a class of corporations carrying with them many individuals not known\r\nfor any scrupulous regard for the interest or welfare of the Indians;\r\nit invites a general invasion of the Indian country, and brings into\r\ncontact and intercourse with the Indians a class of whites and others\r\nwho are independent of the orders, regulations, and control of the\r\nresident agents.\r\n\r\nCorporations operating railroads through Indian lands are strongly\r\ntempted to infringe at will upon the reserved rights and the property of\r\nIndians, and thus are apt to become so arbitrary in their dealings and\r\ndomineering in their conduct toward them that the Indians become\r\ndisquieted, often threatening outbreaks and periling the lives of\r\nfrontier settlers and others.\r\n\r\nI am impressed with the belief that the bill under consideration does\r\nnot sufficiently guard against an invasion of the rights and a\r\ndisturbance of the peace and quiet of the Indians on the reservation\r\nmentioned; nor am I satisfied that the legislation proposed is demanded\r\nby any exigency of the public welfare.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 9, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 524, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Daniel H. Ross.\"\r\n\r\nAn application for pension was filed in the Pension Bureau by the\r\nbeneficiary named in this bill, and considerable testimony was filed in\r\nsupport of the same. I do not understand that the claim has been finally\r\nrejected. But however that may be, the claimant died, as I am advised,\r\non the 1st day of February last. This, of course, renders the proposed\r\nlegislation entirely inoperative, if it would not actually prejudice the\r\nclaim of his surviving widow. She has already been advised of the\r\nevidence necessary to complete the claim of her husband, and it is not\r\nat all improbable that she will be able to prosecute the same to a\r\nsuccessful issue for her benefit.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, her rights should not be in the least jeopardized by the\r\ncompletion of the legislation proposed in this bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 9, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 856, entitled \"An act\r\nto provide for the erection of a public building in the city of Dayton,\r\nOhio.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that the Government has any public department or\r\nbusiness which it should quarter at Dayton except its post-office and\r\ninternal-revenue office. The former is represented as employing ten\r\nclerks, sixteen regular and two substitute letter carriers, and two\r\nspecial-delivery employees, who, I suppose, are boys, only occasionally\r\nin actual service. I do not understand that the present post-office\r\nquarters are either insufficient or inconvenient. By a statement\r\nprepared by the present postmaster it appears that they are rented by\r\nthe Government for a period of ten years from the 15th day of October,\r\n1883, at an annual rent of $2,950, which includes the cost of heating\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe office of the internal-revenue collector is claimed to be\r\ninadequate, but I am-led to believe that this officer is fairly\r\naccommodated at an annual rental of $900. It is not impossible that a\r\nsuggestion to change the area of this revenue district may be adopted,\r\nwhich would relieve any complaint of inadequacy of office room.\r\n\r\nWith only these two offices to provide for, I am not satisfied that the\r\nexpenditure of $150,000 for their accommodation, as proposed by this\r\nbill, is in accordance with sound business principles or consistent with\r\nthat economy in public affairs which has been promised to the people.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 10, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 5546, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the erection of a public building at Asheville, N.C.\"\r\n\r\nIf the needs of the Government are alone considered, the proposed\r\nbuilding is only necessary for the accommodation of two terms of the\r\nUnited States court in each year and to provide an office for the clerk\r\nof that court and more commodious quarters for the post-office.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the court are now held in the county court room at\r\nAsheville at an expense to the Government of $50 for each term; the\r\nclerk of the court occupies a room for which an annual rent of $150 is\r\npaid, and the rent paid for the rooms occupied by the post-office is\r\n$180 each year.\r\n\r\nThe postmaster reports that four employees are regularly engaged in his\r\noffice, which is now rated as third class.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the court could be much more conveniently provided\r\nfor in a new building if one should be erected; but it is represented to\r\nme that the regular terms held at Asheville last only two or three weeks\r\neach, though special terms are ordered at times to clear the docket. It\r\nis difficult to see from any facts presented in support of this bill why\r\nthe United States court does not find accommodations which fairly answer\r\nits needs in the rooms now occupied by it. The floor space furnished for\r\nthe terms of the Federal court is stated to be 75 by 100 feet, which, it\r\nmust be admitted, provides a very respectable court room.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted that the necessity to the Government of a proper place\r\nto hold its courts is the only consideration which should have any\r\nweight in determining upon the propriety of expending the money which\r\nwill be necessary to erect the proposed new building.\r\n\r\nThe limit of its cost is fixed in the bill under consideration at the\r\nsum of $80,000, but the history of such projects justifies the\r\nexpectation that this limit will certainly be exceeded.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the present necessity for this building is not\r\nurgent, and that something may be gained by a delay which will\r\ndemonstrate more fully the public needs, and thus better suggest the\r\nstyle and size of the building to be erected.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 30, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 63, entitled \"An act to\r\nauthorize the construction of a highway bridge across that part of the\r\nwaters of Lake Champlain lying between the towns of North Hero and\r\nAlburg, in the State of Vermont.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 20th day of June, 1884, a bill was approved and became a law\r\nhaving the same title and containing precisely the same provisions and\r\nin the exact words of the bill herewith returned.\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department indicate that nothing has been done\r\ntoward building the bridge permitted by such prior act. It is hardly\r\npossible that the bill now before me is intended to authorize an\r\nadditional bridge between the two towns named, and I have been unable to\r\ndiscover any excuse or necessity for new legislation on the subject.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, that Congress in passing this bill acted in\r\nignorance of the fact that a law providing for its objects and purposes\r\nwas already on the statute book.\r\n\r\nMy approval of the bill is withheld for this reason and in order to\r\nprevent an unnecessary and confusing multiplicity of laws.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 30, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without my approval House bill No. 1391, entitled \"An\r\nact to provide for the erection of a public building at Springfield, Mo.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives to which this bill was referred that the city of\r\nSpringfield is in a thriving condition, with stores, banks, and\r\nmanufactories, and having, with North Springfield, which is an adjoining\r\ntown, about 20,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNo Federal courts are held at this place, and apparently the only\r\nquarters which the Government should provide are such as are necessary\r\nfor the accommodation of the post-office and the land-office located\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe postmaster reports that six employees are engaged in his office.\r\n\r\nThe rooms used as a post-office are now furnished the Government free of\r\nexpense, and the rent paid for the quarters occupied as a land-office\r\namounts to $300 annually.\r\n\r\nUpon the facts presented I am satisfied that the business of the\r\nGovernment at this point can be well transacted for the present without\r\nthe construction of the proposed building.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2160, entitled \"A bill\r\ngranting a pension to Mary J. Hagerman.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this proposed beneficiary enlisted in 1861 and was\r\nwounded by a gunshot, which seriously injured his left forearm. In 1864\r\nhe was discharged; was afterwards pensioned for his wound, and died in\r\nAugust, 1884.\r\n\r\nDr. Hageman, who attended the deceased in his last illness, testifies\r\nthat he was called to attend him in August, 1884; that he was sick with\r\ntyphomalarial fever, and that upon inquiry he (the physician) found that\r\nit was caused by hard work or overexertion and exposure. He was ill for\r\nabout ten days.\r\n\r\nThe application of his widow for pension was rejected in 1885 on the\r\nground that the fatal disease was not due to military service.\r\n\r\nI am unable to discover how any different determination could have been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nTo grant a pension in this case would clearly contravene the present\r\npolicy of the Government, and either establish a precedent which, if\r\nfollowed, would allow a pension to the widow of every soldier wounded\r\nor disabled in the war, without regard to the cause of death, or would\r\nunjustly discriminate in favor of the few thus receiving the bounty of\r\nthe Government against many whose cases were equally meritorious.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval Senate bill No. 1421, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to William H. Weaver.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant named in this bill enlisted August 12, 1862, and was\r\nmustered out of service June 12, 1865. During his service he was treated\r\nin hospital for diarrhea and lumbago, and in the reports for May and\r\nJune, as well as July and August, 1864, he is reported as absent sick.\r\n\r\nHe filed his application for pension in November, 1877, alleging that in\r\nMarch, 1863, he contracted measles, and in May, 1864, remittent fever,\r\nand that as a result of the two attacks he was afflicted with weakness\r\nin the limbs and eyes. He made statements afterwards in support of his\r\napplication that he was also troubled in the service with rheumatism and\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\nThe case was examined by several special examiners, from which, as\r\nreported to me, it appeared from the claimant's admission that he had\r\nsore eyes previous to his enlistment, though he claimed they were sound\r\nwhen he entered the Army.\r\n\r\nA surgeon who made an examination in March, 1881, reported that he could\r\nnot find any evidence whatever of disease of the eyes, and nothing to\r\ncorroborate the claimant's assertion that he was suffering from\r\nrheumatism, piles, or diarrhea.\r\n\r\nAnother surgeon, who examined the claimant in 1879, reported that he\r\nfound the eyelids slightly granulated, producing some irritation of the\r\neyeball and rendering the eyes a little weak, and that he found no other\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 a surgeon who made an examination reported that he discovered\r\nindications that the claimant had suffered at some time with chronic\r\nophthalmia, but that in his opinion his eyes did not disable him in the\r\nleast, and that the claimant was well nourished and in good health.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee to whom this bill was referred in the Senate\r\nstates that six special examinations have been made in the case and that\r\ntwo of them were favorable to the claim.\r\n\r\nThe trouble and expense incurred by the Pension Bureau to ascertain the\r\ntruth and to deal fairly by this claimant, and the entire absence of any\r\nsuspicion of bias against the claim in that Bureau, ought to give weight\r\nto its determination.\r\n\r\nThe claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau in July, 1885, upon the\r\nground that disease of the eyes existed prior to enlistment and that the\r\nevidence failed to show that there had existed a pensionable degree of\r\ndisability, since discharge, from diarrhea or rheumatism.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this is not a case where there was a lack of\r\nthe technical proof required by the Pension Bureau, but that its\r\njudgment was based upon the merits of the application and affected the\r\nvery foundation of the claim.\r\n\r\nI think it should be sustained; and its correctness is somewhat\r\nstrengthened by the fact that the claimant continued in active service\r\nfor more than a year after his alleged sickness, that after filing his\r\nclaim he added thereto allegations of additional disabilities, and that\r\nhe made no application for pension until more than twelve years after\r\nhis discharge.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 3363, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Jennette Dow.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the claimant enlisted August 7, 1862; received a gunshot\r\nwound in his left knee in September, 1863, and was mustered out with his\r\ncompany June 10, 1865. He was pensioned for his wound in 1878 at the\r\nrate of $4 per month, dating from the time of his discharge, which\r\namount was increased to $8 per month from June 4, 1880. The pensioned\r\nsoldier died December 17, 1882, and in 1883 his widow, the claimant,\r\nfiled an application for pension, alleging that her husband's death\r\nresulted from his wound. Her claim was rejected in 1885 upon the ground\r\nthat death was not caused by the wound.\r\n\r\nThe physician who was present at the time of the death certifies that\r\nthe same resulted from apoplexy in twelve hours after the deceased was\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nIt also appears from the statement of this physician that the deceased\r\nwas employed for years after his discharge from the Army as a railroad\r\nconductor, and that at the time of his death he had with difficulty\r\nreached his home. He then describes as following the attack the usual\r\nmanifestations of apoplexy, and adds that he regards the case as one of\r\n\"hemiplegia, the outgrowth primarily of nerve injury, aggravated by the\r\nlife's calling, and eventuating in apoplexy as stated.\"\r\n\r\nEvidence is filed in the Pension Bureau showing that after his discharge\r\nhe was more or less troubled with his wound, though one witness\r\ntestifies that he railroaded with him for fifteen years after his\r\ninjury. I find no medical testimony referred to which with any\r\ndistinctness charges death to the wound, and it would be hardly credible\r\nif such evidence was found.\r\n\r\nI am sure that in no case except in an application for pension would an\r\nattempt be made in the circumstances here developed to attribute death\r\nfrom apoplexy to a wound in the knee received nineteen years before the\r\napoplectic attack.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9106, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Rachel Barnes.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Barnes, the husband of the beneficiary named in this bill,\r\nenlisted in the United States infantry in February, 1838, and was\r\ndischarged February 24, 1841.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he applied for a pension, alleging that while serving in Florida\r\nin 1840 and 1841 he contracted disease of the eyes. He procured\r\nconsiderable evidence in support of his claim, but in 1882, and while\r\nstill endeavoring to furnish further proof, he committed suicide by\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nThe inference that his death thus occasioned was the result of\r\ndespondency and despair brought on by his failure to procure a pension,\r\nwhile it adds a sad feature to the case, does not aid in connecting his\r\ndeath with his military service.\r\n\r\nThat this was the view of the committee of the House to whom the bill\r\nwas referred is evidenced by the conclusion of their report in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  And while your committee do not feel justified under the law as at\r\n  present existing in recommending that the name of the widow be placed\r\n  upon the pension roll for the purpose of a pension in her own right as\r\n  widow of the deceased soldier and by reason of the soldier's death,\r\n  they do think that she should be allowed such pension as, had her\r\n  husband's claim been favorably determined on the day of his decease,\r\n  he would have received.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet the bill under consideration directs the Secretary of the\r\nInterior to place this widow's name on the pension roll and to \"pay her\r\na pension as such widow from and after the passage of this act, subject\r\nto the provisions and limitations of the pension laws.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 8336, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting an increase of pension to Duncan Forbes.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted, under the name of Alexander\r\nSheret, January 7, 1862, in the Regular Army, and was discharged January\r\n8, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe applied for a pension in 1879, alleging that he was wounded in his\r\nright breast December 31, 1862, and in his right ankle September 20,\r\n1863. He was pensioned in 1883, dating from January 9, 1865, for the\r\nankle wound, but that part of his claim based upon the wound in his\r\nbreast was rejected upon the ground that there was no record of the same\r\nand the testimony failed to show that such a wound had its origin in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThough the lack of such a record is sufficiently accounted for, I am\r\nconvinced that, conceding both the wounds alleged were received, this\r\npensioner has been fairly and justly treated.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the allegations of his application to the Pension Bureau\r\nthat after the wound in his breast, in December, 1862, he continued his\r\nservice till September, 1863, when he was wounded again in the ankle,\r\nand that with both wounds he served until his discharge in January,\r\n1865. It also appears from the records that after his discharge from\r\nthe. Army, and on the 3d day of February, 1865, he enlisted as landsman\r\nin the United States Navy, and served in that branch of the service for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nA medical examination in May, 1885, disclosed the appearance of a\r\ngunshot wound in the right breast, which is thus described:\r\n\r\n  The missile struck the seventh rib of right side and glanced off,\r\n  leaving a horizontal scar 2-1/4 inches long and one-half inch wide,\r\n  deeply depressed and firmly adherent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI credit this claimant with being a good soldier, and I am willing to\r\nbelieve that his insistence upon a greater pension than that already\r\nallowed by the Pension Bureau, under liberal general laws, enacted for\r\nthe benefit of himself and all his comrades, is the result of the\r\ndemoralization produced by ill-advised special legislation on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 4, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5389, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Ann Kinney.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary applied for a pension in 1877 as the widow of Edward\r\nKinney, alleging that he died September 5, 1875, from the effects of a\r\nwound received in the Army. He enlisted November 4, 1861, and was\r\ndischarged July 28, 1862, on account of a gunshot wound in his left\r\nelbow, for which wound he was pensioned in the year 1865.\r\n\r\nA physician testifies that the pensioned soldier's death was, in his\r\nopinion, brought on indirectly by the intemperate use of intoxicating\r\nliquors, and that he died from congestion of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe marshal of the city where he resided states that on the day of the\r\nsoldier's death he was called to remove him from a house in which he was\r\nmaking a disturbance, and that finding him intoxicated he arrested him\r\nand took him to the lockup and placed him in a cell. In a short time,\r\nnot exceeding an hour, thereafter he was found dead. He further states\r\nthat he was addicted to periodical sprees.\r\n\r\nAnother statement is made that the soldier was an intemperate man, and\r\ndied very suddenly in the city lockup, where he had been taken by an\r\nofficer while on a drunken spree.\r\n\r\nThis is not a pleasant recital, and as against the widow I should be\r\nglad to avoid its effect. But the most favorable phase of the case does\r\nnot aid her, since her claim rests upon the allegation that her husband\r\nwas subject to epileptic fits and died from congestion of the brain\r\nwhile in one of these fits.

He was wounded, while in the line of his duty in the\r\n  United States Army, at Fredericksburg, Va., December 13, 1862. Said\r\n  wound is not the cause of his disability.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, and in the year 1879, he filed affidavits claiming that he\r\nwas wounded by a minie ball at the battle of Fredericksburg, December\r\n13, 1862, and was injured by falling down an embankment.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 he filed an affidavit in which he stated that the disability for\r\nwhich he claims a pension arose from injuries received in falling down a\r\nbank at Fredericksburg and being tramped on by troops, causing a\r\ncomplication of diseases resulting in general debility.\r\n\r\nThe statement in the certificate of discharge from his second enlistment\r\nas to the wound he received by a minie ball at Fredericksburg was of\r\ncourse derived from his own statement, as it was related to a prior term\r\nof service.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Adjutant-General's Office furnish no evidence of\r\nwounds or injury at Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\nThe injury alleged at first as a consequence of loading commissary\r\nstores seems to have been abandoned by the claimant for the adoption\r\nof a wound at Fredericksburg, which in its turn seems to have been\r\nabandoned and a fall down a bank and trampling upon by troops\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nWhatever injuries he may have suffered during his first enlistment, and\r\nto whatever cause he chooses at last to attribute them, they did not\r\nprevent his reenlistment and passing the physical examination necessary\r\nbefore acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon of the Ninth New Hampshire Volunteers, in which he first\r\nenlisted, states that he remembers the claimant well; that he was\r\nmustered and accepted as a recruit in spite of his (the surgeon's)\r\nprotest; that he was physically unfit for duty; that he had the\r\nappearance of impaired health, and that his face and neck were marked by\r\none or more deep scars, the result, as the claimant himself alleged, of\r\nscrofulous abscesses in early youth. He expresses the opinion that he is\r\nattempting to palm off these old scars as evidence of wounds received,\r\nand that if he had been wounded as he claimed he (the surgeon) would\r\nhave known it and remembered it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that whenever in this case a wound is described it is located\r\nin the jaw, while some of the medical testimony negatives the existence\r\nof any wound.\r\n\r\nThe contrariety of the claimant's statements and the testimony and\r\ncircumstances tend so strongly to impeach his claim that I do not think\r\nthe decision of the Pension Bureau should be reversed and the claimant\r\npensioned.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 4, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval House bill No. 7234, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Susan Hawes.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is the mother of Jeremiah Hawes, who\r\nenlisted in February, 1861, in the United States artillery, and was\r\ndischarged in February, 1864. He filed a claim for pension in 1881,\r\nalleging that in 1862, by the premature discharge of a cannon, he\r\nsustained paralysis of his right arm and side. In 1883, while his claim\r\nwas still pending, he died.\r\n\r\nHe does not appear to have made his home with his mother altogether,\r\nif at all. For some years prior to his death and at the time of its\r\noccurrence he was an inmate, or had been an inmate, of a soldiers' home\r\nin Ohio.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be said of the character of any injuries he may have\r\nreceived in the service or of his relations to his mother, the cause of\r\nhis death, it seems to me, can not possibly upon any reasonable theory\r\nbe attributable to any incident of his military service.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in July, 1883, while the deceased was on his way from\r\nBuffalo, where he had been in a hospital, to the soldiers' home in Ohio,\r\nhe attempted to step on a slowly moving freight train, and making a\r\nmisstep a wheel of the car passed over his foot, injuring it so badly\r\nthat it was deemed necessary by two physicians who were called to\r\namputate the foot. An anaesthetic was administered preparatory to the\r\noperation, but before it was entered upon the injured man died, having\r\nsurvived the accident but two hours.\r\n\r\nThe physicians who were present stated that in their opinion death was\r\ndue to heart disease.\r\n\r\nThe above account of the death of the soldier is derived from a report\r\nfurnished by the Pension Bureau, and differs somewhat from the statement\r\ncontained in the report of the House Committee on Invalid Pensions as\r\nrelated to the intention of the physicians to amputate the injured foot\r\nand their administration of an anaesthetic. But the accident and the\r\ndeath two hours thereafter under the treatment of the physicians are\r\nconceded facts.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 4, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 1584, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Mrs. Aurelia C.

PRUDEN,\r\n  _Assistant Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act for the relief of Francis W. Haldeman.\"--Received July 28,\r\n1886.]\r\n\r\nThis bill appropriates $200 to the party named therein \"as compensation\r\nfor services performed and money expended for the benefit of the United\r\nStates Army.\" It appears from a report of the House Committee on War\r\nClaims that in the fall of 1863 Haldeman, a lad 12 years of age,\r\npurchased a uniform and armed himself and attached himself to various\r\nOhio regiments, and, as is said, performed various duties connected with\r\nthe army service until the end of the year 1864, and for this it is\r\nproposed to give him $200.\r\n\r\nOf course he never enlisted and never was regularly attached to any\r\nregiment. What kind of arms this boy 12 years of age armed himself with\r\nis not stated, and it is quite evident that his military service could\r\nnot have amounted to much more than the indulgence of a boyish freak and\r\nhis being made a pet of the soldiers with whom he was associated. There\r\nis a pleasant sentiment connected with this display of patriotism and\r\nchildish military ardor, and it is not a matter of surprise that he\r\nshould, as stated by the committee, have \"received honorable mention by\r\nname in the history of his regiment;\" but when it is proposed twenty-two\r\nyears after his one year's experience with troops to pay him a sum\r\nnearly if not quite equal to the pay of a soldier who fought and\r\nsuffered all the dangers and privations of a soldier's life, I am\r\nconstrained to dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act for the relief of R.D. Beckley and Leon Howard.\"--Received July\r\n28, 1886.]\r\n\r\nThese two men were employed by the Doorkeeper of the Forty-eighth\r\nCongress as laborers at the rate of $720 per annum.\r\n\r\nThey claim that in both sessions of that Congress they not only\r\nperformed the duties appertaining to their positions as laborers, but\r\nalso performed the full duties of messengers. Having received their pay\r\nas laborers, this bill proposes to appropriate for them the difference\r\nbetween their compensation as laborers and $1,200, the pay allowed\r\nmessengers.\r\n\r\nCongress, in appropriation bills covering the period in which these men\r\nclaim to have performed these dual duties, provided for a certain\r\nspecified number of messengers and a fixed number of laborers. They both\r\naccepted the latter position. If they actually performed the duties of\r\nboth places, their ability to do so is evidence that the labor of either\r\nplace was very light. In any case they owed their time and services to\r\nthe Government, and while they were performing the duties of messengers\r\nthey were not engaged in the harder tasks which might have been required\r\nof them as laborers. They ought not to complain if they have received\r\nthe amount for which they agreed to work, and which was allowed for as\r\nthe wages of a place which they were glad enough to secure. If they\r\nreally did the work of both places, I don't see why they should not be\r\npaid both compensations. This proposition of course would not be\r\nentertained for a moment.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that claims for extra compensation such as these\r\nshould be firmly discountenanced, and I am sure no injustice will be\r\ndone by my declining to approve this bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act for the relief of Thomas P. Morgan, jr.\"--Received July 31,\r\n1886.--Memorandum.]\r\n\r\nThomas P. Morgan, jr., in the year 1881 entered into a contract with the\r\nGovernment to do certain excavating in the harbor of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nHe performed considerable of the work, but though the time limited by\r\nthe contract for the completion was extended by the Government, he\r\nfailed to complete the work, which necessitated other arrangements, to\r\nthe damage of the Government in quite a large sum. His contract was\r\nforfeited by the Government because the progress he made was so slow and\r\nunsatisfactory. It seems that a certain percentage of the money earned\r\nby him in the progress of the work was, under the terms of the contract,\r\nretained by the Government to insure its completion, and when work was\r\nterminated the sum thus retained amounted to $4,898.04, which sum was\r\njustly forfeited to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe object of this bill is to waive this forfeiture and pay this sum to\r\nthe derelict contractor.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as I am unable to see any equities in this case that should\r\novercome the fact that the amount of loss to the Government through the\r\ncontract is greater than the sum thus sought to be released to him, I am\r\nnot willing to agree to his release from the consequence of his failure\r\nto perform his contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act for the relief of Charles F.

Bowers, while acting as regimental\r\nquartermaster in 1862, received of John Weeks, assistant quartermaster\r\nof volunteers, the sum of $230, for which he gave a receipt. On the\r\nsettlement of his accounts he was unable to account for said sum, for\r\nthe reason, as he alleges, that certain of his papers were lost and\r\ndestroyed. Thus in the statement of his account he is represented as a\r\ndebtor of the Government in that amount.\r\n\r\nThis bill directs that a credit be allowed to him of the said sum of\r\n$230. But since his account was adjusted as above stated, showing him in\r\ndebt to the Government in the amount last stated, he has paid the sum of\r\n$75 and been allowed a credit of $125 for the value of a horse; so that\r\nwhatever may be said of the merits of his claim that he should not be\r\ncharged with the sum of $230, if he should now be credited with that sum\r\nthe Government would owe him upon its books the sum of $30.\r\n\r\nThe bill is therefore not approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act to provide for the erection of a public building in the city of\r\nAnnapolis, Md.\"--Received August 3, 1886.--Memorandum.]\r\n\r\nThe post-office at Annapolis is now accommodated in quarters for which\r\nthe Government pays rent at the rate of $500 per annum, and the office\r\noccupied by the collector of customs is rented for $75 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no other use for a public building at Annapolis than\r\nis above indicated, and the chief argument urged why a building should\r\nbe constructed there is based upon the fact that this city is the\r\ncapital of the State of Maryland and should have a Government building\r\nbecause most if not all the other capitals of the States have such\r\nedifices.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be so little necessity for the building proposed for the\r\ntransaction of Government business, and if there is anything in the\r\nargument last referred to it seems so well answered by the maintenance\r\nof the Naval Academy at Annapolis, this bill is allowed to remain\r\ninoperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act for the relief of J.A.

Green. This account has been once paid, a special act\r\ndirecting such payment having been approved February 12, 1885.

Not only\r\nis their time and labor due to the Government, but they should\r\nscrupulously avoid in their political action, as well as in the\r\ndischarge of their official duty, offending by a display of obtrusive\r\npartisanship their neighbors who have relations with them as public\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nThey should also constantly remember that their party friends from whom\r\nthey have received preferment have not invested them with the power of\r\narbitrarily managing their political affairs. They have no right as\r\nofficeholders to dictate the political action of their party associates\r\nor to throttle freedom of action within party lines by methods and\r\npractices which pervert every useful and justifiable purpose of party\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Federal officeholders should not be felt in the\r\nmanipulation of political primary meetings and nominating conventions.\r\nThe use by these officials of their positions to compass their selection\r\nas delegates to political conventions is indecent and unfair; and proper\r\nregard for the proprieties and requirements of official place will also\r\nprevent their assuming the active conduct of political campaigns.\r\n\r\nIndividual interest and activity in political affairs are by no means\r\ncondemned. Officeholders are neither disfranchised nor forbidden the\r\nexercise of political privileges, but their privileges are not enlarged\r\nnor is their duty to party increased to pernicious activity by\r\nofficeholding.\r\n\r\nA just discrimination in this regard between the things a citizen may\r\nproperly do and the purposes for which a public office should not be\r\nused is easy in the light of a correct appreciation of the relation\r\nbetween the people and those intrusted with official place and a\r\nconsideration of the necessity under our form of government of political\r\naction free from official coercion.\r\n\r\nYou are requested to communicate the substance of these views to those\r\nfor whose guidance they are intended.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the power vested in the President by the\r\nConstitution, and by virtue of the seventeen hundred and fifty-third\r\nsection of the Revised Statutes and of the civil-service act approved\r\nJanuary 16, 1883, the following rule for the regulation and improvement\r\nof the executive civil service is hereby amended and promulgated, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE IX.\r\n\r\n  All applications for regular competitive examinations for admission to\r\n  the classified civil service must be made on blank forms to be\r\n  prescribed by the Commission.\r\n\r\n  Requests for blank forms of application for competitive examination for\r\n  admission to the classified civil service and all regular applications\r\n  for such examination shall be made--\r\n\r\n  1.

Few questions have arisen during\r\nthe past year with other governments, and none of those are beyond the\r\nreach of settlement in friendly counsel.\r\n\r\nWe are as yet without provision for the settlement of claims of citizens\r\nof the United States against Chile for injustice during the late war\r\nwith Peru and Bolivia. The mixed commissions organized under claims\r\nconventions concluded by the Chilean Government with certain European\r\nStates have developed an amount of friction which we trust can be\r\navoided in the convention which our representative at Santiago is\r\nauthorized to negotiate.\r\n\r\nThe cruel treatment of inoffensive Chinese has, I regret to say, been\r\nrepeated in some of the far Western States and Territories, and acts of\r\nviolence against those people, beyond the power of the local constituted\r\nauthorities to prevent and difficult to punish, are reported even in\r\ndistant Alaska. Much of this violence can be traced to race prejudice\r\nand competition of labor, which can not, however, justify the oppression\r\nof strangers whose safety is guaranteed by our treaty with China equally\r\nwith the most favored nations.\r\n\r\nIn opening our vast domain to alien elements the purpose of our\r\nlaw-givers was to invite assimilation, and not to provide an arena for\r\nendless antagonism. The paramount duty of maintaining public order and\r\ndefending the interests of our own people may require the adoption of\r\nmeasures of restriction, but they should not tolerate the oppression\r\nof individuals of a special race. I am not without assurance that the\r\nGovernment of China, whose friendly disposition toward us I am most\r\nhappy to recognize, will meet us halfway in devising a comprehensive\r\nremedy by which an effective limitation of Chinese emigration, joined to\r\nprotection of those Chinese subjects who remain in this country, may be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nLegislation is needed to execute the provisions of our Chinese\r\nconvention of 1880 touching the opium traffic.\r\n\r\nWhile the good will of the Colombian Government toward our country is\r\nmanifest, the situation of American interests on the Isthmus of Panama\r\nhas at times excited concern and invited friendly action looking to the\r\nperformance of the engagements of the two nations concerning the\r\nterritory embraced in the interoceanic transit. With the subsidence of\r\nthe Isthmian disturbances and the erection of the State of Panama into a\r\nfederal district under the direct government of the constitutional\r\nadministration at Bogota, a new order of things has been inaugurated,\r\nwhich, although as yet somewhat experimental and affording scope for\r\narbitrary-exercise of power by the delegates of the national authority,\r\npromises much improvement.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy between the people of the United States and France, born\r\nduring our colonial struggle for independence and continuing to-day, has\r\nreceived a fresh impulse in the successful completion and dedication of\r\nthe colossal statue of \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" in New York\r\nHarbor--the gift of Frenchmen to Americans.\r\n\r\nA convention between the United States and certain other powers for the\r\nprotection of submarine cables was signed at Paris on March 14, 1884,\r\nand has been duly ratified and proclaimed by this Government. By\r\nagreement between the high contracting parties this convention is to go\r\ninto effect on the 1st of January next, but the legislation required for\r\nits execution in the United States has not yet been adopted. I earnestly\r\nrecommend its enactment.\r\n\r\nCases have continued to occur in Germany giving rise to much\r\ncorrespondence in relation to the privilege of sojourn of our\r\nnaturalized citizens of German origin revisiting the land of their\r\nbirth, yet I am happy to state that our relations with that country have\r\nlost none of their accustomed cordiality.\r\n\r\nThe claims for interest upon the amount of tonnage dues illegally\r\nexacted from certain German steamship lines were favorably reported in\r\nboth Houses of Congress at the last session, and I trust will receive\r\nfinal and favorable action at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations contained in my last annual message in relation to a\r\nmode of settlement of the fishery rights in the waters of British North\r\nAmerica, so long a subject of anxious difference between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, was met by an adverse vote of the Senate on\r\nApril 13 last, and thereupon negotiations were instituted to obtain an\r\nagreement with Her Britannic Majesty's Government for the promulgation\r\nof such joint interpretation and definition of the article of the\r\nconvention of 1818 relating to the territorial waters and inshore\r\nfisheries of the British Provinces as should secure the Canadian rights\r\nfrom encroachment by the United States fishermen and at the same time\r\ninsure the enjoyment by the latter of the privileges guaranteed to them\r\nby such convention.\r\n\r\nThe questions involved are of long standing, of grave consequence, and\r\nfrom time to time for nearly three-quarters of a century have given rise\r\nto earnest international discussions, not unaccompanied by irritation.\r\n\r\nTemporary arrangements by treaties have served to allay friction, which,\r\nhowever, has revived as each treaty was terminated. The last\r\narrangement, under the treaty of 1871, was abrogated after due notice by\r\nthe United States on June 30, 1885, but I was enabled to obtain for our\r\nfishermen for the remainder of that season enjoyment of the full\r\nprivileges accorded by the terminated treaty.\r\n\r\nThe joint high commission by whom the treaty had been negotiated,\r\nalthough invested with plenary power to make a permanent settlement,\r\nwere content with a temporary arrangement, after the termination of\r\nwhich the question was relegated to the stipulations of the treaty of\r\n1818, as to the first article of which no construction satisfactory to\r\nboth countries has ever been agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilization and growth of population in the British\r\nProvinces to which the fisheries in question are contiguous and the\r\nexpansion of commercial intercourse between them and the United States\r\npresent to-day a condition of affairs scarcely realizable at the date of\r\nthe negotiations of 1818.\r\n\r\nNew and vast interests have been brought into existence; modes of\r\nintercourse between the respective countries have been invented and\r\nmultiplied; the methods of conducting the fisheries have been wholly\r\nchanged; and all this is necessarily entitled to candid and careful\r\nconsideration in the adjustment of the terms and conditions of\r\nintercourse and commerce between the United States and their neighbors\r\nalong a frontier of over 3,500 miles.\r\n\r\nThis propinquity, community of language and occupation, and similarity\r\nof political and social institutions indicate the practicability and\r\nobvious wisdom of maintaining mutually beneficial and friendly\r\nrelations. Whilst I am unfeignedly desirous that such relations should\r\nexist between us and the inhabitants of Canada, yet the action of their\r\nofficials during the past season toward our fishermen has been such as\r\nto seriously threaten their continuance.\r\n\r\nAlthough disappointed in my efforts to secure a satisfactory settlement\r\nof the fishery question, negotiations are still pending, with reasonable\r\nhope that before the close of the present session of Congress\r\nannouncement may be made that an acceptable conclusion has been reached.\r\n\r\nAs at an early day there may be laid before Congress the correspondence\r\nof the Department of State in relation to this important subject, so\r\nthat the history of the past fishing season may be fully disclosed and\r\nthe action and the attitude of the Administration clearly comprehended,\r\na more extended reference is not deemed necessary in this communication.\r\nThe recommendation submitted last year that provision be made for a\r\npreliminary reconnoissance of the conventional boundary line between\r\nAlaska and British Columbia is renewed.\r\n\r\nI express my unhesitating conviction that the intimacy of our relations\r\nwith Hawaii should be emphasized. As a result of the reciprocity treaty\r\nof 1875, those islands, on the highway of Oriental and Australasian\r\ntraffic, are virtually an outpost of American commerce and a\r\nstepping-stone to the growing trade of the Pacific. The Polynesian\r\nIsland groups have been so absorbed by other and more powerful\r\ngovernments that the Hawaiian Islands are left almost alone in the\r\nenjoyment of their autonomy, which it is important for us should be\r\npreserved. Our treaty is now terminable on one year's notice, but\r\npropositions to abrogate it would be, in my judgment, most ill advised.\r\nThe paramount influence we have there acquired, once relinquished, could\r\nonly with difficulty be regained, and a valuable ground of vantage for\r\nourselves might be converted into a stronghold for our commercial\r\ncompetitors. I earnestly recommend that the existing treaty stipulations\r\nbe extended for a further term of seven years. A recently signed treaty\r\nto this end is now before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe importance of telegraphic communication between those islands and\r\nthe United States should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe question of a general revision of the treaties of Japan is again\r\nunder discussion at Tokyo. As the first to open relations with that\r\nEmpire, and as the nation in most direct commercial relations with\r\nJapan, the United States have lost no opportunity to testify their\r\nconsistent friendship by supporting the just claims of Japan to autonomy\r\nand independence among nations.\r\n\r\nA treaty of extradition between the United States and Japan, the first\r\nconcluded by that Empire, has been lately proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Liberia and the difficulty of maintaining effective\r\nsovereignty over its outlying districts have exposed that Republic to\r\nencroachment. It can not be forgotten that this distant community is\r\nan offshoot of our own system, owing its origin to the associated\r\nbenevolence of American citizens, whose praiseworthy efforts to create\r\na nucleus of civilization in the Dark Continent have commanded respect\r\nand sympathy everywhere, especially in this country. Although a formal\r\nprotectorate over Liberia is contrary to our traditional policy, the\r\nmoral right and duty of the United States to assist in all proper\r\nways in the maintenance of its integrity is obvious, and has been\r\nconsistently announced during nearly half a century. I recommend that in\r\nthe reorganization of our Navy a small vessel, no longer found adequate\r\nto our needs, be presented to Liberia, to be employed by it in the\r\nprotection of its coastwise revenues.\r\n\r\nThe encouraging development of beneficial and intimate relations between\r\nthe United States and Mexico, which has been so marked within the past\r\nfew years, is at once the occasion of congratulation and of friendly\r\nsolicitude. I urgently renew my former representation of the need of\r\nspeedy legislation by Congress to carry into effect the reciprocity\r\ncommercial convention of January 20, 1883.\r\n\r\nOur commercial treaty of 1831 with Mexico was terminated, according to\r\nits provisions, in 1881, upon notification given by Mexico in pursuance\r\nof her announced policy of recasting all her commercial treaties. Mexico\r\nhas since concluded with several foreign governments new treaties of\r\ncommerce and navigation, defining alien rights of trade, property, and\r\nresidence, treatment of shipping, consular privileges, and the like.\r\nOur yet unexecuted reciprocity convention of 1883 covers none of these\r\npoints, the settlement of which is so necessary to good relationship.\r\nI propose to initiate with Mexico negotiations for a new and enlarged\r\ntreaty of commerce and navigation.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate, I communicated to that\r\nbody on August 2 last, and also to the House of Representatives,[6] the\r\ncorrespondence in the case of A.K. Cutting, an American citizen, then\r\nimprisoned in Mexico, charged with the commission of a penal offense in\r\nTexas, of which a Mexican citizen was the object.\r\n\r\nAfter demand had been made for his release the charge against him was\r\namended so as to include a violation of Mexican law within Mexican\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThis joinder of alleged offenses, one within and the other exterior to\r\nMexico, induced me to order a special investigation of the case, pending\r\nwhich Mr. Cutting was released.\r\n\r\nThe incident has, however, disclosed a claim of jurisdiction by Mexico\r\nnovel in our history, whereby any offense committed anywhere by a\r\nforeigner, penal in the place of its commission, and of which a Mexican\r\nis the object, may, if the offender be found in Mexico, be there tried\r\nand punished in conformity with Mexican laws.\r\n\r\nThis jurisdiction was sustained by the courts of Mexico in the Cutting\r\ncase, and approved by the executive branch of that Government, upon the\r\nauthority of a Mexican statute. The appellate court in releasing Mr.\r\nCutting decided that the abandonment of the complaint by the Mexican\r\ncitizen aggrieved by the alleged crime (a libelous publication) removed\r\nthe basis of further prosecution, and also declared justice to have been\r\nsatisfied by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence.\r\n\r\nThe admission of such a pretension would be attended with serious\r\nresults, invasive of the jurisdiction of this Government and highly\r\ndangerous to our citizens in foreign lands. Therefore I have denied it\r\nand protested against its attempted exercise as unwarranted by the\r\nprinciples of law and international usages.\r\n\r\nA sovereign has jurisdiction of offenses which take effect within his\r\nterritory, although concocted or commenced outside of it; but the right\r\nis denied of any foreign sovereign to punish a citizen of the United\r\nStates for an offense consummated on our soil in violation of our laws,\r\neven though the offense be against a subject or citizen of such\r\nsovereign. The Mexican statute in question makes the claim broadly, and\r\nthe principle, if conceded, would create a dual responsibility in the\r\ncitizen and lead to inextricable confusion, destructive of that\r\ncertainty in the law which is an essential of liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen citizens of the United States voluntarily go into a foreign\r\ncountry, they must abide by the laws there in force, and will not be\r\nprotected by their own Government from the consequences of an offense\r\nagainst those laws committed in such foreign country; but watchful care\r\nand interest of this Government over its citizens are not relinquished\r\nbecause they have gone abroad, and if charged with crime committed in\r\nthe foreign land a fair and open trial, conducted with decent regard for\r\njustice and humanity, will be demanded for them. With less than that\r\nthis Government will not be content when the life or liberty of its\r\ncitizens is at stake.\r\n\r\nWhatever the degree to which extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction may\r\nhave been formerly allowed by consent and reciprocal agreement among\r\ncertain of the European States, no such doctrine or practice was ever\r\nknown to the laws of this country or of that from which our institutions\r\nhave mainly been derived.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mexico there are reasons especially strong for perfect\r\nharmony in the mutual exercise of jurisdiction. Nature has made us\r\nirrevocably neighbors, and wisdom and kind feeling should make us\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe overflow of capital and enterprise from the United States is a\r\npotent factor in assisting the development of the resources of Mexico\r\nand in building up the prosperity of both countries.\r\n\r\nTo assist this good work all grounds of apprehension for the security of\r\nperson and property should be removed; and I trust that in the interests\r\nof good neighborhood the statute referred to will be so modified as to\r\neliminate the present possibilities of danger to the peace of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Netherlands has exhibited concern in relation to\r\ncertain features of our tariff laws, which are supposed by them to be\r\naimed at a class of tobacco produced in the Dutch East Indies. Comment\r\nwould seem unnecessary upon the unwisdom of legislation appearing to\r\nhave a special national discrimination for its object, which, although\r\nunintentional, may give rise to injurious retaliation.\r\n\r\nThe establishment, less than four years ago, of a legation at Teheran is\r\nbearing fruit in the interest exhibited by the Shah's Government in the\r\nindustrial activity of the United States and the opportunities of\r\nbeneficial interchanges.\r\n\r\nStable government is now happily restored in Peru by the election of a\r\nconstitutional President, and a period of rehabilitation is entered\r\nupon; but the recovery is necessarily slow from the exhaustion caused by\r\nthe late war and civil disturbances. A convention to adjust by\r\narbitration claims of our citizens has been proposed and is under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe naval officer who bore to Siberia the testimonials bestowed by\r\nCongress in recognition of the aid given to the _Jeannette_\r\nsurvivors has successfully accomplished his mission. His interesting\r\nreport will be submitted. It is pleasant to know that this mark of\r\nappreciation has been welcomed by the Russian Government and people as\r\nbefits the traditional friendship of the two countries.\r\n\r\nCivil perturbations in the Samoan Islands have during the past\r\nfew years been a source of considerable embarrassment to the three\r\nGovernments--Germany, Great Britain, and the United States--whose\r\nrelations and extraterritorial rights in that important group are\r\nguaranteed by treaties. The weakness of the native administration and\r\nthe conflict of opposing interests in the islands have led King Malietoa\r\nto seek alliance or protection in some one quarter, regardless of the\r\ndistinct engagements whereby no one of the three treaty powers may\r\nacquire any paramount or exclusive interest. In May last Malietoa\r\noffered to place Samoa under the protection of the United States, and\r\nthe late consul, without authority, assumed to grant it. The proceeding\r\nwas promptly disavowed and the overzealous official recalled. Special\r\nagents of the three Governments have been deputed to examine the\r\nsituation in the islands. With a change in the representation of all\r\nthree powers and a harmonious understanding between them, the peace,\r\nprosperity, autonomous administration, and neutrality of Samoa can\r\nhardly fail to be secured.\r\n\r\nIt appearing that the Government of Spain did not extend to the flag of\r\nthe United States in the Antilles the full measure of reciprocity\r\nrequisite under our statute for the continuance of the suspension of\r\ndiscriminations against the Spanish flag in our ports, I was constrained\r\nin October last[7] to rescind my predecessor's proclamation of February\r\n14, 1884,[8] permitting such suspension. An arrangement was, however,\r\nspeedily reached, and upon notification from the Government of Spain\r\nthat all differential treatment of our vessels and their cargoes, from\r\nthe United States or from any foreign country, had been completely and\r\nabsolutely relinquished, I availed myself of the discretion conferred by\r\nlaw and issued on the 27th of October my proclamation[9] declaring\r\nreciprocal suspension in the United States. It is most gratifying to\r\nbear testimony to the earnest spirit in which the Government of the\r\nQueen Regent has met our efforts to avert the initiation of commercial\r\ndiscriminations and reprisals, which are ever disastrous to the material\r\ninterests and the political good will of the countries they may affect.\r\n\r\nThe profitable development of the large commercial exchanges between\r\nthe United States and the Spanish Antilles is naturally an object of\r\nsolicitude. Lying close at our doors, and finding here their main\r\nmarkets of supply and demand, the welfare of Cuba and Puerto Rico and\r\ntheir production and trade are scarcely less important to us than to\r\nSpain. Their commercial and financial movements are so naturally a part\r\nof our system that no obstacle to fuller and freer intercourse should be\r\npermitted to exist. The standing instructions of our representatives at\r\nMadrid and Havana have for years been to leave no effort unessayed to\r\nfurther these ends, and at no time has the equal good desire of Spain\r\nbeen more hopefully manifested than now.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Spain, by removing the consular tonnage fees on\r\ncargoes shipped to the Antilles and by reducing passport fees, has shown\r\nits recognition of the needs of less trammeled intercourse.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made during the past year to remove the hindrances to\r\nthe proclamation of the treaty of naturalization with the Sublime Porte,\r\nsigned in 1874, which has remained inoperative owing to a disagreement\r\nof interpretation of the clauses relative to the effects of the return\r\nto and sojourn of a naturalized citizen in the land of origin. I trust\r\nsoon to be able to announce a favorable settlement of the differences as\r\nto this interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt has been highly satisfactory to note the improved treatment of\r\nAmerican missionaries in Turkey, as has been attested by their\r\nacknowledgments to our late minister to that Government of his\r\nsuccessful exertions in their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of the convention of December 5, 1885,\r\nwith Venezuela, for the reopening of the awards of the Caracas\r\nCommission under the claims convention of 1866, has not yet been\r\neffected, owing to the delay of the Executive of that Republic in\r\nratifying the measure. I trust that this postponement will be brief; but\r\nshould it much longer continue, the delay may well be regarded as a\r\nrescission of the compact and a failure on the part of Venezuela to\r\ncomplete an arrangement so persistently sought by her during many years\r\nand assented to by this Government in a spirit of international\r\nfairness, although to the detriment of holders of _bona fide_\r\nawards of the impugned commission.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation of my last annual message that existing\r\nlegislation concerning citizenship and naturalization be revised. We\r\nhave treaties with many states providing for the renunciation of\r\ncitizenship by naturalized aliens, but no statute is found to give\r\neffect to such engagements, nor any which provides a needed central\r\nbureau for the registration of naturalized citizens.\r\n\r\nExperience suggests that our statutes regulating extradition might\r\nbe advantageously amended by a provision for the transit across our\r\nterritory, now a convenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign\r\ncountry to another, of fugitives surrendered by a foreign government to\r\na third state. Such provisions are not unusual in the legislation of\r\nother countries, and tend to prevent the miscarriage of justice. It is\r\nalso desirable, in order to remove present uncertainties, that authority\r\nshould be conferred on the Secretary of State to issue a certificate, in\r\ncase of an arrest for the purpose of extradition, to the officer before\r\nwhom the proceeding is pending, showing that a requisition for the\r\nsurrender of the person charged has been duly made. Such a certificate,\r\nif required to be received before the prisoner's examination, would\r\nprevent a long and expensive judicial inquiry into a charge which the\r\nforeign government might not desire to press. I also recommend that\r\nexpress provision be made for the immediate discharge from custody of\r\npersons committed for extradition where the President is of opinion that\r\nsurrender should not be made.\r\n\r\nThe drift of sentiment in civilized communities toward full recognition\r\nof the rights of property in the creations of the human intellect has\r\nbrought about the adoption by many important nations of an international\r\ncopyright convention, which was signed at Berne on the 18th of\r\nSeptember, 1885.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Constitution gives to the Congress the power \"to promote\r\nthe progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to\r\nauthors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings\r\nand discoveries,\" this Government did not feel warranted in becoming a\r\nsignatory pending the action of Congress upon measures of international\r\ncopyright now before it; but the right of adhesion to the Berne\r\nconvention hereafter has been reserved. I trust the subject will receive\r\nat your hands the attention it deserves, and that the just claims of\r\nauthors, so urgently pressed, will be duly heeded.\r\n\r\nRepresentations continue to be made to me of the injurious effect upon\r\nAmerican artists studying abroad and having free access to the art\r\ncollections of foreign countries of maintaining a discriminating duty\r\nagainst the introduction of the works of their brother artists of other\r\ncountries, and I am induced to repeat my recommendation for the\r\nabolition of that tax.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a provision of the diplomatic and consular appropriation act\r\napproved July 1, 1886, the estimates submitted by the Secretary of State\r\nfor the maintenance of the consular service have been recast on the\r\nbasis of salaries for all officers to whom such allowance is deemed\r\nadvisable. Advantage has been taken of this to redistribute the salaries\r\nof the offices now appropriated for, in accordance with the work\r\nperformed, the importance of the representative duties of the incumbent,\r\nand the cost of living at each post. The last consideration has been too\r\noften lost sight of in the allowances heretofore made. The compensation\r\nwhich may suffice for the decent maintenance of a worthy and capable\r\nofficer in a position of onerous and representative trust at a post\r\nreadily accessible, and where the necessaries of life are abundant and\r\ncheap, may prove an inadequate pittance in distant lands, where the\r\nbetter part of a year's pay is consumed in reaching the post of duty,\r\nand where the comforts of ordinary civilized existence can only be\r\nobtained with difficulty and at exorbitant cost. I trust that in\r\nconsidering the submitted schedules no mistaken theory of economy will\r\nperpetuate a system which in the past has virtually closed to deserving\r\ntalent many offices where capacity and attainments of a high order are\r\nindispensable, and in not a few instances has brought discredit on our\r\nnational character and entailed embarrassment and even suffering on\r\nthose deputed to uphold our dignity and interests abroad.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I earnestly reiterate the practical\r\nnecessity of supplying some mode of trustworthy inspection and report of\r\nthe manner in which the consulates are conducted. In the absence of such\r\nreliable information efficiency can scarcely be rewarded or its opposite\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nIncreasing competition in trade has directed attention to the value of\r\nthe consular reports printed by the Department of State, and the efforts\r\nof the Government to extend the practical usefulness of these reports\r\nhave created a wider demand for them at home and a spirit of emulation\r\nabroad. Constituting a record of the changes occurring in trade and of\r\nthe progress of the arts and invention in foreign countries, they are\r\nmuch sought for by all interested in the subjects which they embrace.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury exhibits in detail the\r\ncondition of the public finances and of the several branches of the\r\nGovernment related to his Department. I especially direct the attention\r\nof the Congress to the recommendations contained in this and the last\r\npreceding report of the Secretary touching the simplification and\r\namendment of the laws relating to the collection of our revenues, and in\r\nthe interest of economy and justice to the Government I hope they may be\r\nadopted by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ended June\r\n30, 1886, were $336,439,727.06. Of this amount $192,905,023.41 was\r\nreceived from customs and $116,805,936.48 from internal revenue. The\r\ntotal receipts, as here stated, were $13,749,020.68 greater than for the\r\nprevious year, but the increase from customs was $11,434,084.10 and from\r\ninternal revenue $4,407,210.94, making a gain in these items for the\r\nlast year of $15,841,295.04, a falling off in other resources reducing\r\nthe total increase to the smaller amount mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe expense at the different custom-houses of collecting this increased\r\ncustoms revenue was less than the expense attending the collection of\r\nsuch revenue for the preceding year by $490,608, and the increased\r\nreceipts of internal revenue were collected at a cost to the\r\nInternal-Revenue Bureau $155,944.99 less than the expense of such\r\ncollection for the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe total ordinary expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1886, were $242,483,138.50, being less by $17,788,797 than such\r\nexpenditures for the year preceding, and leaving a surplus in the\r\nTreasury at the close of the last fiscal year of $93,956,588.56, as\r\nagainst $63,463,771.27 at the close of the previous year, being an\r\nincrease in such surplus of $30,492,817.29.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures are compared with those of the preceding fiscal year\r\nand classified as follows:\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n                                              Year ending     Year ending\r\n                                            June 30, 1886.

The application of the surplus to the payment of such\r\nportion of the public debt as is now at our option subject to\r\nextinguishment, if continued at the rate which has lately prevailed,\r\nwould retire that class of indebtedness within less than one year from\r\nthis date. Thus a continuation of our present revenue system would soon\r\nresult in the receipt of an annual income much greater than necessary to\r\nmeet Government expenses, with no indebtedness upon which it could be\r\napplied. We should then be confronted with a vast quantity of money, the\r\ncirculating medium of the people, hoarded in the Treasury when it should\r\nbe in their hands, or we should be drawn into wasteful public\r\nextravagance, with all the corrupting national demoralization which\r\nfollows in its train.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the simple existence of this surplus and its threatened\r\nattendant evils which furnish the strongest argument against our present\r\nscale of Federal taxation. Its worst phase is the exaction of such a\r\nsurplus through a perversion of the relations between the people and\r\ntheir Government and a dangerous departure from the rules which limit\r\nthe right of Federal taxation.\r\n\r\nGood government, and especially the government of which every American\r\ncitizen boasts, has for its objects the protection of every person\r\nwithin its care in the greatest liberty consistent with the good order\r\nof society and his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earnings\r\nwith the least possible diminution for public needs. When more of the\r\npeople's substance is exacted through the form of taxation than is\r\nnecessary to meet the just obligations of the Government and the expense\r\nof its economical administration, such exaction becomes ruthless\r\nextortion and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe indirect manner in which these exactions are made has a tendency to\r\nconceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a\r\nstage of superfluous revenue which has aroused the people to a\r\nrealization of the fact that the amount raised professedly for the\r\nsupport of the Government is paid by them as absolutely if added to the\r\nprice of the things which supply their daily wants as if it was paid at\r\nfixed periods into the hand of the taxgatherer.\r\n\r\nThose who toil for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital,\r\nthough sometimes vaunting its importance and clamoring for the\r\nprotection and favor of the Government, is dull and sluggish till,\r\ntouched by the magical hand of labor, it springs into activity,\r\nfurnishing an occasion for Federal taxation and gaining the value which\r\nenables it to bear its burden. And the laboring man is thoughtfully\r\ninquiring whether in these circumstances, and considering the tribute he\r\nconstantly pays into the public Treasury as he supplies his daily wants,\r\nhe receives his fair share of advantages.\r\n\r\nThere is also a suspicion abroad that the surplus of our revenues\r\nindicates abnormal and exceptional business profits, which, under the\r\nsystem which produces such surplus, increase without corresponding\r\nbenefit to the people at large the vast accumulations of a few among our\r\ncitizens, whose fortunes, rivaling the wealth of the most favored in\r\nantidemocratic nations, are not the natural growth of a steady, plain,\r\nand industrious republic.\r\n\r\nOur farmers, too, and those engaged directly and indirectly in supplying\r\nthe products of agriculture, see that day by day, and as often as the\r\ndaily wants of their households recur, they are forced to pay excessive\r\nand needless taxation, while their products struggle in foreign markets\r\nwith the competition of nations, which, by allowing a freer exchange of\r\nproductions than we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which\r\ndistress the American farmer.\r\n\r\nAs every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride\r\nof our people in American citizenship and in the glory of our national\r\nachievements and progress, a sentiment prevails that the leading strings\r\nuseful to a nation in its infancy may well be to a great extent\r\ndiscarded in the present stage of American ingenuity, courage, and\r\nfearless self-reliance; and for the privilege of indulging this\r\nsentiment with true American enthusiasm our citizens are quite willing\r\nto forego an idle surplus in the public Treasury.\r\n\r\nAnd all the people know that the average rate of Federal taxation upon\r\nimports is to-day, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some\r\narticles of necessary consumption it is actually more, than was imposed\r\nby the grievous burden willingly borne at a time when the Government\r\nneeded millions to maintain by war the safety and integrity of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the Government to collect the principal part\r\nof its revenues by a tax upon imports, and no change in this policy is\r\ndesirable. But the present condition of affairs constrains our people to\r\ndemand that by a revision of our revenue laws the receipts of the\r\nGovernment shall be reduced to the necessary expense of its economical\r\nadministration; and this demand should be recognized and obeyed by the\r\npeople's representatives in the legislative branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn readjusting the burdens of Federal taxation a sound public policy\r\nrequires that such of our citizens as have built up large and important\r\nindustries under present conditions should not be suddenly and to their\r\ninjury deprived of advantages to which they have adapted their business;\r\nbut if the public good requires it they should be content with such\r\nconsideration as shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interests,\r\nwhile the just demand of the people for relief from needless taxation is\r\nhonestly answered.\r\n\r\nA reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be\r\npossible without disastrous shock to any interest; and a cheerful\r\nconcession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the\r\noutgrowth of impatience and delayed justice.\r\n\r\nDue regard should be also accorded in any proposed readjustment to the\r\ninterests of American labor so far as they are involved. We congratulate\r\nourselves that there is among us no laboring class fixed within\r\nunyielding bounds and doomed under all conditions to the inexorable fate\r\nof daily toil. We recognize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the\r\nRepublic, and we treat those who have it in their keeping as citizens\r\nentitled to the most careful regard and thoughtful attention. This\r\nregard and attention should be awarded them, not only because labor is\r\nthe capital of our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of\r\nGovernment favor, but for the further and not less important reason that\r\nthe laboring man, surrounded by his family in his humble home, as a\r\nconsumer is vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of living\r\nand enables him to bring within his domestic circle additional comforts\r\nand advantages.\r\n\r\nThis relation of the workingman to the revenue laws of the country and\r\nthe manner in which it palpably influences the question of wages should\r\nnot be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper\r\nmaintenance of the supply and protection of well-paid labor. And these\r\nconsiderations suggest such an arrangement of Government revenues as\r\nshall reduce the expense of living, while it does not curtail the\r\nopportunity for work nor reduce the compensation of American labor and\r\ninjuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it holds in the\r\nestimation of our people.\r\n\r\nBut our farmers and agriculturists--those who from the soil produce the\r\nthings consumed by all--are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned\r\nthan any other of our citizens in a just and careful system of Federal\r\ntaxation. Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with\r\nthis kind of work number nearly one-half of our population. None labor\r\nharder or more continuously than they. No enactments limit their hours\r\nof toil and no interposition of the Government enhances to any great\r\nextent the value of their products. And yet for many of the necessaries\r\nand comforts of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables them to\r\nbring into their homes, and for their implements of husbandry, they are\r\nobliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit, which\r\nby the action of the Government is given to the more favored\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\nI recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the\r\nincreasing and unnecessary surplus of national income annually\r\naccumulating be released to the people by an amendment to our revenue\r\nlaws which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give\r\nfreer entrance to such imported materials as by American labor may be\r\nmanufactured into marketable commodities.\r\n\r\nNothing can be accomplished, however, in the direction of this\r\nmuch-needed reform unless the subject is approached in a patriotic\r\nspirit of devotion to the interests of the entire country and with a\r\nwillingness to yield something for the public good.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid upon the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1886, was $44,551,043.36.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months ended October 31, 1886, 3 per cent bonds were\r\ncalled for redemption amounting to $127,283,100, of which $80,643,200\r\nwas so called to answer the requirements of the law relating to the\r\nsinking fund and $46,639,900 for the purpose of reducing the public debt\r\nby application of a part of the surplus in the Treasury to that object.\r\nOf the bonds thus called $102,269,450 became subject under such calls to\r\nredemption prior to November 1, 1886. The remainder, amounting to\r\n$25,013,650, matured under the calls after that date.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the amount subject to payment and cancellation prior\r\nto November 1, there were also paid before that day certain of these\r\nbonds, with the interest thereon, amounting to $5,072,350, which were\r\nanticipated as to their maturity, of which $2,664,850 had not been\r\ncalled. Thus $107,341,800 had been actually applied prior to the 1st of\r\nNovember, 1886, to the extinguishment of our bonded and interest-bearing\r\ndebt, leaving on that day still outstanding the sum of $1,153,443,112.\r\nOf this amount $86,848,700 were still represented by 3 per cent bonds.\r\nThey, however, have been since November 1, or will at once be, further\r\nreduced by $22,606,150, being bonds which have been called, as already\r\nstated, but not redeemed and canceled before the latter date.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, there were coined, under the\r\ncompulsory silver-coinage act of 1878, 29,838,905 silver dollars, and\r\nthe cost of the silver used in such coinage was $23,448,960.01. There\r\nhad been coined up to the close of the previous fiscal year under the\r\nprovisions of the law 203,882,554 silver dollars, and on the 1st day of\r\nDecember, 1886, the total amount of such coinage was $247,131,549.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Mint reports that at the time of the passage of the\r\nlaw of 1878 directing this coinage the intrinsic value of the dollars\r\nthus coined was 94-1/4 cents each, and that on the 31st day of July,\r\n1886, the price of silver reached the lowest stage ever known, so that\r\nthe intrinsic or bullion price of our standard silver dollar at that\r\ndate was less than 72 cents. The price of silver on the 30th day of\r\nNovember last was such as to make these dollars intrinsically worth 78\r\ncents each.\r\n\r\nThese differences in value of the coins represent the fluctuations in\r\nthe price of silver, and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory\r\ncoinage by the Government enhances the price of that commodity or\r\nsecures uniformity in its value.\r\n\r\nEvery fair and legal effort has been made by the Treasury Department\r\nto distribute this currency among the people. The withdrawal of\r\nUnited States Treasury notes of small denominations and the issuing\r\nof small silver certificates have been resorted to in the endeavor to\r\naccomplish this result, in obedience to the will and sentiments of\r\nthe representatives of the people in the Congress. On the 27th day\r\nof November, 1886, the people held of these coins, or certificates\r\nrepresenting them, the nominal sum of $166,873,041, and we still had\r\n$79,464,345 in the Treasury, as against about $142,894,055 so in the\r\nhands of the people and $72,865,376 remaining in the Treasury one year\r\nago. The Director of the Mint again urges the necessity of more vault\r\nroom for the purpose of storing these silver dollars which are not\r\nneeded for circulation by the people.\r\n\r\nI have seen no reason to change the views expressed in my last annual\r\nmessage on the subject of this compulsory coinage, and I again urge its\r\nsuspension on all the grounds contained in my former recommendation,\r\nreenforced by the significant increase of our gold exportations during\r\nthe last year, as appears by the comparative statement herewith\r\npresented, and for the further reasons that the more this currency is\r\ndistributed among the people the greater becomes our duty to protect it\r\nfrom disaster, that we now have abundance for all our needs, and that\r\nthere seems but little propriety in building vaults to store such\r\ncurrency when the only pretense for its coinage is the necessity of its\r\nuse by the people as a circulating medium.\r\n\r\nThe great number of suits now pending in the United States courts for\r\nthe southern district of New York growing out of the collection of\r\ncustoms revenue at the port of New York and the number of such suits\r\nthat are almost daily instituted are certainly worthy the attention of\r\nthe Congress. These legal controversies, based upon conflicting views by\r\nimporters and the collector as to the interpretation of our present\r\ncomplex and indefinite revenue laws, might be largely obviated by an\r\namendment of those laws.\r\n\r\nBut pending such amendment the present condition of this litigation\r\nshould be relieved. There are now pending about 2,500 of these suits.\r\nMore than 1,100 have been commenced within the past eighteen months, and\r\nmany of the others have been at issue for more than twenty-five years.\r\nThese delays subject the Government to loss of evidence and prevent the\r\npreparation necessary to defeat unjust and fictitious claims, while\r\nconstantly accruing interest threatens to double the demands involved.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of the dockets of the courts, well filled with\r\nprivate suits, and of the force allowed the district attorney, no\r\ngreater than is necessary for the ordinary and current business of his\r\noffice, these revenue litigations can not be considered.\r\n\r\nIn default of the adoption by the Congress of a plan for the general\r\nreorganization of the Federal courts, as has been heretofore\r\nrecommended, I urge the propriety of passing a law permitting the\r\nappointment of an additional Federal judge in the district where these\r\nGovernment suits have accumulated, so that by continuous sessions of the\r\ncourts devoted to the trial of these cases they may be determined.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely plain that a great saving to the Government would be\r\naccomplished by such a remedy, and the suitors who have honest claims\r\nwould not be denied justice through delay.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War gives a detailed account of the\r\nadministration of his Department and contains sundry recommendations for\r\nthe improvement of the service, which I fully approve.\r\n\r\nThe Army consisted at the date of the last consolidated return of 2,103\r\nofficers and 24,946 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Department for the last fiscal year were\r\n$36,990,903.38, including $6,294,305.43 for public works and river and\r\nharbor improvements.\r\n\r\nI especially direct the attention of the Congress to the recommendation\r\nthat officers be required to submit to an examination as a preliminary\r\nto their promotion. I see no objection, but many advantages, in adopting\r\nthis feature, which has operated so beneficially in our Navy Department,\r\nas well as in some branches of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe subject of coast defenses and fortifications has been fully and\r\ncarefully treated by the Board on Fortifications, whose report was\r\nsubmitted at the last session of Congress; but no construction work of\r\nthe kind recommended by the board has been possible during the last year\r\nfrom the lack of appropriations for such purpose.\r\n\r\nThe defenseless condition of our seacoast and lake frontier is perfectly\r\npalpable. The examinations made must convince us all that certain of our\r\ncities named in the report of the board should be fortified and that\r\nwork on the most important of these fortifications should be commenced\r\nat once. The work has been thoroughly considered and laid out, the\r\nSecretary of War reports, but all is delayed in default of Congressional\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe absolute necessity, judged by all standards of prudence and\r\nforesight, of our preparation for an effectual resistance against the\r\narmored ships and steel guns and mortars of modern construction which\r\nmay threaten the cities on our coasts is so apparent that I hope\r\neffective steps will be taken in that direction immediately.\r\n\r\nThe valuable and suggestive treatment of this question by the Secretary\r\nof War is earnestly commended to the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn September and October last the hostile Apaches who, under the\r\nleadership of Geronimo, had for eighteen months been on the war path,\r\nand during that time had committed many murders and been the cause of\r\nconstant terror to the settlers of Arizona, surrendered to General\r\nMiles, the military commander who succeeded General Crook in the\r\nmanagement and direction of their pursuit.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of their surrender as then reported, and in view of the\r\nunderstanding which these murderous savages seemed to entertain of the\r\nassurances given them, it was considered best to imprison them in such\r\nmanner as to prevent their ever engaging in such outrages again, instead\r\nof trying them for murder. Fort Pickens having been selected as a safe\r\nplace of confinement, all the adult males were sent thither and will be\r\nclosely guarded as prisoners. In the meantime the residue of the band,\r\nwho, though still remaining upon the reservation, were regarded as\r\nunsafe and suspected of furnishing aid to those on the war path, had\r\nbeen removed to Fort Marion. The women and larger children of the\r\nhostiles were also taken there, and arrangements have been made for\r\nputting the children of proper age in Indian schools.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a detailed exhibit of\r\nthe condition of his Department, with such a statement of the action\r\nneeded to improve the same as should challenge the earnest attention of\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nThe present Navy of the United States, aside from the ships in course of\r\nconstruction, consists of--\r\n\r\nFirst. Fourteen single-turreted monitors, none of which are in\r\ncommission nor at the present time serviceable. The batteries of these\r\nships are obsolete, and they can only be relied upon as auxiliary ships\r\nin harbor defense, and then after such an expenditure upon them as might\r\nnot be deemed justifiable.\r\n\r\nSecond. Five fourth-rate vessels of small tonnage, only one of which was\r\ndesigned as a war vessel, and all of which are auxiliary merely.\r\n\r\nThird. Twenty-seven cruising ships, three of which are built of iron, of\r\nsmall tonnage, and twenty-four of wood. Of these wooden vessels it is\r\nestimated by the Chief Constructor of the Navy that only three will be\r\nserviceable beyond a period of six years, at which time it may be said\r\nthat of the present naval force nothing worthy the name will remain.\r\n\r\nAll the vessels heretofore authorized are under contract or in course\r\nof construction except the armored ships, the torpedo and dynamite\r\nboats, and one cruiser. As to the last of these, the bids were in excess\r\nof the limit fixed by Congress. The production in the United States of\r\narmor and gun steel is a question which it seems necessary to settle\r\nat an early day if the armored war vessels are to be completed with\r\nthose materials of home manufacture. This has been the subject of\r\ninvestigation by two boards and by two special committees of Congress\r\nwithin the last three years. The report of the Gun Foundry Board in\r\n1884, of the Board on Fortifications made in January last, and the\r\nreports of the select committees of the two Houses made at the last\r\nsession of Congress have entirely exhausted the subject, so far as\r\npreliminary investigation is involved, and in their recommendations they\r\nare substantially agreed.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the present invitation of the Department for bids to\r\nfurnish such of this material as is now authorized shall fail to induce\r\ndomestic manufacturers to undertake the large expenditures required to\r\nprepare for this new manufacture, and no other steps are taken by\r\nCongress at its coming session, the Secretary contemplates with\r\ndissatisfaction the necessity of obtaining abroad the armor and the gun\r\nsteel for the authorized ships. It would seem desirable that the wants\r\nof the Army and the Navy in this regard should be reasonably met, and\r\nthat by uniting their contracts such inducement might be offered as\r\nwould result in securing the domestication of these important interests.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the postal service show marked and gratifying improvement\r\nduring the past year. A particular account of its transactions and\r\ncondition is given in the report of the Postmaster-General, which will\r\nbe laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the rate of letter postage in 1883, rendering the\r\npostal revenues inadequate to sustain the expenditures, and business\r\ndepression also contributing, resulted in an excess of cost for the\r\nfiscal year ended June 30, 1885, of eight and one-third millions of\r\ndollars. An additional check upon receipts by doubling the measure of\r\nweight in rating sealed correspondence and diminishing one-half the\r\ncharge for newspaper carriage was imposed by legislation which took\r\neffect with the beginning of the past fiscal year, while the constant\r\ndemand of our territorial development and growing population for the\r\nextension and increase of mail facilities and machinery necessitates\r\nsteady annual advance in outlay, and the careful estimate of a year ago\r\nupon the rates of expenditure then existing contemplated the unavoidable\r\naugmentation of the deficiency in the last fiscal year by nearly\r\n$2,000,000. The anticipated revenue for the last year failed of\r\nrealization by about $64,000, but proper measures of economy have so\r\nsatisfactorily limited the growth of expenditure that the total\r\ndeficiency in fact fell below that of 1885, and at this time the\r\nincrease of revenue is in a gaining ratio over the increase of cost,\r\ndemonstrating the sufficiency of the present rates of postage ultimately\r\nto sustain the service. This is the more pleasing because our people\r\nenjoy now both cheaper postage proportionably to distances and a vaster\r\nand more costly service than any other upon the globe.\r\n\r\nRetrenchment has been effected in the cost of supplies, some\r\nexpenditures unwarranted by law have ceased, and the outlays for mail\r\ncarriage have been subjected to beneficial scrutiny. At the close of the\r\nlast fiscal year the expense of transportation on star routes stood at\r\nan annual rate of cost less by over $560,000 than at the close of the\r\nprevious year and steamboat and mail-messenger service at nearly\r\n$200,000 less.\r\n\r\nThe service has been in the meantime enlarged and extended by the\r\nestablishment of new offices, increase of routes of carriage, expansion\r\nof carrier-delivery conveniences, and additions to the railway mail\r\nfacilities, in accordance with the growing exigencies of the country and\r\nthe long-established policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General calls attention to the existing law for\r\ncompensating railroads and expresses the opinion that a method may be\r\ndevised which will prove more just to the carriers and beneficial to the\r\nGovernment; and the subject appears worthy of your early consideration.\r\n\r\nThe differences which arose during the year with certain of the ocean\r\nsteamship companies have terminated by the acquiescence of all in the\r\npolicy of the Government approved by the Congress in the postal\r\nappropriation at its last session, and the Department now enjoys the\r\nutmost service afforded by all vessels which sail from our ports upon\r\neither ocean--a service generally adequate to the needs of our\r\nintercourse. Petitions have, however, been presented to the Department\r\nby numerous merchants and manufacturers for the establishment of a\r\ndirect service to the Argentine Republic and for semimonthly dispatches\r\nto the Empire of Brazil, and the subject is commended to your\r\nconsideration. It is an obvious duty to provide the means of postal\r\ncommunication which our commerce requires, and with prudent forecast of\r\nresults the wise extension of it may lead to stimulating intercourse and\r\nbecome the harbinger of a profitable traffic which will open new avenues\r\nfor the disposition of the products of our industry. The circumstances\r\nof the countries at the far south of our continent are such as to invite\r\nour enterprise and afford the promise of sufficient advantages to\r\njustify an unusual effort to bring about the closer relations which\r\ngreater freedom of communication would tend to establish.\r\n\r\nI suggest that, as distinguished from a grant or subsidy for the mere\r\nbenefit of any line of trade or travel, whatever outlay may be required\r\nto secure additional postal service, necessary and proper and not\r\notherwise attainable, should be regarded as within the limit of\r\nlegitimate compensation for such service.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the free-delivery service as suggested by the\r\nPost-master-General has heretofore received my sanction, and it is to be\r\nhoped a suitable enactment may soon be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe request for an appropriation sufficient to enable the general\r\ninspection of fourth-class offices has my approbation.\r\n\r\nI renew my approval of the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that\r\nanother assistant be provided for the Post-Office Department, and I\r\ninvite your attention to the several other recommendations in his\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Department of Justice for the last fiscal year is\r\nfully detailed in the report of the Attorney-General, and I invite the\r\nearnest attention of the Congress to the same and due consideration of\r\nthe recommendations therein contained.\r\n\r\nIn the report submitted by this officer to the last session of the\r\nCongress he strongly recommended the erection of a penitentiary for the\r\nconfinement of prisoners convicted and sentenced in the United States\r\ncourts, and he repeats the recommendation in his report for the last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of very great importance and should at once receive\r\nCongressional action. United States prisoners are now confined in more\r\nthan thirty different State prisons and penitentiaries scattered in\r\nevery part of the country. They are subjected to nearly as many\r\ndifferent modes of treatment and discipline and are far too much removed\r\nfrom the control and regulation of the Government. So far as they are\r\nentitled to humane treatment and an opportunity for improvement and\r\nreformation, the Government is responsible to them and society that\r\nthese things are forthcoming. But this duty can scarcely be discharged\r\nwithout more absolute control and direction than is possible under the\r\npresent system.\r\n\r\nMany of our good citizens have interested themselves, with the most\r\nbeneficial results, in the question of prison reform. The General\r\nGovernment should be in a situation, since there must be United States\r\nprisoners, to furnish important aid in this movement, and should be able\r\nto illustrate what may be practically done in the direction of this\r\nreform and to present an example in the treatment and improvement of its\r\nprisoners worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nWith prisons under its own control the Government could deal with the\r\nsomewhat vexed question of convict labor, so far as its convicts were\r\nconcerned, according to a plan of its own adoption, and with due regard\r\nto the rights and interests of our laboring citizens, instead of\r\nsometimes aiding in the operation of a system which causes among them\r\nirritation and discontent.\r\n\r\nUpon consideration of this subject it might be thought wise to erect\r\nmore than one of these institutions, located in such places as would\r\nbest subserve the purposes of convenience and economy in transportation.\r\nThe considerable cost of maintaining these convicts as at present, in\r\nState institutions, would be saved by the adoption of the plan proposed,\r\nand by employing them in the manufacture of such articles as were needed\r\nfor use by the Government quite a large pecuniary benefit would be\r\nrealized in partial return for our outlay.\r\n\r\nI again urge a change in the Federal judicial system to meet the wants\r\nof the people and obviate the delays necessarily attending the present\r\ncondition of affairs in our courts. All are agreed that something should\r\nbe done, and much favor is shown by those well able to advise to the\r\nplan suggested by the Attorney-General at the last session of the\r\nCongress and recommended in my last annual message. This recommendation\r\nis here renewed, together with another made at the same time, touching a\r\nchange in the manner of compensating district attorneys and marshals;\r\nand the latter subject is commended to the Congress for its action in\r\nthe interest of economy to the Government, and humanity, fairness, and\r\njustice to our people.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents a comprehensive\r\nsummary of the work of the various branches of the public service\r\nconnected with his Department, and the suggestions and recommendations\r\nwhich it contains for the improvement of the service should receive your\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit made of the condition of our Indian population and the\r\nprogress of the work for their enlightenment, notwithstanding the many\r\nembarrassments which hinder the better administration of this important\r\nbranch of the service, is a gratifying and hopeful one.\r\n\r\nThe funds appropriated for the Indian service for the fiscal year just\r\npassed, with the available income from Indian land and trust moneys,\r\namounting in all to $7,850,775.12, were ample for the service under the\r\nconditions and restrictions of laws regulating their expenditure. There\r\nremained a balance on hand on June 30, 1886, of $1,660,023.30, of which\r\n$1,337,768.21 are permanent funds for fulfillment of treaties and other\r\nlike purposes, and the remainder, $322,255.09, is subject to be carried\r\nto the surplus fund as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe estimates presented for appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year\r\namount to $5,608,873.64, or $442,386.20 less than those laid before the\r\nCongress last year.\r\n\r\nThe present system of agencies, while absolutely necessary and well\r\nadapted for the management of our Indian affairs and for the ends in\r\nview when it was adopted, is in the present stage of Indian management\r\ninadequate, standing alone, for the accomplishment of an object which\r\nhas become pressing in its importance--the more rapid transition from\r\ntribal organizations to citizenship of such portions of the Indians as\r\nare capable of civilized life.\r\n\r\nWhen the existing system was adopted, the Indian race was outside of the\r\nlimits of organized States and Territories and beyond the immediate\r\nreach and operation of civilization, and all efforts were mainly\r\ndirected to the maintenance of friendly relations and the preservation\r\nof peace and quiet on the frontier. All this is now changed. There is no\r\nsuch thing as the Indian frontier. Civilization, with the busy hum of\r\nindustry and the influences of Christianity, surrounds these people at\r\nevery point. None of the tribes are outside of the bounds of organized\r\ngovernment and society, except that the Territorial system has not been\r\nextended over that portion of the country known as the Indian Territory.\r\nAs a race the Indians are no longer hostile, but may be considered as\r\nsubmissive to the control of the Government. Few of them only are\r\ntroublesome. Except the fragments of several bands, all are now gathered\r\nupon reservations.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer possible for them to subsist by the chase and the\r\nspontaneous productions of the earth.\r\n\r\nWith an abundance of land, if furnished with the means and implements\r\nfor profitable husbandry, their life of entire dependence upon\r\nGovernment rations from day to day is no longer defensible. Their\r\ninclination, long fostered by a defective system of control, is to cling\r\nto the habits and customs of their ancestors and struggle with\r\npersistence against the change of life which their altered circumstances\r\npress upon them. But barbarism and civilization can not live together.\r\nIt is impossible that such incongruous conditions should coexist on the\r\nsame soil.\r\n\r\nThey are a portion of our people, are under the authority of our\r\nGovernment, and have a peculiar claim upon and are entitled to the\r\nfostering care and protection of the nation. The Government can not\r\nrelieve itself of this responsibility until they are so far trained and\r\ncivilized as to be able wholly to manage and care for themselves. The\r\npaths in which they should walk must be clearly marked out for them, and\r\nthey must be led or guided until they are familiar with the way and\r\ncompetent to assume the duties and responsibilities of our citizenship.\r\n\r\nProgress in this great work will continue only at the present slow pace\r\nand at great expense unless the system and methods of management are\r\nimproved to meet the changed conditions and urgent demands of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe agents, having general charge and supervision in many cases of more\r\nthan 5,000 Indians, scattered over large reservations, and burdened with\r\nthe details of accountability for funds and supplies, have time to look\r\nafter the industrial training and improvement of a few Indians only. The\r\nmany are neglected and remain idle and dependent, conditions not\r\nfavorable for progress and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe compensation allowed these agents and the conditions of the service\r\nare not calculated to secure for the work men who are fitted by ability\r\nand skill to properly plan and intelligently direct the methods best\r\nadapted to produce the most speedy results and permanent benefits.\r\n\r\nHence the necessity for a supplemental agency or system directed to the\r\nend of promoting the general and more rapid transition of the tribes\r\nfrom habits and customs of barbarism to the ways of civilization.\r\n\r\nWith an anxious desire to devise some plan of operation by which to\r\nsecure the welfare of the Indians and to relieve the Treasury as far as\r\npossible from the support of an idle and dependent population, I\r\nrecommended in my previous annual message the passage of a law\r\nauthorizing the appointment of a commission as an instrumentality\r\nauxiliary to those already established for the care of the Indians. It\r\nwas designed that this commission should be composed of six intelligent\r\nand capable persons--three to be detailed from the Army--having\r\npractical ideas upon the subject of the treatment of Indians and\r\ninterested in their welfare, and that it should be charged, under the\r\ndirection of the Secretary of the Interior, with the management of such\r\nmatters of detail as can not with the present organization be properly\r\nand successfully conducted, and which present different phases, as the\r\nIndians themselves differ in their progress, needs, disposition, and\r\ncapacity for improvement or immediate self-support.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of such a commission much unwise and useless expenditure of\r\nmoney, waste of materials, and unavailing efforts might be avoided; and\r\nit is hoped that this or some measure which the wisdom of Congress may\r\nbetter devise to supply the deficiency of the present system may receive\r\nyour consideration and the appropriate legislation be provided.\r\n\r\nThe time is ripe for the work of such an agency.\r\n\r\nThere is less opposition to the education and training of the Indian\r\nyouth, as shown by the increased attendance upon the schools, and there\r\nis a yielding tendency for the individual holding of lands. Development\r\nand advancement in these directions are essential, and should have every\r\nencouragement. As the rising generation are taught the language of\r\ncivilization and trained in habits of industry they should assume the\r\nduties, privileges, and responsibilities of citizenship.\r\n\r\nNo obstacle should hinder the location and settlement of any Indian\r\nwilling to take land in severalty; on the contrary, the inclination to\r\ndo so should be stimulated at all times when proper and expedient. But\r\nthere is no authority of law for making allotments on some of the\r\nreservations, and on others the allotments provided for are so small\r\nthat the Indians, though ready and desiring to settle down, are not\r\nwilling to accept such small areas when their reservations contain ample\r\nlands to afford them homesteads of sufficient size to meet their present\r\nand future needs.\r\n\r\nThese inequalities of existing special laws and treaties should be\r\ncorrected and some general legislation on the subject should be\r\nprovided, so that the more progressive members of the different tribes\r\nmay be settled upon homesteads, and by their example lead others to\r\nfollow, breaking away from tribal customs and substituting therefor the\r\nlove of home, the interest of the family, and the rule of the state.\r\n\r\nThe Indian character and nature are such that they are not easily led\r\nwhile brooding over unadjusted wrongs. This is especially so regarding\r\ntheir lands. Matters arising from the construction and operation of\r\nrailroads across some of the reservations, and claims of title and right\r\nof occupancy set up by white persons to some of the best land within\r\nother reservations require legislation for their final adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of these matters will remove many embarrassments to\r\nprogress in the work of leading the Indians to the adoption of our\r\ninstitutions and bringing them under the operation, the influence, and\r\nthe protection of the universal laws of our country.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior and the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office looking to the better protection\r\nof public lands and of the public surveys, the preservation of national\r\nforests, the adjudication of grants to States and corporations and of\r\nprivate land claims, and the increased efficiency of the public-land\r\nservice are commended to the attention of Congress. To secure the widest\r\ndistribution of public lands in limited quantities among settlers for\r\nresidence and cultivation, and thus make the greatest number of\r\nindividual homes, was the primary object of the public-land legislation\r\nin the early days of the Republic. This system was a simple one. It\r\ncommenced with an admirable scheme of public surveys, by which the\r\nhumblest citizen could identify the tract upon which he wished to\r\nestablish his home. The price of lands was placed within the reach of\r\nall the enterprising, industrious, and honest pioneer citizens of the\r\ncountry. It was soon, however, found that the object of the laws was\r\nperverted, under the system of cash sales, from a distribution of land\r\namong the people to an accumulation of land capital by wealthy and\r\nspeculative persons. To check this tendency a preference right of\r\npurchase was given to settlers on the land, a plan which culminated in\r\nthe general preemption act of 1841. The foundation of this system was\r\nactual residence and cultivation. Twenty years later the homestead law\r\nwas devised to more surely place actual homes in the possession of\r\nactual cultivators of the soil. The land was given without price, the\r\nsole conditions being residence, improvement, and cultivation. Other\r\nlaws have followed, each designed to encourage the acquirement and use\r\nof land in limited individual quantities. But in later years these laws,\r\nthrough vicious administrative methods and under changed conditions of\r\ncommunication and transportation, have been so evaded and violated that\r\ntheir beneficent purpose is threatened with entire defeat. The methods\r\nof such evasions and violations are set forth in detail in the reports\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice. The rapid appropriation of our public lands without _bona\r\nfide_ settlements or cultivation, and not only without intention of\r\nresidence, but for the purpose of their aggregation in large holdings,\r\nin many cases in the hands of foreigners, invites the serious and\r\nimmediate attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe energies of the Land Department have been devoted during the present\r\nAdministration to remedy defects and correct abuses in the public-land\r\nservice. The results of these efforts are so largely in the nature of\r\nreforms in the processes and methods of our land system as to prevent\r\nadequate estimate; but it appears by a compilation from the reports of\r\nthe Commissioner of the General Land Office that the immediate effect in\r\nleading cases which have come to a final termination has been the\r\nrestoration to the mass of public lands of 2,750,000 acres; that\r\n2,370,000 acres are embraced in investigations now pending before the\r\nDepartment or the courts, and that the action of Congress has been asked\r\nto effect the restoration of 2,790,000 acres additional; besides which\r\n4,000,000 acres have been withheld from reservation and the rights of\r\nentry thereon maintained.\r\n\r\nI recommend the repeal of the preemption and timber-culture acts, and\r\nthat the homestead laws be so amended as to better secure compliance\r\nwith their requirements of residence, improvement, and cultivation for\r\nthe period of five years from date of entry, without commutation or\r\nprovision for speculative relinquishment. I also recommend the repeal of\r\nthe desert-land laws unless it shall be the pleasure of the Congress to\r\nso amend these laws as to render them less liable to abuses. As the\r\nchief motive for an evasion of the laws and the principal cause of their\r\nresult in land accumulation instead of land distribution is the facility\r\nwith which transfers are made of the right intended to be secured to\r\nsettlers, it may be deemed advisable to provide by legislation some\r\nguards and checks upon the alienation of homestead rights and lands\r\ncovered thereby Until patents issue.\r\n\r\nLast year an Executive proclamation[10] was issued directing the removal\r\nof fences which inclosed the public domain. Many of these have been\r\nremoved in obedience to such order, but much of the public land still\r\nremains within the lines of these unlawful fences. The ingenious methods\r\nresorted to in order to continue these trespasses and the hardihood of\r\nthe pretenses by which in some cases such inclosures are justified are\r\nfully detailed in the report of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the fences still remaining which inclose public lands\r\nwill be enforced with all the authority and means with which the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government is or shall be invested by the\r\nCongress for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Pensions contains a detailed and most\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the operations of the Pension Bureau during the\r\nlast fiscal year. The amount of work done was the largest in any year\r\nsince the organization of the Bureau, and it has been done at less cost\r\nthan during the previous year in every division.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1886, there were 365,783 pensioners on the\r\nrolls of the Bureau.\r\n\r\nSince 1861 there have been 1,018,735 applications for pensions filed, of\r\nwhich 78,834 were based upon service in the War of 1812. There were\r\n621,754 of these applications allowed, including 60,178 to the soldiers\r\nof 1812 and their widows.\r\n\r\nThe total amount paid for pensions since 1861 is $808,624,811.57.\r\n\r\nThe number of new pensions allowed during the year ended June 30, 1886,\r\nis 40,857, a larger number than has been allowed in any year save one\r\nsince 1861. The names of 2,229 pensioners which had been previously\r\ndropped from the rolls were restored during the year, and after\r\ndeducting those dropped within the same time for various causes a net\r\nincrease remains for the year of 20,658 names.\r\n\r\nFrom January 1, 1861, to December 1, 1885, 1,967 private pension acts\r\nhad been passed. Since the last-mentioned date, and during the last\r\nsession of the Congress, 644 such acts became laws.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that no one can examine our pension establishment and its\r\noperations without being convinced that through its instrumentality\r\njustice can be very nearly done to all who are entitled under present\r\nlaws to the pension bounty of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut it is undeniable that cases exist, well entitled to relief, in which\r\nthe Pension Bureau is powerless to aid. The really worthy cases of this\r\nclass are such as only lack by misfortune the kind or quantity of proof\r\nwhich the law and regulations of the Bureau require, or which, though\r\ntheir merit is apparent, for some other reason can not be justly dealt\r\nwith through general laws. These conditions fully justify application to\r\nthe Congress and special enactments. But resort to the Congress for a\r\nspecial pension act to overrule the deliberate and careful determination\r\nof the Pension Bureau on the merits or to secure favorable action when\r\nit could not be expected under the most liberal execution of general\r\nlaws, it must be admitted opens the door to the allowance of\r\nquestionable claims and presents to the legislative and executive\r\nbranches of the Government applications concededly not within the law\r\nand plainly devoid of merit, but so surrounded by sentiment and\r\npatriotic feeling that they are hard to resist. I suppose it will not be\r\ndenied that many claims for pension are made without merit and that many\r\nhave been allowed upon fraudulent representations. This has been\r\ndeclared from the Pension Bureau, not only in this but in prior\r\nAdministrations.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness and the justice of any system for the distribution of\r\npensions depend upon the equality and uniformity of its operation.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the report of the Commissioner that there are now\r\npaid by the Government 131 different rates of pension.\r\n\r\nHe estimates from the best information he can obtain that 9,000 of those\r\nwho have served in the Army and Navy of the United States are now\r\nsupported, in whole or in part, from public funds or by organized\r\ncharities, exclusive of those in soldiers' homes under the direction and\r\ncontrol of the Government. Only 13 per cent of these are pensioners,\r\nwhile of the entire number of men furnished for the late war something\r\nlike 20 per cent, including their widows and relatives, have been or now\r\nare in receipt of pensions.\r\n\r\nThe American people, with a patriotic and grateful regard for our\r\nex-soldiers, too broad and too sacred to be monopolized by any special\r\nadvocates, are not only willing but anxious that equal and exact justice\r\nshould be done to all honest claimants for pensions. In their sight the\r\nfriendless and destitute soldier, dependent on public charity, if\r\notherwise entitled, has precisely the same right to share in the\r\nprovision made for those who fought their country's battles as those\r\nbetter able, through friends and influence, to push their claims. Every\r\npension that is granted under our present plan upon any other grounds\r\nthan actual service and injury or disease incurred in such service, and\r\nevery instance of the many in which pensions are increased on other\r\ngrounds than the merits of the claim, work an injustice to the brave and\r\ncrippled, but poor and friendless, soldier, who is entirely neglected or\r\nwho must be content with the smallest sum allowed under general laws.\r\n\r\nThere are far too many neighborhoods in which are found glaring cases of\r\ninequality of treatment in the matter of pensions, and they are largely\r\ndue to a yielding in the Pension Bureau to importunity on the part of\r\nthose, other than the pensioner, who are especially interested, or they\r\narise from special acts passed for the benefit of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe men who fought side by side should stand side by side when they\r\nparticipate in a grateful nation's kind remembrance.\r\n\r\nEvery consideration of fairness and justice to our ex-soldiers and the\r\nprotection of the patriotic instinct of our citizens from perversion and\r\nviolation point to the adoption of a pension system broad and\r\ncomprehensive enough to cover every contingency, and which shall make\r\nunnecessary an objectionable volume of special legislation.\r\n\r\nAs long as we adhere to the principle of granting pensions for service,\r\nand disability as the result of the service, the allowance of pensions\r\nshould be restricted to cases presenting these features.\r\n\r\nEvery patriotic heart responds to a tender consideration for those who,\r\nhaving served their country long and well, are reduced to destitution\r\nand dependence, not as an incident of their service, but with advancing\r\nage or through sickness or misfortune. We are all tempted by the\r\ncontemplation of such a condition to supply relief, and are often\r\nimpatient of the limitations of public duty. Yielding to no one in the\r\ndesire to indulge this feeling of consideration, I can not rid myself of\r\nthe conviction that if these ex-soldiers are to be relieved they and\r\ntheir cause are entitled to the benefit of an enactment under which\r\nrelief may be claimed as a right, and that such relief should be granted\r\nunder the sanction of law, not in evasion of it; nor should such worthy\r\nobjects of care, all equally entitled, be remitted to the unequal\r\noperation of sympathy or the tender mercies of social and political\r\ninfluence, with their unjust discriminations.\r\n\r\nThe discharged soldiers and sailors of the country are our\r\nfellow-citizens, and interested with us in the passage and faithful\r\nexecution of wholesome laws. They can not be swerved from their duty of\r\ncitizenship by artful appeals to their spirit of brotherhood born of\r\ncommon peril and suffering, nor will they exact as a test of devotion to\r\ntheir welfare a willingness to neglect public duty in their behalf.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1885, the current business of the Patent Office\r\nwas, on an average, five and a half months in arrears, and in several\r\ndivisions more than twelve months behind. At the close of the last\r\nfiscal year such current work was but three months in arrears, and it is\r\nasserted and believed that in the next few months the delay in obtaining\r\nan examination of an application for a patent will be but nominal.\r\n\r\nThe number of applications for patents during the last fiscal year,\r\nincluding reissues, designs, trade-marks, and labels, equals 40,678,\r\nwhich is considerably in excess of the number received during any\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Patent Office during the year aggregate\r\n$1,205,167.80, enabling the office to turn into the Treasury a surplus\r\nrevenue, over and above all expenditures, of about $163,710.30.\r\n\r\nThe number of patents granted during the last fiscal year, including\r\nreissues, trade-marks, designs, and labels, was 25,619, a number also\r\nquite largely in excess of that of any preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner shows the office to be in a prosperous\r\ncondition and constantly increasing in its business. No increase of\r\nforce is asked for.\r\n\r\nThe amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1886, was\r\n$890,760. The amount estimated for the year ending June 30, 1887, was\r\n$853,960. The amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888,\r\nis $778,770.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior suggests a change in the plan for the\r\npayment of the indebtedness of the Pacific subsidized roads to the\r\nGovernment. His suggestion has the unanimous indorsement of the persons\r\nselected by the Government to act as directors of these roads and\r\nprotect the interests of the United States in the board of direction.\r\nIn considering the plan proposed the sole matters which should be taken\r\ninto account, in my opinion, are the situation of the Government as a\r\ncreditor and the surest way to secure the payment of the principal and\r\ninterest of its debt.\r\n\r\nBy a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States it has\r\nbeen adjudged that the laws of the several States are inoperative to\r\nregulate rates of transportation upon railroads if such regulation\r\ninterferes with the rate of carriage from one State into another. This\r\nimportant field of control and regulation having been thus left entirely\r\nunoccupied, the expediency of Federal action upon the subject is worthy\r\nof consideration.\r\n\r\nThe relations of labor to capital and of laboring men to their employers\r\nare of the utmost concern to every patriotic citizen. When these are\r\nstrained and distorted, unjustifiable claims are apt to be insisted upon\r\nby both interests, and in the controversy which results the welfare of\r\nall and the prosperity of the country are jeopardized. Any intervention\r\nof the General Government, within the limits of its constitutional\r\nauthority, to avert such a condition should be willingly accorded.\r\n\r\nIn a special message[11] transmitted to the Congress at its last session\r\nI suggested the enlargement of our present Labor Bureau and adding to\r\nits present functions the power of arbitration in cases where\r\ndifferences arise between employer and employed. When these differences\r\nreach such a stage as to result in the interruption of commerce between\r\nthe States, the application of this remedy by the General Government\r\nmight be regarded as entirely within its constitutional powers. And I\r\nthink we might reasonably hope that such arbitrators, if carefully\r\nselected and if entitled to the confidence of the parties to be\r\naffected, would be voluntarily called to the settlement of controversies\r\nof less extent and not necessarily within the domain of Federal\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that this suggestion is worthy the attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBut after all has been done by the passage of laws, either Federal or\r\nState, to relieve a situation full of solicitude, much more remains to\r\nbe accomplished by the reinstatement and cultivation of a true American\r\nsentiment which recognizes the equality of American citizenship. This,\r\nin the light of our traditions and in loyalty to the spirit of our\r\ninstitutions, would teach that a hearty cooperation on the part of all\r\ninterests is the surest path to national greatness and the happiness of\r\nall our people; that capital should, in recognition of the brotherhood\r\nof our citizenship and in a spirit of American fairness, generously\r\naccord to labor its just compensation and consideration, and that\r\ncontented labor is capital's best protection and faithful ally. It would\r\nteach, too, that the diverse situations of our people are inseparable\r\nfrom our civilization; that every citizen should in his sphere be a\r\ncontributor to the general good; that capital does not necessarily tend\r\nto the oppression of labor, and that violent disturbances and disorders\r\nalienate from their promoters true American sympathy and kindly feeling.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture, representing the oldest and largest of\r\nour national industries, is subserving well the purposes of its\r\norganization. By the introduction of new subjects of farming enterprise\r\nand by opening new sources of agricultural wealth and the dissemination\r\nof early information concerning production and prices it has contributed\r\nlargely to the country's prosperity. Through this agency advanced\r\nthought and investigation touching the subjects it has in charge should,\r\namong other things, be practically applied to the home production at a\r\nlow cost of articles of food which are now imported from abroad. Such an\r\ninnovation will necessarily, of course, in the beginning be within the\r\ndomain of intelligent experiment, and the subject in every stage should\r\nreceive all possible encouragement from the Government.\r\n\r\nThe interests of millions of our citizens engaged in agriculture are\r\ninvolved in an enlargement and improvement of the results of their\r\nlabor, and a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing\r\ntribute to those whose productive returns are a main source of our\r\nprogress and power.\r\n\r\nThe existence of pleuro-pneumonia among the cattle of various States has\r\nled to burdensome and in some cases disastrous restrictions in an\r\nimportant branch of our commerce, threatening to affect the quantity and\r\nquality of our food supply. This is a matter of such importance and of\r\nsuch far-reaching consequences that I hope it will engage the serious\r\nattention of the Congress, to the end that such a remedy may be applied\r\nas the limits of a constitutional delegation of power to the General\r\nGovernment will permit.\r\n\r\nI commend to the consideration of the Congress the report of the\r\nCommissioner and his suggestions concerning the interest intrusted to\r\nhis care.\r\n\r\nThe continued operation of the law relating to our civil service has\r\nadded the most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is\r\na fact worthy of note that every public officer who has a just idea of\r\nhis duty to the people testifies to the value of this reform. Its\r\nstaunchest friends are found among those who understand it best, and its\r\nwarmest supporters are those who are restrained and protected by its\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of such restraint and protection is not appreciated by those\r\nwho want places under the Government regardless of merit and efficiency,\r\nnor by those who insist that the selection of such places should rest\r\nupon a proper credential showing active partisan work. They mean to\r\npublic officers, if not their lives, the only opportunity afforded them\r\nto attend to public business, and they mean to the good people of the\r\ncountry the better performance of the work of their Government.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly strange that the scope and nature of this reform are\r\nso little understood and that so many things not included within its\r\nplan are called by its name. When cavil yields more fully to\r\nexamination, the system will have large additions to the number of its\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOur civil-service reform may be imperfect in some of its details; it may\r\nbe misunderstood and opposed; it may not always be faithfully applied;\r\nits designs may sometimes miscarry through mistake or willful intent; it\r\nmay sometimes tremble under the assaults of its enemies or languish\r\nunder the misguided zeal of impracticable friends; but if the people of\r\nthis country ever submit to the banishment of its underlying principle\r\nfrom the operation of their Government they will abandon the surest\r\nguaranty of the safety and success of American institutions.\r\n\r\nI invoke for this reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of the\r\nCongress. I renew my recommendation made last year that the salaries of\r\nthe Commissioners be made equal to other officers of the Government\r\nhaving like duties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reasonable\r\nappropriations may be made as will enable them to increase the\r\nusefulness of the cause they have in charge.\r\n\r\nI desire to call the attention of the Congress to a plain duty which the\r\nGovernment owes to the depositors in the Freedman's Savings and Trust\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThis company was chartered by the Congress for the benefit of the most\r\nilliterate and humble of our people, and with the intention of\r\nencouraging in them industry and thrift. Most of its branches were\r\npresided over by officers holding the commissions and clothed in the\r\nuniform of the United States. These and other circumstances reasonably,\r\nI think, led these simple people to suppose that the invitation to\r\ndeposit their hard-earned savings in this institution implied an\r\nundertaking on the part of their Government that their money should be\r\nsafely kept for them.\r\n\r\nWhen this company failed, it was liable in the sum of $2,939,925.22 to\r\n61,131 depositors. Dividends amounting in the aggregate to 62 per cent\r\nhave been declared, and the sum called for and paid of such dividends\r\nseems to be $1,648,181.72. This sum deducted from the entire amount of\r\ndeposits leaves $1,291,744.50 still unpaid. Past experience has shown\r\nthat quite a large part of this sum will not be called for. There are\r\nassets still on hand amounting to the estimated sum of $16,000.\r\n\r\nI think the remaining 38 per cent of such of these deposits as have\r\nclaimants should be paid by the Government, upon principles of equity\r\nand fairness.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioner, soon to be laid before Congress, will\r\ngive more satisfactory details on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe control of the affairs of the District of Columbia having been\r\nplaced in the hands of purely executive officers, while the Congress\r\nstill retains all legislative authority relating to its government, it\r\nbecomes my duty to make known the most pressing needs of the District\r\nand recommend their consideration.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the District appear to be in an uncertain and unsatisfactory\r\ncondition, and their codification or revision is much needed.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year one of the bridges leading from the District to the\r\nState of Virginia became unfit for use, and travel upon it was\r\nforbidden. This leads me to suggest that the improvement of all the\r\nbridges crossing the Potomac and its branches from the city of\r\nWashington is worthy the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the District represent that the laws regulating the\r\nsale of liquor and granting licenses therefor should be at once amended,\r\nand that legislation is needed to consolidate, define, and enlarge the\r\nscope and powers of charitable and penal institutions within the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the Commissioners be clothed with the power to make,\r\nwithin fixed limitations, police regulations. I believe this power\r\ngranted and carefully guarded would tend to subserve the good order of\r\nthe municipality.\r\n\r\nIt seems that trouble still exists growing out of the occupation of the\r\nstreets and avenues by certain railroads having their termini in the\r\ncity. It is very important that such laws should be enacted upon this\r\nsubject as will secure to the railroads all the facilities they require\r\nfor the transaction of their business and at the same time protect\r\ncitizens from injury to their persons or property.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners again complain that the accommodations afforded them\r\nfor the necessary offices for District business and for the safe-keeping\r\nof valuable books and papers are entirely insufficient. I recommend that\r\nthis condition of affairs be remedied by the Congress, and that suitable\r\nquarters be furnished for the needs of the District government.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I earnestly invoke such wise action on the part of the\r\npeople's legislators as will subserve the public good and demonstrate\r\nduring the remaining days of the Congress as at present organized its\r\nability and inclination to so meet the people's needs that it shall be\r\ngratefully remembered by an expectant constituency.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See p. 406.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See pp. 489-490.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See pp. 223-224.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See pp. 490-491.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See pp. 308-309.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See pp. 394-397.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 8, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, which is\r\naccompanied by the correspondence in relation to the rights of American\r\nfishermen in the British North American waters, and commend to your\r\nfavorable consideration the suggestion that a commission be authorized\r\nby law to take perpetuating proofs of the losses sustained during the\r\npast year by American fishermen owing to their unfriendly and\r\nunwarranted treatment by the local authorities of the maritime provinces\r\nof the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nI may have occasion hereafter to make further recommendations during the\r\npresent session for such remedial legislation as may become necessary\r\nfor the protection of the rights of our citizens engaged in the open-sea\r\nfisheries in the North Atlantic waters.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 13, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 8th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, submitting, with accompanying papers, an\r\nestimate of appropriation in the sum of $22,000, prepared in the Office\r\nof Indian Affairs, to provide for the payment to the Eel River band of\r\nMiami Indians of a principal sum in lieu of all annuities now received\r\nby them under existing treaty stipulations.\r\n\r\nThe matter is presented for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 13, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, with a view to their ratification, an additional\r\narticle, signed June 23, 1884, to the treaty of friendship, commerce,\r\nand navigation of July 27, 1853, between the United States and the\r\nArgentine Confederation; also an additional clause to the said\r\nadditional article, signed June 25, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of State of even date and the papers\r\ninclosed therewith set forth the reasons which have, in my opinion,\r\nrendered it advisable to again transmit for ratification the additional\r\narticle above mentioned, which was withdrawn from the Senate at my\r\nrequest on April 2, 1885.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 15, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your information, a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, inclosing the correspondence which has passed between the\r\nDepartment of State and the Governments of Switzerland and France on the\r\nsubject of international copyright since the date of my message of July\r\n9, 1886, on this question.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 20, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in relation\r\nto the invitation from Her Britannic Majesty to this Government to\r\nparticipate in an international exhibition which is to be held at\r\nAdelaide, South Australia, in 1887.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 21, 1886_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate James C.

In the last days of the session the\r\nSenate declined to confirm the nomination.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the appointment of Mr. Matthews to the office for which he\r\nwas named was developed among the citizens of the District of Columbia,\r\nostensibly upon the ground that the nominee was not a resident of the\r\nDistrict; and it is supposed that such opposition, to some extent at\r\nleast, influenced the determination of the question of his confirmation.\r\n\r\nMr. Matthews has now been in occupancy of the office to which he was\r\nnominated for more than four months, and he has in the performance of\r\nthe duties thereof won the approval of all those having business to\r\ntransact with such office, and has rendered important service in\r\nrescuing the records of the District from loss and illegibility.\r\n\r\nI am informed that his management of this office has removed much of the\r\nopposition to his appointment which heretofore existed.\r\n\r\nI have ventured, therefore, in view of the demonstrated fitness of this\r\nnominee, and with the understanding that the objections heretofore urged\r\nagainst his selection have to a great extent subsided, and confessing a\r\ndesire to cooperate in tendering to our colored fellow-citizens just\r\nrecognition and the utmost good faith, to again submit this nomination\r\nto the Senate for confirmation, at the same time disclaiming any\r\nintention to question its previous action in the premises.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 5, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nReferring to my message of the 12th of January last,[12] transmitting\r\nthe final report of the commissioners appointed under the act of July 7,\r\n1884, to visit the States of Central and South America, I have now to\r\nsubmit a special report by Commissioner Thomas C.

Belding.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the sum of $1,566 to be paid to the said H.K. Belding\r\n\"for carrying the mails of the United States between the years 1858 and\r\n1862.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1858, a contract was awarded to the said Belding for carrying\r\nthe mails from Brownsville, Minn., to Carimona, in the same State, a\r\ndistance of 63 miles, and return, three times a week, for the sum of\r\n$1,800 per annum, said service to begin on the 1st day of July, 1858,\r\nand to terminate on the 30th day of June, 1862. This contract contained\r\na provision that the Post-Office Department might discontinue the\r\nservice in whole or in part, allowing to the contractor one month's\r\nextra pay therefor.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1859, in consequence of a failure on the part of the Congress\r\nto make the necessary appropriation, a general reduction of mail service\r\nwas ordered, and the service under the contract with the claimant was\r\nreduced to two trips per week from May 10, 1859, instead of three, as\r\nstipulated in the contract, and a deduction of one-third of the annual\r\nsum to be paid by the contract was made for such reduced service; and\r\nthereupon one month's extra pay was allowed and paid the contractor on\r\naccount of said reduction.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that payment was made in full according to the terms of\r\nthe contract up to the 10th day of May, 1859, but it is claimed that\r\nnotwithstanding the reduction of the service to two trips per week and\r\nthe receipt by the contractor of one month's extra pay by reason\r\nthereof, he continued to perform the full service of three trips per\r\nweek from the 10th day of May, 1859, to the 30th day of September, 1860,\r\nbeing seventeen months.\r\n\r\nOf the sum directed to be paid to him in the bill under consideration,\r\n$850 is allowed him on account of this service, he having been paid\r\nfor the period stated at the rate of $1,200 per annum. The contractor\r\nclaims that this full service was performed after the reduction by the\r\nPost-Office Department because he had received an intimation from the\r\nPostmaster-General that if the full service was continued after such\r\nreduction there was no doubt that the Congress would at its next session\r\nmake provision for the payment of the sum deducted.\r\n\r\nOf course no legal claim in favor of the contractor can be predicated\r\nupon the facts which he alleges; and if he did continue full service\r\nunder the circumstances stated, it must be conceded that his conduct was\r\nhardly in accordance with the rules which regulate transactions of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut a thorough search of the correspondence and records in the\r\nPost-Office Department fails to disclose any letter, document, or record\r\ngiving the least support to the allegation that any such intimation or\r\nassurance as is claimed was given; nor is there the least evidence in\r\nthe Department that the full service was actually performed. There is,\r\nhowever, on the files of the Department a letter from the claimant,\r\ndated August 25, 1860, containing the following statement:\r\n\r\n  When I received official information of the curtailing service, the\r\n  reasons why, I wrote to the Department that I would, if allowed,\r\n  continue service three times a week and take certificates, if I could\r\n  be allowed to connect with La Crosse at _pro rata_ rates. That letter\r\n  was never answered and I continued service three times a week till\r\n  3d of September following, then run twice a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it appears that this contractor, who in August, 1860, claimed that\r\nhe continued full service upon the invitation of his own unanswered\r\nletter for less than four months, insists twenty-seven years after the\r\ndate of the alleged service that he performed such service for seventeen\r\nmonths, and up to October, 1860. Not only has he himself in this manner\r\nalmost conclusively shown that the claim now made and allowed is\r\nexorbitant, but the evidence gives rise to a strong presumption that it\r\nis entirely fictitious.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the amount allowed to the claimant in this bill is\r\nbased upon an alleged performance by the contractor of the same mail\r\nservice which has been referred to from October 1, 1860, to February 14,\r\n1861, a period of four months and fourteen days.\r\n\r\nPrior to October 1, 1860, the claimant's contract was annulled and a new\r\nor more extended route established, entirely covering that upon which he\r\nhad carried the mails. Thereupon a month's extra pay was allowed to him,\r\nand new contractors undertook the service and were paid therefor by the\r\nGovernment for the period covered by the claimant's alleged service.\r\nFrom the 14th day of February, 1861, Mr. Belding's contract with the\r\nGovernment was reinstated; but if he performed the service alleged\r\nduring the period of four months and fourteen days immediately prior to\r\nthat date, it is quite clear that he did so under an arrangement with\r\nthe new contractors, and not under circumstances creating any legal or\r\nequitable claim against the Government.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 31, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 2167, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mrs. Margaret Dunlap.\"\r\n\r\nBy this bill it is proposed to grant a pension to the beneficiary\r\ntherein named as the mother of James F. Dunlap, who enlisted in the\r\nSeventh Missouri State Militia Cavalry in 1862 and died in July, 1864,\r\nof wounds received at the hand of a comrade.\r\n\r\nThe favorable action of the Senate upon this bill appears to be based,\r\nso far as the cause of death is concerned, upon an affidavit contained\r\nin the report of the committee to which the bill was referred, made\r\nby one G. Will Houts, second lieutenant in the company to which the\r\ndeceased soldier belonged, in which the affiant deposes that some of\r\nthe comrades of the deceased being engaged in an affray he attempted\r\nto separate the combatants, whereupon one of them, without cause or\r\nprovocation, stabbed the deceased in the breast, from which, in a few\r\ndays thereafter, he died; to which affidavit is added the finding of a\r\ncourt-martial that the party inflicting the wound was found guilty of\r\nmanslaughter and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nUpon this showing it might be difficult to spell out the facts that the\r\ninjury to the soldier was received in the line of duty or that any\r\ntheory of granting pensions covered the case.\r\n\r\nBut the weak features of this application are not alluded to in the\r\ncommittee's report.\r\n\r\nThe record of the soldier's death states that he was \"killed by one of\r\nhis comrades in a difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Lieutenant Houts who in 1872 made oath that the soldier\r\nwas wounded while attempting to separate comrades who were fighting\r\ntestified in 1864 before the court-martial upon the trial of the man\r\nwho did the wounding, and whose name was Capehart, that Dunlap, the\r\ndeceased, stated to him \"that he was more to blame than Capehart, and\r\nthat they had been scuffling, at first good-naturedly, and then both got\r\nangry; that he was rougher with Capehart than he ought to have been.\"\r\n\r\nAnother witness testified that the affray took place between Dunlap and\r\nCapehart; that Dunlap handled Capehart very roughly, kicking him, etc.,\r\nand that finally Capehart stabbed Dunlap, upon which the latter\r\nattempted to get his gun, but was prevented from doing so by the\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nOf course there can be no pretense of any kind of claim against the\r\nGovernment arising from these facts.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the affidavit presented to the Senate committee\r\nwas contrived to deceive, and it is to be feared that it is but a sample\r\nof many that are made in support of claims for pensions.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 3, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 6443, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Alexander Falconer.\"\r\n\r\nThis claimant filed his application for pension in 1879, alleging that\r\nin 1837, being then an enlisted man in the United States Army, he\r\nreceived a gunshot wound in his right leg below the knee at the battle\r\nof Okeechobee Lake, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe records disclose the fact that this soldier enlisted in 1834, and\r\nwas almost continuously in the service and attached to the same company\r\nuntil 1846.\r\n\r\nIt further appears that he is reported sick during the month in which\r\nthe battle was fought. The list of casualties does not contain his name\r\namong the wounded.\r\n\r\nHe reenlisted in 1846 and again in 1847, and was finally discharged in\r\n1848. These latter enlistments were for service in the Mexican War.\r\n\r\nHis claim for pension was denied in 1885 on the ground that no\r\ndisability existed in a pensionable degree from the alleged gunshot\r\nwound in his leg.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear that the only pretexts for giving this claimant a\r\npension are military service, old age, and poverty.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as he was a soldier in the Mexican War, his case is undoubtedly\r\nprovided for by a general law approved within the last few days.\r\n\r\nUnder this bill the amount to be paid him is fixed, while if the bill\r\nherewith returned were approved the sum to be paid him would depend\r\nupon the determination of the Pension Bureau as to the extent of his\r\ndisability as the result of his wound. As that Bureau has quite lately\r\ndetermined that there was no disability, it is evident that this old\r\nsoldier can better rely upon the general law referred to.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 3, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 6132, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to William Lynch.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant mentioned in this bill enlisted in the Fifth Regiment\r\nUnited States Infantry in 1849, and was discharged, after a\r\nreenlistment, September 8, 1859.\r\n\r\nHe filed a claim for pension more than twenty-four years afterwards, in\r\nApril, 1884, claiming that he contracted rheumatism of the right hip and\r\nleg in the winter of 1857-58, while serving in Utah. He admitted that he\r\nwas not under treatment while in the service and that he never consulted\r\na physician in regard to his disability until he commenced proceedings\r\nfor a pension.\r\n\r\nThe evidence disclosed to me falls far short of establishing this claim\r\nfor pension upon its merits.\r\n\r\nThe application made to the Pension Bureau is still pending and awaiting\r\nanswer to inquiries made by the Bureau in January, 1886.\r\n\r\nI do not understand that the Congress intends to pass special acts in\r\ncases thus situated.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 7698, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Robert K. Bennett.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted in September, 1862, and it\r\nappears that very soon after that he was detailed to the cook shop. This\r\nseems to be the only military service he rendered, and on February 7,\r\n1863, five months after enlistment, he was received into the marine\r\nhospital at New Orleans for varicocele. He was discharged from the\r\nservice February 22, 1863, and the cause of discharge is stated to be\r\n\"varicocele, to which he was subject four years before enlistment.\"\r\n\r\nSeventeen years thereafter, and in June, 1880, this claimant filed an\r\napplication for pension in the Pension Bureau, alleging that about the\r\n10th day of February, 1863, in unloading a barrel it fell upon him,\r\nproducing a hernia, shortly after which he was affected by piles.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that he fixes this injury as occurring three days after\r\nhis admission to the hospital, but he might well be honestly mistaken as\r\nto this date. If the injury, however, was such as he stated, it is\r\ndifficult to see why no mention was made of it in the hospital records.\r\n\r\nHe persisted at all times, as I understand the case, until the rejection\r\nof his claim in 1883, that his disability arose from hernia and piles.\r\nThe reason of this rejection is stated to be that varicocele existed\r\nprior to enlistment and that there was no evidence of the existence of\r\npiles in the service or at discharge. From a medical examination made in\r\nDecember, 1882, it appears that there was \"no evidence or symptoms of\r\ndisability resulting from piles or hernia.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the rejection of this claim some proof was filed tending\r\nto show that the disability was in the right leg, but it is of such a\r\nnature, in the light of the claimant's own previous allegations, that I\r\nthink the Pension Bureau did entirely right in informing his attorney\r\nthat the additional evidence did not change the status of the case.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 7540, entitled \"An act\r\nto increase the pension of Franklin Sweet.\"\r\n\r\nThis soldier was pensioned in 1863 as sergeant, though before that time\r\nhe had been acting as captain, and was in command of his company when he\r\nwas wounded. He is entitled in equity, and, I think, upon the theory of\r\nan act very recently approved, in law, to be treated in regard to his\r\npension as a captain; and the Pension Bureau has within the last few\r\ndays ordered a certificate for pension to issue to him as captain as of\r\nthe date of his discharge.\r\n\r\nI fully approve this action of the Bureau, and as this is much more\r\nfavorable to a deserving soldier than his remedy under this bill, I am\r\nnot willing that the action, so lately and so justly taken in his behalf\r\nunder the general law should be superseded by the approval of this act.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 8834, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Abraham P. Griggs.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant mentioned in this bill enlisted in a New Jersey regiment\r\nAugust 14, 1861, and was discharged for disability November 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nHe entered hospital January 2, 1863, and was transferred to general\r\nhospital at Newark, N.J., March 28, 1863, with \"debility.\" He was\r\ndischarged from that hospital and from the service in November, 1863,\r\nas above stated, and the following statement from his certificate of\r\ndischarge, if trustworthy, sheds some light upon the kind of debility\r\nwith which he was afflicted:\r\n\r\n  This man has been in this hospital for the past eight months. We do not\r\n  believe him sick, or that he has been sick, but completely worthless.\r\n  He is obese and a malingerer to such an extent that he is almost an\r\n  imbecile--worthlessness, obesity, and imbecility and laziness. He is\r\n  totally unfit for the Invalid Corps or for any other military duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not regard it at all strange that this claimant, encouraged by the\r\nease with which special acts are passed, seeks relief through such\r\nmeans, after his application, filed in the Pension Bureau nearly twenty\r\nyears after his discharge, had been rejected.\r\n\r\nOf the four comrades who make affidavit in support of his claim, two of\r\nthem are recorded as deserters.\r\n\r\nHis claim is predicated upon rheumatism. He alleges that after his\r\ndischarge from his enlistment he was drafted and served in the Third New\r\nYork Cavalry, but the Adjutant-General reports that his name does not\r\nappear on the rolls of the company to which he says he was attached.\r\n\r\nThe board of United States examining surgeons at Trenton, N.J., report\r\nas the result of an examination as late as May 27, 1885, that they found\r\n\"no disease of heart or lungs, no thickening or wasting of any of the\r\njoints of the body, no evidence of any rheumatic diathesis, no rupture\r\nor hemorrhoids, no disease of his spleen or kidney; hands are hard and\r\nindicate an ability to work.\"\r\n\r\nI can not think that the official statements referred to, and which\r\nmilitate so strongly against the merits of the claimant, should be\r\nimpeached or set aside by any of the other testimony which has been\r\nbrought to my attention.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 927, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Cudbert Stone.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee of the House of Representatives to whom this\r\nbill was referred states that the claimant enlisted October 3, 1861, in\r\nCompany H, Fourteenth Kentucky Volunteers, and was honorably discharged\r\non the 31st day of January, 1865; that he filed his claim for pension\r\nJuly 20, 1881, more than sixteen years thereafter, alleging that he\r\ncontracted piles while in the service, from exposure while in the line\r\nof duty, and that his claim was rejected in October, 1884, on the ground\r\nthat the allegation of the claimant shows that his disability originated\r\nwhile undergoing the sentence of a court-martial, and therefore not in\r\nthe line of duty.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee closes with the statement that--\r\n\r\n  In view of the long and faithful service and high character of the\r\n  claimant and the well-established facts that claimant was a stout and\r\n  able-bodied man, free from any and all disease when he enlisted, and\r\n  that by reason of his faithful service to his country and the great\r\n  suffering and hardship through which he passed while in said service\r\n  his health was permanently destroyed, the committee earnestly recommend\r\n  the passage of the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department show that the claimant enlisted\r\nOctober 25, 1861, and that on the muster-in roll of his company dated\r\nDecember 10, 1861, he is reported as present; that on the roll dated\r\nDecember 31, 1861, he is reported as absent without leave; that on the\r\nroll for January and February, 1862, he is reported as deserted; that he\r\nis not borne on subsequent rolls until that for November, 1864, when he\r\nis reported as gained from desertion; he was mustered out with his\r\ncompany January 31, 1865, and the records offered no evidence of\r\ndisability; that in his claim for pension, filed in 1881, he alleges\r\nthat he contracted piles in the winter of 1863.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent statement he alleges that this date is erroneous,\r\nand that his disability was contracted in October, 1864, and that he\r\nbelieves it was the result of his having diarrhea for about twelve\r\nmonths prior to that date, contracted while he was being carried from\r\nplace to place as a prisoner, he having been tried by a court-martial\r\nin May, 1862, for desertion and sentenced to imprisonment until the\r\nexpiration of his term of enlistment.\r\n\r\nThus it quite plainly appears that this claimant spent the most of his\r\nterm of enlistment in desertion or in imprisonment as a punishment of\r\nthat offense; and thus is exhibited the \"long and faithful service and\r\nthe high character of the claimant\" mentioned as entitling him to\r\nconsideration by the committee who reported favorably upon this bill.\r\n\r\nI withhold my assent from this bill because, if the facts before me,\r\nderived from the army records and the statements of the claimant are\r\ntrue, the allowance of this claim would, in my opinion, be a travesty\r\nupon our whole scheme of pensions and an insult to every decent veteran\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 8150, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Jesse Campbell.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim for a pension made by the beneficiary named in this bill to\r\nthe Pension Bureau, and rejected in 1881, was reopened upon further\r\nproof in January, 1887, and the claimant was ordered before a board of\r\nexamining surgeons, upon which a report has not yet been made.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the only ground for the rejection of his claim was the\r\nnonexistence of pensionable disability from the cause he alleged, and in\r\nview of the fact that he now alleges a different disability, which the\r\nnew evidence seems to support, there is no doubt that justice will be\r\ndone the claimant under the general law.\r\n\r\nThis bill if passed would only place the name of the beneficiary upon\r\nthe pension roll, \"subject to the restrictions and limitations of the\r\npension laws.\" Whether any sum was allowed him or not would still depend\r\nupon the existence of a disability; and if this is found upon the\r\nexamination lately ordered, he will undoubtedly be put upon the pension\r\nroll, under existing law, in accordance with his supplementary claim.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without approval House bill No. 6832, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mrs. Catharine Sattler.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill claims a pension as the surviving\r\nwidow of Julius Sattler, who enlisted in Company A, Seventh New York\r\nVolunteers, and was in the service from March 10, 1864, to March 22,\r\n1865, when he was discharged because of the amputation of his left\r\nforearm in consequence of a wound received in the battle of Deep Bottom,\r\nVirginia, on the 14th day of August, 1864. He was pensioned in 1865 at\r\nthe rate of $8 per month, which was afterwards increased to $15 per\r\nmonth, dating from June 6, 1866.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1867, he was employed as a watchman in the United States\r\nbonded warehouse in the city of New York, and on the 31st day of that\r\nmonth he received his monthly pay of $50. He disappeared on that day,\r\nand on the 13th day of November, 1867, his body was found in the North\r\nRiver, at the foot of West Thirteenth street, in the city of New York\r\nwithout his hat, coat, watch, or money.\r\n\r\nThese facts, with the further statement that he was a strong and healthy\r\nman at the time of his death, constitute the case on the part of the\r\nwidow, who filed her application for a pension July 8, 1884, nearly\r\nseventeen years after her husband's death, alleging that she was married\r\nto the deceased in 1865, after the amputation of his arm.\r\n\r\nHer claim was rejected in November, 1884, upon the ground that the\r\nsoldier's death was not due to his military service.\r\n\r\nThis rejection was clearly right, unless the Government is to be held as\r\nan insurer against every fatal casualty incurred by those who have\r\nserved in the Army, without regard to the manner of its occurrence.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 6825, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James R.

A later examination\r\nin the same year was had with the same result. Still another medical\r\nexamination was had in June, 1884, which, although nearly agreeing with\r\nthe previous ones, and giving rise to some suspicion that the claimant\r\nwas inclined to exaggerate and prevent a free and fair examination,\r\nstill does not absolutely exclude a very slight disability.\r\n\r\nUpon the report of this last examination the case has been reopened for\r\nfurther proof of disability since discharge, which if found will entitle\r\nthe claimant to a pension under general laws. On the question to be\r\ndetermined he would have no advantage under a special act, inasmuch as\r\nthere must be a ratable disability to entitle him to any payment in\r\npursuance of its provisions.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 11, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval House bill No. 10457, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of dependent parents and honorably discharged\r\nsoldiers and sailors who are now disabled and dependent upon their own\r\nlabor for support.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first general bill that has been sanctioned by the Congress\r\nsince the close of the late civil war permitting a pension to the\r\nsoldiers and sailors who served in that war upon the ground of service\r\nand present disability alone, and in the entire absence of any injuries\r\nreceived by the casualties or incidents of such service.\r\n\r\nWhile by almost constant legislation since the close of this war there\r\nhas been compensation awarded for every possible injury received as a\r\nresult of military service in the Union Army, and while a great number\r\nof laws passed for that purpose have been administered with great\r\nliberality and have been supplemented by numerous private acts to reach\r\nspecial cases, there has not until now been an avowed departure from the\r\nprinciple thus far adhered to respecting Union soldiers, that the bounty\r\nof the Government in the way of pensions is generously bestowed when\r\ngranted to those who, in this military service and in the line of\r\nmilitary duty, have to a greater or less extent been disabled.\r\n\r\nBut it is a mistake to suppose that service pensions, such as are\r\npermitted by the second section of the bill under consideration, are new\r\nto our legislation. In 1818, thirty-five years after the close of the\r\nRevolutionary War, they were granted to the soldiers engaged in that\r\nstruggle, conditional upon service until the end of the war or for a\r\nterm not less than nine months, and requiring every beneficiary under\r\nthe act to be one \"who is, or hereafter by reason of his reduced\r\ncircumstances in life shall be, in need of assistance from his country\r\nfor support.\" Another law of a like character was passed in 1828,\r\nrequiring service until the close of the Revolutionary War; and still\r\nanother, passed in 1832, provided for those persons not included in the\r\nprevious statute, but who served two years at some time during the war,\r\nand giving a proportionate sum to those who had served not less than six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nA service-pension law was passed for the benefit of the soldiers of 1812\r\nin the year 1871, fifty-six years after the close of that war, which\r\nrequired only sixty days' service; and another was passed in 1878,\r\nsixty-three years after the war, requiring only fourteen days' service.\r\n\r\nThe service-pension bill passed at this session of Congress, thirty-nine\r\nyears after the close of the Mexican War, for the benefit of the\r\nsoldiers of that war, requires either some degree of disability or\r\ndependency or that the claimant under its provisions should be 62 years\r\nof age, and in either case that he should have served sixty days or been\r\nactually engaged in a battle.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the bill of 1818 and the Mexican pension bill,\r\nbeing thus passed nearer the close of the wars in which its\r\nbeneficiaries were engaged than the others--one thirty-five years and\r\nthe other thirty-nine years after the termination of such wars--embraced\r\npersons who were quite advanced in age, assumed to be comparatively few\r\nin number, and whose circumstances, dependence, and disabilities were\r\nclearly defined and could be quite easily fixed.\r\n\r\nThe other laws referred to appear to have been passed at a time so\r\nremote from the military service of the persons which they embraced that\r\ntheir extreme age alone was deemed to supply a presumption of dependency\r\nand need.\r\n\r\nThe number of enlistments in the Revolutionary War is stated to be\r\n309,791, and in the War of 1812 576,622; but it is estimated that on\r\naccount of repeated reenlistments the number of individuals engaged in\r\nthese wars did not exceed one-half of the number represented by these\r\nfigures. In the war with Mexico the number of enlistments is reported to\r\nbe 112,230, which represents a greater proportion of individuals engaged\r\nthan the reported enlistments in the two previous wars.\r\n\r\nThe number of pensions granted under all laws to soldiers of the\r\nRevolution is given at 62,069; to soldiers of the War of 1812 and their\r\nwidows, 60,178; and to soldiers of the Mexican War and their widows,\r\nup to June 30, 1885, 7,619. The latter pensions were granted to the\r\nsoldiers of a war involving much hardship for disabilities incurred as a\r\nresult of such service; and it was not till within the last month that\r\nthe few remaining survivors were awarded a service pension.\r\n\r\nThe War of the Rebellion terminated nearly twenty-two years ago; the\r\nnumber of men furnished for its prosecution is stated to be 2,772,408.\r\nNo corresponding number of statutes have ever been passed to cover every\r\nkind of injury or disability incurred in the military service of any\r\nwar. Under these statutes 561,576 pensions have been granted from the\r\nyear 1861 to June 30, 1886, and more than 2,600 pensioners have been\r\nadded to the rolls by private acts passed to meet cases, many of them of\r\nquestionable merit, which the general laws did not cover.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of July, 1886, 365,763 pensioners of all classes were\r\nupon the pension rolls, of whom 305,605 were survivors of the War of the\r\nRebellion and their widows and dependents. For the year ending June 30,\r\n1887, $75,000,000 have been appropriated for the payment of pensions,\r\nand the amount expended for that purpose from 1861 to July 1, 1886, is\r\n$808,624,811.51.\r\n\r\nWhile annually paying out such a vast sum for pensions already granted,\r\nit is now proposed by the bill under consideration to award a service\r\npension to the soldiers of all wars in which the United States has been\r\nengaged, including of course the War of the Rebellion, and to pay those\r\nentitled to the benefits of the act the sum of $12 per month.\r\n\r\nSo far as it relates to the soldiers of the late civil war, the bounty\r\nit affords them is given thirteen years earlier than it has been\r\nfurnished the soldiers of any other war, and before a large majority of\r\nits beneficiaries have advanced in age beyond the strength and vigor of\r\nthe prime of life.\r\n\r\nIt exacts only a military or naval service of three months, without any\r\nrequirement of actual engagement with an enemy in battle, and without a\r\nsubjection to any of the actual dangers of war.\r\n\r\nThe pension it awards is allowed to enlisted men who have not suffered\r\nthe least injury, disability, loss, or damage of any kind, incurred in\r\nor in any degree referable to their military service, including those\r\nwho never reached the front at all and those discharged from rendezvous\r\nat the close of the war, if discharged three months after enlistment.\r\nUnder the last call of the President for troops, in December, 1864,\r\n11,303 men were furnished who were thus discharged.\r\n\r\nThe section allowing this pension does, however, require, besides a\r\nservice of three months and an honorable discharge, that those seeking\r\nthe benefit of the act shall be such as \"are now or may hereafter be\r\nsuffering from mental or physical disability, not the result of their\r\nown vicious habits or gross carelessness, which incapacitates them for\r\nthe performance of labor in such a degree as to render them unable to\r\nearn a support, and who are dependent upon their daily labor for\r\nsupport.\"\r\n\r\nIt provides further that such persons shall, upon making proof of the\r\nfact, \"be placed on the list of invalid pensioners of the United States,\r\nand be entitled to receive for such total inability to procure their\r\nsubsistence by daily labor $12 per month; and such pension shall\r\ncommence from the date of the filing of the application in the Pension\r\nOffice, upon proof that the disability then existed, and continue during\r\nthe existence of the same in the degree herein provided: _Provided_,\r\nThat persons who are now receiving pensions under existing laws, or\r\nwhose claims are pending in the Pension Office, may, by application to\r\nthe Commissioner of Pensions, in such form as he may prescribe, receive\r\nthe benefit of this act.\"\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly of the utmost importance that statutes which, like\r\npension laws, should be liberally administered as measures of\r\nbenevolence in behalf of worthy beneficiaries should admit of no\r\nuncertainty as to their general objects and consequences.\r\n\r\nUpon a careful consideration of the language of the section of this bill\r\nabove given it seems to me to be so uncertain and liable to such\r\nconflicting constructions and to be subject to such unjust and\r\nmischievous application as to alone furnish sufficient ground for\r\ndisapproving the proposed legislation.\r\n\r\nPersons seeking to obtain the pension provided by this section must be\r\nnow or hereafter--\r\n\r\n1. \"Suffering from mental or physical disability.\"\r\n\r\n2. Such disability must not be \"the result of their own vicious habits\r\nor gross carelessness.\"\r\n\r\n3. Such disability must be such as \"incapacitates them for the\r\nperformance of labor in such a degree as to render them unable to earn\r\na support.\"\r\n\r\n4. They must be \"dependent upon their daily labor for support.\"\r\n\r\n5. Upon proof of these conditions they shall \"be placed on the lists of\r\ninvalid pensioners of the United States, and be entitled to receive for\r\nsuch total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor $12 per\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that the words last quoted, \"such total inability to\r\nprocure their subsistence by daily labor,\" at all qualify the conditions\r\nprescribed in the preceding language of the section. The \"total\r\ninability\" spoken of must be \"such\" inability--that is, the inability\r\nalready described and constituted by the conditions already detailed in\r\nthe previous parts of the section.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes important to consider the meaning and the scope of these\r\nlast-mentioned conditions.\r\n\r\nThe mental and physical disability spoken of has a distinct meaning in\r\nthe practice of the Pension Bureau and includes every impairment of\r\nbodily or mental strength and vigor. For such disabilities there are now\r\npaid 131 different rates of pension, ranging from $1 to $100 per month.\r\n\r\nThis disability must not be the result of the applicant's \"vicious\r\nhabits or gross carelessness.\" Practically this provision is not\r\nimportant. The attempt of the Government to escape the payment of a\r\npension on such a plea would of course in a very large majority of\r\ninstances, and regardless of the merits of the case, prove a failure.\r\nThere would be that strange but nearly universal willingness to help the\r\nindividual as between him and the public Treasury which goes very far to\r\ninsure a state of proof in favor of the claimant.\r\n\r\nThe disability of applicants must be such as to \"incapacitate them for\r\nthe performance of labor in such a degree as to render them unable to\r\nearn a support.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there is no limitation or definition of the\r\nincapacitating injury or ailment itself. It need only be such a degree\r\nof disability from any cause as renders the claimant unable to earn a\r\nsupport by labor. It seems to me that the \"support\" here mentioned as\r\none which can not be earned is a complete and entire support, with no\r\ndiminution on account of the least impairment of physical or mental\r\ncondition. If it had been intended to embrace only those who by disease\r\nor injury were totally unable to labor, it would have been very easy to\r\nexpress that idea, instead of recognizing, as is done, a \"degree\" of\r\nsuch inability.\r\n\r\nWhat is a support? Who is to determine whether a man earns it, or has\r\nit, or has it not? Is the Government to enter the homes of claimants for\r\npension and after an examination of their surroundings and circumstances\r\nsettle those questions? Shall the Government say to one man that his\r\nmanner of subsistence by his earnings is a support and to another that\r\nthe things his earnings furnish are not a support? Any attempt, however\r\nhonest, to administer this law in such a manner would necessarily\r\nproduce more unfairness and unjust discrimination and give more scope\r\nfor partisan partiality, and would result in more perversion of the\r\nGovernment's benevolent intentions, than the execution of any statute\r\nought to permit.\r\n\r\nIf in the effort to carry out the proposed law the degree of disability\r\nas related to earnings be considered for the purpose of discovering if\r\nin any way it curtails the support which the applicant, if entirely\r\nsound, would earn, and to which he is entitled, we enter the broad field\r\nlong occupied by the Pension Bureau, and we recognize as the only\r\ndifference between the proposed legislation and previous laws passed for\r\nthe benefit of the surviving soldiers of the Civil War the incurrence in\r\none case of disabilities in military service and in the other\r\ndisabilities existing, but in no way connected with or resulting from\r\nsuch service.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that in no case is there any grading of this\r\nproposed pension. Under the operation of the rule first suggested, if\r\nthere is a lack in any degree, great or small, of the ability to earn\r\nsuch a support as the Government determines the claimant should have,\r\nand, by the application of the rule secondly suggested, if there is a\r\nreduction in any degree of the support which he might earn if sound, he\r\nis entitled to a pension of $12.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, and under the proviso of the proposed bill\r\npermitting persons now receiving pensions to be admitted to the benefits\r\nof the act, I do not see how those now on the pension roll for\r\ndisabilities incurred in the service, and which diminish their earning\r\ncapacity, can be denied the pension provided in this bill.\r\n\r\nOf course none will apply who are now receiving $12 or more per month.\r\nBut on the 30th day of June, 1886, there were on the pension rolls\r\n202,621 persons who were receiving fifty-eight different rates of\r\npension from $1 to $11.75 per month. Of these, 28,142 were receiving $2\r\nper month; 63,116, $4 per month; 37,254, $6 per month, and 50,274, whose\r\ndisabilities were rated as total, $8 per month.\r\n\r\nAs to the meaning of the section of the bill under consideration there\r\nappears to have been quite a difference of opinion among its advocates\r\nin the Congress. The chairman of the Committee on Pensions in the House\r\nof Representatives, who reported the bill, declared that there was in it\r\nno provision for pensioning anyone who has a less disability than a\r\ntotal inability to labor, and that it was a charity measure. The\r\nchairman of the Committee on Pensions in the Senate, having charge of\r\nthe bill in that body, dissented from the construction of the bill\r\nannounced in the House of Representatives, and declared that it not only\r\nembraced all soldiers totally disabled, but, in his judgment, all who\r\nare disabled to any considerable extent; and such a construction was\r\nsubstantially given to the bill by another distinguished Senator, who,\r\nas a former Secretary of the Interior, had imposed upon him the duty of\r\nexecuting pension laws and determining their intent and meaning.\r\n\r\nAnother condition required of claimants under this act is that they\r\nshall be \"dependent upon their daily labor for support.\"\r\n\r\nThis language, which may be said to assume that there exists within the\r\nreach of the persons mentioned \"labor,\" or the ability in some degree to\r\nwork, is more aptly used in a statute describing those not wholly\r\ndeprived of this ability than in one which deals with those utterly\r\nunable to work.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that it may fairly be contended that under the\r\nprovisions of this section any soldier whose faculties of mind or body\r\nhave become impaired by accident, disease, or age, irrespective of his\r\nservice in the Army as a cause, and who by his labor only is left\r\nincapable of gaining the fair support he might with unimpaired powers\r\nhave provided for himself, and who is not so well endowed with this\r\nworld's goods as to live without work, may claim to participate in its\r\nbounty; that it is not required that he should be without property, but\r\nonly that labor should be necessary to his support in some degree; nor\r\nis it required that he should be now receiving support from others.\r\n\r\nBelieving this to be the proper interpretation of the bill, I can not\r\nbut remember that the soldiers of our Civil War in their pay and bounty\r\nreceived such compensation for military service as has never been\r\nreceived by soldiers before since mankind first went to war; that never\r\nbefore on behalf of any soldiery have so many and such generous laws\r\nbeen passed to relieve against the incidents of war; that statutes have\r\nbeen passed giving them a preference in all public employments; that the\r\nreally needy and homeless Union soldiers of the rebellion have been to a\r\nlarge extent provided for at soldiers' homes, instituted and supported\r\nby the Government, where they are maintained together, free from the\r\nsense of degradation which attaches to the usual support of charity; and\r\nthat never before in the history of the country has it been proposed to\r\nrender Government aid toward the support of any of its soldiers based\r\nalone upon a military service so recent, and where age and circumstances\r\nappeared so little to demand such aid.\r\n\r\nHitherto such relief has been granted to surviving soldiers few in\r\nnumber, venerable in age, after a long lapse of time since their\r\nmilitary service, and as a parting benefaction tendered by a grateful\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI can not believe that the vast peaceful army of Union soldiers, who,\r\nhaving contentedly resumed their places in the ordinary avocations of\r\nlife, cherish as sacred the memory of patriotic service, or who, having\r\nbeen disabled by the casualties of war, justly regard the present\r\npension roll on which appear their names as a roll of honor, desire at\r\nthis time and in the present exigency to be confounded with those who\r\nthrough such a bill as this are willing to be objects of simple charity\r\nand to gain a place upon the pension roll through alleged dependence.\r\n\r\nRecent personal observation and experience constrain me to refer to\r\nanother result which will inevitably follow the passage of this bill. It\r\nis sad, but nevertheless true, that already in the matter of procuring\r\npensions there exists a widespread disregard of truth and good faith,\r\nstimulated by those who as agents undertake to establish claims for\r\npensions heedlessly entered upon by the expectant beneficiary, and\r\nencouraged, or at least not condemned, by those unwilling to obstruct\r\na neighbor's plans.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of this proposed law under any interpretation a wide\r\nfield of inquiry would be opened for the establishment of facts largely\r\nwithin the knowledge of the claimants alone, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat the race after the pensions offered by this bill would not only\r\nstimulate weakness and pretended incapacity for labor, but put a further\r\npremium on dishonesty and mendacity.\r\n\r\nThe effect of new invitations to apply for pensions or of new advantages\r\nadded to causes for pensions already existing is sometimes startling.\r\n\r\nThus in March, 1879, large arrearages of pensions were allowed to be\r\nadded to all claims filed prior to July 1, 1880. For the year from July\r\n1, 1879, to July 1, 1880, there were filed 110,673 claims, though in the\r\nyear immediately previous there were but 36,832 filed, and in the year\r\nfollowing but 18,455.\r\n\r\nWhile cost should not be set against a patriotic duty or the recognition\r\nof a right, still when a measure proposed is based upon generosity or\r\nmotives of charity it is not amiss to meditate somewhat upon the expense\r\nwhich it involves. Experience has demonstrated, I believe, that all\r\nestimates concerning the probable future cost of a pension list are\r\nuncertain and unreliable and always fall far below actual realization.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the House Committee on Pensions calculates that the\r\nnumber of pensioners under this bill would be 33,105 and the increased\r\ncost $4,767,120. This is upon the theory that only those who are\r\nentirely unable to work would be its beneficiaries. Such was the\r\nprinciple of the Revolutionary pension law of 1818, much more clearly\r\nstated, it seems to me, than in this bill. When the law of 1818 was upon\r\nits passage in Congress, the number of pensioners to be benefited\r\nthereby was thought to be 374; but the number of applicants under the\r\nact was 22,297, and the number of pensions actually allowed 20,485,\r\ncosting, it is reported, for the first year, $1,847,900, instead of\r\n$40,000, the estimated expense for that period.\r\n\r\nA law was passed in 1853 for the benefit of the surviving widows of\r\nRevolutionary soldiers who were married after January 1, 1800. It was\r\nestimated that they numbered 300 at the time of the passage of the act;\r\nbut the number of pensions allowed was 3,742, and the amount paid for\r\nsuch pensions during the first year of the operation of the act was\r\n$180,000, instead of $24,000, as had been estimated.\r\n\r\nI have made no search for other illustrations, and the above, being at\r\nhand, are given as tending to show that estimates can not be relied upon\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\nIf none should be pensioned under this bill except those utterly unable\r\nto work, I am satisfied that the cost stated in the estimate referred to\r\nwould be many times multiplied, and with a constant increase from year\r\nto year; and if those partially unable to earn their support should be\r\nadmitted to the privileges of this bill, the probable increase of\r\nexpense would be almost appalling.\r\n\r\nI think it may be said that at the close of the War of the Rebellion\r\nevery Northern State and a great majority of Northern counties and\r\ncities were burdened with taxation on account of the large bounties paid\r\nour soldiers; and the bonded debt thereby created still constitutes\r\na large item in the account of the tax gatherer against the people.\r\nFederal taxation, no less borne by the people than that directly levied\r\nupon their property, is still maintained at the rate made necessary by\r\nthe exigencies of war. If this bill should become a law, with its\r\ntremendous addition to our pension obligation, I am thoroughly convinced\r\nthat further efforts to reduce the Federal revenue and restore some part\r\nof it to our people will, and perhaps should, be seriously questioned.\r\n\r\nIt has constantly been a cause of pride and congratulation to the\r\nAmerican citizen that his country is not put to the charge of\r\nmaintaining a large standing army in time of peace. Yet we are now\r\nliving under a war tax which has been tolerated in peaceful times to\r\nmeet the obligations incurred in war. But for years past, in all parts\r\nof the country, the demand for the reduction of the burdens of taxation\r\nupon our labor and production has increased in volume and urgency.\r\n\r\nI am not willing to approve a measure presenting the objections to which\r\nthis bill is subject, and which, moreover, will have the effect of\r\ndisappointing the expectation of the people and their desire and hope\r\nfor relief from war taxation in time of peace.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message the following language was used:\r\n\r\n  Every patriotic heart responds to a tender consideration for those who,\r\n  having served their country long and well, are reduced to destitution\r\n  and dependence, not as an incident of their service, but with advancing\r\n  age or through sickness or misfortune. We are all tempted by the\r\n  contemplation of such a condition to supply relief, and are often\r\n  impatient of the limitations of public duty. Yielding to no one in the\r\n  desire to indulge this feeling of consideration, I can not rid myself\r\n  of the conviction that if these ex-soldiers are to be relieved they\r\n  and their cause are entitled to the benefit of an enactment under\r\n  which relief may be claimed as a right, and that such relief should be\r\n  granted under the sanction of law, not in evasion of it; nor should\r\n  such worthy objects of care, all equally entitled, be remitted to the\r\n  unequal operation of sympathy or the tender mercies of social and\r\n  political influence, with their unjust discriminations.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think that the objects, the conditions, and the limitations\r\nthus suggested are contained in the bill under consideration.\r\n\r\nI adhere to the sentiments thus heretofore expressed. But the evil\r\nthreatened by this bill is, in my opinion, such that, charged with a\r\ngreat responsibility in behalf of the people, I can not do otherwise\r\nthan to bring to the consideration of this measure my best efforts of\r\nthought and judgment and perform my constitutional duty in relation\r\nthereto, regardless of all consequences except such as appear to me\r\nto be related to the best and highest interests of the country.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 16, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval House bill No. 10203, entitled \"An act to\r\nenable the Commissioner of Agriculture to make a special distribution of\r\nseeds in the drought-stricken counties of Texas, and making an\r\nappropriation therefor.\"\r\n\r\nIt is represented that a long-continued and extensive drought has\r\nexisted in certain portions of the State of Texas, resulting in a\r\nfailure of crops and consequent distress and destitution.\r\n\r\nThough there has been some difference in statements concerning the\r\nextent of the people's needs in the localities thus affected, there\r\nseems to be no doubt that there has existed a condition calling for\r\nrelief; and I am willing to believe that, notwithstanding the aid\r\nalready furnished, a donation of seed grain to the farmers located in\r\nthis region, to enable them to put in new crops, would serve to avert\r\na continuance or return of an unfortunate blight.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan, as proposed\r\nby this bill, to indulge a benevolent and charitable sentiment through\r\nthe appropriation of public funds for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and\r\nI do not believe that the power and duty of the General Government ought\r\nto be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no\r\nmanner properly related to the public service or benefit. A prevalent\r\ntendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should,\r\nI think, be steadfastly resisted, to the end that the lesson should be\r\nconstantly enforced that though the people support the Government the\r\nGovernment should not support the people.\r\n\r\nThe friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon\r\nto relieve their fellow-citizens in misfortune. This has been repeatedly\r\nand quite lately demonstrated. Federal aid in such cases encourages the\r\nexpectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens\r\nthe sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the\r\nindulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which\r\nstrengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt is within my personal knowledge that individual aid has to some\r\nextent already been extended to the sufferers mentioned in this bill.\r\nThe failure of the proposed appropriation of $10,000 additional to meet\r\ntheir remaining wants will not necessarily result in continued distress\r\nif the emergency is fully made known to the people of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is here suggested that the Commissioner of Agriculture is annually\r\ndirected to expend a large sum of money for the purchase, propagation,\r\nand distribution of seeds and other things of this description,\r\ntwo-thirds of which are, upon the request of Senators, Representatives,\r\nand Delegates in Congress, supplied to them for distribution among their\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of the current year for this purpose is $100,000, and\r\nit will probably be no less in the appropriation for the ensuing year.\r\nI understand that a large quantity of grain is furnished for such\r\ndistribution, and it is supposed that this free apportionment among\r\ntheir neighbors is a privilege which may be waived by our Senators and\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIf sufficient of them should request the Commissioner of Agriculture\r\nto send their shares of the grain thus allowed them to the suffering\r\nfarmers of Texas, they might be enabled to sow their crops, the\r\nconstituents for whom in theory this grain is intended could well bear\r\nthe temporary deprivation, and the donors would experience the\r\nsatisfaction attending deeds of charity.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 19, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 859, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Charlotte O'Neal.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill proposes to grant a pension to the beneficiary therein named\r\nas the widow of Richard O'Neal, late colonel of the Twenty-sixth\r\nRegiment Indiana Volunteers.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the committee in the Senate to whom this bill was\r\nreferred it is stated that the deceased soldier was the first colonel of\r\nthe regiment named; that he resigned from the Army, and was by order of\r\nthe governor of Indiana put in charge of the United States camps at\r\nIndianapolis. A military order is made part of the report, announcing\r\nthat the funeral of Lieutenant-Colonel Richard O'Neal will take place\r\nJanuary 6, 1863, and reciting the fact that the deceased had charge of\r\nthe camps near Indianapolis for the preceding four months.\r\n\r\nIt is distinctly alleged in the report that the beneficiary did not\r\napply to the Pension Bureau for relief because the disease of which her\r\nhusband died was incurred after his resignation.\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department fail to show that there was a colonel\r\nof the Twenty-sixth Indiana Regiment named Richard O'Neal, but it does\r\nappear that Richard Neal was lieutenant-colonel of said regiment; that\r\nhe was mustered in August 31, 1861, and resigned June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nIf this is the officer whose widow is named in the bill, the proposition\r\nis to pension a widow of a soldier who, after ten months' service,\r\nresigned, and who seven months after his resignation died of disease\r\nwhich was in no manner related to his military service.\r\n\r\nThere is besides such a discrepancy between the name given in the bill\r\nand the name of the officer who served as lieutenant-colonel in the\r\nregiment mentioned that if the merits were with the widow the bill would\r\nneed further Congressional consideration.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 19, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 1626, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to John Reed, Sr.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Senate Committee on Pensions merely states that the\r\nmother of John Reed was granted a pension, commencing the 5th day of\r\nDecember, 1862; that she has since died, and that the proposed bill is\r\nto secure a pension to John Reed, Sr., the aged and dependent father of\r\nthe deceased soldier.\r\n\r\nThe records show that the beneficiary named in this bill filed an\r\napplication for a pension in 1877, alleging that he was the father of\r\nJohn Reed, who died in the service, and that his wife, the mother of the\r\ndeceased soldier, died May 10, 1872, and that he, the father, was mainly\r\ndependent upon his son for support. He filed evidence of the mother's\r\ndeath, and one witness alleged that he was present at her death and\r\nattended her funeral.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Martha Reed, the mother of the soldier, filed her application\r\nfor pension, in which she at first claimed to be the widow of John Reed.\r\nShe afterwards, however, alleged that her husband, John Reed, abandoned\r\nhis family in 1859 and had not thereafter contributed to their support,\r\nand that the soldier was her main support after such abandonment. She\r\nwas allowed a pension as dependent mother, which commenced in 1862, the\r\ndate of her son's death, and seems to have terminated July 22, 1884,\r\nwhen she died.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the father was rejected in 1883 for the reason that the\r\nmother, who had a prior right, was still living, and when his claim was\r\nagain pressed in 1886 he was informed that his abandonment of his family\r\nin 1859 precluded the idea that he was entitled to a pension as being\r\ndependent upon the soldier for support.\r\n\r\nOf course these decisions were correct in law, in equity, and in morals.\r\n\r\nThis case demonstrates the means employed in attempts to cheat the\r\nGovernment in applications for pensions--too often successful.\r\n\r\nThe allegation in 1877 of the man who now poses as the aged and\r\ndependent father of a dead soldier that the mother died in 1872, when\r\nat that time her claim was pending for pension largely based upon his\r\nabandonment; the affidavit of the man who testified that he saw her die\r\nin 1872; the effrontery of this unworthy father renewing his claim after\r\nthe detection of his fraud and the actual death of the mother, and the\r\nallegation of the mother that she was a widow when in fact she was an\r\nabandoned wife, show the processes which enter into these claims for\r\npensions and the boldness with which plans are sometimes concocted to\r\nrob the Government by actually trafficking in death and imposing upon\r\nthe sacred sentiments of patriotism and national gratitude.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 21, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 2452, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Rachel Ann Pierpont.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time this bill was introduced and passed an application for\r\npension on behalf of the beneficiary named was pending in the Pension\r\nBureau. This application was filed in December, 1879. Within the last\r\nfew days, and on the 17th day of February, 1887, a pension was granted\r\nupon said application and a certificate issued at precisely the same\r\nrate which the bill herewith returned authorizes.\r\n\r\nBut the pension under the general laws dates from the time of filing the\r\napplication in 1879, while under a special act it would date only from\r\nthe time of its passage.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of the beneficiary and for her advantage the special\r\nbill is therefore disapproved.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 21, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 2111, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Jacob Smith.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill filed his claim for a pension\r\nNovember 11, 1882. He seems upon the facts presented to be justly\r\nentitled to it, and since this bill has been in my hands the\r\nCommissioner of Pensions has reported to me that a certificate therefor\r\nwould at once be issued.\r\n\r\nUnder such a certificate this disabled soldier's pension will commence\r\nNovember 11, 1882. Under this bill, if approved, it would date only from\r\nthe time of its approval. I suppose his certificate has already been\r\nissued, and I am unwilling to jeopardize the advantages he has gained\r\nthereunder, as might be done if the bill herewith returned became a law.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 21, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 1768, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to John D. Fincher.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted August 6, 1862, and was\r\ndischarged for disability February 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon's certificate of disability given at the time of the\r\nsoldier's discharge recites \"general debility, which will disable him\r\nfrom performing the duties of a soldier for a good period of time. The\r\ndisease was contracted by exposure and fatigue while performing the\r\nduties of a soldier.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimant filed his application for pension in September, 1882,\r\nnearly twenty years after his discharge, alleging that in November,\r\n1862, he was attacked with bilious fever, followed by chronic diarrhea\r\nand lung trouble.\r\n\r\nIn support of his application an affidavit of a comrade was filed,\r\nsetting forth the fact that the claimant was taken sick, as he alleged,\r\nin the fall of 1862, and that he was sent to the hospital on that\r\naccount. The affidavit further expresses the belief that the claimant\r\nstill suffers from the effects of his sickness and exposure.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am informed, and so far as the committee's report discloses,\r\nthis is the only proof furnished of any continuance of disability at the\r\ntime of filing the application for pension, and this proof, if it may\r\nbe so regarded, is the mere expression of an opinion or belief, not\r\nnecessarily based upon any personal knowledge, and which might have been\r\nhonestly expressed if derived from representations of the claimant\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of the case the claimant was examined by a surgeon in\r\n1882, whose report seems to negative all ailments except as one may be\r\nfound in the fact alleged therein that he had pneumonia in 1868, and\r\nthat there might be some pleuritic adhesions, plainly inferring that if\r\nsuch adhesions existed they were the result of the sickness to which he\r\nrefers.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1885, the claimant was again examined by a board of\r\nsurgeons. This examination seems to have been very carefully and\r\nthoroughly made, and as a result of the same the board reported that\r\nthere was no disability. On this ground the claim was rejected.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt as to the sickness of the claimant during his service\r\nand his disability at the time of his discharge, but unless the report\r\nof the board of surgeons is to be impeached without apparent reason\r\nthere is as little doubt of the claimant's complete recovery.\r\n\r\nNo case has been presented to me in which the evidence afforded of a\r\ncontinuance of disability seems so inconclusive. In these circumstances\r\nthe report of the board of surgeons appears to be upon the evidence\r\nbefore me almost uncontradicted.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No 7327, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Anthony McRobertson.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was badly wounded in a battle which\r\noccurred about the 17th day of November, 1863.\r\n\r\nHe applied for pension in 1874, and the same was granted in November,\r\n1886, to date from the time of his disability, November 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nHe is now receiving the highest rate allowed under the general law for\r\ncases such as his, and he would be entitled to no more under the special\r\nact.\r\n\r\nIt could not, therefore, by any possibility be of the least benefit to\r\nhim, but, on the other hand, might jeopardize his advantages already\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 8002, entitled \"An act\r\nto increase the pension of Loren Burritt.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted in October, 1863, and in\r\nDecember of that year was mustered in as major of the Eighth Regiment\r\nUnited States Colored Troops; was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and\r\nvery badly wounded in February, 1864, and was mustered out with his\r\nregiment November 10, 1865.\r\n\r\nHis condition at the present time is most pitiable, and his helplessness\r\nis such that he needs the constant care and assistance of others. He was\r\nobliged to give up business about the year 1873.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he was pensioned for his wound, which was in the right leg; and\r\nsuch pension has been increased from time to time until he is now in the\r\nreceipt of $72 per month, the highest pension allowed under general\r\nlaws. This rate was awarded him under a law passed in 1880, increasing\r\nfrom $50 to $72 per month the pensions of those who were rendered\r\npermanently and totally helpless, so that they required the regular and\r\npersonal attendance of another.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1886, there were 1,009 persons on the rolls\r\nreceiving this rate of pension.\r\n\r\nThis bill was reported upon adversely by the House Committee on\r\nPensions, and they, while fully acknowledging the distressing\r\ncircumstances surrounding the case, felt constrained to adverse action\r\non the ground, as stated in the language of their report, that \"there\r\nare many cases just as helpless and requiring as much attention as this\r\none, and were the relief asked for granted in this instance it might\r\nreasonably be looked for in all.\"\r\n\r\nNo man can check, if he would, the feeling of sympathy and pity aroused\r\nby the contemplation of utter helplessness as the result of patriotic\r\nand faithful military service; but in the midst of all this I can not\r\nput out of mind the soldiers in this condition who were privates in the\r\nranks, who sustained the utmost hardships of war, but who, because they\r\nwere privates and in the humble walks of life, are not so apt to share\r\nin special favors of Congressional action. I find no reason why this\r\nbeneficiary should be singled out from his class, except it be that he\r\nwas a lieutenant-colonel instead of a private.\r\n\r\nI am aware of a precedent for the legislation proposed, which is\r\nfurnished by an enactment of the last session of Congress, to which I\r\nassented, as I think improvidently; but I am certain that exact equality\r\nand fairness in the treatment of our veterans is, after all, more just,\r\nbeneficent, and useful than unfair discrimination in favor of officers\r\nor the special benefit born of sympathy in individual cases.\r\n\r\nI am constrained, therefore, to agree with the House Committee on\r\nPensions in their views of this bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 10082, entitled \"An\r\nact to increase the pension of Margaret R. Jones.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary mentioned in this bill is now receiving the highest rate\r\nof pension allowed in cases such as hers under the general law.\r\n\r\nAll the information which is available to me fails to furnish any reason\r\nwhy this pension should be specially increased, except the general\r\nstatement in the claimant's petition that she is in necessitous\r\ncircumstances and that the rate now allowed her is insufficient for her\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe further statement in the petition that her husband's death \"was\r\ncaused prematurely by his endeavor to comply with unusual,\r\ndisrespectful, and indefinite orders\" to go to League Island Navy-Yard\r\ncertainly does not in all its bearings furnish conclusive proof that his\r\nwidow's pension should be increased beyond that furnished others in her\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5877, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of William H. Morhiser.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary, though apparently not regularly enlisted in the\r\nmilitary service of the country during the time covered by this bill for\r\nhis relief, performed military duty, was captured and imprisoned. No\r\ntechnicality should be interposed in considering this bill to prevent\r\nthe receipt by him of the same pay and allowances awarded under like\r\ncircumstances to soldiers regularly enlisted.\r\n\r\nBut this bill proposes to appropriate for the benefit of this claimant\r\nsuch sum as pay and allowances as would be allowed a private of cavalry\r\nfrom November 30, 1863, to January 1, 1865. It appears from the records\r\nof the War Department that he has already been paid for at least two\r\nmonths of that time.\r\n\r\nThe bill also provides that there shall also be allowed to the claimant\r\nsuch additional pay and allowances, as commutation of rations and so\r\nforth, as were allowed prisoners of war, from July 30, 1864, to January\r\n1, 1865. The records disclose the fact that he has been allowed\r\ncommutation of rations from July 30, 1864, to December 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nAs the purpose of this bill, as gathered from the report of the\r\ncommittee to whom it was referred, appears to be to secure for the\r\nclaimant therein named compensation \"at the rate at which other soldiers\r\nin the same situation were paid,\" and as he seems already to have\r\nreceived a considerable part of the compensation provided for in the\r\nbill, I am led to suppose that a mistake has been made in framing the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 24, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 7648, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of the estate of the late John How, Indian agent, and his\r\nsureties.\"\r\n\r\nJohn How was appointed Indian agent in July, 1878, and upon such\r\nappointment gave a bond to the Government in the penal sum of $10,000\r\nconditioned for the faithful performance of his duties as such agent and\r\nto protect the Government from loss by mismanagement or malfeasance in\r\nhis official conduct. The parties named in the bill were his sureties on\r\nsaid bond.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of December, 1881, upon a report of inspectors connected\r\nwith the Indian Bureau suggesting frauds and mismanagement in the\r\nconduct of this agency, Mr. How was suspended from his office, which\r\nsuspension was approved by the President in January, 1882.\r\n\r\nAfter such suspension the accounts of the agent were examined and\r\nvarious explanations offered by him in relation thereto. It is stated,\r\nhowever, in a report from the Indian Office now before me, that such\r\nexplanations were deemed by that office sufficient to remove only a\r\nsmall part of the items in the accounts which were questioned. The\r\nmatter was thereupon referred to the Treasury Department for further\r\nexamination and adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe Second Comptroller reports that the final settlement of this agent's\r\naccounts was pending before the accounting officers for upward of\r\neighteen months, affording ample opportunity for any explanation which\r\nmight be deemed necessary and proper, and that on the 21st day of July,\r\n1885, a final adjustment was made of the said accounts, by which a sum\r\nvery much in excess of the penalty of his bond was found due from said\r\nagent to the Government.\r\n\r\nA suit was afterwards instituted against the agent and his sureties to\r\nrecover the amount thus found due, so far as the bond covered the same.\r\n\r\nThis suit is still pending.\r\n\r\nThe object of the bill now under consideration is to wholly release and\r\ndischarge these sureties from any liability upon said bond.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the opinion of all the officers of the Government who\r\nhave examined the matter at all that a debt exists in favor of the\r\nGovernment upon this bond. It is reported that a large amount of\r\nevidence has been taken, and that in the opinion of these officers the\r\namount due the Government can not be reduced to a less amount than the\r\npenalty of the bond.\r\n\r\nThe Second Comptroller states, as results of examinations made in his\r\noffice and by the Second Auditor, that it appears that many of the\r\nvouchers presented by the agent were fictitious, the persons in whose\r\nnames they were given testifying that services and supplies therein\r\nmentioned were never rendered or furnished; that in other cases parties\r\ndenied the genuineness of vouchers purporting to be made by them; that a\r\nlarge voucher apparently given for cattle was actually given for money\r\nloaned, and that supplies bought with Government funds were appropriated\r\nfor the agent's personal benefit.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that it was intended by the Congress to entirely\r\nrelieve these sureties if a condition exists such as is above set out,\r\nwhich results in an indebtedness to the Government. The proposed\r\nlegislation, judging from the report of the House Committee on Claims,\r\nseems rather to proceed upon the theory that no sum is due the\r\nGovernment in the premises.\r\n\r\nI think it will hardly be claimed that the patient investigation of the\r\naccounting officers should be lightly discredited in this case; and it\r\nseems to me that justness to the Government and fairness to the sureties\r\nseeking relief will presumably be secured by the further prosecution of\r\nthe suit already instituted, in which the truth of all matters involved\r\ncan be thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 25, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 1162, entitled \"An\r\nact for the erection of a post-office building at Lynn, Mass.\"\r\n\r\nThe title of this bill sufficiently indicates its purpose.\r\n\r\nCongressional action in its favor appears to be based, as usual in such\r\ncases, upon representations concerning the population of the town in\r\nwhich it is proposed to erect the building, and the increase in such\r\npopulation, the number of railroad trains arriving and departing daily,\r\nand various other items calculated to demonstrate the importance of the\r\ncity selected for Federal decoration.\r\n\r\nThese statements are supplemented by a report from the postmaster,\r\nsetting forth that his postal receipts are increasing, giving the number\r\nof square feet now occupied by his office, the amount of rent paid, and\r\nthe number of his employees.\r\n\r\nThis bill, unlike others of its class which seek to provide a place for\r\na number of Federal offices, simply authorizes the construction of a\r\nbuilding for the accommodation of the post-office alone.\r\n\r\nThe report of the postmaster differs also in this case from those which\r\nare usually furnished, inasmuch as it is therein distinctly stated that\r\nthe space now furnished for his office is sufficient for its present\r\noperations. He adds, however, that from present indications there will\r\nbe a large increase in the business of the office during the next ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that there is no necessity for the expenditure of\r\n$100,000, the amount limited in this bill, or any other sum, for the\r\nconstruction of the proposed building to meet the wants of the\r\nGovernment, and for this reason I am constrained to disapprove the\r\nproposed legislation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 2045, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Mrs. Sarah Hamilton.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Hamilton, the husband of the beneficiary named in this bill,\r\nenlisted September 2, 1862. Upon the records he is reported present\r\nto April 30, 1863; deserted May 27, 1863. His name is dropped from\r\nsubsequent rolls to February 29, 1864, when he is reported as a deserter\r\nin arrest. He is not borne upon the rolls for March and April, 1864;\r\nfor May and June, 1864, he is reported absent in arrest; for July and\r\nAugust, present under arrest; and for September and October, present for\r\nduty. He was mustered out with his company May 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe applied for a pension in 1872, alleging that he received an injury to\r\nhis left leg about February 15, 1863, at St. Louis, by falling from a\r\nladder, causing varicose veins and stiffening of the leg.\r\n\r\nHe was granted a pension January 29, 1881, to commence May 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently applied for an increase of pension, claiming that\r\nhis eyes had become affected as a result of his varicose veins. This\r\napplication was rejected upon the ground that the disability for which\r\nhe was pensioned had not increased and that the disease of his eyes was\r\nnot a result of such disability.\r\n\r\nThe pensioner died April 22, 1883, twenty years after his alleged\r\ninjury, of cerebral apoplexy; and a physician states it as his judgment\r\nthat the varicosed condition of the venous system was primarily the\r\ncause of his disabilities and death.\r\n\r\nHis widow filed an application for pension October 31, 1883, which was\r\nrejected upon the ground that the soldier's death was not the result of\r\nhis military service.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the record of the deceased soldier, stained as it is\r\nwith the charge of desertion, and the entire absence of any record proof\r\nof sickness and injury, I should consider myself, in favor of his widow,\r\nbound by the act of the Pension Bureau in allowing him a pension, and\r\nshould cheerfully aid her attempt to procure a pension for herself in\r\nher needy condition, if I was not thoroughly convinced that her\r\nhusband's death had no relation to his military service or any injury\r\nfor which he was pensioned.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary mind it seems impossible that apoplexy could result\r\nfrom such a varicosed condition as is described in this case. I do not\r\nunderstand that the physician who gives a contrary opinion bases his\r\njudgment upon actual observation at the time the soldier died. The last\r\nmedical examination by the Pension Bureau before the soldier's death was\r\nin October, 1882, and resulted in the following report of the examining\r\nsurgeon:\r\n\r\n  Weight, 180 pounds; age, 69 years; has varicose veins of left leg, but\r\n  not to such an extent as to increase the size of the leg or result in\r\n  marked disability; he is entirely blind in both eyes from glaucoma,\r\n  which does not in any degree, in my opinion, depend upon the pensioned\r\n  disability--varicose veins.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that the benefit proposed by this bill can neither be\r\nproperly regarded as a gratuity, based upon the honorable service and\r\nrecord of the soldier, nor predicated on his death resulting from a\r\ndisability incurred in such service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 2210, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Anna Wright.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was granted a pension on the 17th day\r\nof November, 1886, dating from May 25, 1863, and is now under the\r\ngeneral law receiving precisely the pension which she would receive\r\nunder the bill herewith returned if the same should be approved.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 26, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 6976, entitled \"An act\r\nto erect a public building at Portsmouth, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nIt is represented in support of this bill that Portsmouth by its last\r\ncensus had a population of 11,321, and that, it contains at present\r\nnot less than 15,000 inhabitants; that it is a place of considerable\r\nmanufacturing and commercial importance, and that there is no public\r\nbuilding for the transaction of the business of the General Government\r\nnearer than Columbus or Cincinnati, both about 100 miles distant.\r\n\r\nIt is further stated in a communication from the promoter of this bill\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  There is not a Federal public building in the State of Ohio east of the\r\n  line drawn on the accompanying map from Cleveland through Columbus to\r\n  Cincinnati; and when wealth and population and the needs of the public\r\n  service are considered, the distribution of public buildings in the\r\n  State is an unfair one.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is disclosed a theory of expenditure for public buildings which I\r\ncan hardly think should be adopted. If an application for the erection\r\nof such a building is to be determined by the distance between its\r\nproposed location and another public building, or upon the allegation\r\nthat a certain division of a State is without a Government building,\r\nor that the distribution of these buildings in a particular State\r\nis unfair, we shall rapidly be led to an entire disregard of the\r\nconsiderations of necessity and public need which it seems to me should\r\nalone justify the expenditure of public funds for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe care and protection which the Government owes to the people do\r\nnot embrace the grant of public buildings to decorate thriving and\r\nprosperous cities and villages, nor should such buildings be erected\r\nupon any principle of fair distribution among localities.\r\n\r\nThe Government is not an almoner of gifts among the people, but an\r\ninstrumentality by which the people's affairs should be conducted upon\r\nbusiness principles, regulated by the public needs.\r\n\r\nApplying these principles to the case embraced in the bill under\r\nconsideration, we find that at Portsmouth there is a post-office and\r\nan internal revenue collector's office for which the Government should\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that the quarters now furnished for these offices\r\nare inadequate and that more spacious rooms are desirable. In the\r\npost-office there are six employees, and the collector of internal\r\nrevenue has five assistants. The annual rent paid for both these offices\r\nis $600.\r\n\r\nUpon these facts the proposition is to expend $60,000 for a building to\r\naccommodate these offices, entailing after its completion quite a large\r\nsum annually for its care and superintendence.\r\n\r\nThough the sum of $60,000 is the limit fixed for the cost of this\r\nbuilding, if it should be completed for this sum it would be an\r\nexception to the rule in such cases; and if it is absolutely impossible\r\nto do the public business in the quarters now occupied by these offices,\r\nwhich does not appear to be claimed, there can be no difficulty in\r\nsecuring in this enterprising city adequate accommodations at a rent not\r\nlargely in excess of that at present paid.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole it does not appear, as a business proposition, that the\r\nbuilding proposed should be undertaken.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 28, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 531, entitled \"An act\r\nto provide for the erection of a public building at Lafayette, Ind.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill appropriates $50,000 for the purpose indicated in its title.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that a deputy internal-revenue collector is located at\r\nLafayette, but no information is furnished that he has an office there\r\nwhich is or ought to be furnished by the Government. It is not claimed\r\nthat the Federal business at this point requires other accommodation\r\nexcept for the post-office located there.\r\n\r\nAs usual in such cases, the postmaster reports, in reply to inquiries,\r\nthat his present quarters are inadequate, and, as usual, it appears that\r\nthe postal business is increasing. The rent paid for the rooms or\r\nbuilding in which the post-office is kept is $1, 100 per annum.\r\n\r\nI have been informed since this bill has been in my hands that last\r\nspring a building was erected at Lafayette with special reference to\r\nits use for the post-office, and that a part of it was leased by the\r\nGovernment for that purpose for the term of five years. Upon the faith\r\nof such lease the premises thus rented were fitted up and furnished by\r\nthe owner of the building in a manner especially adapted to postal uses,\r\nand an account of such fitting up and furnishing is before me, showing\r\nthe expense of the same to have been more than $2,500.\r\n\r\nIn view of such new and recent arrangements made by the Government for\r\nthe transaction of its postal business at this place, it seems that the\r\nproposed expenditure for the erection of a building for that purpose is\r\nhardly necessary or justifiable.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory proof has been given to me by the Government\r\nof the Netherlands that no light-house and light dues, tonnage dues,\r\nor beacon and buoy dues are imposed in the ports of the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands; that no other equivalent tax of any kind is imposed upon\r\nvessels in said ports, under whatever flag they may sail; that vessels\r\nbelonging to the United States of America and their cargoes are not\r\nrequired in the Netherlands to pay any fee or due of any kind or nature,\r\nor any import due higher or other than is payable by vessels of the\r\nNetherlands or their cargoes; that no export duties are imposed in the\r\nNetherlands; and that in the free ports of the Dutch East Indies, to\r\nwit, Riouw (in the island of Riouw), Pabean, Sangrit, Loloan, and\r\nTamboekoes (in the island of Bali), Koepang (in the island of Timor),\r\nMakassar, Menado, Kema, and Gorontalo (in the island of Celebes),\r\nAmboina, Saparoa, Banda, Ternate, and Kajeli (in the Moluccas), Olehleh\r\nand Bengkalis (in the island of Sumatra), vessels are subjected to no\r\nfiscal tax, and no import or export duties are there levied:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 11 of the\r\nact of Congress entitled \"An act to abolish certain fees for official\r\nservices to American vessels, and to amend the laws relating to shipping\r\ncommissioners, seamen, and owners of vessels, and for other purposes,\"\r\napproved June 19, 1886, do hereby declare and proclaim that from and\r\nafter the date of this my proclamation shall be suspended the collection\r\nof the whole of the duty of 6 cents per ton, not to exceed 30 cents per\r\nton per annum (which is imposed by said section of said act), upon\r\nvessels entered in the ports of the United States from any of the ports\r\nof the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Europe, or from any of the above\r\nnamed free ports of the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\n_Provided_, That there shall be excluded from the benefits of the\r\nsuspension hereby declared and proclaimed the vessels of any foreign\r\ncountry in whose ports the fees or dues of any kind or nature imposed on\r\nvessels of the United States, or the import or export duties on their\r\ncargoes, are in excess of the fees, dues, or duties imposed on the\r\nvessels of such foreign country or their cargoes, or of the fees, dues,\r\nor duties imposed on the vessels of the country in which are the ports\r\nmentioned in this proclamation, or the cargoes of such vessels.\r\n\r\nAnd the suspension hereby declared and proclaimed shall continue so long\r\nas the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the\r\nUnited States and their cargoes shall be continued in the said ports of\r\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands in Europe and the said free ports of the\r\nDutch East Indies, and no longer.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 22d day of April, A.D. 1887, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the one hundred and eleventh.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  T.F.

ENDICOTT,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to state that there are now in this office, stored\r\nin one of the attic rooms of the building, a number of Union flags\r\ncaptured in action, but recovered on the fall of the Confederacy and\r\nforwarded to the War Department for safe-keeping, together with a number\r\nof Confederate flags which the fortunes of war placed in our hands\r\nduring the late Civil War.\r\n\r\nWhile in the past favorable action has been taken on applications\r\nproperly supported for the return of Union flags to organizations\r\nrepresenting survivors of the military regiments in the service of the\r\nGovernment, I beg to submit that it would be a graceful act to\r\nanticipate future requests of this nature, and venture to suggest the\r\npropriety of returning all the flags (Union and Confederate) to the\r\nauthorities of the respective States in which the regiments which bore\r\nthese colors were organized, for such final disposition as they may\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nWhile in all the civilized nations of the world trophies taken in war\r\nagainst foreign enemies have been carefully preserved and exhibited as\r\nproud mementos of the nation's military glories, wise and obvious\r\nreasons have always excepted from the rule evidences of past internecine\r\ntroubles which by appeals to the arbitrament of the sword have disturbed\r\nthe peaceful march of a people to its destiny.\r\n\r\nOver twenty years have elapsed since the termination of the late Civil\r\nWar. Many of the prominent leaders, civil and military, of the late\r\nConfederate States are now honored representatives of the people in the\r\nnational councils, or in other eminent positions lend the aid of their\r\ntalents to the wise administration of affairs of the whole country; and\r\nthe people of the several States composing the Union are now united,\r\ntreading the broader road to a glorious future.\r\n\r\nImpressed with these views, I have the honor to submit the suggestion\r\nmade in this letter for the careful consideration it will receive at\r\nyour hands.\r\n\r\nVery truly, yours,\r\n\r\nR.C.

As a Representative from the State\r\nof Illinois in the National Legislature, and subsequently as envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to\r\nFrance, his career was marked by eminent usefulness, in which abilities\r\nof a high order were applied with unsparing devotion and fidelity in the\r\nperformance of the trusts of public power.\r\n\r\nHis private life was unstained, his public service unquestionably great,\r\nand his memory will be cherished with affection and respect by his\r\ngrateful countrymen.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his funeral this Department will be closed for all public\r\nbusiness, and be draped in mourning for ten days thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic and consular officers of the United States in foreign\r\ncountries will be directed to make proper expression of the public\r\nsorrow experienced by the death of Mr. Washburne.\r\n\r\nT.F. BAYARD, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1887_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nYou are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a\r\ncondition of the national finances which imperatively demands immediate\r\nand careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money annually exacted, through the operation of present\r\nlaws, from the industries and necessities of the people largely exceeds\r\nthe sum necessary to meet the expenses of the Government.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every\r\ncitizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and\r\nenterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share toward the\r\ncareful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him,\r\nit is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible\r\nextortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This\r\nwrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of national taxation,\r\nlike other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public\r\nTreasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's\r\ntribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding\r\nplace for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use,\r\nthus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's\r\ndevelopment, preventing investment in productive enterprise, threatening\r\nfinancial disturbance, and inviting schemes of public plunder.\r\n\r\nThis condition of our Treasury is not altogether new, and it has more\r\nthan once of late been submitted to the people's representatives in the\r\nCongress, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet the situation still\r\ncontinues, with aggravated incidents, more than ever presaging financial\r\nconvulsion and widespread disaster.\r\n\r\nIt will not do to neglect this situation because its dangers are not now\r\npalpably imminent and apparent. They exist none the less certainly, and\r\nawait the unforeseen and unexpected occasion when suddenly they will be\r\nprecipitated upon us.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of revenues over public\r\nexpenditures, after complying with the annual requirement of the\r\nsinking-fund act, was $17,859,735.84; during the year ended June 30,\r\n1886, such excess amounted to $49,405,545.20, and during the year ended\r\nJune 30, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,567,849.54.\r\n\r\nThe annual contributions to the sinking fund during the three years\r\nabove specified, amounting in the aggregate to $138,058,320.94, and\r\ndeducted from the surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that\r\npurpose outstanding 3 per cent bonds of the Government. During the six\r\nmonths prior to June 30, 1887, the surplus revenue had grown so large by\r\nrepeated accumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great\r\nsum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of the\r\ncountry, that the sum of $79,864,100 of such surplus was applied to\r\nthe payment of the principal and interest of the 3 per cent bonds\r\nstill outstanding, and which were then payable at the option of the\r\nGovernment. The precarious condition of financial affairs among the\r\npeople still needing relief, immediately after the 30th day of June,\r\n1887, the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then outstanding, amounting\r\nwith principal and interest to the sum of $18,877,500, were called in\r\nand applied to the sinking-fund contribution for the current fiscal\r\nyear. Notwithstanding these operations of the Treasury Department,\r\nrepresentations of distress in business circles not only continued, but\r\nincreased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these circumstances\r\nthe contribution to the sinking fund for the current fiscal year was at\r\nonce completed by the expenditure of $27,684,283.55 in the purchase of\r\nGovernment bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 4-1/2 per cent interest,\r\nthe premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent for the former and\r\n8 per cent for the latter. In addition to this, the interest accruing\r\nduring the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of\r\nthe Government was to some extent anticipated, and banks selected as\r\ndepositories of public money were permitted to somewhat increase their\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nWhile the expedients thus employed to release to the people the money\r\nlying idle in the Treasury served to avert immediate danger, our surplus\r\nrevenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year\r\namounting on the 1st day of December to $55,258,701.19, and estimated to\r\nreach the sum of $113,000,000 on the 30th of June next, at which date it\r\nis expected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the\r\nsurplus in the Treasury to $140,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no assurance that, with such a withdrawal from use of\r\nthe people's circulating medium, our business community may not in the\r\nnear future be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately\r\nproduced from the same cause. And while the functions of our National\r\nTreasury should be few and simple, and while its best condition would be\r\nreached, I believe, by its entire disconnection with private business\r\ninterests, yet when, by a perversion of its purposes, it idly holds\r\nmoney uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be\r\nreason for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the\r\nGovernment to restore in an emergency, without waste or extravagance,\r\nsuch money to its place among the people.\r\n\r\nIf such an emergency arises, there now exists no clear and undoubted\r\nexecutive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent\r\nbonds, which were payable at the option of the Government, has afforded\r\na means for the disbursement of the excess of our revenues; but these\r\nbonds have all been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding the\r\npayment of which we have a right to insist upon. The contribution to\r\nthe sinking fund which furnishes the occasion for expenditure in the\r\npurchase of bonds has been already made for the current year, so that\r\nthere is no outlet in that direction.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing\r\nexecutive power to restore at this time any part of our surplus revenues\r\nto the people by its expenditure consists in the supposition that the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds\r\nof the Government not yet due, at a rate of premium to be agreed upon.\r\nThe only provision of law from which such a power could be derived is\r\nfound in an appropriation bill passed a number of years ago, and it is\r\nsubject to the suspicion that it was intended as temporary and limited\r\nin its application, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and\r\nauthority. No condition ought to exist which would justify the grant\r\nof power to a single official, upon his judgment of its necessity, to\r\nwithhold from or release to the business of the people, in an unusual\r\nmanner, money held in the Treasury, and thus affect at his will the\r\nfinancial situation of the country; and if it is deemed wise to lodge\r\nin the Secretary of the Treasury the authority in the present juncture\r\nto purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and provided, as far\r\nas possible, with such checks and limitations as will define this\r\nofficial's right and discretion and at the same time relieve him from\r\nundue responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring\r\nto circulation the surplus money accumulating in the Treasury, it\r\nshould be borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon\r\nsuch purchase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held\r\nas investments which can not be purchased at any price, and that\r\ncombinations among holders who are willing to sell may unreasonably\r\nenhance the cost of such bonds to the Government.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded\r\nat a less rate of interest and the difference between the old and new\r\nsecurity paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the Treasury.\r\nThe success of this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon the volition\r\nof the holders of the present bonds; and it is not entirely certain that\r\nthe inducement which must be offered them would result in more financial\r\nbenefit to the Government than the purchase of bonds, while the latter\r\nproposition would reduce the principal of the debt by actual payment\r\ninstead of extending it.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to deposit the money held by the Government in banks\r\nthroughout the country for use by the people is, it seems to me,\r\nexceedingly objectionable in principle, as establishing too close a\r\nrelationship between the operations of the Government Treasury and the\r\nbusiness of the country and too extensive a commingling of their money,\r\nthus fostering an unnatural reliance in private business upon public\r\nfunds. If this scheme should be adopted, it should only be done as a\r\ntemporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and\r\nexecutive effort should generally be in the opposite direction, and\r\nshould have a tendency to divorce, as much and as fast as can be safely\r\ndone, the Treasury Department from private enterprise.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not expected that unnecessary and extravagant\r\nappropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation\r\nof an excess of revenue. Such expenditure, besides the demoralization of\r\nall just conceptions of public duty which it entails, stimulates a habit\r\nof reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of\r\nour people or the high and beneficent purposes of our Government.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my\r\ncountrymen, as well as to the attention of their representatives charged\r\nwith the responsibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our\r\nfinancial situation. The failure of the Congress heretofore to provide\r\nagainst the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the\r\ndifficulty must necessarily produce caused a condition of financial\r\ndistress and apprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to the\r\nutmost all the authority and expedients within executive control; and\r\nthese appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued\r\ninaction of Congress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs.\r\n\r\nThough the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which\r\nshould be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to\r\nthe people as well as peril to the country, it is but a result growing\r\nout of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause, constantly reproducing\r\nthe same alarming circumstances--a congested National Treasury and a\r\ndepleted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need\r\nhardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we\r\ncan only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal\r\nof its cause.\r\n\r\nOur scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is\r\ntaken from the people and put into the public Treasury, consists of a\r\ntariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal-revenue\r\ntaxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt\r\nliquors. It must be conceded that none of the things subjected to\r\ninternal-revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessaries. There\r\nappears to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of\r\nthese articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the\r\nburden without hardship to any portion of the people.\r\n\r\nBut our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable, and illogical\r\nsource of unnecessary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended.\r\nThese laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to\r\nconsumers of all articles imported and subject to duty by precisely the\r\nsum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax\r\npaid by those who purchase for use these imported articles. Many of\r\nthese things, however, are raised or manufactured in our own country,\r\nand the duties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called\r\nprotection to these home manufactures, because they render it possible\r\nfor those of our people who are manufacturers to make these taxed\r\narticles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the\r\nimported goods that have paid customs duty. So it happens that while\r\ncomparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people,\r\nwho never used and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase and\r\nuse things of the same kind made in this country, and pay therefor\r\nnearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the\r\nimported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon\r\ninto the public Treasury, but the great majority of our citizens,\r\nwho buy domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least\r\napproximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This\r\nreference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of\r\ninstruction, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the\r\nmanner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic\r\nproducts as well as those who consume imported articles, and thus create\r\na tax upon all our people.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation.\r\nIt must be extensively continued as the source of the Government's\r\nincome; and in a readjustment of our tariff the interests of American\r\nlabor engaged in manufacture should be carefully considered, as well\r\nas the preservation of our manufacturers. It may be called protection\r\nor by any other name, but relief from the hardships and dangers of\r\nour present tariff laws should be devised with especial precaution\r\nagainst imperiling the existence of our manufacturing interests. But\r\nthis existence should not mean a condition which, without regard\r\nto the public welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the\r\nrealization of immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns.\r\nAs the volume and diversity of our national activities increase, new\r\nrecruits are added to those who desire a continuation of the advantages\r\nwhich they conceive the present system of tariff taxation directly\r\naffords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present\r\ncondition been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus engaged\r\nthat they can hardly complain of the suspicion, entertained to a certain\r\nextent, that there exists an organized combination all along the line to\r\nmaintain their advantage.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride\r\nwe rejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American energy and\r\nenterprise, and in the wonderful natural advantages and resources\r\ndeveloped by a century's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to\r\njustify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in\r\nthe land for the benefit of our manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable\r\ndemand for governmental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to\r\ncall our manufactures infant industries still needing the highest and\r\ngreatest degree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from\r\nFederal legislation.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manufactures\r\nresulting from the present tariff is necessary in order that higher\r\nwages may be paid to our workingmen employed in manufactories than are\r\npaid for what is called the pauper labor of Europe. All will acknowledge\r\nthe force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal\r\ncompensation of our laboring people. Our labor is honorable in the eyes\r\nof every American citizen; and as it lies at the foundation of our\r\ndevelopment and progress, it is entitled, without affectation or\r\nhypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The standard of our laborers' life\r\nshould not be measured by that of any other country less favored, and\r\nthey are entitled to their full share of all our advantages.\r\n\r\nBy the last census it is made to appear that of the 17,392,099 of our\r\npopulation engaged in all kinds of industries 7,670,493 are employed in\r\nagriculture, 4,074,238 in professional and personal service (2,934,876\r\nof whom are domestic servants and laborers), while 1,810,256 are\r\nemployed in trade and transportation and 3,837,112 are classed as\r\nemployed in manufacturing and mining.\r\n\r\nFor present purposes, however, the last number given should be\r\nconsiderably reduced. Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be\r\nconceded that there should be deducted from those which it includes\r\n375,143 carpenters and joiners, 285,401 milliners, dressmakers, and\r\nseamstresses, 172,726 blacksmiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses,\r\n102,473 masons, 76,241 butchers, 41,309 bakers, 22,083 plasterers, and\r\n4,891 engaged in manufacturing agricultural implements, amounting in the\r\naggregate to 1,214,023, leaving 2,623,089 persons employed in such\r\nmanufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefited by a high\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nTo these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their\r\nwages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer\r\nsuch suggestions by the allegation that they are in a minority among\r\nthose who labor, and therefore should forego an advantage in the\r\ninterest of low prices for the majority. Their compensation, as it may\r\nbe affected by the operation of tariff laws, should at all times be\r\nscrupulously kept in view; and yet with slight reflection they will not\r\noverlook the fact that they are consumers with the rest; that they too\r\nhave their own wants and those of their families to supply from their\r\nearnings, and that the price of the necessaries of life, as well as the\r\namount of their wages, will regulate the measure of their welfare and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nBut the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to\r\nnecessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the working-man\r\nor the lessening of his wages; and the profits still remaining to the\r\nmanufacturer after a necessary readjustment should furnish no excuse\r\nfor the sacrifice of the interests of his employees, either in their\r\nopportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can\r\nthe worker in manufactures fail to understand that while a high tariff\r\nis claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages,\r\nit certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all\r\nsorts of manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for\r\nthe use of himself and his family. He receives at the desk of his\r\nemployer his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his home is obliged,\r\nin a purchase for family use of an article which embraces his own labor,\r\nto return in the payment of the increase in price which the tariff\r\npermits the hard-earned compensation of many days of toil.\r\n\r\nThe farmer and the agriculturist, who manufacture nothing, but who pay\r\nthe increased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural\r\nimplement, upon all he wears, and upon all he uses and owns, except\r\nthe increase of his flocks and herds and such things as his husbandry\r\nproduces from the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the present\r\nsituation; and he is told that a high duty on imported wool is necessary\r\nfor the benefit of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the\r\nprice of their wool may be increased. They, of course, are not reminded\r\nthat the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his\r\npurchases of clothing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his\r\nfellow-farmer as well as to the manufacturer and merchant, nor is any\r\nmention made of the fact that the sheep owners themselves and their\r\nhouseholds must wear clothing and use other articles manufactured from\r\nthe wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must return\r\ntheir share of this increased price to the tradesman.\r\n\r\nI think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep\r\nowned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks,\r\nnumbering from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported\r\nwool which these sheep yield is 10 cents each pound if of the value of\r\n30 cents or less and 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents. If\r\nthe liberal estimate of 6 pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty\r\nthereon would be 60 or 72 cents; and this may be taken as the utmost\r\nenhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen\r\ndollars would thus represent the increased price of the wool from\r\ntwenty-five sheep and $36 that from the wool of fifty sheep; and at\r\npresent values this addition would amount to about one-third of its\r\nprice. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or a less tariff\r\nprofit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which\r\nin all its changes will adhere to it until it reaches the consumer. When\r\nmanufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use, its cost\r\nis not only increased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a\r\nfurther sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under the\r\noperation of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the\r\nfarmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to\r\nclothe himself and family for the winter. When he faces the tradesman\r\nfor that purpose, he discovers that he is obliged not only to return in\r\nthe way of increased prices his tariff profit on the wool he sold, and\r\nwhich then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but that he\r\nmust add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost\r\ncaused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is\r\naroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a\r\nresult of the tariff scheme, which when he sold his wool seemed so\r\nprofitable, an increase in price more than sufficient to sweep away all\r\nthe tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is compared with all\r\nthe farmers in the country and the small proportion they bear to our\r\npopulation is considered; when it is made apparent that in the case of\r\na large part of those who own sheep the benefit of the present tariff\r\non wool is illusory; and, above all, when it must be conceded that\r\nthe increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a\r\nburden upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and\r\nunemployed, the sick and well, and the young and old, and that it\r\nconstitutes a tax which with relentless grasp is fastened upon the\r\nclothing of every man, woman, and child in the land, reasons are\r\nsuggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be included\r\nin a revision of our tariff laws.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the increased cost to the consumer of our home\r\nmanufactures resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the\r\nsame description, the fact is not overlooked that competition among our\r\ndomestic producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of\r\ntheir products below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is\r\nnotorious that this competition is too often strangled by combinations\r\nquite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which have\r\nfor their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities\r\nmade and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope\r\nfor any consideration in the operation of these selfish schemes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, in the absence of such combination, a healthy and free\r\ncompetition reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home\r\nproduction below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our\r\ntariff laws, and if with such reduced price its manufacture continues to\r\nthrive, it is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which\r\nshould be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to\r\nthe tariff point furnishes proof that someone is willing to accept lower\r\nprices for such commodity and that such prices are remunerative; and\r\nlower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus where\r\neither of these conditions exists a case would seem to be presented for\r\nan easy reduction of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws\r\nare intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus\r\nrevenues of the Government be prevented by the reduction of our customs\r\nduties, and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that in\r\naccomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our people\r\nby granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters\r\nwhere it is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and\r\njustly accorded.\r\n\r\nNor can the presentation made of such considerations be with any\r\ndegree of fairness regarded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our\r\nmanufacturing interests or of any lack of appreciation of their value\r\nand importance.\r\n\r\nThese interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of\r\nour national greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's\r\nprogress. But if in the emergency that presses upon us our manufacturers\r\nare asked to surrender something for the public good and to avert\r\ndisaster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of\r\nadvantages already afforded, should lead them to willing cooperation. No\r\ndemand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of governmental\r\nregard; but they can not fail to be admonished of their duty, as well\r\nas their enlightened self-interest and safety, when they are reminded\r\nof the fact that financial panic and collapse, to which the present\r\ncondition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to our\r\nmanufactures than to other important enterprises. Opportunity for safe,\r\ncareful, and deliberate reform is now offered; and none of us should\r\nbe unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of\r\nthose who have resisted timely and reasonable relief, may insist upon\r\na radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty attending a wise and fair revision of our tariff laws is\r\nnot underestimated. It will require on the part of the Congress great\r\nlabor and care, and especially a broad and national contemplation of the\r\nsubject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as\r\nare unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of the entire country.\r\n\r\nUnder our present laws more than 4,000 articles are subject to duty.\r\nMany of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures, and\r\nmany are hardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A considerable\r\nreduction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list.\r\nThe taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship; but the\r\nnecessaries of life used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon\r\nwhich adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly\r\ncheapened.\r\n\r\nThe radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material used in\r\nmanufactures, or its free importation, is of course an important factor\r\nin any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries. It would not\r\nonly relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on\r\nsuch material, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened that\r\npart of the tariff now laid upon such product, as a compensation to\r\nour manufacturers for the present price of raw material, could be\r\naccordingly modified. Such reduction or free importation would serve\r\nbesides to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a\r\nchange can have any injurious effect upon our manufacturers. On the\r\ncontrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign\r\nmarkets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their\r\nwares by free material. Thus our people might have the opportunity of\r\nextending their sales beyond the limits of home consumption, saving them\r\nfrom the depression, interruption in business, and loss caused by a\r\nglutted domestic market and affording their employees more certain and\r\nsteady labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment.\r\n\r\nThe question thus imperatively presented for solution should be\r\napproached in a spirit higher than partisanship and considered in the\r\nlight of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the\r\naction of those intrusted with the weal of a confiding people. But the\r\nobligation to declared party policy and principle is not wanting to\r\nurge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties\r\nnow represented in the Government have by repeated and authoritative\r\ndeclarations condemned the condition of our laws which permit the\r\ncollection from the people of unnecessary revenue, and have in the most\r\nsolemn manner promised its correction; and neither as citizens nor\r\npartisans are our countrymen in a mood to condone the deliberate\r\nviolation of these pledges.\r\n\r\nOur progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling\r\nupon the theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of\r\nbandying epithets. It is a _condition_ which confronts us, not a\r\ntheory. Relief from this condition may involve a slight reduction\r\nof the advantages which we award our home productions, but the entire\r\nwithdrawal of such advantages should not be contemplated. The question\r\nof free trade is absolutely irrelevant, and the persistent claim made in\r\ncertain quarters that all the efforts to relieve the people from unjust\r\nand unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders is\r\nmischievous and far removed from any consideration for the public good.\r\n\r\nThe simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation\r\nto the necessary expenses of an economical operation of the Government\r\nand to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in\r\nthe Treasury through the perversion of governmental powers. These things\r\ncan and should be done with safety to all our industries, without danger\r\nto the opportunity for remunerative labor which our workingmen need, and\r\nwith benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of\r\nsubsistence and increasing the measure of their comforts.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that the President \"shall from time to time\r\ngive to the Congress information of the state of the Union.\" It has been\r\nthe custom of the Executive, in compliance with this provision, to\r\nannually exhibit to the Congress, at the opening of its session, the\r\ngeneral condition of the country, and to detail with some particularity\r\nthe operations of the different Executive Departments. It would be\r\nespecially agreeable to follow this course at the present time and to\r\ncall attention to the valuable accomplishments of these Departments\r\nduring the last fiscal year; but I am so much impressed with the\r\nparamount importance of the subject to which this communication has thus\r\nfar been devoted that I shall forego the addition of any other topic,\r\nand only urge upon your immediate consideration the \"state of the Union\"\r\nas shown in the present condition of our Treasury and our general fiscal\r\nsituation, upon which every element of our safety and prosperity\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the heads of Departments, which will be submitted,\r\ncontain full and explicit information touching the transaction, of\r\nthe business intrusted to them and such recommendations relating to\r\nlegislation in the public interest as they deem advisable. I ask for\r\nthese reports and recommendations the deliberate examination and action\r\nof the legislative branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nThere are other subjects not embraced in the departmental reports\r\ndemanding legislative consideration, and which I should be glad to\r\nsubmit. Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous\r\nmessages, and as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recommendations.\r\n\r\nAs the law makes no provision for any report from the Department of\r\nState, a brief history of the transactions of that important Department,\r\ntogether with other matters which it may hereafter be deemed essential\r\nto commend to the attention of the Congress, may furnish the occasion\r\nfor a future communication.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 14,

CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 17, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of March last an act was passed authorizing the\r\nappointment of three commissioners who should investigate the affairs of\r\nsuch railroads as have received aid from the United States Government.\r\nAmong other things, the contemplated investigation included a history of\r\nthe construction of these roads, their relations and indebtedness to the\r\nGovernment, and the question whether in the interest of the United\r\nStates any extension of the time for the performance of the obligations\r\nof said roads to the Government should be granted; and if so, the said\r\ncommissioners were directed to submit a scheme for such extension.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners were further directed by said act to report in full to\r\nthe President upon all the matters submitted to them, and he was by said\r\nact required to forward said report to Congress with such\r\nrecommendations or comments as he should see fit to make in the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners immediately after their selection entered upon the\r\ndischarge of their duties, and have prosecuted their inquiries with\r\ncommendable industry, intelligence, and thoroughness. A large amount of\r\ntestimony has been taken, and all the facts have been developed which\r\nappear to be necessary for the consideration of the questions arising\r\nfrom the condition of these aided railroads and their relations to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners have, however, been unable to agree upon the manner in\r\nwhich these railroads should be treated respecting their indebtedness to\r\nthe United States, or to unite upon the plan best calculated to secure\r\nthe payment of such indebtedness.\r\n\r\nThis disagreement has resulted in the preparation of two reports, both\r\nof which are herewith submitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nThese reports exhibit such transactions and schemes connected with the\r\nconstruction of the aided roads and their management, and suggest the\r\ninvention of such devices on the part of those having them in charge,\r\nfor the apparent purpose of defeating any chance for the Government's\r\nreimbursement, that any adjustment or plan of settlement should be\r\npredicated upon the substantial interests of the Government rather than\r\nany forbearance or generosity deserved by the companies.\r\n\r\nThe wide publication which has already been given to the substance of\r\nthe commissioners' reports obviates the necessity of detailing in this\r\ncommunication the facts found upon the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe majority report, while condemning the methods adopted by those who\r\nformerly had charge of the Union Pacific Railroad, declares that since\r\nits present management was inaugurated, in 1884, its affairs have been\r\nfairly and prudently conducted, and that the present administration \"has\r\ndevoted itself honestly and intelligently to the herculean task of\r\nrescuing the Union Pacific Railway from the insolvency which seriously\r\nthreatened it at the inception of its work;\" that it \"has devoted\r\nitself, by rigid economy, by intelligent management, and by an\r\napplication of every dollar of the earning capacity of the system to its\r\nimprovement and betterment, to place that company on a sound and\r\nenduring financial foundation.\"\r\n\r\nThe condition of the present management of the Union Pacific Company has\r\nan important bearing upon its ability to comply with the terms of any\r\nsettlement of its indebtedness which may be offered by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commission are in favor of an extension of the time\r\nfor the payment of the Government indebtedness of these companies, upon\r\ncertain conditions; but the chairman of the commission, presenting the\r\nminority report, recommends, both upon principle and policy, the\r\ninstitution of proceedings for the forfeiture of the charters of the\r\ncorporations and the winding up of their affairs.\r\n\r\nI have been furnished with a statement or argument in defense of the\r\ntransactions connected with the construction of the Central Pacific road\r\nand its branch lines, from which it may not be amiss to quote for the\r\npurpose of showing how some of the operations of the directors of such\r\nroad, strongly condemned by the commissioners, are defended by the\r\ndirectors themselves. After speaking of a contract for the construction\r\nof one of these branch lines by a corporation called the Contract and\r\nFinance Company, owned by certain directors of the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad, this language is used:\r\n\r\n  It may be said of this contract, as of many others that were let to the\r\n  different construction companies in which the directors of the Central\r\n  Pacific have been stockholders, that they built the road with the moneys\r\n  furnished by themselves and had the road for their outlay. In other\r\n  words, they paid to the construction company the bonds and stock of the\r\n  railroad so constructed, and waited until such time as they could\r\n  develop sufficient business on the road built to induce the public to\r\n  buy the bonds or the stock. If the country through which the railroad\r\n  ran developed sufficient business, then the project was a success; if it\r\n  did not, then the operation was a loss. These gentlemen took all the\r\n  responsibility; any loss occurring was necessarily theirs, and of right\r\n  the profit belonged to them.\r\n\r\n  But it is said that they violated a well-known rule of equity in dealing\r\n  with themselves; that they were trustees, and that they were\r\n  representing both sides of the contract.\r\n\r\n  The answer is that they did not find anybody else to deal with. They\r\n  could not find anyone who would take the chances of building a road\r\n  through what was then an almost uninhabited country and accept the bonds\r\n  and stock of the road, in payment. And when it is said that they were\r\n  trustees, if they did occupy such relation it was merely technical, for\r\n  they represented only their own interests on both sides, there being no\r\n  one else concerned in the transaction. They became the incorporators of\r\n  the company that was to build the road, subscribed for its stock, and\r\n  were the only subscribers; therefore it is difficult to see how anyone\r\n  was wronged by their action. The rule of equity invoked, which has its\r\n  origin in the injunction \"No man can serve two masters,\" certainly did\r\n  not apply to them, because they were acting in their own interests and\r\n  were not charged with the duty of caring for others' rights, there being\r\n  no other persons interested in the subject-matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of this statement and the facts developed in the commissioners'\r\nreports, it seems proper to recall the grants and benefits derived from\r\nthe General Government by both the Union and Central Pacific companies\r\nfor the purpose of aiding the construction of their roads.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed in 1862 it was provided that there should be advanced\r\nto said companies by the United States, to aid in such construction, the\r\nbonds of the Government amounting to $16,000 for every mile constructed,\r\nas often as a section of 40 miles of said roads should be built; that\r\nthere should also be granted to said companies, upon the completion of\r\nevery said section of 40 miles of road, five entire sections of public\r\nland for each mile so built; that the entire charges earned by said\r\nroads on account of transportation and service for the Government should\r\nbe applied to the reimbursement of the bonds advanced by the United\r\nStates and the interest thereon, and that to secure the repayment of\r\nthe bonds so advanced, and interest, the issue and delivery to said\r\ncompanies of said bonds should constitute a first mortgage on the whole\r\nline of their roads and on their rolling stock, fixtures, and property\r\nof every kind and description.\r\n\r\nThe liberal donations, advances, and privileges provided for in this law\r\nwere granted by the General Government for the purpose of securing the\r\nconstruction of these roads, which would complete the connection between\r\nour eastern and western coasts; and they were based upon a consideration\r\nof the public benefits which would accrue to the entire country from\r\nsuch consideration.\r\n\r\nBut the projectors of these roads were not content, and the sentiment\r\nwhich then seemed to pervade the Congress had not reached the limit\r\nof its generosity. Two years after the passage of this law it was\r\nsupplemented and amended in various important particulars in favor of\r\nthese companies by an act which provided, among other things, that the\r\nbonds, at the rate already specified, should be delivered upon the\r\ncompletion of sections of 20 miles in length instead of 40; that the\r\nlands to be conveyed to said companies on the completion of each section\r\nof said road should be ten sections per mile instead of five; that only\r\nhalf of the charges for transportation and service due from time to time\r\nfrom the United States should be retained and applied to the advances\r\nmade to said companies by the Government, thus obliging immediate\r\npayment to its debtor of the other half of said charges, and that the\r\nlien of the United States to secure the reimbursement of the amount\r\nadvanced to said companies in bonds, which lien was declared by the law\r\nof 1862 to constitute a first mortgage upon all the property of said\r\ncompanies, should become a junior lien and be subordinated to a mortgage\r\nwhich the companies were by the amendatory act authorized to execute\r\nto secure bonds which they might from time to time issue in sums not\r\nexceeding the amount of the United States bonds which should be advanced\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe immense advantages to the companies of this amendatory act are\r\napparent; and in these days we may well wonder that even the anticipated\r\npublic importance of the construction of these roads induced what must\r\nnow appear to be a rather reckless and unguarded appropriation of the\r\npublic funds and the public domain.\r\n\r\nUnder the operation of these laws the principal of the bonds which\r\nhave been advanced is $64,023,512, as given in the reports of the\r\ncommissioners; the interest to November 1, 1887, is calculated\r\nto be $76,024,206.58, making an aggregate at the date named of\r\n$140,047,718.58. The interest calculated to the maturity of the bonds\r\nadded to the principal produces an aggregate of $178,884,759.50.\r\nAgainst these amounts there has been repaid by the companies the sum\r\nof $30,955,039.61.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to state that the companies have availed\r\nthemselves to the utmost extent of the permission given them to issue\r\ntheir bonds and to mortgage their property to secure the payment of the\r\nsame, by an incumbrance having preference to the Government's lien and\r\nprecisely equal to it in amount.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there was available for the building of each mile\r\nof these roads $16,000 of United States bonds, due in thirty years, with\r\n6 per cent interest; $16,000 in bonds of the companies, secured by a\r\nfirst mortgage on all their property, and ten sections of Government\r\nland, to say nothing of the stock of the companies.\r\n\r\nWhen the relations created between the Government and these companies by\r\nthe legislation referred to is considered, it is astonishing that the\r\nclaim should be made that the directors of these roads owed no duty\r\nexcept to themselves in their construction; that they need regard no\r\ninterests but their own, and that they were justified in contracting\r\nwith themselves and making such bargains as resulted in conveying\r\nto their pockets all the assets of the companies. As a lienor the\r\nGovernment was vitally interested in the amount of the mortgage to which\r\nits security had been subordinated, and it had the right to insist that\r\nnone of the bonds secured by this prior mortgage should be issued\r\nfraudulently or for the purpose of division among these stockholders\r\nwithout consideration.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of complete independence on the part of the directors of\r\nthese companies and their freedom from any obligation to care for other\r\ninterests than their own in the construction of these roads seems to\r\nhave developed the natural consequences of its application, portrayed as\r\nfollows in the majority report of the commissioners:\r\n\r\n  The result is that those who have controlled and directed the\r\n  construction and development of these companies have become possessed\r\n  of their surplus assets through issues of bonds, stocks, and payment\r\n  of dividends voted by themselves, while the great creditor, the United\r\n  States, finds itself substantially without adequate security for the\r\n  repayment of its loans.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws enacted in aid of these roads, while they illustrated a profuse\r\nliberality and a generous surrender of the Government's advantages,\r\nwhich it is hoped experience has corrected, were nevertheless passed\r\nupon the theory that the roads should be constructed according to the\r\ncommon rules of business, fairness, and duty, and that their value and\r\ntheir ability to pay their debts should not be impaired by unfair\r\nmanipulations; and when the Government subordinated its lien to another\r\nit was in the expectation that the prior lien would represent in its\r\namount only such bonds as should be necessarily issued by the companies\r\nfor the construction of their roads at fair prices, agreed upon in an\r\nhonest way between real and substantial parties. For the purpose of\r\nsaving or improving the security afforded by its junior lien the\r\nGovernment should have the right now to purge this paramount lien of all\r\nthat is fraudulent, fictitious, or unconscionable. If the transfer to\r\ninnocent hands of bonds of this character secured by such first mortgage\r\nprevents their cancellation, it might be well to seek a remedy against\r\nthose who issued and transferred them. If legislation is needed to\r\nsecure such a remedy, the Congress can readily supply it.\r\n\r\nI desire to call attention also to the fact that if all that was to be\r\ndone on the part of the Government to fully vest in these companies the\r\ngrants and advantages contemplated by the acts passed in their interest\r\nhas not yet been perfected, and if the failure of such companies to\r\nperform in good faith their part of the contract justifies such a\r\ncourse, the power rests with the Congress to withhold further\r\nperformance on the part of the Government. If donated lands are not yet\r\ngranted to these companies, and if their violation of contract and of\r\nduty are such as in justice and morals forfeit their rights to such\r\nlands, Congressional action should intervene to prevent further\r\nconsummation. Executive power must be exercised according to existing\r\nlaws, and Executive discretion is probably not broad enough to reach\r\nsuch difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe California and Oregon Railroad is now a part of the Central Pacific\r\nsystem, and is a land-grant road. Its construction has been carried on\r\nwith the same features and incidents which have characterized the other\r\nconstructions of this system, as is made apparent on pages 78, 79, and\r\n80 of the report of the majority of the commissioners. I have in my\r\nhands for approval the report of the commissioners appointed to examine\r\ntwo completed sections of this road. Upon such approval the company or\r\nthe Central Pacific Company will be entitled to patents for a large\r\nquantity of public lands. I especially commend to the attention of\r\nCongress this condition of affairs, in order that it may determine\r\nwhether or not it should intervene to save these lands for settlers,\r\nif such a course is justifiable.\r\n\r\nIt is quite time that the troublesome complications surrounding this\r\nentire subject, which has been transmitted to us as a legacy from former\r\ndays, should be adjusted and settled.\r\n\r\nNo one, I think, expects that these railroad companies will be able to\r\npay their immense indebtedness to the Government at its maturity.\r\n\r\nAny proceeding or arrangement that would result now, or at any other\r\ntime, in putting these roads, or any portion of them, in the possession\r\nand control of the Government is, in my opinion, to be rejected,\r\ncertainly as long as there is the least chance for indemnification\r\nthrough any other means.\r\n\r\nI suppose we are hardly justified in indulging the irritation and\r\nindignation naturally arising from a contemplation of malfeasance to\r\nsuch an extent as to lead to the useless destruction of these roads or\r\nloss of the advances made by the Government. I believe that our efforts\r\nshould be in a more practical direction, and should tend, with no\r\ncondonation of wrongdoing, to the collection by the Government, on\r\nbehalf of the people, of the public money now in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nWhile the plan presented by a majority of the commission appears to be\r\nwell devised and gives at least partial promise of the results sought,\r\nthe fact will not escape attention that its success depends upon its\r\nacceptance by the companies and their ability to perform its conditions\r\nafter acceptance. It is exceedingly important that any adjustment now\r\nmade should be final and effective. These considerations suggest the\r\npossibility that the remedy proposed in the majority report might well\r\nbe applied to a part only of these aided railroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe settlement and determination of the questions involved are\r\npeculiarly within the province of the Congress. The subject has been\r\nmade quite a familiar one by Congressional discussion. This is now\r\nsupplemented in a valuable manner by the facts presented in the reports\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nThe public interest urges prompt and efficient action.\r\n\r\nGROVER

my annual message transmitted to the Congress in December, 1886, it\r\nwas stated that negotiations were then pending for the settlement of the\r\nquestions growing out of the rights claimed by American fishermen in\r\nBritish North American waters.\r\n\r\nAs a result of such negotiations a treaty has been agreed upon between\r\nHer Britannic Majesty and the United States, concluded and signed in\r\nthis capital, under my direction and authority, on the 15th of February\r\ninstant, and which I now have the honor to submit to the Senate with the\r\nrecommendation that it shall receive the consent of that body, as\r\nprovided in the Constitution, in order that the ratifications thereof\r\nmay be duly exchanged and the treaty be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nShortly after Congress had adjourned in March last, and in continuation\r\nof my efforts to arrive at such an agreement between the Governments of\r\nGreat Britain and the United States as would secure to the citizens of\r\nthe respective countries the unmolested enjoyment of their just rights\r\nunder existing treaties and international comity in the territorial\r\nwaters of Canada and of Newfoundland, I availed myself of opportune\r\noccurrences indicative of a desire to make without delay an amicable and\r\nfinal settlement of a long-standing controversy, productive of much\r\nirritation and misunderstanding between the two nations, to send through\r\nour minister in London proposals that a conference should take place on\r\nthe subject at this capital.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the past two years had demonstrated the dilatory and\r\nunsatisfactory consequences of our indirect transaction of business\r\nthrough the foreign office in London, in which the views and wishes of\r\nthe government of the Dominion of Canada were practically predominant,\r\nbut were only to find expression at second hand.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this inconvenience and obstruction to prompt and well-defined\r\nsettlement, it was considered advisable that the negotiations should be\r\nconducted in this city and that the interests of Canada and Newfoundland\r\nshould be directly represented therein.\r\n\r\nThe terms of reference having been duly agreed upon between the two\r\nGovernments and the conference arranged to be held here, by virtue of\r\nthe power in me vested by the Constitution I duly authorized Thomas F.\r\nBayard, the Secretary of State of the United States, William L. Putnam,\r\na citizen of the State of Maine, and James B. Angell, a citizen of the\r\nState of Michigan, for and in the name of the United States, to meet and\r\nconfer with the plenipotentiaries representing the Government of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty, for the purpose of considering and adjusting in a\r\nfriendly spirit all or any questions relating to rights of fishery in\r\nthe seas adjacent to British North America and Newfoundland which were\r\nin dispute between the Government of the United States and that of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty, and jointly and severally to conclude and sign any\r\ntreaty or treaties touching the premises; and I herewith transmit for\r\nyour information full copies of the power so given by me.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the powers so conveyed the said Thomas F. Bayard,\r\nWilliam L. Putnam, and James B. Angell, in the month of November last,\r\nmet in this city the plenipotentiaries of Her Britannic Majesty and\r\nproceeded in the negotiation of a treaty as above authorized. After many\r\nconferences and protracted efforts an agreement has at length been\r\narrived at, which is embodied in the treaty which I now lay before you.\r\n\r\nThe treaty meets my approval, because I believe that it supplies a\r\nsatisfactory, practical, and final adjustment, upon a basis honorable\r\nand just to both parties, of the difficult and vexed question to which\r\nit relates.\r\n\r\nA review of the history of this question will show that all former\r\nattempts to arrive at a common interpretation, satisfactory to both\r\nparties, of the first article of the treaty of October 20, 1818, have\r\nbeen unsuccessful, and with the lapse of time the difficulty and\r\nobscurity have only increased.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations in 1854 and again in 1871 ended in both cases in\r\ntemporary reciprocal arrangements of the tariffs of Canada and\r\nNewfoundland and of the United States, and the payment of a money award\r\nby the United States, under which the real questions in difference\r\nremained unsettled, in abeyance, and ready to present themselves anew\r\njust so soon as the conventional arrangements were abrogated.\r\n\r\nThe situation, therefore, remained unimproved by the results of the\r\ntreaty of 1871, and a grave condition of affairs, presenting almost\r\nidentically the same features and causes of complaint by the United\r\nStates against Canadian action and British default in its correction,\r\nconfronted us in May, 1886, and has continued until the present time.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the correspondence which has taken place between the\r\ntwo Governments has heretofore been communicated to Congress, and at as\r\nearly a day as possible I shall transmit the remaining portion to this\r\ndate, accompanying it with the joint protocols of the conferences which\r\nresulted in the conclusion of the treaty now submitted to you.\r\n\r\nYou will thus be fully possessed of the record and history of the case\r\nsince the termination on June 30, 1885, of the fishery articles of the\r\ntreaty of Washington of 1871, whereby we were relegated to the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of October 20, 1818.\r\n\r\nAs the documents and papers referred to will supply full information of\r\nthe positions taken under my Administration by the representatives of\r\nthe United States, as well as those occupied by the representatives of\r\nthe Government of Great Britain, it is not considered necessary or\r\nexpedient to repeat them in this message. But I believe the treaty will\r\nbe found to contain a just, honorable, and therefore satisfactory\r\nsolution of the difficulties which have clouded our relations with our\r\nneighbors on our northern border.\r\n\r\nEspecially satisfactory do I believe the proposed arrangement will be\r\nfound by those of our citizens who are engaged in the open-sea fisheries\r\nadjacent to the Canadian coast, and resorting to those ports and harbors\r\nunder treaty provisions and rules of international law.\r\n\r\nThe proposed delimitation of the lines of the exclusive fisheries from\r\nthe common fisheries will give certainty and security as to the area\r\nof their legitimate field. The headland theory of imaginary lines is\r\nabandoned by Great Britain, and the specification in the treaty of\r\ncertain named bays especially provided for gives satisfaction to the\r\ninhabitants of the shores, without subtracting materially from the value\r\nor convenience of the fishery rights of Americans.\r\n\r\nThe uninterrupted navigation of the Strait of Canso is expressly and for\r\nthe first time affirmed, and the four purposes for which our fishermen\r\nunder the treaty of 1818 were allowed to enter the bays and harbors of\r\nCanada and Newfoundland within the belt of 3 marine miles are placed\r\nunder a fair and liberal construction, and their enjoyment secured\r\nwithout such conditions and restrictions as in the past have embarrassed\r\nand obstructed them so seriously.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of penalties for unlawfully fishing or preparing to fish\r\nwithin the inshore and exclusive waters of Canada and Newfoundland is to\r\nbe accomplished under safeguards against oppressive or arbitrary action,\r\nthus protecting the defendant fishermen from punishment in advance of\r\ntrial, delays, and inconvenience and unnecessary expense.\r\n\r\nThe history of events in the last two years shows that no feature of\r\nCanadian administration was more harassing and injurious than the\r\ncompulsion upon our fishing vessels to make formal entry and clearance\r\non every occasion of temporarily seeking shelter in Canadian ports and\r\nharbors.\r\n\r\nSuch inconvenience is provided against in the proposed treaty, and this\r\nmost frequent and just cause of complaint is removed.\r\n\r\nThe articles permitting our fishermen to obtain provisions and the\r\nordinary supplies of trading vessels on their homeward voyages, and\r\nunder which they are accorded the further and even more important\r\nprivilege on all occasions of purchasing such casual or needful\r\nprovisions and supplies as are ordinarily granted to trading vessels,\r\nare of great importance and value.\r\n\r\nThe licenses, which are to be granted without charge and on application,\r\nin order to enable our fishermen to enjoy these privileges, are\r\nreasonable and proper checks in the hands of the local authorities to\r\nidentify the recipients and prevent abuse, and can form no impediment to\r\nthose who intend to use them fairly.\r\n\r\nThe hospitality secured for our vessels in all cases of actual distress,\r\nwith liberty to unload and sell and transship their cargoes, is full and\r\nliberal.\r\n\r\nThese provisions will secure the substantial enjoyment of the treaty\r\nrights for our fishermen under the treaty of 1818, for which contention\r\nhas been steadily made in the correspondence of the Department of State\r\nand our minister at London and by the American negotiators of the\r\npresent treaty.\r\n\r\nThe right of our fishermen under the treaty of 1818 did not extend to\r\nthe procurement of distinctive fishery supplies in Canadian ports and\r\nharbors, and one item supposed to be essential--to wit, bait--was\r\nplainly denied them by the explicit and definite words of the treaty of\r\n1818, emphasized by the course of the negotiation and express decisions\r\nwhich preceded the conclusion of that treaty.\r\n\r\nThe treaty now submitted contains no provision affecting tariff duties,\r\nand, independently of the position assumed upon the part of the United\r\nStates that no alteration in our tariff or other domestic legislation\r\ncould be made as the price or consideration of obtaining the rights of\r\nour citizens secured by treaty, it was considered more expedient to\r\nallow any change in the revenue laws of the United States to be made by\r\nthe ordinary exercise of legislative will and in the promotion of the\r\npublic interests. Therefore the addition to the free list of fish, fish\r\noil, whale and seal oil, etc., recited in the last article of the\r\ntreaty, is wholly left to the action of Congress; and in connection\r\ntherewith the Canadian and Newfoundland right to regulate sales of bait\r\nand other fishing supplies within their own jurisdiction is recognized,\r\nand the right of our fishermen to freely purchase these things is made\r\ncontingent by this treaty upon the action of Congress in the\r\nmodification of our tariff laws.\r\n\r\nOur social and commercial intercourse with those populations who have\r\nbeen placed upon our borders and made forever our neighbors is made\r\napparent by a list of United States common carriers, marine and inland,\r\nconnecting their lines with Canada, which was returned by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to the Senate on the 7th day of February, 1888, in\r\nanswer to a resolution of that body; and this is instructive as to the\r\ngreat volume of mutually profitable interchanges which has come into\r\nexistence during the last half century.\r\n\r\nThis intercourse is still but partially developed, and if the amicable\r\nenterprise and wholesome rivalry between the two populations be not\r\nobstructed the promise of the future is full of the fruits of an\r\nunbounded prosperity on both sides of the border.\r\n\r\nThe treaty now submitted to you has been framed in a spirit of liberal\r\nequity and reciprocal benefits, in the conviction that mutual advantage\r\nand convenience are the only permanent foundation of peace and\r\nfriendship between States, and that with the adoption of the agreement\r\nnow placed before the Senate a beneficial and satisfactory intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries will be established so as to secure perpetual\r\npeace and harmony.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the treaty herewith submitted I deem it also my duty\r\nto transmit to the Senate a written offer or arrangement, in the nature\r\nof a _modus vivendi_, tendered after the conclusion of the treaty\r\non the part of the British plenipotentiaries, to secure kindly and\r\npeaceful relations during the period that may be required for the\r\nconsideration of the treaty by the respective Governments and for the\r\nenactment of the necessary legislation to carry its provisions into\r\neffect if approved.\r\n\r\nThis paper, freely and on their own motion signed by the British\r\nconferees, not only extends advantages to our fishermen pending the\r\nratification of the treaty, but appears to have been dictated by a\r\nfriendly and amicable spirit.\r\n\r\nI am given to understand that the other Governments concerned in this\r\ntreaty will within a few days, in accordance with their methods of\r\nconducting public business, submit said treaty to their respective\r\nlegislatures, when it will be at once published to the world. In view of\r\nsuch action it appears to be advisable that by publication here early\r\nand full knowledge of all that has been done in the premises should be\r\nafforded to our people.\r\n\r\nIt would also seem to be useful to inform the popular mind concerning\r\nthe history of the long-continued disputes growing out of the subject\r\nembraced in the treaty and to satisfy the public interests touching the\r\nsame, as well as to acquaint our people with the present status of the\r\nquestions involved, and to give them the exact terms of the proposed\r\nadjustment, in place of the exaggerated and imaginative statements which\r\nwill otherwise reach them.\r\n\r\nI therefore beg leave respectfully to suggest that said treaty and all\r\nsuch correspondence, messages, and documents relating to the same as may\r\nbe deemed important to accomplish those purposes be at once made public\r\nby the order of your honorable body.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE

and consideration of Congress,\r\na report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying correspondence,\r\ntouching the action of the Government of Venezuela in conveying to that\r\ncountry for interment the remains of the distinguished Venezuelan\r\nsoldier and statesman, General Jose Antonio Paez, and take pleasure in\r\nexpressing my concurrence in the suggestion therein referred to, that\r\nthe employment of a national vessel of war for the transportation of\r\nGeneral Paez's remains from New York to La Guayra be authorized and\r\nprovided for by Congress.\r\n\r\nGROVER

an\r\ninvitation which the Royal Bavarian Government has extended to this\r\nGovernment to participate in the Third International Exhibition of the\r\nFine Arts, which is to be held at Munich, Bavaria, during the present\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a

with its\r\ninclosures, in response to the resolution of the Senate of the 21st of\r\nDecember, 1887, and the 16th of January, 1888, touching the awards of\r\nthe late Mexican Claims Commission, and especially those in favor of\r\nBenjamin Weil and La Abra Silver Mining Company.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the report concludes with a suggestion that these\r\nclaims be referred to the Court of

referred to and make\r\nthe direction contemplated by the act of 1878, in default of which the\r\nmoney now on hand applicable to such awards now remains undistributed.\r\n\r\nGROVER

the immigration of Chinese laborers\r\n  to the United States under the limitations of our treaties with China,\r\n  the President of the United States be requested to negotiate a treaty\r\n  with the Emperor of China containing a provision that no Chinese laborer\r\n  shall enter the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject referred to in this resolution has by no\r\nmeans been overlooked by the executive branch of the Government, charged\r\nunder the Constitution with the formulation of treaties with foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nNegotiation with the Emperor of China for a treaty such as is mentioned\r\nin said resolution was commenced many months ago and has been since\r\ncontinued. The progress of the negotiation thus inaugurated has\r\nheretofore been freely communicated to such members of the Senate and of\r\nits Committee on Foreign Relations as sought information concerning the\r\nsame. It is, however, with much gratification that I deem myself now\r\njustified in expressing to the Senate, in response to its resolution,\r\nthe hope and expectation that a treaty will soon be concluded concerning\r\nthe immigration of Chinese laborers which will meet the wants of our\r\npeople and the approbation of the body to which it will be submitted for\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 12, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, with a view to its ratification, a treaty between\r\nthe United States of America and Zanzibar, concluded July 3, 1886,\r\nenlarging and defining the stipulations of the treaty of September 21,\r\n1833, between the United States of America and His Majesty Seyed Syed\r\nbin Sultan of Muscat and Sovereign of Zanzibar, which treaty has\r\ncontinued in force as to Zanzibar and its dependencies after the\r\nseparation of Zanzibar from Muscat, and has been accepted, ratified,\r\nand confirmed by the Sultan of Zanzibar on October 20, 1879.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith and recommend for your\r\nconstitutional approval a convention signed and concluded in this city\r\non the 12th instant, under my direction, between the United States and\r\nChina, for the exclusion hereafter of Chinese laborers from coming into\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThis treaty is accompanied by a letter from the Secretary of State in\r\nrecital of its provisions and explanatory of the reasons for its\r\nnegotiation, and with it are transmitted sundry documents giving the\r\nhistory of events connected with the presence and treatment of Chinese\r\nsubjects in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn view of the public interest which has for a long time been manifested\r\nin relation to the question of Chinese immigration, it would seem\r\nadvisable that the full text of this treaty should be made public, and I\r\nrespectfully recommend that an order to that effect be made by your\r\nhonorable body.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, in compliance with the resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe 16th ultimo, a report from the Secretary of State, accompanied by\r\ncertain correspondence in regard to the Mexican _zona libre_.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 20, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication of the 13th instant from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, with accompanying papers, and submitting the\r\ndraft of a proposed bill to forfeit lands granted to the State of Oregon\r\nfor the construction of certain wagon roads, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of facts by the Secretary of the Interior herewith\r\ntransmitted is the result of an examination made under his direction,\r\nwhich has developed, as it seems to me, the most unblushing frauds upon\r\nthe Government, which, if remaining unchallenged, will divert several\r\nhundred thousand acres of land from the public domain and from the reach\r\nof honest settlers to those who have attempted to prevent and prostitute\r\nthe beneficent designs of the Government. The Government sought by the\r\npromise of generous donations of land to promote the building of wagon\r\nroads for public convenience and for the purpose of encouraging\r\nsettlement upon the public lands. The roads have not been built, and yet\r\nan attempt is made to claim the lands under a title which depends for\r\nits validity entirely upon the construction of these roads.\r\n\r\nThe evidence which has been collected by the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nplainly establishing this attempt to defraud the Government and exclude\r\nthe settlers who are willing to avail themselves of the liberal policy\r\nadopted for the settlement of the public lands, is herewith submitted\r\nto the Congress, with the recommendation that the bill which has been\r\nprepared, and which is herewith transmitted, may become a law, and with\r\nthe earnest hope that the opportunity thus presented to demonstrate a\r\nsincere desire to preserve the public domain for settlers and to\r\nfrustrate unlawful attempts to appropriate the same may not be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your advice and consent to the ratification\r\nthereof, a convention between the United States and Venezuela, signed\r\nthe 15th instant, supplementary to the convention between the same\r\npowers for the settlement of claims signed December 5, 1885.\r\n\r\nI transmit also a report of the Secretary of State thereon and copies of\r\ncorrespondence had with the diplomatic representative of Venezuela at\r\nthis capital in relation thereto.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution adopted by your honorable body on the 16th\r\ninstant, as follows--\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested,\r\n  if in his judgment not incompatible with the public interest, to\r\n  transmit to the Senate copies of the minutes and daily protocols of\r\n  the meetings of the commissioners who negotiated the treaty with Great\r\n  Britain submitted by the President to the Senate on the 20th of\r\n  February, 1888--\r\n\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, which I hope will\r\nsatisfactorily meet the request for information embraced in said\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 27, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from Hon.

Of\r\nthose who passed the examination 2,977 were applicants for admission\r\nto the departmental service at Washington, 2,547 were examined for\r\nadmission to the customs service, and 5,222 for admission to the postal\r\nservice. During the same period 547 appointments were made from the\r\neligible lists to the departmental service, 641 to the customs service,\r\nand 3,254 to the postal service.\r\n\r\nConcerning separations from the classified service, the report only\r\ninforms us of such as have occurred among employees in the public\r\nservice who had been appointed from eligible lists under civil-service\r\nrules. When these rules took effect, they did not apply to the persons\r\nthen in the service, comprising a full complement of employees, who\r\nobtained their positions independently of the new law. The Commission\r\nhas no record of the separations in this numerous class. And the\r\ndiscrepancy apparent in the report between the number of appointments\r\nmade in the respective branches of the service from the lists of the\r\nCommission and the small number of separations mentioned is to a great\r\nextent accounted for by vacancies, of which no report was made to the\r\nCommission, occurring among those who held their places without\r\nexamination and certification, which vacancies were filled by\r\nappointment from the eligible lists.\r\n\r\nIn the departmental service there occurred between the 16th day of\r\nJanuary, 1886, and the 30th day of June, 1887, among the employees\r\nappointed from the eligible lists under civil-service rules, 17\r\nremovals, 36 resignations, and 5 deaths. This does not include 14\r\nseparations in the grade of special pension examiners--4 by removal,\r\n5 by resignation, and 5 by death.\r\n\r\nIn the classified customs and postal services the number of separations\r\namong those who received absolute appointments under civil-service rules\r\nis given for the period between the 1st day of January, 1886, and the\r\n30th day of June, 1887. It appears that such separations in the customs\r\nservice for the time mentioned embraced 21 removals, 5 deaths, and 18\r\nresignations, and in the postal service 256 removals, 23 deaths, and 469\r\nresignations.\r\n\r\nMore than a year has passed since the expiration of the period covered\r\nby the report of the Commission. Within the time which has thus elapsed\r\nmany important changes have taken place in furtherance of a reform in\r\nour civil service. The rules and regulations governing the execution of\r\nthe law upon the subject have been completely remodeled in such manner\r\nas to render the enforcement of the statute more effective and greatly\r\nincrease its usefulness.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, the scope of the examinations prescribed for those\r\nwho seek to enter the classified service has been better defined and\r\nmade more practical, the number of names to be certified from the\r\neligible lists to the appointing officers from which a selection is made\r\nhas been reduced from four to three, the maximum limitation of the age\r\nof persons seeking entrance to the classified service to 45 years has\r\nbeen changed, and reasonable provision has been made for the transfer\r\nof employees from one Department to another in proper cases. A plan\r\nhas also been devised providing for the examination of applicants for\r\npromotion in the service, which, when in full operation, will eliminate\r\nall chance of favoritism in the advancement of employees, by making\r\npromotion a reward of merit and faithful discharge of duty.\r\n\r\nUntil within a few weeks there was no uniform classification of\r\nemployees in the different Executive Departments of the Government. As a\r\nresult of this condition, in some of the Departments positions could be\r\nobtained without civil-service examination, because they were not within\r\nthe classification of such Department, while in other Departments an\r\nexamination and certification were necessary to obtain positions of the\r\nsame grade, because such positions were embraced in the classifications\r\napplicable to those Departments.\r\n\r\nThe exception of laborers, watchmen, and messengers from examination and\r\nclassification gave opportunity, in the absence of any rule guarding\r\nagainst it, for the employment, free from civil-service restrictions, of\r\npersons under these designations, who were immediately detailed to do\r\nclerical work.\r\n\r\nAll this has been obviated by the application to all the Departments of\r\nan extended and uniform classification embracing grades of employees not\r\ntheretofore included, and by the adoption of a rule prohibiting the\r\ndetail of laborers, watchmen, or messengers to clerical duty.\r\n\r\nThe path of civil-service reform has not at all times been pleasant nor\r\neasy. The scope and purpose of the reform have been much misapprehended;\r\nand this has not only given rise to strong opposition, but has led to\r\nits invocation by its friends to compass objects not in the least\r\nrelated to it. Thus partisans of the patronage system have naturally\r\ncondemned it. Those who do not understand its meaning either mistrust it\r\nor, when disappointed because in its present stage it is not applied to\r\nevery real or imaginary ill, accuse those charged with its enforcement\r\nwith faithlessness to civil-service reform. Its importance has\r\nfrequently been underestimated, and the support of good men has thus\r\nbeen lost by their lack of interest in its success. Besides all these\r\ndifficulties, those responsible for the administration of the Government\r\nin its executive branches have been and still are often annoyed and\r\nirritated by the disloyalty to the service and the insolence of\r\nemployees who remain in place as the beneficiaries and the relics and\r\nreminders of the vicious system of appointment which civil-service\r\nreform was intended to displace.\r\n\r\nAnd yet these are but the incidents of an advance movement which is\r\nradical and far-reaching. The people are, notwithstanding, to be\r\ncongratulated upon the progress which has been made and upon the firm,\r\npractical, and sensible foundation upon which this reform now rests.\r\n\r\nWith a continuation of the intelligent fidelity which has hitherto\r\ncharacterized the work of the Commission; with a continuation and\r\nincrease of the favor and liberality which have lately been evinced by\r\nthe Congress in the proper equipment of the Commission for its work;\r\nwith a firm but conservative and reasonable support of the reform by\r\nall its friends, and with the disappearance of opposition which must\r\ninevitably follow its better understanding, the execution of the\r\ncivil-service law can not fail to ultimately answer the hopes in which\r\nit had its origin.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 26, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to a resolution of the Senate of 11th\r\nApril last, a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ncorrespondence, relating to the pending dispute between the Government\r\nof Venezuela and the Government of Great Britain concerning the\r\nboundaries between British Guiana and Venezuela.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 6, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt becomes my painful duty to announce to the Congress and to the people\r\nof the United States the death of Philip H. Sheridan, General of the\r\nArmy, which occurred at a late hour last night at his summer home in the\r\nState of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe death of this valiant soldier and patriotic son of the Republic,\r\nthough his long illness has been regarded with anxiety, has nevertheless\r\nshocked the country and caused universal grief.\r\n\r\nHe had established for himself a stronghold in the hearts of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, who soon caught the true meaning and purpose of his\r\nsoldierly devotion and heroic temper.\r\n\r\nHis intrepid courage, his steadfast patriotism, and the generosity of\r\nhis nature inspired with peculiar warmth the admiration of all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAbove his grave affection for the man and pride in his achievements will\r\nstruggle for mastery, and too much honor can not be accorded to one who\r\nwas so richly endowed with all the qualities which make his death a\r\nnational loss.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 3d instant (the\r\nHouse of Representatives concurring), I return herewith the enrolled\r\nbill (S. 3303) amendatory of \"An act relating to postal crimes and\r\namendatory of the statutes therein mentioned,\" approved June 18, 1888.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 10, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanied by a report of the delegate on the part of the United States\r\nto the Fourth International Conference of the Red Cross Association,\r\nheld at Carlsruhe, in the Grand Duchy of Baden, in September last.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 23, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nThe rejection by the Senate of the treaty lately negotiated for the\r\nsettlement and adjustment of the differences existing between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain concerning the rights and privileges of\r\nAmerican fishermen in the ports and waters of British North America\r\nseems to justify a survey of the condition to which the pending question\r\nis thus remitted.\r\n\r\nThe treaty upon this subject concluded in 1818, through disagreements as\r\nto the meaning of its terms, has been a fruitful source of irritation\r\nand trouble. Our citizens engaged in fishing enterprises in waters\r\nadjacent to Canada have been subjected to numerous vexatious\r\ninterferences and annoyances; their vessels have been seized upon\r\npretexts which appeared to be entirely inadmissible, and they have been\r\notherwise treated by the Canadian authorities and officials in a manner\r\ninexcusably harsh and oppressive.\r\n\r\nThis conduct has been justified by Great Britain and Canada by the claim\r\nthat the treaty of 1818 permitted it and upon the ground that it was\r\nnecessary to the proper protection of Canadian interests. We deny that\r\ntreaty agreements justify these acts, and we further maintain that aside\r\nfrom any treaty restraints of disputed interpretation the relative\r\npositions of the United States and Canada as near neighbors, the growth\r\nof our joint commerce, the development and prosperity of both countries,\r\nwhich amicable relations surely guarantee, and, above all, the\r\nliberality always extended by the United States to the people of Canada\r\nfurnished motives for kindness and consideration higher and better than\r\ntreaty covenants.\r\n\r\nWhile keenly sensitive to all that was exasperating in the condition and\r\nby no means indisposed to support the just complaints of our injured\r\ncitizens, I still deemed it my duty, for the preservation of important\r\nAmerican interests which were directly involved, and in view of all the\r\ndetails of the situation, to attempt by negotiation to remedy existing\r\nwrongs and to finally terminate by a fair and just treaty these\r\never-recurring causes of difficulty.\r\n\r\nI fully believe that the treaty just rejected by the Senate was well\r\nsuited to the exigency, and that its provisions were adequate for our\r\nsecurity in the future from vexatious incidents and for the promotion of\r\nfriendly neighborhood and intimacy, without sacrificing in the least our\r\nnational pride or dignity.\r\n\r\nI am quite conscious that neither my opinion of the value of the\r\nrejected treaty nor the motives which prompted its negotiation are of\r\nimportance in the light of the judgment of the Senate thereupon. But it\r\nis of importance to note that this treaty has been rejected without any\r\napparent disposition on the part of the Senate to alter or amend its\r\nprovisions, and with the evident intention, not wanting expression, that\r\nno negotiation should at present be concluded touching the matter at\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nThe cooperation necessary for the adjustment of the long-standing\r\nnational differences with which we have to deal by methods of conference\r\nand agreement having thus been declined, I am by no means disposed to\r\nabandon the interests and the rights of our people in the premises or to\r\nneglect their grievances; and I therefore turn to the contemplation of a\r\nplan of retaliation as a mode which still remains of treating the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nI am not unmindful of the gravity of the responsibility assumed in\r\nadopting this line of conduct, nor do I fail in the least to appreciate\r\nits serious consequences. It will be impossible to injure our Canadian\r\nneighbors by retaliatory measures without inflicting some damage upon\r\nour own citizens. This results from our proximity, our community of\r\ninterests, and the inevitable commingling of the business enterprises\r\nwhich have been developed by mutual activity.\r\n\r\nPlainly stated, the policy of national retaliation manifestly embraces\r\nthe infliction of the greatest harm upon those who have injured us,\r\nwith the least possible damage to ourselves. There is also an evident\r\npropriety, as well as an invitation to moral support, found in visiting\r\nupon the offending party the same measure or kind of treatment of which\r\nwe complain, and as far as possible within the same lines. And above all\r\nthings, the plan of retaliation, if entered upon, should be thorough and\r\nvigorous.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead me at this time to invoke the aid and counsel\r\nof the Congress and its support in such a further grant of power as\r\nseems to me necessary and desirable to render effective the policy I\r\nhave indicated.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has already passed a law, which received Executive assent\r\non the 3d day of March, 1887, providing that in case American fishing\r\nvessels, being or visiting in the waters or at any of the ports of\r\nthe British dominions of North America, should be or lately had been\r\ndeprived of the rights to which they were entitled by treaty or law, or\r\nif they were denied certain other privileges therein specified or vexed\r\nand harassed in the enjoyment of the same, the President might deny to\r\nvessels and their masters and crews of the British dominions of North\r\nAmerica any entrance into the waters, ports, or harbors of the United\r\nStates, and also deny entry into any port or place of the United States\r\nof any product of said dominions or other goods coming from said\r\ndominions to the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile I shall not hesitate upon proper occasion to enforce this act,\r\nit would seem to be unnecessary to suggest that if such enforcement is\r\nlimited in such a manner as shall result in the least possible injury to\r\nour own people the effect would probably be entirely inadequate to the\r\naccomplishment of the purpose desired.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty, therefore, to call the attention of the Congress to\r\ncertain particulars in the action of the authorities of the Dominion\r\nof Canada, in addition to the general allegations already made, which\r\nappear to be in such marked contrast to the liberal and friendly\r\ndisposition of our country as in my opinion to call for such legislation\r\nas will, upon the principles already stated, properly supplement the\r\npower to inaugurate retaliation already vested in the Executive.\r\n\r\nActuated by the generous and neighborly spirit which has characterized\r\nour legislation, our tariff laws have since 1866 been so far waived\r\nin favor of Canada as to allow free of duty the transit across the\r\nterritory of the United States of property arriving at our ports and\r\ndestined to Canada, or exported from Canada to other foreign countries.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty of Washington was negotiated, in 1871, between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain, having for its object very largely the\r\nmodification of the treaty of 1818, the privileges above referred to\r\nwere made reciprocal and given in return by Canada to the United States\r\nin the following language, contained in the twenty-ninth article of said\r\ntreaty:\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that for the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII of\r\n  this treaty goods, wares, or merchandise arriving at the ports of New\r\n  York, Boston, and Portland, and any other ports in the United States\r\n  which have been or may from time to time be specially designated by the\r\n  President of the United States, and destined for Her Britannic Majesty's\r\n  possessions in North America, may be entered at the proper custom-house\r\n  and conveyed in transit, without the payment of duties, through the\r\n  territory of the United States, under such rules, regulations, and\r\n  conditions for the protection of the revenue as the Government of the\r\n  United States may from time to time prescribe; and, under like rules,\r\n  regulations, and conditions, goods, wares, or merchandise may be\r\n  conveyed in transit, without the payment of duties, from such\r\n  possessions through the territory of the United States, for export from\r\n  the said ports of the United States.\r\n\r\n  It is further agreed that for the like period goods, wares, or\r\n  merchandise arriving at any of the ports of Her Britannic Majesty's\r\n  possessions in North America, and destined for the United States, may\r\n  be entered at the proper custom-house and conveyed in transit, without\r\n  the payment of duties, through the said possessions, under such rules\r\n  and regulations and conditions for the protection of the revenue as the\r\n  governments of the said possessions may from time to time prescribe;\r\n  and, under like rules, regulations, and conditions, goods, wares, or\r\n  merchandise may be conveyed in transit, without payment of duties, from\r\n  the United States through the said possessions to other places in the\r\n  United States, or for export from ports in the said possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1886 notice was received by the representatives of our\r\nGovernment that our fishermen would no longer be allowed to ship their\r\nfish in bond and free of duty through Canadian territory to this\r\ncountry, and ever since that time such shipment has been denied.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of such shipment, which had been extended to our\r\nfishermen, was a most important one, allowing them to spend the time\r\nupon the fishing grounds which would otherwise be devoted to a voyage\r\nhome with their catch, and doubling their opportunities for profitably\r\nprosecuting their vocation.\r\n\r\nIn forbidding the transit of the catch of our fishermen over their\r\nterritory in bond and free of duty the Canadian authorities deprived us\r\nof the only facility dependent upon their concession and for which we\r\ncould supply no substitute.\r\n\r\nThe value to the Dominion of Canada of the privilege of transit for\r\ntheir exports and imports across our territory and to and from our\r\nports, though great in every aspect, will be better appreciated when\r\nit is remembered that for a considerable portion of each year the St.\r\nLawrence River, which constitutes the direct avenue of foreign commerce\r\nleading to Canada, is closed by ice.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six years the imports and exports of British Canadian\r\nProvinces carried across our territory under the privileges granted by\r\nour laws amounted in value to about $270,000,000, nearly all of which\r\nwere goods dutiable under our tariff laws, by far the larger part of\r\nthis traffic consisting of exchanges of goods between Great Britain and\r\nher American Provinces brought to and carried from our ports in their\r\nown vessels.\r\n\r\nThe treaty stipulation entered into by our Government was in harmony\r\nwith laws which were then on our statute book and are still in force.\r\n\r\nI recommend immediate legislative action conferring upon the Executive\r\nthe power to suspend by proclamation the operation of all laws and\r\nregulations permitting the transit of goods, wares, and merchandise in\r\nbond across or over the territory of the United States to or from\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThere need be no hesitation in suspending these laws arising from the\r\nsupposition that their continuation is secured by treaty obligations,\r\nfor it seems quite plain that Article XXIX of the treaty of 1871, which\r\nwas the only article incorporating such laws, terminated the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe article itself declares that its provisions shall be in force \"for\r\nthe term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII of this treaty.\" Turning\r\nto Article XXXIII, we find no mention of the twenty-ninth article, but\r\nonly a provision that Articles XVIII to XXV, inclusive, and Article\r\nXXX shall take effect as soon as the laws required to carry them into\r\noperation shall be passed by the legislative bodies of the different\r\ncountries concerned, and that \"they shall remain in force for the period\r\nof ten years from the date at which they may come into operation, and,\r\nfurther, until the expiration of two years after either of the high\r\ncontracting parties shall have given notice to the other of its wish to\r\nterminate the same.\"\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that the \"term of years mentioned in Article\r\nXXXIII,\" referred to in Article XXIX as the limit of its duration, means\r\nthe period during which Articles XVIII to XXV, inclusive, and Article\r\nXXX, commonly called the \"fishery articles,\" should continue in force\r\nunder the language of said Article XXXIII.\r\n\r\nThat the joint high commissioners who negotiated the treaty so\r\nunderstood and intended the phrase is certain, for in a statement\r\ncontaining an account of their negotiations, prepared under their\r\nsupervision and approved by them, we find the following entry on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n  The transit question was discussed, and it was agreed that any\r\n  settlement that might be made should include a reciprocal arrangement\r\n  in that respect for the period for which the fishery articles should\r\n  be in force.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this very satisfactory evidence supporting this\r\nconstruction of the language of Article XXIX, it will be found that\r\nthe law passed by Congress to carry the treaty into effect furnishes\r\nconclusive proof of the correctness of such construction.\r\n\r\nThis law was passed March 1, 1873, and is entitled \"An act to carry into\r\neffect the provisions of the treaty between the United States and Great\r\nBritain signed in the city of Washington the 8th day of May, 1871,\r\nrelating to the fisheries.\" After providing in its first and second\r\nsections for putting in operation Articles XVIII to XXV, inclusive, and\r\nArticle XXX of the treaty, the third section is devoted to Article XXIX,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3. That from the date of the President's proclamation authorized by\r\n  the first section of this act, and so long as the articles eighteenth to\r\n  twenty-fifth, inclusive, and article thirtieth of said treaty shall\r\n  remain in force according to the terms and conditions of article\r\n  thirty-third of said treaty, all goods, wares, and merchandise, arriving\r\n\r\n\r\netc., etc., following in the remainder of the section the precise words\r\nof the stipulation on the part of the United States as contained in\r\nArticle XXIX, which I have already fully quoted.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a distinct enactment of the Congress limiting the\r\nduration of this article of the treaty to the time that Articles XVIII\r\nto XXV, inclusive, and Article XXX should continue in force. That in\r\nfixing such limitation it but gave the meaning of the treaty itself is\r\nindicated by the fact that its purpose is declared to be to carry into\r\neffect the provisions of the treaty, and by the further fact that this\r\nlaw appears to have been submitted before the promulgation of the treaty\r\nto certain members of the joint high commission representing both\r\ncountries, and met with no objection or dissent.\r\n\r\nThere appearing to be no conflict or inconsistency between the treaty\r\nand the act of the Congress last cited, it is not necessary to invoke\r\nthe well-settled principle that in case of such conflict the statute\r\ngoverns the question.\r\n\r\nIn any event, and whether the law of 1873 construes the treaty or\r\ngoverns it, section 29 of such treaty, I have no doubt, terminated with\r\nthe proceedings taken by our Government to terminate Articles XVIII to\r\nXXV, inclusive, and Article XXX of the treaty. These proceedings had\r\ntheir inception in a joint resolution of Congress passed May 3, 1883,\r\ndeclaring that in the judgment of Congress these articles ought to\r\nbe terminated, and directing the President to give the notice to the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain provided for in Article XXXIII of the\r\ntreaty. Such notice having been given two years prior to the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1885, the articles mentioned were absolutely terminated on the\r\nlast-named day, and with them Article XXIX was also terminated.\r\n\r\nIf by any language used in the joint resolution it was intended to\r\nrelieve section 3 of the act of 1873, embodying Article XXIX of the\r\ntreaty, from its own limitations, or to save the article itself, I am\r\nentirely satisfied that the intention miscarried.\r\n\r\nBut statutes granting to the people of Canada the valuable privileges of\r\ntransit for their goods from our ports and over our soil, which had been\r\npassed prior to the making of the treaty of 1871 and independently of\r\nit, remained in force; and ever since the abrogation of the treaty, and\r\nnotwithstanding the refusal of Canada to permit our fishermen to send\r\ntheir fish to their home market through her territory in bond, the\r\npeople of that Dominion have enjoyed without diminution the advantages\r\nof our liberal and generous laws.\r\n\r\nWithout basing our complaint upon a violation of treaty obligations,\r\nit is nevertheless true that such refusal of transit and the other\r\ninjurious acts which have been recited constitute a provoking insistence\r\nupon rights neither mitigated by the amenities of national intercourse\r\nnor modified by the recognition of our liberality and generous\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nThe history of events connected with this subject makes it manifest\r\nthat the Canadian government can, if so disposed administer its laws\r\nand protect the interests of its people without manifestation of\r\nunfriendliness and without the unneighborly treatment of our fishing\r\nvessels of which we have justly complained, and whatever is done on our\r\npart should be done in the hope that the disposition of the Canadian\r\ngovernment may remove the occasion of a resort to the additional\r\nexecutive power now sought through legislative action.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that upon the principles which should govern retaliation\r\nour intercourse and relations with the Dominion of Canada furnish no\r\nbetter opportunity for its application than is suggested by the\r\nconditions herein presented, and that it could not be more effectively\r\ninaugurated than under the power of suspension recommended.\r\n\r\nWhile I have expressed my clear conviction upon the question of the\r\ncontinuance of section 29 of the treaty of 1871, I of course fully\r\nconcede the power and the duty of the Congress, in contemplating\r\nlegislative action, to construe the terms of any treaty stipulation\r\nwhich might upon any possible consideration of good faith limit such\r\naction, and likewise the peculiar propriety in the case here presented\r\nof its interpretation of its own language, as contained in the laws\r\nof 1873 putting in operation said treaty and of 1883 directing the\r\ntermination thereof; and if in the deliberate judgment of Congress any\r\nrestraint to the proposed legislation exists, it is to be hoped that the\r\nexpediency of its early removal will be recognized. I desire also to\r\ncall the attention of the Congress to another subject involving such\r\nwrongs and unfair treatment to our citizens as, in my opinion, require\r\nprompt action.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of the Great Lakes and the immense business and carrying\r\ntrade growing out of the same have been treated broadly and liberally\r\nby the United States Government and made free to all mankind, while\r\nCanadian railroads and navigation companies share in our country's\r\ntransportation upon terms as favorable as are accorded to our own\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe canals and other public works built and maintained by the Government\r\nalong the line of the lakes are made free to all.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this condition, and evincing a narrow and ungenerous\r\ncommercial spirit, every lock and canal which is a public work of the\r\nDominion of Canada is subject to tolls and charges.\r\n\r\nBy Article XXVII of the treaty of 1871 provision was made to secure to\r\nthe citizens of the United States the use of the Welland, St. Lawrence,\r\nand other canals in the Dominion of Canada on terms of equality with the\r\ninhabitants of the Dominion, and to also secure to the subjects of Great\r\nBritain the use of the St. Clair Flats Canal on terms of equality with\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe equality with the inhabitants of the Dominion which we were promised\r\nin the use of the canals of Canada did not secure to us freedom from\r\ntolls in their navigation, but we had a right to expect that we, being\r\nAmericans and interested in American commerce, would be no more burdened\r\nin regard to the same than Canadians engaged in their own trade; and\r\nthe whole spirit of the concession made was, or should have been, that\r\nmerchandise and property transported to an American market through these\r\ncanals should not be enhanced in its cost by tolls many times higher\r\nthan such as were carried to an adjoining Canadian market. All our\r\ncitizens, producers and consumers as well as vessel owners, were to\r\nenjoy the equality promised.\r\n\r\nAnd yet evidence has for some time been before the Congress, furnished\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury, showing that while the tolls charged\r\nin the first instance are the same to all, such vessels and cargoes as\r\nare destined to certain Canadian ports are allowed a refund of nearly\r\nthe entire tolls, while those bound for American ports are not allowed\r\nany such advantage.\r\n\r\nTo promise equality, and then in practice make it conditional upon our\r\nvessels doing Canadian business instead of their own, is to fulfill a\r\npromise with the shadow of performance.\r\n\r\nI recommend that such legislative action be taken as will give Canadian\r\nvessels navigating our canals, and their cargoes, precisely the\r\nadvantages granted to our vessels and cargoes upon Canadian canals, and\r\nthat the same be measured by exactly the same rule of discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe course which I have outlined and the recommendations made relate to\r\nthe honor and dignity of our country and the protection and preservation\r\nof the rights and interests of all our people. A government does but\r\nhalf its duty when it protects its citizens at home and permits them\r\nto be imposed upon and humiliated by the unfair and over-reaching\r\ndisposition of other nations. If we invite our people to rely upon\r\narrangements made for their benefit abroad, we should see to it that\r\nthey are not deceived; and if we are generous and liberal to a\r\nneighboring country, our people should reap the advantage of it by a\r\nreturn of liberality and generosity.\r\n\r\nThese are subjects which partisanship should not disturb or confuse. Let\r\nus survey the ground calmly and moderately; and having put aside other\r\nmeans of settlement, if we enter upon the policy of retaliation let us\r\npursue it firmly, with a determination only to subserve the interests of\r\nour people and maintain the high standard and the becoming pride of\r\nAmerican citizenship.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 27, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n27th instant (the Senate concurring), I return herewith House bill No.\r\n10060, entitled \"An act prescribing the times for sales and for notice\r\nof sales of property in the District of Columbia for overdue taxes.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the Senate in the words following--\r\n\r\n  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, _September 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President is requested, if not incompatible\r\n  with the public interests, to inform the Senate whether the recent\r\n  treaty with China and the amendments adopted by the Senate have been\r\n  ratified by the Emperor of China--\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to communicate the annexed copies of dispatches from our minister\r\nto China, giving the only official information at hand in relation to\r\nthe matter to which reference is had.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 12, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nResponding to the inquiries contained in the subjoined resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 28th ultimo, I have the honor to state in reply to the\r\nsubject first therein mentioned, calling upon the Executive for \"copies\r\nof all communications, if any, addressed by his direction to the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain, remonstrating with that Government against\r\nthe wrongs and unfair treatment to our citizens by the action of the\r\nCanadian Government in refunding to vessels and cargoes which pass\r\nthrough the Welland and other Canadian canals nearly the entire tolls\r\nif they are destined to Canadian ports, while those bound for American\r\nports are not allowed any such advantage, and the breach of the\r\nengagement contained in the treaty of 1871 whereby Great Britain\r\npromised to the United States equality in the matter of such canal\r\ntransportation; also copies of any demand made by his direction upon\r\nGreat Britain for the redress of such wrongs, and the replies of Great\r\nBritain to such communication and demand,\" that I herewith transmit\r\ncopies of all communications between the Department of State and the\r\nUnited States consul at Ottawa, which are accompanied by copies of the\r\norders of the Canadian officials in relation to the subject inquired of;\r\nalso correspondence between the Department of State and the British\r\nminister at this capital, with copies of the documents therein referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nI also inclose, as connected therewith, a copy of Executive Document\r\nNo. 406, House of Representatives, Fiftieth Congress, first session,\r\ncontaining the answer of the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, dated\r\nJuly 23, 1888, in reply to a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nrelating to the navigation of the Welland Canal, and the documents thus\r\ntransmitted comprise the entire correspondence in relation to the\r\nsubjects referred to in that portion of the resolution of inquiry which\r\nis above quoted.\r\n\r\nThe second branch of inquiry is in the words following:\r\n\r\n  And also that there be communicated to the Senate copies of all papers,\r\n  correspondence, and information touching the matter of the refusal of\r\n  the British Government, or that of any of her North American dominions,\r\n  to allow the entry at Dominion seaports of American fish or other\r\n  cargoes for transportation in bond to the United States since the 1st\r\n  day of July, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that though the fishing articles of the treaty of\r\n1871 expired on the said 1st day of July, 1885, a temporary arrangement\r\nwas made whereby the privileges accorded to our fishermen under said\r\narticles were continued during the remainder of that year's fishing\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nNo instance of refusal by the Canadian authorities since July 1, 1885,\r\nup to the present time to allow the entry at Dominion seaports of\r\nAmerican cargoes other than fish for transportation in bond across the\r\nterritory of Canada to the United States has been made known to the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nThe case of the fishing steamer _Novelty_, involving, among\r\nother things, a refusal, on July 1, 1886, of the right to permit the\r\ntransshipment of fish in bond at the port of Pictou, Nova Scotia, was\r\nduly communicated to Congress in my message of December 8, 1886, a copy\r\nof which I herewith transmit. (Ex. Doc. No. 19, Forty-ninth Congress,\r\nsecond session, p. 1.)\r\n\r\nOn page 16 of this document will be found a copy of a communication\r\naddressed by the Secretary of State to the British minister, dated June\r\n14, 1886, on the subject of the refusal of transshipment of fish in\r\nbond. At page 24 of the same publication will be found the protest of\r\nthe Secretary of State in the case of the _Novelty_, and at pages\r\n49-50 are the response of the British minister and report of the\r\nCanadian privy council.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January, 1887, a revised list of cases of alleged ill\r\ntreatment of our fishing vessels in Canadian waters was furnished by the\r\nSecretary of State to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate,\r\nin which the above case is included, a copy of which, being Senate\r\nExecutive Document No. 55 of the second session Forty-ninth Congress, is\r\nherewith inclosed; and in the report by Mr. Edmunds, from the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations (No. 1683 of the same session), the case referred\r\nto was again published. And, as relating to the subject of the\r\nresolution now before me, the following pertinent passage, taken from\r\nthe said report, may be of interest:\r\n\r\n  As regards commercial and other friendly business intercourse between\r\n  ports and places in the Dominion and the United States, it is, of\r\n  course, of much importance that regulations affecting the same should\r\n  be mutually reasonable and fairly administered. If an American vessel\r\n  should happen to have caught a cargo of fish at sea 100 miles distant\r\n  from some Canadian port, from which there is railway communication to\r\n  the United States, and should be denied the privilege of landing and\r\n  shipping its cargo therefrom to the United States, as the Canadians\r\n  do, it would be, of course, a serious disadvantage; and there is, it\r\n  is thought, nothing in the treaty of 1818 which would warrant such an\r\n  exclusion. But the Dominion laws may make such a distinction, and it is\r\n  understood that in fact the privilege of so shipping fish from American\r\n  vessels has been refused during the last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also respectfully refer to Senate Miscellaneous Document No. 54,\r\nForty-ninth Congress, second session, being a communication from the\r\nCommissioner of Fish and Fisheries to Hon. George F. Edmunds, chairman\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Relations, dated February 5, 1887, which is\r\naccompanied by a partial list of vessels injuriously treated by the\r\nCanadian authorities, based upon information furnished to the United\r\nStates Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.\r\n\r\nThis list is stated to be supplementary to the revised list which had\r\nbeen transmitted to the committee by the Secretary of State January 26,\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nOf the sixty-eight vessels comprised in this list it is stated that six,\r\nto wit, the _Nellie M. Snow_, _Andrew Burnham_, _Harry G. French_,\r\n_Col. J.H. French_, _W.H. Wellington_, and _Ralph Hodgdon_, were\r\nrefused permission to transship fish. None of these cases, however, were\r\never reported to the Department of State by the parties interested, or\r\nwere accompanied by affidavit; nor does it appear the facts ever were\r\ninvestigated in any of the cases by the parties making the reports,\r\nwhich were obtained by circulars issued by order of the Commissioner of\r\nFish and Fisheries. The concluding inquiry is as follows:\r\n\r\n  And also that he communicate to the Senate what instances have occurred\r\n  since the 3d of March, 1887, of wrongs to American fishing vessels or\r\n  other American vessels in the ports or waters of British North America,\r\n  and what steps, if any, have been taken in respect thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the act of March 3, 1887, the negotiation\r\nwhich had been proceeding for several months previously progressed\r\nactively, and the proposed conference and the presence at this capital\r\nof the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments, out of which the since\r\nrejected treaty of February 7, 1888, eventuated, had their natural\r\ninfluence in repressing causes of complaint in relation to the\r\nfisheries. Therefore since March 3, 1887, no case has been reported to\r\nthe Department of State wherein complaint was made of unfriendly or\r\nunlawful treatment of American fishing vessels on the part of the\r\nCanadian authorities in which reparation was not promptly and\r\nsatisfactorily obtained by the United States consul-general at Halifax.\r\n\r\nA single case of alleged unjust treatment of an American merchant\r\nvessel, not engaged in fishing, has been reported since March 3, 1887.\r\nThis was the ship _Bridgewater_, which was first brought to the\r\nattention of the Department of State by the claimant by petition filed\r\nJune 1, 1888.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1888, legal counsel, who appeared and desired to be\r\nheard, filed their formal authority and the claim was at once duly\r\ninvestigated, and on June 22, 1888, a communication was addressed by the\r\nSecretary of State to the British minister, which sets forth the history\r\nof the claim, and a copy of which is herewith transmitted; and of this\r\nformal acknowledgment was made, but no further reply has been received.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 18, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, in reply to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n11th instant, a copy of a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying documents, relative to the pending treaty with China.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 1, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI have this day approved House bill No. 11336, supplementary to an act\r\nentitled \"An act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to\r\nChinese,\" approved the 6th day of May, 1882.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that some suggestions and recommendations may properly\r\naccompany my approval of this bill.\r\n\r\nIts object is to more effectually accomplish by legislation the\r\nexclusion from this country of Chinese laborers.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of blending the social habits and mutual race\r\nidiosyncrasies of the Chinese laboring classes with those of the great\r\nbody of the people of the United States has been proved by the\r\nexperience of twenty years, and ever since the Burlingame treaty of\r\n1868, to be in every sense unwise, impolitic, and injurious to both\r\nnations. With the lapse of time the necessity for its abandonment has\r\ngrown in force, until those having in charge the Government of the\r\nrespective countries have resolved to modify and sufficiently abrogate\r\nall those features of prior Conventional arrangements which permitted\r\nthe coming of Chinese laborers to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn modification of prior conventions the treaty of November 17, 1880,\r\nwas concluded, whereby, in the first article thereof, it was agreed that\r\nthe United States should at will regulate, limit, or suspend the coming\r\nof Chinese laborers to the United States, but not absolutely prohibit\r\nit; and under this article an act of Congress, approved on May 6, 1882\r\n(see 22 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 58), and amended July 5, 1884 (23\r\nU.S. Statutes at Large, p. 115), suspended for ten years the coming of\r\nChinese laborers to the United States, and regulated the going and\r\ncoming of such Chinese laborers as were at that time in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, soon made evident that the mercenary greed of the\r\nparties who were trading in the labor of this class of the Chinese\r\npopulation was proving too strong for the just execution of the law, and\r\nthat the virtual defeat of the object and intent of both law and treaty\r\nwas being fraudulently accomplished by false pretense and perjury,\r\ncontrary to the expressed will of both Governments.\r\n\r\nTo such an extent has the successful violation of the treaty and the\r\nlaws enacted for its execution progressed that the courts in the Pacific\r\nStates have been for some time past overwhelmed by the examination of\r\ncases of Chinese laborers who are charged with having entered our ports\r\nunder fraudulent certificates of return or seek to establish by perjury\r\nthe claim of prior residence.\r\n\r\nSuch demonstration of the inoperative and inefficient condition of the\r\ntreaty and law has produced deep-seated and increasing discontent among\r\nthe people of the United States, and especially with those resident on\r\nthe Pacific Coast. This has induced me to omit no effort to find an\r\neffectual remedy for the evils complained of and to answer the earnest\r\npopular demand for the absolute exclusion of Chinese laborers having\r\nobjects and purposes unlike our own and wholly disconnected with\r\nAmerican citizenship.\r\n\r\nAided by the presence in this country of able and intelligent diplomatic\r\nand consular officers of the Chinese Government, and the representations\r\nmade from time to time by our minister in China under the instructions\r\nof the Department of State, the actual condition of public sentiment and\r\nthe status of affairs in the United States have been fully made known to\r\nthe Government of China.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for remedy has been fully appreciated by that Government,\r\nand in August, 1886, our minister at Peking received from the Chinese\r\nforeign office a communication announcing that China, of her own accord,\r\nproposed to establish a system of strict and absolute prohibition of her\r\nlaborers, under heavy penalties, from coming to the United States, and\r\nlikewise to prohibit the return to the United States of any Chinese\r\nlaborer who had at any time gone back to China, \"in order\" (in the words\r\nof the communication) \"that the Chinese laborers may gradually be\r\nreduced in number and causes of danger averted and lives preserved.\"\r\n\r\nThis view of the Chinese Government, so completely in harmony with that\r\nof the United States, was by my direction speedily formulated in a\r\ntreaty draft between the two nations, embodying the propositions so\r\npresented by the Chinese foreign office.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations, frequent oral discussions, and correspondence on the\r\ngeneral questions that ensued have been fully communicated by me to the\r\nSenate at the present session, and, as contained in Senate Executive\r\nDocument O, parts 1 and 2, and in Senate Executive Document No. 272,\r\nmay be properly referred to as containing a complete history of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nIt is thus easy to learn how the joint desires and unequivocal mutual\r\nunderstanding of the two Governments were brought into articulated\r\nform in the treaty, which, after a mutual exhibition of plenary powers\r\nfrom the respective Governments, was signed and concluded by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the United States and China at this capital on\r\nMarch 12 last.\r\n\r\nBeing submitted for the advice and consent of the Senate, its\r\nconfirmation, on the 7th day of May last, was accompanied by two\r\namendments which that body ingrafted upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of the same month the Chinese minister, who was the\r\nplenipotentiary of his Government in the negotiation and the conclusion\r\nof the treaty, in a note to the Secretary of State gave his approval to\r\nthese amendments, \"as they did not alter the terms of the treaty,\" and\r\nthe amendments were at once telegraphed to China, whither the original\r\ntreaty had previously been sent immediately after its signature on March\r\n12.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th day of last month I approved Senate bill No. 3304, \"to\r\nprohibit the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States.\" This bill\r\nwas intended to supplement the treaty, and was approved in the confident\r\nanticipation of an early exchange of ratifications of the treaty and its\r\namendments and the proclamation of the same, upon which event the\r\nlegislation so approved was by its terms to take effect.\r\n\r\nNo information of any definite action upon the treaty by the Chinese\r\nGovernment was received until the 21st ultimo--the day the bill which\r\nI have just approved was presented to me--when a telegram from our\r\nminister at Peking to the Secretary of State announced the refusal of\r\nthe Chinese Government to exchange ratifications of the treaty unless\r\nfurther discussion should be had with a view to shorten the period\r\nstipulated in the treaty for the exclusion of Chinese laborers and to\r\nchange the conditions agreed on, which should entitle any Chinese\r\nlaborer who might go back to China to return again to the United States.\r\n\r\nBy a note from the chargé d'affaires _ad interim_ of China to the\r\nSecretary of State, received on the evening of the 25th ultimo (a copy\r\nof which is herewith transmitted, together with the reply thereto), a\r\nthird amendment is proposed, whereby the certificate under which any\r\ndeparting Chinese laborer alleging the possession of property in the\r\nUnited States would be enabled to return to this country should be\r\ngranted by the Chinese consul instead of the United States collector,\r\nas had been provided in the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe obvious and necessary effect of this last proposition would be\r\npractically to place the execution of the treaty beyond the control of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nArticle I of the treaty proposed to be so materially altered had in the\r\ncourse of the negotiations been settled in acquiescence with the request\r\nof the Chinese plenipotentiary and to his expressed satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, as appears in the documents heretofore referred to, the Chinese\r\nforeign office had formally proposed to our minister strict exclusion of\r\nChinese laborers from the United States without limitation, and had\r\notherwise and more definitely stated that no term whatever for exclusion\r\nwas necessary, for the reason that China would of itself take steps to\r\nprevent its laborers from coming to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the negotiations that followed suggestions from the\r\nsame quarter led to the insertion in behalf of the United States of a\r\nterm of \"thirty years,\" and this term, upon the representations of the\r\nChinese plenipotentiary, was reduced to \"twenty years,\" and finally so\r\nagreed upon.\r\n\r\nArticle II was wholly of Chinese origination, and to that alone owes its\r\npresence in the treaty.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here pertinent to remark that everywhere in the United States\r\nlaws for the collection of debts are equally available to all creditors\r\nwithout respect to race, sex, nationality, or place of residence, and\r\nequally with the citizens or subjects of the most favored nations and\r\nwith the citizens of the United States recovery can be had in any court\r\nof justice in the United States by a subject of China, whether of the\r\nlaboring or any other class.\r\n\r\nNo disability accrues from nonresidence of a plaintiff, whose claim can\r\nbe enforced in the usual way by him or his assignee or attorney in our\r\ncourts of justice.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it can not be alleged that there exists the slightest\r\ndiscrimination against Chinese subjects, and it is a notable fact that\r\nlarge trading firms and companies and individual merchants and traders\r\nof that nation are profitably established at numerous points throughout\r\nthe Union, in whose hands every claim transmitted by an absent Chinaman\r\nof a just and lawful nature could be completely enforced.\r\n\r\nThe admitted and paramount right and duty of every government to exclude\r\nfrom its borders all elements of foreign population which for any reason\r\nretard its prosperity or are detrimental to the moral and physical\r\nhealth of its people must be regarded as a recognized canon of\r\ninternational law and intercourse. China herself has not dissented from\r\nthis doctrine, but has, by the expressions to which I have referred, led\r\nus confidently to rely upon such action on her part in cooperation with\r\nus as would enforce the exclusion of Chinese laborers from our country.\r\n\r\nThis cooperation has not, however, been accorded us. Thus from the\r\nunexpected and disappointing refusal of the Chinese Government to\r\nconfirm the acts of its authorized agent and to carry into effect an\r\ninternational agreement, the main feature of which was voluntarily\r\npresented by that Government for our acceptance, and which had been the\r\nsubject of long and careful deliberation, an emergency has arisen, in\r\nwhich the Government of the United States is called upon to act in\r\nself-defense by the exercise of its legislative power. I can not but\r\nregard the expressed demand on the part of China for a reexamination and\r\nrenewed discussion of the topics so completely covered by mutual treaty\r\nstipulations as an indefinite postponement and practical abandonment of\r\nthe objects we have in view, to which the Government of China may justly\r\nbe considered as pledged.\r\n\r\nThe facts and circumstances which I have narrated lead me, in the\r\nperformance of what seems to me to be my official duty, to join the\r\nCongress in dealing legislatively with the question of the exclusion of\r\nChinese laborers, in lieu of further attempts to adjust it by\r\ninternational agreement.\r\n\r\nBut while thus exercising our undoubted right in the interest of our\r\npeople and for the general welfare of our country, justice and fairness\r\nseem to require that some provision should be made by act or joint\r\nresolution under which such Chinese laborers as shall actually have\r\nembarked on their return to the United States before the passage of the\r\nlaw this day approved, and are now on their way, may be permitted to\r\nland, provided they have duly and lawfully obtained and shall present\r\ncertificates heretofore issued permitting them to return in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of existing law.\r\n\r\nNor should our recourse to legislative measures of exclusion cause us to\r\nretire from the offer we have made to indemnify such Chinese subjects as\r\nhave suffered damage through violence in the remote and comparatively\r\nunsettled portions of our country at the hands of lawless men. Therefore\r\nI recommend that, without acknowledging legal liability therefor, but\r\nbecause it was stipulated in the treaty which has failed to take effect,\r\nand in a spirit of humanity befitting our nation, there be appropriated\r\nthe sum of $276,619.75, payable to the Chinese minister at this capital\r\non behalf of his Government, as full indemnity for all losses and\r\ninjuries sustained by Chinese subjects in the manner and under the\r\ncircumstances mentioned.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, October 12, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, with a view to its ratification, a convention between the\r\nUnited States of America and Venezuela to further extend the period for\r\nthe exchange of ratifications of the claims convention of December 5,\r\n1885, between the said contracting parties and to extend the period for\r\nthe exchange of ratifications of the convention of March 15, 1888,\r\nbetween the same contracting parties, also relating to claims.\r\n\r\nI invite attention to the accompanying report of the Secretary of State\r\nand the papers inclosed therein.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 4, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill 2477, entitled \"An act for\r\nthe relief of Nathaniel McKay and the executors of Donald McKay.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to allow the beneficiaries named therein to\r\npresent to the Court of Claims for determination certain demands made\r\nby them against the Government on account of the construction of two\r\nironclad monitors called the _Squando_ and the _Nauset_ and a\r\nside-wheel steamer called the _Ashuelot_.\r\n\r\nThe contracts for building these vessels were made early in 1863. It was\r\nagreed that they should be completed within six or eight months. It was\r\nalso provided in these contracts that the Government \"should have the\r\nprivilege of making alterations and additions to the plans and\r\nspecifications at any time during the progress of the work, as it may\r\ndeem necessary and proper,\" and that if said alterations and additions\r\nshould cause extra expense to the contractors the Government would \"pay\r\nfor the same at fair and reasonable rates.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the time allowed for the completion of these\r\nvessels was with the assent of the contractors made exceedingly short;\r\nthat notwithstanding this fact they consented to permit such alterations\r\nof plans as must almost necessarily prolong the time, fixing no limit to\r\nsuch extension, and that in the same breath they fix their measure of\r\ncompensation for such alterations and an extended time consequent\r\nthereon at \"a fair and reasonable rate\" for the extra expense caused\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately upon the beginning of their work alterations and\r\nchanges were made in the original plans for these vessels, and they were\r\nrepeated and continued to such a degree that the completion of the\r\nvessels was delayed many months.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year 1864 and early in the year 1865 payments\r\nin excess of the contract price were made by the Navy Department to the\r\ncontractors under the provisions of the contract above recited. The\r\ncontract price for the _Squando_ was $395,000. The contractors\r\nclaimed extra compensation amounting to $337,329.46, and there was\r\nallowed $194,525.70. The contract price of the _Nauset_ was\r\n$386,000, the extra compensation claimed was $314,768.93, and the amount\r\nallowed $192,110.98. The contract price of the side-wheel steamer\r\n_Ashuelot_ was $275,000, the extra compensation claimed was\r\n$81,447.50, and the amount allowed was $22,415.92. The different sums as\r\nthus adjusted were received by the contractors in settlement of their\r\nclaims for extra expense, and receipts in full were given by them to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nA number of other contractors had done like work for the Government and\r\nclaimed to have demands growing out of the same for extra compensation.\r\n\r\nEvidently with the view of investigating and settling these claims, on\r\nthe 9th day of March, 1865, the Senate passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the Secretary of the Navy be requested to organize\r\n  a board of not less than three persons, whose duty it shall be to\r\n  inquire into and determine how much the vessels of war and steam\r\n  machinery contracted for by the Department in the years 1862 and 1863\r\n  cost the contractors over and above the contract price and allowance\r\n  for extra work, and report the same to the Senate at its next session;\r\n  none but those that have given satisfaction to the Department to be\r\n  considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis board was appointed by the Secretary of the Navy on the 25th\r\nday of May, 1865, and consisted of a commodore, a chief engineer,\r\nand a paymaster in the Navy. Its powers were broad and liberal, and\r\ncomprehended an inquiry touching all things that made up \"the cost to\r\nthe contractors\" of their work in excess of the contract price and\r\nallowances for extra work.\r\n\r\nThe board convened on the 6th day of June, 1865, and sat continuously\r\nuntil the 23d day of December following, and made numerous awards to\r\ncontractors. The parties mentioned in the bill now under consideration\r\nwere notified on the 9th and 15th days of June, 1865, to prepare and\r\nsubmit testimony to the board in support of their claims, and they\r\nrepeatedly signified their intention to do so.\r\n\r\nDonald McKay was the contractor for the construction of the monitor\r\n_Nauset_ and the steamer _Ashuelot_. The proceedings of the\r\nboard show that on the 11th day of August, 1865, he notified the board\r\nthat the only claim he made for loss was on the hull, boiler, and\r\nmachinery of the _Ashuelot_, which he would be prepared to present\r\nin about six weeks.\r\n\r\nNeither of these parties presented any statement to the board, and no\r\nclaim of theirs was passed upon.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d day of March, 1867, an act was passed directing the Secretary\r\nof the Navy to investigate the claims of all contractors for building\r\nvessels of war and steam machinery for the same under contracts made\r\nafter May 1, 1861, and before January 1, 1864. He was by said act\r\nrequired \"to ascertain the additional cost which was necessarily\r\nincurred by each contractor in the completion of his work by reason of\r\nany changes or alterations in the plans and specifications required and\r\ndelays in the prosecution of the work occasioned by the Government which\r\nwere not provided for in the original contract.\" It was further provided\r\nthat there should be reported to Congress a tabular statement of each\r\ncase, which should contain \"the name of the contractor, a description of\r\nthe work, the contract price, the whole increased cost of the work over\r\nthe contract price, and the amount of such increased cost caused by the\r\ndelay and action of the Government as aforesaid, and the amount already\r\npaid the contractor over and above the contract price.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this act Commodore J.A. Marchand, Chief Engineer J.W. King, and\r\nPaymaster Edward Foster, of the Navy, were designated by the Secretary\r\nof the Navy to make the investigation required. These officers on the\r\n26th day of November, 1867, made a report of their proceedings, which\r\nwas submitted to the Senate with a tabulated statement of all the claims\r\nexamined by them and their findings thereon.\r\n\r\nIt appears by this report that the claims of the beneficiaries mentioned\r\nin the bill herewith returned were examined by the board, and that\r\nnothing was found due thereon under the terms of the law directing their\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThese claims have frequently been before Congress since that time. They\r\nhave been favorably reported and acted upon a number of times, and have\r\nalso been more than once strongly condemned by committees to whom they\r\nwere referred.\r\n\r\nA resolution was passed in 1871 by the Congress referring these and\r\nother claims of a like character to the Court of Claims for\r\nadjudication, but it was vetoed by the President for reasons not\r\nnecessarily affecting the merits of the claims.\r\n\r\nThe case of Chouteau _vs_. The United States, reported in Fifth\r\nOtto, page 61, which arose out of the contract to build a vessel called\r\nthe _Etlah_, appears to present the same features that belong to\r\nthe claims here considered. It is stated in the report of the House\r\ncommittee on this bill that \"the _Squando_ and _Nauset_ were\r\nidentical in the original plans and the changes and alterations thereon\r\nwith the _Etlah_ and _Shiloh_, built in St. Louis;\" and yet\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States distinctly decided in the\r\n_Etlah_ case that the only pretext for further compensation should\r\nbe sought for in the contract, where the contractor had evidently been\r\ncontent to provide for all the remedy he desired.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that the contractors mentioned in this bill, after\r\nentering into contracts plainly indicating that changes of plans and\r\nconsequent delay in their work were in their contemplation, availed\r\nthemselves of the remedy which they themselves had provided, and\r\nthereupon received about 50 per cent in the case of two of these vessels\r\nof the contract price for extra work, giving the Government a receipt in\r\nfull. When soon thereafter opportunity was offered them to make further\r\nclaim of as broad a nature as they could desire, they failed to do so,\r\nand one of them disclaimed any right to recover on account of one of the\r\nvessels, though all are now included in the present bill. In 1867 the\r\nclaims were fully examined under a law of Congress and rejected, and the\r\nSupreme Court in an exactly similar case finds neither law nor equity\r\nsupporting them.\r\n\r\nIf it be claimed that no compensation has been yet allowed solely for\r\nthe increase in the price of labor and material caused by delay in\r\nconstruction, it is no hardship to say that as the contractors made\r\nprovision for change of plans and delay they must be held to have taken\r\nthe risk of such rise in price and be satisfied with the provision they\r\nhave made against it. Besides, much of the increase in the price of\r\nlabor and material is included in the extra cost which has already been\r\nreimbursed to them.\r\n\r\nBut the bill does not provide that these contractors shall be limited in\r\nthe Court of Claims to a recovery solely for loss occasioned by increase\r\nof the cost of labor and material during the delay caused by the\r\nGovernment. By the terms of the proposed act the court is directed to\r\nascertain the additional cost necessarily incurred in building the\r\nvessels by reason of any changes or alterations in the plans and\r\nspecifications and delays in the prosecution of the work. This, it seems\r\nto me, would enable these contractors to open the whole question of\r\ncompensation for extra work.\r\n\r\nIt hardly seems fair to the Government to permit these claims to be\r\npresented after a lapse of twenty-three years since a settlement in full\r\nwas made and receipts given, after the opportunity which has been\r\noffered for establishing further claims if they existed, and when, as a\r\nconsequence of the contractor's neglect, the Government would labor\r\nunder great disadvantages in its defense.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion, in view of the history of these claims and the\r\nsuspicion naturally excited as to their merit, that no injustice will be\r\ndone if they are laid at rest instead of being given new life and vigor\r\nin the Court of Claims.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 445, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Laura A. Wright.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is the widow of Charles H. Wright,\r\nwho was pensioned for a gunshot wound received in the military service\r\nof the United States on the 19th day of September, 1864. He continued\r\nin the receipt of such pension until June 25, 1884, when he committed\r\nsuicide by hanging.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged on behalf of his widow that the pain caused by his wound\r\nwas so great that it caused temporary insanity, under the influence of\r\nwhich he destroyed himself.\r\n\r\nThere is not a particle of proof that I can discover tending to show an\r\nunsound mind, unless it be the fact of his suicide. He suffered much\r\npain at intervals. He was a farmer in comfortable circumstances, and\r\naccording to the testimony of one of the physicians, filed in support\r\nof the widow's claim, his health was good up to the time of his death,\r\nexcept for the wound and its results. The day before his death he was\r\nengaged in work connected with his farming occupation, though he\r\ncomplained of pain from his wound. Early the next morning, still\r\ncomplaining, as it is alleged, of his wound, he went out, declaring he\r\nwas going out to milk, and not returning in due time, upon search his\r\nbody was found and his self-destruction discovered. This was nearly\r\ntwenty years after the deceased received his wound, and there is not\r\na suggestion of any act or word of his in all that time indicating\r\ninsanity. It seems to me it can hardly be assumed in such circumstances\r\nthat the insanity and death of the soldier resulted from pain arising\r\nfrom his wound, merely because no other explanation can be given. In\r\nnumerous cases of suicide no cause or motive for self-destruction is\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWe have within our borders thousands of widows living in poverty, and\r\nsome of them in need, whose dead husbands fought bravely and well in\r\ndefense of the Government, but whose deaths were not occasioned by any\r\nincident of military service. In these cases the wife's long vigil at\r\nthe bed of wasting disease, the poverty that came before the death, and\r\nthe distressing doubt and uncertainty which darkened the future have not\r\nsecured to such widows the aid of our pension laws.\r\n\r\nWith these in sight the bounty of the Government may without injustice\r\nbe withheld from one whose soldier husband received a pension for nearly\r\ntwenty years, though all that time able to labor, and who, having\r\nreached a stage of comfortable living, made his wife a widow by\r\ndestroying his own life.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 809, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Betsey Mannsfield.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to grant a pension to the beneficiary named in this bill\r\nas the mother of Franklin J. Mannsfield, who enlisted as a private April\r\n27, 1861, and died in camp of disease on the 14th day of November, in\r\nthe same year. His mother filed an application for pension in June,\r\n1882.\r\n\r\nThe testimony filed in the Pension Bureau discloses the following facts:\r\n\r\nAt the time of the death of the soldier the family, besides himself,\r\nconsisted of three persons--his father and mother and an unmarried\r\nsister. They owned and resided upon a homestead in Wisconsin comprising\r\n293 acres, 20 of which were cleared, the balance being in timber, all\r\nunencumbered. The assessed valuation was $1,170, the real value being\r\nconsiderably more. The father was a farmer and blacksmith, healthy and\r\nable-bodied, and furnishing a comfortable support, but shortly after the\r\nsoldier's death he began to drink and his health began to fail. Upon the\r\nmarriage of the daughter he deeded her 50 acres of the land. He became\r\nindebted, and from time to time sold portions of his homestead to pay\r\ndebts; but in 1882, at the time the mother's application for pension was\r\nfiled, there still remained 110 acres of land, valued at about $3,300,\r\n40 acres of which was mortgaged in 1880 for $600. Since 1879 the farm\r\nhad been rented, except 8 or 10 acres reserved for a residence for the\r\nfamily. They owned two cows, and the rent averaged about $125 a year.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs as late as 1886, when the claim of the\r\nmother for a pension was, after investigation, rejected by the Pension\r\nBureau, and it is supposed to be substantially the same now.\r\n\r\nIt also appears that a son, born since the soldier's death, and upward\r\nof 18 years of age, resides with his parents and furnishes them some\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe claimant certainly was not dependent in the least degree upon the\r\nsoldier at the time of his death, and she did not file her claim for\r\npension until nearly twenty-one years thereafter.\r\n\r\nThough the lack of dependence at the date of the soldier's death is\r\nsufficient to defeat a parent's claim for pension under our laws, I\r\nbelieve that in proper cases a relaxation of rules and a charitable\r\nliberality should be shown to parents old and in absolute need through\r\ndefault of the help which, it may be presumed, a son would have\r\nfurnished if his life had not been sacrificed in his country's service.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me the case presented here can not be reached by any\r\ntheory of pensions which has yet been suggested.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 549, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Hannah R. Langdon.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the beneficiary named in this bill entered the military\r\nservice of the United States as assistant surgeon in a Vermont regiment\r\non the 7th day of October, 1862, and less than six months thereafter\r\ntendered his resignation, based upon a surgeon's certificate of\r\ndisability on account of chronic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)\r\nand diarrhea.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of June, 1880, more than seventeen years after his\r\ndischarge, he filed a claim for pension, alleging chronic diarrhea and\r\nresulting piles. He was allowed a pension in January, 1881, and died of\r\nconsumption on the 24th day of September, in the same year.\r\n\r\nPrior to the allowance of his claim for pension he wrote to the Bureau\r\nof Pensions a full history of his disability as resulting from chronic\r\ndiarrhea and piles, and in that letter he made the following statement:\r\n\r\n  I have had no other disease, except last September (1880) I had\r\n  pleurisy and congestion of my left lung.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom other sources the Bureau derived the information that the deceased\r\nhad suffered an attack of pleuro-pneumonia on his left side, and that\r\nhis recovery had been partial.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1880, he was examined by two members of the board of\r\nsurgeons at Burlington, Vt., of which board he was also a member, and\r\nthe following facts were certified:\r\n\r\n  For the past fifteen years claimant has practiced his profession in this\r\n  city, and has up to within a year or a year and a half of this date\r\n  shown a vigor and power of endurance quite equal to the labor imposed\r\n  upon him by the popular demand for his services. About a year ago he\r\n  evinced symptoms of breaking down, cough, emaciation, and debility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese results--\"breaking down, cough, emaciation, and debility\"--are\r\nthe natural effects of such an attack as the deceased himself reported,\r\nthough not made by him any ground of a claim for pension, and it seems\r\nquite clear that his death in September, 1881, must be chargeable to the\r\nsame cause.\r\n\r\nHis widow, the beneficiary named in this bill, filed her claim for\r\npension December 5, 1881, based upon the ground that her husband's death\r\nfrom consumption was due to the chronic diarrhea for which he was\r\npensioned. Upon such application the testimony of Dr. H.H. Atwater was\r\nfiled, to the effect that about 1879 he began to treat the deceased\r\nregularly for pleuro-pneumonia, followed by abscesses and degeneration\r\nof lung tissue, which finally resulted in death, and that these diseased\r\nconditions were complicated with digestive affections, such as diarrhea,\r\ndyspepsia, and indigestion. Another affidavit of Dr. Atwater, made in\r\n1886, will be found in the report upon this bill made by the House\r\nCommittee on Invalid Pensions.\r\n\r\nThe claimant's application for a pension was rejected by the Pension\r\nBureau on the ground that the cause of her husband's death was not shown\r\nto have been connected in any degree with the disease on account of\r\nwhich he was pensioned or with his military service.\r\n\r\nI am entirely satisfied that this determination was correct.\r\n\r\nI am constrained to disapprove the bill under consideration, because\r\nit is thus far our settled and avowed policy to grant pensions only to\r\nwidows whose husbands have died from causes related to military service,\r\nand because the proposed legislation would, in my opinion, result in\r\na discrimination in favor of this claimant unfair and unjust toward\r\nthousands of poor widows who are equally entitled to our sympathy and\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 18, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 258, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Major Daniel N. Bash, paymaster, United States Army.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this bill is to release Paymaster Bash from all liability\r\nto the Government for the loss by theft of $7,350.93, which was\r\nintrusted to him for the payment of United States troops at various\r\nposts, one of which was Fort McKinney, in Wyoming Territory.\r\n\r\nHe started from Cheyenne Depot, accompanied by his clerk, D.F. Bash.\r\nBefore starting he attempted to procure an iron safe in which he could\r\ndeposit the money which he should have in his possession during his\r\nabsence, but was unable to do so. It is alleged that it is customary for\r\npaymasters in such cases to be furnished with safes by the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th day of March, 1887, Major Bash arrived at Douglas, Wyoming\r\nTerritory, having in his possession $350.93, which was a balance left\r\nin his hands after making previous payments on the way. At Douglas he\r\nreceived by express $7,000, $250 of which were in silver. He was met\r\nhere by an escort consisting of a sergeant and private soldier, who had\r\nbeen sent from Fort McKinney, and who were under orders to report to the\r\npaymaster at Douglas and to act as guard from that place to Fort\r\nMcKinney.\r\n\r\nAnother unsuccessful attempt having been made at Douglas to obtain\r\na safe or treasure box in which to carry the money, the same was\r\nput in a leather valise as the best thing that could be done in the\r\ncircumstances. The money was first handed by the paymaster to his clerk,\r\nand by the clerk put in the valise and handed to the sergeant of the\r\nescort. There is evidence that the sergeant was told not to permit it\r\nto be out of his sight. Immediately after supper at Douglas the entire\r\nparty entered the stage and proceeded upon their journey, the sergeant\r\ncarrying the valise. Major Bash asserts that he said to the sergeant,\r\n\"You must take good care of the valise; it contains the money.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, on the 18th day of March, the party arrived at Dry\r\nCheyenne. When the paymaster went in to breakfast at that place, he\r\nfound all the party at the breakfast table. After breakfast he walked\r\nout to the stage, the sergeant going at the same time. He asked him what\r\nhe had done with the valise, and received the reply that it was in the\r\nstage. He then said to the sergeant, \"You ought to have brought it in\r\nwith you; you should take better care of that valise.\" The valise was\r\nthen examined and the money was found untouched.\r\n\r\nPursuing their journey, the party arrived at Antelope Springs, Wyoming\r\nTerritory, at half past 10 o'clock the same morning. The paymaster\r\nalleges that he asked the sergeant if he should take dinner there, and\r\nthat, being answered in the negative, he remarked to him that he might\r\nthen stay at the stage; that he then went to the stage station, leaving\r\nthe two soldiers and the clerk at the stage; that he remained at the\r\nstation warming himself a short time, finding there three citizens, one\r\nof whom he afterwards learned was Parker, the thief; that he left the\r\nroom in which he had been warming himself and went to the dining room,\r\npassing along the front of the house, and as he did so noticed the stage\r\nstanding there with no one near it except a stock tender; that on\r\nreaching the dining room he found his entire party at the table; that he\r\nlooked \"pretty sharp\" at the sergeant, as he was surprised to see him\r\nthere, but as he was just eating his pie he (the paymaster) said nothing\r\nto him; that not more than a minute after that the sergeant and driver\r\ngot up and went out; that three or four minutes after they went out they\r\nrushed back and said that the valise had been taken.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the valise and money had been taken by Parker, who had\r\nmounted a horse and ridden away. He was pursued so closely that revolver\r\nshots were exchanged between the sergeant, who was badly mounted, and\r\nthe thief. The sergeant alleged that he could have shot Parker if he had\r\nbeen provided with a gun instead of a revolver.\r\n\r\nThe facts in relation to this subject were developed upon a court of\r\ninquiry called for that purpose; and much of the above recited is\r\nderived from the evidence of Major Bash himself, taken upon such\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nThe following is the finding of the court concerning the conduct of the\r\npaymaster in the premises:\r\n\r\n  That Major Daniel N. Bash, paymaster, United States Army, did not give\r\n  such direct and detailed orders to the members of the escort as to the\r\n  manner in which they should guard the public money in his (Bash's)\r\n  possession while en route to Fort McKinney as the importance of the\r\n  matter required, and that he did not take the proper and necessary pains\r\n  to see that any orders which he had given on this subject were duly\r\n  obeyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis finding defines a case of negligence which renders the paymaster\r\nliable for the loss of these funds. But a number of army officers,\r\nincluding the members of the court of inquiry, suggest that the\r\npaymaster thus found at fault should be relieved from responsibility.\r\nThis is much the fashion in these days.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a safe should have been provided; that the paymaster\r\nhad the right to rely upon the fidelity and efficiency of the escort,\r\nand that the two men furnished him as an escort were unintelligent\r\nand negligent; that they should have been armed with guns instead of\r\npistols, and that the instructions given to the escort by the paymaster\r\nwere sufficient to acquit him of culpable neglect.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the omissions of care on the part of this officer\r\nare of such a nature as to render much that is urged in his favor\r\nirrelevant. He had the charge of this money. It was his care, vigilance,\r\nand intelligence which were the safeguards of its protection. If he had\r\nas full an appreciation as he indicates of the importance of having a\r\nsafe, he must have known that in its absence additional care and\r\nwatchfulness on his part were necessary, whatever his escort or his\r\nclerk might do.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this he seemed quite content to leave this large\r\nsum of money in the hands of those sent to him, not to have the custody\r\nof his funds, but to guard him from violence and robbery. On the very\r\nmorning of the day the theft was committed he had found fault with the\r\nsergeant for leaving the money in the stage while he took breakfast, and\r\nhad said to him that he (the sergeant) ought to have brought it in with\r\nhim. He here furnishes his own definition of the kind of care which\r\nshould have been taken of the money--the sergeant \"ought to have brought\r\nit in with him;\" and this suggests the idea that it would have been\r\nquite consistent with his duty, and perhaps not much beneath his\r\ndignity, if he had taken it in himself. (Chief Paymaster Terrell, in a\r\nletter favoring leniency, states that the coin could not have weighed\r\nless than 15 pounds.)\r\n\r\nIt must certainly be conceded that what then took place plainly warned\r\nhim that to insure the safety of this money he must either take personal\r\ncharge of it or he must at least be sure that those to whom he\r\nsurrendered it were watchful and vigilant. And yet when, a few hours\r\nlater, on the same day, upon arriving at Antelope Springs, he was\r\ninformed by the sergeant that he did not propose to take dinner there,\r\nthe paymaster almost casually said to him, \"Then you stay at the stage,\"\r\nand he himself went to a room at the station to warm himself. When, as\r\nhe went from there to the dining room, he passed the stage and saw no\r\none near it except a stock tender, a very conservative idea of duty and\r\ncare would have induced him to stop at the stage and ascertain the\r\ncondition of affairs. If he had done so, he probably would have found\r\nthe money there, and could have taken it in with him or watched it until\r\nsome of his party came out from dinner. Instead of doing this, he\r\nhimself went to the dining room, and indicated his surprise at seeing\r\nthe sergeant there by looking at him sharply. However, as he was just\r\neating his pie, nothing was said.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the thief waited for the clerk and escort, and\r\nlastly the paymaster himself, to enter the dining room before venturing\r\nto take, entirely unmolested, the valise containing the money. When it\r\nis considered that after finishing his pie the sergeant came out to\r\nthe stage so nearly the exact moment of the theft that, though badly\r\nmounted, he was able to approach near enough in pursuit of the fleeing\r\nthief to exchange revolver shots with him, it is quite apparent that the\r\nloss might have been prevented if the paymaster had remained a short\r\ntime by the stage when he saw it unprotected, or had taken the valise in\r\nwith him, or promptly diverted the attention of the sergeant from his\r\npie to the money which all had abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it is said that this loss can be charged in any degree\r\nto the neglect or default of the Government, it is answered that the\r\ndirect and immediate cause of the loss was the omission on the part of\r\nthis paymaster of the Government, in whose custody these funds were\r\nplaced, of the plainest and simplest acts of prudence and care.\r\n\r\nThe temptation is very strong to yield assent to the proposition for\r\nthe relief of a citizen from liability to the Government arising from\r\nconduct not absolutely criminal; but the bonds and the security wisely\r\nexacted by the Government from its officers to insure proper discharge\r\nof public duty will be of very limited value if everything is to be\r\nexcused except actual dishonesty.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that the interests of the public would\r\nbe better protected if fewer private bills were passed relieving\r\nofficials, upon slight and sentimental grounds, from their pecuniary\r\nresponsibilities; and the readiness with which army officers join in\r\napplications for the condonation of negligence on the part of their\r\narmy comrades does not tend, in my opinion, to maintain that regard\r\nfor discipline and that scrupulous observance of duty which should\r\ncharacterize those belonging to their honorable profession.\r\n\r\nI can not satisfy myself that the negligence made apparent in this case\r\nshould be overlooked.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 21, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 823, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Hannah C.

Brokenshaw.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the military service of the beneficiary mentioned in this\r\nbill, as derived from the records of the War Department, shows that he\r\nwas received at draft rendezvous at Jackson, Mich., on the 25th day of\r\nMarch, 1865; that he was sent to the Twenty-fourth Regiment of Michigan\r\nVolunteers on the 29th day of the same month, and that he was present\r\nwith his command, without any record of disability, from that date until\r\nthe 30th day of June, 1865, when he was mustered out with his company.\r\nIt will thus be seen that he was in the service a few days more than\r\nthree months, just at the close of the war. It is not alleged that he\r\ndid any actual fighting.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 he filed an application for pension, alleging that on the\r\nevening of the 25th of March, 1865, being the day he was received at\r\nrendezvous, he was injured in his ribs while getting into his bunk by\r\nthree other recruits, who were scuffling in the room and who jumped upon\r\nhim or crushed him against the side of his bunk.\r\n\r\nAn examination upon such application made in 1884 tended to show an\r\ninjury to his ribs, but the claim was rejected upon the ground that no\r\ninjury was incurred in the line of duty. It must be conceded that upon\r\nthe claimant's own showing he was not injured as an incident to military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAside from this objection, it is hardly possible that an injury of this\r\nkind, producing the consequences which it is alleged followed its\r\ninfliction, could have been sustained by this soldier and not in the\r\nleast interrupted the performance of his military service, though such\r\nservice was very short and probably not severe. When with this it is\r\nconsidered that eighteen years elapsed between the date of the alleged\r\ninjury and the soldier's application for pension, I am satisfied that no\r\ninjustice will be done if the disposition made of this case by the\r\nPension Bureau is allowed to stand.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 21, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 4633, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Morris T. Mantor.\"\r\n\r\nThe records in this case show that the beneficiary named in this bill\r\nenlisted on the 25th day of February, 1864, and that he was mustered out\r\nJuly 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nIt is also shown that though he was reported sick a considerable part of\r\nhis period of service there is no mention of any trouble with his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1880 he filed an application for pension, alleging dropsy\r\nand disease of his eyes, caused by an explosion of ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe case was examined in 1882 and 1883, and was again specially examined\r\nvery thoroughly and critically in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe evidence thus secured seemed to establish the fact that the\r\nclaimant's eyes were sore for many years before enlistment, and that\r\ntheir condition before that date, during his service, and after his\r\ndischarge did not materially differ. It also appeared that no\r\npensionable disability from dropsy had existed since the filing of his\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds the application was rejected, and I am convinced such\r\naction was entirely justified.\r\n\r\nThe reported conduct of the claimant on the last examination and his\r\nattempts to influence witnesses in their testimony add weight to the\r\nproposition, quite well established by the proof, that his claim to a\r\npension lacks merit.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 24, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5247, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to William H. Brimmer.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted September 5, 1864, as a\r\nwagon master, and was discharged on the 30th day of May, 1865. There is\r\nno record of any disability during his short service.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1888, nearly twenty-three years after his discharge, he\r\nfiled an application for a pension, alleging that in the fall of 1864 he\r\nwas made to carry sacks of corn, which produced a weakness of the walls\r\nof the abdomen, resulting in rupture. In an affidavit filed upon said\r\napplication the claimant testifies that he said nothing about his injury\r\nor disability to anyone while in the service and can furnish no evidence\r\nexcept his own statement.\r\n\r\nThe first and only medical evidence presented touching this claim is\r\nthat of Dr. Reynolds, who examined him in 1880 or 1881, who then came\r\nto the conclusion that the claimant was suffering from an incomplete\r\nhernia, which a few months thereafter developed in the right groin. From\r\nthis examination and testimony no hint is furnished that the injury was\r\ndue to military service, nor any intimation that it might be.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1888, a medical examination was made under direction of\r\nthe Pension Bureau, when it was found that the claimant had the general\r\nappearance of being healthy and well nourished, but that he had a small\r\nuncomplicated inguinal hernia on the right side, which was easily\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nI can not believe upon the facts presented that an injury of the\r\ncharacter alleged could have been sustained in the service and still\r\npermitted the performance of all the duties of wagon master for months\r\nthereafter, remaining undeveloped for so many years, and that there\r\nshould now be such a lack of testimony connecting it with any incident\r\nof military service.\r\n\r\nI believe the rejection of this claim was right and just upon its\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 24, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill 6908, entitled \"An act granting a\r\npension to William P. Witt.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in the bill was enrolled for one hundred days'\r\nservice on the 13th day of July, 1864, and was mustered out on the 16th\r\nday of November, in the same year. The record shows that he was reported\r\npresent on all rolls until he was mustered out.\r\n\r\nHe filed a claim for pension in 1884, alleging that he incurred chronic\r\ndiarrhea, liver disease, rheumatism, and a disease of the head affecting\r\nhis hearing during his military service. Two comrades testify to his\r\nbeing sick and being in the hospital to such an extent as to wholly\r\ndiscredit his presence with his company. A physician testifies that he\r\nprescribed for him some time in the month of November, 1864, for liver\r\ndisease and jaundice, to which rheumatism supervened, confining him six\r\nweeks or more.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a complete hiatus of any medical or other evidence\r\nconcerning his physical condition from that time until nearly twenty\r\nyears thereafter, in July, 1884, when he was examined, and it was found\r\nthat he had impaired hearing in both ears, but no symptoms of\r\nrheumatism, and that his liver was normal.\r\n\r\nWithout further detailing particulars, the entire complexion of this\r\ncase satisfies me that the claimant contracted no pensionable disability\r\nduring his one hundred days of service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 24, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 4550, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Chloe Quiggle, widow of Phillip Quiggle.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the beneficiary named enlisted February 11, 1865, and was\r\ndischarged September 27, 1865. The records show that he was reported\r\nAugust 31, 1865, as \"absent, confined in post prison at Chattanooga\r\nsince August 18, 1865.\"\r\n\r\nHe filed a claim for pension June 25, 1880, alleging that after a march\r\nfrom Chattanooga to a point 1-1/2 miles distant and back he upon his\r\nreturn drank some water, which produced diarrhea, since which time he\r\nhad been troubled also with disease of kidneys and rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHe died in September, 1882, and the claim then pending on his behalf\r\nwas completed by his widow. After a special examination the claim for\r\ndiarrhea was, on the 21st day of April, 1887, allowed from September 28,\r\n1865, to January 1, 1870, when it was shown that any disability from\r\nthis cause ceased. The claim for disease of kidneys and rheumatism was\r\nrejected upon the ground that no such disabilities were shown to be due\r\nto military service.\r\n\r\nThe widow filed a claim on her own behalf August 27, 1883, alleging the\r\ndeath of the soldier from the results of prostration by heat while\r\nmarching near Nashville, Tenn., and also from disease of kidneys,\r\nrheumatism, and chronic diarrhea.\r\n\r\nIt is reported to me that the evidence taken during a special\r\nexamination of this case established that before and after enlistment\r\nthe soldier was addicted to the excessive use of intoxicating liquors.\r\n\r\nOne physician stated to the examiner that shortly after the soldier's\r\ndischarge he found him suffering from disease of kidneys and from\r\nrheumatism and diarrhea, but that he concluded the disease of the\r\nkidneys had been coming on for a year; that it could not have been\r\ncaused by a sunstroke a few weeks previously, and that the diseases were\r\nof longer standing than that.\r\n\r\nAnother physician who attended the soldier during his last illness\r\ntestified that he did not know that he suffered from any disease until\r\nthe summer of 1882; that he found him suffering from retention of urine,\r\nand that the difficulty rapidly developed into an acute attack of\r\nBright's disease; that no indications of rheumatism were found, but that\r\nthe disease progressed steadily and was a well-marked case of Bright's\r\ndisease of the kidneys. He also testified that the origin of the disease\r\nwas no doubt recent, though possibly it might have existed in a low form\r\nfor some years.\r\n\r\nA medical examination in May, 1882, developed no disease of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that all the reliable testimony in the case tends to show\r\nbeyond a doubt that the soldier's death was not due to any incident of\r\nhis military service. I do not find that the medical testimony given by\r\nhis neighbors makes a suggestion that it was, and upon all the facts I\r\nam of the opinion that the pension which has been already allowed was a\r\nliberal disposition of the case.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is aged, and it would certainly be a\r\ngratification to grant her relief; but the question is whether we do\r\nwell to establish a precedent for the allowance of claims of this\r\ncharacter in the distribution of pension funds.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 30, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 465, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to William Sackman, sr.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill served from December 24, 1861, to\r\nFebruary 29, 1864, in the Fifth Regiment of the Missouri Militia\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\nHe was discharged on the day last named for disability. His certificate\r\nof discharge states his disability as follows:\r\n\r\n  Palpitation of the heart and defective lungs, the disability caused by\r\n  falling off his horse near Fredericktown, Mo., while intoxicated, on\r\n  detached service, in the month of September, 1862. Not having done any\r\n  duty since, a discharge would benefit the Government and himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that a claim for pension was filed in the year 1881, in which\r\nthe claimant alleged that--\r\n\r\n  At Fredericktown, Mo., about the 10th or 12th of April, 1863, he had\r\n  three ribs broken by falling from his horse while surrounded by\r\n  guerrillas.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that while the certificate of discharge mentions a fall\r\nin September, 1862, no allusion is made to any fracture of ribs, while\r\nthe claimant alleges such an injury occurred in April, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the surgeon who made the medical certificate attached to the\r\ndischarge, in answer to an inquiry made by the Commissioner of Pensions,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  I have to state that I remember the case very distinctly. I made the\r\n  examination in person, and was thoroughly acquainted with the case. I\r\n  read the statement on which the application for discharge was based to\r\n  the man, and he consented to have the papers forwarded as they read.\r\n  The application for pension is fraudulent and should not be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have omitted references made to the habits of the soldier by this\r\nmedical officer.\r\n\r\nOf course much reliance should be placed upon these statements made by\r\nan officer whose business it was to know the exact facts, and who made\r\nhis certificate at a time when such facts were fresh in his mind. There\r\nis no intimation that the surgeon who made the statement referred to was\r\ninimical to the soldier or influenced by any unjust motive.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to impeach the record thus made is based upon affidavits\r\nmade by a number of the soldier's comrades, who testify to his character\r\nand habits, and only three of whom speak of an injury to the soldier\r\ncaused by falling from his horse. Two of these affiants allege that they\r\nwere with the claimant on detached duty when his horse took fright and\r\nran away with him, injuring him so that he could not rise and get on his\r\nhorse without assistance. So far as these affidavits are before me, no\r\ndate of this occurrence is given, nothing is said as to the character of\r\nthe injuries, and no reference is made to the condition of the soldier\r\nat the time. The third affiant, who speaks of an injury, says that it\r\noccurred while on duty on the march from Pilot Knob to Cape Girardeau,\r\nin the year 1862 or 1863, and that it was caused by the soldier's being\r\nthrown from his horse. He says further that the soldier was not\r\nintoxicated at that time.\r\n\r\nNo mention is made that I can discover of any fracture of the ribs\r\nexcept in the claimant's application for pension made in 1881, seventeen\r\nyears after his discharge, and in a report of an examining surgeon made\r\nin 1882.\r\n\r\nWith no denial of the soldier's condition, as stated by the surgeon,\r\non the part of the only parties who claim to have been present at\r\nthe time of the injury, I can not satisfy myself, in view of the other\r\ncircumstances surrounding this case, that the allegations contained in\r\nthe claimant's discharge are discredited.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 30, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 838, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mary Sullivan.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of July, 1886, an act was approved which is an exact copy\r\nof the one herewith returned.

Wilson, administrator of the estate of William Tinder,\r\ndeceased.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this bill is to refund to the estate of William Tinder\r\nthe sum of $5,000, which was paid to the Government by his administrator\r\nin June, 1880, upon the following facts:\r\n\r\nIn 1876 two indictments were found against one Evans, charging him with\r\npassing counterfeit money. In May, 1878, he was tried upon one of said\r\nindictments and the jury failed to agree. Thereupon the prisoner entered\r\ninto two recognizances in the sum of $5,000 each, with W.R. Evans and\r\nWilliam Tinder as sureties, conditioned for the appearance of the\r\nprisoner Evans at the next term of the court, in November, 1878, for\r\ntrial upon said indictment. Before that date, however, the prisoner fled\r\nthe country and failed to appear according to the condition of his bond.\r\nIn the meantime William Tinder died and H.B. Wilson was appointed his\r\nadministrator.\r\n\r\nSuits were brought upon the two bail bonds, and, the liability of the\r\nsureties not being admitted, the suits were tried in March, 1880,\r\nresulting in two judgments in favor of the United States and against the\r\nsurety Evans and the estate of Tinder for $5,000 each and the costs.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter an application was made by the administrator of the\r\nestate of William Tinder for relief, and an offer was made by him to pay\r\n$5,000 and the costs in compromise and settlement of the liability of\r\nsaid estate upon said two judgments.\r\n\r\nThese judgments were a preferred claim against the estate, which was\r\nrepresented to be worth sixteen or eighteen thousand dollars. The other\r\nsurety, Evans, was alleged to be worthless, and it was claimed that\r\nneither the administrator of the Tinder estate nor his attorneys had\r\nknown the whereabouts of the indicted party since his flight, and that\r\nsome time would elapse before certain litigation in which the estate was\r\ninvolved could be settled and the claims against it paid.\r\n\r\nIt was considered best by the officers of the Government to accept the\r\nproposition of the administrator, which was done in June, 1880. The sum\r\nof $5,099.06, the amount of one of said judgments, with interest and\r\ncosts, was paid into the United States Treasury, and the estate of\r\nTinder was in consideration thereof released and discharged from all\r\nliability upon both of said judgments.\r\n\r\nThus was the transaction closed, in exact accordance with the wishes and\r\nthe prayer of the representative of this estate and by the favor and\r\nindulgence of the Government upon his application. There was, so far as\r\nI can learn, no condition attached, and no understanding or agreement\r\nthat any future occurrence would affect the finality of the compromise\r\nby which the Government had accepted one-half of its claim in full\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in 1881 the party indicted was arrested and brought to\r\ntrial, which resulted in his conviction; and apparently for this reason\r\nalone it is proposed by the bill under consideration to open the\r\nsettlement made at the request of the administrator and refund to him\r\nthe sum which he paid on such settlement pursuant to his own offer.\r\n\r\nI can see no fairness or justice to the Government in such a proposition.\r\nI do not find any statement that the administrator delivered the\r\nprisoner to the United States authorities for trial. On the contrary, it\r\nappears from an examination made in the First Comptroller's Office that\r\nhe was arrested by the marshal on the 25th day of May, 1881, who charged\r\nand was paid his fees therefor. And if the administrator had surrendered\r\nthe prisoner to justice it would not entitle him to the repayment of the\r\nmoney he has paid to compromise the two judgments against him.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to relieve from contracts with the Government upon\r\nplausible application is, in my opinion, not sufficiently resisted;\r\nbut to refund money paid into the public Treasury upon such a liberal\r\ncompromise as is exhibited in this case seems like a departure from all\r\nbusiness principles and an unsafe concession that the interests of the\r\nGovernment are to be easily surrendered.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 3, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 4534, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Emily G. Mills.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this bill is to provide a pension for the beneficiary\r\nnamed therein as the widow of Oscar B. Mills, late a second assistant\r\nengineer, retired, in the United States Navy. The deceased was appointed\r\nan acting third assistant engineer in October, 1862, and in 1864 he was\r\npromoted to the place of second assistant engineer.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that while in active service he did his full duty, though\r\nI am not informed of any distinguished acts of bravery or heroism. In\r\nFebruary, 1871, he was before a naval retiring board, which found that\r\nhe was incapacitated for active service on account of malarious fever,\r\ncontracted in 1868, and recommended that he be allowed six months' leave\r\nof absence to recover his health.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1871, he was again examined for retirement, and the board\r\nfound that he was not in any way incapacitated from performing the\r\nduties of his office. The next year, in 1872, another retiring board,\r\nupon an examination of his case, found that he was \"laboring under\r\ngeneral debility, the effect of intermittent fever acting upon an\r\noriginally delicate constitution,\" and he was thereupon placed upon the\r\nretired list of the Navy.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th day of August, 1873, he was accidentally shot and killed by\r\na neighbor, who was attempting to shoot an owl.\r\n\r\nAs long as there is the least pretense of limiting the bestowal of\r\npensions to disability or death in some way related to the incidents of\r\nmilitary and naval service, claims of this description can not\r\nconsistently be allowed.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 1406, entitled \"An act to\r\nprovide for the sale of certain New York Indian lands in Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 1838 a number of bands and tribes of New York\r\nIndians had obtained 500,000 acres of land in the State of Wisconsin,\r\nupon which they proposed to reside. In the year above named a treaty was\r\nentered into between the United States and these Indians whereby they\r\nrelinquished to the Government these Wisconsin lands. In consideration\r\nthereof, and, as the treaty declares, \"in order to manifest the deep\r\ninterest of the United States in the future peace and prosperity of\r\nthe New York Indians,\" it was agreed there should be set apart as a\r\npermanent home for all the New York Indians then residing in the State\r\nof New York, or in Wisconsin, or elsewhere in the United States, who\r\nhad no permanent home, a tract of land amounting to 1,824,000 acres,\r\ndirectly west of the State of Missouri, and now included in the State\r\nof Kansas--being 320 acres for each Indian, as their number was then\r\ncomputed--\"to have and to hold the same in fee simple to the said tribes\r\nor nations of Indians by patent from the President of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nFull power and authority was also given to said Indians \"to divide said\r\nlands among the different tribes, nations, or bands in severalty,\" with\r\nthe right to sell and convey to and from each other under such rules and\r\nregulations as should be adopted by said Indians in their respective\r\ntribes or in general council.\r\n\r\nThe treaty further provided that such of the tribes of these Indians as\r\ndid not accept said treaty and agree to remove to the country set apart\r\nfor their new homes within five years or such other time as the\r\nPresident might from time to time appoint should forfeit all interest\r\nin the land so set apart to the United States; and the Government\r\nguaranteed to protect and defend them in the peaceable possession and\r\nenjoyment of their new homes.\r\n\r\nI have no positive information that any considerable number of these\r\nIndians removed to the lands provided for them within the five years\r\nlimited by the treaty. Their omission to do so may have been owing to\r\nthe failure of the Government to appropriate the money to pay the\r\nexpense of such removal, as it agreed to do in the treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, stated in a letter of the Secretary of the Interior\r\ndated April 6, 1878, contained in the report of the Senate committee to\r\nwhom the bill under consideration was referred, that in the year 1842\r\nsome of these Indians settled upon the lands described in the treaty;\r\nand it is further alleged in said report that in 1846 about two hundred\r\nmore of them were removed to said lands.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the Secretary of the Interior above referred to contains\r\nthe following statement concerning these Indian occupants:\r\n\r\n  From death and the hostility of the settlers, who were drawn in that\r\n  direction by the fertility of the soil and other advantages, all of the\r\n  Indians gradually relinquished their selections, until of the Indians\r\n  who had removed thither from the State of New York only thirty-two\r\n  remained in 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the following further statement is made:\r\n\r\n  The files of the Indian Office show abundant proof that they did not\r\n  voluntarily relinquish their occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proof thus referred to is indeed abundant, and is found in official\r\nreports and affidavits made as late as the year 1859. By these it\r\nappears that during that year, in repeated instances, Indian men and\r\nwidows of deceased Indians were driven from their homes by the threats\r\nof armed men; that in one case at least the habitation of an Indian\r\nwoman was burned, and that the kind of outrages were resorted to which\r\ntoo often follow the cupidity of whites and the possession of fertile\r\nlands by defenseless and unprotected Indians.\r\n\r\nAn agent, in an official letter dated August 9, 1859, after detailing\r\nthe cruel treatment of these occupants of the lands which the Government\r\nhad given them, writes:\r\n\r\n  Since these Indians have been placed under my charge, which was, I\r\n  think, in 1855, I have endeavored to protect them; but complaint after\r\n  complaint has reached me, and I have reported their situation again and\r\n  again; and I hope that it will not be long when the Indians who are\r\n  entitled to land under the decision of the Indian Office shall have it\r\n  set apart to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same agent, under date of January 18, 1860, referring to these\r\nIndians, declares:\r\n\r\n  These Indians have been driven off their land and claims upon the New\r\n  York tract by the whites, and they are now very much scattered and many\r\n  of them are very destitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was found in 1860 that of all the Indians who had prior to that\r\ndate selected and occupied part of these lands but thirty-two remained,\r\nand it seems to have been deemed but justice to them to confirm their\r\nselections by some kind of governmental grant or declaration, though\r\nit does not appear that any of them had been able to maintain actual\r\npossession of all their selected lands against white intrusion. Thus\r\ncertain special commissioners appointed to examine this subject, under\r\ndate of May 29, 1860, make the following statement:\r\n\r\n  In this connection it may be proper to remark that many of the tracts\r\n  so selected were claimed by lawless men who had compelled the Indians\r\n  to abandon them under threats of violence; but we are confident that no\r\n  serious injury will be done to anyone, as the improvements are of but\r\n  little value.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 14th day of September, 1860, certificates were issued to the\r\nthirty-two Indians who had made selections of lands and who still\r\nsurvived, with a view of securing to them such selections and at the\r\nsame time granting to them the number of acres which it was provided\r\nthey should have by the treaty of 1838. These certificates were made\r\nby the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and declared that in conformity\r\nwith the provisions of the treaty of 1838 there had been assigned and\r\nallotted to the person named therein 320 acres of the land designated in\r\nsaid treaty, which land was particularly described in said certificates,\r\nwhich concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n  And the selection of said tract for the exclusive use and benefit of\r\n  said reserve, having been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, is\r\n  not subject to be alienated in fee, leased, or otherwise disposed of\r\n  except to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated September 13, 1860, from the Indian Commissioner to\r\nthe agent in the neighborhood of these lands reference is made to the\r\nconduct of white intruders upon the same, and the following instructions\r\nwere given to said agent:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of these representations and the fact that these white persons\r\nwho are in possession of the land are intruders, I have to direct\r\nthat you will visit the New York Reserve in Kansas at your earliest\r\nconvenience, accompanied by those Indians living among the Osages to\r\nwhom said lands have been allotted, with a view to place them in\r\npossession of the lands to which they are entitled; and if you should\r\nmeet with any forcible resistance from white settlers you will report\r\ntheir names to this office, in order that appropriate action may be\r\ntaken in the premises, and you will inform them that if they do not\r\nimmediately abandon said lands they will be removed by force. When you\r\nshall have given the thirty-two Indians peaceable possession of their\r\nlands, or attempted to do so and have been prevented by forcible\r\nresistance, you will make a report of your action to this Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Indian Bureau do not disclose that any report was\r\never made by the agent to whom these instructions were given.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 and 1862 mention was made by the agents of the destitute\r\ncondition of these Indians and of their being deprived of their lands,\r\nand in these years petitions were presented in their behalf asking that\r\njustice be done them on account of the failure of the Government to\r\nprovide them with homes.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and in December, 1860, the remainder of the reserve not\r\nallotted to the thirty-two survivors was thrown open to settlement by\r\nExecutive proclamation. Of course this was followed by increased\r\nconflict between the settlers and the Indians. It is presumed that it\r\nbecame dangerous for those to whom lands had been allotted to attempt to\r\ngain possession of them. On the 4th day of December, 1865, Agent Snow\r\nreturned twenty-seven of the certificates of allotment which had not\r\nbeen delivered, and wrote as follows to the Indian Bureau:\r\n\r\n  A few of these Indians were at one time put in possession of their\r\n  lands. They were driven off by the whites; one Indian was killed, others\r\n  wounded, and their houses burned. White men at this time have possession\r\n  of these lands, and have valuable improvements on them. The Indians are\r\n  deterred even asking for possession. I would earnestly ask, as agent for\r\n  these wronged and destitute people, that some measure be adopted by the\r\n  Government to give these Indians their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn official report made to the Secretary of the Interior dated February\r\n16, 1871, gives the history of these lands, and concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n  These lands are now all or nearly all occupied by white persons who have\r\n  driven the Indians from their homes--in some instances with violence.\r\n  There is great necessity that some relief should be afforded to them by\r\n  legislation of Congress, authorizing the issue of patents to the\r\n  allottees or giving them power to sell and convey.\r\n\r\n  In this way they will be enabled to realize something from the land, and\r\n  the occupants can secure titles for their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently in the line of this recommendation, and in an attempt to\r\nremedy the condition of affairs then existing, an act was passed on the\r\n19th day of February, 1873, permitting heads of families and single\r\npersons over 21 years of age who had made settlements and improvements\r\nupon and were _bona fide_ claimants and occupants of the lands for\r\nwhich the thirty-two certificates of allotments were issued to enter and\r\npurchase at the proper land office such lands so occupied by them, not\r\nexceeding 160 acres, upon paying therefor the appraised value of said\r\ntracts respectively, to be ascertained by three disinterested and\r\ncompetent appraisers, to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nwho should report the value of such lands, exclusive of improvements,\r\nbut that no sale should be made under said act for less than $3.75 per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nIt was further provided that the entries allowed should be made within\r\ntwelve months after the promulgation by the Secretary of the Interior of\r\nregulations to carry said act into effect, and that the money arising\r\nupon such sales should be paid into the Treasury of the United States\r\nin trust for and to be paid to the Indians respectively to whom such\r\ncertificates of allotment had been issued, or to their heirs, upon\r\nsatisfactory proof of their identity, at any time within five years from\r\nthe passage of the act, and that in default of such proof the money\r\nshould become a part of the public moneys of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was also further provided that any Indian to whom any certificate of\r\nallotment had been issued, and who was then occupying the land allotted\r\nthereby, should be entitled to receive a patent therefor.\r\n\r\nPursuant to this statute these lands were appraised. The lowest value\r\nper acre fixed by the appraisers was $3.75, and the highest was $10,\r\nmaking the average for the whole $4.90 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that only eight pieces, containing 879.76 acres of land\r\ntaken from six of these Indian allotments, were sold under this statute\r\nto the settlers thereon, producing the sum of $4,058.06, and that the\r\nprice paid in no case was less than $4.50 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by the bill under consideration to sell the remainder of\r\nthis allotted land to those who failed to avail themselves of the law of\r\n1873 for the sum of $2.50 per acre.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the effect of the action of the Indian Bureau in\r\nissuing certificates of allotment to individual Indians as it relates to\r\nthe title of the lands described therein, it was the only way that the\r\nGovernment could perform its treaty obligation to furnish homes for any\r\nnumber of Indians less than a tribe or band; and if these allotments did\r\nnot vest a title in these individual Indians they secured to them such\r\nrights to the lands as the Government was bound to protect and which it\r\ncould not refuse to confirm if it became necessary by the issuance of\r\npatents therefor.\r\n\r\nThese rights are fully recognized by the statute of 1873, as well as by\r\nthe bill under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe right and power of the Government to divest these allottees of their\r\ninterests under their certificates is so questionable that perhaps it\r\ncould only be done under the plan proposed, through an estoppel arising\r\nfrom the acceptance of the price for which their allotted lands were\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the effect of a compliance with the provisions of this bill\r\nwould be upon the title of the settlers to these lands, I can see no\r\nfairness or justice in permitting them to enter and purchase such lands\r\nat a sum much less than their appraised value in 1873 and for hardly\r\none-half the price paid by their neighbors under the law passed in that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe occupancy upon these lands of the settlers seeking relief, and of\r\ntheir grantors, is based upon wrong, violence, and oppression. A\r\ncontinuation of the wrongful exclusion of these Indians from their lands\r\nshould not inure to the benefit of the wrongdoers. The opportunities\r\nafforded by the law of 1873 were neglected, perhaps, in the hope and\r\nbelief that death would remove the Indians who by their appeals for\r\njustice annoyed those who had driven them from their homes, and perhaps\r\nin the expectation that the heedlessness of the Government concerning\r\nits obligations to the Indians would supply easier terms. The idea is\r\ntoo prevalent that, as against those who by emigration and settlement\r\nupon our frontier extend our civilization and prosperity, the rights of\r\nthe Indians are of but little consequence. But it must be absolutely\r\ntrue that no development is genuine or valuable based upon the violence\r\nand cruelty of individuals or the faithlessness of a government.\r\n\r\nWhile it might not result in exact justice or precisely rectify the\r\nwrong committed, it may well be that in existing circumstances the\r\ninterests of the allottees or their heirs demand an adjustment of the\r\nkind now proposed. But their lands certainly are worth much more than\r\nthey were in 1873, and the settlers, if they are not subjected to a\r\nreappraisement, should at least pay the price at which the lands were\r\nappraised in that year.\r\n\r\nIf the holders of the interests of the allottees have such a title as\r\nwill give them a standing in the courts of Kansas, I do not think they\r\nneed fear defeat by being charged with improvements under the occupying\r\nclaimants' act, for it has been decided in a case to be found in the\r\ntwentieth volume of Kansas Reports, at page 374, that--\r\n\r\n  Neither the title nor possession of the Indian owner, secured by\r\n  treaty with the United States Government, can be disturbed by State\r\n  legislation; and the occupying claimants' act has no application in\r\n  this case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet the delay, uncertainty, and expense of legal contests should be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nI suggest that any bill which is passed to adjust the rights of these\r\nIndians by such a general plan as is embodied in the bill herewith\r\nreturned should provide for the payment by the settlers within a\r\nreasonable time of an appraised value, and that in case the same is not\r\npaid by the respective occupants that the lands be sold at public\r\nauction for a price not less than the appraisement.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 9, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 4357, entitled \"An act to erect\r\na public building at Allentown, Pa.\"\r\n\r\nThe accommodation of the postal business is the only public purpose for\r\nwhich the Government can be called on to provide, which is suggested as\r\na pretext for the erection of this building. It is proposed to expend\r\n$100,000 for a structure to be used as a post-office. It is said that a\r\ndeputy collector of internal revenue and a board of pension examiners\r\nare located at Allentown, but I do not understand that the Government is\r\nobliged to provide quarters for these officers.\r\n\r\nThe usual statement is made in support of this bill setting forth the\r\ngrowth of the city where it is proposed to locate the building and the\r\namount and variety of the business which is there transacted; and the\r\npostmaster in stereotyped phrase represents the desirability of\r\nincreased accommodation for the transaction of the business under his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nBut I am thoroughly convinced that there is no present necessity for the\r\nexpenditure of $100,000 for any purpose connected with the public\r\nbusiness at this place.\r\n\r\nThe annual rent now paid for the post-office is $1,300.\r\n\r\nThe interest, at 3 per cent, upon the amount now asked for this\r\nnew building is $3,000. As soon as it is undertaken the pay of a\r\nsuperintendent of its construction will begin, and after its completion\r\nthe compensation of janitors and other expenses of its maintenance will\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe plan now pursued for the erection of public buildings is, in my\r\nopinion, very objectionable. They are often built where they are not\r\nneeded, of dimensions and at a cost entirely disproportionate to any\r\npublic use to which they can be applied, and as a consequence they\r\nfrequently serve more to demonstrate the activity and pertinacity of\r\nthose who represent localities desiring this kind of decoration at\r\npublic expense than to meet any necessity of the Government.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 10, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 7715, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Georgia A. Stricklett.\"\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this bill a pension is allowed to the beneficiary above\r\nnamed, whose husband died on the 21st day of July, 1873. It appears from\r\nthe records that he was mustered into the service to date from October\r\n10, 1863, to serve for one year. It is alleged in the report of the\r\ncommittee of the House who reported this bill that he was wounded with\r\nbuckshot in the face and head by bushwhackers, when on recruiting\r\nservice, on the 23d day of July, 1863. If these dates are correct, he\r\nwas wounded before he entered the service; but this fact is not made the\r\nbasis of the disapproval of the widow's application for relief. There\r\nseems, however, to be no mention of any such injury during his term of\r\nservice, though he is reported sick much of the time when present with\r\nhis regiment, and is reported as once in hospital for a disease which,\r\nto say the least of it, can not be recognized as related to the service.\r\n\r\nThe soldier himself made no application for pension.\r\n\r\nA physician testifies that he was present on the 21st day of July, 1873,\r\nwhen the soldier died; that he examined the body after death, and to the\r\nbest of his knowledge such death was caused partially by epilepsy, and\r\nthat the epilepsy was the result of \"wounds about the face and head\r\nreceived during his service during the war.\"\r\n\r\nAnother physician testifies that the soldier applied to him for\r\ntreatment in 1868, and that his disability was the development of\r\nconfirmed epilepsy, and he expresses the opinion that this was due to a\r\nwound from a buckshot. This physician, while not giving epilepsy as the\r\ncause of death, says that \"had he lived to die a natural death he\r\ncertainly would have died an insane epileptic.\"\r\n\r\nThe report speaks of his death by \"an accidental shot.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth appears to be that he was killed by a pistol shot in an\r\naltercation with another man.\r\n\r\nUnless it shall be assumed that the epilepsy was caused by the buckshot\r\nwound spoken of, and unless a pension should be allowed because, if the\r\nsoldier had not been killed in an altercation, he might have soon died\r\nfrom such epilepsy, this bill is entirely devoid of merit.\r\n\r\nSurely no one will seriously propose that a claim for pension should\r\nrest upon a conjecture as to what would have caused death if it had not\r\noccurred in an entirely different way.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the physician who testified in this case that death was\r\ncaused partially by epilepsy suggests the extreme recklessness which may\r\ncharacterize medical testimony in applications for pension.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 18, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 2282, entitled \"An act to\r\npension Mrs. Theodora M. Piatt.\"\r\n\r\nThe deceased husband of the beneficiary named in this bill served\r\nfaithfully and well in the volunteer service, and after his discharge as\r\nmajor entered the Regular Army and was on the retired list at the time\r\nof his death, which occurred on the 17th day of April, 1885. At that\r\ntime he seems to have been engaged in the practice of the law at\r\nCovington, Ky.\r\n\r\nHe does not appear to have contracted any distinct and definite\r\ndisability in his army service, though his health and strength were\r\ndoubtless somewhat impaired by hardship and exposure.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that he committed suicide by shooting himself with a\r\npistol.\r\n\r\nA coroner's inquest was held and the following verdict was returned:\r\n\r\n  Benjamin M. Piatt came to his death from a pistol bullet through the\r\n  brain, fired from a pistol in his own hand, with suicidal intent,\r\n  while laboring under a fit of temporary insanity, caused by morbid\r\n  sensitiveness of wasted opportunities and constantly brooding over\r\n  imaginary troubles and financial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said in support of his widow's claim for pension that, being lame\r\nas a result, in part at least, of his military service, he, by reason of\r\nsuch lameness, fell from a staircase a few months before his death, the\r\ninjury from which affected his mind, causing insanity, which in its turn\r\nresulted in his suicide.\r\n\r\nMuch interest is manifested in this case, based upon former friendship\r\nand intimacy with the deceased and kind feeling and sympathy for his\r\nwidow. I should be glad to respond to these sentiments to the extent of\r\napproving this bill, but it is one of the misfortunes of public life and\r\nofficial responsibility that a sense of duty frequently stands between a\r\nconception of right and a sympathetic inclination.\r\n\r\nThe verdict returned upon the coroner's inquest, founded upon a friendly\r\nexamination of all the facts surrounding the melancholy death of this\r\nsoldier, made at the time of death and in the midst of his neighbors and\r\nfriends, both by what it contains and by what is omitted, together with\r\nthe other facts developed, leads me to the conclusion that if a pension\r\nis granted in this case no soldier's widow's application based upon\r\nsuicide can be consistently rejected.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 18, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5545, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Nancy F. Jennings.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Jennings, the husband of the beneficiary named in this bill,\r\nenlisted in October, 1861, and was discharged June 24, 1862, upon a\r\nsurgeon's certificate of disability, the cause of disability being\r\ntherein stated as \"hemorrhoids.\"\r\n\r\nHe never applied for a pension, and died in 1877 of apoplexy.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the committee which reported this bill the allegation\r\nis made that the deceased came home from the Army with chronic diarrhea\r\nand suffered from the same to the date of his death.\r\n\r\nThe widow filed a claim for pension in 1878, which was rejected on the\r\nground that the fatal disease (apoplexy) was not due to military service\r\nnor the result of either of the complaints mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf we are to adhere to the rule that in order to entitle the widow of a\r\nsoldier to a pension the death of her husband must be in some way\r\nrelated to his military service, there can be no doubt that upon its\r\nmerits this case was properly disposed of by the Pension Bureau.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 18, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval a joint resolution, which originated in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, \"authorizing the use and improvement of Castle\r\nIsland, in Boston Harbor.\"\r\n\r\nThis island is separated from the mainland of the city of Boston by a\r\nchannel over one-half mile wide. Fort Independence is located on the\r\nisland, and it is regarded by our military authorities as quite\r\nimportant to the defense of the city.\r\n\r\nThe proposition contained in the joint resolution is to permit the city\r\nof Boston, through its park commissioners, to improve and beautify this\r\nisland in connection with a public park to be laid out in the city, with\r\nthe intention of joining the mainland and the island by the construction\r\nof a viaduct or causeway across the water now separating the same.\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain that the occupancy of this island as a place of\r\npleasure and recreation, as contemplated under this resolution, would be\r\nentirely inconsistent with military or defensive uses. I do not regard\r\nthe control reserved in the resolution to the Secretary of War over such\r\nexcavations, fillings, and structures upon the island as may be proposed\r\nas of much importance. When a park is established there, the island is\r\nno longer a defense in time of need.\r\n\r\nThis scheme, or one of the same character, was broached more than four\r\nyears ago, and met the disapproval of the Secretary of War and the\r\nEngineer Department.\r\n\r\nI am now advised by the Secretary of War, the Chief of Engineers, and\r\nthe Lieutenant-General of the Army, in quite positive terms, that the\r\nresolution under consideration should not, for reasons fully stated by\r\nthem, become operative.\r\n\r\nI deem the opinions of these officers abundant justification for my\r\ndisapproval of the resolution without further statement of objections.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 18, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_.\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1064, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of L.J. Worden.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the Postmaster-General to allow to L.J. Worden,\r\nrecently the postmaster at Lawrence, Kans., the sum of $625 paid out by\r\nhim as such postmaster for clerk hire during the period from July 1,\r\n1882, to June 30, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe allowances to these officers for clerk hire and other like expenses\r\nare fixed in each case by the Post-Office Department and are paid out of\r\nan appropriation made in gross to cover them all. The excess of receipts\r\nfor box rents and commissions over and above the salary of the\r\npostmaster is adopted by law as the maximum amount of such allowances in\r\neach case, and within that limit the amount appropriated is apportioned\r\nby the Post-Office Department to the different offices according to\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\nThe allowances to the Lawrence post-office for the year ending June 30,\r\n1883, was $3,100. This was fully its proportion of the appropriation\r\nmade by Congress for that year, and as much as was in most cases given\r\nto other offices of the same grade. In September, 1882, during the\r\nfirst quarter of the year in question, the postmaster made application\r\nfor an increase of his allowances, which was declined, and a similar\r\napplication in December of the same year was also declined. The reason\r\ngiven for noncompliance with this request in both cases was a lack of\r\nfunds. It is the rule to make only such allowances in any year as can\r\nbe paid from the appropriation made for that period.\r\n\r\nNo further application for increase of allowances was made by Mr. Worden\r\nuntil March, 1884, when the same were increased $300 for the year, to\r\ndate from the 1st day of January preceding.\r\n\r\nIt was found at that time, after a full and fair investigation by the\r\nDepartment, which had in hand abundant funds for an increase of these\r\nallowances, that notwithstanding the increase of business at this\r\npost-office, $300 added to the allowances for the year from July 1,\r\n1882, to June 30, 1883, was sufficient; and yet more than twice that sum\r\nis added by the bill under consideration to the allowances for the year\r\nlast named.\r\n\r\nForty-four postmasters have submitted vouchers, amounting to nearly\r\n$9,000, for clerk hire during that year in excess of allowances; but\r\nthey were all rejected, and I understand have not been insisted upon.\r\n\r\nI assume that the Post-Office Department in 1884 dealt justly and fairly\r\nby the postmaster at Lawrence, and upon this theory, if he should be\r\nreimbursed any expenditure for a previous year, the demand he now makes\r\nis excessive.\r\n\r\nBut the cases should be exceedingly rare in which postmasters are\r\nawarded any more than the allowances made by the Department officers.\r\nThey have the very best means of ascertaining the amount necessary to\r\nmeet the demands of the service in any particular case, and it certainly\r\nmay be assumed that they desire to properly accommodate the public in\r\nthe matter of postal facilities. When the appropriation is sufficient,\r\nthe decision of the Department should be final; and when the money in\r\nhand does not admit of adequate allowances, postmasters should only be\r\nreimbursed money voluntarily expended by them when recommended by the\r\nPostmaster-General.\r\n\r\nAny other course leads to the expenditure of money by postmasters for\r\nwork which they should do themselves and to the employment of clerks\r\nwhich are unnecessary. The least encouragement that they may be repaid\r\nsuch expenditure by a special appropriation would dangerously tend to\r\nthe substitution of their judgment for that of the Department and to the\r\nrelaxation of wholesome discipline.\r\n\r\nI think, when the application of Mr. Worden for an increase in his\r\nallowances was twice declined for any cause during the year covering his\r\npresent demand, that if he made personal expenditures for clerk hire,\r\nand especially if he did so without the encouragement of the Department,\r\nthey were made at his own risk. It appears, too, that the amount of his\r\nclaim is larger than can be justified in any event.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time allowed the Executive by the Constitution for the examination\r\nof bills presented to him by Congress for his action expired in the case\r\nof the bill herewith returned on Saturday, May 19.

No\r\naction was taken.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 88, entitled \"An act granting a\r\npension to Sally A. Randall.\"\r\n\r\nAntipas Taber enlisted in the War of 1812 and was discharged in the year\r\n1814. There is no claim made that he received any injury in the Army or\r\nthat his death, which happened long after his discharge, was in the\r\nslightest degree related to his military service. It does not appear\r\nthat he ever made any application for a pension or was ever upon the\r\npension rolls. He died at Trinidad, in the island of Cuba, April 11,\r\n1831, leaving as his widow the beneficiary mentioned in this bill. About\r\ntwenty-two years after his death, and in February, 1853, she married\r\nAlbert Randall, and twenty years thereafter, in October, 1873, Randall\r\ndied, leaving her again a widow.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged in the report of the committee in the House to which this\r\nbill was referred that Mrs. Randall is a worthy woman, 75 years of age,\r\nin needy circumstances, with health much impaired, and that the petition\r\nfor her relief was signed by prominent citizens of Norwich, Conn., where\r\nshe now resides.\r\n\r\nAll this certainly commends her case to the kindness and benevolence of\r\nthe citizens mentioned, and the State of Connecticut ought not to allow\r\nher to be in needy circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, however, that it would establish a bad precedent to\r\nprovide for her from the Federal Treasury. From the statement of her\r\npresent age she must have been born during the time of her first\r\nhusband's enlistment. She knew nothing of his military service except as\r\nthe same may have been detailed to her. Her first widowhood had no\r\nconnection with any incident or condition of health traceable to such\r\nservice, and her second husband, with whom she lived for twenty years,\r\nnever entered the military service of the Government.\r\n\r\nI do not see how the relief proposed can be granted in this case without\r\nan unjustifiable departure from the rules under which applications for\r\npension should be determined.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 879, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Royal J. Hiar.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted November 11, 1861, in the\r\nFirst Regiment of Michigan Engineers and Mechanics. He is reported as\r\nabsent without proper authority from May 24, 1862, to January 15, 1863,\r\nwhen he was discharged by reason of varicose veins of the left leg and\r\nthigh, claimed to have existed before enlistment.\r\n\r\nHe filed a claim for pension August 30, 1876, alleging disease of the\r\nright side and hip, due to typhoid pneumonia, contracted while repairing\r\na hospital tent in March, 1862.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of this disease. The proof he furnishes of the same\r\nis extremely slight, though he was furnished ample opportunity. The\r\ndisability of which he complains has no natural relation to the sickness\r\nhe claims to have had during his service, but is quite a natural result\r\nof \"an injury while logging,\" to which some of the witnesses examined in\r\na special examination of the case attribute it.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5234, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Cyrenius G. Stryker.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted for nine months in\r\nSeptember, 1862, and was discharged June 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nHis enlistment was in Company A, Thirtieth New Jersey Regiment. The bill\r\nproposes to pension him as \"a private in Company A, Thirtieth Regiment\r\nNew York Volunteers.\"\r\n\r\nHe alleges that he was pushed or fell from the platform of a car in\r\nwhich he was transported to Washington after enlistment and injured his\r\nspine. On the claim which he presented to the Pension Bureau in June,\r\n1879, repeated medical examinations failed to reveal any disability from\r\nthe cause alleged, and after a special examination his claim was\r\nrejected because, with the assistance of such special examination, the\r\nclaimant did not prove the origin of alleged injury in service and the\r\nline of duty or a pensionable degree of disability therefrom since\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nThe evidence now offered in support of this claim appears to have\r\nreference to a time long anterior to its rejection by the Pension Bureau\r\nin 1886, and does not impeach the finding of the Bureau that at the\r\nlatter date there existed no pensionable disability.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 3579, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Ellen Shea.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary is an old lady and a widow. Her son, Michael Shea,\r\nenlisted in January, 1862. The records show that he was sick on one or\r\ntwo occasions during his service. He is also reported as a deserter and\r\nabsent without leave and in arrest and confinement fully as often as he\r\nwas sick. He was discharged January 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nNo application for a pension has been made on his behalf. The mother\r\nfiled a claim for pension in July, 1884, alleging that her son\r\ncontracted a fever in the service which resulted in insanity, which was\r\nthe cause of his death on the 10th day of March, 1884.\r\n\r\nHe was killed by a snow slide in the State of Colorado. The only hint\r\nthat his death was in any way connected with the service is the\r\nsuggestion that not having the proper use of his mind he wandered away\r\nand was killed.\r\n\r\nHis mother now lives in Chicago and, I suppose, lived there at the\r\ntime of her son's death. There is very little evidence offered of any\r\nunsoundness of mind, and his death occurring at Woodstock, Colo., it is\r\nhardly to be supposed that he wandered that far. And as tending to show\r\nthat unsoundness of mind had nothing to do with his death it may be\r\nmentioned that an attorney having the mother's application for pension\r\nin charge withdrew from the case in October, 1884, for the reason that,\r\nhaving made inquiries at the place where the soldier was killed, he\r\nfound that his death was caused by a snow slide, and that he was\r\ninformed that a number of other persons lost their lives at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 8164, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to William H. Hester.\"\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that the beneficiary named in this bill was injured by\r\nsand blowing in his eyes during a sand storm while in the service in the\r\nyear 1869, resulting in nearly if not quite total blindness.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded in the report of the committee to which this bill was\r\nreferred in the House that the claim for pension made by this man to the\r\nPension Bureau was largely supported by perjury and forgery; but the\r\ncriminality of these methods is made to rest upon three rogues and\r\nscoundrels who undertook to obtain a pension for the soldier, and it is\r\nstated by the committee as their opinion that the claimant himself was\r\ninnocent of any complicity in the crimes committed and attempted.\r\n\r\nI have quite a full report of the papers filed and proceedings taken in\r\nrelation to the claim presented to the Pension Bureau, and I am sorry\r\nthat I can not agree with the committee of the House as to the merits of\r\nthe application now made or the good faith and honesty of the\r\nbeneficiary named in the bill herewith returned.\r\n\r\nAmong the facts presented I shall refer to but one or two touching the\r\nconduct of the claimant himself.\r\n\r\nUpon his examination, under oath, by a special examiner, he stated that\r\nhe was brought to Washington to further his claim by a man named Miller,\r\none of the rascally attorneys spoken of in the committee's report; that\r\nMiller was to pay his expenses while in Washington, and was to receive\r\none-third of the money paid upon the claim.\r\n\r\nThis is not the conduct of a man claiming in good faith a pension from\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nHe further stated under oath that his eyes became affected about January\r\n15, 1869, by reason of a sand storm; that the sand blew into them and\r\ncut them all to pieces; that he was thereafter hardly able to see or get\r\naround and wait on himself, and that Edward N. Baldwin took care of him\r\nin his tent.\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Baldwin was found by the special examiner and testified that he\r\nknew the claimant and served in same regiment and bunked with him; that\r\nhe never knew of the sand storm spoken of by Hester; that he never knew\r\nthat he had sore eyes in the service; that he (Baldwin) did not take\r\ncare of him when he was suffering with sore eyes, and that he never knew\r\nof Hester being sick but once, and that was when he had eaten too much.\r\nHe was shown an affidavit purporting to be made by him and declared the\r\nentire thing to be false and a forgery.\r\n\r\nI believe this claim for pension to be a fraud from beginning to end,\r\nand the effrontery with which it has been pushed shows the necessity of\r\na careful examination of these cases.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 6609, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Sarah E.

Pilcher.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the party\r\nnamed therein the sum of $905, being the amount of one bond of $100 and\r\n$805 in paper money of the Republic of Texas.\r\n\r\nIt is directed, however, that this money be paid out of the Texas\r\nindemnity fund.\r\n\r\nThis fund was created under a law passed on the 28th day of February,\r\n1855, appropriating the sum of $7,750,000 to pay certain claims against\r\nthe Republic of Texas. By the terms of said law a certain time was fixed\r\nwithin which such claims were to be presented to the Treasury\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nBetween the passage of said act and the year 1870 the sum of\r\n$7,648,786.73 was paid upon said claims, leaving of the money\r\nappropriated an unexpended balance of $101,213.27.\r\n\r\nThis balance was on the 30th day of June, 1877, carried to the surplus\r\nfund and covered into the Treasury, pursuant to section 5 of chapter 328\r\nof the laws of 1874.\r\n\r\nThus since that date it seems there has been no Texas indemnity fund,\r\nnor is there any such fund now from which the money mentioned in the\r\nbill herewith returned can be paid.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs the proposed law could not be executed and\r\nwould be of no possible use.\r\n\r\nIf the claims mentioned are such as should be paid by the United States,\r\nthere appears to be no difficulty in making an appropriation for their\r\npayment from the general funds of the Government.

The amount\r\nappropriated in the bill herewith returned is $75,000. There does not\r\nseem to be any governmental purpose to which such a building could be\r\nproperly devoted except the accommodation of the post-office.\r\n\r\nI have listened to an unusual amount of personal representation in favor\r\nof this bill from parties whose desires I should be glad to meet on this\r\nor any other question; but none of them have insisted that there is any\r\npresent governmental need of the proposed new building even for postal\r\npurposes. On the contrary, I am informed that the post-office is at\r\npresent well accommodated in quarters held under a lease which does not\r\nexpire, I believe, until 1892. A letter addressed to the postmaster at\r\nYoungstown containing certain questions bearing upon the necessity of a\r\nnew building failed to elicit a reply. This fact is very unusual and\r\nextraordinary, for the postmaster can almost always be relied upon to\r\nmake an exhibit of the great necessity of larger quarters when a new\r\npublic building is in prospect.\r\n\r\nThe fact was communicated to me early in the present session of the\r\nCongress that the aggregate sum of the appropriations contained in bills\r\nfor the erection and extension of public buildings which had up to that\r\ntime been referred to the House Committee on Public Buildings and\r\nGrounds was about $37,000,000.\r\n\r\nOf course this fact would have no particular relevancy if all the\r\nbuildings asked for were necessary for the transaction of public\r\nbusiness, as long as we have the money to pay for them; but inasmuch as\r\na large number of the buildings proposed are unnecessary and their\r\nerection would be wasteful and extravagant, besides furnishing\r\nprecedents for further and more extended reckless expenditures of a like\r\ncharacter, it seems to me that applications for new and expensive public\r\nbuildings should be carefully scrutinized.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the appropriation of $75,000 for a building at\r\nYoungstown is at present not justified.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1237, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Anna Mertz.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is the widow of Charles A. Mertz, who\r\nserved in the Army as captain from April, 1862, to June, 1863, when he\r\nresigned on account of impaired health. It is stated in the committee's\r\nreport that after his return from the Army he worked occasionally at his\r\ntrade, though subject to attacks of very severe diarrhea, accompanied\r\nwith acute catarrhal pains in the head and face, which he constantly\r\nattributed to his army service.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that he had several times taken morphine, under medical\r\nadvice, to allay pain caused by these attacks.\r\n\r\nHe did not apply for a pension.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of December, 1884, more than twenty-one years after\r\nhis discharge from the Army, he died from an overdose of morphine\r\nself-administered, for the purpose, it is claimed, of alleviating his\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nI do not think that in this case the death of the soldier was so related\r\nto his military service as to entitle his widow to a pension.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 820, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to David A. Servis.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted August 14, 1862, and was\r\ndischarged June 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that about the month of January, 1863, a comrade, by way\r\nof a joke, put powder into a pipe which the beneficiary was accustomed\r\nto smoke and covered it with tobacco, so that when he lighted it the\r\npowder exploded and injured his eyes. The report of the Senate committee\r\nstates that it does not appear that \"any notice was taken of this wanton\r\nact of his tent mate.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of any disability or injury in the record of the\r\nsoldier's service. He seems to have served nearly two years and a half\r\nafter the injury. He filed an application for a pension in May, 1885,\r\nmore than twenty-two years thereafter.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the extent of the injury sustained, in regard to which\r\nthe evidence is apparently quite meager, I can not see that it was such\r\na result of military service as to entitle the applicant to a pension.\r\n\r\nThe utmost liberality to those who were in our Army hardly justifies a\r\ncompensation by way of pension for injuries incurred in sport or pastime\r\nor as the result of a practical joke.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 835, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Elisha Griswold.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill, which awards him a pension, enlisted\r\nin January, 1864, and was discharged February 12, 1866.\r\n\r\nHis claim for pension, as developed in the report of the Senate\r\nCommittee on Pensions, is based upon the allegation that in January,\r\n1866, he fell from a swing which had been put up in the building\r\noccupied as a barrack and struck on his head and shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe committee report in favor of the bill upon the grounds that the\r\nsoldier was injured \"while engaged in recreation\" and that \"such\r\nrecreation is a necessary part of a soldier's life.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary filed an application in January, 1880, and in support of\r\nsuch application he filed on the 16th day of July, 1886, an affidavit in\r\nwhich he testifies that at the time of the injury he was in prison at\r\nSan Antonio, Tex., upon charges the character of which he could not\r\nascertain, and that the swing from which he fell was erected by himself\r\nand others for pastime and exercise.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the injury complained of is alleged to have been\r\nsustained less than a month before his discharge. There is, however, no\r\nrecord of any disability.\r\n\r\nHis claim based upon this injury was, in my opinion, properly rejected\r\nas having no connection with his military service, and I think the facts\r\nin his case as herein detailed do not justify the award of a pension to\r\nhim by special enactment.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of March, 1888, after the introduction of the bill\r\nherewith returned, the beneficiary, apparently having abandoned the\r\nclaim upon which the bill is predicated, filed another application for a\r\npension in the Pension Bureau, alleging that he contracted diarrhea and\r\nmalarial poisoning in the service. This application is still pending.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 29, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 1275, entitled \"An act for the\r\nerection of a public building at Columbus, Ga., and appropriating money\r\ntherefor.\"\r\n\r\nThe city of Columbus, Ga., is undoubtedly a thriving, growing city.\r\nThe only present necessity for a public building there is for the\r\naccommodation of its post-office. It is stated in the report of the\r\nHouse committee that the gross revenues of the office for the year\r\nending June 30, 1887, were $16,700. The postmaster, in a letter upon the\r\nsubject, makes the following statement:\r\n\r\n  I estimate the gross receipts at $17,500 for the fiscal year ending\r\n  March 31, which will be an increase of nearly 7 per cent over last\r\n  year's receipts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are nine persons employed in the post-office at present, including\r\nthe postmaster. The present quarters are leased by the Government at an\r\nannual rent of $900. The postmaster represents that his accommodations\r\nare not adequate or convenient, and that instead of a space of 1,900\r\nsquare feet, which he now has, he should be provided with 2,500 square\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe population of the city in 1880 was 10,123. It is claimed that it is\r\nnow about 20,000.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the facts presented do not exhibit the necessity of the\r\nexpenditure of $100,000 to afford the increased room for the post-office\r\nwhich may be desirable. I believe a private person would erect a\r\nbuilding abundantly sufficient for all our postal needs in that city for\r\nmany years to come for one-third of that sum.\r\n\r\nBusiness prudence and good judgment seem to dictate that the erection\r\nof the proposed building should be delayed until its necessity is more\r\nmanifest, and so that it can be better determined what expenditure for\r\nsuch a purpose will be justified by the continued growth of the city and\r\nthe needs of the Government.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 4467, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the erection of a public building at Bar Harbor, in Maine.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire town within which Bar Harbor is situated contained in 1880\r\n1,639 inhabitants, as appears by the census of that year.\r\n\r\nThere is no pretense that there is any need of a public building there\r\nexcept to accommodate the post-office.\r\n\r\nThis is a third-class office, and the Government does not pay the rent\r\nfor offices of that class. The gross receipts of the office for the year\r\nended June 30, 1887, are reported by the Postmaster-General at $5,337.\r\nThe postmaster reports that he employs five clerks in the summer and\r\nthree in the winter. The fact that Bar Harbor is a place of very\r\nextensive summer resort makes its population exceedingly variable, and\r\nduring a part of the year it is quite likely that the influx of pleasure\r\nseekers may make a more commodious post-office desirable, though there\r\ndoes not seem to be much complaint of present inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe postmaster pays a rent of $500 per annum for his present quarters.\r\n\r\nThe amount appropriated by the bill is quite moderate, being only\r\n$25,000, but the postmaster expresses the opinion that a proper site\r\nalone would cost from twenty to thirty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nI am decidedly of the opinion that if a public building is to be erected\r\nat this place, of which at present there appears to be no necessity, it\r\nshould be done under a system which will not give the post-office and\r\nthe postmaster there an advantage over others of their class.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 1394, entitled \"An act\r\nauthorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase additional ground\r\nfor the accommodation of Government offices in Council Bluffs, Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nA new public building at Council Bluffs will be completed in a short\r\ntime. The ground upon which it is located has a frontage of 192 feet\r\nand a depth of 106 feet and 10 inches. The proposition is to add 30\r\nfeet to its depth. The act under which this building has been thus far\r\nconstructed provides that the ground purchased therefor shall be of such\r\ndimensions as to leave the building unexposed to fire by an open space\r\nof at least 40 feet, including streets and alleys. The building is\r\nlocated on land now belonging to the Government sufficient in size to\r\ncomply with this provision, and in point of fact more than the open\r\nspace required is left on all sides of the same. There is no pretense\r\nthat any enlargement of the building is necessary or contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee to which this bill was referred in the House\r\nsimply states that \"the grounds on which said building is situated are\r\ninadequate for its proper accommodation and safety.\"\r\n\r\nIf this is so, I can see no reason why additional ground should not\r\nbe purchased for \"the proper accommodation and safety\" of a large\r\nproportion of the public buildings completed and in process of erection,\r\nsince the provision that there shall exist 40 feet of open space on\r\nall sides is, I think, contained in all the bills authorizing their\r\nconstruction. In this view the proposed legislation would establish a\r\nvery bad precedent.\r\n\r\nIt is provided in the bill that the additional 30 feet mentioned shall\r\nbe purchased for a sum not to exceed $10,000. The adjoining 106 feet and\r\n10 inches, located on the corner of two streets, were purchased in the\r\nyear 1882 by the Government for $15,000. The permission to purchase this\r\naddition at a price per foot greatly in excess of that already owned by\r\nthe Government seems so unnecessary, except to benefit the owner, that I\r\nam of the opinion it should not be granted.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 739, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Johanna Loewinger.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the beneficiary named in this bill enlisted June 28,\r\n1861, and was discharged May 8, 1862, upon a surgeon's certificate of\r\ndisability. He was pensioned for chronic diarrhea. He died July 17,\r\n1876. A coroner's inquest was held, who found by their verdict that the\r\ndeceased came to his death \"from suicide by cutting his throat with a\r\nrazor, caused by long-continued illness.\"\r\n\r\nThis inquest was held immediately after the soldier's death, and it\r\nappears that the case was fully investigated, with full opportunities to\r\ndiscover the truth. Upon the verdict found, in the absence of insanity\r\ncaused by any disability, it can hardly be claimed that his death was\r\ncaused by his military service. The attempts afterwards to impeach this\r\nverdict and introduce another cause of death do not seem to be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 12, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1772, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of John H. Marion.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to relieve the party named therein from an\r\nindebtedness to the Government amounting to $1,042.45, arising from the\r\nnonfulfillment of a contract made by him in 1884 with the Government, by\r\nwhich he agreed to furnish for the use of the Quartermaster's Department\r\na quantity of grama hay.\r\n\r\nThe contractor wholly failed to furnish the hay as agreed, and thereupon\r\nthe Government, pursuant to the terms of the contract, obtained the hay\r\nin other quarters, paying therefor a larger sum by $1,042.45 than it\r\nwould have been obliged to pay the contractor if he had fulfilled his\r\nagreement. This amount was charged against the contractor.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that the crop of the particular kind of hay which was to\r\nbe furnished under the contract failed the season in which it was to be\r\nsupplied on account of drought, and that thus performance became\r\nimpossible on the part of the contractor.\r\n\r\nBetween individuals no injustice could be claimed if the contractor in\r\nsuch circumstances should be held to have taken the chances of the crop;\r\nand if an equitable adjustment should be suggested in such a case as is\r\nhere presented it would hardly be asked that the party suffering from\r\nthe default or failure of the other should sustain all the loss.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the contractor was the proprietor of a newspaper in\r\nArizona, and that he did some printing for the Government besides\r\nagreeing to furnish hay to the Quartermaster's Department. After the\r\nascertainment of the loss to the Government arising out of the hay\r\ntransactions, certain accounts for printing presented by the contractor\r\nwere credited against the amount of such loss charged against him. In\r\nthis way his debt to the Government has been reduced more than $700. The\r\nproposed legislation would cause to be paid to the contractor the sums\r\nso retained for printing and to relieve him from the remainder of the\r\nGovernment's claims.\r\n\r\nInquiry at the Quartermaster-General's Office fails to substantiate the\r\nallegation that there is any understanding when such contracts are made\r\nthat their performance is to be at all relaxed by the failure of the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThere really seems to be no good reason why the contractor should not\r\nmake good the entire loss consequent upon his default. If, however,\r\nstrict rights are to be relinquished and the liberality of the\r\nGovernment invoked, it should not be taxed beyond the limit of sharing\r\nthe loss with the delinquent. This result would be accomplished by\r\ndischarging the remainder of the contractor's debt after crediting the\r\nbills for printing above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe Government is obliged in the transaction of its business to make\r\nnumerous contracts with private parties, and if these contracts are to\r\nbe of any use or protection they should not be lightly set aside on\r\nbehalf of citizens who are disappointed as to their profitable nature or\r\ntheir ability to perform them.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 12, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1017, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Stephen Schiedel.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill served in the First Regiment Missouri\r\nLight Artillery from October 24, 1861, to October, 1864. There is no\r\nrecord of any injury or disability while in the service.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1880, sixteen years after his discharge, he filed an\r\napplication for a pension, alleging that about June, 1862, while\r\ncarrying logs to aid in building quarters, a log slipped and fell upon a\r\nlever, which flew up and struck him, injuring his back and shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe furnished the testimony of two witnesses tending to support his\r\nstatement of the manner in which he was injured, but upon investigation\r\nthis evidence was found to be unreliable.\r\n\r\nMedical examinations failed to disclose any disability from the cause\r\nalleged, but do tend to show that he was disabled since his discharge by\r\nan injury to his right hand and arm and some rheumatic trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that he incurred any disability from rheumatism while\r\nin the Army. It appears distinctly that he was wounded in the right\r\nwrist and arm while firing a cannon at the village of Hamburg, Erie\r\nCounty, N.Y., on the 4th day of July, 1866. The doctor who testifies to\r\nthis injury and who dressed the wound negatives any other illness before\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\nEven if he has, since his discharge, suffered from rheumatism, he does\r\nnot claim that this was incurred in the Army. He bases his right to a\r\npension entirely upon an injury which he particularly describes, and\r\nwhich the medical examination does not sustain. It will be observed,\r\ntoo, that he continued his military service for two years and four\r\nmonths after the date of his alleged injury.

Hardy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to award a pension to the beneficiary above\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1864, he was on recruiting service in the State\r\nof Indiana. On the 15th day of that month he was traveling between\r\nIndianapolis and Lafayette in a railroad car, and he alleges that he\r\nraised a window of the car to obtain air, and placed his arm on the\r\nwindow sill, when it was struck by something from the outside and one of\r\nthe bones of his arm broken.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1865, he resigned on account of disability caused by the\r\naccident above mentioned, the medical certificate then stating that he\r\nhad a fracture of the right humerus of ten months' standing which had\r\nnot been properly adjusted.\r\n\r\nHe made an application for a pension to the Pension Bureau, which was\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is stated in a general way that he was traveling on business\r\nconnected with his recruiting service at the time of his injury, he has\r\ngiven no information as to the precise purpose of his journey; and it is\r\nconceded that he was guilty of such negligence that he had no right of\r\naction against the railroad company.\r\n\r\nIt also appears by the medical certificate upon which his resignation\r\nwas permitted that the fracture, not necessarily serious, was never\r\nproperly treated. It seems, too, that he remained in the service ten\r\nmonths after the injury.\r\n\r\nI am unable to discover why a pension should be granted in this case,\r\nunless the Government is to be held as an insurer of the safety of every\r\nperson in the military service in all circumstances and at all times and\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 8174, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Ellen Sexton.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the beneficiary served in the Union Volunteer Army from\r\nOctober, 1862, to June, 1864, having been during the last seven months\r\nof his service in the Veteran Reserve Corps.

He also alleges that he\r\nread an account of the massacre in a newspaper, the name of which he has\r\nforgotten, and that his son was there mentioned as among the slain.\r\n\r\nThe report of the House committee states that the only evidence of the\r\ndeath of this soldier is found in a letter of Anderson G.

She further says that her husband left\r\nhis home in 1865 and has not been heard of since, and that she believes\r\nhe deserted her on account of her infirmities.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged in the report that she received a pension as the widow of\r\nDaniel Dougherty until it was discovered that he was alive, when her\r\nname was dropped from the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe petition of this woman is indorsed by the Admiral and several other\r\nofficers of the Navy and a distinguished clergyman of Washington,\r\ncertifying that they know Mrs. Dougherty and believe the facts stated to\r\nbe true.\r\n\r\nThere is no pretense made now that this beneficiary is a widow, though\r\nshe at one time claimed to be, and was allowed a pension on that\r\nallegation. Her present claim rests entirely upon injuries received by\r\nher when she was concededly not employed in the military service. If the\r\npension now proposed is allowed her, it will be a mere act of charity.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Daniel Dougherty, is now living in Philadelphia, and is a\r\npensioner in his own right for disability alleged to have been incurred\r\nwhile serving in the Thirty-fourth New Jersey Volunteers. Of this fact\r\nthis beneficiary has been repeatedly informed; and yet she states in her\r\npetition that her husband deserted her in 1865 and has not been heard of\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged in the Pension Bureau that in 1878 she succeeded in\r\nsecuring a pension as the widow of Daniel Dougherty through fraudulent\r\ntestimony and much false swearing on her part.\r\n\r\nThe police records of the precinct in which she has lived for years show\r\nthat she is a woman of very bad character, and that she has been under\r\narrest nine times for drunkenness, larceny, creating disturbance, and\r\nmisdemeanors of that sort.\r\n\r\nIt happens that this claimant, by reason of her residence here, has been\r\neasily traced and her character and untruthfulness discovered. But there\r\nis much reason to fear that this case will find its parallel, in many\r\nthat have reached a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nI can not spell out any principle upon which the bounty of the\r\nGovernment is bestowed through the instrumentality of the flood of\r\nprivate pension bills that reach me. The theory seems to have been\r\nadopted that no man who served in the Army can be the subject of death\r\nor impaired health except they are chargeable to his service. Medical\r\ntheories are set at naught and the most startling relation is claimed\r\nbetween alleged incidents of military service and disability or death.\r\nFatal apoplexy is admitted as the result of quite insignificant wounds,\r\nheart disease is attributed to chronic diarrhea, consumption to hernia,\r\nand suicide is traced to army service in a wonderfully devious and\r\ncurious way.\r\n\r\nAdjudications of the Pension Bureau are overruled in the most peremptory\r\nfashion by these special acts of Congress, since nearly all the\r\nbeneficiaries named in these bills have unsuccessfully applied to that\r\nBureau for relief.\r\n\r\nThis course of special legislation operates very unfairly.\r\n\r\nThose with certain influence or friends to push their claims procure\r\npensions, and those who have neither friends nor influence must be\r\ncontent with their fate under general laws. It operates unfairly by\r\nincreasing in numerous instances the pensions of those already on the\r\nrolls, while many other more deserving cases, from the lack of fortunate\r\nadvocacy, are obliged to be content with the sum provided by general\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension may well be entertained that the freedom with which\r\nthese private pension bills are passed furnishes an inducement to fraud\r\nand imposition, while it certainly teaches the vicious lesson to our\r\npeople that the Treasury of the National Government invites the approach\r\nof private need.\r\n\r\nNone of us should be in the least wanting in regard for the veteran\r\nsoldier, and I will yield to no man in a desire to see those who\r\ndefended the Government when it needed defenders liberally treated.\r\nUnfriendliness to our veterans is a charge easily and sometimes\r\ndishonestly made.\r\n\r\nI insist that the true soldier is a good citizen, and that he will be\r\nsatisfied with generous, fair, and equal consideration for those who are\r\nworthily entitled to help.\r\n\r\nI have considered the pension list of the Republic a roll of honor,\r\nbearing names inscribed by national gratitude, and not by improvident\r\nand indiscriminate almsgiving.\r\n\r\nI have conceived the prevention of the complete discredit which must\r\nensue from the unreasonable, unfair, and reckless granting of pensions\r\nby special acts to be the best service I can render our veterans.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of what has seemed to me my duty as related to\r\nlegislation, and in the interest of all the veterans of the Union Army,\r\nI have attempted to stem the tide of improvident pension enactments,\r\nthough I confess to a full share of responsibility for some of these\r\nlaws that should not have been passed.\r\n\r\nI am far from denying that there are cases of merit which can not be\r\nreached except by special enactment, but I do not believe there is a\r\nmember of either House of Congress who will not admit that this kind of\r\nlegislation has been carried too far.\r\n\r\nI have now before me more than 100 special pension bills, which can\r\nhardly be examined within the time allowed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nMy aim has been at all times, in dealing with bills of this character,\r\nto give the applicant for a pension the benefit of any doubt that might\r\narise, and which balanced the propriety of granting a pension if there\r\nseemed any just foundation for the application; but when it seemed\r\nentirely outside of every rule in its nature or the proof supporting it,\r\nI have supposed I only did my duty in interposing an objection.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it would be well if our general pension laws should\r\nbe revised with a view of meeting every meritorious case that can arise.\r\nOur experience and knowledge of any existing deficiencies ought to make\r\nthe enactment of a complete pension code possible.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of such a revision, and if pensions are to be granted\r\nupon equitable grounds and without regard to general laws, the present\r\nmethods would be greatly improved by the establishment of some tribunal\r\nto examine the facts in every case and determine upon the merits of the\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 8291, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Julia Welch.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of the beneficiary named in this bill served in the Army\r\nfrom December, 1863, to May, 1866.\r\n\r\nHe never filed an application for pension, and died February 24, 1880,\r\nof inflammation of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe claim filed by his widow for pension alleged that her husband\r\nsuffered from chronic diarrhea and disease of the heart and lungs as\r\nresults of his army service.\r\n\r\nThe claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that they\r\nsoldier died from an acute disease which bore no relation to any\r\ncomplaint contracted in the Army.\r\n\r\nI think the action of the Bureau was correct.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 5, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 7907, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mary Ann Lang.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this beneficiary was wounded in the nose on the 1st day\r\nof June, 1864, and was mustered out of the service July 8, 1865.

He adds that the soldier was a man\r\nwho drank beer, and at times to excess, and that he drank harder toward\r\nthe last of his life. He further states that he is unable to connect the\r\nliver trouble with his rheumatism, and could not give any other reason\r\nfor it except his long use of beer and liquor, and if that was not the\r\ncause it greatly aggravated it; that he had cautioned him about\r\ndrinking, and at times he heeded the advice.\r\n\r\nAn appeal was taken from the action rejecting the claim and the case was\r\nsubmitted to the medical referee of the Pension Bureau, who decided upon\r\nall the testimony that the soldier's fatal disease (dropsy) was due to\r\ndisease of the liver, which was not a sequence of rheumatism and was the\r\nresult of excessive use of alcoholic stimulants.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that no claim is made that death in any way resulted\r\nfrom the wound for which a pension had been allowed, and that even if\r\nrheumatism was connected with the death its incurrence in the Army had\r\nnever been established.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that this case was properly disposed of by the Pension\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9184, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to William M.

This should be the most reliable of\r\nall the medical testimony, and taken in connection with the conceded\r\nintemperate habits of the deceased and the fact, that the brain was\r\ninvolved, it satisfies me that the rejection of the widow's claim by\r\nthe Pension Bureau on the ground that the cause of death was mainly\r\nintemperance was correct.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 6, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_;\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 6431, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Van Buren Brown.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was discharged from the Army\r\nSeptember 11, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe filed an application for pension in the Pension Bureau May 19, 1883,\r\nalleging chronic diarrhea, rheumatism, spinal disease the result of an\r\ninjury, and deafness.\r\n\r\nHis claim was very thoroughly examined and reopened and examined again\r\nafter rejection, and rejected a second time.\r\n\r\nThe case is full of uncertainty and contradiction.

Chase.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary enlisted September 3, 1863. The records show that\r\nhe was admitted to a hospital March 3, 1864, with a disease of a\r\ndiscreditable nature and by no means connected with the military\r\nservice, and that he was discharged from the Army May 20, 1864, upon a\r\ncertificate of paralysis of left arm, which came on suddenly February\r\n20, 1864, and that the cause was unknown, but believed not to be\r\nincident to the service.\r\n\r\nHe filed an application for a pension in June, 1864, alleging paralysis\r\nof the left arm from causes unknown to him.\r\n\r\nThis claim was not prosecuted at that time, and the claimant reenlisted\r\nin January, 1865, and served until September 5, 1865, without any\r\nevidence of disability appearing upon the records.\r\n\r\nHe renewed his claim in 1870, stating that he was first taken with a\r\npain in his left arm about March 1, 1864, and that it became partially\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that thus far in his application he gives no\r\nexplanation of the incurrence of his disability which leads to the\r\nbelief that it was related to his service.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated May 31, 1864, his captain states that he can but think\r\nthat the disability of the claimant was the result of his folly and\r\nindiscretion, and that he feels it his duty to decline giving him a\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the claimant stated the cause of his disability was an injury to\r\nhis arm while expelling a soldier from a railroad train at Augusta, Me.,\r\nhe acting as provost guard at the time. Upon this allegation the case\r\nwas reopened at the Pension Bureau.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a letter from the Bureau the captain of claimant's company\r\nstated that he had no knowledge of such an injury. The same officer,\r\nin a letter dated February 25, 1887, expresses the belief that the\r\ndisability of the applicant, if any existed, was caused by the\r\ninjudicious use of mercurial medicine self-administered for venereal\r\ndisease contracted at Augusta, Me., in January, 1864, and that such was\r\nthe rumor among his comrades when he was sent to the hospital.\r\n\r\nI can not believe that an injury was sustained such as was specified\r\nby the applicant in 1880 and that nothing was said of it either in the\r\nclaim made in 1864 or in 1870. In the absence of this or some other\r\ndefinite cause consistent with an honest claim we are left in the face\r\nof some contrary evidence to guess that his arm was injured in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe application of this beneficiary is still pending in the Pension\r\nBureau awaiting further information.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9520, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Mary Fitzmorris.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to pension the beneficiary named therein, as\r\nthe widow of Edmund Fitzmorris, under the provisions and limitations of\r\nthe general pension laws.

Many other witnesses, with good\r\nopportunities of knowledge on the subject, testified to the same effect.\r\n\r\nWhile testimony of a different character was also given, tending to\r\nestablish the theory that the disabilities alleged were at least to some\r\nextent attributable to military service, the overwhelming weight of\r\nproof seems to establish that whatever disabilities exist are the result\r\nof disease contracted by vicious habits, and that such disabilities had\r\ntheir origin prior to enlistment.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 17, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 8078, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Theresa Herbst, widow of John Herbst, late private Company\r\nG, One hundred and fortieth Regiment of New York Volunteers.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Herbst, the husband of the beneficiary named in this bill, enlisted\r\nAugust 26, 1862.

He was imprisoned and voluntarily made known the fact that\r\nhe formerly belonged to the Union Army. Upon taking the oath of\r\nallegiance and explaining that he deserted to the enemy to escape the\r\nhardship and starvation of prison life, he was released and mustered out\r\nof the service on the 11th day of October, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe was regularly borne on the Confederate muster rolls for probably nine\r\nor ten months.

If such disabilities were\r\nincurred in military service, they were quite likely the result of\r\nexposure in the Confederate army; but it is not improbable that this\r\nsoldier never asked a pension because he considered that the generosity\r\nof his Government had been sufficiently taxed when the full forfeit of\r\nhis desertion was not exacted.\r\n\r\nThe greatest possible sympathy and consideration are due to those who\r\nbravely fought, and being captured as bravely languished in rebel\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nBut I will take no part in putting a name upon our pension roll which\r\nrepresents a Union soldier found fighting against the cause he swore he\r\nwould uphold, nor should it be for a moment admitted that such desertion\r\nand treachery are excused when it avoids the rigors of honorable capture\r\nand confinement.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a sad condition of affairs if every captured Union\r\nsoldier had deemed himself justified in fighting against his Government\r\nrather than to undergo the privations of capture.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 26, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1447, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Bridget Foley.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph F.

The soldier never applied for a pension.\r\n\r\nIt is strenuously disputed that he had this complaint before enlistment.\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that he died of consumption, and I\r\ncan find no proof that this disease was contracted in the service or had\r\nany relation thereto.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 26, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2644, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting the right of way to the Fort Smith, Paris and Dardanelle\r\nRailway Company to construct and operate a railroad, telegraph, and\r\ntelephone line from Fort Smith, Ark., through the Indian Territory, to\r\nor near Baxter Springs, in the State of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill grants a right of way 100 feet in width, with the use of\r\nadjoining lands for stations and other purposes, through the eastern\r\npart of that portion of the Indian Territory occupied by the Cherokee\r\nIndians under a treaty with the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the treaty concluded between the Government and the\r\nCherokee Nation in 1866 these Indians expressly granted a right of way\r\nthrough their lands \"to any company or corporation which shall be duly\r\nauthorized by Congress to construct a railroad from any point north to\r\nany point south, and from any point east to any point west of, and which\r\nmay pass through, the Cherokee Nation.\"\r\n\r\nThere are excellent reasons why this clause in the treaty should be\r\nconstrued as limiting the railroads which should run through these\r\nlands, at least without further permission of the Indians, to only one\r\nfrom north to south and one other from east to west.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the Congress has either not so interpreted\r\nthis provision of the treaty or has determined that it should be\r\ndisregarded, for there have been six or seven railroads constructed or\r\nauthorized through these lands by the permission of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt has become very much the custom to grant these rights of way through\r\nIndian lands and reservations merely for the asking. They have been\r\nduplicated to such an extent that rival roads are found struggling for\r\nthe advantage of a prior Congressional grant or for the possession of a\r\ncontested route through these reservations.\r\n\r\nI believe these indiscriminate grants to railroads permitting them to\r\ncross the lands occupied by the Indians, if not in absolute violation of\r\ntheir treaty rights, are dangerous to the success of our Indian\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining their tribal condition they should not be easily\r\nsubjected to the disturbance and the irritation of such encroachments.\r\nWhen they have advanced sufficiently for the allotment of their lands in\r\nseveralty, they should be permitted, as a general rule, to enjoy and\r\ncultivate all the land set apart to them, and not discouraged by the\r\nforced surrender of a part of it for railroad purposes. In the solution\r\nof the problem of their civilization by allotments of land they need the\r\nland itself, and not compensation for its appropriation by others. They\r\ncan not be expected to understand this process in any other way than an\r\nindication that their tenure is uncertain and the assurance that they\r\nshall hold their allotted land for cultivation a delusion.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary in the treatment of this subject to insist that in\r\nno case should a railroad be permitted to cross Indian reservations.\r\nThere may be valid public reasons why in some cases this should be\r\nallowed. Important lines of through travel should not be always\r\nobstructed or defeated by a refusal of such permission. But I think\r\nthere should be shown in every case a justification in the public\r\ninterest or in furtherance of general growth and progress, or at least\r\nin a plain local necessity or convenience, before such grants are made.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me also that the consent of the Indians for the passage of\r\nrailroads through their land should, as a general rule, be required;\r\nthat the means of determining the compensation to be made for land taken\r\nshould be just and definite and easy of application; that the route of\r\nthe proposed road should be as particularly described as is possible;\r\nthat a reasonable time should be fixed for the construction of the road,\r\nand in default of such construction that the grant should be declared\r\nnull and void without legislation or judicial action, and that in all\r\ncases the rights and interests of the Indians should be carefully\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe bill under consideration grants to the railroad company therein\r\nnamed the right to construct its road over substantially the same route\r\ndescribed in a law already passed permitting the Kansas City, Fort Scott\r\nand Gulf Railway Company to build its road through this reservation. No\r\nnecessity or good reason is apparent why these two roads should be built\r\nupon the same line.\r\n\r\nThe bill makes no provision for gaining the consent of the Indians\r\noccupying these lands. The Cherokee Nation of Indians have their local\r\nlaws and legislation, and are quite competent to pass upon this\r\nquestion. They have heretofore shown their interest in such subjects, I\r\nam informed, by protesting against some of the grants which have been\r\nmade for the construction of railroads through their lands.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides for the taking of lands held by individual occupants\r\nand the manner of fixing the compensation therefor; but it is declared\r\nthat when any portion of the land taken by the company shall cease to be\r\nused for the purposes for which it is taken the same shall revert to the\r\nnation or tribe from which the same shall have been taken. There is no\r\nprovision that in any case land taken from individual occupants shall\r\nrevert to them.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth section of the bill it is provided that the railroad\r\ncompany shall pay to the Secretary of the Interior, for the benefit of\r\nthe particular nation or tribe through whose lands its line may be\r\nlocated, in addition to other compensation, the sum of $50.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, intended to declare that this sum should be paid\r\nfor every mile of road built through Indian lands, but it is not so\r\nexpressed. I am by no means certain that the context will aid this\r\nomission, which is quite palpable, when that part of the bill is\r\ncompared with others of the same character. In any event, this is a\r\nprovision which should be free from all doubt.\r\n\r\nThere is no time limited in the bill within which the proposed road\r\nthrough the reservation shall be completed, and consequently no\r\nforfeiture fixed for noncompletion. The nearest approach to it is found\r\nin a clause providing that the company shall build at least 50 miles of\r\nits road in the Indian Territory within three years from the passage of\r\nthe act, or the rights granted shall be forfeited as to that portion\r\nnot built. The length of the proposed route through the Cherokee lands\r\nappears to be considerably over 100 miles, and it is plain that there is\r\nno sufficient guaranty in the bill that the entire road will be built\r\nwithin any particular time. There is no forfeiture and no limitation for\r\nthe completion of the road if 50 miles is built within three years, and\r\nthere may be some doubt how far the forfeiture would extend in case of\r\na failure to finish the 50 miles within the time specified.\r\n\r\nI believe these grants to railroads should be sparingly made; that\r\nwhen made they should present better reasons for their necessity and\r\nusefulness than are apparent in this case, and that they should be\r\nguarded and limited by provisions which are not found in the bill\r\nherewith returned.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 3, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 3008, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of P.A. Leatherbury.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the\r\nperson above named the sum of $601.27, being the amount paid by him to\r\nLucy Roberts on two pension checks which were afterwards recalled and\r\ncanceled.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the House to whom this bill was referred report that--\r\n\r\n  The Department discovered, after the issuing of the checks, that the\r\n  claim for pension was fraudulent, but not until after the purchase,\r\n  in the ordinary course of business, by Mr. Leatherbury paying $601.27\r\n  therefor and giving his due bill for the balance, which balance he\r\n  refused to pay after ascertaining that the check was repudiated by\r\n  the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Roberts, a colored woman, filed a claim for pension in 1868,\r\nalleging that she was the widow of Nelson Roberts, who died in the\r\nmilitary service in 1865.\r\n\r\nHer claim was allowed in 1876, and two checks, numbered 6863 and 6864,\r\naggregating $1,301.27, were issued on account of said pension. Before\r\npayment of the checks information was received which caused an\r\ninvestigation by the Pension Bureau as to the honesty of the claim\r\nfor pension. This investigation established its utterly fraudulent\r\ncharacter, and thereupon the checks were canceled and the woman's name\r\nwas dropped from the pension rolls.\r\n\r\nCertain important facts are reported to me from the Pension Bureau as\r\nhaving been developed upon the investigation.\r\n\r\nIt appears that one Thomas had undertaken to act for the claimant in\r\nprocuring her pension under an agreement that he should have $300 if\r\nsuccessful. Mr. Leatherbury was a notary, postmaster, and claim agent,\r\nand acted as notary and general assistant to Thomas and the claimant,\r\nwho was employed at Leatherbury's house. In the month of July, 1876, the\r\nsame month the claim for pension was allowed, the woman Roberts was\r\nindicted for larceny, the complaining witness being Mr. Leatherbury.\r\nShortly after the issue of the checks the woman disappeared, and it is\r\nreported that certain indications suggested that both Leatherbury and\r\nThomas were not entirely ignorant of her whereabouts nor completely\r\ndisconnected with her disappearance. The checks were obtained from\r\nThomas by Leatherbury, he paying, as he alleges, to Thomas the fee of\r\n$300 which had been agreed upon. The checks remained in Leatherbury's\r\npossession until they were delivered by him to the special agent of the\r\nPension Bureau upon the investigation. He claimed in his deposition that\r\nhe considered that what money he had let the woman have and the goods\r\nshe had obtained at his store while she worked for him, and the $300\r\nwhich he had advanced to Thomas, her agent, justified him in holding her\r\nindebted to him in the sum of $600, and that he held the checks as\r\nsecurity for the same, admitting that there was still $700 in her favor,\r\nwritten acknowledgment of which he had placed in the hands of his wife.\r\nHe further stated that rather than gain notoriety in the matter he would\r\nreturn the checks to the special agent, but he trusted that the\r\nGovernment would pay him the $600 which he had sunk in the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe woman testified that she did take some goods from Leatherbury at his\r\nstore at his suggestion, after the arrival of the checks and before she\r\nleft, about August 16, 1876, which purchases amounted to no more than\r\n$100, and that he also advanced her $100; that he made no further\r\npayment and wrote to her that he had to give up the checks, and that she\r\nnever indorsed the checks nor authorized anyone to do so.\r\n\r\nBoth Leatherbury and Thomas disclaimed any knowledge of the fraudulent\r\ncharacter of the claim; but the fraudulent claimant lived in the house\r\nof one of them and he was assisting in procuring her claim to be\r\nallowed, while the other made an unlawful agreement for a liberal\r\ncompensation for his services if the claim succeeded. The woman was\r\nindicted at the instance of Leatherbury at about the time of the\r\nissuance of the checks and fled, but if she is to be believed\r\nLeatherbury wrote to her during her absence. After her disappearance\r\nhe ventures to pay to Thomas his illegal fee and takes possession of\r\nthe checks. He considers that she owes him $600, and the bill under\r\nconsideration gives him $601.27, the exact amount of the checks less\r\n$700.\r\n\r\nSomeone with more intelligence than this ignorant colored woman\r\nconcocted the scheme to gain this fraudulent pension; and the\r\ncircumstances point so suspiciously toward Thomas and Leatherbury, the\r\nclaim of the latter upon the Government is infected with so much\r\nillegality, and the amount of his advances is arrived at so loosely that\r\nin my opinion he should not at this late day be relieved.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1870, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting the use of certain lands in Pierce County, Washington\r\nTerritory, to the city of Tacoma, for the purpose of a public park.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to permit the appropriation for a public\r\npark of a certain military reservation containing 635 acres, which was\r\nset apart for military and defensive purposes the 22d day of September,\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of this reservation was strongly recommended by high\r\nmilitary authority, and its preservation and maintenance have since that\r\ntime been also urged by the same authority.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when the subject of national defense is much discussed, I\r\ncan not account for the apparent willingness to grant, or permit to be\r\nused for other purposes, Government lands reserved for military uses.\r\n\r\nI judge from an expression in the letter of the Chief of Engineers, made\r\na part of the report of the committee of the House to which this bill\r\nwas referred, that its original purpose was to absolutely transfer this\r\nreservation to the city of Tacoma. The Chief of Engineers suggested an\r\namendment to the bill providing that the mere permission to use this\r\nland for a park should be granted, \"and that this permission be given\r\nwith the full understanding that the United States intends to occupy the\r\nlands or any part of them for military or other purposes whenever its\r\nproper officials see fit to order the same, and without any claim for\r\ncompensation or damage on the part of said city of Tacoma.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of adopting the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers the\r\nprovision of the bill limiting the extent of the use of this land\r\ndeclares--\r\n\r\n  That the United States reserves to itself the fee and the right forever\r\n  to resume possession and occupy any portion of said lands for naval or\r\n  military purposes whenever in the judgment of the President the exigency\r\n  arises that should require the use and appropriation of the same for the\r\n  public defense or for such other disposition as Congress may determine,\r\n  without any claim for compensation to said city for improvements thereon\r\n  or damages on account thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expediency of granting any right to the occupancy of this land is,\r\nin my opinion, very doubtful. If it is done, it should be in the form of\r\na mere license, revocable at any time, for the purposes used by the\r\nofficers to which its use and disposition are now subject.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if any use of this land is given to the city\r\nof Tacoma it should be with the proviso suggested by the Chief of\r\nEngineers, instead of the indefinite and restricted one incorporated\r\nin the bill.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 9, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 8761, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mrs. Anna Butterfield.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to pension the beneficiary therein named as\r\nthe \"dependent mother of James A.B.

Though the mother\r\nseems to have saved something, from which she draws a small income,\r\nher advanced age and the honorable service of her son would make the\r\nallowance of a pension in her case, upon any fair and plausible\r\njustification, very gratifying.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 9, 1888_.:\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 2140, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Eliza Smith.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this beneficiary was a second lieutenant in an Indiana\r\nregiment, and was discharged from the service in April, 1864. It is\r\nproposed in the bill herewith returned to pension the beneficiary as the\r\nwidow of a first lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe deceased was pensioned for a gunshot wound in his left arm under the\r\ngeneral law, and his pension was increased by a special act in 1883.\r\n\r\nHe died away from home at a hotel in Union City, Ind., on the 18th day\r\nof December, 1884, and it was determined at the time, and is still\r\nclaimed, that his death was the result of an overdose of morphine\r\nself-administered.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that at times the wound of the deceased soldier was\r\nvery painful and that he was in the habit of taking large doses of\r\nmorphine to alleviate his suffering.\r\n\r\nTwo days before his death he was at the house of one Moore, in Union\r\nCity; he complained of pain, and asked for a dose of morphine, but it\r\ndoes not appear that he obtained it.\r\n\r\nOn the same day he went to a hotel in the same town and remained there\r\nuntil his death. On the second evening after his arrival there he\r\ncomplained of asthma and pain in his arm, and retired about 9 o'clock\r\np.m. In the afternoon of the next day the door of his room was forced\r\nopen, and he was found prostrate and helpless, though able to talk.\r\nMedicine was administered, but he soon died.\r\n\r\nHis family physician testified that the deceased did not suffer from\r\nasthma; that when his wound was suppurating he had difficulty in\r\nbreathing, and that at such times he was in the habit of taking morphine\r\nin large doses, and that at times he was intemperate, especially when\r\nsuffering from his wound.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me it would establish a very bad precedent to allow a\r\npension upon the facts developed in this case.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 9, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 7510, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Stephen A.

His widow filed a claim\r\nfor pension, alleging that he died of insanity, the result of disease\r\nof the head and eyes. Her claim was rejected on the ground that his\r\ninsanity, forty-one years after discharge from the service, had no\r\nconnection with his military service.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1886, a special act was passed granting a pension to the widow,\r\nwhich met with Executive disapproval.\r\n\r\nAt the time the soldier committed suicide he was 68 years old. Upon the\r\nfacts I hardly think insanity is claimed. At least there does not appear\r\nto be the least evidence of it, unless it be the suicide itself. It is\r\nclaimed, however, and with good reason, that he had become despondent on\r\naccount of the delay in determining his application for a pension and\r\nbecause he supposed that important evidence to establish his claim which\r\nhe expected would not be forthcoming. It is very likely that this\r\ndespondency existed and that it so affected the mind of this old soldier\r\nthat it led to his suicide. But the fact remains that he took his own\r\nlife in a deliberate manner, and that the affection of his eyes, which\r\nwas the disability claimed, was not in a proper sense even the remote\r\ncause of his death.\r\n\r\nI confess that I have endeavored to relieve myself from again\r\ninterposing objections to the granting of a pension to this poor and\r\naged widow. But I can not forget that age and poverty do not themselves\r\njustify gifts of public money, and it seems to me that the according of\r\npensions is a serious business which ought to be regulated by principle\r\nand reason, though these may well be tempered with much liberality.\r\n\r\nI can find no principle or plausible pretext in this case which would\r\nnot lead to granting a pension in any case of alleged disability arising\r\nfrom military service followed by suicide.

He entered the service as a brigadier-general in 1861, and served\r\nthrough the War of the Rebellion with credit, and was wounded in the\r\nleft arm on the 15th day of May, 1864.\r\n\r\nFor this wound he was pensioned according to his rank, and received such\r\npension until his death, at the age of 70 years, which occurred October\r\n12, 1878.\r\n\r\nThe cause of his death was brain disease, and it seems not to be\r\nseriously claimed that it had any relation to his wound.\r\n\r\nHis widow is now in receipt of the pension provided for those of her\r\nclass by the Mexican pension law.\r\n\r\nIf this bill becomes a law, I am unable to see why, in fairness and\r\njustice, the widow of any officer of the grade of General Ward should\r\nnot be allowed $50 a month, the amount proposed by this bill to be paid\r\nhis widow, regardless of any other consideration except widowhood and\r\nthe rank of the deceased husband.\r\n\r\nThe bill herewith returned, while fixing the monthly amount to be\r\nabsolutely paid to the beneficiary, does not make the granting of the\r\npension nor payment of the money subject to any of the provisions of the\r\npension laws nor make any reference to the Mexican service pension she\r\nis now receiving. While it is the rule under general laws that two\r\npensions shall not be paid to the same person, inasmuch as the widow\r\nis entitled to the pension she is now receiving upon grounds different\r\nfrom those upon which the special bill was passed, and no intention\r\nis apparent in the special bill that the other pension should be\r\nsuperseded, it may result that under the peculiar wording of this bill\r\nshe would be entitled to both pensions.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary filed a claim for pension in the Pension Bureau in 1884,\r\nwhich is still pending, awaiting evidence connecting the death of the\r\nsoldier with his wound.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 10, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 490, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to George W.

His widow filed an application for pension in\r\n1882, alleging that her husband's death was caused by blood poisoning\r\ncontracted while dressing the wound of a patient in January, 1863. There\r\nis proof that he suffered from blood poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe record of death states its cause as congestion of the liver, but the\r\ncertificate was not signed. A young doctor named Adams, a friend and\r\npupil of the deceased, seems to have been more than any other the\r\nattendant physician, but he appeared to think that one of three other\r\ndoctors had actual charge of the case. These physicians, named,\r\nrespectively, Sullivan, Dana, and Sargent, agreed that Adams had charge\r\nof the case and that they were consulting surgeons in the last illness.\r\n\r\nDr. Adams testified before a special examiner that from intimate\r\nassociation he knew that the deceased was subject to kidney disease and\r\nother symptoms of bad health from discharge to his death; that as he had\r\nlost a part of one hand from blood poisoning in the Army, he always\r\nsupposed his subsequent troubles were referable to that cause; that he\r\nbelieved the cause of death was albuminuria, and that his liver was also\r\naffected. He further expresses the opinion that the death was the\r\nculmination of the disorders which affected him from the time of his\r\ndischarge from the service.\r\n\r\nDr. Sullivan deposed that he knew the deceased well from about 1869, and\r\nnever had any reason to think him the subject of blood poisoning or its\r\nresults. He further says that he was called in consultation at the last\r\nillness of the deceased and diagnosed his trouble as liver disease, due\r\nto the patient's habits of intemperance.\r\n\r\nDr. Dana testified that he knew the deceased well from the time of his\r\ndischarge; that he was called to consult in his case with young Dr.\r\nAdams a few days before the death occurred; that he took a general view\r\nof the case and considered that the trouble was due to habits of\r\nintemperance.\r\n\r\nDr. Sargent deposed that he knew the deceased well and knew that he had\r\nlost a part of his hand, as alleged, from septic poisoning in the Army,\r\nthough he was not aware that the poisoning had left any other effect;\r\nthat the deceased had several spells of alcoholism after the war; that\r\nhe had heard him complain of his kidneys, but attributed his troubles to\r\nhis excesses.\r\n\r\nOther evidence suggested the same cause for sickness and death spoken of\r\nby these physicians, but there seems to be an almost entire absence of\r\nevidence connecting the death with service in the Army.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that a case is not presented in any of its aspects\r\njustifying a pension.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 10, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 6193, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Edson Saxberry.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill filed a declaration for a pension in\r\n1879, alleging that in 1863 he bruised his leg, which became very sore,\r\nand when it began to heal his eyes became sore.\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken upon a careful examination of this application seems\r\nto establish, by the admission of the applicant and by other evidence,\r\nthe correctness of the position taken by the Pension Bureau in rejecting\r\nthe claim, that whatever disability was incurred existed before\r\nenlistment and was in no manner attributable to military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 10, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 2233, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Bernard Carlin.\"\r\n\r\nBy this bill it is proposed to pension the beneficiary therein named as\r\nof Company A, Fourteenth Regiment of Missouri Volunteer Infantry.\r\n\r\nIt seems that he served in the company and regiment named, but that he\r\nalso served in Company A, Sixty-sixth Illinois Regiment, and it is\r\nclaimed that while in the latter service exclusively he received the\r\ninjuries for which a pension is claimed.\r\n\r\nHis application is still pending in the Pension Bureau, and the papers\r\npertaining to the same are now in the hands of an examiner for special\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nI think this should be completed before a special act is passed, and\r\nI understand this to be in accordance with a general rule adopted by\r\nCongress and its pension committees.

He was slightly wounded July 1, 1862, and\r\nappears to have been discharged March 25, 1863, on account of syphilitic\r\niritis. In April, 1863, he entered the general service and acted as a\r\nclerk in the Adjutant-General's Office until April 1, 1864, when he was\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nNeither he nor his widow ever filed a claim in the Pension Bureau, but\r\nan application on behalf of his minor children was filed in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe soldier died on the 8th day of December, 1872, of pneumonia, and his\r\nwidow remarried in 1876.\r\n\r\nThe application on behalf of the children was denied on the ground that\r\nthe death of the soldier was not due to any cause arising from his\r\nmilitary service. The youngest child will reach the age of 16 in\r\nSeptember, 1888.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the report of the Senate committee to whom this bill\r\nwas referred that the second husband, to whom this widow was married\r\nin 1876, is now dead, and it is proposed to pension her as the widow\r\nof John Leary, her first husband, at the rate of $20 per month.\r\n\r\nIn the unusual cases when a widow has been pensioned on account of\r\nthe death of her first husband, notwithstanding her remarriage, which\r\nforfeited her claim under the general law, it has been well established\r\nthat she was again a widow by the death of her second husband, that\r\nbeyond all controversy the death of the first husband was due to his\r\nmilitary service, and such advanced age or disability has been shown\r\non the part of the widow as prevented self-support.\r\n\r\nIn this case the name of the widow is not in the bill; there is hardly\r\nroom for the pretense that her first husband's death was due to his\r\nmilitary service, her age is given as over 40 years, and $20 a month is\r\nallowed her; being considerably more than is generally allowed in cases\r\nwhere a widow's right is clear, with no complications of second\r\nmarriage, and her necessities great.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 14, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:.\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 1762, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Benjamin A. Burtram.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was mustered into the military\r\nservice November 26, 1861; he was reported present until February 28,\r\n1862, and was discharged for disability July 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe medical certificate of the disability of this soldier was made by\r\nthe senior surgeon of a hospital in Louisville, Ky., and stated that the\r\nsoldier had been disabled for sixty days; that his lungs were affected\r\nwith tubercular deposits in both, and that there was some irregularity\r\nin the action of the heart; that he was of consumptive family, his\r\nmother, brother, and two sisters having died of that disease according\r\nto his and his father's account.\r\n\r\nIt is of course supposed that this certificate was based upon an\r\nexamination of the patient, though both he and his father seem to have\r\nsupplemented such an examination with statements establishing a\r\ncondition and history which operated to bring about a discharge.\r\n\r\nI do not find, however, either as the result of examinations or\r\nstatements, any other trouble or disability alleged than those mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nBut in 1879, seventeen years after the soldier's discharge, and\r\nduring the period when arrearages of pensions were allowed on such\r\napplications, he filed a claim for pension, in which he alleged that\r\nabout December 1, 1861, while unloading gun boxes, he incurred a\r\nrupture, and that in January, 1862, he was taken with violent pains in\r\nleft arm and side, causing permanent disability.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the time of the incurrence of these\r\ndisabilities is fixed as quite early in the very short military service\r\nof this soldier; and it certainly seems that, though short, his term of\r\nservice was sufficiently long to develop such disabilities as he claims\r\nto have incurred to such an extent that they neither would have escaped\r\nin the succeeding July the examination of the surgeon nor the mention of\r\nthe soldier.\r\n\r\nA medical examination which followed the application for pension in 1879\r\ndisclosed a large scrotal hernia, but no discoverable trouble of left\r\narm and side.\r\n\r\nA special examination of the case was made and a large amount of\r\ntestimony taken. Without giving it in any detail as it is reported\r\nto me, I fail to find in it reasonably satisfactory proof that the\r\ndisabilities upon which he now bases his claim for a pension were\r\nincurred in the military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_.\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 3038, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of P.E. Parker.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Parker was a surety with six other persons upon an official bond\r\ngiven by one Franklin Travis, a collector of internal revenue, which\r\nbond was dated on the 9th day of May, 1867. A few years after that\r\nthe collector became a defaulter to the Government for something over\r\n$27,000. Suit was commenced against the sureties upon the bond, and the\r\ndefense was presented in their behalf that by reason of the imposition\r\nof new duties and responsibilities upon the collector after the\r\nexecution of the bond his sureties were released. Judgment, however,\r\npassed against them, and the property of the beneficiary named in this\r\nbill was sold upon said judgment for the sum of $2,366.95. But only\r\n$1,793.16 of such amount was paid into the United States Treasury, the\r\nremainder having been applied to the payment of fees and expenses.\r\n\r\nAfter the application of this sum to the payment of the judgment a bill\r\nwas passed by the Congress relieving all these sureties from liability\r\nupon the bond. It appears that the amount above stated was all the money\r\ncollected thereupon. The grant of the relief of these sureties by the\r\nCongress apparently was the same interposed by them to the suit in which\r\nthe judgment was recovered.\r\n\r\nThe present bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the\r\nsurety Parker the sum of $2,336.95, the entire amount for which his\r\nproperty was sold, though the Senate committee to which the bill was\r\nreferred reported in favor of reducing this sum to $1,793.16, the amount\r\nactually received by the United States upon its indebtedness.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the action of Congress in relieving these sureties\r\nwas generous in the extreme, and if money was to be refunded which was\r\napparently legally recovered and collected it should not exceed the\r\namount the Government actually received. The Government is in no default\r\nand should be put to no expense in refunding the small sum recovered on\r\naccount of the defalcation of its officer whose good conduct this\r\nbeneficiary guaranteed. I think it would better subserve public\r\ninterests if no further relief should be granted than that already\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact reported to me which deprives this surety of any\r\nequitable claim for further relief. It appears from an examination of\r\nthis matter that the man who is now attempting to be reimbursed this\r\nmoney from the Government Treasury commenced a suit against his\r\ncosureties for this identical money on the ground of their liability\r\nwith him, and that he actually collected from two of them in such suit\r\nthe sum of $1,747.16.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, it is speaking mildly of the claim he now makes against\r\nthe Government to say that it should not have been presented.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2616, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to James E.

Three medical examinations fail to establish the\r\nexistence of this disease in a pensionable degree, and it is reported to\r\nme from the Pension Bureau that in March, 1882, the family physician of\r\nthe beneficiary stated that though he had practiced in his family for\r\neight or nine years he had no recollection of treating him for quinsy or\r\nany other disease.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that neither the service nor the alleged disability of\r\nthis beneficiary are of a meritorious character.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2370, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Sarah C.

He\r\nwas discharged April 23, 1863, to date November 5, 1862, on a surgeon's\r\ncertificate of disability for \"tertiary syphilis, with ulcerated throat\r\nand extensive nodes on the tibia of both legs.\"\r\n\r\nHe never filed an application for pension. He was admitted to an insane\r\nasylum in September, 1883, suffering with epilepsy, chronic diarrhea,\r\nand dementia, and died of pneumonia on the 26th day of February, 1884.\r\n\r\nHis symptoms and troubles after his discharge, so far as they are\r\nstated, are entirely consistent with the surgeon's certificate of\r\ndisability given at the time of his discharge, and there seems to be an\r\nentire lack of testimony connecting in any reasonable way his death with\r\nany incident of his military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 22, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 2206, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to David H.

Todd, who served as a private in the One hundred and eighteenth\r\nVolunteer Infantry from July, 1863, to May, 1864, when he was\r\ntransferred to the Navy.

Carpenter.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill appropriates the sum of $126.26 to be paid to the beneficiary\r\nnamed therein for his salary as an employee in the Railway Mail Service\r\nfrom the 3d day of October until the 20th day of November, 1882.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter was employed as a railway postal clerk at a salary of $800\r\nper annum. He abandoned his route about the 2d day of October, 1882,\r\nwithout any leave of absence or explanation at the time, leaving his\r\nwork in charge of one Jones, another railway postal clerk. He appears to\r\nhave been paid for all the work he did, unless it be for two or three\r\ndays in October, for which he apparently makes no claim.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the Post-Office Department showing that the absence\r\nof Carpenter was claimed to be on account of sickness, though there are\r\na number of communications relating to the case.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of the Department permit the performance of the duties\r\nof a postal clerk by an associate in case of sickness, but never without\r\nthe written permission of the division superintendent after an\r\narrangement between the parties in writing, signed by them and filed\r\nwith the superintendent.\r\n\r\nAmong a number of communications from Railway Mail Service officials\r\nrelating to the conduct of Carpenter, all tending in the same direction,\r\nthere is a letter from the chief clerk of the Railway Mail Service at\r\nPeoria, Ill., under whose immediate supervision Mr. Carpenter performed\r\nservice, written to the superintendent of the sixth division of said\r\nservice at Chicago, and dated November 16, 1882, containing the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n  I desire to call your attention to the case of W.S. Carpenter, Gilman\r\n  and Springfield R.P.O., as follows: October 10 he was requested to\r\n  appear at the post-office at Springfield, Ill., for examination on\r\n  Illinois scheme. I went to Springfield for the purpose of examining him,\r\n  but he failed to put in an appearance. Upon my return home I found a\r\n  letter from him stating that he did not expect to remain in the service,\r\n  hence his failure to report for examination; and, furthermore, that he\r\n  would send in his resignation to your office by the first of the\r\n  following week. This he had not done the 12th instant. He has not been\r\n  on duty but two days since October 1. He left the run in charge of Mr.\r\n  Jones, of the same line, telling him he did not know when he would\r\n  return, and for Jones to keep up the run. He has no leave of absence,\r\n  either verbally or otherwise. What his motives are for conducting\r\n  himself in this manner I can not imagine. I have written him on the\r\n  subject, but can not hear from him. When in Springfield the 3d instant,\r\n  I requested the postmaster there to not pay Carpenter for October until\r\n  he received notice to do so. I then notified you of the facts in the\r\n  matter. I would respectfully recommend that Carpenter be relieved from\r\n  further duty and a successor be appointed. He is of no account at the\r\n  best; he has no interest in the work, and should be removed. I would\r\n  also recommend that he be paid for but the two days' run in the month\r\n  of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days after the date of this letter Mr. Carpenter was notified that\r\nan order had been issued discontinuing his pay and services.\r\n\r\nThese facts stated present the case of an employee of the Government\r\nabandoning his duties without leave or notice, in direct violation of\r\nrules, and claiming compensation for work done in his absence by another\r\nemployee whose entire services were due the Government.\r\n\r\nTo allow a claim so lacking in merit would endanger discipline and\r\ninvite irregularity and loose methods in a very important branch of the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 27, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 2524, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Clement A. Lounsberry.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill appropriates the sum of $1,214.51 to reimburse him for clerk\r\nhire and fuel and lights in excess of allowances made to him by the\r\nPost-Office Department while he was postmaster at Bismarck, in the\r\nTerritory of Dakota.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred and fifty dollars of this sum is appropriated on account\r\nof clerk hire paid out from April 1, 1881, to June 30, 1882, and $464.51\r\nfor lights and fuel from July 1, 1883, to September 30, 1885.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the allowances made by the Post-Office Department\r\nin these cases ought not to be interfered with. But sometimes a sudden\r\nrush of settlement in a locality, or some other cause, will so increase\r\nunexpectedly the need of clerks to distribute and handle the mails that\r\nthe employment of more than have been provided for is absolutely\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think the item for clerk hire in this bill should be so\r\nregarded. This was the only appropriation included in the bill presented\r\nin the Forty-eighth Congress in behalf of this postmaster upon which a\r\nfavorable committee report was made and which was not unfavorably spoken\r\nof by the Department.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that the other item for fuel and lights should be\r\nallowed. I think it should not, on the grounds that the amount was fixed\r\nby the Department upon full examination, that there is no special reason\r\nshown why the postmaster should have exceeded the expenditures allowed,\r\nand that to give the least encouragement to postmasters that these\r\nallowances would be upon their application revised and increased by\r\nCongress would lead to demoralization in the service.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the allowance made to this officer for fuel and lights\r\nwas increased October 1, 1883, and although the claim now made on this\r\naccount embraces the period from July 1, 1883, to September, 1885,\r\nnothing was asked for fuel or lights in the bill presented to Congress\r\nfor this beneficiary's relief in 1884.\r\n\r\nIt should not have been tacked upon the bill now presented.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 27, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 288, entitled \"An act for the\r\nerection of a public building at Sioux City, Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th day of June, 1886, I was constrained to disapprove a bill\r\nembracing the same subject covered by the bill herewith returned.\r\nFurther investigation on the second presentation of the matter fails to\r\nconvince me that $150,000 should be expended at present for the erection\r\nof a public building at Sioux City.\r\n\r\nFrom all the representations that are made in an effort to show the\r\nnecessity for this building I gather that the only two purposes for\r\nwhich the Government should furnish quarters at this place are a term\r\nof the United States court not specially crowded with business and the\r\npost-office, which, though perhaps crowded, I am sure can get on very\r\nwell for a time without a larger public building.\r\n\r\nAs far as the court is concerned, it was agreed when a term was located\r\nthere in 1882 that it might be held in the county building, which from\r\nthe description furnished me seems to be entirely adequate for the\r\npurpose and very well arranged. The term held in October, 1887, was in\r\nsession for nine days.\r\n\r\nI am decidedly of the opinion that if a public building is to be located\r\nat Sioux City it had better be delayed until a better judgment can be\r\nformed of its future necessity and proper size.\r\n\r\nI see some of the parties interested have such confidence in the growth\r\nand coming needs of the place that in their opinion the work ought not\r\nto be entered upon with a less appropriation than $500,000.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 1, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9363, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Edwin J.

Is utterly worthless and unfit for the\r\n  Veteran Reserve Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his discharge the second charge of desertion was removed, and the\r\nfirst charge does not seem to be serious. But he was injured while home\r\non a furlough, his regiment still being in camp within the State of his\r\nresidence; and although there are cases in which it seems not improper\r\nthat pensions should be granted for injuries sustained during furlough\r\nand before actual return to duty, this does not appear to me to be one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 6, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 2507, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Russel L.

I do not understand that it has ever been claimed that a parent\r\nshould be pensioned for the death of a son who had been in the Army\r\nunless his death could be traced in some way to his army service.\r\n\r\nWhile this case is probably one where the exercise of generosity would\r\nbe pleasant and most timely to the recipient, I can not think that such\r\na precedent should be established.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9372, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to John Dean.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was mustered into the service of the\r\nUnited States February 25, 1863. He never went to the front, but while\r\nin camp at Staten Island, on the 21st day of April, 1863, was granted a\r\npass for forty-eight hours, and on account of sickness did not again\r\nrejoin his company or regiment. The charge of desertion made against him\r\nhas been removed. The Surgeon-General's report shows that he was treated\r\nat quarters on Staten Island in April, 1863, for syphilis, rheumatism,\r\nand debility.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to Charity Hospital, Blackwells Island, New York Harbor,\r\nAugust 5, 1863, and discharged November 18, 1863. He was admitted to the\r\nLadies' General Hospital in New York December 1, 1863, and was\r\ndischarged from the service for disability April 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe discharge was granted, as stated by the surgeon of volunteers in\r\ncharge of the hospital, \"because of sloughing of both corneas from\r\ninflammation contracted while absent without leave, having received a\r\nforty-eight-hour pass from his regiment April 15, 1863, then stationed\r\non Staten Island.

He is now blind, and\r\nwhile his case is certainly a pitiable one I am forced to the belief\r\nthat the conclusions reached in 1879 upon his application, that his\r\ndisease was contracted while absent without leave and that his\r\ndisability was due to syphilis, were correct.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 217, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to C.T.

Two witnesses indicate that domestic trouble was the cause\r\nof the soldier's suicide. Another says that his wife (the beneficiary)\r\nwas a pretty rough woman--a hard talker--and that the soldier often\r\nconsulted him about the matter, and said it was hard to live with her.\r\nThis witness adds that he does not believe that the soldier would have\r\ncommitted suicide if she had not abused him till he could not longer\r\nendure it.\r\n\r\nThe special examiner, in summing up the proof, says in his report:\r\n\r\n  The general opinion in the community is to the effect that his wife\r\n  drove him to commit suicide rather than to live with or to obtain a\r\n  divorce from her. Her reputation is that of a virago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis kind of evidence, while not perhaps determining the case,\r\nreconciles me to the conclusion, which seems inevitable from other\r\nfacts developed, that the military service and prison experience of the\r\ndeceased were in no manner connected with his death.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 7717, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mrs. Catharine Reed.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this beneficiary served in the Army from July 25, 1862,\r\nto October 16, 1862, when he was discharged for disease of the lungs.\r\nHe was pensioned for hernia and disease of the lungs.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of November, 1880, while working in a sawmill, a piece of\r\nboard was thrown from a buzz saw and struck him in the groin, causing a\r\nwound from which he died two days afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to connect this injury and the resulting death with the\r\ndisability for which he was pensioned.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 7, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 4855, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Jacob Newhard.\"\r\n\r\nThe records show that this beneficiary was mustered into the service\r\nAugust 20, 1862, as a lieutenant; that on the return for November, 1862,\r\nhe is reported as \"absent without leave--left hospital at Louisville.\"\r\nHe was treated for hemorrhoids in the hospital at Nashville from\r\nDecember 12 to December 23, 1862, when, having served a few days more\r\nthan four months, he tendered his resignation upon the ground of\r\ndisability and procured the following surgeon's certificate, upon which\r\nhis resignation was based:\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant Jacob Newhard having applied for a certificate upon which to\r\n  ground a resignation, I do hereby certify that I have carefully examined\r\n  this officer and find him suffering from hemorrhoids, * * * and in\r\n  consequence thereof is, in my opinion, unfit for duty.

\"Joint resolution to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to\r\ncertify lands to the State of Kansas for the benefit of agriculture and\r\nthe mechanic arts,\" and I therefore return the same with a statement of\r\nmy objections thereto.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress passed July 2, 1862, certain public lands were\r\ngranted to such of the several States as should provide colleges for the\r\nbenefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of this act the State of Kansas was entitled to 90,000\r\nacres of land, subject, however, to the provisions of said statute,\r\nwhich declared that when lands which had been raised to double the\r\nminimum price, in consequence of railroad grants, should be selected by\r\na State such lands should be computed at the maximum price and the\r\nnumber of acres proportionately diminished.\r\n\r\nOf the lands selected by the State of Kansas, and which have been\r\ncertified, 7,682.92 acres were within certain limits of a railroad\r\ngrant, and had therefore been raised to the double minimum in price, so\r\nthat the number of acres mentioned and thus situated really stood for\r\ndouble that number of acres in filling the grant to which the State of\r\nKansas was entitled.\r\n\r\nIt is now claimed that after the selection of these lands the route\r\nof said railroad was abandoned and another one selected, and that in\r\nconsequence thereof such lands included within its first location were\r\nreduced to the minimum price and restored to public market at that rate.\r\nIt is supposed upon these allegations that justice and equity require\r\nthat an additional grant should now be made to the State of Kansas from\r\nthe public lands equal to the number of acres selected within the limits\r\nof the first railroad location.\r\n\r\nBut an examination discloses that the joint resolution is predicated\r\nupon an entire misunderstanding of the facts.\r\n\r\nThe lands heretofore mentioned as amounting to more than 7,000 acres,\r\nselected by the State of Kansas, and charged at double that amount\r\nbecause their price had been raised to the double minimum in consequence\r\nof their being within a railroad location, have all except 320 acres\r\nremained either in the new or old railroad location up to the present\r\ntime, and if now vacant would be held by the Government at the double\r\nminimum price.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear to me that the State of Kansas has been granted all the\r\npublic land to which it can lay any legal or equitable claim under the\r\nlaw of 1862.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 10, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_.\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 2201, entitled \"An\r\nact for the relief of Laura E. Maddox, widow and executrix, and Robert\r\nMorrison, executor, of Joseph H. Maddox, deceased.\"\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress approved July 2, 1864, provided among other things\r\nthat the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President,\r\nmight authorize agents \"to purchase for the United States any products\r\nof States declared in insurrection, at such price as should be agreed on\r\nwith the seller, not exceeding the market price thereof at the place of\r\ndelivery.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of said act the Secretary of the Treasury, with the\r\napproval of the President, prescribed rules and regulations to govern\r\nthe transactions thus permitted, and appointed one H.A. Risley an agent\r\nto act for the United States in making such purchases.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 13th day of November, 1864, said Risley entered into a\r\nwritten contract with Joseph H. Maddox and two other parties, whereby\r\nthe latter agreed to sell and deliver to Risley as such agent, at\r\nNorfolk or New York, 6,000 boxes of tobacco, 350 barrels of turpentine,\r\nand 700 barrels of rosin. It was also agreed that all products\r\ntransported under the contract should be consigned to said Risley as\r\nagent and shipped on a Government transport, or, if not so shipped,\r\nshould be in the immediate charge of an agent of Risley's, whose\r\ncompensation and expenses should be paid by the sellers. Said products\r\nwere to be sold in New York or Baltimore under Risley's direction, and\r\none-fourth of the proceeds, after deducting certain expenses, costs, and\r\ncharges, were to be retained for the United States and three-fourths\r\npaid to Maddox and his associates. It was expressly provided in said\r\ncontract as follows:\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this contract contained shall be construed as incurring\r\n  any liability on behalf of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that Maddox, very soon after the contract was made, acquired\r\nall the interest of his associates therein.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States signed an order or permit for the\r\ntransportation of the goods, in fulfillment of the contract, and for the\r\npassage of the parties selling such goods through the Federal military\r\nlines, the permit declaring, however, that such transportation and\r\npassage should be \"with strict compliance with the regulations of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and for the fulfillment of said contract with\r\nthe agent of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMaddox and his associates were not at the time the contract was entered\r\ninto the owners of any of the property they agreed to sell and deliver;\r\nbut it is alleged that Maddox, as one of the parties to the contract and\r\nas assignee of his co-contractors, purchased 4,042 boxes of tobacco,\r\nworth at that time more than $735,000, for the purpose of fulfilling\r\nthis contract.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco was purchased by him within the rebel lines in the State of\r\nVirginia. A part of it, he charges, was forcibly taken by the military\r\nforces of the Government and converted to its use or destroyed while\r\nbeing transported to its destination, and the remainder of it, having\r\nbeen detained in storage at Richmond, Va., was afterwards appropriated\r\nto the use of the United States or was destroyed in the fires at\r\nRichmond upon the capture of the city by the United States forces in\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nAn action predicated upon the contract with Risley was brought by Maddox\r\nin the Court of Claims to recover the value of this property, but it was\r\nheld by the court that the contract was void.\r\n\r\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States the decision of the\r\nCourt of Claims was affirmed, upon the ground, as had been previously\r\ndecided by said court, that under the law, the Treasury regulations,\r\nand the Executive orders concerning the purchase of products of\r\ninsurrectionary States a purchasing agent of the Government had no\r\nauthority to negotiate with anyone in relation to the purchase of such\r\nproducts unless at the time of the negotiation the party either owned\r\nor controlled them; that neither the law nor the regulations for its\r\nexecution protected a speculation wherein the products to be sold were\r\nto be procured by the contractor within the rebel lines after the\r\ncontract was made; that private citizens were prohibited from trading at\r\nall in the insurrectionary districts, and that the object of the law and\r\nthe regulations to carry it into effect was to encourage the insurgents\r\nthemselves to bring their products to agents of the Government.\r\n\r\nWith this adverse decision all chance of recovery upon legal grounds\r\nof before the courts was dissipated. But recourse to Congress still\r\nremained. As appears from a memorandum furnished in support of this\r\nbill, the alleged equities of the case were presented to the\r\nForty-second, the Forty-third, the Forty-fourth, the Forty-fifth, the\r\nForty-sixth, the Forty-eighth, and the Forty-ninth Congresses. Two\r\nadverse and more than two favorable committee reports have been made\r\nupon the claim. No bill for the relief of the claimant has, however,\r\npassed Congress until the present session, when a favorable condition\r\nseems to have presented itself.\r\n\r\nThe bill herewith returned empowers and directs the accounting officers\r\nof the Treasury to settle and pay to the representatives of Maddox the\r\namount found due him on account of the loss and damage he sustained by\r\nthe seizure by our military forces of the tobacco purchased by him under\r\nthe agreement referred to, excluding, however, the tobacco destroyed\r\nby fire in the city of Richmond, and provides that said claim shall be\r\ndetermined upon the evidence taken and now on file in the office of the\r\nclerk of the United States Court of Claims and the War Department and\r\nany other competent evidence.\r\n\r\nI fail to appreciate the equities which entitle this claimant to further\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nEvery intelligent man should be charged with the knowledge that\r\nas a general rule commercial intercourse with the enemy is entirely\r\ninconsistent with a state of war, and that the law of 1864 had for its\r\nobject the encouragement of the insurgents themselves to bring their\r\nproducts to us, and not the authorization of persons to roam through the\r\ninsurrectionary districts and purchase their products on speculation.\r\n\r\nEven if the claimant did not understand these conditions, he certainly\r\nknew that his contract was based upon a statute; that the agent with\r\nwhom he was contracting was a creature of statute, and that such statute\r\nand certain regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury made thereunder\r\nregulated the right and limited the action of all the parties to said\r\ncontract. These things sufficiently appear from the very terms of the\r\ncontract and the permit signed by the President. The privileges and\r\nliberties contained in this permit are expressly granted \"with strict\r\ncompliance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nIf before or after entering into this contract the claimant had\r\nexamined these regulations, he would have found that they provided that\r\n\"commercial intercourse with localities beyond the lines of actual\r\nmilitary occupation by the United States forces is absolutely\r\nprohibited.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have also found that such regulations expressly provided that\r\nthe power of the agent of the Government to make contracts should be\r\nfounded upon the statement that the contractor then owned or controlled\r\nthe products for which he contracted. And yet the permit of the\r\nPresident, which so completely put the claimant upon inquiry as to what\r\nhe might or might not do, seems now to be relied upon as the source of\r\nequities in his favor, and is pressed into his service under the guise\r\nof a sanction of his unlawful proceedings.\r\n\r\nBesides the general knowledge the claimant should have possessed of\r\nthe commercial disabilities consequent upon a state of war, and the\r\ninformation afforded him by his contract and permit, a proclamation of\r\nthe President publicly issued September 24, 1864,[17] furnished abundant\r\nnotice of the kind of trading which would be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe property for which compensation is asked constitutes a part only of\r\nthat agreed to be furnished. None of it ever reached the possession of\r\nthe agent of the Government, but, as I understand the case, was at the\r\ntime of its seizure or destruction still in the territory of the enemy\r\nand in rebellious possession. If in the circumstances detailed it was\r\ntreated by our military forces in like manner as other property in the\r\nsame situation, there would seem to be no hardship in holding that the\r\ncontractor assumed this risk as one arising from his unauthorized and,\r\nif successful, his profitable venture.\r\n\r\nNot being satisfied that there are any especial equities which entitle\r\nthis claim to more consideration than many others where equities might\r\nbe claimed in behalf of those who long ago violated our nonintercourse\r\nlaws, I am unwilling to sanction a precedent which if followed might\r\nsubstantially work a repeal of these laws, regarded necessary and\r\nexpedient by those charged with legislation during the War of the\r\nRebellion, and who had in full view all the necessities of that period.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See Executive order of September 24, 1864, Vol. VI, pp.\r\n240-241.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 12, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 3276, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting restoration of pension to Sarah A.

Willbur with the United States and to pay said\r\nWillbur such sum of money as may be found due him thereon.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim mentioned in this bill grows out of alleged extra work done by\r\nthe claimant in the construction of the post-office and court-house\r\nbuilding in the city of New York.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in September, 1874, entered into a contract with\r\nMessrs. Bartlett, Robbins & Co. by which they agreed to furnish\r\nand put in place certain wrought and cast iron work and glass for the\r\nilluminated tiling required for the said building according to certain\r\nspecifications and schedules which formed a part of said contract. The\r\nwork was to be of a specified thickness and the contractors were to be\r\npaid for the same at certain rates per superficial foot. The approximate\r\nestimate for the entire work was specified at $35,577.56. Samples of the\r\ntiling to be put in were submitted to the Supervising Architect and\r\naccepted by him.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1874, the claimant entered into an agreement in writing with\r\nBartlett, Robbins & Co. to do this work as subcontractor for them at\r\ncertain prices for each superficial foot of said tiling put in place.\r\n\r\nIn neither contract was the weight of the tiling mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe work was, under the contract with Messrs. Bartlett, Robbins & Co.,\r\ncompleted, and after such completion and the measurement of the work the\r\nsaid firm of Bartlett, Robbins & Co. were paid by the Government the sum\r\nof $35,217.57, in full satisfaction of their contract with the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt appears that after the completion of the work the claimant gave\r\nnotice to the Government that he had a claim against Bartlett, Robbins &\r\nCo., growing out of said work, for the sum of $8,744.44, and requested\r\nthat payment be withheld from said firm until his claim against them was\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nThe fact that said claim had been made having been communicated by the\r\nSupervising Architect to Bartlett, Robbins & Co., on the 22d day of\r\nAugust, 1876, they responded to the Supervising Architect as follows:\r\n\r\n  SIR: We inclose copy of our account against Willbur and the Illuminated\r\n  Tiling Company and a copy of Willbur's assignment to the Tile Company,\r\n  which includes a copy of his agreement with us; and when the Department\r\n  settles the measurement of the work the items in the contract will show\r\n  just what the amount is, and, as we have repeatedly assured him, he will\r\n  have all the measurements the Government gives us.\r\n\r\n  If anyone has cause of complaint in this case it is us. Four times the\r\n  work came to a stand, or nearly so, and our Mr. B. was compelled to go\r\n  to New York and stay until it was moving again, charging his expenses,\r\n  by Willbur 's request, and finally it had to be finished by others, etc.\r\n  We know this does not interest you particularly, as you do not know him\r\n  in the matter, but there has been so much willful misrepresentation we\r\n  thought silence might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\n  It is charitable to think Willbur must be crazy.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\n  BARTLETT, ROBBINS & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an opinion of the Solicitor of the Treasury concerning this claim,\r\ndated November 30, 1883, I find a statement that on the 20th day of\r\nOctober, 1876, a paper was filed by the attorneys of the claimant in\r\nwhich his claim for extra work and material in performing his contract\r\nwas alleged to be $21,857.94. It is further stated that this claim was\r\nhastily drawn by one of Willbur 's attorneys and without consultation\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 20th day of March, 1877, Mr. Willbur himself filed a\r\nstatement of such extra work and material, in which he claimed for the\r\nsame the sum of $42,685.20.\r\n\r\nAnother statement made by Willbur, in February, 1878, presents a claim\r\non account of the same matters amounting to $47,159.62.\r\n\r\nThis claim, so variously stated, is based upon the allegation that\r\ntiling and frames of greater thickness than were required by the\r\ncontract were put in the building. Although it is insisted by the\r\nclaimant that these thicker tiles and frames were directed to be put in,\r\nor at least accepted by the person having charge of the construction of\r\nthe building for the Government, I hardly think it will be seriously\r\ncontended that the claimant has any legal claim against the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut, with a view of discovering whether, upon equitable grounds, the\r\nclaimant should be paid anything by the Government for glass and iron\r\nof greater thickness than its contract with Bartlett, Robbins & Co.\r\nrequired, and which had been put in its building by their subcontractor,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury in 1884 appointed a committee of three\r\npersons to examine and report upon this claim of Willbur's, \"with a view\r\nof determining what portion, if any, it is proper for the Government\r\nto pay.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 24th day of January, 1885, this committee made a report by which\r\nthey determined that there should be paid to the claimant on account of\r\nthe matters alleged the sum of $1,214.90.\r\n\r\nThis report was based upon the measurements, examinations, and estimates\r\nof two experts, one selected by the claimant and the other by the\r\ncommittee. The report was transmitted to the House of Representatives by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury and an appropriation asked to pay the\r\namount awarded.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Willbur was not satisfied, and on the 6th day of January, 1885,\r\naddressed a communication to the Secretary of the Treasury in which this\r\npassage occurs:\r\n\r\n  I shall insist on a remeasurement of the entire work, as this is vital\r\n  to my claim. The excess which I furnished can only be ascertained by\r\n  weight instead of by measuring the thickness of the plates and frames.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the second session of the Forty-ninth Congress, and early in 1886,\r\nthis claim was before the Senate Committee on Claims, and at the\r\ninstance of the committee this work was again examined by experts, who\r\ncame to the conclusion that the claimant was entitled to the sum of\r\n$45,615.67 for the extra work which he had performed and materials\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nIt is only alleged that the glass tiling and frames actually put in the\r\nbuilding were slightly thicker than those required by the contract, and\r\nthis alleged increased thickness seems to be fairly represented in a\r\ngeneral way by the claim that some of the glass and frames which were\r\nrequired to be 1 inch thick were actually put in 1 inch and a quarter\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nUpon this statement it must be admitted that the sum above stated as the\r\nvalue of this extra thickness is somewhat startling. In the language of\r\nthe report upon this bill by the Supervising Architect, \"a claim of\r\n$47,159.02 for such slight excess on work the price of which was\r\n$35,217.57 is hardly entitled to consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim, as well as the award of the experts last named, reach their\r\nastonishing proportions by the application of weights to the question\r\nin the following manner: A certain area is measured. A square foot of\r\nthe tiling actually put in is weighed, and a square foot of the tiling\r\nrequired by the contract is also weighed. Both these weights are\r\nmultiplied by the area. The lesser aggregate weight is deducted from the\r\ngreater, and the difference is divided by the weight of a square foot of\r\nthe lightest tiling, thus reducing it to square feet of such lightest\r\ntile. These square feet are multiplied by the price agreed to be paid\r\nby the contract for each superficial foot, and an item of extra work is\r\ndetermined. Thus additional weight in constructed and finished tiling is\r\nconverted, as far as price and measurement are concerned, into finished\r\ntile, which more than doubles the quantity actually laid down.\r\n\r\nThis can not be right. And yet the bill herewith returned directs the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to settle this claim for extra work upon\r\nthe basis of the report of the experts who have adopted this mode of\r\nadjustment; or, if not satisfied with their report, he shall within\r\nthirty days from the passage of the act cause a reweighing of said\r\nmaterial to be made by two sworn experts, one to be appointed by him and\r\none by the claimant, and a third to be appointed by these two in case\r\nthey can not agree. The bill further provides that he shall then pay\r\nto said Willbur the difference of excess in weight and superficial\r\nmeasurement as found by said experts between the illuminated tiling and\r\nframes furnished and that contracted for at the contract prices for such\r\nwork and material.\r\n\r\nThere are features of this claim which suggest suspicion as to its\r\nmerit. In any view of the matter, I regard the claimant as seeking\r\nequitable relief. He is not entitled to dictate the rule by which his\r\nclaim is to be adjusted, and he should be quite satisfied if the\r\nofficers of the Government charged with the settlement of such matters\r\nare permitted by the Congress to afford equitable relief according to\r\nsuch rules and methods as are best calculated to reach fair results.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 15, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 3306, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mary K.

Bradshaw.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary mentioned in this bill was mustered into the military\r\nservice as first lieutenant on the 28th day of October, 1861.\r\n\r\nAbout eight months afterwards, and in June, 1862, he resigned from the\r\nservice, his resignation being based upon a surgeon's certificate which\r\nhe procured, and which is as follows:\r\n\r\n  William S. Bradshaw having applied for a certificate to accompany his\r\n  resignation, I do hereby certify that I have carefully examined this\r\n  officer and find that his disease is of a chronic pleuritic character,\r\n  contracted (previous to his entering the service) four years since from\r\n  an injury received in shoeing a fractious horse, in consequence of which\r\n  he was laid up for a number of weeks with a severe attack of pleuritis;\r\n  that he has never been able to endure severe labor since; that since\r\n  entering the service active drilling or marching has invariably\r\n  developed severe pleuritic pains about his chest and underneath his\r\n  sternum, rendering him totally unfit for duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is entirely evident that the statements contained in this certificate\r\nare of such a nature that they must have almost entirely been\r\ncommunicated to the surgeon by the officer himself. It will be observed\r\nthat there is an absolute lack of any intimation that his disabilities\r\nwere attributable in their origin to army service, and he surely can not\r\nask us to believe that a man with the intelligence fitting him to be a\r\ncommissioned officer in the Army, and having this certificate in his\r\npossession, did not know what it contained.\r\n\r\nIt furnished the reason for his honorable discharge in the dark days of\r\nhis country's need and operated as an exemption from further military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in September, 1883, more than twenty-one years after his dis;\r\ncharge, he applied to the Pension Bureau for a pension, alleging\r\nlameness of breast and back, contracted in the service.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination of all the facts I can not believe that this is a\r\ncase in which a pension should be granted.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 7657, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mary Woodworth, widow of Ebenezer F. Woodworth.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this beneficiary enlisted October 1, 1861. On the rolls\r\nof his company for May and June, 1862, he is reported as a deserter, and\r\nthe report is the same on the muster-out roll of his regiment, dated\r\nOctober 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made on the application by the beneficiary for pension\r\nto the Pension Bureau to attribute the charge of desertion to the\r\nunfriendliness and injustice of the soldier's captain, and an\r\nunsuccessful effort was made to have the charge removed from the record\r\nby the Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\nThe soldier, therefore, is still recorded as a deserter from camp near\r\nFarmington, Miss., since March 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe application of the widow to the Pension Bureau in 1867 states that\r\nher husband was missing at Hamburg, Tenn., May 7, 1862, and not having\r\nsince been heard from is supposed to be dead.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the company testifies that the soldier was employed with\r\nthe ambulance corps, and that for misconduct he (the captain) ordered\r\nhim to his company and censured him; that very soon after that the\r\nsoldier was absent at roll call and was marked as absent without leave;\r\nthat in a day or two after that a member of a detail returned to camp\r\nfrom Hamburg Landing and reported that he had seen the soldier there\r\nand had been told by him that \"he was off and would never go back.\"\r\nThereupon he was dropped from the roll as a deserter.\r\n\r\nVarious theories are presented to account for the soldier's absence in\r\nother ways than by desertion, some of his comrades going so far as to\r\nexpress the opinion that he was murdered at the instigation of his\r\ncaptain. None of these theories, however, seem to be more than\r\nconjectures with various degrees of plausibility.\r\n\r\nIf the question of desertion could be solved favorably to the\r\nbeneficiary, another difficulty immediately arises from the fact that\r\nthere is absolutely no proof of death except the soldier's long absence\r\nwithout knowledge of his whereabouts; and if his death could be presumed\r\nthe cause of it and whether connected at all with military service are\r\nmatters regarding which we have no information whatever.\r\n\r\nI am unable to see how a case in such a situation can be considered a\r\nproper subject for favorable pension legislation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 10661, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Mrs. Sophia Vogelsang.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband of this beneficiary was severely wounded in the military\r\nservice of the United States, and in consequence of said wound his\r\nleft leg was amputated. This was in 1862. In January, 1863, another\r\namputation was performed higher up above the knee. He appears at that\r\ntime to have been living, or at least was treated, at Detroit, Mich.\r\nHe was pensioned at the rate of $30 per month at the time of his death,\r\nwhich occurred at Louisville, Ky., where he appears to have then\r\nresided, on the 21st day of July, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary filed a claim for pension in November, 1885, alleging\r\nthat her husband died of gangrene.\r\n\r\nThere does not, however, seem to be a particle of evidence establishing\r\nthat cause of death. On the contrary, the report received at the Pension\r\nBureau of his death attributes it to sunstroke, and this does not seem\r\nto be directly questioned.\r\n\r\nThe report of the House committee to whom this bill was referred\r\nproceeds upon the theory that death was caused from the use of opium to\r\nallay the pain of the wound. This theory is presented upon the alleged\r\nopinion of the surgeon living in Detroit, who made the second amputation\r\nin 1863. He says that the pain of the wound obliged the soldier to\r\ntake morphine. But it does not appear that he observed the case for a\r\nlong time preceding death. Instead of his giving an opinion that the\r\ndisability and morphine produced death, he says, as it is reported to\r\nme, after describing the condition of the limb previous to its\r\namputation in 1863 and immediately thereafter:\r\n\r\n  According to my opinion, said disability and the constant use of\r\n  morphia in consequence of it may have been the cause of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and the statement of a druggist in Louisville that he sold him\r\nmorphine to alleviate pain, and of two different persons with whom he\r\nboarded at that city in 1885 to the same effect, is all the evidence\r\nthat I can discover tending in the least to hint that the death of the\r\npensioner resulted from any cause but sunstroke, which really stands as\r\nthe undisputed cause of death.\r\n\r\nThe allegation in the committee's report that the beneficiary's claim\r\nwas rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that her husband's\r\ndeath proceeded from the use of morphine is erroneous. The cause of\r\nrejection is stated to be \"that the death cause (sunstroke) was not the\r\nresult of the soldier's military service.\"\r\n\r\nWe are not, therefore, left to the consideration of the question whether\r\ndeath from the use of morphine to allay pain can be charged to the\r\ndisability incurred, for if death resulted from sunstroke it will hardly\r\nbe claimed that it was in any way related to such disability.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 16, 1888_\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 6201, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to John Robeson.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted August 8, 1862, and was\r\ndischarged for disability on the 21st day of November, 1862, after a\r\nservice of a little more than three months.\r\n\r\nIn the certificate of disability upon which his discharge was granted\r\nthe captain of the beneficiary's company states that \"he has been unfit\r\nfor duty for sixty days; that the soldier represents that he has not\r\ndone efficient service since enlistment by reason of phthisic, from\r\nwhich he has suffered since childhood, but has grown worse since\r\nentering the service.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon of the regiment states in said certificate that \"the soldier\r\nhas asthma, with which he has been afflicted from his infancy.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this certificate, based necessarily so far as his previous\r\ncondition is concerned, this man procured his discharge after doing but\r\nvery slight service.\r\n\r\nHe filed an application for pension in the Pension Bureau in October,\r\n1879, basing his claim upon the allegation that he contracted asthma in\r\nSeptember, 1862, about a month after he entered the service.\r\n\r\nTwo special examinations were had in his case, and his statement was\r\ntaken in each.\r\n\r\nOn the first examination he said he could not account for the statements\r\nof his captain and surgeon, unless they arose from a remark he made that\r\nhe had phthisic when he was small.\r\n\r\nOn the second he accounted for the statements of the captain and surgeon\r\nby saying that he felt very sick and feared that he could not live if he\r\nremained in the service; that he was suffering with jaundice as well as\r\nasthma; and having been told that he could not be discharged on account\r\nof jaundice, but could on account of asthma, he asked the captain to\r\ntell the surgeon that he had known him to have asthma before enlistment.\r\nHe also says that he procured others to tell the same story.\r\n\r\nOn these examinations there was the usual negative testimony produced of\r\ncertain parties who knew the claimant before enlistment and did not know\r\nthat he was afflicted. This is balanced by the evidence of others, who\r\ntestify that the claimant had asthma before enlistment.\r\n\r\nUpon consideration of the character of the ailment, the testimony upon\r\nthe two examinations, and the conduct of the beneficiary and his own\r\nadmissions, I can not escape the conviction that whatever disability he\r\nhad at the date of discharge he had when he enlisted, and that his claim\r\nwas properly rejected by the Pension Bureau.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9106, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Peter Liner.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill enlisted as a sergeant in the Regular\r\nArmy in 1871, and he alleges that he served a previous term of\r\nenlistment, commencing in 1866.\r\n\r\nWhile on a march from one post to another on the frontier, in September,\r\n1874, the beneficiary was severely wounded by the bursting of a gun,\r\nnecessitating the amputation of three of his fingers.\r\n\r\nThe reports of this occurrence develop the fact that the gun which burst\r\nin his hands was a shotgun, and that the accident happened while the\r\nbeneficiary was hunting \"for his own pleasure or benefit.\"\r\n\r\nHis wound was a severe one, and the injured man was probably a good\r\nand faithful soldier, but it seems quite clear to me that it would be\r\nextending the pension theory to an unwarrantable limit to hold the\r\nGovernment responsible for such an accident.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _October 16, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 10563, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to William S.

This claim was also rejected, on\r\nthe ground that the death causes, \"nervous prostration and spinal\r\ntrouble,\" were not due to the service.\r\n\r\nBoth of these cases were appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, and\r\nin the decision of said appeals it is stated that upon an application\r\nfor a discharge from the service the soldier first set up an injury to\r\nhis back from a fall while on drill; that the regimental surgeon refused\r\nto entertain this proposition; that the next day the soldier returned,\r\nand upon the representations of himself and his captain that his trouble\r\ndated back of the alleged accident upon drill and was chronic the\r\ncertificate for discharge was made out, and pursuant thereto his\r\ndischarge was granted.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that, considering the cause of death and all the\r\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, the certificate of\r\ndischarge which the soldier himself procured to be made out should stand\r\nas stating the true origin of his disability; and if the certificate was\r\nset aside and all the facts tending to support it were disregarded, the\r\ncause of death would still, in my opinion, appear to be disconnected\r\nwith military service.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the title to all that territory lying between the north and\r\nsouth forks of the Red River and the hundredth degree of longitude and\r\njurisdiction over the same are vested in the United States, it being a\r\npart of the Indian Territory, as shown by surveys and investigation made\r\non behalf of the United States, which territory the State of Texas also\r\nclaims title to and jurisdiction over; and\r\n\r\nWhereas said conflicting claim grows out of a controversy existing\r\nbetween the United States and the State of Texas as to the point where\r\nthe hundredth degree of longitude crosses the Red River, as described in\r\nthe treaty of February 22, 1819, between the United States and Spain,\r\nfixing the boundary line between the two countries; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the commissioners appointed on the part of the United States\r\nunder the act of January 31, 1885, authorizing the appointment of a\r\ncommission by the President to run and mark the boundary lines between\r\na portion of the Indian Territory and the State of Texas, in connection\r\nwith a similar commission to be appointed by the State of Texas, have\r\nby their report determined that the South Fork is the true Red River\r\ndesignated in the treaty, the commissioners appointed on the part of\r\nsaid State refusing to concur in said report:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby admonish and warn all persons, whether claiming to act as\r\nofficers of the county of Greer, in the State of Texas, or otherwise,\r\nagainst selling or disposing of, or attempting to sell or dispose of,\r\nany of said lands or from exercising or attempting to exercise any\r\nauthority over said lands.\r\n\r\nAnd I also warn and admonish all persons against purchasing any part of\r\nsaid territory from any person or persons whomsoever.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 30th day of December, A.D. 1887,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwelfth.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  T.F.

Every applicant for examination for the classified departmental\r\n  service must support the statements of his application paper by\r\n  certificates of persons acquainted with him, residents of the State,\r\n  Territory, or District in which he claims _bona fide_ residence;\r\n  and the Commission shall prescribe the form and number of such\r\n  certificates.\r\n\r\n  10. A false statement made by an applicant, or connivance by him with\r\n  any person to make on his behalf a false statement in any certificate\r\n  required by the Commission, and deception or fraud practiced by an\r\n  applicant, or by any person on his behalf with his consent, to influence\r\n  an examination, shall be good cause for refusal to examine such\r\n  applicant or for refusing to mark his papers after examination.\r\n\r\n  11. All examinations shall be prepared and conducted under the\r\n  supervision of the Commission; and examination papers shall be marked\r\n  under rules made by the Commission, which shall take care that the\r\n  marking examiners do not know the name of any competitor in an\r\n  examination for admission whose papers are intrusted to them.\r\n\r\n  12. For the purpose of marking examination papers boards of examiners\r\n  shall be appointed by the Commission, one to be known as the central\r\n  board, which shall be composed of persons in the classified service, who\r\n  shall be detailed for constant duty at the office of the Commission.\r\n  Under supervision of the Commission the central board shall mark the\r\n  papers of the copyist and of the clerk examinations, and such of the\r\n  papers of the supplementary, special, and promotion examinations for the\r\n  departmental service and of examinations for admission to or promotion\r\n  in the other branches of the classified services as shall be submitted\r\n  to it by the Commission.\r\n\r\n  13. No person shall be appointed to membership on any board of examiners\r\n  until after the Commission shall have consulted with the head of the\r\n  Department or of the office under whom such person is serving.\r\n\r\n  14. An examiner shall be allowed time during office hours to perform his\r\n  duties as examiner, which duties shall be considered part of his\r\n  official duties.\r\n\r\n  15.

Each board shall keep such records and make such reports as the\r\n  Commission may require, and such records shall be open to the inspection\r\n  of any member of this Commission or other person acting under authority\r\n  of the Commission, which may, for the purposes of investigation, take\r\n  possession of such records.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL RULE IV.\r\n\r\n  1. The names of all competitors who shall successfully pass an\r\n  examination shall be entered upon a register, and the competitors whose\r\n  names have been thus registered shall be eligible to any office or place\r\n  to test fitness for which the examination was held.\r\n\r\n  2. The Commission may refuse to certify--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) An eligible who is so defective in sight, speech, or hearing,\r\n  or who is otherwise so defective physically as to be apparently unfit to\r\n  perform the duties of the position to which he is seeking appointment.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) An eligible who has made a false statement in his\r\n  application, or been guilty of fraud or deceit in any matter connected\r\n  with his application or examination, or who has been guilty of a crime\r\n  or of infamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct.\r\n\r\n  3. If an appointing or nominating officer to whom certification has been\r\n  made shall object in writing to any eligible named in the certificate,\r\n  stating that because of physical incapacity or for other good cause\r\n  particularly specified such eligible is not capable of properly\r\n  performing the duties of the vacant place, the Commission may, upon\r\n  investigation and ascertainment of the fact that the objection made is\r\n  good and well founded, direct the certification of another eligible in\r\n  place of the one to whom objection has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL RULE V.\r\n\r\n  Executive officers shall in all proper ways facilitate civil-service\r\n  examinations; and customs officers, postmasters, and custodians of\r\n  public buildings at places where such examinations are to be held shall\r\n  for the purposes of such examinations permit and arrange for the use of\r\n  suitable rooms under their charge, and for heating, lighting, and\r\n  furnishing the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL RULE VI.\r\n\r\n  No person dismissed for misconduct, and no probationer who has failed\r\n  to receive absolute appointment or employment, shall be admitted to any\r\n  examination within one year after having been thus discharged from the\r\n  service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL RULE VII.\r\n\r\n  1.

The Commission shall make regulations that\r\n  will secure to each of such preference-claiming eligibles, in the order\r\n  of his grade among other preference claimants, an opportunity to have\r\n  his claim of preference considered and determined by the appointing\r\n  officer.\r\n\r\n  2. Certifications hereunder shall be made in such manner as to maintain\r\n  as nearly as possible the apportionment of appointments among the\r\n  several States and the Territories and the District of Columbia, as\r\n  required by law.\r\n\r\n  3. If the three names certified are those of persons eligible on the\r\n  copyist or the clerk register, the appointing officer shall select one,\r\n  and one only, and shall notify the person whose name has been selected\r\n  that he has been designated for appointment: _Provided_ That, for\r\n  the purpose of maintaining the apportionment of appointments referred to\r\n  in clause 2 of this rule, the Commission may authorize the appointing\r\n  officer to select more than one of the three names certified.\r\n\r\n  When certification is made from a supplementary or a special register,\r\n  and there are more vacancies than one to be filled, the appointing\r\n  officer may select from the three names certified more than one.\r\n\r\n  4. The Commission may certify from the clerk register for appointment to\r\n  a place the salary of which is less than $1,000 per annum any eligible\r\n  on said register who has given written notice that he will accept such a\r\n  place.\r\n\r\n  5. When a person designated for appointment shall have reported in\r\n  person to the appointing officer, he shall be appointed for a\r\n  probational period of six months, at the end of which period, if his\r\n  conduct and capacity be satisfactory to the appointing officer, he shall\r\n  receive absolute appointment; but if his conduct and capacity be not\r\n  satisfactory to said officer he shall be notified that he will not\r\n  receive absolute appointment, and this notification shall discharge him\r\n  from the service. The appointing officer shall require the heads of\r\n  bureaus or divisions under whom probationers are serving to keep a\r\n  record and to make report of the punctuality, industry, habits, ability,\r\n  and aptitude of each probationer.\r\n\r\n  6. All persons appointed to or promoted in the classified departmental\r\n  service shall be assigned to the duties of the class or place to which\r\n  they have been appointed or promoted, unless the interests of the\r\n  service require their assignment to other duties; and when such\r\n  assignment is made the fact shall be reported to the head of the\r\n  Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENTAL RULE VIII.\r\n\r\n  1.

The Commission shall make\r\n  regulations that will secure to each of such preference-claiming\r\n  eligibles, in the order of his grade among other preference claimants,\r\n  an opportunity to have his claim of preference considered and determined\r\n  by the appointing officer.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Each name on a register of eligibles may be certified only\r\n  three times: _Provided_, That when a name has been three times\r\n  certified, if there are not three names on the register of higher grade,\r\n  it may, upon the written request of a nominating officer to whom it has\r\n  not been certified, be included in any certification made to said\r\n  officer.\r\n\r\n  2. Of the three names certified the nominating officer must select one;\r\n  and if at the time of making this selection there are more vacancies\r\n  than one, he may select more than one name. Each person thus designated\r\n  for appointment shall be notified, and upon reporting in person to the\r\n  proper officer shall be appointed for a probational period of six\r\n  months, at the end of which period, if his conduct and capacity be\r\n  satisfactory to the nominating officer, he shall receive absolute\r\n  appointment; but if his conduct and capacity be not satisfactory to said\r\n  officer, he shall be notified that he will not receive absolute\r\n  appointment, and this notification shall discharge him from the service.\r\n\r\n  3. Every nominating officer in the classified customs service shall\r\n  require the officer under whom a probationer may be serving to carefully\r\n  observe and report in writing the services rendered by and the character\r\n  and qualifications of such probationer. These reports shall be preserved\r\n  on file, and the Commission may prescribe the form and manner in which\r\n  they shall be made.\r\n\r\n  4.

It provides for the promotion of an\r\nemployee in a Department who is below or outside of the classified\r\nservice to a place within said classified service in the same Department\r\nupon the request of the appointing officer, upon the recommendation of\r\nthe Commission and the approval of the President, after a noncompetitive\r\nexamination, in case such person has served continuously for two years\r\nin the place from which it is proposed to promote him, and \"because of\r\nhis faithfulness and efficiency in the position occupied by him,\" and\r\n\"because of his qualifications for the place to which the appointing\r\nofficer desires his promotion.\"\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to me that this provision must be executed with caution\r\nto avoid the application of it to cases not intended and the undue\r\nrelaxation of the general purposes and restrictions of the civil-service\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nNoncompetitive examinations are the exceptions to the plan of the act,\r\nand the rules permitting the same should be strictly construed. The\r\ncases arising under the exception above recited should be very few, and\r\nwhen presented they should precisely meet all the requirements\r\nspecified, and should be supported by facts which will develop the basis\r\nand reason of the application of the appointing officer and which will\r\ncommend them to the judgment of the Commission and the President. The\r\nsole purpose of the provision is to benefit the public service, and it\r\nshould never be permitted to operate as an evasion of the main feature\r\nof the law, which is competitive examinations.\r\n\r\nAs these cases will first be presented to the Commission for\r\nrecommendation, I have to request that you will formulate a plan by\r\nwhich their merits can be tested. This will naturally involve a\r\nstatement of all the facts deemed necessary for the determination of\r\nsuch applications, including the kind of work which has been done by the\r\nperson proposed for promotion and the considerations upon which the\r\nallegations of the faithfulness, efficiency, and qualifications\r\nmentioned in the rule are predicated.\r\n\r\nWhat has already been written naturally suggests another very important\r\nsubject, to which I will invite your attention.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of the rule which I have commented upon would be\r\nnearly, if not entirely, removed, and other difficulties which now\r\nembarrass the execution of the civil-service law would be obviated, if\r\nthere was a better and uniform classification of the employees in the\r\ndifferent Departments. The importance of this is entirely obvious. The\r\npresent imperfect classifications, hastily made, apparently with but\r\nlittle care for uniformity, and promulgated after the last Presidential\r\nelection and prior to the installation of the present Administration,\r\nshould not have been permitted to continue to this time.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the War Department the employees were divided on the\r\n19th day of November, 1884, into eight classes and subclasses, embracing\r\nthose earning annual salaries from $900 to $2,000.\r\n\r\nThe Navy Department was classified November 22, 1884, and its employees\r\nwere divided into seven classes and subclasses, embracing those who\r\nreceived annual salaries from $720 to $1,800.\r\n\r\nIn the Interior Department the classification was made on the 6th day of\r\nDecember, 1884. It consists of eight classes and subclasses, and\r\nembraces employees receiving annual salaries from $720 to $2,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d day of January, 1885, a classification of the employees in the\r\nTreasury Department was made, consisting of six classes and subclasses,\r\nincluding those earning annual salaries from $900 to $1,800.\r\n\r\nIn the Post-Office Department the employees were classified on February\r\n6, 1885, into nine classes and subclasses, embracing persons earning\r\nannual salaries from $720 to $2,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, 1884, the Bureau of Agriculture was classified\r\nin a manner different from all the other Departments, and presenting\r\nfeatures peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the only classification in the Department of State and the\r\nDepartment of Justice is that provided for by section 163 of the Revised\r\nStatutes, which directs that the employees in the several Departments\r\nshall be divided into four classes. It appears that no more definite\r\nclassification has been made in these Departments.\r\n\r\nI wish the Commission would revise these classifications and submit to\r\nme a plan which will as far as possible make them uniform, and which\r\nwill especially remedy the present condition which permits persons to\r\nenter a grade in the service in the one Department without any\r\nexamination which in another Department can only be entered after\r\npassing such examination. This, I think, should be done by extending the\r\nlimits of the classified service rather than by contracting them.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 23, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the People of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe painful duty devolves upon the President to announce the death, at\r\nan early hour this morning, at his residence in this city, of Morrison\r\nR. Waite, Chief Justice of the United States, which exalted office he\r\nhad filled since March 4, 1874, with honor to himself and high\r\nusefulness to his country.\r\n\r\nIn testimony of respect to the memory of the honored dead it is ordered\r\nthat the executive offices in Washington be closed on the day of the\r\nfuneral and be draped in mourning for thirty days, and that the national\r\nflag be displayed at half-mast on the public buildings and on all\r\nnational vessels on the day of the funeral.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n\r\nT.F.

One of these places is now vacant, and it is\r\n  important that it should be filled at the earliest practicable date. The\r\n  position is not one excepted from examination by Customs Rule II, clause\r\n  5; but the collector thinks that it would be imprudent and impracticable\r\n  for him to be restricted in filling the vacancy to the three names that\r\n  might be certified to him from the eligible register, and in this\r\n  opinion the Commission concurs. But whether this class of positions and\r\n  certain others in the customs service should be filled by noncompetitive\r\n  examination or by special exception is a matter which the Commission has\r\n  under consideration, but can not determine until after a visit to New\r\n  York and perhaps other ports. In view, however, of the necessity for\r\n  immediately filling the present vacancy--but without establishing a\r\n  precedent--the Commission has the honor to recommend that a\r\n  noncompetitive examination for the purpose be authorized under\r\n  subdivision (_e_), clause 2 of General Rule III, Civil-Service\r\n  Rules.

Harmony, Acting Secretary of the Navy,\r\n  refers, with a request that the examination asked for therein be held at\r\n  the earliest possible moment, a communication of the same date of G.S.\r\n  Dyer, lieutenant, United States Navy, in charge of the Hydrographic\r\n  Office, Navy Department, requesting that Francis A. Lewis, at New York\r\n  City, and Joseph T. McMillan, of San Francisco, may be noncompetitively\r\n  examined for the positions of assistants at the branch hydrographic\r\n  offices at those places, respectively, under General Rule III, paragraph\r\n  2 (_e_), stating that the positions of assistants at those offices\r\n  require men specially fitted by a technical nautical education, and\r\n  therefore such as is only obtained in the Navy, and that the young men\r\n  referred to are recent graduates of the Naval Academy and have been\r\n  honorably discharged from the service.\r\n\r\n  \"The positions named in this communication, and similar positions at\r\n  other branch hydrographic offices, being regarded as in the classified\r\n  departmental service in the Department of the Navy, and subject to\r\n  examination, and in view of the qualifications required in such\r\n  positions and of the fact that the service is to be rendered at points\r\n  remote from the city of Washington, it is deemed impracticable to fill\r\n  these places by competitive examination. It is therefore ordered that\r\n  they be included among the places to be filled by noncompetitive\r\n  examination under the provision of General Rule III, clause 2\r\n  (_e_), and that the President be asked to approve this order.\"\r\n\r\n  The Commission respectfully requests that you indorse this communication\r\n  with your approval of the action above quoted and return it as the\r\n  authority of the Commission for including the places mentioned among the\r\n  noncompetitive examination places under General Rule III, clause 2\r\n  (_e_).\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n  A.P.

The duties of these positions can not be learned elsewhere than\r\nin the positions themselves, and therefore the only experts are those\r\nnow occupying them and the very few who have left them for one cause or\r\nanother, but who are not seeking to return. Therefore, since experts are\r\nnot available, and persons will have to be appointed who must learn the\r\nduties of the positions in the actual performance of those duties, there\r\nwould seem to be no good reason why such persons should not be selected\r\nfrom the eligible registers of this Commission, which are at all times\r\nabundantly supplied with the names of persons who are both competent and\r\nworthy. And besides, so long as these tempting places are in the\r\nnoncompetitive list, the Department will be subjected to solicitation\r\nand pressure concerning them which it would rather avoid.\r\n\r\nIn view of these considerations it is respectfully recommended that you\r\napprove the revocation of so much of the order above referred to as\r\nprovides for the appointment upon noncompetitive examination of\r\nseventeen clerks in the office of the Treasurer of the United States\r\nemployed as expert money tellers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nCHAS. LYMAN,\r\n  _Commissioner in Charge_.\r\n\r\nApproved, November 13, 1888.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAs you assemble for the discharge of the duties you have assumed as the\r\nrepresentatives of a free and generous people, your meeting is marked\r\nby an interesting and impressive incident. With the expiration of the\r\npresent session of the Congress the first century of our constitutional\r\nexistence as a nation will be completed.\r\n\r\nOur survival for one hundred years is not sufficient to assure us that\r\nwe no longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance, with all its\r\npromised blessings, of a government founded upon the freedom of the\r\npeople. The time rather admonishes us to soberly inquire whether in the\r\npast we have always closely kept in the course of safety, and whether we\r\nhave before us a way plain and clear which leads to happiness and\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment of our Government was undertaken, the chart adopted\r\nfor our guidance was the Constitution. Departure from the lines there\r\nlaid down is failure. It is only by a strict adherence to the direction\r\nthey indicate and by restraint within the limitations they fix that we\r\ncan furnish proof to the world of the fitness of the American people for\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nThe equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlying\r\nprinciple of our institutions should not be confined to the relations of\r\nour citizens to each other. The Government itself is under bond to the\r\nAmerican people that in the exercise of its functions and powers it will\r\ndeal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously honest and\r\nfair and absolutely just. It has agreed that American citizenship shall\r\nbe the only credential necessary to justify the claim of equality before\r\nthe law, and that no condition in life shall give rise to discrimination\r\nin the treatment of the people by their Government.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of our Republic in its early days rigidly insisted upon full\r\ncompliance with the letter of this bond, and saw stretching out before\r\nhim a clear field for individual endeavor. His tribute to the support of\r\nhis Government was measured by the cost of its economical maintenance,\r\nand he was secure in the enjoyment of the remaining recompense of his\r\nsteady and contented toil. In those days the frugality of the people was\r\nstamped upon their Government, and was enforced by the free, thoughtful,\r\nand intelligent suffrage of the citizen. Combinations, monopolies, and\r\naggregations of capital were either avoided or sternly regulated and\r\nrestrained. The pomp and glitter of governments less free offered no\r\ntemptation and presented no delusion to the plain people who, side by\r\nside, in friendly competition, wrought for the ennoblement and dignity\r\nof man, for the solution of the problem of free government, and for the\r\nachievement of the grand destiny awaiting the land which God had given\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA century has passed. Our cities are the abiding places of wealth and\r\nluxury; our manufactories yield fortunes never dreamed of by the fathers\r\nof the Republic; our business men are madly striving in the race for\r\nriches, and immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination in\r\nthe magnitude of their undertakings.\r\n\r\nWe view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country's\r\ngrowth and prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny develops a somber\r\nshading. Upon more careful inspection we find the wealth and luxury of\r\nour cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unremunerative\r\ntoil. A crowded and constantly increasing urban population suggests the\r\nimpoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural\r\npursuits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's simple and\r\nlaborious life, joins the eager chase for easily acquired wealth.\r\n\r\nWe discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no\r\nlonger solely the reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight,\r\nbut that they result from the discriminating favor of the Government and\r\nare largely built upon undue exactions from the masses of our people.\r\nThe gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening, and\r\nclasses are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful,\r\nwhile in another are found the toiling poor.\r\n\r\nAs we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the\r\nexistence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is\r\nstruggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.\r\nCorporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the\r\nlaw and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nStill congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our\r\ncountry and complacently contemplating every incident of change\r\ninseparable from these conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citizens\r\nto inquire at the present stage of our progress how the bond of the\r\nGovernment made with the people has been kept and performed.\r\n\r\nInstead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the\r\nnecessities of its economical administration, the Government persists in\r\nexacting from the substance of the people millions which, unapplied and\r\nuseless, lie dormant in its Treasury. This flagrant injustice and this\r\nbreach of faith and obligation add to extortion the danger attending the\r\ndiversion of the currency of the country from the legitimate channels of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nUnder the same laws by which these results are produced the Government\r\npermits many millions more to be added to the cost of the living of our\r\npeople and to be taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the\r\nprofits of a small but powerful minority.\r\n\r\nThe people must still be taxed for the support of the Government under\r\nthe operation of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of out\r\ncitizens are inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose and\r\nfor the benefit of a favored few, the Government, under pretext of an\r\nexercise of its taxing power, enters gratuitously into partnership with\r\nthese favorites, to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nThis is not equality before the law.\r\n\r\nThe existing situation is injurious to the health of our entire body\r\npolitic. It stifles in those for whose benefit it is permitted all\r\npatriotic love of country, and substitutes in its place selfish greed\r\nand grasping avarice. Devotion to American citizenship for its own sake\r\nand for what it should accomplish as a motive to our nation's\r\nadvancement and the happiness of all our people is displaced by the\r\nassumption that the Government, instead of being the embodiment of\r\nequality, is but an instrumentality through which especial and\r\nindividual advantages are to be gained.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of this assumption is unconcealed. It appears in the\r\nsordid disregard of all but personal interests, in the refusal to abate\r\nfor the benefit of others one iota of selfish advantage, and in\r\ncombinations to perpetuate such advantages through efforts to control\r\nlegislation and improperly influence the suffrages of the people.\r\n\r\nThe grievances of those not included within the circle of these\r\nbeneficiaries, when fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and\r\ndiscontent. Our farmers, long suffering and patient, struggling in the\r\nrace of life with the hardest and most unremitting toil, will not fail\r\nto see, in spite of misrepresentations and misleading fallacies, that\r\nthey are obliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed\r\nin foreign markets where they compete with the farmers of the world;\r\nthat their lands are declining in value while their debts increase, and\r\nthat without compensating favor they are forced by the action of the\r\nGovernment to pay for the benefit of others such enhanced prices for the\r\nthings they need that the scanty returns of their labor fail to furnish\r\ntheir support or leave no margin for accumulation.\r\n\r\nOur workingmen, enfranchised from all delusions and no longer frightened\r\nby the cry that their wages are endangered by a just revision of our\r\ntariff laws, will reasonably demand through such revision steadier\r\nemployment, cheaper means of living in their homes, freedom for\r\nthemselves and their children from the doom of perpetual servitude, and\r\nan open door to their advancement beyond the limits of a laboring class.\r\nOthers of our citizens, whose comforts and expenditures are measured by\r\nmoderate salaries and fixed incomes, will insist upon the fairness and\r\njustice of cheapening the cost of necessaries for themselves and their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nWhen to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination\r\nunder our laws there shall be added the discontent of those who suffer\r\nfrom such discrimination, we will realize the fact that the beneficent\r\npurposes of our Government, dependent upon the patriotism and\r\ncontentment of our people, are endangered.\r\n\r\nCommunism is a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized\r\ngovernment; but the communism of combined wealth and capital, the\r\noutgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously\r\nundermines the justice and integrity of free institutions, is not less\r\ndangerous than the communism of oppressed poverty and toil, which,\r\nexasperated by injustice and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the\r\ncitadel of rule.\r\n\r\nHe mocks the people who proposes that the Government shall protect the\r\nrich and that they in turn will care for the laboring poor. Any\r\nintermediary between the people and their Government or the least\r\ndelegation of the care and protection the Government owes to the\r\nhumblest citizen in the land makes the boast of free institutions a\r\nglittering delusion and the pretended boon of American citizenship a\r\nshameless imposition.\r\n\r\nA just and sensible revision of our tariff laws should be made for the\r\nrelief of those of our countrymen who suffer under present conditions.\r\nSuch a revision should receive the support of all who love that justice\r\nand equality due to American citizenship; of all who realize that in\r\nthis justice and equality our Government finds its strength and its\r\npower to protect the citizen and his property; of all who believe that\r\nthe contented competence and comfort of many accord better with the\r\nspirit of our institutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered in\r\nthe hands of a few; of all who appreciate that the forbearance and\r\nfraternity among our people, which recognize the value of every American\r\ninterest, are the surest guaranty of our national progress, and of all\r\nwho desire to see the products of American skill and ingenuity in every\r\nmarket of the world, with a resulting restoration of American commerce.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the reduction of our revenues is so apparent as\r\nto be generally conceded, but the means by which this end shall be\r\naccomplished and the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our\r\ncitizens present a controversy of the utmost importance. There should be\r\nno scheme accepted as satisfactory by which the burdens of the people\r\nare only apparently removed. Extravagant appropriations of public money,\r\nwith all their demoralizing consequences, should not be tolerated,\r\neither as a means of relieving the Treasury of its present surplus or as\r\nfurnishing pretext for resisting a proper reduction in tariff rates.\r\nExisting evils and injustice should be honestly recognized, boldly met,\r\nand effectively remedied. There should be no cessation of the struggle\r\nuntil a plan is perfected, fair and conservative toward existing\r\nindustries, but which will reduce the cost to consumers of the\r\nnecessaries of life, while it provides for our manufacturers the\r\nadvantage of freer raw materials and permits no injury to the interests\r\nof American labor.\r\n\r\nThe cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines\r\nclearly and distinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It is\r\nthe people's cause.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied-that the selfish and private interests which\r\nare so persistently heard when efforts are made to deal in a just and\r\ncomprehensive manner with our tariff laws are related to, if they are\r\nnot responsible for, the sentiment largely prevailing among the people\r\nthat the General Government is the fountain of individual and private\r\naid; that it may be expected to relieve with paternal care the distress\r\nof citizens and communities, and that from the fullness of its Treasury\r\nit should, upon the slightest possible pretext of promoting the general\r\ngood, apply public funds to the benefit of localities and individuals.\r\nNor can it be denied that there is a growing assumption that, as against\r\nthe Government and in favor of private claims and interests, the usual\r\nrules and limitations of business principles and just dealing should be\r\nwaived.\r\n\r\nThese ideas have been unhappily much encouraged by legislative\r\nacquiescence. Relief from contracts made with the Government is too\r\neasily accorded in favor of the citizen; the failure to support claims\r\nagainst the Government by proof is often supplied by no better\r\nconsideration than the wealth of the Government and the poverty of the\r\nclaimant; gratuities in the form of pensions are granted upon no other\r\nreal ground than the needy condition of the applicant, or for reasons\r\nless valid; and large sums are expended for public buildings and other\r\nimprovements upon representations scarcely claimed to be related to\r\npublic needs and necessities.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the consideration of such matters subordinate and\r\npostpone action upon subjects of great public importance, but involving\r\nno special private or partisan interest, should arrest attention and\r\nlead to reformation.\r\n\r\nA few of the numerous illustrations of this condition may be stated.\r\n\r\nThe crowded condition of the calendar of the Supreme Court, and the\r\ndelay to suitors and denial of justice resulting therefrom, has been\r\nstrongly urged upon the attention of the Congress, with a plan for the\r\nrelief of the situation approved by those well able to judge of its\r\nmerits. While this subject remains without effective consideration, many\r\nlaws have been passed providing for the holding of terms of inferior\r\ncourts at places to suit the convenience of localities, or to lay the\r\nfoundation of an application for the erection of a new public building.\r\n\r\nRepeated recommendations have been submitted for the amendment and\r\nchange of the laws relating to our public lands so that their spoliation\r\nand diversion to other uses than as homes for honest settlers might be\r\nprevented. While a measure to meet this conceded necessity of reform\r\nremains awaiting the action of the Congress, many claims to the public\r\nlands and applications for their donation, in favor of States and\r\nindividuals, have been allowed.\r\n\r\nA plan in aid of Indian management, recommended by those well informed\r\nas containing valuable features in furtherance of the solution of the\r\nIndian problem, has thus far failed of legislative sanction, while\r\ngrants of doubtful expediency to railroad corporations, permitting them\r\nto pass through Indian reservations, have greatly multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe propriety and necessity of the erection of one or more prisons for\r\nthe confinement of United States convicts, and a post-office building in\r\nthe national capital, are not disputed. But these needs yet remain\r\nunanswered, while scores of public buildings have been erected where\r\ntheir necessity for public purposes is not apparent.\r\n\r\nA revision of our pension laws could easily be made which would rest\r\nupon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant. But while\r\nour general pension laws remain confused and imperfect, hundreds of\r\nprivate pension laws are annually passed, which are the sources of\r\nunjust discrimination and popular demoralization.\r\n\r\nAppropriation bills for the support of the Government are defaced by\r\nitems and provisions to meet private ends, and it is freely asserted by\r\nresponsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for\r\npublic internal improvement would fail to meet with favor unless it\r\ncontained items more for local and private advantage than for public\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThese statements can be much emphasized by an ascertainment of the\r\nproportion of Federal legislation which either bears upon its face its\r\nprivate character or which upon examination develops such a motive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representatives\r\nsuch patriotic action as will advance the welfare of the entire country;\r\nand this expectation can only be answered by the performance of public\r\nduty with unselfish purpose. Our mission among the nations of the earth\r\nand our success in accomplishing the work God has given the American\r\npeople to do require of those intrusted with the making and execution of\r\nour laws perfect devotion, above all other things, to the public good.\r\n\r\nThis devotion will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of\r\nconstitutional limitations of Federal power and to persistently check\r\nthe increasing tendency to extend the scope of Federal legislation into\r\nthe domain of State and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserving\r\nthe public welfare. The preservation of the partitions between proper\r\nsubjects of Federal and local care and regulation is of such importance\r\nunder the Constitution, which is the law of our very existence, that no\r\nconsideration of expediency or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon\r\ndoubtful ground. We have undertaken to discover and proclaim the richest\r\nblessings of a free government, with the Constitution as our guide. Let\r\nus follow the way it points out; it will not mislead us. And surely no\r\none who has taken upon himself the solemn obligation to support and\r\npreserve the Constitution can find justification or solace for\r\ndisloyalty in the excuse that he wandered and disobeyed in search of a\r\nbetter way to reach the public welfare than the Constitution offers.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said is deemed not inappropriate at a time when, from a\r\ncentury's height, we view the way already trod by the American people\r\nand attempt to discover their future path.\r\n\r\nThe seventh President of the United States--the soldier and statesman\r\nand at all times the firm and brave friend of the people--in vindication\r\nof his course as the protector of popular rights and the champion of\r\ntrue American citizenship, declared:\r\n\r\n  The ambition which leads me on is an anxious desire and a fixed\r\n  determination to restore to the people unimpaired the sacred trust they\r\n  have confided to my charge; to heal the wounds of the Constitution and\r\n  to preserve it from further violation; to persuade my countrymen, so far\r\n  as I may, that it is not in a splendid government supported by powerful\r\n  monopolies and aristocratical establishments that they will find\r\n  happiness or their liberties protection, but in a plain system, void of\r\n  pomp, protecting all and granting favors to none, dispensing its\r\n  blessings like the dews of heaven, unseen and unfelt save in the\r\n  freshness and beauty they contribute to produce. It is such a government\r\n  that the genius of our people requires--such an one only under which our\r\n  States may remain for ages to come united, prosperous, and free.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a constitutional provision requiring the President from\r\ntime to time to give to the Congress information of the state of the\r\nUnion, I have the satisfaction to announce that the close of the year\r\nfinds the United States in the enjoyment of domestic tranquillity and at\r\npeace with all the nations.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message our foreign relations have been\r\nstrengthened and improved by performance of international good offices\r\nand by new and renewed treaties of amity, commerce, and reciprocal\r\nextradition of criminals.\r\n\r\nThose international questions which still await settlement are all\r\nreasonably within the domain of amicable negotiation, and there is no\r\nexisting subject of dispute between the United States and any foreign\r\npower that is not susceptible of satisfactory adjustment by frank\r\ndiplomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nThe questions between Great Britain and the United States relating to\r\nthe rights of American fishermen, under treaty and international comity,\r\nin the territorial waters of Canada and Newfoundland, I regret to say,\r\nare not yet satisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\nThese matters were fully treated in my message to the Senate of February\r\n20, 1888,[19] together with which a convention, concluded under my\r\nauthority with Her Majesty's Government on the 15th of February last,\r\nfor the removal of all causes of misunderstanding, was submitted by me\r\nfor the approval of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThis treaty having been rejected by the Senate, I transmitted a message\r\nto the Congress on the 23d of August last[20] reviewing the transactions\r\nand submitting for consideration certain recommendations for legislation\r\nconcerning the important questions involved.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, on the 12th of September,[21] in response to a resolution\r\nof the Senate, I again communicated fully all the information in my\r\npossession as to the action of the government of Canada affecting the\r\ncommercial relations between the Dominion and the United States,\r\nincluding the treatment of American fishing vessels in the ports and\r\nwaters of British North America.\r\n\r\nThese communications have all been published, and therefore opened to\r\nthe knowledge of both Houses of Congress, although two were addressed to\r\nthe Senate alone.\r\n\r\nComment upon or repetition of their contents would be superfluous, and I\r\nam not aware that anything has since occurred which should be added to\r\nthe facts therein stated. Therefore I merely repeat, as applicable to\r\nthe present time, the statement which will be found in my message to the\r\nSenate of September 12 last, that--\r\n\r\n  Since March 3, 1887, no case has been reported to the Department of\r\n  State wherein complaint was made of unfriendly or unlawful treatment of\r\n  American fishing vessels on the part of the Canadian authorities in\r\n  which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by the\r\n  United States consul-general at Halifax.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving essayed in the discharge of my duty to procure by negotiation the\r\nsettlement of a long-standing cause of dispute and to remove a constant\r\nmenace to the good relations of the two countries, and continuing to be\r\nof opinion that the treaty of February last, which failed to receive the\r\napproval of the Senate, did supply \"a satisfactory, practical, and final\r\nadjustment, upon a basis honorable and just to both parties, of the\r\ndifficult and vexed question to which it related,\" and having\r\nsubsequently and unavailingly recommended other legislation to Congress\r\nwhich I hoped would suffice to meet the exigency created by the\r\nrejection of the treaty, I now again invoke the earnest and immediate\r\nattention of the Congress to the condition of this important question as\r\nit now stands before them and the country, and for the settlement of\r\nwhich I am deeply solicitous.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the month of October last occurrences of a deeply\r\nregrettable nature were brought to my knowledge, which made it my\r\npainful but imperative duty to obtain with as little delay as possible a\r\nnew personal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in relation to this incident will in due course be\r\nlaid before you, and will disclose the unpardonable conduct of the\r\nofficial referred to in his interference by advice and counsel with the\r\nsuffrages of American citizens in the very crisis of the Presidential\r\nelection then near at hand, and also in his subsequent public\r\ndeclarations to justify his action, superadding impugnment of the\r\nExecutive and Senate of the United States in connection with important\r\nquestions now pending in controversy between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nThe offense thus committed was most grave, involving disastrous\r\npossibilities to the good relations of the United States and Great\r\nBritain, constituting a gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an\r\ninvasion of the purely domestic affairs and essential sovereignty of the\r\nGovernment to which the envoy was accredited.\r\n\r\nHaving first fulfilled the just demands of international comity by\r\naffording full opportunity for Her Majesty's Government to act in relief\r\nof the situation, I considered prolongation of discussion to be\r\nunwarranted, and thereupon declined to further recognize the diplomatic\r\ncharacter of the person whose continuance in such function would destroy\r\nthat mutual confidence which is essential to the good understanding of\r\nthe two Governments and was inconsistent with the welfare and\r\nself-respect of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe usual interchange of communication has since continued through Her\r\nMajesty's legation in this city.\r\n\r\nMy endeavors to establish by international cooperation measures for the\r\nprevention of the extermination of fur seals in Bering Sea have not\r\nbeen relaxed, and I have hopes of being enabled shortly to submit an\r\neffective and satisfactory conventional project with the maritime powers\r\nfor the approval of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe coastal boundary between our Alaskan possessions and British\r\nColumbia, I regret to say, has not received the attention demanded by\r\nits importance, and which on several occasions heretofore I have had the\r\nhonor to recommend to the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe admitted impracticability, if not impossibility, of making an\r\naccurate and precise survey and demarcation of the boundary line as it\r\nis recited in the treaty with Russia under which Alaska was ceded to the\r\nUnited States renders it absolutely requisite for the prevention of\r\ninternational jurisdictional complications that adequate appropriation\r\nfor a reconnoissance and survey to obtain proper knowledge of the\r\nlocality and the geographical features of the boundary should be\r\nauthorized by Congress with as little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nKnowledge to be only thus obtained is an essential prerequisite for\r\nnegotiation for ascertaining a common boundary, or as preliminary to any\r\nother mode of settlement.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be desired that some agreement should be reached with Her\r\nMajesty's Government by which the damages to life and property on the\r\nGreat Lakes may be alleviated by removing or humanely regulating the\r\nobstacles to reciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded vessels.\r\n\r\nThe act of June 19, 1878, which offers to Canadian vessels free access\r\nto our inland waters in aid of wrecked or disabled vessels, has not yet\r\nbecome effective through concurrent action by Canada.\r\n\r\nThe due protection of our citizens of French origin or descent from\r\nclaim of military service in the event of their returning to or visiting\r\nFrance has called forth correspondence which was laid before you at the\r\nlast session.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of conventional agreement as to naturalization, which is\r\ngreatly to be desired, this Government sees no occasion to recede from\r\nthe sound position it has maintained not only with regard to France, but\r\nas to all countries with which the United States have not concluded\r\nspecial treaties.\r\n\r\nTwice within the last year has the imperial household of Germany been\r\nvisited by death; and I have hastened to express the sorrow of this\r\npeople, and their appreciation of the lofty character of the late aged\r\nEmperor William, and their sympathy with the heroism under suffering of\r\nhis son the late Emperor Frederick.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation of two years ago for the passage of a bill for\r\nthe refunding to certain German steamship lines of the interest upon\r\ntonnage dues illegally exacted.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th [2d] of April last[22] I laid before the House of\r\nRepresentatives full information respecting our interests in Samoa; and\r\nin the subsequent correspondence on the same subject, which will be laid\r\nbefore you in due course, the history of events in those islands will be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIn a message accompanying my approval, on the 1st day of October last,\r\nof a bill for the exclusion of Chinese laborers, I laid before Congress\r\nfull information and all correspondence touching the negotiation of the\r\ntreaty with China concluded at this capital on the 12th day of March,\r\n1888, and which, having been confirmed by the Senate with certain\r\namendments, was rejected by the Chinese Government. This message\r\ncontained a recommendation that a sum of money be appropriated as\r\ncompensation to Chinese subjects who had suffered injuries at the hands\r\nof lawless men within our jurisdiction. Such appropriation having been\r\nduly made, the fund awaits reception by the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nIt is sincerely hoped that by the cessation of the influx of this class\r\nof Chinese subjects, in accordance with the expressed wish of both\r\nGovernments, a cause of unkind feeling has been permanently removed.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, 1887, notification was given by the Japanese\r\nminister at this capital of the adjournment of the conference for the\r\nrevision of the treaties of Japan with foreign powers, owing to the\r\nobjection of his Government to the provision in the draft jurisdictional\r\nconvention which required the submission of the criminal code of the\r\nEmpire to the powers in advance of its becoming operative. This\r\nnotification was, however, accompanied with an assurance of Japan's\r\nintention to continue the work of revision.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this temporary interruption of negotiations, it is hoped\r\nthat improvements may soon be secured in the jurisdictional system as\r\nrespects foreigners in Japan, and relief afforded to that country from\r\nthe present undue and oppressive foreign control in matters of commerce.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that relief be provided for the injuries\r\naccidentally caused to Japanese subjects in the island Ikisima by the\r\ntarget practice of one of our vessels.\r\n\r\nA diplomatic mission from Korea has been received, and the formal\r\nintercourse between the two countries contemplated by the treaty of 1882\r\nis now established.\r\n\r\nLegislative provision is hereby recommended to organize and equip\r\nconsular courts in Korea.\r\n\r\nPersia has established diplomatic representation at this capital, and\r\nhas evinced very great interest in the enterprise and achievements of\r\nour citizens. I am therefore hopeful that beneficial commercial\r\nrelations between the two countries may be brought about.\r\n\r\nI announce with sincere regret that Hayti has again become the theater\r\nof insurrection, disorder, and bloodshed. The titular government of\r\nPresident Saloman has been forcibly overthrown and he driven out of the\r\ncountry to France, where he has since died.\r\n\r\nThe tenure of power has been so unstable amid the war of factions that\r\nhas ensued since the expulsion of President Saloman that no government\r\nconstituted by the will of the Haytian people has been recognized as\r\nadministering responsibly the affairs of that country. Our\r\nrepresentative has been instructed to abstain from interference between\r\nthe warring factions, and a vessel of our Navy has been sent to Haytian\r\nwaters to sustain our minister and for the protection of the persons and\r\nproperty of American citizens.\r\n\r\nDue precautions have been taken to enforce our neutrality laws and\r\nprevent our territory from becoming the base of military supplies for\r\neither of the warring factions.\r\n\r\nUnder color of a blockade, of which no reasonable notice had been given,\r\nand which does not appear to have been efficiently maintained, a seizure\r\nof vessels under the American flag has been reported, and in consequence\r\nmeasures to prevent and redress any molestation of our innocent\r\nmerchantmen have been adopted.\r\n\r\nProclamation was duly made on the 9th day of November, 1887, of the\r\nconventional extensions of the treaty of June 3, 1875, with Hawaii,\r\nunder which relations of such special and beneficent intercourse have\r\nbeen created.\r\n\r\nIn the vast field of Oriental commerce now unfolded from our Pacific\r\nborders no feature presents stronger recommendations for Congressional\r\naction than the establishment of communication by submarine telegraph\r\nwith Honolulu.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the Hawaiian group in relation to our\r\nPacific States creates a natural interdependency and mutuality of\r\ninterest which our present treaties were intended to foster, and which\r\nmake close communication a logical and commercial necessity.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of concluding a treaty of commercial reciprocity with Mexico\r\nhas been heretofore stated in my messages to Congress, and the lapse of\r\ntime and growth of commerce with that close neighbor and sister Republic\r\nconfirm the judgment so expressed.\r\n\r\nThe precise relocation of our boundary line is needful, and adequate\r\nappropriation is now recommended.\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere satisfaction that I am enabled to advert to the\r\nspirit of good neighborhood and friendly cooperation and conciliation\r\nthat has marked the correspondence and action of the Mexican authorities\r\nin their share of the task of maintaining law and order about the line\r\nof our common boundary.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending boundary dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was\r\nreferred to my arbitration, and by an award made on the 22d of March\r\nlast the question has been finally settled to the expressed satisfaction\r\nof both of the parties in interest.\r\n\r\nThe Empire of Brazil, in abolishing the last vestige of slavery among\r\nChristian nations, called forth the earnest congratulations of this\r\nGovernment in expression of the cordial sympathies of our people.\r\n\r\nThe claims of nearly all other countries against Chile growing out of\r\nher late war with Bolivia and Peru have been disposed of, either by\r\narbitration or by a lump settlement. Similar claims of our citizens will\r\ncontinue to be urged upon the Chilean Government, and it is hoped will\r\nnot be subject to further delays.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive treaty of amity and commerce with Peru was proclaimed on\r\nNovember 7 last, and it is expected that under its operation mutual\r\nprosperity and good understanding will be promoted.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the policy of arbitration, a treaty to settle the claim\r\nof Santos, an American citizen, against Ecuador has been concluded under\r\nmy authority, and will be duly submitted for the approval of the Senate.\r\n\r\nLike disposition of the claim of Carlos Butterfield against Denmark and\r\nof Van Bokkelen against Hayti will probably be made, and I trust the\r\nprinciple of such settlements may be extended in practice under the\r\napproval of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThrough unforeseen causes, foreign to the will of both Governments, the\r\nratification of the convention of December 5, 1885, with Venezuela, for\r\nthe rehearing of claims of citizens of the United States under the\r\ntreaty of 1866, failed of exchange within the term provided, and a\r\nsupplementary convention, further extending the time for exchange of\r\nratifications and explanatory of an ambiguous provision of the prior\r\nconvention, now awaits the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAlthough this matter, in the stage referred to, concerns only the\r\nconcurrent treaty-making power of one branch of Congress, I advert to it\r\nin view of the interest repeatedly and conspicuously shown by you in\r\nyour legislative capacity in favor of a speedy and equitable adjustment\r\nof the questions growing out of the discredited judgments of the\r\nprevious mixed commission of Caracas. With every desire to do justice to\r\nthe representations of Venezuela in this regard, the time seems to have\r\ncome to end this matter, and I trust the prompt confirmation by both\r\nparties of the supplementary action referred to will avert the need of\r\nlegislative or other action to prevent the longer withholding of such\r\nrights of actual claimants as may be shown to exist.\r\n\r\nAs authorized by the Congress, preliminary steps have been taken for the\r\nassemblage at this capital during the coming year of the representatives\r\nof South and Central American States, together with those of Mexico,\r\nHayti, and San Domingo, to discuss sundry important monetary and\r\ncommercial topics.\r\n\r\nExcepting in those cases where, from reasons of contiguity of territory\r\nand the existence of a common border line incapable of being guarded,\r\nreciprocal commercial treaties may be found expedient, it is believed\r\nthat commercial policies inducing freer mutual exchange of products can\r\nbe most advantageously arranged by independent but cooperative\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nIn the mode last mentioned the control of our taxation for revenue will\r\nbe always retained in our own hands unrestricted by conventional\r\nagreements with other governments.\r\n\r\nIn conformity also with Congressional authority, the maritime powers\r\nhave been invited to confer in Washington in April next upon the\r\npracticability of devising uniform rules and measures for the greater\r\nsecurity of life and property at sea. A disposition to accept on the\r\npart of a number of the powers has already been manifested, and if the\r\ncooperation of the nations chiefly interested shall be secured important\r\nresults may be confidently anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe act of June 26, 1884, and the acts amendatory thereof, in relation\r\nto tonnage duties, have given rise to extended correspondence with\r\nforeign nations with whom we have existing treaties of navigation and\r\ncommerce, and have caused wide and regrettable divergence of opinion in\r\nrelation to the imposition of the duties referred to. These questions\r\nare important, and I shall make them the subject of a special and more\r\ndetailed communication at the present session.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid increase of immigration to our shores and the facilities\r\nof modern travel, abuses of the generous privileges afforded by our\r\nnaturalization laws call for their careful revision.\r\n\r\nThe easy and unguarded manner in which certificates of American\r\ncitizenship can now be obtained has induced a class, unfortunately\r\nlarge, to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolved from\r\nallegiance to their native land, and yet by a foreign residence to\r\nescape any just duty and contribution of service to the country of their\r\nproposed adoption. Thus, while evading the duties of citizenship to the\r\nUnited States, they may make prompt claim for its national protection\r\nand demand its intervention in their behalf. International complications\r\nof a serious nature arise, and the correspondence of the State\r\nDepartment discloses the great number and complexity of the questions\r\nwhich have been raised.\r\n\r\nOur laws regulating the issue of passports should be carefully revised,\r\nand the institution of a central bureau of registration at the capital\r\nis again strongly recommended. By this means full particulars of each\r\ncase of naturalization in the United States would be secured and\r\nproperly indexed and recorded, and thus many cases of spurious\r\ncitizenship would be detected and unjust responsibilities would be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of the consular service is a matter of serious\r\nimportance to our national interests. The number of existing principal\r\nconsular offices is believed to be greater than is at all necessary\r\nfor the conduct of the public business. It need not be our policy\r\nto maintain more than a moderate number of principal offices, each\r\nsupported by a salary sufficient to enable the incumbent to live in\r\ncomfort, and so distributed as to secure the convenient supervision,\r\nthrough subordinate agencies, of affairs over a considerable district.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendations heretofore made by me that the\r\nappropriations for the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular\r\nservice should be recast; that the so-called notarial or unofficial\r\nfees, which our representatives abroad are now permitted to treat as\r\npersonal perquisites, should be forbidden; that a system of consular\r\ninspection should be instituted, and that a limited number of\r\nsecretaries of legation at large should be authorized.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the centennial celebration, on April 30, 1889, of the\r\ninauguration of George Washington as President of the United States, at\r\nthe city of New York, have been made by a voluntary organization of the\r\ncitizens of that locality, and believing that an opportunity should be\r\nafforded for the expression of the interest felt throughout the country\r\nin this event, I respectfully recommend fitting and cooperative action\r\nby Congress on behalf of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury exhibits in detail the\r\ncondition of our national finances and the operations of the several\r\nbranches of the Government related to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe total ordinary revenues of the Government for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, amounted to $379,266,074.76, of which $219,091,173.63 was\r\nreceived from customs duties and $124,296,871.98 from internal-revenue\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts from all sources exceeded those for the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1887, by $7,862,797.10.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures of the Government for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1888, were $259,653,958.67, leaving a surplus of\r\n$119,612,116.09.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in these expenditures as compared with the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1887, was $8,278,221.30, notwithstanding the payment of\r\nmore than $5,000,000 for pensions in excess of what was paid for that\r\npurpose in the latter-mentioned year.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1889,\r\nascertained for the quarter ended September 30, 1888, and estimated for\r\nthe remainder of the time, amount to $377,000,000, and the actual and\r\nestimated ordinary expenditures for the same year are $273,000,000,\r\nleaving an estimated surplus of $104,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts for the year ending June 30, 1890, are\r\n$377,000,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same time\r\nare $275,767,488.34, showing a surplus of $101,232,511.66.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements of surplus do not take into account the sum\r\nnecessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sinking-fund\r\nact, amounting to more than $47,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThe cost of collecting the customs revenues for the last fiscal year was\r\n2.44 per cent; for the year 1885 it was 3.77 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe excess of internal-revenue taxes collected during the last fiscal\r\nyear over those collected for the year ended June 30, 1887, was\r\n$5,489,174.26, and the cost of collecting this revenue decreased from\r\n3.4 per cent in 1887 to less than 3.2 per cent for the last year. The\r\ntax collected on oleomargarine was $723,948.04 for the year ending June\r\n30, 1887, and $864,139.88 for the following year.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the sinking-fund act have been met for the year\r\nended June 30, 1888, and for the current year also, by the purchase of\r\nbonds. After complying with this law as positively required, and bonds\r\nsufficient for that purpose had been bought at a premium, it was not\r\ndeemed prudent to further expend the surplus in such purchases until\r\nthe authority to do so should be more explicit. A resolution, however,\r\nhaving been passed by both Houses of Congress removing all doubt as to\r\nExecutive authority, daily purchases of bonds were commenced on the 23d\r\nday of April, 1888, and have continued until the present time. By this\r\nplan bonds of the Government not yet due have been purchased up to and\r\nincluding the 30th day of November, 1888, amounting to $94,700,400, the\r\npremium paid thereon amounting to $17,508,613.08.\r\n\r\nThe premium added to the principal of these bonds represents an\r\ninvestment yielding about 2 per cent interest for the time they still\r\nhad to run, and the saving to the Government represented by the\r\ndifference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum\r\npaid for principal and premium and what it would have paid for interest\r\nat the rate specified in the bonds if they had run to their maturity is\r\nabout $27,165,000.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this would seem to be a profitable and sensible\r\ntransaction on the part of the Government, but, as suggested by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, the surplus thus expended for the purchase of\r\nbonds was money drawn from the people in excess of any actual need of\r\nthe Government and was so expended rather than allow it to remain idle\r\nin the Treasury. If this surplus, under the operation of just and\r\nequitable laws, had been left in the hands of the people, it would have\r\nbeen worth in their business at least 6 per cent per annum. Deducting\r\nfrom the amount of interest upon the principal and premium of these\r\nbonds for the time they had to run at the rate of 6 per cent the saving\r\nof 2 per cent made for the people by the purchase of such bonds, the\r\nloss will appear to be $55,760,000.\r\n\r\nThis calculation would seem to demonstrate that if excessive and\r\nunnecessary taxation is continued and the Government is forced to pursue\r\nthis policy of purchasing its own bonds at the premiums which it will be\r\nnecessary to pay, the loss to the people will be hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nSince the purchase of bonds was undertaken as mentioned nearly all that\r\nhave been offered were at last accepted. It has been made quite apparent\r\nthat the Government was in danger of being subjected to combinations to\r\nraise their price, as appears by the instance cited by the Secretary of\r\nthe offering of bonds of the par value of only $326,000 so often that\r\nthe aggregate of the sums demanded for their purchase amounted to more\r\nthan $19,700,000.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large sums paid out in the purchase of bonds,\r\nthe surplus in the Treasury on the 30th day of November, 1888, was\r\n$52,234,610.01, after deducting about $20,000,000 just drawn out for\r\nthe payment of pensions.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, there had been\r\ncoined under the compulsory silver-coinage act $266,988,280 in silver\r\ndollars, $55,504,310 of which were in the hands of the people.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1888, there had been coined $299,708,790; and\r\nof this $55,829,303 was in circulation in coin, and $200,387,376 in\r\nsilver certificates, for the redemption of which silver dollars to that\r\namount were held by the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of November, 1888, $312,570,990 had been coined,\r\n$60,970,990 of the silver dollars were actually in circulation, and\r\n$237,418,346 in certificates.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary recommends the suspension of the further coinage of\r\nsilver, and in such recommendation I earnestly concur.\r\n\r\nFor further valuable information and timely recommendations I ask the\r\ncareful attention of the Congress to the Secretary's report.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the Army at the date of the last\r\nconsolidated returns consisted of 2,189 officers and 24,549 enlisted\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, amounted to $41,165,107.07, of which sum $9,158,516.63\r\nwas expended for public works, including river and harbor improvements.\r\n\r\n\"The Board of Ordnance and Fortifications\" provided for under the act\r\napproved September 22 last was convened October 30, 1888, and plans and\r\nspecifications for procuring forgings for 8, 10, and 12 inch guns, under\r\nprovisions of section 4, and also for procuring 12-inch breech-loading\r\nmortars, cast iron, hooped with steel, under the provisions of section 5\r\nof the said act, were submitted to the Secretary of War for reference to\r\nthe board, by the Ordnance Department, on the same date.\r\n\r\nThese plans and specifications having been promptly approved by the\r\nboard and the Secretary of War, the necessary authority to publish\r\nadvertisements inviting proposals in the newspapers throughout the\r\ncountry was granted by the Secretary on November 12, and on November 13\r\nthe advertisements were sent out to the different newspapers designated,\r\nThe bids for the steel forgings are to be opened on December 20, 1888,\r\nand for the mortars on December 15, 1888.\r\n\r\nA board of ordnance officers was convened at the Watervliet Arsenal on\r\nOctober 4, 1888, to prepare the necessary plans and specifications for\r\nthe establishment of an army gun factory at that point. The preliminary\r\nreport of this board, with estimates for shop buildings and officers'\r\nquarters, was approved by the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications\r\nNovember 6 and 8. The specifications and form of advertisement and\r\ninstructions to bidders have been prepared, and advertisements inviting\r\nproposals for the excavations for the shop building and for erecting\r\nthe two sets of officers' quarters have been published. The detailed\r\ndrawings and specifications for the gun-factory building are well in\r\nhand, and will be finished within three or four months, when bids will\r\nbe invited for the erection of the building. The list of machines, etc.,\r\nis made out, and it is expected that the plans for the large lathes,\r\netc., will be completed within about four months, and after approval by\r\nthe Board of Ordnance and Fortifications bids for furnishing the same\r\nwill be invited. The machines and other fixtures will be completed as\r\nsoon as the shop is in readiness to receive them, probably about July,\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Army bill for the procurement of pneumatic\r\ndynamite guns, the necessary specifications are now being prepared, and\r\nadvertisements for proposals will issue early in December. The guns will\r\nprobably be of 15 inches caliber and fire a projectile that will carry a\r\ncharge each of about 500 pounds of explosive gelatine with full-caliber\r\nprojectiles. The guns will probably be delivered in from six to ten\r\nmonths from the date of the contract, so that all the guns of this class\r\nthat can be procured under the provisions of the law will be purchased\r\nduring the year 1889.\r\n\r\nI earnestly request that the recommendations contained in the\r\nSecretary's report, all of which are, in my opinion, calculated to\r\nincrease the usefulness and discipline of the Army, may receive the\r\nconsideration of the Congress. Among these the proposal that there\r\nshould be provided a plan for the examination of officers to test their\r\nfitness for promotion is of the utmost importance. This reform has been\r\nbefore recommended in the reports of the Secretary, and its expediency\r\nis so fully demonstrated by the argument he presents in its favor that\r\nits adoption should no longer be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Sheridan in August last was a national affliction.\r\nThe Army then lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country lost a brave\r\nand experienced soldier, a wise and discreet counselor, and a modest and\r\nsensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range of his\r\npersonal association will never fail to pay deserved and willing homage\r\nto his greatness and the glory of his career, but they will cherish with\r\nmore tender sensibility the loving memory of his simple, generous, and\r\nconsiderate nature.\r\n\r\nThe Apache Indians, whose removal from their reservation in Arizona\r\nfollowed the capture of those of their number who engaged in a bloody\r\nand murderous raid during a part of the years 1885 and 1886, are now\r\nheld as prisoners of war at Mount Vernon Barracks, in the State of\r\nAlabama. They numbered on the 31st day of October, the date of the last\r\nreport, 83 men, 170 women, 70 boys, and 59 girls; in all, 382 persons.\r\nThe commanding officer states that they are in good health and\r\ncontented, and that they are kept employed as fully as is possible in\r\nthe circumstances. The children, as they arrive at a suitable age, are\r\nsent to the Indian schools at Carlisle and Hampton.\r\n\r\nLast summer some charitable and kind people asked permission to send two\r\nteachers to these Indians for the purpose of instructing the adults as\r\nwell as such children as should be found there. Such permission was\r\nreadily granted, accommodations were provided for the teachers, and some\r\nportions of the buildings at the barracks were made available for school\r\npurposes. The good work contemplated has been commenced, and the\r\nteachers engaged are paid by the ladies with whom the plan originated.\r\n\r\nI am not at all in sympathy with those benevolent but injudicious people\r\nwho are constantly insisting that these Indians should be returned to\r\ntheir reservation. Their removal was an absolute necessity if the lives\r\nand property of citizens upon the frontier are to be at all regarded by\r\nthe Government. Their continued restraint at a distance from the scene\r\nof their repeated and cruel murders and outrages is still necessary.\r\nIt is a mistaken philanthropy, every way injurious, which prompts the\r\ndesire to see these savages returned to their old haunts. They are in\r\ntheir present location as the result of the best judgment of those\r\nhaving official responsibility in the matter, and who are by no means\r\nlacking in kind consideration for the Indians. A number of these\r\nprisoners have forfeited their lives to outraged law and humanity.\r\nExperience has proved that they are dangerous and can not be trusted.\r\nThis is true not only of those who on the warpath have heretofore\r\nactually been guilty of atrocious murder, but of their kindred and\r\nfriends, who, while they remained upon their reservation, furnished aid\r\nand comfort to those absent with bloody intent.\r\n\r\nThese prisoners should be treated kindly and kept in restraint far from\r\nthe locality of their former reservation; they should be subjected to\r\nefforts calculated to lead to their improvement and the softening of\r\ntheir savage and cruel instincts, but their return to their old home\r\nshould be persistently resisted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in his report gives a graphic history of these Indians,\r\nand recites with painful vividness their bloody deeds and the unhappy\r\nfailure of the Government to manage them by peaceful means. It will be\r\namazing if a perusal of this history will allow the survival of a desire\r\nfor the return of these prisoners to their reservation upon sentimental\r\nor any other grounds.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy demonstrates very intelligent\r\nmanagement in that important Department, and discloses the most\r\nsatisfactory progress in the work of reconstructing the Navy made during\r\nthe past year. Of the ships in course of construction five, viz. the\r\n_Charleston_, _Baltimore_, _Yorktown_, _Vesuvius_, and the _Petrel_,\r\nhave in that time been launched and are rapidly approaching completion;\r\nand in addition to the above, the _Philadelphia_, the _San Francisco_, the\r\n_Newark_, the _Bennington_, the _Concord_, and the Herreshoff torpedo\r\nboat are all under contract for delivery to the Department during the\r\nnext year. The progress already made and being made gives good ground\r\nfor the expectation that these eleven vessels will be incorporated as\r\npart of the American Navy within the next twelve months.\r\n\r\nThe report shows that notwithstanding the large expenditures for new\r\nconstruction and the additional labor they involve the total ordinary or\r\ncurrent expenditures of the Department for the three years ending June\r\n30, 1888, are less by more than 20 per cent than such expenditures for\r\nthe three years ending June 30, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe various steps which have been taken to improve the business methods\r\nof the Department are reviewed by the Secretary. The purchasing of\r\nsupplies has been consolidated and placed under a responsible bureau\r\nhead. This has resulted in the curtailment of open purchases, which in\r\nthe years 1884 and 1885 amounted to over 50 per cent of all the\r\npurchases of the Department, to less than 11 per cent; so that at the\r\npresent time about 90 per cent of the total departmental purchases are\r\nmade by contract and after competition. As the expenditures on this\r\naccount exceed an average of $2,000,000 annually, it is evident that an\r\nimportant improvement in the system has been inaugurated and substantial\r\neconomies introduced.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows a marked increase of business\r\nin every branch of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe number of post-offices on July 1, 1888, was 57,376, an increase of\r\n6,124 in three years and of 2,219 for the last fiscal year. The\r\nlatter-mentioned increase is classified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  New England States\r\n  Middle States                                               181\r\n  Southern States and Indian Territory (41)                 1,406\r\n  The States and Territories of the Pacific Coast             190\r\n  The ten States and Territories of the West and Northwest    435\r\n  District of Columbia                                          2\r\n                                                            -----\r\n  Total                                                     2,219\r\n\r\n\r\nFree-delivery offices have increased from 189 in the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1887, to 358 in the year ended June 30, 1888.\r\n\r\nIn the Railway Mail Service there has been an increase in one year of\r\n168 routes, and in the number of miles traveled per annum an increase of\r\n15,795,917.48. The estimated increase of railroad service for the year\r\nwas 6,000 miles, but the amount of new railroad service actually put on\r\nwas 12,764.50 miles.\r\n\r\nThe volume of business in the Money-Order Division, including\r\ntransactions in postal notes, reached the sum of upward of $143,000,000\r\nfor the year.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year parcel-post conventions have been concluded with\r\nBarbados, the Bahamas, British Honduras, and Mexico, and are now under\r\nnegotiation with all the Central and South American States. The increase\r\nof correspondence with foreign countries during the past three years is\r\ngratifying, and is especially notable and exceptional with the Central\r\nand South American States and with Mexico. As the greater part of mail\r\nmatter exchanged with these countries is commercial in its character,\r\nthis increase is evidence of the improved business relations with them.\r\nThe practical operation of the parcel-post conventions, so far as\r\nnegotiated, has served to fulfill the most favorable predictions as to\r\ntheir benefits. In January last a general postal convention was\r\nnegotiated with the Dominion of Canada, which went into operation on\r\nMarch 1, and which practically makes one postal territory of the United\r\nStates and Canada. Under it merchandise parcels may now be transmitted\r\nthrough the mails at fourth-class rates of postage.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible here to touch even the leading heads of the great\r\npostal establishment to illustrate the enormous and rapid growth of its\r\nbusiness and the needs for legislative readjustment of much of its\r\nmachinery that it has outgrown. For these and valuable recommendations\r\nof the Postmaster-General attention is earnestly invited to his report.\r\n\r\nA Department whose revenues have increased from $19,772,000 in 1870 to\r\n$52,700,000 in 1888, despite reductions of postage which have enormously\r\nreduced rates of revenue while greatly increasing its business, demands\r\nthe careful consideration of the Congress as to all matters suggested by\r\nthose familiar with its operations, and which are calculated to increase\r\nits efficiency and usefulness.\r\n\r\nA bill proposed by the Postmaster-General was introduced at the last\r\nsession of the Congress by which a uniform standard in the amount of\r\ngross receipts would fix the right of a community to a public building\r\nto be erected by the Government for post-office purposes. It was\r\ndemonstrated that, aside from the public convenience and the promotion\r\nof harmony among citizens, invariably disturbed by change of leasings\r\nand of site, it was a measure of the highest economy and of sound\r\nbusiness judgment. It was found that the Government was paying in rents\r\nat the rate of from 7 to 10 per cent per annum on what the cost of such\r\npublic buildings would be. A very great advantage resulting from such a\r\nlaw would be the prevention of a large number of bills constantly\r\nintroduced for the erection of public buildings at places, and involving\r\nexpenditures not justified by public necessity. I trust that this\r\nmeasure will become a law at the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nOf the total number of postmasters 54,874 are of the fourth class.\r\nThese, of course, receive no allowances whatever for expenses in the\r\nservice, and their compensation is fixed by percentages on receipts at\r\ntheir respective offices. This rate of compensation may have been, and\r\nprobably was, at some time just, but the standard has remained unchanged\r\nthrough the several reductions in the rates of postage. Such reductions\r\nhave necessarily cut down the compensation of these officials, while it\r\nundoubtedly increased the business performed by them. Simple justice\r\nrequires attention to this subject, to the end that fourth-class\r\npostmasters may receive at least an equivalent to that which the law\r\nitself, fixing the rate, intended for them.\r\n\r\nAnother class of postal employees whose condition seems to demand\r\nlegislation is that of clerks in post-offices, and I call especial\r\nattention to the repeated recommendations of the Postmaster-General for\r\ntheir classification. Proper legislation of this character for the\r\nrelief of carriers in the free-delivery service has been frequent.\r\nProvision is made for their promotion; for substitutes for them on\r\nvacation; for substitutes for holidays, and limiting their hours of\r\nlabor. Seven million dollars has been appropriated for the current year\r\nto provide for them, though the total number of offices where they are\r\nemployed is but 358 for the past fiscal year, with an estimated increase\r\nfor the current year of but 40, while the total appropriation for all\r\nclerks in offices throughout the United States is $5,950,000.\r\n\r\nThe legislation affecting the relations of the Government with railroads\r\nis in need of revision. While for the most part the railroad companies\r\nthroughout the country have cordially cooperated with the Post-Office\r\nDepartment in rendering excellent service, yet under the law as it\r\nstands, while the compensation to them for carrying the mail is limited\r\nand regulated, and although railroads are made post-roads by law, there\r\nis no authority reposed anywhere to compel the owner of a railroad to\r\ntake and carry the United States mails. The only alternative provided by\r\nact of Congress in case of refusal is for the Postmaster-General to send\r\nmail forward by pony express. This is but an illustration of ill-fitting\r\nlegislation, reasonable and proper at the time of its enactment, but\r\nlong since outgrown and requiring readjustment.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to note from the carefully prepared statistics\r\naccompanying the Postmaster-General's report that notwithstanding the\r\ngreat expansion of the service the rate of expenditure has been lessened\r\nand efficiency has been improved in every branch; that fraud and crime\r\nhave decreased; that losses from the mails have been reduced, and that\r\nthe number of complaints of the service made to postmasters and to the\r\nDepartment are far less than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of the Department of Justice for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, are contained in the report of the Attorney-General, as\r\nwell as a number of valuable recommendations, the most part of which are\r\nrepetitions of those previously made, and ought to receive\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in this report that though judgments in civil suits\r\namounting to $552,021.08 were recovered in favor of the Government\r\nduring the year, only the sum of $132,934 was collected thereon; and\r\nthat though fines, penalties, and forfeitures were imposed amounting to\r\n$541,808.43, only $109,648.42 of that sum was paid on account thereof.\r\nThese facts may furnish an illustration of the sentiment which\r\nextensively prevails that a debt due the Government should cause no\r\ninconvenience to the citizen.\r\n\r\nIt also appears from this report that though prior to March, 1885, there\r\nhad been but 6 convictions in the Territories of Utah and Idaho under\r\nthe laws of 1862 and 1882, punishing polygamy and unlawful cohabitation\r\nas crimes, there have been since that date nearly 600 convictions under\r\nthese laws and the statutes of 1887; and the opinion is expressed that\r\nunder such a firm and vigilant execution of these laws and the advance\r\nof ideas opposed to the forbidden practices polygamy within the United\r\nStates is virtually at an end.\r\n\r\nSuits instituted by the Government under the provisions of the act of\r\nMarch 3, 1887, for the termination of the corporations known as the\r\nPerpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ of\r\nLatter-day Saints have resulted in a decree favorable to the Government,\r\ndeclaring the charters of these corporations forfeited and escheating\r\ntheir property. Such property, amounting in value to more than $800,000,\r\nis in the hands of a receiver pending further proceedings, an appeal\r\nhaving been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which will be laid\r\nbefore you, the condition of the various branches of our domestic\r\naffairs connected with that Department and its operations during the\r\npast year are fully exhibited. But a brief reference to some of the\r\nsubjects discussed in this able and interesting report can here be made;\r\nbut I commend the entire report to the attention of the Congress, and\r\ntrust that the sensible and valuable recommendations it contains will\r\nsecure careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI can not too strenuously insist upon the importance of proper measures\r\nto insure a right disposition of our public lands, not only as a matter\r\nof present justice, but in forecast of the consequences to future\r\ngenerations. The broad, rich acres of our agricultural plains have been\r\nlong-preserved by nature to become her untrammeled gift to a people\r\ncivilized and free, upon which should rest in well-distributed ownership\r\nthe numerous homes of enlightened, equal, and fraternal citizens. They\r\ncame to national possession with the warning example in our eyes of the\r\nentail of iniquities in landed proprietorship which other countries have\r\npermitted and still suffer. We have no excuse for the violation of\r\nprinciples cogently taught by reason and example, nor for the allowance\r\nof pretexts which have sometimes exposed our lands to colossal greed.\r\nLaws which open a door to fraudulent acquisition, or administration\r\nwhich permits favor to rapacious seizure by a favored few of expanded\r\nareas that many should enjoy, are accessory to offenses against our\r\nnational welfare and humanity not to be too severely condemned or\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that something has been done at last to\r\nredress the injuries to our people and check the perilous tendency of\r\nthe reckless waste of the national domain. That over 80,000,000 acres\r\nhave been arrested from illegal usurpation, improvident grants, and\r\nfraudulent entries and claims, to be taken for the homesteads of honest\r\nindustry--although less than the greater areas thus unjustly lost--must\r\nafford a profound gratification to right-feeling citizens, as it is\r\na recompense for the labors and struggles of the recovery. Our dear\r\nexperience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of measures\r\nof legislation which will confine the future disposition of our\r\nremaining agricultural lands to the uses of actual husbandry and genuine\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nNor should our vast tracts of so-called desert lands be yielded up to\r\nthe monopoly of corporations or grasping individuals, as appears to be\r\nmuch the tendency under the existing statute. These lands require but\r\nthe supply of water to become fertile and productive. It is a problem of\r\ngreat moment how most wisely for the public good that factor shall be\r\nfurnished. I can not but think it perilous to suffer either these lands\r\nor the sources of their irrigation to fall into the hands of monopolies,\r\nwhich by such means may exercise lordship over the areas dependent on\r\ntheir treatment for productiveness. Already steps have been taken to\r\nsecure accurate and scientific information of the conditions, which is\r\nthe prime basis of intelligent action. Until this shall be gained the\r\ncourse of wisdom appears clearly to lie in a suspension of further\r\ndisposal, which only promises to create rights antagonistic to the\r\ncommon interest. No harm can follow this cautionary conduct. The land\r\nwill remain, and the public good presents no demand for hasty\r\ndispossession of national ownership and control.\r\n\r\nI commend also the recommendations that appropriate measures be taken to\r\ncomplete the adjustment of the various grants made to the States for\r\ninternal improvements and of swamp and overflowed lands, as well as to\r\nadjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous\r\nprivate land claims. All these are elements of great injustice and peril\r\nto the settlers upon the localities affected; and now that their\r\nexistence can not be avoided, no duty is more pressing than to fix as\r\nsoon as possible their bounds and terminate the threats of trouble which\r\narise from uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our Indian population continues to improve and the\r\nproofs multiply that the transforming change, so much to be desired,\r\nwhich shall substitute for barbarism enlightenment and civilizing\r\neducation, is in favorable progress. Our relations with these people\r\nduring the year have been disturbed by no serious disorders, but rather\r\nmarked by a better realization of their true interests and increasing\r\nconfidence and good will. These conditions testify to the value of the\r\nhigher tone of consideration and humanity which has governed the later\r\nmethods of dealing with them, and commend its continued observance.\r\n\r\nAllotments in severalty have been made on some reservations until all\r\nthose entitled to land thereon have had their shares assigned, and the\r\nwork is still continued. In directing the execution of this duty I have\r\nnot aimed so much at rapid dispatch as to secure just and fair\r\narrangements which shall best conduce to the objects of the law by\r\nproducing satisfaction with the results of the allotments made. No\r\nmeasure of general effect has ever been entered on from which more may\r\nbe fairly hoped if it shall be discreetly administered. It proffers\r\nopportunity and inducement to that independence of spirit and life which\r\nthe Indian peculiarly needs, while at the same time the inalienability\r\nof title affords security against the risks his inexperience of affairs\r\nor weakness of character may expose him to in dealing with others.\r\nWhenever begun upon any reservation it should be made complete, so that\r\nall are brought to the same condition, and as soon as possible community\r\nin lands should cease by opening such as remain unallotted to\r\nsettlement. Contact with the ways of industrious and successful farmers\r\nwill perhaps add a healthy emulation which will both instruct and\r\nstimulate.\r\n\r\nBut no agency for the amelioration of this people appears to me so\r\npromising as the extension, urged by the Secretary, of such complete\r\nfacilities of education as shall at the earliest possible day embrace\r\nall teachable Indian youth, of both sexes, and retain them with a kindly\r\nand beneficent hold until their characters are formed and their\r\nfaculties and dispositions trained to the sure pursuit of some form of\r\nuseful industry. Capacity of the Indian no longer needs demonstration.\r\nIt is established. It remains to make the most of it, and when that\r\nshall be done the curse will be lifted, the Indian race saved, and the\r\nsin of their oppression redeemed. The time of its accomplishment depends\r\nupon the spirit and justice with which it shall be prosecuted. It can\r\nnot be too soon for the Indian nor for the interests and good name of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe average attendance of Indian pupils on the schools increased by over\r\n900 during the year, and the total enrollment reached 15,212. The cost\r\nof maintenance was not materially raised. The number of teachable Indian\r\nyouth is now estimated at 40,000, or nearly three times the enrollment\r\nof the schools. It is believed the obstacles in the way of instructing\r\nare all surmountable, and that the necessary expenditure would be a\r\nmeasure of economy.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux tribes on the great reservation of Dakota refused to assent to\r\nthe act passed by the Congress at its last session for opening a portion\r\nof their lands to settlement, notwithstanding modification of the terms\r\nwas suggested which met most of their objections. Their demand is for\r\nimmediate payment of the full price of $1.25 per acre for the entire\r\nbody of land the occupancy of which they are asked to relinquish.\r\n\r\nThe manner of submission insured their fair understanding of the law,\r\nand their action was undoubtedly as thoroughly intelligent as their\r\ncapacity admitted. It is at least gratifying that no reproach of\r\nover-reaching can in any manner lie against the Government, however\r\nadvisable the favorable completion of the negotiation may have been\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\nI concur in the suggestions of the Secretary regarding the Turtle\r\nMountain Indians, the two reservations in California, and the Crees.\r\nThey should, in my opinion, receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nThe number of pensioners added to the rolls during the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1888, is 60,252, and increase of pensions was granted in 45,716\r\ncases. The names of 15,730 pensioners were dropped from the rolls during\r\nthe year from various causes, and at the close of the year the number of\r\npersons of all classes receiving pensions was 452,557. Of these there\r\nwere 806 survivors of the War of 1812, 10,787 widows of those who served\r\nin that war, 16,060 soldiers of the Mexican War, and 5,104 widows of\r\nsaid soldiers.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and two different rates of pensions are paid to these\r\nbeneficiaries, ranging from $2 to $416.66 per month.\r\n\r\nThe amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year was $78,775,861.92,\r\nbeing an increase over the preceding year of $5,308,280.22. The expenses\r\nattending the maintenance and operation of the Pension Bureau during\r\nthat period was $3,262,524.67, making the entire expenditures of the\r\nBureau $82,038,386.57, being 21-1/2 per cent of the gross income and\r\nnearly 31 per cent of the total expenditures of the Government during\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that our general pension laws should be\r\nrevised and adjusted to meet as far as possible, in the light of our\r\nexperience, all meritorious cases. The fact that 102 different rates of\r\npensions are paid can not, in my opinion, be made consistent with\r\njustice to the pensioners or to the Government; and the numerous private\r\npension bills that are passed, predicated upon the imperfection of\r\ngeneral laws, while they increase in many cases existing inequality and\r\ninjustice, lend additional force to the recommendation for a revision of\r\nthe general laws on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe laxity of ideas prevailing among a large number of our people\r\nregarding pensions is becoming every day more marked. The principles\r\nupon which they should be granted are in danger of being altogether\r\nignored, and already pensions are often claimed because the applicants\r\nare as much entitled as other successful applicants, rather than upon\r\nany disability reasonably attributable to military service. If the\r\nestablishment of vicious precedents be continued, if the granting of\r\npensions be not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant\r\nconsiderations, and if the honorable name of veteran unfairly becomes by\r\nthese means but another term for one who constantly clamors for the aid\r\nof the Government, there is danger that injury will be done to the fame\r\nand patriotism of many whom our citizens all delight to honor, and that\r\na prejudice will be aroused unjust to meritorious applicants for\r\npensions.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has continued, with a good measure of\r\nsuccess, its efforts to develop the processes, enlarge the results,\r\nand augment the profits of American husbandry. It has collected and\r\ndistributed practical information, introduced and tested new plants,\r\nchecked the spread of contagious diseases of farm animals, resisted the\r\nadvance of noxious insects and destructive fungous growths, and sought\r\nto secure to agricultural labor the highest reward of effort and the\r\nfullest immunity from loss. Its records of the year show that the season\r\nof 1888 has been one of medium production. A generous supply of the\r\ndemands of consumption has been assured, and a surplus for exportation,\r\nmoderate in certain products and bountiful in others, will prove a\r\nbenefaction alike to buyer and grower.\r\n\r\nFour years ago it was found that the great cattle industry of the\r\ncountry was endangered, and those engaged in it were alarmed at the\r\nrapid extension of the European lung plague of pleuro-pneumonia. Serious\r\noutbreaks existed in Illinois, Missouri, and Kentucky, and in Tennessee\r\nanimals affected were held in quarantine. Five counties in New York and\r\nfrom one to four counties in each of the States of New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland were almost equally affected.\r\n\r\nWith this great danger upon us and with the contagion already in the\r\nchannels of commerce, with the enormous direct and indirect losses\r\nalready being caused by it, and when only prompt and energetic action\r\ncould be successful, there were in none of these States any laws\r\nauthorizing this Department to eradicate the malady or giving the State\r\nofficials power to cooperate with it for this purpose. The Department\r\neven lacked both the requisite appropriation and authority.\r\n\r\nBy securing State cooperation in connection with authority from Congress\r\nthe work of eradication has been pressed successfully, and this dreaded\r\ndisease has been extirpated from the Western States and also from the\r\nEastern States, with the exception of a few restricted areas, which are\r\nstill under supervision. The danger has thus been removed, and trade and\r\ncommerce have been freed from the vexatious State restrictions which\r\nwere deemed necessary for a time.\r\n\r\nDuring the past four years the process of diffusion, as applied to the\r\nmanufacture of sugar from sorghum and sugar cane, has been introduced\r\ninto this country and fully perfected by the experiments carried on\r\nby the Department of Agriculture. This process is now universally\r\nconsidered to be the most economical one, and it is through it that the\r\nsorghum-sugar industry has been established upon a firm basis and the\r\nroad to its future success opened. The adoption of this diffusion\r\nprocess is also extending in Louisiana and other sugar-producing parts\r\nof the country, and will doubtless soon be the only method employed for\r\nthe extraction of sugar from the cane.\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive study has also within the same period been undertaken of\r\nthe subject of food adulteration and the best analytical methods for\r\ndetecting it. A part of the results of this work has already been\r\npublished by the Department, which, with the matter in course of\r\npreparation, will make the most complete treatise on that subject that\r\nhas ever been published in any country.\r\n\r\nThe Department seeks a progressive development. It would combine the\r\ndiscoveries of science with the economics and amelioration of rural\r\npractice. A supervision of the endowed experimental-station system\r\nrecently provided for is a proper function of the Department, and is now\r\nin operation. This supervision is very important, and should be wisely\r\nand vigilantly directed, to the end that the pecuniary aid of the\r\nGovernment in favor of intelligent agriculture should be so applied as\r\nto result in the general good and to the benefit of all our people, thus\r\njustifying the appropriations made from the public Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the relations between the Government and the railroad\r\ncompanies which have received land grants and the guaranty of the public\r\ncredit in aid of the construction of their roads should receive early\r\nattention. The report of a majority of the commissioners appointed to\r\nexamine the affairs and indebtedness of these roads, in which they favor\r\nan extension of the time for the payment of such indebtedness in at\r\nleast one case where the corporation appears to be able to comply with\r\nwell-guarded and exact terms of such extension, and the reenforcement\r\nof their opinion by gentlemen of undoubted business judgment and\r\nexperience, appointed to protect the interests of the Government as\r\ndirectors of said corporation, may well lead to the belief that such an\r\nextension would be to the advantage of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe subject should be treated as a business proposition with a view to a\r\nfinal realization of its indebtedness by the Government, rather than as\r\na question to be decided upon prejudice or by way of punishment for\r\nprevious wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, with its\r\naccompanying documents, gives in detail the operations of the several\r\ndepartments of the District government, and furnishes evidence that the\r\nfinancial affairs of the District are at present in such satisfactory\r\ncondition as to justify the Commissioners in submitting to the Congress\r\nestimates for desirable and needed improvements.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners recommend certain legislation which in their opinion\r\nis necessary to advance the interests of the District.\r\n\r\nI invite your special attention to their request for such legislation\r\nas will enable the Commissioners without delay to collect, digest, and\r\nproperly arrange the laws by which the District is governed, and which\r\nare now embraced in several collections, making them available only with\r\ngreat difficulty and labor. The suggestions they make touching desirable\r\namendments to the laws relating to licenses granted for carrying on the\r\nretail traffic in spirituous liquors, to the observance of Sunday, to\r\nthe proper assessment and collection of taxes, to the speedy punishment\r\nof minor offenders, and to the management and control of the reformatory\r\nand charitable institutions supported by Congressional appropriations\r\nare commended to careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI again call attention to the present inconvenience and the danger to\r\nlife and property attending the operation of steam railroads through and\r\nacross the public streets and roads of the District. The propriety of\r\nsuch legislation as will properly guard the use of these railroads and\r\nbetter secure the convenience and safety of citizens is manifest.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness that I have presented but an imperfect statement\r\nof the condition of our country and its wants occasions no fear that\r\nanything omitted is not known and appreciated by the Congress, upon whom\r\nrests the responsibility of intelligent legislation in behalf of a great\r\nnation and a confiding people.\r\n\r\nAs public servants we shall do our duty well if we constantly guard the\r\nrectitude of our intentions, maintain unsullied our love of country, and\r\nwith unselfish purpose strive for the public good.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See pp. 603-607.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: See pp. 620-627.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See pp. 628-530.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See p. 612.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 21, 1888_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of April last I transmitted to the House of Representatives,\r\nin response to its resolution of the 8th of the preceding March, a\r\nreport of the Secretary of State, with accompanying correspondence,\r\nrelative to affairs in Samoa.[23] On the same day I answered a resolution\r\nof the Senate of the 21st of the preceding December to the same effect,\r\nbut adopted in executive session, and, in order to avoid duplication of\r\nthe numerous documents involved, referred to the correspondence which\r\naccompanied my public response to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and which was duly printed and published by order of\r\nthat body (House Executive Document No. 238, Fiftieth Congress, first\r\nsession).\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of the 3d instant I announced my intention in due\r\ncourse to lay before Congress further correspondence on Samoan affairs.\r\nAccordingly, I now transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying correspondence, on that subject.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See p. 612.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 2, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nOn or about the 25th day of September, 1888, I received a copy of a\r\nresolution adopted on that day by the Senate in executive session,\r\nrequesting the transmission to that body by the President of all\r\ncommunications and correspondence (not heretofore sent to the Senate)\r\nunder his control on the subject of the proposed convention with China,\r\ntransmitted by him to the Senate by message dated 16th March, 1888,[24]\r\nand on the subject of the reported failure of the Government of China to\r\nfinally agree to the same.\r\n\r\nA few days after the copy of said resolution was received by me, and on\r\nthe 1st day of October, 1888, I sent a communication to the\r\nCongress,[25] accompanying my approval of a bill prohibiting the return\r\nof Chinese laborers to the United States, in which I supposed all the\r\ninformation sought under the terms of the Senate resolution above\r\nrecited was fully supplied.\r\n\r\nI beg to refer in this connection to Senate Executive Document No. 273,\r\nfirst session of the Fiftieth Congress, and especially to page 3\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nBelieving the information contained in said document answered the\r\npurposes of said Senate resolution, no separate and explicit answer was\r\nmade thereto.\r\n\r\nBut in my message of October 1, 1888, the tenor and purport of a cipher\r\ndispatch from our minister in China to the Secretary of State, dated\r\nSeptember 21, 1888, was given instead of attempting to transmit a copy\r\nof the same.\r\n\r\nFor greater precision, however, and with the object of answering in more\r\nexact terms the resolution of the Senate, I transmit with this, in\r\nparaphrase of the cipher, a copy of the said dispatch.

But thus far her propositions on\r\nthis subject seem to lead to such a preponderance of German power in\r\nSamoa as was never contemplated by us and is inconsistent with every\r\nprior agreement or understanding, while her recent conduct as between\r\nnative warring factions gives rise to the suspicion that she is not\r\ncontent with a neutral position.\r\n\r\nActing within the restraints which our Constitution and laws have placed\r\nupon Executive power, I have insisted that the autonomy and independence\r\nof Samoa should be scrupulously preserved according to the treaties made\r\nwith Samoa by the powers named and their agreements and understanding\r\nwith each other. I have protested against every act apparently tending\r\nin an opposite direction, and during the existence of internal\r\ndisturbance one or more vessels of war have been kept in Samoan waters\r\nto protect American citizens and property.\r\n\r\nThese things will abundantly appear from the correspondence and papers\r\nwhich have been submitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nA recent collision between the forces from a German man-of-war stationed\r\nin Samoan waters and a body of natives rendered the situation so\r\ndelicate and critical that the war ship _Trenton_, under the\r\nimmediate command of Admiral Kimberly, was ordered to join the\r\n_Nipsic_, already at Samoa, for the better protection of the\r\npersons and property of our citizens and in furtherance of efforts to\r\nrestore order and safety.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress is especially called to the instructions\r\ngiven to Admiral Kimberly dated on the 11th instant and the letter of\r\nthe Secretary of State to the German minister dated the 12th instant,\r\nwhich will be found among the papers herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nBy means of the papers and documents heretofore submitted and those\r\nwhich accompany this communication the precise situation of affairs in\r\nSamoa is laid before the Congress, and such Executive action as has been\r\ntaken is fully exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe views of the Executive in respect of the just policy to be pursued\r\nwith regard to this group of islands, which lie in the direct highway of\r\na growing and important commerce between Australia and the United\r\nStates, have found expression in the correspondence and documents which\r\nhave thus been fully communicated to the Congress, and the subject in\r\nits present stage is submitted to the wider discretion conferred by the\r\nConstitution upon the legislative branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See p. 612.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: See p. 800.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 15, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n4th instant, a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ncopies of correspondence, touching recent occurrences in the island of\r\nHayti, both as relates to the state of the Government there and to the\r\nseizure and delivery up of the American vessel _Haytien Republic_.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 16, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to lay before you a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith accompanying correspondence, in relation to the possible\r\ndisturbances on the Isthmus of Panama in the event of the stoppage of\r\nwork on the proposed interoceanic canal.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 21, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n5th instant, a report of the Secretary of State, touching correspondence\r\nwith Venezuela in regard to the exchange of ratifications of the claims\r\nconvention of December 5, 1885, between the United States and Venezuela\r\nand to the suspension by Venezuela of the monthly quotas of indebtedness\r\nunder the convention between the two countries of April 25, 1866,\r\ntogether with copies of sundry correspondence between the Department of\r\nState and owners of Venezuelan certificates of award or their attorneys\r\non the same subject, as requested in said resolution.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 30, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nFor the information of Congress I herewith transmit a report of the\r\nSecretary of State, with accompanying correspondence, relating to the\r\nexecution of an agreement made between the representatives of certain\r\nforeign powers and the Korean Government in 1884 in respect to a foreign\r\nsettlement at Chemulpo.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 30, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI had the honor on the 15th instant to communicate to your honorable\r\nbody certain correspondence and documents in relation to affairs in\r\nthe Samoan Islands[29];

It was confirmed by a\r\nSenate resolution passed July 19, 1866, and was proclaimed August 11,\r\n1866 (14 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 785).\r\n\r\nThe third article of the treaty makes a cession of lands in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n  In compliance with the desire of the United States to locate other\r\n  Indians and freedmen thereon, the Creeks hereby cede and convey to the\r\n  United States, to be sold to and used as homes for such other civilized\r\n  Indians as the United States may choose to settle thereon, the west half\r\n  of their entire domain, to be divided by a line running north and south;\r\n  the eastern half of said Creek lands, being retained by them, shall,\r\n  except as herein otherwise stipulated, be forever set apart as a home\r\n  for said Creek Nation; and in consideration of said cession of the west\r\n  half of their lands, estimated to contain 3,250,560 acres, the United\r\n  States agree to pay the sum of 30 cents per acre, amounting to $975,168.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provision that the lands conveyed were \"_to be sold to_ and\r\nused as homes for such other civilized Indians,\" etc., has been steadily\r\nregarded as a limitation upon the grant made to the United States. Such\r\na construction is admitted to be the true one in many ways, especially\r\nby the continual reservation of the ceded lands from settlement by the\r\nwhites, by the sale of a portion of the same to Indians, by the use of\r\nother portions as the home of Indians, and also by various provisions\r\nin proposed legislation in Congress. Thus the bill now pending for the\r\norganization of Oklahoma provides for the payment to the Creeks and\r\nSeminoles of the ordinary Government price of $1.25 per acre, less the\r\namount heretofore paid.\r\n\r\nThe section of the law of 1885 first above quoted appears also to have\r\nbeen passed in contemplation not only of the existence of a claim on the\r\npart of the Creeks, but of the substantial foundation of that claim in\r\nequity, if not in law, and in acknowledgment of the duty of the\r\nGovernment to satisfactorily discharge the claim of the Indian people\r\nbefore putting the land to the free uses of settlement and territorial\r\noccupation by whites.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to have been considered that so far as the lands had been\r\nassigned they may fairly be taken to be such as under the treaty were\r\n\"to be sold.\" As to these, they having been assigned or \"sold\" in\r\naccordance with said treaty, the claim of the Creeks thereto has been\r\nentirely discharged, and the title from the United States passed\r\nunburdened with any condition or limitation to the grantees. This seems\r\nto be an entirely clear proposition.\r\n\r\nThe unassigned lands must be those which are unsold, because not\r\nonly is that the fair significance of the term, as used technically in\r\nconveyancing, but because the limiting condition in the Creek treaty was\r\nthat the lands should be sold to, as well as used as homes for, other\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The total quantity of lands in the western half of the           Acres.\r\n    Creek Nation, and which were ceded in 1866, is            3,402,428.88\r\n\r\n  The assigned lands as above\r\n    defined are in three bodies:                 Acres.\r\n\r\n  1. The Seminole country,\r\n     by the treaty of 1866                     200,000.00\r\n\r\n  2.

The Pawnee Reservation, granted by\r\n     section 4 of the act of Congress of\r\n     April 10, 1876 (19 U.S. Statutes at\r\n     large, p. 29), for which the Government\r\n     received the price allowed the Creeks,\r\n     30 cents per acre                          53,005.94\r\n\r\n  Making a total of assigned or sold lands of                   732,673.99\r\n\r\n  And leaving as the total unassigned lands                   2,669,754.89\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this total quantity of unassigned land which is subject to the\r\nnegotiations provided for under the law of 1885 there should be a\r\nfurther division made in considering the sum which ought fairly to be\r\npaid in discharge of the Creek claim thereto.\r\n\r\nI. In that part of these lands called the Oklahoma country no Indians\r\nhave been allowed to reside by any action of the Government, nor has any\r\nexecution been attempted of the limiting condition of the cession of\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of these lands carefully computed from the surveys is\r\n1,392,704.70 acres.\r\n\r\nII. The remainder of these unassigned lands has been appropriated in\r\nsome degree to Indian uses, although still within the control of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThus by three Executive orders the following Indian reservations have\r\nbeen created:\r\n\r\n                                                                   Acres.\r\n  1. By President Grant, August 10, 1869, the\r\n     reservation of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes,\r\n     which embraces of this land                                619,450.59\r\n  2. By President Arthur, August 15, 1883,\r\n     the reservation for the Iowas, containing                  228,417.67\r\n  3. By President Arthur, August 15, 1883,\r\n     the Kickapoo Reservation, embracing.                       206,465.61\r\n  4. A tract set apart for the Pottawatomies by the\r\n     treaty of February 27, 1867 (15 U.S. Statutes\r\n     at large, p. 531), followed by the act of\r\n     May 23, 1872 (17 U.S. Statutes at large, p. 159),\r\n     by which individual allotments were authorized\r\n     upon the tract, though but very few Indians have\r\n     selected and paid for such allotments according\r\n     to the provisions of that law. The entire quantity\r\n     of the Pottawatomie Reservation is                         222,716.32\r\n\r\n     This shows the quantity of lands unassigned, but\r\n     to some extent appropriated to Indian uses by the\r\n     Government, amounting to                                 1,277,050.19\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the lands which are not only unassigned, but are unoccupied, and\r\nwhich have been in no way appropriated, it appears clearly just and\r\nright that a price of at least $1.25 should be allowed to the Creeks.\r\nThey held more than the ordinary Indian title, for they had a patent in\r\nfee from the Government. The Osages of Kansas were allowed $1.25 per\r\nacre upon giving up their reservation, and this land of the Creeks\r\nis reported by those familiar with it to be equal to any land in the\r\ncountry. Without regard to the present enhanced value of this land, and\r\nif reference be only had to the conditions when the cession was made, no\r\nless price ought to be paid for it than the ordinary Government price.\r\nTherefore in this, provisional agreement which has been made with the\r\nCreeks the price of $1.25 has been settled upon for such land, with the\r\ndeduction of the 30 cents per acre which has already been paid by the\r\nGovernment therefor.\r\n\r\nAs to the remainder of the unassigned lands, in view of the fact that\r\nsome use has been made of them of the general character indicated by the\r\ntreaty of 1866, and because some portion of them should be allotted to\r\nIndians under the general allotment act, and to cover the expenses of\r\nsurveys and adjustments, a diminishment of 20 cents per acre has been\r\nacceded to. There is no difference in the character of the lands.\r\n\r\nThus, computing the unassigned and entirely unappropriated land, being\r\nthe Oklahoma country, containing 1,392,704.70 acres, at 95 cents per\r\nacre, and the remainder which has been appropriated to the extent above\r\nstated, being 1,277,050.19 acres, at 75 cents per acre, the total price\r\nstipulated in the agreement has been reached--$2,280,857.10.\r\n\r\nBut as it was desirable that the Indian title should be beyond all\r\nquestion extinguished to all parts of the land ceded by the Creeks in\r\n1866, with their full consent and understanding, the agreement of\r\ncession has been made to embrace a complete surrender of all claim to\r\nthe western half of their domain, including the assigned as well as the\r\nunassigned lands, for the price named. So the agreement takes the form\r\nin the first article of such a cession, and in the second article is\r\nstipulated the price in gross of all the lands and interests ceded, with\r\nno detailed reference to the manner of its ascertainment.\r\n\r\nThe overtures which led to this agreement were made by representatives\r\nof the Creek Nation, who came here for that purpose. They were\r\nintelligent and evidently loyal to the interests of their people. The\r\nterms of the agreement were fully discussed and concessions were made by\r\nboth parties. It was promptly confirmed by the National Council of the\r\nCreek Indians, and its complete consummation only waits the approval of\r\nthe Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that such ratification will be of decided benefit to the\r\nGovernment, and that the agreement is entirely free from any suspicion\r\nof unfairness or injustice toward the Indians.\r\n\r\nI desire to call especial attention to the fact that to become effective\r\nthe agreement must be ratified by the Congress prior to the its day of\r\nJuly, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe draft of an act of ratification is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 8, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a further report of the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying correspondence, relating to Samoa, and the joint protocols\r\nof the conferences held in this city in the summer of 1887, to the\r\npublication of which the Governments of Germany and Great Britain have\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 8, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 23d ultimo, directing\r\nthe Secretary of State to transmit to that body copies of all\r\ncorrespondence on the files of his Department relative to the case of\r\nthe ship _Bridgewater_, I transmit herewith, being of the opinion\r\nthat it is not incompatible with the public interest to do so, a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State, accompanying which is the correspondence\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 12, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, in reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 2d\r\nultimo, a report from the Secretary of State, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, in relation to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 19, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI herewith submit, for your consideration, a communication from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, transmitting a proposition made on behalf of\r\nthe Seminole Nation of Indians for the relinquishment to the Government\r\nof the United States of their right to certain lands in the Indian\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 19, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant, I\r\nreturn herewith the bill (S. 3640) entitled \"An act to amend the laws\r\nrelating to the selection and service of jurors in the supreme court of\r\nthe District of Columbia.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 20, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State of this day's\r\ndate, with accompanying correspondence, touching the case of Lord\r\nSackville.[30]\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The British minister at Washington, who was given his\r\npassports for writing an indiscreet letter on American politics.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 22, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, with a view to its ratification, a convention\r\nsigned on the 2d day of June, 1887, between the United States and the\r\nNetherlands, for the extradition of criminals;

Chamberlain, of California.\"\r\n\r\nThese parties were, respectively, for a number of years prior to 1879,\r\nthe register and receiver of the land office at San Francisco, in the\r\nState of California.\r\n\r\nPrior to July, 1877, they had collected and retained, apparently without\r\nquestion, certain fees allowed by law for reducing to writing the\r\ntestimony heard by them in establishing the rights of claimants to\r\npublic lands.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th day of July, 1877, these officials were notified by the\r\nActing Commissioner of the General Land Office that monthly thereafter,\r\nand dating from July 1, 1877, such fees should be reported with other\r\nfees to the General Land Office.\r\n\r\nThis notification furnished clear information that, whatever may have\r\nbeen the justification for their retention of these fees in the past,\r\nthe parties notified must thereafter account to the Government for the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of February, 1879, the beneficiaries were peremptorily\r\nrequired by the Commissioner of the General Land Office to deposit in\r\nthe Treasury of the United States the sums which they had received for\r\nthe services mentioned since July 1, 1877, and which, though reported,\r\nhad not been paid over. Soon thereafter, and pursuant to this demand,\r\nthe sum of $5,330.76, being the aggregate of such fees for the nineteen\r\nmonths between July 1, 1877, and February 1, 1879, was paid over to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th day of February, 1879, these officers were authorized to\r\nemploy two clerks, each upon a salary of $100 per month.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the bill now under consideration is to restore to the\r\nbeneficiaries from the money paid over to the Government, as above\r\nstated, the sum of $3,800. This is proposed upon the theory that clerks\r\nwere employed by the register and receiver to do the work for which the\r\nfees were received, and that these officials having paid them for their\r\nservices they should be reimbursed from the fund.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that whatever services were performed by clerks in\r\nthe way of writing down testimony, and paid for by the beneficiaries,\r\nwere performed and paid for after July, 1877, and after they had in\r\neffect received notice that such employment and payment would not be\r\napproved by the Government.\r\n\r\nUpon this statement the claim covered by the Dill can hardly be urged on\r\nlegal grounds, whatever the Government may have allowed prior to such\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nI am decidedly of the opinion that the relations, the duties, and the\r\nobligations of subordinates in public employment should be clearly\r\ndefined and strictly limited. They should not be permitted to judge of\r\nthe propriety or necessity of incurring expenses on behalf of the\r\nGovernment without authority, much less in disregard of orders. And yet\r\nthere are cases when in an emergency money is paid for the benefit of\r\nthe public service by an official which, though not strictly authorized,\r\nought in equity to be reimbursed.\r\n\r\nIf there is any equity existing in favor of the beneficiaries named in\r\nthe bill herewith returned, it is found in the fact that during the\r\nnineteen months from the 1st day of July, 1877, to the 1st day of\r\nFebruary, 1879, they paid out certain moneys for which the Government,\r\nin the receipt of the fees which they paid over, received the benefit.\r\nManifestly such equity in this case, if it can be claimed at all in view\r\nof the facts recited, is measured by the sum actually paid by these\r\nofficials to the persons, if such there were, who did the work from\r\nwhich the fees arose which were paid over to the Government.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if certain clerks were paid by the beneficiaries from\r\ntheir private funds for doing this work, there should be a distinct\r\nstatement of the sum so paid, and their claim should rest upon indemnity\r\nand reimbursement alone. But no such statement appears, so far as I can\r\nsee from an examination of papers presented to me by the Interior\r\nDepartment and from the report of the Senate committee who reported this\r\nbill, except as it may be gathered from the rather indirect allegations\r\ncontained in a paper prepared by counsel.\r\n\r\nNo vouchers have ever been received at the General Land Office for\r\nmoney paid for clerical services rendered during the period for which\r\nreimbursement is sought. The verified statement of the claimants annexed\r\nto the committee's report contains only the allegation that they paid\r\nfor the necessary clerical services, and the affidavits of the clerks\r\nthemselves furnish no clew to the amount they received. Such an\r\nomission, in my opinion, discredits the claim made, and the allowance of\r\nthe sum of $100 per month for two clerks during the period of nineteen\r\nmonths covered by this claim, because that was the sum authorized to be\r\npaid thereafter for clerks' services, is, it seems to me, adopting a\r\nstandard entirely inapplicable to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn any event these beneficiaries should be required to establish the sum\r\nnecessary for such indemnification, and the amount appropriated for\r\ntheir relief should be limited to that sum.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 18, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9173, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mary J.

Upon appeal to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior he states the settled doctrine of such cases\r\nto be that \"service must have been _in_, not simply _during_,\r\na war to give title to bounty land.\"\r\n\r\nThe only claim made by the beneficiary is that the vessel upon which he\r\nwas employed was engaged for a time in transporting seamen from New\r\nOrleans, where they were enlisted, to Pensacola, and that he was\r\ninformed and believed that they were enlisted to serve on board vessels\r\ncomposing the Gulf Squadron, then cooperating with the land forces in\r\nthe Mexican War.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it is establishing a bad precedent, tending to the\r\nbreaking down of all distinctions between civil and military employment\r\nand service, to hold that a man engaged on a vessel transporting\r\nrecruits to a rendezvous from which they may be sent to the scene of\r\nhostilities should be allowed the same advantages which are bestowed\r\nupon those actually engaged in or more directly related to the dangers\r\nand chances of military operations.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 18, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 9252, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mrs. Catherine Barberick, of Watertown.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill is the mother of William Barberick,\r\nwho enlisted February 19, 1862, and died of smallpox August 2, 1864, at\r\nhis home while on veteran furlough.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that the soldier contracted the fatal disease while in\r\nthe Army.

This grant was accepted on the 9th\r\nday of January, 1847, by the State of Iowa, as required by the act of\r\nCongress, and soon thereafter the question arose whether the lands\r\ngranted were limited to those which adjoined the river in its course\r\nnorthwesterly from the southerly line of the State to a point called the\r\nRaccoon Fork, or whether such grant covered lands so adjoining the river\r\nthrough its entire course through the Territory, and both below and\r\nabove the Raccoon Fork.\r\n\r\nThe Acting Commissioner of the General Land Office, on the 17th day of\r\nOctober, 1846, instructed the officers of the land office in Iowa that\r\nthe grant extended only to the Raccoon Fork.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of February, 1848, the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office held that the grant extended along the entire course of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this opinion, the President, in June, 1848, proclaimed\r\nthe lands upon the river above the Raccoon Fork to be open for sale and\r\nsettlement under the land laws, and about 25,000 acres were sold to and\r\npreempted by settlers under said proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, and before the organization of the Department of the Interior,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury decided, upon a protest against opening\r\nsaid lands for sale and settlement, that the grant extended along the\r\nentire course of the river.\r\n\r\nPursuant to this decision, and on the 1st day of June, 1849, the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office directed the reservation or the\r\nwithholding from sale of all lands on the odd-numbered sections along\r\nthe Des Moines River above the Raccoon Fork.\r\n\r\nThis reservation from entry and sale under the general land laws seems\r\nto have continued until a deed of the lands so reserved was made by the\r\nState of Iowa and until the said deed was supplemented and confirmed by\r\nthe action of the Congress in 1861 and 1862.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1850, the Secretary of the Interior, that Department having\r\nthen been created, determined that the grant extended no farther than\r\nthe Raccoon Fork; but in view of the fact that Congress was in session\r\nand might take steps in the matter, the Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice expressly continued the reservation.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1851, another Secretary of the Interior, while expressing\r\nthe opinion that the grant only extended to the Raccoon Fork, declared\r\nthat he would approve the selections made by the State of Iowa of lands\r\nabove that point, \"leaving the question as to the construction of the\r\nstatute entirely open to the action of the judiciary.\"\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs selections were made by Iowa of a large\r\nquantity of land lying above the Raccoon Fork, which selections were\r\napproved and the land certified to the State. In the meantime the State\r\nhad entered upon the improvement of the river and it appears had\r\ndisposed of some of the land in furtherance of said improvement. But in\r\n1854 the State of Iowa made a contract with the Des Moines Navigation\r\nand Railroad Company for the continuance of said work at a cost of\r\n$1,300,000, the State agreeing in payment thereof to convey to the\r\ncompany all the land which had been or should thereafter be certified to\r\nthe State of Iowa under the grant of 1846.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1856, further certification of lands above the Raccoon Fork\r\nunder the grant to the State of Iowa was refused by the Interior\r\nDepartment. This led to a dispute and settlement between the State of\r\nIowa and the Des Moines Navigation and Railroad Company, by which the\r\nState conveyed by deed to said company--\r\n\r\n  All lands granted by an act of Congress approved August 8, 1846, to the\r\n  then Territory of Iowa to aid in the improvement of the Des Moines River\r\n  which have been approved and certified to the State of Iowa by the\r\n  General Government, saving and excepting all lands sold and conveyed,\r\n  or agreed to be sold and conveyed, by the State, by its officers and\r\n  agents, prior to the 23d day of December, 1853, under said grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exception was declared in the deed to cover the lands above the\r\nRaccoon Fork disposed of to settlers by the Government in 1848 under the\r\nproclamation of the President opening said lands to sale and settlement,\r\nwhich has been referred to; and it is conceded that neither these lands\r\nnor the rights of any settlers thereto are affected by the terms of the\r\nbill now under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe amount of land embraced in this deed located above the Raccoon Fork\r\nappears to be more than 271,000 acres.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that the company in winding up its affairs distributed\r\nthis land among the parties interested, and that said land, or a large\r\npart of it, has been sold to numerous parties now claiming the same\r\nunder titles derived from said company.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1859, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that\r\nthe grant to the Territory of Iowa under the law of 1846 conveyed no\r\nland above the Raccoon Fork, and that all selections and certifications\r\nof lands above that point were unauthorized and void, and passed no\r\ntitle or interest in said lands to the State of Iowa. In other words, it\r\nwas determined that these lands were, in the language of the bill under\r\nconsideration, \"improperly certified to Iowa by the Department of the\r\nInterior under the act of August 8, 1846.\"\r\n\r\nThis adjudication would seem to conclusively determine that the title to\r\nthese lands was, as the law then stood, and notwithstanding all that had\r\ntaken place, still in the United States. And for the purpose of granting\r\nall claim or right of the Government to said lands for the benefit of\r\nthe grantees of the State of Iowa, Congress, on the 2d day of March,\r\n1861, passed a joint resolution providing that all the title still\r\nretained by the United States in the lands above the Raccoon Fork, in\r\nthe State of Iowa, \"which have been certified to said State improperly\r\nby the Department of the Interior as part of the grant by act of\r\nCongress approved August 8, 1846, and which is now held by _bona\r\nfide_ purchasers under the State of Iowa, be, and the same is hereby,\r\nrelinquished to the State of Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, and on the 12th day of July, 1862, an act of Congress was\r\npassed extending the grant of 1846 so as to include lands lying above\r\nthe Raccoon Fork.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution and act of Congress here mentioned have been\r\nrepeatedly held by the Supreme Court of the United States to supply a\r\ntitle to the lands mentioned in the deed from the State of Iowa to the\r\nNavigation and Railroad Company, which inured to the benefit of said\r\ncompany or its grantees.\r\n\r\nNo less than ten cases have been decided in that court more or less\r\ndirectly establishing this proposition, as well as the further\r\nproposition that no title to these lands could prior to said\r\nCongressional action be gained by settlers, for the reason that it had\r\nbeen withdrawn and reserved from entry and sale under the general land\r\nlaws. It seems to be perfectly well settled also, if an adjudication was\r\nnecessary upon that question, that all interest of the United States in\r\nthese lands was entirely and completely granted by the resolution of\r\n1861 and the act of 1862.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1862 provides for the setting apart of other lands in lieu of\r\nsuch as were covered by the act, but had been before its passage sold\r\nand disposed of by the United States, excepting such as had been\r\nreleased to the State of Iowa under the joint resolution of 1861.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed, I believe, that in a settlement of land grants thereafter\r\nhad between the United States and the State of Iowa lands were allowed\r\nto the State in lieu or indemnity for some of the lands which it had\r\nconveyed to the Des Moines Navigation and Railroad Company. But if the\r\ntitle of the company is valid to lands along the river and above the\r\nRaccoon Fork, under the deed from Iowa and the joint resolution and act\r\nof Congress, it can not be in the least affected by the fact that the\r\nState afterwards, justly or unjustly, received other lands as indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe bill under consideration provides that all the lands \"improperly\r\ncertified to Iowa\" under the grant of 1846, as referred to in the joint\r\nresolution of 1861, and for which indemnity lands were selected and\r\nreceived by the State, as provided in the act of 1862, \"are, and are\r\nhereby, declared to be public lands of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe claims of persons and their heirs who, with intent in good faith to\r\nobtain title under the preemption and homestead laws of the United\r\nStates, have entered and remained upon any tract of said land prior to\r\n1880 are confirmed and made valid to them and their heirs, not exceeding\r\n160 acres; and upon due proof and payment of the usual price or fees it\r\nis directed that such claims shall be carried to patent.\r\n\r\nIt is further provided that the claims of settlers and claimants which\r\ndo not come in conflict with the claims of the parties above mentioned\r\nare confirmed and made valid. By the second section of the bill it is\r\nmade the duty of the Attorney-General, as soon as practicable, and\r\nwithin three years after the passage of the act, to institute legal\r\nproceedings to assert and protect the title of the United States to said\r\nlands and to remove all clouds from its title thereto.\r\n\r\nOne result of this legislation, if consummated and if effectual, would\r\nbe to restore to the United States, as a part of the public domain,\r\nlands which more than twenty-five years ago the Government expressly\r\ngranted and surrendered, and which repeated decisions of the Supreme\r\nCourt have adjudged to belong by virtue of this action of the Government\r\nto other parties.\r\n\r\nAnother result would be not only to validate claims to this land which\r\nour highest judicial tribunal have solemnly declared to be invalid, but\r\nto actually direct the issue of patents in confirmation of said claims.\r\n\r\nStill another result would be to oblige the Government of the United\r\nStates to enter the courts ostensibly to assert and protect its title to\r\nsaid land, while in point of fact it would be used to enforce private\r\nclaims to the same and unsettle private ownership.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means certain that this proposed legislation, relating to a\r\nsubject peculiarly within the judicial function, and which attempts to\r\ndisturb rights and interests thoroughly intrenched in the solemn\r\nadjudications of our courts, would be upheld. In any event, it seems to\r\nme that it is an improper exercise of legislative power, an interference\r\nwith the determinations of a coordinate branch of the Government, an\r\narbitrary annulment of a public grant made more than twenty-five years\r\nago, an attempted destruction of vested rights, and a threatened\r\nimpairment of lawful contracts.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of this measure insist that a point in favor of the\r\nsettlers upon these lands and important in the consideration of this\r\nbill is found in the following language of the constitution of the State\r\nof Iowa, which was adopted in 1857:\r\n\r\n  The general assembly shall not locate any of the public lands which have\r\n  been or may be granted by Congress to this State, and the location of\r\n  which may be given to the general assembly, upon lands actually settled,\r\n  without the consent of the occupant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State under its constitution was perfectly competent to take the\r\ngrants of 1861 and 1862. The clause of the constitution above quoted\r\ndeals expressly with \"lands which have been or may be granted by\r\nCongress to the State,\" and thus of necessity recognizes its right to\r\ntake such grants. This competency in the State as a grantee was all that\r\nwas needed to create, under the joint resolution of 1861 and the act of\r\n1862, a complete divestiture of the interests of the United States in\r\nthese lands. It must be borne in mind, too, that prior to this time\r\nthese lands had been conveyed by the State of Iowa in furtherance of the\r\npurposes of the original Congressional grants, and that the joint\r\nresolution of 1861 and the act of 1862 were really made for the benefit\r\nof those who held under grants from the State. After these grants by the\r\nGovernment it had no concern with these lands. If in any stage of the\r\nproceedings the general assembly of Iowa was guilty of any neglect of\r\nduty or failed to act in accordance with the constitution of the State\r\nof Iowa, the remedy should be found in the courts of that State; and it\r\nis difficult to see how the situation in this aspect can be changed or\r\nimproved by the bill under consideration.\r\n\r\nI am not unmindful of the fact that there may be persons who have\r\nsuffered or who are threatened with loss through a reliance upon the\r\nerroneous decisions of Government officials as to the extent of the\r\noriginal grant from the United States to the Territory of Iowa. I\r\nbelieve cases of this kind should be treated in accordance with the\r\nbroadest sentiments of equity, and that where loss is apparent arising\r\nfrom a real or fairly supposed invitation of the Government to settle\r\nupon the lands mentioned in the bill under consideration such loss\r\nshould be made good. But I do not believe that the condition of these\r\nsettlers will be aided by encouraging them in such further litigation as\r\nthe terms of this bill invite, nor do I believe that in attempting to\r\nright the wrongs of which they complain legislation should be sanctioned\r\nmischievous in principle, and in its practical operation doing injustice\r\nto others as innocent as they and as much entitled to consideration.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See pp. 411-413.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 220, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to John J. Lockrey.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated that this beneficiary enlisted April 11, 1865, but it\r\nappears from the muster roll of his company for May and June, 1865, that\r\nhe was a recruit assigned, but who had not joined. There is nothing\r\nappearing on the record which positively shows that he ever reached his\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that his real and nominal connection with the Army\r\nextended only from April 11, 1865, when he was mustered in, until\r\nAugust, 1865, when he was discharged for disability, consisting of a\r\ndisease of the eye, called in the surgeon's certificate \"iritis with\r\nconjunctivitis.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that this claimant enlisted just at the close of the war, and\r\nwas connected in a manner with the Army for four months. It is not\r\nprobable that he ever saw any actual service, for none is stated in the\r\npapers before me; and it does appear that he spent a large part of his\r\nshort term of enlistment in hospitals and under treatment for a trouble\r\nwith his eye. As early as May 23, 1865, he was admitted to hospital with\r\ngonorrheal ophthalmia. His claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau on\r\nthe ground that this was the cause of his disability, and the inferences\r\nfrom the proof presented make this extremely probable.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses who testified that the beneficiary caught cold in\r\nhis eye in April, 1865, on the Mississippi River is shown to have been\r\nat that time with his regiment and company at Danville, Va.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances surrounding this case and the facts proved satisfy me\r\nthat the determination of the Pension Bureau was correct, and there is\r\ncertainly no sentiment in favor of the claimant which justifies the\r\nindulgence of violent presumptions for the purpose of overriding such\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 5807, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to John McCool.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary served in an Iowa regiment of volunteers from May 27,\r\n1861, to July 12, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe filed a petition for pension, alleging an accidental wound in the\r\nright thumb while extracting a cartridge from a pistol in August, 1861.\r\nThere is no record of any such disability, though it appears that he was\r\non a furlough about the date of his alleged injury. It appears that he\r\nserved nearly four years after the time he fixed as the date of his\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nNo evidence was filed in support of the claim he filed, and he refused\r\nto appear for examination, though twice notified to do so.\r\n\r\nHis claim was rejected in May, 1888, no suggestion having been made of\r\nany other disability than the wound in the thumb, upon which his claim\r\nbefore the Bureau was based.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee in the House of Representatives recommending\r\nthe passage of this bill contains no intimation that there exists any\r\ndisability contracted in the military service, but distinctly declares\r\nthe pension recommended a service pension, and states that the\r\nbeneficiary is blind.\r\n\r\nAs long as the policy of granting pensions for disability traceable to\r\nthe incidents of army service is adhered to, the allowance of pensions\r\nby special acts based upon service only gives rise to unjust and unfair\r\ndiscriminations among those equally entitled, and makes precedents which\r\nwill eventually result in an entire departure from the principle upon\r\nwhich pensions are now awarded.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 11803, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Henry V.

There appears to be no evidence in\r\nhis record of any disability or medical treatment while in the service,\r\nand the medical examination upon his application for pension shows no\r\nrating for any disability other than that alleged by him and for which\r\nhe was pensioned--disease of the ears and resulting deafness.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that the soldier died January 16, 1886, of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe widow filed a claim for pension in May, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of physicians upon her claim covered seven years prior\r\nto his death, thus dating back to the year 1879, and they speak of\r\nthe disease of the ear and of the kidneys, which, in their opinion,\r\nundermined his health, so that \"he succumbed to an attack of pneumonia,\r\nwhich to a person of ordinary good health would not have been considered\r\nserious.\"\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that the trouble with his ears caused the\r\nsoldier to fall a victim to pneumonia; and so far as the kidney disease\r\ntended in that direction, it is to be observed that it apparently did\r\nnot make its appearance until fourteen years after the soldier's\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 26, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 11586, entitled \"An act for the\r\nrelief of Stephen Williams.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from the records that the beneficiary for whom a pension is\r\nprovided in this bill served as a volunteer in an Illinois regiment from\r\nOctober, 1862, to October; 1864, at which date he is reported as a\r\ndeserter.\r\n\r\nHe filed a claim for pension in 1881, in which he alleged that he was\r\nstruck with a gunstock upon his head and injured in October, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows that a drunken comrade struck the claimant with the\r\nstock of his gun because he would not buy whisky for him.\r\n\r\nThis, upon all the facts, does not appear to be a proper case for\r\nallowing a pension for an injury suffered in the line of military duty.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 2, 1889_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 139, entitled \"An act\r\nto credit and pay to the several States and Territories and the District\r\nof Columbia all moneys collected under the direct tax levied by the act\r\nof Congress approved August 5, 1861.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this bill is quite clearly indicated in its title. Its\r\nprovisions have been much discussed in both branches of Congress and\r\nhave received emphatic legislative sanction. I fully appreciate the\r\ninterest which it has excited and have by no means failed to recognize\r\nthe persuasive presentation made in its favor. I know, too, that the\r\ninterposition of Executive disapproval in this case is likely to arouse\r\nirritation and cause complaint and earnest criticism. Since, however, my\r\njudgment will not permit me to assent to the legislation proposed, I can\r\nfind no way of turning aside from what appears to be the plain course of\r\nofficial duty.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th day of August, 1861, a Federal statute was passed entitled\r\n\"An act to provide increased revenue from imports, to pay interest on\r\nthe public debt, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThis law was passed at a time when immense sums of money were needed\r\nby the Government for the prosecution of a war for the Union, and the\r\npurpose of the law was to increase in almost every possible way the\r\nFederal revenues. The first seven sections of the statute were devoted\r\nto advancing very largely the rates of duties on imports, and to\r\nsupplement this the eighth section provided that a direct tax of\r\n$20,000,000 should be annually laid and that certain amounts therein\r\nspecified should be apportioned to the respective States. The remainder\r\nof the law, consisting of fifty sections, contained the most particular\r\nand detailed provisions for the collection of the tax through Federal\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nIt was declared, among other things, that the tax should be assessed\r\nand laid on all lands and lots of ground, with their improvements and\r\ndwelling houses; that the annual amount of said taxes should be a lien\r\nupon all lands and real estate of the individuals assessed for the same,\r\nand that in default of payment the said taxes might be collected by\r\ndistraint and sale of the goods, chattels, and effects of the delinquent\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThis tax was laid in execution of the power conferred upon the General\r\nGovernment for that purpose by the Constitution. It was an exercise\r\nof the right of the Government to tax its citizens. It dealt with\r\nindividuals, and the strong arm of Federal power was stretched out to\r\nexact from those who owed it support and allegiance their just share\r\nof the sum it had decreed should be raised by direct taxation for the\r\ngeneral good. The lien created by this tax was upon the land and real\r\nestate of the \"individuals\" assessed for the same, and for its\r\ncollection the distraint and sale of personal property of the \"persons\r\ndelinquent\" were permitted.\r\n\r\nBut while the direct relationship and responsibility between the\r\nindividuals taxed and the Federal Government were thus created by the\r\nexercise of the highest attribute of sovereignty, it was provided in the\r\nstatute that any State or Territory and the District of Columbia might\r\nlawfully \"assume, assess, collect, and pay into the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States\" its quota of said tax in its own way and manner and by\r\nand through its own officers, assessors, and collectors; and it was\r\nfurther provided that such States or Territories as should give notice\r\nof their intention to thus assume and pay or to assess, collect, and pay\r\ninto the Treasury of the United States such direct tax, should be\r\nentitled, in lieu of the compensation, pay, per diem, and percentage in\r\nsaid act prescribed and allowed to assessors, assistant assessors, and\r\ncollectors of the United States, to a deduction of 15 per cent of the\r\nquota of direct tax apportioned to such States or Territories and levied\r\nand collected through their officers.\r\n\r\nIt was also provided by this law and another passed the next year that\r\ncertain claims of the States and Territories against the United States\r\nmight be applied in payment of such quotas. Whatever may be said as to\r\nthe effect of these provisions of the law, it can hardly be claimed that\r\nby virtue thereof or any proceedings under them the apportioned quotas\r\nof this tax became debts against the several States and Territories, or\r\nthat they were liable to the General Government therefor in every event,\r\nand as principal debtors bound by an enforceable obligation.\r\n\r\nIn the forty-sixth section of the law it is provided that in case any\r\nState, Territory, or the District of Columbia, after notice given of its\r\nintention to assume and pay or to levy, collect, and pay said direct tax\r\napportioned to it, should fail to pay the amount of said direct tax, or\r\nany part thereof, it should be lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto appoint United States officers as in the act provided, whose duty it\r\nshould be to proceed forthwith to collect all or any part of said direct\r\ntax \"the same as though said State, Territory, or District had not given\r\nnotice nor assumed to levy, collect, and pay said taxes or any part\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nA majority of the States undertook the collection of their quotas and\r\naccounted for the amount thereof to the General Government by the\r\npayment of money or by setting off claims in their favor against the\r\ntax. Fifteen per cent of the amount of their respective quotas was\r\nretained as the allowance for collection and payment. In the Northern,\r\nor such as were then called the loyal States, nearly the entire quotas\r\nwere collected and paid through State agencies. The money necessary for\r\nthis purpose was generally collected from the citizens of the States\r\nwith their other taxes, and in whatever manner their quotas may have\r\nbeen canceled, whether by the payment of money or setting off claims\r\nagainst the Government, it is safe to say, as a general proposition,\r\nthat the people of these States have individually been obliged to pay\r\nthe assessments made upon them on account of this direct tax and have\r\nintrusted it to their several States to be transmitted to the Federal\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States, then in insurrection, whatever was actually\r\nrealized in money upon this tax was collected directly by Federal\r\nofficers without the interposition of State machinery, and a part of its\r\nquota has been credited to each of these States.\r\n\r\nThe entire amount applied upon this tax, including the 15 per cent for\r\ncollection, was credited to the several States and Territories upon the\r\nbooks of the Treasury, whether collected through their instrumentalities\r\nor by Federal officers.\r\n\r\nThe sum credited to all the States was $17,359,685.51, which includes\r\nmore than $2,000,000 on account of the 15 per cent allowed for\r\ncollecting. Of the amount credited only about $2,300.000 is credited to\r\nthe insurrectionary States. The amount uncollected of the twenty\r\nmillions directed to be raised by this tax was $2,646,314.49, and nearly\r\nthis entire sum remained due upon the quotas apportioned to these\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs the bill under consideration directs the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury \"to credit to each State and Territory\r\nof the United States and the District of Columbia a sum equal to\r\nall collections, by set-off or otherwise, made from said States and\r\nTerritories and the District of Columbia, or from any of the citizens\r\nor inhabitants thereof, or other persons, under the act of Congress\r\napproved August 5, 1861, and the amendatory acts thereto.\" An\r\nappropriation is also made of such a sum as may be necessary to\r\nreimburse each State, Territory, and the District of Columbia for all\r\nmoney found due to it under the provisions of the bill, and it is\r\nprovided that all money still due to the United States on said direct\r\ntax shall be remitted and relinquished.\r\n\r\nThe conceded effect of this bill is to take from the money now in the\r\nTreasury the sum of more than $17,000,000, or, if the percentage allowed\r\nis not included, more than $15,000,000, and pay back to the respective\r\nStates and Territories the sums they or their citizens paid more than\r\ntwenty-five years ago upon a direct tax levied by the Government of the\r\nUnited States for its defense and safety.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that this appropriation of the public funds is not\r\nwithin the constitutional power of the Congress. Under the limited and\r\ndelegated authority conferred by the Constitution upon the General\r\nGovernment the statement of the purposes for which money may be lawfully\r\nraised by taxation in any form declares also the limit of the objects\r\nfor which it may be expended.\r\n\r\nAll must agree that the direct tax was lawfully and constitutionally\r\nlaid and that it was rightfully and correctly collected. It can not be\r\nclaimed, therefore, nor is it pretended, that any debt arose against the\r\nGovernment and in favor of any State or individual by the exaction of\r\nthis tax. Surely, then, the appropriation directed by this bill can not\r\nbe justified as a payment of a debt of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe disbursement of this money clearly has no relation to the common\r\ndefense. On the contrary, it is the repayment of money raised and long\r\nago expended by the Government to provide for the common defense.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure can not properly be advocated on the ground that the\r\ngeneral welfare of the United States is thereby provided for or\r\npromoted. This \"general welfare of the United States,\" as used in the\r\nConstitution, can only justify appropriations for national objects and\r\nfor purposes which have to do with the prosperity, the growth, the\r\nhonor, or the peace and dignity of the nation.\r\n\r\nA sheer, bald gratuity bestowed either upon States or individuals,\r\nbased upon no better reason than supports the gift proposed in this\r\nbill, has never been claimed to be a provision for the general welfare.\r\nMore than fifty years ago a surplus of public money in the Treasury was\r\ndistributed among the States; but the unconstitutionality of such\r\ndistribution, considered as a gift of money, appears to have been\r\nconceded, for it was put into the State treasuries under the guise of\r\na deposit or loan, subject to the demand of the Government.\r\n\r\nIf it was proposed to raise by assessment upon the people the sum\r\nnecessary to refund the money collected upon this direct tax, I am\r\nsure many who are now silent would insist upon the limitations of the\r\nConstitution in opposition to such a scheme. A large surplus in the\r\nTreasury is the parent of many ills, and among them is found a tendency\r\nto an extremely liberal, if not loose, construction of the Constitution.\r\nIt also attracts the gaze of States and individuals with a kind of\r\nfascination, and gives rise to plans and pretensions that an uncongested\r\nTreasury never could excite.\r\n\r\nBut if the constitutional question involved in the consideration of this\r\nbill should be determined in its favor, there are other objections\r\nremaining which prevent my assent to its provisions.\r\n\r\nThere should be a certainty and stability about the enforcement of\r\ntaxation which should teach the citizen that the Government will only\r\nuse the power to tax in cases where its necessity and justice are not\r\ndoubtful, and which should also discourage the disturbing idea that the\r\nexercise of this power may be revoked by reimbursement of taxes once\r\ncollected. Any other theory cheapens and in a measure discredits a\r\nprocess which more than any other is a manifestation of sovereign\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nA government is not only kind, but performs its highest duty when it\r\nrestores to the citizen taxes unlawfully collected or which have been\r\nerroneously or oppressively extorted by its agents or officers; but\r\naside from these incidents, the people should not be familiarized with\r\nthe spectacle of their Government repenting the collection of taxes and\r\nrestoring them.\r\n\r\nThe direct tax levied in 1861 is not even suspected of invalidity. There\r\nnever was a tax levied which was more needed, and its justice can not be\r\nquestioned. Why, then, should it be returned?\r\n\r\nThe fact that the entire tax was not paid furnishes no reason that would\r\nnot apply to nearly every case where taxes are laid. There are always\r\ndelinquents, and while the more thorough and complete collection of\r\ntaxes is a troublesome problem of government, the failure to solve the\r\nproblem has never been held to call for the return of taxes actually\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency in the collection of this tax is found almost entirely in\r\nthe insurrectionary States, while the quotas apportioned to the other\r\nStates were, as a general rule, fully paid; and three-fourths or\r\nfour-fifths of the money which it is proposed in this bill to return\r\nwould be paid into the treasuries of the loyal states. But no valid\r\nreason for such payment is found in the fact that the Government at\r\nfirst could not, and afterwards, for reasons probably perfectly valid,\r\ndid not, enforce collection in the other States.\r\n\r\nThere were many Federal taxes which were not paid by the people in the\r\nrebellious States; and if the nonpayment by them of this direct tax\r\nentitles the other States to a donation of the share of said taxes paid\r\nby their citizens, why should not the income tax and many other internal\r\ntaxes paid entirely by the citizens of loyal States be also paid into\r\nthe treasuries of these States? Considerations which recognize sectional\r\ndivisions or the loyalty of the different States at the time this tax\r\nwas laid should not enter into the discussion of the merits of this\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe loyal States should not be paid the large sums of money promised\r\nthem by this bill because they were loyal and other States were not,\r\nnor should the States which rebelled against the Government be paid\r\nthe smaller sum promised them because they were in rebellion and thus\r\nprevented the collection of their entire quotas, nor because this\r\nconcession to them is necessary to justify the proposed larger gifts\r\nto the other States.\r\n\r\nThe people of the loyal States paid this direct tax as they bore other\r\nburdens in support of the Government, and I believe the taxpayers\r\nthemselves are content. In the light of these considerations I am\r\nopposed to the payment of money from the Federal Treasury to enrich the\r\ntreasuries of the States. Their funds should be furnished by their own\r\ncitizens, and thus should be fostered the taxpayer's watchfulness of\r\nState expenditures and the taxpayer's jealous insistence upon the strict\r\naccountability of State officials. These elements of purity and strength\r\nin a State are not safely exchanged for the threatened demoralization\r\nand carelessness attending the custody and management of large gifts\r\nfrom the Federal Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe baneful effect of a surplus in the Treasury of the General\r\nGovernment is daily seen and felt. I do not think, however, that this\r\nsurplus should be reduced or its contagion spread throughout the States\r\nby methods such as are provided in this bill.\r\n\r\nThere is still another objection to the bill, arising from what seems to\r\nme its unfairness and unjust discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn the case of proposed legislation of at least doubtful\r\nconstitutionality, and based upon no legal right, the equities which\r\nrecommend it should always be definite and clear.\r\n\r\nThe money appropriated by this bill is to be paid to the governors of\r\nthe respective States and Territories in which it was collected, whether\r\nthe same was derived through said States and Territories, or directly\r\n\"from any of the citizens or inhabitants thereof or other persons;\" and\r\nit is further provided that such sums as were collected in payment of\r\nthis Federal tax through the instrumentality of the State or Territorial\r\nofficials, and accounted for to the General Government by such States\r\nand Territories, are to be paid unconditionally to their governors,\r\nwhile the same collected in payment of said tax by the United States,\r\nor, in other words, by the Federal machinery created for that purpose,\r\nare to be held in trust by said States or Territories for the benefit of\r\nthose paying the same.\r\n\r\nI am unable to understand how this discrimination in favor of those who\r\nhave made payment of this tax directly to the officers of the Federal\r\nGovernment, and against those who made such payments through State\r\nor Territorial agencies, can be defended upon fair and equitable\r\nprinciples. It was the General Government in every case which exacted\r\nthis tax from its citizens and people in the different States and\r\nTerritories, and to provide for reimbursement to a part of its citizens\r\nby the creation of a trust for their benefit, while the money exacted in\r\npayment of this tax from a far greater number is paid unconditionally\r\ninto the State and Territorial treasuries, is an unjust and unfair\r\nproceeding, in which the Government should not be implicated.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly do to say that the States and Territories who are the\r\nrecipients of these large gifts may be trusted to do justice to its\r\ncitizens who originally paid the money. This can not be relied upon; nor\r\nshould the Government lose sight of the equality of which it boasts,\r\nand, having entered upon the plan of reimbursement, abandon to other\r\nagencies the duty of just distribution, and thus incur the risk of\r\nbecoming accessory to actual inequality and injustice.\r\n\r\nIf in defense of the plan proposed it is claimed that exact equality can\r\nnot be reached in the premises, this may be readily conceded. The money\r\nraised by this direct tax was collected and expended twenty-seven years\r\nago. Nearly a generation has passed away since that time. Even if\r\ndistribution should be attempted by the States and Territories, as well\r\nas by the Government, the taxpayers in many cases are neither alive nor\r\nrepresented, and in many other cases if alive they can not be found.\r\nFraudulent claims would often outrun honest applications and innumerable\r\nand bitter contests would arise between claimants.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty in the way of doing perfect justice in the operation\r\nof this plan of reimbursement is found in the fact that the money to\r\nbe appropriated therefor was contributed to the Federal Treasury for\r\nentirely different purposes by a generation many of whom were not born\r\nwhen the direct tax was levied and paid, who have no relation to said\r\ntax and can not share in its distribution. While they stand by and\r\nsee the money they have been obliged to pay into the public Treasury\r\nprofessedly to meet present necessities expended to reimburse taxation\r\nlong ago fairly, legally, and justly collected from others, they can not\r\nfail to see the unfairness of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a surplus in the Treasury is no answer to these\r\nobjections. It is still the people's money, and better use can be found\r\nfor it than the distribution of it upon the plea of the reimbursement\r\nof ancient taxation. A more desirable plan to reduce and prevent the\r\nrecurrence of a large surplus can easily be adopted--one that, instead\r\nof creating injustice and inequality, promotes justice and equality by\r\nleaving in the hands of the people and for their use the money not\r\nneeded by the Government \"to pay the debts and provide for the common\r\ndefense and general welfare of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of making a just reimbursement of this\r\nDirect tax, instead of excusing the imperfections of the bill under\r\nconsideration, furnish reasons why the scheme it proposes should not be\r\nentered upon.\r\n\r\nI am constrained, upon the considerations herein presented, to withhold\r\nmy assent from the bill herewith returned, because I believe it to be\r\nwithout constitutional warrant, because I am of the opinion that there\r\nexists no adequate reasons either in right or equity for the return of\r\nthe tax in said bill mentioned, and because I believe its execution\r\nwould cause actual injustice and unfairness.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas public interests require that the Senate should be convened at\r\n12 o'clock on the 4th day of March next to receive such communications\r\nas may be made by the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim and declare that an extraordinary occasion requires the\r\nSenate of the United States to convene at the Capitol, in the city of\r\nWashington, on the 4th day of March next, at 12 o'clock noon, of which\r\nall persons who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that\r\nbody are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 26th day of February, A.D. 1889, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States of America the one hundred and thirteenth.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  T.F.
