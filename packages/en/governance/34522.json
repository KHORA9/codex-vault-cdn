But\r\nyou went bicycling, and your mothers were very shocked at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think that you can say that, Miss Lisle,\" remarked another of\r\nthe matrons, \"because I can remember that more than twenty years ago one\r\nused to see quite elderly ladies bicycling.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the others had lived all the ridicule down,\" retorted Miss Lisle\r\nscornfully. \"Oh yes; I quite expect that in a few more years you will\r\nsee quite elderly ladies flying.\"\r\n\r\nThe little party of matrons seated on the Hastings promenade regarded\r\neach other surreptitiously, and one or two smiled slightly, while one or\r\ntwo shuddered slightly. \"Flying is very different, dear,\" said Mrs Lisle\r\nreprovingly. \"I often think of what your dear grandfather used to say.\r\nHe said\"--impressively--\"that if the Almighty had intended that we\r\nshould fly, He would have sent us into the world with wings upon our\r\nbacks.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of approval from all--all except Miss Lisle, that is.\r\n\r\n\"But do you ever think of what Geoffrey replied to dear grandpapa when\r\nhe heard him say that once, mother?\" said the unimpressed daughter. \"He\r\nsaid: 'And don't you think, sir, that if the Almighty had intended us to\r\nuse railways, He would have sent us into the world with wheels upon our\r\nfeet?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see any connection at all between the two things,\" replied her\r\nmother distantly. \"And such a remark seems to me to be simply\r\nirreverent. Birds are born with wings, and insects, and so on, but\r\nnothing, as far as I am aware, is born with wheels. Your grandfather\r\nused to travel by the South Eastern regularly every day, or how could he\r\nhave reached his office? and he never saw anything wrong in using\r\ntrains, I am sure. In fact, when you think of it you will see that what\r\nGeoffrey said, instead of being any argument, was supremely silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he intended it to be,\" replied Miss Lisle with suspicious\r\nmeekness. \"You never know, mother.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a remark merited no serious attention. Why should any one, least of\r\nall a really clever young man like Geoffrey, deliberately _intend_ to be\r\nsilly? There was too often, her mother had observed, an utter lack of\r\nrelevance in Irene's remarks.\r\n\r\n\"I think that it is a great mistake to have white flying costumes as so\r\nmany do,\" observed another lady. \"They look--but perhaps they wish to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly when they use lace as well it really seems as though they do.\r\nOh!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a passing shadow across the group and a slight rustle in the\r\nair. Scarcely a dozen yards above the promenade a young lady was flying\r\nstrongly down the wind with the languid motion of the \"swan stroke.\" She\r\nwore white--and lace trimming. Mrs Lisle gazed fixedly out to sea. Even\r\nIrene felt that the vision was inopportune.\r\n\r\n\"There are always some who overdo a thing,\" she remarked. \"There always\r\nhave been. That was only Velma St Saint of the New Gaiety; she flies\r\nabout the front every day for the advertisement of the thing: I wonder\r\nthat she doesn't drop handbills as she goes. There's plenty of room up\r\non the Castle Hill--in fact, you aren't supposed to fly west of the\r\nBreakwater--but there will always be some----\" A vague resentment closed\r\nthe period.\r\n\r\n\"Are you staying at the Palatial this time?\" asked the lady who had\r\nmentioned lace, feeling it tactful to change the subject. \"I think that\r\nyou used to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, haven't you seen?\" was the reply. \"The Palatial has been closed for\r\nthe last six months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a great pity,\" remarked another. \"It looks so depressing too,\r\nright on the front. But they simply could not go on. I suppose that the\r\nrates here are something frightful now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, enormous, my dear; but it was not that alone. The Palatial has\r\nalways aimed at being a 'popular' hotel, and so few of the upper middle\r\nclass can afford hotels now. Then the new tax on every servant above\r\none--calculated as fifty per cent. of their wages, I think, but there\r\nare so many new taxes to remember--proved the last straw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is fifty per cent. I remember because I had to give up my\r\nbetween-maid to pay the cook's tax. But I thought that hotels were to be\r\nexempt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the end. It was argued that hotels existed for the convenience\r\nof the monied classes, and that they ought to pay for it. So a large\r\nnumber of hotels are closed altogether; others work with a reduced\r\nstaff, and a great many servants have been thrown out of employment.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle laughed unpleasantly. \"A good thing, too,\" she remarked. \"I\r\nhate hotel servants. So does everybody. It is the only good thing I have\r\nheard of the Labour Government doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I don't hate them,\" said Mrs Lisle, looking round with\r\npathetic resignation, \"although they certainly had become rather\r\ngrasping and over-bearing of late. But it was quite an unforeseen\r\ndevelopment of the scheme that so many should lose their places. Indeed\r\nthe special object of the tax was to create a fund--'earmarked' I think\r\nthey call it--out of which to meet the growing pension claim, now that\r\nso few of the servant class think it worth while to save.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle laughed again, this time with a note of genuine amusement.\r\n\r\n(\"A most unpleasant girl, I fear,\" murmured the lady who had raised the\r\nwhite costume question, to her neighbour in a whisper: \"so odd.\")\r\n\r\n\"It made a great difference at the registry offices. There are a dozen\r\nmaids to be had any day where there were really none before. Only one\r\ncannot afford to keep them now.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a word, a sigh, and an \"Ah!\" to mark this point of agreement\r\namong the four ladies.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that the Government confiscation of all dividends above\r\nfive per cent. bears very heavily on some,\" remarked one after a pause.\r\n\"I know a poor soul of over sixty-five, nearly blind too, whose husband\r\nhad invested all his savings in the company he had worked for because he\r\nknew that it was safe, and, having a good reserve, intended to pay ten\r\nper cent. for a long time. When he died it brought her in fifty pounds a\r\nyear. Now----\"\r\n\r\nThere were little signs of sympathy and commiseration from the group.\r\nThe sex was beginning to take an unwonted interest in terms\r\nfinancial--per centage, surrender value, trustee stock, unearned\r\nincrement, and so on. They had reason to do so, for revolutionary\r\nfinance was very much in the air, or, rather, had come tangibly down to\r\nearth at length: not the placid city echoes that were wont to ripple\r\ngently across the breakfast-table a few years earlier without leaving\r\nany one much better or much worse off, but the galvanic adjustment that\r\nby a stroke made the rich well-to-do, the well-to-do just so-so, the\r\nstruggling poor, and left the poor where they were before. The frenzied\r\neffort that in a session strove to tear up the trees of the forest and\r\nleave the plants beneath untouched; to pull to pieces the intertwined\r\nfabric of a thousand years' growth and to create from it a bundle of\r\nstraight and equal twigs; in a word, to administer justice on the\r\nprinciple of knocking out one eye in all the sound because a number of\r\npeople were unfortunately born or fallen blind.\r\n\r\n\"Five and twenty,\" mused Mrs Lisle. \"I suppose it is just possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is really less than that,\" explained the other. \"You may have\r\nnoticed that as it is now no good making more than five per cent., most\r\ncompanies pay even less. There is no incentive to do well.\"\r\n\r\n\"One hears of even worse cases on every hand,\" said another of the\r\nladies. \"I am trying to interest people in a poor deformed creature\r\nwhose father left her an annuity derived from ground rents in the\r\nCity.... As it has been worked out I think that she owes the Incomes\r\nAdjustment Department lawyers something a year now. But private charity\r\nseems almost to have ceased altogether. Have you heard that 'Jim's' is\r\nclosed?\"\r\n\r\nIt was true. St James's Hospital, whose unvarnished record was, \"Three\r\nhundred of the very poor treated freely each day,\" was a thing of the\r\npast, and across its portal, where ten years before a couple of stalwart\r\ngentlemen wearing red ties had rested for a moment, while they lit their\r\npipes, a banner with the strange device, \"Curse your Charity!\" now ran\r\nthe legend, \"Closed for want of Funds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder sometimes,\" mused the last speaker, \"why some one doesn't do\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected another, \"what is there to do? What is there?\"\r\n\r\nThey all agreed that there was nothing--absolutely nothing. Every one\r\nelse was tacitly making the same admission; that was the fatal symptom.\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle jumped up and began to move away unceremoniously.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, dear?\" asked her mother in mild reproof.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, anywhere,\" replied Irene restlessly.\r\n\r\n\"But what for?\" persisted Mrs Lisle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is 'nothing,' Miss Lisle,\" smiled the tactful lady of the party,\r\nanxious to smooth over the awkwardness of the moment.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is at least something,\" flung back the girl brusquely; and with\r\nswinging strides she set off at a furious pace towards the open country.\r\n\r\n\"Irene is a little impulsive at times,\" apologized her mother, sitting\r\nback with placidly folded hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD, AND THE COMING OF WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn intelligent South Sea Islander, who had been imported into this\r\ncountry to stimulate missionary enterprise, on his return had said that\r\nthe most marked characteristic of the English of the period was what\r\nthey called \"snap.\"\r\n\r\nThe nearest equivalent in his own language signifying literally \"quick\r\nhot words,\" he had some difficulty in conveying the impression he\r\ndesired, and his circle had to rest content that \"snap\" permeated the\r\njournalism, commerce, politics, drama, and social life of the English,\r\nhad assailed their literature, and was beginning to influence religion,\r\nart, and science. It may be admitted that the foreign gentleman's visit\r\nhad coincided with a period of national stress, for the week in question\r\nhad embraced the more entertaining half of a general election, seen the\r\nadvent of two new farthing daily papers, and been marked by the Rev.\r\nSebastian Tauthaul's striking series of addresses from the pulpit of the\r\nCity Sanctum, entitled \"If Christ put up for Battersea.\" It had also\r\nincluded the launching of a new cocoa, a new soap, and a new\r\nconcentrated food.\r\n\r\nThe new food was called \"Chip-Chunks.\" \"A name which I venture to think\r\nspells success of itself,\" complacently remarked its inventor. \"A very\r\ngood name indeed,\" admitted his advertising manager. \"It has the great\r\ndesideratum that it might be anything, and, on the other hand, it might\r\nequally well be nothing.\" \"Just so,\" said the inventor with weighty\r\napproval; \"just so.\" A \"snap-line\" was required that would ineradicably\r\nfix Chip-Chunks in the public mind, and \"Bow-wow! Feel chippy? Then\r\nchamp Chip-Chunks\" was found in an inspired moment. It was, of course,\r\nfully cooked and already quite digested. It was described as the delight\r\nof the unweaned infant, the mainstay of the toothless nonagenarian, and\r\nso simple and wholesome that it could be safely taken and at once\r\nassimilated by the invalid who had undergone the operation of having his\r\nprincipal organ of digestion removed. So little, indeed, remained for\r\nnature and the human parts to do in the matter of Chip-Chunks as to\r\nraise the doubt whether it might not be simpler and scarcely less\r\nnutritive to open the tin and pour the contents down the drain\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nAs Chip-Chunks was designed for those who were disinclined to exercise\r\nthe functions of digestion, so Isabella soap made an appeal to those who\r\ndisliked work and had something of an antipathy to soap at all. One did\r\nnot wash with Isabella, it was assured: one sat down and watched it. It\r\nhad its \"snap-lines,\" too:\r\n\r\n\"You write it 'wash,' but you call it 'wosh.'\r\n\r\n\"What is the difference?\r\n\r\n\"There is 'a' difference.\r\n\r\n\"There is also 'a' difference between Isabella soap and all other soaps:\r\n\r\n\"All the difference.\r\n\r\n\"That's our point. Put it in your washtub and watch it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCocoa was approached in a more sober spirit. Soap may blow bubbles of\r\nlight and airy fancy, pills _ricochet_ from one gay conceit to another,\r\nmeat extracts gambol with the irresponsible exuberance of bulls in china\r\ncups, but cocoa relied upon sincerity and statistics. Kingcup cocoa was\r\nthe last word of the expert. It won its way into the great heart of the\r\npeople by driving home the significant fact that it contained .00001 per\r\ncent. more phosphorus, and .000002 per cent. less of something fatty,\r\nthan any other cocoa in existence. When the newspaper reader of the\r\nperiod had been confronted by this assertion, in various guises,\r\nseventeen thousand times, he had reached a state of mind in which .00001\r\nper cent. more phosphorus and .000002 per cent. less fat represented the\r\ndifference between vigorous manhood and drivelling imbecility.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Sebastian was all \"snap.\" His topical midday\r\naddresses--described by himself as \"Seven minutes\r\nsandwich-sermonettes\"--have already been referred to. Young men who were\r\npressed for time were bidden to bring their bath buns or buttered scones\r\nand eat openly and unashamed. Workmen with bread and cheese and pots of\r\nbeer were welcomed with effusion. This particular series extended over\r\nthe working days of a week, and was subdivided thus:\r\n\r\n    _Monday._--The Issues before the Constituency.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday._--His Address to the Electors.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday._--The Day of the Contest.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday._--Which Way are you Voting?\r\n\r\n    _Friday._--Spoiled Papers.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday._--At the Top of the Poll and the Leader of\r\n    our Party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the new papers, of their sprightliness, their enterprise, their\r\ngeneral all-roundness, their almost wicked experience of the ways of the\r\nworld, from a quite up-to-date fund of junior office witticism to a\r\nknowledge of the existence of actresses who do not act, outwardly\r\nrespectable circles of society who play cards for money on Sunday, and\r\n(exclusively for the benefit of their readers) places where quite\r\nhigh-class provisions (only nominally damaged) could be bought cheap on\r\nSaturday nights, it is unnecessary to say much. Of their irresponsible\r\ncock-sureness, their bristling combativeness, their amazing powers of\r\nprophetic penetration, and, it must be confessed, their ineradicable air\r\nof somewhat second-rate infant phenomenonship, their crumbling yellow\r\nfiles still bear witness. As a halfpenny is half a penny, so a farthing\r\nis half a halfpenny, and the mind that is not too appalled by the\r\npossibilities of the development can people for itself this journalistic\r\nEden.\r\n\r\n_The Whip_ described its programme as \"Vervy and nervy; brainy and\r\nchampagny.\" _The Broom_ relied more on solider attractions of the \"News\r\nof the World in Pin Point Pars\" and \"Knowledge in Nodules\" order. Both\r\nclaimed to be written exclusively by \"brainy\" people, and both might\r\nhave added, with equal truth, read exclusively by brainless. Avowedly\r\nappealing \"to the great intellect of the nation,\" neither fell into the\r\neasy mistake of aiming too high, and the humblest son of toil might take\r\nthem up with the fullest confidence of finding nothing from beginning to\r\nend that was beyond his simple comprehension.\r\n\r\nBut the most cursory review of national \"snappishness\" would be\r\nincomplete if it omitted the field of politics, especially when the\r\nperiod in question contained so concentrated an accumulation of \"snap\"\r\nas a general election. Contests had long ceased to be decided on the\r\nmerits of individuals or of parties, still less to be the occasions for\r\ndeliberate consideration of policy. Each group had its label and its\r\n\"snap-cries.\" The outcome as a whole--the decision of each division with\r\nfew exceptions--lay in the hands of a class which, while educated to the\r\nextent of a little reading and a little writing, was practically\r\nilliterate in thought, in experience, and in discrimination. To them a\r\n\"snap-cry\" was eminently suited, as representing a concrete idea and\r\nbeing in fact the next best argument to a decayed egg. That national\r\ndisaster had never so far been evolved out of this rough-and-ready\r\nmethod could be traced to a variety of saving clauses. At such a time\r\nthe strict veracity of the cries raised was not to be too closely\r\nexamined; indeed, there was not the time for contradiction, and therein\r\nlay the essence of some of the most successful \"snaps.\"\r\n\r\nMisrepresentation, if on a sufficiently large scale, was permissible,\r\nbut it was advisable to make it wholesale, lurid, and applied not to an\r\nindividual but to a party--emphasising, of course, the fact that your\r\nopponent was irretrievably pledged to that party through thick and thin.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it was quite legitimate for A to declare that the policy\r\nof the party to which his opponent B belonged was a policy of murder,\r\nrapine, piracy, black-mail, highway robbery, extermination, and\r\nindiscriminate bloodshed; that they had swum to office on a sea of tears\r\nracked from the broken hearts of an outraged peasantry, risen to power\r\non the apex of a smoking hecatomb of women and children, and kept their\r\nposition by methods of ruthless barbarism; that assassination, polygamy,\r\nthuggeeism, simony, bureaucracy, and perhaps even an additional penny on\r\nthe poor man's tea, would very likely be found included in their\r\nofficial programme; that they were definitely pledged to introduce\r\nKalmucks and Ostyaks into the Government Dock-yards, who would work in\r\nchained gangs, be content with three farthings for a fourteen hours'\r\nday, and live exclusively on engine waste and barley-water.\r\n\r\nThis and much more was held to be fair political warfare which should\r\nnot offend the keenest patriot. But if A so far descended to vulgar\r\npersonalities as to accuse B himself of employing an urchin to scare\r\ncrows at eightpence a day when the trade union rate for crow-scaring was\r\nninepence, he stood a fair chance of having an action for libel or\r\ndefamation of character on his hands in addition to an election.\r\n\r\nUnder such a system the least snappy went to the wall. Happy was the man\r\nwho was armed not necessarily with a just cause, but with a name that\r\nlent itself to topical alliteration. Who could resist the appeal to\r\n\r\n    Vote for Frank          Blarney.\r\n             Fresh          Brooms in Parliament.\r\n             Fewer          Bungles during the next five years.\r\n             Financial      Betterment at home.\r\n             Free           Breakfast-tables for the People.\r\n             Flourishing    Businesses all round.\r\n\r\n--especially when it was coupled with the reminder that\r\n\r\nEvery vote given to A. J. Wallflower is a slice of bread filched from\r\nyour innocent children's hard-earned loaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course the schools could not escape the atmosphere. The State-taught\r\nchildren were wonderfully snappy--for the time being. Afterwards, it\r\nmight be noticed, that when the props were pulled away they were\r\ngenerally either annoyingly dull or objectionably pert, or, perhaps,\r\noffensively dully-pert, according to whether their nature was backward\r\nor forward, or a mixture of both. The squad-drilled units could remember\r\nwonderfully well--for the time; they could apply the rules they learned\r\nin just the way they were taught to apply them--for the time. But they\r\ncould not remember what they had not been drilled to remember; they\r\ncould not apply the rules in any other way; they could not apply the\r\nprinciples at all; and they could not think.\r\n\r\nHigh and low, children were not allowed to think; with ninety-nine\r\nmothers out of a hundred its proper name was \"idleness.\" \"I do not like\r\nto see you sitting down doing nothing, dear,\" said every mother to every\r\ndaughter plaintively. \"Is there no sewing you might do?\" So the would-be\r\nthoughtful child was harried into working, or playing, or eating, or\r\nsleeping, as though a mind contentedly occupied with itself was an\r\nunworthy or a morbid thing.\r\n\r\nYet it was a too close adherence to the national character that proved\r\nto be the undoing of Wynchley Slocombe, who is now generally admitted to\r\nhave been the father of the form of aerial propulsion so widely enjoyed\r\nto-day. Like everybody else, he had read the offer of the Traffic and\r\nLocomotion Department of a substantial reward for a satisfactory\r\nflying-machine, embracing \"any contrivance ... that would by\r\ndemonstration enable one or more persons, freed from all earth-support\r\nor connection (_a_) to remain stationary at will, at any height between\r\n50 and 1500 feet; (_b_) at that height to travel between two points one\r\nmile apart within a time limit of seven minutes and without deviating\r\nmore than fifty yards from a straight line connecting the two points;\r\n(_c_) to travel in a circle of not less than three miles in\r\ncircumference within a time limit of fifteen minutes.\" Wynchley took an\r\nordinary intelligent interest in the subject, but he had no thought of\r\ncompeting.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the last day of the period allowed for submitting plans\r\nthat Wynchley's great idea occurred to him. There was then no time for\r\nelaborating the germ or for preparing the requisite specifications, even\r\nif he had any ability to do so, which he had not, being, in fact, quite\r\nignorant of the subject. But he remembered hearing in his youth that\r\nwhen a former Government of its day had offered a premium for a\r\nconvenient method of dividing postage stamps (until that time sold in\r\nunperforated sheets and cut up as required by the users), the successful\r\ncompetitor had simply tendered the advice, \"Punch rows of little holes\r\nbetween them.\" In the same spirit Wynchley Slocombe took half a sheet of\r\nsilurian notepaper (now become famous, and preserved in the South\r\nKensington Museum) and wrote on it, \"Fasten on a pair of wings, and\r\npractise! practise!! practise!!!\" It was to be the aerial counterpart of\r\n\"Gunnery! Gunnery!! Gunnery!!!\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the departmental offices were the only places in England\r\nwhere \"snap\" was not recognised. Wynchley was regarded as a suicidal\r\nlunatic--a familiar enough figure in flying-machine circles--and his\r\nsuggestion was duly pigeon-holed without consideration.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent career of the unhappy man may be briefly stated.\r\nDisappointed in his hopes of an early recognition, and not having\r\nsufficient money at his disposal to demonstrate the practicability of\r\nhis idea, he took to writing letters to the President of the Board, and\r\nsubsequently to waylaying high officials and demanding interviews with\r\nthem. Dismissed from his situation for systematic neglect of duty, he\r\nbecame a \"poor litigant with a grievance\" at the Law Courts, and\r\nperiodically applied for summonses against the Prime Minister, the Lord\r\nMayor of London, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Still later his name\r\nbecame a by-word as that of a confirmed window-breaker at the Government\r\noffices. A few years afterwards, a brief paragraph in one or two papers\r\nannounced that Wynchley Slocombe, \"who, some time ago, gained an\r\nunenviable notoriety on account of his hallucinations,\" had committed\r\nsuicide in a Deptford model lodging-house.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile two plans for flying-machines had been selected as\r\ndisplaying the most merit, and their inventors were encouraged to press\r\non with the construction under a monetary grant. Both were finished\r\nduring the same week, and for the sake of comparison they were submitted\r\nto trial on the same day upon Shorncliffe plain. _Vimbonne VI._, which\r\nresembled a much-distended spider with outspread legs, made the first\r\nascent. According to instructions, it was to demonstrate its ability to\r\ngo in a straight line by descending in a field near the Military Canal,\r\nbeyond Seabrook, but from the moment of its release it continued to\r\ndescribe short circles with a velocity hitherto unattained in any\r\nair-ship, until its frantic constructor was too dizzy to struggle with\r\nits mechanism any longer. The _Moloch_ was then unmoored, and took up\r\nits position stationary at a height of 1000 feet with absolute\r\nprecision. It was built on the lines of a gigantic centipede, with two\r\nrows of clubby oars beneath, and ranked as the popular favourite. Being\r\ninstructed, for the sake of variety, to begin with the three mile\r\ncircle, the _Moloch_ started out to sea on the flash of the gun, the\r\nsinuous motion that rippled down its long vertebrate body producing an\r\neffect, accidental but so very life-like, that many of the vast\r\nconcourse assembled on the ground turned pale and could not follow it\r\nunmoved....\r\n\r\nThere have been many plausible theories put forward by experts to\r\naccount for the subsequent disaster, but for obvious reasons the real\r\nexplanation can never progress beyond the realms of conjecture, for the\r\n_Moloch_, instead of bending to the east, encircling Folkestone and its\r\nsuburbs, and descending again in the middle of Shorncliffe Camp,\r\ncontinued its unswerving line towards the coast of France, and never\r\nheld communication with civilised man again.\r\n\r\nSo exact was its course, however, that it was easy to trace its passage\r\nacross Europe. It reached Boulogne about four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nand was cheered vociferously under the pathetic impression that\r\neverything was going well. Amiens saw it a little to the east in the\r\nfading light of evening, and a few early citizens of Dijon marked it\r\nsoon after dawn. Its passage over the Alps was accurately timed and\r\nnoted at several points, and the Italian frontier had a glimpse of it,\r\nvery high up, it was recorded, at nightfall. A gentleman of Ajaccio,\r\ntravelling in the interior of the island, thought that he had seen it\r\nsome time during the next day; and several Tripoli Greeks swore that it\r\nhad passed a few yards above their heads a week later; but the testimony\r\nof the Corsican was deemed the more reliable of the two. A relief\r\nexpedition was subsequently sent out and traversed a great part of\r\nAfrica, but although the natives in the district around the Albert\r\nNyanza repeatedly prostrated themselves and smacked their thighs\r\nvigorously--the tribal signs of fear and recognition--when shown a small\r\nworking model of the _Moloch_, no further trace was ever obtained of it.\r\n\r\nThe accident had a curious sequel in the House of Commons, which\r\nsignificantly illustrates how unexpected may be the ultimate\r\ndevelopments of a chain of circumstance. It so happened that in addition\r\nto its complement of hands, the _Moloch_ carried an assistant\r\nunder-secretary to the Board of Agriculture. This gentleman, who had\r\nmade entomology a lifelong study, was invaluable to his office, and the\r\nlamentable consequence of his absence was that when the President of the\r\nBoard rose the following night to answer a question respecting the\r\nimportation of lady-birds to arrest an aphis plague then devastating the\r\norchards of the country, he ingenuously displayed so striking an\r\nunfamiliarity with the subject that his resignation was demanded, the\r\nGovernment discredited, and a dissolution forced. In particular, the\r\nhon. gentleman convulsed the House by referring throughout to lady-birds\r\nas \"the female members of the various feathered tribes,\" and warmly\r\ndefending their importation as the only satisfactory expedient in the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWynchley's suggestion remained on file for the next few years, and would\r\ndoubtless have crumbled to dust unfruitfully had it not been for a\r\ntrivial incident. A junior staff clerk, finding himself to be without\r\nmatches one morning, and hesitating to mutilate the copy of--let us say,\r\nthe official Pink Paper which he was reading at the moment,\r\nabsent-mindedly tore a sheet haphazard from a bundle close at hand. As\r\nhe lit his cigarette, the name of Wynchley Slocombe caught his eye and\r\nstirred a half-forgotten memory, for the unfortunate Wynchley had been a\r\nstock jest in the past.\r\n\r\nHerbert Baedeker Phipps now becomes a force in the history of aerial\r\nconquest. He smoothed out the paper from which he had only torn off a\r\nfragment, read the stirring \"Practise! Practise!! Practise!!!\" (at least\r\nit has since been recognised to be stirring--stirring, inspired, and\r\npulsating with the impassioned ardour of neglected genius), and pondered\r\ndeeply to the accompaniment of three more cigarettes. Was there anything\r\nin it? Why could not people fly by means of artificial wings? There had\r\nbeen attempts; how did the enthusiasts begin? Usually by precipitating\r\nthemselves out of an upper window in the first flush of their\r\nself-confidence. They were killed, and wings fell into disfavour; but\r\nthe same result would attend the unsophisticated novice who made his\r\nfirst essay in swimming by diving off a cliff into ten fathoms deep of\r\nwater. Here, even in a denser medium, was the admitted necessity for\r\nlaborious practice before security was assured.\r\n\r\nPhipps looked a step further. By nature man is ill-equipped for flying,\r\nwhereas he possesses in himself all the requisites for successful\r\npropulsion through the water. Yet he needs practice in water; more\r\npractice therefore in air. For thousands of years mankind has been\r\nswimming and thereby lightening the task for his descendants, to such an\r\nextent that in certain islands the children swim almost naturally, even\r\nbefore they walk; whereas, with the solitary exception of a certain\r\nfabled gentleman who made the attempt so successfully and attained such\r\na height that the sun melted the wax with which he had affixed his wings\r\n(Styckiton in convenient tubes not being then procurable), no man has\r\never flown. More, more practice. The very birds themselves, Phipps\r\nremembered, first require parental coaching in the art, while aquatic\r\ncreatures and even the amphibia take to that element with developed\r\nfaculties from their birth. Still more need of practice for ungainly\r\nman. Here, he was convinced, lay the whole secret of failure and\r\npossible success. \"Practise! Practise!! Practise!!!\" The last word was\r\nwith Wynchley Slocombe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MILLION TO ONE CHANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSo wings came--to stay, every one admitted, although most people\r\ncomplained that after all flying was not so wonderful when one could do\r\nit as they thought it would have been. For at the first glance the\r\npopular fancy had inclined towards pinning on a pair of gauzy appendages\r\nand soaring at once into empyrean heights with the spontaneity of a\r\nlark, or of lightly fluttering from point to point with the ease and\r\ngrace of a butterfly. They found that a pair of wings cost rather more\r\nthan a high-grade bicycle, and that the novice who could struggle from\r\nthe stage into a net placed twenty yards away, after a month's course of\r\ndaily practices, was held to be very promising. There was no more talk\r\nof England lying at the mercy of any and every invader; for one man, and\r\none only, had so far succeeded in crossing even the Channel, and that at\r\nits narrowest limit. For at least three years after the conversion of\r\nPhipps the generality of people gleaned their knowledge of the progress\r\nof flying from the pages of the comic papers. To the comic papers wings\r\nhad been sent as an undiluted blessing.\r\n\r\nBut if alatics, in their infancy, did not come up to the wider\r\nexpectation, there were many who found in it a novel and exhilarating\r\nsport. There were also those who, discovering something congenial in the\r\nnew force, set quietly and resolutely to work to develop its\r\npossibilities and to raise it above the level of a mere fashionable\r\nnovelty. There have always been some, a few, not infrequently\r\nEnglishmen, who have unostentatiously become pre-eminent in every\r\ndevelopment of science with a fixity of purpose. Their names rarely\r\nappear in the pages of history, but they largely write it.\r\n\r\nHastings permitted mixed flying. It was a question that had embittered\r\nmany a town council. To one section it seemed intolerable that a father,\r\na husband, or a brother should be torn for twenty minutes from the side\r\nof his female relatives; to the opposing section it seemed horrible that\r\ncoatless men should be allowed to spread their wings within a hundred\r\nand fifty yards of shoeless women.\r\n\r\n\"I have no particular convictions,\" one prominent citizen remarked, \"but\r\nin view of the existing railway facilities it is worth while considering\r\nwhether we shall have any visitors at all this season if we stand in the\r\nway of families flying down together.\" The humour of the age was flowing\r\nmordaciously, even as the wit of France had done little more than a\r\ncentury before. The readiest jests carried a tang, whether turning upon\r\npersonal poverty, municipal extravagance, or national incapacity.\r\nOpinion being evenly divided, the local rate of seventeen shillings in\r\nthe pound influenced the casting vote in favour of mixed flying. There\r\nwere necessary preparations, including a captive balloon in which an\r\nancient mariner, decked out with a pair of wings like a superannuated\r\nCupid, was posted to render assistance to the faltering. The rates at\r\nonce rose to seventeen shillings and sixpence, but the principle of the\r\nenterprise was admitted to be sound.\r\n\r\nSo on this pleasant summer afternoon--an ideal day for a fly, said every\r\none--the heights above the old town were echoing to the ceaseless gaiety\r\nof the watching crowd, for alatics had not yet ceased to be a novelty,\r\nwhile the air above was cleft by a hundred pairs of beating wings.\r\n\r\n\"A remarkable sight,\" said an old man who had opened conversation with\r\nthe sociable craving of the aged; \"ten years ago we little expected\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" replied his chance acquaintance on the seat; \"if I remember\r\nrightly, the tendency was all towards a combination either of a balloon\r\nand a motor-car or of a submarine and a band-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't fly yourself?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man--and he was a stalwart enough youth--looked at himself\r\ncritically as if mentally picturing the effect of a pair of wings upon\r\nhis person. \"Well, no,\" he replied; \"one doesn't get the time for\r\npractice. Then consider the price of the things. And the annual\r\nlicence--oh, they won't let you forget _that_, I assure you. Well, is it\r\nworth it?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head in harmonious agreement; decidedly for him it\r\nwas not worth it. \"Perhaps you are in Somerset House?\" he remarked\r\ntentatively. It is not the young who are curious; they have the\r\nfascinating study of themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" replied the other, veiling by this diplomatic ambiguity\r\nan eminent firm of West End drapers; \"but I happen to have rather\r\nexceptional chances of knowing what is going on behind the scenes in\r\nLondon. I can assure you, sir, that in spite of the last sixpence on the\r\nincome-tax and the hen-roost tax, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has\r\nsent out stringent orders to whip up every penny in the hope of\r\nlessening a serious deficit.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may possibly be a deficit,\" admitted the old man with bland\r\nassurance; \"but what do a few millions, either one way or the other,\r\nmatter to a country with our inexhaustible resources? We are certainly\r\npassing through a period of financial depression, but the unfailing\r\nlesson of the past has been that a cycle of bad years is inevitably\r\nfollowed by a cycle of good years, and in the competition with foreign\r\ncountries our advantage of free trade ensures our pre-eminence.\" For it\r\nis a mistake now to ascribe optimism to youth. Those youths have by this\r\ntime grown up into old men. Age is the optimist because it has seen so\r\nmany things \"come right,\" so many difficulties \"muddled through.\" Also\r\nbecause they who would have been pessimistic old men have worried\r\nthemselves into early graves. Your unquenchable optimist needs no pill\r\nto aid digestion. \"Then,\" he concluded, \"why trouble yourself\r\nunnecessarily on a beautiful day like this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it doesn't trouble me,\" laughed the other man; \"at least the\r\ndeficit doesn't; nor the income-tax, I regret to say. But I rather kick\r\nat ten per cent. on my season ticket and a few other trifles when I\r\nconsider that there used to be better national value without them. And I\r\nrather think that most others have had about enough of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, patience; you are a young man yet. Look round. I don't think\r\nI ever saw the grass greener for the time of the year, and in my front\r\ngarden I noticed only to-day that the syringa is out a full week earlier\r\nthan I can remember.... Eh! What is it? Which way? Where?\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk was on his feet suddenly, and standing on the seat. Every one\r\nwas standing up, and all in a common impulse were pointing to the sky.\r\nSome--women--screamed as they stood and watched, but after a gasp of\r\nhorrified surprise, like a cry of warning cut short because too late,\r\nthe mingling noises of the crowd seemed to shrink away in a breath.\r\nEvery one had read of the sickening tragedies of broken cross-rods or of\r\nsudden loss of wing-power--aerolanguisis it was called--and one was\r\ntaking place before their eyes. High up, very high at first, and a\r\nlittle to the east, a female figure was cleaving headlong through the\r\nair, and beyond all human power to save.\r\n\r\nSo one would have said; so every one indeed assumed; and when a second\r\nlater another figure crossed their range it only heralded a double\r\ntragedy. It drew a gasp ... a gasp that lingered, spun out long and\r\nturned to one loud, tumultuous shout. The next minute men were shouting\r\nincoherently, dancing wildly, shaking hands with all and any, and\r\nexpressing frantic relief in a hundred frantic ways.\r\n\r\nThus makes his timely entry into this chronicle Gatacre Stobalt, and\r\nreviewing the progress of flying as it then immaturely stood, it is not\r\ntoo much to say that no other man could have turned that tragedy. With\r\nan instinctive judgment of time, distance, angle, and his own powers,\r\nStobalt, from a hundred feet above, had leapt as a diver often leaps as\r\nhe leaves the plank, and with rigid outstretched wings was dropping\r\nearthward on all but a plummet line. It was the famous \"razor-edge\"\r\nstroke at its narrowest angle, the delight of strong and daring fliers,\r\nthe terror of those who watched beneath. It may be realised by ascending\r\nto the highest point of St Paul's and contemplating a dive into the\r\nflooded churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe moment was a classic one in the history of the wing. The air had\r\nclaimed its victims as the waters have; and there was a legitimate\r\npride, since the enterprise was no longer foolhardy, that they had never\r\nbeen withheld. But never before had a rescue been effected beyond the\r\nlimits of the nets; it was not then deemed practicable and the axiom of\r\nthe sport \"A broken wing is a broken neck,\" so far held good. Yet here\r\nwas a man, no novice in the art, deliberately pointing sheer to earth on\r\na line that must bring him, if unswervingly maintained, into contact\r\nwith the falling girl beneath. Up to that point the attempt would have\r\nbeen easy if daring, beyond it nothing but the readiest self-possession\r\nand the most consummate skill could avert an irretrievable disaster to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You have not even had the curiosity to ask if I am hurt yet.\" Her voice\r\ncertainly was.\r\n\r\n\"X = - 4 {C^2} {x^3},\" murmured Stobalt abstractedly. \"I assure you,\" he\r\nexplained, leaving the higher mathematics at her reproach, \"that I had\r\nquite satisfied myself that you were not.... It all turns on the extra\r\ntension thrown on the crank by the additional three feathers. I am\r\nconvinced that English makers have gone as far as they safely can in\r\nthat direction.\" He glanced at her wings as he mused. They were of the\r\nfamiliar detached feather--or \"venetian blind,\" as it was commonly\r\ncalled--pattern, and wonderfully graceful in their long sweep and\r\nelegant poise. Made of the purest white celluloid, just tinted with a\r\ndelicate and deepening pink at the base, they harmonised with her\r\nsea-green costume as faultlessly as the lily with the leaves it springs\r\nfrom. Stobalt himself used the more difficult but much more powerful\r\n\"bat\" shape, built up of gold-beaters' skin; he had already folded them\r\nin rest, but in those early days the prudish conventions of the air\r\ndebarred the girl from seeking a like repose.\r\n\r\n\"I should certainly discard the three outside feathers,\" he summed up.\r\n\r\n\"I shall certainly discard the whole thing,\" she replied. \"I do not know\r\nwhich felt the worse--being killed or being saved.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture that would seem to say that the personal details of\r\nthe adventure were better dismissed. He was plainly a man of few words,\r\nbut the mechanical defect still held his interest.\r\n\r\n\"One understands that a brave man always dislikes being thanked,\" she\r\ncontinued a little nervously; \"and, indeed, what can I say to thank you?\r\nYou have saved my life, and I know that it must have been at a\r\ntremendous risk to yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that the sooner you forget the incident.... That\r\nand the removal of those three feathers.\" His gestures were deliberate\r\nand the reverse of vivacious, but when he glanced up and moved a hand,\r\nit at once conveyed to the girl that in his opinion nothing else need\r\nstand in the way of her recovered powers and confidence.\r\n\r\n\"And there is,\" she said timidly, \"nothing?\" Precisely what there might\r\nbe had not occurred to her satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he said, without the air of being heroic in his generosity.\r\n\"Unless,\" he added, \"you care to promise that you will not let----\" He\r\nstopped with easy self-possession and turned enquiringly to a man in\r\nsome official dress who had suddenly appeared in the glade.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a licence?\" demanded the official, ignoring Stobalt and\r\naddressing himself in a style that at one time would have been deemed\r\nobjectionably abrupt, to the lady. He was in point of fact a policeman,\r\nand from a thong on his wrist swung a truncheon, while the butt of a\r\nrevolver showed at his belt. He wore no number or identifying mark, for\r\nit had long since been agreed that it must be objectionable to their\r\nfiner feelings to treat policemen as though they were--one cannot say\r\nconvicts, for a sympathetic Home Secretary had already discontinued the\r\nnumbering of convicts on the ground that it created a state of things\r\n\"undistinguishable from slavery,\" though not really slavery--but as\r\nthough they were railway bridges or district council lamp-posts. \"Treat\r\na man as a dog, and he becomes a dog,\" had been the invincible argument\r\nof the band of humanitarians who had introduced what was known as the\r\n\"Get-up-when-you-like-and-have-what-you-want\" system of prison\r\ndiscipline, and \"Treat a man as a lamp-post, and he becomes a\r\nlamp-post,\" had been the logical standpoint of the Amalgamated Union of\r\nPolicemen and Plain Clothes Detectives.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the girl, and her voice had not quite that agreeable\r\nintonation that members of the force usually hear from the lips of fair\r\nyoung ladies nowadays. \"Do you wish to see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else should I ask you if you had one for?\" he demanded with the\r\ninnate boorishness of the heavy-witted man. \"Of course I want to see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the little bag that hung from her girdle and handed him a\r\npaper without a word.\r\n\r\n\"Muriel Ursula Percy Sleigh Hampden?\" It would be idle to pretend that\r\nthe names pleased him, or that he tried to veil his contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nHe indicated his private disbelief--or possibly merely took a ready\r\nmeans of exercising his authority in a way that he knew to be\r\noffensive--by producing a small tin box from one of his pockets and\r\npassing it to her without any explanation. The requirement was so\r\nuniversal in practice, however, that no explanation was necessary, for\r\nthe signature, as the chief mark of identification, had long been\r\nsuperseded by the simpler and more effective thumb-sign. Miss Hampden\r\nmade a slight grimace when she saw the condition of the soft wax which\r\nthe box contained, but she obediently pressed it with her thumb and\r\npassed it back again. As her licence bore another thumb-sign, stamped in\r\npigment, it was only necessary for the constable to compare the two (a\r\nprocess simplified by the superimposing glass, a contrivance not unlike\r\na small opera-glass with converging tubes) in order to satisfy himself\r\nat once whether the marks were the impress of the same thumb. Apparently\r\nthey were, for with a careless \"Right-O,\" he proceeded on his way,\r\nswinging his truncheon with an easy grace, and occasionally striking off\r\nthe end of an overhanging branch.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Stobalt, when at length the zealous officer had quite\r\ndisappeared in search of other fields for tactful activity, \"I wonder if\r\nyou are a daughter of Sir John Hampden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, looking at him with renewed interest. \"His only\r\ndaughter. Do you know my father?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"I have been away, but we see the papers sometimes,\"\r\nhe said. \"The Sir John I mean,\" he explained, as though the point were a\r\nmatter of some moment, \"was a few years ago regarded as the one man who\r\nmight unite our parties and save the position.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one Sir John Hampden,\" she replied. \"But it was too\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" he admitted vaguely, dismissing the subject.\r\n\r\nBoth were silent for a few minutes; it might be noticed that people\r\noften became thoughtful when they spoke of the past in those years.\r\nIndeed, an optimist might almost have had some ground for believing that\r\na thinking era had begun.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke again it was with something of an air of constraint. \"You\r\nasked me just now if there was--anything. Well, I have since\r\nthought----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" she said encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought that I should like to meet your father. I hear\r\neverywhere that he is the most inaccessible man in London; but perhaps\r\nif you could favour me with a line of introduction----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" she exclaimed gladly. \"I am sure that he would wish to thank\r\nyou. I will write to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have paper and a pencil here,\" he suggested. \"I have been a sailor,\"\r\nhe added, as though that simple statement explained an omnipercipient\r\nresourcefulness; as perhaps it did.\r\n\r\n\"If you prefer it,\" she said, accepting the proffered stationery. It did\r\nnot make the least difference, she told herself, but this business-like\r\nexpedition chilled her generous instincts.\r\n\r\n\"I leave for town to-night,\" was all he vouchsafed.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes she wrote in silence, while he looked fixedly out to\r\nsea. \"What name am I to write, please?\" she asked presently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Salt--George Salt,\" he replied in a matter-of-fact voice, and\r\nwithout turning his head.\r\n\r\n\"Is it 'Mr Salt,' or 'Captain,' or----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just 'Mr,' please. And\"--his voice fell a little flat in spite of\r\nhimself, but he did not meet her eyes--\"and would it be too much if I\r\nasked you to mention the circumstances under which we met?\"\r\n\r\nShe bent a little lower over the paper in a shame she could not then\r\ndefine. \"I will not fail to let my father know how heroic you have been,\r\nand to what an extent we are indebted to you,\" she replied\r\ndispassionately.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\" Suddenly he turned with an arresting gesture, and impulsive\r\nspeech trembled on his tongue. But the sophistries of explanation,\r\napology, self-extenuation, were foreign to the nature of this strong\r\nkeen-featured man, whose grey and not unkindly eyes had gained their\r\ntranquil depth from long intercourse with sea and sky--those two masters\r\nwho teach the larger things of life. The words were never spoken, his\r\narm fell down again, and the moment passed.\r\n\r\n\"I have never,\" he was known to say with quiet emphasis in later years,\r\n\"regretted silence. I have never given way to an impulse and spoken\r\nhastily without regretting speech.\"\r\n\r\nThe London evening papers were being cried in the streets of the old\r\nCinque Port as \"George Salt\" walked to the station a few hours later. A\r\ngeneral election was drawing to its desultory close, but the results\r\nseemed to excite curiously little interest among the well-dressed,\r\nleisured class that filled the promenades. It was a longer sweep of the\r\npendulum than had ever been anticipated in the days when politics were\r\nmore or less the pastime of the rich, and the working classes neither\r\nunderstood nor cared to understand them--only understood that whatever\r\nelse happened nothing ever came their way.\r\n\r\nThe man who had been a sailor bought two papers of very different views,\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_ and the orthodox labour organ called _The\r\nMasses_. Neither rejoiced, but to despair _The Masses_ added a note of\r\ningenuous surprise as it summarised the contest as a whole. This was how\r\nthe matter stood:\r\n\r\n    POSITION OF PARTIES AT THE DISSOLUTION\r\n    Labour Members     300\r\n    Socialists         140\r\n    Liberals           112\r\n    Unionists           40\r\n\r\n    PARTY GAINS\r\n    Socialist Gains        204\r\n    Moderate Labour Gains    5\r\n    Imperial Party Gains     0\r\n\r\n    POSITION OF PARTIES IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT\r\n    Socialists                           344\r\n    Moderate Labour Party (all groups)   179\r\n    Combined Imperial Party (Liberals and\r\n    Unionists)                            68\r\n\r\n(The above returns do not include the Orkney and Shetland Islands.)\r\n\r\n    Socialist majority over all possible combinations   97\r\n\r\nThere is no need to trace the development of political events leading up\r\nto this position. It lends itself to summary. The Labour party had come\r\ninto power by pointing out to voters of the working classes that its\r\nmembers were their brothers, and promising them a great deal of property\r\nbelonging to other people and a good many privileges which they\r\nvehemently denounced in every other class. When in power they had thrown\r\nopen the doors of election to one and all. The Socialist party had come\r\ninto power by pointing out to voters of the working classes that its\r\nmembers were even more their brothers, and promising them a still larger\r\nshare of other people's property (some, indeed, belonging to the more\r\nprosperous of the Labour representatives then in office) and still\r\ngreater privileges. Yet the editor of _The Masses_ was both pained and\r\nsurprised at the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE COMPACT\r\n\r\n\r\nA strong man and a prominent politician, Sir John Hampden had occupied\r\nthe unfamiliar position in Parliament of belonging to no party. To no\r\nparty, that is, as the term had then been current in English politics;\r\nfor, more discerning than most of his contemporaries, he had foreseen\r\nthe obliteration of the existing boundaries and the phenomenal growth of\r\npurely class politics even in the old century. It was, he recognised, to\r\nbe that development of the franchise with which the world was later to\r\nbecome tolerably familiar: civil war on constitutional lines. His\r\nwarnings fell on very stony ground. The powers that had never yet\r\nprepared for war abroad until the enemy had comfortably occupied all the\r\nstrategic points, lest they should wound some wily protesting old\r\ngentleman's susceptibilities, were scarcely likely to take time by the\r\nforelock--or even by a hind fetlock, to enlarge the comparison--at home.\r\nWhile the Labour party was bringing pressure upon the Government of the\r\nday to grant an extension of suffrage that made Labour the master of\r\neight out of every ten constituencies, the two great classical parties\r\nwere quarrelling vehemently whether L5000 should be spent upon a\r\nsanatorium at Hai Yang and L5,000,000 upon a dockyard at Pittiescottie,\r\nor L5,000,000 upon a dockyard at Hai Yang and L5000 upon a sanatorium at\r\nPittiescottie. When it is added that the Labour party was definitely\r\npledged to the inauguration of universal peace by declining to go to war\r\non any provocation, and looked towards wholesale disarmament as the\r\nfirst means of economy on attaining office, the cataclysmal humour of\r\nthe situation becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nThey attained office, as it has been seen, thanks largely to the great\r\nLiberal party whom they succeeded. The great Liberal party, like the\r\neditor of _The Masses_ some years later, was pained and surprised at\r\nthis ingratitude. The great Liberal party had never contemplated such a\r\ndevelopment, and through thick and thin had insisted upon regarding the\r\nLabour party as its ally, notwithstanding the fact that the \"ally\" had\r\nalways laughed uproariously at the \"alliance,\" and had pleasantly\r\nannounced its intention of strewing Westminster with the wreckage of all\r\nexisting capitalistic parties when once it was strong enough to do so.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder that that great Liberal Administration was destined to\r\npass down to future ages as the \"House of Pathetic Fools.\" Posterity\r\nadjudicated that no greater example of servile fatuousness could be\r\nproduced. This was unjust, for on 20th June 1792, Louis XVI., certainly,\r\nlet it be admitted, harder pressed, had accepted a red \"cap of liberty,\"\r\nand putting it on in obedience to the command of the \"extreme party\" of\r\nhis time, had bowed right and left with ingratiating friendliness, while\r\na Labour gentleman, bearing upon a pike a raw cow's heart labelled \"The\r\nheart of an aristocrat,\" roared out, with his twenty thousand friends,\r\nan amused approval.\r\n\r\nIt was out of the material of the two great traditional parties that Sir\r\nJohn Hampden tried to create his \"class\" coalition to meet the new\r\nconditions. The spectacle of working men suddenly dropping party\r\ndifferences and merging into a solid phalanx of labour was before their\r\neyes, but the Tories were disintegrated and inert, the Whigs\r\nself-satisfied and cock-sure. The years of grace--just so many years as\r\nSir John was before his contemporaries--passed. Then came a brief\r\nperiod, desperate indeed, but not hopeless, while something might yet be\r\ndone; but the leaders of the historical parties were waiting for some\r\nhappy chance by which they might retract and yet preserve their dignity.\r\nIt was during this crisis that the party whose idea of dignity was\r\nsymbolised by the escort of a brass band on a green-grocer's cart,\r\nabolished the House of Lords, suspended the naval programme, and\r\nconfiscated all ecclesiastical landed property. Panic reigned, but there\r\ncould be no appeal, for the party in power had never concealed their\r\naims and aspirations, and now that they had been returned, they were\r\nonly carrying out their promises.\r\n\r\nThat is putting their position so mildly as to be almost unjust. They\r\nwere, indeed, among political parties the only one immaculate and beyond\r\nreproach. All others had trimmed and whittled, promised and recalled,\r\nsworn and forsworn, till political assurances were emptier than\r\nlibertines' vows. The Socialists had nailed their manifesto to the mast,\r\nand no man could charge them with duplicity. On every platform from\r\nCaithness to Cornwall they had stood openly and declared: We are the\r\nenemies to Capital; we are at war with Society as it is at present\r\nconstituted; we are for the forcible distribution of wealth, however\r\ncome by, the abolition of class distinctions, and the levelling of\r\nhumanity, with the unskilled labourer as the ideal standard.\r\n\r\n\"Good fellows all,\" had, in effect, declared their Liberal \"allies,\"\r\n\"and they do not really mean that--not phraseologically accurately, that\r\nis. We go in for a little, say, serpent-charming ourselves at election\r\ntimes, and when these excellent men are in Parliament the refining\r\ninfluence of the surroundings will tone them down wonderfully, and they\r\nwill turn out thoroughly moderate and conciliatory members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you make any error about that, comrades,\" the Socialistic-Labour\r\ncandidates had replied; and with a candour unparalleled in the history\r\nof electioneering they had not merely hinted this or said it among\r\nthemselves, but had freely and honourably proclaimed it to the four\r\nwinds. \"If you like to help us just now that's your affair, and we are\r\nquite willing to profit by it. But if you knew what you were doing, you\r\nwould go home and all have the nightmare.\"\r\n\r\n\"So naive!\" smiled the great Liberal party. \"Suppose they have to talk\r\nlike that at present to please the unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the deluge. Sir John Hampden could have every section of the\r\nmiddle and upper class political parties to lead if he so deigned, but\r\nwherever else he might lead them there was no possible hope of it being\r\nto St. Stephen's. It was, as his daughter had said, then too late.\r\nLabour members of one complexion or another had captured three-quarters\r\nof the constituencies, and there was not the slightest chance of ousting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that in less than a decade from the first alarm, the\r\nextremity of the patriot's hope was that in perhaps twenty years' time,\r\nwhen the country was reduced to bankruptcy and the position of a third\r\nclass power, and when there was no more property to confiscate in the\r\ninterest of the working class voter, a popular rising or a foreign\r\ninvasion might again place a responsible administration in power. But in\r\nthe meantime the organisations of the old parties fell to pieces, the\r\nparties themselves ceased to be powers, their leaders were half\r\nforgotten. Sir John Hampden might still be a rallying point if he raised\r\na standard in a time of renewed hope, but there was no hope, and Sir\r\nJohn was reported to have broken his staff, drowned his books, and cut\r\nhimself off from politics in the bitterness of his indignation and\r\nimpotent despair.\r\n\r\nIt was in something very like this mood that George Salt found him, and\r\nit was an issue of the mood that would have made him inaccessible to a\r\nless resourceful man. Day after day he had denied himself to his old\r\nassociates, and little disappointed hucksters who were anxious to betray\r\ntheir party for their conscience' sake--provided there was a definite\r\noffer of a more lucrative position in a new party--vainly shadowed his\r\ndoorway with ready-made cabals in their pocket-books. But the man who\r\nhad been a sailor and spoke few words had an air that carried where\r\nfluency and self-assurance failed. Even then, almost at his first words,\r\nSir John would have closed the subject, definitely and without\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\"Politics do not concern me, Mr Salt,\" he said, rising, with an angry\r\nflash in the eyes whose fighting light gave the lie to the story of\r\nabandoned hope. \"If that is your business you have reached me by a\r\nsubterfuge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having reached you,\" replied Salt, unmoved, \"will you allow me to put\r\nmy suggestions before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that they are interesting,\" replied the baronet,\r\nfalling into smooth indifference, \"but, as you may see, I am exclusively\r\ndevoted to Euplexoptera now.\" It might be true, for the table before him\r\nwas covered with specimens, scientific instruments and entomological\r\nworks, while not even a single newspaper betrayed an interest in the\r\nday; but a world of bitterness smouldered beneath his half-scornful\r\nadmission. \"If,\" he continued in the same vein, \"you have an idea for an\r\neffective series of magic lantern slides, you will find the offices of\r\nthe Union of Imperial Agencies in Whitehall.\"\r\n\r\nThe first act to which the new Government was pledged was the evacuation\r\nof Egypt, and the mighty counterblast from the headquarters of the\r\nremnant of the great opposing organisation was, it should be explained,\r\na travelling magic lantern van, designed to satisfy rural voters as to\r\nthe present happy condition of the fellahin!\r\n\r\n\"Possibly you would hardly complain that I am not prepared to go far\r\nenough,\" replied the visitor. \"But in order to discuss that, I must have\r\nyour serious attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already expressed myself,\" replied Sir John formally. \"I am not\r\ninterested.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will hear me out and then repeat that, I will go,\" urged Salt\r\nwith desperate calmness. \"Yet I have thrown up the profession of my life\r\nbecause I hold that there is a certain remedy. And I have come a hundred\r\nmiles to-night to offer it to you: for you are the man. Realise that I\r\nam vitally concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" replied Sir John courteously, but without the\r\nfaintest encouragement, \"but the matter is beyond me. Leave me, and try\r\nsome younger, less disillusionised man.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no other man who will serve my purpose.\" Sir John stared hard,\r\nas well he might: others had not been in the habit of appealing to him\r\nto serve their purposes. \"You are the natural leader of our classes. You\r\nalone can inspire them; you alone have the authority to call them to any\r\neffort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been invited to lead a hundred forlorn hopes,\" replied Sir John.\r\n\"A dozen years--nine years--aye, perhaps even six years ago any one of\r\nthem might have been sufficient. Now--I have my earwigs. Good night, Mr\r\nSalt.\"\r\n\r\nThe dismissal was so unmistakably final that the most stubborn\r\npersistence could scarcely ignore it. Mr Salt rose, but only to approach\r\nthe table by which Sir John was standing.\r\n\r\n\"I wished to have you with me on the bare merits of my plan,\" he said in\r\na low voice, \"but you would not. But you shall save England in spite of\r\nyour dead heart. Read this letter.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed doubtful how Hampden would take so brusque a\r\ndemand. Another second and he might have imperiously ordered Salt to\r\nleave the house, when his eyes fell with a start upon the writing thrust\r\nbefore him, and taking the letter in his hand he read it through, read\r\nit twice.\r\n\r\n\"Little fool!\" he said, so low that it sounded tenderly; \"poor little\r\nfool!\" Then aloud: \"Am I to understand that you have saved my daughter's\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied George Salt, and even the tropical sunburn could not\r\ncover his hot shame.\r\n\r\n\"At great personal risk to yourself?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the reply was, \"Yes,\" without an added word.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not let me know of this before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that matter now?\" It had been his master card, but a very\r\nhumiliating one to play throughout: to trade upon that moment's\r\ninstinctive heroism, to assert his bravery, to apprise it at its worth,\r\nand to claim a fit return.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" admitted Sir John with intuition, \"I don't suppose it does. The\r\nposition then is, that instead of exchanging the usual compliments\r\napplicable to the occasion, I express my gratitude by listening to your\r\nviews on the political situation? And further,\" he continued, with the\r\nsame gentle air of irony, accepting Salt's silent acquiescence, \"that I\r\nproceed to liquidate my obligation fully by identifying myself with a\r\nscheme which you have in your pocket for averting national disaster?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Salt sharply. \"That is for you to accept or reject\r\nunconditionally on your own judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I am entirely at your service now.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, then, I ask you to admit that a state of civil war\r\nmorally exists, and that the only possible hope for our existence lies\r\nin adopting the methods of covert civil war to secure our ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admit! Good God! I have been shrieking it into deaf ears for half my\r\nlife, it seems,\" cried Sir John, suddenly stirred despite himself. \"They\r\ncalled me the Phantom Storm-petrel--'Wolf-cry' Hampden, Heaven knows\r\nwhat not--through an entire decade. Admit! Go on, Mr Salt. I accept your\r\nfirst clause more easily than Lord Stirling swallowed Socialistic\r\namendments to his own Bills, and that is saying a great deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Salt, taking a bundle of papers from an inner pocket\r\nand selecting a docket of half a dozen typewritten sheets from it, \"I\r\npropose for your acceptance the following plan of campaign.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked round the littered desk for a vacant space on which to lay the\r\ndocument. With an impetuous movement of his arm Sir John swept books,\r\ntrays, and insects into one chaotic heap, and spreading the summary\r\nbefore him plunged into it forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNTRODDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Kumreds,\" announced Mr Tubes with winning familiarity, \"I may say now\r\nand once and for all that you've thoroughly convinced _me_ of the\r\njustice of your claims. But that isn't saying that the thing's as good\r\nas done, so don't go slinging it broadcast in the next pub you come to.\r\nThere's our good kumred the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be taken into\r\naccount, and while I'm about it let me tell you straight that these\r\nCabinet jobs, whether at twenty, fifty, or a hundred quid a week, aren't\r\nthe softest things going, as some of you chaps seem to imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swap you, mate, then,\" called out a facetious L. & N. W. fireman. \"Yus,\r\nand throw the missis and kids into the bargain. Call it a deal?\"\r\n\r\nIn his modest little house the Right Hon. James Tubes, M.P., Secretary\r\nof State for the Home Department, was receiving a deputation. Success,\r\nsaid his friends, had not spoiled him; others admitted that success had\r\nnot changed him. From the time of his first appearance in Parliament he\r\nhad been dubbed \"Honest Jim\" (perhaps a somewhat empty compliment in\r\nview of the fact that every Labour constituency had barbed unconscious\r\nsatire at its own expense by distinguishing its representative as\r\n\"Honest\" Tom, Dick, or Harry), and after his elevation to Cabinet rank\r\nhe still remained honest. More to the point, because more apparent, he\r\nremained unpretentious. It is true that he ceased to wear, as a personal\r\nconcession to the Prime Minister, by whose side he sat, the grimy coal\r\nminer's suit in which he had first appeared in the House to the\r\ncaptivating of all hearts; but, more fortunate than Caractacus, he\r\nescaped envy by continuing to occupy his humble villa in Kilburn. The\r\nexpenses of a Cabinet Minister, even in a Socialist Government, must\r\ninevitably be heavier than those of a private member, but this admirable\r\nman illustrated the uselessness of riches by continuing to live frugally\r\nbut comfortably upon a tenth of his official income. According to\r\nintimate rumour he prudently invested the superfluous nine-tenths\r\nagainst a rainy day in the gilt-edged securities of countries where\r\nSocialism was least rampant.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes never refused to see a deputation, and when their views had\r\nbeen laid before him it was rare indeed that he was not able to declare\r\na warm personal interest in their objects. True, he could not always\r\nundertake to carry their recommendations into effect; as a Minister he\r\ncould not always express official approval of them, but they were rarely\r\nsent away without the moral support of that wink which is proverbially\r\nas significant as a more compromising form of agreement. Whether the\r\nparticular expression of the great voice of the people was in the\r\ndirection of the State adoption of Zulu orphans, or the compulsory\r\nremoval of park palings from around private estates, the deputation\r\ncould always go away with the inward satisfaction that however his words\r\nmight read to outsiders on the morrow, they knew that as a man and a\r\ncomrade, he, Jim Tubes, was with them heart and soul. \"It costs\r\nnothing,\" he was wont to remark broad-mindedly to his home\r\ncircle--referring, of course, to his own sympathetic attitude; for some\r\nof the ingenuous proposals which he countenanced were found in practice\r\nto prove very costly indeed--\"and who knows what may happen next?\"\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion, as far as compliance lay within his power, there\r\nhad been no need for mental reservation. The railway-men had been\r\npatient under capitalistic oppression in the past; they were convincing\r\nnow in argument; and they were moderate in their demands for the future.\r\nIt was no \"Vae victis!\" that these sturdy wearers of green corduroy\r\ntrousers held out to their employers, but a cheery \"Come now, mates.\r\nFair does and we'll mess along somehow till the next strike.\"\r\n\r\nMr Drugget, M.P., introduced the deputation. It consisted of railway\r\nworkers of all the lower grades with the exception of clerks. After many\r\nineffectual attempts to get clerks to enter the existing Labour ring, it\r\nhad been seriously proposed by the Labour wirepullers (who loved them in\r\nspite of their waywardness, and would have saved them, and their votes\r\nand their weekly contribution, from themselves) that they should form a\r\nUnion of their own in conjunction with shop assistants and domestic\r\nservants. When the clerks (of whom the majority employed domestic\r\nservants directly or indirectly in their homes or in their lodgings)\r\nlaughed slightly at the proposal; when the shop assistants smiled\r\nself-consciously, and when the domestic servants giggled openly, the\r\npromoters of this amusing triple alliance cruelly left them to their\r\nfate thenceforward, pettishly declaring that all three were a set of\r\nsnobs--a designation which they impartially applied to every class of\r\nsociety except their own, and among themselves to every minute\r\nsubdivision of Labour except the one which they adorned.\r\n\r\nIt devolved upon a rising young \"greaser\" in the service of the Great\r\nNorthern to explain, as spokesman, the object of the visit. Under the\r\nexisting unfair conditions the directors of the various companies were\r\nelected at large salaries by that unnecessary and parasitic group, the\r\nshareholders, while the workmen--the true creators of every penny of\r\nincome--had no direct hand in the management of affairs. When they\r\nwished to approach the chief authorities it was necessary for them to\r\nsend delegates from their Union, who were frequently kept waiting ten\r\nminutes in an ante-room; and although of late years their demands were\r\npractically always conceded without demur, the position was anomalous\r\nand humiliating. What seemed only reasonable to them, then, was that\r\nthey should have the right to elect an equal number of directors from\r\namong themselves, who should sit on the Board with the other directors,\r\nhave equal powers, and receive similar salaries.\r\n\r\n\"To be, in fact, your permanent deputation to the Board,\" suggested the\r\nHome Secretary.\r\n\r\n\"That's it--with powers,\" replied the G. N. man.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be some soft jobs going--then,\" murmured a shunter, who was\r\ngetting on in years, reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"No need for the missis to take in young men lodgers if you get one, eh,\r\nBill?\" said his neighbour jocosely.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the extreme unlikelihood of his ever being made a\r\ndirector, or some other deeper cause, the secret history of the period\r\ndoes not say, but Bill turned upon his innocent friend in a very\r\naggressive mood.\r\n\r\n\"What d'yer mean--young men lodgers?\" he demanded warmly. \"What call\r\nhave you to bring that up? Come now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, mate,\" expostulated the offending one mildly, \"no one said\r\nanything to give any offence. What's the 'arm? Your missis does take in\r\nlodgers, same as plenty more, don't she? Well, then!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can take a 'int along the lines as well as any other,\" replied Bill\r\ndarkly. \"It's gone far enough between pals. See? I never said anything\r\nabout your sister leaving that there laundry, did I? Never, I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about it if you did?\" demanded the neighbour, growing hot in\r\nhis turn. \"I should think you'd have enough----\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" expostulated the glib young spokesman, as the\r\nvoices rose above the conversational whisper, \"let us have absolute\r\nunanimity, if _you_ please--expressed in the usual way, by all saying\r\nnothing together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha's matter with Bill?\" murmured the next delegate with polite\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me the little man is troubled with his teef,\" replied the\r\nunfortunate cause of the ill-feeling, with smouldering passion. \"Strike\r\nme if he isn't. Ah!\" And seeing the impropriety of relieving his\r\nfeelings in the usual way in a Cabinet Minister's private study, he\r\nrelapsed into bitter silence.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes having expressed his absolute approval of this detail of the\r\nprogramme, the second point was explained. Why, it was demanded, should\r\nthe provisions of the Employers' Liability Act apply only to the hours\r\nduring which a man was at work? Furthermore, why should they apply only\r\nto accidents? Supposing, said Mr William Mulch, the spokesman in\r\nquestion, that a bloke went out in a social way among his friends, as\r\nany bloke might, caught the small-pox, and got laid up for life with\r\nafter-effects, or died? Or suppose the bloke, after sweating through a\r\nday's work, went home dog-tired to his miserable hovel, and broke his\r\nleg falling over the carpet, or poisoned his hand opening a tin of\r\nsardines? They looked to the present Government to extend the working of\r\nthe Act so as to cover the disablement or death of employes from every\r\ncause whatever, natural death included, and wherever they might be at\r\nthe time. Under the present unfair and artificial conditions of labour,\r\nthe work-people were nothing but the slaves and chattels of capitalists,\r\nand it was manifestly unfair that the latter should escape their\r\nresponsibilities after exploiting a man's labour for their own greedy\r\nends, simply because he happened to die of hydrophobia or senile decay,\r\nor because the injury that disabled him was received outside the\r\nfoetid, insanitary den where in exchange for a bare sordid pittance\r\nhis flesh was ground from his bones for eight hours daily.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. gentleman expressed his entire concurrence with this\r\nprovision also, and roused considerable enthusiasm by mentioning that\r\nsome time ago he had independently arrived at the conclusion that such a\r\nclause was urgently required.\r\n\r\nBefore the next point was considered, Comrade Tintwistle asked\r\npermission to say a few words. He explained that he had no intention of\r\nintroducing a discordant note. On the contrary, he heartily supported\r\nthe proposal as far as it went, but--and here he wished to say that\r\nthough he only voiced the demands of a minority, it was a large, a\r\ngrowing, and a noisy minority--it did not go far enough. The contention\r\nof those he represented was that the responsibility of employers ought\r\nto extend to the wives and families of their work-people. Many a poor\r\ncomrade was sadly harassed by having to keep a crippled child who would\r\nnever be a bread-winner, or an ailing wife who was incapable of looking\r\nafter his home comfort properly. They were fighting over again the\r\nbattle that they had won in the matter of free meals for school\r\nchildren. It had taken years to convince people that it was equally\r\nnecessary that children who did not happen to be attending school should\r\nhave meals provided for them, and even more necessary to see that their\r\nmothers should be well nourished; it had taken even longer to arrive at\r\nthe logical conclusion that if free meals were requisite, free clothes\r\nwere not a whit less necessary. No one nowadays doubted the soundness of\r\nthat policy, yet here they were again timorously contemplating\r\nhalf-measures, while the insatiable birds of prey who sucked their blood\r\nlaughed in their sleeve at the spectacle of the British working men\r\nhiding their heads ostrich-like in the shifting quicksand of a fool's\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\nThe signs of approval that greeted this proposal showed clearly enough\r\nthat other members of the deputation had sympathetic leanings towards\r\nthe larger policy of the minority. Mr Tubes himself more than hinted at\r\nthe possibility of a personal conversion in the near future. \"In the\r\nmeantime,\" he remarked, \"everything is on your side. Your position is\r\nlogical, moderate, and just. All can admit that, although we may not all\r\nexactly agree as to whether the time is ripe for the measure. With every\r\ntemptation to wipe off some of the arrears of injustice of the past, we\r\nmust not go so far as to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you make that out?\" demanded an unsophisticated young signalman.\r\n\"It's the work of the people that produces every penny that circulates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just so,\" replied Tubes readily. \"That is the real point of the\r\nstory. It was the grains of corn that made the eggs, and the goose did\r\nnothing but sit and lay them. We must always have our geese.\" He turned\r\nto the subject in hand again with a laugh, and approved a few more\r\nmodest suggestions for abolishing \"privileges.\"\r\n\r\n\"The last point,\" continued the spokesman, \"is one that closely concerns\r\nthe principles that we all profess. I refer to the obsolete and\r\nhumiliating anachronism that with a Government pledged to the\r\nmaintenance of social equality in office, at any hour of the day, at\r\npractically every railway station throughout the land you will still see\r\ntrains subdivided as regards designation and accommodation into first,\r\nsecond, and third classes. It is a distinction which to us, as the\r\nrepresentatives of the so-called third class, is nothing more or less\r\nthan insulting. Why should me and my missis when we travel be compelled\r\nto sit where the accidents generally happen and have to put up with\r\neighteen in a compartment, when smug clerks and saucy ladies' maids, who\r\nare no better than us, enjoy the comparative luxury of only fifteen in a\r\ncompartment away from the collisions, and snide financiers and\r\nquestionable duchesses, who are certainly a good deal worse, sit in\r\npadded rooms, well protected front and rear, and never know what it is\r\nto be packed more than six a-side? If that isn't class distinction I\r\nshould like to know what is. It isn't--Gawd help us!--that we wish to\r\nmix with these people, or that we envy their position or covet their\r\nwealth. Such motives have never entered into the calculations of those\r\nwho have been foremost in Socialistic propaganda. But as thoughtful and\r\nself-respecting units of an integral community we object to being\r\nsegregated by the imposition of obsolete and arbitrary barriers, we do\r\nresent the artificial creation of social grades, and we regard with\r\nantagonism and distrust the unjust accumulation of labour-created wealth\r\nin the hands of the idle and incapable few.\r\n\r\n\"But if this is the standpoint of the great mass of the democracy, to us\r\nof the Amalgamated Unions of Railway Workers and Permanent Way Staffs\r\nthe invidious distinction has a closer significance. As ordinary\r\ncitizens our sense of equality is outraged by the demarcations I have\r\nreferred to; but as our work often places us in a temporary\r\nsubordination to the occupants of these so-called first and second\r\nclasses, whom we despise intellectually and resent economically, we\r\nincur the additional stigma of having to render them an external\r\ndeference which we recognise to be obsolete and servile. The Arden and\r\nAvon Valley case, which earned the martyrdom of dismissal for William\r\nJukson and ultimately involved forty thousand of us in a now historic\r\nstrike, simply because that heroic man categorically refused to the\r\ndoddering Duke of Pentarlington any other title than the honourable\r\nappellation of 'Comrade,' is doubtless still fresh within your minds. We\r\nlost on that occasion through insufficiency of funds, but the ducal\r\nportmanteau over which William Jukson took his memorable stand, will yet\r\nserve as a rallying point to a more successful issue.\"\r\n\r\nMr Mulch paused for approbation, which was not stinted, but before he\r\ncould resume, a passionate little man who had been rising to a more\r\nexalted state of fervour with every demand, suddenly hurled himself like\r\na human wedge into the forefront of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Kumrids!\" he exclaimed, breathless from the first, \"with your kind\r\npermission I would say a few words embodying a suggestion which, though\r\nnot actually included in the agenda, is quite in 'armony with the\r\nsubject before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't it keep?\" suggested a tired delegate hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"The suggestion is briefly this,\" continued the little man, far too\r\nenthusiastic to notice any interruption, \"that as a tribute to William\r\nJukson's sterling determination and as a perpetual reminder of the\r\nissues raised, we forthwith add to the banners of the Amalgamated Unions\r\none bearing an allegorical design consisting of two emblematic figures\r\nstruggling for the possession of a leather portmanteau with the words\r\n'No Surrender!' beneath. The whole might be made obvious to a person of\r\nthe meanest intelligence by the inscription 'A. and A. V. Ry. Test Case.\r\nW. J. upholds the Principles of Social Democracy and Vindicates the\r\nPeople's Rights,' running round.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he be running round?\" asked a slow-witted member of the\r\ndeputation.\r\n\r\n\"Who running round?\" demanded the last speaker, amenable to outside\r\ninfluence now that he had said his say.\r\n\r\n\"William Jukson. Didn't you say he was to be on this banner vindicating\r\nthe people's rights running round? He stood there on the platform, man\r\nto man, so I've always heard.\"\r\n\r\nThe redoubtable Jukson's champion cast a look of ineffable contempt upon\r\nhis simple brother and made a gesture expressive of despair. \"That's\r\nall,\" he said, and sat down.\r\n\r\nMr Mulch resumed his interrupted innings. \"The suggestion will doubtless\r\nreceive attention if submitted through the proper channels,\" he remarked\r\na little coldly. It was one thing to take the indomitable Jukson under\r\nhis own aegis; quite another to countenance his canonisation at a period\r\nwhen strenuous candidates were more numerous than remunerative niches.\r\n\"But to revert to the subject in hand from which we have strayed\r\nsomewhat. It only remains for me to say that all artificial distinctions\r\nbetween class and class are distasteful to the people at large,\r\ndetestable to the powerful Unions on whose behalf we are here to-day,\r\nand antagonistic to the interests of the community. We confidently look,\r\ntherefore, to the present Government to put an end to a state of things\r\nthat is inconsistent with the maintenance of practical Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nTowards this proposal, also, Mr Tubes turned a friendly ear, but he\r\nadmitted that in practice his sympathies must be purely platonic, for\r\nthe time at least. In truth, the revenue yielded by the taxation of\r\nfirst and second class tickets was so considerable that it could not be\r\nignored. Many people adopted the third class rather than suffer the\r\nexaction, and the receipts of all the railway companies in the kingdom\r\nfell considerably--to the great delight of that large section of the\r\nSocialistic party that had not yet begun to think. But the majority of\r\nthe wealthy still paid the price, and not a few among the weak, aged,\r\nand timorous, among children, old men, and ladies, were driven to the\r\nsuperior classes which they could ill afford by the increased difficulty\r\nof finding a seat elsewhere, and by the growing truculence of the\r\nworkmen who were thrust upon them in the thirds. For more than a decade\r\nit had been observed that when a seat in tram or train was at stake the\r\nage of courtesy was past, but a new Burke, listening to the conversation\r\nof those around, might too frequently have cause to think that the age\r\nof decency had faded also. Another development, contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of the higher classes, was the fact that one was as heavily\r\nmulcted if he turned to any of the other forms of more exclusive\r\ntravelling. Private carriages of all kinds were the butt of each\r\nsucceeding Budget, even bicycles (unless owned by workmen) were not\r\nexempt; and so heavily was the Chancellor's hand laid upon motor cars\r\n(except such as were the property of Members of Parliament) that even\r\nthe Marquis of Kingsbery was satisfied, and withdrew his threat to haunt\r\nthe Portsmouth Road with an elephant gun.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite the persistence of a Stuart in imposing taxation and\r\nthe instincts of a Vespasian in making it peculiarly offensive, the\r\nTreasury was always in desperate straits. The reason was not far to\r\nseek. In the old days Liberal governments had at times proved\r\nextravagant; Tory governments had perhaps oftener proved even more\r\nextravagant; but in each case it was the tempered profusion of those who\r\nthrough position and education were too careless to count their pence\r\nand too unconcerned to be dazzled by their pounds. The Labour and the\r\nSocialist administrations proved superlatively extravagant: and there is\r\nnothing more irredeemable than the spendthrift recklessness of your\r\nnavvy who has unexpectedly \"come into money.\" The beggar was truly on\r\nhorseback, or, to travel with the times, he had set off in his motor\r\ncar, and he was now bowling along the great high-road towards the\r\ncliff-bound sea of national perdition, a very absent-minded beggar\r\nindeed, with a merry hand upon the high speed gear.\r\n\r\n\"I am with you heart and soul,\" therefore declared Mr Tubes as a man,\r\nand as a member of the Cabinet added--\"in principle. But the\r\ncontemplated Act for providing State maintenance of strikers, in strikes\r\napproved of by the Board of Trade, makes it extremely undesirable to\r\nabolish any of the existing sources of revenue, at least until we see\r\nwhat the measure will involve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save on the Navy, then,\" growled a malcontent in the rear rank.\r\n\r\n\"We have already reduced the Navy to the fullest extent that we consider\r\nit desirable to go at present; that is to say, to the common-sense\r\nlimit--equality with any one of the other leading powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Army, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have already reduced the Army very considerably, but with a navy on\r\nthe lines which I have indicated and an army traditionally weaker at the\r\nbest than those of the great military powers, which are also naval\r\npowers, is it prudent?\" The gesture that closed the sentence clearly\r\nexpressed Mr Tubes's own misgivings on the subject. He had always been\r\nregarded as a moderate though a vacillating man among his party, and the\r\n\"reduce everything and chance it\" policy of a powerful section of the\r\nCabinet disturbed his rest at times.\r\n\r\n\"Why halt ye between two opinions?\" exclaimed a clear and singularly\r\nsweet voice from the doorway. \"Temporise not with the powers of darkness\r\nwhen the day of opportunity is now at hand. Sweep away arms and armies,\r\nengines of war and navies, in one vast and irresistible wave of\r\nUniversal Brotherhood. Beat the swords into ploughshares, cast your guns\r\ninto instruments of music, let all strife cease. Extend the hand of\r\nfriendship and equality not only man to man and class to class, but\r\nnation to nation and race to race. Make a great feast, and in love and\r\nfellowship compel them to come in: so shall you inaugurate the reign of\r\nChrist anew on earth.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one looked at the speaker and then glanced at his neighbour with\r\namusement, contempt, enquiry, here and there something of approval, in\r\nhis eye. \"The Mad Parson,\" \"Brother Ambrose,\" \"The Ragged Priest,\" \"St\r\nAmbrose of Shadwell,\" ran from lip to lip as a few recognised the\r\ntonsured barefoot figure standing in his shabby cassock by the door. Mr\r\nTubes alone, seated out of the range of whispers and a victim to the\r\ndefective sight that is the coal-pit heritage throughout the world,\r\nreceived no inkling of his identity, and, assuming that he was a late\r\narrival of the deputation, sought to extend a gentle conciliation.\r\n\r\n\"The goal of complete disarmament is one that we never fail to strive\r\nfor,\" he accordingly replied, \"but our impulsive comrade must admit that\r\nthe present is hardly the moment for us to make the experiment entirely\r\non our own. Prudence----\"\r\n\r\n\"Prudence!\" exclaimed the ragged priest with flashing vehemence. \"There\r\nis no more cowardly word in the history of that Black Art which you call\r\nStatecraft. All your wars, all your laws, all tyranny, injustice,\r\ninhumanity, all have their origin in a fancied prudence. It marks the\r\ndownward path in whitened milestones more surely than good intentions\r\npave that same decline. Dare! dare! dare! man. Dare to love your\r\nbrother. Herod was prudent when he sought to destroy all the children of\r\nBethlehem; it was prudence that led Pilate to deliver up our Master to\r\nthe Jews. The deadly _ignis fatuus_ of prudence marched and\r\ncounter-marched destroying armies from the East and from the West\r\nthrough every age, formed vast coalitions and dissolved them\r\ntreacherously, made dynasties and flung them from the throne. It led\r\npagan Rome, it illumined the birth of a faith now choked in official\r\nbonds, it danced before stricken Europe, lit the martyrs' fires, lured\r\nthe cold greed of commerce, and now hangs a sickly beacon over\r\nWestminster. But prudence never raised the fallen Magdalene nor forgave\r\nthe dying thief. Christ was not _prudent_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ, who's 'e?\" said a man who had a reputation for facetiousness to\r\nmaintain. \"Oh! I remember. _He's_ been dead a long time.\"\r\n\r\nAmbrose turned on him the face that led men and the eye that quelled.\r\n\"My brother,\" he almost whispered across the room, \"if you die with that\r\nin your heart it were better for you that He had never lived.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in the voice, the look, the presence, that checked\r\nthe ready methods by which a hostile intruder was wont to be expelled.\r\nAll recognised a blind inspired devotion beside which their own party\r\nenthusiasm was at the best pale and thin. Even to men who were wholly\r\nindifferent to the forms of religion, Ambrose's self-denying life, his\r\nascetic discipline, his fanatical whole-heartedness, his noble--almost\r\nroyal--family, and the magnetic influence which he exercised over masses\r\nof the most wretched of the poor and degraded gave pause for thought,\r\nand often extorted a grudging regard. Not a few among those who had\r\ndispassionately watched the rise and fall of parties held the opinion\r\nthat the man might yet play a wildly prominent part in the nation's\r\ndestinies and involve a tragedy that could only yet be dimly guessed:\r\nfor most men deemed him mad.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you may wish to say this is neither the time nor the place,\"\r\nsaid Mr Drugget mildly. \"We are not taking part in a public meeting\r\nwhich invites discussion, but are here in a semi-private capacity to\r\nconfer with the Home Secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no time or place unseasonable to me, who come with Supreme\r\nauthority,\" replied Ambrose. \"Nor, if the man is worthy of his office,\r\ncan the Home Secretary close his ears to the representative of the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people!\" exclaimed a startled member of the Amalgamated Unions.\r\n\"What d'yer mean by the 'representative of the people'? _We_ are the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. We _are_ the people!\"\r\n\r\n\"You?\" replied Ambrose scornfully, sweeping the assembly with his eye\r\nand returning finally with a disconcerting gaze to the man who spoke,\r\n\"you smug, easy, well-fed, well-clad, well-to-do in your little way,\r\nself-satisfied band of Pharisees, _you_ the people of the earth! Are you\r\nthe poor, are you the meek, the hungry, the persecuted? You are the\r\ncomfortable, complacent _bourgeoisie_ of labourdom. You can never\r\ninherit the Kingdom of Christ on earth. Outside your gates, despised of\r\nall, stand His chosen people.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a low, rolling murmur of approval, growing in volume before it\r\ndied away, but it rose not within the chamber but from the road outside.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Tubes,\" whispered the introducer of the deputation uneasily, \"give\r\nthe word, sir. Shall we have this man put out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" muttered Tubes, with his eyes fixed on the window and turning\r\nslightly pale; \"wait a minute. Who are those outside?\"\r\n\r\nThe Member of Parliament looked out; others were looking too, and for a\r\nmoment not only their own business was forgotten, but the indomitable\r\npriest's outspoken challenge passed unheeded in a curious contemplation\r\nof his following. At that period the sight was a new one in the streets\r\nof London, though afterwards it became familiar enough, not only in the\r\nCapital, but to the inhabitants of every large town and city throughout\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nAmbrose had been called \"The Ragged Priest,\" and it was a very ragged\r\nregiment that formed his bodyguard; he was \"The Mad Parson,\" and an\r\nethereal mania shone in the faces of many of his followers, though as\r\nmany sufficiently betrayed the slum-bred cunning, the inborn brutishness\r\nof the unchanged criminal and the hooligan, thinly cloaked beneath a\r\nshifty mask of assumed humility. As became \"St Ambrose,\" the banners\r\nwhich here and there stood out above the ranks--mere sackcloth standards\r\nlashed to the roughest poles--nearly all bore religious references in\r\ntheir crude emblems and sprawling inscriptions. The gibes at charity,\r\nthe demands for work of an earlier decade had given place to another\r\nphase. \"Christ is mocked,\" was one; \"Having all things in common,\" ran\r\nanother; while \"As it was in the beginning,\" \"Equality, in Christ,\" \"Thy\r\nKingdom come,\" might frequently be seen. But a more significant note was\r\nstruck by an occasional threat veiled beneath a text, as \"The sun shall\r\nbe turned into darkness, the moon into blood,\" though their leader\r\nhimself never hinted violence in his most impassioned flights. Among the\r\nupturned faces a leisurely observer might have detected a few that were\r\nstill conspicuous in refinement despite their sordid settings--women\r\nchiefly, and for the most part fanatical converts who had been swept off\r\ntheir feet by Ambrose's eloquence in the more orthodox days when he had\r\nthrilled fashionable congregations from the pulpit of a Mayfair church.\r\nOther women there were in plenty; men, old and young; even a few\r\nchildren; dirty, diseased, criminal, brutalised, vicious, crippled, the\r\nunemployed, the unemployable. Beggars from the streets, begging on a\r\nbetter lay; thieves hopeful of a larger booty; malcontents of every\r\nphase; enemies of society reckoning on a day of reckoning; the\r\nunfortunate and the unfortunates swayed by vague yearnings after\r\nrighteousness; schemers striving for their private ends; with a salting\r\nof the simple-hearted; all held together so far by the vehement\r\npersonality of one fanatic, and glancing down the ranks one could\r\nprophesy what manner of monster out of the depths this might prove when\r\nit had reached rampant maturity. Poverty, abject poverty, was the\r\ndominant note; for all who marched beneath the ragged banner must go in\r\nrags.\r\n\r\nMr Drugget was the first to recover himself. \"Look here,\" he said,\r\nturning to Ambrose aggressively, \"I don't quite catch on to your game,\r\nbut that's neither here nor there. If you want to know what I call it, I\r\ncall it a bit of blasted impertinence to bring a mob like that to a\r\nman's private house, no matter who he may be. What's more, this is an\r\nunlawful gathering according to Act of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"That which breaks no divine commandment cannot be unlawful,\" replied\r\nAmbrose, unmoved. \"I recognise no other law. And you, who call\r\nyourselves Socialists and claim equality, what are your laws but the old\r\nprivileges which you denounced in others extended to include yourselves,\r\nwhat your equality but the spoliation of those above you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are practical Socialists,\" exclaimed one or two members with\r\ndignity. \"As reasonable men we recognise that there must be a limit\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Practical is the last thing you can claim to be. You are impractical\r\nvisionaries; for it would be as easy for a diver to pause in mid-air as\r\nfor mankind to remain at a half-way house to Equality. All! All! Every\r\nman-made distinction must be swept away. Neither proprietor nor\r\nproperty, paid leader nor gain, task-work nor pride of place; nothing\r\nbetween God and man's heart. That is the only practical Socialism, and\r\nit is at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not while we're in office,\" said the Home Secretary shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,\" cast back Ambrose. \"Where is now the\r\ngreat Unionist party? In a single season the sturdy Liberal stronghold\r\ncrumbled into dust. You deposed a Labour government that was deemed\r\ninvulnerable in its time. Beware, the hand is already on the wall. Those\r\nforces which you so blindly ignore will yet combine and crush you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not unlikely. In former times it would have required barricades\r\nand some personal bravery. But with universal suffrage the power of the\r\npauper criminal was no less than that of the ducal millionaire, and the\r\nalcohol lunatic, presenting himself at the poll between the spasms of\r\n_delirium tremens_, was as potent a force as the philosopher. A party\r\ncomposed of paupers, aliens, chronic unemployed, criminals, lunatics,\r\nunfortunates, the hysterical and degenerate of every kind, together with\r\nso many of the working classes as might be attracted by the glamour of a\r\nfinal and universal spoliation, led by a sincere and impassioned\r\nfirebrand, might yet have to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\n\"And you, comrade?\" said a railway-man with pardonable curiosity. \"When\r\nyou've had your little fling, who's going to turn _you_ out and come\r\nin?\"\r\n\r\n\"We!\" exclaimed Ambrose with a touch of genuine surprise; \"how can you\r\nbe so blind! We represent the ultimate destiny of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nIn another age and another place a form of government called the States\r\nGeneral, and largely composed of amiable clerics, had been called up to\r\nredress existing grievances. Being found too slow, it gave place to the\r\nNational Assembly, and, to go yet a little faster, became the\r\nLegislative Assembly. This in turn was left behind by the more\r\nexpeditious Girondins, but as even they lagged according to the bustling\r\ntimes, the Jacobins came into favour. The ultimate development of\r\nquick-change Equality was reached in the Hebertists. From one to another\r\nhad been but a step, and they were all \"The People\"; but while the\r\nStates General had looked for the millennium by the abolition of a\r\ngrievance here and there, and the lightening of a chafing collar in the\r\nmass, the followers of Hebert found so little left for them to abolish\r\nthat they abolished God. The experiment convinced the sagest of the\r\nleaders that human equality is only to be found in death, and, true to\r\ntheir principles, they \"equalised\" a million of their fellow-countrymen\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the guillotine, and other forms of moral\r\nsuasion. Grown more tender-hearted, \"The People\" no longer thirsted for\r\nanother section of \"The People's\" blood--only for their money; and in\r\nplace of Fouquier-Tinville and the Gentleman with the Wooden Frame,\r\ntheir instruments of justice were represented by a Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and an individual delivering blue papers.\r\n\r\n\"We represent the ultimate destiny of mankind: absolute equality,\"\r\nannounced Ambrose. \"Any other condition is inconsistent with the\r\nprofessions to which your party has repeatedly pledged itself. Will you,\r\nmy brother,\" he continued, addressing himself to the Home Secretary,\r\n\"receive a deputation?\"\r\n\r\nThe deputation was already waiting at the outer door, three men and\r\nthree women. It included a countess, a converted house-breaker, and an\r\nanarchist who had become embittered with life since the premature\r\nexplosion of one of his bombs had blown off both his arms and driven him\r\nto subsist on the charitable. The other three were uninteresting\r\nnonentities, but all were equal in their passion for equality.\r\n\r\n\"We are all pledged to the principle of social equality, and every step\r\nin that direction that comes within the range of practical politics must\r\nhave our sympathy,\" replied Mr Tubes. \"Further than that I am not\r\nprepared to commit myself at present. That being the case, there would\r\nbe no object in receiving a deputation.\" To this had Mr Tubes come at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"The unending formula,\" said Brother Ambrose with weary bitterness. \"...\r\nBread, and you give them stones ... Man,\" he cried with sudden energy,\r\n\"almost within your grasp lies the foundation of New Jerusalem,\r\ntranquil, smiling, sinless. What stands in your way? Nothing, nothing!\r\ntruly nothing but the heavy shadow of the old and cruel past. Throw it\r\noff; is it not worth doing? No more spiritual death, no more sorrow of\r\nthe things of this world, nor crying, 'Neither shall there be any more\r\npain: for the former things are passed away.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing more to say,\" responded the Home Secretary coldly,\r\nbending over his desk to write.\r\n\r\n\"Then I have much more to do,\" retorted Ambrose impetuously, \"and that\r\nshall be with the sword of my mouth.\" He strode from the room with an\r\nair that no amount of legislative equality could ever confer upon any of\r\nthose he left behind, and a moment later his ragged escort was in motion\r\nhomeward--slumward.\r\n\r\n\"Kumreds,\" said Mr Tubes, looking up, \"the harmony of the occasion has\r\nbeen somewhat impaired by an untoward incident, but on the whole I think\r\nthat you may rest well satisfied with the result of your\r\nrepresentations. Having another appointment I must now leave you, but I\r\nhave given instructions for some beer and sandwidges to be brought in,\r\nand I trust that in my enforced absence you will all make yourselves\r\nquite at home.\" He shook hands with each man present and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"Beer and sandwidges!\" muttered Comrade Tintwistle, with no affectation\r\nof delight, to a chosen spirit. \"And this is the man we pay fifty quid a\r\nweek to!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" assented the friend, following Mr Tubes's hospitable directions by\r\nstrolling round the room and fingering the ornaments. \"Well, when it\r\ncomes to a general share-out I don't know but what I should mind having\r\nthis here little round barometer for my parlour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neat little thing,\" assented Tintwistle with friendly interest. \"What\r\ndoes it say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to be dropping from 'Change' to 'Stormy,'\" read the friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMISS LISLE TELLS A LONG POINTLESS STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Hampden lived within a stone-throw of the Marble Arch; George\r\nSalt had established himself in Westminster; and about midway between\r\nthe two, in the neighbourhood of Pall Mall, a convenient but quite\r\nunostentatious suite of offices had been taken and registered as the\r\nheadquarters of the Unity League.\r\n\r\nThe Unity League was a modern organisation that had come into existence\r\nsuddenly, and with no great parade, within a week of that day when\r\nGeorge Salt had forced Hampden to hear what he wished to say, a day now\r\nnearly two years ago. The name was simple and commonplace, and therefore\r\nit aroused neither curiosity nor suspicion; it was explained by the fact\r\nthat it had only one object: \"By constitutional means to obtain an\r\nadequate representation of the middle and upper classes in Parliament,\"\r\na phrase rendered by the lighter-hearted members colloquially as \"To\r\nkick out the Socialists.\" The Government, quite content to govern\r\nconstitutionally (in the wider sense) and to be attacked\r\nconstitutionally (in the narrower sense), treated the existence of the\r\nUnity League as a playful ebullition on the part of the milch sections\r\nof society, and raised the minimum income-tax to four and threepence as\r\na sedative.\r\n\r\nAt first the existence of the League met with very little response and\r\nno enthusiasm among those for whom it was intended. It had become an\r\narticle of faith with the oppressed classes that no propagandism could\r\never restore an equitable balance of taxation. Every change must\r\ninevitably tend to be worse than the state before. To ask the working\r\nclasses (the phrase lingered; by the demarcation of taxation it meant\r\njust what it conventionally means to-day, and, similarly, it excluded\r\nclerical workers of all grades)--to ask this privileged class which\r\ndominated practically every constituency to throw out their own people\r\nand put in a party whose avowed policy would be to repeal the Employers'\r\nLiability Act (Extended), the Strikes Act, the Unemployed Act, the\r\nAmended Companies Act, the Ecclesiastical Property Act, the infamous\r\nNecessity Act, and a score of other preposterous Acts of Injustice\r\nbefore they even gave their attention to anything else, had long been\r\nrecognised to be grotesque. A League, therefore, which spoke of working\r\ntowards freedom on constitutional lines fell flat. The newspapers\r\nnoticed it in their various individual fashions, and all but the\r\nGovernment organs extended to it a welcome of cold despair. The general\r\nreader gathered the impression that he might look for its early demise.\r\n\r\nThe first revulsion of opinion came when it was understood that Sir John\r\nHampden had returned to public life as the President of the League. What\r\nhis name meant to his contemporaries, how much the League gained from\r\nhis association, may be scarcely realised in an age existing under\r\ndifferent and more conflicting conditions. Briefly, his personality\r\nlifted the effort into the plane--not of a national movement, for with\r\nthe nation so sharply riven by two irreconcilable interests that was\r\nimpossible, but certainly beyond all cavil as to motives and methods.\r\nWhen it was further known that he was not lending his name\r\nhalf-heartedly as to a forlorn hope, or returning reluctantly as from a\r\ntardy sense of duty, men began to wonder what might lie behind.\r\n\r\nThe first public meeting of the newly formed League deepened the\r\nimpression. Men and women of the middle and upper classes were invited\r\nto become members. The annual subscription being a guinea, none but\r\nadults were expected. Those of the working class were not invited. If\r\nthe subscription seemed large, the audience was asked to remember what\r\nlay at stake, and to compare with it the case of the artisan cheerfully\r\ncontributing his sixpence a week to the strike fund of his class. \"As a\r\nresult there is a Strikes Act now in force,\" the President reminded\r\nthem, \"and the artisan no longer pays the cost----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we do,\" interjected a listener.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you to pay it for three years longer; no more, perhaps less,\"\r\nreplied Hampden with a reassuring smile, and his audience stared.\r\n\r\nIf the subscription seemed large for an organisation of the kind the\r\naudience was assured that it was by no means all, or even the most, that\r\nwould be expected of them. They must be prepared to make some sacrifice\r\nwhen called upon; the nature he could not indicate at that early stage.\r\nNo balance sheet would be published; no detailed reports would be\r\nissued. There would be no dances, no garden-parties, no club houses, no\r\npretty badges. The President warned them that membership offered no\r\nfacilities for gaining a precarious footing in desirable society,\r\nthrough the medium of tea on the Vicarage lawn, or croquet in the Home\r\nPark. \"We are not playing at tin politics nowadays,\" he caustically\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\nThat closed the exordium. In a different vein Hampden turned to review\r\nthe past, and with the chartered freedom of the man who had prophesied\r\nit all, he traced in broad lines and with masterly force the course of\r\nConservative ineptitude, Radical pusillanimity, Labour selfishness, and\r\nSocialistic tyranny. What would be the crowning phase of grab\r\ngovernment? History foreshadowed it; common-sense certified it. Before\r\nthe dark curtain of that last stupendous act the wealth and wisdom, the\r\ndignity and responsibility of the nation, stood in paralysed expectancy.\r\n\r\nThere was a telling pause; a dramatic poignant silence hung over the\r\nmassed crowd that listened to the one man who could still inspire a\r\nkindling spark of hope. Then, just at the opportune moment, a friendly\r\nchallenge gave the effective lead:\r\n\r\n\"And what does Sir John Hampden offer now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolute victory,\" replied the speaker, with the thrilling energy of\r\nquiet but assured conviction, \"and with it the ending of this nightmare\r\ndream of life in which we are living now, when every man in his\r\nhalf-guilty helplessness shuns his own thoughts, and all are filled with\r\na new unnatural pain: the shame of being Englishmen. Blink the fact or\r\nnot, it is civil war upon which we are now engaged. Votes are the\r\nweapons, and England and her destiny, nothing more or less, are the\r\nstakes. It has frequently been one of the curious features even of the\r\nmost desperate civil struggles of the past, that while battles were\r\nraging all around, towns besieged, and thrones falling, commerce was at\r\nthe same time being carried on as usual, wordy controversies on trivial\r\nalien subjects were being hotly discussed by opposing sections, as\r\nthough their pedantic differences were the most serious matters in the\r\nworld, and the ordinary details of everyday life were proceeding as\r\nbefore. So it is to-day, but civil, social, war is in our midst,\r\nand--again blink it or not--we are losing, and wage it as it is being\r\nwaged we shall continue to lose. I am not here to-day to urge the\r\njustice of our cause, to palliate unwise things done, to indulge in\r\nregrets for wise things left undone. One does not discuss diplomacy in\r\nthe middle of a battle. I am here to hold out a new hope for the triumph\r\nof our cause, for the revival of an era of justice, for the recovered\r\nrespect of nations. I have never been accused of undue optimism, yet\r\nfully weighing my words, I stand on this platform to-night to share with\r\nyou my conviction that it is within our power, in three years' time, to\r\nsend an overwhelming majority of our reconstructed party into power, to\r\nreduce the income-tax to a sane and normal level, and to recommence the\r\nbuilding up of a treasonably neglected navy.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man--perhaps any other man--would have been met by ridicule, but\r\nHampden's reputation was unique. The one point of emphasis that could\r\nnot fail to impress itself upon every listener was that there _was_\r\nsomething behind all this. It was a point that did not convey itself\r\nhalf so forcefully in the newspaper reports, so that, as Socialists and\r\ntheir friends did not attend the meetings (even as members of the\r\nwealthier classes had ignored Socialistic \"vapourings\" in days gone by),\r\nany menace to the Government that the League might contain was lost on\r\nthem for the present. It was the moral of an old fable: the Dog in\r\nLuxury grown slothful and unready.\r\n\r\nThe subscription deterred few. It was an epoch when everything was,\r\napparently, being given away for nothing; though never had the\r\ngrandfatherly maxim that in business nothing ever is offered without its\r\nprice, been so keenly observed. But superficially, to ride in a penny\r\n'bus entitled one to a probable pension for life; to buy a pound of tea\r\nwas only the preliminary to being presented with a motor-car or a grand\r\npiano. Fortunes lurked in cigarette boxes, whole libraries sprang\r\ngratuitously from the columns of the daily papers; not only oxen, but\r\nsilver spoons inexhaustible were compressed within the covers of each\r\njar of meat extract, and buried treasure, \"Mysterious Millionaires,\" and\r\n\"Have-you-that-ten-pound-note?\" men littered the countryside. To be\r\nasked to subscribe a guinea for nothing definite in return, was\r\ntherefore a pleasing novelty which took amazingly. So, too, the idea of\r\nparticipating in some sort of legal revolution which would entail\r\nsacrifices and result in unexpected developments, was found to be\r\ndelightfully invigorating. How the movement spread is a matter of\r\nhistory. Incomes had been reduced wholesale, yet, so great was the\r\nconfidence in Hampden's name, that many members sent their subscription\r\nten times told. When he asked, as he frequently did at the close of a\r\nmeeting, for recruits who were willing to devote their whole time unpaid\r\nto the work in various departments, more than could be accepted were\r\ninvariably forthcoming. All members proselytised on their own\r\ninitiative, but within these there were thousands of quiet and devoted\r\nworkers who were in close touch with the office of the League. They\r\nacted on detailed instructions in their methods, and submitted regular\r\nreports of progress and of the state of public feeling in every part of\r\nthe kingdom and among every class of the community. To what length the\r\nroll of membership had now extended only two men knew, even\r\napproximately. All that could be used as a guide was the fact that it\r\nwas the exception rather than the rule anywhere to find a family among\r\nthe classes aimed at, that did not contain at least one member; while\r\nLondon, within the same indicated limits, had practically gone solid for\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nAnd George Salt? The public knew nothing of him; his name did not appear\r\nin connection with the League, nor did he ever take a place among the\r\nnotables upon the platform at its meetings. But the thousands of the\r\ninner ring knew him very well, and few whose business led them to the\r\noffices missed encountering him. He was officially supposed to be a\r\nLeague secretary to Sir John Hampden, endowed with large discretionary\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this chapter opens he was receiving in his office a\r\nrepresentative of the leading Government organ: a daily paper which\r\npurveyed a mixture of fervent demagogism and child-like inconsistency,\r\nfor the modest sum of one halfpenny. _The Tocsin_, as it was called, was\r\nwidely read by a public who believed every word it contained, with that\r\nsimple credulity in what is printed which is one of the most pathetic\r\nfeatures of the semi-illiterate.\r\n\r\nMr Hammet, the representative of _The Tocsin_, had come to find out what\r\nwas really behind the remarkable spread of the Unity League. Possibly\r\nmembers of the Government were beginning to fidget. Salt had seen him\r\nfor the purpose of telling him everything else that he cared to know. To\r\nenquirers, the officials of the League were always candid and open, and\r\nlaughingly disclaimed any idea of a mysterious secret society. So Salt\r\nadmitted that they really hoped for a change of public opinion shortly;\r\nthat they based their calculation on the inevitable swing of the\r\npendulum, and so forth. He allowed it to be drawn easily from him that\r\nthey had great faith in party organisation, and that perhaps--between\r\nthemselves and not for publication--the Government would be surprised by\r\na substantial lowering of their majority at the next election, as a\r\nresult of quiet, unostentatious \"spade work.\" \"As a party we are not\r\nsatisfied with the state of things,\" he said. \"We cannot be expected to\r\nbe satisfied with it, and we are certainly relying on a stronger\r\nrepresentation in opposition to make our views felt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" said Mr Hammet sympathetically. He closed the note-book\r\nin which he had made a few entries and put it away, to indicate that his\r\nvisit was officially at an end, and whatever passed between them now was\r\nsimply one private gentleman talking to another, and might be regarded\r\nas sacredly confidential. Salt also relaxed the secretarial manner which\r\nhe had taken the pains to acquire, and seemed as though he would be glad\r\nof a little human conversation with a man who knew life and Fleet\r\nStreet: which meant, of course, that both were prepared to be\r\nparticularly alert.\r\n\r\n\"I was at one of your meetings the other night--the Albert Hall one,\"\r\nremarked the newspaper man casually. \"Your Chief fairly took the crowd\r\nwith him. No being satisfied with a strong opposition for him! Why, he\r\nwent bald-headed for sweeping the country and going in with a couple of\r\nhundred majority or so.\"\r\n\r\nSalt laughed appreciatively. \"No good being down-hearted,\" he replied.\r\n\"That was the end of all the old organisations. 'We see no hope for the\r\nfuture, so you all may as well mark time,' was their attitude, and they\r\ndropped out. 'When anything turns up we intend being ready for it, so\r\ncome in now,' we say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to take all right too,\" admitted Mr Hammet. \"I was offered a\r\nlevel dollar by a friend of mine the other day that you had over half a\r\nmillion members. I took it in a sporting spirit, because I know that\r\nhalf a million needs a lot of raking in, and I put it at rather less\r\nmyself--but, of course, as you are close about it we can never settle\r\nup.\" Half a million, it may be observed, was everybody's property, as an\r\nestimate on \"excellent authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't publish figures, as a matter of fact,\" admitted Salt\r\nhalf-reluctantly, \"but I don't know why there should be any very\r\nparticular secret about it----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, every office has its cupboards and its skeletons,\" said Mr Hammet\r\ngenerously. \"But if one could see inside,\" he added with a knowing look,\r\n\"I think that I should win.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" exclaimed Salt suddenly. \"I don't mind telling you in confidence.\r\nWe have passed the half million: passed it last--well, some time ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for me that it is in confidence,\" remarked the pressman with a\r\ngrimace, \"or I should have to pay up. What is the exact figure, then?\"\r\nhe ventured carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"No one could quite tell you that,\" replied Salt, equally off-hand.\r\n\r\n\"Six hundred thousand?\" suggested Mr Hammet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is a considerable advance,--a hundred thousand,\" admitted Salt\r\nwith transparent disappointment. It is not pleasant when you have\r\nimpressed your man to have him expecting too much the next minute.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of the old Buttercup League,\" said Mr Hammet. \"You took\r\nthe remains over, lock, stock, and barrel, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all that would come. Half belonged to your party really, and half\r\nof the remainder were children. What an organisation that was in its\r\ntime! A million and a half!\" The smart young newspaper man noted Mr\r\nSalt's open admiration for these figures. It convinced him that the\r\nnewer League was not yet within measurable distance of half that total.\r\n\r\n\"And in the end it did--what?\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nSalt was bound to apologise. \"What is there to do, after all?\" he\r\nadmitted. \"What can you do but keep your people together, show them\r\nwhere their interest lies, and wait?\"\r\n\r\n\"And rake in the shekels?\" suggested Mr Hammet airily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that!\" agreed Salt a little uneasily. \"Of course one has to look\r\nafter the finances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ra-ther,\" agreed Mr Hammet. \"Wish I had the job. Do you smoke here as a\r\ngeneral thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" replied Salt, who never did. \"Try one of these.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fairish cigars. Better than you'd find in the old man's private box up\r\nat our show,\" was the verdict. \"But then we haven't a revenue of half a\r\nmillion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I rely on you not to say anything about our numbers,\" said\r\nthe secretary anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe visitor made a reassuring gesture, expressive of inviolable secrecy.\r\n\"Though I suppose you have to make a return for income-tax purposes,\" he\r\nmused. \"My aunt! what an item you must have!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Salt. \"We do not pay anything.\"\r\n\r\nMr Hammet stared in incredulous surprise. \"How do you manage to work\r\nit?\" he demanded familiarly. \"You don't mean that they have forgotten\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it's quite simple,\" explained Salt. \"Your friends made the funds\r\nand incomes of Trades Unions sacred against claims and taxes of every\r\nkind a few years ago, and we rank as a Trade Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't call them my friends, please God,\" exclaimed Mr Hammet with\r\ningratiating disloyalty. \"I work as in a house of bondage. You don't\r\npublish any balance-sheet, by the way, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't see why we should let every one know how the money is\r\nbeing spent. No matter how economically things are carried on there are\r\nalways some who want to interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially if they sampled your weeds,\" suggested the visitor\r\npleasantly. \"Pretty snug cribs you must have, but that's not my\r\nbusiness. Between ourselves, what does Sir John draw a year?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" protested Salt eagerly, too eagerly. \"As President of the\r\nLeague he does not receive a penny.\"\r\n\r\nSharp Mr Hammet, who prided himself upon being a terror for exposures\r\nand on having a record of seven flagrant cases of contempt of court,\r\nread the secretary's eagerness like an open book. \"But then there are\r\nCommittees, Sub-committees, Executives, Emergency Funds, and what not,\"\r\nhe pointed out, \"and our unpaid League President may be Chairman of one,\r\nand Secretary of another, and Grand Master of a third with a royal\r\nsalary from each, eh? Can you assure me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well; of course,\" admitted Salt, cornered beyond prevarication,\r\n\"that is a private matter that has to do with the officials of the\r\nLeague alone. But you may take it from me that every one in these\r\noffices earns his salary whatever it may be.\"\r\n\r\nMr Hammet smiled his polite acquiescence broadly.\r\n\r\n\"Same here, changing the scene of action to Stonecutter Street,\" he\r\ncommented. \"Do you happen to know how Sir John came to start this\r\naffair? Well, Tagg M.P. met Miss Hampden once and wanted to marry her.\r\nHe called on Sir John, who received him about as warmly as a shoulder of\r\nCanterbury lamb even before he knew what his business was. When he did\r\nknow, he gave such an exhibition of sheet lightning that Tagg, who is\r\nreally a very level-headed young fellow in general, completely lost his\r\nnerve and tried to dazzle him into consenting, by offering him a safe\r\nseat in the Huddersfield division and a small place in the Government if\r\nhe'd consent to put up as a bracketted Imperialist hyphened Socialist.\r\nThen the old man kicked Tagg out of the house, and swore to do the same\r\nwith his Government within three years. At least that's what I heard\r\nabout the time, but very likely there isn't a word of truth in it;\" a\r\ntolerably safe inference on Mr Hammet's part, as, in point of fact, he\r\nhad concocted Mr Tagg's romance on the spur of the moment.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" volunteered Salt. \"I don't think that that is the true story, or I\r\nshould have heard something about it. It's rather curious that you\r\nshould have mentioned it. I believe----But it's scarcely worth taking\r\nup your time with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all: I mean that I am quite interested,\" protested Mr Hammet.\r\n\r\n\"Well--of course it sounds rather absurd in the broad light of day, but\r\nI believe, as a matter of fact, that he was led into founding the League\r\nsimply as the result of a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dream!\" exclaimed Mr Hammet, deeply surprised. \"What sort of a\r\ndream?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it naturally must have been a rather extraordinary dream to\r\naffect him so strongly. In fact you might perhaps call it a vision.\"\r\n\r\n\"A vision!\" repeated Mr Hammet, thoroughly absorbed in the mysterious\r\nelement thus brought in. \"Do I understand that this is Sir John's own\r\nexplanation?\" Hampden's sudden return to activity had, indeed, from time\r\nto time been a riddle of wide interest.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" Salt hastened to correct. \"I expect that he would be the last\r\nman to admit it, or to offer any explanation at all. Of course the\r\nhistory of the world has been changed in every age through dreams and\r\nvisions, but that explanation nowadays, in a weighty matter, would run\r\nthe risk of being thought trivial and open to ridicule.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you base your deductions upon, then?\" demanded Mr Hammet,\r\nrather fogged by the serious introduction of this new light. \"Is Sir\r\nJohn a believer in clairvoyance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that I must not state the real grounds for several reasons,\r\nif you won't think me discourteous,\" replied Salt firmly. \"But this I\r\nmay say: that I had occasion to see Sir John late one night, and then he\r\nhad not the faintest intention of coming forward. Early the following\r\nmorning I saw him again, and by that time the whole affair was cut and\r\ndried. Of course you are at liberty to confirm or contradict the story\r\njust as you like, if you should happen to come across it again.\"\r\n\r\nIn a state of conscious bewilderment through which he was powerless to\r\nassert himself, Mr Hammet submitted to polite dismissal. The visible\r\nresult of his interview was half a column of peptonised personalities in\r\n_The Tocsin_, rendered still easier of assimilation to the dyspeptic\r\nmind by being well cut up into light paragraphs and garnished with\r\nsub-headings throughout. The unseen result, except to the privileged\r\neyes of half a dozen people, was a confidential report which found its\r\nway ultimately into the desk of the Home Secretary. The following points\r\nsummarised Mr Hammet's deductions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Unity League probably has a membership of half a million. It may be\r\nsafely assumed that it does not exceed that figure by a hundred thousand\r\nat the most.\r\n\r\n\"While largely recruiting by the device of holding out a suggestion of\r\nsome indefinite and effective political scheme, the policy of the League\r\nwill be that of _laisser faire_, and its influence may be safely\r\nignored. Very little of its vast income is spent in propagandism or\r\norganisation. On the contrary, there is the certainty that considerable\r\nsums are lying at short notice at the banks, and strong evidence that\r\nequally large sums have been sent out of the country through the agency\r\nof foreign houses.\r\n\r\n\"Many men of so-called 'good position' enjoy obvious sinecure posts\r\nunder the League, and all connected with the organisation appear to draw\r\nsalaries disproportionate to their positions, and in some cases wildly\r\ndisproportionate.\r\n\r\n\"The plain inference from the bulk of evidence is that the League is,\r\nand was formed to be, the preserve for a number of extravagant and\r\nincapable unemployed of the so-called upper and upper-middle classes,\r\nwho have organised this means of increasing their incomes to balance the\r\ndiminution which they have of late years experienced through the\r\nequalising legislation of Socialism. The money sent abroad is doubtless\r\na reserve for a few of the higher officials to fall back on if future\r\ncontingencies drive them out of this country.\r\n\r\n\"This information has been carefully derived from a variety of sources,\r\nincluding John Hampden's secretary, a man called Salt. Salt appears to\r\nbe a simple, unsuspicious sort of fellow, and with careful handling\r\nmight be used as a continual means of securing information in the future\r\nshould there be any necessity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe simple, unsuspicious secretary had dismissed Mr Hammet with scarcely\r\nanother thought as soon as that gentleman had departed. In order to fit\r\nhimself for the requirements of his new sphere of action, Salt had,\r\nduring the past two years, compelled himself to acquire that art of\r\nready speech which we are told is the most efficient safeguard of our\r\nthoughts. But he hated it. Most of all he despised the necessity of\r\nengaging in such verbal chicane as Mr Hammet's mission demanded. Of that\r\nmission he had the amplest particulars long before the representative of\r\n_The Tocsin_ had passed his threshold. He knew when he was coming, why\r\nhe was coming, and the particular points upon which information was\r\ndesired. He could have disconcerted Hammet beyond measure by placing\r\nbefore him a list of all those persons who had been so delicately\r\nsounded, together with an abstract of the results; and finally, he\r\nreceived as a matter of ordinary routine a copy of the confidential\r\nreport three hours before it reached Mr James Tubes. Armies engaged in\r\nactive warfare have their Intelligence Departments, and the Secret\r\nService of the Unity League was remarkably complete and keen.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Irene Lisle,\" said the next caller, and there being nothing\r\nparticular to say in reply Salt expressed himself by his favourite\r\nmedium--silence; but in such a way that Miss Lisle felt encouraged to\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to you because I am sick of seeing things go on as they\r\nhave been going for years, and no one doing anything. I believe that you\r\n_are_ going to do something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" demanded Salt with quiet interest. It mattered--it might matter a\r\ngreat deal--why this unknown Miss Lisle should have been led to form\r\nthat conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"I have a great many friends--some in London, others all over the\r\ncountry. I have been making enquiries lately, through them and also by\r\nother means. It is generally understood that your membership is about\r\nhalf a million, and you tacitly assent to that.\" She took up a scrap of\r\nwaste paper that lay before her, and writing on it, passed it across the\r\ndesk. \"That, however, is my estimate. If I am right, or anything like\r\nit, you are concealing your strength.\"\r\n\r\nSalt took the paper, glanced at it, smiled and shook his head without\r\ncommitting himself to any expression. But he carefully burned the\r\nfragment with its single row of figures after Miss Lisle had left.\r\n\r\n\"I have attended your meetings,\" continued Miss Lisle composedly, \"for,\r\nof course, I am a member in the ordinary way. I came once as a matter of\r\ncuriosity, or because one's friends were speaking of it, and I came\r\nagain because, even then, I was humbled and dispirited at the shameful\r\npart that our country was being made to play before the world. I caught\r\nsomething, but I did not grasp all--because I am not a man, I suppose. I\r\nsaw meeting after meeting of impassive unemotional, black-coated\r\ngentlemen lifted into the undemonstrative white-heat of purposeful\r\nenthusiasm by the suggestion of that new hope which I failed to\r\nunderstand. At one of the earliest Queen's Hall meetings I particularly\r\nnoticed a young man who sat next to me. He was just an ordinary\r\nkeen-faced, gentlemanly, well-dressed, athletic-looking youth, who might\r\nhave been anything from an upper clerk to a millionaire. He sat through\r\nthe meeting without a word or a sign of applause, but when at the finish\r\ntwenty volunteers were asked for, to give their whole time to serving\r\nthe object of the League, he was the first to reach the platform, with a\r\nhappier look on his face, in the stolid English style, than I should\r\nhave ever expected to see there. It was beyond me. Then among the\r\naudiences one frequently heard remarks such as 'I believe there's\r\nsomething behind it all'; 'I really think Hampden has more than an idea';\r\n'It strikes me that we are going to have something livelier than tea and\r\ntennis,' and suggestions of that kind. Some time ago, after a meeting at\r\nKensington, I was walking home alone when you overtook me. Immediately in\r\nfront were two gentlemen who had evidently been to the meeting also, and\r\nthey were discussing it. At that moment one said emphatically to the\r\nother: 'I don't know what it is, but that it _is_ something I'll\r\nswear; and if it is I'd give them my last penny sooner than have things\r\nas they are.' Sir John Hampden, who was with you, looked at you\r\nenquiringly, and you shook your head and said, 'Not one of our men.'\r\n'Then I believe it's beginning to take already,' he replied.\"\r\n\r\nTwo things occurred to Salt: that Miss Lisle might be a rather sharp\r\nyoung lady, and that he and Hampden had been unusually careless.\r\n\"Anything else?\" was all he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's rather a long wild tale, and it has no particular point,\"\r\nexplained the lady.\r\n\r\n\"If you can spare the time,\" he urged. The long pointless tale might be\r\na pointer to others beside Miss Lisle.\r\n\r\n\"I was cycling a little way out in the country recently,\" narrated Miss\r\nLisle, \"when I found that I required a spanner, or I could not go on. It\r\nwas rather a lonely part for so near London, within ten or twelve miles,\r\nI suppose, and there was not a house to be seen. I wheeled my bicycle\r\nalong and soon came to a narrow side lane. It had a notice 'Private\r\nRoad' up, and I could not see far down it as it wound about very much,\r\nbut it seemed to be well used, so I turned into it hoping to find a\r\nhouse. There was no house, for after a few turns the lane ended\r\nsuddenly. It ended, so to speak, in a pair of large double doors--like\r\nthose of a coach-house--for before me was a stream crossed by an iron\r\nbridge; immediately beyond that a high wall and the doors. But do you\r\ncare for me to go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please,\" said Salt, and paid the narrative the compliment of a\r\nclose and tranquil attention.\r\n\r\n\"It was rather a peculiar place to come on unexpectedly,\" continued Miss\r\nLisle. \"It had originally been a powder works, and the old notices\r\nwarning intruders had been left standing; as a matter of fact a stranger\r\nwould probably still take it to be a powder mill, but one learned\r\nlocally that it was the depot and distributing centre of an artificial\r\nmanure company with a valuable secret process. Which, of course, made it\r\nless interesting than explosives.\"\r\n\r\n\"And less dangerous,\" suggested Salt, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" shot back Miss Lisle with a glance. \"Mark the\r\nprecautions. There was the stream almost enclosing this place--the size,\r\nI suppose, of a considerable farm--and in the powder mill days it had\r\nbeen completely turned into an island by digging a canal or moat at the\r\nnarrowest point of the bend. Immediately on the other side of the water\r\nrose the high brick wall topped with iron spikes. The one bridge was the\r\nonly way across the stream, the one set of double doors, as high as the\r\nwall, the only way through beyond. Inside was thickly wooded. I don't\r\nsuggest wild animals, you know, but savage dogs would not surprise me.\r\n\r\n\"As I stood there, concluding that I should have to turn back, I heard a\r\nheavy motor coming down the lane. It came on very quickly as though the\r\ndriver knew the twisting road perfectly, shot across the bridge, the big\r\ngates fell open apparently of their own accord, and it passed inside. I\r\nhad only time to note that it was a large trade vehicle with a square\r\nvan-like body, before the gates had closed again.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle paused for a moment, but she had by no means reached the end\r\nof her pointless adventure.\r\n\r\n\"I had seen no one but the motor driver, but I was mistaken in thinking\r\nthat there was no one else to see, for as I stood there undecided a\r\nsmall door in the large gate was opened and a man came out. He was\r\nobviously the gate-keeper, and in view of the notices I at once\r\nconcluded that he was coming to warn me off, so I anticipated him by\r\nasking him if he could lend me a spanner. He muttered rather surlily\r\nthat if I waited there he would see, and went back, closing the little\r\ndoor behind him. I thought that I heard the click of a self-acting lock.\r\nPresently he came back just as unamiable as before and insisted on\r\nscrewing up the bolt himself--to get me away the sooner, I suppose. He\r\nabsolutely started when I naturally enough offered him sixpence--I\r\nimagine the poor man doesn't get very good wages--and went quite red as\r\nhe took it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all ended happily?\" remarked Salt tentatively, as though he had\r\nexpected that a possible relevance might have been forthcoming after\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Happily but perplexingly,\" replied Miss Lisle, looking him full in the\r\nface as she unmasked the point of her long pointless story. \"For the\r\nsurly workman who was embarrassed by sixpence was my gentlemanly\r\nneighbour of the Queen's Hall meeting, and I was curious to know how he\r\nshould be serving the object of the League by acting as a gate-keeper to\r\nthe Lacon Equalised Superphosphate Company.\"\r\n\r\nSalt laughed quietly and looked back with unmoved composure. \"No doubt\r\nmany possible explanations will occur to you,\" he said with very\r\nplausible candour. \"The simplest is the true one. Several undertakings\r\neither belong to the League or are closely connected with it, for\r\nincreasing its revenue or for other purposes. The Lacon is one of\r\nthese.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I don't doubt that even the position of doorkeeper is a responsible\r\none, requiring the intelligence of an educated gentleman to fill it,\"\r\nretorted Miss Lisle. \"It must certainly be an exacting one. You know\r\nbetter than I do how many great motor vans pass down that quiet little\r\nlane every hour. They bear the names of different companies, they are\r\ningeniously different in appearance, and they pass through London by\r\nvarious roads and by-roads. But they have one unique resemblance: they\r\nare all driven by mechanics who are astonishingly disconcerted by the\r\noffer of stray sixpences and shillings! It is the same at the little\r\nprivate wharf on the canal a mile away. It was quite a relief to find\r\nthat the bargemen were common human bargees!\"\r\n\r\nSalt still smiled kindly. The slow, silent habit gives the best mask\r\nafter all. \"And why have you come to me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because I _know_ that you are going to do something, and I want to\r\nhelp. I loathe the way things are being done down there.\" The nod meant\r\nthe stately Palace of Westminster, though it happened to be really in\r\nthe direction of Charing Cross, but it was equally appropriate, for the\r\nmonuments of the Government, like those of Wren, lay all around. \"Who\r\ncan go on playing tennis as usual when an ambassador who learned his\r\ndiplomacy in a Slaughter-housemen's Union represents us by acting\r\nalternately as a fool and a cad before an astounded Paris? Or have an\r\ninterest in bridge when the Sultan of Turkey is contemptuously ordering\r\nus to keep our fleet out of sight of Mitylene and we apologise and obey?\r\nI will be content to address envelopes all day long if it will be of any\r\nuse. Surely there are other secret processes down other little lanes? I\r\nwill even be the doorkeeper at another artificial manure works if there\r\nis nothing else!\"\r\n\r\nSalt sat thinking, but from the first he knew that for good or ill some\r\ndegree of their confidence must be extended to a woman. It is the common\r\nexperience of every movement when it swells beyond two members: or\r\nconspiracies would be much more dangerous to their foes.\r\n\r\n\"It may be monotonous, perhaps even purposeless as far as you can see,\"\r\nhe warned. \"I do not know yet, and it will not be for you to say.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle flushed with the pleasurable thrill of blind sacrifice. \"I\r\nwill not question,\" she replied. \"Only if there should be any need you\r\nmight find that an ordinary uninteresting middle-class girl with a\r\nslangy style and a muddy complexion could be as devoted as a Flora\r\nMacdonald or a Charlotte Corday.\"\r\n\r\nSalt made a quiet deprecating gesture. \"A girl with a fearless truthful\r\nface can be capable of any heroism,\" he remarked as he began to write.\r\n\"Especially when she combines exceptional intelligence with exceptional\r\ndiscretion. Only,\" he added as an afterthought, \"it may be uncalled-for,\r\nand might be inconvenient in a law-abiding constitutional age.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite understand that now; the conscientious addressing of circulars\r\nshall bound my horizon. Only, please let me be somewhere in it, when it\r\n_does_ come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Salt,\" drawled an immaculately garbed young man, lounging into\r\nthe room, \"do you happen----\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle, who had been cut off from the door by a screen, rose to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say, I beg your pardon,\" exclaimed the young man. \"They told me\r\nthat you were alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be disengaged in a moment,\" replied Salt formally. \"At ten\r\no'clock to-morrow morning then, Miss Lisle, please.\" She bowed and\r\nwithdrew, the Honourable Freddy Tantroy, who had lingered rather\r\nhelplessly, holding the door as she went out and favouring her with a\r\ncriticising glance.\r\n\r\n\"Always making rotten ass of myself,\" murmured that gentleman\r\nplaintively. \"General Office fault. Engaging lady clerk? Not bad idea,\r\nbut you might have gone in for really superior article while you were\r\nabout it. Cheaper in the end. Oh, I don't know, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lisle came with the best of recommendations,\" said Salt almost\r\ndistantly. One might have judged that he had no desire for Mr Tantroy's\r\nsociety, but that reasons existed why he should not tell him so.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" nodded Freddy sagely; \"they do. Hockey girl, I should\r\nimagine. Face of the pomegranate type, carved by amateur whose hand\r\nslipped when he was doing the mouth. Prefer the pink and pneumatic style\r\nmyself. Matter taste.\"\r\n\r\nSalt made no reply. The only possible reply was the one he denied\r\nhimself. He occupied the time by burning a scrap of paper with a single\r\nrow of figures.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Salt. I was really coming about something, but I've forgotten\r\nwhat,\" announced the honourable youth after a vacuous pause. \"Oh, I\r\nremember. That elusive old cheesecake of a hunk of mine. Do you happen\r\nto know where the volatile Sir John is to be unearthed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine that your uncle is in Paris at this moment,\" replied Salt.\r\n\"He is expected back to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paris!\" exclaimed Freddy with some interest. \"Good luck at the Pink\r\nWindmill, old boy! Anything in the air, Salt? Projected French landing\r\nat Brighton pier next week? Seriously, don't you think League bit of\r\ngilded fizzle? Expected something with coloured lights long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that we have every reason to be satisfied with the progress,\"\r\nreplied Salt. \"The weight of a great organisation must exercise some\r\ninfluence in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" retorted Mr Tantroy with a cunning look. \"That's the other\r\nface of double-headed Johnny they have stuffed in museums. Well, all in\r\ngood time, little Freddy, if you sit quiet.\" He carried out this\r\ncondition literally for a couple of minutes, gazing pensively at a\r\nslender ring he wore. Then: \"I'll tell you what, Salt,\" he continued. \"I\r\nwish you'd use benign influence with Sir John. Tired of apeing the\r\ngolden ass, and I am thinking of settling down. Want an office here and\r\nabsolutely grinding hard work ten to four, and couple of thousand a year\r\nor so until I'm worth more. Fact is, met girl I could absolutely exist\r\nfor ever with in gilded bird-cage. Been Vivarium lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Salt.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, no good trying my rotten powers description. Must go with me\r\nsome night and see. She hangs by her toes to a slack wire eighty-five\r\nfeet above the stage and sings:\r\n\r\n    'Things are strangely upside down, dear boys.\r\n    Nowadays.'\r\n\r\nNo getting away from it, she is positively the most crystallised damson\r\nthat ever stepped out of lace-edged box. No fear monotony in home with\r\ngirl like that. The very thought of it----! Well, come out and have\r\ndrink, Salt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, no,\" replied Salt. \"I've quite got out of the habit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" exclaimed Freddy, aghast. \"You better try some of those\r\nnewspaper things that Johnnies with funny addresses and members of the\r\nGreek Royal Family write up to say have done them no end. I say, Salt, I\r\nsuppose there is spare office in this palatial suite that I could have\r\nif I grappled with the gilded effort?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know that there is.\" He had not the most shadowy faith\r\nin the Honourable Freddy's perseverance, even in intention, for a week.\r\nTo expect any real work from him was out of the question. \"We are rather\r\novercrowded here as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were you, Salt, I should insist upon the old man removing better\r\npremises somewhere. Place seems absolutely congealed with underlings.\r\nJust listen to that in next room: it's like hive of gilded bees. What is\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply routine work going on,\" said Salt half-impatiently. \"Sorry I\r\ncan't spare the time to come out with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right-angled,\" said Freddy, taking the hint and rising.\r\n\"Sorry. Pramp, pramp. You think I shall find Sir John here Friday if I\r\nlook in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here; but desperately busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er, thanks,\" drawled Freddy, with just a suggestion of vice. \"Perhaps\r\nmy uncle will be able to spare me five minutes when he has done with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe drifted languidly through the door and sauntered down the passage. At\r\nthe door of the room where the monotonous voice rose and fell in the\r\nceaseless repetition of short sentences, he paused to light a cigarette.\r\nFor perhaps a full minute he remained quite motionless, the cigarette\r\nbetween his lips, the match pressed ready against the corrugations of\r\nthe jewelled box he held.\r\n\r\n\"Listretton, Fergus, 572 Upper Holloway Road, N.\r\n\r\n\"Listwell-Phelps, J.

The prosaic list of new\r\nmembers dictated to an entering clerk did not interest him. Five names a\r\nminute, three hundred an hour, three thousand a day; an ordinary day,\r\nweeks after any special meeting, and in the flat season of the year. But\r\nit did not interest Mr Tantroy. Immersed in a scheme for taxing baths,\r\nsoda-water syphons, and asparagus beds, and further occupied with the\r\nunexpectedly delicate details of withdrawing from India, it did not\r\ninterest the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was only the ordinary routine work of the Unity League.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\"SCHEDULE B\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day Sir John Hampden returned from Paris. A week later\r\nand he had again left London. At the office of the League it was\r\nimpossible to learn where he had gone; perhaps fishing, it was\r\nsuggested. In any case he was taking a well-earned holiday and did not\r\nwant to be troubled with business, so that nothing was being forwarded.\r\nA little later any one might know for the asking that he was in\r\nBerlin--and returning the next day. There was never any secret made of\r\nSir John's movements if the office knew them, only he occasionally liked\r\nto cut himself completely off from communication in order to ensure a\r\nperfect rest. As soon as the office knew where he was, every one else\r\ncould know too; only it invariably happened that he was on his way back\r\nby that time. The incident was repeated. Callers at Trafalgar Chambers\r\nfound all the heads communicative and very leisured. It came out that\r\nnothing much was being done just then; it was not the time of the year\r\nfor politics. For all the good they were doing three-quarters of the\r\noffices might be closed for the next few months and three-quarters of\r\nthe staff take a holiday. In fact, that was what they were doing to a\r\nlarge extent. It was Mr Salt's turn as soon as Sir John got back.\r\n\r\nThat time it was St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nFor a man who had been a sailor George Salt displayed a curious taste\r\nwhen he came to take his holiday. The sea had no call for him, nor the\r\ncoast-line any charm. The inland resorts, the golf centres, moors,\r\nlakes, mountains and rivers, all were passed by. It was not even to an\r\n\"undiscovered\" village or some secluded country house that he turned his\r\nfootsteps in hope of perfect change. On the contrary, where the\r\nceaseless din of industry made rest impossible; where the puny but\r\nirresistible hands of generations of mankind had scarred the face of\r\nearth like a corroding growth, where the sky was shut out by smoke,\r\nvegetation stifled beneath a cloak of grime, day and night turned into\r\none lurid vulcanian twilight, in which by bands and companies, by trains\r\nand outposts, dwarfish men toiled in the unlovely rhythm of hopeless,\r\nendless labour: the lupus-spots of nature; there Salt spent his holiday.\r\nCoal was the loadstone that drew him on, and in a vast contour his\r\njourney through that month defined the limits of the coal-fields of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent histories of this period no mention of Salt's\r\nsignificant appearance in the provinces finds a place. Yet in presenting\r\na dispassionate review of the succeeding events it is impossible to\r\nignore its influence; although, to adopt a just proportion, it is not\r\nnecessary to deal with it at length. It was not a vital detail of the\r\nscheme on which the League had staked its cause; it was less momentous\r\nthan any of Hampden's three Continental missions; but by disarming\r\nopposition in certain influential quarters when the crisis came, it\r\nremoved a possible cause of dissension from the first. That is its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt was an indication of the extreme care with which the operations had\r\nbeen developed, that even at this point there were still only two men\r\nwho had any real knowledge of what the plan of campaign would be. There\r\nwere those who did not hesitate to declare that a hostile demonstration\r\nwas being arranged by a foreign power with whom Hampden had come to an\r\nunderstanding. At a favourable moment a pretext for a quarrel would be\r\nfound, relations would be broken off immediately, ambassadors recalled,\r\nand within three days England would be threatened with war. If\r\nnecessary, an actual invasion would take place, and in view of the\r\nsweeping reductions in the army and navy no one thought it worth while\r\nto express a doubt that an actual invasion could take place. After\r\narranging for a suitable indemnity the invaders would withdraw, leaving\r\na provisional government in power, with Hampden at its head. This was\r\nthe extremists' view, and the majority, feeling at heart that however\r\nEngland might be internally riven and their liberties assailed, nothing\r\ncould ever justify so unpatriotic a course, held that Hampden was\r\nincapable of the step. Others suggested civil war; passive resistance to\r\nthe payment of rates and taxes on so organised a scale as to embarrass\r\nthe Government for supplies; an alliance, on a basis not readily\r\ndiscernible, with the rank and file of the Socialist party; the secret\r\nimportation of a sufficient number of aliens to turn an election; and a\r\nvariety of other ingenious devices, easy to suggest but difficult to\r\nmaintain. Those who, like Miss Lisle, observed the most, talked the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nAmong the working men of the country--the class that the League had come\r\ninto being to control--it had passed into the category of a second\r\nButtercup League and was ignored. A few, better informed, accepted the\r\nconclusions that Mr Hammet and his associates had arrived at, and\r\nlaughed quietly in their sleeves at the thought of the coming\r\nhumiliation of the confiding members. Last of all there remained a\r\nscattered few here and there, who, through natural suspicion or a\r\nshrewder wisdom than their fellows, had of late begun to detect in the\r\nexistence of the League a real menace to themselves, and to urge the\r\npowers, and Mr Tubes in particular, to counteract its aims. It might\r\nhave been a race, a desperate race, but for one simple thing. Hampden\r\nhad asked for three years in which to complete his plans, and both\r\nfriends and foes, deducing from every experience of the past, ranging\r\nfrom the opening of an exhibition to the closing of a war, had conceded\r\nthat this meant four at least. But Hampden and the man who had been a\r\nsailor had no intention of being embarrassed by a race. Not three years\r\nmeaning four, but three years meaning two, had underlain the boast, and\r\nat the end of two years, although there was still much to be gained by\r\ntime and an unfettered choice of the moment of attack, there was no\r\nprobability of being forestalled on any important point.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position when Salt set out on his provincial holiday.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing to learn; elementary detail of that kind belonged to\r\nanother journey, when, more than two years ago, he had made the\r\nself-same tour. He did not go to offer peace or war; that die had been\r\ncast blindly--who shall say how many years before?--in Northampton boot\r\nfactories, Lancashire mills, Durham coal-pits, in Radical clubs and\r\nLabour cabinets. But in war, and in civil war most of all, every blow\r\naimed at the foe must spend its expiring force upon a friend--and\r\ntherefore Salt went to the coal-fields.\r\n\r\nAt each centre he was met by a high official of the League who had local\r\nknowledge. The man made his report; it concerned a list he brought, a\r\nlist of names. Sometimes it contained only three or four names,\r\nsometimes as many dozens. If to each name there stood the word\r\n\"Content,\" Salt passed on to his next centre. If some were reported to\r\nbe holding out or dissatisfied, Salt remained. When he resumed his\r\nmethodical way the word \"Content\" had been added to every name.\r\n\r\nOnly once did failure threaten to mar his record. A Lancashire colliery\r\nproprietor, a man who had risen from the lowest grade of labour, as men\r\nmore often did in the hard, healthy days of emulous rivalry than in the\r\nlater piping times of union-imposed collective indolence, did not wish\r\nto listen. Positive, narrow, over-bearing, he was permeated with the\r\ndogmatic egotism of his successful life. He had never asked another\r\nman's advice; he had never made a mistake. As hard as the ground out of\r\nwhich he had carved his fortune, he hated and despised his men; they\r\nknew it, and hated and respected him in return. His own brother worked\r\nas a miner in his \"1500 deep\" and received a miner's wage. He hated his\r\nmaster with the rest. Lomas was the \"closest\" employer in the north\r\ncentral coal-field, and the richest. But there were fewer widows and\r\norphans in Halghcroft than in any other pit village of its size, and\r\nLomas spent nothing in insurance. Under his immediate eye cage cables\r\ndid not snap, tram shackles part, nor did unexpected falls of shoring\r\noccur. His men did not smoke at their work, and no mysterious explosion\r\nhad ever engaged the attention of a Board of Trade enquiry.\r\n\r\nSalt found him sitting in his shirt sleeves in a noble room, furnished\r\nin the taste and profusion of a crowded pantechnicon with the most\r\ncostly specimens of seventeen periods of decorative art. He received him\r\nwith his usual manner, and that was the manner of a bellicose curmudgeon\r\ntowards an unwelcome deputation of suppliants. For emphasis, between the\r\nfrank didactic aphorisms which formed his arguments and his rules of\r\nlife, he banged with his fist a _lapis lazuli_ table, and lowered his\r\nvoice in a confidential aside to inform his visitor that three thousand\r\npounds was the figure that the little piece of furniture had cost him,\r\nand that in matters of taste he stuck at nothing--an unnecessary piece\r\nof information after one had cast an astonished glance around that\r\nbizarre room.\r\n\r\nIn Lomas's future there loomed a knighthood--the consummation in his\r\nmind of all earthly ambition and the possible fruit of a lavish charity\r\nof the kind that is scarcely the greatest of the three, and his policy\r\nwas wholly dictated by a fear of endangering his chances. He would have\r\nresented the suggestion, in the face of several munificent donations\r\nthat he had recently made to certain funds, and a gracious\r\nacknowledgment which he had received, that the King was not following\r\nhis career with a personal interest. What, then, was the King's attitude\r\ntowards the Unity League and its plan of campaign? Had Salt anything to\r\nshow? It was useless to protest the inviolability of royal neutrality;\r\nLomas only banged the _lapis lazuli_. That was good enough for\r\noutsiders, he retorted: now, between themselves? The strong man who was\r\nrestrained by diplomatic conventions could make no headway with the\r\nstrong man who was frankly primitive in his selfishness, and Salt\r\nwithdrew, baffled, but unperturbed. But the sequel was that before he\r\nleft his hotel the following day Lomas had waited upon him with full\r\nacquiescence to the terms, and the central coal-field was \"Content.\"\r\n\r\nThe inference might be that at last the intentions of the League must\r\nhave been disclosed. The reality was nothing of the kind. What had been\r\nrevealed to these men, then--the largest employers of labour of any\r\nclass throughout the country--to which they had signified their consent?\r\nit may be asked. And the truth was that nothing had been revealed; that\r\neven the officers of the League who sounded them were in the dark. In\r\nthe past, industrial struggles had always been between capital and\r\nlabour. That vaster encounter, upon which the League was now\r\nconcentrating its energies, was not to be on such clearly defined lines,\r\nand in the strife capital might suffer side by side with labour. Against\r\nthat contingency the coal influence had now been indemnified in the name\r\nof the Unity League and the future Government, and the guarantee had\r\nbeen accepted. It was a far-reaching precaution in the end; it narrowed\r\nthe issue, and it secured more than neutrality in a quarter where open\r\nhostility might have otherwise been proclaimed. It just tended to\r\nrealise that perfection of detail and completeness of preparation that\r\nmark the successful campaign.\r\n\r\nBut if there was nothing more to learn in the sense that the data upon\r\nwhich the League had based its plans had long since been complete, it\r\nwas impossible for a thoughtful observer to pass through the land\r\nwithout learning much. Even two years of increasing privilege had left a\r\ndeeper mark. A lavish policy of \"Bread and Circuses\" was again depleting\r\nthe countryside, choking the towns, and destroying the instinct of\r\ncitizenship, just as it had speeded the decline of another world-power\r\ntwo thousand years before. While wages had remained practically\r\nstationary, the leisure of the working man had been appreciably\r\nincreased, and it was now being discovered that the working man had no\r\nway of passing his leisure except in spending money. Betting and\r\ndrunkenness had increased in direct ratio to the lengthened hours of\r\nenforced idleness, and other disquieting indications of how the time was\r\nbeing spent, were brought home to those who moved among the poor. Where\r\nthe money came from, the books of the great thrift societies at once\r\nrevealed. There was no longer any necessity for the working man to save;\r\nhis wages were guaranteed, his risks of sickness and every other\r\nadversity were insured against, his old age was pensioned, his children\r\nwere, if necessary, State-adopted.\r\n\r\nEven the Trades Unions had abolished their subscriptions and dissipated\r\ntheir reserves. There was no need of thrift now, for the Government was\r\nthe working man's savings bank, and had cut out the debit pages of his\r\npass-book. It was almost the Millennium. The only drawback was that,\r\nwith all this affluence around, the working man found himself very much\r\nin the condition of a financial Ancient Mariner. There was a great deal\r\nof money being spent on him, and for him, and by him, but he never had\r\nany in his pocket. And the working man's wife was even worse off.\r\n\r\nOther classes there were which found themselves in the same position,\r\nbut not by the same process. The rich were taxed up to the eyes, but the\r\nrich had obvious means of retrenchment. But the great mass of the middle\r\nclass had no elastic extravagances upon which they could economise. Even\r\nunder favourable conditions they were for the most part fulfilling\r\nDisraeli's pessimistic dictum: to the generality, manhood had been a\r\nstruggle. It had passed into a failure. It stood face to face with the\r\ncertainty of becoming a disaster. Inevitably there were tragedies.... So\r\nit happened that the one vivid haunting picture that George Salt carried\r\ndown into later years from this period was not a lurid impression of\r\nsome blackened earth-gnarled scene of Dantesque desolation, not even a\r\nmemory of any of the incidents of his own personal triumph, but the\r\nsharp details of an episode that lay quite off the high-road of his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHe was walking along a pretty country lane one evening (for it is a\r\ncharacteristic of many of these unhappy regions that almost to the edge\r\nof man's squalid usurpation Nature spreads her most gracious charms)\r\nwhen a sudden thunderstorm drove him to seek the hospitality of a\r\nlabourer's cottage.\r\n\r\nThe man who opened the door was not a labourer, although he was shabbily\r\ndressed. He looked sombrely at his visitor. \"What is it?\" he asked,\r\nstanding in the doorway with no sign of invitation.\r\n\r\n\"It is raining very heavily,\" replied Salt. \"I should like to shelter,\r\nif you will permit me.\"\r\n\r\nThe man seemed to notice the downpour, which had now become a continuous\r\nstream, for the first time. \"I'm very busy,\" he said churlishly.\r\n\r\n\"If I might stand just inside your doorway?\" suggested Salt.\r\n\r\n\"No, come in,\" said the host with an air of sudden resolution. \"After\r\nall----\" He led the way out of the tiny entrance-hall into a room. Salt\r\ncould not refrain from noticing that although the furniture was meagre,\r\nthe walls were covered with paintings.\r\n\r\n\"I am an artist,\" said the brusque tenant of the cottage, noticing the\r\ninvoluntary glance around. \"Come--in return for shelter you shall tell\r\nme what you think of these things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a critic,\" replied Salt, stepping from picture to picture,\r\n\"and it would be presumptuous, therefore, for me to give an opinion on\r\nworks that I do not understand, although I can recognise them as\r\nstriking and unconventional.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" commented the artist. \"And that?\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated a portrait with a nod. It was in an earlier, a smoother,\r\nand less characteristic style. To the man who was no artist it was a\r\nvery beautiful painting of a very beautiful girl.\r\n\r\n\"My dead wife,\" said the artist, as Salt stood in silent admiration. \"I\r\nhave buried her this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who had never known or even seen her felt a stab as he looked up\r\nat the lovely, smiling face.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the painter roughly, \"why don't you say how sorry you are,\r\nor some platitude of that sort?\"\r\n\r\nSalt turned away, to leave the other alone meeting the sweet eyes.\r\n\"Because I cannot say how sorry I am,\" he replied with gentle pity.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my beloved!\" he heard the whisper. \"Not long, not long.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are packing,\" Salt continued a minute later. \"Let me help you--with\r\nsome.\"\r\n\r\nA heap of straw and shavings littered the floor; boxes and cases stood\r\nready at hand.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the man, looking moodily at his preparations. \"I have\r\nchanged my mind. I have to go on a journey to-night, but I shall leave\r\nthis place as it is and secure the doors and windows instead.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought tools, and together they nailed across the cottage windows\r\nthe stout old-fashioned shutters that secured them. Neither spoke much.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the artist, when the melancholy work was complete; \"the\r\nstorm is over. Our roads lie together for a little way.\" He locked the\r\nouter door, and stood lingering reluctantly with his hand upon the key.\r\n\"A moment,\" he said, unlocking the door again, and entering. \"Only a\r\nmoment. Wait for me at the gate.\"\r\n\r\nSalt waited as he was directed beside a dripping linden. The storm had\r\nindeed passed over, but the sky was low and grey. Little rivulets\r\nmeandered in changing currents down the garden path; from beneath the\r\nnarrow lane came the continuous sobbing rush of some unseen swollen\r\nwater-course. The hand of despair lay heavy across the scene; it seemed\r\nas though Nature had wept herself out, but was uncomforted. Salt\r\npictured the lonely man standing before the soulless, smiling creation\r\nof his own hand.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, the lock again creaked mournfully as its rusty bolt was\r\ndriven home, and without a backward glance the artist came slowly down\r\nthe walk, twisting the clumsy key aimlessly upon his finger. He stopped\r\nat a tangled patch where the anemone struggled vainly among the choking\r\nbindweed, and the hyacinths and lupines had been beaten down to earth.\r\n\r\n\"Her garden!\" he said aloud, and a spasm crossed his face. \"But now how\r\novergrown.\" On a thought he dropped the key gently among the luxuriant\r\ngrowth and turned away.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you why my wife died,\" said the artist suddenly, after they\r\nhad passed round a bend of the road that hid the cottage from their\r\nsight. \"It should point a moral, and it will not take long.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may plead a cause,\" replied Salt.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed his companion, looking at him sharply. \"Who are you,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know me, but you may know my business. I am Salt of the\r\nUnity League.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" murmured the other. \"Well, then, Mr Salt, my name is Leslie\r\nGarnet, and, as I have told you, I am an artist. Ten years ago, at the\r\nage of thirty, I came into a small legacy--three hundred pounds a year,\r\nto be precise. Up to that time I had been making a somewhat precarious\r\nliving by illustration; on the strength of my fortune--which, of course,\r\nto a successful man in any walk of life would be the merest pittance--I\r\nrearranged my plans.\r\n\r\n\"Black and white work was drudgery to me, and it would never be anything\r\nelse, because it was not my medium, but it was the only form of\r\npictorial art that earned a livelihood. Pictures had ceased to sell. At\r\nthe same time I had encouragement for thinking that I could do something\r\nworthy of existence in the higher branch of art.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to trouble you with views. I made my choice. I determined\r\nto live frugally on my income, give up hack work, to the incidental\r\nadvantage of some other poor struggler, and devote myself wholly to\r\npictures which might possibly bring me some recognition at the end of a\r\nlifetime--more probably not--but pictures which would certainly never\r\nenrich me. I do not think that the choice was an ignoble one--but, of\r\ncourse, it was purely a personal matter.\r\n\r\n\"It was very soon afterwards that I got married. Had I thought of that\r\nstep earlier I might have acted differently. As it was, Hilda would not\r\nhear of it. There seemed no need; we were very comfortable on our small\r\nincome in a tiny way.\r\n\r\n\"Nine years ago that. You know the course of events. My income was\r\nderived from a prudently invested capital, so disposed as to give the\r\nhighest safe return. Not many years had passed before the Government\r\nthen in power fixed seven per cent. as the highest rate of interest\r\ncompatible with commercial morality, and confiscated all above. My fixed\r\nsystem of living was embarrassed by a deduction of fifty pounds a year.\r\nThe next year an open-minded Chancellor, in need of a few millions to\r\nspend on free amusements for the working class, was converted to the\r\nprinciple that two per cent. of immorality still remained, so five was\r\nmade the maximum, and my small income was thus permanently reduced to\r\ntwo hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\"We received this second blow rather blankly, but Hilda would not hear\r\nof surrender. As a matter of fact, I soon found out that there was\r\npractically no chance of it, and that in throwing up all connections\r\nwhen I did, I had burned my boats. Artists of every kind were turning to\r\nillustration work, but half of the magazines were dead. We gave up the\r\nflat that had been made pretty and home-like with inexpensive taste, and\r\nmoved into three dreary rooms.\r\n\r\n\"You know what the next development would be, perhaps? Yes, the Unearned\r\nIncomes Act. And you will understand how it affected me.\r\n\r\n\"I was assessed in the same class as the Duke of Belgravia and Mr\r\nDives-Keeps, the millionaire, as a gentleman of private income, capable\r\nof earning a living, but electing to live in idleness on invested\r\ncapital not of my own creating. I was married, could not plead\r\n'encumbrances' in any form, well-educated, strong and healthy, and in\r\nthe prime of life. So I came under 'Schedule B,' and must pay a tax of\r\nten shillings and sixpence in the pound. It was nothing that I might\r\nactually work twelve hours every day. Officially I must be living in\r\nvoluptuous idleness, because the work of my hands did not bring me in an\r\nincome bearing any appreciable proportion to my private means. The\r\nGovernment that denounced Riches in every form and had come in on the\r\nmandate of the poor and needy, recognised no other standard of\r\nattainment but Money. Therefore 'Schedule B.'\r\n\r\n\"Of course the effect of that was overwhelming. I could not afford a\r\nstudio, I could not afford a model. I could scarcely afford materials.\r\nMy wife, who had long been delicate, was now really ill, between anxiety\r\nand the unaccustomed daily work to which she bound herself. One of the\r\ncompanies from which I derived a portion of my income failed at this\r\ntime: ruined by foreign competition and home restrictions. In a panic I\r\nendeavoured to get work of any kind. I had not the experience necessary\r\nfor the lowest rungs of commerce; I was unknown in art. Who would employ\r\na broken-down man beginning life at thirty-eight? I was too old.\r\n\r\n\"I was warned that appeal was useless, but I did appeal before the\r\nCommission. It was useless. I learned that mine was a thoroughly bad\r\ncase from every official point of view, with no redeeming feature: that\r\nI was, in fact, a parasite upon the social system; and I narrowly\r\nescaped having the assessment raised.\r\n\r\n\"It was then that we left London and came to this cottage. My wife's\r\nhealth was permanently undermined, and change of air was necessary even\r\nto prolong her life. Her native county was recommended; that is why we\r\nchose this spot. When I reviewed affairs I found that I had a clear\r\nfifty pounds a year. And there, a few miles to the west, where you see\r\nthat tracery of wheels and scaffolding against the sun, and there, a few\r\nmiles to the north, where you see that pall of smoke upon the air, there\r\nlie hundreds and hundreds of cottages where gross luxury is rampant,\r\nwhere beneath one roof family incomes of ten times mine are free from\r\nany tax at all.\r\n\r\n\"That is enough for you to fill in the detail,\" continued Garnet\r\nbitterly, as he revived the memory of the closing scenes. \"Doctors,\r\nthings that had to be bought, bare existence. What remained of the\r\ninvestments sold for what a forced sale would bring--you know what that\r\nmeans to-day. The end you have seen. And there, Mr Salt, is the story to\r\nyour hand. Here is the churchyard.... Killed, to make a Labour holiday!\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the rustic gate of the hillside churchyard and led the way to\r\na newly-turned mound, where the perfume hung stagnantly from the\r\nrain-lashed petals of a great sheaf of Bermuda lilies.\r\n\r\n\"I remain here,\" he said quietly, after a few minutes' silence by the\r\ngrave-side. \"Your road lies straight on, along the field path. You can\r\neven see the smoke of Thornley from here, lying to your right.\"\r\n\r\nSalt did not reply. Looking intently in the opposite direction, he was\r\nlocating with a seaman's eye another cloud of smoke that rose above the\r\ntree-tops in the valley they had left.\r\n\r\n\"Your house!\" he exclaimed, pointing. \"Man!\" he cried suddenly, with a\r\nflash of intuition, \"what are you doing? You fired the straw before we\r\nleft!\"\r\n\r\nA sharp report was the only answer. Salt turned too late to arrest his\r\narm, only in time to catch him as he fell. He lowered him--there was\r\nnothing else to do--lowered him on to the wet sods that flanked the\r\nmound, and knelt by his side so that he might support him somewhat. To\r\none who had been on battle-fields there was no need to wonder what to\r\ndo. It was a matter not of minutes but of seconds. The mute eyes met his\r\ndimly; he heard the single whisper, \"Hilda,\" and then, without a tremor,\r\nGarnet, self-murdered, pressed a little more heavily against his arm and\r\nlay across the yet unfinished grave of his State-murdered wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTANTROY EARNS HIS WAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" observed Salt reflectively, soon after his return, \"that you\r\nhad better take a short holiday now, Miss Lisle.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle looked up from her work--she was not addressing circulars, it\r\nmay be stated--with an expression not quite devoid of suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"I will, if you wish me to do so, sir,\" she replied meekly. \"But,\r\npersonally, I do not require one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been of great use to us while I was away,\" he explained\r\nkindly, but with official precision, \"and now that I am back again you\r\nhave the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle coloured rather rapturously at the formal praise, but the\r\nastute young woman did not allow her exaltation to beguile her senses.\r\n\r\n\"A week's holiday?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I would suggest a fortnight,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"That would be until the end of June?\"\r\n\r\nSalt agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Then nothing is likely to happen before the end of June?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed frankly. There was no trace of the mystery and restraint, of\r\nthe electric tension in the air, that forerun portentous events, as we\r\nare told, to be noticed about the office of the League.\r\n\r\n\"A great deal may happen before that time, but nothing, I think I can\r\nassure you, that comes within your meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any particular place that you would like me to go to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not at all. Forget Trafalgar Chambers and business entirely for the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly Miss Lisle had looked for some hidden meaning behind the simple\r\nsuggestion of a holiday: had anticipated \"another secret process down\r\nanother little lane.\" At any rate, she did not rejoice at the prospect;\r\non the contrary, she declined it.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she replied, \"but unless it is for your convenience, I\r\nshould prefer to go on addressing circulars.\"\r\n\r\nSalt frowned slightly and smiled slightly, and inwardly admitted to\r\nhimself that he had probably expected worse things when he had first\r\naccepted Miss Lisle's services.\r\n\r\n\"I am a very plain, straightforward person in all my dealings,\" he\r\nremarked, \"and you, outside the strict line of work here, have an\r\noblique vein that taxes the imagination. Further, it carries the sting\r\nthat with all you generally arrive at the same conclusion as I do, only\r\na little earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a loathsome, repulsive nature, I know,\" admitted Irene\r\ncheerfully. \"Trivial, ill-mannered, suspicious. I require strict\r\ndiscipline. That is why I am better here.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far I have not been inconvenienced by the two first characteristics.\r\nIt is a mistake, perhaps, to be over-suspicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed the lady with a level glance. \"It only ends in you finding\r\npeople out, when otherwise you might have gone on believing in them to\r\nthe last.\"\r\n\r\nSalt had only known Miss Lisle for a few months, and for a third of the\r\nperiod he had not seen her. But he knew that when she showed a\r\ndisposition to take up his time something more than the amenities of\r\nconversation lay behind her words. He remembered that level glance. It\r\nforeshadowed another \"long pointless tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"For instance?\" he suggested encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"If I left this office locked when I went out to lunch, for instance,\r\nand found it still locked but the papers slightly disarranged on my\r\nreturn,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Anything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very unpleasant to set traps, of course, but if I put a little\r\ndab of typewriter ink on the inner handle of the door when I next went\r\nout, and subsequently found a slight stain of a similar colour on my\r\nwhite glove after shaking hands with some one, the suspicion would be\r\ndeepened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that the matter is of sufficient importance for you to tell me\r\nall you know,\" he said gravely. \"If you hesitate to be definite for fear\r\nof making a mistake, I will take pains to verify your suspicions and I\r\nwill accept all responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I accuse Mr Tantroy of being a paid spy in the service of the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tantroy!\" exclaimed Salt with a momentary feeling of incredulity.\r\n\"Tantroy! It seems impossible, but, after all, it is possible enough.\r\nYou know, of course, that he has a room here now, and might even think\r\nin his inexperience that he was at liberty to come into this office at\r\nany time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not to take impressions of my keys and have duplicates made; nor to\r\ncopy extracts in my absence; nor to open and examine the cipher\r\ntypewriter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has that been left unlocked?\" he demanded sharply.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied. \"You have the only key that I know of. But it _has_\r\nbeen unlocked, and I infer that the code has been copied.\"\r\n\r\nFor quite three minutes there was silence. Salt was thinking, not idly,\r\nbut estimating exactly the effect of what had happened. Miss Lisle was\r\nwaiting, with somewhat rare perception, until he was ready to continue.\r\n\r\n\"Sooner or later something of the sort was bound to come,\" he summed up\r\nquietly, without a trace of discomfiture. \"It is only the personality\r\nthat is surprising. His interests are identical with ours; he has\r\neverything to gain by our success. Why; why on earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I can explain that in three words,\" suggested Miss Lisle.\r\n\"Velma St Saint.\"\r\n\r\nSalt looked enquiringly. He had forgotten the Hon. Freddy's deity for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\"Of the Vivarium,\" added Irene.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the lady who hangs by her toes,\" he remarked with enlightenment.\r\n\r\n\"'The World's Greatest Inverted Cantatrice'!\" quoted Miss Lisle. \"That\r\nis her celebrated 'Upside Down' song that the organ is playing in the\r\nstreet below. A few years ago she got a week's engagement at the Elysium\r\nat a salary of eighty pounds. She calculated from that that she could\r\nafford to spend four thousand a year, and although all theatrical\r\nincomes have steadily declined ever since until she only gets ten pounds\r\na week now, she has never been able to make any difference in her style\r\nof living.... Of course there is a deficit to be made up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just as well. If it had not been Tantroy it would have been some\r\none abler. Now what has he done, what has he learned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Duplicate keys of this door and of my desk have been made. The lock of\r\nthe cipher typewriter case is not of an elaborate pattern, and any one\r\nbringing a quantity of keys of the right size would probably find one to\r\nanswer. I don't think that either your desk or the safe has been opened;\r\ncertainly not since I began to notice. The papers to which he would have\r\naccess are consequently not highly important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Letters?\" suggested Salt. \"For instance, my letters lying here until\r\nyou forwarded them. There is a post in at eight o'clock in the morning;\r\nothers after you have left up to ten at night. There would be every\r\nopportunity for abstracting some, opening them at leisure, and then\r\ndropping them into the letter-box again a little later.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Miss Lisle. \"I took precautions against that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" he demanded, and waited very keenly for her answer.\r\n\r\n\"Simply by arriving here before eight and remaining until ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\" It was all he said, but it did not leave Miss Lisle with\r\nthe empty feeling that virtue had merely been its own reward.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I ought to add that Mr Tantroy tried to get information from\r\nme,\" she remarked distantly. \"He--he came here frequently and wished me\r\nto accept presents; boxes of chocolate at first, I think, and jewellery\r\nafterwards. It was a mistake he made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented Salt thoughtfully, \"I think it was. There is one other\r\nthing, Miss Lisle. You could scarcely know with whom he was negotiating\r\non the other side?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she admitted regretfully; \"I had not sufficient time. That was why\r\nI did not wish to go away just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that you need hesitate to leave it now. I am not taking\r\nit out of your hands, only carrying on another phase that you have made\r\npossible. It will simplify matters if I have the office to myself. Could\r\nyou find an opportunity for telling Tantroy casually that you are taking\r\na fortnight's holiday?\"\r\n\r\nHer answer hung just a moment. Had he known Tantroy better he might have\r\nguessed. \"Yes, certainly,\" she replied hastily, with a little stumble in\r\nher speech.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he guessed. \"No,\" he corrected himself. \"On second thoughts, it\r\ndoes not matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not mind,\" she protested loyally.\r\n\r\n\"If it were necessary I should not hesitate to ask you,\" he replied half\r\nbrusquely. \"It is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I will go to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening, when he was alone. Salt unlocked the typewriter case to\r\nwhich Miss Lisle had alluded, took out the machine, and seating himself\r\nbefore it proceeded to compose a letter upon which he seemed to spend\r\nmuch consideration. As his fingers struck the keys, upon the sheet of\r\npaper in the carrier there appeared the following mystifying\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n    kbeljsl\r\n\r\n    wopmjvsjxkivslilscalkwespljkjscwecsspssp\r\n    fxfejsloxmjcneoeqjdncs----\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, as Miss Lisle had said, a code typewriter. The letters\r\nwhich appeared on the paper did not correspond with the letters on the\r\nkeys. According to the keyboard the writing should have been:\r\n\r\n    mydrstr\r\n\r\n    nwhvsltscmpltrprtbfrmndthrsmstbndbtthtth\r\n    prpslhvfrmltdsfsblndth----\r\n\r\nand signified, to resolve it into its ultimate form:\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR ESTAIR,--I now have Salt's complete report before me,\r\n     and there seems to be no doubt that the proposal I have\r\n     formulated is feasible, and  the----\r\n\r\nWritten without vowels, stops, capitals, or spaces, this gave a very\r\nserviceable cryptograph, but there was an added safeguard. After\r\ncompleting the first line the writer moved a shift-key and brought\r\nanother set of symbols into play--or, rather, the same symbols under a\r\ndifferent arrangement. The process was repeated for the third line, and\r\nthen the fourth line returned to the system of the first. Thus three\r\ncodes were really in operation, and the danger of the key being found by\r\nthe frequent recurrence of certain symbols (the most fruitful cause of\r\ndetection) was almost overcome. Six identical machines were in\r\nexistence. One has been accounted for; Sir John Hampden had another; and\r\na third was in the possession of Robert Estair, the venerable titular\r\nhead of the combined Imperial party. A sociable young publican, who had\r\na very snug house in the neighbourhood of Westminster Abbey, could have\r\nput his hand upon the fourth; the fifth was in the office of a\r\nsuper-phosphate company carrying on an unostentatious business down a\r\nquiet little lane about ten or a dozen miles out of London; and the\r\nsixth had fallen to the lot of a busy journalist, who seemed to have the\r\nhappy knack of getting political articles and paragraphs accepted\r\nwithout demur by all the leading newspapers by the simple expedient of\r\nscribbling \"Urgent\" and some one else's initials across the envelopes he\r\nsent them in. Communications of the highest importance never reached the\r\nstage of ink and paper, but the six machines were in frequent use. In\r\n_bona fide_ communications the customary phraseology with which letters\r\nbegin and end was not used, it is perhaps unnecessary to say. So obvious\r\na clue as the short line \"kbeljsl\" at the head of a letter addressed to\r\nEstair would be as fatal to the secrecy of any code as the cartouched\r\n\"Cleopatra\" and \"Ptolemy\" were to the mystery of Egyptian hieroglyphics.\r\nThat Salt wrote it may be taken as an indication that he had another end\r\nin view; and it is sometimes a mistake to overrate the intelligence of\r\nyour opponents. When the letter was finished he put it away in his\r\npocket-book, arranged the fastenings of both safe and desk so that he\r\ncould tell if they had been disturbed, and then went home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning his preparations advanced another step. He brought with\r\nhim a new letter copying-book, a silver cigarette-case with a plain\r\npolished surface, and a small jar of some oily preparation. With a\r\nlittle of the substance from the jar he smeared the cigarette-case all\r\nover, wiped away the greater part again until nothing but an almost\r\nimperceptible trace remained, and then placed it carefully within his\r\ndesk. The next detail was to write a dozen letters with dates extending\r\nover the last few days. All were short; all were quite unimportant; they\r\nwere chiefly concerned with appointments, references to future League\r\nmeetings, and the like. Some few were written in cipher, but the\r\nmajority were plain reading, and Salt signed them all in Sir John's\r\nname, appending his own initials. To sign the long letter which he had\r\nalready written he cut off from a note in the baronet's own handwriting\r\nthe signature \"John Hampden,\" fastened it lightly at the foot of the\r\ntypewritten sheet, and then proceeded to copy all the letters into the\r\nnew book. The effect was patent: one letter and one alone stood out\r\namong the rest as of pre-eminent importance. The completion was reached\r\nby gumming upon the back of the book a label inscribed \"Hampden.\r\nPrivate,\" treating the leather binding with a coating of the preparation\r\nfrom the jar, and finally substituting it in the safe in place of the\r\ngenuine volume. Then he burned his originals of all the fictitious\r\nletters and turned to other matters.\r\n\r\nIt was not until two days later that Mr Tantroy paid Salt a passing\r\nvisit. He dropped in in a friendly way with the plea that the burden of\r\nhis own society in his own room, where he apparently spent two hours\r\ndaily in thinking deeply, had grown intolerable.\r\n\r\n\"You are always such a jolly busy, energetic chap, Salt, that it quite\r\nbucks me up to watch you,\" he explained.\r\n\r\nSalt, however, was not busy that afternoon. He only excused himself to\r\nring for a note, which was lying before him already addressed, to be\r\ntaken out, and then gave his visitor an undivided attention. He was\r\npositively entertaining over his recent journeyings. Freddy Tantroy had\r\nnever thought that the chap had so much in him before.\r\n\r\n\"Jolly quaint set of beggars you must have had to do with,\" he remarked.\r\n\"Thought that you were having gilded flutter Monte Carlo, or Margate, or\r\nsome of those places where crowds people go.\"\r\n\r\nSalt looked across at him with a smile. \"I think that there was an\r\nimpression of that sort given out,\" he replied. \"But, between ourselves,\r\nit was strictly on a matter of business.\"\r\n\r\n\"We League Johnnies do get most frightfully rushed,\" said Freddy\r\nsympathetically. \"Bring it off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than I had expected. I don't think it will be long before we\r\nbegin to move now. You would be surprised if I could tell you of the\r\nunexpected form it will take.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't see why you shouldn't,\" dropped Tantroy negligently.\r\n\r\nSalt allowed the moment to pass on a note of indecision.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am speaking prematurely,\" he qualified. \"Things are only\r\nevolving at the moment, and I don't suppose that there will be anything\r\nat all doing during the next few weeks. I have even sent Miss Lisle off\r\non a holiday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noticed the fair Irene's empty chair,\" said Freddy. \"For long?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told her to take a fortnight. She can have longer if she wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish Sir John could spare me; but simply won't hear of it. Don't fancy\r\nyou find girl much good, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she is painstaking,\" put in her employer tolerantly.\r\n\r\n\"No initiative,\" declared Tantroy solemnly. \"No idea of rising to the\r\noccasion or of making use of her opportunities.\"\r\n\r\n\"You noticed that?\" To Freddy's imagination it seemed as though Salt was\r\nregarding him with open admiration.\r\n\r\nHe wagged his head judicially. \"I knew you'd like me to keep eye on\r\nthings while you were away,\" he said, \"so I looked in here occasionally\r\nas I passed. Don't believe she had any idea what to do. Invariably found\r\nher sitting here in gilded idleness at every hour of the day. If I were\r\nyou, should sack her while she is away.\"\r\n\r\nSalt thought it as well to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" he remarked, \"I came across what seemed to me a rather\r\ngood thing in cigarettes at Cardiff, and I wanted to ask your opinion\r\nabout them. It's a new leaf--Bolivian with a Virginian blend, not on the\r\nmarket yet. I wish you'd try one now.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing Freddy Tantroy liked better than being asked to give\r\nhis opinion on tobacco from the standpoint of an expert. He took the\r\ncase held out to him, selected a cigarette with grave deliberation, and\r\nleaned back in his chair with a critical air, preparing to deliver\r\njudgment. Salt returned the case to its compartment in the desk.\r\n\r\n\"It has a very distinctive aroma,\" announced Freddy sagely, after he had\r\ndrawn a few whiffs, held the cigarette under his nose, waved it slowly\r\nin the air before him, and resorted to several other devices of\r\nconnoisseurship.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so too,\" agreed Salt. He had bought a suitable packet of some\r\nobscure brand in a side street, as he walked to the office two days\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Cardiff,\" mused Tantroy. \"Variety grotesque holes you seem to have\r\nexplored, Salt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I had to see a lot of men all over the place. I got a few packets\r\nof these from a docker who had them from a South American merchant in a\r\nroundabout way. Smuggled, of course.\" All along, his conversation had\r\ntouched upon labourers, mill-hands, miners, and other sons of toil.\r\nApparently, as Tantroy noted, he had scarcely associated with any other\r\nclass. He was lying deliberately, and in a manner calculated to alienate\r\nthe sympathy of many excellent people; for there is a worthy and not\r\ninconsiderable class with an ineradicable conviction that although in a\r\njust cause the sixth commandment may be suspended, as it were by Act of\r\nParliament, and the killing of your enemy become an active virtue, yet\r\nin no case is it permissible to tell him a falsehood. If it is necessary\r\nto deceive him the end must be gained by leading him to it by inference.\r\nBut Salt belonged to a hard-grained school which believed in doing\r\nthings thoroughly, and when on active service he swept the sophistries\r\naway. He had to mislead a man whose very existence he believed to be\r\nsteeped in treachery and falsehood, and, as the most effectual way, he\r\nlied deliberately to him.\r\n\r\n\"Frantic adventure,\" drawled Tantroy. \"Didn't know League dealt in\r\npeople that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I saw all sorts,\" corrected Salt hastily, as though he\r\nfeared that he had indicated too closely the trend of his business;\r\n\"only it happened that those were the most amusing,\" and to emphasise\r\nthe fact he launched into another anecdote. At an out-of-the-way village\r\nthere was neither hotel nor inn. His business was unfinished, and it was\r\ndesirable that he should stay the night there. At last he heard of a\r\nsmall farm-house where apartments were occasionally let, and, making his\r\nway there, he asked if he could have a room. The woman seemed doubtful.\r\n\"Of course, as I am a stranger, I should wish to pay you in advance,\"\r\nsaid Salt. \"It isn't that, sir,\" replied the hostess, \"but I like to be\r\nsure of making people comfortable.\" \"I don't think that we shall\r\ndisagree about that,\" he urged. \"Perhaps not,\" she admitted, \"but the\r\nlast gentleman was very hard to please. Everything I got him he'd had\r\nbetter somewhere else till he was sick of it. But,\" she added in a burst\r\nof confidence, \"look what a swell _he_ was! I knew that nothing would\r\nsatisfy him when I saw him come in a motor-car puffed out with rheumatic\r\ntyres, and wearing a pair of them _blase_ kid boots.\"\r\n\r\nTantroy contributed an appreciative cackle, and Salt, leaning back in\r\nhis chair, pressed against a pile of books standing on his desk so that\r\nthey fell to the ground with a crash.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had picked them up again a telegram was waiting at his\r\nelbow. He took it, opened it with a word of apology, and with a sharp\r\nexclamation pulled out his watch. Before Tantroy could realise what was\r\nhappening, Salt had caught up his hat and gloves, slammed down his\r\nself-locking desk, and, after a single hasty glance round the room, was\r\nstanding at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, won't you?\" he called back. \"Most important. Can just catch\r\na train. Pull my door to after you, please,\" and the next minute he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Tantroy's first action was not an unnatural one in the\r\ncircumstance. He picked up the telegram which Salt had left in his wild\r\nhurry and read it. \"_Come at once, if you wish to see Vernon alive_,\"\r\nwas the imperative message, and it appeared to have been handed in at\r\nCroydon half an hour before. He stepped to the window, and from behind\r\nthe curtains he saw Salt run down the steps into the road, call a hansom\r\nfrom the rank near at hand, and disappear in the direction of Victoria\r\nat a gallop.\r\n\r\nMr Tantroy sat down again, and his eyes ran over the various objects in\r\nthe room in quick succession. The code typewriter. He had all he wanted\r\nfrom that. Salt's desk. Locked, of course. The girl's desk. Locked, and,\r\nas he knew, not worth the trouble of unlocking with his duplicate key.\r\nThe safe----His heart gave a bound, his eyes stood wide in incredulous\r\nsurprise, and he sprang to his feet and stealthily crossed the room to\r\nmake sure of his astounding luck. The safe was unlocked! The door stood\r\njust an inch or so ajar, and Salt, having failed to notice it in his\r\nhurried glance, was on his way to Croydon!\r\n\r\nLiving in a pretentious, breathless age, drawn into a social circle\r\nbeside whose feverish artificiality the _natural_ artificiality\r\ninseparable from any phase of civilisation stood comparable to a sturdy,\r\nhealthy tree, badly brought up, neglected, petted, the Honourable\r\nFrederick Tantroy had grown to the form of the vacuous pose which he had\r\nadopted. Beneath it lay his real character. A moderately honest man\r\nwould not have played his part, but an utterly weak one could not have\r\nplayed it. It demanded certain qualities not contemptible. There were\r\nrisks to be taken, and he was prepared to take them, and in their\r\npresence his face took on a stronger, even better, look. He bolted the\r\ndoor on the inside, picked up a few sheets of paper from the desk-top,\r\nand without any sign of nervousness or haste began to do his work.\r\n\r\nIt was fully three hours later when Salt returned; for with that extreme\r\npassion for covering every possible contingency that marked his career,\r\nhe had been to Croydon. Many a better scheme has failed through the\r\nneglect of a smaller detail. The room, when he entered it and secured\r\nthe door, looked exactly as when he left, three hours before. For all\r\nthe disarrangement he had caused, Tantroy might have melted out of it.\r\n\r\nOn the top of his desk, at the side nearest to the safe, lay a packet of\r\noctavo scribbling paper. He took out the sheets and twice counted them.\r\nThirty-one, and he had left thirty-four. His face betrayed no emotion.\r\nSatisfaction at having outwitted a spy was merged in regret that there\r\nmust need be one, and pain on Hampden's account that his nephew should\r\nbe the traitor. He unlocked his desk and carefully lifted out the\r\ncigarette-case, pulled open the safe door, and took up the fictitious\r\nletter-book. To the naked eye the finger-prints on each were scarcely\r\ndiscernible, but under the magnifying lenses of the superimposing glass\r\nall doubt was finally dispelled. They were there, they corresponded,\r\nthey were identical. Thumb to thumb, finger to finger, and line to line\r\nthey fitted over one another without a blur or fault. It was, as it\r\noften proved to be in those days, hanging evidence.\r\n\r\nSalt relocked the safe, tore out the used pages of the letter-book, and\r\nreduced them to ashes on the spot. The less important remains of the\r\nbook he took with him to his chambers, and there burned them from cover\r\nto cover before he went to bed.\r\n\r\nIt had served its purpose, and not a legitimate trace remained. Around\r\nthe stolen copy the policy of the coming strife might crystallise, and\r\ntowards any issue it might raise Salt could look with confidence.\r\nFinally, if the unforeseen arose, the way was clear for Sir John to\r\ndenounce a shameless forgery, and who could contradict his indignant\r\nword?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSECRET HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder succeeding administrations, each pledged to a larger policy to\r\nthemselves and a smaller one towards every one else, most of the\r\ntraditional outward forms of government had continued to be observed.\r\nThus there was a Minister for the Colonies, though the Colonies\r\nthemselves had shamefacedly one by one dropped off into the troubled\r\nwaters of weak independence, or else clung on with pathetic loyalty in\r\nspite of rebuff after rebuff, and the disintegration of all mutual\r\ninterests, until nothing but the most shadowy bond remained. There was a\r\nSecretary of State for War in spite of the fact that the flag which the\r\nGovernment nailed to the mast when it entered into negotiations with an\r\naggrieved and aggressive Power, bore the legend, \"Peace at any Price.\r\nNone but a Coward Strikes the Weak.\" There had been more than one First\r\nLord of the Admiralty whose maritime experience had begun and ended on\r\nthe familiar deck of the _Koh-I-Noor_. There were practically all the\r\nusual officers of ministerial rank--and the recipients of ministerial\r\nsalaries.\r\n\r\nApart from the enjoyment of the title and the salary, however, there\r\nwere a few members of the Cabinet who exercised no real authority. Lord\r\nHenry Stokes had been the last of upper class politicians of standing to\r\naccept office under the new _regime_. Largely in sympathy with the\r\ndemocratic tendency of the age, optimistic as to the growth of\r\nmoderation and restraint in the ranks of the mushroom party, and\r\nactuated by the most sterling patriotism, Lord Henry had essayed the\r\nsuperhuman task of premiership. Superhuman it was, because no mortal\r\ncould have combined the qualities necessary for success in the face of\r\nthe fierce distrust and jealousy which his rank and social position\r\nexcited in the minds of the rawer recruits of his own party; superhuman,\r\nbecause no man possessing his convictions could have long reconciled\r\nwith them the growing and not diminishing illiberality of those whom he\r\nwas to lead. There were dissensions, suspicions, and recriminations from\r\nthe first. The end came in a tragic scene, unparalleled among the many\r\nhistoric spectacles which the House has witnessed. A trivial point in\r\nthe naval estimates was under discussion, and Lord Henry, totally out of\r\nsympathy with the bulk of his nominal following, had risen to patch up\r\nthe situation on the best terms he could. At the end of a studiously\r\nmoderate speech, which had provoked cheers from the opposition and\r\nmurmurs of dissent from his own party throughout, he had wound up his\r\nplea for unity, toleration, and patriotism, with the following words:\r\n\"It is true that here no Government measure is at stake, no crisis is\r\ninvolved, and honourable members on this side of the House are free of\r\nparty trammels and at liberty to vote as seems best to each. But if the\r\nmotion should be persisted in, an inevitable conclusion must be faced,\r\nan irretrievable step will have been taken, and of the moral outcome of\r\nthat act who dare trace the end?\"\r\n\r\nThere was just a perceptible pause of sullen silence, then from among\r\nthe compact mass that sat behind their leader rose a coarse voice,\r\ncharged with a squiggling laugh.\r\n\r\n\"We give it up, 'Enry. If it's a riddle about morals, suppose you ask\r\nlittle Flo?\"\r\n\r\nIt was an aside--it was afterwards claimed that it was a drunken\r\nwhisper--but it was heard, as it was meant to be heard, throughout the\r\ncrowded Chamber. From the opposition ranks there was torn a cry, almost\r\nof horror, at the enormity of the insult, at the direful profanation of\r\nthe House. Responsible members of the Government turned angrily,\r\nimploringly, frantically upon their followers. At least half of these,\r\nsitting pained and scandalised, needed no restraint, but from the\r\nmalcontents and extreme wings came shriek upon shriek of boisterous\r\nmirth, as they rocked with laughter about their seats. As for Lord\r\nHenry, sitting immobile as he scanned a paper in his hand, he did not\r\nappear to have heard at first, nor even to have noticed that anything\r\nunusual was taking place. But the next minute he turned deadly pale,\r\nbegan to tremble violently, and with a low and hurried, \"Your help,\r\nMeadowsweet!\" he stumbled from the Hall.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years he had been a member of the House, years of\r\nfull-blooded politics when party strife ran strong, but never before had\r\nthe vaguest innuendo from that deep-seared, unforgotten past dropped\r\nfrom an opponent's lips. It had been reserved for his own party to\r\nachieve that distinction and to exact the crowning phase of penance in\r\nnature's inexorable cycle.\r\n\r\nApologists afterwards claimed that too much had been made of the\r\nincident--that much worse things were often said, and passed, at the\r\nmeetings of Boards of Guardians and Borough Councils. It was as true as\r\nit was biting: worse things were said at Borough Councils, and the\r\nMother of Parliaments had sunk to the rhetorical level of a Borough\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nStokes never took his seat again, and with him there passed out of that\r\narena the last of a hopeful patriotic group, whose only failure was that\r\nthey tried to reconcile two irreconcilable forces of their times.\r\n\r\nIt did not result, however, that no men of social position were to be\r\nfound among the Labour benches. There was a demand, and there followed\r\nthe supply. Rank, mediocrity, and moral obsequiousness were the\r\nessentials for their posts. There were no more Stokeses to be had, so\r\nobliging creatures were obtained who were willing for a consideration to\r\nbe paraded as the successors to his patriotic mantle. They were plainly\r\nmade to understand their position, and if they ventured to show\r\nindividuality they soon resigned. Nominally occupying high offices, they\r\nhad neither influence, power, nor respect; like Marlborough in\r\ncompliance they had \"to do it for their bread.\" They were ruled by their\r\njunior lords, assistants, and underlings in various degrees. Many of\r\nthese men, too strong to be ignored, were frankly recognised to be\r\nimpossible in the chief offices of State. As a consequence the Cabinet\r\nsoon became an empty form. Its councils were still held, but the\r\nproceedings were cut and dried in advance. The real assembly that\r\ndictated the policy of the Government was the Expediency Council, held\r\ninformally as the necessity arose.\r\n\r\nThe gathering which was taking place at the Premier's house on this\r\noccasion had been convened for the purpose of clearing the air with\r\nregard to the policy to be pursued at home. The Government had come into\r\npower with very liberal ideas on the question of what ought to be done\r\nfor the working classes. They had made good their promises, and still\r\nthat free and enlightened body, having found by experience that they\r\nonly had to ask often enough and loudly enough to be met in their\r\ndemands, were already clamouring for more. The most moderate section of\r\nthe Government was of opinion that the limit had been reached; others\r\nthought that the limit lay yet a little further on; the irresponsibles\r\ndenied that any limit could be fixed at all. That had been the\r\nexperience of every administration for a long time past, and each one in\r\nturn had been succeeded by its malcontents.\r\n\r\nMr Strummery, the Premier, did not occupy the official residence\r\nprovided for him. Mrs Strummery, an excellent lady who had once been\r\nheard to remark that she could never understand why her husband was\r\ncalled _Prime Minister_ when he was not a _minister_ at all, flatly\r\ndeclared that the work of cleaning the windows alone of the house in\r\nDowning Street put it out of the question. Even Mr Strummery, who, among\r\nhis political associates, was reported to have rather exalted ideas of\r\nthe dignity of his position, came to the conclusion, after fully\r\nconsidering the residence from every standpoint, that he might not feel\r\nreally at home there. It was therefore let, furnished, to an American\r\nlady who engineered wealthy _debutantes_ from her native land into \"the\r\nbest\" English society, and the Strummerys found more congenial\r\nsurroundings in Brandenburg Place. There, within a convenient distance\r\nof the Hampstead Road and other choice shopping centres, Mrs Strummery,\r\nlike the wife of another eminent statesman whose statue stood almost\r\nwithin sight of her bedroom windows, was able to indulge in her amiable\r\nfoible for cheap marketing. And if the two ladies had this in common,\r\nthe points of resemblance between their respective lords (the moral side\r\nexcluded) might be multiplied many-fold, for no phrase put into Mr\r\nStrummery's mouth could epigrammatise his point of view more concisely\r\nthan Fox's inopportune toast, \"Our Sovereign: the People.\" History's\r\ndispassionate comment was that the sentiment which lost the abler man\r\nhis Privy Councillorship in his day, gained for the other a Premiership\r\na century later.\r\n\r\n\"One thing that gets me is why no one ever seems to take any notice of\r\nus when we have a Council on,\" remarked the President of the Board of\r\nEducation with an involuntary plaint in his voice. He was standing on\r\nthe balcony outside the large front room on Mr Strummery's first\r\nfloor--a room which boasted the noble proportions of a _salon_, and\r\npossibly served as one in Georgian days. Certainly Brandenburg Place did\r\nnot present a spectacle of fluttering animation at the prospect of\r\nseeing the great ones of the land assembling within its bounds. At one\r\nend of the thoroughfare a milkman was going from area to area with a\r\nprolonged melancholy cry more suggestive of Stoke Poges churchyard than\r\nof any other spot on earth; at the opposite end a grocer's errand boy,\r\nwith basket resourcefully inverted upon his head, had sunk down by the\r\nrailings to sip the nectar from a few more pages of \"Iroquois Ike's Last\r\nHope; or, The Phantom Cow-Puncher's Bride.\" Midway between the two a\r\ncat, in the act of crossing the road, had stopped to twitch a forepaw\r\nwith that air of imperturbable deliberateness in its movements that no\r\nother created thing can ever succeed in attaining. In a house opposite\r\nsome one was rattling off the exhilarating strains of \"Humming Ephraim,\"\r\nbut even when a hansom cab and two four-wheelers drove up in quick\r\nsuccession to the Premier's door, no one betrayed curiosity to the\r\nextent of looking out of the window. The Minister of Education noted\r\nthese things as he stood on the balcony, and possibly he felt another\r\nphase of the gratitude of men that often left Mr Wordsworth mourning. \"I\r\ncan remember the time when crowds used to wait hours in the rain along\r\nDowning Street--our people, too--to catch a sight of Estair or\r\nNettlebury. I won't exactly say that it annoys me, because I've seen too\r\nmuch of the hollowness of things for that, but it certainly is rummy why\r\nit should be so.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very good thing, too,\" commented the Premier briskly from the room.\r\n\"I don't know that we could have a greater compliment. The people know\r\nthat we are plain, straightforward men like themselves, and they know\r\nthat we are doing our work without having to come and see us at it. They\r\ndon't regard us almost as little deities--interesting to see, but quite\r\ndifferent and above themselves. That's why.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one in the room said \"Hear! Hear!\" as though that exactly defined\r\nhis own sentiments; and every one in the room looked rather sad, as\r\nthough at the back of their collective minds there lurked a doubt\r\nwhether it might not be more pleasant to be regarded almost as little\r\ndeities.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't go as far back as Estair and Nettlebury,\" put in Vossit of\r\nthe Treasury. \"See how they fairly 'um round Hampden whenever he's\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not us,\" interposed another man emphatically. \"Let them go on their own\r\nmessin' way; it'll do us no harm. You never saw a working man at any of\r\ntheir high and mighty meetings.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse, for they didn't want them. But there ought to have\r\nbeen working men there, from the very first meeting until now.\" The\r\nspeaker was one of the most recent additions to the potent circle of the\r\nBrandenburg Place councils, and the freedom of criticism which he\r\nallowed himself had already been the subject of pained comment on the\r\npart of a section of his seniors.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" suggested some one, with politely-pointed meaning, \"I don't know\r\nwhat's to prevent one individual from attending a meeting if he so\r\nwants. He'd probably find one going on somewhere at this minute if he\r\nlooked round hard. Doesn't seem to me that any one's holding him back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, now,\" reproved Mr Guppling, the Postmaster-General, \"let the man\r\nspeak if he has anything on his mind. Come now, comrade, what do you\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I mean,\" replied the comrade, at which there was a\r\ngeneral shout of laughter. \"I don't know what I mean,\" he continued,\r\nhaving secured general attention by this simple device of oratory,\r\n\"because I am told in those Government quarters where I ought to be able\r\nto find information, that no information has been collected, no\r\nsystematic enquiries made, nothing is known, in fact. Therefore, I do\r\nnot know what I mean because I do not know--none of us know--what the\r\nUnity League means. But I know this: that a hostile organisation of over\r\na million and a half strong----\"\r\n\r\nDissent came forcibly from every quarter of the room. \"Not half!\" was\r\nthe milder form it took.\r\n\r\n\"----of over a million and a half strong,\" continued the speaker\r\ngrimly--\"perhaps more, in fact, than all our Trades Unions put\r\ntogether--with an income very little less than what all the Trades\r\nUnions put together used to have, and funds in hand probably more, is a\r\nliving menace in our midst, and ought to have been closely watched.\"\r\n\r\n\"It keeps 'em quiet,\" urged the Foreign Under-Secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Too quiet. I don't like my enemy to be quiet. I prefer him to be\r\ntalking large and telling us exactly what he's going to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're going to chuck us out, Tirrel; that's what they're going to\r\ndo,\" said a sarcastic comrade playfully. \"So was the Buttercup League,\r\nso was the Liberal-Conservative alliance. Lo, history repeats itself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a long line of strong men fallen in the past--premiers, popes,\r\nkings, generals, ambassadors,\" replied Tirrel. \"They all took it for\r\ngranted that when they had got their positions they could keep them\r\nwithout troubling about their enemies any more. That's generally the\r\nrepeating point in history.\"\r\n\r\nMr Strummery felt that the instances were perhaps getting too near home.\r\n\"Come, come, chaps, and Comrade Tirrel in particular,\" he said mildly,\r\n\"don't imagine that nothing is being done in the proper quarter because\r\nyou mayn't hear much talk about it. Our Executives work and don't talk.\r\nI think that you may trust our good comrade Tubes to keep an eye on the\r\nUnity League.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish he'd keep an eye on the clock,\" murmured a captious member. \"Not\r\nonce,\" he added conclusively, \"but three times out of four.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a vigorous knock at the front door, and the hurried footsteps\r\nof some one ascending the stairs with the consciousness that he was\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n\"Talk of Tubes and you'll have a puncture,\" confided a comrade of\r\nhumorous bent to his neighbour, and on the words the Home Secretary,\r\ncertainly with very little breath left in him, entered the room and made\r\nhis apologies.\r\n\r\nThe special business for which the Council had been called together was\r\nto consider a series of reports from the constituencies, and to decide\r\nhow to be influenced by their tenor. The Government had no desire to\r\nwait for a general election in order to find out the views of the\r\nelectors of the country; given a close summary of those sentiments, it\r\nmight be possible to fall in with their wishes, and thereby to be spared\r\nthe anxiety of an election until their septennial existence had run its\r\ncourse; or, if forced by the action of their own malcontents to take\r\nthat unwelcome step, at least to cut the ground from beneath their\r\nopponents' feet in advance.\r\n\r\nIf there was not complete unanimity among those present, there was no\r\ndistinct line of variance. Men of the extremest views had naturally not\r\nbeen included, and although the prevailing opinion was that the\r\nconditions of labour had been put upon a fair and equitable basis during\r\ntheir tenure of office--or as far in that direction as it was possible\r\nto go without utterly stampeding capitalists and ratepayers from the\r\ncountry--there were many who were prepared to go yet a little further if\r\nit seemed desirable.\r\n\r\nJudging from the summarised reports, it did seem desirable. From the\r\nmills of Lancashire and Yorkshire, the coal-pits of the north and west,\r\nthe iron fields of the Midlands, the quarries of Derbyshire, the boot\r\nfactories of Northampton and the lace factories of Nottingham, from\r\nevery swarming port around the coast, and from that vast cosmopolitan\r\nclearing house, the Capital itself, came the same tale. The people did\r\nnot find themselves so well off as they wished to be; they were, in\r\nfact, rather poorer than before. There was nothing local about it. The\r\nThurso flag-stone hewer shared the symptoms with his Celtic brother,\r\ndigging out tin and copper from beneath the Atlantic waters beyond\r\nPendeen; the Pembroke dock-hand and the Ipswich mechanic were in just\r\nthe same position. When industries collapsed, as industries had an\r\nunhappy character for doing about the period, no one had any reserves.\r\nIt was possible to live by provision of the Government, but the working\r\nman had been educated up to requiring a great deal more than bare\r\nliving. When wages went down in spite of all artificial inflation, or\r\nshort time was declared, a great many working-class houses, financed\r\nfrom week to week but up to the hilt in debt, went down too. The\r\nagricultural labourer was the least disturbed; he had had the least done\r\nfor him, and he had never known a \"boom.\" The paradox remained that with\r\nmore money the majority of the poor were poorer than before, and they\r\nwere worse than poor, for they were dissatisfied. The remedy, of course,\r\nwas for some one to give them still more money, not for them to spend\r\nless. The shortest way to that remedy, as they had been well taught by\r\ntheir agitators in the past, was to clamour for the Government to do\r\nsomething else for them, and therefore they were clamouring now.\r\n\r\n\"That is the position,\" announced Mr Tubes, when he had finished reading\r\nthe general summary. \"The question it raises may not be exactly urgent,\r\nbut it is at least pressing. On the one hand, there is the undoubted\r\nfeeling of grievance existing among a large proportion of electors--our\r\nown people. On the other hand, there is the serious question of national\r\nfinances not to be overlooked. As the matter is one that must ultimately\r\nconcern me more closely than anybody else, I will reserve my own opinion\r\nto the last.\"\r\n\r\nThe view taken by those present has already been indicated. Their\r\nplatform was that of Moderate Socialism; they wished it always to be\r\nunderstood that they were practical. They had the interest of their\r\nfellow working men (certainly of no other class of the community) at\r\nheart, but as Practical Socialists they had a suspicion (taking the\r\ncondition of the Exchequer into consideration) that for the moment they\r\nhad reached the limit of Practical Socialism. There was an undoubted\r\ndilemma. If a mistake of policy on their part let in the impractical\r\nSocialists, the result would be disastrous. Most of them regarded the\r\ndanger as infinitesimal; like every other political party during the\r\nlast two centuries, they felt that they could rely on the \"sound\r\ncommon-sense of the community.\" Still, admitting a possibility, even if\r\nit was microscopic, might it not be more--say practically socialistic\r\n(the word \"patriotic\" had long been expunged from their vocabulary) in\r\nthe end to make some slight concessions? If there existed a more\r\nmaterial inducement it was not referred to, and any ingenuous comrade,\r\nusing as an argument in favour of compliance a homely proverb anent the\r\ninadvisability of quarrelling with one's bread and butter, would have\r\nbeen promptly discouraged. Yet, although the actors themselves in this\r\ngreat morality play apparently overlooked the consideration, it is\r\nimpossible for the spectator to ignore the fact. Some few members of the\r\nCabinet might have provided for a rainy day, but even to many of\r\nofficial class, and practically to all of the rank and file, a reversal\r\nat the polls must mean that they would have to give up a variety of\r\nhighly-esteemed privileges and return to private life in less\r\ninteresting capacities, some in very humble ones indeed.\r\n\r\nIt ended, as it was bound to end, in compromise. They would not play\r\ninto the hands of the extreme party and ignore the voice of the\r\nconstituencies; they would not be false to their convictions and be\r\ndictated to by the electors. They would decline to bring in the\r\nsuggested Minimum Wage Bill, and they would not impose the Personal\r\nProperty Tax. They would meet matters by extending the National\r\nObligations Act, and save money on the Estimates. They would be sound,\r\nif commonplace.\r\n\r\nThe formal proceedings having been concluded, it was open for any one to\r\nintroduce any subject he pleased in terms of censure, enquiry or\r\ndiscussion. Comrade Tirrel was on his feet at once, and returned to the\r\nsubject that lay heavy on his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Is the Home Secretary in possession of any confidential information\r\nregarding the Unity League?\" he demanded; \"and can he assure us, in view\r\nof the admittedly hostile object of the organisation, that adequate\r\nmeans are being taken to neutralise any possible lines of action it may\r\nadopt?\"\r\n\r\n\"The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative,\"\r\nreplied Mr Tubes in his best parliamentary manner. \"As regards the\r\nsecond part, I may state that after considering the reports we have\r\nreceived it is not anticipated that the League offers any serious menace\r\nto the Government. Should the necessity arise, the Council may rely upon\r\nthe Home Office taking the requisite precautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The answer is satisfactory as far as it goes. Being in possession of\r\nspecial information, will the Home Secretary go a step further and allay\r\nthe anxiety that certainly exists in some quarters, by indicating the\r\nreal intentions and proposed _modus operandi_ of the League?\"\r\n\r\nMr Tubes conferred for a moment with his chief. \"I may say that on broad\r\nlines the League has no definite plan for the future, and its\r\nintentions, as represented by the policy of its heads, will simply be to\r\ngo on existing so long as the deluded followers will continue their\r\nsubscriptions. I may point out that the League has now been in existence\r\nfor two years, and during that time it has done nothing at all to\r\njustify its founders' expectations; it has not embarrassed us at any\r\npoint nor turned a single by-election. For two years we heard\r\npractically nothing of it, and there has been no fresh development to\r\njustify the present uneasiness which it seems to be causing in the minds\r\nof a few nervous comrades. Its membership is admittedly imposing, but\r\nthe bare fact that a million and a half of people are foolish\r\nenough----\"\r\n\r\nThere was a significant exchange of astonished glances among the\r\noccupants of Mr Strummery's council chamber. Murmurs grew, and Mr\r\nGuppling voiced the general feeling by calling the Home Secretary's\r\nattention to the figures he had mentioned \"doubtless inadvertently.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" admitted Mr Tubes carelessly, \"that is our latest estimate. From\r\nrecent information we have reason to think that the previous figure we\r\nadopted was too low--or the League may have received large additions\r\nlately through some accidental cause. We are now probably erring as\r\nwidely on the other side, but it is the safe side, and I therefore\r\nretain that figure.\"\r\n\r\nMr Tirrel had not yet finished, but he was listened to with respectful\r\nattention now.\r\n\r\n\"Is the Home Secretary in a position to tell us who this man Salt is?\"\r\nwas his next enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary looked frankly puzzled. \"Who _is_ Salt?\" he replied,\r\ninnocently enough.\r\n\r\n\"That is the essential point of my enquiry,\" replied the comrade.\r\n\"Salt,\" he continued, his voice stilling the laughter it had raised, \"is\r\nthe Man behind the Unity League. You think it is Hampden, but I tell you\r\nthat you are mistaken. Hampden is undoubtedly a dangerous power; the\r\nclasses will follow him blindly, and he is no mere figure-head, but it\r\nwas Salt who stirred Hampden from his apathy, and it is Salt who pulls\r\nthe wires.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Salt?\" demanded the Premier, as Mr Tubes offered no comment.\r\n\r\nTirrel shook his head. \"I know no more than I have stated,\" he replied;\r\n\"but his secret influence must be tremendous, and all doubt as to the\r\nidentity of the man and his past record should be set at rest.\"\r\n\r\nMr Tubes looked up from the papers he had before him with a gleam of\r\nsubdued anger in his eye. \"I think that our cock-sure kumred has geete\r\nhowd of another mare's neest,\" he remarked, relapsing unconsciously into\r\nhis native dialect as he frequently did when stirred. \"I remember\r\nhearin' o' this Saut in one o' th' reports, and here it is. So far from\r\nbeing a principal, he occupies a very different position--that of\r\nHampden's private secretary, which would explain how he might have to\r\ncome into contact with a great many people without having any real\r\ninfluence hissel. He is described in my confidential report as a simple,\r\nunsuspicious man, who might be safely made use of, and, in fact, most of\r\nmy information is derived from that source.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp, smothered exclamation from one or two men, and then a\r\nsudden stillness fell upon the room. Mr Tubes was among the last to\r\nrealise the trend of his admission.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to understand that the greater part--perhaps the whole--of the\r\ninformation upon which the Home Office has been relying, and of the\r\nassurances of inaction which have lulled our suspicions to rest, have\r\nbeen blindly accepted from this man Salt, the head and fount of the\r\nLeague itself?\" demanded Tirrel with ominous precision. \"If that\r\nindicates the methods of the Department, I think that this Council will\r\nshare my view when I suggest that the terms 'simple' and 'unsuspicious'\r\nhave been inaccurately allotted--to Salt.\"\r\n\r\nMr Tubes made no reply. Lying at the bottom of the man's nature\r\nsmouldered a volcanic passion that he watched as though it were a\r\nsleeping beast. Twice in his public career it had escaped him, and each\r\ntime the result had been a sharp reverse to his ambitions.\r\nRepression--firm, instant, and unconditional--was the only safeguard, so\r\nthat now recognising the danger-signal in his breast, he sat without a\r\nword in spite of the Premier's anxious looks, in spite of the concern of\r\nthose about him.\r\n\r\n\"I will not press for a verbal reply,\" continued Tirrel after a telling\r\npause; \"the inference of silence makes that superfluous. But I will ask\r\nwhether the Home Secretary is aware that Salt has been quietly engaged\r\nin canvassing the provinces for a month, and whether he has any\r\ninformation about his object and results. Yes,\" he continued vehemently,\r\nturning to those immediately about him, \"for a month past this simple,\r\nunsuspecting individual from whom we derive our confidential information\r\nhas been passing quietly and unmarked from town to town; and if you were\r\nto hang a map of England on the wall before me, I would undertake to\r\ntrace his route across the land by the points of most marked discontent\r\nin the report to which we have just listened.\"\r\n\r\nA knock at the locked door of the room saved the Home Secretary for the\r\nmoment from the necessity of replying. It was an unusual incident, and\r\nwhen the nearest man went and asked what was wanted, some one was\r\nunderstood to reply that a stranger, who refused to give his name,\r\nwished to see Mr Tubes. Perhaps Mr Tubes personally might have welcomed\r\na respite, but the master of the house anticipated him.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him, whoever he may be, that Mr Tubes cannot be disturbed just\r\nnow,\" he declared.\r\n\r\n\"He says it's important, very important,\" urged the voice, with a\r\nsuggestion of largess received and more to come, in its eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Then let him write it down or wait,\" said Mr Strummery decisively, and\r\nthe matter was supposed to have ended.\r\n\r\nThe momentary interruption had broken the tension and perhaps saved\r\nTubes from a passionate outburst. He rose to make a reply without any\r\nsign of anger or any fear that he would not be able to smooth away the\r\nawkward impression.\r\n\r\n\"As far as canvassing in the provinces is concerned,\" he remarked\r\nplausibly, \"it is open for any man, whatever his politics may be, to do\r\nthat from morning to night all his life if he likes, so long as it isn't\r\nfor an illegal object. As regards Salt having been engaged this way for\r\nthe past month, it is quite true that I have had no intimation of the\r\nfact so far. I may explain that as my Department has not yet come to\r\nregard the Unity League as the one object in the world to which it must\r\ndevote its whole attention, I am not in the habit of receiving reports\r\non the subject every day, nor even every week. It may be, however----\"\r\n\r\nThere was another knock upon the door. Mr Tubes stopped, and the Premier\r\nfrowned. In the space between the door and the carpet there appeared for\r\na second a scrap of paper; the next moment it came skimming a few yards\r\ninto the room. There was no attempt to hold further communication, and\r\nthe footsteps of the silent messenger were heard descending the stairs\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMr Vossit, who sat nearest to the door, picked up the little oblong\r\ncard. He saw, as he could scarcely fail to see, that it was an ordinary\r\nvisiting-card, and on the upper side, as it lay, there appeared a\r\nroughly-pencilled sign--two lines at right angle drawn through a\r\nsemicircle, it appeared superficially to be. As he handed it to Mr Tubes\r\nhe reversed the position so that the name should be uppermost, and again\r\nhe saw, as he could scarcely fail to see, that the other side was blank.\r\nThe roughly-pencilled diagram was all the message it contained.\r\n\r\n\"It may be, however----\" the Home Secretary was repeating\r\nhalf-mechanically. He took the card and glanced at the symbol it bore.\r\n\"It may be, however,\" he continued, as though there had been no\r\ninterruption, \"that I shall very soon be in possession of the full facts\r\nto lay before you.\" Then with a few whispered words to the Premier and a\r\ncomprehensive murmur of apology to the rest of the company, he withdrew.\r\n\r\nFully a quarter of an hour passed before there was any sign of the\r\nabsent Minister, and then it did not take the form of his return. The\r\nconversation, in his absence, had worked round to the engaging\r\nalternative of whether it was more correct to educate one's son at Eton\r\nor at Margate College, when a message was sent up requesting the\r\nPremier's attendance in another room. After another quarter of an hour\r\nsome one was heard to leave the house, but it was ten minutes later\r\nbefore the two men returned. It was felt in the atmosphere that some new\r\ndevelopment was at hand, and they had to run the curious scrutiny of\r\nevery eye. Both had an air of constraint, and both were rather pale. The\r\nPremier moved to his seat with brusque indifference, and one who knew\r\nTubes well passed a whispered warning that Jim had got his storm-cone\r\nfairly hoisted. The door was locked again, chairs were drawn up to the\r\ntable, and a hush of marked expectancy settled over the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister spoke first.\r\n\r\n\"In the past half-hour a letter has come into our possession that may\r\ncause us to alter our arrangements,\" he announced baldly. \"How it came\r\ninto our possession doesn't matter. All that does matter is, that it's\r\ngenuine. Tubes will read it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is signed 'John Hampden,' addressed to Robert Estair, and dated\r\nthree days ago,\" contributed the Home Secretary just as briefly. \"The\r\noriginal was in cipher. This is the deciphered form:\r\n\r\n     \"'MY DEAR ESTAIR,--I now have Salt's complete report before me,\r\n     and there seems to be no doubt that the proposal I have\r\n     formulated is feasible, and the moment almost ripe. Salt has\r\n     covered all the most important industrial centres, and\r\n     everywhere the reports of our agents are favourable to the\r\n     plan. Not having found universal happiness and a complete\r\n     immunity from the cares incident to humanity in the privileges\r\n     which they so ardently desired and have now obtained, the\r\n     working classes are tending to believe that the panacea must\r\n     lie, not in greater moderation, but in extended privilege.\r\n\r\n     \"'For the moment the present Government is indisposed to go\r\n     much further, not possessing the funds necessary for enlarged\r\n     concessions and fearing that increased taxation might result in\r\n     a serious stream of emigration among the monied classes. For\r\n     the moment the working men hesitate to throw in their lot with\r\n     the extreme Socialists, distrusting the revolutionary and\r\n     anarchical wing of that party, and instinctively feeling that\r\n     any temporary advantage which they might enjoy would soon be\r\n     swallowed up in the reign of open lawlessness that must\r\n     inevitably arise.\r\n\r\n     \"'For the moment, therefore, there is a pause, and now occurs\r\n     the opportunity--perhaps the last in history--for us to\r\n     retrieve some of the losses of the past. There are scruples to\r\n     be overcome, but I do not think that an alliance with the\r\n     moderate section of the Labour interest is inconsistent with\r\n     the aims and traditions of the great parties which our League\r\n     represents. It would, of course, be necessary to guarantee to\r\n     our new allies the privileges which they now possess, and even\r\n     to promise more; but I am convinced, not only by past\r\n     experience but also by specific assurances from certain\r\n     quarters, that they would prefer to remain as they are, and\r\n     form an alliance with us rather than grasp at larger gains and\r\n     suffer absorption into another party which they dare not trust.\r\n\r\n     \"'From the definite nature of this statement you will gather\r\n     that the negotiations are more than in the air. The\r\n     distribution of Cabinet offices will have to be considered at\r\n     once. B---- might be first gained over with the offer of the\r\n     Exchequer. He carries great weight with a considerable section\r\n     of his party, and is dissatisfied with his recognition so far.\r\n     Heape is a representative man who would repay early attention,\r\n     especially as he is, at the moment, envious of R----'s better\r\n     treatment. But these are matters of detail. The great thing is\r\n     to _get back on any terms_. Once in power, by a modification of\r\n     the franchise we might make good our position. I trust that\r\n     this, a desperate remedy in a desperate time, will earn at\r\n     least your tacit acquiescence. Much is irretrievably lost;\r\n     England remains--yet.\r\n\r\n     \"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     \"JOHN HAMPDEN.'\"\r\n\r\nSix men were on their feet before the signature was reached. With an\r\nimpatient gesture Strummery waved them collectively aside.\r\n\r\n\"We all know your opinion on the writer and the letter, and we can all\r\nput it into our own words without wasting time in listening,\" he said\r\nwith suppressed fury. \"In five minutes' time I shall entirely reopen the\r\nconsideration of the reports which we met this afternoon to discuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has any effort been made to learn the nature of Estair's reply?\"\r\nenquired Tirrel. If he was not the least moved man in the room he was\r\nthe least perturbed, and he instinctively picked out the only point of\r\nimportance that remained.\r\n\r\n\"It probably does not exist in writing,\" replied Mr Tubes, avoiding\r\nTirrel's steady gaze. \"I find that he arrived in town last night. There\r\nwould certainly be a meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Bannister summoned to this Council?\" demanded another. It was taken\r\nfor granted that \"B\" stood for Bannister.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Premier, with one eye on his watch. \"He was\r\nindisposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I protest against the reference to myself,\" said Heape coldly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr Strummery nodded. \"Time's up,\" he announced.\r\n\r\nThat is the \"secret history\" of the Government's sudden and inexplicable\r\nconversion to the necessity of the Minimum Wage Bill and to the\r\npropriety of imposing the Personal Property Tax. A fortnight later the\r\nPrime Minister outlined the programme in the course of a speech at\r\nNewcastle. The announcement was received almost with stupefaction. For\r\nthe first time in history, property--money, merchandise, personal\r\nbelongings--was to be saddled with an annual tax apart from, and in\r\naddition to, the tax it paid on the incomes derived from it. It was an\r\nentire wedge of the extreme policy that must end in Partition. It was\r\nmore than the poorer classes had dared to hope; it was more than the\r\ntax-paying classes had dared to fear. It marked a new era of extended\r\nprivilege for the one; it marked the final extinction of hope even among\r\nthe hopeful for the other.\r\n\r\n\"It could not have happened more opportunely for us even if we had\r\narranged it in every detail,\" declared Hampden, going into Salt's room\r\nwith the tidings in huge delight, a fortnight later.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" agreed Salt, looking up with his slow, pleasant smile. \"Not even\r\nif we had arranged it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF ST MARTIN OF TOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Hampden paused for a moment with arrested pen. He had been in\r\nthe act of crossing off another day on the calendar that hung inside his\r\ndesk, the last detail before he pulled the roll-top down for the night,\r\nwhen the date had caught his eye with a sudden meaning.\r\n\r\n\"A week to-day, Salt,\" he remarked, looking up.\r\n\r\n\"A week to-day,\" repeated Salt. \"That gives us seven more days for\r\ndetails.\"\r\n\r\nHampden laughed quietly as he bent forward and continued the red line\r\nthrough the \"14.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is one way of looking at it,\" he said. \"Personally, I was rather\r\nwishing that it had been to-day. I confess that I cannot watch the\r\nclimax of these two years approaching without feeling keyed up to\r\nconcert pitch. I suppose that you never had any nerves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not. If I had, the Atlantic water soon washed them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are superstitious?\" he asked curiously. It suddenly occurred to\r\nhim how little he really knew of the man with whom he was linked in such\r\na momentous hazard.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. Blue water inoculates us all with that. Fortunately, mine does\r\nnot go beyond trifles, such as touching posts and stepping over paving\r\nstones--a hobby and not a passion, or I should have to curb it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really do things like that? Well, I remember Northland, the\r\ngreat nerve specialist, telling me that most people have something of\r\nthe sort--a persistent feeling of impending calamity unless they conform\r\nto some trivial impulse. I am exempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" commented Salt; \"or you would hardly be likely to cross off the\r\ndate before the day is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens!\" exclaimed Hampden. \"What an age we live in! Is it tannin\r\nor the dregs of paganism? And you think it would be tempting Providence\r\nto do it while there are five more hours to run?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never do it, as a matter of fact,\" admitted Salt with perfect\r\nseriousness. \"Of course, I _know_ that nothing would happen in the five\r\nhours if I did, but, all the same, I rather think that something would.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that something will,\" said Hampden cheerfully. \"Dinner, for\r\nexample. Did I ever strike you as a gourmet, Salt? Well, nevertheless, I\r\nam a terrific believer in regular meals, although I don't care a straw\r\nhow simple they are. You may read of some marvellous Trojan working\r\nunder heavy pressure for twenty-four hours, and then snatching a hurried\r\nglass of Chateau d'Yquem and a couple of Abernethy biscuits, and going\r\non again for another twenty-four. Don't believe it, Salt. If he is not\r\nused to it, his knees go; if he is used to it, they have gone already.\r\nIf I were a general I solemnly declare that I would risk more to feed my\r\nmen before an engagement, than I would risk to hold the best position\r\nall along the front. Your hungry man may fight well enough for a time,\r\nbut the moment he is beaten he knows it. And, strangely enough, we\r\nEnglish have won a good many important battles after we had been\r\nbeaten.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been locking up the safe and desk as he ran on, and now they\r\nwalked together down the corridor. At the door of his own office Salt\r\nexcused himself for a moment and went in. When he rejoined the baronet\r\nat the outer door, he held in his hand a little square of thin paper on\r\nwhich was printed in bold type\r\n\r\n     JULY 14.\r\n\r\n\"You will regret it,\" said Hampden, not wholly jestingly. He saw at once\r\nthat it was the tag for the day, torn from his calendar, that Salt held.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied, crumpling up the scrap of paper and throwing it away,\r\n\"I may remember, but I shall not regret. When you have to think twice\r\nabout doing a thing like that, it is time to do it.... You have no\r\nparticular message for Deland?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all, personally, I think. You will tell him as much as we\r\ndecided upon. Let him know that his post will certainly be one of the\r\nmost important outside the central office. What time do you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"The 10 train from Marylebone. Deland will be waiting up for me. There\r\nis an early restaurant train in the morning--the 7.20, getting in at\r\n10.40. I shall breakfast _en route_, and come straight on here.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Look out for young Hampshire in the train; he will\r\nprobably wait on you, but you won't recognise him unless you remember\r\nthe Manners-Clinton nose in profile. He regards it as a vast joke, but\r\nhe is very keen. And sleep all the time you aren't feeding. Can't do\r\nbetter. Good night.\"\r\n\r\nSalt laughed as he turned into Pall Mall, speculating for a moment, by\r\nthe light of his own knowledge, how little time this strenuous,\r\nsimple-living man devoted to the things he advocated. If he had been\r\nable to follow Sir John's electric brougham for the remainder of that\r\nnight he would have had still more reason to be sceptical.\r\n\r\nWhen Hampden reached his house and strode up to the door with the\r\nelastic step of a young man, despite his iron-grey hair and burden of\r\nresponsibility, instead of the bronze Medusa knocker that had dropped\r\nfrom the hands of Pietro Sarpi and Donato in its time, his eyes\r\nencountered the smiling face of his daughter as she swung open the door\r\nbefore him. She had been sitting at an open window of the dull-fronted\r\nhouse until she saw the Hampden livery in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"There is some one waiting in the library to see you,\" she said, as he\r\nkissed her cheek. \"He said that he would wait ten minutes; you had\r\nalready been seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" he asked in quiet expectation. It was not unusual for\r\nMuriel to watch for him from the upper room, and to come down into the\r\nhall to welcome him, but to-night he saw at once that there was a mild\r\nexcitement in her manner. \"Who is it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe told him in half a dozen whispered words, and then returned to the\r\ndrawing-room and the society of a depressing companion, who chanced to\r\nbe a poor and distant cousin, while Sir John turned toward the library.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Styles to remain with the brougham if he is still in front,\" he\r\nsaid to a passing footman. The visit might presage anything.\r\n\r\nA young man, an inconspicuous young man in a blue serge suit, rose from\r\nthe chair of Jacobean oak and Spanish leather where he had been sitting\r\nwith a bowler hat between his hands and a cheap umbrella across his\r\nknees, and made a cursory bow as he began to search an inner pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Hampden?\" he enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the master of the house, favouring his visitor with a\r\nmore curious attention than he received in return. \"You are from\r\nPlantagenet House, I believe?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man detached his left hand from the search and turned down the\r\nlapel of his coat in a perfunctory display of his credentials. Pinned\r\nbeneath so that it should not obtrude was an insignificant little medal,\r\nso small and trivial that it would require the closest scrutiny to\r\ndistinguish its design and lettering.\r\n\r\nBut Sir John Hampden did not require any assurance upon the point. He\r\nknew by the evidence of just such another medallion which lay in his own\r\npossession that upon one side, around the engraved name of the holder,\r\nran the inscription, \"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart;\"\r\nupon the other side a representation of St Martin dividing his cloak\r\nwith the beggar. It was the badge of the Order of St Martin of Tours.\r\n\r\nThe Order of St Martin embodied the last phase of organised benevolence.\r\nIn the history of the world there had never been a time when men so\r\npassionately desired to help their fellow men; there had never been a\r\ntime when they found it more difficult to do so to their satisfaction.\r\nFrom the lips of every social reformer, from the reports of the\r\ncharitable organisations, from the testimony of the poor themselves the\r\nbroad indictment had gone forth that every casual beggar was a rogue and\r\na vagabond. Promiscuous alms-giving was tabulated among the Seven Curses\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nOrganised charity was the readiest alternative. Again obliging\r\ncounsellors raised their conscientious voices. Organised charity was\r\nwasteful, inelastic, unsympathetic, often superfluous. The preacher\r\nadded a warning note: Let none think that the easy donation of a cheque\r\nhere and there was charity. It was frequently vanity, it was often a\r\ncowardly compromise with conscience, it was never an absolution from the\r\nindividual responsibility.\r\n\r\nSo brotherly love continued, but often did not fructify, and the man who\r\nfelt that he had the true Samaritan instinct, as he passed by on the one\r\nside of the suburban road, looked at his ragged neighbour lying under\r\nthe hedge on the other side in a fit which might be epilepsy but might\r\nequally well be soap-suds in the mouth, and assured himself that if only\r\nhe could believe the case to be genuine there was nothing on earth he\r\nwould not do for the man.\r\n\r\nIt was a very difficult age, every one admitted: \"Society was so\r\ncomplex.\"\r\n\r\nThere was evidence of the generous feeling--ill-balanced and spasmodic,\r\nit is true--on every hand. The poor were bravely, almost blindly, good\r\nto their neighbours in misfortune. The better-off were lavish--or had\r\nbeen until a few years previously--when they had certified proof that\r\nthe cases were deserving. If a magistrate or a police court missionary\r\ngave publicity to a Pathetic Case, the Pathetic Case might be sure of\r\nbeing able to retire on a comfortable annuity. If only every Pathetic\r\nCase could have been induced to come pathetically into the clutches of a\r\nsympathetic police court cadi, instead of dying quite as pathetically in\r\na rat-hole, one of the most pressing problems of benevolence might have\r\nbeen satisfactorily solved.\r\n\r\nThe Order of St Martin of Tours was one of the attempts to reconcile the\r\ngenerous yearnings of mankind with modern conditions. Its field of\r\naction had no definable limit, and whatever a man wished to give it was\r\nprepared to utilise. It was not primarily concerned with money, although\r\njudged by the guaranteed resources upon which it could call if\r\nnecessary, it would rank as a rich society. It imposed no subscription\r\nand made no outside appeal. Upon its books, against the name of every\r\nmember, there was entered what he bound himself to do when it was\r\nrequired of him. It was a vast and comprehensive list, so varied that\r\nfew ever genuinely applied for the services of the Order without their\r\nneeds being satisfied. The city man willing to give a foolish and\r\nrepentant youth another chance of honest work; the Sussex farmer anxious\r\nto prove what a month of South Down fare and Channel breezes would do\r\nfor a small city convalescent; the prim little suburban lady, much too\r\ntimid to attempt any personal contact with the unknown depths of sin and\r\nsuffering, but eager to send her choicest flowers and most perfect fruit\r\nto any slum sick-room; the good-hearted laundry girl who had been\r\nthrough the fires herself, offering to \"pal up to any other girl what's\r\nhaving a bit of rough and wants to keep straight without a lot of\r\njaw,\"--all found a deeper use in life beneath the sign of St Martin's\r\ndivided cloak. Children, even little children, were not shut out; they\r\ncould play with other, lonely, little children, and renounce some toys.\r\n\r\nThe inconspicuous young man standing in Sir John Hampden's library--he\r\nwas in a cheap boot shop, but he gave his early closing day to serve the\r\nOrder as a messenger, and there were millionaires who gave less--found\r\nthe thing he searched for, and handed to Sir John an unsealed envelope.\r\n\r\n\"I accept,\" said the baronet, after glancing at the slip it contained.\r\nThis was what he accepted:\r\n\r\n    ORDER OF ST. MARTIN OF TOURS.\r\n\r\n    _Case_. . . John Flak, 45 Paradise Buildings,\r\n                     Paradise Street, Drury Lane, W.C.\r\n\r\n    _Cause_ . . Street Accident.\r\n\r\n    _Requirement_ Service through the night.\r\n\r\n    _Recommender_ L. K. Stone, M.D., 172 Great Queen\r\n                       Street, W.C.\r\n\r\n    WALTHAM, MASTER.\r\n\r\nHe could have declined; and his membership would have been at an end.\r\nBut in a mission of personal service he could not accept and appoint a\r\nsubstitute. The Order was modern, business-like, reasonable,\r\nunemotional, and quite prepared to take humanity as it was. It did not\r\nseek to impose the ideal Christian standard, logically recognising that\r\nif a man gave _all_ he possessed, a system of Christian laws (a Caesar\r\nwhom he was likewise bidden to obey) would at once incarcerate him in a\r\nprison for having no visible means of subsistence, and, if he persisted\r\nin his unnatural Christian conduct, in a lunatic asylum, where in its\r\nappointed season he would have the story of the Rich Ruler read for his\r\nedification.\r\n\r\nThe Order was practical and \"very nice to do with;\" but it had a\r\nstandard, and as a protest against that widespread reliance in the\r\nomnipotence of gold that marred the age it allowed no delegation of an\r\noffice of mercy. On all points it was open; its thin medallion\r\nsymbolised no mysteries or secret vows; nor, and on this one point it\r\nwas unbending, as far as lay in the power of the Order should any\r\nsecond-hand virtue find place beneath its saintly ensign.\r\n\r\nA few years before, Paradise Street, with that marked inappropriateness\r\nthat may be traced in the nomenclature of many London thoroughfares, had\r\nbeen the foulest, poorest, noisomest, most garbage-strewn and\r\nfly-infested region even in the purlieus of Drury Lane. It was not\r\nmarkedly criminal, it was merely filthy; and when smell-diseases broke\r\nout in central London it was generally found that they radiated from\r\nParadise Street like ripples from a dead dog thrown into a pond.\r\nPresently a type foundry in the next street, growing backwards because\r\nit was impossible to expand further in any other direction, pushed down\r\nthe flimsy tenements that stood between and reared a high wall, pierced\r\nwith windows of prismatic glass, in their place. Soon public\r\nauthorities, seeing that the heavens did not fall when a quarter of\r\nParadise Street did, suddenly and unexpectedly tore down another quarter\r\nas though they had received a maddened impulse and Paradise Street had\r\nbeen a cardboard model. The phoenix that appeared on this site was a\r\nseven-storied block of workmen's dwellings. It could not be said to have\r\ngiven universal satisfaction. The municipal authorities who devised it\r\nbickered entertainingly over most of the details that lay between the\r\nfoundations and the chimney-pots; the primitive dwellers in Paradise\r\nStreet looked askance at it, as they did at most things not in liquid\r\nform; social reformers complained that it drove away the very poor and\r\nbrought in a class of only medium poor; and ordinary people noticed that\r\nin place of the nearest approach to artistic dirt to be found in the\r\nmetropolis, some one had substituted uninteresting squalor.\r\n\r\nHampden dismissed his carriage in Lincoln's Inn Fields and walked the\r\nremainder of the way. He had changed into a dark lounge suit before he\r\nleft, but, in spite of the principle he had so positively laid down, he\r\nhad not stayed to dine. The inevitable, morbid little group marked the\r\nentrance to Paradise Buildings, but the incident was already three hours\r\nold, and the larger public interest was being reserved for the\r\nanticipated funeral.\r\n\r\nA slipshod, smug-faced woman opened the door of No. 45 in response to\r\nhis discreet knock. He stepped into a small hall where coal was stored\r\nin a packing-case, and, on her invitation, through into the front room.\r\nFive more untidy women, who had been drinking from three cups, got up as\r\nhe entered, and passed out, eyeing him with respectful curiosity as they\r\nwent, and each dropping a word of friendly leavetaking to the slatternly\r\nhostess.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be down'arted, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"See you later, Emm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's know how things are going, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll remember about that black alpaker body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so long, Mrs Flak. Gord bless yer.\"\r\n\r\nSir John waited until the hall door closed behind the last frowsy woman.\r\n\r\n\"I am here to be of any use I can,\" he said. \"Did Dr Stone mention that\r\nsome one would come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,\" she replied. She stood in the middle of the\r\nroom, a picture of domestic incapacity, with a foolish look upon her\r\nrather comely features. The room was not bare of furniture, was not\r\ndevoid of working-class comforts, but the dirty dishes, the dirty\r\nclothing, the dirty floor, told the plain tale.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know any particulars of the case yet.\" He saw at once that he\r\nwould have to take the lead in every detail. \"Did the doctor speak of\r\ncoming again, or leave any message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" she replied readily. She lifted an ornament on the\r\nmantelpiece and gave him a folded sheet of paper, torn from a note-book,\r\nthat had been placed there for safety. He had the clearest impression\r\nthat it would never have occurred to the woman to give it to him\r\nunasked.\r\n\r\n\"To rep of O. St M.,\" ran the pencilled scrawl. \"Shall endeavour to look\r\nin 8-8.30.--L.K.S.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he took out his watch there came a business-like knock at the\r\ndoor, an active step in the hall, and beneath the conventional greeting,\r\nthe two men were weighing one another.\r\n\r\nDr Stone had asked the Order to send a man of common-sense who could\r\nexercise authority if need be, and one who would not be squeamish in his\r\nsurroundings. For reasons of his own he had added that if with these\r\nqualifications he combined that of being a Justice of the Peace, so much\r\nthe better. Dr Stone judged that he had the man before him. Hampden saw\r\na brisk, not too well shaven, man in a light suit, with a straw hat and\r\na serviceable stick in his hands, until he threw them on the table.\r\nThere was kindness and decision behind his alert eyes, and his manner\r\nwas that of a benevolent despot marshalling his poor patients--and he\r\nhad few others--as a regiment before him, marching them right and left\r\nin companies, bringing them sharply to the front, and bidding them to\r\nstand there and do nothing until they were told.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't been into the other room yet?\" he asked. \"No, well----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped with his hand on the door knob, turned back like a pointer on\r\nthe suspicion of a trail, and looked keenly at the woman, then around\r\nthe bestrewn room. If her eyes had slid the least betraying glance,\r\nHampden did not observe it, but the doctor, without a word, strode to\r\nthe littered couch, put his hand behind a threadbare cushion, and drew\r\nout a half-filled bottle. There was a gluggling ripple for a few\r\nseconds, and the contents had disappeared down the sink, while the\r\nterebinthine odour of cheap gin hung across the room.\r\n\r\n\"Not here, Mrs Flak,\" he said sharply; and without changing her\r\nexpression of vacuous good-nature, the woman meekly replied, \"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nDr Stone led the way into the inner room and closed the door behind\r\nthem. A man, asleep, insensible, or dead, lay on the bed, his face half\r\nhidden in bandages.\r\n\r\n\"This is the position,\" explained the doctor, speaking very rapidly, for\r\nhis time was mapped out with as little waste as there is to be found\r\nbetween the squares on a chess board. \"This man went out of here a few\r\nhours ago and walked straight into an empty motor 'bus that was going\r\nround this way. That's how they all put it: he walked right into the\r\nthing. Why? He was a sober enough man, an attendant of some kind at one\r\nof the west end clubs. Because, as I have good reason to suppose, he was\r\nthinking absorbingly of something else.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they carried him in here; it ought to have been the hospital, of\r\ncourse, but it was at his own doorstep it took place, you see, and it\r\ndoesn't really matter, because to-morrow morning----!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will die then?\" asked Hampden in a whisper, interpreting the quick\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he will die as sure as his head is a cracked egg-shell. Between\r\nmidnight and dawn, I should say. But before the end I look confidently\r\nfor an interval of consciousness, or rather sub-consciousness. If I am\r\nwrong I shall have kept you up all night for nothing; if I am right you\r\nwill probably hear something that he wants to say very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever was in his mind when he met with the accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my conviction. There has already been an indication of partial\r\nexpression. Curiously enough, I have had two exactly similar cases, and\r\nthis is going just the same way. In one it was a sum of money a man had\r\nbanked under another name to keep it from his wife and for his children;\r\nin the second it was a blow struck in a scuffle, and an innocent man was\r\ndoing penal servitude for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what you wished to have some one here for chiefly, then?\" asked\r\nHampden.\r\n\r\n\"Everything, practically. You see the kind of people around? The wife is\r\na fool; the neighbours are the class of maddening dolts who leave a\r\nsuicide hanging until a policeman comes to cut him down. They would hold\r\nan orgie in the next room. In excitement the women fly to gin as\r\ninstinctively as a nun flies to prayer. Order them out if they come, but\r\nI don't think that they will trouble you after I have spoken to the\r\nwoman as I go. If there is anything to be caught it will have to be on\r\nthe hop, so to speak. It may be a confession, a deposition of legal\r\nvalue, or only a request; one cannot guess. Questioning, when the\r\nsub-conscious stage is reached, might lead to something. It's largely a\r\nmatter of luck, but intelligence may have an innings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing to be done--in the way of making it easier for him?\"\r\n\r\nDr Stone made a face expressive of their helplessness and shrugged his\r\nshoulders; then mentioned a few simple details.\r\n\r\n\"He will never know,\" he explained. \"Even when he seems conscious he\r\nwill feel no pain and remember nothing of the accident. The clock will\r\nbe mercifully set back.\" He smiled whimsically. \"Forgive me if it never\r\nstrikes.\" He turned to go. \"The nearest call office is the kiosk in\r\nAldwych,\" he remarked. \"I am 7406 Covent Garden.\" No paper being visible\r\nhe wrote the number on the wall. \"After 10.30 as a general thing,\" he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nSo the baronet was left alone with the still figure that counterfeited\r\ndeath so well, the man who would be dead before the dawn. He stepped\r\nquietly to the bed and looked down on him. The lower half of the face\r\nwas free from swathing, and the lean throat and grizzled beard struck\r\nSir John with a momentary surprise. It was the face of an elderly man;\r\nhe had expected to find one not more than middle-aged as the companion\r\nof the young woman in the other room.\r\n\r\nThere was a single chair against the wall, and he sat down. There was\r\nnothing else to do but to sit and wait, to listen to the sounds of\r\nvoluminous life that rose from the street beneath, the careful creaking\r\nmovements in the room beyond. From the shallow wainscotting near the bed\r\ncame at intervals the steady ticking of a death-watch. It was nothing,\r\nas every one knew, but the note of an insect calling for its mate, but\r\nit thrilled and grew large in the stillness of the chamber ominously.\r\n\r\nA low tap on the door came as a relief. He found the woman standing\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything different?\" she asked, hanging on to the door. \"I\r\nkept on thinking I heard noises.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there is no change,\" he replied. \"Will you come in?\"\r\n\r\nShe shrank back at the suggestion. \"Gord 'elp us, no!\" she cried. \"It's\r\nbad enough out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you afraid of?\" he asked kindly.\r\n\r\nShe had no words for it. Self-analysis did not enter into her daily\r\nlife. But, sitting there alone among the noises, real and imagined, she\r\nhad reached a state of terror.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing at all dreadful, nothing that would shock you,\" he\r\nsaid, referring to the appearance of the dying man. \"You are his wife,\r\nare you not?\"\r\n\r\nThe foolish look, half stubborn, half vacuous, flickered about her face.\r\n\"As good as,\" she replied. \"It's like this----\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\" He had no desire to hear the recital of the sordid details.\r\n\r\n\"His wife's in a mad-house. Won't never be anywhere else, and I've been\r\nwith him these five years, an honest woman to him all the time,\" she\r\nsaid, bridling somewhat at the suggestion of reproach. \"No one's got no\r\nbetter right to the things, I'm sure.\" Her eloquence was stirred not so\r\nmuch to defend her reputation as by the fear that some one might step in\r\nto claim \"the things.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be plenty of time to talk about that when--when it is\r\nnecessary,\" he said. \"Has he no relations about here who ought to be\r\ntold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah,\" she said decisively; \"no one but me. Why, he didn't even have no\r\nfriends--no pals of his own class, as you may say. Very close about\r\nhimself he was. All he thought of was them political corkses, as they\r\ncall um.\" She came nearer to the door again, the gossiping passion of\r\nher class stronger than her fear, now that the earlier restraint of his\r\npresence was wearing off. \"It's the only thing we ever had a 'arsh word\r\nabout. It's all right and well for them that make a living at it, but\r\nmany and many a time my 'usband's lost 'alf a day two and three times a\r\nweek to sit in the Distingwidged Strangers' Gallery. You mightn't 'ardly\r\nthink it, sir, but he was hand and foot with some of the biggest men\r\nthere are; he was indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHampden was looking at her curiously. He read into her \"'arsh word\" the\r\nceaseless clatter of her nagging, shameless tongue when the old man\r\nbrought home a few shillings less than he was wont; the aftermath of\r\nsullen silence, the unprepared meals and neglected home. He pictured him\r\na patient, long-suffering old man, and pitied him. And now she took\r\npride and boasted of the very things that she had upbraided him with.\r\n\r\n\"Vickers he knew,\" she continued complacently, \"and Drugget. He's shaken\r\nhands with Mr Strummery, the Prime Minister, more than onest. Then\r\nTubes--you've heard speak of him?--he found Mr Tubes a very pleasant\r\ngentleman. Oh, and a lot more I can't remember.\"\r\n\r\nHampden disengaged himself from further conversation with a single\r\nformal sentence, and returned to his vigil. There he was secure from her\r\ncallous chatter. He saw the renewed look of terror start into her eyes\r\nwhen a board behind her creaked as the door was closing. He heard the\r\nstartled shriek, but her squalid avarice cut off his sympathies. He sat\r\ndown again and looked round at the already familiar objects in the room.\r\nThe form lying on the bed had not changed a fraction of its rigid\r\noutline; but he missed something somewhere in the room, and for a minute\r\nhe could not identify it. Then he remembered the ticking of the\r\ndeath-watch. It had ceased. He looked at his watch; it was not yet nine\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nHe had not been back more than ten minutes when the subdued tapping--it\r\nwas rather a timid scrape, as though she feared that a louder summons\r\nmight call another forth--was repeated.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that it's no good my staying here,\" she gasped. \"I've been\r\nsitting there till the furniture fair began to move towards me, and\r\nevery bloomin' rag about the place had a face in it. It's giving me the\r\nfair horrors.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not ignore her half-frenzied state. \"What do you want to do?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"I want to go out for a bit,\" she replied, licking her thin feline lips.\r\n\"You don't know what it's like. I want to hear real people talk and not\r\nsee things move. I'll come back soon; before Gord, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _how_ will you came back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't. May it strike me dead if I touch a drop. I'll go straight into\r\nMrs Rugg's across the street, and she's almost what you might call a\r\nteetotaler.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man you call your husband is dying in there, and he may need your\r\nhelp at any minute,\" he said sternly. It needed no gift of divination to\r\nprophesy that if the woman once left the place she would be hopelessly\r\ndrunk before an hour had passed. \"Don't sit down doing nothing but\r\nimagining things,\" he continued. \"Make yourself some tea, and then when\r\none of your friends comes round to see you, you can let her stay. But\r\nonly one, mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw the more sullen of her looks settle darkly about her face as he\r\nclosed the door. He waited to hear the sound of the kettle being moved,\r\nthe tea-cup clinking, but they never came. An unnatural, uncreaking\r\nsilence reigned instead. He opened the door quietly and looked out. That\r\nroom was empty, and, as he stood there, a current of cooler air fell\r\nacross his cheek. Half a dozen steps brought him to the entrance to the\r\nlittle hall--the only other room there was. It also was empty, and the\r\nfront door stood widely open. There was only one possible inference:\r\n\"Mrs Flak\" had fled.\r\n\r\nSir John had confessed to possessing nerves, and to few men the\r\nsituation would have been an inviting one. Still, there was only one\r\npossible thing to do, and he closed the door again, noticing, as he did\r\nso, that the action locked it. As he stood there a moment before\r\nreturning to the bedroom and its tranquil occupant lying in his rigid,\r\nunbreathing sleep, a slight but continuous sound caught his ear. It was\r\nthe most closely comparable (to attempt to define it) with the whirring\r\nof a clock as the flying pinion is released before it strikes. Or it\r\nmight be that the doctor's simile prompted the comparison. It was not\r\nloud, but the room beyond seemed very, very still.\r\n\r\nIt was not a time to temporise with the emotions. Hampden stepped into\r\nthe next room and stood listening. He judged--nay, he was sure--that the\r\nsound came from the bedroom, but it was not repeated. Instead, something\r\nvery different happened, something that was either terrifying or\r\nnatural, according to the conditions that provoked it. Quite without\r\nwarning there came a voice from the next room, a full, level, healthy\r\nvoice, even strong, and speaking in the ordinary manner of conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Will you please tell Mr Tubes that I am waiting here to see him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMAN BETWEEN TWO MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was something in the situation that was more than gruesome,\r\nsomething that was peculiarly unnerving.\r\n\r\nIn his anticipation of this moment as he had sat almost by the bedside,\r\nHampden had conjectured that the dying man would perhaps lift a hand or\r\nmove his head uneasily with the first instinct of returning\r\nconsciousness. A sigh, a groan, might escape him, incoherent words\r\nfollow, then broken but rational expressions of his suffering, and\r\nentreaties that something might be done to ease the pain. Or perhaps,\r\nafter realising his position, he would nerve himself to betray no\r\nunmanly weakness, and, in the words of the significant old phrase,\r\n\"turning his face to the wall,\" endure in stoical silence to the end. It\r\nwould be painful, perhaps acutely distressing, but it would not be\r\nunnatural.\r\n\r\nThere had been no groan, no sigh or broken words, no indication of\r\nweakness or suffering behind that half-closed door, nothing but the\r\ncurious clock-like sound that had gone before the voice. And that voice!\r\nIt was as full and strong, as vibrant and as ordinary as his own could\r\never be. Standing in the middle of the living-room Sir John could not\r\ndeceive himself. It came from the other room where a minute before he\r\nhad left the dying--yes, the almost dead--man lying with stark outline\r\non the bed. There was no alternative: it was from those pallid lips that\r\nthe words had come, it was by that still, inanimate man that they were\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the whole incident was shocking in itself, but that\r\nwas not all; the mere contrast to what he had looked for was\r\ndisconcerting, but there was something more; the curious unexpected\r\nnature of the request, if request it was, was not without its element of\r\nmystery, but above and beyond all else was the thought--the thought that\r\nfor a dreadful moment held his heart and soul in icy bonds--what sight\r\nwhen he returned to the inner room, as return at once he must, what\r\ngruesome sight would meet his eyes?\r\n\r\nWhat phantoms his misgivings raised, every man may conjecture for\r\nhimself. Follow, then, another step in imagination, and having given a\r\nsomewhat free and ghastly fancy rein, push the chamber door cautiously\r\nand inch by inch, or fling it boldly open as you will; then pause upon\r\nthe threshold, as Hampden did, in sharp surprise.\r\n\r\nNothing was altered, no single detail had undergone the slightest\r\nchange! On the bed, rigid and very sharp beneath the single unclean\r\nsheet, lay the body of the mangled man. Not a fold of his shroud-like\r\nwrapping differed from its former line, it did not seem possible that a\r\nbreath had stirred him.\r\n\r\nHad the voice been a trick of the imagination? Hampden knew, as far as\r\nmortal man can be sure of any mortal sense, that the voice had been as\r\nreal as his life itself. Then----? It occurred to him in a flash: here\r\nwas the stage of under-consciousness of which Dr Stone had spoken. Of\r\nhis pain, the accident, where he at that moment lay, and all his real\r\nsurroundings, the sufferer knew nothing, and never would know. But out\r\nof the shock and shattering, some of the delicate machinery of the brain\r\nstill kept its balance, and would continue to exercise its functions to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordeal, but it had to be done. It was the purpose for which he\r\nhad been summoned. Sir John moved to the bedside, nerved himself to\r\nwatch the ashen face, and said slowly and distinctly: \"Mr Tubes is not\r\nhere. Do you wish to see him?\"\r\n\r\nThere was just a perceptible pause, and then the bloodless lips replied.\r\nBut not the faintest tremor of a movement stirred the body otherwise\r\nfrom head to foot, and in the chilling absence of expression the simile\r\noccurred to Hampden of bubbles rising from some unseen working to the\r\nsurface of an inky pool.\r\n\r\n\"I have come on purpose. Let him be told that it is most important.\"\r\n\r\nHampden had to feel his way. The woman had mentioned that Flak was at\r\nleast on terms of acquaintanceship with Mr Tubes. The doctor had\r\nsurmised that the man had something he must say before he died. But was\r\nthis the one true line, or a mere vagary of the sub-conscious state--a\r\ntwist in the tortuous labyrinth that would lead to nothing?\r\n\r\n\"He is not here at present,\" he said. \"If you will tell me what you wish\r\nto say I will write it down, so that it cannot fail to reach him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I cannot tell any one else. I must see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Tubes is a very busy man. You know that he is the Home Secretary. Is\r\nit of sufficient importance to telegraph for him?\"\r\n\r\nThis time the answer followed on his last word with startling rapidity.\r\nUntil the last phase that was the only variation in the delivery of the\r\nsentences--that sometimes there was a pause as though the working of the\r\nmind had to make a revolution before it reached the point of the mental\r\nclutch, at others it dropped into its gear at once.\r\n\r\n\"It is important enough to send a coach and four for him,\" was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nHampden might not be convinced of this but he was satisfied of one\r\nthing: the coherence of idea was being regularly maintained. How long\r\nwould it last? It occurred to him to put the question.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to go out either to send the telegram myself or to find\r\nsome one who will take it,\" he explained. \"Until Mr Tubes comes or sends\r\nhis reply will you _remain here_?\"\r\n\r\nIt was rather eerie to be holding conversation with the fragment of a\r\nman's brain with the man himself for all practical purposes eliminated.\r\nBut he seemed to have arrived at a practical understanding with the\r\ncentre of sub-consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"I will remain,\" was the unhesitating reply, and Hampden felt assured\r\nthat the line would not be lost.\r\n\r\nHe had not definitely settled in his mind what to do when he opened the\r\ndoor leading on to the common stairs. A small child who had been\r\nloitering outside in a crouching position staggered back in momentary\r\nalarm at his sudden appearance. It was a ragged girl, perhaps ten or\r\ntwelve years old, with cruelly unwieldy boots upon her stockingless\r\nfeet, matted hair, and a precocious face full of unchildish knowledge.\r\nThe inference that she had been applying either an eye or an ear to the\r\nkeyhole was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nHer fear--it was only the slum child's instinct of flight--died out when\r\nshe saw the gentleman. Toffs (so ran her experience) do not hit you for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"Ee's in there yet, ain't ee?\" she whispered, coming back boldly and\r\nlooking up confidentially to his face. \"I 'eard yer talking, but I\r\ncouldn't tell what yer said. 'Ow long d'yer think 'e'll last?\"\r\n\r\nSir John looked down at the child, the child who had never been young,\r\nin shuddering pity.\r\n\r\n\"It was me what picked 'is 'at up, but they wouldn't let me go in,\" she\r\ncontinued, as though the fact gave her a standing in the case. \"Did yer\r\nsee it in there?\" She looked proudly at her right hand with horrid\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\"Come in here,\" he said, after considering. \"Can you run an errand?\"\r\n\r\nHer face reflected gloating eagerness as she entered, her attitude had\r\njust a tinge of pleasurable awe. He did not permit her to go further\r\nthan the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Is it to do with 'im?\" she asked keenly. \"Yehs!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to go to the post office in Fleet Street,\" he explained. \"You\r\nmust go as fast as ever you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can go anywhere as well as any boy, and as fast if I take my boots\r\noff. When that there Italian knifed her man--him what took up with Shiny\r\nSal--in the Lane a year ago, it was me what fetched the police.\"\r\n\r\nHe left her standing there--her face to the chink of the door before he\r\nhad turned away--and went into the next room to write the message. He\r\ndesired to make it neither too insistent nor too immaterial. \"John Flak,\r\nof 45 Paradise Buildings, Paradise Street, Drury Lane, has met with\r\nfatal accident, and earnestly desires to see you on important business,\"\r\nwas the form it took. He had sufficient stamps in his pocket for the\r\npayment, and to these he added another for a receipt.\r\n\r\n\"You can read?\" he asked, returning to her.\r\n\r\n\"Yehs!\" she replied with her curious accent of lofty scorn at so\r\ningenuous a question. \"I read all the murders and sewercides to Blind\r\nMike every Sunday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go as fast as you can to the post office in Fleet Street, and\r\ngive them this paper where you see 'Telegrams' written up. Then wait for\r\nanother piece of paper which they will give you, and bring it back to\r\nme. Here is sixpence for you now, and you shall have another shilling\r\nwhen you come back.\" He was making it more profitable for her to be\r\nhonest than to be dishonest, which is perhaps the safest way in an\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten o'clock when he looked at his watch on her departure;\r\nit was not ten minutes past when she returned. She was panting but\r\nexultant, and watched his face for commendation as she gave him the\r\nreceipt, as a probationary imp might watch the face of the Prince of\r\nDarkness on bringing in his first human soul. One boot she had dropped\r\nin her wild career, but so far from stopping to look for it, she had\r\nthrown away the other then as useless.\r\n\r\nLeaving the ghoul-child seated on the coal to thrill delightfully at\r\nevery unknown sound, Hampden returned to the bedside. Much of the first,\r\nthe absolutely cold horror of the situation, was gone. He judged it\r\nbetter not to allow too long an interval of silence in which that dim\r\nconsciousness might slip back into the outer space of trackless\r\ndarkness. Now that he knew what to expect it was not very unlike\r\nspeaking to one who slept and held converse in his sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent for Mr Tubes, but, making due allowance, he can scarcely\r\nget here in less than an hour,\" he said. \"If in the meantime there is\r\nanything that you wish to tell me, to make doubly sure, it will be\r\nreceived as a most sacred confidence.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a longer pause than any before, so long that the watcher by\r\nthe bedside was preparing to speak again; then the lips slowly opened,\r\nand the same full, substantial voice made reply.\r\n\r\n\"I will wait. But he must be quick--quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to disclose a fear, but there was no outward sign of\r\nfailing power. Hampden ventured on another point.\r\n\r\n\"Are you in pain?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe reply came more quickly this time, and, perhaps because he was\r\nlooking for some such indication, the listener fancied that he caught\r\nthe faintest stumbling, a little blurring of the outline here and there.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am in no pain. But I have a terrible anxiety that weighs me\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be gained by further questioning. Sir John returned\r\nto the other room. The fire was low and the grate choked with ashes; he\r\nhad begun to replenish it when a curious sound startled him. He only\r\nheard it between the raspings of the poker as he raked the ashes out,\r\nbut it was not to be mistaken. It was the sharp, dry, clock-like\r\nwhirring that had been the first indication of life and speech beyond\r\nthe bedroom door more than an hour before.\r\n\r\nA board creaked behind him, and he turned with an exclamation to see the\r\ndreadful child standing in the middle of the room. Barefooted, she had\r\nslipped noiselessly in from the hall at the first tremor of that unusual\r\nsound, and now, with her dilated eyes fixed fearfully on the door, her\r\nshrinking form bent forward, she slowly crept nearer step by step. Her\r\nface quivered with terror, her whole body shook, but she went on as\r\nsurely as though a magnet drew her.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Hampden sharply. \"Why did you not stay where\r\nI told you?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her face, but not her eyes, towards him. \"Yer heard it,\r\ndidn't yer?\" she whispered. \"Ain't that what they call the death-rattle\r\nwhat comes?\"\r\n\r\nHe took her by the shoulder and swung her impatiently round. \"Go back,\r\nyou imp,\" he commanded. \"Back and stay there, or you shall go out.\"\r\n\r\nShe crept back, looking fearfully over her shoulder all the way.\r\nSomething else was happening to engage Hampden's attention. In the next\r\nroom the man was speaking, speaking spontaneously, as he had done once\r\nbefore, but beyond all doubt the voice was weaker now. The momentary\r\ninterruption of the child's presence had drowned the first part of the\r\nsentence, but Hampden caught a word that strung up every faculty he\r\npossessed--\"League.\"\r\n\r\n\"----League will then suddenly issue a notice to all its members,\r\nputting an embargo--a boycott, if you will--on----\"\r\n\r\nThe voice trailed off, and, although he sprang to the door, Sir John\r\ncould not distinguish another word. But that fragment alone was\r\nsufficiently startling. To the President of the Unity League it could\r\nonly have one meaning; for it was true! Some--how much?--of their plan\r\nlay open. And to how many was it known? The terrible anxiety of this\r\npoor, battered wreck, unconsciously loyal to his class in death, to give\r\nthe warning before he passed away, seemed to indicate that nothing but\r\nthe frayed thread of one existence stood in the League's path yet.\r\n\r\nWas there anything to be done? That was Hampden's first thought. There\r\nwas plainly one thing: to learn, if possible, before Mr Tubes's arrival,\r\nhow much was known.\r\n\r\nNothing was changed; only the death-watch ticked again. He leaned over\r\nthe bed in his eagerness, and, stilling the throbbing excitement of his\r\nblood, tried to speak in a tone of commonplace indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, continue.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no response.\r\n\r\n\"Repeat the sentence,\" he commanded, concentrating his voice in his\r\ndesperation, and endeavouring by mere force of will to impose its\r\nauthority on the indefinite consciousness.\r\n\r\nJust as well might he have commanded the man to get up and walk.\r\n\r\nHad that last elusive thread that held him to mortality been broken?\r\nHampden bent still lower. The pallid face was no more pallid than\r\nbefore, but before it could scarcely have been more death-like. The\r\nacutest test could not have found a trace of breath. He put together the\r\ngradual failing of the voice that little more than an hour ago had been\r\nas full and vigorous as his own, the unfinished sentence, the\r\nsilence----\r\n\r\nSuddenly he straightened himself by the bedside with a sense of guilt\r\nthat struck him like a blow. What was he thinking--hoping? Who was\r\nhe--Sir John Hampden, President of the Unity League? Not in that room!\r\nThe man who watched by the bedside stood there even as the humblest\r\nservant of the Order of St. Martin, pledged while in that service to\r\nsuccour in \"trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to him to debate the point. His way seemed very\r\nstraight and clear. His plain duty to the dying man was to try by every\r\nmeans in his power to carry out his one overwhelming desire. Its\r\nsuccessful accomplishment might aim a more formidable blow at his own\r\nambition than almost anything else that could happen. It could not ward\r\noff the attack upon which the League was now concentrating--nothing\r\ncould do that--but an intimate knowledge of the details of that scheme\r\nof retaliation might act in a hundred adverse ways. Hampden did not stop\r\nto consider what might happen on the one side and on the other. A\r\nthousand years of argument and sophistries could not alter the one great\r\nfact of his present duty. He had a very simple conscience, and he\r\nfollowed it.\r\n\r\nIf he could have speeded Mr Tubes's arrival he would have done so now.\r\nHe went into the hall to listen. The street child was still there,\r\nsitting on the coal, as sharp-eyed and wakefully alert as ever. He had\r\nforgotten her.\r\n\r\n\"Come, little imp,\" he said kindly, \"I ought to have packed you off long\r\nago.\" It was, in point of fact, nearly eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't doin' no aharm to the coal,\" she muttered.\r\n\r\n\"That's not the question. You ought to have been at home and in bed by\r\nthis time of night.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him sharply with a suspicion that such innocence in a\r\ngrown-up man could not be unassumed.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't got no bed,\" she said contemptuously. \"Ain't got no 'ome.\"\r\n\r\nA sentence rang through his mind: \"The birds of the air have nests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you sleep?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"And how do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nThe lowest depths of human poverty had not been abolished by Act of\r\nParliament after all.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door interrupted the reflection. The child had already\r\nheard the step and sought to efface herself in the darkest corner.\r\n\r\nHampden had not noticed the significance of the knock. He opened the\r\ndoor, prepared to admit the Home Secretary. So thoroughly had he\r\ndissociated his own personality from the issue, that he felt the keenest\r\ninterest that the man should arrive before it was too late. He opened\r\nthe door to admit him, and experienced an actual pang of disappointment\r\nwhen he saw who stood outside.\r\n\r\nHe had sent a telegram instead. Whatever the telegram said did not\r\nmatter very much. Hampden instinctively guessed that he was not coming\r\nthen--was not on his way. Anything less than that would be too late.\r\n\r\nHe took the orange envelope and opened it beneath the flaring gas that\r\npiped and whistled at the stairhead.\r\n\r\n\"There is no reply,\" he said quietly, folding the paper slowly and\r\nputting it away in his pocket-book. Were it not that the gain to Hampden\r\nof the League was so immense one might have thought, to see him at that\r\nmoment, that he felt ashamed of something in life.\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament had every department of the postal system freely\r\nat their service. The statement may not be out of place, for this was\r\nwhat the telegram contained:\r\n\r\n     \"Deeply regret to hear of Comrade Flak's accident, and will\r\n     have it fully enquired into. Was it while he was engaged at\r\n     work? Cannot, however, recall any business upon which he could\r\n     wish to see me. Probably a mental hallucination caused by\r\n     shock. Have been terribly busy all day, and am engaged at this\r\n     moment with important State papers which _must_ be finished\r\n     before I go to bed. If it is thought desirable I will, on\r\n     receiving another wire, come first thing in the morning, but\r\n     before deciding to take this course I beg you to consider\r\n     incessant calls made on my time. Let everything possible be\r\n     done for the poor fellow.\r\n\r\n     \"JAMES TUBES.\"\r\n\r\nThe burden of failure pressed on Hampden as he walked slowly to the\r\nbedroom. In that environment of death his own gain did not touch him at\r\nall, so completely had he succeeded in eliminating for the time every\r\nconsideration except an almost fanatical sense of duty to the articles\r\nof the Order. It would be better, he felt, if the shadowy consciousness\r\nthat hovered around the bed could have sunk finally into its eternal\r\nsleep, without suffering the pang of being recalled only to hear _this_,\r\nbut something in the atmosphere of the room, a brooding tension of\r\nexpectancy that seemed to quicken in the silence, warned him that this\r\nwas not to be.\r\n\r\n\"A reply has been received from Mr Tubes in answer to our telegram.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is here?\" There was no delay this time; there was an intense\r\neagerness that for a brief minute overcame the growing weakness.\r\n\r\n\"No. He cannot come. He regrets, but he is engaged on matters of\r\nnational importance.\"\r\n\r\nSilence. Painful silence. In it Hampden seemed to share the cruel\r\nfrustration of so great a hope deferred.\r\n\r\n\"There is this,\" he continued, more for the sake of making any\r\nsuggestion than from a belief in its practicability; \"I might go and\r\ncompel him to come. If he understood the urgency----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is too late.... A little time ago there was a thin white mist; now\r\nit is a solid wall of dense rolling fog. It is nearer--relentless,\r\nunevadable....\"\r\n\r\n\"I can still write down what you have to say. Consider, it is the only\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot judge.... I had a settled conviction that no other ear....\r\nStay, quick; there are the notes! Incomplete, but they will put him on\r\nthe track.... Swear, swear that you will place them in his hand unread.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear to do as you ask me. Go on quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night, now. Do not ... do not let ... do not wait....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes. But the notes? Where are they? How am I to know them?\" The\r\nvoice was growing very thin and faltering, weaker with every word. The\r\ndisappointment had sapped all its failing strength at a single blow.\r\n\r\n\"The notes ... yes. You will explain.... The black wall ... how it\r\ntowers!...\" He was whispering inaudibly.\r\n\r\nHampden leaned over the dying man in a final effort.\r\n\r\n\"Flak!\" he cried, \"the notes on the Unity League! Where are they?\r\nSpeak!\"\r\n\r\n\"The envelope\"--he caught a breath of sound--\"... coat lining.... _I\r\nmust go_!\"\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later Sir John picked up his motor brougham in New Oxford\r\nStreet. He had telephoned immediately on leaving Paradise Buildings for\r\nit to start out at once and wait for him near Mudie's corner. In\r\nParadise Street he had seen a bacchanalian group surrounding \"Mrs Flak,\"\r\nhigh priestess, who chanted a song in praise of home and the domestic\r\nvirtues. It was at this point that he missed the ghoul-child from his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nA south-east wind was carrying the midnight boom of the great clock at\r\nWestminster as far as Kilburn when he turned out of the High Road, and\r\nthe little clocks around had taken up the chorus, like small dogs\r\nenvious of the baying of a hound, as he stopped before the Home\r\nSecretary's house.\r\n\r\nThere was a light still burning in a room on the ground floor, and it\r\nwas Mr Tubes himself who came to the door.\r\n\r\n\"I have to place in your hands an envelope of papers entrusted to me by\r\na man called Flak who died in Paradise Street an hour ago,\" said\r\nHampden, and with the act he brought his night of duty as a faithful\r\nservant of his Order to an end.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's you,\" said Mr Tubes, peering out into the darkness. \"I had a\r\nwire about it. So the poor man is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Hampden a shade drily. \"The poor man is dead.\"\r\n\r\nMr Tubes fancied that he saw the lamps of a cab beyond his garden gate,\r\nand he wondered whether he was being expected to offer to pay the fare.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's very good of you to take the trouble, though, between\r\nourselves, I hardly imagine that the papers are likely to be of any\r\nimportance,\" he remarked. \"Now may I ask who I am indebted to?\"\r\n\r\nHampden had already turned to go. He recognised that in the strife which\r\nhe was about to precipitate, the man who stood there would be his\r\nnatural antagonist, and he regretted that he could not find it in his\r\nnature to like him any better than he did.\r\n\r\n\"What I have done, I have done as a servant of the Order of St Martin,\"\r\nhe replied. \"What I am about to do,\" he added, \"I shall do as Sir John\r\nHampden.\"\r\n\r\nAnd leaving Mr Tubes standing on the doorstep in vast surprise, the\r\nelectric carriage turned its head-lights to the south again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBY TELESCRIBE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sir John Hampden was \"about to do\" he had decided in the course of\r\nthe outward journey.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in his actions, past or prospective, that struck him\r\nas illogical. He would have said, indeed, that they were the only\r\npossible outcome of the circumstance.\r\n\r\nFor the last four hours, as the nameless emissary of the Order to whose\r\ndiscipline he bound himself, he had merged every other feeling in his\r\nduty to the dying man and in the fulfilment of a death-bed charge.\r\n\r\nThat was over; now, as the President of the Unity\r\n\r\nLeague, he was on his way to try by every means in his power to minimise\r\nthe effect of what he had done; to anticipate and counteract the value\r\nof the warning he had so scrupulously conveyed.\r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic predicament. He had sat for perhaps half an hour with\r\nthe unsealed envelope in his pocket, and no eye had been upon him. He\r\nhad declared passionately, year after year, that class and class were\r\nnow at war, that the time for courteous retaliation was long since past,\r\nthat social martial law had been proclaimed. Yet as he drove back to\r\nTrafalgar Chambers he would have given a considerable sum of money--the\r\nLeague being not ill provided, say fifty thousand pounds--to know the\r\nextent of those notes.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the offices it was almost half-past twelve. Salt would\r\nbe flying northward as fast as steam could take him, and for the next\r\ntwo hours at least, cut off from the possibility of any communication.\r\nThe burden of decision lay on Hampden alone.\r\n\r\nHe had already made it. Within an hour he would have pledged the League\r\nto a line of policy from which there was no retreat. Before another day\r\nhad passed the Government could recall the little band of secret service\r\nagents and consign their reports to the wastepaper basket. Every one\r\nwould know everything. Everything? He smiled until the remembrance of\r\nthat cheap frayed envelope in Mr Tubes's possession drove the smile\r\naway.\r\n\r\nNext to his own office stood the instrument room. Here, behind double\r\ndoors that deadened every sound, were ranged the telephones, the tape\r\nmachines, the Fessenden-d'Arco installation, and that most modern\r\ndevelopment of wireless telegraphy which had come just in time to save\r\nthe over-burdened postal system from chronic congestion, the telescribe.\r\n\r\nHampden had not appeared to move hurriedly, but it was just seventeen\r\nseconds after he had sent his brougham roving eastward that he stood\r\nbefore the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"1432 St Paul's, please.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sound as of rushing water and crackling underwood. Then the\r\nwire seemed to clear itself like a swimmer rising from the sea, and a\r\nquiet, far-away voice was whispering in his ear: \"Yes, I'm Lidiat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at Trafalgar Chambers,\" said Hampden, after giving his name. \"I\r\nwant you to drop _anything_ you are on and come here. If my motor is not\r\nwaiting for you at the corner of Chancery Lane, you will meet it along\r\nthe Strand.\"\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the wire, Lidiat--the man who possessed the sixth\r\ncode typewriter--looked rather blankly at his pipe, at the little silver\r\ncarriage clock ticking on the mantelpiece, at the fluted white-ware\r\ncoffee set, and at his crowded desk. Then, concluding that if the\r\nPresident of the Unity League sent a message of that kind after midnight\r\nand immediately rang off again he must have a good reason for it, he\r\nlocked up his room as it stood, took up a few articles promiscuously\r\nfrom the rack in the hall, and walked out under the antique archway into\r\nFleet Street.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Exchange was being urged to make another attempt to\r\nget on with \"2743 Vincent,\" this time with success.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Salt is not 'ere, I repeat, sir,\" an indignant voice was protesting.\r\n\"He is out of town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Dobson, I know,\" replied \"St James's.\" \"I am Sir John\r\nHampden. What train did your master go by?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" apologised \"Vincent.\" \"Didn't recognise your voice at\r\nfirst, Sir John. The wires here is 'issing 'orrible to-night. He went by\r\nthe 10 o'clock from the Great Central, and told me to meet the 10.40\r\nMidland to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did actually go by the 10 train?\"\r\n\r\n\"I 'anded him the despatch case through the carriage window not five\r\nminutes before the whistle went. He was sitting with his----\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Dobson. That's all I wanted to know. Sorry if you had to get\r\nup. Good night,\" and Sir John cut off a volume of amiable verbosity as\r\nhe heard the bell of his Launceston ring in the street below.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow watching your place,\" said Lidiat, jerking his head in the\r\ndirection of a doorway nearly opposite, as Hampden admitted him. Had he\r\nhimself been the object of the watcher's attention it would have been\r\nless remarkable, for had not the time and the place been London after\r\nmidnight, Lidiat's appearance must have been pronounced bizarre.\r\nReasonable enough on all other points he had a fixed conviction that it\r\nwas impossible for him to work after twelve o'clock at night unless he\r\nwore a red silk skull cap, flannels, and yellow Moorish slippers. Into\r\nthis aesthetic costume he had changed half an hour before Hampden rang\r\nhim up, and in it, with the addition of a very short overcoat and a silk\r\nhat that displayed an inch of red beneath the brim, he now stepped from\r\nthe brougham, a large, bovine-looking man, perfectly bald, and still\r\nclinging to his pipe.\r\n\r\nHampden laughed contemptuously as he glanced across the street.\r\n\r\n\"They have put on half a dozen private enquiry men lately,\" he\r\nexplained. \"They are used to divorce, and their sole idea of the case\r\nseems to be summed up in the one stock phrase, 'watching the house.'\r\nPossibly they expect to see us through the windows, making bombs. Why\r\ndon't they watch Paris instead? Egyptian Three Per Cents. have gone up\r\n75 francs in the last fortnight, all from there, and for no obvious\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\nLidiat nodded weightily. \"We stopped too much comment,\" he said. \"Lift\r\noff?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are only two short flights,\" apologised Hampden. \"Yes; I saw that\r\neven the financial papers dismissed it as a 'Pied Piper rise.' Here we\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\nThey had not lingered as they talked, although the journalist ranked\r\nphysical haste and bodily exertion--as typified by flights of\r\nstairs--among the forbidden things of life.\r\n\r\nHampden had brought him to the instrument room. In view of what he was\r\nasking of Lidiat, some explanation was necessary, but he put it into the\r\nnarrowest possible form. It was framed not on persuasiveness but\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\"Salt is away, something has happened, and we have to move a week before\r\nwe had calculated.\"\r\n\r\nLidiat nodded. He accepted the necessity as proved; explanation would\r\nhave taken time. His training and occupation made him chary of\r\nencouraging two words when one would do, between midnight and the hour\r\nwhen the newspapers are \"closed up\" and the rotaries begin to move.\r\n\r\n\"I should like,\" continued Hampden, \"in to-day's issue of every morning\r\npaper a leader, two six-inch items of news, one home one foreign, and a\r\nsingle column six-inch advertisement set in the middle of a full white\r\npage.\"\r\n\r\nLidiat had taken off his hat and overcoat and placed them neatly on a\r\nchair. It occurred to him as a fair omen that Providence had dealt\r\nkindly with him in not giving him any opportunity of changing his\r\nclothes. He now took out his watch and hung it on a projecting stud of\r\nthe telephone box.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the minimum?\" He did not think, as a lesser man with equal\r\nknowledge of Fleet Street might have done, that Hampden had gone mad. He\r\nknew that conventionally such a programme was impossible, but he had\r\nknown of impossible things being done, and in any case he understood by\r\nthe emphasis that this was what Hampden would have done under freer\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\"That is what I leave to you. The paragraphs and comment at some length\r\nI shall look for. The provinces are out of the question, I suppose? The\r\neight leading London dailies _must_ be dealt with.\"\r\n\r\n\"You give me _carte blanche_, of course--financially?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely, absolutely. Guarantee everything to them. Let them arrange\r\nfor special trains at all the termini. Let them take over all the\r\ngarages, motor companies, and cab yards in London as going concerns for\r\ntwelve hours. They will all be in it except _The Tocsin_ and _The\r\nMasses_. We can deal with the distributing houses later. You see the\r\nthree points? It is the patriotic thing to do at any cost; they can have\r\nanything they like to make up time; and it is absolutely essential.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lidiat; \"and the matter?\"\r\n\r\nHampden had already taken a pencilled sheet of paper from his pocket. He\r\nhad written it on his way up to Kilburn. He now handed it to the\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\n\"Between four and five o'clock that will be telescribed over the entire\r\nsystem,\" he explained. \"Those who are not on the call will see it in the\r\npapers or hear from others. Every one will know before to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched Lidiat sharply as he read the statement. Apart from the two\r\nprincipals, he was the first man in England to receive the confidence,\r\nand Sir John had a curiosity, not wholly idle, to see how it would\r\nstrike him. But Lidiat was not, to use an obsolete phrase, \"the man in\r\nthe street.\" He absorbed the essence of the manifesto with a trained,\r\npractical grasp, and then held out his hand for the other paper, while\r\nhis large, glabrous face remained merely vacant in its expression.\r\n\r\nThe next paper was a foreign telegram in cipher, and as Lidiat read the\r\ndecoded version that was pinned to it, the baronet saw, or fancied that\r\nhe saw, the flicker of a keener light come into his eyes and such a\r\ntransient wave across his face, as might, in a man of impulse, indicate\r\nenthusiasm or appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"Are there to be any more of these--presently?\" was all he said.\r\n\r\n\"I think that I might authorise you to say that there will be others to\r\npublish, as the moment seems most propitious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. I will use the instruments now.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one more point,\" said Hampden, writing a few short lines on a\r\nslip of paper, \"that it might be desirable to make public now.\"\r\n\r\nLidiat took the paper. This was what he read:\r\n\r\n     \"_You are at liberty to state definitely that the membership of\r\n     the Unity League now exceeds five million persons._\"\r\n\r\nThere was a plentiful crop of grey hairs sown between Charing Cross and\r\nLudgate Hill in the early hours of that summer morning. With his mouth\r\nto the telephone, Lidiat stirred up the purlieus of Fleet Street and the\r\nStrand until office after office, composing room after composing room,\r\nand foundry after foundry, all along the line, began to drone and hum\r\nresentfully, like an outraged apiary in the dead of night. When he once\r\ntook up the wire he never put it down again until he had swept the\r\n\"London Dailies: Morning\" section of Sell and Mitchell from beginning to\r\nend. Those who wished to retort and temporise after he had done with\r\nthem, had to fall back upon the telescribe--which involved the\r\ndisadvantage to Fleet Street of having to write and coldly transmit the\r\nindignant messages that it would fain pour hot and blistering into its\r\ntormentor's ear. For two hours and a half by the watch beneath his eye\r\nhe harrowed up all the most cherished journalistic traditions of the\r\nland, and from a small, box-like room a mile away, he controlled the\r\nreins of the Fourth Estate of an Empire--a large, fat, perspiring man of\r\npersuasive authority, and conscious of unlimited capital at his back.\r\n\r\nBy the end of that time chaos had given place to order. _The Scythe_ had\r\nshown an amenable disposition with a readiness suggesting that it\r\npossibly knew more than it had told in the past. _The Ensign_ was won\r\nover by persuasion and the condition of the Navy, and _The Mailed Fist_\r\nwas clubbed and bullied and cajoled with big names until it was dazed.\r\nFor seven minutes Lidiat poured patriotism into the ear of _The\r\nBeacon's_ editor, and gold into the coffers of _The Beacon's_ manager,\r\nand then turned aside to win over _The Daily News-Letter_ by telling it\r\nwhat _The Daily Chronicler_ was doing, and the _Chronicler_ by reporting\r\nthe _News-Letter's_ acquiescence. _The Morning Post Card_ remained\r\nobdurate for half an hour, and only capitulated after driving down and\r\nhaving an interview with Hampden. _The Great Daily_--well, for more than\r\na year _The Great Daily_ had been the property and organ of the League,\r\nonly no one had suspected it. The little _Illustrated Hour_, beset by\r\nthe difficulty of half-tone blocks, and frantic at the thought of having\r\nto recast its plates and engage in the mysteries of \"making ready\" again\r\nafter half its edition had been run off, was the last to submit. So long\r\nwas it in making up its mind, that at last Lidiat sarcastically proposed\r\nan inset, and, taking the suggestion in all good faith, the _Illustrated\r\nHour_ startled its sober patrons by bearing on its outside page a gummed\r\nleaflet containing a leaderette and two news paragraphs.\r\n\r\nSo the list spun out. Lidiat did not touch the provinces, but sixteen\r\nLondon dailies, including some sporting and financial organs, marked the\r\nthoroughness of his work. At half-past three he finally hung up the\r\nreceiver; and taking the brougham, rode like another Wellington over the\r\nfield of his still palpitating Waterloo. His appearance, bovine and\r\nimperturbable despite the shameful incongruity of his garb when revealed\r\nin the tremulous and romantic dawn of a day and of an epoch, and further\r\nset off by the unimpeachable correctness of the equipage from which he\r\nalighted, was a thing that rankled in the minds of lingering compositors\r\nand commissionaires until their dying days.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after his departure Hampden returned to the telephone and\r\ndesired to make the curious connection \"1 Telescribe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" he asked, when \"1 Telescribe\" responded.\r\n\r\nThe man at the other end explained that he was a clerk on the main\r\nplatform of \"1 Telescribe\"--name of Firkin, if the fact was of\r\nMetropolitan interest.\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr Woodbarrow there yet?\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared, with increased respect, that Mr Woodbarrow was in his own\r\noffice and could be informed of the gentleman's name.\r\n\r\n\"Please tell him that Sir John Hampden wishes to speak with him.\"\r\n\r\nIn two minutes another voice filtered through the wire, a voice which\r\nHampden recognised.\r\n\r\n\"What are you running with now, Mr Woodbarrow?\" he asked, when brief\r\ncourtesies had been exchanged.\r\n\r\nMr Woodbarrow made an enquiry, and was able to report that a 5 H.P.\r\nTangye was supplying all the power they needed at that hour. Nothing was\r\ncoming through, he explained, except a few press messages from America,\r\na little business from Australia, and some early morning news from\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n\"I should be obliged if you would put on the two Westinghouses as soon\r\nas you can, and then let me know when you can clear the trunk lines for\r\na minute. Within the next hour I want to send an 'open board' message.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no response to this matter-of-fact request for an appreciable\r\nfive seconds, but if ever silence through a telephone receiver conveyed\r\nan impression of blank amazement at the other end, it was achieved at\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\n\"Do I rightly understand, Sir John,\" enquired Mr Woodbarrow at the end\r\nof those five seconds, \"that you wish to repeat a message over the\r\nentire system?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will constitute a record.\"\r\n\r\n\"An interesting occasion, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you calculated the fees, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not had the time. You will let me know when the power is\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\nMr Woodbarrow, only just beginning to realise fully the magnitude of the\r\noccasion and tingling with anticipation, promised to act with all\r\npossible speed, and going to his own room Sir John took up an agate pen\r\nand proceeded to write with special ink on prepared paper this\r\nencyclical despatch.\r\n\r\nA library of books had been written on the subject of the telescribe\r\nwithin two years of its advent, but a general description may be\r\noutlined untechnically in a page or two. It was, for the moment, the\r\nlast word of wireless telegraphy. It was efficient, it was speedy, it\r\nwas cheap, and it transmitted in facsimile. It had passed the stage of\r\nbeing wondered at and had reached that of being used. It was universal.\r\nIt was universal, that is, not in the sense that tongues are universally\r\nin heads, for instance, but, to search for a parallel, as universal as\r\nletter-boxes are now on doors, book-cases in houses, or cuffs around\r\nmen's wrists. There were, in point of number, about three millions on\r\nthe index book.\r\n\r\nIt was speedy because there was no call required, no intervention of a\r\nconnecting office to wait for. That was purely automatic. Above the\r\ntelescribe box in one's hall, study, or sitting-room, was a wooden panel\r\nstudded with eight rows of small brass knobs, sixteen knobs in each row.\r\nThese could be depressed or raised after the manner of an electric light\r\nstud, and a similar effect was produced: a connection was thereby made.\r\n\r\nAll the country--England and Wales--was mapped out into sixteen primary\r\ndivisions, oblong districts of equal size. The top row of brass knobs\r\ncorresponded with these divisions, and by pulling down any knob the\r\noperator was automatically put into communication with that part of the\r\nsystem, through the medium of the huge central station that reared its\r\ntrellised form, like an Eiffel Tower, above the hill at Harrow, and the\r\nsubsidiary stations which stood each in the middle of its division.\r\n\r\nThe second stage was reached by subdividing each primary division into\r\nsixteen oblong districts, and with these the second row of knobs\r\ncorresponded. Six more times the subdividing process was repeated, and\r\neach subdivision had its corresponding row. The final division\r\nrepresented plots of ground so small that no house or cottage could\r\nescape location.\r\n\r\nPulling down the corresponding studs on the eight rows instantly and\r\nautomatically established the connection. The written communication\r\ncould then be transmitted, and in the twinkling of an eye it was traced\r\non a sheet of paper in the receiving box. There was no probability of\r\nthe spaces all being occupied with telescribes for some years to come. A\r\ncalculation will show that there was provision for a good many thousand\r\nmillion boxes, but only three million were fixed and attuned at this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThat, briefly, was the essential of the telescribe system. It was\r\ninvaluable for most purposes, but not for all. Though speedier than the\r\nletter, it lacked its privacy when it reached its destination, and it\r\nalso, in the eyes of many, lacked the sentimental touch, as from hand to\r\nhand, which a letter may convey. It carried no enclosures, of course,\r\nand, owing to the difficulties of ink and paper, printed matter could\r\nnot be telescribed at all. It cost twice as much as a letter, but as\r\nthis was spread in the proportion of three-quarters to the sender and\r\none quarter to the receiver the additional cost was scarcely felt by\r\neither. Thus it came about that although the telescribe had diminished\r\nthe volume of telegrams by ninety per cent., and had made it possible\r\nstill to cope with a volume of ordinary postal correspondences which up\r\nto that time had threatened to swamp the department, it had actually\r\nsuperseded nothing.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock Mr Woodbarrow called up Sir John and reported that the\r\ntwo great engines were running smoothly, and that for three minutes the\r\nentire system would be closed against any message except his. In other\r\nwords, while the \"in\" circuit was open to three million boxes, the \"out\"\r\ncircuit was closed against all except one. It was not an absolutely\r\nnecessary precaution, for overlapping telescripts \"stored latent\" until\r\nthe way was clear, but it was not an occasion on which to hesitate about\r\ntaking every safeguard.\r\n\r\nThe momentous order was already written. Hampden opened the lid of a\r\nsmall flat box supported on the telescribe shelf by four vulcanite feet,\r\nput the paper carefully in, and closed the lid again. He had pulled down\r\nthe eight rows of metal studs in anticipation of Woodbarrow's message,\r\nand there was only one more thing to do. A practical, unemotional man,\r\nand not unused, in an earlier decade, to controlling matters of national\r\nimportance with energy and decision, he now stood with his hand above\r\nthe fatal switch, not in any real doubt about his action, but with a\r\nkind of fascinated time-languor. A minute had already passed. To pull\r\ndown the tiny lever and release it would not occupy a second. At what\r\nperiod of those three minutes should he do it? How long _dare_ he leave\r\nit? He caught himself wondering whether on the last second--and with an\r\nangry exclamation at the folly he pressed the lever home.\r\n\r\nThere was no convulsion of nature; a little bell a foot away gave a\r\nsingle stroke, and that was all the indication that the President of the\r\nUnity League had passed the Rubicon and unmasked his battery.\r\n\r\nThis was what he had written and scattered broadcast over the land:\r\n\r\n     \"THE UNITY LEAGUE.\r\n\r\n     \"The time has now arrived when it is necessary for the League\r\n     to take united action in order to safeguard the interests of\r\n     its members.\r\n\r\n     \"In directing a course which may entail some inconvenience, but\r\n     can hardly, with ordinary foresight, result in real hardship,\r\n     your President reminds you of the oft-repeated warning that\r\n     such a demand would inevitably be made upon your sincerity. The\r\n     opportunity is now at hand for proving that as a class our\r\n     resource and endurance are not less than those of our\r\n     opponents.\r\n\r\n     \"On or before the 22nd July, members of the League will cease\r\n     until further notice to purchase or to use coal in the form of\r\n     (_a_) Burning Coal (except such as may be already on their\r\n     premises), (_b_) Coke (with the exception as before), (_c_)\r\n     Gas, (_d_) Coal-produced electricity.\r\n\r\n     \"The rule applies to all private houses, offices, clubs,\r\n     schools, and similar establishments; to all hotels,\r\n     restaurants, boarding-houses and lodging-houses, with the\r\n     exception (for the time) of necessary kitchen fires, which will\r\n     be made the subject of a special communication, to all\r\n     greenhouses and conservatories not used for the purposes of\r\n     trade; and to all shops, workshops, and similar buildings where\r\n     oil or other fuel or illuminant not produced or derived from\r\n     coal can be safely substituted.\r\n\r\n     \"Members of the League who have no coal in stock, and who do\r\n     not possess facilities for introducing a substitute\r\n     immediately, are at liberty to procure sufficient to last for a\r\n     week.

In the more\r\nrecent past the world had seen employers combine and declare a few\r\nstrikes (the word will serve a triple purpose) for just the same end and\r\naccompanied by precisely similar results. It was now the turn of the\r\nconsumers to learn the strike lesson, the most powerful class of all,\r\nbut the most heterogeneous to weld together. The object was the same but\r\npursued under greater stress; the weapons would be similar but more\r\ndestructive; the track of desolation would be there but wider, and the\r\nend----On that morning of the 15th of July the end lay beyond a very\r\ndim and distant shock of dust and turmoil that the eye of none could\r\npierce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF THE BOMB\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Strummery having finished his breakfast with the exception of a\r\nsecond glass of hot water, which constituted the amiable man's only\r\nbeverage, took up his copy of _The Scythe_. He had already glanced\r\nthrough _The Tocsin_, in which he had a small proprietary interest, but\r\nhe also subscribed to _The Scythe_, partly because it brought to his\r\ndoor a library which he found useful when he had to assume an intimate\r\nknowledge of a subject at a day's notice, partly because the crudely\r\nblatant note of _The Tocsin_ occasionally failed to strike a sympathetic\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nHe had found that morning in his telescribe receiver the Trafalgar\r\nChambers manifesto which had been flashed to friend and foe alike. He\r\nhad read it with a frown; it savoured of impertinence that it should be\r\nsent to him. He finished it with a laugh, half-contemptuous,\r\nhalf-annoyed. He saw that it was a stupid move unless the League had\r\nabandoned all hope of forming the League-Labour alliance; in any case,\r\nit was a blow that stung but could not wound. All the chances were that\r\nnothing would come of it; _but_, if a million people did give up burning\r\ncoal for say a month, if a million people _did_ that--well, it would be\r\nvery inconvenient to themselves, but there would certainly be a good\r\nmany tens of thousand pounds less wages paid out in districts that\r\nseemed to be far from satisfactory even as it was.\r\n\r\n_The Tocsin_ did not refer to the matter at all. Mr Strummery opened\r\n_The Scythe_, and was rather surprised to see, beneath five lines of\r\nheavy heading on the leader page, a full account of Sir John Hampden's\r\nsudden move. Instinctively his eye turned to the leader columns. As he\r\nhad half expected there was a leader on the subject, not very long but\r\nwholly benedictory. In rather less measured phrases than the premier\r\norgan usually adopted and with other signs of haste, readers were urged\r\nto enter whole-heartedly into this development of bloodless civil war of\r\nwhich the impending Personal Property Act had been the first unmasked\r\nblow. He glanced on, not troubling about the views advanced until a\r\ncasual statement drew a smothered exclamation from his lips. \"An\r\nargument which will be used in a practical form by the five million\r\nadult members now on the books of the League--\" ran the\r\ncarelessly-dropped information. \"It is a lie--a deliberately misleading\r\nlie,\" muttered the Premier angrily; but it was the truth. He read on.\r\nThe article concluded: \"In this connection the strong action taken by M.\r\nGavard, as indicated in the telegrams from Paris which we print\r\nelsewhere, may be purely a coincidence, but it is curiously akin to\r\nthose 'mathematical coincidences' that fall into their places in a\r\nwell-planned campaign.\"\r\n\r\nMr Strummery had no difficulty in finding the telegrams alluded to.\r\nRushed through in frantic haste, the type had stood a hair's breadth\r\nhigher than it should, and in the resulting blackness the words of the\r\nheadlines leapt to meet his eye.\r\n\r\n     THE INDUSTRIAL WAR IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n     PROHIBITIVE TAX ON COAL\r\n\r\n     _From Our Special Correspondent_\r\n\r\n     PARIS _Wednesday Night._\r\n\r\n     \"It is authoritatively stated that the industrial crisis which\r\n     has been existing in the north, and to some extent in the\r\n     Lyonnais districts, for the past six months is on the eve of a\r\n     settlement. Yesterday M. Gavard returned from S. Etienne, and\r\n     after seeing several of his colleagues and some leading members\r\n     of the Chamber of Commerce, left at once for Lens. Early this\r\n     morning he was met at the Maison du Peuple by deputations from\r\n     the Syndicate of Miners, the 'Broutchouteux,' the Association\r\n     of Mine Owners, the Valenciennes iron masters, and\r\n     representatives of some other industries.\r\n\r\n     \"The proceedings were conducted in private, but it is\r\n     understood in well-informed circles here that in accordance\r\n     with the plenary powers conferred on him by the Chambers in\r\n     view of the critical situation, M. Gavard proposed to raise the\r\n     small existing tax on imported coal to an _ad valorem_ tax of\r\n     55 p.c. The mine owners on their side will guarantee a minimum\r\n     wage of 8f. 15c., and commence working at once, reinstating all\r\n     men within a week of the imposing of the tax. The amalgamated\r\n     industries acquiesce to a general immediate advance of 1f.\r\n     75_c._ per ton (metric) in the price of coal, and will start\r\n     running as soon as the first portion of their orders can be\r\n     filled.\r\n\r\n     \"Troops are still being massed in the affected districts, but\r\n     after last Thursday's pitched battle a tone of sullen apathy is\r\n     generally preserved. There was, however, severe rioting at\r\n     Anzin this morning, and about 200 casualties are reported.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     PARIS. _Later._\r\n\r\n     \"The terms of settlement contained in my earlier message are\r\n     confirmed. They will remain in operation for a year. The tax\r\n     will come into force almost immediately, three days' grace\r\n     being allowed for vessels actually in French ports to unload.\r\n     In view of your Government's subsidy to English coal\r\n     exportation and its disastrous effects on French mining, and,\r\n     subsequently, on other industries, the imposition of the tax\r\n     will be received with approval in most quarters.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister reached the end of the paragraph he heard a\r\nvehicle stop at his door, followed by an attack on bell and knocker that\r\ncaused Mrs Strummery no little indignation. It was Mr Tubes arriving,\r\nafter indulging in the unusual luxury of a cab, and the next minute he\r\nwas shown into his chief's presence. Both men unconsciously frowned\r\nsomewhat as they met, but the ex-collier was infinitely the more\r\ndisturbed of the two.\r\n\r\n\"You got my 'script?\" he asked, as they shook hands.\r\n\r\n\"No; did you write?\" replied Mr Strummery. \"To tell the truth, this\r\nmeddling piece of imbecility on Hampden's part, and his gross\r\nimpertinence in sending it to me, put everything else out of my head for\r\nthe moment. You have seen it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't need to ask that if you'd passed a newspaper shop,\" said\r\nMr Tubes grimly. \"The newsbills are full of nothing else. 'COAL WAR\r\nPROCLAIMED,' 'HAMPDEN'S REPLY TO THE P.P. TAX,' 'UNITY LEAGUE\r\nMANIFESTO,' and a dozen more. I had private word of it last night, but\r\ntoo late to do anything. That's why I asked half a dozen of\r\nthem--Vossit, Guppling, Chadwing, and one or two more--to meet me here\r\nat half-past nine. Happen a few others will drop in now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't let them see that you think the world is coming to an end,\"\r\nsaid the Premier caustically. \"Nothing may come of it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well, Strummery,\" said Mr Tubes, with rising anger.\r\n\"All very well for you; you don't come from a Durham division. I shall\r\nhave it from both sides. Twenty thousand howling constituents and six\r\nhundred raving members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them rave. They know better than press it too far. As for the\r\nminers, if they have to lose by it we can easily make grants to put them\r\nright.\" A sudden thought struck him; he burst out laughing. \"Well,\r\nTubes,\" he exclaimed boisterously, \"I can excuse myself, but I should\r\nhave thought that a man who came from a Durham constituency would have\r\nseen _that_ before. Hampden must either be mad, or else he knows that\r\nhis precious League won't stand very much. Don't you see? We are in the\r\nmiddle of summer now, and _for the next three months people will be\r\nburning hardly any coal at all_!\"\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary jumped up and began to pace the room in seething\r\nimpatience, before he could trust himself to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk like that before the House with fifty practical men in it,\r\nfor God's sake, Strummery,\" he exclaimed passionately. \"Hampden couldn't\r\nwell have contrived a more diabolical moment. Do you know what the\r\nconditions are? Well, listen. No one _is_ burning any coal, and so it\r\nwill be no hardship for them to do without. But every one is on the\r\npoint of filling his cellar at summer prices to last all through the\r\nwinter. And Hampden's five million----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe that,\" interposed the Premier hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do--now,\" retorted his colleague bitterly. \"His five million\r\nare the five million biggest users of domestic coal in the country. They\r\nuse more than all the rest put together. And they all fill their cellars\r\nin the summer or autumn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then?\" suggested Mr Strummery.\r\n\r\n\"Then they won't now,\" replied Mr Tubes. \"That's all. The next ten weeks\r\nare the busiest in the year, from the deepest working to the suburban\r\ncoal-shoot. Go and take a look round if you want to see. Every waggon,\r\nevery coal-yard, every railway siding, every pit-bank is chock-full,\r\nready. Only the cellars are empty. If the cellars are going to remain\r\nempty, what happens?\" He threw out his left hand passionately, with a\r\nvigorous gesture. It suggested laden coal carts, crowded yards,\r\nover-burdened railways, all flung a stage back on to the already\r\ncongested pit-heads, and banking up coal like the waters of the divided\r\nRed Sea into a scene of indescribable confusion.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister sat thinking moodily, while his visitor paced the\r\nroom and bit his lips with unpleasant vehemence. In the blades of\r\nmorning sun, as he crossed and recrossed the room, one saw that Mr\r\nTubes, neither tall nor stout but large, loosely boned, loosely dressed\r\nand loosely groomed, had light blue eyes, strong yellow teeth which came\r\nprominently into view as he talked, and a spotted sallow complexion,\r\nwhich conveyed the unfortunate, and unjust, impression of being dirty.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to do something to carry them on till the winter, that's\r\nall,\" declared Mr Strummery at length. \"There's no doubt that the\r\nLeaguers will have to use coal then.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no good thinking that we can settle it off-hand with a few\r\nthousand pounds of strike pay, Strummery,\" said the Home Secretary\r\nimpatiently, \"because we can't. You have to know the conditions to see\r\nhow that is. If there's a strike, the article has to be supplied from\r\nsomewhere else at more money, and every one except those who _want_ to\r\nstrike keep on very much as before. But here, by God, they have us all\r\nalong the line! Anything from fifty to a hundred thousand miners less\r\nrequired at one end, and anything from five to ten thousand coal carters\r\nat the other. And between? And dependent on each lot all through?\" His\r\never-ready arm emphasised the situation by a comprehensive sweep.\r\n\"You've heard say that coal is the life-blood of the country, happen?\"\r\nhe added. \"Well, we're the heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suggest, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all a matter of money. If it can be done we must make up the\r\ndifference; buy it, pay for it, and store it. There are the dockyards,\r\nthe barracks, and we could open depots here and in all the big towns. In\r\nthat way we could spread it over as long a period as we liked. Then\r\nthere's export. I think that has touched its limit for the time, but we\r\nmight find it cheaper in the end to stimulate it more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but what about this French business? Are you allowing for that in\r\nyour estimate?\"\r\n\r\n\"What French business?\"\r\n\r\n\"The French tax,\" said the Premier impatiently, pointing to the open\r\n_Scythe_. \"You've seen about it, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\nHe had not. He snatched up the paper, muttering as he read the first few\r\nlines that he had glanced through _The Tocsin_ before he came out, and\r\nthat had been all. His voice became inaudible as he read on. When he had\r\nfinished he was very pale. He flung the paper down and walked to the\r\nwindow, and stood there looking out without a word. The declaration of\r\nthe coal war had filled him with smouldering rage; the Paris telegram\r\nhad effectually chilled it. Before, he had felt anger; now he felt\r\nsomething that, expressed in words, was undistinguishable from fear.\r\n\r\nThe men whom he had asked to meet him there were beginning to arrive.\r\nThey had already heard Vossit and Chadwing pass upstairs talking. There\r\nwas a step in the hall outside that could only belong to Tirrel. He had\r\nnot been summoned, but, as Mr Tubes had anticipated, a few others were\r\nbeginning to drop in. Guppling and two men whom he had met on the\r\ndoorstep came in as Mr Tubes was finishing the Paris news.\r\n\r\n\"It's not much good talking about it now,\" he said, turning from the\r\nwindow, \"but if I had known of _this_, or even that the other would be\r\nout, I should have come here myself without bringing all these chaps\r\ndown too. Not but what they'd have come, though. But when I wrote to\r\nthem I'd just got the information, you understand, and it was thought\r\nthat Hampden wouldn't be doing anything for a week at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was too clever for you again?\" said Strummery vindictively, as he\r\nrose to go upstairs.\r\n\r\n\"So it seems,\" admitted Mr Tubes indifferently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE LAST CHANCE AND THE COUNSEL OF EXPEDIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the salon, where a month before they had drafted the outline of the\r\nPersonal Property Bill, under the impression that government was a\r\nparlour game and Society a heap of spelicans, eight or nine men were\r\nalready assembled. One or two sat apart, with ugly looks upon their\r\nfaces. Mr Vossit was dividing his time between gazing up to the ceiling\r\nand making notes in a memorandum book as the points occurred to him. Sir\r\nCauster Kerr, Baronet of the United Kingdom, and Chevalier of the Order\r\nof the Golden Eagle, who in return for a thousand pounds a year\r\npermitted himself to be called First Lord of the Admiralty in a\r\nSocialist Government, was standing before a steel engraving with the\r\ntitle in German, \"Defeat of the British at Majuba Hill, 27th February\r\n1881,\" but, judging from the slight sardonic grin on his thin features,\r\nhe was thinking of something else. Sir Causter Kerr had assuredly not\r\nbeen invited to the meeting. The rest of the company stood together in\r\none group, where they talked and laughed and looked towards the door\r\nfrom time to time, in expectation of their host's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe talk and laughter dropped to a whisper and a smile as Mr Strummery\r\nentered and Mr Tubes followed, and with short greetings passed to their\r\nplaces at the table. The Prime Minister was popular, or he would not\r\nhave held that position, but Mr Tubes was not. He was Home Secretary by\r\nvirtue of the voice of the coal interest, so much the largest labour\r\norganisation in the country that if its wishes were ignored it could,\r\nlike another body of miners in the past, very effectively demand to\r\n\"know the reason why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jim, owd lad,\" said Cecil Brown hilariously, taking advantage of\r\nthe fact that formal proceedings had not yet commenced, \"hast geete howd\r\no' onny more cipher pappers, schuzheou?\" Cecil Brown, it may be\r\nexplained, held that he had the privilege of saying offensive things to\r\nhis friends without being considered offensive, and as no one ever\r\nthought of calling him anything else but \"Cecil Brown,\" he was probably\r\nright. Of the Colonial Office, he was in some elation at the moment that\r\nhis usually despised Department was quite out of this imbroglio.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that was a very red, red herring, I'm more than thinking now,\" said\r\nMr Guppling reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly a salt fish, eh, Tirrel?\" said Cecil Brown.\r\n\r\nMr Strummery rapped sharply on the table with his knuckles, to indicate\r\nthat the proceedings had better begin. A hard-working, conscientious\r\nman, he entirely missed the lighter side of life. He sometimes laughed,\r\nbut in conversation his face never lit up with the ready, spontaneous\r\nsmile; not because he was sad, but because he failed to see, not only\r\nthe utility of a jest, but its point also. That conversational sauce\r\nwhich among friends who understand one another frequently takes the\r\nouter form of personal abuse, was to him merely flagrant insult.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes leaned across and spoke to his chief; and looking down the\r\ntable the Premier allowed his gaze to rest enquiringly on Sir Causter\r\nKerr.\r\n\r\nA man who _had_ been invited jumped up. \"I called on Comrade Kerr on my\r\nway here and took the liberty of asking him to come, because I thought\r\nthat we might like to know something of the condition of the navy,\" he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\" enquired Mr Strummery smoothly.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he replied, flaring up suddenly with anger, \"because I regard\r\nthis damned French tax, without a word of notice to us or our\r\nrepresentative, as nothing more or less than a _casus belli_.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings had begun.\r\n\r\n\"Case of tinned rabbits!\" contemptuously retorted a Mr Bilch, sitting\r\nopposite. \"What d'yer think you're going to do if it is? Why, my infant,\r\nthe French fleet would knock you and your _belli_ into a packing _casus_\r\nin about ten minutes if you tried it on. You'll have to stomach that\r\n_casus belli_, and as many more as they care to send you.\"\r\n\r\nMr Bilch was a new man, and was spoken of as a great acquisition to his\r\nparty, though confessedly uncertain in his views and frequently\r\nillogical in his ground. His strength lay in the \"happy turns\" with\r\nwhich his speech was redolent, and his splendid invulnerability to\r\nargument, reason, or fact. He had formerly been a rag-sorter, and would\r\ndoubtless have remained inarticulate and unknown had he not one day\r\nsmoothed out a sheet of _The Tocsin_ from the bin before him as he ate\r\nhis dinner. A fully reported speech was therein described as perhaps the\r\ngreatest oratorical masterpiece ever delivered outside Hyde Park. Mr\r\nBilch read the speech, and modestly fancied that he could do as well\r\nhimself. From that moment he never looked back, and although he was\r\nstill a plain member he had forced his way by sheer merit into the\r\ncircle of the Council Chamber.\r\n\r\n\"It is against our principles to consider that contingency,\" interposed\r\nthe Premier; \"and in any case it is premature to talk of war when the\r\ncourts of arbitration----\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right enough,\" interrupted the man who had first spoken of war,\r\n\"and when it was a matter of fighting to grab someone else's land to\r\nfatten up a gang of Stock Exchange Hebrews, I was with you through thick\r\nand thin, but this is different. The very livelihood of our people is\r\naimed at. I've nothing to say against the Hague in theory, but when you\r\nremember that we've never had a single decision given in our favour it's\r\ntoo important to risk to that. But why France should have done this, in\r\nthis way and just at this moment, is beyond me.\"\r\n\r\nYet it was not difficult to imagine. When many English manufactories\r\nwere closed down altogether, or removed abroad because the conditions at\r\nhome were too exacting for them, less coal was required in England. Less\r\ncoal meant fewer colliers employed, and this touched the Government most\r\nkeenly. The same amount of coal _must_ be dug, especially as the\r\noperation of the Eight Hours Act had largely increased the number of\r\nthose dependent on the mines; therefore more must be exported. The coal\r\ntax had long since gone; a substantial bounty was now offered on every\r\nton shipped out of the country. It made a brave show. Never were such\r\npiping times known from Kirkcaldy to Cardiff. English coal could be shot\r\ndown in Rouen, Nantes, or Bordeaux, even in Lille and Limoges, at a\r\nprice that defied home competition. Prices fell; French colliery\r\nproprietors reduced wages; French miners came out on strike--a general\r\nstrike--and for the time being French collieries ceased to have any\r\npractical existence. But France was requiring a million tons of coal a\r\nweek, and having done the mischief, England could only, at the moment,\r\nlet her have a quarter of a million a week, while German and Belgian\r\ncoal had been knocked out of the competition and diverted elsewhere. The\r\ngreat industries had to cease working; chaos, civil war and anarchy\r\nbegan to reign....\r\n\r\n\"Why France should have done this is beyond me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another reason, deeper. It was a commonplace that England had\r\nbeen cordially hated in turn by every nation in and out of Europe, but\r\nwith all that there was no responsible nation in or out of Europe that\r\ndare contemplate a weak, a dying, England. France looked at the map of\r\nEurope, and the thought of the German Eagle flying over Dover Castle and\r\nGerman navies patrolling the seas from Land's End to The Skawe haunted\r\nher dreams. Russia wanted nothing in the world so much as another Thirty\r\nYears' Peace. Spain had more to lose than to gain; Italy had much to\r\nlose and nothing at all to gain. All the little independent states and\r\nnations remembered the Treaties of Vienna and Berlin, and trembled at\r\nthe thought of what might happen now. Germany alone might have had\r\nvisions, but Germany had a nightmare too, and when the man who ruled her\r\ncouncils with a strong if tortuous policy saw wave after wave of the\r\ninfectious triumph of Socialism reach his own shores, he recognised that\r\nEngland's weakness was more hostile to his ambitions than England's\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nNo one wanted two Turkeys in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why we shouldn't make a naval demonstration, at all\r\nevents,\" some one suggested hopefully. \"That used to be enough, and the\r\nFrench Government must have plenty to look after at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naval demonstration be boiled!\" exclaimed Mr Bilch forcibly. \"Send your\r\nlittle Willie to Hamley's for a tin steamer, and let him push it off\r\nRamsgate sands if you want a naval demonstration, comrade. But don't\r\nshow the Union Jack inside the three-mile limit on the other side of the\r\nChannel, or you'll have something so hot drop on your hands that you\r\nwon't be able to lick it off fast enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fail to see that,\" said Mr Vossit. \"Heaven forbid that I should raise\r\nmy voice in favour of bloodshed, but if it were necessary for\r\nself-preservation our navy is at least equal to that of any other\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" retorted Mr Bilch, with so heavily-laden an expression of\r\ncontemptuous derision on his face that it seemed as though he might be\r\nable to take it off, like a mask, and hang it on some one else. \"Is it?\r\nOh, it is, is it? Well, ask that man there. Ask him, is all I say.\r\nSimply ask _him_.\" His contorted face was thrust half-way across the\r\ntable towards Mr Vossit, while his rigid arm with extended forefinger\r\nwas understood to indicate Sir Causter Kerr.\r\n\r\n\"As the subject has been raised, perhaps the First Lord of the Admiralty\r\nwill reassure us on that point,\" said the Premier.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear, no,\" replied Causter Kerr blandly. \"We couldn't carry it\r\nthrough, Premier. You must not think of going to extremes.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moody silence in which men looked angrily at Kerr and at one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to understand that the navy is _not_ equal to that of any other\r\npower?\" demanded Mr Vossit.\r\n\r\n\"On paper, yes, comrade,\" replied Kerr, with a pitying little smile,\r\n\"but on deep water, where battles are usually fought, no. It is a\r\ncurious paradox that in order to be equal to any other single power\r\nEngland must be really very much stronger. I should also explain that\r\nfrom motives of economy no battleships have been launched or laid\r\ndown during the last three years, and only four cruisers of\r\nquestionable armament. Then as regards gunnery. From motives of\r\neconomy actual practice is never carried out now, but the championship,\r\ndating from last year, lies at present with the armoured cruiser\r\n_Radium_:--stationary regulation target, 1-1/2 miles distant, speed 4\r\nknots, quarter charges, 3 hits out of 27 shots. As regards effective\r\nrange----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them this,\" struck in Mr Bilch, \"they'll understand it better.\r\nTell them that the _Intrepidy_ could sail round and round the Channel\r\nFleet and bloody well throw her shells over the moon and down on to\r\ntheir decks without ever once coming into range. Tell them that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The picture so graphically drawn by Comrade Bilch is substantially\r\ncorrect,\" corroborated Sir Causter Kerr. \"The _Intrepide_, together with\r\nthree other battleships of her class, has an effective range of between\r\nfour and five thousand yards more than that of any English ship.... But\r\nyou have been told all this so often, comrades, that I fear it cannot\r\ninterest you.\" Sir Causter was having his revenge for two years of\r\nsubservience at a thousand pounds a year.\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps you will tell us, as First Lord of the Admiralty--the job\r\nyou are paid for doing--what you imagine the navy is kept up for?\"\r\ndemanded a comrade with fierce resentment.\r\n\r\n\"As far as I have been encouraged to believe, in that capacity,\" replied\r\nKerr with easy insolence, \"I imagine that its duties consist nowadays in\r\npatrolling the lobster-pots, and in amusing the visitors on the various\r\nseaside promenades by turning the searchlights on.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't ask you to remain any longer,\" said the Premier.\r\n\r\nSir Causter Kerr rose leisurely. \"Good morning, comrades,\" he remarked\r\npunctiliously, and going home wrote out his resignation, \"from motives\r\nof patriotism,\" and sent a copy of the letter to all the papers.\r\n\r\nA man who had been standing by the door listening to the conversation\r\nnow came forward with a copy of an early special edition of the _Pall\r\nMall Gazette_ in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't sweat yourselves about being equal to a single power or\r\nnot,\" he remarked with an unpleasant laugh. \"Look at the 'fudge' there.\"\r\nAnd he threw the paper on the table, as though he washed his hands of it\r\nand many other things.\r\n\r\nMr Bilch secured it, and turning to the space which is left blank for\r\nthe inclusion of news received up to the very moment of going to press,\r\nhe read aloud the single item it contained.\r\n\r\n     COAL WAR\r\n\r\n     BERLIN, _Thursday Morning_.\r\n\r\n     \"The action which France is reported to have taken had for some\r\n     time been anticipated here. On all sides there is the opinion,\r\n     amounting to conviction, that Germany must at once call into\r\n     operation the power lying dormant in the Penalising Tariff and\r\n     impose a tax on imported coal. It is agreed that otherwise, in\r\n     her frantic endeavours to restore the balance of her export\r\n     trade, England would flood this country with cheap coal and\r\n     precipitate a state of things similar to that from which France\r\n     is just emerging.\r\n\r\n     \"Emphasis is laid on the fact that such a measure will be\r\n     self-protective and in no way aggressive. It is not anticipated\r\n     that the tax will exceed 2 mks. 50 pf., or at the most 3 mks.\r\n     per ton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Export value, eight and elevenpence,\" murmured a late arrival, one of\r\nthe fifty practical men in the House. \"Yes, I imagine that two marks\r\nfifty will just about knock the bottom out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing we can offer them in exchange?\" demanded some one.\r\n\"Nothing we can hit them back with?\"\r\n\r\nCecil Brown, who was suspected of heterodoxy on this one point,\r\ncrystallised the tariff question into three words.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but tears,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"If there's one thing that fairly makes me hot it's the way we always\r\nhave to wait for some one else to tell us what's going on,\" said the\r\ncomrade who had brought in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, looking across at\r\nthe Foreign Office Under-Secretary resentfully. \"A fellow in Holborn\r\nhere pokes the paper under my nose and asks me what we're going to do\r\nabout it, and there I don't even know what is being done at us. What I\r\nwant to know is, what our ambassadors and Foreign Office think they're\r\nthere for. It's always the same, and then there'll be the questions in\r\nParliament, and we know nothing. Makes us look like a set of kiddin'\r\namateurs.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact had been noticed. Former governments had not infrequently\r\nearned the title in one or two departments. Later governments had\r\nqualified for it in every department. The reason lay on the surface; the\r\nmembers of those parliaments and the men who sent them were themselves\r\nbunglers and amateurs in their daily work and life. Except in the\r\nstereotyped product of machinery, accuracy was scarcely known. The man\r\nwho had built a house in England at that period, the man who had had a\r\nrabbit-hutch built to order, the man who had stipulated for one article\r\nto be made _exactly_ like a copy, the man who had been so unfortunate as\r\nto require \"the plumbers in,\" the man who had to do with labour in any\r\nshape or form, the man who had been \"faithfully\" promised delivery or\r\ncompletion by a certain stated time, the woman who shopped, the person\r\nwho merely existed with open eyes, could all testify out of experiences,\r\nsome heartrending, some annoying, some simply amusing, that precision\r\nand reliability scarcely existed among the lower grades of industry and\r\ncommerce. It was a period of transition. The worker had cast off the\r\nlove, the delicacy, the intelligence of the craftsman, and he had not\r\nyet attained to the unvarying skill of the automaton. In another century\r\none man would only be able to fix throttle valve connections on to\r\nhot-water pipes, but his fixing of throttle valves would be a thing to\r\ndream about, while the initial letter A's of his brother, whose whole\r\nlife would be devoted to engraving initial letter A's on brass\r\ndog-collar plates, would be as near unswerving perfection as mundane\r\ninitials ever could be.\r\n\r\n\"Makes us look like a set of tinkerin' amateurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"One inference is plain enough,\" said Mr Guppling, smoothing over the\r\nsuggestion. \"These three things weren't going to happen all together of\r\ntheir own accord. There's a deep game somewhere, and seeing what's at\r\nstake our powers ought to be wide enough for us to put our hands on them\r\nand stop it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of approval. Having been taken by surprise, the idea\r\nof peremptorily \"stopping it\" was a peculiarly attractive one.\r\n\r\nBut there were malcontents who were not to be appeased so easily, and a\r\nComrade Pennefarthing, who had arrived in the meantime, raised an old\r\ncry in a new form.\r\n\r\n\"I won't exactly say that we've been betrayed,\" he declared, glancing at\r\nthe group of orthodox Ministers who sat together, \"but game or no game I\r\nwill say that we've been damned badly served with information.\"\r\n\r\nComrade Tirrel stood up. He had not yet spoken at all, and he was\r\naccorded instant silence, for men were beginning to look to him. \"It is\r\nnow nearly eleven o'clock,\" he said in his quick, incisive tone, \"and\r\nsome of us have been here for upwards of an hour. We met to consider a\r\nsituation. That situation still remains. May I ask that the Home\r\nSecretary, who is doubly qualified for the task, should tell us the\r\nextent of the danger and its probable effect?\"\r\n\r\nIf Mr Tubes possessed a double qualification he also laboured under a\r\ncorresponding disability. As the representative of a mining\r\nconstituency, a practical expert, and a leading member of a Government\r\nwhich existed by the goodwill of the workers--largely of the miners--it\r\nwould be scarcely to his interest to minimise the gathering cloud. As\r\nthe Minister for the Home Department, the blacker he made the picture\r\nthe greater the volume of obloquy he drew upon his head for not having\r\nforeseen the danger; the more relief he asked for, the fiercer the\r\nopposition he would encounter from hostile sections and from the\r\nperturbed heads of a depleted Treasury.\r\n\r\n\"We are still very much in the dark as to what has really happened, is\r\nhappening, and will happen,\" he remarked tamely. \"An appreciable drop in\r\nthe demand for coal, whether for home or export, will certainly have a\r\ndisturbing effect on the conditions of labour in many departments. But\r\nthe difficulties of estimating the effects are so great----\"\r\n\r\nThere were murmurs. Whatever might be the failings of Socialistic\r\noratory, flatness and excess of moderation did not lie among them.\r\n\r\n\"Figures,\" suggested Tirrel pointedly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Comrade Tirrel will take the job in hand instead of me,\" said\r\nTubes bitterly, but without any show of anger. \"Doubtless he'd get a\r\nbetter hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Tirrel gravely, \"the moment is too critical for\r\nrecrimination. If the Home Secretary lays the position frankly before\r\nus, he will have no cause to complain of an unsympathetic hearing, nor,\r\nas far as I can speak, of a whole-hearted support in taking means to\r\nsafeguard it.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Mr Tubes then, for the first time in his life--and it was\r\nalmost like a shock to feel it--that the man who had always seemed to\r\nthrow himself into sharp antagonism to himself might be actuated by\r\nhigher motives than personal jealousy after all. He continued his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\"If we accept the figure of five millions as a correct return of the\r\nUnity League membership, and if we assume that they will all obey the\r\nboycott, then we are face to face with the fact that on the basis of a\r\nfour ton per person average, twenty million tons of coal must be written\r\noff the home consumption.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the four tons per head average includes the entire industrial\r\nconsumption of the country,\" objected Mr Vossit.\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" admitted Mr Tubes, \"but it also includes a great many\r\npeople whose use of coal is practically _nil_. An alternative basis is\r\nto assume that two millions of the members are house-holders. Then\r\ntaking ten tons a year as their average household consumption--and\r\nadmitting that all the wealthiest men in the country are included the\r\naverage is not too high--we arrive at just the same result.\r\n\r\n\"The exports, on the other hand, do not depend on estimate: we have the\r\nactual returns. France takes fifteen million tons in round numbers. For\r\nthe purpose of facing the worst, we may therefore assume that the work\r\nof digging and handling thirty-five million tons will be suddenly cut\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Germany,\" some one reminded him.\r\n\r\n\"Germany is wholly conjectural at present. I have no objection to taking\r\nit into account as well, if it is thought desirable, but I would point\r\nout that we are being influenced by the merest rumour.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" objected Tirrel, but without any enmity, \"I think that we must\r\nregard Germany as lost. We are just beginning to touch the outskirts of\r\na vast organisation which has been quietly perfecting its plan of\r\noperation for years. I do not regard a German tax as settled because of\r\nthis one rumour, but I do regard it as settled because at this precise\r\nmoment the rumour has been allowed to appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Germany ten millions,\" accepted Mr Tubes. \"Total decrease, forty-five\r\nmillion tons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be too sure of that, comrade,\" warned Mr Bilch. \"Why, it's\r\nnot twelve o'clock yet by a long way. There'll be half a dozen editions\r\nout before the 'Three o'clock winners.'\" Mr Bilch evidently regarded his\r\nshaft that each fresh edition might contain a new country imposing a tax\r\nhumorously, but several comrades looked towards the Home Secretary\r\nenquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"The other large importers are Italy, Russia, Sweden, Egypt, Spain and\r\nDenmark,\" said Mr Tubes, who could have talked coal statistics for hours\r\nif necessary. \"All these, with the possible exception of Russia, _must_\r\nimport. It is unlikely that the estimate I have given will be exceeded\r\nfrom that cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the result?\"\r\n\r\n\"Above and below, about a million men are now employed in raising\r\n236,000,000 tons. It is simple arithmetic.... In less than a month about\r\ntwo hundred thousand more men will be out of work.\"\r\n\r\nMr Chadwing, Chancellor of the Exchequer, moved uneasily in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"That is the full extent?\" enquired Cecil Brown.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" admitted the Home Secretary. \"That is the inevitable direct\r\nresult. Forty-five million tons less will be carried by rail, or cart,\r\nor ship, or all three. A fair sprinkling of railway-men, carters,\r\ndockers, stokers, sailors, and other fellows will be dropped off too.\r\nThere will be fewer railway trucks built this next year, less doing in\r\nthe fire-grate trade, several thousand horses not wanted, a slight\r\nfalling off in road-mending work. There is not a trade in England, from\r\nsteeple-building to hop-picking, that will not be a little worse off\r\nbecause of those 45,000,000 tons. Then the two hundred thousand\r\nout-of-work miners will burn less coal at home, the ships and the\r\nengines will burn less, and the workshops and the smithies will burn\r\nless, and the whole process will be repeated again and again, for coal\r\nis like a snowball in its cumulative effects, and it cannot stand\r\nstill.\"\r\n\r\nIf Mr Tubes had come to compromise, he had remained to publish\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one quite understood the danger yet, for the mind, used to\r\neveryday effects, does not readily grasp the extent of a calamity, and\r\nsix hours before there had not been a cloud even the size of a man's\r\nhand on their horizon. The Premier thought it was impolitic on his\r\ncolleague's part; the Treasury officials looked on it as a move to force\r\ntheir hands; the Foreign Under-Secretary was suspicious that Mr Tubes\r\nwas leading away by some mysterious by-path from the unpreparedness of\r\nhis own Department to Foreign Office remissness. They all continued to\r\nlook silently at the Home Secretary as he continued to stand.\r\n\r\n\"The indirect effects will involve about two million people to some\r\nextent,\" he summed up.\r\n\r\n\"That, at least, is the worst?\" said Cecil Brown with an encouraging\r\nsmile, for Mr Tubes remained standing.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister made an impatient movement; the Treasury heads looked\r\nat one another and said with their eyes, \"He is really overdoing it\";\r\nthe Foreign Office man scowled unconsciously, and Cecil Brown continued\r\nto smile consciously.\r\n\r\n\"The worst is this: that a great many pits are working to-day at a bare\r\nprofit, partly in the hope of better things, partly because we stimulate\r\nthe trade. The crisis we are approaching will hang over the coal fields\r\nlike a blight, and one crippled industry will bring down another. _All_\r\nthe poorer mines will close down. You need only look back to '93 to see\r\nthat. Neither I nor any one else can give you a forecast of what that\r\nwill involve, but you may be sure of this: that although '93 with its\r\n17,000,000 tons of a decrease half-ruined the English coal fields for a\r\ndecade, '93 was a shrimp to what this is going to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us stimulate the trade more, until the crisis is over,\"\r\nsuggested Cecil Brown.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes gave a short, dry laugh. \"I commend that course to Comrade\r\nChadwing,\" he said, as he sat down.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer was busy with his papers.\r\n\r\n\"Let me dispel any idea of that kind at once,\" he remarked, without\r\nlooking up. \"The moment is not only an unfortunate one--it is an utterly\r\nimpossible one for making any extra disbursement however desirable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr Bilch, looking round on the moody assembly paternally,\r\n\"it seems that the situation is like this here, mates: The navy is no\r\nmessin' good at all, same as I told you; the army's a bit worse;\r\nTreasury empty, yes; the Home Office don't know what's going on at home,\r\nand the Foreign Office possesses just the same amount of valuable\r\ninformation as to what is happening abroad. Lively, ain't it? Well, it's\r\nlucky that Bilch is still Bilch.\"\r\n\r\nNo one rose to his mordant humour. Even Cecil Brown had forgotten how to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"If our comrade has any suggestion to make----\" said the Premier\r\ndiscouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Mr Bilch. \"I have the wisdom of the serpent to rub\r\ninto your necks if you'll only listen. We haven't any navy, so we can't\r\nfight if we wanted to; we haven't any money, so we can't pay out. Tubes\r\nhere doesn't know what's going to happen at home, and Jevons doesn't\r\nrightly know what has happened abroad. What is to be done? I'll tell\r\nyou. Wait. Wait and see. Wait, and let them all simmer down again. Why,\"\r\nhe cried boisterously, looking round on them in good-humoured, friendly\r\ncontempt, \"to see your happy, smiling faces one would think that the\r\ncanary had died or the lodger gone off without paying his rent. For why?\r\nBecause a bloke in a frock-coat and a top hat gets on to a wooden horse\r\nand blows a tin trumpet, and the export trade in a single article of\r\ncommerce is temporarily disarranged--perhaps!\"\r\n\r\nMr Strummery nodded half absent-mindedly; the Treasury men smiled\r\ntogether; Mr Chadwing murmured \"Very true\"; and nearly every one looked\r\nrelieved. Comrade Bilch was certainly a rough member, but the man had a\r\nshrewd common-sense, and they began to feel that they had been hasty in\r\ntheir dismal forebodings.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't we been threatened with this and that before?\" demanded Mr\r\nBilch dogmatically. \"Of course we have, and what came of it? Nothing.\r\nHaven't there been strikes and lock-outs, some big some little, every\r\nyear? According to Comrade Tubes, this is going to be the champion. That\r\nremains to be seen. What I say is, don't play into their hands in a\r\npanic. Wait and see what's required. That don't commit us to anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be too late then,\" said Mr Tubes, but he said \"may\" now and not\r\n\"will.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be no need to do anything then,\" replied Mr Bilch. \"And\r\nremember this: that the minute you begin to shout 'Crisis!' you make\r\none. All round us; all at us. My rag-bags! what a run on the old bank\r\nthere would be! But if you go on just as usual, taking no notice of no\r\none? Why, before long there will come a wet day or a cold night, and\r\nJohnny Hampden's aunt will say to Johnny Hampden's grandmamma: 'My dear,\r\nI feel positively starved. Don't you think that we might have a _little_\r\nfire without Johnny knowing?' And the old lady will say: 'Well, do you\r\nknow, my pet, I was just going to say the same thing myself. Suppose you\r\nrun out and buy a sack of coal?' And before you can say 'coughdrop'\r\nevery blessed aunt and mother and first cousin of the Unicorn League\r\nwill be getting in her little stock of coal.\"\r\n\r\nIt was what every one wished to believe, and therefore they were easily\r\npersuadable. It was a national characteristic. The country had never\r\nentered into a war during the past fifty years without being assured by\r\nevery authority, from the Commander-in-Chief down to the suburban\r\nbarber, that as soon as the enemy got a little tap on the head they\r\nwould be making for home, howling for peace as they went. All these men\r\nhad known strikes; many had been involved in them: some had controlled\r\ntheir organisation. They had seen the men of their own class loyally and\r\npatiently facing poverty and hardship for the sake of a principle, and\r\nenduring day after day and week after week, and, if necessary, month\r\nafter month; they had seen the women of their own class preaching\r\ncourage and practising heroism by the side of their men while their\r\nbodies were racked by cold and hunger and their hearts were crushed by\r\nthe misery around; they had seen even the children of their class\r\nlearning an unnatural fortitude. They accepted it as a commonplace of\r\nlife, an asset on which they could rely. _But they did not believe that\r\nany other class could do it._ It did not occur to them to consider\r\nwhether the officers of an army are usually behind the rank and file in\r\nvalour, sacrifice, or endurance.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there were among them some who were not deceived, but they\r\nwilfully subordinated their clearer judgment to the policy of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nTirrel was the one exception.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no more fatal mistake of the dangerous position into which\r\nwe have been manoeuvred than to assume that we shall be easily\r\ndelivered from it by the weakness of our opponents before we have the\r\nleast indication that weakness exists,\" he declared, as soon as\r\nMr Bilch had finished, speaking vigorously, but without any of the\r\nassertiveness and personal feeling that had gained him many enemies in\r\nthe past. \"I agree with every word that Comrade Tubes has spoken. We all\r\ndo; we all _must_ admit it or be blind. What on earth, then, have we to\r\nhope for in a policy of drift, of sitting tight and doing nothing in the\r\nhope of things coming round of their own accord? It is madness, my\r\ncomrades, sheer madness, I tell you, and a month hence it will be\r\nsuicide.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped his voice and swept the circle of faces with a significant\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"It is through such madness on the part of others that we are here\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\nMr Chadwing smiled the thin smile of expediency.\r\n\r\n\"It is one thing for a comrade with no official responsibility to say\r\nthat a certain course does not satisfy him,\" he said; \"it may be quite\r\nanother thing for those who have to consider ways and means to do\r\nanything different. Perhaps Comrade Tirrel will kindly enlighten us as\r\nto what in our position he would do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see two broad courses open,\" replied Tirrel, without any hesitation\r\nin accepting the challenge. \"Both, as you will readily say, have their\r\ndisadvantages, but neither is so fatal as inaction. The first is\r\naggressive. The Unity League has declared war on us. Very well, let it\r\nhave war. I would propose to suspend the _habeas corpus_, arrest Hampden\r\nand Salt, declare the object and existence of the Unity League illegal,\r\nclose its offices and confiscate its funds. There are between five and\r\nten million pounds somewhere. Do you reflect what that would do? It\r\nwould at least keep two hundred thousand out-of-work miners from actual\r\nstarvation for a year. Prompt action would inevitably kill the boycott\r\nmovement at home. The foreign taxes, my comrades, you would probably\r\nfind to have a very marked, though perhaps undiscoverable, connection\r\nwith the home movement, and when the latter was seen to be effectually\r\ndealt with, I venture to predict that the former could be compromised.\r\nIf the confiscated funds were not sufficient to meet the distress, I\r\nshould not hesitate to requisition for State purposes in a time of\r\nnational emergency all incomes above a certain figure in a clean sweep.\"\r\n\r\nA medley of cries met this despotic programme throughout. Even Tirrel's\r\nfriends felt that he was throwing away his reputation; and he had more\r\nenemies than friends.\r\n\r\n\"You'd simply make the situation twice as involved,\" exclaimed Mr Vossit\r\nas the mouthpiece of the babel. \"The liberty of the subject! It would\r\nmean civil war. They'd rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who would rise?\" demanded Tirrel.\r\n\r\n\"The privileged classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they _have_ risen,\" he declared vehemently. \"This _is_ civil war.\r\nWhat more do you want?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a question on which they all had views, and for the next five\r\nminutes the room was full of suggestions, not of what they themselves\r\nwanted, but of what would be the probable action of the classes if\r\ndriven to extremities.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" assented Tirrel at last; \"that is what they will do next as\r\nit is, for they consider that they are in extremities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, comrade,\" said Mr Bilch broadly, \"you don't seem to have put your\r\nmoney on a winner this event. What's your other tip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Failing that, the other reasonable course is conciliation. I would\r\nsuggest approaching Hampden and Salt to find out whether they are open\r\nto consider a compromise. The details would naturally require careful\r\nhandling, but if both sides were willing to come to an understanding, a\r\nbasis could be found. As things are, I should consider it a gain to drop\r\nthe Personal Property Tax, the Minimum Wage Bill, to guarantee the\r\ninviolability of capital against further taxation while we are in\r\noffice, and to make generous concessions for the fuller representation\r\nof the monied classes in Parliament, in return for the abandonment of a\r\ncoal war, the dispersal in some agreed way of the League reserves, the\r\nreduction of the subscription to a nominal sum, and a frank undertaking\r\nthat the League would not adopt a hostile policy while the agreement\r\nremained in force.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal was even less to the temper of the meeting than the former\r\none had been, and the latter half of it was scarcely heard among the\r\nfusillade of hostile cries. No one laughed when a hot-headed comrade\r\nstood upon a chair and howled \"Traitor!\"\r\n\r\nTirrel looked round on the assembly. Practically every man who had a\r\ntacit right to join in the deliberative Council had arrived, and the\r\nroom was full; but there was not a single member among them willing to\r\nface the necessity for strong and immediate action, and they were\r\nhostile to the man who just touched the secret depths of their\r\nunconfessed and innermost misgivings. Mr Tubes felt that he had done his\r\nduty, and need not invite reference to his delicate position by further\r\nemphasising unpalatable truths; he had presented the spectacle of a weak\r\nman startled into boldness, now he was sufficiently himself again to go\r\nwith the majority. The more responsible members of the Government\r\ndistrusted Tirrel in every phase; the smaller fry relied on the wisdom\r\nof orthodoxy, and agreed that the man who could blow the hotness of\r\nextirpation and the coldness of conciliation with the same breath must\r\nprove an unworthy guide; and on every hand there was the tendency of\r\nsettled authority to deprecate novel and unmatured proceedings.\r\n\r\nTirrel had become the Hampden of an earlier decade among his party.\r\n\r\n\"You call me 'Traitor,'\" he said, turning to the man who had done so.\r\n\"Write down the word, comrade, and then, if you will bring it to me\r\nwithout a blush six months hence, I will wear it round my neck in\r\npenance.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed to the Premier and withdrew, not in anger or with a mean sense\r\nof injustice, but because he felt that it would be sheer mockery to\r\nshare the deliberations of a Council when their respective views, on a\r\nmatter which he believed to be the very crux of their existence, were\r\nantagonistic in their essences.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure the progress was amazing. His ill-considered\r\nproposals had cleared the air. Every one knew exactly what he did not\r\nwant, and that was a material step towards arriving at the opposite\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few hours a very effective and comprehensive scheme for\r\nquietly and systematically doing nothing had been almost unanimously\r\narrived at. Several quires of paper had been covered with suggestions,\r\nsome of them being accepted as they stood, some recommended for\r\nelaboration, some passed for future consideration, some thrown out. The\r\nambassador in Paris was to retire (on the ground of ill-health) if he\r\ncould not satisfactorily explain the position. A special mission was to\r\nbe sent to Berlin to get really at the bottom of things, and, if\r\npossible, have the tax either not put on or taken off, according to the\r\nsituation when they arrived there. A legal commission was to rout out\r\nevery precedent to see if the Unity League was not doing something\r\noutside the powers of a trade union (a very forlorn hope); and all over\r\nthe country enquiries were to be made and assurances given, all very\r\ndiscreetly and without the least suggestion of panic.\r\n\r\nThe only doubtful point was whether every one else would play the game\r\nwith the same delicate regard for Ministerial susceptibilities, or\r\nwhether some might not have the deplorable taste to create scenes, send\r\ndeputations, demand work with menace, claim the literal fulfilment of\r\nspecific pledges, incite to riot and violence, stampede the whole\r\ncommunity, and otherwise act inconsiderately towards the Government,\r\nwhen they discovered the very awkward circumstances in which their\r\nleaders had involved them.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of a jarring note fell to the lot of the President\r\nof the Board of Trade in the shape of a telegram which reached him early\r\non the following morning. This was its form:\r\n\r\n     \"From the Council of the Amalgamated Union of Chimney Sweepers\r\n     and Federated Carpet Beaters. (Membership, 11,372).--Seventeen\r\n     million estimated chimneys stop smoking. No soot, precious\r\n     little dust. Where the Hell do we come in?\r\n\r\n     \"BLANKINTOSH, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\nA few years before, it had been officially discovered that there were\r\nfour or five curiously adaptable words, without which the working man\r\nwas quite unable to express himself in the shortest sentence. When on\r\nvery ceremonious occasions he was debarred their use, he at once fell\r\ninto a pitiable condition of aphasia. Keenly alive to the class-imposed\r\ndisadvantages under which these men existed, the Government of that day\r\ndeclared that it was a glaring anomaly that the poor fellows should not\r\nbe allowed to use a few words that were so essential to their expression\r\nof every emotion, while the rich, with more time on their hands, could\r\nlearn a thousand synonyms. The law imposing a shilling fine for each\r\noffence (five shillings in the case of \"a gentleman,\" for even then\r\nthere was one law for the rich and another for the poor) was therefore\r\nrepealed, and the working man was free to swear as much as he liked\r\nanywhere, which, to do him justice, he had done all along.\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that Mr Blankintosh's pointed little message was\r\naccepted for transmission; but there was evidently a limit, for, when\r\nthe President of the Board of Trade, an irascible gentleman who had, in\r\nthe colloquial phrase, \"got out of bed on the wrong side\" that morning,\r\ndashed off a short reply, it was brought back to him by a dispirited\r\nmessenger two hours later with the initials of seventeen postmasters and\r\nthe seventeen times repeated phrase, \"Refused. Language inadmissible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FIASCO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government allowed the 22nd day of July to pass without a sign. They\r\nwere, as their supporters convincingly explained to anxious enquirers,\r\ntreating the Unity League and all its works with silent contempt. They\r\nwere \"doing nothing\" strategically, they wished it to be understood; a\r\nvery different thing from \"doing nothing\" through apathy, indecision, or\r\nbewilderment, but very often undistinguishable the one from the other in\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd day of July seventeen million \"estimated chimneys\" ceased to\r\npollute the air. The League was not concerned with the exact number, and\r\nthey accepted the chimney sweepers' figures. It was more to the purpose\r\nthat the order was being loyally and cheerfully obeyed. The idea of\r\nfighting the Government with the Government's own chosen people,\r\nappealed to the lighter side of a not unhumorous nation.\r\n\r\nEver since the institution of a Socialistic press, and from even remoter\r\ntimes than the saplinghood of the \"Reformer's Tree,\" Fleet Street party\r\nhacks and Hyde Park demagogues had been sharpening their wit upon the\r\n\"black-coated\" brigade, the contemptible _bourgeoisie_ of \"Linton\r\nVillas,\" \"Claremonts,\" and \"Holly Lodges,\" taunting them with\r\nself-complacency, political apathy, and social parasitism. The\r\nproportion of moral degradation conferred by a coat intentionally black,\r\nin comparison with one that is merely approaching that condition through\r\nthe personal predilections of its owner, has never yet been defined, and\r\nthe relative aesthetic values of the architectural pretensions of\r\nvilladom, compared with the unswerving realism of the \"Gas Works Views,\"\r\n\"Railway Approach Cottages,\" and \"Cement Terraces,\" of the back streets,\r\nmay be left to the matured judgment of an unprejudiced posterity. The\r\ngreat middle class in all its branches had never hitherto made any reply\r\nat all. Now that it had begun to retort in its own effective way, the\r\nGovernment agreed that the best counterblast would be--to wait until it\r\nall blew over.\r\n\r\nThere were naturally defections from the first. A friendly spy in Mr\r\nTubes's secret service managed to secure the information without much\r\ntrouble that within seven days of the publication of the order no less\r\nthan 4372 notices of resignation had been received at headquarters. He\r\nwas hastening away with this evidence of the early dissolution of the\r\nLeague when his grinning informant called him back to whisper in his ear\r\nthat during the same period there had been 17,430 new members enrolled,\r\nand that while the resignations seemed to have practically ceased the\r\nenrolments were growing in volume. In addition to these there were\r\nbattalions who joined in the policy of the League through sympathy with\r\nits object without formally binding themselves as members.\r\n\r\nIn some of its aspects the success of the movement erred in excess.\r\nThere were men, manufacturers, who in their faith and enthusiasm wished\r\nto close their works at once, and, regardless of their own loss, throw\r\ntheir workmen and their unburnt coal into the balance. It was not\r\nrequired; it was not even desirable then. The League's object was to\r\ndisorganise commerce as little as possible beyond the immediate\r\nboundaries of the coal trade. They were not engaged in an internecine\r\nwar, and every one of their own people deprived of employment was a\r\nloss. Cases of hardship there would be; they are common to both sides in\r\nevery phase of stubborn and prolonged civil strife, but from the \"class\"\r\npoint of view coal had the pre-eminent advantage that its weight and\r\nbulk gave employment to a hundred of the \"masses\" to every one of\r\nthemselves. There were also two circumstances that discounted any sense\r\nof injustice on this head. Firstly, there was a spirit of sacrifice and\r\nheroism in the air, born of the time and the situation; and secondly, it\r\nsoon became plain that the League was engaged in vast commercial\r\nundertakings and was absorbing all the men of its own party who were\r\nrobbed of their occupation by the development of the war.\r\n\r\nA firm starting business with an unencumbered capital of ten million\r\nsterling, enjoying a \"private income\" of five millions a year, and not\r\ntroubled with the necessity of earning any dividend at all, could afford\r\nto be a generous employer.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment it was obvious that oil must take the place of\r\ncoal. That was the essence of the strife. _The Tocsin_ set to work in\r\nfrantic haste to prove that it was impossible; to show that all the\r\nauthorities of the past and present had agreed that no real substitute\r\nfor coal existed. It was quite true, and it was quite false. It was not\r\na world struggle. Abroad, foreign coal was being substituted for English\r\ncoal. At home only half a million tons a week were in issue at the\r\nfirst. Afterwards, as coal stagnation fed coal stagnation, the tonnage\r\nrose steadily, but the calorific ratio of coal and oil, the basis of all\r\ncomparison, simply did not exist, except on paper, for the two fuels in\r\ndomestic use.\r\n\r\n_The Tocsin's_ second article convinced its readers that all the lamp\r\ncompanies in the world could not keep up with the abnormal demand for\r\nlamps, stoves, and oil-cookers, that the ridiculous proposal of the\r\nLeague would involve, if it were not providentially ordained that it was\r\nforedoomed to grotesque failure by the dead weight of its own fatuous\r\nineptitude.\r\n\r\nIn practice the two single firms of Ripplestone of Birmingham, and\r\nSchuyler of Cleveland, U.S.A., at once put on the market a varied stock\r\nthat filled every requirement. There was no waiting. As _The Tocsin_\r\nbitterly remarked, it soon became apparent that the demand had been\r\nforeseen and \"treacherously provided against during the past two years.\"\r\n\r\nThe third _Tocsin_ article on the situation dealt statistically with the\r\noil trade of the world. It necessarily fell rather flat, because _The\r\nTocsin_ Special Commissioner entered upon the task with the joyous\r\nconviction that the world's output would not be sufficient for the\r\ndemand, the world's oil ships not numerous enough to transport it. As he\r\ndipped into the figures, however, he made the humiliating discovery that\r\nthe increased demand would do little more than ruffle the surface of the\r\noil market. The Baku oil fields could supply it without inconvenience;\r\nthe United States could do it by contract at a ten per cent. advance;\r\nthe newly-discovered wells of Nova Scotia alone would be equal to the\r\ndemand if they diverted all their produce across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nHe threw down his pen in despair, and then picked it up again to\r\nsubstitute invective for statistics. Before his eyes the motor-tanks of\r\nthe Anglo-Pennsylvanian Oil Company, of London and Philadelphia, and the\r\nAnglo-Caucasian Oil Company, of London and Baku, were going on their\r\ndaily rounds. It was still a matter for wonder how well equipped the\r\nsudden call had found those two great controlling oil companies. It was\r\nyet to be learned that for their elaborate designations there might be\r\nsubstituted the simple name \"Unity League.\"\r\n\r\nIt was submitting _The Tocsin_ young man to rather a cruel handicap to\r\nsend him to the British Museum Reading Room for a few hours with\r\ninstructions to prove impossible what Salt and Hampden had been\r\nstraining every nerve for two years to make inevitable.\r\n\r\nThree articles exhausted his proof that a successful coal boycott under\r\nmodern conditions was utterly impossible.\r\n\r\nHe went out into the city and the suburbs, interviewing coal merchants\r\nand coal agents with the object of drawing a harrowing picture of the\r\ngloom and depression that had fallen upon these unfortunate creatures at\r\nthe hands of their own class League.\r\n\r\nHe found them all bearing up well under the prospect, but much too busy\r\nto give him more than a few minutes of their time. Every one of them had\r\nbeen appointed an oil agent to the League firms, and League members were\r\nordering their oil through them, just as heretofore they had ordered\r\ncoal. It was very easy, profitable work for them; they had nothing to do\r\nbut to transmit the orders to the League firms and the fast\r\nbusiness-like motor-tanks distributed the oil. But half of the coal\r\ncarters were now under notice to leave, and there were indications that\r\nwork was very scarce. Each motor-tank displaced twenty men and twenty\r\nhorses. Already, it was said, thousands of horses had been sent out to\r\ngrass from London alone.\r\n\r\nExternally, as far as the Capital was concerned at all events, things\r\nwere going on very much the same as before, when the struggle was a\r\nfortnight old. Elsewhere signs were not lacking. The Government had\r\nreceived disquieting reports from its agents here and there, but so far\r\nit was meeting the situation by refusing to acknowledge that it existed.\r\nA march of the Staffordshire miners had been averted by the men's\r\nleaders being privately assured that it would embarrass the Government's\r\nplans. The march had been deferred under protest; so far the\r\norganisation answered to the wheel. But the Midlands were clamorously\r\ndemanding exceptional relief for the exceptional conditions. Monmouth\r\nhad seen a little rioting, and in Glamorgan the bands of incendiaries\r\ncalled \"Beaconmen,\" who set fire to the accumulations of coal stacked at\r\nthe collieries, had already begun their work. Cardiff was feeling the\r\neffect of having a third of its export trade in coal suddenly lopped\r\noff, and Newport, Swansea, Kirkcaldy, Blyth, Hull, Sunderland, Glasgow,\r\nand the Tyne ports were all in the same position. Most of the railways\r\nhad found it necessary to dispense with their entire supernumerary\r\nstaff, and most of the railway workshops had been put on short time. In\r\nLondon alone, between four and five thousand out-of-work gas employes\r\nwere drawing Government pay.\r\n\r\nAbout the third week in August the Premier, Mr Tubes, and the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer had a long private conference. As a result Mr Strummery\r\ncalled an Emergency Council. It was a thin, acrimonious gathering. Some\r\none brought the tidings that seven more companies in South London were\r\nsubstituting Diesel oil engines for steam. He had all the dreary\r\ndevelopments statistically worked out on paper. Nobody wanted to hear\r\nthem, but he poured them out into the unwilling ears, down to the climax\r\nthat it represented two hundred and forty-seven fewer men required at\r\nthe pits.\r\n\r\nIt served as a text, however, for Mr Chadwing to hang his proposal on.\r\nAfter a month of inaction, the Government was at length prepared to go\r\nto the length of admitting that abnormal conditions prevailed. Oil had\r\nthrown a quarter of a million of their people out of employment. Let oil\r\nkeep them. He proposed to retaliate with a 50 per cent. tax on imported\r\noil, to come into operation under Emergency Procedure on the 1st of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThere were men present to whom the suggestion of taxing a raw article,\r\nnecessary to a great proportion of the poor, was frankly odious. They\r\nwere prepared to attack the proposal as a breach of faith. A few words\r\nfrom Mr Strummery, scarcely more than whispered, explained the necessity\r\nfor the tax and the menace of the situation.\r\n\r\nThose who had not been following events closely, paled to learn the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury was living from hand to mouth, for the City had ceased to\r\ntake up its Bills. Unless \"something happened\" before the New Year\r\ndawned, it would have to admit its inability to continue the Unemployed\r\nGrant. Already a quarter of a million men and their dependents, in\r\naddition to the normal average upon which the estimates were based, had\r\nbeen suddenly thrown upon the resources of the Department. If Mr Tubes's\r\nforecast proved correct, double that number would be on their hands\r\nwithin another month. The development of half a million starving men who\r\nhad been taught to look to the Government for everything, looking and\r\nfinding nothing, could be left to each individual imagination.\r\n\r\nThe Oil Tax came into operation on the 1st of September. Under the plea\r\nof becoming more \"business-like,\" a great many of the Parliamentary\r\nsafeguards had been swept away, and such procedure was easy. All grades\r\nof petroleum had already advanced a few pence the gallon under the\r\nincreased demand, and the poorer users had expressed their indignation.\r\nWhen they found, one day, that the price had suddenly leapt to half as\r\nmuch again, their wrath was unbounded. It was in vain for Ministers to\r\nexplain that the measure was directed against their enemies. They knew\r\nthat it fell on _them_, and demanded in varying degrees of politeness to\r\nbe told why some luxury of the pampered, leisured classes had not been\r\nchosen instead. The reason was plain to those who studied Blue Books. So\r\nhighly taxed was every luxury now that the least fraction added to its\r\nburden resulted in an actually decreased revenue from that source.\r\n\r\nBut if the mere tax and increase had impressed the poor unfavourably, a\r\ncircumstance soon came to light that enraged them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the tax the members of the Unity League were still being\r\nsupplied with oil at the old prices, and they were assured that they\r\nwould continue to be supplied without advance, even if the tax were\r\ndoubled!\r\n\r\nThe poor, ever suspicious of the doings of those of their own class when\r\nset high in authority, at once leapt to the conclusion that they were\r\nbeing made the victims of a double game. It was nothing to them that the\r\nAnglo-Pennsylvanian and the Anglo-Caucasian companies were now trading\r\nat a loss; it was common knowledge that their richer League neighbours\r\nhad not had the price of their oil increased, and they knew all too well\r\nthat they themselves had. With the lack of balanced reasoning that had\r\nformerly been one of the Government's best weapons, they at once\r\nconcluded that they alone were paying the tax, and the unparalleled\r\ninjustice of it sowed a crop of bitterness in their hearts.\r\n\r\nIf that was the net result at home, the foreign effect of the policy was\r\nnot a whit more satisfactory. Studland, the Consul-General at Odessa,\r\none of the most capable men in the Service, cabled a despatch full of\r\ntemperate and solemn warning the moment he heard of the step. It was too\r\nlate then, if, indeed, his words would have been regarded. Russia\r\nreplied by promptly trebling her existing tax on imported coal, and at\r\nthe same time gave Germany rebate terms that practically made it a tax\r\non _English_ coal. It was said that Russia had only been waiting for a\r\nfavourable opportunity, and was more anxious to develop her own new coal\r\nfields in the Donetz basin than to import at all. As far as the Treasury\r\nwas concerned, the oil tax yielded little more than was absorbed by the\r\nthirty thousand extra men thrown out of work by Russia's action. The\r\nGovernment had given a rook for a bishop.\r\n\r\nA little time ago the Cabinet had been prepared to greet winter as a\r\nfriend. Without quite possessing the ingenuousness of their amiable\r\nComrade Bilch, they had thought cynically of the pampered aristocrats\r\nshivering in Mayfair drawing-rooms, of the comfort-loving middle classes\r\nsitting before their desolate suburban hearths, of blue-faced men\r\nsetting out breakfastless for freezing offices, and of pallid women\r\nweeping as they tried to warm the hands of little children, as they put\r\nthem in their icy beds.\r\n\r\nAnd now? All their cynical sympathy had apparently been in vain. There\r\nwere not going to be any cold breakfasts, freezing offices, or shivering\r\nwomen and children. Warming stoves and radiators raised the temperature\r\nof a room much quicker than a fire did, and kept it equable without any\r\nattention. Oil cookers took the place of the too often erratic kitchen\r\nrange. Mrs Strummery innocently threw the Premier into a frenzy one\r\nmorning by dilating on the advantages of a \"Britonette\" stove which she\r\nhad been shown by a Tottenham Court Road ironmonger. The despised,\r\nhelpless \"classes\" were going on very comfortably. They were going on\r\neven gaily; \"Oil Scrambles\" constituted a new and popular form of\r\nentertainment for long evenings; from Wimbledon came the information\r\nthat \"Candle Cinderellas\" would have a tremendous rage during the\r\napproaching season; and in Cheapside and the Strand the penny hawkers\r\nwere minting money with the novel and diverting \"Coal Sack Puzzle.\"\r\n\r\nBut the winter was approaching, though no longer as a friend. If England\r\nshould say to-morrow what Lancashire was saying that day, there were\r\nportents of stirring times in the air. Already Northumberland, Durham,\r\nand Yorkshire were muttering in their various uncouth dialects, and\r\nLanark was subscribing to disquieting sentiments in its own barbarous\r\ntongue. Derbyshire was becoming uneasy, Staffordshire was scarcely\r\nanswering to the wheel, and Nottingham was in revolt against what it\r\nconsidered to be the too compliant attitude of the Representation\r\nCommittee. The rioting in Monmouth was only restrained from becoming\r\nserious in its proportions by the repeated assurances from Westminster\r\nthat the end was in sight; and the \"Beaconmen\" of Glamorgan were openly\r\nboasting that before long they would \"light such a candle\" that the\r\nashes would fall upon London like a Vesuvian cloud.\r\n\r\nStill nearer home was the disturbing spectacle of the railway-men thrown\r\nout of work, the coal carters, the stablemen, the gasworkers, the canal\r\nboatmen, the general labourers, the tool-makers, the wheel-wrights, the\r\nchimney sweepers, the brushmakers. The sequence of dependence could be\r\ntraced, detail by detail, through every page of the trade directory.\r\n\r\nThey had all been taught to clamour to the Government in every\r\nemergency, and this administration they regarded as peculiarly their\r\nown. It was not a case of Frankenstein's Monster getting out of hand;\r\nthis Monster had created its Frankenstein, and could dissolve him if he\r\nproved obstinate. All that Frankenstein had ventured to do so far had\r\nbeen to reduce the Unemployed Grant to three quarters of its normal rate\r\n\"in view of the unprecedented conditions of labour,\" and where two or\r\nmore unemployed were members of one family, to make a further small\r\ndeduction. The action had not been well received. \"In view of the\r\nunprecedented conditions of labour\" the unemployed had looked for more\r\nrather than for less. When the rate was fixed they had been given to\r\nunderstand that it represented the minimum on which an out-of-work man\r\ncould be decently asked to live. Why, then, had their own party reduced\r\nit? Funds? Tax some luxury!\r\n\r\nEven the Government assurance, an ingenious adaptation of truth by the\r\nlight of Mr Chadwing's figures, that they \"did not anticipate having to\r\nimpose the reduced grant for many more weeks, but at the same time\r\ncounselled economy in every working-class home,\" did not restore mutual\r\ngood feeling. The general rejoinder was that the Government had \"better\r\nnot,\" and the reference to economy was stigmatised as gratuitously\r\ninept.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the situation was reacting unfavourably upon Mr\r\nStrummery and the chief officers of State, not only in Parliament but\r\neven in the Cabinet itself. Consultations between the Premier and half a\r\ndozen of his most trusted Ministers were of daily occurrence. One day,\r\ntowards the end of September, Mr Strummery privately intimated to all\r\nthe \"safe\" members of the Council that it was necessary to meet to\r\nconsider what further steps to take.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was a \"packed\" one in that the Tirrels, the Browns, and the\r\nBilches of the party were not invited and knew nothing of it. There was\r\nno reason why Mr Strummery should not call together a section of his\r\nfollowers if he wished, and discuss policy with them, but at the moment\r\nit was dangerous, because the conclave was just strong enough to be able\r\nto impose its will upon Parliament, and yet individually it was composed\r\nof weak men. It was dangerous because half a dozen weak men, rendered\r\ndesperate by the situation into which they were being inevitably driven,\r\nhad resolved to act upon heroic lines. As Balzac had remarked, \"There is\r\nnothing more horrible than the rebellion of a sheep,\" but the horrible\r\nconsequences generally fall upon its own head in the end.\r\n\r\nMr Chadwing's statement informed the despondent gathering that on the\r\nexisting lines it would be necessary to suspend the wholesale operation\r\nof the relief fund about the middle of December. By reducing the grant\r\nin varying degrees it would be possible to carry on for perhaps three\r\nmonths beyond that date, but to reach the furthest limit the individual\r\nrelief would have become so insignificant that it would only result in\r\nan actual crisis being precipitated earlier than would be the case if\r\nthey went on as they were doing.\r\n\r\nThat was all that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to say. The\r\nuninitiated men looked at one another in mute enquiry. There was\r\nsomething in the air. What was coming?\r\n\r\nThe Premier rose to explain. He admitted that they had underrated the\r\ndanger of the situation at first. Measures that might have sufficed then\r\nwere useless now. Oil was the pivot of the whole question. The oil tax\r\nhad not realised expectations. To raise the tax would only alienate the\r\naffections of their own people without reaching the heart of the matter.\r\nThey had already taken one bite at a cherry.\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked round, an indifferent swimmer forced by giant\r\ncircumstance to face his Niagara.\r\n\r\nHe proposed as a measure of national emergency to prohibit the\r\nimportation of oil altogether.\r\n\r\nThere was a gasp of surprise; a moment of stupefaction. Strange things\r\nwere again being done in the name of Liberty.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes's voice, enumerating the results and advantages of the step,\r\nrecalled their wandering thoughts. There was little need for the\r\nrecital; the effect of so unexpected a _coup_ leapt to the mind at once.\r\n\r\nThe Leaguers must either burn coal or starve. The home oil deposits had\r\nlong ceased to be worked. Wood under modern conditions was\r\nimpracticable; peat was equally debarred, and neither could meet a\r\nsudden emergency in sufficient quantity; electricity meant coal, and was\r\nfar from universal. The League movement must collapse within a week.\r\n\r\nThere were other points, all in favour of the course. Although it might\r\nslightly inconvenience many working-class homes it would not take their\r\nmoney as a heavier tax would, and it must convince all that the end was\r\nwell in sight. It would induce the poor to use more coal, more gas, in\r\nitself a step towards that desired end. It would teach Russia a sharp\r\nlesson, and Russia's sins were the freshest in their minds.\r\n\r\nAll were convinced, and all against their will. There was something\r\nsinister in the proposal; the thought of it fell like a shadow across\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a course I would recommend or even assent to as a general\r\nthing,\" said Mr Strummery. \"But we are fighting for the existence of our\r\nparty, for the lives of thousands of our people. It is no exaggeration.\r\nThink of the awful misery that must sweep the country in the coming\r\nwinter if the League holds out. If we do not break the wicked power of\r\nthose two men, there is no picture of national calamity to be found in\r\nthe past that can realise the worst.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is their game,\" said Mr Tubes bitterly. \"The cowards are striking at\r\nthe women and children through the men.\"\r\n\r\nHe ignored the fact that his party had struck the first blow, and had\r\nhad the word \"War!\" figuratively nailed to the staff of their red banner\r\nfor years. In war one usually strikes some one, and on the whole it is\r\nperhaps less reprehensible to strike women and children through men than\r\n_vice versa_. But it was an acceptable sentiment on the face of it, and\r\nit sounded all right at the moment.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" added the Premier, \"there will be this danger in the\r\nsituation: that blinded by passions and desperate through misery, the\r\npeople may fail to realise who are the real causes of their plight.\"\r\n\r\nYes, there was that possibility to be faced by thoughtful Socialistic\r\nMinisters. The people are not very subtle in their reasoning. The most\r\npressing fact of their existence would be that the Government, which had\r\npromised to keep them from starvation in return for their votes, had had\r\ntheir votes and was allowing them to starve.\r\n\r\n\"I think that we must all agree to the necessity of the step,\" said one\r\nof the minor men, \"though our feelings are all against it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" admitted Mr Strummery. \"Let us hope that being a sharp\r\nremedy it will only need to be a short one.\"\r\n\r\nSurprise was the essence of the _coup_, and the \"business-like\"\r\nprocedure of Parliament permitted this when the Government was backed by\r\na large automatic majority. The expeditious passing of the measure was a\r\nforegone conclusion, yet a few shrewd warning voices were raised against\r\nit even among the stalwarts. The regular opposition voted against it as\r\na matter of course. The most moderate section of the Labour Party and\r\nthe extreme Socialists, who both elected to sit on the opposition side\r\nof the House, refrained from voting, and a few Ministers, who were\r\ndistracted between their private opinions and their party duty, were\r\ndiplomatically engaged elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Bill first received the attention of the House on the 25th of\r\nSeptember, the day after the Premier had called his informal meeting. It\r\nbecame law on the 28th, and three days later, the 1st of October, Great\r\nBritain was absolutely \"closed\" against the introduction of mineral\r\nburning oils on any terms.\r\n\r\nThe country received the measure with mixed feelings, but on the whole\r\nwith the admission that it would be effective and with an expression of\r\ndislike. The coal mining districts hailed it with enthusiasm, and the\r\nsame reception was accorded it among the affected industries, but\r\noutside these it was nowhere popular, and in certain working-class\r\nquarters it evoked the bitterest hostility. It was felt even by those\r\nwho stood to gain much by the overthrow of the League that their\r\ninstincts rebelled against the means; possibly the underlying feeling\r\nwas distrust of the exercise of power so despotic. It was admitted that\r\nthe League's action with respect to coal stood on a different plane. Any\r\nmember could at once resign; it was questionable if one could not use\r\ncoal and still remain a member. Certainly no coercion was used. But in\r\nthe matter of oil a necessary commodity was absolutely ruled out, and,\r\nwhether he wished or nor, every one must obey. By the 8th of October the\r\nretail price of petroleum of an average quality was 2s. 9d. the gallon,\r\nand the price was rising as the end of the stock came in sight.\r\n\r\nOne curious circumstance excited remark. The Unity League members were\r\nstill being supplied at the original price. The League was keeping its\r\nword gallantly to the end. The Government had calculated that the two\r\ninterested companies might have a reserve that would last a week. The\r\naverage stock which the consumer might be supposed to have in hand would\r\ncarry them on for a further five days, and the economy which they would\r\ndoubtless practise might hold off the climax for five more. The 17th of\r\nOctober came to be confidently mentioned in Government circles as the\r\ndate of the Unity League's surrender.\r\n\r\nIt might have been merely coincidence, but on the 17th of October Mr\r\nStrummery chose to entertain a few of his colleagues to dinner in the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the host's inevitable jug of boiling water, an air of genial\r\nhumour, almost of gaiety, pervaded the board. Mr Tubes was\r\nentertainingly reminiscent; Chadwing succeeded in throwing off the\r\nweight of the Treasury; Comrade Stubb, fresh from the soil, proved to\r\nhave a dry humour of his own; and Cecil Brown, who was always socially\r\nwelcome, made a joke which almost surprised the Premier into a smile.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes was in the middle of a sentence when Cecil Brown, with his face\r\nturned towards the door, laid his hand upon the speaker's arm.\r\n\r\n\"A minute, Tubes,\" he said. \"There is something unusual going on out\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is----\" began Chadwing, and stopped. The same thought had\r\noccurred to at least three of them. Perhaps they were coming to tell\r\nthem that Hampden had accepted his defeat. Whatever it might be, a dozen\r\nmembers who had entered the room in a confused medley were making their\r\nway towards the Premier's table. A man who seemed to concentrate their\r\nattention was in their midst; some were apparently trying to hold him\r\nback, while others urged him on. While yet some distance off he broke\r\naway from them all, and running forward, reached the table first.\r\n\r\nIt was Comrade Bilch, so dishevelled, red, and heated, that it did not\r\noccur to any one to doubt that he was drunk. For a second he stood\r\nlooking at them stupidly, and then he suddenly opened his mouth and\r\npoured out so appalling a string of vile and nauseating abuse that men\r\nwho were near drew aside.\r\n\r\n\"Why, in Heaven's name, don't you take him away?\" exclaimed Cecil Brown,\r\nappealing to those who formed the group beyond the table.\r\n\r\nThey would have done so, but Comrade Bilch raised his hand as though to\r\nenjoin attention for a moment. A change seemed to have come over him\r\neven in that brief passage of time. He walked up to the table and leaned\r\nheavily upon it with both fists, while his breath came in throbs, and\r\nthe colour played about his face like the reflection of a raging fire.\r\nWhen he spoke it was without a single oath; all his uncleanness had\r\ndropped away from him as though he recognised its threadbare poverty in\r\nthe face of the colossal news he brought.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, leaning forward and breathing very hard, \"you\r\nwould have it, and you have got your way. You've made oil contraband,\r\nand not a drop can be landed in Great Britain now. It can't be brought,\r\nbut it can be used when it is here, and the Unity League that you have\r\ndone it all to starve has got two hundred million gallons safely stowed\r\naway at Hanwood! Yes, while our people will have to grope and freeze\r\nthrough the winter, _they_ are quite comfortably provided for, and you,\r\nwhether you leave the bar on or whether you take it off, you have made\r\nus the laughing-stock of Europe!\"\r\n\r\nAn awed silence fell on the group. Not the most shadowy suspicion of\r\nsuch a miscarriage had ever stirred the most cautious. All their qualms\r\nhad been in the direction of swallowing the unpalatable measure, not of\r\ndoubting its efficacy. They seemed to be the puny antagonists of some\r\nalmost superhuman power that not only brushed their most elaborate plans\r\naside, but actually led them on to pave the way to their own undoing.\r\n\r\nMr Tubes was the first to speak. \"It can't be true,\" he whispered. \"It\r\nis impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, everything's impossible with you, especially when it's happened,\"\r\nretorted Mr Bilch contemptuously. \"Pity you didn't live when there were\r\nreal miracles about.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the time?\" protested some one. \"How could they do it in the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Time!\" said Mr Bilch, \"what more do you want? They've had two years,\r\nand they've used two years. If those----\" He stopped suddenly, jerked\r\nhis head twice with a curious motion, and fell to the ground in a fit.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of good friends to look after him without troubling\r\nthe Ministerial group. The dinner-party broke up in the face of so\r\ninauspicious a series of events, and before another hour had passed the\r\nstory of the gigantic fiasco had reached every club in London, and was\r\nbeing cabled to every capital in Christendom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DARK WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1918 had proved unusually mild. It was said that many of\r\nthe migratory birds delayed their exodus for weeks beyond their normal\r\ntimes, and in sheltered gardens and hedgerows in the south of England\r\nflowers and fruit were making an untimely show; but about midday on the\r\n24th of November it began to grow dark, and, without any indication of\r\nfog, it grew darker, until the greater part of England and Wales was\r\nplunged into a nocturnal gloom. As there was a marked fall in the\r\ntemperature, men looked up to the clouds and predicted snow, but they\r\nwere wrong. Had it snowed it might have been the White Winter of 1918,\r\nfor that night the frost began, and the 24th of November had already\r\nbecome an ill-omened date to usher in a frost. It did not belie its\r\ncharacter. The next day broke clear but bitter, and those who read\r\nnewspapers learned with curious interest that during the night the\r\nseven-tailed comet of 1744 had been observed by several astronomers, to\r\nthe great confusion of their science, for its appearance was premature\r\nby a round hundred thousand years. The phenomenon afterwards grew into a\r\nportent to the vulgar mind, for that was the beginning of the great\r\nfrost that lasted seven weeks without an intermission.\r\n\r\nOutside certain limits, life was proceeding very much as before. The\r\ncondition of the upper classes was not materially different from what it\r\nhad been before the policy of retaliation had been declared. The\r\nPersonal Property Tax had not been proceeded with, and the Minimum Wage\r\nBill had been dropped for the time. There were diplomatic explanations;\r\nthe real reason was that the Cabinet was too sharply divided over the\r\nexpediency of anything in those days to make the passing of important\r\nmeasures practicable. While none had the courage to go to an extreme\r\neither in aggression or in conciliation, there was a multitude of\r\ncounsel vehemently wrangling over the wisdom of little concessions and\r\nlittle aggressions.\r\n\r\nIn London the great increase in the number of unemployed began to be\r\nobservable in the early autumn. The obsolete \"marches of unemployed\"\r\nwere revived, but, as might have been foreseen, except among the poor\r\nthemselves, they met with no financial encouragement. Even the poor were\r\nbecoming careful of their pence. They saw what the winter must mean, for\r\nevery one knew of a score of deserving cases around his own door, and it\r\nwas commonly reported that the Government contemplated reducing the\r\nUnemployed Grant to two-thirds its normal basis before the year was out.\r\nThat was the Cabinet's idea for \"breaking it gently.\" So, meeting with\r\nno response in the suburbs, the City, or the West End, the processions\r\ngroaned occasionally, broke a few windows, enhanced the bitter feeling\r\nexisting against their class by frightening more than a few ladies, and\r\nwere finally kept in check by the special constabulary raised in the\r\nsuburbs, the City, and the West End. Finding so little profit for their\r\nexertions, they abandoned their indiscriminate peregrinations, and took\r\nto demonstrating before St Stephen's and to hooting outside the houses\r\nof Cabinet Ministers until the processions and meetings were disallowed.\r\n\r\nThere was no public charity that winter, either organised or\r\nspontaneous, for the benefit of the working-class poor. The conditions\r\nof labour would have warranted a Mansion House Fund being opened in\r\nSeptember, but no one suggested it, and no one would have contributed to\r\nit. Abroad it was generally recognised that England was involved in\r\ncivil war to which it behoved them to act as neutrals. The Socialists in\r\nBelgium collected and despatched the sum of L327, 14s. 6d. for the\r\nrelief of their \"persecuted confraternity in England,\" but as the pomp\r\nand circumstances attending the inauguration of the Fund had led their\r\npersecuted confraternity in England to expect at least a quarter of a\r\nmillion sterling, some intemperate remarks greeted the consummation of\r\nthe effort, and it was not repeated.\r\n\r\nTo those who did not look very deeply into the situation it appeared\r\nthat a long, hard winter must operate against the interests of the\r\nLeague. Their opponents would burn more coal. The Government, indeed,\r\nissued an appeal asking them to do so, and thus to relieve the tension\r\nin the provinces. The response was not promising. The Government was, in\r\neffect, told to mind its own business, and particularly that detail of\r\nits business which consisted in the guarantee of a full and undocked\r\nliving wage to every worker in or out of work. The contention so far had\r\nbeen that with the surfeit, coal would be so cheap that even the poorest\r\ncould burn it unstintingly. But soon a new and rather terrible\r\ndevelopment grew out of the complex situation. Coal became dear, not\r\nonly dear in the ordinary sense of the word--winter prices--but very,\r\nvery dear. The simple truth was that a disorganised industry always\r\nmoves on abnormal lines, and coal was a routed, a shattered, industry.\r\n\r\nThere was no oil to be had by any but members of the League; in some\r\nplaces there was no gas to be had, for many of the small gas companies,\r\nand some of the large ones, had found it impossible to continue amidst\r\nthe dislocation of their trade, and the cheapest coal was being retailed\r\nin the streets of London at two shillings the hundred-weight. The\r\nGovernment had left oil contraband after the discovery of the League's\r\nsecret store down the quiet country lane, for they recognised that to\r\nremove the embargo immediately would kill them with ridicule. They\r\npromised themselves that the freedom of commerce should be restored at\r\nthe first convenient opportunity. In the meanwhile they decided to do as\r\nthey had done in other matters: they bravely ignored the fact that the\r\nLeague members were any better off than any one else, and declined to\r\nbelieve the evidence that any store existed.\r\n\r\nThat was the state of affairs before the winter set in, and in London\r\nalone. The Capital was feeling some of the remoter effects of the blow,\r\nbut from the provinces, from the actual battle-fields, there came grim\r\nstories. Northumberland, which had been loth to accept the Eight Hours\r\nBill, now traced the whole of the trouble to that head, and declared\r\nthat the only hope was for the Government to make a complete surrender\r\nto the Unity League, on the one condition that it restored a normal\r\ndemand for coal both at home and abroad. Durham, on the contrary, held\r\nthat it was necessary for the Government to crush or wear out the\r\nLeague. In both counties there had been fierce conflict between the\r\nrival factions, and blood had been freely shed. After a single day's\r\nrioting at Newcastle and Gateshead seventeen dead bodies had been\r\ncollected by the ambulances.\r\n\r\nThe \"Beaconmen\" in Glamorgan were setting fire to the pits themselves in\r\na spirit of fanaticism. In one instance a fire had spread beyond the\r\nintended limits, and an explosion, in which three score of their\r\nunfortunate fellow-workmen perished, had been the net result. The\r\nMidlands were the least disturbed, and even there Walsall had seen a\r\nmass meeting at which thirty thousand colliers and other affected\r\nworkmen had called insistently with threats upon the Government, in\r\npathetic ignorance of the Treasury's plight, to purchase the nation's\r\ncoal pits at once, and resume full time at all of them, as the only\r\nmeans of averting a national calamity.\r\n\r\nAnd all this had been taking place in the mild autumn, while the\r\nGovernment was still paying out sufficient relief funds to ensure that\r\nactual starvation should not touch any one, long before it had been\r\ndriven to take the country into its confidence. The spectre of cold and\r\nhunger had not yet been raised to goad the men to madness; so far they\r\nregarded existence at least as assured, and the question that was\r\nstirring them to rebellion was not the fundamental one of the \"right to\r\nlive,\" but the almost academic issue of the right to live apart from the\r\nnatural vicissitudes of life.\r\n\r\nThe Government had other troubles on hand. The two principal causes for\r\nanxiety among these, if not actually of their own hatching, had\r\ncertainly sprung from a common stock.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament sitting at College Green deemed the moment opportune for\r\nissuing a Declaration of Independence and proclaiming a republic. Three\r\nyears before, all Irishmen had been withdrawn from the British army and\r\nnavy on the receipt of Dublin's firmly-worded note to the effect that\r\nsince the granting of extended Home Rule, Irishmen came within the\r\nsphere of the Foreign Enlistment Act. These men formed the nucleus of a\r\nvery useful army with which Ireland thought it would be practicable to\r\nhold out in the interior until foreign intervention came to its aid.\r\nPossibly England thought so too, for Mr Strummery's Ministry contented\r\nitself with issuing what its members described as a firm and dignified\r\nprotest. Closely examined, it was discoverable that the dignified\r\nportion was a lengthy recapitulation of ancient history; the firm\r\nportion a record of Dublin's demands since Home Rule had been conceded,\r\nwhile the essential part of the communication informed the new republic\r\nthat its actions were not what his Majesty's Ministers had expected of\r\nit, and that they would certainly reserve the right of taking the matter\r\nin hand at some future time more suitable to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe other harassment was that Leicester lay at the mercy of an epidemic\r\nof small-pox which threatened to become historic in the annals of the\r\nscourge. In the second month the average daily number of deaths had\r\nrisen to 120, and there was no sign of a decrease. In the autumn it was\r\nhoped that the winter would kill the disease; in the winter it was\r\nanticipated that it would die out naturally under the influence of the\r\nspring sunshine. The situation affected Mr Chadwing more closely than\r\nany of his colleagues, for Leicester had the honour of returning the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer as one of its members. Under normal\r\nconditions Mr Chadwing made a practice of visiting his constituency and\r\naddressing a meeting every few weeks, but during the six months that the\r\nepidemic raged he found himself unable to leave London. His attitude was\r\nperfectly consistent, in spite of the hard things that some of his\r\nsupporters said of him in his absence: like the majority of his\r\nconstituents, he had a Conscientious Objection to vaccination, but he\r\nalso had an even stronger conscientious objection to encountering\r\nsmall-pox infection.\r\n\r\nThe 24th of November ushered in a new phase of the strife. It marked the\r\nbeginning of the Dark Winter. Early in December the newspapers began to\r\ndraw comparisons between the weather then prevailing and the hard\r\nwinters on record. At that date it was noticeable how many\r\nrustic-looking vagrants were to be seen walking aimlessly about the\r\nstreets of London. The unemployed from the country were beginning to\r\nflock in for the mere sense of warmth. The British Museum, St. Paul's\r\nCathedral, the free libraries, and other places where it was possible to\r\nescape from the dreadful rigour of the streets, were crowded by day. At\r\nnight long _queues_ of miserable creatures haunted the grids of\r\nrestaurants, the sheltered sides of theatres, the windows of printing\r\nhouses, and any spot where a little warmth exhaled. On the nights of the\r\n4th, the 5th, and the 6th of December the thermometer on Primrose Hill\r\nregistered 3 deg. below zero. On the 7th pheasants were observed feeding\r\namong the pigeons in the main street of Highgate, and from that time\r\nonwards wild birds of the rarer kinds were no unusual sight in the\r\nLondon parks and about the public buildings. In the country it was\r\nremarked that the small birds had begun to disappear, and the curious\r\nmight read any morning of frozen goldfinches being picked up in\r\nCamberwell, larks about Victoria Park, and starlings, robins,\r\nblackbirds, and such like fry everywhere. By this time dairymen had\r\ndiscovered that it was impossible to deliver milk unless they carried a\r\nbrazier of live charcoal on their cart or hand-truck. Local\r\ncorrespondents in the provinces had ceased to report ordinary cases of\r\ndeath from cold and exposure; there were cases in the streets of London\r\nevery night.\r\n\r\nEarly in December Sir John Hampden was approached unofficially by a few\r\nmembers of Parliament, including one or two of minor official rank, to\r\nlearn his \"terms.\" The suggestions were tentative on both sides, and\r\nnothing was stated definitely. But out of the circumlocution it might be\r\ninferred that he expressed his willingness to rescind the boycott, and\r\nto devote five million pounds to public relief at once, in return for\r\ncertain modifications of the franchise and an immediate dissolution.\r\nNothing came of the movement, and during the first week of December the\r\nGovernment sent round to the post-offices and to all the Crown tax\r\ncollectors notices that the licences ordinarily falling due on the 1st\r\nof January must be taken out on or before the 15th of the current month,\r\nand the King's Taxes similarly collected in advance. The League did not\r\nmake any open comment on this departure, but every member merely ignored\r\nit, and when the 16th of December was reached, it devolved upon the\r\nofficers of the Crown to enforce the payment by legal process. In the\r\nlanguage of another age, the Government was faced by five million\r\n\"Passive Resisters.\" It soon became apparent that instead of getting in\r\nthe taxes a fortnight before their time, the greater part of the revenue\r\nfrom that source would be delayed at least a month later than usual.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December one million and three-quarters State-supported\r\nunemployed of various grades presented themselves at the appointed\r\ntrades unions committee rooms, workhouse offices, employment bureaux,\r\nTreasury depots, from which the Fund was administered, to receive their\r\nweekly \"wage.\" As they passed in they were confronted by a formal notice\r\nto the effect that the disbursement was then reduced to half its usual\r\namount. As they passed out they came upon another formal notice to the\r\neffect that after the following week the Grant would be \"temporarily\r\nsuspended.\" Possibly that also embodied an idea of \"breaking it gently.\"\r\n\r\nThe cry of surprise, rage, and terrified foreboding that rose from every\r\ntown and village of the land when the direful news was at length\r\nunderstood, can never be described. Its echoes were destined to roll\r\nthrough the pages of English history for many a generation. The\r\nimmediate result was that rioting broke out in practically all parts of\r\nthe country except the purely agricultural. The people who had been\r\npromised a perpetual life of milk and honey had \"murmured\" when they\r\nwere offered bread and water. Now there seemed every prospect of the\r\nwater reaching them as ice, and the bread-board being empty, and their\r\n\"murmuring\" took a sharper edge. In some places there were absolute\r\nstampedes of reason. In justice it has to be remembered that by this\r\ntime the most pitiless winter of modern times had been heaping misery on\r\nmisery for a month, that the chance of finding work or relief was\r\nrecognised to be the forlornest hope, and that very, very few had a\r\nreserve of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe indiscriminate disturbances of the 20th of December were easily\r\nsuppressed. A people that has been free for generations loses the gift\r\nfor successful rioting in the face of armed discipline, even of the most\r\ninadequate strength. But for constitutional purposes the body of one\r\ndragooned rioter in England was worth more than a whole \"Vladimir's\r\nbattue\" east of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of December the certified unemployed drew their diminished\r\npittance for the last time. They left the buildings in many places with\r\nthe significant threat that they would return that day week, and if\r\nthere was nothing for them would \"warm their hands\" there at the least.\r\nThere was renewed rioting that day also. The forces of law and order had\r\nbeen strengthened; the rioters appeared to have been better organised.\r\nIn one or two towns the rioting began to approach the Continental level.\r\nBolton was said to have proved itself far from amateurish, and Nuneaton\r\nwas spoken of as being distinctly promising. At the end of that day\r\npublic buildings had to be requisitioned in several places to lay out\r\nthe spoils of victory and defeat.\r\n\r\nTwo days later every newspaper contained an \"open letter\" from Sir John\r\nHampden to the Government, in which he unconditionally offered them, on\r\nbehalf of the Unity League and in the name of humanity, sufficient funds\r\nto pay the half grant for four weeks longer. It was a humane offer, but\r\nits proper name was strategy. It embarrassed the Government to decide\r\nwhether to accept or decline. It embarrassed them if they accepted, and\r\nif they declined it embarrassed them most of all. They declined; or, to\r\nbe precise, they ignored the offer.\r\n\r\nBy this time England might be said to be under famine. London, in its\r\nice-bound straits, began curiously to assume the appearance of a\r\nmediaeval city. By night one might meet grotesquely clad bands of\r\nrevellers returning from some ice carnival (for the Thames had long been\r\nfrozen from the Tower to Gravesend) by the light of lanterns and torches\r\nwhich they carried. None but those who had nothing to lose ventured out\r\ninto the streets at night except by companies. Thieves and bludgeoners\r\nlurked in every archway, and arrests were seldom made; beggars\r\nimportuned with every wile and in every tone, and new fantastic creeds\r\nand extravagant new parties sent out their perfervid disciples to\r\nproclaim Utopias at every corner.\r\n\r\nTo add to the terror of the night there suddenly sprang into prominence\r\nthe bands of \"Running Madmen\" who swept through the streets like fallen\r\nleaves in an autumn gale. Barefooted, gaunt, and wildly dressed in rags,\r\nthey broke upon the astonished wayfarer's sight, and passed out again\r\ninto the gloom before he could ask himself what strange manner of men\r\nthey were. Never alone, seldom exceeding a score in any band, they ran\r\nkeenly as though with some purposeful end in view, for the most part\r\nsilently, but now and then startling the quiet night with an\r\ninarticulate wail or a cry of woe or lamentation, but they turned from\r\nstreet to street in aimless intricacy, and sought no definite goal. They\r\nwere never seen by day, and whence they came or where they had their\r\nhomes none could say, but the steady increase in the number of their\r\nbands showed that they were undoubtedly the victims of a contagious\r\nmania such as those that have appeared in the past from time to time.\r\n\r\nAlmost as ragged and unkempt was the army that by day marched under the\r\nstandard of Brother Ambrose towards the sinless New Jerusalem. Reading\r\nthe abundant signs all round with an inspired and fatalistic eye,\r\nAmbrose uncompromisingly announced that all the portents of the\r\nMillennium were now fulfilled, and that the reign of temporal power on\r\nearth was at an end. Each day his eloquence mounted to a wilder flight,\r\neach day he dreamed new dreams and saw fresh visions, and promised to\r\nhis followers more definitely the spoil of victory, and parcelled out\r\nthe smiling, fruitful land. Drawn by every human passion, recruits\r\npoured into his ranks, and when he marched in tattered state to mark the\r\nboundaries of the impending Golden City, the Legions of the Chosen\r\nrolled not in their thousands, but in their tens of thousands, singing\r\nhymns and interspersing ribaldry.\r\n\r\nA very different spectacle was afforded by the bands of the Gilded Youth\r\nwhich by day patrolled the approaches to houses of the better class,\r\nwherever smoke had been seen issuing from the chimneys, and by night\r\nwith equal order and thoroughness turned out the public gas lamps in the\r\nstreets, until many of the authorities at last gave up the lighting of\r\nthe lamps as a useless formality.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the occupants of a house that had incurred their\r\nenmity to have them removed by force, or to maintain an attitude of\r\nunconcern in the face of their demonstration, yet everything they did\r\ncame under the term of \"Peaceful Picketing\" within the provisions of the\r\nAct, and an attempt to fix responsibility upon the Unity League for the\r\nhigh-handed action of its agents in a few cases where the Gilded Youth\r\nhad gone beyond their powers, failed ignominiously through the precedent\r\nafforded by the final settlement of the celebrated Tawe Valley Case.\r\n\r\nIn the provinces the rioters were burning coal, burning coal-pits,\r\nsmashing machinery and destroying property indiscriminately, blind to\r\nthe fact that some of the immediate effects were falling on their\r\nfellow-workmen, and that most of the ultimate effects would fall upon\r\nthemselves. In London and elsewhere the bands of the Gilded Youth were\r\ngoing quietly and systematically about their daily work, \"peacefully\"\r\nterrorising house-holders into submission, and carefully turning out the\r\npublic lamps at night as soon as they were lit. To the reflective mind\r\nit was rather a dreadful power that the time had called into being: an\r\neducated mob that \"rioted peacefully\" and did nothing at all that was\r\ndetrimental to its own interest.\r\n\r\nEach morning people assured one another that so unparalleled a frost\r\ncould last no longer, but each night the air seemed to be whetted to a\r\nkeener edge, and each day there came fresh evidences of its power. Early\r\nin January it was computed that all the small birds that had not taken\r\nrefuge in towns were dead, partly through the cold itself, but equally\r\nby starvation, for the ground yielded them nothing, and the trees and\r\nshrubs upon which they had been able to rely for food in former winters\r\nhad long since perished. There were none but insignificant hollies to be\r\nseen in English gardens for the next generation, and in exposed\r\nsituations forest trees and even oaks were split down to the ground.\r\n\r\nAll this time there was very little destructive rioting going on in\r\nLondon on any organised scale, but every night breadths of wood pavement\r\nwere torn up by the homeless vagrants, who were now allowed to herd\r\nwhere they could, and great fires set burning at which the police warmed\r\nthemselves and mingled supinely with the crowd. By day the police went\r\nin pairs, by night they patrolled in companies of five. For the\r\nemergency of serious rioting the military were always kept in readiness;\r\nagainst the more ordinary depredations on private property the owners\r\nwere practically left to defend themselves. In those dark weeks watch\r\nduty became one of the regular occupations among the staff of every\r\nLondon business, and short shrift was given to intruders. Inquests went\r\nlike marriages in busy churches at Easter-tide--in batches, and the\r\nmorning cart that picked up the frozen dead had only one compartment.\r\n\r\nThe time was past when the effects of the vast disorganisation could be\r\nlocalised. Every trade and profession, every trivial and obscure\r\ncalling, and every insignificant little offshoot of that great trunk\r\ncalled Commerce was involved in depression; it was not too much to say\r\nthat every individual in the land was feeling some ill effect. Frantic\r\nlegislation had begun it ten years before; the coal war had brought it\r\nto a climax, and the grip of the long, hard winter had pressed like a\r\nhostile hand upon the land.\r\n\r\nIt had resolved itself into a war of endurance. Coal was no longer the\r\npivot; it was money, immediate money with which to buy bread at the\r\nbakers' shops, where they carried on their trade with the shutters up\r\nand loaded weapons laid out in the upper rooms.\r\n\r\nNot the least curious feature of the struggle was the marked\r\ndisinclination of the starving populace to pillage or bloodshed.\r\nDoubtless they saw that whatever they might individually profit by a\r\nreign of terror, their cause and party had nothing to gain from it. Such\r\nan outburst must inevitably react unfavourably upon the Government of\r\nthe day, and it was _their_ party then in power. But they had not the\r\nmob instinct in them; they were not composed of the ordinary mob\r\nelement. In the bulk they were neither criminals nor hooligans, but\r\nmatter-of-fact, disillusionised working men, and the instincts of their\r\nclass have ever been steady and law-abiding. In Cheapside a gang of\r\nprofessional thieves blew out the iron shutter of a jeweller's shop with\r\ndynamite, and securing a valuable haul of jewellery in the momentary\r\nconfusion, sought to hide themselves among the mob. Far from entering\r\ninto their aspirations, the mob promptly conveyed them to the nearest\r\npolice station, and returned to the owner the valuable articles that had\r\nbeen scattered about the street. The climax of the incident was reached\r\nby half a dozen of the most stalwart unemployed gladly accepting a few\r\nshillings each to guard the broken window until the shutter was\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nAt the collieries, the mills, the workshops, and the seats of labour\r\nthere were outrages against property, but away from the immediate\r\ncentres there was neither cupidity nor resentment. Whenever disturbances\r\nof the kind took place they were invariably in pursuit of food or\r\nwarmth. The men were dispirited, and by this time they regarded their\r\ncause as lost. Their leaders, in and out of Parliament, were classed\r\neither as incompetent generals in a war, or as traitors who had misled\r\nthe people. The people only asked them now to make the terms of\r\nsurrender so that they might live; and they did not hesitate to declare\r\nroundly that the old times when they had had to look after themselves\r\nmore, and had not been body and soul at the disposal of semi-political\r\nUnions, were preferable on the whole.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Cabinet was daily growing more critical. Its chiefs\r\nwere execrated and insulted whenever they were seen. All the approaches\r\nto the House were held by military guards, and the members reached its\r\ngates singly, and almost by stealth. Every day placards, written and\r\nprinted, were found displayed in public places, calling on the\r\nGovernment that had no money to let in one that had. \"You thought more\r\nof your position than of our needs when Hampden offered us help,\" ran\r\none that Mr Strummery found nailed to his front door. \"You have always\r\nthought more of your positions than of our needs. You have used our\r\nneeds to raise yourselves to those positions. Now, since you no longer\r\nrepresent the wishes of the People, give way to others.\"\r\n\r\nThe delay of the Government in throwing up an utterly untenable position\r\nwas inexplicable to most people. Many said that the reason was that\r\nHampden refused to take office under the existing franchise, and no one\r\nbut Hampden could form an administration in that crisis that could hope\r\nto live for a day. Whatever the reason might be, it was obvious that the\r\nGovernment was drifting towards a national tragedy that would be\r\nstupendous, for in less than a month's time, it was agreed on all hands,\r\nthe daily tale of starved and famished dead would have reached its\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nStill the Government hung on, backed in sullen submission by its\r\nautomatic majority. Changes in the Cabinet were of almost daily record,\r\nbut the half dozen men of prominence remained. Cecil Brown was the last\r\nof the old minor men to be dropped. A dog trainer, who had taken up\r\npolitics, succeeded him. \"It is too late now,\" Cecil Brown was reported\r\nto have said when he learned who was to be his successor. \"They want\r\nbread, not circuses!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE INCIDENT OF THE 13TH OF JANUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not altogether like it,\" said A.\r\n\r\n\"Do you prefer to leave things as they are, then?\" demanded B.\r\n\r\nA. went over and stood by the window, looking moodily out.\r\n\r\n\"It is merely a necessity,\" said C.\r\n\r\n\"The necessity of a necessity,\" suggested D. happily.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are not aware,\" said B., addressing himself to the man\r\nstanding at the window, \"that the suggestion of arresting Salt did not\r\ncome from us in the first case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\" replied A., coming back into the room. \"I certainly\r\nassumed that it did.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" explained B., \"it was Inspector Moeletter who\r\nreported to his superiors that he had succeeded in identifying the\r\nmysterious man who was seen with Leslie Garnet, the artist, about the\r\ntime of his death. He would have got his warrant in the ordinary way,\r\nonly in view of the remarkable position that Salt occupies just now,\r\nStafford very naturally communicated with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only point that troubles us,\" remarked C. reflectively, \"is that\r\nnone of us can persuade himself in the remotest degree that Salt killed\r\nGarnet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainty require to have the evidence before I can subscribe to\r\nthat,\" said B. \"The man who is daily killing hundreds----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is the difference,\" commented D.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the Monmouth colliers now?\" asked C., after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Newbury, this morning,\" replied D. \"Reading, to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Midland lot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Towcester, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Hampden formally asks for protection for the oil store at Hanwood,\r\nafter the miners' threat to burn it, what are you going to do?\" asked A.\r\n\r\n\"I should suggest telling him to go and boil himself in it, since he has\r\ngot it there,\" replied C.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no need to tell him anything but the bare fact, and that\r\nis that with twenty-five thousand turbulent colliers pouring into London\r\nand adding to the disaffected element already here, we cannot spare a\r\nsingle man,\" replied B.\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with that,\" remarked D., drawing attention to his\r\nfreshly-scarred cheek. \"I had a tribute of the mob's affection as I came\r\nin this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your popularity,\" said C. \"Your photograph is so much about that\r\nno one has any difficulty in recognising you. How do you get on in that\r\nway, B.?\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\" exclaimed B. with a startled look. \"Oh, I always drive with the\r\nblinds down now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are any extra military coming in before Friday?\" asked A.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the Lancers from Hounslow. They come into the empty Albany Street\r\nBarracks to-night. Then I think that there are to be some extra infantry\r\nin Whitehall, from Aldershot. Cadman is seeing to all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know that the Lancers are being drawn from Hounslow?\" asked C.\r\nwith a meaning laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know that,\" admitted B. \"Why do you laugh, C.?\"\r\n\r\nC.'s only reply was to laugh again.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you why he laughs,\" volunteered D. \"He laughs, B., because\r\nthe Lancers withdrawn from Hounslow to Regent's Park, Salt under arrest\r\nat Stafford, and the Monmouth colliers coming along the Bath road and\r\npassing within a mile or two of Hanwood, represent the three angles of a\r\nvery acute triangle.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is still Hampden,\" muttered B.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; what is going to happen to Hampden?\" asked C., with a trace of his\r\nmordant amusement.\r\n\r\nA., who was walking about the room aimlessly, stopped and faced the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" he exclaimed emphatically. \"I said just now that I\r\ndidn't like the idea of smuggling Salt away like this, and, although it\r\nmay be advisable, I don't. But I wish to God that we had openly arrested\r\nthe pair of them as traitors, and burned their diabolical store before\r\nevery one's eyes three months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said D. thoughtfully, \"it was too early then. Now it's too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be too late to have its full effect,\" flashed out B., \"but it\r\nwon't be too late to make them suffer a bit along with our own people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Provided that the oil is burned,\" said D.\r\n\r\n\"Provided that no protection can be sent,\" remarked C.\r\n\r\n\"Provided that Salt is arrested,\" added A.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. It explained the attitude of the four men\r\nin the room and their scattered conversation. They had been awaiting\r\nsome one.\r\n\r\nHe came into the room and saluted, a powerfully-built man with \"uniform\"\r\nbranded on every limb, although he wore plain clothes then.\r\n\r\n\"Detective-Inspector Moeletter?\" said B.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the inspector, and stood at attention.\r\n\r\n\"You have the warrant?\" continued B.\r\n\r\nMoeletter produced it, and passed it in for inspection. It was made out\r\non the preceding day, signed by the Stipendiary Magistrate of Stafford,\r\nand it connected George Salt with Leslie Garnet by the link of Murder.\r\n\r\n\"When you applied for this warrant,\" said B., looking hard at the\r\ninspector, \"you considered that you had sufficient evidence to support\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nMoeletter looked puzzled for a moment, as though the question was one\r\nthat he did not quite follow in that form. For a moment he seemed to be\r\non the verge of making an explanation; then he thought better of it, and\r\nsimply replied: \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" continued B. hastily, \"you have enough evidence to\r\njustify a remand? What are the points?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have abundant evidence that Salt was in the neighbourhood about the\r\ntime of the tragedy; that fact can scarcely be contested. Coming nearer,\r\nan old man, who had been hedging until the storm drove him under a high\r\nbank, saw a gentleman enter Garnet's cottage about half-past five.\r\nWithout any leading he described this man accurately as Salt, and picked\r\nout his photograph from among a dozen others. About an hour later, two\r\nboys, who were bird-nesting near Stourton Hill church, heard a shot.\r\nThey looked through the hedge into the graveyard and saw one man lying\r\napparently dead on the ground, and another bending over him as though he\r\nmight be going through his pockets. Being frightened, they ran away and\r\ntold no one of it for some time, as boys would. Of course, sir, that's\r\nmore than six months ago now, but the description they give tallies, and\r\nI think that we may claim a strong presumption of identity taking into\r\nconsideration the established time of Salt's arrival at Thornley.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all?\" said B.\r\n\r\n\"As regards identity,\" replied the inspector. \"On general grounds we\r\nshall show that for some time before his death Garnet had been selling\r\nshares and securities which he held, and that although he lived frugally\r\nno money was found in the remains of his house or on his person, and no\r\ntrace of a banking account or other investment can be discovered. Then\r\nwe allege that 'George Salt' is not the man's right name, although we\r\nhave not been able to follow that up yet. He is generally understood to\r\nhave been a sailor recently, and the revolver found beside the body was\r\nof a naval pattern. I should add that the medical evidence at the\r\ninquest was to the effect that the wound might have been self-inflicted,\r\nbut that the angle was unusual.\"\r\n\r\nB. returned the warrant to the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"That will at least ensure a remand for a week for you to continue your\r\ninvestigations?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without bail?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is opposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We oppose it, then. Did you bring any one down with you?\"\r\n\r\nInspector Moeletter had not done so. He had not been able to anticipate\r\nwhat amended instructions he might receive in London, so he had thought\r\nit as well to come alone.\r\n\r\n\"For political reasons it is desirable that nothing should be known\r\npublicly of the arrest until you have your prisoner safely at Stafford,\"\r\nsaid B. \"At present he is motoring in the southern counties. I have\r\ninformation that he will leave Farnham this afternoon between three and\r\nhalf-past and proceed direct to Guildford. Is there any reason why you\r\nshould not arrest him between the two places?\"\r\n\r\nInspector Moeletter knew of none.\r\n\r\n\"It will be preferable to doing so in either town from our point of\r\nview,\" continued B., \"and it is not known whether he intends leaving\r\nGuildford to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector took out an innocent-looking pocket-book, whose elastic\r\nband was a veritable hangman's noose, and noted the facts.\r\n\r\n\"Is a description of the motor-car available?\" he enquired.\r\n\r\nB. picked up a sheet of paper. \"It is a large car, a 30 H.P. Daimler,\r\nwith a covered body, and painted in two shades of green,\" he read from\r\nthe paper. \"The number is L.N. 7246.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would suggest bringing him straight on in the car,\" said Moeletter.\r\n\"It would obviate the publicity of railway travelling.\"\r\n\r\nB. nodded. \"There is another thing,\" he said. \"It is absolutely\r\nnecessary to avoid the London termini. They are all watched\r\nsystematically by agents of the League--spies who call themselves\r\npatriots. You will take the 7.30 train with your prisoner, but you will\r\njoin it at Willesden. I will have it stopped for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall need a man who can drive the motor to go down with me,\" the\r\ndetective reminded him.\r\n\r\nB. struck a bell. \"Send Sergeant Tolkeith in,\" he said to the attendant.\r\n\r\nSergeant Tolkeith was apparently being kept ready in the next room, to\r\nbe slipped at the fall of the flag, so to speak. He came in very\r\nsmartly.\r\n\r\n\"You will remain with Inspector Moeletter while he is in London, and\r\nmake all the necessary arrangements for him,\" instructed B. \"I suppose\r\nthat there are men at Scotland Yard available now who can drive every\r\nkind of motor?\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Tolkeith hazarded the opinion that there were men at Scotland\r\nYard at that moment who could drive--he looked round the room in search\r\nof some strange or Titanic vehicle to which the prowess of Scotland Yard\r\nwould be equal--\"Well, Anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man who knows the roads,\" continued B. \"Though, for that matter, it's\r\na simple enough route--the Portsmouth road all the way to Kingston, and\r\nthen across to Willesden. You had better avoid Guildford, by the way,\r\ncoming back. Now, what other assistance will you require?\"\r\n\r\n\"How many are there likely to be in the car, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one but Salt, I am informed. He has been touring alone for a week\r\npast, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, sir, we had better take a couple of men from Guildford\r\nand drive towards Farnham. We can wait at a suitable place in the road\r\nand make the arrest. Then when the irons are on I shall need no one\r\nbeyond the driver I take with me. The two local men--you'll want Mr\r\nSalt's _chauffeur_ detained for a few hours, I suppose, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly; until you are well on your way. And any one else who\r\nmay happen to be in the car. I will give you authority covering that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two local men can take him, or them, back to Guildford--it will be\r\ndark by the time they get there--for detention while enquiries are being\r\nmade. Then if a plain-clothes man meets me at Willesden we can go on,\r\nand our driver can take the car on to Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see no difficulty throughout?\" said B. anxiously. The inspector\r\nassured him that all seemed plain sailing. It was not his place to\r\nforesee difficulties in B.'s plans.\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall expect you to report to me from Stafford about 10.30\r\nto-night that everything is satisfactory. Let me impress on you as a\r\nlast word the need of care and _unconcern_ in this case. It must be\r\nsuccessfully carried out, and to do that there must be no fuss or\r\npublicity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sergeant,\" said Detective-Inspector Moeletter, when they were outside,\r\n\"between ourselves, can you tell me this: why they think it necessary to\r\nhave three mute gentlemen looking on while we arrange a matter of this\r\nsort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between ourselves, sir,\" replied Sergeant Tolkeith, looking cautiously\r\naround, \"it's my belief that it's come to this: that they are all\r\nhalf-afraid of themselves and can't trust one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"D.,\" remarked C., as they left together a few minutes later, \"does\r\nanything strike you about B.?\"\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me that he looks rather like an undertaker's man when he is\r\ndressed up,\" replied D.\r\n\r\n\"Does it not strike you that he is _afraid_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" admitted D., stroking his wounded cheek, \"that's quite possible.\r\nSo am I, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"So may we all be in a way,\" said C.; \"but it is different with him. I\r\nbelieve that he is in a _blue funk_. He's fey, and he's got Salt on the\r\nbrain. Just remember that I venture on this prophecy: if Salt through\r\nany cause does not happen to get arrested, B. will throw up the sponge.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe office of the Unity League in Trafalgar Chambers was little more\r\nthan an empty hive now. The headquarters of the operations had been\r\ntransferred to the colony at Hanwood, and most of the staff had\r\nfollowed. With the declaration of the coal war, an entirely different\r\nset of conditions had come into force. The old offices had practically\r\nbecome a clearing house for everything connected with the League, and\r\nthe high tide of active interest swept on elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMiss Lisle remained, a person of some consequence, but in her heart she\r\nsighed from time to time for a sphere of action \"down another little\r\nlane.\"\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 13th of January she returned to the office about\r\nhalf-past three, and going to the instrument room unlocked the\r\ntelescribe receiver-box and proceeded to sort the dozen communications\r\nwhich it contained--the accumulation of an hour--before passing them on\r\nto be dealt with. Most fell into clearly-defined departments at a\r\nglance. It was not until she reached the last, the earliest sent, that\r\nshe read it through, but as she read that her whole half-listless,\r\nmechanical manner changed. With the first line apathy fell from her like\r\na cloak; before she had finished, every limb and feature conveyed a\r\nsense of tingling excitement. In frantic haste she dragged the special\r\nwriting materials across the table towards her, dashed off a sprawling,\r\n\"Stop Mr Salt at any cost.--LISLE,\" and flashed it off to the League\r\nagency at Farnham.\r\n\r\nA couple of minutes must pass before she could get any reply. She picked\r\nup the cause of her excitement, and for the second time read the message\r\nit contained:\r\n\r\n\"If you want to keep your Mr Salt from being arrested on a charge of\r\nmurder, warn him that Inspector Moeletter from Stafford will be waiting\r\nfor him on the road between Farnham and Guildford at three o'clock this\r\nafternoon with a warrant. No one believes in it, but he will be taken on\r\nin his motor to Willesden, and on to Stafford by the 7.30, and kept out\r\nof the way for a week while things have time to happen at Hanwood. There\r\nwill be just enough evidence to get a remand, as there was to get a\r\nwarrant. This is from a friend, who may remind you of it later and prove\r\nwho he is by this sign.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter finished with a rough drawing of a gallows and a broken rope.\r\nIt was written in a cramped, feigned hand and addressed to Sir John\r\nHampden. It might have been lying in the box for an hour.\r\n\r\nThe telescribe bell gave its single note. Irene opened the box in\r\nfeverish dread. An exclamation of despair broke from her lips as some\r\nwords on the paper stood out in the intensity of their significance even\r\nbefore she took the letter from the box.\r\n\r\nThis was what Farnham replied:\r\n\r\n\"Hope nothing is the matter. Mr Salt left here quite half an hour ago,\r\nin his motor, for Guildford. He will stay there the night, or proceed to\r\nHanwood according to the time he is occupied. Please let me know if\r\nthere is any trouble.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour! There was not the remotest chance of intercepting him.\r\nAlready, under ordinary circumstances, he would be in the outskirts of\r\nGuildford. It only remained to verify the worst. She wrote a brief\r\nmessage asking Mr Salt if he would kindly communicate with her\r\nimmediately on his arrival, and despatched it to the agency at\r\nGuildford. If there was no reply to that request during the next\r\nhalf-hour she would accept the arrest as an established fact. And there\r\nbeing nothing apparently to do for the next half-hour, Miss Lisle, very\r\nmuch to the surprise of ninety-nine out of her hundred friends could\r\nthey have seen her, went down on her knees in the midst of a roomful of\r\nthe latest achievements of science and began to pray that a miracle\r\nmight happen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that I may smoke?\" said Salt. He was sitting handcuffed in\r\nhis own motor-car, charged with murder, and formally cautioned that\r\nanything he should say might be used as evidence against him. It was\r\nscarcely a necessary warning in his case; with the exception of an\r\nequally formal protest against the arrest, he had not opened his lips\r\nuntil now. He and Moeletter had sat silently facing one another in the\r\ncomfortably-appointed, roomy car, Salt with his face to the driver and\r\nleaning back in his easy seat with outward unconcern, the detective\r\nbraced to a more alert attitude and with his knees almost touching those\r\nof his prisoner. For a mile or more--for perhaps seven or eight minutes\r\nby time, for the new driver was cautious with the yet unknown car--they\r\nhad proceeded thus.\r\n\r\nYet Salt was very far from being unconcerned as he leaned back\r\nnegligently among the cushions. He was thinking keenly, and with the\r\nsettled, tranquil gaze that betrayed nothing, watching alertly the miles\r\nof dreary high-road that stretched along the Hog's Back before them. He\r\nhad long foreseen the possibility of arrest, and he had taken certain\r\nprecautions; but to safeguard himself effectually he would have had to\r\nabandon the more important part of his work, and the risk he ran was the\r\nsmaller evil of the two. But he had not anticipated this charge. Some\r\nlegal jugglery with \"conspiracy\" had been in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that I may smoke?\" Half a mile ahead a solitary wayfarer was\r\napproaching. Salt might have noted him, but there was nothing remarkable\r\nin his appearance except that pedestrians--or vehicles either, for that\r\nmatter--were rare along the Hog's Back on that bitter winter afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly, sir; in your own car, surely,\" replied the inspector\r\nagreeably. He was there to do his duty, and he had done it, even down to\r\nthe detail of satisfying himself by search that his prisoner carried no\r\nweapon. Beyond that there was no reason to be churlish, especially as\r\nevery one had to admit that there was no telling what might have\r\nhappened in a week's or a month's time. \"Can I help you in any way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I will manage,\" replied Salt, and in spite of his manacles\r\nhe succeeded without much difficulty in taking out his cigarette-case\r\nand a match-box. He lit a cigarette, blew out the match, and then looked\r\nhesitatingly round the rather elegant car, at the rich velvety carpet on\r\nthe floor, at the half-burned vesta in his hand. Then with easy\r\nunconcern he lowered the window by his side and leaned forward towards\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfectly natural action, but Inspector Moeletter owed at least\r\none step in his promotion to a habit of always being on his guard\r\nagainst natural-seeming actions of that kind. His left foot quickly and\r\nimperceptibly slid across the carpet, so that if Salt made any\r\nill-judged attempt to leave the car he must inevitably come to grief\r\nacross that rigid barrier; with a ready eye Moeletter noted afresh the\r\nhandle of the door, the size of the window frame, and every kindred\r\ndetail. His hands lay in unostentatious readiness by his side, and he\r\nfelt no apprehension.\r\n\r\nBut Salt had not the faintest intention of attempting any sensational\r\nact. He dropped the match leisurely from between his fingers, cast a\r\nglance up to the sky, where the lowering clouds had long been\r\nthreatening snow, and then drew in his head. But in some way, either\r\nfrom his position, a jolt of the car, or a touch against the sash, as he\r\ndid so his cap was jerked off, and, despite a quick but clumsy attempt\r\nto catch it in his fettered hands, it was whirled away behind in their\r\neddying wake.\r\n\r\n\"Please stop,\" he said, turning to Moeletter. \"I am afraid that I shall\r\nfind it too cold without.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective was not pleased, but there was nothing in the mishap that\r\nhe could take objection to. Further, he had no wish to make his prisoner\r\nin any way noticeable during the latter part of their journey. \"Pull up,\r\nMurphy,\" he called through the tube by his shoulder, and with a grinding\r\nthat set its owner's teeth on edge, the car came to a standstill in two\r\nlengths.\r\n\r\nMoeletter had intended that the driver should recover the cap, but he\r\nwas saved the trouble. The solitary pedestrian had happened to be on the\r\nspot at the moment of the incident, and he was standing by the open\r\nwindow almost as soon as the car stopped. Forgetful of his indignity,\r\nSalt stretched out a manacled hand and received his property. \"Thank\r\nyou,\" he said with a pleasant smile. \"I am much obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Moeletter, through the tube.\r\n\r\n\"I think that I had better get used to these--'darbies' is the\r\nprofessional name, is it not, Inspector?--to these 'darbies' before I\r\nlook out again,\" remarked Salt good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe telescribe bell announced another message. It found Irene sitting at\r\nthe table in the instrument room with ordnance maps around her and the\r\nindex book of the League's most trusted agents lying open on the shelf.\r\nShe just glanced at the clock as she jumped up. It was 4.15, exactly the\r\nlast minute of the half-hour that she had fixed as the limit of\r\nuncertainty. The message might even yet be from Salt. But it was not; it\r\nwas this instead:\r\n\r\n\"Fear Mr Salt has been arrested. He is in his motor-car, handcuffed,\r\nproceeding towards Guildford, in charge of man who has appearance of\r\nbelonging to police force. Driver is not Mr Salt's man. Mr S. made opp.\r\nfor me to see sit., but said nothing. Passed just W. of Puttenham 3.55.\r\nRoads good, but snow beginning. Car trav only 10-12 m. hour. Shall\r\nremain here on chance being use. Don't hesitate.\"\r\n\r\nA hall-formed plan was already floating in the space between Miss\r\nLisle's adventurous brain and the maps. The Puttenham message\r\ncrystallised it. There was now something to go on. The route she knew\r\nalready; the times and mileages also lay beneath her hand. The scheme\r\nhad a hundred faults, and only one thing to recommend it--that it might\r\nsucceed. For ten minutes she flung herself into the details of the maps,\r\njotting down a time, a distance, here and there a detail of the road.\r\n\"Puttenham\" might remain at his box till dawn, but all the work, all the\r\nchance, was forward--before the car. At the end of ten minutes Irene\r\npicked up the accumulation of her labours and rang up the telephone\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Murphy?\" demanded the inspector through the tube, as the\r\ncar came to a dead stop. \"Something else in the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't quite make it out, sir,\" was the reply. \"We're just outside the\r\nlong railway arch, and there seems to be something on fire towards the\r\nother end. Terrible lot of smoke coming through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we run up to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is an unusually long bridge--fifty or sixty yards, I should say. I\r\nhardly like to take you on into that smoke, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well. Jump down and see what it is. Only be as sharp as you\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now pitch dark, and a driving, biting storm of snow and hail was\r\nblowing across their path from the east. When the constable-_chauffeur_\r\nhad learned sufficient of the car to give him confidence, the storm had\r\nswept down, and their progress had been scarcely any faster. There had\r\nbeen delays, too. By Ripley a heavy farm waggon had broken down almost\r\nbefore their eyes, and it had been ten minutes before a spare chain\r\nhorse could be obtained to drag it to the roadside. Further on some men\r\nfelling a tree in a coppice had clumsily allowed it to fall across the\r\nroad, and another ten minutes elapsed before it was cut in two and\r\nrolled aside. Fortunately they were not pressed for time. Fortunately,\r\nalso, the driver knew the way, for few people were afoot to face that\r\ndreadful stream of snow and ice with the lashing wind and the numbing\r\ncold. Two, two or three, or perhaps four men had chanced to be at hand\r\nwhen the car stopped, making their way towards the bridge, but the\r\nwreathing snow soon cut them off. Occasionally, when the wind and drift\r\nhung for a moment, a figure or two showed dimly and gigantic in the murk\r\nof the tunnel. Nothing of the fire could be seen, but the smoke\r\ncontinued to pour out, and the mingled odour of burned and unburned oil\r\nfilled the car.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the driver returned. When he had left his seat\r\nMoeletter had leaned forward, and with a gruff word of half apology had\r\nlaid a hand upon the rug across Salt's knees, so that he held, or at\r\nleast controlled, the connecting links of the handcuffs, while at the\r\nsame time his other hand had dropped quietly down to his hip-pocket. He\r\nnow lowered the window on the further side, still keeping his left hand\r\non the rug.\r\n\r\n\"Oil cart ablaze, sir,\" gasped the driver, between paroxysms of\r\ncoughing. \"Road simply running fire, and the fumes awful.\" His face was\r\nalmost completely protected beneath cap, goggles, and a storm shade that\r\nfell from the cap over the shoulders and buttoned across the mouth, but\r\nno covering had seemed effectual against the suffocating reek of the\r\nburning oil. The fire had melted the snow off his clothes, and he stood\r\nby the door with a bar of darkness just falling across his face, and the\r\nelectric light through the lowered window blazing upon his gleaming\r\nleathers, his gauntlets and puttee leggings, and the cumbrous numbered\r\nbadge that the regulations then imposed.\r\n\r\n\"It will be some time before the road is passable?\" asked Moeletter with\r\na frown.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hours perhaps,\" was the sputtering reply. \"Would suggest going by\r\nMolesey Bridge, sir. Best way now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it much out?\"\r\n\r\n\"The turning is half a mile back. From there it is no further than this\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know the way perfectly?\"\r\n\r\nThe driver nodded. \"Perfectly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; go on. We have plenty of time yet, but you might get a few\r\nmore miles out of her, if you think you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe driver jumped up to his seat, the horn gave its bull-like note of\r\nwarning, and gliding round the car began to head back towards Esher with\r\nthe open common on either side and the pelting wind behind. It slackened\r\nfor a moment at the fork in the high-road, turned to the right, and then\r\nbegan to draw away northward with an increased speed that showed the\r\ndriver to be capable of rising to his instructions.\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate that the inspector is not a motoring man,\" thought Salt\r\nto himself with an inward smile. \"This is very much too good.\" But the\r\ninspector only noticed that with the increased speed the car seemed to\r\nrun more smoothly, and even then he had no means of judging what the\r\nincrease had become. The man whose car it was knew that a very different\r\nexplanation than mere speed lay behind the sudden change that made the\r\nmotion now sheer luxury. He knew with absolute conviction what had\r\nhappened, and he would have known without any further evidence that the\r\ndriver who now had his hand upon the wheel was a thousand miles ahead of\r\nconstable-_chauffeur_ Murphy in motor-craft.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first suggestion of some friendly influence at work that\r\nhad stirred his mind. The incident of the stranded waggon across the\r\nroad by Ripley was little in itself. Even when they were a second time\r\ndelayed by the fallen tree a few miles further on nothing but an\r\nunreasoning hope could have called it more than coincidence. But with\r\nthe third episode a matured plan began to loom through the meaningless\r\ndelays. Oil was here, and where there was oil in England at that day the\r\nhand of the Unity League might be traced not far away. In his mind's eye\r\nSalt ran over half a dozen miles of the Portsmouth road. As far as he\r\ncould remember, if it was _intended_ to block the road there was\r\nscarcely a more suitable spot than the long railway bridge to be found\r\nbetween Esher and Kingston, and, followed the thought, if it was\r\nintended to force Moeletter to accept the bridge at Molesey, no point in\r\nall the high-road south of the fork would have served.\r\n\r\nThe three accidents had taken place each at the exact point where it\r\nwould best serve its purpose.\r\n\r\nSalt did not even glance at the driver when he returned from the fire.\r\nHe leaned back in his seat in simple enjoyment, and Inspector Moeletter\r\nthought from his appearance that he was going to sleep.\r\n\r\nThere was little to be gained by looking out, apart from the policy of\r\nunconcern. The huge white motor-car that was waiting in the cross-road\r\nby Esher station had its head-lights masked, and in the snow-storm and\r\nthe night it could not have been seen ten yards away. The driver of the\r\ngreen car sounded his horn for the road as he swept by, and ten seconds\r\nlater the white car glided out from its place of concealment like a\r\nghostly mastodon, and, baring its dazzling lamps, began to thrash along\r\nthe road in the other's wake.\r\n\r\nWhat would be their route when they had crossed the bridge? That was\r\nSalt's constant thought now, not because he was troubled by the chances,\r\nbut because it was the next point in the unknown plan that would serve\r\nto guide him. He had not long to wait under the dexterous pilotage of\r\nthe unknown hand outside. The flat, straight road became a tortuous\r\nvillage street, the lights of the Molesey shops and inns splashed in\r\nsplintering blurs across the streaming windows, an iron bridge shook and\r\nrumbled beneath their wheels, and they were in Middlesex.\r\n\r\nThe horn brayed out a continuous warning note, the car swung off to the\r\nleft, and Salt, with his eyes closed, knew exactly what had been\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nBut there was yet Inspector Moeletter to be reckoned with. He was\r\nignorant of the roads, but he had a well-developed gift of location, and\r\nthe abrupt turn to the left when he had seen what appeared to be a broad\r\nhigh-road leading straight on from Molesey Bridge, gave him a moment's\r\nthought. He turned to the speaking-tube.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure that this is right, Murphy?\" he asked sharply. \"Kingston\r\nmust lie away on the right.\"\r\n\r\n\"We go through Hampton this way, sir, and into the Kingston road at\r\nTwickenham,\" came the chattering reply in a half-frozen voice. \"It is\r\njust as near, and we don't meet the wind.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite true, although the inspector might not know it, but the\r\nready explanation seemed to satisfy him. Another circumstance would have\r\nset his mind at rest. At Hampton the route took them equally to the\r\nright. Salt did not know the road intimately, but he knew that if his\r\nsurmise was correct, they must very soon draw away to the left again.\r\nWhat would happen then? For three or four miles they would run between\r\nhedges and encounter nothing more urban than a scattered hamlet.\r\nTwickenham they would never see that night. Inspector Moeletter was far\r\nfrom being unsophisticated, and his suspicion had already once,\r\napparently, been touched. How would the race end?\r\n\r\nThe car slowed down for a moment, but so smoothly that it was almost\r\nimperceptible, and with a clanging bell an electric tram swung into\r\ntheir vision and out again. Salt was taking note of every trifle in this\r\nenthralling game. Why, he asked himself, had so expert a driver\r\nslackened speed with plenty of room to pass? He saw a possible\r\nexplanation. They had been meeting and overtaking trams at intervals all\r\nthe way from Molesey Bridge. In another minute they would have left the\r\nhigh-road and the tram route, and the driver wished to hide the fact\r\nfrom Moeletter as long as possible. He had therefore _waited_ to meet\r\nthis tram so that the inspector might unconsciously carry in his mind\r\nthe evidence of their presence to the last possible point.\r\n\r\nThey were no longer on the high-road; they had glided off somewhere\r\nwithout a warning note or any indication of speed or motion to betray\r\nthe turn they had taken. The houses were becoming sparser, fields\r\nintervened, with here and there a strung-out colony of cottages. Soon\r\neven the scattered buildings ceased, or appeared so rarely that they\r\nonly dotted long stretches of country lanes, and at every yard they\r\ntrembled on the verge of detection. Nothing but the glare of light\r\ninside the vehicle and the storm and darkness beyond could have hid for\r\na moment from even the least suspicious of men the fact that they were\r\nno longer travelling even the most secluded of suburban high-roads. And\r\nnow, as if aware that the deception could not be maintained much longer,\r\nthe driver began to increase the speed at every open stretch. Again\r\nnothing but his inspired skill and the perfectly-balanced excellence of\r\nthe car could disguise the fact that they flew along the level road;\r\nwhile among the narrow winding lanes they rushed at a headlong pace,\r\nshooting down declines and breasting little hills without a pause. The\r\nhorn boomed its warning every second, and from behind came the answering\r\nnote of the long white motor. It had crept nearer and nearer since they\r\nleft the high-road, and its brilliant head-lights now lit up the way as\r\nfar as the pilot car. Little chance for Moeletter to convoy his prisoner\r\nout of those deserted lanes whatever happened now!\r\n\r\nWhat means, what desperate means, he might have taken in a gallant\r\nattempt to retrieve the position if he had suspected treachery just a\r\nminute before he did, one may speculate but never know.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the uneasy instinct that everything was not right awoke too\r\nlate for him to make the stand. It was less than ten minutes after\r\nmeeting the last tram that he peered out into the night doubtfully, but\r\nin those ten minutes the green car had all but won its journey's end.\r\n\r\n\"Murphy,\" he cried imperiously, with his mouth to the tube and a\r\nstartled eye on Salt, \"tell me immediately where we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"A minute, sir,\" came the hasty answer, as the driver bent forward to\r\nverify some landmark. \"This brake----\r\n\r\n\"Stop this instant!\" roared the inspector, rising to his feet in rage\r\nand with a terrible foreboding.\r\n\r\nThere was a muffled rattle as they shot over a snow-laden bridge, a\r\ncurious sense of passing into a new atmosphere, and then with easy\r\nprecision the car drew round and stopped dead before the open double\r\ndoors of its own house. No one spoke for a moment. There was another\r\nmuffled roar outside, the sound of heavy iron doors clashing together,\r\nand the great white car reproduced their curve and drew up by their\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFrom the driver's seat of the green car the Hon. Bruce Wycombe, son and\r\nheir of old Viscount Chiltern and the most skilful motorist in Europe,\r\nclimbed painfully down, and, pulling off his head-gear, opened the door\r\nof the car with a bow that would have been more graceful if he had been\r\nless frozen.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to Hanwood after your long journey, Inspector Moeletter!\" he\r\nexclaimed most affably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC AND THE DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the great west road, ten thousand Monmouth colliers were streaming\r\ntowards London, in every stage of famine and discomfort. What they\r\nintended to do when they reached the Capital they had no clearer idea\r\nthan had the fifteen thousand Midlanders at Barnet. All they knew was\r\nthat they were starving at home, and they could be no worse off in\r\nLondon. Also in London there was to be found the Government, the\r\nGovernment that had betrayed them.\r\n\r\nThe conception of the march had been wild, the execution was lamentable.\r\nThe leaders might have taken Napoleon's descent on Moscow as their\r\nmodel. Ten hand-carts exhausted their commissariat. They were to live on\r\nthe land they passed through; but the land was agricultural and poor,\r\nthe populace regarded the Monmouth colliers as foreigners, and the\r\nresponse was scanty. Only one circumstance saved the march from becoming\r\na tragedy of hundreds instead of merely, as it was, a tragedy of scores.\r\n\r\nThe men were being fed from London. By whom, and why, not even their\r\nleaders knew, but each night a railway truck full of provisions was\r\nawaiting their arrival at a station on their route, and each day the\r\nmen's leader-in-chief was informed where the next supply would be. It\r\ninfluenced them to continue their journey pacifically when they must\r\notherwise, sooner or later, have abandoned all restraint and marched\r\nthrough anarchy. It enabled them to reach London. It added another\r\nelement to the Government's distraction in their day of reckoning. It\r\nwas a Detail.\r\n\r\nBut at Windsor there were no provisions waiting. No one knew why. The\r\nstation authorities had nothing to suggest. After a week's regular\r\nsupply the leaders had come to expect their daily truck-load, had come\r\nto rely implicitly upon it, and had made no other arrangements. They\r\nconferred together anxiously; it was all there was for them to do.\r\nWindsor was not sympathetic towards them. They had not expected it to\r\nbe, but they had expected to be independent of Windsor's friendship. Two\r\nthousand special constables escorted them in and shepherded them\r\nassiduously. Otherwise there might have been disturbances, for a Castle\r\nguard comprised the extent of Windsor's military resources then. As it\r\nwas, the miners reached the Royal Borough hungry, and left it famished.\r\nA rumour spread along the ranks as they set out that an unfortunate\r\nmistake had been made, but that supplies would be awaiting them in Hyde\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nIf that was a detail, as it might well have been, it was not wholly\r\nsuccessful. The men were hungry and dispirited, but London was not their\r\nimmediate goal. For weeks they had been telling the vacillating Cabinet\r\nwhat ought to be done with the oil at Hanwood, and as they set out they\r\nhad boasted to their brothers across the Rhymney that before they\r\nreturned they would show them how to fire a beacon that would singe the\r\nhair of five million Leaguers. Midway between Windsor and London they\r\nproceeded to turn off from the highway under the direction of their\r\nleaders, and debouching from the narrow lanes on to the fields beyond,\r\nthey began to advance across the country in a straggling, far-flung\r\nwave.\r\n\r\nOn the previous day both the Home Office and the War Office had received\r\napplications for protection from the Company at Hanwood, backed by\r\nevidence which left no possible doubt that the Monmouth unemployed\r\ncontemplated an organised attack on the oil store. The two departments\r\nreplied distantly, that in view of the existing conditions within the\r\nMetropolis and the forces at their disposal, it was impossible to\r\ndespatch either troops or constabulary to protect private property in\r\nisolated districts. Hanwood acknowledged these replies, and gave notice\r\nwith equal punctilio that they would take the best means within their\r\npower for safeguarding their interests, and at the same time formally\r\nnotified the Government that they held them responsible, through their\r\nfailure to carry out the obligations of their office, for all the\r\ndevelopments that the situation might lead to--an exchange of civilities\r\nwhich in private life is sometimes attained much more simply by two\r\ndisputants consigning each other to the society of the Prince of\r\nDarkness in four words.\r\n\r\nWhatever there might be behind the intimation, there was little to\r\nindicate it at dusk that afternoon. The stranger or the native passing\r\nalong Miss Lisle's secluded lane would have noticed only two\r\ncircumstances to suggest anything unusual in the air.\r\n\r\nA few hundred feet above the trees within the wall, a box-kite was\r\nstraining at its rope in the rising gale. From the basket car a man\r\nwatched every movement of the countryside through his field-glasses, and\r\nconversed from time to time through a telephone with the kite section\r\ndown below. A second wire ran from the field telephone to a room of the\r\noffices where Salt was engaged with half a dozen of the chiefs of the\r\nCouncil of the League. Sir John Hampden was not present. He was\r\nremaining in London to afford the Government every facility for\r\nnegotiating a settlement whenever they might desire it.\r\n\r\nIn the lane, a group of men with tickets in their hats were loitering\r\nabout the bridge. They comprised a Peaceful Picket within the meaning of\r\nthe Act. They had been there since daybreak, and so far no one had shown\r\nany wish to dispute their position.\r\n\r\nThe war-kite and the picket in the lane were the \"eyes\" of the opposing\r\nbelligerents.\r\n\r\nThe League had nothing to gain by submitting the issue to the\r\narbitrament of lead and fire. No one had anything to gain by it, but\r\nafter a bout at fisticuffs a defeated child will sometimes pick up a\r\ndangerous stone and fling it. The League had accepted the challenge of\r\nthose who marched beneath the red banner for war on constitutional\r\nlines. Some of those who marched beneath the red banner were now\r\ndisposed to try the effect of beating their ploughshares into swords,\r\nand however much the League might have preferred them to keep to their\r\nbargain, the most effective retort was to turn their own pacific sickles\r\ninto bayonets.\r\n\r\nIn the staff room Salt was addressing his associates--half military,\r\nhalf political--who now represented the innermost Council of the League.\r\nSome of them had been members of former Ministries, others soldiers who\r\nhad worn the insignia of generals, but they rendered to this unknown man\r\namong them an unquestioning allegiance, because of what he had already\r\ndone, because he inspired them with absolute reliance in what he would\r\nyet succeed in doing, and, not least, because he had the air that fitted\r\nthe position.\r\n\r\n\"More than two years ago,\" he was saying, \"the first draft of the\r\nformation and operations of the League contained a section much to the\r\nfollowing effect:\r\n\r\n\"'It is an essential feature of the plan that the League should work on\r\nconstitutional lines from beginning to end and in contemplation of\r\nbringing about the desired reforms without firing a solitary shot or\r\nviolating a single law.\r\n\r\n\"'Nevertheless, it is inevitable that when the position becomes acute\r\ncivil disorders will arise out of the involved situation, and\r\ndemonstrations of the affected people will threaten the Government of\r\nthe day on the one hand and the proposed League on the other.\r\n\r\n\"'In these circumstances it will be prudent to contemplate, as a last\r\nphase of the struggle, an organised military attack on the property of\r\nthe League, masked under the form of a popular riot, but instigated or\r\nconnived at by responsible authorities. I propose, therefore, to\r\nestablish the League stores in a position naturally suited for defence,\r\nand to adopt such further precautions as will render them secure against\r\nordinary attack.'\r\n\r\n\"We have now reached that closing phase of the struggle,\" continued\r\nSalt. \"On the evidence of this report from Sir John Hampden we may\r\nassume that within twenty-four hours our aggressive work will be over.\r\nWill our opponents, in the language of the street, 'go quietly'?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has fallen to my lot to read the Riot Act on three occasions,\" said\r\none of the company, \"and I have seen disturbances in Ireland; but I have\r\nnever before known an unorganised mob to surround a position completely\r\nand then to sit down to wait for night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant Vivash wishes to speak to Mr Salt personally,\" said a\r\nsubordinate, appearing at the door.\r\n\r\nSalt stepped into the ante-room, and spoke through the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Vivash,\" he said to the man in the kite a quarter of a mile away.\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two general service wagons with bridge-making tackle have just been\r\nbrought up, and are waiting in Welland Wood,\" reported Vivash. \"There is\r\na movement among the colliers over Barfold Rise. With them are about two\r\nhundred men carrying rifles. They are not in uniform, but they _march_.\"\r\n\r\nSalt turned to another instrument and jerked the switch rapidly from\r\nplate to plate as he distributed his orders.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Norris, strengthen the Territorials at the outer wire North.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send up two star rockets to recall the motor-cycle scouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell Disturnal to have the searchlights in immediate readiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire brigade, full strength, turn out with chemical engine, and stand\r\nunder earthwork cover at central tank.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned again to the kite telephone to ask Vivash a detail. There was\r\nno response.\r\n\r\n\"Get on with Lieutenant Vivash as soon as you can, and let me know at\r\nonce,\" he said to the one who was in charge, as he returned to the staff\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIn less than a minute the operator was at the door again.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid there is something the matter, sir,\" he explained. \"I can\r\nget no reply either from Lieutenant Vivash or from the kite section.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ring up the despatch room. Let some one go at once to Mr Moore and\r\nreturn here with report.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" He turned to go. \"Here _is_ Mr Moore,\" he exclaimed,\r\nstanding aside from the door.\r\n\r\nThey all read some disaster in his face as he entered.\r\n\r\n\"I am deeply sorry to say that Lieutenant Vivash has been shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he seriously hurt?\" asked some one.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead. He was shot through the head by a marksman in Welland\r\nWood.\"\r\n\r\nSalt broke the shocked silence.\r\n\r\n\"We have lost a brave comrade,\" he said simply. \"Come, General Trench,\r\nlet us visit the walls.\"\r\n\r\nIt was dark when they returned. Salt passed through the room, calling to\r\nhis side the man with whom he had been most closely associated at\r\nHanwood, and traversing some passages led the way up a winding staircase\r\ninto the lantern of the tower. Here, under the direction of an\r\nex-officer of Royal Engineers, two powerful searchlights were playing on\r\nevery inch of doubtful ground that lay within their radius beyond the\r\nentanglement that marked the outer line of the defences.\r\n\r\nNothing had been seen; not a solitary invader had yet shown himself\r\nwithin the zone of light. The officer in charge was explaining a\r\ntechnical detail of the land when, without the faintest warning, a\r\nfulgent blaze of light suddenly ran along the edge of a coppice half a\r\nmile away, and a noise like the crackling of a hundred new-lit fires\r\ndrifted on the wind. With the echo, a thick hedge to the east and a wood\r\nlying on the west joined in the vicious challenge. A few bullets\r\nsplashed harmlessly against the steel shield that ingeniously protected\r\nthe lantern.\r\n\r\nThe searchlights oscillated uncertainly from sky to earth under the\r\nshock of the surprise, and then settled down to stream unwinkingly into\r\nthe eyes of the enemy, while in the double darkness the defenders hugged\r\nthe earth behind the wire and began to reply with cool deliberation to\r\nthe opening volleys.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock upon the door of the little lantern room, and a\r\ntelescribe message was placed before Salt. It bore a sign showing that\r\nit had come over the private system which the League maintained between\r\nHanwood and the head office. He read it through twice, and for almost\r\nthe first time since he had left his youth behind, he stood in absolute\r\nindecision.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary for me to go at once to London,\" he said, turning to\r\nhis companion, when he had made an irrevocable choice. \"You will take\r\ncommand in my absence, Evelyn, under the guidance of the Council.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I venture to remind you, sir, that we are completely surrounded?\"\r\nsaid Orr-Evelyn through his blank surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I have not overlooked it. You will----\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sullen roar away in the north, a mile behind the coppice\r\nthat had first spoken. Something whistled overhead, not unmelodiously,\r\nand away to the south a shell burst harmlessly among the ridges of a\r\nploughed field. The nearer searchlight elevated its angle a fraction and\r\ncentred upon a cloud of smoke that hung for a moment until the gale\r\nwhirled it to disintegration. The army, like the navy, had reverted to\r\nblack powder. It was Economy; and as it was not intended ever to go to\r\nwar again, it scarcely mattered.\r\n\r\n\"Marsham will engage that gun from both platforms D and E. Make every\r\neffort to silence it with the least delay; it is the only real menace\r\nthere is. Hold the entanglement, but not at too heavy a cost. If it\r\nshould be carried----Come to my room.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have considered the possible effect of your withdrawal at this\r\nmoment, Salt?\" said Orr-Evelyn in a low voice, as they hastened together\r\nalong the passages.\r\n\r\n\"I can leave the outcome in your hands with absolute reliance,\" replied\r\nSalt. \"If Hanwood is successfully held until to-morrow, it will devolve\r\nupon Sir John Hampden to dictate terms to the Government. The end is\r\nsafely in sight independent of my personality.... My reputation----!\" He\r\ndismissed that phase with a shrug.\r\n\r\nHe threw open the door of his private office. A shallow mahogany case,\r\nabout a foot square, locked and sealed, was sunk into the opposite wall.\r\nSalt knocked off the wax and opened the case with a key which he took\r\noff the ring and gave to Orr-Evelyn as he spoke. Inside the case were a\r\ndozen rows of little ivory studs, each engraved with a red number.\r\nFastened to the inside of the lid was a scale map of the land lying\r\nbetween the outer wall and the wire fence. Every stud had its\r\ncorresponding number, surrounded by a crimson circle, indicated on the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\"If the entanglement should be carried you will take no further risk,\"\r\ncontinued Salt. \"Captain Ford will give you the general indication of\r\nthe attack from the lantern. There are two men detailed to each block of\r\nmines who will signal you the exact moment for firing each mine. Those\r\nare the numbered indicators above the box. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused at the door; time was more than life to him, but he had an\r\nordered thought for everything.\r\n\r\n\"If you hear no more of me, and what might be imagined really troubles\r\nyou, Evelyn, you can make use of this,\" he remarked, and laid the\r\ntelescript he had received upon a table.\r\n\r\nIt was not the time for words, written or spoken, beyond those of the\r\nsheerest necessity. Half an hour passed before Orr-Evelyn had an\r\nopportunity of glancing through the letter that had called Salt from his\r\npost. When he had finished it he took it down, and read it aloud to the\r\nheadquarter staff amidst the profoundest silence, in passionate\r\nvindication of his friend and leader. This was what they heard:\r\n\r\n     \"UNITY LEAGUE, TRAFALGAR CHAMBERS.\r\n\r\n     \"The building is surrounded by mob. Seaton Street, Pantile\r\n     Passage, and Pall Mall and the Haymarket, as far as I can see,\r\n     densely packed with frantic men. All others in building had\r\n     left earlier. _I shall remain._ Wires cut, and fear that you\r\n     may not receive this, as other telescribe messages for help\r\n     unanswered. Mob howling continuously for Sir John Hampden and\r\n     Mr Salt; dare not look out again, stoned. Shall delay advance,\r\n     doors and stairs, as long as possible, and burn all important\r\n     League books and papers last resource.\r\n\r\n     \"Good-bye all, my dear friends.\r\n\r\n     \"IRENE LISLE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE \"FINIS\" MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm had not decreased its violence when, three minutes later, Salt\r\nstood unperceived on the broad coping outside an upper storey of the\r\ntower, and, sinking forward into the teeth of the gale, was borne\r\nupwards with rigid wings as a kite ascends.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his instructions the two searchlights had turned\r\ntheir beams steadily earthward for the time, and in the absolute\r\nblackness of the upper air he could pass over the firing lines of\r\nfriends and foes in comparative safety. As he rose higher and higher\r\nbefore turning to scud before the wind, he saw, as on a plan, the whole\r\nfield of operations, just distinguishable in its masses of grey and\r\nblack, with the points of interest revealing themselves by an occasional\r\nflash. Immediately beneath him, beneath him at first, but every second\r\ndrawing away to the south-west as he drifted in the gale he breasted,\r\nlay Hanwood, with its three outer lines of defence. From above it seemed\r\nas though a very bright needle was every now and then thrust out from\r\nthe walls into the dark night and drawn back again. On each of the\r\nplatforms D and E two 4.7-inch quick-firing guns appeared to be rocking\r\nslightly in the wind. By all the indication there was of smoke or noise,\r\nor even flame, the gunners might have been standing idly behind their\r\nshields; but over the steep scarp of the little hill, a mile and a half\r\naway, shells were being planted every ten yards or so, with the\r\nmethodical regularity of a farmer dropping potatoes along a furrow.\r\n\r\nSalt might not have quite expected that there would be the necessity to\r\nfire those guns when, a year before, he had obtained for Hanwood its\r\ncomplement of the finest artillery that the world produced, but when the\r\nnecessity did arise, there was no need for the League gunners to use\r\nblack powder.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached the height he required, simply leaning against the\r\nwind, Salt moved a pinion slightly and bore heavily towards the right.\r\nIt was the supreme moment for the trial of skill, as the long flight\r\nthat followed it was the trial of endurance. If his nerve had failed, if\r\na limb had lost its tension for the fraction of a second, his brain\r\nreeled amidst that tearing fury of the element, or a single ring or\r\nswivel not answered to its work, he would have been crumpled up\r\nhopelessly, beyond the chance of recovery, and flung headlong to the\r\nearth. As it was, the wind swept him round in a great half circle, but\r\nit was the wind his servant, not his master, and he turned its lusty\r\nviolence to serve his ends. He caught a passing glimpse of the coppice\r\nwhence the attack had first been opened; he saw beneath him the line of\r\nguns ensconced behind the hill, one already overturned and centred in\r\nconfusion; and then the sweeping arc reached its limit, and he came, as\r\nit seemed, to anchor in mid-air, with the earth slipping away beneath\r\nhim as the banks glide past a smoothly-moving train, and a thousand\r\nweights and forces dragging at his aching arms.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing to do but to maintain a perfect balance among the\r\nconflicting cross winds that shot in from above and below, and from\r\nnorth and south, and to point his course towards the glow in the sky\r\nthat marked the Capital. A dozen words could express it, but it required\r\nthe skill of the practised wingman, the highest development of every\r\nvirile quality, and the spur of a necessity not less than life and\r\ndeath, to dignify the attempt above the foolhardy. Whether beyond all\r\nthat the accomplishment lay within the bounds of human endurance was a\r\nfurther step. It would at that time have been impossible to pronounce\r\neither way with any authority, for not only had the attempt never been\r\nmade, but nothing approaching the attempt had been made. A breeze that\r\nran five miles an hour was considered enough for any purpose; to take to\r\nthe air when the anemometer indicated fifteen miles an hour was not\r\nallowed at the practice grounds, and the record in this direction lay\r\nwith an expert who had accomplished a straight flight in a wind that\r\ntravelled a little less than thirty miles an hour. The storm on the\r\nnight of the 15th of January tore across the face of the land with a\r\ngeneral velocity of fifty or sixty miles an hour, rising at times even\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nUnder the racking agony of every straining tendon and the heady pressure\r\nof the wind, a sense of mundane unreality began to settle upon the\r\nflier. He saw the earth and its landmarks being drawn smoothly and\r\nswiftly from beneath him with the detachment of a half-conscious dream.\r\nHe saw--for he remembered afterwards--the Thames lying before him like a\r\nwhip flicked carelessly across the plain. A town loomed up, black and\r\ninchoate, on his right, developed into streets and terraces, and slid\r\naway into the past. It was Richmond. The river, never far away, now\r\nslipped beneath him at right angles, reappeared to hold a parallel\r\ncourse upon his left, and flung a horse-shoe coil two miles ahead. A\r\ncolony of strange shining roofs and domes next challenged recognition.\r\nThey were the conservatories at Kew, looking little more than garden\r\nframes, and they were scarcely lost to view before he was over the\r\nwinding line of Brentford's quaint old High Street, now, as it appeared,\r\npacked with a dense, moving crowd. The irresistible pounding of the gale\r\nwas edging the glow of London further and further to his right.\r\nInstinctively he threw more weight into the lighter scale, and slowly\r\nand certainly the point of his destination swung round before his face\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThenceforward it was all town. Gunnersbury became Chiswick, Chiswick\r\nmerged into Hammersmith, Kensington succeeded, in ceaseless waves of\r\nhouses that ran north and south, and long vistas of roofs that stretched\r\neast and west. It was a kaleidoscope of contrasts. Scenes of saturnalian\r\ngaiety, where ant-like beings danced in mad abandonment round fires that\r\nblocked the road, or seemed to gyrate by companies in meaningless\r\nconfusion, bounded districts plunged into an unnatural gloom and\r\nsolitude, where for street after street neither the footstep of a\r\nwayfarer nor the light of a public lamp broke the uncanny spell.\r\nImmediately beyond, by the glare of the flambeaux which they carried, an\r\norderly concourse might be marching eastward, and fringing on their\r\nroute a garish gutter mart, where busy costermongers drove their roaring\r\ntrade and frugal housewives did their marketing with less outward\r\nconcern than if the crisis in the State had been a crisis in the price\r\nof butter.\r\n\r\nThe multitudinous sounds beat on his ears through the plunging gale like\r\na babel of revelry heard between the intermittent swinging of an\r\nunlatched door. The sights in their grotesque perspective began to melt\r\ntogether lazily. The upper air grew very cold. The weights hung heavier\r\nevery mile, the contending forces pulled more resistlessly. Strange\r\nfancies began to assail him as the brain shrank beneath the strain;\r\ndoubts and despairs to gather round like dark birds of the night with\r\nhopeless foreboding in the dull measure of their funereal wings. In that\r\nmoment mind and body almost failed to contend against the crushing odds;\r\nnothing but his unconquerable heart flogged on his dying limbs.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely more than half an hour after she had written her\r\ndespairing message that from her post at the head of the broad stone\r\nstaircase Irene Lisle heard a noise in the garret storey above that sent\r\nher flying back to her stronghold. It was the last point from which she\r\nhad expected an attack. Through the keyhole of the door behind which she\r\nhad taken refuge, she saw a strangely outlined figure groping his way\r\ncumbrously down the stairs, and then, without a word or cry, but with a\r\nface whiter than the paper that had summoned him, she threw open the\r\ndoor to admit Salt.\r\n\r\nHe walked heavily along the corridor and turned into his own room, while\r\nshe relocked the door and followed him. There was mute enquiry in her\r\neyes, but she did not speak.\r\n\r\nA powerful oil-stove stood upon the hearth-stone, throwing its beams\r\nacross the room. He stood over it while the beaded ice melted from his\r\nhair and fell hissing on the iron. He opened his mouth, and the sound of\r\nhis voice was like the thin piping of a reed. She caught a word, and\r\nbegan to unbuckle the frozen straps of his gear. When he was free he\r\ntried to raise his hand to a pocket of his coat, but the effort was\r\nbeyond the power of the cramped limb. Irene interpreted the action, and,\r\nfinding there a flask, filled the cup and held it to his lips.\r\n\r\nShe got a blue, half-frozen smile of thanks over the edge of the cup.\r\n\"Ah,\" he said, beginning to find his voice again, and stamping about the\r\nroom, \"we owe Wynchley Slocombe a monument, you and I, Miss Lisle. Now\r\nyou must write a telescript for me, please; for I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will remain here, where it is warmer, I will bring the\r\nmaterials,\" she suggested.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her and allowed her to go, watching her with thoughtful eyes\r\nthat were coming back to life. She paused a moment at the top of the\r\nstairs to listen down the shaft, and then sped quickly through the smoke\r\nto the instrument room on the floor beneath.\r\n\r\nSalt glanced round the office. On and about his desk all the books and\r\npapers that might be turned to a hostile purpose had been stacked in\r\nreadiness, and by them stood the can of oil that was to ensure their\r\ncomplete destruction. He stepped up to the window and looked out\r\ncautiously. Every pane of glass was broken--every pane of glass in\r\nTrafalgar Chambers was broken, for that matter--but it was not easy for\r\nan unprepared mob to force an entrance. When the Unity League had taken\r\nover the whole block of building in its expansion many alterations had\r\nbeen carried out, and among these had been to fix railings that sprang\r\nfrom the street and formed an arch, not only over the basement, but over\r\nthe ground floor windows also. If the shutters on the windows had been\r\nclosed in time, the assailants would have been baffled at another point,\r\nbut the shutters had been overlooked, and the mob, after lighting great\r\nfires in the street, was now flinging the blazing billets through the\r\nlower windows.\r\n\r\nIn a very brief minute Irene was back again with the telescribe\r\naccessories. She seated herself at a table, dipped her pen into the ink,\r\nand looked up without a word.\r\n\r\n     \"TRAFALGAR CHAMBERS.\r\n\r\n     \"6.25 P.M.,\" dictated Salt. \"Most of the miners drawn off and\r\n     passing through Brentford. Over Barfold Rise half battery of\r\n     18-pounders, one out of action. In Spring Coppice and Welland\r\n     Wood about four companies regulars each. Reconnoitre third\r\n     position assuming same proportion. Act.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood considering whether there was anything more to add usefully.\r\nThe sound of Irene's agate pen tapping persistently against the table\r\ncaught his ear.\r\n\r\n\"You are not very much afraid?\" he asked with kindly reassurance in his\r\nvoice as he looked at her hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, not now,\" she replied; but as she wrote she had to still the\r\nviolent trembling of her right hand with the left.\r\n\r\n     \"All going well here. Send messenger Hampden with report\r\n     immediately after engagement,\" he concluded.\r\n\r\n\"I will try to sign it myself.\" He succeeded in sprawling a recognisable\r\n\"George Salt\" across the paper, and after it wrote \"Finis,\" which\r\nhappened to be the pass-word for the day.\r\n\r\n\"Your message came through; this may possibly do the same,\" he remarked.\r\nHe turned off the radiator as orderly as though he had reached the close\r\nof a working day, and they went out together, locking the doors behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"They were attacking Hanwood when you left?\" she asked with the tensest\r\ninterest. They had sent off the telescript, and it seemed to Irene that\r\nthey had reached the end of things.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"But all the same,\" he added, as a fresh outburst of\r\ncries rose from the street, and the light through the shattered window\r\nattracted a renewed fusillade of missiles, \"I think that we have kept\r\nour promise to let you be in the thick of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with the very faintest smile. \"That seems a very long\r\ntime ago. But you, how could _you_ come? When I sent I never thought ...\r\nI never dreamed----\"\r\n\r\n\"It was possible to leave,\" he said. \"My work is done. Yes,\" in reply to\r\nher startled glance, \"it has all happened!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean----?\" she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nHe took a paper from his pocket-book. It was, as she saw immediately, a\r\ntelescript from Sir John Hampden. It had reached him at Hanwood an hour\r\nbefore he left.\r\n\r\n     \"I have this afternoon received a deputation of Ministerialists\r\n     who have the adherence of a majority in the House without\r\n     taking the Opposition into account,\" she read. \"The\r\n     Parliamentary Representation Committees throughout the country\r\n     are frantically insisting upon members accepting _any terms_,\r\n     if we will give an undertaking that the normal balance of trade\r\n     and labour shall be restored at once. The Cabinet is going to\r\n     pieces every hour, and the situation can no longer either be\r\n     faced or ignored by the Government. There will be a great scene\r\n     in the House to-night. The deputation will see me again\r\n     to-morrow morning with a formal decision. I have confidential\r\n     assurances that a complete acceptance is a foregone conclusion.\r\n     The arrival of the Midland colliers to-night, if not of those\r\n     from Monmouth, will precipitate matters.\"\r\n\r\nTears she could not hold back stood in her eyes as she returned to him\r\nthe paper. \"Then it has not been in vain,\" she said softly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied. \"Nothing has been in vain.\"\r\n\r\nThey stood silently for a minute, looking back over life. So might two\r\nshipwrecked passengers have stood on a frail raft waiting for the end,\r\nresigned but not unhopeful of a larger destiny beyond, while the\r\nelements boiled and roared around them.\r\n\r\n\"It was very weak of me to send that message,\" said Irene presently;\r\n\"the message that brought you. I suppose,\" she added, \"that it _was_ the\r\nmessage that brought you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank God!\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"And if it had been impossible for you to come? If it had been an\r\nutterly critical moment in every way, what would you have done?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed a little, quietly, as he looked at her. \"The question did not\r\narise, fortunately,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she admitted; \"only I felt a little curious to know, now that\r\neverything is over. It _is_, isn't it? There is nothing to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" he replied with indomitable cheerfulness. \"There is always\r\nsomething to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"A chance?\" she whispered incredulously. \"A chance of escape, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" he said. \"At least, I will go and hear what they have\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" she cried out, as a dreadful scene rose to her imagination.\r\n\"You cannot understand. Don't you hear that?... They would kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose that I shall find myself popular,\" he said with a\r\nsmile, \"but I will take care. You--I think you must stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannot I come with you?\" she pleaded. \"See, I am armed.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the tiny weapon that she drew from her dress and looked at it\r\nwith gentle amusement. It was a pretty thing of ivory and nickeled\r\nsteel, an elaborate toy. He pressed the action and shook out the\r\nhalf-dozen tiny loaded caps--they were little more than that--upon his\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather that you did not use this upon a mob,\" he said,\r\nreloading it. \"It would only exasperate, without disabling. As for\r\nstopping a rush--why, I doubt if one of these would stop a determined\r\nrabbit. You have better weapons than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are right. Only it gave me a little confidence. Then you\r\nshall keep it for a memento, if you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it might hold off a single assailant, I suppose. I should value\r\nthis much more, if I might have it.\" He touched a silk tie that she had\r\nabout her neck, as he spoke; it was one that she had often worn. She\r\nheld up her head for him to disengage it.\r\n\r\n\"Some day,\" he said, lingering a little over the simple operation, \"you\r\nwill understand many things, Irene.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I understand everything now,\" she replied with a brave\r\nglance. \"Everything that is worth understanding.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed the folded tie in an inner pocket, and went down the stone\r\nsteps without another word. The well was thick with smoke, but the fire\r\nhad not yet spread beyond the lower rooms. Half-way down he encountered\r\na barricade of light office furniture which the girl had flung across\r\nthe stairs and drenched with oil. It was no obstacle in itself, but at\r\nthe touch of a match it would have sprung into a conflagration that\r\nwould have held the wildest mob at bay for a few precious moments. He\r\npicked his way through it, descended the remaining stairs, and unlocked\r\nthe outer door. Beyond this was an iron curtain that had been lowered. A\r\nlittle door in it opened directly on to the half-dozen steps that led\r\ndown to Seaton Street.\r\n\r\nSalt looked through a crevice of the iron curtain, and listened long\r\nenough to learn that there was no one on the upper steps; for the upper\r\nsteps, indeed, commanded no view of the windows, and the windows were\r\nthe centres of all interest. Satisfied on this point, he quietly\r\nunlocked the door and stepped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSTOBALT OF SALAVEIRA\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the majority of those who thronged Seaton Street the effect of Salt's\r\nsudden--instantaneous, as it seemed--and unexpected appearance was to\r\nendow it with a dramatic, almost an uncanny, value. The front rows,\r\nespecially those standing about the steps, fell back, and the further\r\nrows pressed forward. And because an undisciplined mob stricken by acute\r\nsurprise must express its emotion outwardly--by silence if it has\r\nhitherto been noisy, and by exclamation if it has been silent--the\r\nshouts and turmoil in the street instantly dwindled away to nothing,\r\nlike a breath of vapour passing from a window pane.\r\n\r\nSalt raised his hand, and he had the tribute of unstirring silence, the\r\nsilence for the moment of blank astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"My friends and enemies,\" he said, in a voice that had learned\r\nself-possession from the same school that Demosthenes had practised in,\r\n\"you have been calling me for some time. In a few minutes I must listen\r\nto whatever you have to say, but first there is another matter that we\r\nmust arrange. I take it for granted that when you began your spirited\r\ndemonstration here you had no idea that there was a lady in the\r\nbuilding. Not being accustomed to the sterner side of politics, so\r\nformidable a display rather disconcerted her, and not knowing the\r\ninvariable chivalry of English working men, she hesitated to come out\r\nbefore. Now, as it is dark, and the streets of London are not what they\r\nonce were, I want half a dozen good stout fellows to see the lady safely\r\nto her home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be damned!\" growled a voice among the mass. \"What do you take us for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Men,\" retorted Salt incisively; \"or there would be no use in asking\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, men, but famished, desperate, werewolf men,\" cried a poor, gaunt\r\ncreature clad in grotesque rags, who stood near. \"Men who have seen\r\n_our_ women starve and sink before our eyes; men who have watched _our_\r\nchildren dying by a slower, crooler death than fire. An eye for an eye,\r\ntyrant! Your League has struck at _our_ women folk through us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then strike at ours through us!\" cried Salt, stilling with the measured\r\npassion of his voice the rising murmurs of assent. \"I am here to offer\r\nyou a substitute. Do you think that no woman will mourn for me?\" He sent\r\nhis voice ringing over their heads like a prophetic knell. \"The cause\r\nthat must stoop to take the life of a defenceless woman is lost for\r\never.\"\r\n\r\nAs long as he could offer them surprises he could hold the mere mob in\r\ncheck, but there was among the crowd an element that was not of the\r\ncrowd, a chosen sprinkling who were superior to the swaying passions of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\"Not good enough,\" said a decently-dressed, comfortable-looking man, who\r\nhad little that was famished, desperate, or wolfish in his appearance.\r\n\"You're both there, and there you shall both stay, by God! Eh,\r\ncomrades?\" He spoke decisively, and made a movement as though he would\r\nhead a rush towards the steps.\r\n\r\nSalt dropped one hand upon the iron door with a laugh that sounded more\r\nmenacing than most men's threats.\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast, Rorke,\" he said contemptuously; \"you grasp too much. Even\r\nin your unpleasant business you can practise moderation. I am here, but\r\nthere is no reason on earth why I should stay. Scarcely more than half\r\nan hour ago I was at Hanwood--where, by the way, your friends are being\r\nrather badly crumpled up--and you are all quite helpless to prevent me\r\ngoing again.\"\r\n\r\nThey guessed the means; they saw the unanswerable strength of his\r\nposition, and recognised their own impotence. \"Who are you, any way?\"\r\ncame a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\"I am called George Salt: possibly you have heard the name before. Come,\r\nmen,\" he cried impatiently, \"what have you to think twice about? Surely\r\nit is worth while to let a harmless girl escape to make certain of that\r\nterrible person Salt.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a strangled scream in the vestibule behind. Unable to bear the\r\nsuspense any longer, Irene had crept down the stairs in time to hear the\r\nlast few sentences. For a minute she had stood transfixed at the horror\r\nof the position she realised; then, half-frenzied, she flung herself\r\nagainst Salt's arm and tried to beat her way past to face the mob.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not!\" she cried distractedly. \"I will not be saved at that\r\nprice. I shall throw myself out of the window, into the fire, anywhere.\r\nYes, I'm desperate, but I know what I am saying. Come back, and let us\r\nwait together; die together, if it is to be, but I don't go alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd began to surge restlessly about in waves of excited motion.\r\nThe interruption, in effect, had been the worst thing that could have\r\nhappened. There were in the throng many who beneath their seething\r\npassion could appreciate the nobility of Salt's self-sacrifice; many who\r\nin the midst of their sullen enmity were wrung with admiration for\r\nIrene's heroic spirit, but the contagion to press forward dominated all.\r\nSalt had irretrievably lost his hold upon their reason, and with that\r\nhold he saw the last straw of his most forlorn hope floating away. In\r\nanother minute he must either retreat into the burning building where he\r\nmight at any time find the stairs impassable with smoke, or remain to be\r\noverwhelmed by a savage rush and beaten to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Men,\" cried Irene desperately, \"listen before you do something that\r\nwill for ever make to-day shameful in the history of our country. Do you\r\nknow whom you wish to kill? He is the greatest Englishman----\"\r\n\r\nThere were angry cries from firebrands scattered here and there among\r\nthe crowd, and a movement from behind, where the new contingents\r\nhurrying down the side streets pressed most heavily, flung the nearest\r\nrows upon the lower steps. Salt's revolver, which he had not shown\r\nbefore, drove them back again and gave him a moment's grace.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" he cried. \"My offer still holds good.\"\r\n\r\nOne man shouldered his way through to the front, and, seeing him, Salt\r\nallowed him to come on. He walked up the steps deliberately, with a face\r\nsad rather than revengeful, and they spoke together hurriedly under the\r\nshadow of the large-bore revolver.\r\n\r\n\"If it can be done yet, I'll be one of the posse to see to the young\r\nlady,\" said the volunteer. \"I have no mind to wait for the other job\r\nthat's coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care of her; get her back into the hall,\" replied Salt. \"Gently,\r\nvery gently, friend.\"\r\n\r\nTwo more volunteers had their feet upon the steps, one, a butcher,\r\nreeking of the stalls, the other sleek and smug-faced, with the\r\nappearance of a prosperous artisan.\r\n\r\n\"I'll pick my men,\" cried Salt sharply, and his steady weapon emphasised\r\nhis choice, one man passing on through the iron doorway, the other\r\nturning sharp from the insistent barrel to push his way back into the\r\ncrowd with a bitter imprecation.\r\n\r\nIt was too much to hope that the position could be maintained. The\r\nimpatient mob had only been held off momentarily from its purpose as a\r\npack of wolves can be stayed by the fleeing traveller who throws from\r\nhis sleigh article after article to entice their curiosity. Salt had\r\nnothing more to offer them. His life was already a hostage to the honour\r\nof those whom he had allowed to pass. Others were pressing on to him\r\nwith vengeance-laden cries. The terrible irresistible forward surge of a\r\nsoulless mob, when individuality is merged into the dull brutishness of\r\na trampling herd, was launched.\r\n\r\n\"Capt'n Stobalt!\" cried a lusty voice at his shoulder.\r\n\r\nSalt turned instinctively. A man in sailor's dress, with the guns and\r\nstar of his grade upon his sleeve, had climbed along the arch of the\r\nrailings with a sailor's resourcefulness, and had reached his ear. Salt\r\nremembered him quite well, but he did not speak a word.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir, I thought that warn't no other voice in the world, although\r\nthe smoke befogged my eyes a bit. Keep back, you gutter rats!\" he roared\r\nabove every other sound, rising up in his commanding position and\r\nbalancing himself by a stanchion of the gate; \"d'ye think you know who\r\nyou're standing up before, you toggle-chested galley-sharks! Salt? Aye,\r\nhe's _salt_ enough! 'Tis Capt'n Stobalt of the old _Ulysses_.\r\n_Stobalt of Salaveira!_\"\r\n\r\nThree years before, the moment would have found Salt cold, as cold as\r\nice, and as unresponsive, but he had learned many things since then, and\r\nsacrificed his pride and reticence on many altars.\r\n\r\nHe saw before him a phalanx of humanity startled into one common\r\nexpression of awe and incredulity; he saw the hostile wave that was to\r\noverwhelm him spend itself in a sharp recoil. By a miracle the fierce\r\nlust of triumphant savagery had died out of the starved, pathetic faces\r\nnow turned eagerly to him; by a miracle the gathering roar for vengeance\r\nhad sunk into an expectant hush, broken by nothing but the whispered\r\nrepetition of his name on ten thousand lips. He saw in a flash a hundred\r\ndetails of the magic of that name; he knew that if ever in his life he\r\nmust throw restraint and moderation to the winds and paint his role in\r\nbroad and lurid colours, that moment had arrived, and at the call he\r\ntook his destiny between his hands.\r\n\r\nThey saw him toss his weapon through the railings into the space\r\nbeneath, marked him come to the edge of the step and stand with folded\r\narms defenceless there before them, and the very whispers died away in\r\nbreathless anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he cried with a passionate vehemence that held their breath and\r\nstirred their hearts, \"I am Stobalt of Salaveira, the man who brought\r\nyou victory when you were trembling in despair. I saved England for you\r\nthen, but that was when men loved their country, and did not think it a\r\ndisgraceful thing to draw a sword and die for her. What is that to you\r\nto-day, you who have been taught to forget what glory means; and what is\r\nEngland to you to-day, you whose leaders have sold her splendour for a\r\nhigher wage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! No!\" cried a thousand voices, frantic to appease the man for whose\r\nblood they had been howling scarcely a minute before. \"You shall be our\r\nleader! We will follow you to death! Stobalt of Salaveira! Stobalt for\r\never! Stobalt of Salaveira! Stobalt and England!\"\r\n\r\nThe frenzied roar of welcome, the waving hands, the hats flung high, the\r\nmingled cries caught from lip to lip went rolling up the street,\r\nkindling by a name and an imperishable memory other streets and other\r\ncrowds into a tumult of mad enthusiasm. Along Pall Mall, through\r\nTrafalgar Square, into the Strand and Whitehall, north by Regent Street\r\nand the Haymarket to Piccadilly, running east and west, splitting north\r\nand south, twisting and leaping from group to group and mouth to mouth,\r\nran the strange but stirring cry, carrying wonder and concern on its\r\nwing, but always passing with a cheer.\r\n\r\nSeven years had passed since the day of Salaveira, and the memory of it\r\nwas still enough to stir a crowd to madness. For there had been no\r\nSalaveiras since to dim its splendour. Seven years ago the name of\r\nSalaveira had brought pallor to the cheek, and the thought of what was\r\nhappening there stole like an icy cramp round the heart of every\r\nEnglishman. The nation had grown accustomed to accept defeat on land\r\nwith the comfortable assurance that nothing could avert a final victory.\r\nIts pride was in its navy: invincible!...\r\n\r\nThe war that came had been of no one's seeking, but it came, and the\r\nnation called upon its navy to sweep the presumptuous enemy from off the\r\nseas. Then came a pause: a rumour, doubted, disbelieved, but growing\r\nstronger every hour. The English fleets, not so well placed as they\r\nmight have been, \"owing to political reasons that made mobilisation\r\ninadvisable while there was still a chance of peace being maintained,\"\r\nwere unable to effect a junction immediately, and were falling back\r\nbefore the united power of the New Alliance. Hour after hour, day after\r\nday, night after night, crowds stood hopefully, doubtfully,\r\nincredulously, in front of the newspaper office windows, waiting for the\r\nnews that never came. The fleets had not yet combined. The truth first\r\nleaked, then blazed: they were unable to combine! Desperately placed on\r\nthe outer line they were falling back, ever falling back into a more\r\nappalling isolation. A coaling station had been abandoned just where its\r\npresence proved to have been vital; a few battleships had been dropped\r\nfrom the programme, and the loss of their weight in the chain just\r\nproved fatal.\r\n\r\nMen did not linger much at Fleet Street windows then; they slunk to and\r\nfro singly a hundred times a day, read behind the empty bulletins with\r\npoignant intuition, and turned silently away. In the mourning Capital\r\nthey led nightmare lives from which they could only awake to a more\r\ndefinite despair, and the first word of the hurrying newsboy's raucous\r\nshout sent a sickening wave of dread to every heart. There was\r\neverything to fear, and nothing at all to hope. Could peace be made--not\r\na glorious, but a decent, living peace? Was--was even London safe? Kind\r\nfriends abroad threw back the answers in the fewest, crudest words.\r\nEngland would have to sue for peace on bended knees and bringing heavy\r\ntribute in her hands. London lay helpless at the mercy of the foe to\r\nseize at any moment when it suited him.\r\n\r\nAll this time Commander Stobalt, in command of the _Ulysses_ by the\r\nvicissitudes of unexpected war and separated from his squadron on\r\ndetached service, was supposed to be in Cura Bay, a thousand miles away\r\nfrom Salaveira, flung there with the destroyers _Limpet_ and _Dabfish_\r\nby the mere backwash of the triumphant allied fleet. According to the\r\nrules of naval warfare he _ought_ to have been a thousand miles away;\r\naccording to the report of the allies' scouts he _was_ a thousand miles\r\naway. But miraculously one foggy night the _Ulysses_ loomed spectrally\r\nthrough the shifting mist that drifted uncertainly from off the land and\r\nrammed the first leviathan that crossed her path, while the two\r\ndestroyers torpedoed her next neighbour. Then, before leviathans 3 and 4\r\nhad begun to learn from each other what the matter was, the _Ulysses_\r\nwas between them, sprinkling their decks and tops with small shell, and\r\nperforating their water-line and vital parts with large shell from a\r\nrange closer than that at which any engagement had been fought out since\r\nthe day when the Treasury had begun to implore the Admiralty to impress\r\nupon her admirals what a battleship really cost before they sent her\r\ninto action. For the _Ulysses_ had everything to gain and nothing but\r\nherself to lose, and when morning broke over Salaveira's untidy bay, she\r\nhad gained everything, and lost so little that even the New Alliance\r\ntook no pride in mentioning it in the cross account.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, as every naval expert could have demonstrated on the\r\nwar-game board, an impossible thing to do. Steam, searchlights, wireless\r\ntelegraphy, quick-firing guns, and a hundred other innovations had\r\neffaced the man; and the spirit of the Elizabethan age was at a\r\ndiscount. What Drake would have done, or Hawkins, what would have been a\r\nsweet and pleasing adventure to Sir Richard Grenville, or another Santa\r\nCruz to Blake, would have been in their heirs unmitigated suicide by the\r\nverdict of any orthodox court martial. Largely imbued with the\r\nElizabethan spirit--the genius of ensuring everything that was possible,\r\nand then throwing into the scale a splendid belief in much that seemed\r\nimpossible--Stobalt succeeded in doing what perhaps no one else would\r\nhave succeeded in doing, merely because perhaps no one else would have\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n\"Stobalt of Salaveira! Come down and lead us!\" The wild enthusiasm, the\r\nstrange unusual cries, went echoing to the sky and reverberating down\r\nevery street and byway. Behind barred doors men listened to the shout,\r\nand wondered; crouching in alleys, tramping the road with no further\r\nhope in life, beggars and out-casts heard the name and dimly associated\r\nit with something pleasant in the past. It met the force of special\r\nconstables hastening from the west; it fell on the ears of Mr Strummery,\r\ndriving by unfrequented ways towards the House. \"Stobalt and England!\r\nStobalt for us! Stobalt and the Navy!\" It was like another Salaveira\r\nnight with Stobalt there among them--the man who was too modest to be\r\nfeted, the man whose very features were unknown at home, Stobalt of\r\nSalaveira!\r\n\r\nImagine it. Measure by the fading but not yet quite forgotten memory of\r\nanother time of direful humiliation and despair what Salaveira must have\r\nbeen. They had passed a week of fervent exaltation, a week of calm\r\nassurance, a week of rather tremulous hope, and for the last quarter a\r\nlong dumb misery that conveyed no other sense of time in later years\r\nthan that of formless night. They were waiting for the stroke of doom.\r\nThen at midnight came the sudden tumult from afar, sounding to those who\r\nlistened in painful silence strangely unlike the note of defeat, the\r\nfrantic, mingled shouts, the tearing feet in the road beneath, the wild\r\nbells pealing out, the guns and rockets to add to the delirium of the\r\nnight, and the incredible burden of the intoxicating news: \"Great\r\nVictory! Salaveira Relieved!! Utter Annihilation of the Blockading\r\nFleet!!!\"\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher might withdraw to solitude and moralise; the Friend of\r\nHumanity stand aside, pained that his countrymen should possess so much\r\nhuman nature, but to the great primitive emotional heart of the\r\ncommunity the choice lay between going out and shouting and staying in\r\nand going mad. Never before in history had there been a victory that so\r\nirresistibly carried the nation off its feet. To the populace it had\r\nseemed from beginning to end to contain just those qualities of\r\ndaredevilry and fortuitous ease that appeal to the imagination. They\r\nwere quite mistaken; the conception had been desperate, but beyond that\r\nthe details of the relief of Salaveira had been as methodical, as\r\npainstaking, and as far-seeing as those which had marked the civil\r\ncampaign now drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nThat was why a famished, starving mob remembered Salaveira. They would\r\nhave stoned a duke or burned a bishop with very little compunction, but\r\nStobalt ranked among their immortals. They did not even seem to question\r\nthe mystery of Salt's identity. As the flames began to lap out of the\r\nlower windows of Trafalgar Chambers, and it became evident that their\r\nwork there was done, a stalwart bodyguard ranged themselves about his\r\nperson and headed the procession. Hurriedly committing Irene to the\r\nloyal sailor's charge, Stobalt resigned himself good-humouredly to his\r\nposition until he could seize an opportunity discreetly to withdraw.\r\n\r\nNot without some form of orderliness the great concourse marched into\r\nthe broader streets. Stobalt had no idea of their destination; possibly\r\nthere was no preconcerted plan, but--as such things happen--a single\r\nvoice raised in a pause gave the note. It did not fall on barren ground,\r\nand the next minute the countless trampling feet moved to a brisker\r\nstep, and the new cry went rolling ominously ahead to add another terror\r\nto the shadowy phantasmagoria of the ill-lit streets.\r\n\r\n\"To Westminster! Down with the Government! To Westminster!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE BARGAIN OF FAMINE\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Hampden had not to wait until the morning to meet the\r\ndeputation of Ministerialists again. Late the same evening a few men,\r\narriving together, presented themselves at one of the barricades that\r\nclosed the Mayfair street, and were at once admitted. Many of the\r\nresidential west-end districts which were not thoroughfares for general\r\ntraffic were stockaded in those days and maintained their street guard.\r\nThe local officials protested, the inhabitants replied by instancing a\r\nfew of the cases where an emergency had found the authorities powerless\r\nto extend protection, and there the matter ended. It was scarcely worth\r\nwhile stamping out a spark when they stood upon a volcano.\r\n\r\nSir John received the members in the library--a disspirited handful of\r\nmen who had written their chapter of history and were now compelled to\r\npass on the book to other scribes, as every party must. Only this party\r\nhad thought that it was to be the exception.\r\n\r\n\"Events are moving faster than the clock,\" apologised Cecil Brown, with\r\na rather dreary smile. He was present as the representative of that body\r\nin the House which was not indisposed to be courteous and even\r\nconciliatory in attitude towards an opponent, while it yielded nothing\r\nof its principles: a standpoint unintelligible to most of the rank and\r\nfile of the party. \"Doubtless we are not unexpected, Sir John Hampden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Comrade,\" corrected a member who was made of sterner metal. They were\r\nthere to deliver up their rifles, but this stalwart soldier of Equality\r\nclung tenaciously to an empty cartridge case.\r\n\r\n\"I am no less desirous than yourselves of coming to a settlement,\"\r\nreplied Sir John. \"If there is still any matter of detail----?\"\r\n\r\nThe plenipotentiaries exchanged glances of some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Have you not heard?\" asked Mr Soans, whose voice was the voice of the\r\ndockyard labourers.\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely say until I know what you refer to,\" was the plausible\r\nreply. \"I have found that all communication has been cut during the last\r\nfew hours.\" He lightly indicated the instruments against the wall.\r\n\r\nThey all looked towards Cecil Brown, the matter being rather an\r\nunpleasant one.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, the House has been invaded by a tumultuous rabble. They\r\novercame all resistance by the mere force of numbers, and\"--he could not\r\nthink of a less ominous phrase at the moment--\"well, simply turned us\r\nout.... Quite Cromwellian proceedings. We left them passing very large\r\nand comprehensive resolutions,\" he concluded.\r\n\r\n\"Your people!\" said the uncompromising man accusingly.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely,\" protested Hampden with a smile. \"The ends may be the ends of\r\nEsau, but the means----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not our people; they couldn't possibly be ours to come and turn on us\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we say, without defining them further,\" said Sir John, \"that\r\nthey were simply\"--he paused for a second to burn the thrust gently home\r\nwith a little caustic silence--\"simply The People.\"\r\n\r\nMr Vossit made a gesture of impatience towards his colleague.\r\n\r\n\"Whether Queen Anne, died of gout or apoplexy isn't very material now,\"\r\nhe said with a touch of bitterness. \"We are here to conduct the\r\nfuneral.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to meet you in every possible way I can,\" interposed Hampden,\r\n\"but I must point out to you that at so short a notice I am deprived of\r\nthe counsel of any of my associates. I had hoped that by the time of the\r\nmeeting to-morrow morning----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that necessary if the Memorandum is accepted by the Government?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without discussion?\"\r\n\r\nMr Vossit shrugged his shoulders. \"As far as I am concerned, Sir John.\r\nThe concession of a word or two, or a phrase here and there, can make no\r\ndifference. It is our Sedan, and the heavier you make the terms, the\r\nmore there will be for us to remember it by.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am content,\" subscribed Mr Guppling. \"We have been surprised and\r\nrouted, not by the legitimate tactics of party strife, but by methods\r\nundistinguishable from those of civil war.\"\r\n\r\nHampden's glance was raised mechanically to an inscribed panel that hung\r\nupon the wall in easy view, where it formed a curious decoration. The\r\nground colour was dull black, and on it in white lettering was set forth\r\na trenchant sentiment selected from the public utterances of every\r\nprominent member of the Government and labelled with his name. It was a\r\nvindication and a spur that he had kept before his eyes through the\r\nyears of ceaseless preparation, for in each extract one word was picked\r\nout in the startling contrast of an almost blinding crimson, and that\r\none word was WAR. Even Sir John's enemies, those who called Salt a\r\nmachine of blood and iron, admitted him to be a kindly gentleman, and\r\nhis glance had been involuntary, for he had no desire to emphasise\r\ndefeat upon the vanquished. The thing was done, however, and following\r\nthe look every man who sat there met his own flamboyant challenge from\r\nthe past; for all, without exception, had thrown down the gauntlet once\r\nin no uncertain form. War--but that had meant them waging war against\r\nanother when it was quite convenient for them to do so, not another\r\nwaging war against themselves out of season. War--but certainly not war\r\nthat turned them out of office, only war that turned their opponents out\r\nof office.\r\n\r\nThe rather strained silence was broken by the sound of footsteps\r\napproaching from the hall.\r\n\r\n\"We are still short of the Home Secretary and Comrade Tirrel,\" explained\r\nMr Chadwing to the master of the house. \"We divided forces. They were\r\ndriving I understand. Perhaps----\"\r\n\r\nIt was. They came in slowly, for the Home Secretary faltered in his gait\r\nand had a hunted look, while Tirrel led him by the arm. Both carried\r\ntraces of disorder, even of conflict.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; they held us up,\" said Tirrel with a savage laugh, as his\r\ncolleagues gathered round. \"He was recognised in Piccadilly by a crowd\r\nof those ungrateful dogs from the pits. I shouted to the cabman to drive\r\nthrough them at a gallop, but the cur jumped off his seat howling that\r\nhe was their friend. I was just able to get the reins; we bumped a bit,\r\nbut didn't upset, fortunately. I left the cab at the corner of the\r\nstreet, here.\" He turned his back on the Home Secretary, who sat huddled\r\nin a chair, and, facing the others, made a quick gesture indicating that\r\nMr Tubes was unwell and had better be left alone.\r\n\r\n\"I brought him here, Sir John,\" he said, crossing over to the baronet\r\nand speaking in a half-whisper, \"because I really did not know where\r\nelse to take him. For some reason he appears to be almost execrated just\r\nnow. His house in Kilburn will be marked and watched, I am afraid. And\r\nin that respect I daresay we are all in the same boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"He appears to be ill,\" said Hampden, rising. \"I will----\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't,\" interrupted Tirrel decisively. \"Any kind of attention\r\ndistresses him, I find. It is a collapse. He has been shaken for some\r\ntime past, and the attack to-night was the climax. His nerve is\r\ncompletely gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as his safety is concerned,\" suggested the host with an\r\nexpression of compassion, \"I think that we can ensure that here against\r\nany irregular force. And certainly it would be the last place in which\r\nthey would think of looking for him. For the night, at least, you had\r\nbetter leave him in our charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Tirrel; \"it is very good of you. I will. Of course,\"\r\nhe added, as he turned away, \"we shall have to assume his acquiescence\r\nto any arrangement we may reach. Unofficially I can guarantee it.\"\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves round the large table, Sir John and his private\r\nsecretary occupying one end, the plenipotentiaries ranging around the\r\nother three sides. As they took their places Mr Drugget and another\r\nmember were announced. They did not appear to have been expected, but\r\nthey found seats among their colleagues. The Home Secretary sat apart,\r\ncowering in an easy-chair, and stretching out his hands timorously from\r\ntime to time to meet the radiant heat of the great oil stove.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the meeting was not quite the same as that of the\r\ndeputation which had paved the way to it earlier in the day. It was more\r\nofficial, for the action of the deputation had forced the hand of the\r\nCabinet--to the relief of the majority of that body, it was whispered.\r\nBut there was one notable Minister absent.\r\n\r\n\"I represent the Premier,\" announced Mr Drugget, rising. \"If his\r\nattendance in person can be dispensed with, he begged to be excused.\"\r\n\r\n\"I offer no objection,\" replied Hampden. \"If in the exceptional\r\ncircumstances the Prime Minister should desire to see me privately, I\r\nwill meet him elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Premier is indisposed, I regret to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I would wait upon him at his own house, should he desire\r\nit,\" proffered Sir John.\r\n\r\n\"I will convey to him your offer,\" replied Mr Drugget. \"In the meantime\r\nI am authorised to subscribe Mr Strummery's acquiescence to the terms,\r\nsubject to one modification.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word first, please,\" interposed Sir John. \"I must repeat what I had\r\nalready said before you arrived. I am unable just now to consult my\r\ncolleagues, in concert with whom the Memorandum was drafted. If it is\r\nnecessary to refer back on any important detail----\"\r\n\r\nMr Tubes half rose from his chair with a pitiable look of terror in his\r\neyes and gave a low cry as a turbulent murmur from some distant street\r\nreached his ears.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, comrade,\" said Cecil Brown reassuringly. \"You're safe\r\nenough here, Jim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye,\" whispered Tubes fearfully; \"but did you hear that\r\nshout?--'To the lamp-post!' They fling it at me from every crowd. It\r\nhaunts me. That is what I--I--yes, that is what I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"No good arguing,\" muttered Tirrel across the table. \"Leave him to\r\nhimself; there's nothing else to be done just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can at least express the Premier's views\" resumed Mr Drugget. \"He\r\nwould prefer the Bill for Amending the Franchise to be brought forward\r\nas a private Bill by a member of the Opposition rather than make it a\r\nGovernment measure. The Government would grant special facilities, and\r\nnot oppose it. The Premier would advise a dissolution immediately the\r\nBill passed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the library door. The secretary attended to it with\r\neasy discretion, and for a minute was engaged in conversation with some\r\none beyond.\r\n\r\nSir John looked at Mr Drugget in some amazement, and most of the members\r\nof his own party regarded their leader's proxy with blank surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I was hardly prepared for so fundamental an objection being raised at\r\nthis hour,\" said the baronet. \"It amounts, of course, to bringing an\r\nalternative proposal forward.\"\r\n\r\n\"The result would be the same; I submit that it is scarcely more than a\r\nmatter of detail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why press it?\"\r\n\r\nMr Drugget's expression seemed to convey the suggestion that he had no\r\npersonal wishes at all in the matter, but felt obliged to make the best\r\ncase he could for his chief.\r\n\r\n\"The Premier not unnaturally desires that the real authors of so\r\nretrogressive and tyrannical an Act should be saddled with the nominal\r\nas well as the actual responsibility,\" he replied. \"Possibly he fears\r\nthat in some remote future the circumstances will be forgotten, and his\r\nname be handed down as that of a traitor.\"\r\n\r\nThe private secretary took the opportunity of the sympathetic murmur\r\nwhich this attitude evoked to exchange a sentence with Sir John. Then he\r\nturned to the door and beckoned to the man who stood outside.\r\n\r\n\"I must ask your indulgence towards a short interruption, gentlemen,\"\r\nsaid Hampden, as a cyclist, in grey uniform, entered and handed him a\r\ndespatch. \"It is possible that some of my friends may even now be on\r\ntheir way to join me.\"\r\n\r\nThey all regarded the messenger with a momentary curious interest; all\r\nexcept two among them. Over Mr Drugget and the comrade who had arrived\r\nwith him the incident seemed to exercise an absorbing fascination. After\r\na single, it almost seemed a startled, glance at the soldier-cyclist,\r\ntheir eyes met in a mutual impulse, and then instantly turned again to\r\nfix on Hampden's face half-stealthily, but as tensely as though they\r\nwould tear the secret from behind his unemotional expression.\r\n\r\n\"It's all very well, Drugget--in justice,\" anxiously murmured Mr Vossit\r\nacross the table, \"but, as things are, we've got to be quick, and accept\r\nconsiderably less than justice. For Heaven's sake, don't prolong the\r\nagony, after to-day's experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you hang on to that,\" warned Mr Guppling, \"you will only end in\r\nputting off till to-morrow not a whit better terms than you can make\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,\" muttered Mr Drugget impatiently, not\r\nwithdrawing his fascinated gaze.\r\n\r\nIn the silence of the room they again heard the crescive ululation of\r\nthe street, distant still, but sounding louder than before to their\r\nstrained imagination, and terrible in its suggestion of overwhelming,\r\nunappeasable menace. Mr Tubes started uneasily in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Will _that_ wait?\" demanded Mr Guppling with some passion.\r\n\r\n\"A very little time longer; your coming here to-night has thrown us\r\nout,\" pleaded Mr Drugget's companion, in a more conciliatory whisper.\r\n\"To-morrow morning, a few hours, an hour--perhaps even----\"\r\n\r\nThe messenger had been dismissed without an answer. Looking up with\r\nsudden directness, Hampden caught one man's eyes fixed on him with a\r\nfurtive intensity that betrayed his hopes and fears.\r\n\r\n\"The attack on Hanwood has completely failed,\" quietly announced Sir\r\nJohn, holding the startled gaze relentlessly. \"The guns have been\r\ncaptured and brought in. The troops have been surrounded, disarmed, and\r\ndispersed, with the exception of those of the higher rank who are\r\ndetained. There have, unfortunately, been casualties on both sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--I--Why do you address yourself to me, Sir John?\" stammered the\r\ndisconcerted man, turning very white, and exhibiting every painful sign\r\nof guilt and apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to understand that your property at Hanwood has been attacked by\r\nan armed force of regulars?\" asked one with sincere incredulity, as\r\nHampden remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"It is unhappily true.\"\r\n\r\n\"And defended by an evidently superior force of armed men, unlawfully\r\nassembled there,\" retorted a militant comrade defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"In view of the strained position to which the circumstances must give\r\nrise, I will take the responsibility of withdrawing the Premier's one\r\nobjection to the Memorandum as it stands,\" announced Mr Drugget with dry\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"In that case I will ask Mr Lloyd to read the terms of the agreement\r\nformally before we append our signatures,\" said Hampden, without\r\noffering any further comment.\r\n\r\nA printed copy of the Articles was passed to each delegate; on the table\r\nbefore Sir John lay the engrossed form in duplicate. From one of these\r\nthe secretary proceeded to read the terms of the agreement, which was\r\nfrankly recognised on both sides as the death-warrant of socialistic\r\nascendency in England.\r\n\r\nFrom the Government the League required only one thing: the immediate\r\npassing of \"A Bill to amend the Qualifications of Voters in\r\nParliamentary Elections,\" to be followed by a dissolution and its\r\ninevitable consequence, a general election. But of the result of that\r\nelection no one need cherish any illusions, for it would be decided\r\naccording to the new qualification; and shorn of its parliamentary\r\nphraseology, the new Act was to sweep away the existing adult suffrage,\r\nand, broadly, substitute for it a L10 occupation qualification, with,\r\nstill worse, a plurality of voting power in multiples of L10, according\r\nto the rateable value of the premises occupied. It was wholly immoral\r\naccording to the democratic tendency of the preceding age, but it was\r\nwholly necessary according to the situation which had resulted from it.\r\n\r\nA genial Autocrat, Professor, and Poet has set forth in one of his\r\nworks, for the sake of the warning it conveys, the story of a little boy\r\nwho, on coming into the possession of a nice silver watch, and examining\r\nit closely, discovered among the works \"a confounded little _hair_\r\nentangled round the balance-wheel.\" Of course his first care was to\r\nremove this palpable obstruction, with the result that the watch\r\naccomplished the work of twenty-four hours in an insignificant fraction\r\nof a second, and then refused to have anything more to do with practical\r\nchronometry. On coming into possession of their new toy the Socialists\r\nhad discovered many \"confounded little _hairs_\" wrapped away among the\r\nworks of that elaborate piece of machinery, the English Constitution,\r\nall obviously impeding its free working. Recklessly, even gaily, they\r\nhad pulled them out one after another, cut them across the middle and\r\nleft pieces hanging if they could not find the ends, dragged out lengths\r\nanyhow. For a time the effect had been dazzlingly pyro-technical when\r\nseen from below. The Constitution had gone very, very, very fast; it had\r\ncovered centuries in a few years; and as it went it got faster. But\r\nunfortunately it had stopped suddenly. And every one saw that while it\r\nremained in the hands of its nominal masters it would never go again.\r\n\r\nHad the times been less critical some other means of effecting the same\r\nend might have been found. But although it was scarcely more than\r\nwhispered yet, for four hours England had been involved in actual,\r\ndeadly, civil war; and water once spilled is hard to gather up. Under\r\nordinary circumstances the expedient of disenfranchising a party would\r\nhave proved unpopular even with the bitterest among that party's\r\nenemies. As it was, it was simply accepted as the necessary\r\ncounterstroke to their own policy of aggression.\r\n\r\n\"If the 'most business-like Government of modern times' can instance a\r\nsingle business where eleven shareholders to the amount of a sovereign\r\napiece can come in and outvote ten shareholders who have each a stake of\r\na thousand pounds in the concern, and then proceed to wreck it,\" was a\r\nremark typical of the view people took, \"then--why, then the record of\r\nthe Government will lose its distinction as an absolutely unique blend\r\nof fatuous imbecility and ramping injustice, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nSo there was to be a general election very soon in which the issue would\r\nlie between the League party and the shattered, shipwrecked\r\nAdministration that had no leaders, no coherence, and scarcely a name to\r\nrally to. It was estimated that Labour of one complexion or another\r\nmight hold between thirty and forty seats, if the working classes cared\r\nto support representatives after the Payment of Members Act had been\r\nrepealed. It was computed that in more than four hundred constituencies\r\nLeague candidates would be returned unopposed. There could be no denying\r\nthat our countrymen of 1918 (_circa_) lived through an interesting\r\nperiod of their country's history. The League party would go to the poll\r\nwith no pledges, and their policy for the present was summed up in the\r\nsingle phrase, \"As in 1905.\" It was to be the cleanest of slates.\r\n\r\n\"How soon can the Bill become law under the most expeditious handling?\"\r\nHampden had asked of those who formed the earlier deputation, and the\r\nanswer had been, \"Three days!\" Solely from the \"business\" point of view\r\nit was magnificent, and it was certainly convenient as matters stood. In\r\nthree more days a general election could be in full swing, waged, in the\r\nemergency, on the existing register supplemented by the books of the\r\nlocal authorities and the voters' receipts for rates or taxes. In a\r\nsingle day it could be over. Within a week England would have\r\nexperienced a change in her affairs as far-reaching as the Conquest or\r\nthe Restoration.\r\n\r\nMr Lloyd, to return to Sir John Hampden's library, read the first\r\narticle to the breathless assembly. It had been tacitly agreed that the\r\ntime had come when the conditions must be accepted without discussion;\r\nbut when the fateful clause was finished a deep groan, not in empty\r\nhostile demonstration, but irresistibly torn from the unfeigned depths\r\nof their emotion, escaped many of the Ministers. Boabdil el Chico's\r\nsigh, when he reached the point where the towers and minarets of Granada\r\nwere lost to him for ever, was not more sincere or heart-racked. Even\r\nSir John could not have claimed that he felt unmoved.\r\n\r\nThe secretary read on. The League entered into certain undertakings. It\r\nguaranteed that the normal conditions of the home coal trade should be\r\nrestored, and the men called back to the pits by an immediate order for\r\nten million tons. Temporary relief work of various kinds would be\r\ninstituted at once to meet the distress. The Unemployed Grant would be\r\nreopened for nine weeks to carry over the winter; for three weeks fully,\r\nfor three weeks at the rate of two-thirds, and for the last period\r\nreduced to one-third. The colliers in London would be carried back to\r\ntheir own districts as fast as the railways could get out the trains.\r\n\r\nThere were many other points of detail, and they all had a common\r\naim--the obliteration of the immediate past and the restoration of that\r\npublic confidence which in a country possessing natural resources is the\r\nfoundation stone of national prosperity. Already there were facts for\r\nthe present and portents for the future. Men of influence and position,\r\nwho had been driven out of England by the terrible atmosphere of\r\npolitical squalor cast over an Empire by a Government that had learned\r\nto think municipally, were even now beginning to return; and that most\r\nresponsive seismograph which faithfully reflected every change in the\r\nworld's condition for good or ill predicted better times. In other\r\nwords, consols had risen in three months from 54-1/2 to 68 and the bulk\r\nof the buying was said to be for investment.\r\n\r\n\"If it is not trenching on the forbidden ground, I should like to ask\r\nfor an assurance on one point,\" said a member with a dash of acrimony.\r\nThe secretary had finished his task, and then for perhaps ten seconds\r\nthey had sat in silence, speculating half unconsciously upon the future,\r\nas each dimly saw it, that lay beyond the momentous step they were about\r\nto take. \"I refer to the question of coal export. It is, of course, a\r\nmore important outlet than the domestic home consumption. Is the League\r\nin a position to guarantee that the taxation will be rescinded without\r\ndelay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be a very unwarrantable presumption for us to assume\r\nthat any one outside the governments of the countries interested\r\npossesses that influence, and that it would be a very undesirable, a\r\nvery undiplomatic, proceeding to hint at the possibility of any such\r\nconcession in the document I have before me,\" replied Sir John suavely.\r\n\"Beyond that, I would add that it will be manifestly to the interest of\r\nthe next government to restore the bulk of foreign trade to a normal\r\nlevel; and that should the League party find itself in office, it will\r\ncertainly make representations through the usual channels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite like old times,\" said Mr Soans dryly. \"I suppose that we shall\r\nhave to be content with that. Let us hope that it will prove a true\r\nsaying that those who hide can find.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a pen as he finished speaking, signed the paper that had\r\nbeen passed to him first by reason of his position at the table, and\r\nthrust it vehemently from him to his neighbour. Mr Chadwing held up his\r\npen to the light to make sure that it contained no obstruction on so\r\nimportant an occasion, signed his name with clerkly precision, and then\r\ncarefully wiped his pen on the lining of his coat. Cecil Brown looked\r\ndown with the faint smile that covered his saddest moments as he added\r\nthe slender strokes of his signature, and Tirrel dashed off the\r\nink-laden characters of his with tightened lips and a sombre frown.\r\nConsciously or unconsciously every man betrayed some touch of character\r\nin that act. Mr Vossit made a wry grimace as he passed the paper on; and\r\nMr Guppling, with an eye on a possible line in Fame's calendar, snapped\r\nhis traitorous pen in two and cast the pieces dramatically to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhen the last signature had been written, some of the members stood up\r\nto take their leave at once, but Hampden and Tirrel made a simultaneous\r\nmotion to detain them. The master of the house gave way to his guest.\r\n\r\n\"I am not up to cry over spilled milk,\" said Tirrel with his customary\r\nbluntness. \"What is done, is done. We shall carry out the terms, Sir\r\nJohn Hampden, and you and your party will be in office in a week. But\r\nyou are not merely taking over the administration of a constitution: you\r\nare taking over a defeated country. I ask you, as the head of your party\r\nand the future Premier, to do one thing, and I ask it entirely on my own\r\ninitiative, and without the suggestion or even the knowledge of my\r\nfriends or colleagues. Let your first act be to publish a general\r\namnesty. It does not touch me.... But there have been things on both\r\nsides. You may perhaps know my views; I would have crushed your League\r\nby strong means when it was possible if I had had my way. None the less,\r\nthere is not the most shadowy charge that could hang over me to-day, and\r\nfor that reason it is permissible for me to put in this petition. The\r\nnation is shattered, torn, helpless. Do not look too closely into the\r\npast ... pacify.\"\r\n\r\n\"The question has not arisen between my associates and myself, but I do\r\nnot imagine that we should hold conflicting views, and I may say that\r\nfor my part I enter cordially into the spirit of the suggestion,\"\r\nreplied Hampden frankly. \"Anything irregular that could come within the\r\nmeaning of political action in its widest sense I should be favourable\r\ntowards making the object of a general pardon.... While we are together,\r\nI will go a step further, and on this point I have the expressed\r\nagreement of my friends. You, sir, have assumed without any reserve that\r\nour party will be returned to office. I accept that assumption. You have\r\nalso compared our work to the pacification of a conquered nation. That\r\nalso may be largely admitted. We shall be less a political party\r\nreturned to power by the even chances of a keenly-fought election, and\r\nchecked by an alert opposition, than a social autocracy imposing our\r\nwishes--as we believe for the public good--on the country. For twenty\r\nyears, as I forecast the future, there will be no effective opposition.\r\nYet a great deal of our work will have reference to the class whom the\r\nopposition would represent, the class upon whose wise and statesmanlike\r\npacification the tranquillity, and largely the prosperity, of the\r\ncountry, will depend.\"\r\n\r\nSome few began to catch the drift of Hampden's meaning, and those who\r\ndid all glanced instinctively towards Cecil Brown.\r\n\r\n\"You have used, and I have accepted, the comparison of a conquered\r\nnation,\" continued Sir John. \"When a country has been forcibly occupied\r\nthe work of pacification is one of the first taken in hand by a prudent\r\nconqueror. There is usually a Board or Committee of Conciliation, and in\r\nthat body are to be found some of the foremost of those who resisted\r\ninvasion while resistance seemed availing.... It would be analogous to\r\nthat, in my opinion, if a supporter of the present Government was\r\noffered and accepted a position in the next. There would be no\r\nsuggestion--there would be no possibility--of his being in accord with\r\nthe Cabinet in its general policy. He would be there as an expert to\r\nrender service to both parties in the work of healing the scars of\r\nconflict. If the proposal appears to be exceptional and the position\r\nuntenable at first sight, it is only because the prosaic parliamentary\r\nmachinery of normal times has by a miracle been preserved into times\r\nthat are abnormal.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an infection of low laughter, amused, sardonic, some\r\ngood-natured and a little ill-natured, and a few cries of \"Cecil Brown!\"\r\nin a subdued key.\r\n\r\n\"The moment seemed a favourable one for laying the proposal before the\r\nmembers of the Government,\" went on Hampden, unmoved, \"though, of\r\ncourse, I do not expect an answer now. On the assumption that we are\r\nreturned to power, it is our intention to create a new department to\r\nexist as long as the conditions require it, and certainly as long as the\r\nnext Parliament. Its work will be largely conciliation, and it will deal\r\nwith the disorganisation of labour. In the same confidential spirit with\r\nwhich you have spoken of the future without reserve, I may say that\r\nshould I be called upon to form a Ministry, I shall--and I have the\r\ndefinite acquiescence of my colleagues--offer the Presidentship of the\r\nBoard to Mr Cecil Brown ... the office of Parliamentary Secretary to Mr\r\nTirrel.\"\r\n\r\nIf Hampden had wished to surprise, he certainly succeeded. The open\r\nlaugh that greeted the first name was cut off as suddenly and completely\r\nas the light is cut off when the gas-tap is turned, by the gasp that the\r\nsecond name evoked. To many among them the offer had been the merest\r\nparty move; Cecil Brown's name a foregone conclusion. The addition of\r\nTirrel, whose rather brilliant qualities and quite fantastic sense of\r\nhonour they were prone to lose sight of behind his vehement\r\nbattle-front, was stupefying.\r\n\r\nIt was Tirrel who was the first to break the silence of astonishment on\r\nthis occasion, not even waiting, with characteristic impetuousness, for\r\nhis chief-designate to offer an opinion.\r\n\r\n\"You say that you do not want an answer now, Sir John, but you may have\r\nit, as far as I am concerned,\" he cried, with the defiant air that\r\nmarked his controversial passages. \"From any other man of your party the\r\nproposal would have been an insult; from you it is an amiable mistake.\r\n_You_ do not think that you can buy us with the bribe of office, but you\r\nthink that there is no further party work for us to do: that Socialism\r\nin England to-day is dead. I tell you, Sir John Hampden, with the\r\nabsolute conviction of an inspired truth, that it will triumph yet. You\r\nwill not see it; I may not see it, but it is more likely that the hand\r\nof Time itself should fail than that the ideals to which we cling should\r\ncease to draw men on. We, who are the earliest pioneers of that\r\nuntrodden path, have made many mistakes; we are paying for them now; but\r\nwe have learned. Some of our mistakes have brought want and suffering to\r\nthousands of your class, but for hundreds of years your mistakes have\r\nbeen bringing starvation and misery to millions of our class. From your\r\npresence we go down again into the weary years of bondage, to work\r\nsilently and unmarked among those depths of human misery from which our\r\ncharter springs. I warn you, Sir John Hampden--for I know that the\r\nwarning will be dead and forgotten before the year is out--that our\r\nreign will come again; and when the star of a new and purified Socialism\r\narises once more on a prepared and receptive world the very forces of\r\nnature would not be strong enough to arrest its triumphant course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear! hear!\" said Mr Vossit perfunctorily, as he looked round\r\nsolicitously for his hat. \"Well, I suppose we may as well be going.\"\r\n\r\nCecil Brown recalled his wistful smile from the contemplation of a\r\nfuture chequered with many scenes of light and shade.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, Sir John,\" he replied with a look of friendly\r\nunderstanding, \"but I also must go down with my own party.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that the decision in neither case will be irrevocable,\" said\r\nHampden with regret, but as he spoke he knew that the hope was vain.\r\n\r\nThey had already begun to file out of the room, with a touch here and\r\nthere of that air of constraint that the party had never been quite able\r\nto shake off on ceremonial occasions. They left Mr Tubes cowering before\r\nthe stove, and raising his head nervously from time to time to listen to\r\nthe noises of the street.\r\n\r\nMr Guppling, determined that his claims should not escape the eye of\r\nFame, paused at the door.\r\n\r\n\"When we leave this room, John Hampden,\" he proclaimed in a loud and\r\nimpressive voice, and throwing out his hand with an appropriate gesture,\r\n\"we leave Liberty behind us, bound, gagged, and helpless, on the floor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Mr Guppling,\" replied Sir John good-humouredly. \"We will\r\ndevote our first efforts to releasing her.\"\r\n\r\nMr Guppling smiled a bitter, cutting smile, and left the shaft to\r\nrankle. It was not until he was out in the street that a sense of the\r\npossible ambiguity of his unfortunate remark overwhelmed him with\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\"POOR ENGLAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the account of the signing of the dissolution terms, and a brief\r\nreference to the sweeping victory of the League party--already\r\nforeshadowed, indeed, to the point of the inevitable--the unknown\r\nchronicler, whose version of the Social War this narrative has followed,\r\nbrings his annals to a close. That war being finished, and by the\r\nrepudiation of their Socialistic mentors on the part of a large section\r\nof the working classes, finished by more than a mere paper treaty, the\r\nworthy scribe announces with praiseworthy restraint that there is no\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\n\"These men,\" he declares, in the quaint and archaic language of the\r\npast,--and he might surely have added \"these women\" also--\"came not\r\nreluctantly, but in no wise ambitiously, out of the business of their\r\nown private lives to serve their country as they deemed; and that being\r\naccomplished to a successful end, would have returned, nothing loth, to\r\nmore obscure affairs, having sought no personal gain beyond that which\r\ngrew from public security, an equitable burden of citizenship, and a\r\nrecovered pride among the nations. Albeit some must needs remain to\r\ncarry on the work.\"\r\n\r\nEven the not unimportant detail of who remained to carry on the work,\r\nand in what capacities, is not recorded, but the distribution of rewards\r\nand penalties, on the lines of strict poetic justice, may be safely left\r\nto the individual reader's sympathies, with the definite assurance that\r\neverything happened exactly as he would have it. At the length of three\r\ntimes as much space as would have sufficed to dispose of these points\r\nonce and for all, this superexact historian goes on to set out his\r\nreasons for not doing so. He claims, in short, that his object was to\r\nportray the course of the social war, not to recount the adventures of\r\nmere individuals; and with the suggestion of a wink between his pen and\r\npaper that may raise a doubt whether he, on his side, might not be\r\nendowed with the power of casting a critical eye upon other periods than\r\nhis own, he indulges in a little pleasantry at the expense of writers\r\nwho, under the pretext of developing their hero's character, begin with\r\nhis parent's childhood, and continue to the time of his grandchildren's\r\nyouth. For himself, he asserts that nothing apart from the course of the\r\nsocial war, its rise and progress, has been allowed to intrude, and that\r\nended, and their work accomplished, its champions are rather heroically\r\ntreated, very much as the Arabian magician's army was disposed of until\r\nit was required again, and to all intents and purposes turned into stone\r\njust where they stood.\r\n\r\nBut from other sources it is possible to glean a little here and there\r\nof the course of subsequent events. To this patchwork record the\r\n_Minneapolis Journal_ contributes a cartoon laden with the American\r\nsatirist's invariable wealth of detail.\r\n\r\nA very emaciated John Bull, stretched on his bed, is just struggling\r\nback to consciousness and life. On a table by his side stands a bottle\r\nlabelled \"Hampden's U. L. Mixture,\" to which he owes recovery. On the\r\nwalls one sees various maps which depict a remarkably Little England\r\nindeed. Some sagacious economist, in search of a strip of canvas with\r\nwhich to hold together a broken model of a black man, has torn off the\r\ngreater part of South Africa for the purpose. Over India a spider has\r\nbeen left to spin a web so that scarcely any of the Empire is now to be\r\nseen. Upper Egypt is lost behind a squab of ink which an irresponsible\r\nurchin has mischievously taken the opportunity to fling. Every colony\r\nand possession shows signs of some ill-usage.\r\n\r\n\"Say, John,\" \"Uncle Sam,\" who has looked in, is represented as saying,\r\n\"you've had a bad touch of the 'sleeping sickness.' You'd better take\r\nthings easy for a spell to recuperate. I'll keep an eye on your house\r\nwhile you go to the seashore.\"\r\n\r\nThat was to be England's proud destiny for the next few years--to take\r\nthings easy and recuperate! There is nothing else for the pale and\r\nshaken convalescent to do; but the man who has delighted in his strength\r\nfeels his heart and soul rebel against the necessity. Fortunate for\r\nEngland that she had good friends in that direful hour. The United\r\nStates, sinking those small rivalries over which cousins may strive even\r\nnoisily at times in amiable contention, stretched a hand across the\r\nwaters and astonished Europe by the message, \"Who strikes England\r\nwantonly, strikes me\": a sentiment driven home by the diplomatic hint\r\nthat for the time being the Monroe Doctrine was suspended west of Suez.\r\n\r\nFrance--France who had been so chivalrously true to her own ally in that\r\nstricken giant's day of incredible humiliation--looked across The Sleeve\r\nwith troubled, anxious eyes, and whispered words of sympathy and hope.\r\nGently, very tactfully, she offered friendship with both hands, without\r\na tinge of the patronage or protection that she could extend; and by the\r\nliving example of her own tempestuous past and gallant recovery from\r\nevery blow, pointed the way to power and self-respect.\r\n\r\nJapan, whose treaty had been thrown unceremoniously back to her many\r\nyears before, now drew near again with the cheerful smile that is so\r\nmild in peace, so terrible in war. Prefacing that her own enviable\r\nposition was entirely due to the enlightened virtues of her emperor, she\r\nnow proposed another compact on broad and generous lines, by which\r\nEngland--a \"high contracting Power,\" as she was still magnanimously\r\ndescribed--was spared the most fruitful cause for anxiety in the East.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't mind allying with us when you were at the head of the\r\nnations,\" said Japan. \"We come to you--now. Besides, all very good\r\nbusiness for us in the end. You build up again all right, no time.\"\r\n\r\nJapan's authority to speak on the subject of \"building up\" was not to be\r\ndisputed. The nations had forgotten the time, scarcely a quarter of a\r\ncentury before, when they had been amused by \"Little Japan's\"\r\nprogressive ambitions. And when Japan had taken over the \"awakening\"\r\narrangements of a sister-nation on terms that gave her fifty million\r\npotential warriors to draw upon and train (warriors whom one of\r\nEngland's most revered generals had characterised as \"Easily led; easily\r\nfed; fearless of death\"), non-amusement in some quarters gave way to\r\npositive trepidation.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic nations spoke together, and agreed that something must\r\nbe done to give \"Poor England\" another chance; as, in the world of\r\ncommerce, friendly rivals will often gather round the man who has fallen\r\non evil days to set him on his feet again.\r\n\r\nSo England was to have a fair field and liberty to work out her own\r\nsalvation. But she was not to wake up and find that it had all been a\r\nhideous dream. Egypt had been put back to the time of the Khalifa. India\r\nhad lost sixty years of pacification and progress. Ireland was a\r\nrepublic, at least in name, and depending largely on Commemoration\r\nIssues of postage stamps for a revenue. South Africa was for the South\r\nAfricans. There were many other interesting items, but these were, as it\r\nmight be expressed to a nation of shopkeepers, the leading lines.\r\n\r\nIf the worst abroad was bad enough, there was one encouraging feature at\r\nhome. With the election of the new government industries began to\r\nrevive, trade to improve, the money market to throw off its depression,\r\nand the natural demand for labour to increase: not gradually, but\r\ninstantly, phenomenally. It was as though a dam across some great river\r\nhad been removed, and with the impetus every sluggish little tributary\r\nwas quickened and drawn on in new and sparkling animation. It was not\r\nnecessary to argue upon it from a party point of view; it was a concrete\r\nfact that every one admitted. There was only one explanation, and it met\r\nthe eye at every turn. Capital reappeared, and money began to circulate\r\nfreely again. Why? There was security.\r\n\r\nIt was not the Millennium; it was the year 19--, and a \"capitalistic\"\r\ngovernment was in office; but the \"masses\" discovered that they were\r\ncertainly not worse off than before. Working men now wore, it is true, a\r\nlittle less of the air of being so many presidents of South American\r\nrepublics when they walked about the streets; but that style had never\r\nreally suited them, and they soon got out of it. The men who had come\r\ninto power were not of the class who oppress. The strife of the past was\r\nbeing forgotten; its lessons were remembered. What was good and\r\npractical of Socialistic legislation was retained. So it came about that\r\nthe vanquished gained more by defeat than they would have done by\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nIt was undeniable that, in common with mankind at large, they still from\r\ntime to time experienced pain, sickness, disappointment, hardship, and\r\ngeneral adversity. Those who were employed by gentlemen were treated as\r\ngentlemen treat their work-people; those who were so unfortunate as to\r\nbe in the service of employers who had no claim to that title continued\r\nto be treated as cads and despots treat their employes. Those among them\r\nwho were gentlemen themselves extended a courteous spirit towards their\r\nmasters, and those among them who were the reverse continued to act\r\ntowards employers and the world around as churls and blusterers act, and\r\nso the compensating balance of nature was more or less harmoniously\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the future? Will the nation that was so sharply taught dread\r\nthe fire like the burned child, or return to the flame as the scorched\r\nmoth does? Alas, the memory of a people is short, even as the wisdom of\r\na proverb is conflictingly two-edged.\r\n\r\nOr, if the warning fades and the necessity grows large again, will there\r\nbe found another Stobalt to respond to the call? \"For those whom Heaven\r\nafflicts there is a chance,\" contributes the Sage of another land; \"but\r\nthey who persistently work out their own undoing are indeed hopeless.\"\r\n\r\nOr may it be that the faith of Tirrel will be justified, and that in the\r\nprocess of time there will emerge from man's ceaseless groping after\r\nperfection a new wisdom, under whose yet undreamt-of scheme and\r\ndispensation all men will be content and reconciled?\r\n\r\nThe philosopher shakes his head weightily and remains silent--thereby\r\nadding to his reputation. The prophets prophesy; the old men dream\r\ndreams and the young men see visions, and the dispassionate speculate.\r\nOn all sides there is a multitude of the counsel in which, as we must\r\nbelieve, lies wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting situation, and as it can only be definitely settled\r\nbeyond the dim vista of future centuries, the pity is that we shall\r\nnever know.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNELSON LIBRARY\r\n\r\n_UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME._\r\n\r\n\r\n            1.
