By no means, Mr. _Overall_; I look upon the Freedom with\r\nwhich my worthy Neighbours here treat me, as an Instance of their\r\nFriendship and Regard.\r\n\r\n_Roseband_. There spoke the Christian and Man of sound Understanding——\r\n\r\n_Over_. Pshaw! P—x! What have we Fox-hunters to do with sound\r\nUnderstandings?——Give me a sound Bottom, Parson, and you are welcome to\r\nkeep your Christianity and sound Understanding for your next _Christmas_\r\nConversation. Ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Right, Mr. _Overall_; I say a sound Bottom too.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Come, Gentlemen, let the Toast go round.——To all sound\r\nBottoms—No Affront, I hope, to any one here.——What say’st thou, honest\r\n_Blunt_?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I say, the Vicar need not make those d——d wry Faces at Toasting\r\nthe best Thing in Nature.——You have been paying Homage for twenty Years\r\nto a _Broadbottom_, and now winch at the naming a _Sound_ one.——Ah! Mr.\r\n_Roseband_; the _Jesuit_ sticks to the Cloth in _England_ as at _Rome_.\r\n\r\n_Smoothwell_. Why so, Mr. _Blunt_? The Words _Sound Bottom_ convey an\r\nIdea which Mr. _Roseband_ might wish not to conceive.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. And pray, good Mr. _Smoothwell_, what is there of indecent or\r\nunseemly in the Idea conceived at the mention of those two harmless\r\nWords, _Sound_ and _Bottom_?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Wou’d a reverend Divine wish to be put in Mind of the Days of\r\nhis Youth? Ha, ha!—— Mr. _Blunt_, had you been bred at _Oxford_, as the\r\nDoctor was, you wou’d have known that all are not _Sound_ that grace\r\n_Magdalen_ Walks on a Summer’s Evening. Ha, ha!\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Mr. _Roseband_, you must not mind the Fox-hunter; you know\r\nhis Way; he treats his Friends as freely as he wishes they would treat\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. I believe so, Sir _John_, and therefore am in full Charity with\r\nMr. _Overall_. But I can’t so readily digest my Neighbour _Blunt_’s\r\ncoupling the _English_ Vicar with the _Romish_ Jesuit.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. In their Politics only; as for Religion, I leave that to the\r\ngreat Searcher of Hearts.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Ah, dear _Blunt_! how many modern Hearts will bear a Search?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Ask Mr. _Broadbottom_; he was last at Court.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. I was so, Mr. _Blunt_, but you know I am but a late Comer\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Perhaps it had been as well for yourself and your Country, if\r\nyou had not come there at all.—— You’ll excuse my Bluntness, Mr.\r\n_Broadbottom_, you know I speak freely to those I wish well.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. I know your Worth, and thank you for your Freedom.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I hope you do, because I mean to continue and deserve your\r\nFriendship, if you continue your Country’s Friend at Court.——To be plain\r\nwith you, Mr. _Broadbottom_, I am not altogether reconciled to the\r\ncritical _Time_ and _Manner_ of your going to Court. ’tis an infectious\r\nAir, against which _Abstinence_ alone is the Specific.\r\n\r\n_Over_. ’Sflesh! _Blunt_, you don’t expect your late worthy Member, who\r\nso often cram’d your Brother Aldermen and yourself with Ham and Chicken,\r\nwould keep Lent at Court?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Let him but abstain from entering into any Covenants, and he\r\nmay swill as much as he will of his Majesty’s Old-Hock.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Covenants! What Covenants do you suppose, should be expected\r\nfrom me?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. The direct contrary of those you entered into with our\r\nCorporation at your last Election.——Perhaps, you forget them.——Shall I\r\nrefresh your Memory?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. You need not. I am come down to make you fresh Assurances of\r\nserving my Country to the utmost of my Power.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I know you are come down to be re-elected; and that this\r\nCompany have been invited here to-day, to receive your Excuses for your\r\nlate Acceptance of an Employment.—\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Mr. _Blunt_, your Corporation could not expect that their\r\nRepresentative would never accept of a Place under the Crown; therefore\r\nwhat Excuses has the Gentleman to make?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. More, I fear, than you can make for him with all your Quirks of\r\nLaw. If he accepted of a Post without any Salvo, and forgets that he has\r\na Post whenever he is to vote in Parliament, I will then say that he\r\nneeds not make Excuses for going to Court.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Ay, Mr. _Blunt_, provided my worthy Neighbour,\r\n_Broadbottom_, turns not a mere _Courtier_, by going to Court, he shall\r\nhave all our Consents to stay at Court and rise there.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. A Man may rise in the Army and Navy, and meritoriously; but\r\nwhat dirty Work must a Man trudge thro’ to rise at Court?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Why should a Man be obliged to do more servile Work at Court\r\nthan in the Church, where we see the Learned and Pious rise, and are\r\ntranslated every Day?——I expect my good Friend here, Mr. _Roseband_, to\r\nrise to a Deanery soon, now his Patron has taken a Stride to Court.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. And shou’d Mr. _Broadbottom_ rise at Court, as I doubt not\r\nhe will if he continues there longer than the present Session of\r\nParliament; why might not my reverend Neighbour here, rise from the\r\nDeanery to a Mitre?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Sir _John_, you have been always my Friend; so have you Mr.\r\n_Blunt_. Gentlemen, you are all of you my Friends, and as such—have a\r\nRight to examine my late Conduct. I have accepted of a Place, ’tis true,\r\nwithout consulting you; but hope in so doing, not to have forfeited the\r\ngood Opinion which I flatter myself you always entertain’d of me.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Since we are, and you think us your Friends, ’tis fit we\r\nshould deal with you like Friends. To be plain with you, Mr.\r\n_Broadbottom_, we here in the Country, who wish well to our King and the\r\nNation, think ourselves justify’d in conceiving a Jealousy of the\r\nNature, Time and Manner of the late or rather the present Change in the\r\nMinistry. I will explain myself.—— ’tis not so properly a _Change_ of,\r\nas an _Ingraftment_ upon the Ministry. Supposing the few of your Party\r\nthat are brought _in_, were to continue as honest and sincere, as those\r\n_Deserters_, who made room for them, were disingenuous and\r\nself-interested; what can you do against Numbers? What Success can poor\r\n_England_ expect from the Endeavours of so few?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. But, Sir _John_, you forget that the Opposition grew.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. No, Sir, I don’t forget that Opposition founded on virtuous\r\nPrinciples will always grow. But what _Opposition_ can you expect to\r\ngrow in a Court? You late Comers there are but the Tail of the\r\nAdministration. Can you direct the Head and Body? Must it not move as\r\nthey direct, or be lopt off? What will Opposition in Council avail,\r\nwhere the Majority will be so great against you? And as for Opposition\r\nin P——t, there will be none, there can be none. The late _Deserters_,\r\nwho are now flung out, should they grumble and oppose, no Creature\r\nliving will adhere to them that has a Drachm of either Sense or Virtue.\r\nAnd by the present Scheme, you who were late Leaders of Opposition, are\r\ntaken off, and consequently all Opposition ceases. I wish I may be\r\nmistaken; but, methinks, I see a Scheme, and the artfullest and deepest\r\nthat ever was laid in this Nation, now put in Execution.\r\n\r\n_Over_. How, Sir _John_! a Scheme deeper than the _Excise_?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Or last Year’s _Invasion_, which produced such Chearfulness in\r\ngranting more Millions than ever were granted in any one Session before?\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Or the late Sir _R——t_’s Scheme for securing his own Retreat?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Retreat! Do you think it a Retreat for a Man to quit the Stage\r\nto go behind the Curtain, where he sets all the Puppets in Motion?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. He does so; and this is not the least Adroit of his Motions.\r\nAll the present Ministry, the late small _Engraftment_ excepted, are his\r\nknown Creatures. They were most of them of his own bringing up, and of\r\ncourse act by his Directions.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. But, Sir _John_, how shall we be affected by his Motions? I\r\nhope you don’t suppose he will be able to influence us New comers, as\r\nyou call us, however he may direct his Pupils.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I hope he won’t; but I’ll answer for it, he does not now\r\nmatter whether he can or no. He has lull’d you into a Stupor, and having\r\nunperceptibly depriv’d you of your Sting, you are no longer the terrible\r\nMen you appeared to the Court some time ago.\r\n\r\n_Over_. They are now become the _Drones_ of the Hive; ha, ha!\r\n\r\nSir _John_. They are really no better. Pardon me, Mr. _Broadbottom_, if\r\nI think the Epithet fits all you who are brought in to countenance\r\nMeasures the Nation disapproves of——\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. To colour an ignominious Peace, which is thought to be on the\r\nAnvil, because the late Conduct of our Superiors renders a Peace of any\r\nkind absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n_Over_. And to be kick’d out again as soon as those dirty Ends are\r\nanswered, which they were introduc’d to promote: Gad, Brother Foxhunter,\r\nI should not care to be _rump’d_ after I had said _yea_ and _nay_ as\r\ndirected. You see what End the late Patriot _Pretenders_ are come to. ——\r\nZ—ns Man! fall not, like those Coxcombs, ’tween two Stools.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. There lies the Depth of the present Scheme, which is but the\r\nsecond Part of the late. The late _Deserters_, as they are justly\r\ncall’d, saw not that they were digging Pits for themselves, while they\r\nwere bargaining to drop their Party for Places at Court. What better, Mr\r\n_Broadbottom_, have you been lately doing for yourself? If you answer\r\nthe _Purpose_ of your being taken into the Ministry, supposing it\r\ndisagreeable to the Nation, you are irrecoverably lost in the Opinion of\r\nall who esteem’d you before; and of consequence will be no better than a\r\nDrone all your Life long.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Pray, Sir _John_, why will you suppose the _Purpose_ of the\r\nMinistry to be disagreeable to the Nation?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Because I have known in my Time but very few, if any\r\nMinisterial _Purposes_ that deserv’d public Approbation.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. You would not have us be against the Continuance of the War,\r\ntill an honourable Peace can be obtain’d?\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Nor against the Support of the War while it continues.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Nor against such a Peace, as the Success of the War may intitle\r\nus to.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. So! the Lessons are already put by Heart.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Why not? you forget how apt Lawyers and Divines are to learn.\r\nHa, ha!\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. And Patriots too, when once they creep within the Palace Gates.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Mr. _Blunt_, I am well acquainted with the Uprightness of your\r\nHeart. You love me, and therefore fear I am to be deluded from my Duty\r\nto my Country by the Allurements of a Post. But let me intreat my\r\nFriends to suppress their Fears till the End of the Session.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I should not wonder by the End of the present Session, or at\r\nleast before the Beginning of the next, to see you and your Brethren\r\nreduced to your primitive Nakedness. Of what Use can you be, after you\r\ngrant all the Court wants, and reject or throw cold Water on every\r\nMotion for the Benefit of the Nation?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Motion for the Benefit of the Nation, said you! Who will\r\nmake such a Motion? Or if made, who will support it? Neighbour _Blunt_,\r\nI don’t wonder that you, who never sat in Parliament, should mistake the\r\nNature of _Motions_ made there; but I, who represented your Borough in\r\nmy younger Days, am able from my Experience to inform you, that no\r\nimportant _Motion_ of public Benefit will be made this Session; or, if\r\nfortuitously made, will be seconded. The different Parties in the House,\r\nand Parties with different Views there always were and will be, are led\r\nby a _few_, who may be said to direct all the Operations of the Session.\r\nAmong that _few_, there is generally some one or two who are permitted\r\nto take the Lead in all Deliberations, and from thence may be said to\r\ndirect the whole. Supposing then that the Court should find means to\r\ntake off not only that _one_, or those _two_ or _three_, but all the\r\nChiefs or Directors of an Opposition at the Beginning of a Session, how\r\ncan it be expected that any Motions of Moment will be made? or, as I\r\nsaid before, if made will be seconded? All Motions to be made, that are\r\nof consequence, are first projected by the Leaders, and communicated and\r\nrecommended at their private Meetings and Clubs. But strip the Party of\r\nsuch Leaders, before they have Time to make, or even resolve on a new\r\nChoice of Chiefs, and there is an End of all such necessary and usual\r\nCommunications and Recommendations, and probably of the very Meetings\r\nantecedent to them. In time, a new Set of Leaders may arise, but there\r\nmust be Proof of their Truth and Abilities before they can acquire the\r\nnecessary Confidence; and such Proof is not produced hastily.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Right, old Sportsman. It must be _Truth_ and _Time_ that acquire\r\nthe Captains of Foxhounds the Confidence of the Pack.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Mr. _Overall_, you might have spared your Comparison of\r\nFoxhounds and Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Nor is Sir _John_’s Doctrine of _Motions_ less seasonable or\r\npertinent.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Decent Mr. _Smoothwell_, and you cautious Mr. _Roseband_, when\r\nare apt Comparisons to be made or necessary, and seasonable Truths to be\r\nspoken, unless it be on such an Occasion, and at such a Time as the\r\npresent?\r\n\r\n_Over_. See how these Law-and-Gospel-Mongers would debar a Freeborn from\r\nthe Privilege of expostulating with the Man to whom he is going to\r\ndelegate his Life, Liberty and Fortune!—— Z—ds, _Broadbottom_, sure you\r\nare not already become so rank a Courtier, as to have retained the Vicar\r\nof your Parish, and the Steward of your Manors, to padlock the friendly\r\nLips of your plain and upright Neighbours?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Far be it from me to endeavour preventing the Expostulations of\r\nmy Friends. I have always asked the Opinion of my Constituents in all\r\nMatters of Moment, since I have been in Parliament, and hope they will\r\nadmit that I have not misused the Trust committed to me.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Sir, we believ’d you a true _Englishman_; at least, let me\r\nspeak for myself, I did so, or I had not given you so often my Vote and\r\nInterest to represent your Country in Parliament: And I confess, that by\r\nall that appears, you have honourably discharged the Trust reposed in\r\nyou. But, Sir, the good Opinion I have had of you, and even that which I\r\nentertain of you at present, are no such Securities for your future\r\nConduct, considering the present State of Affairs, as should efface all\r\nTraces of Doubt and Jealousy out of my Mind. You are a Man, and as such,\r\nare not exempt from _Selfishness_, a Passion which Ministers never fail\r\nto sooth and gratify. I may believe you mean well; but can’t help\r\ndreading your suffering yourself to be _sweeten’d_ from your good\r\nIntentions.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Sir _John_, your Concern for my future Conduct speaks the\r\nSincerity of your Friendship, and I am therefore the more oblig’d to\r\nyou. But methinks the known Probity and Honour of those Men we join in\r\nthe Administration might lay your Doubts and Jealousies concerning my\r\nBehaviour for the Time to come.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I have nothing to do with the private _Probity_ and _Honour_\r\nof any Gentleman; but, Sir, if you expect I should think as favourably\r\nof those that have lately invited you to associate with them, as you\r\nseem to do, you are grossly mistaken. You differ in Opinion concerning\r\nthose Gentlemen, whom you now seem to applaud, not only with me, but\r\nwith yourself. What have those _most deserving Men_ done of late to\r\nacquire your good Opinion? It was but just before you went up to the\r\nfirst Meeting of the present Session, that you heartily joined Mr.\r\n_Blunt_ and myself, in condemning the _Passiveness_ of all those whom\r\nyou now associate with and praise. What have they done for the Public\r\nsince, or ever before, that should endear them to you or any true\r\n_Englishman_? Was Sir _R—— W——_’s whole Administration obnoxious to the\r\nMajority of the Nation? was it injurious to all? did not those you now\r\nare _grafted_ upon, concur with him in all his Measures? were they not\r\nmost of them, the Creatures of his Power? were not the chief of them his\r\nPupils, train’d up in all his Arts and Wiles? are they not of his\r\nrearing? are they not distinguishable at this very Hour by his Stamp?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. By this Scheme of _Ingraftment_ it plainly appears, that if\r\nthey don’t wear his Livery in View, they wear it under their upper\r\nGarments.\r\n\r\n_Over_. So that Sir _Brass_, like his Employer, still has his cloven\r\nFoot in all our Affairs.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. As sure as this new-devised _Ingraftment_ will ruin all our\r\n_Affairs_, unless the _Projector_ and his _Disciples_ will be so humble\r\nas to submit to be led by the Few they have called in to help steer the\r\nBark in a Storm.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. And what was it but their own servile _Passiveness_ that had\r\noccasion’d the _Storm_ which they now endeavour to quell by the Help of\r\nMr. _Broadbottom_ and his Brethren in the late Opposition? What could\r\nthe late fallen _Minister_, of whom they affect to complain as the\r\nAuthor of all our Calamities; what could that _Phaeton_, I say, have\r\ndone, had he not been supported by those who now affect to quit rather\r\nthan draw with him? Had not they the Power of the _Purse_? had not they\r\nin that and every other Respect, the Means of tying up that\r\n_Adventurer_’s Hands from hurting his Country, if they would? Yes, Mr.\r\n_Broadbottom_, those Men you now venerate so much, had the _Power_, but\r\nthey wanted the _Will_. And what was it but that fundamental, primary\r\nIngredient in the Composition of some Men, _Selfishness_, which induced\r\nthose Men to misuse the Power they then had?\r\n\r\n_Rose_. By your Leave, Sir _John_, tho’ the late Minister, the\r\n_Phaeton_, as you call him, may have misused his Power; I don’t see why\r\nthese Gentlemen who _remain_ in the Administration should be involved in\r\nhis Guilt.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Smoke the Parson, Gentlemen; mind how cautiously he treads on\r\n_Jack’s_ Heels.——_May have misused his Power!_ How gently he touches the\r\nSore! Then again, the charitable _Man can’t see the least Speck of Gall_\r\nin the _Doves_ that have thrust _Jack_ from the _Barn Door_.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Ah! Mr. _Overall_, that _Barn_ has made many an honest Man\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I don’t think it so, Mr. Mayor; a Man truly Honest is no\r\nmore to be corrupted than a Woman truly Chast. But as it is she only who\r\nis a Whore in her Heart that can be defiled, so is it he only who is a\r\nRogue in his Heart, that can be warped from his Integrity.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Gad, Sir _John_, I should be glad to know where your _truly\r\nHonest_ Men and _truly Chast_ Ladies grow. For in my poor Observation, I\r\nknew but one Man and one Woman that truly deserved the Epithet.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Your Mother was the precious Exception of one Sex.——Ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Rose_. And his pious _Dad_ the other.——Ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Over_. Neither; among the Men, _Jack_ the late M—r was the Exception,\r\nbecause he was the only Minister that ever I heard or read of, who had\r\nthe _Honesty_ to pretend to _none_. And among the Fair, Madame _V—te_,\r\nwho held out till her H—d commanded her and conducted her himself to the\r\nArms of her Lover.\r\n\r\n_Omnes_. Ha, ha!\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I say nothing of the Aptness of your Exception among the\r\nFair; but really, Mr. _Overall_, you have hit it off in regard to the\r\nother Sex. The late M—r was a Prodigy in his Way. I won’t say that I\r\never knew a less virtuous Minister, but I will, that I never knew one\r\nmade less Pretensions to Virtue.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. He courted Virtue as he did Applause.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. And was he not the Honester, for not pretending to that he\r\nresolved not to practise, and for not courting that which he knew he did\r\nnot deserve? But what better Pretensions have they, who, as my Friend\r\nMr. _Overall_ terms it, thrust him from the _Barn Door_, to either\r\nVirtue or Applause? Did they not give a Sanction to all his Measures?\r\nWere not they Partners of his Guilt? And more, were they not the\r\nPartners of his Predecessor’s Guilt? Had the late Minister shewn less\r\nContempt for them; had he wore more the Appearance of Modesty, or had\r\nmore Deference for their Opinions; had he seem’d to draw with them; had\r\nhe not ingross’d solely to himself the _Distribution_ of the Court\r\n_Manna_: Had he, in short, shared with his Fellow Ministers the vast\r\nEmoluments arising from the Distribution of the _Secret-Service_ Money,\r\nI fancy we should never have heard of the present unnatural\r\n_Ingraftment_.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Since you will have it an _Ingraftment_ rather than a\r\n_Coalition_, it shall be so; but why should it be an unnatural\r\n_Ingraftment_?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Why indeed? Don’t we see _Non-pareilles_ and _Golden Pippins_\r\ndaily grafted on _Crabs_, and yet thrive? Ha, ha!\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Yes, Mr. _Overall_; because they are all nourished by their\r\ncommon Parent, the Earth; and the _Crab-Tree_ is a Channel only for the\r\nNurture to pass thro’. In this Case, the Earth, from whence both Species\r\nreceive Nourishment, remains pure and uninfected; the _Crab_ has no more\r\nInfluence than the _Pippin_. But can we suppose the Parity will hold in\r\nthe other Case? The old _Standards_ in the Administration ingross the\r\n_Soil_: The _ingrafted Shoots_ shall have no more Communication with it,\r\nthan their elder Brethren shall be pleased to permit.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. I am sorry to see all Sir _John_’s Observations tinctured with\r\nUncharitableness. Why should the old _Standards_, as you call those that\r\nremain of the late Ministry, infect the Soil, by which I suppose the ——\r\nis meant, any more than the _ingrafted Shoots_ or new Comers?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. The _new Comers_, for aught I know, wou’d be as arrant\r\nCourtiers, as supple Fawners in time, as the old _Standards_ themselves,\r\nhad they equal Opportunity. But my Life for’t, the _Ingrafted_ will be\r\nkept at Arms Length from the Royal Ear.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. I hope not, Sir _John_; those we join are Men of Honour; and\r\nthey assure us of going Hand in Hand with us——\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. To raise the _Supplies_.\r\n\r\n_Over_. And screen Delinquents.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Will they join, think you, in National Parsimony, in the\r\nEncouragement of Trade and Industry, and the Discouragement of Venality\r\nand Corruption? Will they join in repealing those Laws which affect\r\n_Freedom_, and in lessening the vast Power accruing to the Crown from\r\nthe great Weight of our Debts and Taxes, by the Distribution of civil\r\nEmployments? Will they join——\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Yes, Sir _John_, in fleecing the Nation to fill their own\r\nPockets, and gratify Mr. _Nameless_.\r\n\r\n_Over_. That same _Nameless_ must have an excellent _Digestion_; and\r\nsure his necessary Woman must have golden Days of it; for without doubt,\r\nhe who swallows so much _Gold_ must sh—t a great deal of the Metal.——\r\nBut I forget that _H——_ is the _Close-stool_, where all the precious\r\nExcrement centers.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. And but _One_, on this Side the Water, has a Key to that\r\nvaluable Repository.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. For Cleanliness of Conversation, commend me to you both,\r\nGentlemen.\r\n\r\n_Over_. And for doubling and time-serving, commend me to Gownsmen.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Gentlemen, I intreat we may live sociably together as usual.\r\nLet us not give Way to Spleen or Ill-nature. Mr. _Roseband_ and Mr.\r\n_Smoothwell_ happen at this Time to be in a more charitable Disposition\r\nthan the rest of the Company. But, I assure myself, you will be all of\r\none Opinion, when you see perfect _Concord_ in the Administration, and\r\nthat _Union_ directed to promote publick Happiness.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Mr. _Broadbottom_, I heartily agree with you in the\r\nBanishment of Heat and Sarcasm from our Conversation; but can’t help\r\ndissenting from you in the other Point. Without giving up my Reason, I\r\ncan’t reckon upon _Concord_ between two Sets of Men, as seemingly\r\ndifferent in their Views and Principles as can well be imagin’d. By all\r\nthat appears hitherto, you lately _Ingrafted_, have acted on Principles\r\nthe most honourable, and with Views the most disinterested that ever Men\r\ndid; whereas the _old Standards_ seem to have no Views but to\r\n_Self-Interest_, nor Principles, but such as are repugnant to\r\n_Patriotism_.\r\n\r\n_Over_. _Patriotism!_ Ha, ha! Poor Wanderer! Where has she taken up her\r\nHabitation, since she was sent adrift by those _Ingrafted_ about two\r\nYears ago upon the old Stock?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Patience. Mr. _Overall_, and you shall see her perch’d on the\r\njoint Endeavours of our mottley Ministry to save the Nation.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. I hope you will, Mr. _Blunt_, tho’ you speak it with a Sneer.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I heartily wish we may. But in my Mind, the Coalition on\r\nwhich you reckon so much, is as impracticable as squaring the Circle, if\r\nyou Gentlemen newly _Ingrafted_, and _those_ you are _Ingrafted_ on,\r\n_thought_ as you _spoke_ and _acted_, and continue the same way of\r\n_thinking_?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Have not you seen, that the late _Ingrafted_ had two Ways of\r\n_thinking_?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. One fitted for the _Country_, the other for the _Court_?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Good Mr. Mayor, spare your Friends, at least till you find them\r\ntripping.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. For my Part, the whole Stress of my Argument rests on a\r\nSupposition; that both Parties of the Administration will adhere to\r\ntheir native Principles and Way of thinking. On this Supposition then\r\nwhere can be the _Concord_, where the _Coalition_?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Just where the Union would be between Kites and Doves.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. But, my Fox-hunter, leaving Concord and Union out of the\r\nQuestion, when has it been seen, that spotless innocent _Doves_ have had\r\nthe weak Complaisance of associating with the crafty and guilty _Kites_,\r\non the first Offer of Friendship and Cordiality?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Still, my worthy Magistrate, severe upon your old Friends?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Mr. _Broadbottom_, call not that Severity, which is the\r\nResult of Friendship. I judge of Mr. _Blunt_ by myself, who, because I\r\nesteem you, fear you may be imposed upon in the Step you have lately\r\ntaken. You could not but see that the Court made to you, was the Effect\r\nrather of _Necessity_ than _Choice_. You must not be the Man of\r\nPenetration I take you for, unless you saw that you would be an\r\nunwelcome Guest at C—t, and an unwelcome Companion to those who invited\r\nyou thither. In such Circumstances, I should expect that you, and those\r\nwhom you have selected among your Party to accompany you, wou’d insist\r\nupon such Terms for your Country, as would endear you to your\r\nCountrymen.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. But, Sir _John_, would it become us to insist on Terms, when\r\nnone were exacted from us?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. It not only would become you to insist on such Terms as\r\nwould be of public Utility, but it was absolutely necessary you shou’d,\r\nif you would maintain your Character and serve your Country. You _New\r\nComers_ are but a few, if compared to those you are ingrafted on. They\r\nmay, and probably will out-argue, or rather out-vote you, whenever you\r\nshall presume to oppose their Measures; and should you persist in your\r\nOpposition, they will thrust you from the _Barn_ for your Contumacy.\r\nSuch will be the best of your Case.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Best do you call it? Pray, Sir _John_, what do you call the\r\nWorst of their Case?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. To quit their own Principles, and take up those of the old\r\n_Standards_. In that Case they might think to mend their own private\r\nFortunes, but would most certainly ruin their Country, and of course\r\nwould lose all Credit with their Countrymen.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. But is it impossible for Men of different Principles to meet\r\neach other half Way, and agree in such Essentials as may promote the\r\ngeneral Good of the Community?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. He who meets an Opponent half way, recedes from his own\r\nPrinciples, and embraces in part at least, those of his Antagonist. Now\r\nif your _Principles_ were _sound_, and those of the _old Standards\r\nunsound_, as we must believe from your constant Opposition for the Time\r\npast; how can you depart from yours, without embracing _unsound_\r\nPrinciples? No, Sir, I protest against half-way Meetings between a\r\nMajority in _Power_, and a few, who, I’m afraid, grasp too eagerly at a\r\nShred, or rather Shadow of that _Power_. The _Magnet_ is with the\r\ngreater Number; pray Heaven, it attracts not the smaller to it!\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Why so desponding, Sir _John_, you who were won’t to be the\r\nfirmest Prop of our Party Hopes?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. To be very serious, Mr. _Broadbottom_, I apprehend we are in\r\na wretched Situation; and I see but one Means, by which we may hope to\r\nbetter our Condition. But I foresee that we sha’n’t have the Wisdom or\r\nVirtue to pursue that only Way. Notwithstanding the Groupe of Ills we\r\nlabour under; notwithstanding our Necks are sore gall’d with the Yoke, I\r\nfear, should the Time of procuring ourselves Ease ever offer, Corruption\r\nwill prevail, and _Avarice_ will chuse the Continuance of our Woe. If we\r\nwould expect such a thorough Change of Measures as the Nation seem to\r\nwish for and require, can we hope for it from the present Patch-work\r\nmingling of Hands?\r\n\r\nThe taking Gentlemen into the Administration, who have distinguished\r\nthemselves by their Zeal for the Interests of their Country, is not, I\r\nfear, designed to ease the People, but to bring those Gentlemen to bear\r\na Share of the public Hatred and Infamy, which the late M—rs have\r\nincurr’d by the most flagitious Measures. This must cause an irreparable\r\nBreach between the Public and those now rever’d and beloved Patriots; a\r\nPolicy by which the Projectors think, perhaps, they leave the Flocks\r\nwithout Shepherds, and may at Pleasure then prey upon the Folds. But let\r\nme warn these Politicians, that it is not always safe to leave an\r\ninjur’d, oppress’d, exasperated People without Leaders on whose Probity\r\nthey may depend. On the other hand, let me warn our Patriots, that as a\r\nSnare may have been laid for them, it is their Business to take care\r\nthey are not taken in it. They have been the Hopes as well as Darlings\r\nof their Country, and it should be their Study at this critical Juncture\r\nnot to give Room for suspecting their Virtue. In short, they should\r\navoid becoming themselves the Curse of their Country, or countenancing\r\nthose that have been so for many Years.\r\n\r\nThe War for the Sake of _H——_, has been carried on after a Manner so\r\ndishonourable, not to say infamous, and so expensive, that the old\r\n_Standards_, for a Reason easily pointed out, look upon a _Peace_ to be\r\nabsolutely necessary. The Conduct of the War will not suffer them to\r\nhope that equitable Terms will be allow’d them; on the other hand, they\r\nmust be sensible, that the People have a greater Regard to the Honour of\r\nthe Nation than to private Interest, and will be against sheathing the\r\nSword, till the Blood of our foreign Enemies has wash’d off the Stain\r\nfix’d on the Glory of the Nation by her domestic Foes. In this Dilemma\r\nthey may think it the best, indeed the only Expedient to cast the Burden\r\non the _Favourites_ of the People. If they accept of Peace on\r\ndishonourable Terms, the late M—rs are acquitted; if they reject it, any\r\nMisfortunes that may attend the War will be intirely cast upon them. In\r\na Word, the Ministers have entangled the Skein, and call upon the\r\nPatriots to disentangle it, or share the Odium of their Folly and\r\nWickedness. They have woven the _Gordian Knot_, and the Friends of the\r\nPeople are to loose it.\r\n\r\n_Over_. We shall soon see who are the Peoples Friends.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Can you have any Doubt concerning them?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Were not those _Deserters_ lately thrust from the _Barn_, the\r\nPeoples Friends too before they were _ingrafted_ on the Ministry? All\r\nare the Peoples Friends while they are rising on the Shoulders of the\r\nPeople; but when once they are up, away goes the Scaffolding. Mr.\r\n_Broadbottom_, I believe you are a Friend to the People, or I would not\r\nsupport your last Election, or your present Re-election; but if you\r\nwould convince us you are truly so, let us see you heartily endeavouring\r\nto obtain something for those willing People that have drain’d their\r\nVitals to comply with a C—t and Ministry, and bore the Heat of the Day.\r\nRestore us our _Triennial_ Parliaments.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Or rather our Annual Parliaments, which was the ancient\r\nConstitution. But, Mr. _Broadbottom_, let us have them without\r\n_Purchase_. I understand the C—l L—st is greatly incumber’d. I hope ’tis\r\nnot intended to clear it at the People’s Expence, before the annual\r\nProduce of it be fairly stated and known.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Can you expect to know any thing the Court has a mind you\r\nshould not, while _Seven’s_ the Main?\r\n\r\n_Over_. No more _Septs_ say I; I believe I shall never love the Number\r\n_Seven_ again, as long as live.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. _Seven_ or _Seventy_ would be of little Significancy in a\r\nCountry and Age less corrupt than ours. But considering the present\r\nDepravity, I must confess that _septennial_ Parliaments afford Ministers\r\nmore Opportunity than I would willingly allow them, to put in Practice\r\nthe Arts of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. If the Depravity be so great and general as you represent it,\r\nhow shall our Condition be better’d by a Repeal of the _septennial_ Law?\r\nThe Cabinet Arts, which you so much apprehend, may be as well practised\r\non the _triennial_ as _septennial_ Servants of the People.\r\n\r\n_Over_. To prevent which, let us do as our braver, honester _Popish_\r\nAncestors did.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Ah! Mr. _Overall_! Your worthy Father would not have been so\r\nliberal of his Epithets to Papists.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Mr. _Roseband_, my Father loved and rever’d Virtue wherever he\r\nfound it. And he blush’d not any more than I should, to own that our\r\nPopish Ancestors had the true Spirit of Patriotism, and that they left\r\nus more valuable Blessings than we are like to leave Posterity.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. How, my Politician! Sha’n’t we and Posterity too bask in\r\nPlenty, if we do as you say our honester popish Ancestors did? ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Pray, Mr. _Overall_, What are we to do in imitation of our\r\nbraver Ancestors? ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Over_. To _curse_ the Ambitious and Corrupt.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Curse, Mr. _Overall_! Is it for Christians to curse?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Is it for _Englishmen_ to be bribed out of their Virtue? What\r\nare the Curses you pronounce on _Ashwednesdays_?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Mr. _Overall_ means, I suppose, the Anathema solemnly\r\ndenounced in the Reign of _Henry_ III. by the Archbishop of\r\n_Canterbury_, at the Head of the Barons and other great Men of the\r\nNation, against all such as should directly or indirectly oppose the\r\nObservance of the _two Charters_, and those who should violate,\r\ndiminish, or alter in any Manner whatever the Laws and Constitutions of\r\nthe Kingdom.\r\n\r\n_Over_. I do, Sir _John_; and the Method I would propose should be, that\r\nthe Members of the Legislature, not excepting the pious Lords the B—ps,\r\non the Expiration of the present Parliament, would meet in _Westminster_\r\nAbbey, and there solemnly denounce, by the Mouth of the Archbishop, or,\r\nif some squeamish Puritans should object to the Surplice, by the Mouths\r\nof the Lord C—r and Sp—r, the bitterest Curses against all who shall\r\noffer or accept a Bribe at a new Election, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Or who shall accept of a Place or Pension after he is elected,\r\nin order to support the Measures of Evil Ministers, or screen them.\r\n\r\n_Over_. _Blunt_, let you and I draw up a Form of the Anathema. I would\r\nask the Vicar, but that he says ’tis Antichristian, to curse the Wicked.\r\nFirst then, _Cursed_ be he who offers any Bribe or Gratification to any\r\nFreeholder or Burgher to obtain his Vote: _Cursed_ be he who is an\r\nInstrument to corrupt any who has a Right to give his Vote for any\r\nCandidate to represent his County or Borough: _Cursed_ be he, who having\r\na Right to vote, shall be biass’d in his Voting by any private Interest,\r\nViews, or Hopes: _Cursed_ be he who makes any unjust Returns of Members;\r\nand may such Enemies of their Country be _cursed_ in themselves, their\r\nWives and Posterity, and in their Goods and Chattels; may they\r\nthemselves become the Butt of public Scorn, Hatred and Contempt, whilst\r\nliving, and their Widows and Daughters become common Prostitutes for\r\nBread; and may their Sons experience that _Slavery_, which they would\r\nhave brought upon their Country; may their Herds and Flocks die with the\r\nMurrain and Rot; may their Lands become barren, and may their Memory for\r\never stink in the Nostrils of all honest Men and true _Britons_. Let all\r\nhere say, _Amen_.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. See what it is to be a Foxhunter; no other’s Lungs would have\r\nheld out in so long a Chase of useful Curses; ha, ha!\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Why indeed, Mr. _Broadbottom_, if Curses would cure the\r\ngreat Evil of _Corruption_, they might be truly called _useful_. But I\r\nam afraid the World is become too cursed to be frighten’d by Curses from\r\nthe Commission of Evil. Therefore I would have them restrain’d by some\r\nmore coercive Means. And as the Repeal of the _Septennial_ Act, and\r\neffectual _Place_ and _Pensions_ Bills, seem to bid fairest of any Means\r\nI can think of, for removing the Gangreen which preys upon the Vitals of\r\nour Constitution; I should be glad to see the P—— this very Session take\r\nthem seriously into Consideration. I hope they will, for the good of\r\nPosterity and their own Honour. And let me add, Mr. _Broadbottom_, that\r\nI hope it for yours, and your new _Ingrafted_ Brethren’s Sake, who must\r\nrise or sink with the Publick, as these Points are dropt or vigorously\r\npushed and obtain’d. What is it to the People who is _in_ or _out_ of\r\nPlace, if they receive no Benefit by the Change? On the Contrary, a\r\npretended Coalition leaves them in a worse Condition than they were\r\nbefore, as it deprives them of their present Leaders, and a colourable\r\nPretence for Complaint. For won’t Courtiers be apt to call that a wanton\r\nComplaint, which has not the Sanction of the old Chiefs of the People?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Sir _John_, as all who hear you, improve by your Conversation;\r\nall who converse with you, ought to pay a Deference to your Opinions,\r\nwhich are generally well founded. But tho’ I should admit that the\r\nPoints you contend for, would be of public Utility; yet I believe you\r\nwill admit likewise, that there may be Seasons wherein it would not be\r\nproper to press these Matters with too great Warmth. It would be\r\nill-timing the Embellishment or Repair of a House, when the Chimney was\r\non Fire. The World at Home and Abroad is unsettled and perplexed. We\r\nhave Quarrels and Parties——\r\n\r\nSir _John_. We have so, and Taxes, Poverty, and Corruption. And we have\r\nlikewise open, and who are more dangerous, secret Enemies; at least, we\r\nhave lukewarm Friends.——This is no more than what I dreaded, when I\r\nfirst heard how few of the reputed Friends of the People were invited to\r\nC—t. When I saw all the great Offices of Trust continued in the old\r\n_Standards_, I dreaded the Consequence of taking a few of the Leaders of\r\nthe People into the subordinate Posts.——Mr. _Broadbottom_, I am sorry to\r\ntell you, that I dreaded you would have learnt the Court _Catechise_,\r\nwhen I heard you accepted of a Place before obtaining such Points as the\r\nPeople contend for, and are of absolute Necessity. Why should it be\r\nunseasonable to restore us to _triennial_ Parliaments, and to secure\r\nLiberty by effectual Place and Pension Bills? What Ferment or Combustion\r\nis here at Home, that should prevent or deter the Friends of our\r\nConstitution from seeking its immediate Repair, where it has been\r\nweakened by either Time or Art? What have the Broils of _Germany_ to do\r\nwith the _British_ Constitution?\r\n\r\nThe World, you say, is unsettled and perplexed abroad, and we have\r\nQuarrels and Parties at Home. Granted; and who are accountable for the\r\nPerplexities on the Continent and the Parties here at Home? Not the\r\nPeople, Mr. _Broadbottom_, whose Contentment you would postpone to a\r\nmore seasonable Opportunity. I should be glad to know the ministerial\r\n_Seasons_ for doing public Justice. We have had a long Interval of Peace\r\nsince the passing the _Septennial_ Law, yet our Ministers never thought\r\nit _seasonable_ to suffer it to be repealed. The Ministers, Sir, I mean\r\nthe _B——h_ Ministers, and not the _B——h_ Nation, have been principally\r\nand primarily Authors of the Broils on the Continent; and our Fewds at\r\nHome are no less owing to them.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. How, Sir _John_, will you place the Ambition of _France_, the\r\nPerfidy of _P——a_, and the Inaction of _Holland_, to the Account of our\r\nMinisters?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I will, and with the strictest Justice.——_France_ had not\r\ndared to attempt gratifying her Ambition, nor _P——_ to support _France_,\r\nor _Holland_ to look on, if a Foreign Interest did not biass _B——h_\r\nMinisters from the true Interest of their Country. To sum up all in one\r\nWord, _H——_ is accountable for all the Perplexities on the Continent,\r\nand all our Fewds at Home.——But what Fewds or Quarrels can be\r\napprehended after so hopeful a _Coalition_ as the present? When shall\r\n_Britons_ expect Relief, unless when the _best Men of all Parties_,\r\naccording to one of our Patriot Writers, have the Power and Direction of\r\npublic Affairs?\r\n\r\n_Broad_. We are only accountable for our own Conduct; and as we are but\r\na few—\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I dread you may be biassed by the Majority. Why should you\r\nagree to come into the Support of a tottering M——y before you had\r\nsecured such a Share of Power as would enable you to change Measures\r\nobnoxious and injurious to the People? Why would you come in without\r\nsecuring a Moiety at least, of the great Offices of Trust, such as first\r\nC—— of the T——y, S——y of S——, and P——t of the C——t, _&c. &c_.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Faith now, Sir _John_, that would be keeping Gentlemen to d—d\r\nhard Meat. What, not allow Men to stoop at small Game, that have been\r\nbeating about for many Years in vain? Pshaw! Gad! ’tis quite ungenteel\r\nand unconscionable.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. My Quarrel is not to the Gentlemen’s Humility, but to their\r\nWant of Prudence. Mr. _Broadbottom_, I hope, will pardon the Expression.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. With all my Heart. Sir _John Probeum_ can say nothing, because\r\nI am sure he means not, to offend me.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Sir, you do me but Justice; I intend an Affront to no Man,\r\nmuch less to you, whom I have always esteemed.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. And of whom you shall have no Cause to alter your good Opinion.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I hope not, tho’ I cannot so readily digest your _Seasons_\r\nfor redressing the People’s Grievances.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. _Times_ and _Seasons_ were Cant Words with the late\r\n_Deserters_, as soon as the People expected they would act according to\r\ntheir Professions.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Ha, ha! Courtiers act up to their Professions! Ha, ha! What a\r\nSolecism wou’d that be? Why Man, you forget that _Double_ and _John_,\r\nand _Long Bib_, and _Dismal_, and the Rest of that precious deserting\r\nGang were become _Courtiers_, when they found out that it was\r\nunseasonable to weaken the Ministerial Power, and strengthen that of the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Experience, they say, is the Mother of Wisdom; but I am\r\nsorry we _Englishmen_ are seldom instructed by that sagacious Lady. I\r\nhave lived to see the People deluded and injured by those whom they\r\nthemselves had screw’d up into Power; and I have seen them receiving\r\nthose very _Deluders_ a second and third Time into their Favour.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. A Proof of their Lenity and Good-nature, Sir _John_.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Of their Stupidity rather. I am bound to forgive an Enemy,\r\nbut know of no Injunction human or divine, that enjoins me to trust that\r\nEnemy a second Time, and put the Snake in my Bosom.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Sir _John_, you shall never have Cause for making the\r\nApplication here. If I can’t serve with Honour, I am a free Agent, and\r\nshall make use of the Freedom I was born to. I will fling up my P—— the\r\nMoment I find I can’t keep it consistent with my Duty to my Country.\r\n\r\n_Over_. There spoke the Genius of old _England_.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Like that _noble_ Patriot, who flung up not long since, that he\r\nmight not share in the Guilt and Odium of the Company he kept.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. And that noble Patriot is heartily with us in the present\r\nChange. I hope you will think that his Presence should be enough to keep\r\nus all in Countenance.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. There is not a Man alive has a better Opinion of that great\r\nMan than myself; but shou’d he tell me of _Times_ and _Seasons_ for\r\nredressing Grievances, I should alter my Opinion of him, and think him\r\ninfected by the Air of the C—t. But that Patriot _Englishman_ is\r\nuncapable of so great Baseness and Folly. He knows that War Time is the\r\nproperest for enquiring into the Misconduct of the War; and I hope for\r\nthat Reason, he and all his Friends will encourage an Inquiry into the\r\nMiscarriage at _Carthagena_, and into the more dishonourable Misconduct\r\nlast Year at the _Hieres_. I hope likewise he and you will promote a\r\nstrict Inspection into the Management of our Land War.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. You mean the _H—n_ War. I am sure we are no otherwise concerned\r\nin it, than to have the Honour of defraying its Expence.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Be our Concern what it will, it ought to have been managed\r\nwith some Decency, if not with Vigour and Prudence. But ever since the\r\nCommencement, it has been carried on ingloriously for the Nation, and\r\nscandalously for those who had the Conduct of it. And should such\r\nwrong-headed or corrupt Agents go unpunish’d or unexamin’d at least, it\r\nwill be setting such an Example of national _Lenity_, as may prove fatal\r\nin the Day of Necessity.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. National _Lenity_! Ah, Sir _John_, you were wont to call Things\r\nby their right Names—— What shall we call the _Lenity_ shewn to the late\r\nArch-delinquent?\r\n\r\n_Over_. The Duce! what would the Man have; was not there a S—t C—ee\r\nappointed?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Yes; and the very little which that C—ee was pleas’d to\r\npublish concerning that Arch-spoiler of his Country, proves that they\r\nought to have proceeded further.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Dear _Broadbottom_, let us have no C—ees at all, unless you have\r\nthe _Will_ and _Power_ to sift Things to the Bottom: For it is but\r\ntantalizing a Nation to pretend doing them Justice, and never intend\r\nany.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. ’tis encouraging public Venality and Corruption. But C—ees are\r\npretty _Tubs_, too often thrown out to amuse the People.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. What Pity ’tis to abuse the Credulity of the best natur’d\r\nPeople in the World!\r\n\r\n_Over_. Sir _John_, you may praise their good Nature as much as you\r\nplease; but, Gad! I say they are the veriest Oafs in Christendom. Z—ds!\r\nthat a People should be so d—n’d stupid as to delegate their Power again\r\nand again; nay, a Power too over their Lives and Fortunes, to Men who\r\nhad done them repeated Injuries, and of whom they had made repeated\r\nComplaints. They complain’d of the _Septennial_ as a grievous\r\nImposition; yet the very next Opportunity chose those very Men that had\r\nso grossly imposed upon them.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Was it not the same in regard to the _Excise-Scheme_ and the\r\n_Convention_?\r\n\r\n_Over_. The _H—r_ Troops, and the _&c. &c_. to the End of a Chapter as\r\nlong as the Book of Homilies.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. But, Gentlemen, don’t you forget to season your Account of the\r\nPeople’s _Folly_ with a certain native Spice called _Knavery_, or in\r\nother Words, _Self-interest_, which, according to Sir _John_, is the\r\nprimary fundamental Ingredient in the Composition of most Men? Did not\r\nthese injur’d complaining People bring their Suffrages to Market overt,\r\nwhere the best Bidder was sure to have them?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. The Fact, I am afraid, is but too true: And at the same Time\r\nthat it proves the Corruption of the People, it proves likewise the\r\nNecessity of an immediate Remedy. Had those scandalous Marts for the\r\nSale of _B—sh_ Liberty been more common; had they been _annual_, or even\r\n_triennial_, the M—rs would not find their Account in the frequent\r\nExpence; nay, they could not support it.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Yet necessary as the immediate Application of this Specific is,\r\nyou shall see it postponed to more pacific _Times_, and gentler\r\n_Seasons_.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Mr. _Blunt_, tho’ you speak thus in Derision, yet if you\r\nreflect with Seriousness, the Delay of a Remedy so extraordinary as the\r\nRepeal of the _Septennial_ is, till after the War, will not seem so\r\nunmeet to you as it appears at present.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Dost think the _Repeal_ would abate the Courage of our Soldiers\r\nand Seamen, and raise that of the Enemy? Dost think it would pall the\r\nAppetites of those greedy _Germans_, that now and long have done us the\r\nHonour to receive _Subsidies_ from us? Wou’d the Queen of _Hungary_ and\r\nKing of _Sardinia_ receive _English_ Money the less freely; or defend\r\ntheir own Territories the less carefully, if _general Content_ should be\r\nspread throughout this Island, powerful as much or more by the Union of\r\nits Inhabitants, as by their Bravery and Wealth? Would our good Allies\r\nthe _Dutch_ be deafer to our Intreaties, or slower in their Motions than\r\nthey have been of late, should they see the very _Fountain_ of our\r\nCorruption and Venality dry’d up by a Legislative Spunge?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Would our A—ls and G—ls have less Sense, Experience, Courage and\r\nHonesty, if they were to go to _Market_ with their _Bank-bills_, but\r\nevery _Third Year_?\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. You forget that your favourite A—l was lately courted at many\r\n_Markets_ without the Aid of Bank-bills.\r\n\r\n_Over_. No, Sir; I don’t forget that his Merit had endeared him to the\r\nPeople, and render’d him hateful to—— Mi-Mi—Mi—Ministers.—’Sflesh! I\r\nthought I could never keep down another _Word_ which would force itself\r\nin the room of Ministers.—— But enough of that. No, Mr. _Smoothwell_, I\r\nforget not that that gallant, honest Man has not been thought of in the\r\npresent Change, tho’ his Valour, Experience, Probity, and good Sense,\r\ncan’t be called in question.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Truly I wonder’d when I saw not his Name among the List of\r\nC—rs of a certain Board.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. There are certain _Prejudices_, which, in Prudence, we were\r\nobliged to overlook when we could not surmount them.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I don’t at all question but there was a _Prejudice_ to you\r\n_all_; but when you were able to conquer that which was always supposed\r\nto be conceived against you personally, Mr. _Broadbottom_, I should not\r\nwonder you could surmount all Prejudice whatever.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Pr’ythee, _Bottom_, how came it practicable to ram one of your\r\n_uncommon Size_, down the narrow squeamish Throat of ——? again, another\r\n_Word_ would intrude on the Word Ministers.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I’ll tell thee; to take away from us all our Props; to strip us\r\nof our Leaders; in short, to leave no Speaker or Man of known Merit\r\nbehind—\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I fear that was Part of the Plan; and if so, we are undone,\r\nunless we are saved by the Virtue and Steadiness of those whom the\r\nPeople have confided in all along, and rais’d at last.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. You need not fear them.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I would not willingly suspect Men, who owe more to their\r\nConstituents, than those they have all along opposed. On a Supposition\r\nthat these had purchas’d, no matter how infamously, they assum’d a Sort\r\nof Right to reimburse themselves at the Expence of the Venders. But you\r\n_Patriots_ have no such colourable Claim for disserving those who\r\nspontaneously chose you their Attornies with no private Views in the\r\nWorld, or any Views but such as tend to the Good of the Community in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Gad, my dear _Broady_, you ought to be doubly cursed, nay doubly\r\nd—n’d, should you not earnestly and truly serve those that had\r\ngratuitously vested you with ample Power over their Persons, Lands,\r\nGoods, Chattels, Wives and Bairns.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. And Hounds and Hunters; ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. And Tythes and Dues, my laughing Vicar—Is the _Liberty_ of a\r\nfree People a fit Subject for Laughter? Is not our All at Stake at this\r\ncritical Juncture? Should those who have been always our reputed\r\nFriends, _join_ with those who were always deem’d our Enemies, what\r\nshall become of us? What shall we do?\r\n\r\n_Over_. I’ll tell you; _unite_, and join against both.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I should not wonder if a general _Union_ against all secret\r\nand open Enemies would be the Consequence of any signal Misconduct or\r\nDefection in those lately _ingrafted_. For after such repeated\r\nExperience as the People have had of the Power of C—— _Infection_, it\r\nmay be expected they would go greater Lengths than might be agreeable to\r\nthe Authors of their Despair. ’tis dangerous to push a sensible People\r\ntoo far.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Pshaw! brag not too much of your Sensibility, I beseech you,\r\nafter such Provocations as you have had since the _Septennial_ Y——e has\r\nbeen upon your Necks. Gad! they are as tame as my _Chesnut_ after a\r\nMorning’s Chase.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. They are observant of the Laws, and I hope they will always\r\ncontinue so.\r\n\r\n_Over_. ’Sbud! you wou’dn’t have us keep Measures with _Renegadoes_ and\r\n_Promise-breakers_?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. No; but I am for no Measure that exceeds legal Bounds.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Z—ds Man! you don’t think I would advise the knocking such\r\n_Recreants_ in the Head without Judge or Jury, tho’ they would merit the\r\nworst of Deaths. No; I would not touch a Hair of their Heads; but d—n me\r\nif ever that Man should have my Friendship or Vote again, who should\r\nonce break public _Faith_ with me.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Right, my worthy ’Squire—— Oh! how solemnly have we been\r\npromis’d a Redress of all our Grievances as soon as our _Idols_ should\r\ncome into the Administration!\r\n\r\n_Rose_. _Idols_! Mr. Mayor.——\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Ay, Doctor; such, and worse, if possible, are all those useless\r\ninsignificant Men, that fawn, flatter and promise, to arrive at the\r\nSummit of their Ambition, and forget all they had promised as soon as\r\ntheir Turn is served.—Idols! Mr. _Roseband_; yes, Sir, I would call our\r\nPatriots so to their Faces, and even Mr. _Broadbottom_ himself, whom I\r\nalways lov’d and serv’d, should the Redress of our Grievances be\r\npostpon’d. Tame and gull’d as we awkward Country Putts have been; stupid\r\nas we are thought to be, we can feel, and even see when we are play’d\r\noff. Let the Legerdemain be never so dextrous, believe me, we can see\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\n_Over_. We don’t forget how Sir _Bob_ used to fly thro’ the Hoops, when\r\nhe was press’d hard. He wou’d shift the Pack off his own, to cast it on\r\n_nobler_ Shoulders.——The Cheat is stale, it won’t pass now.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. It won’t indeed. We know very well what it means to have a\r\nThing go thro’ glibly below, when it is settled before hand, that it\r\nshall be stifled in its Flight. Mr. _Broadbottom_, you know my Meaning;\r\nand you know too what you have often promised, if ever you should come\r\ninto Play, that you would promote the use of _Tacking_, when nothing\r\nelse would do.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. I am sorry that the Head of a considerable Corporation, should\r\ngive so great Room for suspecting his Loyalty, as to wish for the\r\npostponing the _Supplies_ in time of War.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I am more sorry to see a Principal of any Corporation, a\r\nSycophant, and Time-server. Mr. _Smoothwell_, you may or may not excuse\r\nmy plain Dealing, as you please. Pray Sir, why might not the _Redress_\r\ngo Hand in Hand with the _Supply_? Is a Million the less a Million for\r\nbeing wrapt up in the same Paper or Parchment with a _Triennial_, or\r\neffectual Place and _Pension_ Bills? Might not Votes of _Credit_ and\r\nVotes of _Inquiry_ be very naturally blended together? Would it swell\r\nthe public Debts, if a secret and special C——ee were appointed to\r\ninspect the _Debts_ of the Nation?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. And the _State_ of the Nation too, Mr. Mayor. I have always\r\nlamented the Want of such a C——ee. It could not fail, if well chosen, to\r\nanswer every good End proposed by a National Enquiry.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Brave, upright old Man! have you not seen _Pharsalia_? What have\r\nwe got by the late E——y into dextrous _Bob_’s Conduct?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. A _Proof_ that he ought to be shorten’d by the——\r\n\r\n_Over_. And pray, how would you have those _worthy Men_ serv’d, who\r\ncondescended to let us have a Sight of that precious _Half-proof_, and\r\nnot an Inch farther?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. As they deserved——\r\n\r\n_Over_. Mum for that——Gad! _Blunt_, I thought you too sincere for\r\nCaution and Circumspection.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. As much as to say, you thought his Worship no wiser than he\r\nshou’d be. Ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Over_. As much as I should think a Time-server to be an honest Man.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Heed him not, Mr. _Overall_, he would set you and I together by\r\nthe Ears, but he shan’t have his Ends. (_Looking on his Watch_.) Bless\r\nus! how insensibly Time passes in good Company.—Mr. _Broadbottom_, at\r\nwhat Hour shall we meet in the Town-Hall? the sooner the better, for\r\nfear of Accidents.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Of Opposition, you mean——I have heard of no new Candidate.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I hope there will be no Candidate but yourself; and tho’ I\r\nbelieve you’ll meet with no Opposition, expect not to be re-elected\r\nwithout Bustle and Murmur. The Freemen are not quite pleased with your\r\nlate Conduct. They think you, and some others, have been too hasty and\r\npartial in your Distribution of Places——\r\n\r\n_Broad_. They quite mistake the Thing, the _Distribution_ was not of our\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I am sorry to hear of so shameful an Error. Were you\r\nsensible of the _Necessity_ some Men were driven to; and of your own\r\n_Usefulness_, and yet have no Share in the Settlement of the main\r\nArticle of the Coalition? I wish you may not live to repent you of your\r\nIndolence or Timidity.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Timidity! Sir _John_.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Yes, in Truth. I am not afraid to tell you, that you\r\nbetrayed either too much _Timidity_, or too strong an Appetite for\r\nEmployments, when you could make no better a Bargain for your Party, or\r\nobtain no absolute positive Assurances that the _Redress_ should go Hand\r\nin Hand with the _Supply_. Are we to bleed for ever? Are we never to\r\ntaste of Cordials?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Our Doctors think that _Bitters_ sit best on our English\r\nStomachs.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. _Bitters_ are of a hot Nature; the _Prescribers_ should take\r\nCare, that a too constant use of them may not _inflame_ the Blood too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n_Over_. They have provided beforehand a Remedy against such an Evil.——A\r\ngood many Thousands in _Red_, will cure an Inflammation presently.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. They may, by Amputation, if in some of the _Limbs_ only; but\r\nshould ever Poverty, Oppression, or Despair, force the Inflammation into\r\nthe _Body_ and Bowels, I doubt the Surgeons in _Red_ would not find the\r\nCure so very easy. But I hope our Friends, few as they are, will find\r\nsome Means of perswading their fellow Practicers to drop their\r\n_Bitters_, and put their Patients on a Course of _Alteratives_.\r\n\r\n_Smooth_. Sir _John_, we all wish for Cordials and Restoratives; we own\r\nthey are wanting; but I am afraid a Time of War and Confusion is not the\r\nproper Season for administering them.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I am much more afraid, Mr. _Smoothwell_, that you have\r\nlearnt a Language newly imported from _Court_. _Confusion_, if you mean\r\nhere at Home, there is none; and as for the _War_, I don’t think it\r\nwou’d or cou’d go on more ingloriously and scandalously than it has\r\nsince the Commencement of it, should our State Physicians alter their\r\nPractice.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Scandalously as it has been conducted, it has cost us more than\r\nthe most successful and best managed War.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Our last _Foraging_ Campaign stood us dearer than that of\r\n_Blenheim_; and shou’d we have one or two more such parading Summers, to\r\npot goes the _Sinking Fund_.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I shudder at the Thoughts of _re-mortgaging_ that only Hope\r\nwe had of seeing one Day our Trade and Industry exonerated from the\r\nClogs that oppress them. The _Fund_, which should be sacred, has been\r\ntoo often made free with; but the Incroachments upon the Purpose of it\r\nbeing temporary only, it had no very bad Effect; whereas the Case would\r\nbe otherwise, should they be perpetual.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. And because it will have that ruinous Consequence, you’ll see\r\nviolent unhallow’d Hands laid on that darling Hopes of our People.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Why the D——l don’t our Sages give Lotteries of six Millions,\r\ninstead of six hundred Thousand? There are Fools enough in _England_ to\r\nfill them.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Another destructive Way of raising the Supplies. There is no\r\nMethod more injurious to Trade than Lotteries in general; but when\r\nmanaged as our late ones have been, they become essentially a public\r\nNusance.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. You mean the _sharing_ out Tickets and Chances?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I do. Never was any Invention more destructive of Industry.\r\nThe poor _Industrious_, whom it is the Policy of all Nations to cherish\r\nand encourage, are by this _sharing Traffick_, exposed to inevitable\r\nDestruction. Who but the Poor will buy an Eighth or _Sixteenth_ of the\r\nChance of a Ticket? The Rich will deal in whole Tickets; but ’tis the\r\npoor Industrious only that ruin themselves to be in Luck’s Way, as they\r\nterm it. ’tis this poor but useful Class of the People only, that game\r\nat 30 _per Cent_. more Disadvantage than the richer Drones. No\r\nTemptation should be thrown in the Way of the Industrious; but on the\r\nContrary, all hurtful Incentives should be removed. If you will tempt\r\nthem to the Hazard Table, let them play upon the Square. Bring the Price\r\nof Tickets down to their Level; and let not the Jews, Sharpers, and\r\nDrones of the Nation be permitted to make a Property of them. But why\r\nmight not the Sums raised the two last Years by way of Lottery, be as\r\nwell brought into the _Exchequer_ by any other Means?\r\n\r\n_Over_. But no Means would so effectually draw off the Attention of the\r\nPublic from our Misery and impending Danger. And whatever some idle\r\nFolks may think, they tell me ’tis one of the principal _Arcana’s_ of\r\nthe Cabinet, to contrive artfully, that is imperceptibly, to draw off\r\nthe public _Attention_ from the Conduct of _Superiors_. You can’t\r\nconceive how close and out of Sight these State Spiders spin their Webs.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. But I can very well conceive that the People have Arms long\r\nand strong enough to reach and sweep those Webs clear away whenever they\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Ah! Sir _John_, where have the People you brag so much of, hid\r\ntheir Brooms and Brushes for many Years past?\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Behind the Clouds of _Corruption_ and _Hypocrisy_, where they\r\nare like to remain much longer, or I am mistaken.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Mr. _Blunt_, it gives me a Concern to see you continue your\r\nDiffidence of your best Friends. You shall find, that neither\r\n_Corruption_ nor _Hypocrisy_ will stand in the Nation’s Way to\r\nHappiness, if those whom you deem _England_’s Friends can help it.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. As Jealousy is said to spring from Love, _Diffidence_ may be\r\nsaid to be founded in Friendship. Mr. _Blunt_ hopes he has no Reason to\r\nsuspect your _Intention_, but dreads you have put it out of your Power\r\nto serve the Public. You may have perceived, Mr. _Broadbottom_, during\r\nthe whole Conversation, that your Friends apprehend this _Coalition_ as\r\nyou call it, or _Ingraftment_ as we express it, will answer no Purpose\r\nof the People, who groan under the pressure of heavy Taxes, a vast Debt,\r\nDecay of Trade, the Yoke of Penal Laws, and those worst Y——s of all, the\r\n_Septennial_ and the Corruption of their ——s. In short, they dread your\r\nbeing over-reach’d by your more experienc’d Partners, or rather your\r\nbeing jostled out of the Course, by the abler Jockeys of the C——t. If\r\nyou wou’d serve your Constituents in your present Situation, you must\r\nact with Caution.——\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. With _Honesty_, you should say rather. What Caution is\r\nnecessary in answering the Hopes of the People? They desire but what is\r\nabsolutely for their Safety. They expect no more than has been often\r\nsolemnly promised them. And sure a Man that intends to be as good as his\r\nWord need not pick out every Step of his Way.\r\n\r\n_Over_. The Ground about C——t, they say, is d——d slippery.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. And for that Reason I would not have had our Friends get upon\r\nit before they had secured their Footing there. See what is become of\r\nthe late infamous _Deserters_ for want of such Precaution.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Let us draw no invidious Inferences from the Examples of a\r\nCrew that are now as despicable as they are odious to the whole Nation.\r\nA Crew that can’t claim even the Merit of being intentionally upright.\r\nThey did not so much as attempt keeping Faith with the People.\r\n\r\n_Over_. But they kept it religiously with the _Barn_ Keeper.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. I can’t say who was to be _indulged_ by the War, but sure I am\r\nthe Weight of it is grievously felt all over the Body politic.——Mr.\r\n_Broadbottom_, you have been lately at Court, pray what do they think\r\nthere of the War? Are we like to get out of it with Honour? in short,\r\nare we like to get out of it at all?\r\n\r\n_Over_. Out of it at all!——The D——l, you would not have us serve an\r\nApprenticeship to the War, as we do to our P——ts?\r\n\r\nSir _John_. If it be no better manag’d than it has been hitherto, I\r\ndon’t see why this War might not last much longer than seven Years.\r\n\r\n_Over_. I’ll tell you why it can’t, because we shan’t be able to\r\nmaintain it so long. By mortgaging the _Sinking Fund_ we may hold out\r\nthree or four Years pretty tolerably; but after that, souse we go to\r\n_Mint_ or _State-bills_ at 50 _per Cent_. Discount, as in France in old\r\n_Lewis_ XIV. his Days.\r\n\r\n_Rose_. Gentlemen, however, will consider, that we can’t get out of the\r\nWar as easily as out of an Assembly Room in the Times of our Horse\r\nRaces.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. I am sure it would be towering Madness to continue it on the\r\nsame Footing it has been carried on hitherto. The _Dutch_ should come in\r\nfor a full equal Proportion of the Expence, or I would not have a\r\nRed-coat left in _Flanders_.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Let the Cheesemongers look to their Barrier and be d——n’d, if\r\nthey don’t come down Guinea for Guinea, and Shilling for Shilling with\r\nus towards preserving it.\r\n\r\n_Over_. _Blunt_, if you would curse the _Dutch_ effectually, you must\r\nwish them undamm’d.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Damn’d or undamm’d let ’em be, before Old _England_ wades out\r\nof her Depths to hold them up by the Chin.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Let us hope for the best. They may hear Reason, they may see\r\ntheir Interest when painted by so masterly a Hand as is now intrusted\r\nwith the Pencil.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. If Wit, Eloquence, Politeness, Frankness and Integrity,\r\ncould move a _Dutchman_, I should not doubt of that great Man’s Success;\r\nbut as nothing but _Self-interest_ can engage either his Heart or\r\nAttention, I fear his L——p won’t be able to persuade that _selfish_\r\nPeople to think it for their Interest to declare War against _France_\r\nand _Spain_ at the critical Time that we are at Variance with those\r\nCrowns. We are to consider this Juncture as the Harvest Season of the\r\n_Dutch_. All the Markets we are shut out from by the War, are open to\r\nthem by a Neutrality. But what I believe weighs not a little with them,\r\nis, that they dread embarking with us ever since they perceived that the\r\nViews of our Statesmen have tended more towards _H——r_ than _England_.\r\n’Tis that observable Bias to a _Foreign Interest_ that will deter the\r\n_States-General_, if my Lord _C——_ does not succeed in his Embassy.\r\n\r\n_Broad_. Perhaps they may conceive better Hopes from the new\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nSir _John_. Perhaps they might, had the Administration been _new_. But\r\nas it is no more than an old Garment patch’d with new Cloth, I fear the\r\n_Dutch_ will hardly alter their Plan on any Assurances such a motley\r\nM——y can give them. They may think, and perhaps too truly, that the same\r\nMeasures will be follow’d, the same _Interest_ be pursued, since the\r\nMajority, and the chief in Office of the A——n, are of the old Stamp. And\r\nthey as truly may think, that neither Harmony nor Success can attend\r\nCounsels jarring between two different separate _Interests_. While the\r\nInterest of _H——r_ clashes with that of _England_, we must neither\r\nexpect Harmony with the _Dutch_, nor Success in our Wars.\r\n\r\n_Over_. Nor in any thing else, I think. Would to God we could join that\r\nprecious _Manor_ to the _Orcades_, or send it adrift to _Lapland_ or the\r\n_North Cape_.\r\n\r\n_Blunt_. Since we can do neither, would to God our Statesmen would shew\r\nthemselves to be _Englishmen_!\r\n\r\n_Over_. Since we are got in the praying Strain, let us all pray that our\r\n_new_ M——y, or at least those lately _ingrafted_ upon the _old_, may not\r\nbecome as arrant _H——ns_ as their grafted Predecessors, the late\r\n_Deserters_. Let us all say, _Amen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _FINIS_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n    ○ Missing or obscured punctuation was silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Typographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation were made consistent only\r\n      when a predominant form was found in this book.\r\n    ○ Text that was in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).",
