V.--MAY, 1864.--No. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLETTER NO. V. OF HON. ROBERT J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON, 10 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly,\r\n_February 8th, 1864_.\r\n\r\nIn my third and fourth letters on American finances and resources, the\r\nfollowing comparisons were instituted: Massachusetts and New Jersey,\r\nFree States, with Maryland and South Carolina, Slave States; New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, Free States, with Virginia, Slave State; Rhode Island,\r\nFree State, with Delaware, Slave State; Illinois, Free State, with\r\nMissouri, Slave State; the Free States of 1790, with the Slave States of\r\nthat day; the Free States of 1860, with the Slave States of that date.\r\nThese comparisons were based on the official returns of the Census of\r\nthe United States, and exhibited in each case and in the aggregate the\r\nsame invariable result, the vastly superior progress of the Free States\r\nin wealth, population, and education.\r\n\r\nI will now institute one other comparison, Kentucky, slaveholding, with\r\nOhio, a Free State.\r\n\r\nKentucky--population in 1790, 73,077; Ohio, none. 1800: Kentucky,\r\n220,955; Ohio, 45,365. 1860: Kentucky, 1,155,684; Ohio, 2,339,502. We\r\nmust institute the comparison from 1800, as Ohio was a wilderness in\r\n1790, when Kentucky had a population of 73,077. In Kentucky, the ratio\r\nof increase of population from 1800 to 1860 was 527.98 per cent., and in\r\nthe same period in Ohio 5,057.08. (Table 1, Census 1860.) Thus from 1800\r\nto 1860 Ohio increased in nearly tenfold the ratio of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWEALTH.--By Tables 33 and 36, Census of 1860, the value of the product\r\nof 1859 was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Ohio,                   $337,619,000\r\n\r\n  Kentucky,                115,408,000\r\n\r\n  _Per Capita._\r\n\r\n  Ohio,                       $144 31\r\n\r\n  Kentucky,                     99 92\r\n\r\nThus is it, that, while in 1790 and 1800 Kentucky was so very far in\r\nadvance of Ohio, yet, in 1860, so vast was the advance of Ohio as\r\ncompared with Kentucky, that the value of the product of Ohio was nearly\r\ntriple that of Kentucky, and, _per capita_, much more than one third\r\ngreater. No reason can be assigned for these remarkable results, except\r\nthat Kentucky was slaveholding, and Ohio a Free State.\r\n\r\nTheir area is nearly the same, and they are adjacent States; the soil of\r\nKentucky is quite equal to that of Ohio, the climate better for crops\r\nand stock, and the products more various.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the actual results in 1860, but if Kentucky had increased\r\nin population from 1800 to 1860 in the same ratio as Ohio, Kentucky then\r\nwould have numbered 11,175,970, or nearly ten times her present\r\npopulation; and if the product had been the same as in Ohio, _per\r\ncapita_, the value would have been $1,612,804,230, or more than fourteen\r\ntimes greater than the result. Thus it is demonstrated by the official\r\nTables of the Census of the United States, that if Kentucky had\r\nincreased in wealth and population from 1800 to 1860 in the same ratio\r\nas Ohio, the results would have been as follows:\r\n\r\nKentucky: population in 1860, 11,175,970; actual population in 1860,\r\n1,155,684; value of products in 1860, $1,612,804,230; actual value in\r\n1860, $115,408,000.\r\n\r\nSome attempt has been made to account for these marvellous results, by\r\nstating that Ohio has a border on one of the lakes, and Kentucky has\r\nnot. But to this it may be replied, that Kentucky borders for twice the\r\ndistance on the Ohio River, has a large front on the Mississippi River,\r\nand embraces within her limits those noble streams, the Cumberland and\r\nTennessee Rivers, making, together with the Big Sandy, Licking,\r\nKentucky, Green, and Barren Rivers, the natural advantages of Kentucky\r\nfor navigation, superior to those of Ohio. But a conclusive answer to\r\nthis argument is found in the fact that, omitting all the counties of\r\nOhio within the lake region, the remainder, within the valley of the\r\nOhio River, contain a population more than one half greater than that of\r\nthe whole State of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nLANDS.-The farm lands, improved and unimproved, of Ohio, in 1860, were\r\nworth $666,564,171. The number of acres 20,741,138, value per acre\r\n$32.13. (Census of 1860, p. 197, Table 36.) The farm lands of Kentucky,\r\nimproved and unimproved, were worth $291,496,953, the number of acres\r\n19,163,276, worth per acre, $15.21. (_Ib._) Difference in favor of Ohio,\r\n$375,067,165. But if to this we add the difference between the value of\r\nthe town and city lots and unoccupied lands of Ohio and Kentucky, the\r\nsum is $125,009,000, which added to the former sum ($375,067,165) makes\r\nthe difference in favor of Ohio $500,076,165, when comparing the value\r\nof all her lands with those of Kentucky. We have seen that the value of\r\nthe products in 1860 was, Ohio $337,619,000, Kentucky $115,408,000. But\r\nthese products embrace only agriculture, manufactures, the mines, and\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nWe have no complete tables for commerce in either State, but the canals\r\nand railroads are as follows (Census of 1860, No. 38, pp. 225, 226,\r\n233): Ohio: Miles of railroad, 3,016.83; cost of construction,\r\n$113,299,514. Kentucky: Miles of railroad, 569.93; cost of construction,\r\n$19,068,477. Estimated value of freight transported on these railroads\r\nin 1860: Ohio, $502,105,000; Kentucky, $48,708,000. On the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1864, the number of miles of railroad in operation in Ohio was\r\n3,356.74, costing $130,454,383, showing a large increase since 1860,\r\nwhile in Kentucky there was none. (Amer. R. R. Journal, p. 61, vol. 37.)\r\nCanals in 1860 (Census Table 39): Ohio, 906 miles; Kentucky, two and a\r\nhalf miles. These Tables all prove how vast has been the increase of the\r\nwealth of Ohio as compared with Kentucky.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine some of the educational statistics.\r\n\r\nBy Census Table 37, giving the newspapers and periodicals in the United\r\nStates in 1860, the whole number of that year was 4,051, of which only\r\n879 were in the Slave States; total number of copies circulated that\r\nyear in the United States, 927,951,548, of which number there were\r\ncirculated in the Slave States only 167,917,188. This Table shows the\r\ntotal number of newspapers and periodicals published in Ohio in 1859 was\r\n340, and the number of copies circulated that year in that State was\r\n71,767,742. In Kentucky, the number of newspapers and periodicals\r\npublished in 1859 was 77, and the number of copies circulated that year\r\nwas 13,504,044, while South Carolina, professing to instruct and control\r\nthe nation, had a circulation of 3,654,840, although South Carolina, in\r\n1790, had a population of 249,073, when Ohio was a wilderness, and\r\nKentucky numbered only 73,077.\r\n\r\nAs regards education, we must take the Tables for the Census of 1850,\r\nthose for 1860 not having been yet published.\r\n\r\nBy Table 144, Census of 1850, the total number of pupils in public and\r\nprivate schools, colleges, and academies, was for that year as follows:\r\nOhio, 502,826. Kentucky, 85,914. Percentage of native free population\r\nwho cannot read or write (Table 155), Ohio 3.24; Kentucky, 9.12; Slave\r\nStates, native white adults who cannot read or write, ratio 17.23; Free\r\nStates, 4.12. (Table 157.) If we include slaves, more than one half the\r\nadults of the Slave States cannot read or write. Indeed, it is made by\r\nlaw in the Slave States a crime (severely punished) to teach any slave\r\nto read or write. These Tables also show that in South Carolina, the\r\ngreat leader of secession, (including slaves) more than three fourths of\r\nthe people can neither read nor write. Such is the State, rejoicing in\r\nthe barbarism of ignorance and slavery, exulting in the hope of reviving\r\nthe African slave trade, whose chief city witnesses each week the\r\nauction of slaves as chattels, and whose newspapers, for more than a\r\ncentury, are filled with daily advertisements by their masters of\r\nrunaway slaves, describing the brands and mutilations to which they have\r\nbeen subjected; that passed the first secession ordinance, and commenced\r\nthe war upon the Union by firing upon the Federal flag and garrison of\r\nSumter. Yet it is the pretended advocates of peace that justify this war\r\nupon the Union, and insist that it shall submit to dismemberment without\r\na struggle, and permit slavery to be extended over nearly one half the\r\nnational territory, purchased by the blood and treasure of the nation.\r\nSuch a submission to disintegration and ruin--such a capitulation to\r\nslavery, would have been base and cowardly. It would have justly merited\r\nfor us the scorn of the present, the contempt of the future, the\r\ndenunciation of history, and the execration of mankind. Despots would\r\nhave exultingly announced that 'man is incapable of self-government;'\r\nwhile the heroes and patriots in other countries, who, cheered and\r\nguided by the light of our example, had struggled in the cause of\r\npopular liberty, would have sunk despairingly from the conflict. This is\r\nour _real offence_ to European oligarchy, that we will crush this foul\r\nrebellion, extinguish the slavery by which it was caused, make the Union\r\nstronger and more harmonious, and thus give a new impulse and an\r\nirresistible moral influence and power to free institutions.\r\n\r\nLet me recapitulate some of the facts referred to in these letters, and\r\nestablished by the Census of the United States.\r\n\r\nArea of the United States, 3,250,000 square miles, exceeding that of all\r\nEurope--all compact and contiguous, with richer lands, more mineral\r\nresources, a climate more salubrious, more numerous and better harbors,\r\nmore various products, and increasing in wealth and population more\r\nrapidly than any other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   _Miles._\r\n  Our ocean shore line, including\r\n  bays, sounds, and rivers,\r\n  up to the head of tide\r\n  water                             33,663\r\n\r\n  Lake shore line                    3,620\r\n\r\n  Shore line of Mississippi River\r\n  and its tributaries above tide\r\n  water                              35,644\r\n\r\n  Shore line of all our other rivers\r\n  above tide water is                49,857\r\n\r\n                             Total, 122,784\r\n\r\nOur country, then, is better watered than any other, and has more\r\nnavigable streams, and greater hydraulic power.\r\n\r\nWe have completed since 1790, 5,782 miles of canal, costing\r\n$148,000,000; and 33,860 miles of railroad (more than all the rest of\r\nthe world), costing $1,625,952,215. (Amer. R. R. Journal, 1864, No.\r\n1,448, vol. 37, p. 61.)\r\n\r\nOur land lines of telegraph exceed those of all the rest of the world,\r\nthe single line from New York to San Francisco being 3,500 miles. Our\r\nmines of coal, according to Sir William Armstrong, the highest British\r\nauthority, are thirty-two times as great as those of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnnual product of our mines of gold and silver, $100,000,000, estimated\r\nat $150,000,000 per annum by our Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice, when the Pacific railroad shall be completed.\r\n\r\nPublic lands unsold, belonging to the Federal Government, 1,055,911,288\r\nacres, being 1,649,861 square miles, and more than thirty-two times the\r\nextent of England.\r\n\r\nImmigration to the United States from 1850 to 1860, 2,598,216, adding to\r\nour national wealth during that decade $1,430,000,000.\r\n\r\nEducation--granted by Congress since 1790 for the purposes of public\r\nschools--two sections (1,280 acres) in every township (23,040 acres), in\r\nall 1,450,000,000 acres of public lands; one eighteenth part given,\r\nbeing 80,555,555 acres, worth at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre,\r\n$100,694,443--the real value, however, was much greater.\r\n\r\nGranted by Congress for colleges and universities, 12,080,000 acres,\r\nincluding 3,553,824 given by the Federal Government to the State of\r\nTennessee, worth, at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre, $15,100,000,\r\nwhich is much below their true value.\r\n\r\nTotal in public lands granted by Federal Government for education,\r\n92,635,555 acres; minimum value, $115,794,443.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, after full payment of the entire principal and interest of the\r\npublic debt, there remained in the Federal Treasury a surplus of\r\n$38,000,000, of which about one half, $19,000,000, was devoted to\r\neducational purposes.\r\n\r\nTotal Federal appropriations since 1790 for education, $134,794,443.\r\n\r\nThis is exclusive of the many millions of dollars expended by the\r\nFederal Government for military and naval schools, etc., at West Point,\r\nWashington, Annapolis, and Newport. Besides these Federal donations,\r\nthere has been granted by States, Territories, counties, towns, and\r\ncities of the Union for education, since 1790 (partly estimated)\r\n$148,000,000. Grand total by States and Federal Government appropriated\r\nin the United States since 1790, for education, $282,794,443. This is\r\nindependent of numerous private donations for the same purpose, that by\r\nMr. Girard exceeding $1,500,000, and that by Mr. Smithson exceeding\r\n$500,000. It is then a fact that the Governments of the United States,\r\nState and Federal, since 1790, have appropriated for education more\r\nmoney than all the other Governments of the world combined during the\r\nsame period. This is a stupendous fact, and one of the main causes of\r\nour wonderful progress and prosperity. We believe that 'knowledge is\r\npower,' and have appropriated nearly $300,000,000, during the last\r\nseventy-four years, in aid of the grand experiment. We believe that 'man\r\nis capable of self-government,' but only when educated and enlightened.\r\nWe believe that the power and wealth and progress of nations increase in\r\nproportion to the education and enlightenment of the masses. We believe\r\nin intellectual as well as machine and muscular power, and that when the\r\nmillions are educated, and work with their heads as well as their hands,\r\nthe progress of the nation will be most rapid. Our patent office is a\r\nwonderful illustration of this principle, showing on the part of our\r\nindustrial classes more valuable inventions and discoveries, annually,\r\nthan are produced by the workingmen of all the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n  _Population._\r\n\r\n  In 1790,      3,922,827\r\n  In 1800,      5,305,937\r\n  In 1810,      7,239,814\r\n  In 1820,      9,638,191\r\n  In 1830,     12,866,020\r\n  In 1840      17,069,453\r\n  In 1850,     23,191,876\r\n  In 1860,     31,445,080\r\n\r\nRATIO OF INCREASE.--From 1790 to 1800, 35.02; from 1800 to 1810, 36.45;\r\nfrom 1810 to 1820, 33.13; from 1820 to 1830, 33.49; from 1830 to 1840,\r\n32.67; from 1840 to 1850, 35.87; from 1850 to 1860, 35.59. Thus it\r\nappears (omitting territorial acquisitions) that our ratio of increase\r\nwas much greater from 1850 to 1860 than during any preceding decade.\r\nThis was the result of augmented immigration, which is still to go on\r\nwith increased power for many years. Making allowance for all probable\r\ncontingencies, and reducing the decennial increase from 35.59 to three\r\nper cent. per annum, our able and experienced Superintendent of the\r\nCensus, in his last official report, of 20th May, 1862, gives his own\r\nestimate of the future population of the United States:\r\n\r\n  1870,      42,328,432\r\n  1880,      56,450,241\r\n  1890,      77,263,989\r\n  1900,     100,355,802\r\n\r\nThat, in view of our new Homestead law--our high wages--the extinction\r\nof slavery--increased confidence in our institutions--and augmented\r\nimmigration, these results will be achieved, can scarcely be doubted. As\r\npopulation becomes more dense in Europe, there will be an increased\r\nimmigration to our Union, and each new settler writes to his friends\r\nabroad, and often remits money to induce them to join him in his Western\r\nhome. The electric ocean telegraph will soon unite Europe with America,\r\nand improved communications are constantly shortening the duration of\r\nthe voyage and diminishing the expense. Besides, this war has made us\r\nmuch better known to the European _masses_, who, everywhere, with great\r\nunanimity and enthusiasm sustain our cause, and, with slavery\r\nextinguished, will still more prefer our institutions.\r\n\r\nFrom all these causes there will be an augmented exodus from Europe to\r\nAmerica, when our rebellion is suppressed, and slavery overthrown.\r\nBesides, the President of the United States now proposes appropriations\r\nof money by Congress in aid of immigration, and such will become the\r\npolicy of our Government. We have seen the official estimate made by our\r\nSuperintendent of the Census, but if we take the ratio of increase of\r\nthe last decade, the result would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  1870,      42,636,858\r\n  1880,      57,791,315\r\n  1890,      78,359,243\r\n  1900,     106,247,297\r\n\r\nThe estimate of the Superintendent is, therefore, six millions less than\r\naccording to the ratio from 1850 to 1860, and much less than from 1790\r\nto 1860.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that if, as densely settled as Massachusetts, our\r\npopulation would exceed 513,000,000, or if numbering as many to the\r\nsquare mile as England, our inhabitants would then be more than twelve\r\nhundred millions, the estimate of 100,000,000 for the year 1900 cannot\r\nbe regarded as improbable.\r\n\r\nOur national wealth was\r\n\r\n  in 1850,       $7,135,780,228\r\n\r\n  In 1860,      $16,159,616,068\r\n\r\n  Increase from 1850 to 1860, 126.45 per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the same rate of increase for the four succeeding decades, the result\r\nwould be:\r\n\r\n  In 1870,    $36,593,450,585\r\n  In 1880,     82,865,868,849\r\n  In 1890,    187,314,053,225\r\n  In 1900,    423,330,438,288\r\n\r\n  _Tonnage._\r\n\r\n  In 1841,               1,368,127 tons.\r\n  \"  1851,               3,772,439 \"\r\n  \"  1861,               5,539,812 \"\r\n\r\n  At the same rate of increase as from 1851 to 1861, the result would be:\r\n\r\n  In 1871,             8,134,578 tons.\r\n  \"  1881,            11,952,817 \"\r\n  \"  1891,            17,541,514 \"\r\n  \"  1901,            25,758,948 \"\r\n\r\nTotal number of copies of our newspapers and periodicals circulated in\r\nthe United States in 1860, 927,951,548, exceeding that of all the rest\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nLet us now recapitulate the results from our Census, founded on a\r\ncomparison of the Slave and Free States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.--Free State.

As\r\nregards education, also, we see that the ratio in favor of the Free\r\nStates is more than four to one in 1850 (4.12 to 17.23), and, in 1860,\r\nmore than five to one (3.21 to 17.03). And even as regards agricultural\r\nproducts, we have seen that those of the Free States were $2,527,676,000\r\nper annum, and of the Slave States only $862,324,000. The value of the\r\nlands of the Free States was $25.19 per acre, of the Slave States only\r\n$10.46 per acre; the product of the improved lands of the Free States\r\nwas $26.68 _per acre_ and of the Slave States $11.55, while, _per\r\ncapita_, the result was $131.48 to $70.56.\r\n\r\nThese facts prove how much greater the crops of the Slave States would\r\nbe, if their farms (including cotton) were cultivated by free labor. It\r\nis also thus demonstrated how completely the fertile lands of the South\r\nare exhausted and reduced in value by slave culture. Having thus proved,\r\ndeductively, the ruinous effects of slavery, I will proceed, in my next\r\nletter, inductively, to exhibit the causes which have produced these\r\nremarkable results.\r\n\r\n                                                         R.

WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAENONE:\r\n\r\nA TALE OF SLAVE LIFE IN ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe day wore quietly on, like any other day; for the confusion and\r\nturmoil of the ovation were already a half-forgotten thing of the past,\r\nand Rome had again subsided into its usual course: in the earlier hours,\r\na city of well-filled streets, astir and vocal with active and vigorous\r\ntrade and labor; then--as the noontide sun shed from the brazen sky a\r\nmolten glow, that fell like fire upon the lava pavement, and glanced\r\nfrom polished walls until the whole atmosphere seemed like a furnace--a\r\ncity seemingly deserted, except by a few slaves, engaged in removing the\r\ntriumphal arches hung with faded and lifeless flowers, and by a soldier\r\nhere and there in glistening armor, keeping a lonely watch; and\r\nagain--as the sun sank toward the west, and, with the lengthening\r\nshadows, the intensity of the heat diminished--a city flooded with\r\nwealth and fashion, pouring in confused streams hither and thither,\r\nthrough its broadest avenues and forums--groups of idlers sauntering\r\nalong to watch the inoccupation of others, and with the prospective bath\r\nas the pretence for the stroll--matrons and maidens of high degree, with\r\nattendants following them--a rattle of gayly caparisoned chariots, with\r\nfootmen trotting beside the wheels--guards on horseback--detachments of\r\npraetorian soldiers passing up and down--here the car of a senator of the\r\nbroad purple--there the mounted escort of a Syrian governor--all that\r\ncould speak of magnificence, wealth, and authority, at that hour\r\nthronged the pavement.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Vanno palace, AEnone joined herself to this moving concourse.\r\nAt her side walked one of her bondwomen, and, at a pace or two behind,\r\nproperly attired, and armed only with a short sword, strode the armor\r\nbearer. Thus attended, she pressed forward along the Appian Way toward\r\nthe outskirts of the city--past broad palaces and villas, with\r\nencircling gardens and open paved courts--past shrubberies, fish ponds,\r\nand statue-crowned terraces--past public baths, through whose broad\r\ndoorways the people swarmed by hundreds, and whose steps were thronged\r\nwith waiting slaves; now stopping until the armor bearer, running to the\r\nfront, could make a passage for her through some crowd denser than\r\nordinary--then gliding onward with more rapid pace, as the way became\r\nclearer--and again arresting herself for a moment as the stream of\r\npeople also tarried to watch the approach of the gorgeous chariot and\r\nrichly uniformed guards of the emperor Titus Vespasian. At length,\r\nturning the corner of a pillar-porticoed temple, which stood back from\r\nthe street, and up the gentle ascent of whose steps a concourse of\r\npriests and attendants were forcing a garland-decked bullock,\r\nunconscious of the sacrificial rites which awaited him within, she stood\r\nbeyond the surging of the crowd and in a quiet little street.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow avenue, in whose humble architecture brick took the\r\nplace of stone; but by no means mean or filthy, like so many of the\r\nstreets of similar width in the central portion of the city. Stretching\r\nout toward the open country, and not given up to merchandise or slave\r\nquarters, its little houses had their gardens and clustering vines about\r\nthem, supplying with the picturesque whatever was wanting in\r\nmagnificence, and evidencing a pleasant medium between wealth and\r\npoverty. The paved roadway was clean and unbroken; and far down as the\r\neye could reach no life could be seen, except a single slave with a\r\nfruit basket balanced upon his head, and near him a group of children at\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nPassing down this street, AEnone came to a spot where one of the great\r\naqueducts which supplied the city, crossed the roadway diagonally with a\r\nsingle span. At the right hand stood a small brick house, built into the\r\nnearest arch so snugly that it seemed as though its occupants could\r\nalmost hear the gurgling of the water flowing overhead from the hills of\r\nAlbanus. Like the other houses in its neighborhood, it had a small\r\ncourtyard in front, planted with a shrub or two. This was the home of\r\nher father, the centurion Porthenus. Stopping here, she was about to\r\nenter without warning, according to her usual custom, but as she\r\nadvanced, a dwarf, whom she recognized as the same which that morning\r\nhad so eagerly presented himself for notice in the front of her\r\nhusband's captives, sprang forward, grinned his recognition of the armor\r\nbearer, made another grimace expressive of mingled respect and\r\nadmiration for herself, threw open the door, and ushered her in with an\r\noutburst of ceremonious pride befitting an imperial reception.\r\n\r\nAt a back window of the house, from whence the line of aqueduct could be\r\nseen for some distance leaping houses and streets in its undeviating\r\ncourse to the centre of the city, sat the centurion. He was a man of\r\nmedium height, short necked, and thick set, with blunted features and\r\ngrizzled hair and beard. Two of the fingers of his left hand were\r\nwanting, and a broad scar, the trophy of a severe skirmish among the\r\nAlemanni, crossed his right cheek and one side of his nose, giving him\r\nan expression more curious than pleasing. His general appearance was\r\nafter the common type of an old, war-worn soldier, rough and\r\nunscrupulous by nature, hardened by camp life and dissipation, grown\r\ncruel by excess of petty authority, overbearing with his inferiors,\r\njovial and complaisant with his equals, cringing to his superiors, and\r\nwith an air of discontent overlaying every other expression, as though\r\nhe was continually tortured with the belief that his success in life had\r\nnot equalled his merits. As AEnone entered, he was bending over a shield,\r\nand earnestly engaged in burnishing its brazen mouldings. At his side\r\nleaned a short sword, awaiting similar attention, and in a rack beside\r\nhim were a number of weapons of different varieties and sizes, which had\r\nalready submitted to his restorative skill, and now shone like glass.\r\n\r\nHearing her light step, he looked up, arose, flung the shield into a\r\ncorner, and, with a roar, as though ordering a battalion, called out to\r\nthe grinning dwarf, who had followed her in:\r\n\r\n\"Ho there, ape! A seat for my daughter, the wife of the imperator\r\nSergius Vanno!\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf sprang forward and dragged out a seat for her; having done\r\nwhich, he seemed about to yield to his curiosity and remain. But the\r\ncenturion, disapproving of such freedom, made a lunge at him with the\r\nsmall sword, before which the dwarf retired with a precipitate leap, and\r\njoined the bondwoman and armor bearer outside. Then the father, being\r\nleft alone with his daughter, embraced her, and uttered such words of\r\nwelcome as his rough nature suggested.\r\n\r\nAs regarded his intercourse with her, perhaps the most noticeable traits\r\nwere the mingled reverence and familiarity with which he treated her. It\r\nseemed as though he was actuated by an ever-pervading consciousness that\r\nher exalted position demanded the observance of the deepest respect\r\ntoward her; but that this feeling was connected in his mind with an\r\nunceasing struggle to remember that, after all, she was his own child,\r\nand as such was not entitled to any undue consideration from him. Upon\r\nthe present occasion, he first timidly touched her cheek with his lips\r\nand uttered a gentle and almost courtly salutation; but immediately\r\nrecollecting himself, and appearing to become impressed with the belief\r\nthat his unwitting deference was unworthy of the character of a father,\r\nhe proceeded to atone for the mistake by a rough and discomposing\r\nembrace, and such a familiar and frolicksome greeting as none but a camp\r\nfollower would have felt flattered with. Then, seating himself before\r\nher, he commenced his conversation in a rude and uncouth tone, and with\r\nrather a forced affectation of military bluntness; from which, however,\r\nas his eye dwelt upon the richness of her apparel and his mind began to\r\nsuccumb to the charm of her native refinement, he gradually and\r\nunconsciously subsided, in turn, into his former soft and deferential\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n'And so the imperator Sergius Vanno has returned,' he said, rolling upon\r\nhis tongue, with evident satisfaction, that high-sounding title--once\r\nthe acknowledged appellation of a conqueror, but now claimed as a right\r\nby the imperial line alone, and no longer elsewhere bestowed except as\r\nan informal and transitory compliment. 'It was a splendid ovation, and\r\nwell earned by a glorious campaign. There is no one in all the Roman\r\narmies who could have managed it better.'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with unconscious inconsistency, he immediately began to\r\nshow wherein the campaign could have been improved, and how many gross\r\nmistakes were visible in every portion of it--how the force of Mutius\r\nshould have been diverged more in advancing inland--how, in the battle\r\nalong the shore, the three-oared galleys of Agricola should have been\r\ndrawn up to support the attack--the consequence of this omission, if the\r\nleading cohort had met with a repulse--and the like. All this he marked\r\nout upon the floor with a piece of coal, taking but little heed that\r\nAEnone could not follow him; and step by step, in the ardor of criticism,\r\nhe advanced so far that he was soon ready to prove that the campaign had\r\nbeen most wofully misconducted, and was only indebted to accident for\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n'But it is of little use for me to talk, if I cannot act as well,' he at\r\nlength concluded, rising from the floor. 'And how could I act any part,\r\nplaced as I am? The father of the wife of the imperator Sergius Vanno\r\nshould be the leader of a cohort rather than of a mere century; and be\r\notherwise lodged than in this poor place. Then would they listen to\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke bitterly and enviously, exhibiting in his whole tone as well as\r\nin his words his besetting weakness. For a while AEnone did not answer.\r\nIt was as far from her duty as from her taste and pleasure to remind\r\nhim, even if she could have done so to his comprehension, that her\r\nhusband had already advanced him as far as was possible or fitting, and\r\nhad otherwise provided for him in various ways as well as could\r\nreasonably be expected. The views of the centurion were of a far\r\ndifferent nature. In giving his daughter to the patrician he had meanly\r\nintended thereby to rise high in life--had anticipated ready promotion\r\nbeyond what his ignorance would have justified--had supposed that he\r\nwould be admitted upon an equal social footing among the friends of\r\nSergius, not realizing that his own native roughness and brutishness\r\nmust have forbidden such a connection--had dazzled his eyes too wilfully\r\nwith pictures of the wealth and influence and glory that would fall to\r\nhis lot. As long, therefore, as so many of those gilded imaginings had\r\nfailed in their promise, it seemed as nothing to him that Sergius, in\r\nthe first flush of admiration for the daughter, had removed the father\r\nfrom rough provincial to more pleasing and relaxing urban duties, had\r\npurchased him a house befitting his station, and had lightened his\r\ncondition in various ways.\r\n\r\n'But we are gradually doing better,' AEnone said at length, striving to\r\ncheer him by identifying her fortunes more nearly with his own, 'This is\r\na finer place than we had to live in at Ostia. Think how narrow and\r\ncrowded we were then. And now I see that we have a new slave to open for\r\nus, while at Ostia we had only old Mitus. Indeed, we are very\r\ncomfortable.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay,' growled the centurion; 'a new slave--a dwarf or idiot, or what\r\nnot--just such a creature as would not bring five sestertia in the\r\nmarket; and, therefore, the imperator has cast him to me, like a bare\r\nbone to a dog. Tell him I thank him for the gift. And in this matter it\r\nhas been with me as always heretofore--either no luck at all, or too\r\nmuch. How often have I not passed a campaign without taking a prisoner,\r\nwhile they fell in crowds to all around me? And when at last I gained my\r\nshare, when was it ever of any value to me, being hundreds of miles from\r\na market? And here it is the same again. For months, no slave at all;\r\nand then all at once there are two, and I shall be,eaten out of my\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\n'Two, father?'\r\n\r\n'Listen to me. No sooner did your honored lord send me this dwarf, than\r\narrives Tisiphon of the twelfth cohort. He had long owed me a slave; and\r\nnow that a captive, poor and feeble, and likely to die, had fallen into\r\nhis hands, he thought it a fair opportunity to acquit himself toward me.\r\nBut for once Tisiphon has cheated himself. The slave he brought was weak\r\nand sick, but it was only from want of food and rest. The fellow will\r\nrecover, and I will yet make much of him. Would you see him? Look out of\r\nthe back window there. He will turn out a fine slave yet, and, if this\r\ndwarf had not come, would be right pleasing to me. But two of them! How\r\nshall I find bread for both?'\r\n\r\nAEnone walked to the window, and leaned out. The courtyard behind was but\r\nlimited in size, containing a few squares of burnt brick arranged for\r\npavement around a small plot of grass at the foot of a single plane\r\ntree. The slave of whom the centurion spoke was seated upon this plot,\r\nwith his back against the tree, and his head bent over, while, with\r\nvacant mind, he watched the play of a small green lizard. As she\r\nappeared at the window, he raised his eyes toward her, then dropped them\r\nagain upon the ground. It was hardly, in fact, as much as could be\r\ncalled a look--a mere glance, rather, a single tremor of the drooping\r\nlid, a mute appeal for sympathy, as though there had been an inner\r\ninstinct which, at that instant, had directed him to her, as one who\r\ncould feel pity for his trouble and desolation. But at that glance,\r\njoined to something strangely peculiar in the captive's figure and\r\nattitude, a nervous thrill shot through AEnone's heart, causing her to\r\nhold her breath in unreasoning apprehension; a fear of something which\r\nshe could not explain, a dim consciousness of some forgotten association\r\nof the past arising to confront her, but which she could not for the\r\nmoment identify. And still she looked out, resisting the impulse of\r\ndread which bade her move away, fixing a strained gaze upon the captive,\r\nin a vain struggle to allay, by one moment of calm scrutiny, that\r\nphantom of her memory which, act as she might, would not be repressed,\r\nbut which each instant seemed to expand into clearer certainty before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'Do you see him? Does he appear to you a worthy slave?' cried the\r\ncenturion.\r\n\r\n'A worthy slave, indeed,' she answered, in a low tone, feeling compelled\r\nto make some response.\r\n\r\nAt her voice, the captive again raised his head, and looked into her\r\nface; not now with a hasty, timid glance, but with the full gaze of one\r\nwho believes he has been spoken to, and waits for a renewal of the\r\nquestion. And as she met the inquiring look, AEnone turned away and sank\r\nback in terror and dismay. She knew it all, now, nor could she longer\r\ndeceive herself by vain pretences or assurances. The instinct which, at\r\nthe first had filled her soul with that unexplained dread, had not been\r\nfalse to her. For that glance, as it now rested upon her with, longer\r\nduration and deeper intensity, too surely completed the suggestion\r\nwhich, at the first it had faintly whispered to her, flashing into her\r\nheart the long-stifled memories of the past, recalling the time when, a\r\nfew years before, she had sat upon the rock at Ostia, and had gazed down\r\nupon eyes lifted to meet her own with just so beseeching an appeal, and\r\ntelling her too truly that she stood again in the presence of him to\r\nwhom she had then promised her girlish faith, and whom she had so long\r\nsince looked upon as dead to her.\r\n\r\n'I will call him in,' said the centurion, 'and you can see him closer.'\r\n\r\n'Nay, nay, father; let him remain where he is,' she exclaimed, in\r\nuncontrollable dread of recognition.\r\n\r\n'Ha! art not afraid, girl?' demanded the old man. 'He can do no hurt,\r\neven were he stronger; and now that he is weak, a child could lead him\r\nwith a string. Come hither, sirrah!'\r\n\r\nThe captive arose, smoothed down his tunic, and, obediently entering the\r\nhouse, awaited commands; while AEnone, with as quiet movement as\r\npossible, shrunk, into the most distant corner of the room. What if he\r\nshould recognize her, and should call upon her by name, not knowing her\r\nchanged position, or recollecting his own debasement into slavery? What\r\nexplanation other than the true one could she give to account for his\r\naudacity, and save him from the chastisement which the offended\r\ncenturion would prepare to bestow upon him? This was but a momentary\r\nfear, however, since she felt that the increasing glow of evening, added\r\nto her own alteration by dress, and the certainty that he would not\r\nexpect to meet her thus, found a sure protection against recognition, as\r\nlong as she took care not to risk betrayal by her voice or manner. And,\r\nperhaps, after all--and her heart lightened somewhat at the thought--it\r\nmight be that her reason had too freely yielded to an insane fancy, and\r\nallowed her to be deceived by a chance resemblance.\r\n\r\n'How is he called?' she inquired, disguising her voice as thoroughly as\r\nshe could. The instant she had spoken she would have retracted her\r\nwords, if possible, from the mere fear lest her father, in his response,\r\nmight mention her name. But it luckily chanced that the centurion did\r\nnot do so.\r\n\r\n'How is he called? Nay, that thing I had not thought to ask as yet. Your\r\nname, slave?'\r\n\r\n'Cleotos.'\r\n\r\nAt the word, the blood again flew back to her heart. There could now no\r\nlonger be a doubt. How often had she repeated that name endearingly, in\r\nthose early days of her first romance in life!\r\n\r\n'Cleotos,' said the centurion. 'It is a brave name. There was once a\r\nleader of a full phalanx with that name, and he did well to the empire.\r\nIt is, therefore, scarcely a name for a slave to bear. But we will talk\r\nsome other time about that. It is of thine appearance now, that we will\r\nspeak. Is he not, after all, a pleasing youth? Did Tisiphon so surely\r\ndeceive me as he intended, when he gave the man to me? See! there is but\r\nlittle brawn and muscle to him, I grant; and therefore he will not make\r\na good gladiator or even spearman; but he has a comely shape, which will\r\nfit him well for a page or palace usher. And, therefore, I will sell him\r\nfor such. He should bring a good price, indeed, when the marks of his\r\ntoil and sickness have gone off from him, and he has been fattened into\r\nbetter condition. But two of them!' continued the centurion, suddenly\r\nrecurring to his former source of grief. 'How can I fatten him when\r\nthere are two of them? How find bread for both? And yet he is not so\r\nvery thin, now. I will light a lamp, daughter, for it has grown quite\r\ndark, and you shall come nearer and examine him.'\r\n\r\n'Nay! nay!' exclaimed AEnone, in hurried resistance of this new danger.\r\n'Not now. I am no judge of the merits of captives, and it is getting\r\nlate. I know that my lord will be expecting me, and perchance will be\r\nvexed if I delay.'\r\n\r\n'Be it so, then,' responded the other. 'And as it is dark, it is not\r\nbefitting that you should go without escort. Take, therefore--'\r\n\r\n'I have the armor bearer for my escort, father.'\r\n\r\n'It is something, but not enough,' said the centurion. 'Enough for\r\nsafety, but not for dignity. Remember that, while on the one hand you\r\nare the wife of the imperator Sergius Vanno, you are also a daughter of\r\nthe house of Porthenus--a family which was powerful in the far-off days\r\nof the republic, long before the house of Vanno had begun to take root,'\r\nhe continued, in a tone of pride. For then, as now, poverty consoled\r\nitself for its privations by dreams--whether well or ill founded, it\r\nmattered but little--of grandeurs which had once existed; and it was one\r\nof the weaknesses of the centurion to affect superiority of blood, and\r\ntry to believe that therein he enjoyed compensations beyond anything\r\nthat wealth could bestow.\r\n\r\n'Of the house of Porthenus,' he repeated, 'and should therefore be\r\nsuitably attended. So let this new slave follow behind. And take, also,\r\nthe dwarf. He is not of soldierly appearance, but for all that he will\r\ncount as one more.'\r\n\r\nFearful of offending her father by a refusal, or of encountering\r\nadditional risks of recognition by a more prolonged conversation at the\r\ndoorway, now brightened by the light of the newly risen moon, AEnone\r\nhastily assented, and started upon her homeward route. Clinging closely\r\nto the side of her bondwoman, not daring to look back for a parting\r\nadieu to her father, who stood at the door leaning upon his sword, and\r\ngrimly smiling with delight at fancying his child at last attended as\r\nbecame a scion of the house of Porthenus--not regarding the\r\nhalf-smothered oaths and exclamations of contempt with which the armor\r\nbearer behind her surveyed his two new companions upon guard--she\r\npressed rapidly on, with the sole desire of reaching her house and\r\nsecluding herself from further danger of recognition.\r\n\r\nThe moon rose higher, silvering the city with charms of new beauty,\r\ngleaming upon the surface of the swift-rolling Tiber, giving fresh\r\nradiance to the marble palaces and temples, adding effect to whatever\r\nwas already beautiful, diminishing the deformity of whatever was\r\nunlovely, even imparting a pleasant aspect of cheerfulness to the lower\r\nquarters of the city, where lay congregated poverty and dishonor and\r\ncrime. The Appian Way no longer swarmed with the crowd that had trodden\r\nit an hour ago. The priests had completed the sacrifice and left the\r\ntemple, the bathers had departed, the slaves no longer lingered upon the\r\nporticos, and the riders in gay chariots no more were to be seen. A\r\ncalmer and more quiet occupancy of the street had ensued. Here and there\r\na soldier paced to and fro, looking up at the moon and down again, at\r\nthe glistening river, and thought, perhaps, upon other night watches in\r\nGallia, when just such a moon had gleamed upon the silver Rhone. Here\r\nand there two lovers, loth to abandon such a pleasant light and warmth,\r\nstrolled slowly along, and, as lovers have ever done, bade the moon\r\nwitness their vows. But not the river or the moonlight did AEnone now\r\nlinger to look upon, nor lovers' vows did she think about, as she glided\r\nhastily toward her own home. The peacefulness and quiet of nature found\r\nno response in her heart. Her only emotion was one of dread lest each\r\nray of light might shine too brightly upon her--lest even her walk might\r\nbetray her--lest every sound might be an unguarded recognition from the\r\npoor, unconscious captive behind her.\r\n\r\nAt length she reached her home, passed up the broad flight of steps in\r\nfront, and stood panting within the doorway. A momentary pause ere she\r\nentered, and then, unable to continue the control which she had so far\r\nmaintained over herself, she turned and cast one hasty, curious glance\r\nbelow. The two new slaves of the centurion stood side by side in the\r\nstreet, gazing up at the palace walls, the dwarf with a grin of almost\r\nidiotic glee, the other with a grave air of quiet contemplation. But\r\nwhat was that sudden look of startled recognition that suddenly flashed\r\nacross the features of the latter? Why did his face turn so ghastly pale\r\nin the moonlight, and his limbs seem to fail him, so that he grasped his\r\ncompanion's arm for support? AEnone shrank terrified into the obscurity\r\nof the doorway.\r\n\r\nBut in an instant she recovered her self-possession. It must be that he\r\nhad been faint or giddy, nothing more. It could not have been\r\nrecognition that had startled him from his earnest contemplation, for he\r\nhad not been looking toward her, but, with his body half turned away,\r\nhad been gazing up at the highest story of the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having avoided the immediate peril of recognition, AEnone turned\r\ninto the palace. Even there, however, her disordered fancy pictured\r\ndangers still encompassing her. How, after all, could she feel sure that\r\nshe had not been known? During that clear moonlight passage along the\r\nAppian Way, what revelations might not have been made by a chance look\r\nor gesture! At the very first she had almost stumbled upon the truth\r\nmerely through the magic of one upward glance of the eye of the wearied\r\nslave; why, then, might she not have unconsciously revealed herself to\r\nhim by even a wave of the hand or a turn of the instep, or by some other\r\napparently trivial and unimportant motion? And if so, at what instant\r\nmight he not forget his fallen condition, and disregard not only his\r\nsafety but her reputation, by pressing into the palace and claiming the\r\nright of speech with her? Rasher deeds were not seldom done under the\r\npromptings of desperation. Trembling beneath the sway of such\r\nimaginings, each footfall that resounded in the hall seemed like the\r\nlight and buoyant step of him who had trodden with her the sands of\r\nOstia--each figure that passed by bore, for the instant, the outline of\r\nhis form--even at the open window the well-known face seemed to peer in\r\nat every corner and watch her.\r\n\r\nThis paroxysm of terror gradually passed away, but was succeeded by\r\nother fancies equally productive of inquietude. What if the captive,\r\nhaving recognized her, had whispered his story to the companions with\r\nwhom he had walked! He would surely not do so if he still loved her; but\r\nwhat if his love had ceased, and he should be meanly desirous of\r\nincreasing his own importance by telling how he, a slave, had been the\r\nchosen lover of the proudly allied lady before him? Nay, he would never\r\nact thus, for it would be a baseness foreign to his nature; and yet have\r\nnot men of the most lofty sense of honor often fallen from their\r\noriginal nobility, and revelled in self-degradation? And it somehow\r\nseemed as though, at the last, the dwarf had looked up at her with a\r\nstrangely knowing leer. And was it merely her imagination that made her\r\nthink there was a certain sly approach to undue familiarity in the\r\nusually deferential deportment of the armor bearer?\r\n\r\nWith the next morning, however, came more composed reflections. Though\r\nthe forebodings of the evening had naturally tinged her dreams with\r\nsimilar vague imaginings of coming trouble, yet, upon the whole, her\r\nsleep had brought rest, and the bright sunlight streaming in at the\r\nwindow drove away the phantoms which, during the previous gloom, had so\r\nconfusedly disported themselves in her bewildered brain. She could now\r\nindulge in a more cheering view of her situation; and she felt that\r\nthere was nothing in what had transpired of sufficient importance, when\r\ncoolly weighed and passed upon, to make her anxious or afraid.\r\n\r\nIn a sick and travel-worn slave she had recognized one to whom, in her\r\nyounger days, she had plighted her faith, and who had, in turn, given\r\nhis faith to her. He was now a captive, and she had become one of the\r\nnobles of the empire. But his evil lot had not been of her procuring,\r\nbeing merely one of those ill fortunes which are cast broadly over the\r\nearth, and whose descent upon any one person more than upon another can\r\nbe attributed to destiny alone. Nor, in accepting her high position, had\r\nshe been guilty of breach of faith, for she had long awaited the return\r\nof her lover, and he had not come. And through all those years, as she\r\nhad grown into more mature womanhood, she had vaguely felt that those\r\nstolen interviews had been but the unreasoning suggestions of girlish\r\nromance, too carelessly indifferent to the exigencies of poverty and\r\ndiverse nationality; and that, if he had ever returned to claim her,\r\nmutual explanation and forgetfulness could have been their only proper\r\ncourse. There was, therefore, nothing for which she could reproach\r\nherself, or for which he could justly blame her, were he to recognize\r\nher as the wife of another man.\r\n\r\nBut there was little chance, indeed, that such a recognition could take\r\nplace. Certainly, now that, apart from her troubled and excited fears of\r\nthe previous day, she more deliberately weighed the chances, she felt\r\nassured that in her rapid passage through the evening gloom, nothing\r\ncould have betrayed her. And it was not probable that even in open\r\ndaylight and in face-to-face encounter with him he would be likely to\r\nknow her. She had recognized him almost at a glance, for not only was\r\nhis dress composed of the same poor and scant material which had served\r\nhim years before, but even in form and feature he seemed unchanged, his\r\nslight frame having gained no expansion as his manhood had progressed,\r\nwhile his face retained in every line the same soft and almost girlish\r\nexpression. But with herself all things had altered. It was not merely\r\nthat the poorly clad maiden who, with naked feet, well-tanned hands, and\r\ntangled and loosely hanging curls, had been wont to wander carelessly by\r\nthe shore of a distant bay, had become a richly adorned matron of the\r\nimperial centre. Beyond all that, there was a greater change, which,\r\nthough in its gradual progress almost inappreciable to one who had\r\nwatched her day by day, could not but be remarked after a lapse of many\r\nyears. The darker hair, the softer complexion, the suave smile into\r\nwhich the merry laugh of girlhood had little by little subsided, the\r\nmore composed mien, replete with matronly dignity, the refinement of air\r\nand attitude insensibly resulting from long continued instinctive\r\nimitation, the superior development of figure--all these, as they were\r\nimprovements in her former self, were also just so many effective\r\ndisguises upon which she could safely rely, unless she were to provoke\r\ninordinate scrutiny by some unguarded action or expression. But all this\r\nshe would earnestly guard against. She would even put no trust in the\r\nnatural immunity of which her reason assured her, but would make\r\neverything doubly safe by totally refraining from any encounter with one\r\nwhose recognition of her would be so painful.\r\n\r\nThis she could do, and yet not fail in any friendly duty which the\r\nremembrance of their former love might enjoin upon her. Unseen in her\r\nretirement, she could watch over and protect him, now that in his sorrow\r\nand degradation he so greatly needed a friend. She could ameliorate his\r\nlot by numberless kindnesses, which he would enjoy none the less for\r\nbeing unable to detect their source. She would cunningly influence her\r\nfather to treat him with tenderness and consideration. And when the\r\nproper time arrived, and she could take her measures without suspicion,\r\nshe would herself purchase his freedom, and send him back rejoicing to\r\nhis native land. And when all this was done, and he should again have\r\nreached his home, perhaps she might then write to him one line to tell\r\nhim who it was that had befriended him, and that she had done so in\r\nmemory of olden times, and that now, when she was so far removed from\r\nhim, he should give her one kind thought, utter a prayer to the gods in\r\nher behalf, and then forget her forever.\r\n\r\nSo much for her security and her friendly duty. As for the feelings of\r\nher heart, she was at rest. Strong in self-confidence, she had no fear\r\nthat her mind could be influenced to stray from its proper path. It is\r\ntrue that during the previous evening, in the first tumult of troubled\r\nthought, she had felt a vague presentiment that a day of temptation\r\nmight be before her, not as the result of any deliberate choice upon her\r\npart, but rather as a cruel destiny to be forced upon her. But now the\r\ncurrent of her mind moved more clearly and unobstructedly; and she felt\r\nthat however chance might control the worldly prosperity of each one,\r\nthe will and strength to shape his own destiny, for good or evil, are\r\nstill left to him unimpaired. Away, then, with all thoughts of the past.\r\nIn her heart there could be but one affection, and to her life there\r\ncould be but the one course of duty, and in that she would steadfastly\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nStrengthened, therefore, with the well-assured belief that the impulsive\r\naffection of her youth had become gradually tempered by lapse of years\r\ninto a chaste and sisterly friendship, and that the pleasant memories\r\nwhich clustered about her heart and made her look back half regretfully\r\nupon those former days would be cherished only as the mere innocent\r\nrelics of a girlish romance, she felt no fear that her faith could be\r\nled to depart from its lawful allegiance. But aside from all this, there\r\nlurked within her breast an uneasy sense of being the holder of a great\r\nsecret which, in the end, would surely crush her, unless she could share\r\nits burden with another. In this desire for confidence, at least, there\r\ncould be no harm; and her mind rapidly ran over the array of her few\r\nfriends. For the first time in her life, perhaps, her isolation from\r\nclose and unfettered companionship with others was forced upon her\r\nattention, and her soul grew faint as she thought upon her dependence\r\nupon herself alone for comfort or advice. To whom, indeed, could she\r\nventure to pour out her heart? Not to her father, who, with unreasoning\r\nignorance and little charity, would coarsely form base conclusions about\r\nher, and would most likely endeavor to solve the problem by cruelty to\r\nthe unfortunate slave who had so unwittingly originated it. Not to any\r\nof those matrons of whom her rank made her the associate; and who, after\r\ngaining her confidence, would either betray it to others, or else,\r\nwrongly misconstruing her, and fancying her to be influenced by scruples\r\nwhich they might not have felt, would scarcely fail to ridicule and cast\r\ndisdain upon all the most tender emotions of her heart. And above all\r\nothers, not to her husband, to whom, if she dared, she would have wished\r\nto reveal everything, but who had, she feared, at the bottom of his\r\nsoul, a jealous and suspicious nature, which would be sure to take\r\nalarm, and cause him to look upon her story, not as a generous\r\nconfidence bestowed in the hope of comfort and assistance, but rather\r\nas a cunningly devised cover for some unconfessed scheme of wrong\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nBurdened by these reflections, AEnone slowly passed from her room into\r\nthe antechamber. Lifting her eyes, she there saw her husband standing at\r\nthe window, and, at the distance of a pace or two from him, a female\r\nfigure. It was that of a girl of about eighteen years, small, light, and\r\ngraceful. Her costume, though not in form such as belonged to the\r\nfreeborn women of Rome, was yet far superior in richness of material to\r\nthat usually worn by persons of low degree, and was fashioned with a\r\ntaste which could not fail to assist the display of her graceful\r\nperfection of form, indicated in part by the rounded lines of the\r\nuncovered neck and arms. As AEnone entered the room, Sergius advanced,\r\nand, taking her by the hand, said:\r\n\r\n'Yonder is a new slave for you--the present about which I yesterday\r\nspoke. I trust it will prove that during my absence I was not unmindful\r\nof you. It was at Samos that I obtained her. There, you may remember, we\r\ntarried, after taking the town and burning part of the fleet.'\r\n\r\nSamos! Where had AEnone heard that place mentioned? Searching into the\r\nrecesses of her memory, it at last flashed upon her. Was it not from\r\nSamos that he--Cleotos--had come? And was it fate that forced the\r\nrecollection of him ever upon her? She turned pale, but by a violent\r\neffort succeeded in maintaining her self-possession and looking up with\r\na smile of apparent interest upon her husband as he spoke.\r\n\r\n'She had nearly fallen the prey of one of the common soldiers,' he\r\ncontinued; 'but I, with a few pieces of gold, rescued her from him,\r\npicturing to myself the gratification you would feel at being so fitly\r\nattended. And that you might the better appreciate the gift, I have\r\nretained her till to-day before showing her to you, in order that you\r\nmight first see her recovered from the toil of travel and in all her\r\nrecovered beauty. A rare beauty, indeed, but of a kind so different from\r\nthine that your own will be heightened by the contrast rather than\r\ndiminished. How many sestertia I have been offered for her, how many\r\nhigh officers of my forces have desired to obtain her for service upon\r\ntheir own wives, I cannot now remember. But I have refused and resisted\r\nall, for I would that you should be known throughout all Rome by the\r\nbeauty of those in waiting about you, even as you are now known by your\r\nown beauty. Pray, accept of her, therefore, as your attendant and\r\ncompanion, for it would sorely disappoint me were you to reject such a\r\npleasing gift.'\r\n\r\n'Let it be as my lord says,' responded AEnone. 'And if I fail in due\r\nutterance of my thanks, impute it not to want of appreciation of the\r\ngift, but rather to inability of proper expression.'\r\n\r\nIt was with real gratitude that AEnone spoke; for, at the instant, a\r\nthought of cheering import flashed upon her, swelling her heart with\r\njoy, and causing her to welcome the captive girl as a gift from the\r\ngods. Here, perhaps, as though in direct answer to her prayer for\r\nsympathy, might be the one for whom her heart had been longing; coming\r\nto her, not laden with any of that haughty pride and ill-befitting\r\nknowledge with which the Roman world about her reeked, but rather as she\r\nherself had once come--with all her unstained provincial innocence of\r\nthought yet nestling in her shrinking soul--one, like herself, an exile\r\nfrom a lowly state, and with a heart filled with those simple memories\r\nwhich must not be too carelessly exposed--so seldom do they gather from\r\nwithout anything but cruel ridicule or cold lack of comprehension--one\r\nwhom she could educate into an easy intimacy with her own impulses and\r\nyearnings, and thus, forgetting all social differences, draw closer and\r\nnearer to her as a friend and confidant.\r\n\r\nAs she thus reflected, she felt the soft pressure of lips upon her left\r\nhand, which hung idly at her side, and, looking down, she saw that the\r\ncaptive girl had knelt before her, and, while lightly grasping her\r\nfingers, was gazing up into her face with a pleading glance. AEnone's\r\nfirst impulse was to respond with eager warmth to that humble appeal for\r\nprotection and friendship; and had it not been for the morbid fear she\r\nfelt lest her husband, who stood looking on, might chide such\r\nfamiliarity, or at the least might cast ridicule upon the feeling which\r\nprompted it, she would have raised the captive girl and folded her in\r\nher arms. As it was, the impulse was too spontaneous and sudden to be\r\nentirely resisted, and she held forth her other hand to lift the\r\nkneeling figure, when a strange, intuitive perception of something which\r\nshe could scarcely explain, caused her to withhold further action.\r\n\r\nSomething, she knew not what, in the attitude and expression of the\r\ncaptive before her, which sent her warm blood flowing back with a\r\nchilled current--something which told her that her hopes of the moment\r\nhad been smitten with decay as suddenly as they had been raised, and\r\nthat, instead of a friend, she had perhaps found an enemy. The full dark\r\neye yet gazed up at her with the same apparent moistened appeal for\r\nfriendly sympathy; but to AEnone's alarmed instinct it now seemed as\r\nthough behind that glance there was an inner depth of cold, calculating\r\nscrutiny. Still, almost unheeding the gentle gesture of the hand\r\nextended to raise her, the Greek knelt upon the floor, and, with an\r\nappearance of mingled timorousness and humility, laid her lips upon the\r\ngathered fingers; but now there appeared to be no natural warmth or glow\r\nin the pressure or real savor of lowliness in the attitude, but rather a\r\nforced and studied obsequiousness. For the instant AEnone paused, as\r\nthough uncertain how to act. Then, fearing to betray her doubts, and\r\nhoping that her startled instinct might have deceived her, she bent\r\nforward once more and raised the captive to her feet.\r\n\r\nIt had all been the work of an instant; passing so quickly that the\r\npause between the impulse and its completion could hardly have been\r\nnoticed. But in that instant a change had swept over the expressions of\r\nboth; and as they now stood opposite and gazed more intently upon each\r\nother, the change still progressed. The face of the young Roman matron,\r\nbut a moment before so glowing with sympathy and radiant with a\r\nnew-discovered hope of future happiness, now seemed to shrink behind a\r\nveil of despairing dread--the fear chasing away the joy as the shadow\r\nflits along the wall and banishes the sunlight; while, though every\r\nfeature of the Greek still seemed clothed with trembling humility, yet,\r\nfrom some latent depths of her nature, a gleam of something strangely\r\nwild and forbidding began to play upon the surface, and invest the\r\nmoistened eye and quivering lip with an undefinable repulsive harshness.\r\n\r\n'Your name?' said AEnone, rousing herself with exertion, as though from a\r\npainful dream.\r\n\r\n'Leta, my lady,' was the reply, uttered in a tone of despairing sadness,\r\nand with eyes again cast upon the floor.\r\n\r\n'Leta,' repeated AEnone, touched in spite of her forebodings by that\r\nguise of an unhappiness which might, after all, be real. 'It is a\r\nfair-sounding name, and I shall call you always by it. Poor girl! you\r\nare an exile from your native land, and I--I cannot call myself a Roman.\r\nWe must be friends--must we not?'\r\n\r\nShe spoke rather in the tone of one hoping against evil auguries than as\r\none indulging in any confident anticipations of the future. The Greek\r\ndid not answer, but again slowly raised her eyes. At first, as before,\r\nwith the same studied expression of pleading humility; but, as she\r\nglanced forward, and saw Sergius standing behind, and gazing at her with\r\nan admiration which he did not attempt to dissemble, a strange glow of\r\ntriumph and ambitious hope seemed to light up her features. And when,\r\nafter a hasty glance of almost responsive meaning toward Sergius, she\r\nagain looked into the face of the other, it was no longer with an\r\nassumption of humble entreaty, but rather with an expression of wild,\r\nsearching intensity. Before it the milder gaze of AEnone faltered, until\r\nit seemed as though the two had suffered a relative interchange of\r\nposition: the patrician mistress standing with troubled features, and\r\nwith vague apprehension and trembling in her heart, and as though\r\ntimorously asking for the friendship which she had meant to bestow; and\r\nthe captive, calmly, and with a look of ill-suppressed triumph, reading\r\nthe other's soul as though to learn how she could most readily wield\r\nsupremacy over her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'OUR DOMESTIC RELATIONS; OR, HOW TO TREAT THE REBEL STATES.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Atlantic Monthly_ for October, 1863, is an article with the\r\nabove caption, in which the author, we think, develops ideas and\r\ntheories totally at variance with the spirit of our Government, and\r\nwhich, if acted upon, and followed to their legitimate results, tend to\r\nsubvert that self-government which is the privilege and pride of the\r\nAmerican citizen. The result of his reflection is, that the States\r\nwhich, more conveniently than accurately, are termed the rebel States,\r\nhave practically become Territories, and as such are to be governed by\r\nCongress. Is this proposition true? Let us examine--not hastily, not\r\nrashly, not vindictively, or in a party spirit--but wisely,\r\nmagnanimously, and lovingly, and see if there be not a truer conclusion\r\nand one more in accordance with the spirit of our republican\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nWhen the rebel _States_ (?) passed their respective ordinances of\r\nsecession, what results flowed from the action? The political doctrine\r\nthat the union of the States is not a mere confederation of separate\r\nStates, but a consolidation, within the limits of the Constitution, of\r\nthe different States, otherwise independent, into _one nation_, is now\r\ntoo well established to remain a subject of debate. We are not,\r\ntherefore, members of a confederacy, but are a unit--one. It follows, as\r\na matter of course, that no State can withdraw or hide itself from the\r\ncontrol of the National Government. The ordinances of secession passed\r\nby the rebel States did not, therefore, affect the Federal authority.\r\nThe broad and just ground taken by President Lincoln in his Inaugural\r\nAddress was, that the rebel States were still _in_ the Union; and it is,\r\nwe apprehend, the only tenable ground of right upon which we can carry\r\non the war in which we are now engaged. The Constitution of the United\r\nStates requires (art. ii. sec. 3) that the President shall 'take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed.' When the present head of the\r\nexecutive came into office, in March, 1861, he found several of the\r\nStates, having already seceded on paper, seeking to perfect their\r\ntreason by 'the armed hand.' Lighthouses had been destroyed, or their\r\nbeacon fires--the sentinels of the sea--shrouded in darkness, custom\r\nhouses were given into rebel hands, the revenue cutters were\r\nsurrendered, and deed followed deed in this dark drama of treason, until\r\nit was consummated by firing upon the unarmed Star of the West, while\r\nshe was performing her errand of mercy, to relieve the hunger and\r\nreenforce the exhausted strength of the heroic little garrison of Fort\r\nSumter. The plain and immediate duty of the President was, therefore, to\r\ncall out the strength of the nation to assist him in 'taking care that\r\nthe laws be faithfully executed.' And this brings us to the proposition\r\nthat _the Government is not engaged in a war of conquest with another\r\nnation, but in enforcing the laws in what is already a part of the\r\nUnion_.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution (art. ii. sec. 2) makes the President the\r\n'commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of\r\nthe militia of the several States when called into the actual service of\r\nthe United States.' In the President, and in him alone, supremely, is\r\nvested the authority which is to conduct the course of war. Congress has\r\nthe war-making power, but war once brought into being (if we may be\r\nallowed the expression), the manner in which it shall be conducted rests\r\nwith the executive. It is, of course, to be conducted in accordance with\r\nthe laws of nations and of civilized warfare. The first step necessary\r\nto enable the President to enforce the laws in the seceded States is to\r\nput down the military power by which their execution is resisted. That\r\nis now being done. By the 'necessity of war,' then, the executive is\r\nauthorized to take such measures as may be necessary to put down the\r\nrebellion; and though no power is given him to appoint Governors over\r\nthe States in ordinary times, it _is_ given him, indirectly, but as\r\nsurely as if expressly granted, to be used in times of actual war, by\r\nthe clause of the Constitution which we have just quoted, making him\r\ncommander-in-chief of the national military force. Whenever the States,\r\nor any of them, cease to be debatable ground--that is, when the military\r\nforce of the rebellion is put down, the military necessity ceases, and\r\nwith it the authority of the President to appoint military governors.\r\nNor is there danger of encroaching upon the liberties of the nation;\r\nfor, as the power attaches to the President, not in his capacity as the\r\ncivil head of the nation, but as the military commander-in-chief, it\r\nceases the moment military opposition is overcome. The fear of the\r\n_Atlantic_ author would seem to be ill grounded, for we cannot believe\r\nthat any military force could be raised by a despotic executive who\r\nmight endeavor to place himself in absolute power, and we think there is\r\nlittle danger that the Government may 'crystallize into a military\r\ndespotism.' Would supplies be granted by Congress; or, if granted, would\r\nnot the people of a country which has sprung to arms only to defend a\r\n_free_ government, be strong enough to resist any single military\r\ndespot? Let the history of the present rebellion, in which a population\r\nof only eight millions, and that in the least defensible States of the\r\nUnion, has resisted for nearly three years the combined power of all the\r\nother States, with a population of more than twenty millions, answer the\r\nquestion. The _Atlantic_ writer admits the propriety of appointing\r\nmilitary governors in the cases of Mexico and California before the\r\nlatter was admitted as a State, but denies it in the cases of the rebel\r\nStates, because they are States, and therefore (as he says) within the\r\ncivil jurisdiction. But at the period to which we refer, Congress had\r\njurisdiction over both California and Mexico by the express provision of\r\nthe Constitution (art. iv. sec. 3), 'the Congress shall have power to\r\ndispose of and make all needful rules and regulations concerning the\r\nterritory or other property belonging to the United States.' If, then,\r\nthe power of the President be admitted in the two cases referred to, it\r\nis even stronger in the cases of the rebel States, where no such power\r\nis given to Congress. And further it would seem that the act of\r\nadmission to the Union would operate rather to take the Territory from\r\nunder the jurisdiction of Congress, and give the right of government\r\ninto the hands of the PEOPLE of the new State, even if their State\r\nofficers did seek to betray them into treason. Our author asserts that\r\n'there is no argument for military governors that is not equally strong\r\nfor Congressional governments; but we suspect his mistake here, as, in\r\nfact, his whole theory comes from his neglect to note that this\r\nappointing power attaches to the President, not as the civil head of the\r\nnation, but as military commander-in-chief under the necessity of war.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the argument on this point, it stands thus: Neither Congress\r\nnor the President has power under the civil head to institute\r\ngovernments of their own in the rebel States: that power must arise, if\r\nat all, under the head of military necessity, and must attach to the\r\ncommander-in-chief, viz., the President, and ceases the moment that\r\nnecessity ceases. In the authority quoted from Chancellor Kent by the\r\nauthor of the _Atlantic_, we find nothing to shake our argument; for,\r\nthough the power be, as the learned Chancellor says, 'to be exercised\r\nsubordinate to the legislative powers of Congress,' still it is an\r\nexecutive power, and must be exercised by--must emanate from--the\r\nPresident. The same learned authority, from whose lucid and fascinating\r\npages we enjoyed the first glimmerings of the 'gladsome light of\r\njurisprudence,' says (vol. i. p. 264): 'The command and application of\r\nthe public force, to execute the law, maintain peace, and resist foreign\r\ninvasion, are powers so exclusively of an executive nature, and require\r\nthe exercise of powers so characteristical of this department, that they\r\nhave always been _exclusively_ appropriated to it in every\r\nwell-organized government upon earth.' Taking this provision of the\r\nConstitution, so interpreted by Chancellor Kent, as vesting the power\r\n_exclusively_ in the executive, it only remains to be considered how far\r\nit is a necessity of war.\r\n\r\nIn all the rebel States there is a population, more or less dense, to be\r\nprotected and governed; but what can a civil authority accomplish when\r\nthe States are overrun by a military force which has so long defied the\r\npower of the army? Advancing as our armies conquer, and fleeing as they\r\nare overcome by the rebel hordes, it could accomplish nothing but its\r\nown ludicrous history and the fettering of the military power, which so\r\neminently requires one secret and independent will. How little a\r\nmilitary force so fettered by civil authorities could accomplish can\r\nhardly be fully realized but by those who, like the author, have\r\nsummered and wintered upon the 'dark and bloody ground' of the\r\nrebellion. But, it will be asked, how are the rebel States to be\r\ngoverned when the military power of the rebellion is crushed, and the\r\nauthority of the executive ceases with the necessity of war? No express\r\npower is given by the Constitution to Congress to govern any other\r\nterritory than the District of Columbia, the dockyards, lighthouses, and\r\nlands ceded to the United States for similar purposes, and the territory\r\nnot included in the several States, but belonging to the United States.\r\nUnder these three heads is included all the territory over which\r\nCongress can claim jurisdiction by direct grant; and, by the\r\nConstitution (Amendments, art. x.), 'the powers not delegated to the\r\nUnited States, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the\r\nStates respectively or to THE PEOPLE.' Unless, therefore, the rebel\r\nStates have lapsed into Territories, Congress can have no authority over\r\nthem, except the general powers which it may exercise over all the\r\nStates of the Union. The question then arises, and it seems to be purely\r\na legal one--have the rebel States lapsed into Territories?\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the doctrine maintained by our Government is,\r\nthat the rebel States have not, by their ordinances of secession,\r\nseparated themselves from the Union, but that they are still _in_ the\r\nUnion. The ordinances of secession are, like any other unconstitutional\r\nlaw, even supposing them to have been the will of the people (of which\r\nwe will speak hereafter), to be set aside by a competent tribunal, if\r\nbrought to the test at all. Their paper treason, then (to commit a\r\nsolecism), amounting only to so much waste of paper and ink, did the\r\novert act of firing upon the flag of the United States operate more\r\neffectually to destroy the State identity? If they are incapable of\r\nseparating themselves from the nation, and if, as is clearly the case,\r\nthere is no power vested in the General Government to expel them from\r\nthe Union, from what source does the power or act arise which destroys\r\ntheir identity? The rebel States are either _in_ the Union or _out_ of\r\nit. We cannot claim that they are in the Union for the purpose of\r\nenforcing submission, and then, when that object is accomplished, turn\r\nround and say they are out of it, and must be governed as Territories.\r\n\r\nBut it is a fixed fact, and history will so record it, that the voice of\r\nthe _people_ in the rebel States never concurred in the ordinances of\r\nsecession. In the few cases where they were submitted to the popular\r\nvote, force was used to awe that vote into acquiescence; while in most\r\ncases they never were submitted to the _form_ of such a vote; and why?\r\nBecause the leaders in treason dared not trust the voice of the people:\r\nthey knew too well that it would thunder a rebuke in their ears. They\r\nwere merely the act of the _individuals_ who were chosen as members of\r\nthe several Legislatures, and who, in betrayal of their trust, sought to\r\ncommit the States which they misrepresented to treason. In any one of\r\nthe States which we have solecistically termed rebel States, we venture\r\nto assert that, if fairly and fully taken, the vote of the people at any\r\ntime during the last five years, and now, would be, by a large majority,\r\nin favor of the Union. Wherever our armies have obtained a permanent\r\nfooting, the people have, almost unanimously, given their expression of\r\nattachment to the old flag. Shall, then, the treason of those\r\nindividuals who, for the time being, held the places of power in the\r\nrebel States, be construed to the prejudice of a whole people, who had\r\nno part nor lot in the crime, in face of the often declared law that a\r\nState cannot commit treason? If we turn to the fact that many, if not\r\nmost of the citizens of the rebel States, have done treasonable acts\r\nunder compulsion of those who were the leaders in the rebellion, we are\r\nmet, at the very threshold, by no less an authority than Sir William\r\nBlackstone, who says (Bl. Commentaries, book iv. p. 21): 'Another\r\nspecies of compulsion or necessity is what our law calls _duress per\r\nminias_, or threats and menaces which induce fear of death or other\r\nbodily harm, and which take away, for that reason, the guilt of many\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors, at least before the human tribunal. _Therefore,\r\nin time of war or rebellion, a man may be justified in doing many\r\ntreasonable acts by compulsion of the enemy or REBELS, which would admit\r\nof no excuse in the time of peace._' The fact that such violent\r\ncompulsion was and still is used to overawe the Union sentiment of the\r\nSouth is patent. It has been and still is the cry, coming up on every\r\nbreeze from that bloodstained land, that the leaders of the rebellion\r\nseek to crush, by whatever means, those who are\r\n\r\n'Faithful among the faithless found.'\r\n\r\nBut, supposing for the moment that the majority of the citizens of the\r\nrebel States are, of their own free will, participators in the\r\nrebellion; where is the grant of power to Congress to establish a\r\ngovernment in any of the rebel States? No clause of the Constitution\r\ngives it; and by the express terms of that instrument, 'all powers not\r\ngranted by it to the United States, nor prohibited to the States, are\r\nreserved to the States respectively or to THE PEOPLE.' But, while no\r\nsuch power is granted by the Constitution to the Federal Government, it\r\nis, we think, strictly forbidden by that clause of the instrument which\r\ndeclares that 'the United States shall guarantee to every State in this\r\nUnion a republican form of government.' Would this injunction be\r\ncomplied with if Congress were to establish, directly, a government of\r\nits own over the rebel States? Would it not rather be a transgression of\r\nthe provision? The essential nature of a republican government is that\r\nit is elective; but a Congressional government would be directly the\r\nreverse; for it takes the power from the hands of the people and places\r\nit in the hands of the national council. Mark the form of the\r\nexpression, too, that the republican form of government is to be\r\nguaranteed, not merely by Congress or the executive, but by the _United\r\nStates_; as if to pledge the whole power of the nation, of whatever\r\nkind, to protect this priceless blessing, through all coming time, to\r\nthe use and benediction of all ages. Notice, too, to whom the guarantee\r\nruns--not to the territory now composing the State, but to the State its\r\nvery self--_ei ipsi_; as if the Constitution could not contemplate such\r\na thing as a State being struck out of existence, under whatever phrase,\r\nwhether of 'State forfeiture,' 'State suicide,' or 'State abdication,'\r\neven if treason were attempted by those in power. The Constitution still\r\nterms it _a State_. Is not the present precisely the event, or rather\r\none of the events, which it contemplates and provides for? The doctrine\r\nof 'State Rights,' whether as contemplated and maintained by Calhoun in\r\nthe days of Nullification, or as declared by Jefferson Davis and his\r\ncompeers in treason, we abhor utterly, whenever and wherever it may lift\r\nits serpent head, and whether supported by Southern men with Southern\r\nprinciples, or by Northern men with no principles. But a true and\r\nindisputable doctrine of State Rights there is, which ought to be as\r\njealously maintained and guarded as the doctrine of National\r\nSovereignty. The _Atlantic_ author asserts that, because the State\r\noffices in the rebel States have been vacated, therefore Congress has\r\nthe authority to govern them, and intimates that all powers not reserved\r\nto the respective States belong to Congress, _because there is no other\r\nto wield them_. This is not true. Every power possessed of the Federal\r\nGovernment must be actually granted. It must attach to that Government,\r\nnot because it belongs to no other, but because it is granted by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nOur author quotes Mr. Phillimore as saying 'a state, like an individual,\r\nmay die, by its submission and the donation of itself to another\r\ncountry.' Very true; but the word _state_ must, in that sense, be\r\nequivalent to _nation_; and our author admits that a State cannot\r\nperform the first act necessary to be done in so giving itself away,\r\nviz., withdrawing itself from the Union. If, therefore, it cannot\r\nwithdraw itself from the authority of the Federal Government, very\r\nclearly it cannot donate itself to the self-styled Confederate\r\nGovernment. If a thief sell or give his ill-gotten possession to\r\nanother, it in no way affects the right of the owner. He cannot give\r\naway that which he does not own; and so of a State. Another error into\r\nwhich the _Atlantic_ author has fallen, is that, in assigning the three\r\nsources of Congressional power, 'ample and hospitable,' he enumerates as\r\none of them 'the necessity of the case;' but, as we have already seen,\r\nCongress possesses no powers but those expressly granted by the\r\nConstitution. If Congress may assert its authority in this instance,\r\nfrom the necessity of the case, and be itself the judge of that\r\nnecessity, when no authority is given by the instrument, which expressly\r\ndeclares that all powers not granted by it are reserved, where are we to\r\nfind a limit, and why may not that body assert itself in any number of\r\ninstances, until, at length, the rights of the States are wholly\r\nabsorbed by the overmastering power of the Federal Government? There is\r\nbut _one_ rightful source of authority to Congress, and that is the\r\nConstitution, which itself so declares, and which is the supreme law of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nBut the true course to be pursued is, we think, to allow the rebel\r\nStates (as indeed we cannot help doing) to be governed by the military\r\npower until such time as a civil government can be maintained, and then\r\nfor the whole Government of the United States, legislative, judicial,\r\nand executive, to stand by, as the constitutionally appointed guardian,\r\n_and permit_ THE PEOPLE _to elect their own State officers_. Whether the\r\nconventions of the people are called by law of Congress or by\r\nproclamation of the President, would seem to be immaterial, though the\r\nlatter seems the least cumbersome method. Thus the rebel States would\r\npass from rebel forms to constitutional ones, in a legal and formal\r\nmanner. Sooner or later this must be done, even if, for a time,\r\nprovisional governments are instituted; for no Congressional government\r\ncan be an elective government, and hence not a constitutional one,\r\nbecause the elective principle is necessary to a republican form of\r\ngovernment. But if, under the clause of the Constitution which enjoins\r\nupon the United States to guarantee a republican form of government to\r\neach State, conventions of the people be called to elect their own\r\nofficers, they are at once put in possession of their constitutional\r\nrights. And how can a State be _re_admitted to a Union which it has\r\nnever left?\r\n\r\nThe writer has no pet theory to maintain, but is, like the writer in the\r\n_Atlantic_, 'in search of truth;' and the views here expressed are the\r\nresult, not merely of closet reflection, but of observation and\r\nexperience in the seceded States, while 'marching under the flag and\r\nkeeping step to the music of the Union.' If only, through this baptism\r\nof blood, the nation, freed at last from the blighting curse of slavery,\r\nand purified into a better life, shall lift her radiant forehead from\r\nthe dust, and, crowned with the diadem of freedom, go on her glorious\r\nway rejoicing, the writer will count his past sufferings and shattered\r\nhealth only as the small dust in the balance compared with the priceless\r\nblessings of peace, freedom, and national unity, which they may have\r\ncontributed, however slightly, to purchase. Only to have contributed,\r\nhowever little, something for the peace--something for the\r\nglory--something for the permanence, beautiful and bright--of those\r\ninstitutions which are for America the pride of the past and the hope of\r\nthe future, will be a joy through life and a consolation in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUND BUILDER.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll over Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and other Western States--but\r\nchiefly over these--are the monumental remains of an ancient race, long\r\nanterior to the present race of Indians, concerning whom we have no\r\nother record than that which is afforded by their mounds, earthworks,\r\nfortifications, temples, and dwelling places. Even these cannot at first\r\nbe distinguished and identified the one from the other; and it takes a\r\nperson skilled in such lore to determine the character and uses of the\r\nvarious mounds and groups of mounds, which he meets with at all points,\r\nand in all directions, as he traverses the wilderness.\r\n\r\nI have lived a long time in the woods and prairies, following the\r\noccupation of a hunter, but with ulterior antiquarian and\r\nnatural-history objects and purposes. From the time when I first heard\r\nof the mounds, which was in the year 1836, when I entertained, in my\r\nchambers in New York, an old frontiersman from Chicago--a fine, brave\r\nfellow, whose whole life was a romance of the highest and noblest\r\nkind--I resolved that as soon as fortune should favor me with leisure\r\nand opportunity, I would make a first-hand investigation of these\r\ncurious antiquities, and try if I could render an intelligent exposition\r\nof their meaning. Twenty years passed away, and I was no nearer to the\r\naccomplishment of my purpose than I was in that notable year 1836, when\r\nthe apocalypse of the West and its mystic mound seals were first\r\nrevealed to me. At last, about four years ago, all things being\r\nfavorable, I struck my tents in the big city--the wonderful Arabian\r\nNights city of New York!-and, taking a sorrowful leave of my friends and\r\nliterary associates, I set off for the region round about the Black\r\nRiver in Wisconsin. Here, among the bluffs and forests, within hailing\r\ndistance of a prairie of some hundred thousand acres, I bought a\r\nwell-cultivated farm of two hundred and eighty acres, bounded on the\r\nsouth by a deep, romantic ravine, at the bottom of which ran a\r\ndelightful stream of water, full of trout, always cool and delicious to\r\ndrink, and never known to be dry even in the fiercest summer droughts. A\r\nlarge log cabin, with a chimney opening in the kitchen, capable of\r\nconveying the smoke and flames of half a cord of wood burning at once on\r\nthe hearthstones, and having other commodious conveniences, was my\r\nheadquarters, and I intended it to be my permanent home. But thereby\r\nhangs a tale--which, though interesting enough, and full of romantic and\r\nstartling episodes, I will not here and now relate, as being somewhat\r\nextraneous to the subject matter before us.\r\n\r\nI had no sooner made all the dispositions necessary to the good\r\nhusbanding of the farm, than I hired a half breed, well known in those\r\nparts, and subsequently a Winnebago Indian, to whose wigwam the half\r\nbreed introduced me at my request. And with these two, the one a\r\nveritable savage, and the other very nearly related to him, I set off\r\nwith a wagon, a yoke of oxen, a large tent, and abundance of provisions,\r\non a journey of mound discoveries.\r\n\r\nI have only space here to say that we traversed the whole of the north\r\nand west of the State of Wisconsin, and through the chief parts of\r\nMinnesota and Iowa; and that subsequently, about, eighteen months\r\nafterward, we visited the region of the Four Lakes, of which Madison is\r\nthe centre, where there are hundreds of mounds, arranged in nearly every\r\nform and of nearly every animal device, which we had found in our\r\nprevious travels.\r\n\r\nI made drawings of all the remarkable groups which I met with; and,\r\nwithout going into particulars, I may give you some idea of their\r\nlikelihood in the following summary: Mounds arranged in circles of three\r\ncircles, with a large earthwork in the inner one; the outer circle\r\ncontaining sixty mounds, the second thirty, the first fifteen. I\r\nexamined the earthwork, and found in it, about four feet below the\r\nsurface, remains of charcoal and charred bones, burnt earth, and\r\nconsiderable quantities of mica. It had evidently been an altar or\r\nsacrificial mound--and I afterward, upon examination, found many\r\nsuch--but they were always enclosed by other mounds; and these (the\r\nouter mounds) contained nothing but earth, although there was this\r\nremarkable peculiarity about them, that the earth of which they were\r\ncomposed was altogether of a different nature from the surrounding\r\nearth, and must have been brought to that spot, as the old Druids\r\nbrought the enormous blocks of stone which composed their temples and\r\naltars at Stonehenge, from an unknown distance.\r\n\r\nOther mounds were arranged in squares, triangles, and parallelograms.\r\nOthers, in a series of successive squares, about three feet apart,\r\nhaving an opening to the east and west, and terminating in a square of\r\nabout fourteen feet in the centre, where a truncated mound is sure to be\r\nerected.\r\n\r\nOthers, formed a good deal like a Minie rifle ball, but with a more\r\npointed apex, running on both sides of the earth effigy of a monstrous\r\nbear for upward of forty rods.\r\n\r\nOthers, shaped like an eagle with outstretched wings, having walls of\r\nearthwork two feet high, of oblong shape, and enclosed on all sides\r\nexcept at the east and west, where there are entrances of about four\r\nfeet in width.\r\n\r\nOthers, composed of hundreds of tons of earth, shaped like a tortoise,\r\nwith truncated mounds all around it.\r\n\r\nOthers, fashioned like men, and Titans at that, some lying prone upon\r\nthe prairie, others in the act of walking. The limbs clearly defined,\r\nthe body vast and well moulded, like a huge colossus. One near Baraboo,\r\nSauk County, Wisconsin, discovered by Mr. William H. Canfield, and\r\nreported to the Philosophical Society by Mr. Lapham, of Milwaukee, was\r\nvisited also by us. It is two hundred and fourteen feet in length; the\r\nhead thirty feet long, the body one hundred feet, and the legs\r\neighty-four. The head lies toward the south, and the motion (for he is\r\nrepresented in the act of walking) is westward. All the lines of this\r\nmost singular effigy are curved gracefully, much care having very\r\nclearly been bestowed upon its construction. The head is ornamented with\r\ntwo projections or horns, giving a comical expression to the whole\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nNear the old military road, about seven miles east of the Blue Mounds,\r\nin Dare County, Wisconsin, we found another man effigy. It lies in an\r\neast and west direction, the head toward the west, and the arms and legs\r\nextended. It is one hundred and twenty-five feet long, one hundred and\r\nforty feet from the extremity of one arm to that of the other. The body\r\nis thirty feet in breadth, and is most carefully moulded and rounded;\r\nthe head twenty-five feet; the elevation above the surface of the\r\nprairie nearly six feet.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the Wisconsin River, about four miles west of the\r\nvillage of Muscoda, we heard of and found another human effigy. Its\r\npeculiarity was that it had two heads, and they reclined with a certain\r\ngrace over the shoulders. The arms were not in proportion, nor fully\r\nrepresented. Length of body fifty feet, legs forty feet, arms one\r\nhundred and thirty feet; lying north and south, the head southward.\r\n\r\nOthers, a kind of hybrids, half man half beast or bird.\r\n\r\nOthers, representing birds with outstretched wings, like the forked-tail\r\nhawk or swallow.\r\n\r\nOthers, eagles without heads.\r\n\r\nOthers, coiled snakes, or outstretched snakes.\r\n\r\nOthers, elk or deer.\r\n\r\nClusters of mounds star shaped, seven in number, with the sun-shaped\r\nmound in the centre.\r\n\r\nOthers, representing mathematical symbols.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Black River, near the Ox Bow, are the remains of an\r\nelevated road, about three feet high and seven feet wide, extending for\r\nmiles, intersected near the river by the great Indian war path. The\r\nsettlers call it the Railroad, and it has all the appearance of a work\r\nof this nature, and is strongly and carefully built--a fine remain of\r\nthe old mound builders' time.\r\n\r\nLong lines of mounds, extending for scores and probably hundreds of\r\nmiles, nearly all of the same shape, varying in their distance from each\r\nother from one to four miles.\r\n\r\nCircular mounds of a base of two hundred feet, and a height of twenty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOthers, two hundred yards long, from ten to twenty feet wide, and from\r\ntwo to three feet high--these last, also, having an open space through\r\nthem, as if intended for an entrance gate.\r\n\r\nOthers, in the form of rabbits, badgers, bears, and birds; others, of\r\nunknown monstrous animals.\r\n\r\nWe examined in all thirty-nine mounds; and in one, at the very base, on\r\nthe floor of the natural earth upon which the mound was built (the soil\r\nof the mound being, as I said, always of a different character to the\r\nsurrounding soil) we discovered and carried away with us the perfect\r\nskeleton of a man, with a few arrow heads made of flint, and a tobacco\r\npipe, made also of stone, with a very small and narrow bowl, having a\r\ndevice on it like some of the hieroglyphic monsters of Egypt or old\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIn twelve we found skeletons, male and female, of the present race of\r\nIndians, with their bows and arrows, or, as was the case in four\r\ninstances, their rifles and knives and tobacco pipes; some of these last\r\nelaborately carved in red stone. In Iowa we dug into a large mound, and\r\ndiscovered fragments of an ancient pottery, with the colors burned into\r\nthe material, and various bones and skulls, arrow heads, and a flint\r\nknife, and saw.\r\n\r\nWe saw the painted rocks, also, on the Mississippi shores, near Prairie\r\ndu Chien--said to be of an immemorial age--and the questions, Who was\r\nthis old mound builder--whence did he come--when did he vanish from this\r\ncontinent? have haunted me ever since. That he was the primitive man of\r\nthis planet, I think there is good reason to believe. Go where we will,\r\nto what portion soever of the earth, we shall find these mound evidences\r\nof his existence. In Asia, Europe, Africa, and all along the backbone of\r\nthe American continent, he has established his record. Yet no one knows\r\nanything about him: all tradition even of him and of his works is lost.\r\nWhen Watkinson started from the middle of Asia to visit the newly\r\nacquired country of Russia--the beautiful, fruitful, invaluable country\r\nof the Amoor--he was confronted at the very outset by a cluster of seven\r\nof these very mounds, and his book, from that time forth, extending over\r\nthousands of miles, is full of descriptions of these unknown earthworks.\r\nI have no doubt they mark the progressive geographical movements of a\r\nrace of men who came from Asia. From Behring's Strait to the Gulf they\r\ncan easily be traced.\r\n\r\nBut I have said enough, and will stop here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUND BUILDER.\r\n\r\nWho art thou? old Mound Builder!\r\n    Where dost thou come from?\r\n    Womb of what country,\r\n    Womb of what woman\r\n      Gave birth to thee?\r\n      Who was thy sire?\r\n      Who thy sire's sire?\r\n    And who were his forbears?\r\n    Cam'st thou from Asia?\r\nWhere the race swarms like fireflies,\r\n    Where many races mark.\r\nAs with colored belts, its tropics!\r\n    What pigment stained thy skin?\r\n  Was it a red, or wert thou\r\n    Olive-dyed, or brassy?\r\n  Handsome thou couldst hardly have been,\r\n    With those high cheek-bones,\r\n  That mighty jaw, and its grim chops,\r\nThat long skull, so broad at the back parts,\r\n    That low, retreating forehead!\r\n      Doubtless thine eyes were dark,\r\n  Like fire-moons set in their sockets;\r\n      Doubtless thine hair was black,\r\n  Coarse, matted, long, and electric;\r\n  Thy skeleton that of a giant!\r\n    Well fleshed, well lashed with muscles,\r\n    As with an armor of iron;\r\nAnd doubtless thou wert a brave fellow,\r\n    On the old earth, in thy time.\r\n\r\n    I think I know thee, old Mole!\r\nEarth delver, mound builder, mine worker!\r\n  I think I have met thee before,\r\n  In times long since, and forgotten;\r\nMany thousands of years, it may be,\r\nOr ever old Noah, the bargeman,\r\nOr he, the mighty Deucalion,\r\n  Wroth with the world as he found it,\r\n  Uprose in a passion of storm\r\n  And smote with his fist the sluices,\r\n    The water sluices of Cloudland--\r\n  Locked in the infinite azure--\r\n    Drowning the plains and mountains,\r\n    The shaggy beasts and hybrids,\r\n The nameless birds--and the reptiles,\r\nMonstrous in bulk and feature,\r\nWhich alone were thy grim contemporaries.\r\n Here, in the State of Wisconsin,\r\n In newly discovered America,\r\n I, curious to know what secrets\r\n Were hid in the mounds of thy building,\r\n   Have gone down into their chambers,\r\n   Into their innermost grave-crypts,\r\n   Unurning dry bones and skulls,\r\n   Fragments of thy mortality!\r\n   Oftentimes near to the surface\r\n   Of these thy conical earth-runes,\r\n   --For who shall tell their secret?--\r\n   Meeting with strange interlopers,\r\n   Bodies of red Winnebagoes,\r\n   Each with its bow and its arrows,\r\n   Each with its knife and its war gear,\r\n   Its porphyry-carved tobacco pipe,\r\n   Modern, I know by the fashioning.\r\n       Often, I asked of them,\r\n   As they lay there so silently,\r\n     So stiff and stark in their bones,\r\n  What right they had in these old places,\r\nSacred to dead men of a race they knew not?\r\n        And oh! the white laughters,\r\n    The wicked malice of the white laughters\r\n        Which they laughed at me,\r\n    With their ghastly teeth, in answer!\r\n   Was never mockery half so dismal!\r\n   As if it were none of my business.\r\nNor was it; save that I liked grimly to plague them,\r\n   To taunt them with their barbarity,\r\nThat they could not so much as dig their own graves,\r\n   But must needs go break those of the dead race,\r\nTheir far superiors, and masters in craft and lore!\r\n   And bury themselves there, just out of sight,\r\n    Where the vulture's beak could peck them,\r\n     Were he so obscenely minded,\r\n And the wolf could scrape them up with his foot.\r\n\r\n     Curious for consideration\r\n    All this with its dumb recordings!\r\n     Very suggestive also,\r\n    The meeting of him, the first-born,\r\n     Who lived before the rainbow\r\n    Burst from the womb of the suncloud,\r\n  In the Bible days of the Deluge--\r\n     The meeting very suggestive\r\n  Of him, with the red Winnebago,\r\n   Such immemorial ages,\r\n     Cartooned with mighty empires,\r\n     Lying outstretched between them.\r\n   He, the forerunner of cities\r\n\r\n   --His mounds their type and rudiment--\r\n  And he, the fag-end of creation,\r\n  Meaningless sculpture of journeymen,\r\n   Doomed to the curse of extinction.\r\n     Curious, also, that I,\r\n  An islander from far-off Britain\r\n         Should meet them,\r\n     Or, the rude scrolls of them.\r\n    Both together in these wilds,\r\n  Round about the region of the Black River,\r\n     Cheek by jowl in a grave.\r\n\r\n   Who was the builder of the grave?\r\n    A primitive man, no doubt,\r\n    Of the stone era, it may be,\r\n   For of stone are his implements.\r\n  And not of metal-work, nor the device of fire.\r\n    He may have burrowed for lead\r\n     And dug out copper ore,\r\n  Dark-green as with emerald rust, from the mines\r\n  Long since forsaken, and but newly found\r\n  By the delvers at Mineral Point.\r\n  He, or his subsequents, issue of him,\r\n    I know not; and, soothe to say,\r\n        Shall never know.\r\n\r\n     Neither wilt thou ever know\r\n   Anything of me, old Mound Builder!\r\n Of the race of Americans, nothing,\r\n     Who now, and ever henceforth,\r\n   Own, and shall own, this continent!\r\n     Heirs of the vast wealth of time\r\n Since thou from the same land departed;\r\n New thinkers, new builders, creators\r\n   Of life, and the scaffolds of life,\r\n   For far-off grand generations!\r\n      This skull which I handle!--\r\n How long has the soul left it tenantless?\r\n And what did the soul do in its house,\r\n      When this roof covered it?\r\n Many things, many wonderful things!\r\n   It wrote its primeval history\r\n Is earthworks and fortifications,\r\n   In animal forms and pictures,\r\n   In symbols of unknown meaning.\r\n\r\n  I know from the uncouth hieroglyphs,\r\n     And the more finished records,\r\n   That this soul had a religion,\r\n     Temples, and priests, and altars:\r\n   I think the life-giver, the sun,\r\n     Was the god unto whom he sacrificed.\r\n      I think that the moon and stars\r\n     Were the lesser gods of his worship;\r\n     And that the old serpent of Eden\r\n     Came in for a share of devotion.\r\n\r\n     I find many forms of this reptile,\r\n       Scattered along the prairies,\r\n      Coiled on the banks of the rivers,\r\n     In Iowa, and far Minnesota,\r\n      And here and there, in Wisconsin.\r\n       Now he is circular,\r\n     Gnawing his tail, like the Greek symbol,\r\n      Suggesting infinite meanings\r\n      Unto the mind of a modern\r\n     Crammed with the olden mythologies.\r\n       Now, uncoiled in the sunlight,\r\n     He stretches himself out at full length\r\n     In all his undulate longitude.\r\n    His body is a constellation of mounds,\r\n           Artfully imitative,\r\n    From the fatal tail to the more fatal head.\r\n       Overgrown they are with grass,\r\n      Short, green grass, thick and velvety,\r\n          Like well cared-for lawns,\r\n      With strange, wild flowers glittering,\r\n       Made up of alien mould\r\n      Brought hither from distant regions.\r\n\r\n    Curiously I have considered them,\r\n      Many a time in the summer,\r\n    Lying beside them under the flaming sky,\r\n      Smoking an old tobacco pipe,\r\n       Made by one of these moundsmen.\r\n       Who in his time had smoked it,\r\n       Perchance over the council fire,\r\n Or in the dark woods where he had gone a-hunting;\r\n   In war time--in peaceful evenings,\r\n      With his squaw by his side,\r\n   And his brood of dusky papposins\r\n    Playing about in the twilight\r\n     Under the awful star-shadows.\r\n\r\n It seemed that I was very close to him, at such times;\r\n       And that his thick-ribbed lips,\r\n   --Gone to dust for unknown centuries--\r\n       Had met mine inscrutably,\r\n   By a magic hid in the pipestem,\r\n   Making me his familiar and hail fellow.\r\n       Almost I felt his breath,\r\n      And the muffled sound of his heart-beats;\r\n          Almost I grasped his hand,\r\n        And shook the antediluvian,\r\n      With a shake of grimmest fellowship\r\n      Trying to cozen him of his grim secret.\r\n        But sudden the gusty wind came,\r\n        Laughing away the illusion,\r\n      And I was alone in the desert.\r\n\r\n          If he could only wake up now,\r\n      And confront me--that ancient salvage!\r\n      Resurgated, with his faculties\r\n      All quick about him, and his memories,\r\n          What an unheard-of powwow\r\n      Could I report to you, O friends of mine!\r\n      Who look for some revelation,\r\n      Some hint of the strange apocalypse,\r\n        Which the wit of this man, living\r\n      So near to the prime of the morning,\r\n      So near to the gates of the azure,\r\n        The awful gates of the Unseen--\r\n        Whence all that is seen proceeded--\r\n      Hath wrought in this new-found country!\r\n      I wonder if he would remember\r\n    Anything about the Land of the Immortals.\r\n          Something he would surely find\r\n        In the deeps of his consciousness\r\n        To wake up a dim reminiscence.\r\n          Dreamy shadows might haunt him,\r\n  Shadows of beautiful faces, and of terrible;\r\n    Large, lustrous eyes, full of celestial meanings,\r\n      Looking up at him, beseeching him,\r\n        From unfathomable abysses,\r\n        With glances which were a language.\r\n      The finalest secrets and mysteries,\r\n      Behind every sight, and sound, and color,\r\n      Behind all motions, and harmonies,\r\n          Which floated round about him,\r\n          Archetypes of the phenomenal!\r\n\r\nOr, it might be, that coming suddenly in his mind\r\n      Upon some dark veil, as of Isis,\r\n    He lifts it with a key-thought,\r\n  Or the sudden memory of an arcane sign,\r\n      And beholds the gardens of Living Light,\r\n      The starry platform, palaces, and thrones--\r\n      The vast colossi, the intelligences\r\n    Moving to and fro over the flaming causeways\r\n        Of the kingdoms beyond the gates--\r\n              The infinite arches\r\n            And the stately pillars,\r\n                Upbuilt with sapphire suns\r\n    And illuminated with emerald and ruby stars,\r\n       Making cathedrals of immensity\r\n     For the everlasting worship without words.\r\n\r\nAll, or some, of the wondrous, impenetrable picture-land:\r\n                   The crimson seas,\r\n           Flashing in uncreated light,\r\n               Crowded with galleons\r\n    On a mission to ports where dwell the old gods\r\n   And the mighty intellects of the Immortals.\r\n           The ceaseless occupations,\r\n           The language and the lore;\r\nThe arts, and thoughts, the music, and the instruments;\r\n  The beauty and the divine glory of the faces,\r\n           And how the Immortals love,\r\n           Whether they wed like Adamites,\r\n           Or are too happy to wed,\r\n           Living in single blessedness!\r\n           Well, I know it is rubbish,\r\n           The veriest star-dust of fancy,\r\n         To think of such a thing as this\r\n     Being a memorial heirloom of the fore-world,\r\n            Such rude effigies of men,\r\n     Such clodbrains, as these poor mound builders!\r\n\r\n Their souls never had any priority in the life of them;\r\n            No background of eternity\r\n            Over which they had traversed\r\n                From eon to eon,\r\n            Sun-system to sun-system,\r\n            Planets and stars under them,\r\n            Planets and stars over them;\r\n Now dwelling on immeasurable plains of azure\r\n               Bigger than space,\r\n    Dazzling with the super-tropical brightness\r\n      Of passionate flowers without a name,\r\n    In all the romance of color and beauty--\r\n          Now, in the cities celestial,\r\n          Where they made their acquaintances\r\n   With other souls, which had never been incarnated,\r\n          But were getting themselves ready\r\n            By an intuitive obedience\r\n      To a well-understood authority,\r\n              Which had never spoken,\r\n      To take upon themselves the living form\r\n        Of some red-browed, fire-eyed Mars-man,\r\n          Some pale-faced, languishing son\r\n          Of the Phalic planet Venus,\r\n        Or wherever else it might be,\r\n         In what remote star soever\r\n       Quivering on shadowy battlements.\r\n       Along the lines of the wilderness,\r\n             Of worlds beyond worlds,\r\n         These souls were to try their fortunes.\r\n\r\n       Surely, no experience of this sort\r\n           Ever happened unto them,\r\n       Although one would like to invest them\r\n   With the glory of it, for the sake of the soul.\r\n         But they were, to speak truth of them,\r\n           A sort of journeyman work,\r\n           Not a Phidian statuary,\r\n            But a first cast of man,\r\n              A rude draft of him;\r\n      Huge gulfs, as of dismal Tartarus,\r\n  Separating him from the high-born Caucasian.\r\n             He, a mere Mongolian,\r\n       As good, perhaps, in his faculties,\r\n             As any Jap. or Chinaman--\r\n           But not of the full-orbed brain,\r\n           Star-blown, and harmonious\r\n       With all sweet voices as of flutes in him,\r\n           And viols, bassoons, and organs;\r\nCapable of the depths and circumferences of thought,\r\n           Of sphynxine entertainments,\r\n         And the dramas of life and death.\r\n\r\n       A plain fellow, and a practical,\r\n           With picture in him and symbol,\r\n       And thus not altogether clay-made,\r\n       But touched with the fire of the rainbow,\r\n         And the finger of the first light,\r\n       Waiting for the second and the third light,\r\n           Expectant through the ages,\r\n             And disappointed;\r\n             Never receiving more,\r\n       But going down, at last, a dark man,\r\n       And a lonely, through the dark galleries\r\n         Of death, and behind the curtain\r\n               Where all is light.\r\n\r\n       I like to think of him, and see his works:\r\n          I like to read him in his mounds,\r\n  And think I can make out a good deal of his history.\r\n               He was a half-dumb man,\r\n               Very sorrowful to see,\r\n         But brave, nevertheless, and bravely\r\n             Struggling to fling out his thoughts,\r\n               In a kind of dumb speech;\r\n        Struggling, indeed, after poetry\r\n        Daedalian forms, and eloquence;\r\n        Ambitious of distinguishing himself\r\n        In the presence of wolves and bisons\r\n          And all organic creatures;\r\n            Of making his claim good\r\n        Against these, his urgent disputants,\r\n          That he was lord of the planet.\r\n\r\n              If he could not write books,\r\n        He could scrawl the earth with his record:\r\n              He could make hieroglyphs,\r\n        Constellations of mounds and animals,\r\n          Effigies of unnamable things,\r\n          Monsters, and hybrids unnatural,\r\n        Bred of grotesque fancies; and man-forms.\r\n          These last, none of your pigmies\r\n              A span long in the womb,\r\n        And six feet, at full growth, out of it--\r\n            But bigger in chest and paunch,\r\n      In the girth of his muscular shackle-bones,\r\n            Round his colossal shoulders,\r\n        Round his Memnonian countenance,\r\n          Over the dome of his skull-crypts--\r\n          From crown to foot of his body--\r\n          Than grimmest of old Welsh giants,\r\n          Grimmest of Araby ogres!\r\n\r\n        Many a time talking with gray hunters,\r\n        Who leaned on their rifles against a tree,\r\n            And made the bright landscape\r\n  And the golden morning fuller of gold and brightness\r\n        By the contrast of their furrowed faces,\r\n              Their shaggy eyebrows,\r\n        And the gay humor laughing in their eyes,\r\n  Their unkempt locks, their powder horns, and buskins,\r\n    And the wild attire, in general, of their persons--\r\n          Many a time have I heard them\r\n            Tell of these man-effigies\r\n        Lying prone on the floors of the prairie.\r\n        And, in my whim for correspondence,\r\n    And perpetual seeking after identities,\r\nI have likened them to the stone sculptures, in cathedrals,\r\n        Cut by pious hands out of black marble,\r\n    Memorial resemblances of holy abbots,\r\n    Of Christian knights, founders of religious houses,\r\n            Of good lords of fair manors,\r\n          Who left largess to these houses,\r\n          Beneficed the arched wine-cellars\r\n          With yearly butts of canary,\r\n              Or, during their lifetime,\r\n   Beautified the west front with stately windows\r\n     Of colored glass, emblazoned with Scripture stories,\r\nThe sunlight in shadowy reflections painting the figures\r\n       With blue and gold and crimson\r\n     Upon the cold slabs of the pavement.\r\n\r\n        These effigies, stiff, formal,\r\n       Rudely fashioned, and of poor art,\r\n       All of them lying, black and stark,\r\nLike a corpse-pageantry visioned in some monk's dream,\r\n        Lying thus, in the transepts,\r\n     On the cold, gray floor of the cathedral.\r\n\r\n        A curious conceit, truly!\r\n     But the prairie is also consecrated,\r\n        And quite as sacred I think it\r\n       As Rome's most holy of holies.\r\n     It blossoms and runs over with religion.\r\n       These meek and beautiful flowers!\r\nWhat sweet thoughts and divine prayers are in them!\r\n       These song birds! what anthems of praise\r\n       Gush out of their ecstatic throats!\r\n          I pray you, also, tell me,\r\n        What floors, sacred to what dead,\r\n  Can compare with the elaborate mosaic work\r\n  Of this wide, vast, outstretching floor of grass?\r\n        As good a place, I take it,\r\n  For the mound builder to make his man-effigies\r\n          Out of the mould in,\r\n    As the cathedral is, for its artists\r\n  To make man-effigies out of the black marble!\r\n        And the thought, too, is the same!\r\nThe thought of the primeval savage of the stone era,\r\n        Roaming about in these wilds,\r\n        Before the beautiful Christ\r\n        Made the soul more beautiful,\r\n    Revealed the terror of its divine forces,\r\n      Announced its immortality,\r\n    And was nailed on a tree for His goodness!\r\n  While the monk, therefore, lay yet in the pagan brain,\r\n      And' Time had not so much as thought\r\n      Of sowing the seed for his coming--\r\nWhile his glorious cathedral, which, as we now know it,\r\n    Is an epic poem built in immortal stone,\r\n    Had no archetype except in the dreams of God,\r\n      Dim hints of it, lying like hopeless runes\r\n      In the forest trees and arches,\r\nIts ornamentations in the snow drifts, and the summer leaves and flowers--\r\n  No doubt, the mound-builder's man, put in effigy on the prairie,\r\n        Had been a benefactor, in his way and time;\r\n          Or, a great warrior; or learned teacher\r\n        Of things symbolized in certain mound-groups,\r\n          And which, from their arrangement,\r\n        Appertain, it would seem, to mysteries,\r\n          And ghostly communications.\r\n        They thought to keep green his memory,\r\n        The worship of him and his good deeds,\r\n              Unto the end of time,\r\n              Throughout all generations.\r\n            The holy men, born of Christ,\r\n        All Christendom but the development of him,\r\n            And all the world his debtor;\r\n        Even God owing him more largely\r\n          Than He has thought fit to pay back,\r\n            Taking the immense credit\r\n              Of nigh two thousand years!\r\n          These holy men, so born and cultured,\r\n            Could think of no way wiser,\r\n              Of no securer method\r\n        Of preserving the memory of their saints,\r\n          And of those who did good to them,\r\n    Than this rude, monumental way of the savage.\r\n              So singular is man,\r\n            So old-fashioned his thinkings,\r\n    So wonderful and similar his sympathies!\r\n        Everywhere the same, with a difference;\r\n              Cast in the same moulds,\r\n      Of the same animal wants, and common mind,\r\n          Of the same passions and vices,\r\n          Hating, loving, killing, lying--\r\n            A vast electrical chain\r\n    Running through tradition, and auroral history,\r\n              Up through the twilights,\r\n                And blazing noons,\r\n        Through vanishing and returning twilights,\r\n              Through azure nights of stars--\r\n            Epochs of civilization--\r\n            Unto the calmer glory,\r\n            Unto the settled days,\r\n              Unto the noble men--\r\n            _Nunc formosissimus annus!_\r\n\r\n  Thus do I, flinging curiously the webs of fancy\r\n        Athwart the time-gulfs, and the ages,\r\nReconcile, after a kind, the primitive savage of America\r\n        With the wonderful genealogies--\r\n            Upsprung from the vital sap\r\n          Of the great life-tree, Igdrasil!\r\n            Thick and populous nations\r\n          Heavily bending its branches,\r\n  Each in its autumn time of one or two thousand years,\r\n      Like ripe fruits, fully developed and perfected,\r\n          From the germ whence they proceeded;\r\n        Nourished by strong saps of vitality,\r\n      By the red, rich blood of matured centuries,\r\n        By passionate Semitic sunlights;\r\n  Beautiful as the golden apples of the Hesperides!\r\n      Radiating, also, a divine beauty,\r\n        The flower-blossom and the aroma,\r\n      The final music, of a ripe humanity,\r\n        Whereof each particular nation\r\n            Was in its way and turn\r\n          The form and the expression,\r\n\r\n          Grand autumns were some of them!\r\n        Grand and beautiful, like that of Greece,\r\n    Whose glorious consummation always reminds me\r\nOf moving statues, music, and richest painting and architecture:\r\n      Her landscapes shimmering in golden fire-mists,\r\n      Which hang over the wondrously colored woods,\r\n          In a dreamy haze of splendor;\r\n        Revealing arched avenues, and tiny glades,\r\n          Cool, quiet spots, and dim recesses,\r\n          Green swards, and floral fairy lands,\r\n              Sweeping to the hilltops;\r\n    Illuminating the rivers in their gladsome course,\r\n    And the yellow shadows of the rolling marshes,\r\n  And the cattle of the farmer as they stand knee-deep\r\n            Switching their tails by the shore;\r\n          Lighting up the singing faces,\r\n          The sweet, laughing, singing faces,\r\n            Of the merry, playful brooks,\r\n          Now running away over shallows,\r\n            Now into gurgling eddies;\r\n              Now under fallen trees,\r\n          Past beaver dams long deserted;\r\n              Now under shady banks,\r\n            Lost in the tangled wood-growths;\r\n          Quivering now with, their laughter,\r\n            Out in the open meadow,\r\n            Flowing, singing and laughing,\r\n            Over the weeds and rushes,\r\n            Flowing and singing forever!\r\n\r\n        Plastic and beautiful, and running over\r\n    With Schiller's 'play impulse,' was the genius of Greece,\r\n  Of which her institutions and civility were the embodiment.\r\n        Other autumn times of the nations\r\n              Were calm and peaceful,\r\n      Symbolized above, as fruit on the branches\r\n            Of the life-tree, Igdrasil!\r\n              And when their time came,\r\n              They dropped down silently,\r\n    Like apples from their boughs on the autumn grass;\r\n        Silently dropped down, on moonlight plains,\r\n    In the presence of the great company of the stars,\r\n          And the flaming constellations,\r\n    Which evermore keep solemn watch over their graves.\r\n          Others were blown off suddenly,\r\nAnd prematurely--all the elements enraged against them;\r\n          And others, like the Dead Sea fruit,\r\n        Were rotten at the heart before their prime!\r\n\r\n    The old mound builder stands at the base of the tree,\r\n        At the base of the wonderful tree Igdrasil,\r\n        And the mighty branches thereof,\r\n        Which hang over his head in flame-shadows,\r\n        Germinated, and blossomed with nations,\r\n        In other lands, in another hemisphere\r\n        Far away, over the measureless brine,\r\n      From the mother earth where he was planted,\r\n            Where he grew and flourished,\r\n            And solved the riddle of life,\r\n                  And tried death,\r\n            And the riddle beyond death.\r\n\r\n        He thought this passionate America,\r\n        With its vast results of physical life,\r\n        Its beautiful and sublime portraitures,\r\n      Its far-sweeping prairies, rolling in grassy waves\r\n        Like the green billows of an inland sea--\r\n              Its blue-robed mountains\r\n        Piercing the bluer heavens with their peaks--\r\n            Its rivers, lakes, and forests--\r\n        A roomy, and grand-enough earth to inhabit,\r\n        Without thought of anything beyond it.\r\n\r\n          And yet he is related to all\r\n          That was, and is, and shall be!\r\n        That idea which was clothed in his flesh\r\n        Is fleshed in I know not how many\r\n          Infinite forms and varieties,\r\n          In every part of the earth,\r\n        In this day of my generation.\r\n        But the flesh is a little different,\r\n    And here and there the organism a nobler one,\r\n      And the idea bigger, broader, deeper,\r\n    Of a more divine quality and diapason.\r\n  He is included in us, as the lesser in the greater;\r\n    All our enactments are repetitions of his;\r\n              Enlarged and adorned;\r\n          And we pass through all his phases,\r\n        Some time or other, in our beginnings--\r\n    Through his, and an infinity of larger ones--\r\n    And we have the same inevitable endings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE:\r\n\r\nITS POSSIBILITY, SCIENTIFIC NECESSITY, AND APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of the possibility and desirableness of a universal language,\r\nscientifically constituted; a common form of speech for all the nations\r\nof mankind; for the remedy of the confusion and the great evil of Babel,\r\nis not wholly new. The celebrated Leibnitz entertained it. It was, we\r\nbelieve, glanced at among the schemes of Lord Monboddo. Bishop Wilkins\r\ndevoted years of labor to the accomplishment of the task, and thought he\r\nhad accomplished it. He published the results of his labors in heavy\r\nvolumes, which have remained, as useless lumber, on the shelves of the\r\nantiquarian, or of those who are curious in rare books. A young\r\ngentleman of this city, of a rare genius, by the name of Fairbank, who\r\ndied by a tragical fate a few years since, labored assiduously to the\r\nsame end. A society of learned men has recently been organized in Spain,\r\nwith their headquarters at Barcelona, devoted to the same work. Numerous\r\nother attempts have probably been made. In all these attempts, projects,\r\nand labors, the design has never transcended the purpose of _Invention_.\r\nThe effort has been simply to _contrive_ a new form of speech, and to\r\npersuade mankind to accept it;--a task herculean and hopeless in its\r\nmagnitude and impracticability; but looking still in the direction of\r\nthe supply of one of the greatest needs of human improvement. The\r\nexistence of no less than two or three thousand different languages and\r\nidioms on the surface of the planet, in this age of railroad and\r\nsteamship communication, presents, obviously, one of the most serious\r\nobstacles to that unification of humanity which so many concurrent\r\nindications tend, on the other hand, to prognosticate.\r\n\r\nAnother and different outlook toward a unity of speech for the race\r\ncomes up from a growing popular impression that all existing languages\r\nmust be ultimately and somewhat rapidly smelted into one by the mere\r\nheat and attrition of our intense modern international intercourse. Each\r\nnationality is beginning to put forth its pretensions as the proper and\r\nprobable matrix of the new agglomerate, or philological pudding-stone,\r\nwhich is vaguely expected to result. The English urge the commercial\r\nsupremacy of their tongue; the French the colloquial and courtly\r\ncharacter of theirs; the Germans the inherent energy and philosophical\r\nadaptation of the German; the Spanish the wide territorial distribution\r\nand the pompous euphony of that idiom; and so of the other\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\nBoth invention, which is the genius of adaptation, and the blending\r\ninfluence of mere intercourse, may have their appropriate place as\r\nauxiliaries, in the reconstruction of human speech, in accordance with\r\nthe exigencies of the new era which is dawning on the world; but there\r\nis another and far more basic and important element, which may, and\r\nperhaps we may say must, appear upon the stage, and enter into the\r\nsolution. This is the element of positive Scientific _Discovery_ in the\r\nlingual domain. It may be found that every elementary sound of the human\r\nvoice is _inherently laden_ by _nature herself_ with a primitive\r\nsignificance; that the small aggregate of these meanings is precisely\r\nthat handful of the Primitive Categories of all _Thought_ and all\r\n_Being_ which the Philosophers, from Aristotle up to Kant, have so\r\nindustriously and painfully sought for. The germ of this idea was\r\nincipiently and crudely struggling in the mind of the late\r\ndistinguished philologist, Dr. Charles Kreitser, formerly professor of\r\nlanguages in the University of Virginia, and author of numerous valuable\r\narticles in Appletons' 'Cyclopaedia;' the most learned man, doubtless,\r\nthat unfortunate Hungary has contributed to our American body of savans.\r\nThis element of discovery may, in the end, take the lead, and immensely\r\npreponderate in importance over the other two factors already mentioned\r\nas participating in the solution of a question of a planetary language.\r\nThe idea certainly has no intrinsic improbability, that the normal\r\nlanguage of mankind should be matter of discovery as the normal music of\r\nthe race has been already. There was an instinctual and spontaneous\r\ndevelopment of music in advance of the time when science acted\r\nreflectively upon the elements and reconstituted it in accordance with\r\nthe musical laws so discovered. Why may we not, why ought we not even to\r\nexpect, analogically, that the same thing will occur for speech?\r\n\r\nSetting aside, however, for the present occasion, the profounder inquiry\r\ninto the inherent significance of sounds, and into all that flows\r\nlogically from that novel and recondite investigation, we propose at\r\npresent to treat in a more superficial way the subject indicated in the\r\ntitle of this article--A Universal Language; its Possibility, Scientific\r\nNecessity, and Appropriate Characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the scope of science is at this day such that the\r\ndemand for discriminating technicalities exceeds absolutely the capacity\r\nof all existing language for condensed and appropriate combinations and\r\nderivations. Hence speech must soon fail to serve the new developments\r\nof thought, unless the process of word-building can be itself\r\nproportionately improved; unless, in other words, a new and\r\nscientifically constructed Language can be devised adequate to all the\r\nwants of science. It would seem that there should occur, in the range of\r\npossibilities, the existence of the _Plan_ in _Nature_ of a _New_ and\r\n_Universal Language_, copious, flexible, and expressive beyond measure;\r\ncompetent to meet the highest demands of definition and classification;\r\nand containing within itself a natural, compact, infinitely varied, and\r\ninexhaustible terminology for each of the Sciences, as ordained by fixed\r\nlaws preexistent in the nature of things.\r\n\r\nThis language should not then be an arbitrary contrivance, but should be\r\nelaborated from the fundamental laws of speech, existing in the\r\nconstitution of the universe and of man, and logically traced to this\r\nspecial application. This knowledge of the underlying laws of speech\r\nshould determine the mode of the combination of _Elementary Sounds_ into\r\nSyllables and Words, and of Words into Sentences naturally expressive of\r\ngiven conceptions or ideas. Such a language would rest on discovery, in\r\nthat precise sense in which discovery differs from invention, and would\r\nhave in itself infinite capacities and powers of expression, and again\r\nof suggesting thought; and might perhaps come to be recognized as the\r\nmost stupendous discovery to which the human intellect is capable of\r\nattaining. 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,\r\nand the Word was God.' The Word, or the _Logos_, is the underlying or\r\nhidden _Wisdom_ of which _speech_ is the external utterance or\r\nexpression. Who can say how profoundly and intimately the underlying and\r\nhitherto undiscovered Laws of Speech may be consociated with the basic\r\nPrinciples _of all truth_ embedded in the Wisdom-Nature of God himself?\r\nThe old Massonites had a faith, derived from certain mystical utterances\r\nof the Greek Philosophers, that whosoever should discover the right name\r\nfor anything, would have absolute power over that thing. The Wisdom of\r\nPlato and the deeper Wisdom of Christ meet and are married to each\r\nother in the conception of John when he makes the startling assertion\r\nthat the Logos, the Logic, the Law, the Word, is synonymous with God\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of the existence of such a language, divinely and\r\nprovidentially prepared in the constitution of things, and awaiting\r\ndiscovery, begins to be perceived, if the conception of the existence of\r\nan absolutely universal analogy be permitted fairly to take possession\r\nof the mind. Such an infinite scheme of analogy, rendering the same\r\nprinciples alike applicable in all spheres, must itself, in turn, rest\r\nupon a Divine Unity of Plan reigning throughout the Universe, the\r\nexecution of which Plan is the act or the continuity of the acts of\r\nCreation. The Religious Intuition of the Race has persistently insisted\r\nupon the existence of this Unity, to the conception of which the\r\nscientific world is only now approximatingly and laboriously ascending.\r\n\r\nIf there be such Analogy in Nature furnishing an echo and an image in\r\nevery department of Being of all that exists in every other department\r\nof Being, certainly that Analogy must be _most distinct_ and _clearly\r\ndiscoverable as between the Elements, or the lowest and simplest\r\nConstituents of Being in each Sphere_. The lowest and simplest elements\r\nof Language are Oral Sounds, which in written Languages are represented\r\nby Letters, and constitute the Alphabets of those Languages. The\r\nAlphabets of Sound must be clearly distinguished from the mere\r\nLetter-Alphabets by which the Sounds are variously represented. The\r\nSound-Alphabets (the Scales of Phonetic Elements) of any two Languages\r\ndiffer only in the fact that one of the Languages may include a few\r\nSounds which are not heard in the other, or may omit a few which are.\r\n\r\nThe Mouth, the Larynx (a cartilaginous box at the top of the windpipe),\r\nand the Nose--the compound organ of speech--constitute an instrument,\r\ncapable, like the accordeon, for instance, of a certain number of\r\ndistinct touches and consequent vocal effects, which produce the sounds\r\nheard in all existing Languages. The total of the possible sounds so\r\nproduced or capable of production may be called the Crude or Unwinnowed\r\nAlphabet of Nature, or the Natural Alphabet of Human Language\r\ngenerically or universally considered. Thus, for instance, the sound\r\nrepresented in English and the Southern European Languages generally, by\r\nthe letter _m_, is made by the contact of the two lips, while at the\r\nsame time the sounding breath so interrupted is projected upon the\r\n_sounding board_ of the head _through the nose_, whence _resounding_, it\r\nis discharged outwardly, this process giving to the sound produced that\r\npeculiar effect called _nasal_ or _nose-sound_; and precisely this sound\r\ncan be produced by the voice in no other way. This sound is,\r\nnevertheless, heard in nearly all Languages, although there are a few\r\nimperfect savage dialects which are destitute of it. The production of\r\nthis sound, as above described, will be obvious to the reader if he will\r\npronounce the word _my_, and will attend to the position of the lips\r\nwhen he begins to utter the word. Let him attempt to say _my_, without\r\nclosing the lips, and the impossibility of doing so will be apparent.\r\nThe production of the sound is therefore mechanical and local; and the\r\nnumber of sounds to be produced by the organ fixed and limited,\r\ntherefore, by Nature herself. The very limited number of possible sounds\r\nmay be guessed by the fact that of sounds produced by _completely\r\nclosing the two lips_, there are only three, namely, _p_, _b_, _m_, in\r\nall the Languages of the earth (as in _p_-ie, _b_-y, _m_-y).\r\n\r\nIt is the same with all the other vocal sounds. They are _necessarily_\r\nproduced at certain fixed localities or Seats of Sound, in the mouth,\r\nand by a certain fixed modulation or mechanical use of the Organs of\r\nSpeech. At least they are produced in and are confined to certain\r\ncircumscribed regions of the mouth, and so differ in the method of\r\ntheir production as to be appropriately distributed into certain Natural\r\nClasses: as Vowels and Consonants; Labials (Lip Sounds); Linguo-dentals\r\n(Tongue-Teeth Sounds); Gutturals (Back-Mouth or Throat Sounds), etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFrom the whole number of sounds which it is possible to produce--the\r\nwhole Crude Natural Alphabet--one Language of our existing Languages\r\nselects a certain number less than the whole, and another Language doing\r\nthe same, it happens that while they mainly coincide, they, so to speak,\r\nshingle over each other at random, and it follows: 1. That the Number of\r\nSounds in different Languages is not uniform; 2. That of any two\r\nLanguages compared, one will chance to have several sounds not heard in\r\nthe other; and, 3. The erroneous impression is made upon the casual and\r\nsuperficial observer that in the aggregate of all Languages there must\r\nbe an immense number of sounds; whereas, in fact, the total Alphabet of\r\nVocal Sounds in nature, like the Gamut of Colors or Musical Tones, is\r\nquite limited, if we attend only to those which distinctly differ, or\r\nstand at appropriate and appreciable distances from each other.\r\n\r\nFurther to illustrate: Assume that there are, capable of being clearly\r\ndiscriminated by the human ear, say sixty-four or seventy-two distinct\r\nElementary Sounds of the human voice, in all--as many, for example, as\r\nthere are Chemical Elements; some existing Languages select and make use\r\nof twenty, some of twenty-four, some of thirty, and some of forty of\r\nthese sounds, omitting the rest.\r\n\r\nBut--and here is a very important point and a real discovery in this\r\ninvestigation--it will be found, if closely attended to, that a certain\r\nselection of one half of this number, say thirty-two or thirty-six of\r\nthese sounds, embraces the whole body of vocal elements _usually\r\noccurring_ in all the forms of speech on the planet; the remaining half\r\nconsisting of rare, exceptional, and, we may nearly say, useless sounds.\r\nThis statement will again be better understood by analogy with what\r\nregards the Elements of Chemistry. Just about one half of the known\r\nelements of matter occur with frequency, and enter into useful and\r\nordinary combinations to produce the great mass of known substances. The\r\nremaining half are unfrequent, obscure, and relatively unimportant; some\r\nof them never having been seen even by many of our most eminent\r\nchemists. Even should a few new elements be discovered, it cannot be\r\nanticipated that any one of them should prove to be of leading\r\nimportance, like oxygen, carbon, or sulphur.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should some future great chemical discovery realize\r\nthe dream of the alchemists, and enable us to transmute iron into gold,\r\nand indeed every chemical Element into every other chemical Element\r\n(convertible identity), still the sixty-four (nearly) Chemical Elements\r\nnow known would remain the real Elements of Organic and Inorganic\r\nCompounds, in a sense just as important as that in which they are now so\r\nregarded. The now known Elements would still continue to constitute _The\r\nCrude Natural Alphabet of Matter_, and be correspondential with _The\r\nCrude Natural Alphabet of Sounds in Language_. The transmutability of\r\none element into another indefinitely, would not, in any but a certain\r\nabsolute or transcendental sense, cause the Elements to be regarded as\r\none, or as any less number than now. It would be, on the contrary, a\r\nfact precisely corresponding with the actual and well-known\r\ntransmutability of speech-sounds into each other as occurs in the\r\nphenomena of Etymology and Comparative Philology. This is so extensive,\r\nas now understood by Comparative Philologists, that it would be hardly\r\ndifficult to prove that every sound is capable of being transmuted into\r\nevery other sound, either directly or through intermediates; and yet we\r\ndo not in the least tend to cease to regard the several sounds as they\r\nstand as the real Elements of Speech.\r\n\r\nIt is this transmutability of Correspondential Elements in another\r\nsphere of Being, which bases the presumption, or gives to it at least\r\ncountenance from a new quarter, that the metals and other chemical\r\nElements may be actually convertible substances by means of processes\r\nnot yet suspected or sufficiently understood. The more careful study of\r\nthe Analogy with the Elements of other spheres, and perhaps specifically\r\nwith the Elements of Language, under the presiding influence of larger\r\nscientific generalizations and views than those which now prevail in the\r\nscientific world, may be, and, it would even seem, ought to be the means\r\nof revealing the law of Elementary Transmutations in the Chemical\r\nDomain. The expectation of a future discovery of the resolution of the\r\nexisting Elements of Matter, and their convertibility even, is reviving\r\nin the chemical field, and even so distinguished a chemist and thinker\r\nas Professor Draper does not hesitate to sustain its probability by the\r\nweight of his authority and belief. The process by which the\r\ntransmutation of Elements is actually effected in Language, is by _Slow\r\nand Continued Attrition_. These very words suggest a process but little\r\nresorted to in chemical experiment, but which probably intervenes in the\r\nLaboratory of Nature, when she makes the diamond out of a substance,\r\nsimple carbon, the most familiarly known to chemistry, but out of which\r\nthe human chemist is entirely unable by any process known to him to\r\nproduce that precious gem.\r\n\r\nWhether this particular hint is of any value or not, one thing is\r\ncertain, that it is in the direction of Universal and Comparative\r\nScience--the analogical echo of the parts of one Domain of Being with\r\nthe parts of another Domain and of all other Domains of Being; of the\r\nphenomena of one Science with the phenomena of other Sciences; and\r\nespecially as among the Elements of each--that we must look for the next\r\ngrand advances in Scientific Discovery. The world urgently requires the\r\nexistence of a new class of scientific students who shall concern\r\nthemselves precisely with these questions of the relations and the\r\nindications of unity between the different Sciences; not to displace,\r\nbut to transcend and to cooerdinate the labors of that noble Army of\r\nScientific Specialists, with which Humanity is now so extensively and so\r\nhappily provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Select_ Lingual Alphabet of Nature, as distinguished from the\r\n_Crude_ Natural Alphabet above described, is then the expurgated scale\r\nof sounds, say thirty-two; the sounds of usual occurrence in polished\r\nlanguages; one half of the whole number; the residuum after rejecting an\r\nequal number of obscure, unimportant, or barbarous sounds, of possible\r\nproduction and of real occurrence in some of the cruder Languages, and\r\nas crude elements even in the more refined Languages now extant. The two\r\nsounds of _th_ in English, as in _th_igh and _th_y (the _theta_ of the\r\nGreek), and the two shades of the _ch_-sound in German, as in na_ch_ and\r\ni_ch_, are instances of crude sounds in refined Languages, for which\r\nother Languages, more fastidious for Euphony, as French and Italian for\r\nexample, naturally substitute _t_, _d_, and _k_ (_c_). The obscure and\r\ncrude sounds would always retain, however (in respect to the idea of a\r\nUniversal Alphabet), a subordinate place and value, and should be\r\ngathered and represented in a Supplementary Alphabet for special and\r\nparticular uses.\r\n\r\nIt has been the mistake of Phoneticians and Philologians, heretofore, to\r\nrecognize no difference in the relative importance of sounds. They have\r\nsought, through every barbarous dialect, as well as every refined\r\ntongue, and gathered by the drag-net of observation, every barbarous and\r\nobscure as well as every polite sound which by any accident ever enters\r\ninto the constitution of speech. The clucks of Hottentot Tribes and the\r\nwhistle heard in some of the North American Languages have been reckoned\r\nin, upon easy terms, with the more serviceable and euphonious members of\r\nthe Phonetic family, and mere trivial shades of sounds were put upon the\r\nsame footing as the pivotal sounds themselves. This is as if certain\r\nobdurate compounds were introduced in the first instance among Chemical\r\nElements--which subsequent analysis may even prove to be the case in\r\nrespect to some substances that we now recognize as Elements--and then,\r\nby assigning to the least important of Elements the same rank, and\r\ngiving to them the same attention as to the most important, the number\r\nwere augmented beyond the practical or working body of Elements, and our\r\ntreatises upon Chemistry encumbered by a mass of useless matter. Or\r\nagain, it is as if among the Elements of Music were included all\r\nconceivable sounds, as the squeal, the shriek, the sob, etc.; and as if,\r\nin addition to this, the least intervals, the quarter tones for\r\ninstance, were ranked as the musical equals of the whole tones.\r\n\r\nIf it should prove a matter of fact, as capable of exact scientific\r\ndemonstration as any other, that the Consonant and Vowel Elements of\r\nOral Language are, in a radical and important sense, repetitory of, or\r\ncorrespondential with, Musical Tones or the Elements of Music, as well\r\nas with Chemical Elements, and these again with the Elements of\r\nNumerical Calculation, of Form, or the Science of Morphology, and, in\r\nfine, with the Prime Metaphysical Elements of Being, or the first\r\nCategories of Thought, perhaps we may by such speculations catch a\r\nglimpse of the possibilities of a great lingual discovery, having the\r\nattributes here indicated. _Why should not the Elements of Speech have\r\nbeen brought by Nature herself into some sort of parallelism with the\r\nElements of Thought which it is the special province of Speech to\r\nrepresent?_ Why, again, should not the Prime Elements of every new\r\ndomain of Being be merely a Repetition in new form of the Prime Elements\r\nof the Universe, as a whole, and of those especially of Language, its\r\nrepresentative domain?--Language being the literal word, as Universal\r\nLaw is the Logos or the Word _par excellence_, and Divine. In that\r\nevent, every speech-element would be of necessity inherently charged\r\nwith the precise kind and degree of meaning specifically relating it,\r\nfirst to one of the Prime Elements of Being, metaphysically considered,\r\nand then, by an echo of resemblance, to one of the Prime Elements of\r\nevery subordinate domain of Being throughout the Universe. The\r\nCombinations of the Letter-Sounds would then constitute words exactly,\r\nsimply, and naturally expressive of any combination of the Elements of\r\nBeing, either, first, in the Universal domain, or, secondly, in any\r\nsubordinate domain, physical or psychical. In this way a grand and\r\nwonderful system of technicals would be wrought out for all the\r\nsciences--_provided by Nature herself, and discovered, only, by man_. It\r\nis at least certain that if a grand Science of Analogy is ever to be\r\ndiscovered, capable of Unifying all our knowledges, an anticipation\r\nvaguely entertained by our most advanced scientific minds, it must be\r\nsought for primarily among the simplest elements of every domain of\r\nscience, or, what is the same thing, every domain of Thought and Being.\r\nIt is alike certain that heretofore the first step even has never been\r\nrightly taken among the men of science to investigate in that direction.\r\nThe failure of all those who have entertained the idea of a Universal\r\nAnalogy as a basis of Scientific Unity, has resulted from the fact that,\r\ndrawn rapidly along by the beauty of their conceptions, they have\r\nattempted to rush forward into the details of their subject, and have\r\nlost themselves in the infinity of these, without the wisdom and\r\npatience to establish a basis for their immense fabric in the exact\r\ndiscovery and knowledge of Elements. They have hastened forward to the\r\nlimbs and twigs and leaves and flowers and fruitage, without having\r\nsecurely planted the roots of their scientific tree in the solid earth.\r\nSuch was the case with Oken, the great German Physio-Philosopher and\r\nTranscendental Anatomist, the pupil of Hegel, who exerted a profound\r\ninfluence over the scientific mind of Germany for thirty years, but has\r\nnow sunk into disrepute for want of just that elementary and\r\ndemonstrative discovery of first Elements, and the rigorous adhesion to\r\nsuch perceptions of that kind as were partially entertained by him and\r\nhis school of powerful thinkers and scientists.\r\n\r\nTo repeat the leading idea above, which is so immensely pregnant with\r\nimportance, and, perhaps we may add, so essentially new: The\r\ncombinations of Speech-Elements--in a perfect and normal Language for\r\nthe Human Race, which we are here assuming that Nature should have\r\nprovided, and which may be only awaiting discovery--when they should be\r\nrightly or scientifically arranged into words and sentences, would be\r\nexactly concurrent and parallel with the combinations of the _Prime\r\nElements_ of Thought and Being in the Real Universe; so that each word,\r\nso formed, would become exactly charged with the kind and amount of\r\nmeaning contained in the thing named or the conception intended. An idea\r\nwill thus be obtained by the reader, somewhat vague, no doubt, at first,\r\nbut which would become perfectly distinct, as the subject should be\r\ngradually unfolded, of the way in which a universal language naturally\r\nexpressive of Thoughts and Feelings, and capable of unlimited expansion,\r\nmight perhaps be evolved from a profound understanding of the Analogies\r\nof the Universe. It is important, however, in order that this theory,\r\nnow when it is first presented, should not unnecessarily prejudice\r\ncautious and conservative minds, and seem to them wholly Utopian, to\r\nguard it by the additional statement that, while such a language might\r\nbe appropriately denominated Universal, there is a sense in which it\r\nwould still not be so; or, in other words, that it could only become\r\nUniversal by causing to coalesce with its own scientifically organized\r\nstructure, the best material already wrought out, and existing as\r\n_natural growth_ in the dead and living languages now extant; by\r\nabsorbing them, so to speak, in itself. It would have no pretension,\r\ntherefore, directly to supersede any of the existing languages, nor even\r\nultimately to dispense with the great mass of the material found in any\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nIt is a common prejudice among the learned that Language is a growth,\r\nand cannot in any sense be a structure; in other words, that it is\r\npurely the subject of the instinctive or unthoughted development of man,\r\nand not capable of being derived from reflection, or the deliberate\r\napplication of the scheming faculty of the intellect. A little\r\nreflection will show that this opinion is only a half truth. It is\r\ncertain that language has received its primitive form and first\r\ndevelopment by the instinctive method. It is equally true, however, that\r\neven as respects our existing languages, they have been overlaid by a\r\nsubsequent formation, originating with the development of the\r\n_Sciences_, due wholly to reflection on the scheming faculty of man, and\r\nalready equal in extension to the primitive growth. The Nomenclature of\r\neach of the Sciences has been devised by the reflective genius of\r\nindividuals, and arbitrarily imposed, so to speak, upon the Spoken and\r\nWritten Languages of the World, as they previously existed. From the\r\ncabinets and books of the learned, they gradually pass into the speech\r\nof the laity, and become incorporated with the primitive growth. If,\r\ninstead of the Carbonate of Soda, the Protoxide of Nitrogen, and other\r\nChemical Technicalities arbitrarily formed in modern times from the\r\nancient Greek Language, terms which the ancient Greeks themselves never\r\nheard nor conceived of, we had words derived from similar combinations\r\nof Anglo-Saxon or German Roots; if, for instance, for Protoxide of\r\nNitrogen, we had the _First-sour-stuffness_, or the\r\n_First-sharp-thingness of Salt-petreness_, and so throughout the immense\r\nvocabulary of chemistry, what an essentially different aspect would the\r\nwhole English Language now wear! Had Lavoisier, therefore, chosen the\r\nAnglo-Saxon or the German as the basis of the chemical nomenclature now\r\nin use, we can readily perceive how the intellectual device of a single\r\nsavant, would, ere this time, have sent a broad current of new\r\ndevelopment through the heart of all the advanced Languages of the\r\nearth; of a different kind wholly, but no more extensive, no more novel,\r\nand truly foreign to the primitive instinctual growth of those\r\nLanguages, no more purely the result of intellectual contrivance, than\r\nthe current of development to which he actually did give origin.\r\n\r\nLavoisier chose the dead Greek as a fountain from which to draw the\r\nelements of his new verbal compounds, assigning to those elements\r\narbitrarily new volumes of meaning, and constructing from them, with no\r\nother governing principle than his own judgment of what seemed best, a\r\ntotally new Language, as it were, adequate to the wants of the new\r\nScience. Still, despite these imperfections in the method, the demand,\r\nwith the growth of the new ideas, for a new expansion of the powers of\r\nLanguage, in a given direction, made the contrivance of the great\r\nchemist a successful interpolation upon the speech-usages of the world.\r\nIt is certainly not therefore inconceivable--because of any governing\r\nnecessity that Language should be a purely natural growth--that other\r\nand greater modifications of the speech of mankind may occur; when--not\r\nan arbitrary contrivance upon an imperfect basis and of a limited\r\napplication is in question, but--when a real discovery, the revelation\r\nof the true scientific bases of Language, and limitless applications in\r\nall directions, should be concerned.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the extent of the practical applications of strictly\r\nscientific principles to the Structure of Language is subject to\r\nlimitation. Even mathematics, theoretically the most unlimited of the\r\nexisting Sciences, is practically limited very soon by the complexity of\r\nthe questions involved in the higher degrees of equations. In the same\r\nmanner, while it may be possible to construct a Scientific Language\r\nadequate to all the wants of Language, in which exactness is involved;\r\nthat is to say, capable of classifying and naming every object and idea\r\nin the Universe which is itself capable of exact classification and\r\ndefinition, still there remains an immense sphere, an equal half, it may\r\nbe said, of the Universe of objects and conceptions, which have not that\r\nsusceptibility; which are, in other words, so complex, so idiosyncratic,\r\nor so vague in their nature, that the best guide for the formation of an\r\nappropriate word for their expression is not Intellect or Reflection,\r\nbut that very Instinct which has presided over the formation of such\r\nLanguages as we now have. We may accurately define a triangle or a cube,\r\nand might readily bring them within the range of a Universal Language\r\nscientifically constructed; but who would venture to attempt by any\r\nverbal contrivance to denote the exact elements of thought and feeling\r\nwhich enter into the meaning of the verbs _to screech_ or _to twinge_?\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, ample scope and a peremptory demand for both\r\nmethods of lingual development. The New Scientific Language herein\r\nsuggested would be universal within the limit within which Science\r\nitself is universal. But there is another sphere within which Science,\r\nborn of the Intellect, has only a subordinate sway, and in which\r\ninstinct, or that faculty which, in the higher aspect of it, we\r\ndenominate Intuition, is supreme. This faculty has operated as instinct\r\nin the first stage of the growth of Language, the Natural or\r\nInstinctual; it should now give place to the Intellect, in the second\r\nstage, the Scientific; after which it should regain its ascendency as\r\nIntuition, in the final finish and perfectionment of the Integral Speech\r\nof Mankind, the Artistic.\r\n\r\nSuch a Language would be, to all other Languages, precisely what a\r\nunitary Science would be to all the special Sciences; and we have seen\r\nhow it might happen that the same discovery should furnish both the\r\nLanguage and the Science. Without rudely displacing any existing\r\nLanguage, it would, besides filling its own central sphere of uses,\r\nfurnish a rallying point of unity between them all. It would ally them\r\nto itself, not by the destruction of their several individualities, but\r\nby developing the genius of each to the utmost. It would enrich them\r\nall, by serving as the common interpreter between them, until each would\r\nattain something of the powers of all, or at least the full capacity for\r\navailing itself of the aid of all others, and chiefly of the central\r\ntongue, in all those respects in which in consequence of its own special\r\ncharacter it should remain individually defective. The new Scientific\r\nand Central Language might thus plant itself in the midst of the\r\nLanguages; gradually assimilate them to itself; drawing at the same time\r\nan augmentation of its own materials from them, until they would become\r\nmere idioms of it, and finally, perhaps, in a more remote future,\r\ndisappear altogether as distinct forms of speech, and be blended into\r\nharmony in the bosom of the central tongue.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Language for the formation of new words, by the\r\npossible euphonic combination of elementary sounds, is as nearly\r\ninfinite as any particular series of combinations usually called\r\ninfinite; all such series having their limitations, as in the case of\r\nthe different orders of the Infinite in the calculus which are limited\r\nby the fact that there are different orders. Yet, notwithstanding that\r\nthis inexhaustible fountain of Phonetic wealth exists directly at hand,\r\nnone of these resources have ever been utilized by any scientific\r\narrangement and advice. Only so many verbal forms as happen to have\r\noccurred in any given language, developed by the chance method, in the\r\nGreek, for instance, are chosen as a basis, and employed as elements for\r\nthe new verbal formatives now coming into use with such astonishing\r\nrapidity in all the sciences. For instance, let us take the consonant\r\ncombination _kr_ (or _cr_), and add the following series of vowels: _i_\r\n(pronounced _ee_), _e_ (pronounced _a_), _a_ (pronounced _ah_), _o_\r\n(pronounced _aw_), _u_ (pronounced _uh_), _o_ (pronounced _o_), and _u_\r\n(pronounced _oo_); and we construct the following series of euphonic\r\ntriliteral roots:\r\n\r\nKri (Kree)\r\n\r\nKre (Kra or Kray)\r\n\r\nKra (Krah)\r\n\r\nKr_o_ (Kraw)\r\n\r\nKr_u_ (Kruh)\r\n\r\nKro (Kro)\r\n\r\nKru (Kroo).\r\n\r\nLet us now add the termination _o_, and we have the following list of\r\nformatives:\r\n\r\nKri-o (Kree-o)\r\n\r\nKre-o (Kra-o)\r\n\r\nKra-o (Krah-o)\r\n\r\nKr_o_-o (Kraw-o)\r\n\r\nKr_u_-o (Kr_uh_-o)\r\n\r\nKro-o (Kro-o)\r\n\r\nKru-o (Kroo-o).\r\n\r\nOf these verbal forms only two occur in any of the well-known\r\nSouthwestern Languages of Europe, namely, _Creo_, I CREATE, of the\r\nLatin, Italian, etc., and _Crio_, I REAR, of the Spanish. The other\r\nforms are entirely unused. Of any other simple series of Euphonic\r\ncombinations, such as Phonetic art can readily construct, there is the\r\nsame wasteful neglect, and, in consequence of this total failure of the\r\nscientific world to extract these treasures of Phonic wealth lying\r\ndirectly beneath their feet, they are driven to such desperate devices\r\nas that of naming the two best-known and most familiar order of fishes,\r\nthose usually found on our breakfast tables, _Acanthopterygii\r\nAbdominales_, and _Malacopterygii Subbrachiati_; and the common and\r\nbeautiful bird called bobolink is _Dolichonyx Orixyvora_. For the same\r\nreason--the entire absence of any economical and systematized use of our\r\nphonetic materials by the scientific world--the writer found himself,\r\nrecently, in attempting certain generalizations of the domain of\r\nscience, stranded almost at the commencement, upon such verbal shoals as\r\n_Anthropomorphus Inorganismoidismus_; and the subsequent steps in the\r\nmere naming of discriminations simple enough in themselves, became\r\nwholly impossible. The urgent necessity existing, therefore, for the\r\nradical intervention of Science in the discovery of true principles\r\napplicable to the construction of its own tools and instruments, can\r\nhardly be denied or questioned.\r\n\r\nThe immense condensation of meaning, and the consequent compactness and\r\ncopiousness of which a Language based on a meaning inherently contained\r\nby analogy in the simplest elements of sound would be susceptible, would\r\ngive to such a Language advantages as the instrument of thought and\r\ncommunication, which are but very partially illustrated in the\r\nsuperiority of printing by movable types over manuscript, for the rapid\r\nmultiplication of books.\r\n\r\nIn the _compound words_ of existing Languages each root-word of the\r\ncombination has a distinct meaning, and the joint meaning of the parts\r\nso united is the description or definition of the new idea; thus in\r\nGerman, _Finger_ is FINGER, and _Hut_ is HAT, and _Finger-hut_\r\n(FINGER-HAT) is a _thimble_; _Hand_ is HAND, _Schue_ is SHOE, and\r\n_Hand-schue_ is _a glove_, etc. So in English, _Wheel-barrow_,\r\n_Thunder-storm_, etc. The admirable expressiveness of such terms, and\r\nthe great superiority in this respect of Languages like the Sanscrit,\r\nGreek, German, etc., in which such self-defining combinations are\r\nreadily formed, over Spanish, Italian, French, and other derivative\r\nlanguages, the genius of which resists combination, is immediately\r\nperceived and acknowledged. But if we analyze any one of these compound\r\nwords, _Finger-hut_, for instance, we shall perceive that while each of\r\nthe so-called elements of combination, _Finger_ and _Hut_, has a\r\ndistinct meaning, which enters into the more specific meaning of the\r\ncompound, yet they are not, in any true sense, elements, or, in other\r\nwords, that they are not the ultimate elements of the compound words.\r\n_Finger_ is itself constituted, in the first instance, of two syllables,\r\n_Fing_ and _er_, which, in accordance with the same principle upon which\r\nthe compound word _Finger-hut_ is organized, should describe the thing\r\nsignified, as would be the case if _Fing_ meant HAND, and _er_ meant\r\nCONTINUATION. _Finger_ would then mean HAND-CONTINUATION, and\r\n_Finger-hut_ (_thimble_) would then be a HAND-CONTINUATION-HAT. But,\r\nagain, _Fing_ consists of three elementary sounds, _f-i-ng_, _er_ of\r\ntwo, _e-r_, and _hut_ of three, _h-u-t_. Suppose now that the primary\r\nsound _f_ had been scientifically discovered to be correspondential\r\nthroughout all the realms of Nature and of Thought with _Superiority_,\r\n_High-position_, or _Upperness_; _i_ with _centrality_, or _main body_,\r\nand _ng_ with _member_ or _branch_; the syllable _Fing_ would then\r\nsignify UPPER-BODY-BRANCH, a very proper description of _the arm_.\r\nSuppose that _e_ signified, in the same way, _flat, palm-like ideas and\r\nthings generally_ and that _r_ alone signified _continuation_; then _er_\r\nwould signify PALM-CONTINUATION, and _Finger_ would signify an\r\nUPPER-BODYBRANCH-PALM-CONTINUATION, or, in other words, a\r\n_Palm-continuation of an upper-body-branch_, and would so be completely\r\n_descriptive of_, at the same time that it would _denote_, a Finger.\r\nSuppose, again, that _h_ signified inherently _rotundity_ or\r\n_roundness_; _u_, _closeness_; and _t_, _roof_ or _covering_; then _hut_\r\nwould signify ROUND-CLOSED-COVER, a proper description of a _hat_; and\r\n_Finger-hut_ would then mean\r\nAN-UPPER-BODY-BRANCH-PALM-CONTINUATION-ROUND-CLOSED-COVER, or _the\r\nround-closed-cover of a palm-continuation of a superior limb or branch\r\nof the body_. It will be at once perceived how, with such resources of\r\nsignification at command, compounds like _Acanthopterygii_ to signify\r\n_thornfins_, _Malacopterygii Subbrachiati_, to signify _Under-arm soft\r\nfins_, or _Anthropomorphus Inorganismoidismus_, to signify _things in\r\nunorganized form, having a resemblance to man_, would soon come to be\r\nregarded as the lingual monsters which they really are.\r\n\r\nThe difference between commencing the composition of words by the real\r\nelements of speech, represented by single letters, each charged with its\r\nown appropriate meaning, and conveying that meaning into every compound\r\ninto which it should enter, from commencing the composition by assuming\r\nlong words already formed in some existing language, as _Anthropos_\r\n(Greek word for _man_), _Acanthos_ (Greek word for _spine_), _Keron_\r\n(Greek word for _fin_ or _wing_), etc., as the first element of the new\r\ncompounds, is infinite in its results upon the facility, copiousness,\r\nand expressiveness of the terminology evolved. It is like the difference\r\nof man working by the aid of the unlimited resources of tools and\r\nmachinery and the knowledge of chemistry, on the one hand, and man\r\nworking with his unaided _bare hands_, and in ignorance of the nature of\r\nthe substances he employs, on the other hand. The scientific world has\r\nnot hitherto known how to construct the lingual tools and instruments\r\nwhich are indispensable to its own rapidly augmenting and complicated\r\noperations; to analyze and apply the lingual materials at its command;\r\nand to simplify and unify the nomenclatures of all the sciences, in\r\norder to quicken a thousandfold the operation of all the mental\r\nfaculties, in the perception and exact vocal indication of all the\r\ninfinitely numerous close discriminations and broad generalizing\r\nanalogies with which nature abounds.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the particular meanings assigned\r\nabove to the single sounds in the analysis of the German word\r\n_Finger-hut_, are not assumed in any sense to be the real meanings of\r\nthe vocal elements involved. The whole case is supposititious, and\r\nassumed merely to illustrate the unused possibilities of Language in the\r\nconstruction of significant words, and especially in the construction of\r\nscientific technicalities. To found a real Language of this kind, it\r\nwould be necessary, first, to work up patiently to the true meanings of\r\nthe Elementary Sounds of Human Speech, and then to the analogy of those\r\nmeanings with the elements of universal being (the categories of the\r\nunderstanding, etc.), and finally of these again with the elements of\r\neach of the special Sciences.\r\n\r\nCould such a discovery be actually accomplished; should it prove to be\r\nthe simple fact of nature that every sound of the human voice is\r\nNature's chosen vehicle for the communication of an equally elementary\r\nidea; and that the Combinations of the Elementary Sounds into Words do\r\ninherently and necessarily, so soon as these primitive meanings and the\r\nlaw of their combination are known, produce words infinite in number and\r\nperfect in structure, naturally expressive of every precise idea of\r\nwhich the human mind is capable, it becomes perfectly conceivable how a\r\nNatural Universal Language would be evolved by discovery alone. The\r\ncreation of the Language would belong to Nature as truly and\r\nabsolutely--in a sense, more truly and absolutely--than our existing\r\ninstinctual Languages. It would be in fact the normal Language of\r\nHumanity, from which, for the want of such a discovery, mankind has been\r\nunnaturally debarred. The fact would prove to be that we have ever been\r\nbanished from our true vernacular, and have been, all our lives,\r\nspeaking foreign or strange tongues, from which we have only to recur or\r\ncome home. May we not, therefore, found in Science the rational\r\nexpectation, that in due time, from a Lingual Paradise Lost in the\r\nremote Past, we may recur to a Lingual Paradise Regained, in literal\r\nfulfilment of the promise of prophecy, that all the nations of the earth\r\nshall be of one speech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMER'S NIGHT.\r\n\r\n[_Translated literally from the original Polish of Count S. Krasinski,\r\nby Prof. Podbielski; prepared for_ THE CONTINENTAL _by Martha Walker\r\nCook._]\r\n\r\n'O'er this sad world Death folds his gloomy pall,\r\nBright buds hatch worms, flowers die, and woe shrouds all.'\r\n\r\n                                  MALIZEWSKI.\r\n\r\n'Oh, look on me, my fellow countrymen,\r\nFrom the same Fatherland! On me, so young,\r\nPassing o'er the last road, gazing for the last time\r\nOn Helios--to see him rise no more for ever!\r\nIn his cold cradle Death rolls all asleep;\r\nMe _living_ he conducts to his black shores;\r\nMe wretched! unbetrothed! upon whose ears\r\nNo bridal chant has ever hymned its joys,\r\nStern Acheron alone calls to his side,\r\nAnd Death must be my icy Bridegroom now!'\r\n\r\n                       SOPHOCLES: _Antigone_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nI behold her as they lead her forth, with myrtle wreath upon her brow,\r\nand floating drapery of snow. She moves slowly, as if in fear, and the\r\nchurch rises like a vast cemetery before her eyes. Charmed with her\r\nmodest loveliness, men smile on her as she glides forward, while\r\nchildren, changed into little angels, strew fresh flowers before her.\r\nThe bishop and attendant priests look bright in gay dalmatics; and\r\nthrongs of people crowd round, praising, envying, and wishing bliss. She\r\nalone is silent, with long lashes shading her downcast eyes, as she\r\nleans on the arms of her maidens.\r\n\r\nWeariness is in every movement of her slight form, her nerves seem\r\nunstrung, and the rays of soul gleam vague and troubled through the\r\nexpanded pupils of her blue eyes; it were indeed hard to divine whether\r\nplaint or prayer would breathe through the half-open lips. As she passes\r\non before the shrines and chapels she lifts her hand, as if intending to\r\nmake the sign of the cross, but she seems without energy to complete the\r\nsymbols, and they fall broken and half formed in the air. Inclining her\r\nhead before the Mother of God, she bends as if about to kneel, but, her\r\nstrength evidently failing her, she moves tremblingly on toward the\r\nsanctuary, and the Great Altar in its gloomy depths looms before her\r\nlike a sepulchre.\r\n\r\nThere, encircled by relations and friends, with pride and pleasure\r\nbeaming from his aged eyes, her father awaits her; and well may he be\r\nproud, for never had God given to declining years a lovelier child. She\r\nshines upon the sunset of his life with the growing lustre of the\r\nevening star, and never has its light beamed dim upon him until this\r\nvery hour. He will not, however, think of this momentary eclipse now,\r\nfor this same hour will see the fulfilment of his brightest dreams. In\r\nhis joy and pride he exclaims to the friends around him: 'Look on my\r\nchild; how young, pure, and innocent she is--trembling in the ignorance\r\nof her approaching happiness!' Then he gazes wistfully, far as his eye\r\ncan reach, down the long aisles of the church, to ascertain if the\r\nbridegroom yet appears, and, seeing him not, his gray eyebrows fall, and\r\nsettle into a frown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut peace soon again smoothes his broad forehead. Alas! the illusions of\r\nthe old stand round their petrifying souls like statues of granite; no\r\nearthly power avails to strike them down, and death alone can break\r\nthem. The young see their dreams floating in the air, while shifting\r\nrainbows play above them as they rise and melt upon the view. But the\r\nhopes of the old grow hard and stony as they near the grave; their\r\n_desires_ assume the form of _realities_. The harsh rock of bygone\r\nexperience stands between them and the truths of the present. Seating\r\nthemselves immovably upon it, the surging life-stream hurtles on far\r\nbelow, bearing them not forward on its hurrying flow. Withered garlands\r\nand the ashes of once fiery hearts drift on; shattered wrecks, with torn\r\nsails and broken masts, driven and tossed by eternal whirlwinds, appear\r\nand vanish in the river's rush; but the old remain motionless above. The\r\nhot rain of stars forever falling there dies out with dull moan, while\r\nthe glad waves and white foam laugh as the ruined wrecks toss helplessly\r\nin the strong winds; but the aged heed it not: they have grown into one\r\nwith the rock of the past, they build air castles over the roaring\r\ndepths, they look upon the waves, as they surge into each other, as\r\nstable altars of peace and happiness. They command their sons and\r\ndaughters to vow faith in the light of the past, but ere the oath is\r\nfully spoken, the altar is under other skies, encircled by other\r\nhorizons!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSurrounded by friends in gay attire, the bridegroom, full of life and\r\nvigor, rushes into the church. He wears a national dress, _but his\r\nnation is not that of the old man_. The crowd disperse from right to\r\nleft as he passes on, greeting him with lowly bows: scarcely deigning to\r\nreturn the courtesy, he clatters up the aisle with rapid stride, and\r\nstands by the side of the kneeling bride. He places his lips to the ear\r\nof the old man, and whispers to him; they converse in low tones, the old\r\nman with an air of regal authority, the young one gesturing rapidly with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nThe bishops now slowly approach, the tapers are lighted upon the altar,\r\na solemn silence falls upon the holy temple, two hands, two souls are to\r\nbe united forever! A shiver of awe thrills through the assembly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe beams of the setting sun pour in through the stained panes of the\r\nwindows their lines of crimson light, as if streams of blood were\r\nflowing through the church. Deepening in the approaching twilight, they\r\nfall in their dying splendor on the brow of a man who stands alone in\r\none of the side chapels. The figure of a dead hero extended upon a\r\nmonument lies near him, as, immovable as the statue itself, he stands\r\nwith his gaze riveted upon the altar whence the bishop addresses the\r\nbride. The crimson light falling full upon him betrays the secrets of\r\nhis soul, his noble brow tells of fierce struggle within, but neither\r\nprayer, sigh, nor groan escapes him. His lips are closely pressed\r\ntogether, while suppressed anguish writhes them into a stern smile--but\r\nthe streams of ruby light which had shone on his face for the moment,\r\nfade in the twilight, and he is lost in the gloom of the deepening\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut when the vows were all spoken, the ceremonies over, when the\r\nbridegroom raised up the bride, and she fell into the arms of her\r\nfather, when he bore her onward to the gates of the church, with\r\nthousands of tapers following after, when the crowd dispersed, and the\r\nsounds of the footsteps were dying away in the distance, and the\r\ncathedral grew still as the grave, holding only the dead and the few\r\nhalf-living monks moving darkly in its depths--the man on whom had shone\r\nthe crimson light leaves the chapel, comes up the aisle, strikes his\r\nbreast, and falls forward on the steps of the altar, rises suddenly, and\r\nagain falls, then seats himself, while the lights from behind the great\r\ncrucifix of silver shine down solemnly upon him. His face is turned away\r\nfrom the holy things of the sanctuary; his eyes gaze afar, past the\r\ngates through which the bride had vanished. He sees the blue night-sky,\r\nand a single star sparkling upon it, and as he looks upon the star, he\r\ntakes a sword from under his cloak, draws the steel from the scabbard,\r\nand, still gazing upon the star, sharpens it on his whetstone. Thus,\r\nwith widely opened eye, yet seeing, hearing nothing, the somnambulist,\r\nwrapped in deep, magnetic sleep, strides on in the moonlight, possessed\r\nby a power of which he is not conscious, which may stain his hands with\r\nblood, or hold him back from the verge of an abyss. Passion drinks its\r\nglow from the rays of the sun; it may lead us safely, or drive us far\r\nastray!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA monk approaches the man kneeling before the high altar, and says:\r\n\r\n'Brother, whosoever thou mayst be, go to rest, and do not disturb the\r\npeace of the Lord.'\r\n\r\nThe man answers nothing. Another draws near him, saying:\r\n\r\n'Away from the church; be not guilty of sacrilege!'\r\n\r\nThe man makes no reply. A third monk stands beside him and says:\r\n\r\n'I excommunicate thee, and the steel which thou darest to draw at the\r\nvery foot of the cross.'\r\n\r\nThe culprit then rises, and replies:\r\n\r\n'I waited for these words, that the stroke might be certain, and the\r\nblow mortal.'\r\n\r\nHe leaves the church slowly--slowly, as if counting his own footfalls,\r\nknowing them to be his last on earth!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the night falls so softly, the skies hang so transparently\r\nabove, the air is so tranquil, that the soul trembles with delight, and\r\nthe heart unconsciously forebodes happiness. The stars peer up above the\r\nmountains, like the eyes of angels flashing through the blue spaces of\r\nthe heavens. Swathed in her bands of darkness, and breathing up to them\r\nthe perfume of her flowers and the sighs of her lovers, the earth seems\r\ngrateful to them for their golden glances. A fitting night, surely, for\r\na bridal so illustrious as the one we have just seen; a long spring will\r\nbloom from it upon the aged father. What more could he ask for his\r\nchildren? His new son in high favor with the emperor, lord of lands and\r\nserfs; his daughter, good and beautiful as an angel, goes not\r\nportionless into the house of her husband, but is the sole heiress of\r\nimmense estates. What maiden would not envy her; what youth not wish to\r\ntake his place? And the thoughts of the old man run pleasantly on: he\r\nthinks how happily his days will flow, blessed with the smiles of his\r\ndaughter, and surrounded by the splendor of his son. He already sees the\r\nlittle grandchildren springing up before him; flowers blooming along the\r\npathway leading to his grave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA splendid festival is to take place in his castle; few princes would\r\nbe able to give such an entertainment. The grounds are illumined as if\r\nit were day, barrels of pitch are everywhere burning, torches are\r\nblazing high upon his walls, windows and doors are thrown open, harps\r\nsound and trumpets thunder, mazourkas swell upon the ear, and the gay\r\ngroups twine, twist, reel, half mad with joyous excitement. The old man\r\nstrays through the lighted halls, and converses with his guests. Tears\r\ntremble in his eyes. Ah, many tears had gathered there in the troubled\r\ndays of his life, through its hours of sweat and blood, but they are all\r\npassing now into these drops of gratitude to God who has brought him to\r\nthis happy time in which past sorrows are all to be forgotten. Moving\r\nout upon his wide porticos, he pours coins from dishes of silver to the\r\npeople below. Returning, he places clusters of diamonds on the young\r\nbosoms of the bridesmaids. Servants follow his footsteps, bending under\r\nthe wealth they bear, handing to him glittering swords and golden\r\nchains, ostrich plumes, and Turkish scymitars, which, in memory of the\r\nday, he distributes among his guests. Sometimes he stops to take a\r\nchalice from the hands of a page, and wets his lips with Tokay, greeting\r\nhis guests as he moves courteously on, wishing to warm all with the\r\nsunshine of his own happiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe enters now the central dome of the castle, lined with exotic trees\r\nand perfumed plants; the vaulted roof is corniced with wrought marble,\r\nemblazoned with escutcheons of his ancestors, unsullied, glorious, holy!\r\nStopping at the entrance, he looks for his child: she is not among the\r\ndancers, nor in the throngs of the spectators. The bridegroom is indeed\r\nthere, amusing himself with the various beauties present; and, for the\r\nsecond time in this happy day, the forehead of the old man lowers in\r\ngrief or anger. He makes his way through the crowd, passes on through\r\nthe orange trees, in the niches between which stand the now deserted\r\nseats rich in broidered tapestry. He lingers among them seeking his\r\nchild, when he suddenly stops as if stricken with fierce pain. He has\r\nfound her now; she is sitting quite alone, gazing sadly on a bunch of\r\nroses lying on her knee: dreamily she picks off the perfumed leaves,\r\nuntil the bare stems and thorns alone remain in her fragile hands. The\r\nold man silently approaches her. Suppressing his emotion, he says, with\r\ngentle voice:\r\n\r\n'How happy thy poor mother would have been to-day, my daughter! Ah, why\r\nwas it not the will of God she should have blessed this bridal hour!'\r\n\r\nShe raises her head, crushing the remains of the roses in her trembling\r\nhands, and in her confusion tries to fasten them on the hem of her\r\ndress: the sharp little stems plant themselves there, but stain its snow\r\nwith the blood they had torn from the unconscious fingers.\r\n\r\n'Why weepest thou, my child? It cannot surely be the memory of thy\r\nmother which so moves thee: thou hast never seen her--she went to the\r\nfathers in the very hour in which thou camest to me. Look, daughter,\r\nthou woundest thyself!'\r\n\r\nHe takes her hand in his, and softly draws from it the sharp thorns.\r\n\r\n'O father, it is not that which pains me! Forgive me--it is that--only\r\nthat, my father.'\r\n\r\nShe stands silently before him--great tears were falling slowly down her\r\ncheeks. He leans heavily upon her arm:\r\n\r\n'Thou must support me now, child, for I grow old and frail, my knees\r\ntremble under me; be thou my stay!'\r\n\r\nHe walks on thoughtfully with her, trying to speak, but saying nothing,\r\nwhile around them float the perfumes of the flowers, and triumphal music\r\nswells upon the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs they move on, the great clock of the castle strikes the hour. It is\r\nfastened to the moulding high on the wall; over it sits an ancient\r\nmonarch in bronze, a ruler of many kingdoms, and at each stroke the\r\nstatue of a palatine sallies forth, bows to the king of bronze, and\r\nagain disappears within the opening wall--twelve strokes toll as they\r\npass, and twelve palatines appear, make obeisance, and vanish. Hark!\r\nfrom the distant chambers sound the choir of female voices; vague and\r\ndreamy the notes begin, but at each return they grow clearer and more\r\ndefined. They are gliding on from hall to hall, ever drawing nearer and\r\never calling more loudly upon the bride. The old man trembles; the pale\r\ngirl falls into his arms. But soon recovering, she flies on from passage\r\nto passage, from room to room, from gallery to gallery, from vault to\r\nvault, everywhere pursued by the choir of bridesmaids, dragging the old\r\nman with her, not able to utter a single word--while around them breathe\r\nthe perfumes of the flowers, and triumphal music swells upon the air.\r\n\r\nAt last they stop in the chapel of the castle, where the ancestors rest\r\nin their coffins of stone. A few tapers burn around, and black draperies\r\nbroidered with silver flow closely round the tombs. She, the youngest\r\nand last of the proud House, falls upon the grave of her mother,\r\nshudders, but speaks not. The old man says to the trembling girl:\r\n\r\n'Daughter, God did not vouchsafe to give me a male descendant to prolong\r\nthe power of our race; He blessed me only with a maiden; but thy husband\r\nhas sworn to take thy name, and thy children will bear the name of our\r\nfathers. Honor, then, the favor with which God has crowned thee. No lady\r\nin the land is thy equal, heiress as thou art of glory, treasures, and\r\nestates--it is thy duty to be obedient and faithful to thy husband until\r\ndeath.'\r\n\r\nHe speaks to her in soft, low tones; slowly, as if he sought with each\r\nword to touch the heart of the silent child. She answers not, but lower\r\nand lower droops the fair young head, until her pale face is buried in\r\nher white hands, and the bridal wreath and veil fall from her brow upon\r\nthe grave of her mother. A low groan bursts from the heart of the old\r\nman as he cries:\r\n\r\n'Daughter, dost thou hear? they approach to bear thee from the breast on\r\nwhich thou hast rested from thy very birth; to take thee from the arms\r\nof the old man who has so loved thee! Look up, look into my face; thou\r\nart another's now--take leave of me--say, 'Father, I am happy!''\r\n\r\nMore and more closely she presses her hands to her face--and remains\r\ngloomily silent.\r\n\r\n'Child, dost thou really wish to lay me here among the dead? Dost thou\r\ndesire me to rise no more on earth forever? Ah, the love in thy blue\r\neyes has been my solace through my many life-storms. Thou art my single\r\npearl, and I have given thee to the hands of the stranger, that thy\r\nbrilliancy may remain unclouded, that it may ever glitter in its full\r\nsplendor. What is the matter with thee? Speak, child, even if it be to\r\ncomplain, to tell me thou art wretched.'\r\n\r\nGrasping the white marble of the grave with both hands for support, with\r\ngasping breath he awaits her answer. The vengeful sword of remorse is\r\nalready in his soul; one groan, one spasm of anguish from the innocent\r\nvictim would break his heart. Raising her heavy eyelids, his child seems\r\nto trace an expression of pity on his face, and for a moment dreams that\r\nhope is not yet past. Kneeling on the marble of the grave, and turning\r\nher young face, so sweet in its appealing anguish, full upon him, a\r\n_name_ forces itself through her quivering lips--a sudden shivering\r\nshakes the frame of the old man, throwing him off from the grave of his\r\nyoung wife.\r\n\r\n'What name hast thou uttered? It must never be repeated--never! No; it\r\nwere impossible. Tell me I have not heard thee aright; let it rest in\r\neternal oblivion! Thou canst not dream of that ungrateful exile,\r\nconspiring against me because I prepared for him a brilliant future--the\r\nson of my brother joining with my enemies to compass my ruin! If them\r\nregrettest him, if thou hast a single lurking hope that I will ever\r\npermit thee to see that banished rebel, to clasp his hand in even common\r\nfriendship, may the eternal curses of God rest upon you both!'\r\n\r\nA voiceless victim offered up upon the altar of the vengeful gods, the\r\nmaiden has as yet suffered in silence, but rising now in solemn dignity,\r\nin a cold, firm, resolute tone, she says:\r\n\r\n'I love him, father.'\r\n\r\nThe old man cannot bear these chill and fatal words. His brain reels,\r\nhis hopes die, he falls at the foot of the grave, his soul rests for the\r\nmoment with the ghosts of his ancestors. When he awakes to\r\nconsciousness, the pale face of his child is bending tenderly over him,\r\nher caresses call him back to life. Hark! again he hears the sounding\r\nstrophes of the wedding song; the chanting maidens cross the threshold;\r\nslowly singing, they surround the bride with snowy circle; nearer and\r\nnearer they cluster round her--she throws herself for refuge in the old\r\nman's arms!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe maidens now clasp, embrace the trembling bride, take her from her\r\nfather's arms, and bear her on with them. They strew flowers in her\r\npath, burn incense around her, as they chant in ever-renewed chorals the\r\ndawning of a new and happy life, full of honor and blessing. The old man\r\nsolemnly follows the choir until they reach the great stairway leading\r\nto the bridal chamber: there he bids them stop, and, making the sign of\r\nthe cross, for the last time blesses the half-swooning girl.\r\n\r\nHe stands for a moment wrapt in thought, then wends his way to the hall\r\nof feasting. Recovering his presence of mind, he flings aside the truth\r\njust forced upon him, as if it were all a dream; he commands it not to\r\nbe; he almost persuades himself to believe it has never been! Greeting\r\nhis guests anew, his air is calm and regal.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, turning to his friends, exclaims:\r\n\r\n'Companions in arms, with whom I have spent so many joyous hours in camp\r\nand hall, I dedicate to you the hours of this my wedding night; nor will\r\nI seek my bride until the flush of dawn is in the sky. What hour do the\r\nheavens tell?'\r\n\r\nOne of the revellers rises, draws back the curtain from the window, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n'It is just past midnight; the moon rides high in the sky.'\r\n\r\n'Then am I still yours,' exclaims the youth, 'and again I pledge you in\r\nthe rosy wine.' As he speaks he fills the cup of gold studded with\r\ndiamonds, swallows the contents, and passes it to the nearest guest. But\r\nthe heavy palm of the castle's lord rests upon his shoulder. Seizing\r\nanother brimming cup, he says: 'I drain this to thy health, father, and\r\nour guests will surely pledge it with me.'\r\n\r\nThe lord of the castle thanks him not; he points to the open door,\r\nthrough which may be seen, as they wind along the distant galleries and\r\narchways, the retreating forms of the now silent bridesmaids. Shaking\r\nhis blonde curls, the youth answers:\r\n\r\n'These brave men have always served me faithfully; I have sworn to\r\nconsecrate this night to them; we drink and feast together until Aurora\r\nleads the dawn.' Seizing the hands of those nearest to him, he resumes:\r\n'Companions, for this sacrifice swear to pursue, to hunt to death, as I\r\nshall command, the vile mob of rebels and traitors who infest these\r\nmountains.'\r\n\r\nThey give the pledge, while _vivats_ fill the hall. 'Long live our\r\nprince!' The face of the proud old man glimmers with a bluish rage, but\r\nthe loud plaudits, the outstretched arms, the dazzling, naked swords,\r\nthe wild, warlike enthusiasm bewilder his brain, while pride and hate,\r\nsplendor and power, tempting and blinding his soul, veil in fleeting\r\nglitter the broken form of the lonely, weeping, wretched child. He is\r\ncarried away in the excitement of the hour, and the loud voice which had\r\nonce thundered in the battles of _his own_ unhappy land, joins in the\r\ncry: 'Death to the rebels!' Deigning not, however, to remain longer with\r\nthe guests, he sternly beckons to his attendants. They file in order\r\nbefore him with lighted torches. The youth rises, leaves his friends for\r\nan instant, and accompanies to the door of the saloon the old man, who\r\ntakes leave of him with an air of aversion, while the youth returns to\r\nhis friends:\r\n\r\n'By my good sword!' he exclaims, 'I will brook no control. I wedded a\r\nfair girl, not chains nor fetters. Let the dim moon light the solving of\r\nlove's riddle for older maidens; my bride is young and lovely enough to\r\nbear the growing light of dawn.'\r\n\r\nThen taking aim with his Greek knife at the golden boss on the opposite\r\nwall, he strikes it in the centre; the guests follow, aim, and knives\r\nfly through the air, but none strike the centre of the target except\r\nhimself. Full cups are poured to pledge their glorious chief. The flush\r\nof gratified vanity blooms in his young cheek, he caresses his mustache\r\nand plays with his blonde hair, he jokes with his guests; his jests are\r\nkeen, light, witty, piercing like the sting of a wasp, and loud\r\napplauses greet his eager ear. Gliding over the surface of life, knowing\r\nnothing of its depths, he floats gracefully through its shallows. His\r\nblood, quickened by praise, flushes his face, his eye sparkles, his\r\nfeatures play, but his heart is empty, his soul void, his intellect\r\nwithout expansion; he is as vain, weak, and selfish as an old coquette.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nIn their naive songs, our people long remembered the valley in which the\r\nchieftain parted from his comrades. Our fathers called it the Valley of\r\nFarewells; our children so will call it should our songs endure through\r\nanother generation--should not our language, with ourselves, be\r\nextinguished forever!\r\n\r\nIn a valley circled by three hills of gentle slope, whose feet bathe in\r\nthe same stream, but whose tops are widely severed, stands the man who\r\nbut an hour before had borne the ban of excommunication from the altar\r\nof God. Male figures, clad in black from head to foot, with pallid\r\nfaces, and the flash of steel glittering in the moonlight, seem to have\r\nbeen awaiting his appearance, for when they perceive him, the reclining\r\nrise to their feet, the standing descend to the borders of the stream,\r\nbanners are unfurled in the summer's night, but no huzzas break the\r\nsilence. Seating himself upon a rock on the banks of the stream, he is\r\nhimself the first to speak, his voice chiming time with the murmur of\r\nthe waters, as the tones of the singer with the sounding harpstrings.\r\nHis words, though low, reach the hearts of his companions:\r\n\r\n'Soldiers! for some time past I have been your leader, and I am sure you\r\nwill not forget me. Treasure in your memories the last words I shall\r\never address to you, for in them is the old truth, firm as these rocks,\r\nholy as these stars. Our fathers owned this country for thousands of\r\nyears; during all that time, exile, injustice, oppression were utterly\r\nunknown. Its children were numberless as the grains of wheat upon its\r\nplains, as the trees in its interminable forests, and the neighboring\r\nnations gathered for shelter under the shadow of their clustering\r\nsabres. What the ear now never hears, what the eye never sees, but what\r\nthe soul of the brave never ceases to love, was their proud\r\ninheritance--FREEDOM! Then came, with his throngs of slaves, the King\r\nof the South.[A] At first he spake with guileful gentleness, pouring out\r\ntreacherous treasures of gold before us. Differing from us in faith and\r\nlanguage, he strove to unite what God had severed, and when affairs\r\nmoved not in accordance with his wishes, he tried to force himself upon\r\nus with fire and sword. Shame to the dwellers in cities and the lords of\r\nthe valleys! fearing to face the dangers and hardships of life in the\r\ncaves of the mountains, the wilds of the forests, they submitted to the\r\nusurper. But you have buried yourself in them as in graves, therefore\r\nthe day of resurrection will dawn upon you. Already I see the signs of a\r\nbrighter future. Has not the king's own residence been fired and\r\nconsumed? Have we not heard the screams of joy of the vultures over the\r\ndead bodies of his minions, while the wolves howled in chorus the long\r\nnight through? If you would regain the inheritance of our fathers, your\r\nlabor must be long, your best blood flow. Especially now, when from\r\nwandering exiles you have grown into threatening heroes, will the king\r\nstrive to deceive you by glittering baits: but beware of the tempters;\r\ntheir promises are mountains of gold, their performances handfuls of\r\nmud. Look up! There is room enough in these blue skies for brave souls!\r\nRegret not the earth, even should you fall in battle. Even on the other\r\nside of the grave may the face of God be forever dark to him who\r\nconsents to lay down his arms while his country is in bondage!\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Russia]\r\n\r\n'Go not down into the plains to secure the golden grain; your guardian\r\nangel dwells in the mountains--the time is coming when you shall reap a\r\nfull harvest of spoils. Hearken always to the voices of the Seven who\r\nappointed me your leader. Their arms are weary with age and heavy work,\r\nbut wisdom reigns supreme over the ruins of their wornout bodies. Obey\r\nthem. When they call upon you, defend them to the last; whom they shall\r\nappoint chief, follow in dauntless courage; conquer with him, as you\r\nhave always conquered with me! Soldiers, another fate demands me now. No\r\nmorrow dawns for me upon this earth. Brothers, I bid you farewell\r\nforever!'\r\n\r\nThe summer moon shines brightly down upon the little band of heroes.\r\nThey start to their feet, and, gliding silently from every direction,\r\nthey assemble round their chief, twining about him in a gloomy circle.\r\n\r\n'Where art thou going, our brave chieftain?'\r\n\r\nStretching out his arm, he points toward the flame which still throws a\r\npale light over the plain.\r\n\r\n'Stay! It is the flame of the wedding festival glaring from the halls of\r\nthy ancestors. We will not suffer thee to go to those who would take thy\r\nlife; to the maiden who has betrayed thee!'\r\n\r\nHe starts suddenly from the rock; his shrill cry pierces the hearts of\r\nthe warriors:\r\n\r\n'Malign her not with falsehood! She has not betrayed me. This very night\r\nshe will be mine. We will rest together in the long sleep of eternity.\r\nComrades, I have consecrated to you the house and riches of my fathers;\r\nlife and bliss with the woman I love I have sacrificed on the altar of\r\nmy country; but death with her I cannot relinquish--the moment is\r\nnear--no time is to be lost--I go. Farewell!'\r\n\r\nHe passes hurriedly through them; the long folds of his cloak, the locks\r\nof his hair, the plumes of his cap, stream wildly on the breeze. Cries\r\nrise on the midnight air; they kneel before him, they circle round him,\r\nthey stand a living wall before him, they entreat him to stop, they\r\nthreaten to storm the castle, to take it before the dawn of day, to\r\nseize the bride, and bear her safely to his arms.\r\n\r\nHe stays his hurrying footsteps, and the eager men fall into respectful\r\nsilence. His voice is heard, sounding sweet indeed, but firm and deep as\r\nthey have often heard it in the midst of battle-smoke and thunder:\r\n\r\n'I thank you from my heart; my brothers. But it cannot be! The clashing\r\nof our sabres must not wake the old man sleeping in the chambers of my\r\nforefathers. I grew up under the shadow of his hand. He first taught my\r\nlips to utter the holy word which names the land of our fathers; he\r\nplanted in my soul the thirst for glory. Before our holy banners float\r\nagain from the walls of his castle, I must sleep in death! Fate has\r\ninexorably decreed it. Once more, farewell!'\r\n\r\nHe moves rapidly on, muttering to himself: 'What the priest of God has\r\nbound, man may not untie--it must be _cut_ asunder!' Unconsciously\r\ndrawing his sword, he raises it in the air, the glittering blade\r\nflashing like a meteor in the rays of the summer moon.\r\n\r\nIn silence and with drooping heads the soldiers follow--they know that\r\nwhat he says will surely come to pass. Predictions of his approaching\r\ndoom had long been current among them; he had himself warned them the\r\nhour of separation was near. Not by the sword of the near enemy, nor by\r\nthe arrow of the distant one, was he fore-doomed to fall. Not slowly was\r\nhe to fade away upon a bed of mortal sickness: his own dreams and\r\nforeign magic had announced to him another doom! The conspirators move\r\nsilently and solemnly on behind him, as if following a corpse. He\r\nalready seems to them a spirit. But when he commenced the ascent of the\r\nhill, the long plumes of his cap streaming through rocks and trees,\r\nappearing and disappearing as he clambers up, they rush into pursuit.\r\nSeparated only by mossy banks and rocky terraces, they seek the same\r\nhilltop. He reaches it the first. Before him flashes upon his eyes a\r\nfull view of the illuminated castle with its towers and battlemented\r\nturrets; at his feet lies the abyss, thundering with the roar of falling\r\nwaters. An enormous pine has fallen over and bridges the chasm. His men\r\nare close upon him; again they try to surround him; pushing off the\r\nnearest, he leaps upon the trunk of the gigantic pine, crawls forward\r\nupon it, hangs for a moment over the abyss, reaches the other side,\r\ndescends with marvellous agility, plants himself firmly on the ground,\r\nwith feverish strength tears out the trunk from the rocks which had held\r\nit fast; it trembles for a moment as if swung in a balance; he urges,\r\nhurls it on, and at last it falls, crushing and shivering as it strikes\r\nheavily against the steep sides of the rocky chasm. The soldiers feel as\r\nif dazzled by a sudden flash of lightning, and when the glare passes, it\r\nis too late! In the light of the moon they see for the last time his\r\nbroad brow in the full beauty of life--then the abyss separates them\r\nforever. Holding his hands out, suspended above the chasm, as if with\r\nhis last breath he would bless his people, he cries:\r\n\r\n'In the name of God, heroes, eternal struggle between you and the King\r\nof the South!'\r\n\r\nThe rocks echo the full tones of the manly voice, and the depths of the\r\nvalley repeat it. His tall form disappears among the shadows of the\r\npines. The conspirators listen as if hoping to catch one word more. No\r\nsound greets them save the sighing of the trees, the dash of the\r\nwaters--the manly tones of their young hero they will hear no more\r\nforever!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnfortunate! the glare of madness gleams in thine eyes. While thou wert\r\nexposed to the gaze of thy brothers thou struggledst to control thyself,\r\nbecause thou wouldst not their last memory of thee should be clouded;\r\nbut now thou art alone, thou throwest off restraint, and, driven on by\r\nvengeance, hurriest forward. Thou startlest the owl as thou scalest the\r\nrocks; she flaps her wing, and gazes on thee with round eyes of wonder;\r\nthe fox, baying in the moonlight, steals into the gloom; the wolves\r\nhowl in the ravine as thou rushest through--thou hearest not their\r\ncries, they fly before the wild splendor of thine eyes! Thou readiest\r\nthe plain. Corpse-lights from the swamps flit on with thee; wildly\r\nlaughing, thou criest: 'Race on with me, friends!' They dance round thy\r\ncap, and bathe thy breast with streams of pale, blue light; then, joined\r\nin brotherly embrace, for a moment ye speed together on; but the\r\ngrave-lights are the first to die; then, a solitary shadow, thou\r\nflittest darkly over the meadows, and approachest the castle of thine\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nIt shines with innumerable lights. The terraced gardens with their walks\r\nand perfumed shrubs lie so silently in the bright moonlight, they seem\r\ndreaming of the bridal bliss, the echo of the wedding music cradling\r\nthem to sweeter sleep. The flying footsteps of the chieftain are\r\nsuddenly arrested--he thinks he hears the opening chant of the\r\nbridesmaids' song, though so distant it seems rather dream than reality.\r\nHe listens. He knows the ancient custom; he certainly hears the chorused\r\nstrophes, the fresh, clear female voices, He rushes forward now, he\r\nburies his nails in the fissures of the walls, he clambers up,\r\nsuspending himself in the air, his feet cling to the moss-grown stones,\r\nhe seizes a vine, swings himself forward, gains the top of the wall, and\r\nthe crushed grasses groan as he leaps down upon them. Having touched the\r\nearth within the enclosure, he rises up with triple power, and bounds\r\ninto the leafy labyrinth. Oaks, ashes, pines, and firs, the remains of\r\nthe great forest, are around him. Thickets, vineyards, and meadows lie\r\nin the moonlight, brooks and fountains murmur, nightingales sing; he\r\nreaches the trailing willows where the long branches droop into the blue\r\nwaters of the lake, from whose depths the stars of heaven smile upon\r\nhim. He had played under these trees as a happy boy, swum in these clear\r\nwaves--but the memories of the past must not detain him now. He reaches\r\nthe bower where the jessamines bloom at the foot of the lower terrace.\r\nThis was the spot in which the maiden had revealed her soul to her\r\nexiled brother; here had her holy promise kindled her blue eyes, and the\r\nhigh resolve of its keeping rested on her pure brow;--he groans aloud,\r\nbut stops not, keeping his face steadily turned to the gray wall of the\r\ncastle. Certain of his course, whether in light or shadow, he still\r\nhurries on. Winding among orange trees and fountains, he enters the\r\nvaulted archway which leads to the castle. Ascending with every step, he\r\nstands at last upon a level with its pillared portico. Taking the long\r\nplume from his cap, he glides from beneath the vault of the archway. No\r\none is near. Songs and shouts are on his left; there then must be the\r\nhall of festival. Silence reigns on his right, and the long ranges of\r\nwindows glitter only with the light of the moon. At the end of the long\r\ngallery and near the angle of the western tower, lamps are still\r\nburning; a wide glass door stands partly open--it seems to him he hears\r\na low moan, but so light, so inaudible, it is caught through the\r\ndivining of the soul rather than by the hearing of the ear. But he has\r\nheard it. Leaving the shadow of the vaulted passage, he emerges into the\r\nlight, like one rising from the dead; imploring his steps not to betray\r\nhim, and supporting himself on balustrades and pillars, he glides on. As\r\nhe approaches the half-open door, he sees the long veils of the windows\r\nfloating like snow-wreaths in the air; behind these thin curtains he\r\nfeels that Life and Death, hand clasped in hand, await him. He falters,\r\nstops, presses his hand on his heart, but his fingers encounter the cold\r\nsteel of his sword; he grasps it firmly, approaches, leans his forehead\r\non the panes of the wide gothic door--strange that the throbbing brain\r\nburst not its narrow bounds!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sees nothing at first but fiery sparks and black spots from the\r\nseething of his heated brain. The long muslin draperies are sometimes\r\nlifted by the wind, and again close their veils of mist; the silver lamp\r\nflashes on his eyes for a moment, and again vanishes from his view; but,\r\nas his sight grows clearer, the great mirror with its frame of gold\r\nstands before him--necklaces, bracelets, and chains flash from the\r\ntoilet before it. He trembles no longer, he ceases to make the sign of\r\nthe cross, he sees distinctly now--under the floating flow of purple\r\ndrapery the bride is sitting on the bed alone. The flowers thrown over\r\nher by the choir of singing bridesmaids still cluster on her hair and\r\nbreast; her little feet are almost buried in the fallen rose leaves. She\r\nsighs as if utterly unconscious of herself, thoughtless of the pain she\r\nsuffers--as if her life were only anguish! The flowers droop from her\r\nbosom and glide to the ground; and, as the violets, myrtles, and lilies\r\nfall over her dress of snow, the great tears roll slowly down her pallid\r\ncheeks with every deep-drawn sigh.\r\n\r\nThe door creaks on its hinges, her arms are thrown up involuntarily, her\r\nneck is outstretched, like that of a frightened deer startled by the\r\nbaying of the hounds. She listens, waits, hears something move, starts\r\nup, and flies into the depths of the chamber, seizes the floating\r\ncurtains, wraps herself in the folds, unwinds them from about her, flies\r\non, turns, starts, stops, then suddenly falling on her knees, cries\r\naloud: 'THOU!' Her last hope is in that word, but all strength fails her\r\nnow, and she stands fixed to the spot with rigid face and form of\r\nmarble. Steps and voices, which had been heard a moment before, die away\r\nin the distance. He whom she had so passionately invoked stands before\r\nher; he presses her not to his heart, but she hears the whisper: 'I AM\r\nHERE!'\r\n\r\nShe blooms into new life, and with a melancholy smile of wondrous\r\nsweetness, murmurs:\r\n\r\n'I knew, I knew thou wouldst be with me in this solemn hour. Dost thou\r\ncurse me in thy heart? But hear me: no one approaches, we are alone, I\r\nmay yet have time to tell thee all. When they led me to the church, I\r\nsought thee everywhere; when I kneeled before the altar, I could only\r\nseek thee with my soul, my eyes were too dim with tears for sight; and\r\nwhen, on my return to the castle--they felicitated me, I listened for\r\nthy voice to thunder o'er them all! And even here, where each moment was\r\nfreighted with coming shame and anguish, my faith never left me. I sat\r\nin utter torpor, but my soul saw thee in thy flight across the distant\r\nhills, my heart felt thee as thou camest through the gardens and up the\r\nterraced way. What I divined is true, Give me thy hand--I am saved!\r\nsaved!'\r\n\r\nGracefully as the light sprays of the willow, she sways toward him, and\r\ntrustfully leans on his strong arm.\r\n\r\nWho has ever felt in dreams his soul torn from hell, and borne by angels\r\ninto heaven? Who has ever known what it was to be God's own child for a\r\nfleeting moment--felt the lightning flash of heaven-bliss gleam through\r\nhis heart? He had expected to meet one faithless to her vows; but as the\r\nvoice of simple truth and love thrills through his innermost being, he\r\ngrows omnipotent, immortal. His youth only begins from this hour! it\r\nsoars aloft--one wing is love, the other glory; his ashes shall be\r\nworthy to mingle with those of his fathers! He will return to his\r\ndeserted comrades, and she, the beloved, will follow him, for does not\r\nshe, now clinging in holy trust to his arm, seem willing to give into\r\nhis hands the whole web of her future destiny? Its threads shall be of\r\ngold, and the sun of love shall shine ever upon it. Weave the brilliant\r\nmist in glittering woof, O glowing imagination of youth I Beautiful\r\ncloud-dreams, which the setting sun of life paints and flushes with his\r\ndying rays!\r\n\r\nBut suddenly awaking from his fevered visions, he cries: 'Why hast thou\r\nset this ring on thy finger? Would it not have been far better to have\r\nsought refuge in the mountains, than to have bound thyself to another by\r\nthe holy sacrament of marriage? Yet will I save thee, for my comrades\r\nare brave and obedient, and I am their leader!'\r\n\r\n'O God! thou questionest me about the Past, when not a single hour of\r\nthe Present is our own! Dost thou still doubt me? Dost thou not\r\ncomprehend me? I have plighted my troth to thee in truth, have sworn\r\nthat thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. I will keep my\r\nvow. Thou doubtest me, and must hear all. Interrupt me not. Unsheathe\r\nthy sword; if they approach, I will throw myself into thy arms. When the\r\ntime came to tell my father all, to bid him the last good by, he begged\r\nme sore, entreated me with many tears. Thou knowest with what a stern\r\nvoice he is wont to command, how instantaneously he is accustomed to be\r\nobeyed; but he veiled the thunders of his wrath with tears, he sighed\r\nand wailed, saying that his only child was armed to strike him to the\r\nheart, to thrust him into the grave. The prince, the son-in-law of his\r\nchoice, promised to take our name; he brought his serfs and retainers in\r\ncrowds to the castle, and said to the old man: 'Lo, they shall all be\r\nthine!' Kneeling before me, my father placed my hand upon his silver\r\nhair; I felt the blood bounding and throbbing in his bare temples, and\r\non his grand old forehead lay the dream of his whole life gasping in its\r\ndeath agonies. The cruel phantom of dominion and power, hateful to me,\r\nclutched me through the heart of the only parent I have ever known. His\r\nlife or death was in my hands. A divine power swayed my soul; I resolved\r\nupon self-sacrifice. Consent quivered from my shrinking lips--I gave my\r\ntrembling hand to the unknown, unloved, insupportable. Alas! all are\r\nalike abhorrent to me who speak not with thy voice, look not with thy\r\neyes, breathe not with thy breath, love not with thy soul! The lord of\r\nthe castle has now a son in place of his slight girl, and thousands of\r\nwarriors stand ready to defend the old Home of our haughty race. Thus am\r\nI free, now may I take leave of all. Again I pledge to thee my faith;\r\nthy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. But this people, this\r\nGod, this plighted faith--knowest thou by what name it is called\r\nto-day?'\r\n\r\nThe chieftain throws his arm round her slight form, and looking\r\nanxiously toward the gallery, says: 'Speak and tell me while it is yet\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\nWith low, reproachful tone, she answers: 'Can it be possible that thou\r\ndost not know? And yet there is no room for doubt--it is DEATH! So long\r\nas I remain on earth, I am the wife of the foreigner. Thou canst regain\r\nme only in the land of spirits; but the way is short--look! it is only\r\nthe length of thy sword!'\r\n\r\nThe word 'wife' falls from the soft lips like a stone on the heart of\r\nthe chief, awakening him from the last dream he will ever dream on this\r\nearth. Yes. His sword would protect her from the pursuit of father and\r\nhusband, but he cannot save her from the condemnation of the church, its\r\nexcommunication; for what the priest of God has bound, that man may not\r\nunloose! It grows cold and dark in his sinking heart. A single moment of\r\nhappiness, alas, now forever past! has robbed him of strength, of hope;\r\nhe shivers with awe; he sees the long skeleton finger of the pale\r\nPhantom of Terror touch the young heart of the faithful maiden. But\r\n_that_ will be impossible--he cannot take her life--he will fly, and\r\nfall on the morrow with his braves in battle--she shall live--the\r\nloveliest of human forms shall still remain on earth. He groans, and\r\nbreaks away from her--the walls seem crumbling before him, breaking into\r\ntears of blood--he flies--but his sister overtakes him at the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n'Where dost thou fly, unfaithful? Didst thou not come to release me?\r\nWouldst thou brand me with dishonor--with infamy and shame? Betray me\r\nnot. O God! canst thou think of deserting me now! Listen! The foreigner\r\nis already on his way to sully with his hot and pestilential breath the\r\npurity of thy beloved. And what would be my future fate shouldst thou\r\ndeliver me into the hands of mine enemy, to his hated embraces? He will\r\nforce me to the court of the King of the South. I must there bear my\r\npart amid strange faces, surrounded by falsehood and pride, and learn to\r\nsmile on those I loathe. He will lead me to the court that he may boast\r\nof my beauty, that he may show his king he has gathered the pale flower\r\nof the ancient House. And what will be the course of the king, what that\r\nof the prince, my husband? Look at the old, and learn! They curse in old\r\nage what they worshipped in youth; they love what they once scorned.\r\nWhat has thus transformed them? Time. Time, the murderer, who in his\r\nreckless culture plants fresh roses on the ruined wall, will draw and\r\nthicken the veil of delusion over my face until my true features shall\r\nbe stifled behind it. I shall be utterly alone--alone forever! Thou wilt\r\nbe afar, on the mountains, rocks, or in the deserts; temptation will\r\nsurround me, and disgust possess my soul. Thou mayst be brought in\r\nchains to the land of the King of the South, thine enemies may name me\r\nthere over their beaded cups of ruby wine, jeers and scandals may reach\r\nthine ears, and thou wilt curse thyself that thou didst not kill me!\r\nThrust thy sword into my heart! Tear me from the grasp of the monster!'\r\n\r\nAs if in sudden madness, she wildly stretches out her hands as if to\r\npush away the thronging phantoms which appal her.\r\n\r\n'Look! his forehead sparkles--a word is written there in blazing\r\ndiamonds--read it--it is INFAMY! Hell glitters in his eyes; his writhing\r\narms are hissing vipers; they crawl to me, they touch me, wind around\r\nme, bury their heads in my bosom, and poison as they drink my pure blood\r\nfrom the virginal cup of my heart!'\r\n\r\nShe falls exhausted on the floor, washing his feet with her tears as her\r\nlong tresses stream around them.\r\n\r\nHe lifts her like a feather from the ground.\r\n\r\n'By the Holy Mother of our Lord, such fate shall not be thine! Like the\r\nflame of incense burning on the sacred altar, purest among the pure,\r\nthou shalt ascend to God!'\r\n\r\nHis heart breaks, his manly features flicker and quiver like the mist;\r\nstrange spasms distort them; he bows his head in anguish, and with every\r\ntear from her eyes mingle the bitter drops only shed by man.\r\n\r\nBut this is over now. It was the last sign of weakness, hesitation,\r\nregret, wrung from him in his mortal agony. A solemn calm rests on his\r\nbroad brow as he presses the maiden to his heart.\r\n\r\n'With this kiss of peace I consecrate thee to a holy death! He who first\r\nbreathed upon thy young cheek, first touched thy rosy lip, who may not\r\ngive thee his name in the sanctity of marriage, who cannot save thee\r\nfrom condemnation--will give thee DEATH! In this thought I sought thee,\r\nmy sister; but when I found thee faithful, loving, a sudden dream of\r\nbliss deceived me. Lulled by lovely visions, the weak one yielded to\r\nunmanly hopes, unmanly fears! Forgive him, virgin hero! Temptation and\r\nfear have fled forever--we will die together--let us pray!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Let us pray! but thou must remain to lead thy people. Longing, but\r\npatient, I will await thee in Hades. Thou wilt often come to the spot in\r\nwhich they will bury me, to throw a plume from thy helmet, a ring from\r\nthy coat of mail upon the grassy mound. And the old grave-digger will\r\nsay: '_He_ was here to-night; she is still remembered by the chieftain.'\r\n\r\nWith pure, confiding glance she reads his soul; her eyes sparkle through\r\nthe mist of tears, and a faint smile writhes her pale young lips. With\r\niron grasp he holds her to his heart.\r\n\r\n'With my _soul_ I wed thy _soul_ before the Great White Throne of God,\r\nour Judge!'\r\n\r\nIn softer, sadder tone, he adds: 'While in my power, I served our people\r\nwith my whole might. I have raised our white eagle on the castles of our\r\nenemies. To morrow my comrades will pass these walls--ah! thou dost not\r\nknow, had I lived another day, whose gray hairs might have been\r\nscattered in the coming whirlwind, or in whose courts I might have been\r\nforced to take my seat as avenger! We will go hence together, my sister.\r\nAnd where we go, the old men will not desert their country, the young\r\nmen will not be forced to dishonor the gray hairs of those who first\r\ntaught them the meaning of patriotism and honor; _there_ treason and\r\noppression are unknown--there will be no _necessary vengeance_ in the\r\nLand of the Hereafter! Let us go, sister!'\r\n\r\nTransfigured by a sublime exultation, she throws herself into the arms\r\nof the chieftain; words and tears are no longer sufficient to thank him;\r\nbut love has taught her how it may be done. Suddenly drawing from her\r\nfinger the glittering ring of the enemy, she moves rapidly to the head\r\nof the bridal bed, and places it upon the rich embroidery of the laced\r\npillows. Then returning to the chief, she presses his hand to her heart:\r\n\r\n'Earth is past, and Heaven begun. Thou art henceforth my lord and master\r\nforever!'\r\n\r\nShe kneels at his side, and begins to recite the prayers for the dying.\r\nHe kneels beside her, sometimes reciting with her, sometimes wrapt in\r\nsolemn silence. After a few moments, he breaks upon her prayers:\r\n\r\n'The morning twilight is upon us.'\r\n\r\nAs he speaks, the little birds awake; their matin song sounds from the\r\nwell-known grove.\r\n\r\n'Lean on my arm, beloved; let us look once more upon the earth we leave\r\nso soon together!'\r\n\r\nShe leans heavily upon his arm, and they stand on the threshold of the\r\ndoor opening upon the gallery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fading moon dies out beyond the mountains; her last rays fall upon\r\nthe turf of the terraced gardens; long wreaths of mist and vapor rise in\r\nthe air like bridal veils, floating and reddening in the early dawn. In\r\nthis fatal moment the luring promises and lovely images of life stand\r\nbefore her. The murmurs of the lulling fountains fall upon her ear, then\r\nflash upon her eye; the shafts and groups of pillars of her ancestral\r\nhome cluster around her, and the summer flowers greet her with their\r\nperfume. But death, not life, is in her heart. The pathway through the\r\nold forest whitens in the coming light, the grain waves in the open\r\nfields; beyond them, faintly flushing in the twilight, stand the\r\nmountain tops above which _his_ star of glory might have risen that very\r\nmorn--and yet the whole horizon to him now is but the grave of eternal\r\nforgetfulness! He gazes far into the mountains, boldly sending his last\r\ngreetings to the faithful there; while she, with drooping head, presses\r\never closer to him, asking from him now the look of love, now the thrust\r\nof death! In vain the gradual awaking of the world admonishes them more\r\nand more loudly that they have nothing more to do with time, that\r\neternity is upon them--they linger still! Who may say what thoughts are\r\nthronging through their souls! More and more heavily she sinks upon the\r\ntrue heart of her brother, while the morning breeze plays with the long\r\ntresses of her golden hair.\r\n\r\nHark! loud voices pledge a noisy health in one of the distant rooms--he\r\nshudders, but perhaps she hears no longer; heavy footsteps tramp along\r\nthe gallery--the light of torches flickers in the morning breeze.\r\n\r\n'O God, thou wilt surely give the victory to my country!' cries the\r\nchieftain, as he carries the benumbed and half-lifeless form of the\r\nbride within the wedding chamber.\r\n\r\nThe drunken companions of the long revel reel and totter along the\r\ngalleries of the castle; the bridegroom hastens to his bride with the\r\ndawn of day.\r\n\r\n'Look!' she exclaims, stretching out her hands to the great mirror\r\nbefore which they stand, but in her bewilderment no longer recognizing\r\nher own figure there: 'Look! how beautiful my angel is!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, too beautiful!' the youth repeats, with a bitter groan; then,\r\npressing her to his breast with one arm, from the other flashes the\r\ndeadly gleam of glittering steel--and in that very moment the heavy\r\nfootsteps of the light-minded, reckless bridegroom reach the threshold\r\nof the bridal chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe old man sits upon the ancient bed of state, in the room which had\r\nbeen occupied by his father before him, in which his grandfathers and\r\ngreat-grandfathers had lived and died. Careless of repose for his tired\r\nand aged body, he has not undressed, but motioning off his attendants\r\nwith impatient gesture, ungirding his sabre, and throwing off the chain\r\nof gold to which the royal medal was attached, his head sinks weariedly\r\nand sadly upon the oaken table before him. Beyond the bedstead, a gothic\r\narchway vaults through the wall into his private chapel, the antique\r\nlamp of gold still burns upon its altar. He turns not there, as is his\r\ncustom, to say his prayers before he goes to rest--he knows no sleep\r\nto-night will close his heavy eyelids. Raising his head, he looks slowly\r\nround at the pictures of his ancestors hung about him; with their fixed,\r\nimmovable pupils they return his gaze; but when he would again run round\r\nthe circle of the faces of the dead, his eyelids fall, his sight is\r\nveiled by swimming tears.\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought, young men, sons of the growing light and lovers\r\nof the storm, how it must be in the souls of the old when all their\r\nplans of life fail, when their _last_ loves on earth are blighted? Ah,\r\nyou cannot imagine this, you have not yet tasted the bitter gall of age!\r\nWilling slaves, Time bears you forward on his mighty wings, cleaving\r\nspace with arrowy, unceasing motion, and though the stars die out behind\r\nyou as he bears you on, yet new ones ever burst upon you as you advance.\r\n\r\n'On! on! the infinite is before us!' you cry as you fly. _But the old\r\nhave no to-morrows!_ the coffin lies across their threshold, and but one\r\nsingle star shines down upon them. They kneel to it, and pray: 'Thou art\r\npure and steadfast. Thou fallest not like the meteor bursting in the\r\nwarm summer sky, nor settest like the moon in the far-off lakes of\r\nyouth. After our long and restless journey, we bask in thy serene light.\r\nBe faithful to us, shine benignly upon us, that our House may live, that\r\nour descendants may enjoy the earth!'\r\n\r\nBut even while they pray, the _truth_ creeps into their courtyards,\r\nglides like a serpent on their castle walls, writhes over the threshold,\r\nand, seating herself upon a coffin, chants the death song of delusion,\r\nand as she sings, the last star falls from the sky, and eternal night\r\nbecomes the name of the world.\r\n\r\nBehold! No glittering haze or golden woof remains in the hands of the\r\nold man from the dying glow of his long Indian summer. Hearken! his\r\ndaughter's tears are falling fast on the burning embers of his soul. The\r\nlaughter of the careless husband blasts his ear. He starts from the bed,\r\nstalking up and down the room with rapid strides. The snows of seventy\r\nwinters have in vain blanched his head; he has been proud of his\r\naccumulated wisdom, but has not divined the secret of life! The\r\nwhirlpool of terror, vengeance, vacillation, resolution, engulfs him in\r\nits giddy flow; his soul is on the wheel of torture, his old heart\r\nthrobs on the rack of passion. He curses the King of the South--the\r\nprince, his son-in-law--himself; but his heart will not break until a\r\nnew day dawns upon the earth!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompletely worn out at last with his restless striding to and fro, he\r\nfalls into the old state chair with its broidered blazonry and gilt\r\nescutcheons. His arms hang loosely at his side, his legs fall listlessly\r\ndown, his wide open eye is fixed unconsciously on the opposite wall; his\r\nlips are motionless, and yet the tones of his own voice are ringing\r\nthrough his ears; he lies in immovable and rigid torpor, and yet it\r\nseems to himself that he is rapidly traversing the long galleries of the\r\ncastle. He enters the hall of feasting, sees the prince seated among the\r\nthrong of revellers, to whom he hears himself cry: 'Away! away, prince,\r\nfrom an alien soil! My ancestors have risen from the grave to drive thee\r\nhence! Black hetman man, long since buried, strike the foaming cup from\r\nhis reckless hands! Roman cardinal, dying in sanctity, pronounce upon\r\nhim the thunders of excommunication, and let the church divorce him from\r\nthe daughter of our line!'\r\n\r\nThe great doors are thrown open, the muffled steps of the dead are heard\r\nas they advance from their graves in the Chapel of the Castle, and the\r\nspirits evoked glide solemnly in. The bridegroom, seizing his sword with\r\none hand, and lifting the cup to his lips with the other, drinks gayly\r\nto the health of the illustrious dead! The old man looks round for a\r\nsword, strives to reach the bright blade hanging on the distant wall,\r\nprays to God to help him to grasp it more speedily, falls to the floor,\r\ndrags himself forward on his knees until he meets the Roman cardinal,\r\nwhose scarlet robes are bleached and dim with the damp, mould, and\r\nstains of the grave. The church dignitary, laying his icy hand upon his\r\nforehead, says:\r\n\r\n'_What the holy priest of God has joined together, that may man not put\r\nasunder!_'\r\n\r\nThe dead vanish, the hall of festival is riven in twain, the walls\r\ncrumble, he sees himself again in his own chamber, sleeping in the\r\nescutcheoned chair of his ancestors. Silence, horror, and remorse are\r\naround him--and at this moment the great clock of the palatines strikes\r\ntwo!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHorrible and still more horrible grows the vision. The lamp is still\r\nburning in bluish flame, sending a mystic light through the vaulted\r\narchway of the chapel beyond the state bed. 0 God! a white figure kneels\r\nand groans upon the steps of the altar, then, drawing back, approaches\r\nhis chair; her bands are meekly crossed upon her breast; like the marble\r\ndrapery of a statue, her robe falls in countless snowy folds, none of\r\nwhich are broken in the onward-gliding motion of the shrouded form. O\r\nGod! he knows that lovely face, he has loved it well; it is the sweet\r\ncountenance of his young wife: the lips open, but the voice is not as of\r\nold, tender and confiding; it is reproachful--commanding. He tries to\r\nanswer, but cannot force a word through his eager lips; he cannot\r\nstretch forth his hand to greet her, but feels himself forced to follow\r\nher wheresoever she may choose to lead him. Down, down through the dark\r\nand narrow vaults of the castle, through the sepulchre where she was\r\nburied, passing by her own coffin without stopping, up through the old\r\narmory, through coats of mail, helmets, and swords, on--on--she reaches\r\nthe western tower--passes through the treasury--ascends the\r\nstaircase--bolts draw, and locked doors, like silent lips, open\r\nnoiselessly before. She beckons the old man on--on, to the arched door,\r\nup to the loophole in the wall looking into the bridal chamber of the\r\nladies of the castle--there the dead form stops, and beckons him to draw\r\nnear and look within.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO God! close by the wedding bed and before the great mirror, he sees his\r\ndaughter in the arms of an armed man; he knows the flashing eye and\r\nbroad brow of the exile; he hears her familiar voice, sweet, sonorous,\r\nand penetrating as the tones of the harmonica. A glittering blade is in\r\nthe hand of the man; his daughter speaks in clear, full tones:\r\n\r\n'Strike! strike boldly! it is not thou who dealest the blow--my father\r\nhas already killed me!' She rises to meet the stroke of the keen steel\r\nof the chieftain, as if she welcomed a deliverer. The old man tries to\r\ntear asunder the loophole with his hands, but the cold granite does not\r\nmove--then it seems to him he falls upon his knees, and shouts to his\r\nkinsman:\r\n\r\n'Stop thy rash hand! I will give her to thee as wife. I will fight with\r\nthee the King of the South; do not kill her, my good daughter, my only\r\nchild!'\r\n\r\nThey hear him not; a darkish light is creeping along the walls, the\r\nlamps are dying out, loud talking is heard on the gallery, the\r\nhalf-drunken bridegroom comes leaping and reeling on, rushes into the\r\nchamber, suddenly seems transfixed to the floor, puts his hand to his\r\nsword, but not finding it at his side, looks back, calls aloud, but no\r\none follows him. Horror, like living death, paralyzes the old man. The\r\nbridegroom throws himself upon the exile, who exclaims solemnly, as he\r\nthrusts him aside:\r\n\r\n'Why do you profane the peace of the dead?'\r\n\r\nSomething glitters--flashes through the air--once--twice--thrice--a\r\nfaint cry--the lamps die out one after the other--a single one still\r\nburns over the great mirror, and by its flickering light the old man\r\nsees the figures of the armed man and the snowy maiden, drenched in\r\ngore, reel, totter, heave, whirl in strange confusion--grow to enormous\r\nheight, mount, sink, fall. At this very moment the great clock of the\r\npalatines strikes three--and awakes the old man in the sleeping chamber\r\nof his ancestors, stretched at the foot of the escutcheoned chair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis attendants, hearing a noise, throng into his room with hurrying\r\nsteps and flaming torches; they find their lord lying prostrate on the\r\nfloor with bleeding hands and agitated air. He starts to his feet,\r\ncrying:\r\n\r\n'Save my child! Kill my brother's son!' They crowd around him. 'Is it\r\nstill night, or does the day _really_ dawn?'\r\n\r\nHe staggers to the oaken table, seizes his sword, draws it from the\r\nsheath; the handle turns in his trembling hands, the blade falls to the\r\nground; again he grasps it, while great tears rain down from his haggard\r\neyes. The attendants cluster round him, kneel before him, and entreat\r\nhim to tell them clearly what he would have them do.\r\n\r\n'Follow me! follow me!' he pants in broken voice. He hurries to the\r\ndoor, half borne on by his people; passes along the corridor, wrestling\r\nwith faintness and giddiness as a strong swimmer battles with the waves.\r\nThe attendants gaze from one to the other, making the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\nThe swooning and delirium of the old man over, the retainers follow him\r\nas he totters on to the wedding chamber. Profound repose seems to rest\r\nupon the castle; through the wide range of open double doors the grand\r\nsaloon of festival is clearly seen; the tables are deserted, and the\r\nlights dying in their sockets. The morning twilight is already stealing\r\nin through the open windows. Strange! the pages bearing the torches\r\nbefore the old lord come to a sudden halt; a man runs toward them round\r\nthe sharp angle of the gallery; his hair is in confusion, his robe\r\nsoiled and torn; no dagger in his belt nor sword at his side; his lips\r\nare blue and shivering, his brow pallid; he looks as if Death were\r\nbreathing on him as he passed, and he fled in terror from the fleshless\r\nphantom.\r\n\r\n'The father must not advance another step;' and stretching his arms\r\ntoward the old man, he seizes one of his hands.\r\n\r\n'Where is thy wife? Speak, and tell me!'\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom kneels before him: 'Stop, father; go back to thine own\r\nchamber; waken not thy sleeping daughter so early.'\r\n\r\n'Thou sayest: 'Awake her not.' Will she _ever_ again waken? Speak\r\nquickly. Tell me the naked truth, for evil spirits filled my sleep with\r\ndreams of terror. I saw her pleading for death, but thou wast unarmed as\r\nnow; and another stood near, who murdered the child I gave thee. Speak!\r\nWas this all a horrid dream, a fearful jest of the summer's night to\r\nappal my soul?'\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom bows his head under the unendurable weight of this\r\nquestion. He shudders, and with lifted hand tries to turn the old man\r\nback.\r\n\r\n'Ha! thou darest not speak--thou art silent, I know it all now. God\r\npunishes me because I have bowed to thy king, and sought alliance with\r\nthy craven blood, alien as thou art!'\r\n\r\nThe window panes rattle as the wild cry echoes from the old man's\r\nquivering lips; all present tremble at the voice of his despair. He\r\nseizes his sword with both his hands, and while it trembles in his\r\ngrasp, continues:\r\n\r\n'Art thou still silent? My fathers were the enemies of thine; had I a\r\nson, he would have been thy deadly foe. I had an only daughter--I gave\r\nher to thee--she too is gone--take all--there is no one to care for\r\nnow--the inheritance is also thine.'\r\n\r\nThe sword rattles in his hands, the blade falls from his grasp, as he\r\nstrikes it against the pillar near him. The bridegroom starts forward\r\nand endeavors to stay the old man. The old man pushes him off, they\r\nwrestle in their bewilderment, and struggle like wild beasts. Despair\r\nnerves the aged arms with iron strength. Young and agile as he is, the\r\nbridegroom feels the hands of his adversary pressing heavily upon his\r\nshoulders, he bends under the weight, the old man hurls him to the\r\nground, and, no longer requiring aid from others, strides over the\r\nprostrate body. He stalks on with flashing, burning eyes, his gigantic\r\nshadow striding with him on the wall, his wide robes floating on the\r\nwind, his white hair streaming, his form winged with the courage of\r\ndespair. The retainers follow, the vaulted ceilings echoing back the\r\nsharp gride of their footsteps. Only one lighted saloon now lies between\r\nthem and the chamber of the ladies of the castle. The double door at the\r\nother end is thrown wide open, the walls and windows of the wedding\r\nchamber are crimsoning with the early hues of day, silence and solitude\r\npervade them, nothing falls upon the air save the twitter of the birds\r\nand the murmur of the fountains. The old man rushes on directly to the\r\nopen door and toward the reddening east.\r\n\r\nHe reaches the threshold, and the immense red face of the just risen sun\r\ndazzles his eyes. Is it the bloody Heart of God he sees pulsating\r\nthrough the universe? Blinded for a moment, he staggers on at random,\r\nwhen suddenly he sees the floor is red with blood. The dreadful phantoms\r\nof the night are again around him, no longer floating in misty visions,\r\nbut glaring fixed before him in the stern light of dread reality. In the\r\nfierce blaze of its pitiless rays, he sees the dead body of his\r\nbrother's son; the bloody form of his only child, his good daughter,\r\nlies pale at his feet. Like a drowning man he gasps for breath, beats\r\nthe air wildly around him, as if trying to rescue himself from this hell\r\nof spectres. Then he stands motionless, as if transfixed to the spot.\r\nAwakened by the noise and rumor, guests, feudal retainers, servants, and\r\nattendants rush to the spot, each in turn to be terror-stricken at the\r\nthreshold, to move within awed and silent. All eyes wander from the old\r\nlord of the castle to the stiffening corpses at his feet. They lie\r\ntogether now! The left arm of the exile is round the neck of his sister;\r\nher head rests on his armed bosom just above the spot where the sword\r\nstill remains plunged in his breast; his right hand has fallen beside\r\nit. There was no one near to close their dying eyelids, the pupils\r\nglitter glassily in the whitening light of the ascending sun, and the\r\nblood which is everywhere around, on the bridal bed, on the coat of mail\r\nof the young chieftain, on the white robes and snowy bosom of the bride,\r\nalready congeals into dark pools or crimson corals. Above this cooling\r\nstream their features rest in marble peace--a faint smile is on the lips\r\nof the young bride--while a passing thought of warlike glory still beams\r\nfrom the broad, pallid brow of the young hero. So tranquil their repose,\r\nthe agonies of death must have seemed light to them, lost in the\r\necstasies of faithful spirits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old man continues to stand as he first stood--no groan escapes his\r\nlips, no shuddering shakes his frame. The new comers press those already\r\npresent forward, but all breaths are hushed, hands are fixed steadily on\r\nsword hilts that they may not rattle, all sound is stilled--they stand\r\nin awe of that dreadful moment when their lord shall awake from his\r\ntorpor, and turn to them his face of woe. How will they bear the anguish\r\nwritten there? despair without a ray of hope!\r\n\r\nO God! what a miracle! He turns toward them, greets them imperiously but\r\ncourteously, as was his wont, as if, absorbed in thought and doubtful of\r\nthe dire reality before him, he was trying to ascertain its truth. Fever\r\nburns in his eye and flames upon his wrinkled cheek.\r\n\r\n'Hungarian wine!' he cries.' I will drink to the health of my fellow\r\ncitizens.'\r\n\r\nNo one moves, the bystanders seem turning to stone.\r\n\r\n'Haste! This blood must be washed away before my daughter returns to her\r\nchamber. Haste, I say!'\r\n\r\nNone move, all eyes are cast down; they cannot bear the strange light in\r\nhis wandering glances.\r\n\r\n'Ah! do you not know we are all dreaming? My sleep is torpid, stubborn,\r\naccursed, but the dawn is here, and I must soon awake!'\r\n\r\nSo saying he moves out upon the gallery, where suddenly a new thought\r\nappears to strike him; he leans over the marble balustrade, looks to the\r\nright and left, then exclaims:\r\n\r\n'Guests, we will go out to seek the young betrothed; it is strange they\r\nshould have gone out to walk so early!'\r\n\r\nHe descends the vaulted stairway by which his nephew had ascended but a\r\nshort time before. He stoops at the foot of the hill, picks some roses,\r\nmurmuring:\r\n\r\n'For my good child. Move silently, friends, she loved this bower of\r\njessamines; we will surprise her here, and be the first to say good\r\nmorning to the bride.'\r\n\r\nWith drooping heads his guests follow his steps as he glides along under\r\nthe sad firs and stately pines. Pathways stretch before them, leading\r\ninto forest depths and over mossy banks, or climbing hillsides laden\r\nwith vines. The old man often calls his daughter loudly by her name; the\r\nlaughing echoes answer mockingly; the followers burst into tears.\r\nStriking his forehead suddenly and violently with his hands, he cries:\r\n\r\n'The dream! the nightmare! Why should it look to me so like truth? When\r\nwill the _true_ sun rise upon me?' Then he rushes to a sturdy pine,\r\nembraces its rough trunk with both his arms, strikes his head against\r\nit: 'Awake me, thou hard bark--awake me from this dreadful dream!'\r\nTurning back, he seizes one of the nearest of his followers by the\r\nthroat, crying: 'Wrestle with thy lord, thou phantom of a servant, and\r\nwake him from his dream accursed!'\r\n\r\nThe frightened servant slips away and flees. The old man sighs, raises\r\nhis eyes to heaven, an expression of submission to a divinely appointed\r\ntorment shines for a moment upon his quivering features, as if he humbly\r\noffered to God the tortures of this cruel dream in penance for his sins.\r\nHe walks on calmly for a while, then says:\r\n\r\n'The bride is certainly on the lake; we will find her there.'\r\n\r\nThe sun is fully up now, drinking the dews from the leaves, and lighting\r\nup the waves of the lake with splendor. Large beaked boats with heraldic\r\nbanners are rocking in the coves. Fastening the roses he had gathered\r\nfor his child in his bosom, he walks to the shore, with fever burning\r\nmore and more vividly in his face. No one ventures to suggest a return\r\nto the castle. Accustomed to obey the unbending will of their lord, they\r\nstill pay homage to it, though it is no longer a thing of this world.\r\nDark as midnight seems the day dawn to them; their own brains seem\r\nseething into madness.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps she sails in one of her own light boats round the lake with her\r\nhusband; she may be behind the fringe of willows, or among the little\r\nislands. Hallo! six of you take the oars; we will soon find her.'\r\n\r\nThey obey, he seats himself within, they push from shore.\r\n\r\n'Why do you breathe so hard and look so weary to-day; is the water\r\nheavier than of old?'\r\n\r\nThey answer not, but row more rapidly. The larger boats are filled with\r\nguests and retainers; many follow the old lord, many remain on shore\r\nfrom lack of room. One after another the islets fly behind and hide\r\nthemselves from view, with their circling wreaths of reeds and sedges.\r\nRocks and bowlders are scattered over many of them, once sacrificial\r\naltars of old and cruel gods, now draped with hanging weeds and trailing\r\nmosses. Flocks of wild birds are startled up as the boats draw near\r\nthem, frightened by the noise and plashing of the oars. Black clouds of\r\nthem hang over the boat of the old man at every turn among the labyrinth\r\nof islands. He claps his hands:\r\n\r\n'Here! we will surely find her here!' And when nothing is there to be\r\nseen, he asks the winds: 'Where is my child--my good and beautiful\r\nchild?'\r\n\r\nHaving sailed round and round the whole group of islands, he orders them\r\nto row out into the middle of the lake, and then make for the other\r\nshore. He sinks into silence now; he leaves the helm, throwing himself\r\nsuddenly down into the boat, while a ghastly pallor settles on his\r\nvenerable face. He stretches his hand into the water, dives into it with\r\nhis arm, listens to the rippling of the waves, then bursts into a loud\r\nscream of wild laughter. The oarsmen stop, in hopes he will order the\r\nboat to return to shore. He does not speak, but rises up and looks,\r\nfirst back at the boats following after, then at the mountains, the\r\nplains, the forests, the gardens, the ancestral castle. Constantly\r\nstriking his palms together or rubbing his head with his hand, he\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n'Who will waken me? I dream! I dream! I must, I will awake!'\r\n\r\nThe oarsmen shudder. Then, collecting his whole remaining force, he\r\nflings himself violently into the depths. Three of the men instantly\r\nplunge in after him; those in the boats hasten to the rescue. Having\r\nseen what had happened, they gaze upon the spot where the whirling,\r\nwhistling waves were closing over the old lord and his faithful\r\nservants. The bold divers reappear, bearing in their arms the castle's\r\nlord. Under the heraldic banner they lay the last heir of the haughty\r\nHouse. In vain they try to resuscitate the venerable form; the dream is\r\nover now, but the mortal life remains under the blue waves of the\r\nancestral lake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foreign prince inherits the ancient castle with all its treasures,\r\nthe glories of the honored name, the entire Past of a noble race. He\r\nburies the bodies of his virgin wife and haughty father-in-law with\r\nfunereal pomp and honor; but orders the corpse of the exile to be\r\nroughly thrown into unhallowed ground. In the very hall in which he had\r\nspent the first night of his bridal, surrounded by gay revellers,\r\npledging full cups of ruby wine, with light jests flying from reckless\r\nlip to lip--he spreads, with the same comrades, the solemn Feast of the\r\nDead. When the next dawn breaks upon them, mounting their vigorous\r\nsteeds, they all ride back to the court of the King of the South. The\r\nking rejoices in his heart, giving thanks to the Fates that his leal\r\nsubject has inherited vast wealth, and that the alien family, powerful\r\nthrough so many centuries, is extinct forever.\r\n\r\nIn the clefts of the mountains they remember and honor the young\r\nchieftain, whose body had been thrown into unhallowed ground. They know\r\nthat his dishonored grave lies on that side of the castle through which\r\nwill pass their path to victory; and they will plant the cross of\r\nglorious memories upon it as they march to the assault to drive the\r\nforeigner from the Home of his loyal ancestors. Eagles and vultures, led\r\nby some mystic instinct, are often seen to fly from the mountains to the\r\ntowers and turrets of the castle. It is certain that in some not distant\r\nday the comrades of the chieftain will pour with resistless strength\r\ninto its doomed walls.... Let another chant to you the Hymn of victory;\r\nI have sung the Dirge of agony!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnhappy maiden! thou vanishest like a thought which cannot shape itself\r\nin any language known on earth, a dream of early love! Thou wouldst not\r\nlose thy snowy wings, and they bear thee on the whirlwind's track, where\r\nthe mists fly, the clouds sail, the sound of harps dies, the leaves of\r\nautumn drift, the breath of sighs vanishes! Martyr to thine own dream of\r\nplighted faith, they bury thy fair form in ancestral earth; perchance\r\nthe sculptured marble presses on thy faultless brow, for on its snow\r\nthey grave the hated foreign name borne by thy alien husband! But the\r\ngrass and wild flowers will soon grow unheeded around it, and in the\r\ngreen and flourishing world of the ever vanishing, thy name is never\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nOn the very morning of thy death, the seven old men to whom obedience\r\nwas commanded by the chieftain, curse thee because thou borest away with\r\nthee the soul of their hero. In their addresses to the people, with\r\nscorn and scoff upon their lips, they sneer and call thee 'WOMAN;' but\r\nthe people weep, and pray: Lord Christ, Son of the Virgin, give to the\r\nmaiden ETERNAL PEACE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH PRESS.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the tone of the newspapers had of late years greatly\r\nimproved. Men of eminence and great intellectual attainments were to be\r\nfound among the contributors to the various journals, and what is much\r\nmore important--for this was pre-eminently the age of bribery and\r\ncorruption--men of honesty and integrity. Still there was a large class\r\nof venal hirelings in the pay of the Government. These were described by\r\nMr. Pulteney as 'a herd of wretches whom neither information can\r\nenlighten nor affluence elevate.' He further expresses his conviction\r\nthat 'if their patrons would read their writings, their salaries would\r\nbe quickly withdrawn, for a few pages would convince them that they can\r\nneither attack nor defend, neither raise any man's reputation by their\r\npanegyrics, nor destroy it by their defamation.' Sir Robert Walpole,\r\nwho, as has been already stated, expended enormous sums in bribes to\r\npublic writers, however expedient he may have thought it to retain their\r\nservices, does not appear to have attached much importance personally to\r\nthe writers either for or against him, at least if we may put faith in\r\nhis own words. On one occasion he said: 'I have never discovered any\r\nreason to exalt the authors who write against the Administration to a\r\nhigher degree of reputation than their opponents;' and on another, 'Nor\r\ndo I often read the papers of either party, except when I am informed by\r\nsome, who have more inclination to such studies than myself, that they\r\nhave risen by some accident above their common level.'\r\n\r\nAmong the first rank of newspaper writers at this period must be placed\r\nthe undying name of Henry Fielding, whose connection with journalism\r\noriginated in his becoming, in 1739, editor and part owner of the\r\n_Champion_, a tri-weekly periodical of the _Spectator_ stamp, with a\r\ncompendium of the chief news of the day in addition. The rebellion of\r\n1745, like every other topic of absorbing interest, became the parent of\r\na great many news sheets, the chief of which was probably the _National\r\nJournal, or County Gazette_, inasmuch as it called forth a Government\r\nprosecution, and procured six months' imprisonment for its printer. In\r\nopposition to the Jacobite journals, several newspapers were started in\r\nthe interest of the Government. Fielding brought out the _True Patriot_,\r\nin 1745, and proved no mean antagonist for the sympathizers with the\r\nbanished Stuarts. In the prospectus issued with his first number, he has\r\nsome rather unpleasant things to say of his literary brethren:\r\n\r\n'The first little imperfection in these writings is that there is scarce\r\na syllable of truth in any of them. If this be admitted to be a fault,\r\nit requires no other evidence than themselves and the perpetual\r\ncontradictions which occur, not only on comparing one with the other,\r\nbut the same author with himself on different days. Secondly, there is\r\nno sense in them. To prove this likewise, I appeal to their works.\r\nThirdly, there is in reality nothing in them at all. And this also must\r\nbe allowed by their readers, if paragraphs, which contain neither wit,\r\nnor humor, nor sense, nor the least importance, may be properly said to\r\ncontain nothing.... Nor will this appear strange if we consider who are\r\nthe authors of such tracts--namely, the journeymen of booksellers, of\r\nwhom, I believe, much the same may be truly predicated as of these\r\ntheir productions. But the encouragement with which these lucubrations\r\nare read may seem most strange and more difficult to be accounted for.\r\nAnd here I cannot agree with my bookseller that their eminent badness\r\nrecommends them. The true reason is, I believe, the same which I once\r\nheard an economist assign for the content and satisfaction with which\r\nhis family drank water-cider--viz., because they could procure no better\r\nliquor. Indeed, I make no doubt but that the understanding as well as\r\nthe palate, though it may out of necessity swallow the worse, will, in\r\ngeneral, prefer the better.'\r\n\r\nThese sarcasms are probably not much overcolored, for, with one or two\r\nexceptions, newspapers had sunk to a very low state indeed, and this may\r\nbe looked upon as one of the most degraded periods in the history of\r\njournalism with which we have had to deal, or shall hereafter have to\r\nencounter. The _Champion_, of course, was intended to be 'the better.'\r\nIt did not, however, meet with any very great success, but still with\r\nenough to encourage Fielding in his attacks. In 1747 he dealt another\r\nheavy blow at the Jacobites, by commencing the _Jacobite Journal_, in\r\nwhich they were most mercilessly ridiculed and satirized. His opponents\r\nreplied as best they could, but they were not masters of the keen and\r\npolished weapons which the great novelist wielded, and they were\r\ntherefore obliged to content themselves with venomous spite and abuse.\r\nThe ablest of these antagonists was a newspaper entitled _Old England,\r\nor the Constitutional Journal_, an infamous and scurrilous publication,\r\nto which, however, the elegant Lord Chesterfield did not think it\r\nderogatory to contribute. Among other celebrities who were associated\r\nwith the press at this time, we find Lord Lyttelton, Bonnell\r\nThornton--the author of the _Connoisseur_, an essay paper, which, though\r\ninferior to the _Spectator_ and _Tatler_, may be read with great\r\npleasure and profit, even at the present time--the famous Beckford,\r\nEdward Moore, and Arthur Murphy. This last started the _Test_, a journal\r\ndevoted to the demolition of Pitt, but which called forth an opponent of\r\nno mean pretensions, under the name of the _Con-Test_, for then, as now,\r\nas it always has been, and always will be, a good and taking title\r\nproduced a host of imitations and piracies. In spite, however, of\r\nMurphy's great talents and its first blush of success, the _Test_ soon\r\nbegan to languish, and died of atrophy, after a brief existence of some\r\neight or nine months. One of the most formidable anti-ministerialist\r\npapers which, had hitherto appeared, was the _Monitor_. It came out upon\r\nthe accession of George III., and was especially occupied in attacking\r\nLord Bute, the young monarch's chief minister and favorite. Its editor\r\nwas John Entick, who is best known as the author of a dictionary, which\r\nwas largely used in the schooldays of the last generation, and is still\r\noccasionally to be met with in old-fashioned families and out-of-the-way\r\ncorners of the world. This _Monitor_ was as terrible to the marquis as\r\nanother more modern Monitor was to the Merrimac, and the Scotch minion\r\nwas compelled to bestir himself. He called in to his aid Bubb\r\nDoddington, who, during the lifetime of the preceding king, had done\r\ngood service for the party of the Prince of Wales, in a journal styled\r\nthe _Remembrancer_, and they, in conjunction with Smollett as editor,\r\nbrought out the _Briton_ in 1762. It was but a weakly specimen of a\r\nBriton from the very first. There were many causes which contributed to\r\nits downfall. Scotchmen were regarded throughout the nation with\r\nfeelings of thorough detestation, and Smollett had made for himself many\r\nbitter enemies, of men who had formerly been his friends, by his\r\nacceptance of this employment. It was the hand of a quondam friend that\r\ndealt his paper the _coup-de-grace_, none other in fact than John\r\nWilkes, who had started the _North Briton_ in opposition to Smollett.\r\nThe _Briton_ expired on the 12th of February, 1763, and upon the 23d of\r\nApril, in the same year, appeared the never-to-be-forgotten No. 45 of\r\nthe _North Briton_. The circumstances connected with this famous\r\n_brochure_, and the consequences which followed upon its appearance, are\r\nso well known, that it will not be necessary to proceed to any great\r\nlength in describing its incidents. This said No. 45 initiated a great\r\nfight, in which both sides committed several mistakes, won several\r\nvictories, and sustained several defeats. Wilkes undoubtedly got the\r\nworst of it at first, but his discomfiture was set off by many\r\ncompensations in different ways, which his long struggle procured for\r\nhim. The obnoxious article, boldly assuming the responsibility of\r\nministers for the king's speech--for Wilkes always asserted that he had\r\nthe highest respect for the king himself--practically charged them with\r\nfalsehood. Upon this they issued a general warrant for the apprehension\r\nof all the authors, printers, and publishers of the _North Briton_.\r\nWilkes was seized and thrown into the Tower, where he was kept for four\r\ndays, all access of friends and legal advisers being denied to him. At\r\nthe end of that period he was brought before the Court of Common Pleas\r\nupon a writ of _habeas corpus_. Three points were raised in his favor,\r\nnamely, whether the warrant was legal, whether the particular passage in\r\nthe libel complained of ought not to have been specified, and whether\r\nhis privileges as a member of Parliament did not protect him from\r\narrest. The celebrated Lord Camden, then Chief Justice Pratt, presided,\r\nand ruled against Wilkes on the first two points, but discharged him\r\nfrom custody on the third. Wilkes hereupon reprinted the article. Both\r\nHouses of Parliament now took up the cudgels in behalf of the\r\nGovernment, and resolved that privilege of Parliament did not extend to\r\narrest for libel. The House of Commons also resolved 'that the _North\r\nBriton_, No. 45, is a false, scandalous, and seditious libel, containing\r\nexpressions of the most unexampled insolence and contumely toward his\r\nMajesty, the grossest expressions against both Houses of Parliament, and\r\nthe most audacious defiance of the authority of the whole legislature,\r\nand most manifestly tending to alienate the affections of the people\r\nfrom his Majesty, to withdraw them from their obedience to the laws of\r\nthe realm, and to excite them to traitorous insurrection against his\r\nMajesty's Government.' They also ordered the libel to be publicly burned\r\nby the common hangman, in front of the Royal Exchange. The authorities\r\nattempted to carry out this order, but an enormous mob assembled, drove\r\noff the officers, rescued the journal from the flames, and, in revenge,\r\nbuilt a huge bonfire at Temple Bar, into which they threw the jackboot,\r\nthe favorite emblem for expressing the public dislike of Lord Bute. It\r\nwas now Wilkes's turn, and he brought an action in the following year\r\nagainst the under secretary of state, for the illegal seizure of his\r\npapers. Judge Pratt summed up in his favor, directing the jury that\r\ngeneral warrants were 'unconstitutional, illegal, and altogether void.'\r\nAs being the instrument in eliciting this memorable exposition of the\r\nlaws, Wilkes deserves the gratitude of every Englishman who cares one\r\njot for his constitutional rights, and of every lover of freedom\r\nthroughout the world. He was not without immediate and substantial\r\nrewards, for the jury found a verdict for him, with L1,000 damages. The\r\ncorporation of the city of London, who had taken his part throughout,\r\neventually chose him sheriff, lord mayor, and chamberlain, and presented\r\nthe lord chief justice with the freedom of the city, in token of their\r\nadmiration for his conduct. On the other hand, Wilkes was expelled the\r\nHouse of Commons, on account of the libel, and on the very same day\r\nwhich witnessed his triumph in the Court of Common Pleas, he was tried\r\nin the Court of the King's Bench, for its republication, and found\r\nguilty. He refused to surrender to judgment, and was accordingly\r\noutlawed. He then proceeded to the Continent, from whence, some three or\r\nfour years later, he addressed a petition to the king for a pardon. As\r\nno notice was taken of this, he returned to England, and paid a fine of\r\nL500, his outlawry being reversed. He next petitioned the House of\r\nCommons for readmission; but his petition was rejected, and a new writ\r\nissued, when he was returned by an overwhelming majority. The House\r\nexpelled him again, and this farce of expulsion and reelection was\r\nenacted four distinct times, until at last his election was declared\r\nnull and void. He subsequently brought an action against Lord Halifax\r\nfor illegal imprisonment and the seizure of his papers, and obtained\r\nL4,000 damages. He lived several years after this, but took no prominent\r\npart in political affairs, confining his energies to the sphere of the\r\ncity. While he was in exile at Paris he published an account of his\r\ntrial, etc., but, as he was unfortunate in his defenders, so was he in\r\nhis adversaries. The writings of his friend and coadjutor, Charles\r\nChurchill, the clever writer, but disreputable divine, are wellnigh, if\r\nnot entirely, forgotten, but the undying pencil of the immortal Hogarth\r\nwill forever hold him up to the gaze of remote posterity. Whatever may\r\nbe the feeling as to his political opinions, and however great may be\r\nour gratitude to him in one particular instance, his authorship of the\r\nabominable and filthy 'Essay upon Women'--which, by the way, formed one\r\ncount in the indictment against him at his trial in the King's\r\nBench--will always earn for him the execration of mankind. The success\r\nof Wilkes in his action against the secretary of state, was the signal\r\nfor a host of other authors, printers, and publishers, who had been\r\nsimilarly attacked, to bring similar actions. They generally obtained\r\nheavy damages, and ministers learned a lesson of caution which they did\r\nnot soon forget.\r\n\r\nBut while they persecuted the opposition scribes, ministers did not\r\nforget to reward those writers who advocated the cause of the\r\nGovernment. Men who had failed in all kinds of professions and\r\nemployments, turned their attention to political literature, and, as far\r\nas emolument was concerned, met with great success, for although the\r\ntalent was all on one side, the profit was all on the other. Among the\r\nchief of these fortunate scribblers was Dr. Francis, the father of the\r\ncelebrated Sir Philip, Dr. Shebbrart, Hugh Kelly, and Arthur Murphy.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at another most memorable period in newspaper history--the\r\nappearance of the Letters of Junius. The interest in the discovery of\r\nthe source of these withering diatribes has been almost as great as in\r\nthat of the Nile, but, unlike that 'frightened and fugitive' river,\r\ntheir origin will probably never be discovered with any certainty. A\r\nneat little library might be formed of the books and pamphlets that have\r\nbeen written upon this 'vexed question,' and the name of every man that\r\nwas at all eminent at the time of their publication--and of a great many\r\ntoo that were by no means eminent--has been at some time or other\r\nsuggested as the author. This controversy may be looked upon as a sort\r\nof literary volcano, which every now and then becoming suddenly active,\r\nafter a period of quiescence of longer or shorter duration, sends forth\r\ngreat clouds of smoke--but nothing else; and then all things remain once\r\nmore in _statu quo_. Our space will not permit us to make any remark\r\nupon the matter, further than to express an opinion that the\r\npreponderance of evidence appears to be in favor of Sir Philip\r\nFrancis--the untiring, unscrupulous bloodhound who hunted down Warren\r\nHastings--having been the author. The first of these famous letters\r\nappeared in the _Public Advertiser_, of April 28, 1767; the last of a\r\nstalwart family of sixty-nine, on January 21, 1772. Let Burke testify to\r\ntheir tremendous power. To the House of Commons he said: 'He made you\r\nhis quarry, and you still bleed from the wounds of his talons. You\r\ncrouched, and still crouch beneath his rage.' To the speaker he said:\r\n'Nor has he dreaded the terrors of your brow, sir; he has attacked even\r\nyou--he has--and I believe you have no reason to triumph in the\r\nencounter.' And again: 'Kings, lords, and commons are but the sport of\r\nhis fury.' Speaking of the 'Letter to the king,' Burke said: 'It was the\r\nrancor and venom with which I was struck. In these respects the _North\r\nBriton_ is as much inferior to him as in strength, wit, and judgment.'\r\nThe Government tried every means in their power to discover the author,\r\nbut in vain. Woodfall, the proprietor of the _Public Advertiser_, knew\r\nor professed to know nothing about it, asserting that the letters were\r\nfound in his box from time to time, but how they came there he could not\r\ntell. Let it suffice us to know that they admirably served the purpose\r\nfor which they were written, viz., to defeat tyranny, and to defend\r\nfreedom; that they are still allowed to rank as the greatest political\r\nessays that were ever written; and that Junius, whoever he was, will\r\nalways be gratefully remembered among us, so long as we continue to\r\ndisplay that watchful jealousy in the preservation of our liberties\r\nwhich has hitherto ever characterized us as a nation.\r\n\r\nThe Government prosecuted several newspaper proprietors and printers for\r\npublishing these letters, and more especially that addressed to the\r\nking. Among others who were brought to trial were Woodfall himself; John\r\nAlmon, of the _London Museum_; Miller, of the _London Evening Post_;\r\nBaldwin, of the _St. James's Chronicle_; Say, of the _Gazetteer_, and\r\nRobinson, of the _Independent Chronicle_. Almon was, however, the only\r\none who was punished. The jury consisted of Government employes,\r\ncarefully selected, and of course brought in a verdict adverse to him.\r\nAlmon was fined and ordered to find substantial bail for his future good\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThe _Public Advertiser_ was a joint-stock concern, chiefly in the hands\r\nof the booksellers, among whom we find names which are still famous in\r\nPaternoster Row, such as Longman, Cadell, Rivington, and Strahan.\r\nWoodfall's ledger supplies us with the following information as to the\r\nexpenses of getting it up, some of the items being sufficiently curious:\r\n\r\n                                            L  s. d.\r\n\r\nPaid translating foreign news, etc.,       100  0  0\r\nForeign newspapers,                         14  0  0\r\nFoy, at 2s. a day,                          31  4  0\r\nLloyd's coffee house for post news          12  0  0\r\nHome news, as per receipts and incidents,  282  4 11-1/2\r\nList of sheriffs,                              10  6\r\nPlantation, Irish, and Scotch news,         50  0  0\r\nPortsmouth letter,                           8  5  0\r\nStocks,                                      3  3  0\r\nPorterage to the stamp office,              10  8  0\r\nRecorder's clerk,                            1  1  0\r\nSir John Fielding,                          50  0  0\r\nDelivering papers fifty-two weeks,\r\n  at L1 4s. per week,                       62  8  0\r\nClerk, and to collect debts,                30  0  0\r\nSetting up extra advertisements,            31 10  0\r\nA person to go daily to fetch\r\n  in advertisements, getting\r\n  evening papers, etc.,                     15 15  0\r\nMorning and evening papers,                 26  8  9-1/2\r\nPrice of hay and straw, Whitechapel,         1  6  0\r\nMr. Green for port entries,                 31 10  0\r\nLaw charges, Mr. Holloway,                   6  7  5\r\nBad debts,                                  18  3  6\r\n                                          ----------\r\n                                          L796 15  2\r\n\r\nThe sale was about three thousand a day, and the shareholders received\r\nL80 per share clear profit. The newspapers of those days paid the\r\nmanagers of theatres for accounts of their plays, as witness the\r\nfollowing entries:\r\n\r\n                            L  s. d.\r\n\r\nPlayhouses,                100  0  0\r\nDrury Lane advertisements,  64  8  6\r\nCovent Garden               66 11  0\r\n                           ---------\r\n                          L230 19  6\r\n\r\nTheatrical advertising had not reached the pitch of development which it\r\nhas since attained; the competition was not so severe, and managers did\r\nnot find it necessary to have recourse to ingenious methods of\r\npropitiating dramatic critics, such as producing their plays at the\r\ncommencement of a new season, or paying L300 a year for the supervision\r\nof the playbills--expedients which have been now and then employed in\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers in the _Public Advertiser_ were Caleb Whitefoord,\r\n_dilettante_ and wine merchant, Charles d'Este, who, like the popular\r\nLondon preacher of the present day, Bellew, first tried the stage, but\r\nnot succeeding in that line, entered the pulpit; John Taylor, afterward\r\neditor of the _Morning Post_; Tom Syers, author of the 'Dialogues of the\r\nDead,' and Woodfall's brother William. This last started the _Morning\r\nChronicle_, in 1769, a paper whose fate it was, after lasting nearly a\r\ncentury, to pass into the venal hands of Sergeant Glover (who sold it to\r\nLouis Napoleon, in order that it might become _sub rosa_ a French organ\r\nin London), and to die in consequence in well-merited dishonor.\r\n\r\nThe _Public Ledger_ was brought out by Newberry, the bookseller, in\r\n1760, and is chiefly remarkable as being the vehicle through which\r\nGoldsmith's 'Citizen of the World' was first given to the public.\r\n\r\n'Poet Goldsmith, for shortness called 'Noll,'\r\nWho wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll,'\r\n\r\nreceived two guineas for his first article, and afterward became a\r\nregular contributor at a guinea an article. William Radcliffe, the\r\nhusband of the authoress of 'The Mysteries of Udolfo,' edited the\r\n_Englishman_, a paper to which Edmund Burke contributed, and\r\nsubsequently the _English Chronicle_ and the _Morning Herald_. Of all\r\nthese he was proprietor, either altogether or in part, and it seems to\r\nhave been customary for the editor to be the proprietor, or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, for the proprietor to be the editor.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutions in connection with the letters of Junius were not the\r\nonly attacks made upon the press at this time. Parliament again entered\r\nthe lists against it. There was a certain Lord Marchmont, whose especial\r\nmission appears to have been to persecute the newspapers. Shakspeare\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n'The evil that men do lives after them,\r\nThe good is oft interred with their bones;'\r\n\r\nand whether or no my Lord Marchmont ever did any good cannot now be\r\nascertained. All that is known of him is that he was very pertinacious\r\nand very successful in his onslaughts upon his victims, for, whenever he\r\nsaw the name of any member of the House of Peers in a journal, he used\r\nto make a motion against the printer for breach of privilege, summon him\r\nbefore the bar of the House, and have him heavily fined. The House of\r\nCommons followed suit. The old bone of contention, the reporting of the\r\ndebates, was raked up again. There were then two giants of reporting,\r\nWilliam Woodfall, who, from his wonderful retentive powers, was called\r\nby the _sobriquet_ of Memory Woodfall, and William Radcliffe. It was in\r\n1771 that the House proceeded to active measures by a majority of ninety\r\nvotes to fifty-five. Orders were given to arrest the printers,\r\npublishers, and authors of the _Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser_ and\r\nthe _Middlesex Journal, or Chronicle of Liberty_. The printers went into\r\nhiding, and a reward of L50 was offered for their apprehension. Shortly\r\nafterward, this raid was extended to the printers of the _Morning\r\nChronicle_, _St. James's Chronicle_, _General Post_, _London Evening\r\nPost_, _Whitehall Evening Post_, and _London Packet_. Some of these\r\nappeared at the bar of the House, and actually _made their submission on\r\ntheir knees_. Miller, of the _London Evening Post_, declined to\r\nsurrender, and was, after some difficulty, arrested under a warrant from\r\nthe speaker. He was taken before the lord mayor, who was a member of the\r\nHouse of Commons. The city's chief magistrate--let his name, Brass\r\nCrosby, be remembered with honor--declared the warrant illegal,\r\ndischarged Miller, and committed the speaker's messenger for assault.\r\nThe same thing was done in the case of Wheble, of the _Middlesex\r\nJournal_, who was taken before John Wilkes, then sitting as alderman at\r\nGuildhall; and in that of Thompson, of the _Gazetteer_, who was taken\r\nbefore Alderman Oliver. The ground for their discharge was that the\r\nspeaker's warrant had no force within the boundaries of the city,\r\nwithout being countersigned by a magistrate of the corporation. The\r\nHouse of Commons became furious, and ordered the attendance of Crosby\r\nand Oliver, but, taught by old experience, did not in the first instance\r\nthink it desirable to meddle with Wilkes. The civic magistrates stood\r\ntheir ground manfully, and produced their charters. The House retorted\r\nby looking up the resolutions passed on various occasions against the\r\npublication of the debates. Meanwhile a mob assembled outside, and\r\nabused and hustled the members on their way to the House. After a fierce\r\ndebate, Oliver was committed to the Tower. The attendance of Wilkes was\r\nthen ordered for the 8th of April, but, in the mean time, the House,\r\nlike Fear as represented by Collins in his Ode to the Passions,\r\n\r\n            'back recoiled...\r\nEven at the sound himself had made;'\r\n\r\nand accordingly got out of the difficulty by adjourning over the day for\r\nwhich the redoubtable Wilkes had been summoned. On the 27th of April,\r\nhowever, the lord mayor was sent to the Tower. The whole country rang\r\nwith indignation; but, nevertheless, the city magistrates remained\r\nincarcerated until the 23d of July, when the Parliament was prorogued,\r\nand, its power of imprisonment being at an end, they were set free. Such\r\nwas the issue of the last battle between the Parliament and the press,\r\non the question of publishing the debates. It was fought in 1771, and\r\nhad been a tougher conflict than any of its predecessors, but it was\r\ndecisive. There is no danger of the subject being reopened; the\r\nreporting of the debates is now one of the most important of the\r\nfunctions of our newspapers; and the members themselves are too sensible\r\nof the services rendered them by the reporters' gallery to be suicidal\r\nenough to inaugurate a new crusade against it. What those services are,\r\nany one who has been patriotic or curious enough to sit out a debate in\r\nthe strangers' gallery over night, and then to read the speeches, to\r\nwhich he has listened, in the newspapers next morning, can readily\r\nappreciate. Hazy ideas have become clear, mutilated and unintelligible\r\nsentences have been neatly and properly arranged, needless repetitions\r\nand tautological verbiage have disappeared; there is no sign of\r\nhesitation; hums and haws, and other inexpressible ejaculations, grunts,\r\nand interpolations find no place; the thread of an argument is shown\r\nwhere none was visible before, and all is fluent, concise, and more or\r\nless to the point.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tone of the press had again greatly improved, partly owing\r\nto purification through the trials which it had undergone, and partly\r\nowing to the better taste of the public. Its circulation had rapidly\r\nincreased. In 1753 the number of stamps on newspapers in the United\r\nKingdom was 7,411,757; in 1760, 9,464,790; in 1774, 12,300,608; in 1775,\r\n12,680,906; and in 1776, 12,836,000, a halt in its progress being caused\r\nby Lord North's new stamp act, raising the stamp from one to one and a\r\nhalf pence. The ordinary price of a news sheet was two or two and a half\r\npence, but this was more than doubled by its cost of transmission\r\nthrough the post office, which, for a daily paper, was L5 a year. The\r\n_Morning Post_, the full title of which was originally the _Morning Post\r\nand Daily Advertiser_, first came out in 1772. In 1775 it appeared\r\nregularly every morning, under the editorship of the Rev. Henry Bate,\r\nafterward the Rev. Sir Henry Bate Dudley, Bart. The _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_--that prolific mine to whose stores of wealth the present\r\nseries of articles is beholden times out of number--gives a curious\r\naccount of a duel into which this clerical editor was forced in his\r\nclerical capacity. Editorial duels were not unknown in those days.\r\nWilkes had fought one or two, as well as other editors; but these were\r\nthe circumstances of Mr. Bate's encounter:\r\n\r\n'The cause of quarrel arose from some offensive paragraphs that had\r\nappeared in the _Morning Post_, highly reflecting on the character of a\r\nlady, for whom Captain Stoney had a particular regard. Mr. Bate had\r\ntaken every possible method, consistent with honor, to convince Captain\r\nStoney that the insertion of the paragraphs was wholly without his\r\nknowledge, to which Mr. Stoney gave no credit, and insisted on the\r\nsatisfaction of a gentleman, or the discovery of the author. This\r\nhappened some days before, but meeting, as it were by accident, on the\r\nday before mentioned (January 13, 1777), they adjourned to the Adelphi,\r\ncalled for a room, shut the door, and, being furnished with pistols,\r\ndischarged them at each other without effect. They then drew swords, and\r\nMr. Stoney received a wound in the breast and arm, and Mr. Bate one in\r\nthe thigh. Mr. Bate's sword bent and slanted against the captain's\r\nbreastbone, which Mr. Bate apprising him of, Captain Stoney called to\r\nhim to straighten it, and in the interim, while the sword was under his\r\nfoot for that purpose, the door was broken open, or the death of one of\r\nthe parties would most certainly have been the issue.'\r\n\r\nAnother eminent writer in the _Public Advertiser_ was John Horne,\r\nafterward John Horne Tooke, the author of the 'Diversions of Purley,' a\r\nman to be always remembered with gratitude in America, for the part\r\nwhich he took in the struggle between the colonies and the mother\r\ncountry. His connection with the press was one long series of trials for\r\nlibel, in which he always got the worst of the fray. In fact, he rather\r\nappeared to like being in hot water, for he more than once wrote an\r\narticle with the full intention of standing the trial which he knew\r\nwould be sure to follow its publication. One of his reasons may have\r\nbeen that this was the only way in which he could indulge his penchant\r\nfor forensic disputation. He had been bred a clergyman, but, disliking\r\nthe retirement of a quiet country parsonage, he threw up his preferment,\r\nabandoned his clerical functions altogether, and came to London to keep\r\nhis terms at the Temple. The benchers, however, holding the force of the\r\nmaxim, 'Once in orders always in orders,' refused to admit him to the\r\ndegree of barrister at law. In 1771 he founded the Society of the\r\nSupporters of the Bill of Rights, one of the objects of which was to\r\nuphold the newspapers in their conflicts with their great foe, the law\r\nof libel, and to defray the expenses which were thus incurred. But,\r\nowing to some quarrel with Wilkes, he withdrew from his connection with\r\nthis society, and started a new one--the Constitutional Society--which\r\nwas founded in the interests of the American colonies. His publication\r\nof the doings of this society procured for him the distinction of\r\nanother trial, the upshot of which was that he was fined L200,\r\nimprisoned for a year, and ordered to find bail for his good behavior\r\nfor three years more. After two unsuccessful attempts he got into\r\nParliament, and proved a very troublesome and formidable antagonist to\r\nministers, as might be expected from a prominent member of the London\r\nCorresponding Society, which, consisting chiefly of working men, had for\r\nits main objects the establishment of universal suffrage and annual\r\nParliaments. This society owed its origin to the French Revolution, and\r\nit kept up a regular correspondence with the National Convention and the\r\nFrench Jacobins. It numbered about fifty thousand members, in different\r\nparts of the kingdom, and disseminated its opinions by means of\r\nnewspapers, pamphlets, and handbills, which were published at a low\r\nprice, or given away in the streets. One of the most influential of\r\nthese pamphlets was Tom Paine's 'Rights of Man,' for writing which he\r\nwas tried and convicted. Erskine was his counsel, and in the course of\r\nhis speech said:\r\n\r\n'Other liberties are held under Governments, but the liberty of opinion\r\nkeeps Governments themselves in due subjection to their duties. This has\r\nproduced the martyrdom of truth in every age, and the world has been\r\nonly purged from ignorance with the innocent blood of those who have\r\nenlightened it.'\r\n\r\nThe effect of these writings was that Government became alarmed, and a\r\nproclamation was issued against seditious speaking and writing. The\r\n_habeas corpus_ act was suspended, and political trials became the order\r\nof the day. Horne Tooke's was one of the latest of these trials, in\r\n1794. Erskine was his counsel, and was more successful than when\r\ndefending Paine. The public excitement had by this time very much toned\r\ndown, and Tooke was acquitted. One result of this trial was to secure\r\nthe fortunes of Erskine; but another and much more important one was to\r\nestablish on a firmer basis the right of free discussion and liberty of\r\nspeech, and to check the ministry in the career of terrorism and\r\noppression upon which they had entered. Looking back upon these trials,\r\nat this distance of time, one cannot but feel a conviction that the\r\nfears of the Government and the nation were absurdly exaggerated. The\r\nfoundations of English society and British institutions were too firmly\r\nfixed to be easily shaken, even when the whole continent of Europe was\r\nconvulsed from one end to the other. But the London Corresponding\r\nSociety still continued its efforts, till its secretary was tried and\r\nconvicted, and the society itself was suppressed, along with many other\r\nsimilar associations, by an act of Parliament, called the Corresponding\r\nSocieties Bill, in 1799. Tooke's connection with it had ceased some time\r\nbefore; in fact, it is more than doubtful if he had ever been a\r\nthorough-going supporter of it in heart, or had any other object than\r\nthat of making political capital out of it, and of indulging his\r\nbelligerent proclivities. He died in 1812, at the age of seventy-six.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 there were seventeen regular newspapers published in London, of\r\nwhich seven were daily, eight tri-weekly, one bi-weekly, and one weekly.\r\nIn 1778 appeared the first Sunday newspaper, under the title of\r\n_Johnson's Sunday Monitor_.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the threshold of a very important event--too\r\nimportant, in fact, to be introduced at the end of an article, and which\r\nwe therefore reserve for our next number. That event is the birth of the\r\n_Times_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE IN THE LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Warm and bright the sun is shining\r\n    On the farmhouse far away,\r\n  Like a pleasant picture lying\r\n    Bright before my gaze all day.\r\n\r\n  And I see the tall, gray chimney,\r\n    And the steep roof sloping down;\r\n  And far off the spires rise dimly\r\n    Of the old New Hampshire town.\r\n\r\n  And the little footpath creeping\r\n    Through the long grass to the door,\r\n  And the hopvine's tresses sweeping\r\n    The low roof and lintels o'er.\r\n\r\n  And the barn with loft and rafter,\r\n    Weather beaten, scarred, and wide--\r\n  And the tree I used to clamber,\r\n    With the well-sweep on one side.\r\n\r\n  And beyond that wide old farmyard,\r\n    And the bridge across the stream,\r\n  I can see the ancient orchard,\r\n    Where the russets thickly gleam,\r\n\r\n  And the birds sing just as sweetly,\r\n    In the branches knarled and low,\r\n  As when autumns there serenely\r\n    Walked a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n  And upon the east are beaming\r\n    The salt meadows to the sea,\r\n  Or the hillside pastures, dreaming\r\n    Of October pleasantly.\r\n\r\n  On the west, like lanterns glimmer\r\n    Thick the ears of corn to-day,\r\n  That I sowed along each furrow,\r\n    Singing as I went, last May.\r\n\r\n  So it hangs, that vision tender,\r\n    Over all my loss and pain,\r\n  Where the maples flame their splendor\r\n    By the old house in the lane.\r\n\r\n  And, beside the warm south window,\r\n    At this very hour of day,\r\n  Where the sunbeams love to linger,\r\n    With her knitting dropped away,\r\n\r\n  She is sitting--mother--mother,\r\n    With your pale and patient face,\r\n  Where the frosted hairs forever\r\n    Shed their sad and tender grace.\r\n\r\n  Are you thinking of that morning\r\n    Your last kisses faltered down,\r\n  When the summer sun was dawning\r\n    O'er the old New Hampshire town?\r\n\r\n  For my country, in her anguish,\r\n    Came betwixt us mightily:\r\n  'Save me, or, my son, I perish!'\r\n    Was her dread appeal to me.\r\n\r\n  Youth and strength and life made answer:\r\n    When that cry of bitter stress\r\n  Woke the hills of old New Hampshire,\r\n    Could I give my country less?\r\n\r\n  And not when the battle's thunder,\r\n    Crashed along our ranks its power--\r\n  And not now, though fiercer hunger\r\n    Drains my life-springs at this hour--\r\n\r\n  Would I fainter make the answer,\r\n    Or the offering less complete,\r\n  That I laid, in old New Hampshire,\r\n    Joyful at my country's feet!\r\n\r\n  Though your boy has borne, dear mother,\r\n    Watching by that window low,\r\n  Through the long, slow hours this hunger\r\n    It would break your heart to know.\r\n\r\n  Though the thought of that old larder,\r\n    And the shelves o'erflowing there,\r\n  Made the pang of hunger harder\r\n    Through the day and night to bear.\r\n\r\n  And the doves have come each morning,\r\n    And the lowing kine been fed,\r\n  While your only boy was starving\r\n    For a single crust of bread!\r\n\r\n  But through all this need and sorrow\r\n    Has the end been drawing nigh:\r\n  In these prison walls, to-morrow,\r\n    It will not be hard to die.\r\n\r\n  Though, upon this cold floor lying,\r\n    Bitter the last pang may be--\r\n  Still your prayers have sweet replying--\r\n    The dear Lord has stood with me!\r\n\r\n  And His hand the gates shall open,\r\n    And the home shall fairer shine,\r\n  That mine earthly one was given,\r\n    And my life, dear land, for thine.\r\n\r\n  So I patient wait the dawning\r\n    That shall rise and still this pain--\r\n  Brighter than that last sweet morning\r\n    By the old house in the lane!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  When the sunbeams, growing bolder.\r\n    Sought him in the noon, next day--\r\n  Starved to death, New Hampshire's soldier\r\n    In the Libby Prison lay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC A SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch has been written concerning music. Volume after volume, shallow or\r\nerudite, sentimental or critical, prejudiced or impartial, has been\r\nissued from the press, but the want (in most instances) of a certain\r\nscientific foundation, and of rational canons of criticism, has greatly\r\nobscured the general treatment of the subject. Truth has usually been\r\nsought everywhere except in the only place where she was likely to be\r\nfound, namely, in the realm of _natural law_, and consequently, of\r\nscience. Old tomes of Greek and Latin lore, school traditions, the usage\r\nof the best masters, and the verdict of the human ear (a good judge, but\r\nnot always unperverted), have been appealed to for decisions upon\r\nquestions readily answered by a knowledge and consideration of first\r\nprinciples resting upon the immutable laws of sound, upon numerical\r\nrelations of vibrations. These principles are strictly scientific, and\r\ncapable of demonstration.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1828, the American public was told by Philip\r\nTrajetta,[A] that 'if counterpoint be not a science, neither is\r\nastronomy.' For want of proper expounders, this truth has made but\r\nlittle impression, and, while the Art of Music has advanced considerably\r\namong us, the Science has remained nearly stationary. In Europe,\r\nerudition, research, and collections of rules have not been wanting.\r\nMuch has been accomplished, but an exhaustive work, based upon the\r\nsimple laws of nature, has (so far as the writer can learn) never yet\r\nappeared. The profoundly learned and truly great Bohemian musician, W.\r\nJ. Tomaschek, who died in 1849, taught a system of musical science\r\nfounded upon a series of beautiful and easily comprehended natural laws.\r\nHis logical training and wide general cultivation gave him advantages\r\nenjoyed by few of his profession. The result of his researches has\r\nunfortunately never been published, and his system of harmony is\r\n_thoroughly_ known only by his more earnest and studious pupils.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: 'An Introduction to the Art and Science of Music,' written\r\nfor the American Conservatory of Philadelphia, by Philip Trajetta.\r\nPhiladelphia: Printed by I. Ashmead & Co., 1828.\r\n\r\nTrajetta was the son of a well-known Italian composer of the same name.\r\nHe was a pupil of the celebrated Conservatorio of Naples, and, as I have\r\nbeen informed, was about to obtain a professorship in the Conservatorio\r\nof Paris, when political circumstances diverted his course to America.\r\nHe was the friend of General Moreau and President Madison. Of noble\r\nappearance, fine manners, and sensitive temperament, he for some time\r\nreceived the consideration due to his talents and acquirements, but, in\r\nafter years, was sadly neglected, and finally died in Philadelphia,\r\nalmost literally of want. His musical knowledge perished with him; his\r\nmanuscripts (operas, oratorios, etc.) were, I believe, all burned by him\r\nbefore his death. A sad history, and, in a land where there has been so\r\nlittle opportunity for the beet musical instruction, a strange one!]\r\n\r\nTo define the provinces of _science_ and _art_, we may briefly say, that\r\nscience is concerned with the discovery of demonstrable principles, and\r\nthe deduction of undeniable corollaries; while art is occupied with\r\nexpression, performance, and the creative faculty with which man has\r\nbeen endowed. Music and astronomy are both sciences, that is, founded\r\nupon certain fixed and ascertainable laws; but astronomy is no art,\r\nbecause man has not the power to create, or even remodel worlds, and\r\nsend them rolling through space; while he can produce sounds, and\r\narrange them in such a way as to result in significant meaning and in\r\nbeauty, two of the chief ends of art.\r\n\r\nThe music of different periods in the world's history has rested upon\r\nthe various scales recognized during those periods as fundamental, which\r\nscales have been more or less complete as they have approached or\r\nreceded from the absolutely fundamental scale as given by nature. The\r\nscales now in use are not identical with the natural scale, but are, in\r\ndifferent degrees, _derived_ from it.\r\n\r\nThe natural scale is, in its commencement, harmonic, and is found by the\r\nconsideration of the natural progression of sound consequent upon the\r\ndivision and subdivision of a single string. It ought to be familiar to\r\nevery student of acoustics. The sound produced by the striking or\r\ntwanging of a single string (on a monochord) is called the tonic, and\r\nalso, from its position as the lowest note, the bass. If we divide this\r\nstring in half, we will obtain a series of vibrations producing a sound\r\nthe _same in character_, but, so to speak, _doubly high in pitch_. This\r\nsound is named the octave, because it is the eighth note in our common\r\ndiatonic scale. If we divide the string into three parts, the result\r\nwill be a sound called the large fifth; a division into four parts gives\r\nthe next higher octave of the bass; into five, gives the sound known as\r\nthe large third, commonly called major third; into six, the octave, or\r\nnext higher repetition, of the large fifth; into seven, the small\r\nseventh; into eight, the third repetition of the octave of the bass. The\r\nprogression thus far is hence: Bass--1st octave of bass--large fifth--2d\r\noctave of bass--large third--1st octave of large fifth--small\r\nseventh--3d octave of bass. Employing the alphabetical names of the\r\nnotes (always ascending): C--C--G--C--E--G--B flat--C.\r\n\r\nThis progression may truly be called _natural_, as it is that into which\r\nthe string naturally divides itself when stricken. An attentive ear can\r\nreadily distinguish the succession of sounds as far as the small\r\nseventh. The longer bass strings of any piano of full tone and resonant\r\nsounding board will suffice for the experiment. These are also the\r\nnatural notes as found, with differences in compass, in the simple horn\r\nand trumpet, and the phenomenon is visibly shown in the well-known\r\nexperiment of grains of sand placed on a brass or glass plate, and made\r\nto assume various forms and degrees of division under the influence of\r\ncertain musical sounds.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to elaborate the subject, or to show the\r\nprogression of the natural scale as produced by further subdivisions of\r\nthe string. Suffice it to say that the remaining notes of the common\r\ndiatonic scale are _selected_ (with some slight modifications) from\r\nsounds thus produced. This scale cannot then be considered, in all its\r\nparts, as the fundamental, natural one. Nature permits to man a great\r\nvariety of thought and action, provided always he does not too far\r\ninfringe her organic laws. She may allow opposing forces to result in\r\nsmall perturbations, but fundamental principles and their legitimate\r\nconsequences must remain intact.\r\n\r\nNo one can ponder upon the above-mentioned harmonic foundation of the\r\nmusical scale without conceiving a new idea of the beauty and\r\nsignificance of that glorious art and science which may be proved to be\r\nbased upon laws decreed by the Almighty himself. The one consideration\r\nthat, in all probability, no single musical sound comes to us alone, but\r\neach one is accompanied by its choir of ascending harmonic sequences, is\r\nsufficient to afford matter for many a wholesome and delightful\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of regarding our earthly music as a purely human\r\ninvention, we may look upon it as a genuine gift from heaven, a\r\n_legitimate_ forerunner of the exalted strains one day to be heard in\r\nthe heavenly Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe laws of vibrations producing sound, of undulations giving rise to\r\nlight and color, of oscillations resulting in heat, the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies, the flow of electric and magnetic currents, the\r\nrhythmical beat of the pulse, the unceasing march of mind and human\r\nevents, all lead us to the consideration of _motion_ as one of the\r\ngreatest of secondary causes in the guidance of the universe. Do we not,\r\nindeed, find the same element in the Divine Trinity of the Godhead, in\r\nthe eternal generation of the Son, and the procession of the Holy\r\nSpirit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The stars move calm within the brow of night:\r\n    No sea of molten flame therein is pent,\r\n    Nor meteors, from that burning chaos, blent,\r\n  Shoot from their orbits in a maddening flight.\r\n  But in the brain is clasped a flood of light,\r\n    Whose seething fires can find no form, nor vent,\r\n    And pour, through the strained eyeballs, glances, rent\r\n  From suffering worlds within, hidden from sight\r\n    And laboring for birth. This chaos deep\r\n  Touch thou, O Thought! and crystallize to form,\r\n  Resolve to order its wild lightning storm\r\n    Of meteor dreams! that into life shall leap\r\n  At thy command, and move before thy face\r\n  In starry majesty, and awful grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR A CONTEST FOR IDEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of those curious pamphlets, or _brochures_, as they call them, which\r\nthe French political writers make the frequent medium of their\r\ndiscussions, was lately published at Paris, under the title of 'France,\r\nMexico, and the Confederate States.' It is less a discussion of the\r\nMexican question than an adroit appeal, under cover of it, in behalf of\r\nthe Southern confederacy. It addresses itself to the enthusiastic\r\ntemperament of Frenchmen, with the specious sophism, underlying its\r\nargument, that the South is fighting for _ideas_, the North for _power_.\r\nThis is a sophism largely current abroad, and not without its dupes even\r\nat home. The purpose of this paper is to expose the nakedness of it.\r\n\r\nFighting for ideas may be a very sublime thing, and it may likewise be a\r\nvery ridiculous thing. The valorous knight of La Mancha set forth to\r\nfight for ideas, and he began to wage war with windmills. He fought for\r\nideas, indeed, but his distempered imagination quite overlooked the fact\r\nthat they were ideas long since dead, beyond hope of resurrection. And\r\nit is but the statement of palpable truth to declare that whatever ideas\r\nthe South is fighting for now, are of a like obsolete character. The\r\nglory of feudalism, as a system of society, is departed; and its\r\nattendant glories of knight-errantry and human slavery are departed with\r\nit. Don Quixote thought to reestablish the one, and the South deludes\r\nitself with the hope of reestablishing the other. Times and ideas have\r\nchanged since the days of feudalism, and the South only repeats in\r\nbehalf of slavery the tragic farce of Don Quixote in behalf of\r\nknight-errantry. Both alike would roll back the centuries of modern\r\ncivilization, and, reversing the dreams of Plato and Sir Thomas More,\r\nwould hope to find a Utopia in the dark ages of the past.\r\n\r\nWe do not ridicule, much less deny the power of ideas. On the contrary,\r\nwe believe heartily in ideas, and in men of ideas. We accept ideas as\r\nforces of civilization, and we would magnify their office as teachers\r\nand helpers of man, in his poor strivings after good. Man is ever\r\nrepeating the despondent cry of the Psalmist, 'Who will show us any\r\ngood?' It is the mission of ideas, the ministering angels of\r\ncivilization, to lift him into a realm of glorious communion with good\r\nand spiritual things, and so inspire him to heroic effort in his work.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while thus willing to glorify the office of ideas, we hold\r\nthem to be of less worth than institutions. That is, ideas, of\r\nthemselves, are of little practical value. An idea, disjoined from an\r\ninstitution, is spirit without body; just as an institution that does\r\nnot embody a noble idea, is body without spirit. An idea, to be\r\neffective, must be organized; an institution, to be effective, must have\r\nbreathed into it the breath of life, must be vivified with an idea. It\r\nis only thus, in and through institutions, that ideas can exert their\r\nproper influence upon society.\r\n\r\nThis is, indeed, the American principle of reform. The thorough\r\nconviction of it in the hearts of the American people has thus far saved\r\nus from the anarchy of radicalism, which is ever agitating new ideas;\r\nand is now destined to save us from the bolder-faced anarchy of\r\nrevolution, seeking to overthrow our institutions.\r\n\r\nBut fighting for ideas, what does it mean? The French Revolution (that\r\ngreat abortion of the eighteenth century and of history) was fought for\r\nideas, and ended in despotism. Does fighting for ideas mean despotism?\r\nThe French Revolution went directly to the root of the question. It\r\nstruck, as radicalism can never help but strike, at the very foundations\r\nof society. Hence, in France, the abolition of institutions (the\r\nsafeguards of ideas), and the consequent check of the great principles\r\nwhich the Revolution set out to establish. Thus it is that the French\r\nRevolution has made itself the great example of history, warning nations\r\nagainst the crude radicalisms of theorists. It is not enough to fight\r\nfor ideas--we must fight also for institutions. Yet society seems never\r\nto learn the lesson which Nature never tires of repeating, that all true\r\ngrowth is gradual. Political science must start with the first axiom of\r\nnatural science, that 'Nature acts by insensible gradations.' Radicalism\r\nis not reform. Radicalism and conservatism must combine together to make\r\nreform. An eminent divine and scholar lately illustrated the point thus:\r\n'The arm of progressive power rests always on the fulcrum of stability.'\r\nThis statement is exhaustive, and sums up the case.\r\n\r\nBut let us examine the question of ideas a little more closely, and see\r\nwhether, indeed, it is the South or the North that is fighting for ideas\r\nin this contest. And let us interpret ideas, according to the etymology\r\nof the word, to mean those things which the mind _sees_, and the\r\nconscience accepts and recognizes and _knows_, to be just elements, or\r\nprinciples, of civilization. For it is only such ideas that call forth a\r\nresponse from the mighty instincts of the masses. The common conscience\r\nof mankind tests the ideas always, as the apostle teaches us to try the\r\nspirits, 'whether they are of God.'\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE IDEA OF POLITICAL EQUALITY.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be disputed that the great idea of the age is the\r\ndemocratic idea, or the idea of political equality. It is the idea that\r\nall men are kings, because equals: just as the highest idea of theology\r\nis, at last, that all men are ordained to be priests unto God, The\r\nproblem of political philosophy is to make this idea a reality and fact.\r\nOur institutions have this for their sublime mission. We are seeking to\r\ndemonstrate, in the American way, the essential truth of those ideas\r\nwhich failed of their perfect fruit in France, because not rightly\r\norganized and applied. America is the youngest and last-born of the\r\nnations; and to her it has been intrusted to develop the democratic idea\r\nin the system of representative government. Politics is thus made to\r\nharmonize and be at one with progress. The last-born of nations is set\r\nfor the teaching and developing of the last-born of governmental\r\nprinciples. If, moreover, we regard America, according to the teachings\r\nof physical geography, as the first-born of the continents, we may\r\ndiscover another beautiful harmony. For our democratic system, in basing\r\nitself on the idea of political equality does, in effect, start from the\r\nvery first principle of all true government; and this first principle of\r\ngovernment thus finds its temple and home in the first of the\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nBut let us not be misled by specious names. Let us not mistake for\r\npolitical equality the crude fancies of idealists, who would reverse the\r\norder of creation, and declare an equality that does not exist.\r\nPolitical equality neither assumes nor infers social equality; and\r\ntherefore is not subversive of social order. It does not presuppose\r\nnatural equality; and, therefore, is not contrary to palpable evidence,\r\nand hence unphilosophical and false. Political equality is but the\r\ncorollary and logical result of that maxim of our system, set forth in\r\nour Declaration of Independence, that 'government derives its just\r\npowers from the consent of the governed.'\r\n\r\nPolitical equality is, therefore, the essential condition of our\r\nrepublic. It is the alpha and omega of our political philosophy. It is\r\nthe first factor in the problem of our government. It is the organized\r\nidea of our nation, and is embodied in that nation. It is the lifespring\r\nof our institutions. It is the basis of our government. It is what makes\r\nthe United States of America the hope of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, political equality may not be the _fact_ of our\r\ngovernment, the nation stands for that idea. The founders of the\r\ngovernment were content with affirming the great idea; and they left to\r\nthe benignant influences of time and conscience and Christianity, under\r\nour institutions, the work of reducing the idea to fact. For more than\r\nhalf a century the work has gone on, and still 'goes bravely on.' In\r\npeace and war the same magnificent Constitution is over us, and that\r\nConstitution, avoiding designedly the odious word slave, is a chart and\r\ncovenant of freedom.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposed to this idea is the organization of the Southern\r\nconfederacy--the essential and substantial antipodes of our system. The\r\nUnited States stands at the political zenith; the confederate States at\r\nthe political nadir. The Southern confederacy denies the truth of our\r\nsystem, and asserts that political equality is a fiction and\r\nfoolishness. To it, indeed, political equality is a stumbling block; for\r\nthe confederate constitution bases itself openly and unblushingly on the\r\nprinciple of property in man. It has been blasphemously announced that\r\nthis is the stone which the builders of our government refused, and that\r\nit is now become the headstone of the corner of a divinely instituted\r\nnation. The blasphemy that hesitated not to declare John Brown equal\r\nwith Jesus Christ, is hardly worse than this; for John Brown was, at\r\nleast, an honest fanatic. The traitorous chiefs of the Southern\r\nrebellion are neither fanatics nor honest men. They have stifled the\r\nvoice of conscience, and are bad men.\r\n\r\nIf their scheme of society is true, then our faith in God, and our faith\r\nin man as the child of God, are false faiths; 'and we are found false\r\nwitnesses of God.' For it has been common hitherto to believe in the\r\nloftiest capacities of man, as the child of God, and made in the divine\r\nimage; and this belief has had the sanction of all ages. Cheered and\r\nstrengthened by such a belief, men have struggled bravely and steadily\r\nagainst priestcraft and kingcraft, against the absolutism of power in\r\nevery form. The magnificent ideal of a government which the masses of\r\nmankind should themselves establish and uphold, has been the quickening\r\nlife of all republics since time began. It is the noblest of optimisms;\r\nand, like religion, has never been without a witness in the human soul,\r\never inspiring the genius of prophecy and song, ever moving the great\r\ninstincts of humanity. Science, fathoming all things, gave expression to\r\nthis instinct and hope and belief of the ages in the principle of\r\npolitical equality as a basis of government. It is, in other words, the\r\nscience of political self-government. It was reserved for the nineteenth\r\ncentury to develop the idea, for the American nation to illustrate its\r\npractical power and its splendid possibilities. The question of man's\r\ncapacity for self-government in at issue now in the contest between the\r\nNorth and South, and its champion is the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE IDEA OF NATIONALITY.\r\n\r\nThere is another idea involved in this war; and, unlike the idea of\r\npolitical equality, it is sanctioned by the precedents of all ages and\r\nall nations, so as to preclude any possibility that it should now be\r\ndisputed. It bases itself on that principle of order which is heaven's\r\nfirst law, and so commends itself to men as the fitting first law of\r\nsociety. It is the idea of nationality; in a word, of government. Like\r\nthe idea of political equality, it also finds its champion in the North.\r\n\r\nThe Southern confederacy is the organized protest of anarchy against\r\nlaw. It represents in politics that doctrine in religious thought which\r\ndeclares every man a law unto himself. It kicks against the restraints\r\nof constitutions and laws, declaring virtually that when a law, or a\r\nconstitution ordaining laws, ceases to be agreeable, its binding force\r\nis gone. For a similar and equally valid reason, some men (and, alas!\r\nsome women), disregarding the solemn sanctions of the marriage tie, have\r\nbeen willing to set aside this first law of the family and of home. The\r\nSouthern confederacy also makes light of national agreements, disposing\r\nof them according to the facile doctrine of repudiation, which its\r\nperjured chief once adopted as the basis of a system of state finance.\r\nIt is eminently in accordance with the fitness of things, that the man\r\nwho could counsel his State to repudiate its bonds, should stand at the\r\nhead of a confederacy which began its existence by repudiating the\r\nsacred agreement to which the faith and fortune of all its members were\r\nsolemnly pledged, and under the broad shield of whose protection they\r\nhad grown prosperous and powerful. If one may be permitted to express an\r\nopinion different from Mr. Stephens's, it might be said that the corner\r\nstone of the Southern confederacy is properly repudiation. On the other\r\nhand, the cause of the United States is the cause of order. It is also\r\nthe cause of freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note the union of these two forces of civilization;\r\nfor hitherto, in the great wars of history, liberty has generally\r\nopposed itself to order, and has too often seemed to be synonymous with\r\nanarchy. The passions of the masses have too often burst forth, in great\r\nrevolutions, like volcanic eruptions, carrying devastation and\r\ndestruction in their path; The French Revolution stands for the type and\r\ninstance of all these terrible catastrophes. This war of ours presents a\r\ndifferent spectacle; for in the maintenance of it the two principles of\r\nfreedom and order go hand in hand. It is this union of them which\r\ndemands for the United States, in this contest, the support of both the\r\ngreat parties of civilization--the conservatives and the radicals. It\r\nis, therefore, preeminently a just war, because waged in the combined\r\ninterests of liberty and order.\r\n\r\nBut, it is objected, you, in effect, deny the right of revolution. No;\r\non the contrary, we establish it. For the right of revolution is no\r\nright for any people unless they have wrongs. The right of revolution is\r\nnot an absolute, it is a relative right. Like all such rights, it has\r\nits limitations--the limitation of the public law and the public\r\nconscience. For neither the public law nor the public conscience\r\nsanctions revolution for the sole sake of revolution. That brave old\r\nrevolutionist of early Rome, Brutus, understood this well, and though\r\nhis country was groaning under the oppression of Tarquin, he sighed for\r\n'a cause.' There must be a cause for revolution, and such a cause as\r\nwill commend itself to men's consciences, as well as to the just\r\nprinciples of law and equity.\r\n\r\nSome men seem to think that revolution is, of itself, a blessed thing.\r\nThey love change in government for the sake of change. When Julius Caesar\r\ninvaded Gaul he found just such men, and he characterized them, in his\r\nterse military way, as those who 'studied new things,' that is, desired\r\nconstantly a renewal of public affairs, or renovation of government. He\r\nfound these men, moreover, his most ready tools, even in his designs\r\nagainst their country's liberties; and it would seem as though this\r\nrevolutionary characteristic of the early inhabitants of Gaul had\r\nremained impressed upon their descendants ever since.\r\n\r\nWe repeat that the right of revolution is a limited right. An absolute\r\nand unlimited right of revolution would only be the other extreme of an\r\nabsolute and unlimited government; and this is not the age of absolutism\r\nin matters of government. Just as absolute liberty is an impracticable\r\nthing, in the present constitution of human beings, so the absolute\r\nright of revolution, which derives its highest title from the sacred\r\nright of liberty, is equally impracticable. We must be careful how we\r\nuse these words liberty and revolution. Words are things in a time of\r\nearnest work like the present. The war is settling the old scholastic\r\ndispute for us, and is making us all realists. Liberty and loyalty and\r\nlaw are no longer brave words merely: they are things, and things of\r\ntremendous power; and some men slink away from them. But we need to\r\nremember that liberty does not mean license. The political liberty of\r\nour time, testing the truth of our representative democracy, is\r\nconstitutional liberty. It presupposes an organic law, giving force and\r\neffect to it: and without this organic law, liberty is a delusion and a\r\ndream--a vague unsubstantiality. Liberty is like the lightning. To be\r\nmade an agent of man's political salvation, it must be brought down from\r\nits home in the clouds, and put under the restraints and checks of\r\ninstitutions. The institutions protect it; it sanctifies the\r\ninstitutions. In its unchecked power, like the lightning, it annihilates\r\nand overwhelms man. Unchecked, it becomes a reckless license, disgracing\r\nhistory and its own fair name with such scenes as the French Revolution,\r\nand causing the martyred defenders of its sacred majesty to cry out, in\r\nbitter agony of disappointment: 'O Liberty, what crimes are committed in\r\nthy name!'\r\n\r\nIn fact, the liberty that is valuable is the liberty that is regulated\r\nby law; just as the law that is valuable is the law that has the spirit\r\nof liberty. This is the American doctrine of constitutional liberty, as\r\nit has ever been expounded by our great statesmen and orators; and it\r\ncommends itself to the sound sense of all reflecting men.\r\n\r\nIn seeking, therefore, to subvert our Constitution, the South attack the\r\nprinciple of liberty, which is the basis of it, and which it guarantees.\r\nMore than this, they attack the principle of constitutional liberty; for\r\ntheir secession is in virtue of that unchecked liberty which is license,\r\nthat absolute liberty which is anarchy. They are not contending for the\r\nsacred right of revolution. It is treason against that majestic\r\nprinciple to apply it to the cause of the South. They were not\r\noppressed; they were not even controlled by a dominant party opposed to\r\nthem; their will was almost law, for it made our laws. According to the\r\n_theory_ of our Constitution, they possessed equal rights with all other\r\nsections of the Union; under the _practice_ of it, and in _fact_, they\r\nhad gradually come to possess and were actually wielding greater power\r\nthan all other sections. It is thus seen how vain and absurd is the plea\r\nthat they were driven into revolution to redress wrongs, or that they\r\nrevolted and seceded for the purpose of preserving rights. Their rights\r\nwere neither actually assailed, nor were likely to be assailed. The\r\nprotest of that eminent statesman of the South who afterward ('oh, what\r\na fall was there, my countrymen!') became the second officer of its\r\ntraitorous government, is conclusive evidence on this point. The\r\nSouthern rebellion is simply and entirely the effort to secure exclusive\r\ncontrol where formerly the South had a joint control. Robert Toombs\r\nsaid, in a conversation, in Georgia, in the winter of 1860-'61: 'We\r\nintend, sir, to have a government of our own and we won't have any\r\ncompromises.' To the same import is the letter of Mason to Davis, in\r\n1856, which has lately seen the light. To one not blinded by prejudice,\r\nindeed, the evidences are overwhelming of a long-plotted conspiracy on\r\nthe part of certain leading politicians, without the knowledge and\r\ncontrary to the known intentions of the Southern people. The Southern\r\nrebellion is simply the attempt to break up a constitutional government,\r\nby politicians who had become dissatisfied with the natural and\r\ninevitable workings and tendencies of it, even though administered by\r\nthemselves. It is simply, therefore, the question of anarchy that we\r\nhave to deal with. Therefore, we say that the North is fighting for the\r\nidea of government.\r\n\r\nWe are not seeking to perpetuate oppressive power. On the other hand,\r\nthe rebellion is a flagrant attempt to organize oppression. We are\r\nseeking to perpetuate power, it is true, but a power which has stood for\r\nnearly a hundred years, and must continue to stand, if it stand at all,\r\nas a bulwark against oppression. We are vindicating our right to be, as\r\na nation. We are proving our title to rank among the powers of the\r\nearth. We are vindicating the majesty of our supreme organic law. That\r\nsupreme organic law is the Constitution. It ordains for itself a method\r\nof amendment, so as to leave no right of revolution against it. It\r\nadmits no right of revolution, because in ordaining and establishing it\r\nthe parties to it expressly merged that right in another principle,\r\nadopted to avoid the necessity of a resort to revolution. In other\r\nwords, the right of revolution is in our Constitution exalted into the\r\npeaceful principle of amendment. Instead, therefore, of really being\r\ndenied, the right of revolution is, indeed, enlarged and consecrated in\r\nour system of government, which rests upon that right. In vindicating\r\nand maintaining, therefore, that system, we vindicate and maintain with\r\nit the right of revolution. But we deny any such thing as a right of\r\nrevolution for the sole sake of revolution; because it leads to anarchy.\r\nWe deny the right of revolution for the sake of oppression; because it\r\nleads to absolutism. Revolution in the interests of order, justice, and\r\nfreedom, we hold to be the only right worthy of the name, and God help\r\nour nation never to oppose such a revolution!\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written, an article in _Frazer's Magazine_, for\r\nlast October, has fallen under the writer's notice, which discusses the\r\npoint under consideration, and expresses similar views with those here\r\nstated. An extract from it is given to show how the question is viewed\r\nfrom a British stand-point:\r\n\r\n     'The principle of American independence was, that when a\r\n     considerable body of men are badly governed and oppressed by a\r\n     government under which they live, they have a right to resist and\r\n     withdraw from it; and unless everything in the history of England\r\n     of which we have been accustomed to boast, from Magna Charta to the\r\n     Reform Bill, was a crime, this principle is perfectly true. To deny\r\n     to the United States, as most of our public writers did deny to\r\n     them, the right of putting down resistance not justified by\r\n     oppression, and to impose upon them the duty of submitting at once\r\n     to any resistance whatsoever, whether justified or not, was\r\n     equivalent to maintaining that chronic anarchy was the only state\r\n     of things which could exist in North America.'\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to read in a British periodical so clear a statement of\r\nthis just distinction. We cannot forbear to cite another extract from\r\nthe same article, because it confirms so clearly the argument of this\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n     'The Dutch fought the Spaniards for their hearths, homes, and\r\n     churches; the French fought all Europe with famine and the\r\n     guillotine behind them, and empire and plenty in front. The English\r\n     in India had the pride of superior race and the memory of\r\n     inexpiable injuries to urge them against the Sepoys; but if ever a\r\n     nation in this world sacrificed itself deliberately and manfully to\r\n     an idea, this has been the case with the Americans.'\r\n\r\nWhat is this idea to which we have thus bravely sacrificed ourselves,\r\neven a phlegmatic Englishman being the judge? It is the idea of the\r\nnation--the idea that the nation is the gift of God, to be cherished and\r\ndefended as a sacred trust; and that we can no more rid ourselves of its\r\nobligations than we can rid ourselves of the obligations of home or the\r\nchurch. To the reckless assertion of those who say that the United\r\nStates is, in this war, actuated by the lust for power, and is not moved\r\nby the inspiration of great ideas, we oppose the foregoing candid\r\nstatement of a third party, and one not very likely to be prejudiced in\r\nour favor. It is the testimony of an unwilling witness, and therefore of\r\ngreat weight.\r\n\r\nSumming up the points that have been considered in this paper, it seems\r\nclear that so far as the war is a contest for ideas, the North, standing\r\nfor the United States, has the right of it. For, first, we contend for\r\npolitical equality, the grand idea of the age and the ages;\r\ncomprehending within itself, and presupposing, as a logical premise, the\r\ngrander idea of liberty. Thus also we vindicate the rights of man, as a\r\nfact of government and as a principle of political philosophy. And,\r\nsecondly, we contend for the sacred right of order, as opposed to the\r\ndestructive radicalism of revolution for the sake of oppression and not\r\nin the name of liberty.\r\n\r\nWe believe that our nation has been born, in the providence of God, to\r\nthe magnificent mission of developing the democratic idea, of the rule\r\nof the people--the idea that every man is a king, and that humanity\r\nitself is royal because made in the image of God. The nation is now\r\nvindicating that mission before the world. In the success of it all the\r\ngreat ideas that cheer on our poor humanity in its toiling\r\nmarch--liberty, justice, political order--confirmed and made sure by a\r\ngovernment organized for the purpose of securing and maintaining them,\r\nare bound up; and--with that mission those ideas, as organized powers,\r\nmust live or die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS TO THE AMERICAN FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not so much signify what a man does for a livelihood, provided\r\nhe does it well. The people must sooner or later learn this catholic\r\ndoctrine, or one element of republicanism will never be knit into our\r\ncharacter. The doing it well is the essential point, whether one builds\r\na ship or writes a poem. Does the American farmer do his work well? And,\r\nif not, wherewith shall he be advised, persuaded, encouraged, and taught\r\nto do better or the best?\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that three fourths of the people of the United States\r\nare agriculturists, and nearly all the rest laborers of some sort\r\ndependent upon them. Every economist knows that the interests of\r\nagriculture, manufactures, and commerce are one and indivisible. He who\r\nby word or deed helps one, helps all, and thereby moves civilization\r\nonward one step at least. Before our Government takes hold of the\r\ncondition of agriculture in the United States as a state measure, and\r\neven after it comes up to the hour when we shall have a Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce in the cabinet, after the manner\r\nof France, Italy, and Prussia, the farmer himself, individually, must\r\nwork some important and radical changes in his social and industrial\r\npolity, and prepare himself for the generous assistance of a wise and\r\nbeneficent Government.\r\n\r\nThe farmer supports every other material interest. Standing upon the\r\nprimary strata of civilization, he bears on his broad hands and stout\r\nshoulders the 'weight of mightiest monarchies.' Daniel Webster calls him\r\n'the founder of civilization.'\r\n\r\nIs it at all necessary that the spring in the hills should be cool,\r\nclear, and pure, and wind its way over a granitic soil, through green\r\nmeadows, beneath the shading forest, into a sandy basin, to form a\r\nbeautiful lake in a retired, rural retreat? If so, is it at all\r\nnecessary that the moral virtues of the founders of society should be\r\nduly educated, cultured into the soul, leaving the impress on generation\r\nafter generation, of honor, of order, of manliness, of thrift? The\r\ncondition of the farmers is the postulate by which the sagacious\r\neconomist will foretell the future prosperity of the nation they\r\nrepresent. This is what the American farmer should have presented to him\r\nfrom every stand-point. It is lamentable that this vocation should be so\r\nsadly represented by the most of those who are engaged in it.\r\n\r\nThis occupation of farming is the noblest work which can engage the\r\nattention of man. Off of his farm, whether it be large or small, the\r\nfarmer, by diligent and intelligent cultivation, can gather whatever he\r\nor the world needs; what the world needs for its manufactures and\r\ncommerce; what he needs for his personal comfort, pleasure, or the\r\ngratification of his natural tastes;--the two crops which furnish the\r\ndaily bread to the material and spiritual nature of man;--the green\r\nfields, than which nothing is more beautiful; the sweet song of birds,\r\ntheir gay plumage, their happy conferences, their winged life, making\r\nmelodious the woods and fields; the sky, ever above us, ever changing,\r\ngrand at morning, magnificent at evening, hanging like a gracious\r\nbenediction over us; the flowers, ever opening their petals to the sun,\r\nturning their beauty on the air, to delight, instruct, and bless\r\nmankind;--indulging his taste for art, in the plan of his farm and\r\nbuildings, their claims to architectural skill; in the planting of his\r\nfruit and ornamental trees, 'in groves, in lines, in copses;' in the\r\nform and make of his fishponds, shady walks, grottos, or rural seats for\r\nquiet resort for study, comfort, pleasure, or rest.\r\n\r\nThe ancients paid great attention to the cultivation of the earth. Many\r\nof the best men of Greece were agriculturists. Mind was given to it, and\r\ngreat progress was made in the improvement of implements; in the method\r\nof cultivation, and in the additional yield of their farms. The Romans\r\ncontinued for a long period to improve on the state of agriculture as\r\nthey received it from the Grecians, until the political condition of\r\ntheir country destroyed all freedom and independence of action and\r\nthought. The best and greatest men of all ages and countries, statesmen,\r\nscholars, kings, and presidents, have loved it, followed it, and labored\r\nfor its advancement. Do noble minds stoop to ignoble vocations, and\r\nbecome identified with them? This nation, not yet a century old, can\r\nboast, as among the statesmen-farmers, of Washington, Adams, Jefferson,\r\nPatrick Henry, Franklin, Jackson, Calhoun, Clay, and Webster, and many\r\nothers, the least of whose greatness of character was not that they\r\nloved nature, or knew the charm of agricultural pursuits. The occupation\r\nhas become sanctified by their devotion to it.\r\n\r\nWe all know the sympathy and love of the late lamented Prince Albert for\r\nthe vocation of farming, and the liberality with which, on his model\r\nfarm, experiments were verified which in any manner might contribute to\r\nthe interests of the farmer. He even entered the lists for the prize for\r\nthe best stock at the yearly exhibitions of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety. There is something very suggestive of nobility in this vocation\r\nof farming, when the brightest intellects of the nation bow in homage to\r\nthe strength of mother earth, and seek by severe thought, study, and\r\nexperiment, to assist a further yield of her kindly fruits, or persuade\r\nher to bestow a portion of her bounties, so long withheld, upon the\r\nwooing husbandman. It marks agriculture as the first and highest calling\r\nfor the development in the highest degree of the nation and of mankind.\r\n\r\nEvery man may have his plot of ground, in the cultivation and adornment\r\nof which he may realize the pleasure which accompanies the calling of\r\namateur farmer, horticulturist, or florist, in which he is in constant\r\ncommunication with nature and her beauty. 'In it there is no corruption,\r\nbut rather goodness.'\r\n\r\nHow kindly nature seems to have dealt with some of the old farmers who\r\neven now tread the broad earth, beloved and reverenced by all who know\r\nthem! What simplicity and purity of speech; what honesty of manner; what\r\nkind dispositions; what charity of judgment; what tenderness of heart;\r\nwhat nobility of soul seem to have concentrated in each one of them!\r\nThey are the gifts of nature, gathered, developed, interpreted,\r\npersonified in man. They are our aristocracy. From them through\r\ngeneration after generation shall flow the pure blood of the best men in\r\nrepublican America. Ages hence, the children who enjoy the privileges of\r\nthis republic, and endeavor to trace their lineage through history to\r\nfind the fountain of their present American stock, will as surely meet\r\nwith no unpleasant encounter, nor be compelled to forego the search from\r\nfear of mortification, as they trace their family line through long\r\ngenerations of intelligent American farmers. Superficial 'Young America'\r\nand 'our best society' may smirk, snicker, sneer, and live on, slaves to\r\nfashion and the whims of Mrs. Grundy, in their fancied secure social\r\nposition for all time. But ere long the balance of man's better\r\njudgment, the best society of great men, and representatives for history\r\nof a great people, will weigh in opposite scales the artificialities,\r\nthe formalities, the selfishness of popular social circles, against the\r\nhonesty, the naturalness, the simplicity, the worth of the practical\r\nlovers of nature; and the result shall be the inscription upon the wall\r\nwhich made their prototypes of old tremble, reflecting upon them also\r\nits ghostly and terrific glare. Were it not for the infusion almost\r\nconstantly going on, from the country, of fresh blood into the veins of\r\nthe diseased body politic in our largest cities, destruction, disgrace,\r\nand financial ruin would early mark the spot where once flourished a\r\nproud and sinful people.\r\n\r\nIn farming, man has to do with nature. Out of doors he spends the\r\ngreater portion of his life. His intelligent eye takes in the beautiful\r\nobjects of land and sky, sea and mountain; his refined ear, by practice\r\nand cultivation, delights in the exquisite harmony of the birds, the\r\nmusic of the wind, the murmuring of the sea, the sighing amid the\r\nforests;--the beauty of the flowers, springing in the utmost profusion\r\nat his feet--peeping at early spring from beneath the lately fallen\r\nsnow, an earnest that life yet remains under the clods of apparently\r\nexhausted nature--their continued offerings through the long and sultry\r\ndays of summer; the trees putting on their rich and glowing robes at\r\nautumn, ripening for their restoration to the bosom which gave them life\r\nand which yielded them to us for a season, clothing all the hills,\r\nvalleys, and mountains with the gorgeous colors from 'nature's royal\r\nlaboratory.' Who can say this beauty and this pleasure are for nought?\r\nThe intelligence which observes and loves these sights hesitates not,\r\nnor can it be deterred from reflecting upon their Source. The farmer,\r\nturning the sod with the plough, and dropping the grain into the newly\r\nturned furrow, expects life amid the decay of the clod. The favorable\r\nsunshine and shower, the gentle dews and heat of summer bring forth,\r\nafter a partial decay of the seed, the blade, the ear, and after that\r\nthe full corn in the ear. The perfume of the newly turned earth\r\nexhilarates and refreshes the spirits of the laborer and what appears\r\nthe hardest work becomes a welcome task. Toil here has its immediate\r\nrecompense. Always peaceful, always contented and cheerful, always kind,\r\nthere is no want of companions whose presence is delightful and never\r\nburdensome. The oriole, the swallow, the sparrow, the cawing crow, the\r\nchipmuck, or the squirrel will not desert him. He can always rely upon\r\ntheir presence while engaged in the necessary preparation for the\r\nharvest. The flowers are with him, and the perfume from the blossoms in\r\nthe fields and orchard will fall like incense upon his receptive spirit.\r\nHis thoughts will turn involuntarily to the Origin of all Good, from\r\nwhich have come to him, in so great abundance, the favorable conditions\r\nfor happiness and peace.\r\n\r\nContemplating in silence and alone, away from the distractions of busy\r\nlife in cities, the disappointments of politics, and the petty\r\ndisturbances and quarrels of a more crowded existence, his thoughts\r\nbecome pure, holy, and sacred.\r\n\r\nThe tree grows slowly but surely beside his door, under whose shadows he\r\nhas rested at the close of the summer's day, and, with his family about\r\nhim, reflected upon his finished labors, and planned the work for\r\nto-morrow. The wonderful power of the Creator, and the matchless\r\nargument for His existence, as displayed in the beauty of the heavens,\r\nare spread before him. Its presence is a blessing to him. This tree, a\r\ncentury ago the tiny seed of the beautiful elm, which floated perhaps on\r\nsome zephyr, or, tossed by some summer gale, dropped noiselessly into\r\nits cradle at this door--fortune favored its growth, and protected it\r\nfrom the injuries of chance or intent. It patiently grew and spread its\r\nhospitable arms, as if to embrace the surrounding neighborhood, and is\r\nnow a protection and safeguard, a blessing and a continued promise of\r\nthe watchfulness and care of the Father. This honest, grateful, simple\r\nsoul has learned from it the beauty of a patient spirit. It has been\r\nalways to him the generous companion of his weary moments, never failing\r\nto return at spring the beauty so ruthlessly torn at autumn; rendering\r\nto his just soul the contentment of the well-doer in this world's works,\r\nyet still progressing, growing, and enlarging in its sphere of\r\nusefulness and trust.\r\n\r\nThe regularity in the procession of the seasons, the dependence and\r\nfaith inculcated by their never-failing return of the bounties asked of\r\nthem for his proper observance of their demands, have rendered order a\r\ncontrolling power with him, and punctuality has become a virtue.\r\n\r\nThe large independence of the concerns of men has not made him\r\nautocratic in manner, nor indifferent to progress in the condition of\r\nmankind. Faithful to the duties of the good citizen, and to himself, he\r\nhas not forgotten his moral duties toward the social polity, and neither\r\nstate, nor church, nor school, nor family, but feels the influence of\r\nhis tender care. Health has been always with him and on his side.\r\nCleanliness is throughout his household, and scrupulous care of the\r\nmanners, neatness, and thrift which make a good farmer's home so\r\ncheerful, is his.\r\n\r\nSuch is the intelligent, patient, thorough cultivator of the soil. Is\r\nthere not a nobility of nature in it, far surpassing that which the\r\nfalse standard of society gives to man? What profession, business, or\r\nvocation of any sort engaged in by man, carries in its legitimate course\r\nthese joys, this peacefulness, this hope? Here are not the anxieties,\r\nnor perplexities, nor fears, nor losses attendant upon the occupations\r\nin the more crowded haunts of business. Plenty fills his garners;\r\nhappiness attends his footsteps; peace crowns his life.\r\n\r\nWe would that this good soul might truly represent every farmer on our\r\nsoil. We are compelled to acknowledge the shortcomings of this class of\r\npersons, upon whom so much depends, and, by showing in which direction\r\ntheir prominent faults lie, endeavor to persuade them to accept a better\r\nstanding in the social state, where they are so much needed.\r\n\r\nA man shows in his daily acts the early education of his home. The\r\nimpressions there made upon him in his young and growing life are\r\nproverbially deep and abiding. The circumstances which develop the\r\ncharacter of the good farmer in one town, are the circumstances which\r\ndevelop the good farmer wheresoever he may be; but the circumstances\r\nwhich make so many of our farmers at this day, coarse in speech, vulgar\r\nin manners, untidy in dress and in the arrangement of their farms and\r\ntheir habitations, ignorant, thoughtless, thriftless, indifferent,\r\nwasteful, lazy, are not arbitrary circumstances, but pliant and\r\nyielding, willing instruments, in the hands of good workmen, to raise,\r\nelevate, and instruct all who can be brought within their influence.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturist who combines with his knowledge and skill in farming a\r\nrefined taste for the simple elegancies which may form a part and parcel\r\nof every well-ordered homestead, will often grieve at the neglect,\r\nindolence, and ignorance, shown by the too sad condition of many of our\r\nso-called American farms.\r\n\r\nThe farmhouse of this waste place we call a farm, is located as near as\r\npossible to the dusty highway which passes through the country.\r\nUnpainted, or unwhitewashed, without a front fence, without shade trees\r\nor flowers near it, or by it, it stands like a grim and sombre sentinel,\r\nguarding a harsh and lonely existence, at once a prophecy and a warning.\r\nThere is no home feeling in it. Everything connected with the internal\r\nmovements or the external management of the place is in full view: the\r\nwoodpile with its chips scattered about over a radius of fifty yards; a\r\nnumber of old, castaway, and condemned vehicles lie where they were left\r\nafter their last use; mounds of rubbish and old brushwood, weeds, soiled\r\nclothing, farming tools, and implements of husbandry, are here and\r\nthere, uncared for, unnoticed, and neglected. The poultry, pigs, and\r\ncattle he possesses, wander about the door, at once front and rear, or,\r\nunobstructed by any serviceable fence, trespass upon the newly planted\r\nfield or unmown meadows, getting such living as fortune places in their\r\nway. The barn may be without doors, the barnyard without a gate or bars,\r\nand in full view from every passer by. The sty and the house drain--in\r\nfact, every necessary out-building--is in plain sight to the public, on\r\nthe sunny side of the house, or as near the front of it as is possible\r\nfor circumstances to permit. The airs of summer and of autumn come to\r\nthe delighted senses of the residents 'impregnated with the incense' of\r\nthese sweet surroundings, which, like Gray's unseen flower, are not\r\ndestined\r\n\r\n  'To waste their sweetness on the desert air.'\r\n\r\nAnd who are the delighted occupants of this charming spot? The external\r\nappearance and condition of things too sadly betray their character. The\r\nman is coarse and vulgar in speech and in manners; untidy, careless, and\r\nuncleanly in person and dress; ignorant, lazy, and perhaps intemperate,\r\nwith no thought beyond the gratification of his bodily wants and\r\ndesires. Slang words and obscene are his daily vocabulary; selfishness\r\nhis best-developed trait, and want the only incentive for his labor. His\r\npartner is like unto him, or worse, either by nature or association.\r\nWithout taste, modesty, good sense, or natural refinement, she\r\naccompanies her dear Silas in his round of life, sympathizing in his\r\nlowness, his common feeling, and his common complaints--slatternly in\r\nher dress, rude in speech, coarse in manner, slovenly in her household\r\nduties. These two creatures, with their children, too often call\r\nthemselves farmers, agriculturists, or tillers of the soil. The poet\r\nCowper well describes them in his poem representing 'the country boors'\r\ngathered together at tithing time at the residence of their country\r\nparson.\r\n\r\nThese thriftless people complain that they can make no money on their\r\nfarms, and but barely a living; and for the very good reason that the\r\nman or woman who attempts to carry on a farm in this way through the\r\nyear deserves no money or profit, nor barely a living from such a method\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nHe was born here. The new soil, at the time his father purchased it,\r\ngave him a living, and a good one, too; but this heir to the ancestral\r\nacres unfortunately married the slatternly daughter of a loafing\r\nneighbor, and their conservatism will not allow them to vary from the\r\ntrack of cultivation so well worn by his father, and forbids his\r\nlearning any other methods, or accepting any new ideas from any source,\r\nthough they may be sustained in the practical advantage gained thereby\r\nby the most successful farmers in his town, and may be learned any time\r\nfrom the Weekly agricultural gazette published at the capital of his\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBook farming he scouts. The books upon agriculture, which every good\r\nfarmer should read and study, and prove, will cost him perhaps ten\r\ndollars. By them his farm shall become his pride, his support, his\r\nwealth. But this dull man cannot, or will not, learn that in the\r\ndreaminess of his humdrum life, passed for thirty years or more upon his\r\nfarm, capital, industry, science, thought, and study have been at work,\r\nand everything has been done, thus far, which can be done to make the\r\nearth more gladsome, and the hearts of the children of men more thankful\r\nto the Giver and Bestower of all our blessings. Away, then, with this\r\ncant, prejudice, and sneering about 'book farming.' As well cry out\r\nagainst book geography, or book philosophy, or book history, or book\r\nlaw. Chemistry, botany, entomology, and pomology unite the results of\r\ntheir researches in their various directions, and, while seeking\r\napparently different ends, yet converge toward the grand centre of a\r\nsystematic and scientific agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis laggard has not yet learned that it is his business and duty to\r\ncultivate the earth, and not exhaust it; to get two blades of grass this\r\nyear where but one blade grew before; to gather thirty bushels of corn\r\nfrom the acre which produced but twenty bushels last year; to shear\r\nthree pounds of wool off the sheep which five years ago gave but two\r\npounds, and so on. He thinks to see how near the agricultural wind he\r\ncan move and his sails not shake, or with how little labor he can carry\r\nhis farm through the year and not starve. The poverty of the whole\r\nestablishment, man and wife, and children, and stock, their\r\nuncleanliness and unhealthfulness, are but the just results of such a\r\nmode of living. They have their deserts. 'Ye cannot gather grapes of\r\nthorns, nor figs of thistles.'\r\n\r\nThis illustration may seem exaggerated, the example too extreme. We\r\nwould that its semblance could not be seen in all wide America.\r\n\r\nWhat power, what influences, or what teachings will work the change in\r\nthe habits of life of those who thus pretend to cultivate the earth?\r\nWhat shall bring them to a clearer realization of their position, their\r\nduties, their opportunities, their prospects? This lethargy of\r\nignorance, indifference, and laziness must be shaken off and laid aside\r\nin the immediate future, by study and education, by active interest and\r\nparticipation in every discovery or invention which benefits\r\nagriculture; by the exercise of sound judgment in the choice of stock or\r\ncrops for the farm; by economy in the disposition of everything\r\navailable upon the estate which may be brought into profitable employ;\r\nby thrift in every operation which concerns the success of the vocation\r\nas tillers of the soil, and by temperance and frugality in the habits\r\nand character of the family living. 'Concentrate your labor, not\r\nscatter it; estimate duly the superior profit of a little farm well\r\ntilled, over a great farm half cultivated and half manured, overrun with\r\nweeds, and scourged with exhausting crops: so we shall fill our barns,\r\ndouble the winter fodder for our cattle and sheep, by the products of\r\nthese waste meadows. Thus shall our cultivation become like that of\r\nEngland, more systematic, scientific, and exact.'\r\n\r\nAn Englishman belies one of the best traits of his national character if\r\nhe denies himself all participation in rural life. It is a part of\r\ngreatness to seek a gratification of this innate longing for 'the\r\npursuit which is most conducive to virtue and happiness.' Edmund Burke,\r\nthe patriotic and most philosophical statesman of England, writing to a\r\nfriend in 1798, says:\r\n\r\n     'I have just made a push, with all I could collect of my own and\r\n     the aid of my friends, to cast a little root in the country. I have\r\n     purchased about six hundred acres of land in Buckinghamshire, about\r\n     twenty-four miles from London. It is a place exceedingly pleasant,\r\n     and I propose, God willing, to become a farmer in good earnest.'\r\n\r\nGreat skill, ingenuity, and success in cattle breeding, and in drainage,\r\nhave resulted, in England, from a long series of experiments, extending\r\nthrough many years; and great and wonderful progress in the discovery\r\nand analysis of soils and manures. The scientific men of France and\r\nGermany have also added much to this invaluable information of how to\r\nget more bread and meat from the earth, and do much, in their researches\r\nin the direction of pomology and entomology, to increase the\r\nagricultural knowledge of the world. America gladly tenders her most\r\ngracious homage to these devoted men, and hastens to add her leaf to the\r\nchaplet which binds their brow. It is to their persistent efforts, to\r\ntheir unshaken faith, that 'agriculture has become elevated to the\r\ndignity of a science.'\r\n\r\nThis vocation of farming in good earnest, with success and profit, is\r\nnot fun, but downright work. It is work, but no more persistent,\r\nconstant, studious, or thoughtful than that which is demanded by any of\r\nthe other callings in life, none of which has or can have such\r\ndelightful compensations as this. Careful experiments should be made in\r\nchemistry, analyzing thereby each germ, plant, flower, and fruit into\r\nits component parts; analyzing the soil of our farms, and learning\r\nthereby its various wants, its value, and what crop it will best\r\nsupport, and of which it will give the largest yield; teaching us what\r\nmanures are the most valuable, how prepared, and how to be used for the\r\ngreatest profit. Botany and entomology can unite their labors and\r\ndiscover the germs and development of our grasses, and the insects which\r\nfeed upon and destroy them; ornithology will teach us the habits of\r\nbirds, and their value to us as protectors of our gardens and fields;\r\nand pomology will instruct us in the culture of fruit. Thus shall\r\nscience and philosophy enlarge their duties and help the farmer in his\r\ndevotion to his noble work. The public press shall herald far and wide\r\neach new discovery, each new suggestion, and the results of each new\r\nexperiment, not in the technical language of the schools, but clothed in\r\nthe simplest vernacular, which alone can make such study valuable to\r\npractical men.\r\n\r\nHeretofore too much attention has been paid to the 'bread-producing\r\ncapacity' of our country, to the neglect of its as necessary\r\n'meat-producing capacity.' Hence much of our best bread-producing soil\r\nis becoming exhausted. The old tenants are leaving their once fertile\r\nfields, now poor in soil yielding comparatively nothing, and are\r\nemigrating to the West, beyond the banks of the Mississippi and Missouri\r\nrivers, trusting that the natural richness of the 'new hunting grounds'\r\nthey seek and find is inexhaustible. This policy has made barren most\r\nof the State of Virginia, and has begun to tell sadly, in the diminished\r\ncrops, upon the farming districts of Ohio, Indiana, and the other near\r\nWestern States.\r\n\r\nTo be the successful introducer in a new country of a new and improved\r\nbreed of cattle, requires capital, sound judgment, study, and patient\r\ntoil. Much must be considered with reference to the peculiarities of the\r\nsoil and climate, and of the animals, with regard to the object for\r\nwhich they are needed, whether the dairy, the plough, or the shambles.\r\nHappily, America is not without men whose wealth, intelligence, tastes,\r\nand sagacity have enabled them to perceive our present wants in this\r\nrespect, and who have assisted in preparing for them. The great wealth\r\nof these gentlemen has been well expended in the outlay and risk\r\nattending the extensive and valuable importations of the best breeding\r\ncattle and sheep which they have made into this country from time to\r\ntime from England and the continent of Europe. We are already reaping\r\nthe advantages of the presence of the valuable animals embraced in these\r\nnumerous importations. Scattered as they are throughout the country,\r\ninfusing the best blood of Europe's choicest stock into our 'natives,'\r\nthey so improve our cattle and sheep as to raise them to the highest\r\ndegree of excellence and value. It is a circumstance of which every\r\nAmerican may be proud, that Mr. Thorne has been so successful in\r\nbreeding, from his imported stock, cattle which he has sent to England,\r\nand which have there borne off the prize as the best breeders in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere are no indigenous breeds of either cattle or sheep in this\r\ncountry. The only animals of the bovine race found here when this\r\ncontinent was discovered were the buffalo and the musk ox. The 'natives'\r\nare a heterogenous mixture of various breeds, introduced from time to\r\ntime for different purposes, and allowed to cross and recross, breed\r\nin-and-in, and mingle as chance or convenience dictated. The cattle and\r\nsheep were procured at different times from the continent of Europe,\r\nfrom England, and the Spanish West Indies, to supply the present wants\r\nof labor and food. The first cattle brought here are said to have been\r\nintroduced by Columbus. The Spaniards afterward brought over others,\r\nfrom whence no doubt sprang the wild cattle of Texas and California.\r\nAbout the year 1553, the Portuguese took cattle to Newfoundland, of\r\nwhich, however, no traces now remain; and in the year 1600, Norman\r\ncattle were brought into Canada. In the year 1611, Sir Thomas Gates\r\nbrought from Devonshire and Hertfordshire one hundred head of cattle\r\ninto Jamestown; and thirteen years later, Thomas Winslow imported a bull\r\nand three heifers into Massachusetts. Thus was begun the importation of\r\ncattle for service and food into this country, which has continued to\r\nthis day, not always, however, with the just discrimination as to the\r\ngeographical and climatic peculiarities of the different animals which\r\nwas and is necessary for the highest success of the movement. Happily,\r\nthe various agricultural societies and publications, contributed to and\r\nsupported by our most intelligent farmers, are diffusing wider and\r\nwider, each year, more scientific and thorough notions upon this subject\r\nof breeding, among our agricultural citizens. An admirable and carefully\r\nwritten article upon 'Select Breeds of Cattle and their Adaptation to\r\nthe United States,' appeared in the United States Patent Office Report\r\nfor 1861, to which we would call our readers' attention. It should be\r\nstudied by every person interested in the economical prosperity of our\r\ncountry. It conveys, in a simple and perspicuous style, the results of\r\nthe various experiments in breeding, in both England and America, which\r\nlatterly have become so judicious and accurate as to be now almost based\r\nupon principle. Hereafter there will be no apology, but that of\r\nstupidity and ignorance, for the farmers who neglect the most obvious\r\nrules of success in their occupation. The idea, now become well known,\r\nmust become a fact with them, and they must raise no more poor horses or\r\ncattle or sheep, because it costs no more to raise good ones, which are\r\nmuch more profitable either for the dairy, for service, or for meat.\r\n\r\n'Animals are to be looked upon as machines for converting herbage into\r\nmoney,' says Daniel Webster. 'The great fact to be considered is, how\r\ncan we manage our farms so as to produce the largest crops, and still\r\nkeep up the condition of our land, and, if possible, place it in course\r\nof gradual improvement? The success must depend in a great degree upon\r\nthe animals raised and supported on the farm.'\r\n\r\nIt is auspicious for our country that the interest in sheep raising is\r\nbecoming wider and deeper. 'The value of wool imported into the United\r\nStates, in 1861 was nearly five millions of dollars. The value of\r\nimported manufactured woollen goods was more than twenty-eight millions\r\nof dollars, less by nearly ten millions of dollars than the importations\r\nof 1860. Taking the last three years as a basis of calculation, we have\r\nhad an annual importation of from thirty-five to forty-five millions of\r\npounds of manufactured and unmanufactured wool, being the product of\r\nthirteen millions of sheep.' The annual increase of population in the\r\nUnited States requires the wool from more than three million sheep.\r\nThere is an annual deficiency of wool of from forty to fifty millions of\r\npounds, so there need be no fear of glutting the market by our own\r\nproduction. The investigation might be extended much further. It remains\r\nfor the farmers and legislators to see to it that we receive no\r\ndetriment by the long continuance of this home demand without the home\r\nsupply. The instrument is in their own hands.\r\n\r\nOur farmers must teach their children the potential influence of\r\nkindness to dumb animals and to birds. By it they will conquer what of\r\nviciousness, ugliness, or wildness is often the character of their\r\nbeasts of burden; and they will find, by the almost total eradication of\r\nthe destructive flies and insects which are the scourge of their crops,\r\nthe value of the lives of birds and toads to their farms. Setting aside\r\nfor the present the consideration of the moral virtues which are thus\r\ninculcated, and which are so consistent with a proper devotion to this\r\n'benign art of peace,' we mention a few facts which carry the argument\r\nfor their worth in themselves.\r\n\r\nThe birds and toads devour insects, worms, and grubs, and wherever they\r\nare absent, grubs, worms, and insects are greatly multiplied, and the\r\ncrops suffer. The harvests of France, in 1861, suffered so by the\r\nravages of the insects which it is the function of certain birds to\r\ndestroy, that the subject attracted the notice of the Government, and a\r\ncommission was appointed to inquire into the matter and report what\r\nlegislation was expedient. The commission had the aid of the experience\r\nof the best naturalists of France, M. St. Hilaire, M. Prevost, and\r\nothers. Their preliminary report gives three classifications of birds:\r\nFirst, those which live exclusively upon insects and grubs; second,\r\nthose which live partly upon grubs and partly upon grain, doing some\r\ndamage, but providing an abundant compensation; third, the birds of\r\nprey, which are excepted from the category of benefactors, and are\r\npronounced to be noxious, inasmuch as they live mostly upon the smaller\r\nbirds. If the arrangements of nature were left wholly undisturbed, the\r\nresult would be a wholesome equilibrium of destruction. The birds would\r\nkill so many insects that the insects could not kill too many plants.\r\nOne class is a match for the other. A certain insect was found to lay\r\ntwo thousand eggs, but a single tomtit was found to eat two hundred\r\nthousand eggs a year. A swallow devours about five hundred insects a\r\nday, eggs and all. A sparrow's nest in the city of Paris was found to\r\ncontain seven hundred pairs of the upper wings of cockchafers. It is\r\neasy to see what an excess of insect life is produced when a\r\ncounterpoise like this is withdrawn; and the statistics collected show\r\nclearly to what an extent the balance of nature has been disturbed. Thus\r\nthe value of wheat destroyed in a single season, in one department of\r\nthe east of France, by the _cicidomigie_, has been estimated at eight\r\nhundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this is very soon told. The French eat the birds. The\r\ncommissioners, in their report, present some curious statistics\r\nrespecting the extent to which the destruction of birds in France has of\r\nlate been carried. They state 'that there are great numbers of\r\nprofessional huntsmen, who are accustomed to kill from one hundred to\r\ntwo hundred birds daily; a single child has been known to come home at\r\nnight with one hundred birds' eggs; and it is also calculated and\r\nreported that the number of birds' eggs destroyed annually in France is\r\nbetween eighty millions and one hundred millions. The result is that the\r\nsmall birds in that country are actually dying out; some species have\r\nalready disappeared, while others are rapidly diminishing.' These facts\r\ncontain valuable suggestions to our own countrymen. In this instance, as\r\nin many such like, observation is a better and more profitable master\r\nthan experience.\r\n\r\nOur farmers can increase the value of their estates, and bring pleasure\r\nand peace to their homes, by more special attention to the outward\r\nadornment of their dwellings; by cultivating a garden, planting orchards\r\nof the best selected fruit, and trees for shade, shelter, and ornament,\r\nabout their farms and along the adjoining highway. He who plants a tree,\r\nthereby gives hostages to life, but he who cuts one down needlessly, is\r\na Vandal, and deserves the execration of every honest man for all time.\r\nLearn not to value the bearded elm, 'the murmuring pines and the\r\nhemlocks,' the stalwart oak, or the beautiful maple, by cubic measure,\r\nbut by the 'height of the great argument' they force upon us by their\r\npresence, their beauty, and their power. Plant for to-day, and for your\r\nchildren; plant 'for another age,' and thereby do 'a good office' to the\r\ncoming generations of men. No man but is better for living in the\r\npresence of great trees. In one of those most delightful volumes of the\r\n_Spectator_, we find a paper, written by the pure and noble Joseph\r\nAddison, in which are well told the pleasures and profits of planting:\r\n'It must,' he says, 'be confessed that this is none of those turbulent\r\npleasures which are apt to gratify a man in the heats of youth; but if\r\nit be not so tumultuous, it is more lasting. Nothing can be more\r\ndelightful than to entertain ourselves with prospects of our own making,\r\nand to walk under those shades which our own industry has raised.\r\nAmusements of this nature compose the mind, and lay at rest all those\r\npassions which are uneasy to the soul of man, besides that they\r\nnaturally engender good thoughts, and dispose us to laudable\r\ncontemplations.'\r\n\r\nWhat charming associations linger about the homes of the great men of\r\nour history, whose tastes led them into the country! The grand old trees\r\nat 'Monticello,' at 'Ashland,' at 'Fort Hill,' at the 'Hermitage,' at\r\n'Sunnyside,' at Cooperstown, at Marshfield, at Mount Vernon, seem to\r\ntake upon themselves somewhat of 'the voice of the old hospitality'\r\nwhich graced their presence in the days that are passed; and the visitor\r\nnow wanders with emotions of awe and sadness, in paths by copses and\r\ngroves and streams, in those quiet retreats of nature, planted and\r\npreserved by the noble souls which loved them so wisely and so well.\r\n\r\nPlace the dwelling at a distance from the road, and in the position, if\r\npossible, from whence the best view of the whole farm can be obtained,\r\nmindful also of the charms which nature has spread before you, of\r\nmountain, or hill, or plain, or river, or sea. Plant the orchard on a\r\nslope toward the south, and not too far away. The barn and yard and\r\noutbuildings should be behind the house, or far enough away to protect\r\nthe inmates from any annoyance therefrom. Let the approach to the house\r\nbe by a long avenue, bordered by majestic trees, planted by your own\r\nhands. The lawn or garden should be well cared for in front. The\r\nbuildings should be painted or whitewashed, and over the house may\r\nclamber and beautify it the woodbine, the jessamine, the honeysuckle, or\r\nthe rose. What attachments to the homestead shall thus inweave\r\nthemselves about the hearts of those whose interests and life are cast\r\nwith it--and still more, of those who go forth from it, by taste,\r\ninclination, or bias, into the more bustling centres of competition and\r\ntrade!\r\n\r\nThe garden should receive a careful and generous attention from the\r\nfemale portion of the household. Says Lord Bacon: 'God Almighty first\r\nplanted a garden; and indeed it is the purest of human pleasures. It is\r\nthe greatest refreshment to the spirits of man; without which buildings\r\nand palaces are but gross handyworks; and a man shall ever see that when\r\nages grow to civility and elegance, men come to build stately sooner\r\nthan to garden finely; as if gardening were the greater perfection. I do\r\nhold it in the royal ordering of gardens, there ought to be gardens for\r\nall the months in the year; in which severally things of beauty may be\r\nthere in season.'\r\n\r\nFollowing Lord Bacon's advice, let there be such a plan and arrangement\r\nof it, that it shall always be attractive, and yield a continual round\r\nof beauty through the year. Thus planted, the garden 'will inspire the\r\npurest and most refined pleasures, and cannot fail to promote every good\r\naffection.'\r\n\r\nWith all the advantages which the discoveries of natural science offer\r\nto the farmer of this century, it will little avail his successors\r\nunless he strives to educate his children. It is a very mistaken and\r\nlamentable notion--now, alas! too prevalent--that a liberal education is\r\nnecessary alone to those who intend to enter upon a professional life.\r\nMay the time be not far distant when farming may become a profession\r\nwhich takes its rank with the rest, if it does not lead them, in the\r\npublic opinion. It was first supposed, very singularly, that the clergy\r\nought only to be favored with an education in science and the classics;\r\nafterward the legal profession arose to sufficient dignity for it; and\r\nfinally the physician, the guardian of our health, the student and\r\nphilosopher of our bodies, arose to his noble position in the affairs of\r\nthis life; while the agriculturist, the supporter of all we have or wish\r\nfor here, the basis of our very civilization, is pushed aside or\r\nforgotten, and the demand upon him for the best culture of the earth\r\naltogether neglected. We have to congratulate ourselves that our\r\nGovernment has left it with each State by itself, whether, by the\r\nnon-acceptance of its gift of public land as foundations for\r\nagricultural colleges, they will longer forego the opportunity of giving\r\nour young farmers a thorough scientific agricultural education. Until\r\nsuch a system of study can be arranged, let the farmers themselves\r\ncommence the work of self-education. Agricultural societies and farmers'\r\nclubs, in which are gathered together the best farmers of the States,\r\noffer the best opportunity for intercommunication, thorough discussion\r\nand observation, and dissemination of all new discoveries, facts, or\r\ntheories which may be made beneficial to all. These are the only means\r\nby which farmers can compare opinions and found sound judgments for\r\ntheir future labors. What would be the financial condition of the other\r\ngreat economical interests, if merchants and owners never consulted\r\ntogether, nor marked the course and policy for their mutual guidance?\r\nThe best agricultural papers and magazines which favor each farmer's\r\npeculiar interest, whether of stock, or fruit, or dairy, or grain,\r\nshould be subscribed for and read, and preserved for future reference.\r\nOur best farmers can do a great deal, by contributing facts of their own\r\nknowledge, to raise the standard and worth of such periodicals. It only\r\nneeds the feeling of personal interest in this matter to procure for\r\neach farmer whatever books are necessary to a perfect understanding of\r\nhis special work. They must soon learn that the education of their\r\nchildren is the best investment they can make of the value of their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThey should be taught, by example, by reading, and observation, the\r\ngeneral success in life of those who plant and water and reap; and the\r\ngeneral failure of those who attempt to gain an early or a late fortune\r\nin money by entering the marts of more active and more crowded\r\ncompetition. Most men fail to make the fortunes which the dreams of\r\nyouth placed before them in such brilliant colors. In the present\r\ncondition of the various professions, except farming, they only succeed\r\nwhom fortune favors by special mental gifts or special personal\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\nThe peace, quiet, and contentment of a cheerful home; the charms of\r\nnature, free, unobstructed, lovely; the generous bestowal of an\r\n'unostentatious hospitality;' the patient spirit of him who waits upon\r\nthe accustomed return of the seasons; the attachment, the joy and\r\npleasure of looking upon the broad acres, the shaded walks, the\r\nbeautiful landscape, planted, improved, and protected by his own hand;\r\nthe herds of favorite cattle and sheep which love his coming, the kindly\r\ntones of his voice, the gentle stroke of his hand; the respect paid by\r\nfriends and neighbors to the venerable man who waits only the\r\ntermination of a virtuous life; the faith in 'the sacred covenant, that\r\nwhile the earth remaineth, sunshine and shower, summer and winter,\r\nseed-time and harvest shall not fail,' are his who lives through long\r\nyears devoted to this, rightly followed, noblest of all\r\noccupations--farming.\r\n\r\n'He that goeth forth in humility, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless\r\ncome again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.\r\n\r\nNO. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nInnovations in religion are very commonly deprecated; but there is one\r\nin practice which might very safely be attempted, i.e., to _obey_ the\r\ngospel. This has been seldom done, even among those that bear the\r\nChristian name. How few, even among the members of churches, do really\r\nmould their lives from day to day by the teachings of our Lord and his\r\ndisciples!\r\n\r\nThis same thought may be presented in another form. Let us remark, then,\r\nthat while the true teachings of religion are found in the Bible, yet a\r\nnew edition of them seems wanted, viz., the actual obedience of those\r\nthat adopt them as their creed and rule of life. To make these doctrines\r\nmanifest in the lives of any considerable number among men, would give\r\nthem a power such as they have rarely had.\r\n\r\nWe have had a great many translations of the Holy Scriptures; the best\r\nof all would be their translation into the daily practice of Christian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD AZALEA.\r\n\r\nA MEMORY OF THE HIGHLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Up on the hills where the young trees grow,\r\n  Looking down on the fields below--\r\n  Long-leaved chestnuts and maples low;\r\n  Up where lingereth late the sun,\r\n  When the soft spring day is nearly done,\r\n    Dying away in the west;\r\n  Up where the poplar's silver stem\r\n  Bends by the marsh's grass-fringed hem,\r\n    By the soft May wind caressed;\r\n\r\n  Up where the long, slim shadows fall\r\n  From the scarlet oak and the pepperidge tall,\r\n  Where the birds and the squirrels tirelessly call,\r\n  Where in autumn the flowers of the gentian blue\r\n  Look up with their eyes so dark and true,\r\n    Up into the hazy sky,\r\n  Dreaming away as the red leaves drop,\r\n  And the acorn falls from its deep brown cup,\r\n    And the yellow leaves float by;\r\n\r\n  Up where the violets, white and blue,\r\n  Bloom in sunshine and the dew,\r\n  Tenderly living their still life through,\r\n  Where the deep-cut leaves of the liverwort grow,\r\n  And the great white flowers of the dogwood blow\r\n    Over the pale anemones;--\r\n  Cometh a perfume spicily shed\r\n  From the wild Azalea's full-wreathed head\r\n    Lifted among the trees.\r\n\r\n  There where the sun-flecked shadows lie,\r\n  Quivering light as the breeze laughs by,\r\n  And the leaves all dance 'neath the soft spring sky;\r\n  Blossoming bright when the twigs grow green,\r\n  And the sunlight falls with a tenderer sheen\r\n    Than comes with the summer noon,\r\n  Blossoming bright where the laurel gleams,\r\n  Lifting its sculptured flowers to the beams\r\n    Of the warm, glad sun of June.\r\n\r\n  And so it smiles to itself all day,\r\n  Where it stands alone by the mountain way,\r\n  Hearing the merry young leaves at play;\r\n  And soft on the stones its smile is cast,\r\n  And it laughs with the wind as it saunters past,\r\n    The fresh, young wind of May:\r\n  And happily thus it lives its life\r\n  Till the woods with sounds of summer are rife,\r\n    When it silently passes away.\r\n\r\n  And once again to the hills we go,\r\n  When the sun shines warm on the fields below\r\n  Where the midsummer lilies are all aglow,\r\n  When shadows are thicker, and scarcely the breeze\r\n  Stirs a leaf on the gleaming poplar trees,\r\n    And low are the streamlet's tones;\r\n  For the bright Azalea we look in vain,\r\n  And long for its smile to gladden again\r\n    Our hearts and the old gray stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAIR OF STOCKINGS.\r\n\r\nFROM THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate was sitting by the window. I was sitting beside her. It may be well\r\nto state here that Kate was a young lady, and that I am a young\r\ngentleman. Kate had large, lustrous dark eyes, which just then were\r\ncovered with fringed, drooping eyelashes. She had braids of dark hair\r\nwreathed around her head, a soft pink color in her cheeks, and a rosebud\r\nmouth, womanly, fresh, and lovely. Kate was clad in a pink muslin dress,\r\nwith a tiny white ruffle around her white throat. She was armed with\r\nfour steely needles, which were so many bright arrows that pierced my\r\nheart through and through. Over her fingers glided a small blue thread,\r\nwhich proceeded from the ball of yarn I held in my hand.\r\n\r\nKate was knitting a stocking, and surely, irrevocably she was taking me\r\ncaptive; already I felt myself entangled by those small threads.\r\n\r\nWe were the inmates of a boarding house. Kate was a new boarder. I had\r\nknown her but a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe evening was warm, and I took up a palm-leaf fan, and fanned her. She\r\nthanked me. I looked at her white hands, gliding in and out under the\r\nblue yarn; there were no rings on those fingers. I thought how nicely\r\none would look upon that ring finger--a tiny gold circlet, with two\r\nhearts joined upon it, and on the inside two names written--hers and\r\nmine. Then I thought of Kate as my wife, always clad in a pink muslin\r\ndress, always with her hair in just such glossy braids, and knitting\r\nstockings to the end of time.\r\n\r\n'Kate shall be my wife,' I said to myself, in rash pride, as I fanned\r\nher more energetically. I did not know that the way to a woman's heart\r\nwas more intricate than a labyrinth; but I had the clue in the blue yarn\r\nwhich I held in my hand. I little knew what I undertook. Kate was shy as\r\na wild deer, timid as a fawn, with an atmosphere of reserve about her\r\nwhich one could not well break through.\r\n\r\n'For whom are you knitting those stockings, Miss Kate?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'For a soldier, Mr. Armstrong,' she replied, her eye kindling with\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\n'If I will be one of the Home Guards, and stay and take care of you,\r\nwill you knit me a pair?'\r\n\r\n'Never. I feel abundantly able to take care of myself. I wish you would\r\nenlist, Mr. Armstrong. When you do, I will knit you a pair.'\r\n\r\n'It would be almost worth the sacrifice,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Sacrifice! Would you sacrifice yourself for a pair of stockings? Have\r\nyou not patriotism enough to offer yourself upon the altar of your\r\ncountry? If I were a man, I would enlist in a moment, though I had ten\r\nthousand a year, and a wife and seven children.'\r\n\r\nI will confess to you, gentle reader, that I was not such a craven as I\r\nappeared. The fires of patriotism were smouldering in my bosom, and I\r\nneeded only a spark from Kate's hand to light them into life and action.\r\nKate rose and left the room, her cheek glowing with spirit, and I sat\r\nand fanned the chair where she had sat, for a few moments. It was too\r\nbad to break up the delicious _tete-a-tete_ so soon.\r\n\r\nI lingered in the parlor after the gas was lighted, but she did not\r\ncome. I put on my hat, and went out. I would enlist. I had meant to do\r\nso all along. I had managed my business in reference to it--the only\r\ndrawback was the thought of Kate. How pleasant it would be to remind her\r\nof her promise, and ask her for the stockings and herself with them!\r\nVisions of tender partings and interesting letters floated around me at\r\nthe thought.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting in Tremont Temple in aid of recruiting. Flags hung\r\ndrooping from the ceiling, bands of music were in attendance in the\r\ngalleries, and distinguished and eloquent speakers occupied the\r\nplatform. I do not think their eloquence had much to do with my action,\r\nfor I had resolved beforehand. I went forward at the close of the\r\nmeeting, and signed my name to the roll as a Massachusetts volunteer. A\r\npair of hands in the gallery began the thunder of applause that greeted\r\nthe act. I looked up; Kate was there, clapping enthusiastically. But who\r\nwas that tall fellow in uniform by her side, with a tremendous mustache,\r\nand eyes which flashed brighter than her own? He, then, was the soldier\r\nfor whom she was knitting the stockings. The rest of the meeting was a\r\nblank to me.\r\n\r\nI watched, and followed them to the door of the boarding house. I hid\r\nmyself behind a lamp post, as they paused on the steps. She turned\r\ntoward him, her face all aglow with feeling.\r\n\r\n'Good by, Frank. Take good care of yourself. I'm glad to have you\r\nenlist, but so sorry to lose you,' and tears trembled in her eyes.\r\n\r\n'Good by, Kate, darling; and after the war is over, I will come home and\r\ntake care of my bird,' and he turned away.\r\n\r\n'Stop Frank!'\r\n\r\n'Well, birdie?'\r\n\r\n'Those are not fit words to dismiss a soldier with. Here, I'll give you\r\na watchword. Think of it, Frank:\r\n\r\n\"Never give up! though the grapeshot may rattle\r\n  Or the thick thunder cloud over you burst,\r\nStand like a rock! in the storm or the battle,\r\n  Little shall harm you, though doing their worst!\"\r\n\r\n'Brave words, Kate. You deserve a kiss for them.' It was given. I turned\r\naway in desperation, and walked onward, not caring where I went.\r\nPolicemen watched me, but the lateness of the hour made no difference to\r\nme. I could have walked all night. At length I came to a bridge. The\r\nmoon was shining upon the rippling water. It looked cold and dark,\r\nexcept where the ripples were. There would be a plunge, and then the\r\nwater would flow on over my head. Why not? I did not know I had loved\r\nher with such devotion. It was all over now. She belonged to another. My\r\nfoot was on the rail. I thought then of the name I had signed to the\r\nroll. 'No, Jacob Armstrong, you have no right to take the life which\r\nyou have given to your country.' I turned away toward my boarding place,\r\nfull of bitterness and despair. A tiny glove was on the stairs. I picked\r\nit up and pressed it passionately to my lips, and cursed myself for the\r\nact as I threw it down again.\r\n\r\nThe days that followed were weary enough. I made arrangements for my\r\ndeparture with all possible speed. I avoided Kate, and was cold and\r\nhaughty in my salutations. I am very dignified naturally. I can be an\r\niceberg in human shape when I wish. One evening I went into the parlor\r\nbefore tea, and took up a newspaper. Kate came in. I put on my dignity,\r\nand tried to be interested in politics, though I could think of nothing\r\nbut the dainty figure opposite, and the gleaming needles in her hands. I\r\nstruggled with the passionate, bitter feelings that rose at the sight of\r\nher, and was calm and cold.\r\n\r\n'I am glad you have enlisted, Mr. Armstrong, she said.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' I replied stiffly.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you are very busy making preparations?'\r\n\r\n'Very.'\r\n\r\n'And you are going soon?'\r\n\r\n'I hope so.'\r\n\r\nKate left the room. I wished she was back again a thousand times. How\r\nkind and shy she looked. If there was a gleam of hope--that tall fellow\r\nin uniform--no, she might stay away forever. And yet my heart gave a\r\ngreat leap as she appeared again.\r\n\r\n'I want to show you a photograph, Mr. Armstrong,' she said, blushing and\r\nsmiling. I took it. It was the officer in uniform, with the tremendous\r\nmustache and flashing eyes.\r\n\r\n'It is my brother Frank. Does he look like me?'\r\n\r\nI started as if I had been shot.\r\n\r\n'Miss Kate, I want to take a walk now, and I should like some company.\r\nWill you go with me?'\r\n\r\n'Hadn't we better have tea first?' she said, smiling. 'The bell has just\r\nrung.'\r\n\r\nI do not know how that tea passed off, whether we had jumbles or\r\nmuffins, whether I drank tea or cold water; but I knew that opposite me\r\nsat Kate, radiant in pink muslin, and when the interminable tea was\r\nover, we were going to take a walk together. I was thinking what I\r\nshould say. I am generally a sociable and genial man, and it seems to me\r\nthat on this particular evening I was assaulted with a storm of\r\nquestions and remarks.\r\n\r\n'Don't you think so, Mr. Armstrong?' asked the lady on my right, the\r\nlady on my left, and the gentleman in black at the end of the table. I\r\naimed monosyllables at them promiscuously, and have at present no means\r\nof knowing whether they fitted the questions and remarks or not.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a mental speech, I was vigorously assaulted by Mary, the\r\ntable girl, and, looking about me in surprise, I caught a glimpse of the\r\nboardinghouse cat just disappearing through the door:\r\n\r\n'And sure, Mr. Armstrong, yer must be blind. The blow was intended for\r\nthe cat, and she had her paw in yer plate.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps you do not know how pleasant it is to take a walk with a little\r\ngloved hand resting upon your arm, little feet keeping step with yours,\r\nand a soft voice chiming in with everything you say. I was happy on that\r\nparticular night. We walked on the Common. The stars shone, and the long\r\nbranches of the old elms swayed to and fro in the moonlight, as we\r\npassed under them. It was just the time and place that I liked.\r\n\r\n'Miss Kate,' I began, 'in a few days I shall be far away from home and\r\nfriends, amid danger and death, fighting the battles of my country. I\r\nhave known you but a short time; but that time has been long enough to\r\nshow me that I love you with my whole soul. I offer my hand and heart to\r\nyou. May I not hope that you will sometimes think of the soldier--that\r\nI may carry your heart with me?'\r\n\r\n'I think you may hope,' she replied, gently; 'but this is very sudden. I\r\nwill give you a final answer to-morrow morning.'\r\n\r\nWhen we got home, we went into the dining room, and I helped her to a\r\nglass of ice water, and hoped she would linger there a moment; but she\r\nwas shy, and bade me a kind good night. I didn't know till the next\r\nmorning what she was about the rest of the evening; when she met me on\r\nthe stairs, placed a small parcel in my hands, saying:\r\n\r\n'My answer, Mr. Armstrong,' and was off like a fawn.\r\n\r\nI opened it, and saw the stockings, blue, and warm and soft. A note was\r\nstitched in the toe of one of them:\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND: I said I was knitting the stockings for a soldier.\r\n     I began them, with a patriotic impulse, for no one in particular. I\r\n     finished them last night, and knit loving thoughts of you in with\r\n     every stitch, I have always liked you, but I do not think I should\r\n     have given you my hand if you had not enlisted. I love you, but I\r\n     love my country more. I give you the stockings. When you wear them,\r\n     I hope you will sometimes think of her who fashioned them, and who\r\n     gives herself to you with them. Yours, KATE.\r\n\r\nI reverently folded the tiny note, after having committed it to memory,\r\nand repeated its contents to myself all the way to my office, beginning\r\nwith 'Mr. Armstrong,' and ending with 'Yours, Kate.' I was in a state of\r\nextreme beatification. Kate was mine, noble girl! She loved me, and yet\r\nwas willing to give me up for her country's cause. And I began to repeat\r\nthe note to myself again, when, on a crossing, I was accosted by a\r\nbiped, commonly known as a small boy:\r\n\r\n'Mister, yer stocking is sticking out of yer pocket.'\r\n\r\nI turned calmly around, and addressed him:\r\n\r\n'Boy, I glory in those stockings. I am willing that the universe should\r\nbehold them. My destiny is interwoven with them. Every stitch is\r\ninstinct with life and love.'\r\n\r\n'Don't see it, mister! Glory, hallelujah!' and he ended his speech by\r\nmaking an exclamation point of himself, by standing on his head--a very\r\nbad practice for small boys. I advise all precocious youngsters, who may\r\nread this article, to avoid such positions.\r\n\r\nWe broke camp, and started off in high spirits. I paraded through the\r\nstreets with a bouquet of rosebuds on my bayonet. I found a note among\r\nthem afterward, more fragrant than they.\r\n\r\nWhen our regiment left Boston, it went from Battery Wharf. I went on\r\nboard the Merrimac. Kate could not pass the lines, and stationed herself\r\nin a vessel opposite, where we could look at each other. I aimed a\r\nrosebud at her; it fell into the green water, and floated away. The\r\nsecond and third were more successful. She pressed one to her lips and\r\nthrew it back again; the other she kept. Afterward, with the practical\r\nforethought which forms a part of her character, she bought out an apple\r\nwoman, and stormed me with apples. The vessel left the wharf, and I\r\nlooked back with eyes fast growing dim, and watched the figure on the\r\ndock, bravely waving her white handkerchief as long as I could see.\r\n\r\nWell, it is hard for a man to leave home and friends, and all that he\r\nholds dear; but I do not regret it, though I have to rough it now. I am\r\nwriting now beside a bivouac made of poles and cornstalks. My desk is a\r\nrude bench. I have just finished my dinner of salt junk and potatoes. On\r\nmy feet is that pair of stockings. Profanity and almost every vice\r\nabounds; there are temptations all around me, but pure lips have\r\npromised to pray for me, and I feel that I shall be shielded and\r\nguarded, and kept uncontaminated, true to my 'north star,' which shines\r\nso brightly to me--true to my country and my God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SORDELLO, STRAFFORD, CHRISTMAS EVE, AND EASTER DAY. By ROBERT\r\n     BROWNING. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this volume, though now first presented to the American\r\npublic, are not the latest of the author's writings. It completes,\r\nhowever, Messrs. Ticknor & Fields' reprint of his poetical works. His\r\ngrowing popularity calls for the present publication. We would fain\r\nnumber ourselves among the admirers of the husband of Elizabeth Barrett;\r\nthe man loved by this truly great poetess, to whom she addressed the\r\nrefined and imaginative tenderness of the 'Portuguese Sonnets?' of whom\r\nshe writes:\r\n\r\n'Or from Browning some 'Pomegranate,' which, if cut deep down the\r\nmiddle, shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity.'\r\n\r\nBefore the man so loved and honored, we repeat, we would fain bow in\r\nreverence. But it may not be; we cannot receive him as a _true_ poet--as\r\nin any poetic quality the peer of his matchless wife. We hear much of\r\nhis subtile psychology--we deem it psychological unintelligibility. His\r\nrhythm is rough and unmusical, his style harsh and inverted, his imagery\r\ncold, his invective bitter, and his verbiage immense. His illustrations\r\nare sometimes coarse, his comparisons diminish rather than increase the\r\nimportance of the ideas to which they are applied. His pages are\r\nfrequently as chaotic as those of Wagner's music; leaf after leaf may be\r\nturned over in the despairing search for a single crystallized idea.\r\nFiery sparks, flying meteors, inchoate masses of nebulous matter are\r\naround us, but no glass in our possession can resolve them into ordered\r\norbs of thought and beauty. If a man have anything to say, why not say\r\nit in clear, terse, vigorous English, or why use worlds of vigorous\r\nwords to say nothing. Some years ago, one of Browning's books was sent\r\nfor review to Douglas Jerrold, who was then just recovering from an\r\nattack of brain fever: after reading it for some time, and finding that\r\nhe failed to arrive at any clear idea of the meaning of its lines, he\r\nbegan to fear that his brain was again becoming confused, and, handing\r\nit to his wife with a request that she would look over it in his\r\nabsence, went out to drive. Returning in the evening, his first question\r\nwas: 'Well, my dear, what do you think of Browning's poem?' 'Bother the\r\ngibberish,' was her indignant reply, 'I can't understand a word of it.'\r\n'Thank God,' exclaimed Jerrold, clapping his hands to his head\r\ntriumphantly, 'then I am not actually insane.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     DALETH; OR, THE HOMESTEAD OF THE NATIONS. Egypt Illustrated. By\r\n     EDWARD L. CLARK. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n\r\nA book produced without regard to expense, and of great beauty. Paper\r\nand print are excellent. Its illustrations are nearly one hundred in\r\nnumber. It has both woodcuts and chromo-lithographs exquisitely\r\nrendered, reproducing the modern scenery and antiquities of Egypt from\r\nphotographs or authentic sources. Mr. Clark writes well, has travelled\r\nthrough the land of the Nile, and tries to bring before the minds of his\r\nreaders vivid pictures of primeval times, for which Egypt presents such\r\npeculiar and valuable materials. Our writer is a scholar as well as a\r\ntraveller, and has added to his personal experience considerable\r\nresearch into the authorities from whom many of his facts are derived.\r\nHe is also an enthusiast, and somewhat of an artist, and gives us\r\nglowing pictures of the strange old land of the Pharaohs. He says:\r\n'Daleth, the ancient Hebrew letter ([Hebrew: **-j]), signifies a door.\r\nFrom whatever country we look back along the pathway of the arts and\r\nsciences, in the dim distance tower the mighty gateways of Egypt--the\r\nhomestead of the nations--beneath which the rites of religion and the\r\nblessings of civilization have passed out into the world; and with\r\ngrateful respect we confess that on the banks of the Nile stands the\r\ntrue Daleth of the Nations.' This idea forms the clew to the whole book,\r\nand from hence is derived its title, Daleth. We heartily recommend it to\r\nour readers. It merits attention. We quote the last sentence of the\r\nshort preface: 'That these fragments of the past may reflect for the\r\nreader the sunshine they have gathered in three thousand years, is the\r\nearnest wish of the author.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES, SONGS, SERVICES, AND SPEECHES OF PRIVATE\r\n     MILES O'REILLY (47th Regiment, New York Volunteers). \"The Post of\r\n     Honor is the Private's Station.\" With Illustrations by Mullen. From\r\n     the authentic records of the New York _Herald_. New York: Carleton,\r\n     publisher, 413 Broadway.\r\n\r\nThis book had established its reputation before it was issued in book\r\nform; and will be widely circulated. Our soldiers and sailors, our\r\npoliticians of all parties will read it. It is evidently from the pen of\r\none familiar with the varied phases of American life and the public\r\nservice. Many of its songs are full of genuine humor. 'Sambo's Right to\r\nbe Kilt' is excellent. 'The Review: A Picture of our Veterans,' is full\r\nof pathos. 'Miles' is familiar with Admiral DuPont and the monitors in\r\nfront of Charleston, and is equally at home in Tammany Hall and\r\nDemocratic Conventions. The publisher describes himself as unable to\r\nsupply the rapid demand for the book. It is witty, satirical, and\r\nhumorous; though we occasionally wish for somewhat more refinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ELIZA WOODSON; OR, THE EARLY DAYS OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S WORKERS. A\r\n     Story of American Life. A. J. Davis & Co., 274 Canal street, New\r\n     York.\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell our readers, with any degree of certainty, whether the\r\ntale before us is truth or fiction. It seems to be the simple history of\r\nan uneventful life, a record rather of the growth of character than an\r\nattempt to create the fictitious or tragical. If true it has the\r\ninterest of fiction; if fictitious, it has the merit of concealing art\r\nand closely imitating nature. It contains the inner-life history of a\r\ndeserted and much-abused little girl, from childhood to maturity. It is\r\ndetailed, moral, conscientious, and interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BABBLE BROOK SONGS. By J. H. MCNAUGHTON. Boston: Oliver Ditson &\r\n     Co.\r\n\r\nA volume of original songs and poems. That it comes from the University\r\nPress is sufficient guarantee of its superb typography. Of these lyrics\r\nwe prefer 'Without the Children.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     RUBINA. New York: James G. Gregory, 46 Walker street.\r\n\r\nA close and detailed picture of New England life and character. The poor\r\nyoung orphans have a dismal time of it among their hard and coarse\r\nrelatives. The sterner forms of Puritanism are well depicted. The scene\r\nat the funeral of poor Demis, with its harrowing and denunciatory sermon\r\nover the corpse of the innocent girl, is powerful and true. The\r\ncharacter of the 'help,' Debby, is drawn from life, and is admirably\r\nconceived and sustained. The book is, however, melancholy and\r\nmonotonous. So many young and generous hearts beating themselves forever\r\nagainst the sharp stones of the baldest utilitarianism; so many bright\r\nminds drifting into despair in the surrounding chaos of obstinate,\r\nstolid, and perverse ignorance! It is a sadder book than 'The Mill on\r\nthe Floss,' of which it reminds us. How the aspiring and imaginative\r\nmust suffer in an atmosphere so cold and blighting!\r\n\r\n\r\n     COUNSEL AND COMFORT: Spoken from a City Pulpit. By the Author of\r\n     'The Recreations of a Country Parson.' Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n     1864.\r\n\r\nA book truly of good counsel and cheerful comfort. The strong\r\npersonality of the writer sometimes interferes with the expansiveness of\r\nhis views, as for instance in the discussion on pulpits; but it may\r\nperhaps be to that very strength of personality that we owe the force\r\nand directness of the lessons he so encouragingly inculcates.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A WOMAN'S RANSOM. by FREDERICK WILLIAM ROBINSON, Author of\r\n     'Grandmother's Money,' 'Under the Spell,' 'Wild Flower,' 'Slaves of\r\n     the Ring,' 'The House of Life,' etc. Boston: Published by T. O. H.\r\n     P. Burnham. New York: H. Dexter Hamilton & Co., Oliver S. Felt.\r\n\r\nThis work is published from advance sheets purchased from the English\r\npublisher. It is an excellent novel, full of incident and interest. The\r\nplot is artistic, and fascinates the reader to the end. The element of\r\nmystery is skilfully managed, increasing until the final _denoument_,\r\nwhich is original and unexpected. We commend it to the attention of the\r\nlovers of fascinating fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INDUSTRIAL BIOGRAPHY: IRON WORKERS AND TOOL MAKERS. By SAMUEL\r\n     SMILES, Author of 'Self-Help,' 'Brief Biographies,' and 'Life of\r\n     George Stephenson.' 'The true Epic of our time, is not _Arms_ but,\r\n     _Tools_ and _Man_--an infinitely wider kind of Epic.' Boston:\r\n     Ticknor & Fields.\r\n\r\nThis book may be considered as a continuation of the Series of Memoirs\r\nof Industrial Men introduced in Mr. Smiles's 'Lives of Engineers.' The\r\nauthor says that 'while commemorating the names of those who have\r\nstriven--to elevate man above the material and mechanical, the labors of\r\nthe important industrial class, to whom society owes so much of its\r\ncomfort and well-being, are also entitled to consideration. Without\r\nderogating from the biographic claims of those who minister to intellect\r\nand taste, those who minister to utility need not be overlooked.'\r\n\r\nSurely the object of this book is a good one. The mechanic should\r\nreceive his meed of appreciation. Our constructive heroes should not be\r\nforgotten, for the heroism of inventive labor has its own romance, and\r\nits results aid greatly the cause of human advancement. Most of the\r\ninformation embodied in this volume has heretofore existed only in the\r\nmemories of the eminent mechanical engineers from whom it has been\r\ncollected. Facts are here placed on record which would, in the ordinary\r\ncourse of things, have passed into oblivion. All honor to the brave,\r\npatient, ingenious, and inventive mechanic!\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE WIFE'S SECRET. By MRS. ANN S. STEPHENS, Author of 'The Rejected\r\n     Wife,' 'Fashion and Famine,' 'Tho Old Homestead,' 'Mary Derwent,'\r\n     etc., etc. Philadelphia: T. B. Peterson & Brothers, 306 Chestnut\r\n     street.\r\n\r\nMRS. STEPHENS has considerable ability in the construction of her plots\r\nand their gradual development. Her stories are always interesting. The\r\nwife's secret is well kept, and the _denoument_ admirably managed. The\r\nfatal want of moral courage, the suffering caused by mental weakness,\r\nthe strength of love, the sustaining power of intellect, are portrayed\r\nwith ability in the book before us. The moral is unexceptionable\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE VEIL PARTLY LIFTED, AND JESUS BECOMING VISIBLE. By W. H.\r\n     FURNESS, Author of 'Remarks on the Four Gospels,' 'Jesus and His\r\n     Biographers,' 'A History of Jesus,' and 'Thoughts on the Life and\r\n     Character of Jesus of Nazareth.' Boston: Ticknor & Fields. For sale\r\n     by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nInvestigations into the life and character of Christ Jesus are\r\neverywhere multiplying around us. Attempts to account for the marvels of\r\nHis glorious Being on a simply natural plane are made in apparent good\r\nfaith, and with considerable ability. Mr. Furness approaches his subject\r\nwith reverence: he has studied the man, Jesus, with his heart. The human\r\nphases of His marvellous character are elaborated with skill and\r\npatience. He regards Christianity as a 'natural product, a product\r\nrealized, not against, or aside from, but in the established order of\r\nthings; that were we competent to pronounce upon the purposes of the\r\nInfinite Mind, which we are not, we might say that, so far from His\r\nbeing out of the course of nature, nature culminated in Christ, and\r\nthat, of all that exists, He is the one being profoundly human,\r\npreeminently natural.' In the dove which descended at His baptism, Mr.\r\nFurness 'discovers the presence of a common dove divested of its\r\nordinary appearance, and transfigured by a rapt imagination into a sign\r\nand messenger from heaven.' He says 'there is no intrinsic impossibility\r\nin supposing that Jesus was naturally possessed of an unprecedented\r\npower of will, by which the extraordinary effects attributed to him were\r\nproduced.' 'The bloody sweat is an evident fiction--how could blood have\r\nbeen distinguished in the dark?' He pronounces the story of 'the wise\r\nmen from the east an evident fable.' Mr. Furness puts no faith in the\r\nmiraculous conception, but believes in the resurrection. He says: 'Bound\r\nby irresistible evidence to believe that Jesus was again alive on that\r\nmemorable morning, I believe it will hereafter appear that He came to\r\nlife through the extraordinary _force of will_ with which He was\r\nendowed, and by which He healed the sick and raised the dead; or, in\r\nother words, that consciousness returned to Him by an action of the\r\nmind, in itself no more inscrutable in this case than it is in our\r\ndaily waking from sleep.'\r\n\r\nWe deem that there is more difficulty in admitting that Christ rose from\r\nthe dead by _extraordinary force of will_, than in admitting the truth\r\nof the record that He was the only Son of the Father, with full power\r\nover life and death. We thank Mr. Furness for the skilful manner in\r\nwhich he has brought to light the infinite tenderness and divine\r\nself-forgetfulness of the Redeemer, but we cannot think he has succeeded\r\nin lifting the veil of mystery which surrounds the birth, miracles,\r\ncrucifixion, resurrection, and atonement of the Redeemer. Meantime let\r\nChristians who accept revelation in its integrity, throw no stumbling\r\nblocks in the way of earnest and candid inquirers, such as Mr. Furness.\r\nIs it not true that, dazzled by the _Divine_, we have been too little\r\ntouched by the exquisite, compassionate, faithful, and child-like\r\n_human_ character of our Master? Truth seeks the light, and it cannot\r\nfall too fully on the perfect; every ray serving but to reveal some new\r\nperfection. Let those of fuller faith rejoice in the beauties forever\r\ndeveloping in the character of the Holy Victim. Let them patiently pray\r\nthat those who love Him as an elder brother, may gaze upon His majesty\r\nuntil they see in Him the risen God.\r\n\r\nWe have found this book interesting and suggestive. It is disgraced by\r\nnone of the flippant and irreverent sentimentalism which characterizes\r\nM. Renan.\r\n\r\nContents: 'Wherein the Teaching of Jesus was New;' 'How the Truth of the\r\nHistory is made to appear;' 'His Knowledge of Human Nature;' 'His\r\nWonder-working Power;' 'His Child-likeness;' 'The Naturalness of His\r\nTeaching;' 'The Naturalness of certain Fables found in His History;'\r\n'The Genesis of the Gospels.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE CAMPANER THAL, and Other Writings. From the German of JEAN PAUL\r\n     FRIEDRICH RICHTER. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. For sale by D.\r\n     Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe \"other writings\" in the work before us are: Life of Quintus Fixlein,\r\nSchmelzle's Journey to Flaetz, Analects from Richter, and Miscellaneous\r\nPieces. The Life of Quintus Fixlein and Schmelzle's Journey to Flaetz are\r\nboth translated by that ardent admirer of Richter's genius, Thomas\r\nCarlyle; a sufficient guarantee that the spirit and beauty of the\r\noriginal are fully rendered. The Analects are translated by the\r\nbrilliant writer, Thomas de Quincey.\r\n\r\nRichter died while engaged, under recent and almost total blindness, in\r\nenlarging and remodelling the Campaner Thal, or Discourses on the\r\nImmortality of the Soul. 'The unfinished manuscript was borne upon his\r\ncoffin to the burial vault; and Klopstock's hymn, _Auferstehen wirst\r\ndu!_ 'Thou shalt arise, my soul!' can seldom have been sung with more\r\nappropriate application than over the grave of Jean Paul.'\r\n\r\nThe works of Jean Paul require no praise from the hands of the reviewer;\r\nhis name is a true 'open sesame' to all hearts. Not to know him argues\r\none's self unknown. Some of his finest passages are to be found in the\r\nCampaner Thal. It was written from his heart, and embodies his\r\nconviction of immortality. How tender its imagery, how rich its\r\nconsoling suggestions, how all-embracing its arabesques, how original\r\nits structure! That its author should grow in favor with our people,\r\nwould be a convincing proof of their own progress. So many different\r\npowers unite in him, that he has been well styled by his own people 'The\r\nonly.' The vigor and rough strength of the man, with the delicacy and\r\ntenderness of the woman; glowing imagination with wondrous stores of\r\nerudition; fancy with exactness; the most loving heart with the keenest\r\ninsight into the foibles of his fellows; the wit of a Swift with the\r\nromance of a Rousseau--but why attempt to describe the indescribable, to\r\ngive portraits of the Proteus who changes as we gaze upon him?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we heartily commend Jean Paul to the notice of our readers,\r\nand thank the publishers who are placing his great works within the\r\nreach of those who cannot read him in the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE WIND HARP, and Other Poems. By ELLEN CLEMENTINE HOWARTH.\r\n     Philadelphia: Willis P. Hazard.\r\n\r\nIf we have been correctly informed, the author of this book is an Irish\r\nwoman living in Trenton, N. Y., whose husband is a laboring man, and,\r\nlike herself, in humble circumstances. She has quite a large family,\r\nlives in a small tenement, and is obliged to labor daily for a\r\nsubsistence for herself and family. When she came to this country from\r\nIreland, she could scarcely write a grammatical sentence; and all the\r\ninformation of history and the classics which she has, she has derived\r\nfrom such books as have accidentally fallen in her hands. She is\r\nextremely modest and retiring, and does not seem to be at all conscious\r\nof the genius with which she is endowed. Mrs. Howarth possesses the\r\npoetical talent of the Irish race. Her rhythm is musical, flowing, and\r\npure; her thoughts gentle and womanly; her diction refined; her form\r\ngood; her powers of imitation great. What she wants now is more\r\nself-reliance, that she may write from the inner life of her own\r\nexperience. Her poems lack originality. Let her not fear to dip her pen\r\nin her own heart, and sing to us the joys and sorrows of the poor. Burns\r\nwere a better study for her than Moore; the Corn Law rhymer than Poe.\r\nWith her talents and the cultivation she has acquired, her familiarity\r\nwith the hopes, fears, and realities of a life of labor will give her\r\ngreat advantages as the poetess of the faithful, suffering poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS RECEIVED TOO LATE FOR REVIEW.\r\n\r\nLYRICS OF A DAY; OR, NEWSPAPER POETRY.

PROCTER AND JEAN INGELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtremes ever meet, and our age, which is preeminently occupied with\r\nphysical science and material comfort and aggrandizement, is also\r\neminently productive in good poetry. There should be no antithesis\r\nbetween the words _physical science_ and _poetry_. The secrets of the\r\nUniverse, the ways of God's working, are surely the highest poetry; but\r\nthe greater number of scientists have willed a divorce between the\r\nmaterial and the spiritual, and decry that very imaginative faculty\r\nwhich, in the case of Kepler, bore such wonderful fruits for science.\r\nFacts are very well, and induction is also well, but science requires\r\nthe aid of the creative and divining imagination to order the details\r\nand draw thence the broader and higher generalizations. Let us hope that\r\nthe good common sense of the in-coming half-century will annul the\r\ndivorce, and again unite on a solid basis spheres that should never have\r\nbeen so far sundered.\r\n\r\nMeantime, we cannot but remark the number of good poems meeting us on\r\nevery hand, not only from writers known to fame, but also from the\r\nliving tombs of obscure country newspapers. We know it is the fashion to\r\nderide such productions, and sneer at the 'would-be poets.' Let critics\r\nspeak the truth fearlessly, but let them never prefer the glitter of a\r\nself-glorifying search for faults to the more amiable but less piquant\r\noccupation of discovering solid thought, earnest feeling, and poetic\r\nfancy. It is well to discourage insipidity, impudent pretension, and\r\nevery species of affectation; but critics are, like authors, fallible,\r\nand not unfrequently present glaring examples of the very faults they\r\ncondemn. In any case where the knife is needed, let it be used firmly\r\nbut gently, that, while the patient bleeds, he may feel the wound has\r\nbeen inflicted by no unloving, cynical hand, but was really intended for\r\nhis ultimate good. Let the instrument be finely tempered, and neither\r\ncoarse nor rough. We can all recall a few cases where a rude treatment\r\nhas effected a cure, but only by draining the life blood of the victim,\r\nor by turning every better human feeling into bitterness and corroding\r\ngall. Words of blame intended to fall upon the hearts of the young, or\r\nof the old, should always be spoken kindly, for we can never know how\r\ndeeply they may penetrate, what tender schemes for widowed mother,\r\naspiring brother, portionless sister, or starving wife and children they\r\nmay shatter. The public is a pretty keen judge, and will in most cases\r\ndrop works devoid of the immortal elements of genius. The critic may\r\npoint the way, but he need add no unnecessary stab to a downfall sure\r\nand bitter.\r\n\r\nThis digression, however, has no bearing upon the honored names heading\r\nthis table, as both now have become 'household words' in our midst. Both\r\nare acknowledged as _real poets_, but how different are they in style,\r\nand mode of thought! Jean Ingelow, as the more brilliant, is the more\r\ngeneral favorite, Adelaide Procter having as yet scarcely received her\r\ndue meed of praise. Miss Ingelow exhibits an exuberant fancy, a\r\nluxurious wealth of diction, and a generally fine poetic sense of form;\r\nher thoughts are sound, and their dress new and glittering; but the\r\nvolume we have read is one to please the fancy and gratify the intellect\r\nrather than touch the heart. The style is occasionally obscure and the\r\nthought difficult to follow. Of course one can always find a meaning,\r\nbut one is not always sure of interpreting according to the author's\r\nintentions. This quality, found largely in the school of Robert\r\nBrowning, is one to be guarded against. Mrs. Browning sometimes deals in\r\nsuch involutions, but her style is so evidently an essential part of\r\nherself, that we rarely think of affectation in connection with it. It\r\nis pleasanter to dream our own dreams, than to follow any author into a\r\ntangled maze, whence we, and not he, must furnish the clew for egress.\r\n\r\nThe 'Songs of Seven' and 'The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire'\r\nare truly fine poems, to us the most complete and sustained in the\r\nentire collection. In 'Requiescat in Pace,' we are carried so far away\r\nfrom the actualities of life that we scarcely care whether the lover be\r\ndead or living. As in a fairy tale, we read for the sake of curiosity,\r\nadmiring sundry touches here and there, but feeling nothing. Miss\r\nIngelow's rhythm is good, and her language musical.\r\n\r\nThe style of Adelaide Procter is singularly lucid and direct; she has\r\nbut little command of poetic ornament, and we rarely think of her choice\r\nof words. _Pathos_, and _a close, keen representation of human\r\nexperience_, are her distinguishing characteristics. She is a poet to\r\nread when the soul is wrung, and longs for the solace of communion with\r\na noble, tender, sympathetic human heart. The very absence of ornament\r\nbrings the thoughts and feelings nearer to our needs. Her poems are\r\nevidently pictures of real human souls, and not poetic imaginings of\r\nwhat human beings might feel under such and such circumstances. There\r\nare many of Miss Procter's tales and shorter poems which bring tears to\r\nthe eyes of all who have really lived and sorrowed, and the more we read\r\nthem, the more do they come home to us. We feel as if we could take\r\ntheir author into our heart of hearts, and make all the world love her\r\nas do we. With her, brilliancy of imagery and description are replaced\r\nby a sententiousness and concentration of expression that suddenly\r\nstrike home some truth perhaps well known, but little dwelt on. For\r\ninstance, in 'A Legend of Provence,' we find:\r\n\r\n  'Kind hearts are here; yet would the tenderest one\r\n  Have limits to its mercy: God has none.\r\n  And man's forgiveness may be true and sweet,\r\n  But yet he stoops to give it. More complete\r\n  Is Love that lays forgiveness at thy feet,\r\n  And pleads with thee to raise it. Only Heaven\r\n  Means _crowned_, not _vanquished_, when it says, 'Forgiven!''\r\n\r\nAgain, in 'The Present:'\r\n\r\n  'Noble things the great Past promised,\r\n    Holy dreams, both strange and new;\r\n  But the Present shall fulfil them,\r\n    What he promised she shall do.\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'She is wise with all his wisdom,\r\n    Living on his grave she stands,\r\n  On her brow she bears his laurels,\r\n    And _his harvest in her hands_.'\r\n\r\n'Links with Heaven' is a continued series of tender, original thoughts,\r\nexpressed in the same terse and striking, but simple manner. 'Homeless,'\r\n'Treasures,' 'Incompleteness,' 'Light and Shade,' are, among the smaller\r\npoems, fine specimens of her distinguishing merits; while of the\r\nlonger, 'Three Evenings in a Life,' 'Philip and Mildred,' and 'Homeward\r\nBound' cannot fall to charm all who love to read a real page from the\r\nexperience of humanity.\r\n\r\nBoth Jean Ingelow and Adelaide Procter are thoroughly penetrated by\r\nprofound religious convictions, the faith and charity of the latter\r\nbeing especially vivid and pervading. The one has a preponderance of the\r\nbeautiful gift of a rich fancy, while to the other was given in greater\r\ndegree the power of the penetrative and sympathetic imagination. The\r\none, as we read, recalls to us a glittering heap of precious, shining\r\njewels; the other, the first cluster of spring violets, wreaths of\r\nvirginal lilies and midsummer roses, growths of cypress sound to the\r\ncore, rosemary, sage, and all healing herbs, branches of scarlet maple\r\nleaves, and lovely wayside gentians, adorned by the hand of the Great\r\nArtist, and blue as heaven itself.\r\n\r\nBut a little while ago, the Angel, Death, 'who comes in love and pity,\r\nand, to save our treasures, claims them all,' bore away her pure soul\r\nalong the 'misty pathway' to everlasting peace and joy.\r\n\r\n                                                                L.D.P.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLoyal Women of America, this will greet you in the midst of the great\r\nMetropolitan Fair, and we congratulate you upon the success of the heavy\r\nwork you have undertaken and accomplished! When God was manifest to men,\r\nhe came to work for others, and you are treading in the highest path\r\nwhen you follow in the footsteps of the Master. Claim and perform your\r\nnatural _duties_, show yourselves capable of self-abnegation, evince\r\nyour determination to support the cause of justice, to be loyal to the\r\nhumane principles of our Constitution--and all the _rights_ which you\r\nmay postulate, will be conceded you. This war in which you have suffered\r\nso much, made so many sacrifices, has developed your energies, shown\r\nyour capabilities, revealed your noble hearts, and convinced the world\r\nthat woman is the strong and vigorous _helpmate_, and not the weak, if\r\nbeautiful, _toy_ of man. The Government looks to you as its best aid,\r\nfor moral sanction is its living soul; it looks to you for higher life,\r\nfor, unless the heart of love is the throbbing life-pulse of Government,\r\nit sinks into a dull, lethargic mechanism. Far above the din of faction,\r\nthe red tape of cabinets, the rivalry of generals, the strife of\r\npoliticians, shines the resolve, and pulses the determination of woman,\r\nthat _mankind shall be free_. For this, the dusky nation bless her as\r\nshe moves; the frighted mother torn from her child, the maiden sold to\r\nshame, call upon her to deliver them from infamy and the devouring\r\nhunger of a robbed mother's heart. The wronged children of Ham arise and\r\ncall her 'Blessed.'\r\n\r\nBut it is with the men of her own race, that woman is weaving the golden\r\nweb of priceless sympathies. Woven of her tenderness, it sparkles with\r\nman's deathless gratitude. The soldier feels her gracious being in every\r\nthrob of his true heart. Her love and care are forever around him. In\r\nhis lonely night watches, his long marches, his wearisome details of\r\nduty, his absence from home, his countless deprivations, he thinks of\r\nthe women of his country, and is proud that he may be their defender.\r\nThis thought stimulates him on the field of battle, and nerves his arm\r\nto deeds of glory. And when he falls, he falls into the arms which\r\nspread everywhere around him. The Sanitary Commission is her\r\nrepresentative. She sends it to him to breathe of her in his hour of\r\npain. Through it she watches o'er him as he lies low and bleeding on the\r\ndreadful field, surrounded by the dead and dying; she sends her\r\nambulances there to bear him to shelter and comfort; her surgeons stanch\r\nthe noble blood, remove the shattered limbs, quench the stifling thirst,\r\nworking with a tenderness sucked in with the mother's milk. In the\r\nhospital, in her own gentle person, she soothes his restless hours,\r\nwatches o'er his sleepless couch, dresses his mangled limbs, bears him\r\nup with her own faith, giving her strength to aid his weakness, she\r\nleads him back to life, or, if death must come, up to God. American\r\nWomen, live up to the holy duties now demanded of you, and your rights\r\nwill all be conceded, higher, holier, deeper, broader, more vital than\r\nany for which you have yet asked or hoped. The esteem and veneration of\r\nthe very men who have scorned you for your love of luxury, laughed at\r\nyou for your ridiculous aping of foreign aristocracy, jeered at you for\r\nyour love of glitter, your thirst for wealth, your frivolity and folly,\r\nand despised you for your arrogance and heartlessness--are already\r\nyours. Contempt for you has passed away forever. Let the dead past bury\r\nits dead. American women solve the riddle of woman's destiny. Vast is\r\nher field and heritage: all who suffer belong to her. Her heart is the\r\nstrength of love and charity; her mind, justice and the rights of all\r\nwho bear the human form; her soul, God's temple among men, in which\r\ndwell the angels of Purity, Sacrifice, and Devotion. Love to God and man\r\nis her creed, self-abnegation her crown, faith her oriflamme, strength\r\nher gift, life her guerdon, and immortality her portion.\r\n\r\nAmerican Women, we place a soldier's song before you:\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOLDIER'S PSALM OF WOMAN.\r\n\r\nBY LIEUT. RICHARD REALF.\r\n\r\n  Down all the shining lapse of days\r\n    That grow and grow forever\r\n  In truer love and better praise\r\n    Of the Almighty Giver--\r\n  Whatever God-like impulses\r\n    Have blossomed in the human,\r\n  The most divine and fair of these\r\n    Sprang from the soul of woman.\r\n\r\n  Her heart it is preserves the flower\r\n    Of sacrificial duty,\r\n  Which, blown across the blackest hour,\r\n    Transfigures it to beauty;\r\n  Her hands that streak these solemn years\r\n    With vivifying graces,\r\n  And crown the foreheads of our fears\r\n    With light from higher places.\r\n\r\n  O wives and mothers, sanctified\r\n    By holy consecrations,\r\n  Turning our weariness aside\r\n    With blessed ministrations!\r\n  O maidens, in whose dewy eyes\r\n    Perennial comforts glitter,\r\n  Untangling War's dark mysteries\r\n    And making sweet the bitter;--\r\n\r\n  In desolate paths, on dangerous posts,\r\n    By places which, to-morrow,\r\n  Shall be unto these bannered hosts\r\n    Aceldemas of sorrow,\r\n  We hear the sound of helping feet,\r\n    We feel your soft caressings;\r\n  And all our life starts up to greet\r\n    Your lovingness with blessings!\r\n\r\n  On cots of pain, on beds of woe,\r\n    Where stricken heroes languish,\r\n  Wan faces smile and sick hearts grow\r\n    Triumphant over anguish;\r\n  While souls that starve in lonely gloom\r\n    Flush green with odorous praises,\r\n  And all the lowly pallets bloom\r\n    With Gratitude's white daisies.\r\n\r\n  O lips that from our wounds have sucked\r\n    The fever and the burning!\r\n  O tender fingers that have plucked\r\n    The madness from our mourning!\r\n  O hearts that beat so loyal-true\r\n    For soothing and for saving--\r\n  God send your own hopes back to you,\r\n    Crowned with immortal having!\r\n\r\n  Thank God!--O Love! whereby we know\r\n    Beyond our little seeing,\r\n  And feel serene compassions flow\r\n    Around the ache of being;--\r\n  Lo! clear o'er all the pain and dread\r\n    Of our most sore affliction,\r\n  The shining wings of Peace are spread\r\n    In brooding benediction!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have been requested by the author of 'Hannah Thurston,' an article in\r\nour April number, to correct a typographical error (the omission of the\r\nword _all_) in said article.
