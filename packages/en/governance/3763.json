The word\r\n\"silently\" is used deliberately, because to Mr. Price appertained a\r\ncertain ghostlike quality of flitting, and to Mr. Price's horse and wagon\r\nlikewise. He drew up for a brief moment when he saw Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't hurry back if I was you, Will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Price leaned out of the wagon.\r\n\r\n\"Bije has come over from Clovelly to spy around a little mite.\"\r\n\r\nIt was evident from Mr. Price's manner that he regarded the storekeeper\r\nas a member of the reform party.\r\n\r\n\"What did he say, Daddy?\" asked Cynthia, as Wetherell stood staring after\r\nthe flitting buggy in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the faintest idea, Cynthia,\" answered her father, and they\r\nwalked on.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know who 'Bije' is?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said her father, \"and I don't care.\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost criminal ignorance for a man who lived in that part of the\r\ncountry not to know Bijah Bixby of Clovelly, who was paying a little\r\nsocial visit to Coniston that day on his way home from the state\r\ncapital,--tending, as it were, Jethro's flock. Still, Wetherell must be\r\nexcused because he was an impractical literary man with troubles of his\r\nown. But how shall we chronicle Bijah's rank and precedence in the Jethro\r\narmy, in which there are neither shoulder-straps nor annual registers? To\r\ndesignate him as the Chamberlain of that hill Rajah, the Honorable Heth\r\nSutton, would not be far out of the way. The Honorable Heth, whom we all\r\nknow and whom we shall see presently, is the man of substance and of\r\nbroad acres in Clovelly: Bijah merely owns certain mortgages in that\r\ntown, but he had created the Honorable Heth (politically) as surely as\r\ncertain prime ministers we could name have created their sovereigns. The\r\nHonorable Heth was Bijah's creation, and a grand creation he was, as no\r\none will doubt when they see him.\r\n\r\nBijah--as he will not hesitate to tell you--took Heth down in his pocket\r\nto the Legislature, and has more than once delivered him, in certain\r\nblocks of five and ten, and four and twenty, for certain considerations.\r\nThe ancient Song of Sixpence applies to Bijah, but his pocket was\r\ngenerally full of proxies instead of rye, and the Honorable Heth was\r\nfrequently one of the four and twenty blackbirds. In short, Bijah was the\r\nworking bee, and the Honorable Heth the ornamental drone.\r\n\r\nI do not know why I have dwelt so long on such a minor character as\r\nBijah, except that the man fascinates me. Of all the lieutenants in the\r\nstate, his manners bore the closest resemblance to those of Jethro Bass.\r\nWhen he walked behind Jethro in the corridors of the Pelican, kicking up\r\nhis heels behind, he might have been taken for Jethro's shadow. He was of\r\na good height and size, smooth-shaven, with little eyes that kindled, and\r\nhis mouth moved not at all when he spoke: unlike Jethro, he \"used\"\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nWhen Bijah had driven into Coniston village and hitched his wagon to the\r\nrail, he went direct to the store. Chester Perkins and others were\r\nwatching him with various emotions from the stoop, and Bijah took a seat\r\nin the midst of them, characteristically engaging in conversation without\r\nthe usual conventional forms of greeting, as if he had been there all\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"H-how much did you git for your wool, Chester--h-how much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess you hain't here to talk about wool, Bije,\" said Chester, red with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n\"Kind of neglectin' the farm lately, I hear,\" observed Bijah.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass sent you up to find out how much I was neglectin' it,\"\r\nretorted Chester, throwing all caution to the winds.\r\n\r\n\"Thinkin' of upsettin' Jethro, be you? Thinkin' of upsettin' Jethro?\"\r\nremarked Bije, in a genial tone.\r\n\r\n\"Folks in Clovelly hain't got nothin' to do with it, if I am,\" said\r\nChester.\r\n\r\n\"Leetle early for campaignin', Chester, leetle early.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do our campaignin' when we're a mind to.\"\r\n\r\nBijah looked around.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's funny. I could have took oath I seed Rias Richardson here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence.\r\n\r\n\"And Sam Price,\" continued Bijah, in pretended astonishment, \"wahn't he\r\nsettin' on the edge of the stoop when I drove up?\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence, broken only by the enraged breathing of Chester, who was\r\nunable to retort. Moses Hatch laughed. The discreet departure of these\r\ngentlemen certainly had its comical side.\r\n\r\n\"Rias as indoostrious as ever, Mose?\" inquired Bijah.\r\n\r\n\"He has his busy times,\" said Mose, grinning broadly.\r\n\r\n\"See you've got the boys with their backs up, Chester,\" said Bijah.\r\n\r\n\"Some of us are sick of tyranny,\" cried Chester; \"you kin tell that to\r\nJethro Bass when you go back, if he's got time to listen to you buyin'\r\nand sellin' out of railroads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear Jethro's got the Grand Gulf Road in his pocket to do as he's a mind\r\nto with,\" said Moses, with a view to drawing Bijah out. But the remark\r\nhad exactly the opposite effect, Bijah screwing up his face into an\r\nexpression of extraordinary secrecy and cunning.\r\n\r\n\"How much did you git out of it, Bije?\" demanded Chester.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't looked through my clothes yet,\" said Bijah, his face screwed up\r\ntighter than ever. \"N-never look through my clothes till I git home,\r\nChester, it hain't safe.\"\r\n\r\nIt has become painfully evident that Mr. Bixby is that rare type of man\r\nwho can sit down under the enemy's ramparts and smoke him out. It was a\r\nrule of Jethro's code either to make an effective departure or else to\r\nremain and compel the other man to make an ineffective departure. Lem\r\nHallowell might have coped with him; but the stage was late, and after\r\nsome scratching of heads and delving for effectual banter (through which\r\nMr. Bixby sat genial and unconcerned), Chester's followers took their\r\nleave, each choosing his own pretext.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime William Wetherell had entered the store by the back\r\ndoor--unperceived, as he hoped. He had a vehement desire to be left in\r\npeace, and to avoid politics and political discussions forever--vain\r\ndesire for the storekeeper of Coniston. Mr. Wetherell entered the store,\r\nand to take his mind from his troubles, he picked up a copy of Byron:\r\ngradually the conversation on the stoop died away, and just as he was\r\nbeginning to congratulate himself and enjoy the book, he had an\r\nunpleasant sensation of some one approaching him measuredly. Wetherell\r\ndid not move; indeed, he felt that he could not--he was as though charmed\r\nto the spot. He could have cried aloud, but the store was empty, and\r\nthere was no one to hear him. Mr. Bixby did not speak until he was within\r\na foot of his victim's ear. His voice was very nasal, too.\r\n\r\n\"Wetherell, hain't it?\"\r\n\r\nThe victim nodded helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"Want to see you a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can we talk private?\" asked Mr. Bixby, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"There's no one here,\" Wetherell answered. \"What do you wish to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the boys was to see me speakin' to you, they might git\r\nsuspicious--you understand,\" he confided, his manner conveying a hint\r\nthat they shared some common policy.\r\n\r\n\"I don't meddle with politics,\" said Wetherell, desperately.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" answered Bijah, coming even closer. \"I knowed you was a\r\nlevel-headed man, moment I set eyes on you. Made up my mind I'd have a\r\nlittle talk in private with you--you understand. The boys hain't got no\r\nreason to suspicion you care anything about politics, have they?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't pay no attention to what they say?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\nYou hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I can't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ex'actly! You hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you I couldn't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Want you should vote right when the time comes,\" said Bijah. \"D-don't\r\nwant to see such an intelligent man go wrong an' be sorry for it--you\r\nunderstand. Chester Perkins is hare-brained. Jethro Bass runs things in\r\nthis state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bixby--\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand,\" said Bijah, screwing up his face. \"Guess your watch is\r\na-comin' out.\" He tucked it back caressingly, and started for the\r\ndoor--the back door. Involuntarily Wetherell put his hand to his pocket,\r\nfelt something crackle under it, and drew the something out. To his\r\namazement it was a ten-dollar bill.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" he cried so sharply in his fright that Mr. Bixby, turned around.\r\nWetherell ran after him. \"Take this back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess you got me,\" said Bijah. \"W-what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"This money is yours,\" cried Wetherell, so loudly that Bijah started and\r\nglanced at the front of the store.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you made some mistake,\" he said, staring at the storekeeper with\r\nsuch amazing innocence that he began to doubt his senses, and clutched\r\nthe bill to see if it was real.\r\n\r\n\"But I had no money in my pocket,\" said Wetherell, perplexedly. And then,\r\ngaining, indignation, \"Take this to the man who sent you, and give it\r\nback to him.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bijah merely whispered caressingly in his ear, \"Nobody sent me,--you\r\nunderstand,--nobody sent me,\" and was gone. Wetherell stood for a moment,\r\ndazed by the man's audacity, and then, hurrying to the front stoop, the\r\nmoney still in his hand, he perceived Mr. Bixby in the sunlit road\r\nwalking, Jethro-fashion, toward Ephraim Prescott's harness shop.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Daddy,\" said Cynthia, coming in from the garden, \"where did you get\r\nall that money? Your troubles must feel better.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not mine,\" said Wetherell, starting. And then, quivering with\r\nanger and mortification, he sank down on the stoop to debate what he\r\nshould do.\r\n\r\n\"Is it somebody else's?\" asked the child, presently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you give it back to them, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\nHow was Wetherell to know, in his fright, that Mr. Bixby had for once\r\nindulged in an overabundance of zeal in Jethro's behalf? He went to the\r\ndoor, laughter came to him across the green from the harness shop, and\r\nhis eye following the sound, fastened on Bijah seated comfortably in the\r\nmidst of the group there. Bitterly the storekeeper comprehended that, had\r\nhe possessed courage, he would have marched straight after Mr. Bixby and\r\nconfronted him before them all with the charge of bribery. The blood\r\nthrobbed in his temples, and yet he sat there, trembling, despising\r\nhimself, repeating that he might have had the courage if Jethro Bass had\r\nnot bought the mortgage. The fear of the man had entered the\r\nstorekeeper's soul.\r\n\r\n\"Does it belong to that man over there?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it to him, Daddy,\" and she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Not now,\" Wetherell answered nervously, glancing at the group. He went\r\ninto the store, addressed an envelope to \"Mr. Bijah Bixby of Clovelly,\"\r\nand gave it to Cynthia. \"When he comes back for his wagon, hand it to\r\nhim,\" he said, feeling that he would rather, at that moment, face the\r\ndevil himself than Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Cynthia gave Mr. Bixby the envelope as he unhitched\r\nhis horse; and so deftly did Bijah slip it into his pocket, that he must\r\ncertainly have misjudged its contents. None of the loungers at Ephraim's\r\nremarked the transaction.\r\n\r\nIf Jethro had indeed instructed Bijah to look after his flock at\r\nConiston, it was an ill-conditioned move, and some of the flock resented\r\nit when they were quite sure that Bijah was climbing the notch road\r\ntoward Clovelly. The discussion (from which the storekeeper was\r\nprovidentially omitted) was in full swing when the stage arrived, and Lem\r\nHallowell's voice silenced the uproar. It was Lem's boast that he never\r\nhad been and never would be a politician.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you folks quit railin' against Jethro and do somethin'?\" he\r\nsaid. \"Bije turns up here, and you all scatter like a flock of crows. I'm\r\ntired of makin' complaints about that Brampton road, and to-day the hull\r\nside of it give way, and put me in the ditch. Sure as the sun rises\r\nto-morrow, I'm goin' to make trouble for Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"What be you a-goin' to do, Lem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indict the town,\" replied Lem, vigorously. \"Who is the town? Jethro,\r\nhain't he? Who has charge of the highways? Jethro Bass, Chairman of the\r\nSelectmen. I've spoke to him, time and agin, about that piece, and he\r\nhain't done nothin'. To-night I go to Harwich and git the court to\r\napp'int an agent to repair that road, and the town'll hev to pay the\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\nThe boldness of Lem's intention for the moment took away their breaths,\r\nand then the awe-stricken hush which followed his declaration was broken\r\nby the sound of Chester's fist hammering on the counter.\r\n\r\n\"That's the sperrit,\" he cried; \"I'll go along with you, Lem.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't,\" said Lem, \"you'll stay right whar you be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chester wants to git credit for the move,\" suggested Sam Price, slyly.\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie, Sam Price,\" shouted Chester. \"What made you sneak off when\r\nBije Bixby come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't sneak off,\" retorted Sam, indignantly, through his nose; \"forgot\r\nthem eggs I left to home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" said Lem, with a wink at Moses Hatch, \"you hitch up your hoss and\r\nfetch me over to Harwich to git that indictment. Might git a chance to\r\nsee that lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, now, I wish I could, Lem, but my hoss is stun lame.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter, during which Sam tried to look unconcerned.\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe Rias'll take me over,\" said Lem, soberly. \"You hitch up, Rias?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's gone,\" said Joe Northcutt, \"slid out the door when you was speakin'\r\nto Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hain't none of you folks got spunk enough to carry me over to see the\r\njedge?\" demanded Lem; \"my horses ain't fit to travel to-night.\" Another\r\nsilence followed, and Lem laughed contemptuously but good-naturedly, and\r\nturned on his heel. \"Guess I'll walk, then,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You kin have my white hoss, Lem,\" said Moses Hatch.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Lem; \"I'll come round and hitch up soon's I git my\r\nsupper.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when Cynthia and her father and Millicent Skinner--who\r\ncondescended to assist in the work and cooking of Mr. Wetherell's\r\nhousehold--were seated at supper in the little kitchen behind the store,\r\nthe head and shoulders of the stage-driver were thrust in at the window,\r\nhis face shining from its evening application of soap and water. He was\r\nmaking eyes at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Want to go to Harwich, Will?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nWilliam set his cup down quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You hain't afeard, be you?\" he continued. \"Most folks that hasn't went\r\nWest or died is afeard of Jethro Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daddy isn't afraid of him, and I'm not,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Cynthy,\" said Lem, leaning over and giving a tug to the\r\npigtail that hung down her back; \"there hain't nothin' to be afeard of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like him,\" said Cynthia; \"he's very good to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You stick to him, Cynthy,\" said the stage driver.\r\n\r\n\"Ready, Will?\"\r\n\r\nIt may readily be surmised that Mr. Wetherell did not particularly wish\r\nto make this excursion, the avowed object of which was to get Mr. Bass\r\ninto trouble. But he went, and presently he found himself jogging along\r\non the mountain road to Harwich. From the crest of Town's End ridge they\r\nlooked upon the western peaks tossing beneath a golden sky. The spell of\r\nthe evening's beauty seemed to have fallen on them both, and for a long\r\ntime Lem spoke not a word, and nodded smilingly but absently to the\r\ngreetings that came from the farm doorways.\r\n\r\n\"Will,\" he said at last, \"you acted sensible. There's no mite of use of\r\nyour gettin' mixed up in politics. You're too good for 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too good!\" exclaimed the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"You're eddicated,\" Lem replied, with a tactful attempt to cover up a\r\ndeficiency; \"you're a gentleman, ef you do keep store.\"\r\n\r\nLemuel apparently thought that gentlemen and politics were\r\ncontradictions. He began to whistle, while Wetherell sat and wondered\r\nthat any one could be so care-free on such a mission. The day faded, and\r\nwent out, and the lights of Harwich twinkled in the valley. Wetherell was\r\nalmost tempted to mention his trouble to this man, as he had been to\r\nEphraim: the fear that each might think he wished to borrow money held\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro's all right,\" Lem remarked, \"but if he neglects the road, he's\r\ngot to stand for it, same's any other. I writ him twice to the capital,\r\nand give him fair warning afore he went. He knows I hain't doin' of it\r\nfor politics. I've often thought,\" Lem continued, \"that ef some smart,\r\ngood woman could have got hold of him when he was young, it would have\r\nmade a big difference. What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you room enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I've got the hull seat,\" said Lem. \"As I was sayin', if some\r\nable woman had married Jethro and made him look at things a little mite\r\ndifferent, he would have b'en a big man. He has all the earmarks. Why,\r\nwhen he comes back to Coniston, them fellers'll hunt their holes like\r\nrabbits, mark my words.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand he holds the mortgages of some of them,\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't blame him a great deal ef he did git tired and sell Chester\r\nout soon. This thing happens regular as leap year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass doesn't seem to frighten you,\" said the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lem, \"I hain't afeard of him, that's so. For the life of me,\r\nI can't help likin' him, though he does things that I wouldn't do for all\r\nthe power in Christendom. Here's Jedge Parkinson's house.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell remained in the wagon while Lemuel went in to transact his\r\nbusiness. The judge's house, outlined in the starlight, was a modest\r\ndwelling with a little porch and clambering vines, set back in its own\r\ngarden behind a picket fence. Presently, from the direction of the lines\r\nof light in the shutters, came the sound of voices, Lem's deep and\r\ninsistent, and another, pitched in a high nasal key, deprecatory and\r\nprotesting. There was still another, a harsh one that growled something\r\nunintelligible, and Wetherell guessed, from the fragments which he heard,\r\nthat the judge before sitting down to his duty was trying to dissuade the\r\nstage driver from a step that was foolhardy. He guessed likewise that Lem\r\nwas not to be dissuaded. At length a silence followed, then the door\r\nswung open, and three figures came down the illuminated path.\r\n\r\n\"Like to make you acquainted with Jedge Abner Parkinson, Mr. Wetherell,\r\nand Jim Irving. Jim's the sheriff of Truro County, and I guess the jedge\r\ndon't need any recommendation as a lawyer from me. You won't mind stayin'\r\nawhile with the jedge while Jim and I go down town with the team? You're\r\nboth literary folks.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell followed the judge into the house. He was sallow, tall and\r\nspare and stooping, clean-shaven, with a hooked nose and bright eyes--the\r\nface of an able and adroit man, and he wore the long black coat of the\r\npolitician-lawyer. The room was filled with books, and from these Judge\r\nParkinson immediately took his cue, probably through a fear that\r\nWetherell might begin on the subject of Lemuel's errand. However, it\r\ninstantly became plain that the judge was a true book lover, and despite\r\nthe fact that Lem's visit had disturbed him not a little, he soon grew\r\nanimated in a discussion on the merits of Sir Walter Scott, paced the\r\nroom, pitched his nasal voice higher and higher, covered his table with\r\nvolumes of that author to illustrate his meaning. Neither of them heard a\r\nknock, and they both stared dumfounded at the man who filled the doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was Jethro Bass!\r\n\r\nHe entered the room with characteristic unconcern, as if he had just left\r\nit on a trivial errand, and without a \"How do you do?\" or a \"Good\r\nevening,\" parted his coat tails, and sat down in the judge's armchair.\r\nThe judge dropped the volume of Scott on the desk, and as for Wetherell,\r\nhe realized for once the full meaning of the biblical expression of a\r\nman's tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth; the gleam of one of\r\nJethro's brass buttons caught his eye and held it fascinated.\r\n\r\n\"Literary talk, Judge?\" said Jethro. \"D-don't mind me--go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought you were at the capital,\" said the judge, reclaiming some of his\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\n\"Good many folks thought so,\" answered Jethro, \"g-good many folks.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no conceivable answer to this, so the judge sat down with an\r\naffectation of ease. He was a man on whom dignity lay heavily, and was\r\nnot a little ruffled because Wetherell had been a witness of his\r\ndiscomfiture. He leaned back in his chair, then leaned forward,\r\nstretching his neck and clearing his throat, a position in which he bore\r\na ludicrous resemblance to a turkey gobbler.\r\n\r\n\"Most through the Legislature?\" inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout as common,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, and, forgetful for the moment of his own\r\npredicament, Wetherell found a fearful fascination in watching the\r\ncontortions of the victim whose punishment was to precede his. It had\r\nbeen one of the delights of Louis XI to contemplate the movements of a\r\ncertain churchman whom he had had put in a cage, and some inkling of the\r\npleasure to be derived from this pastime of tyrants dawned on Wetherell.\r\nPerhaps the judge, too, thought of this as he looked at \"Quentin Durward\"\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n\"I was just sayin' to Lem Hallowell,\" began the judge, at last, \"that I\r\nthought he was a little mite hasty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--indicted us, Judge?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe judge and Wetherell heard the question with different emotions. Mr.\r\nParkinson did not seem astonished at the miracle which had put Jethro in\r\npossession of this information, but heaved a long sigh of relief, as a\r\nman will when the worst has at length arrived.\r\n\r\n\"I had to, Jethro--couldn't help it. I tried to get Hallowell to wait\r\ntill you come back and talk it over friendly, but he wouldn't listen;\r\nsaid the road was dangerous, and that he'd spoken about it too often. He\r\nsaid he hadn't anything against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't come in to complain,\" said Jethro, \"didn't come in to complain.\r\nRoad is out of repair. W-what's the next move?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Jethro--I swan I'm sorry.\" He cleared his throat. \"Well,\" he\r\ncontinued in his judicial manner, \"the court has got to appoint an agent\r\nto repair that road, the agent will present the bill, and the town will\r\nhave to pay the bill--whatever it is. It's too bad, Jethro, that you have\r\nallowed this to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you've got to app'int an agent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I'm sorry--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you app'inted one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-got any candidates?\"\r\n\r\nThe judge scratched his head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know as I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the judge.\r\n\r\n\"A-any legal objection to my bein' app'inted?\" asked Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe judge looked at him and gasped. But the look was an involuntary\r\ntribute of admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said hesitatingly, \"I don't know as there is, Jethro. No,\r\nthere's no legal objection to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-any other kind of objection?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe judge appeared to reflect.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" he said at last, \"I don't know as there is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, is there?\" said Jethro, again.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the judge, with the finality of a decision. A smile seemed to\r\nbe pulling at the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm a candidate,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me, Jethro, that you want me to appoint you agent to fix\r\nthat road?\"\r\n\r\n\"I-I'm a candidate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the judge, rising, \"I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" said Jethro, sitting still.\r\n\r\n\"I'll send the papers over to you within two or three days.\r\n\r\n\"O-ought to be done right away, Judge. Road's in bad shape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll send the papers over to you to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long--would it take to make out that app'intment--how long?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't take but a little while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to take the appointment along with you to-night?\" asked the\r\njudge, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess that's about it.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word the judge went over to his table, and for a while the\r\nsilence was broken only by the scratching of his pen.\r\n\r\n\"Er--interested in roads,--Will,--interested in roads?\"\r\n\r\nThe judge stopped writing to listen, since it was now the turn of the\r\nother victim.\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly,\" answered Mr. Wetherell, whose throat was dry.\r\n\r\n\"C-come over for the drive--c-come over for the drive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the storekeeper, rather faintly.\r\n\r\n\"H-how's Cynthy?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper was too astonished to answer. At that moment there was a\r\nheavy step in the doorway, and Lem Hallowell entered the room. He took\r\none long look at Jethro and bent over and slapped his hand on his knee,\r\nand burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"So here you be!\" he cried. \"By Godfrey! ef you don't beat all outdoors,\r\nJethro. Wal, I got ahead of ye for once, but you can't say I didn't warn\r\nye. Come purty nigh bustin' the stage on that road today, and now I'm\r\na-goin' to hev an agent app'inted.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-who's the agent?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"We'll git one. Might app'int Will, there, only he don't seem to want to\r\nget mixed up in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the agent,\" cried the judge, holding out the appointment to\r\nJethro.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-what?\" ejaculated Lem.\r\n\r\nJethro took the appointment, and put it in his cowhide wallet.\r\n\r\n\"Be you the agent?\" demanded the amazed stage driver.\r\n\r\n\"C-callate to be,\" said Jethro, and without a smile or another word to\r\nany one he walked out into the night, and after various exclamations of\r\nastonishment and admiration, the stage driver followed.\r\n\r\nNo one, indeed, could have enjoyed this unexpected coup of Jethro's more\r\nthan Lem himself, and many times on their drive homeward he burst into\r\nloud and unexpected fits of laughter at the sublime conception of the\r\nChairman of the Selectmen being himself appointed road agent.\r\n\r\n\"Will,\" said he, \"don't you tell this to a soul. We'll have some fun out\r\nof some of the boys to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper promised, but he had an unpleasant presentiment that he\r\nhimself might be one of the boys in question.\r\n\r\n\"How do you suppose Jethro Bass knew you were going to indict the town?\"\r\nhe asked of the stage driver.\r\n\r\nLem burst into fresh peals of laughter; but this was something which he\r\ndid not attempt to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was a certain spinster whom Sam Price had been\r\ntrying to make up his mind to marry for ten years or more, and it was\r\nthat gentleman's habit to spend at least one day in the month in Harwich\r\nfor the purpose of paying his respects. In spite of the fact that his\r\nhorse had been \"stun lame\" the night before, Mr. Price was able to start\r\nfor Harwich, via Brampton, very early the next morning. He was driving\r\nalong through Northcutt's woods with one leg hanging over the wheel,\r\nhumming through his nose what we may suppose to have been a love-ditty,\r\nand letting his imagination run riot about the lady in question, when he\r\nnearly fell out of his wagon. The cause of this was the sight of fat Tom\r\ncoming around a corner, with Jethro Bass behind him. Lem Hallowell and\r\nthe storekeeper had kept their secret so well that Sam, if he was\r\nthinking about Jethro at all, believed him at that moment to be seated in\r\nthe Throne Room at the Pelican House, in the capital.\r\n\r\nMr. Price, however, was one of an adaptable nature, and by the time he\r\nhad pulled up beside Jethro he had recovered sufficiently to make a few\r\nremarks on farming subjects, and finally to express a polite surprise at\r\nJethro's return.\r\n\r\n\"But you come a little mite late, hain't you, Jethro?\" he asked finally,\r\nwith all of the indifference he could assume.\r\n\r\n\"H-how's that, Sam--how's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's too bad,--I swan it is,--but Lem Hallowell rode over to Harwich\r\nlast night and indicted the town for that piece of road by the Four\r\nCorners. Took Will Wetherell along with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't say so!\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I callate he done it,\" responded Sam, pulling a long face. \"The court'll\r\nhev to send an agent to do the job, and I guess you'll hev to foot the\r\nbill, Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"C-court'll hev to app'int an agent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I callate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--you a candidate--Sam--you a candidate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know but what I be,\" answered the usually wary Mr. Price.\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to Harwich--hain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe I be, and mebbe I hain't,\" said Sam, not able to repress a\r\nself-conscious snicker.\r\n\r\n\"M-might as well be you as anybody, Sam,\" said Jethro, as he drove on.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange that the idea, thus planted, should grow in Mr.\r\nPrice's favor as he proceeded. He had been surprised at Jethro's\r\ncomplaisance, and he wondered whether, after all, he had done well to\r\nhelp Chester stir people up at this time. When he reached Harwich,\r\ninstead of presenting himself promptly at the spinster's house, he went\r\nfirst to the office of Judge Parkinson, as became a prudent man of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no need to go into the details of Mr. Price's\r\ndiscomfiture on the occasion of this interview. The judge was by nature\r\nof a sour disposition, but he haw-hawed so loudly as he explained to Mr.\r\nPrice the identity of the road agent that the judge of probate in the\r\nnext office thought his colleague had gone mad. Afterward Mr. Price stood\r\nfor some time in the entry, where no one could see him, scratching his\r\nhead and repeating his favorite exclamation, \"I want to know!\" It has\r\nbeen ascertained that he omitted to pay his respects to the spinster on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nCyamon Johnson carried the story back to Coniston, where it had the\r\neffect of eliminating Mr. Price from local politics for some time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThat same morning Chester Perkins was seen by many driving wildly about\r\nfrom farm to farm, supposedly haranguing his supporters to make a final\r\nstand against the tyrant, but by noon it was observed by those\r\nnaturalists who were watching him that his activity had ceased. Chester\r\narrived at dinner time at Joe Northcutt's, whose land bordered on the\r\npiece of road which had caused so much trouble, and Joe and half a dozen\r\nothers had been at work there all morning under the road agent whom Judge\r\nParkinson had appointed. Now Mrs. Northcutt was Chester's sister, a woman\r\nwho in addition to other qualities possessed the only sense of humor in\r\nthe family. She ushered the unsuspecting Chester into the kitchen, and\r\nthere, seated beside Joe and sipping a saucer of very hot coffee, was\r\nJethro Bass himself. Chester halted in the doorway, his face brick-red,\r\nwords utterly failing him, while Joe sat horror-stricken, holding aloft\r\non his fork a smoking potato. Jethro continued to sip his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"B-busy times, Chester,\" he said, \"b-busy times.\"\r\n\r\nChester choked. Where were the burning words of denunciation which came\r\nso easily to his tongue on other occasions? It is difficult to denounce a\r\nman who insists upon drinking coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Set right down, Chester,\" said Mrs. Northcutt, behind him.\r\n\r\nChester sat down, and to this day he cannot account for that action. Once\r\nseated, habit asserted itself; and he attacked the boiled dinner with a\r\nferocity which should have been exercised against Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the stores down to the capital is finer than ever, Mr. Bass,\"\r\nremarked Mrs. Northcutt.\r\n\r\n\"So-so, Mis' Northcutt, so-so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was there ten years ago,\" remarked Mrs. Northcutt, with a sigh of\r\nreminiscence, \"and I never see such fine silks and bonnets in my life.\r\nNow I've often wanted to ask you, did you buy that bonnet with the\r\ntrembly jet things for Mis' Bass?\"\r\n\r\n\"That bonnet come out full better'n I expected,\" answered Jethro,\r\nmodestly.\r\n\r\n\"You have got taste in wimmin's fixin's, Mr. Bass. Strange? Now I\r\nwouldn't let Joe choose my things for worlds.\"\r\n\r\nSo the dinner progressed, Joe with his eyes on his plate, Chester silent,\r\nbut bursting with anger and resentment, until at last Jethro pushed back\r\nhis chair, and said good day to Mrs. Northcutt and walked out. Chester\r\ngot up instantly and went after him, and Joe, full of forebodings,\r\nfollowed his brother-in-law! Jethro was standing calmly on the grass\r\nplot, whittling a toothpick. Chester stared at him a moment, and then\r\nstrode off toward the barn, unhitched his horse and jumped in his wagon.\r\nSomething prompted him to take another look at Jethro, who was still\r\nwhittling.\r\n\r\n\"C-carry me down to the road, Chester--c-carry me down to the road?\" said\r\nJethro.\r\n\r\nJoe Northcutt's knees gave way under him, and he sat down on a sugar\r\nkettle. Chester tightened up his reins so suddenly that his horse reared,\r\nwhile Jethro calmly climbed into the seat beside him and they drove off.\r\nIt was some time before Joe had recovered sufficiently to arise and\r\nrepair to the scene of operations on the road.\r\n\r\nIt was Joe who brought the astounding news to the store that evening.\r\nChester was Jethro's own candidate for senior Selectman! Jethro himself\r\nhad said so, that he would be happy to abdicate in Chester's favor, and\r\nmake it unanimous--Chester having been a candidate so many times, and\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\"Whar's Chester?\" said Lem Hallowell.\r\n\r\nJoe pulled a long face.\r\n\r\n\"Just come from his house, and he hain't done a lick of work sence noon\r\ntime. Jest sets in a corner--won't talk, won't eat--jest sets thar.\"\r\n\r\nLem sat down on the counter and laughed until he was forced to brush the\r\ntears from his cheeks at the idea of Chester Perkins being Jethro's\r\ncandidate. Where was reform now? If Chester were elected, it would be in\r\nthe eyes of the world as Jethro's man. No wonder he sat in a corner and\r\nrefused to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you'll ketch it next, Will, for goin' over to Harwich with Lem,\"\r\nJoe remarked playfully to the storekeeper, as he departed.\r\n\r\nThese various occurrences certainly did not tend to allay the uneasiness\r\nof Mr. Wetherell. The next afternoon, at a time when a slack trade was\r\nslackest, he had taken his chair out under the apple tree and was sitting\r\nwith that same volume of Byron in his lap--but he was not reading. The\r\nhumorous aspects of the doings of Mr. Bass did not particularly appeal to\r\nhim now; and he was, in truth, beginning to hate this man whom the fates\r\nhad so persistently intruded into his life. William Wetherell was not, it\r\nmay have been gathered, what may be called vindictive. He was a\r\nsensitive, conscientious person whose life should have been in the vale;\r\nand yet at that moment he had a fierce desire to confront Jethro Bass\r\nand--and destroy him. Yes, he felt equal to that.\r\n\r\nShocks are not very beneficial to sensitive natures. William Wetherell\r\nlooked up, and there was Jethro Bass on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n\"G-great resource--readin'--great resource,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Jethro snuffed out utterly that passion to destroy, and\r\nanother sensation took its place--a sensation which made it very\r\ndifficult for William Wetherell to speak, but he managed to reply that\r\nreading had been a great resource to him. Jethro had a parcel in his\r\nhand, and he laid it down on the step beside him; and he seemed, for once\r\nin his life, to be in a mood for conversation.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard for me to read a book,\" he observed. \"I own to it--it's a\r\nlittle mite hard. H-hev to kind of spell it out in places. Hain't had\r\nmuch time for readin'. But it's kind of pleasant to l'arn what other\r\nfolks has done in the world by pickin' up a book. T-takes your mind off\r\nthings--don't it?\"\r\n\r\nWetherell felt like saying that his reading had not been able to do that\r\nlately. Then he made the plunge, and shuddered as he made it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass--I--I have been waiting to speak to you about that mortgage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--yes,\" he answered, without moving his head, \"er--about the\r\nmortgage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington told me that you had bought it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did--yes, I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you will have to foreclose,\" said Wetherell; \"I cannot\r\nreasonably ask you to defer the payments any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I foreclose it, what will you do?\" he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nThere was but one answer--Wetherell would have to go back to the city and\r\nface the consequences. He had not the strength to earn his bread on a\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n\"If I'd a b'en in any hurry for the money--g-guess I'd a notified you,\"\r\nsaid Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I think you had better foreclose, Mr. Bass,\" Wetherell answered; \"I\r\ncan't hold out any hopes to you that it will ever be possible for me to\r\npay it off. It's only fair to tell you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, with what seemed a suspicion of a smile, \"I don't know\r\nbut what that's about as honest an answer as I ever got.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you do it?\" Wetherell cried, suddenly goaded by another fear;\r\n\"why did you buy that mortgage?\"\r\n\r\nBut this did not shake his composure.\r\n\r\n\"H-have a little habit of collectin' 'em,\" he answered, \"same as you do\r\nbooks. G-guess some of 'em hain't as valuable.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was beginning to think that Jethro knew something also\r\nof such refinements of cruelty as were practised by Caligula. He drew\r\nforth his cowhide wallet and produced from it a folded piece of newspaper\r\nwhich must, Wetherell felt sure, contain the mortgage in question.\r\n\r\n\"There's one power I always wished I had,\" he observed, \"the power to\r\nmake folks see some things as I see 'em. I was acrost the Water to-night,\r\non my hill farm, when the sun set, and the sky up thar above the mountain\r\nwas all golden bars, and the river all a-flamin' purple, just as if it\r\nhad been dyed by some of them Greek gods you're readin' about. Now if I\r\ncould put them things on paper, I wouldn't care a haycock to be\r\nPresident. No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper's amazement as he listened to this speech may be\r\nimagined. Was this Jethro Bass? If so, here was a side of him the\r\nexistence of which no one suspected. Wetherell forgot the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you put that on paper?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJethro smiled, and made a deprecating motion with his thumb.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes when I hain't busy, I drop into the state library at the\r\ncapital and enjoy myself. It's like goin' to another world without any\r\nfolks to bother you. Er--er--there's books I'd like to talk to you\r\nabout--sometime.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you told me you didn't read much, Mr. Bass?\"\r\n\r\nHe made no direct reply, but unfolded the newspaper in his hand, and then\r\nWetherell saw that it was only a clipping.\r\n\r\n\"H-happened to run across this in a newspaper--if this hain't this\r\ncounty, I wahn't born and raised here. If it hain't Coniston Mountain\r\nabout seven o'clock of a June evening, I never saw Coniston Mountain.\r\nEr--listen to this.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he read, with a feeling which Wetherell had not supposed he\r\npossessed, an extract: and as the storekeeper listened his blood began to\r\nrun wildly. At length Jethro put down the paper without glancing at his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"There's somethin' about that that fetches you spinnin' through the air,\"\r\nhe said slowly. \"Sh-showed it to Jim Willard, editor of the Newcastle\r\nGuardian. Er--what do you think he said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Wetherell, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Willard said, 'Bass, w-wish you'd find me that man. I'll give him five\r\ndollars every week for a letter like that--er--five dollars a week.'\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, folded up the paper again and put it in his pocket, took out a\r\ncard and handed it to Wetherell.\r\n\r\n        James G. Willard, Editor.\r\n         Newcastle Guardian.\r\n\r\n\"That's his address,\" said Jethro. \"Er--guess you'll know what to do with\r\nit. Er--five dollars a week--five dollars a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know I wrote this article?\" said Wetherell, as the card\r\ntrembled between his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"K-knowed the place was Coniston seen from the 'east, knowed there wahn't\r\nany one is Brampton or Harwich could have done it--g-guessed the\r\nrest--guessed the rest.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell could only stare at him like a man who, with the halter about\r\nhis neck, has been suddenly reprieved. But Jethro Bass did not appear to\r\nbe waiting for thanks. He cleared his throat, and had Wetherell not been\r\nin such a condition himself, he would actually have suspected him of\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Wetherell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-won't say nothin' about the mortgage--p-pay it when you can.\"\r\n\r\nThis roused the storekeeper to a burst of protest, but he stemmed it.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't got the money, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"If I needed money, d'ye suppose I'd bought the mortgage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the still bewildered Wetherell, \"of course not.\" There he\r\nstuck, that other suspicion of political coercion suddenly rising\r\nuppermost. Could this be what the man meant? Wetherell put his hand to\r\nhis head, but he did not dare to ask the question. Then Jethro Bass fixed\r\nhis eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't never mixed any in politics--hev you n-never mixed any?\"\r\n\r\nWetherell's heart sank.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't--take my advice--d-don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried the storekeeper, so loudly that he frightened himself.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't,\" repeated Jethro, imperturbably.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence, the storekeeper being unable to speak.\r\nConiston Water, at the foot of the garden, sang the same song, but it\r\nseemed to Wetherell to have changed its note from sorrow to joy.\r\n\r\n\"H-hear things, don't you--hear things in the store?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't hear 'em. Keep out of politics, Will, s-stick to store-keepin'\r\nand--and literature.\"\r\n\r\nJethro got to his feet and turned his back on the storekeeper and picked\r\nup the parcel he had brought.\r\n\r\n\"C-Cynthy well?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I--I'll call her,\" said Wetherell, huskily. \"She--she was down by the\r\nbrook when you came.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jethro Bass did not wait. He took his parcel and strode down to\r\nConiston Water, and there he found Cynthia seated on a rock with her toes\r\nin a pool.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Cynthy?\" said he, looking down at her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm well, Uncle Jethro,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"R-remembered what I told you to call me, hev you,\" said Jethro, plainly\r\npleased. \"Th-that's right. Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"S-said you liked books--didn't you? S-said you liked books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" she replied simply, \"very much.\"\r\n\r\nHe undid the wrapping of the parcel, and there lay disclosed a book with\r\na very gorgeous cover. He thrust it into the child's lap.\r\n\r\n\"It's 'Robinson Crusoe'!\" she exclaimed, and gave a little shiver of\r\ndelight that made ripples in the pool. Then she opened it--not without\r\nawe, for William Wetherell's hooks were not clothed in this magnificent\r\nmanner. \"It's full of pictures,\" cried Cynthia. \"See, there he is making\r\na ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-you read it, Cynthy?\" asked Jethro, a little anxiously.\r\n\r\nNo, Cynthia hadn't.\r\n\r\n\"L-like it, Cynthy--l-like it?\" said he, not quite so anxiously.\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up at him with a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n\"F-fetched it up from the capital for you, Cynthy--for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"For me!\"\r\n\r\nA strange thrill ran through Jethro Bass as he gazed upon the wonder and\r\ndelight in the face of the child.\r\n\r\n\"F-fetched it for you, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Cynthia sat very still, and then she slowly closed the book\r\nand stared at the cover again, Jethro looking down at her the while. To\r\ntell the truth, she found it difficult to express the emotions which the\r\nevent had summoned up.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you--Uncle Jethro,\" she said.\r\n\r\nJethro, however, understood. He had, indeed, never failed to understand\r\nher from the beginning. He parted his coat tails and sat down on the rock\r\nbeside her, and very gently opened the book again, to the first chapter.\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to read it, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said, and trembled again.\r\n\r\n\"Er--read it to me?\"\r\n\r\nSo Cynthia read \"Robinson Crusoe\" to him while the summer afternoon wore\r\naway, and the shadows across the pool grew longer and longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThus William Wetherell became established in Coniston, and was started at\r\nlast--poor man--upon a life that was fairly tranquil. Lem Hallowell had\r\nonce covered him with blushes by unfolding a newspaper in the store and\r\nreading an editorial beginning: \"We publish today a new and attractive\r\nfeature of the Guardian, a weekly contribution from a correspondent whose\r\nmodesty is to be compared only with his genius as a writer. We are\r\nconfident that the readers of our Raper will appreciate the letter in\r\nanother column signed 'W. W.'\" And from that day William was accorded\r\nmuch of the deference due to a litterateur which the fates had hitherto\r\ndenied him. Indeed, during the six years which we are about to skip over\r\nso lightly, he became a marked man in Coniston, and it was voted in towns\r\nmeeting that he be intrusted with that most important of literary labors,\r\nthe Town History of Coniston.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, too, there sprang up the strangest of intimacies\r\nbetween him and Jethro Bass. Surely no more dissimilar men than these\r\nhave ever been friends, and that the friendship was sometimes misjudged\r\nwas one of the clouds on William Wetherell's horizon. As the years went\r\non he was still unable to pay off the mortgage; and sometimes, indeed, he\r\ncould not even meet the interest, in spite of the princely sum he\r\nreceived from Mr. Willard of the Guardian. This was one of the clouds on\r\nJethro's horizon, too, if men had but known it, and he took such moneys\r\nas Wetherell insisted upon giving him grudgingly enough. It is needless\r\nto say that he refrained from making use of Mr. Wetherell politically,\r\nalthough no poorer vessel for political purposes was ever constructed. It\r\nis quite as needless to say, perhaps, that Chester Perkins never got to\r\nbe Chairman of the Board of Selectmen.\r\n\r\nAfter Aunt Listy died, Jethro was more than ever to be found, when in\r\nConiston, in the garden or the kitchen behind the store. Yes, Aunt Listy\r\nis dead. She has flitted through these pages as she flitted through life\r\nitself, arrayed by Jethro like the rainbow, and quite as shadowy and\r\nunreal. There is no politician of a certain age in the state who does not\r\nremember her walking, clad in dragon-fly colors, through the streets of\r\nthe capital on Jethro's arm, or descending the stairs of the Pelican\r\nHouse to supper. None of Jethro's detractors may say that he ever failed\r\nin kindness to her, and he loved her as much as was in his heart to love\r\nany woman after Cynthia Ware. As for Aunt Listy, she never seemed to feel\r\nany resentment against the child Jethro brought so frequently to Thousand\r\nAcre Hill. Poor Aunt Listy! some people used to wonder whether she ever\r\nfelt any emotion at all. But I believe that she did, in her own way.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that Mr. Bijah Bixby came over from Clovelly, to\r\nrequest the place of superintendent of the funeral, a position which had\r\nalready been filled. A special office, too, was created on this occasion\r\nfor an old supporter of Jethro's, Senator Peleg Hartington of Brampton.\r\nHe was made chairman of the bearers, of whom Ephraim Prescott was one.\r\n\r\nAfter this, as we have said, Jethro was more than ever at the store--or\r\nrather in that domestic domain behind it which Wetherell and Cynthia\r\nshared with Miss Millicent Skinner. Moses Hatch was wont to ask Cynthia\r\nhow her daddies were. It was he who used to clear out the road to the\r\nlittle schoolhouse among the birches when the snow almost buried the\r\nlittle village, and on sparkling mornings after the storms his oxen would\r\nstop to breathe in front of the store, a cluster of laughing children\r\nclinging to the snow-plough and tumbling over good-natured Moses in their\r\nfrolics. Cynthia became a country girl, and grew long and lithe of limb,\r\nand weather-burnt, and acquired an endurance that spoke wonders for the\r\nlife-giving air of Coniston. But she was a serious child, and Wetherell\r\nand Jethro sometimes wondered whether she was ever a child at all. When\r\nEben Hatch fell from the lumber pile on the ice, it was she who bound the\r\ncut in his head; and when Tom Richardson unexpectedly embraced the\r\nschoolhouse stove, Cynthia, not Miss Rebecca Northcutt, took charge of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps inevitable, with such a helpless father, that the girl\r\nshould grow up with a sense of responsibility, being what she was. Did\r\nWilliam Wetherell go to Brampton, Cynthia examined his apparel, and he\r\nwas marched shamefacedly back to his room to change; did he read too late\r\nat night, some unseen messenger summoned her out of her sleep, and he was\r\npacked off to bed. Miss Millicent Skinner, too, was in a like mysterious\r\nway compelled to abdicate her high place in favor of Cynthia, and\r\nWetherell was utterly unable to explain how this miracle was\r\naccomplished. Not only did Millicent learn to cook, but Cynthia, at the\r\nage of fourteen, had taught her. Some wit once suggested that the\r\nnational arms of the United States should contain the emblem of crossed\r\nfrying-pans, and Millicent was in this respect a true American. When\r\nWetherell began to suffer from her pies and doughnuts, the revolution\r\ntook place--without stampeding, or recriminations, or trouble of any\r\nkind. One evening he discovered Cynthia, decked in an apron, bending over\r\nthe stove, and Millicent looking on with an expression that was (for\r\nMillicent) benign.\r\n\r\nThis was to some extent explained, a few days later, when Wetherell found\r\nhimself gazing across the counter at the motherly figure of Mrs. Moses\r\nHatch, who held the well-deserved honor of being the best cook in\r\nConiston.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't had so much stomach trouble lately, Will?\" she remarked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, surprised; \"Cynthia is learning to cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess she is,\" said Mrs. Moses. \"That gal is worth any seven grown-up\r\nwomen in town. And she was four nights settin' in my kitchen before I\r\nknowed what she was up to.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you taught her, Amanda?\r\n\r\n\"I taught her some. She callated that Milly was killin' you, and I guess\r\nshe was.\"\r\n\r\nDuring her school days, Jethro used frequently to find himself in front\r\nof the schoolhouse when the children came trooping out--quite by\r\naccident, of course. Winter or summer, when he went away on his\r\nperiodical trips, he never came back without a little remembrance in his\r\ncarpet bag, usually a book, on the subject of which he had spent hours in\r\nconference with the librarian at the state library at the capital. But in\r\nJune of the year when Cynthia was fifteen, Jethro yielded to that passion\r\nwhich was one of the man's strangest characteristics, and appeared one\r\nevening in the garden behind the store with a bundle which certainly did\r\nnot contain a book. With all the gravity of a ceremony he took off the\r\npaper, and held up in relief against the astonished Cynthia a length of\r\ncardinal cloth. William Wetherell, who was looking out of the window,\r\ndrew his breath, and even Jethro drew back with an exclamation at the\r\nchange wrought in her. But Cynthia snatched the roll from his hand and\r\nwound it up with a feminine deftness.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-what's the matter, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can't wear that, Uncle Jethro,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"C-can't wear it! Why not?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia sat down on the grassy mound under the apple tree and clasped her\r\nhands across her knees. She looked up at him and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see that I couldn't wear it, Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he demanded. \"Ch-change it if you've a mind to hev green.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and smiled at him a little sadly.\r\n\r\n\"T-took me a full hour to choose that, Cynthy,\" said he. \"H-had to go to\r\nBoston so I got it there.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, grievously disappointed at this reception of his gift,\r\nand he stood eying the cardinal cloth very mournfully as it lay on the\r\npaper. Cynthia, remorseful, reached up and seized his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down here, Uncle Jethro.\" He sat down on the mound beside her, very\r\nmuch perplexed. She still held his hand in hers. \"Uncle Jethro,\" she said\r\nslowly, \"you mustn't think I'm not grateful.\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no,\" he answered; \"I don't think that, Cynthy. I know you be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful--I'm very grateful for everything you give me, although I\r\nshould love you just as much if you didn't give me anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe was striving very hard not to offend him, for in some ways he was as\r\nsensitive as Wetherell himself. Even Coniston folk had laughed at the\r\nidiosyncrasy which Jethro had of dressing his wife in brilliant colors,\r\nand the girl knew this.\r\n\r\n\"G-got it for you to wear to Brampton on the Fourth of July, Cynthy,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro, I couldn't wear that to Brampton!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd look like a queen,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not a queen,\" objected Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Rather hev somethin' else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, looking at him suddenly with the gleam of laughter in\r\nher eyes, although she was on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Jethro demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cynthia, demurely gazing down at her ankles, \"shoes and\r\nstockings.\" The barefooted days had long gone by.\r\n\r\nJethro laughed. Perhaps some inkling of her reasons came to him, for he\r\nhad a strange and intuitive understanding of her. At any rate, he\r\naccepted her decision with a meekness which would have astonished many\r\npeople who knew only that side of him which he showed to the world.\r\nGently she released her hand, and folded up the bundle again and gave it\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"B-better keep it--hadn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you keep it. And I will wear it for you when I am rich, Uncle\r\nJethro.\"\r\n\r\nJethro did keep it, and in due time the cardinal cloth had its uses. But\r\nCynthia did not wear it on the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nThat was a great day for Brampton, being not only the nation's birthday,\r\nbut the hundredth year since the adventurous little band of settlers from\r\nConnecticut had first gazed upon Coniston Water at that place. Early in\r\nthe morning wagon loads began to pour into Brampton Street from Harwich,\r\nfrom Coniston, from Tarleton Four Corners, and even from distant\r\nClovelly, and Brampton was banner-hung for the occasion--flags across the\r\nstores, across the dwellings, and draped along the whole breadth of the\r\nmeeting-house; but for sheer splendor the newly built mansion of Isaac D.\r\nWorthington outshone them all. Although its owner was a professed\r\nbeliever in republican simplicity, no such edifice ornamented any town to\r\nthe west of the state capital. Small wonder that the way in front of it\r\nwas blocked by a crowd lost in admiration of its Gothic proportions! It\r\nstands to-day one of many monuments to its builder, with its windows of\r\none pane (unheard-of magnificence), its tower of stone, its porch with\r\npointed arches and scroll-work. No fence divides its grounds from the\r\npublic walk, and on the smooth-shaven lawn between the ornamental flower\r\nbeds and the walk stand two stern mastiffs of iron, emblematic of the\r\nsolidity and power of their owner. It was as much to see this house as to\r\nhear the oratory that the countryside flocked to Brampton that day.\r\n\r\nAll the day before Cynthia and Milly, and many another housewife, had\r\nbeen making wonderful things for the dinners they were to bring, and\r\nstowing them in the great basket ready for the early morning start. At\r\nsix o'clock Jethro's three-seated farm wagon was in front of the store.\r\nCousin Ephraim Prescott, in a blue suit and an army felt hat with a cord,\r\ngot up behind, a little stiffly by reason of that Wilderness bullet; and\r\nthere were also William Wetherell and Lem Hallowell, his honest face\r\nshining, and Sue, his wife, and young Sue and Jock and Lilian, all\r\na-quiver with excitement in their Sunday best.\r\n\r\nAnd as they drove away there trotted up behind them Moses and Amandy\r\nHatch, with their farm team, and all the little Hatches,--Eben and George\r\nand Judy and Liza. As they jogged along they drank in the fragrance of\r\nthe dew-washed meadows and the pines, and a great blue heron stood\r\nknee-deep on the far side of Deacon Lysander's old mill-pond, watching\r\nthem philosophically as they passed.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o'clock when they got into the press of Brampton Street, and\r\nthere was a hush as they made their way slowly through the throng, and\r\nmany a stare at the curious figure in the old-fashioned blue swallowtail\r\nand brass buttons and tall hat, driving the farm wagon. Husbands pointed\r\nhim out to their wives, young men to sisters and sweethearts, some\r\nopenly, some discreetly. \"There goes Jethro Bass,\" and some were bold\r\nenough to say, \"Howdy, Jethro?\" Jake Wheeler was to be observed in the\r\ncrowd ahead of them, hurried for once out of his Jethro step, actually\r\nrunning toward the tavern, lest such a one arrive unheralded. Commotion\r\nis perceived on the tavern porch,--Mr. Sherman, the proprietor, bustling\r\nout, Jake Wheeler beside him; a chorus of \"How be you, Jethros?\" from the\r\nmore courageous there,--but the farm team jogs on, leaving a discomfited\r\ngathering, into the side street, up an alley, and into the cool,\r\nammonia-reeking sheds of lank Jim Sanborn's livery stable. No\r\nobsequiousness from lank Jim, who has the traces slipped and the reins\r\nfestooned from the bits almost before Jethro has lifted Cynthia to the\r\nfloor. Jethro, walking between Cynthia and her father, led the way,\r\nEphraim, Lem, and Sue Hallowell following, the children, in unwonted\r\nshoes and stockings, bringing up the rear. The people parted, and\r\npresently they found themselves opposite the new-scrolled band stand\r\namong the trees, where the Harwich band in glittering gold and red had\r\njust been installed. The leader; catching sight of Jethro's party, and of\r\nEphraim's corded army hat, made a bow, waved his baton, and they struck\r\nup \"Marching through Georgia.\" It was, of course, not dignified to cheer,\r\nbut I think that the blood of every man and woman and child ran faster\r\nwith the music, and so many of them looked at Cousin Ephraim that he\r\nslipped away behind the line of wagons. So the day began.\r\n\r\n\"Jest to think of bein' that rich, Will!\" exclaimed Amanda Hatch to the\r\nstorekeeper, as they stood in the little group which had gathered in\r\nfront of the first citizen's new mansion. \"I own it scares me. Think how\r\nmuch that house must hev cost, and even them dogs,\" said Amanda, staring\r\nat the mastiffs with awe. \"They tell me he has a grand piano from New\r\nYork, and guests from Boston railroad presidents. I call Isaac\r\nWorthington to mind when he wahn't but a slip of a boy with a cough,\r\nrunnin' after Cynthy Ware.\" She glanced down at Cynthia with something of\r\ncompassion. \"Just to think, child, he might have be'n your father!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad he isn't,\" said Cynthia, hotly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" replied the good-natured and well-intentioned\r\nAmanda, \"I'd sooner have your father than Isaac Worthington. But I was\r\nonly thinkin' how nice it would be to be rich.\"\r\n\r\nJust then one of the glass-panelled doors of this house opened, and a\r\ngood-looking lad of seventeen came out.\r\n\r\n\"That's Bob Worthington,\" said Amanda, determined that they should miss\r\nnothing. \"My! it wahn't but the other day when he put on long pants. It\r\nwon't be a great while before he'll go into the mills and git all that\r\nmoney. Guess he'll marry some city person. He'd ought to take you,\r\nCynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want him,\" said Cynthia, the color flaming into her cheeks. And\r\nshe went off across the green in search of Jethro.\r\n\r\nThere was a laugh from the honest country folk who had listened. Bob\r\nWorthington came to the edge of the porch and stood there, frankly\r\nscanning the crowd, with an entire lack of self-consciousness. Some of\r\nthem shifted nervously, with the New Englander's dislike of being caught\r\nin the act of sight-seeing.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is he starin' at me for?\" said Amanda, backing behind\r\nthe bulkier form of her husband. \"As I live, I believe he's comin' here.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington was, indeed, descending the steps and walking\r\nacross the lawn toward them, nodding and smiling to acquaintances as he\r\npassed. To Wetherell's astonishment he made directly for the place where\r\nhe was standing and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Wetherell?\" he said. \"Perhaps you don't remember\r\nme,--Bob Worthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that I should have known you,\" answered the storekeeper. They\r\nwere all absurdly silent, thinking of nothing to say and admiring the boy\r\nbecause he was at ease.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have a good seat at the exercises,\" he said, pressing\r\nWetherell's hand again, and before he could thank him, Bob was off in the\r\ndirection of the band stand.\r\n\r\n\"One thing,\" remarked Amanda, \"he ain't much like his dad. You'd never\r\ncatch Isaac Worthington bein' that common.\"\r\n\r\nJust then there came another interruption for William Wetherell, who was\r\nstartled by the sound of a voice in his ear--a nasal voice that awoke\r\nunpleasant recollections. He turned to confront, within the distance of\r\neight inches, the face of Mr. Bijah Bixby of Clovelly screwed up into a\r\ngreeting. The storekeeper had met Mr. Bixby several times since that\r\nfirst memorable meeting, and on each occasion, as now, his hand had made\r\nan involuntary movement to his watch pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't seed you for some time, Will,\" remarked Mr. Bixby; \"goin' over to\r\nthe exercises? We'll move along that way,\" and he thrust his hand under\r\nMr. Wetherell's elbow. \"Whar's Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's here somewhere,\" answered the storekeeper, helplessly, moving along\r\nin spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Keepin' out of sight, you understand,\" said Bijah, with a knowing wink,\r\nas much as to say that Mr. Wetherell was by this time a past master in\r\nJethro tactics. Mr. Bixby could never disabuse his mind of a certain\r\ninterpretation which he put on the storekeeper's intimacy with Jethro.\r\n\"You done well to git in with him, Will. Didn't think you had it in you\r\nwhen I first looked you over.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell wished to make an indignant denial, but he didn't know\r\nexactly how to begin.\r\n\r\n\"Smartest man in the United States of America--guess you know that,\" Mr.\r\nBixby continued amiably. \"They can't git at him unless he wants 'em to.\r\nThere's a railroad president at Isaac Worthington's who'd like to git at\r\nhim to-day,--guess you know that,--Steve Merrill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell didn't know, but he was given no time to say so.\r\n\r\n\"Steve Merrill, of the Grand Gulf and Northern. He hain't here to see\r\nWorthington; he's here to see Jethro, when Jethro's a mind to. Guess you\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about it,\" answered Wetherell, shortly. Mr. Bixby gave\r\nhim a look of infinite admiration, as though he could not have pursued\r\nany more admirable line.\r\n\r\n\"I know Steve Merrill better'n I know you,\" said Mr. Bixby, \"and he knows\r\nme. Whenever he sees me at the state capital he says, 'How be you, Bije?'\r\njust as natural as if I was a railroad president, and slaps me on the\r\nback. When be you goin' to the capital, Will? You'd ought to come down\r\nand be thar with the boys on this Truro Bill. You could reach some on 'em\r\nthe rest of us couldn't git at.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell avoided a reply to this very pointed inquiry by\r\nescaping into the meeting-house, where he found Jethro and Cynthia and\r\nEphraim already seated halfway up the aisle.\r\n\r\nOn the platform, behind a bank of flowers, are the velvet covered chairs\r\nwhich contain the dignitaries of the occasion. The chief of these is, of\r\ncourse, Mr. Isaac Worthington, the one with the hawk-like look, sitting\r\nnext to the Rev. Mr. Sweet, who is rather pudgy by contrast. On the other\r\nside of Mr. Sweet, next to the parlor organ and the quartette, is the\r\ngenial little railroad president Mr. Merrill, batting the flies which\r\nassail the unprotected crown of his head, and smiling benignly on the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his eye becomes fixed, and he waves a fat hand vigorously at\r\nJethro, who answers the salute with a nod of unwonted cordiality for him.\r\nThen comes a hush, and the exercises begin.\r\n\r\nThere is a prayer, of course, by the Rev. Mr. Sweet, and a rendering of\r\n\"My Country\" and \"I would not Change my Lot,\" and other choice selections\r\nby the quartette; and an original poem recited with much feeling by a\r\nlady admirer of Miss Lucretia Penniman, and the \"Hymn to Coniston\"\r\ndeclaimed by Mr. Gamaliel Ives, president of the Brampton Literary Club.\r\nBut the crowning event is, of course, the oration by Mr. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington, the first citizen, who is introduced under that title by the\r\nchairman of the day; and as the benefactor of Brampton, who has bestowed\r\nupon the town the magnificent gift which was dedicated such a short time\r\nago, the Worthington Free Library.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaac D. Worthington stood erect beside the table, his hand thrust\r\ninto the opening of his coat, and spoke at the rate of one hundred and\r\neight words a minute, for exactly one hour. He sketched with much skill\r\nthe creed of the men who had fought their way through the forests to\r\nbuild their homes by Coniston Water, who had left their clearings to risk\r\ntheir lives behind Stark and Ethan Allen for that creed; he paid a\r\ngraceful tribute to the veterans of the Civil War, scattered among his\r\nhearers--a tribute, by the way, which for some reason made Ephraim very\r\nindignant. Mr. Worthington went on to outline the duty of citizens of the\r\npresent day, as he conceived it, and in this connection referred, with\r\nbecoming modesty, to the Worthington Free Library. He had made his money\r\nin Brampton, and it was but right that he should spend it for the benefit\r\nof the people of Brampton. The library, continued Mr. Worthington when\r\nthe applause was over, had been the dream of a certain delicate youth who\r\nhad come, many years ago, to Brampton for his health. (It is a curious\r\nfact, by the way, that Mr. Worthington seldom recalled the delicate youth\r\nnow, except upon public occasions.)\r\n\r\nYes, the dream of that youth had been to benefit in some way that\r\ncommunity in which circumstances had decreed that he should live, and in\r\nthis connection it might not be out of place to mention a bill then\r\nbefore the Legislature of the state, now in session. If the bill became a\r\nlaw, the greatest modern factor of prosperity, the railroad, would come\r\nto Brampton. The speaker was interrupted here by more applause. Mr.\r\nWorthington did not deem it dignified or necessary to state that the\r\nrailroad to which he referred was the Truro Railroad; and that he, as the\r\nlargest stockholder, might indirectly share that prosperity with\r\nBrampton. That would be wandering too far, from his subject, which, it\r\nwill be recalled, was civic duties. He took a glass of water, and went on\r\nto declare that he feared--sadly feared--that the ballot was not held as\r\nsacred as it had once been. He asked the people of Brampton, and of the\r\nstate, to stop and consider who in these days made the laws and granted\r\nthe franchises. Whereupon he shook his head very slowly and sadly, as\r\nmuch as to imply that, if the Truro Bill did not pass, the corruption of\r\nthe ballot was to blame. No, Mr. Worthington could think of no better\r\nsubject on this Birthday of Independence than a recapitulation of the\r\ncreed of our forefathers, from which we had so far wandered.\r\n\r\nIn short, the first citizen, as became him, had delivered the first\r\nreform speech ever heard in Brampton, and the sensation which it created\r\nwas quite commensurate to the occasion. The presence in the audience of\r\nJethro Bass, at whom many believed the remarks to have been aimed, added\r\nno little poignancy to that sensation, although Jethro gave no outward\r\nsigns of the terror and remorse by which he must have been struck while\r\nlistening to Mr. Worthington's ruminations of the corruption of the\r\nballot. Apparently unconscious of the eyes upon him, he walked out of the\r\nmeeting-house with Cynthia by his side, and they stood waiting for\r\nWetherell and Ephraim under the maple tree there.\r\n\r\nThe be-ribboned members of the Independence Day committee were now on the\r\nsteps, and behind them came Isaac Worthington and Mr. Merrill. The\r\npeople, scenting a dramatic situation, lingered. Would the mill owner\r\nspeak to the boss? The mill owner, with a glance at the boss, did nothing\r\nof the kind, but immediately began to talk rapidly to Mr. Merrill. That\r\ngentleman, however, would not be talked to, but came running over to\r\nJethro and seized his hand, leaving Mr. Worthington to walk on by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" cried the little railroad president, \"upon my word. Well, well.\r\nAnd Miss Jethro,\" he took off his hat to Cynthia, \"well, well. Didn't\r\nknow you had a girl, Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-wish she was mine, Steve,\" said Jethro. \"She's a good deal to me as it\r\nis. Hain't you, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Mr. Merrill, staring at her, \"you'll have to look out\r\nfor her some day--keep the boys away from her--eh? Upon my word! Well,\r\nJethro,\" said he, with a twinkle in his eye, \"are you goin' to reform?\r\nI'll bet you've got an annual over my road in your pocket right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enjoy the speech-makin', Steve?\" inquired Mr. Bass, solemnly.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill winked at Jethro, and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the boys away from her, Jethro,\" he repeated, laying his hand on\r\nthe shoulder of the lad who stood beside him. \"It's a good thing Bob's\r\ngoing off to Harvard this fall. Seems to me I heard about some cutting up\r\nat Andover--eh, Bob?\"\r\n\r\nBob grinned, showing a line of very white teeth.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill took Jethro by the arm and led him off a little distance,\r\nhaving a message of some importance to give him, the purport of which\r\nwill appear later. And Cynthia and Bob were left face to face. Of course\r\nBob could have gone on, if he had wished it.\r\n\r\n\"Don't remember me, do you?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I do now,\" said Cynthia, looking at him rather timidly through her\r\nlashes. Her face was hot, and she had been, very uncomfortable during Mr.\r\nMerrill's remarks. Furthermore, Bob had not taken his eyes off her.\r\n\r\n\"I remembered you right away,\" he said reproachfully; \"I saw you in front\r\nof the house this morning, and you ran away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't runaway,\" replied Cynthia, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"It looked like it, to me,\" said Bob.. \"I suppose you were afraid I was\r\ngoing to give you anther whistle.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia bit her lip, and then she laughed. Then she looked around to see\r\nwhere Jethro was, and discovered that they were alone in front of the\r\nmeeting-house. Ephraim and her father had passed on while Mr. Merrill was\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Bob.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they've gone,\" said Cynthia. \"I ought to be going after them.\r\nThey'll miss me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, they won't,\" said Bob, easily, \"let's sit down under the tree.\r\nThey'll come back.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he sat down under the maple. But Cynthia remained standing,\r\nready to fly. She had an idea that it was wrong to stay--which made it\r\nall the more delightful.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down--Cynthia,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe glanced down at him, startled. He was sitting, with his legs crossed,\r\nlooking up at her intently.\r\n\r\n\"I like that name,\" he observed. \"I like it better than any girl's name I\r\nknow. Do be good-natured and sit down.\" And he patted the ground close\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nShy laughed again. The laugh had in it an exquisite note of shyness,\r\nwhich he liked.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want me to sit down?\" she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Because I want to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you talk to me standing up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I could,\" said Bob, \"but--I shouldn't be able to say such nice\r\nthings to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe corners of her mouth trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\"And whose loss would that be?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nBob Worthington was surprised at this retort, and correspondingly\r\ndelighted. He had not expected it in a country storekeeper's daughter,\r\nand he stared at Cynthia so frankly that she blushed again, and turned\r\naway. He was a young man who, it may be surmised, had had some experience\r\nwith the other sex at Andover and elsewhere. He had not spent all of his\r\nlife in Brampton.\r\n\r\n\"I've often thought of you since that day when you wouldn't take the\r\nwhistle,\" he declared. \"What are you laughing at?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm laughing at you,\" said Cynthia, leaning against the tree, with her\r\nhands behind her.\r\n\r\n\"You've been laughing at me ever since you've stood there,\" he said,\r\naggrieved that his declarations should not betaken more seriously.\r\n\r\n\"What have you thought about me?\" she demanded. She was really beginning\r\nto enjoy this episode.\r\n\r\n\"Well--\" he began, and hesitated--and broke down and laughed--Cynthia\r\nlaughed with him.\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you what I didn't think,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Cynthia, falling into the trap.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think you'd be so--so good-looking,\" said he, quite boldly.\r\n\r\n\"And I didn't think you'd be so rude,\" responded Cynthia. But though she\r\nblushed again, she was not exactly displeased.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do this afternoon?\" he asked. \"Let's go for a\r\nwalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going back to Coniston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go for a walk now,\" said he, springing to his feet. \"Come on.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia looked at him and shook her head smilingly.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Uncle Jethro--\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro!\" exclaimed Bob, \"is he your uncle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not really. But he's just the same. He's very good to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder whether he'd mind if I called him Uncle Jethro, too,\" said Bob,\r\nand Cynthia laughed at the notion. This young man was certainly very\r\ncomical, and very frank. \"Good-by,\" he said; \"I'll come to see you some\r\nday in Coniston.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThat evening, after Cynthia had gone to bed, William Wetherell sat down\r\nat Jonah Winch's desk in the rear of the store to gaze at a blank sheet\r\nof paper until the Muses chose to send him subject matter for his weekly\r\nletter to the Guardian. The window was open, and the cool airs from the\r\nmountain spruces mingled with the odors of corn meal and kerosene and\r\ncalico print. Jethro Bass, who had supped with the storekeeper, sat in\r\nthe wooden armchair silent, with his head bent. Sometimes he would sit\r\nthere by the hour while Wetherell wrote or read, and take his departure\r\nwhen he was so moved without saying good night. Presently Jethro lifted\r\nhis chin, and dropped it again; there was a sound of wheels without, and,\r\nafter an interval, a knock at the door.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell dropped his pen with a start of surprise, as it was\r\nlate for a visitor in Coniston. He glanced at Jethro, who did not move,\r\nand then he went to the door and shot back the great forged bolt of it,\r\nand stared out. On the edge of the porch stood a tallish man in a\r\ndouble-breasted frock coat.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington!\" exclaimed the storekeeper.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington coughed and pulled at one of his mutton-chop whiskers,\r\nand seemed about to step off the porch again. It was, indeed, the first\r\ncitizen and reformer of Brampton. No wonder William Wetherell was\r\nmystified.\r\n\r\n\"Can I do anything for you?\" he asked. \"Have you missed your way?\"\r\n\r\nWetherell thought he heard him muttering, \"No, no,\" and then he was\r\nstartled by another voice in his ear. It was Jethro who was standing\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess he hain't missed his way a great deal. Er--come in--come in.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington took a couple of steps forward.\r\n\r\n\"I understood that you were to be alone,\" he remarked, addressing Jethro\r\nwith an attempted severity of manner.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't say so--d-didn't say so, did I?\" answered Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Worthington, \"any other time will do for this\r\nlittle matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--good night,\" said Jethro, shortly, and there was the suspicion of a\r\ngleam in his eye as Mr. Worthington turned away. The mill-owner, in fact,\r\ndid not get any farther than the edge of the porch before he wheeled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"The affair which I have to discuss with you is of a private nature, Mr.\r\nBass,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"So I callated,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"You may have the place to yourselves, gentlemen,\" Wetherell put in\r\nuneasily, and then Mr. Worthington came as far as the door, where he\r\nstood looking at the storekeeper with scant friendliness. Jethro turned\r\nto Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"You a politician, Will?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"You a business man?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said again.\r\n\r\n\"You ever tell folks what you hear other people say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" the storekeeper answered; \"I'm not interested in other\r\npeople's business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Jethro. \"Guess you'd better stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't care to stay,\" Wetherell objected.\r\n\r\n\"Stay to oblige me--stay to oblige me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, if you put it that way,\" Wetherell said, beginning to get\r\nsome amusement out of the situation.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what Jethro's object was in this matter; perhaps others\r\nmay guess.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington, who had stood by with ill-disguised impatience during\r\nthis colloquy, note broke in.\r\n\r\n\"It is most unusual, Mr. Bass, to have a third person present at a\r\nconference in which he has no manner of concern. I think on the whole,\r\nsince you have insisted upon my coming to you--\"\r\n\r\n\"H-hain't insisted that I know of,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Worthington, \"never mind that.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would be better for me to come to you some other time, when\r\nyou are alone.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Wetherell had shut the door, and they had gradually\r\nwalked to the rear of the store. Jethro parted his coat tails, and sat\r\ndown again in the armchair. Wetherell, not wishing to be intrusive, went\r\nto his desk again, leaving the first citizen standing among the barrels.\r\n\r\n\"W-what other time?\" Jethro asked.\r\n\r\n\"Any other time,\" said Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"What other time?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow night?\" suggested Mr. Worthington, striving to hide his\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\"B-busy to-morrow night,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"You know that what I have to talk to you about is of the utmost\r\nimportance,\" said Worthington. \"Let us say Saturday night.\"\r\n\r\n\"B-busy Saturday night,\" said Jethro. \"Meet you to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Noon,\" said Jethro, \"noon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked Mr. Worthington, dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"Band stand in Brampton Street,\" said Jethro, and the storekeeper was\r\nfain to bend over his desk to conceal his laughter, busying himself with\r\nhis books. Mr. Worthington sat down with as much dignity as he could\r\nmuster on one of Jonah's old chairs, and Jonah Winch's clock ticked and\r\nticked, and Wetherell's pen scratched and scratched on his weekly letter\r\nto Mr. Willard, although he knew that he was writing the sheerest\r\nnonsense. As a matter of fact, he tore up the sheets the next morning\r\nwithout reading them. Mr. Worthington unbuttoned his coat, fumbled in his\r\npocket, and pulled out two cigars, one of which he pushed toward Jethro,\r\nwho shook his head. Mr. Worthington lighted his cigar and cleared his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have observed, Mr. Bass,\" he said, \"that this is a rapidly\r\ngrowing section of the state--that the people hereabouts are every day\r\ndemanding modern and efficient means of communication with the outside\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Struck you as a mill owner, has it?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I do not care to emphasize my private interests,\" answered Mr.\r\nWorthington, at last appearing to get into his stride again. \"I wish to\r\nput the matter on broader grounds. Men like you and me ought not to be so\r\nmuch concerned with our own affairs as with those of the population\r\namongst whom we live. And I think I am justified in putting it to you on\r\nthese grounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-have to be justified, do you--have to be justified?\" Jethro inquired.\r\n\"Er--why?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a poser, and for a moment he stared at Jethro, blankly, until he\r\ndecided how to take it. Then he crossed his legs and blew smoke toward\r\nthe ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly fairer to everybody to take the broadest view of a\r\nsituation,\" he remarked; \"I am trying to regard this from the aspect of a\r\ncitizen, and I am quite sure that it will appeal to you in the same\r\nlight. If the spirit which imbued the founders of this nation means\r\nanything, Mr. Bass, it means that the able men who are given a chance to\r\nrise by their own efforts must still retain the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the humblest citizens. That, I take it, is our\r\nposition, Mr. Bass,--yours and mine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington had uncrossed his legs, and was now by the inspiration of\r\nhis words impelled to an upright position. Suddenly he glanced at Jethro,\r\nand started for Jethro had sunk down on the small of his back, his chin\r\non his chest, in an attitude of lassitude if not of oblivion. There was a\r\nsilence perhaps a little disconcerting for Mr. Worthington, who chose the\r\nopportunity to relight his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"G-got through?\" said Jethro, without moving, \"g-got through?\"\r\n\r\n\"Through?\" echoed Mr. Worthington, \"through what?\"\r\n\r\n\"T-through Sunday-school,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nWorthington dropped his match and stamped on it, and Wetherell began to\r\nwonder how much the man would stand. It suddenly came over the\r\nstorekeeper that the predicament in which Mr. Worthington found himself\r\nwhatever it was--must be a very desperate one. He half rose in his chair,\r\nsat down again, and lighted another match.\r\n\r\n\"Er--director in the Truro Road, hain't you, Mr. Worthington?\" asked\r\nJethro, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--principal stockholder--ain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but that is neither here nor there, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Road don't pay--r-road don't pay, does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly does not.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-would pay if it went to Brampton and Harwich?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass, the company consider that they are pledged to the people of\r\nthis section to get the road through. I am not prepared to say whether\r\nthe road would pay, but it is quite likely that it would not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ch-charitable organization?\" said Jethro, from the depths of his chair.\r\n\r\n\"The pioneers in such matters take enormous risks for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity, sir. We believe that we are entitled to a franchise, and in my\r\nopinion the General Court are behaving disgracefully in refusing us one.\r\nI will not say all I think about that affair, Mr. Bass. I am convinced\r\nthat influences are at work--\" He broke off with a catch in his throat.\r\n\r\n\"T-tried to get a franchise, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not here to quibble with you, Mr. Bass. We tried to get it by every\r\nlegitimate means, and failed, and you know it as well as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--Heth Sutton didn't sign his receipt--er--did he?\"\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper, not being a politician, was not aware that the somewhat\r\nobscure reference of Jethro's to the Speaker of the House concerned an\r\napplication which Mr. Worthington was supposed to have made to that\r\ngentleman, who had at length acknowledged his inability to oblige, and\r\nhad advised Mr. Worthington to go to headquarters. And Mr. Stephen\r\nMerrill, who had come to Brampton out of the kindness of his heart, had\r\nonly arranged this meeting in a conversation with Jethro that day, after\r\nthe reform speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington sprang to his feet, and flung out a hand toward Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Prove your insinuations, air,\" he cried; \"I defy you to prove your\r\ninsinuations.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jethro still sat unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"H-Heth in the charitable organization, too?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"People told me I was a fool to believe in honesty, but I thought better\r\nof the lawmakers of my state. I'll tell you plainly what they said to me,\r\nsir. They said, 'Go to Jethro Bass.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so you have, hain't you? So you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have. I've come to appeal to you in behalf of the people of your\r\nsection to allow that franchise to go through the present Legislature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--come to appeal, have you--come to appeal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Worthington, sitting down again; \"I have come to-night to\r\nappeal to you in the name of the farmers and merchants of this\r\nregion--your neighbors,--to use your influence to get that franchise. I\r\nhave come to you with the conviction that I shall not have appealed in\r\nvain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--appealed to Heth in the name of the farmers and merchants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sutton is Speaker of the House.\"\r\n\r\n\"F-farmers and merchants elected him,\" remarked Jethro, as though stating\r\na fact.\r\n\r\nWorthington coughed.\r\n\r\n\"It is probable that I made a mistake in going to Sutton,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\n\"If I w-wanted to catch a pike, w-wouldn't use a pin-hook.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have known,\" remarked Worthington, after a pause, \"that Sutton\r\ncould not have been elected Speaker without your influence.\"\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer that, but still remained sunk in his chair. To all\r\nappearances he might have been asleep.\r\n\r\n\"W-worth somethin' to the farmers and merchants to get that road\r\nthrough--w-worth somethin', ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nWetherell held his breath. For a moment Mr. Worthington sat very still,\r\nhis face drawn, and then he wet his lips and rose slowly.\r\n\r\n\"We may as well end this conversation, Mr. Bass,\" he said, and though he\r\ntried to speak firmly his voice shook, \"it seems to be useless. Good\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up his hat and walked slowly toward the door, but Jethro did\r\nnot move or speak. Mr. Worthington reached the door opened it, and the\r\nnight breeze started the lamp to smoking. Wetherell got up and turned it\r\ndown, and the first citizen was still standing in the doorway. His back\r\nwas toward them, but the fingers of his left hand--working convulsively\r\ncaught Wetherell's eye and held it; save for the ticking of the clock and\r\nthe chirping of the crickets in the grass, there was silence. Then Mr.\r\nWorthington closed the door softly, hesitated, turned, and came back and\r\nstood before Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass,\" he said, \"we've got to have that franchise.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell glanced at the countryman who, without moving in his\r\nchair, without raising his voice, had brought the first citizen of\r\nBrampton to his knees. The thing frightened the storekeeper, revolted\r\nhim, and yet its drama held him fascinated. By some subtle process which\r\nhe had actually beheld, but could not fathom, this cold Mr. Worthington,\r\nthis bank president who had given him sage advice, this preacher of\r\npolitical purity, had been reduced to a frenzied supplicant. He stood\r\nbending over Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"What's your price? Name it, for God's sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"B-better wait till you get the bill--hadn't you? b-better wait till you\r\nget the bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you put the franchise through?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goin' down to the capital soon?\" Jethro inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going down on Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"B-better come in and see me,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" answered Mr. Worthington; \"I'll be in at two o'clock on\r\nThursday.\" And then, without another word to either of them, he swung on\r\nhis heel and strode quickly out of the store. Jethro did not move.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell's hand was trembling so that he could not write, and he\r\ncould not trust his voice to speak. Although Jethro had never mentioned\r\nIsaac Worthington's name to him, Wetherell knew that Jethro hated the\r\nfirst citizen of Brampton.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the sound of the wheels had died away, Jethro broke the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Er--didn't laugh--did he, Will? Didn't laugh once--did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Laugh!\" echoed the storekeeper, who himself had never been further from\r\nlaughter in his life.\r\n\r\n\"M-might have let him off easier if he'd laughed,\" said Jethro, \"if he'd\r\nlaughed just once, m-might have let him off easier.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this remark he went out of the store and left Wetherell alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe weekly letter to the Newcastle Guardian was not finished that night,\r\nbut Coniston slept, peacefully, unaware of Mr. Worthington's visit; and\r\nnever, indeed, discovered it, since the historian for various reasons of\r\nhis own did not see fit to insert the event in his plan of the Town\r\nHistory. Before another sun had set Jethro Bass had departed for the\r\nstate capital, not choosing to remain to superintend the haying of the\r\nmany farms which had fallen into his hand,--a most unusual omission for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPresently rumors of a mighty issue about the Truro Railroad began to be\r\ndiscussed by the politicians at the Coniston store, and Jake Wheeler held\r\nhimself in instant readiness to answer a summons to the capital--which\r\nnever came.\r\n\r\nDelegations from Brampton and Harwich went to petition the Legislature\r\nfor the franchise, and the Brampton Clarion and Harwich Sentinel declared\r\nthat the people of Truro County recognized in Isaac Worthington a great\r\nand public-spirited man, who ought by all means to be the next\r\ngovernor--if the franchise went through.\r\n\r\nOne evening Lem Hallowell, after depositing a box of trimmings at Ephraim\r\nPrescott's harness shop, drove up to the platform of the store with the\r\nremark that \"things were gittin' pretty hot down to the capital in that\r\nfranchise fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hain't you b'en sent for yet, Jake?\" he cried, throwing his reins over\r\nthe backs of his sweating Morgans; \"well, that's strange. Guess the fight\r\nhain't as hot as we hear about. Jethro hain't had to call out his best\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a-goin' down if there's trouble,\" declared Jake, who consistently\r\nignored banter.\r\n\r\n\"Better git up and git,\" said Lem; \"there's three out of the five\r\nrailroads against Truro, and Steve Merrill layin' low. Bije Bixby's down\r\nthere, and Heth Sutton, and Abner Parkinson, and all the big bugs. Better\r\nget aboard, Jake.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the discussion was interrupted by the sight of Cynthia\r\nWetherell coming across the green with an open letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"It's a message from Uncle Jethro,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was sufficient to warrant the sensation it produced on\r\nall sides.\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't a letter from Jethro, is it?\" exclaimed Sam Price, overcome by a\r\npardonable curiosity. For it was well known that one of Jethro's fixed\r\nprinciples in life was embodied in his own motto, \"Don't write--send.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very funny,\" answered Cynthia, looking down at the paper with a\r\npuzzled expression. \"'Dear Cynthia: Judge Bass wished me to say to you\r\nthat he would be pleased if you and Will would come to the capital and\r\nspend a week with him at the Pelican House, and see the sights. The judge\r\nsays Rias Richardson will tend store. Yours truly, P. Hartington.' That's\r\nall,\" said Cynthia, looking up.\r\n\r\nFor a moment you could have heard a pine needle drop on the stoop. Then\r\nRias thrust his hands in his pockets and voiced the general sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be--goldurned!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't say nothin' about Jake?\" queried Lem.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Cynthia, \"that's all--except two pieces of cardboard with\r\nsomething about the Truro Railroad and our names. I don't know what they\r\nare.\" And she took them from the envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I could tell you if I was pressed,\" said Lem, amid a shout of\r\nmerriment from the group.\r\n\r\n\"Air you goin', Will?\" said Sam Price, pausing with his foot on the step\r\nof his buggy, that he might have the complete news before he left.\r\n\r\n\"Godfrey, Will,\" exclaimed Rigs, breathlessly, \"you hain't a-goin' to\r\nthrow up a chance to stay a hull week at the Pelican, be you?\" The mere\r\npossibility of refusal overpowered Rias.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with that delightful French song which treats of\r\nthe leave-taking of one Monsieur Dumollet will appreciate, perhaps, the\r\nattentions which were showered upon William Wetherell and Cynthia upon\r\ntheir departure for the capital next morning. Although Mr. Wetherell had\r\nat one time been actually a resident of Boston, he received quite as many\r\ncautions from his neighbors as Monsieur Dumollet. Billets doux and\r\npistols were, of course, not mentioned, but it certainly behooved him,\r\nwhen he should have arrived at that place of intrigues, to be on the\r\nlookout for cabals.\r\n\r\nThey took the stage-coach from Brampton over the pass: picturesque\r\nstage-coach with its apple-green body and leather springs, soon to be\r\nlaid away forever if the coveted Truro Franchise Bill becomes a law;\r\nstage-coach which pulls up defiantly beside its own rival at Truro\r\nstation, where our passengers take the train down the pleasant waterways\r\nand past the little white villages among the fruit trees to the capital.\r\nThe thrill of anticipation was in Cynthia's blood, and the flush of\r\npleasure on her cheeks, when they stopped at last under the sheds. The\r\nconductor snapped his fingers and cried, \"This way, Judge,\" and there was\r\nJethro in his swallow-tailed coat and stove-pipe hat awaiting them. He\r\nseized Wetherell's carpet-bag with one hand and Cynthia's arm with the\r\nother, and shouldered his way through the people, who parted when they\r\nsaw who it was.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" cried Cynthia, breathlessly, \"I didn't know you were a\r\njudge. What are you judge of?\"\r\n\r\n\"J-judge of clothes, Cynthy. D-don't you wish you had the red cloth to\r\nwear here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" said Cynthia. \"I'm glad enough to be here without it.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-glad to hev you in any fixin's, Cynthy,\" he said, giving her arm a\r\nlittle squeeze, and by that time they were up the hill and William\r\nWetherell quite winded. For Jethro was strong as an ox, and Cynthia's\r\nmuscles were like an Indian's.\r\n\r\nThey were among the glories of Main Street now. The capital was then, and\r\nstill remains, a typically beautiful New England city, with wide streets\r\nshaded by shapely maples and elms, with substantial homes set back amidst\r\nlawns and gardens. Here on Main Street were neat brick business buildings\r\nand banks and shops, with the park-like grounds of the Capitol farther\r\non, and everywhere, from curb to doorway, were knots of men talking\r\npolitics; broad-faced, sunburned farmers in store clothes, with beards\r\nthat hid their shirt fronts; keen-featured, sallow, country lawyers in\r\nlong black coats crumpled from much sitting on the small of the back;\r\ncountry storekeepers with shrewd eyes, and local proprietors and\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro, I didn't know you were such a great man,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"H-how did ye find out, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"The way people treat you here. I knew you were great, of course,\" she\r\nhastened to add.\r\n\r\n\"H-how do they treat me?\" he asked, looking down at her.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" she answered. \"They all stop talking when you come along and\r\nstare at you. But why don't you speak to them?\"\r\n\r\nJethro smiled and squeezed her arm again, and then they were in the\r\ncorridor of the famous Pelican Hotel, hazy with cigar smoke and filled\r\nwith politicians. Some were standing, hanging on to pillars,\r\ngesticulating, some were ranged in benches along the wall, and a chosen\r\nfew were in chairs grouped around the spittoons. Upon the appearance of\r\nJethro's party, the talk was hushed, the groups gave way, and they\r\naccomplished a kind of triumphal march to the desk. The clerk, descrying\r\nthem, desisted abruptly from a conversation across the cigar counter, and\r\nwith all the form of a ceremony dipped the pen with a flourish into the\r\nink and handed it to Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Your rooms are ready, Judge,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs they started for the stairs, Jethro and Cynthia leading the way,\r\nWetherell felt a touch on his elbow and turned to confront Mr. Bijah\r\nBixby--at very close range, as usual.\r\n\r\n\"C-come down at last, Will?\" he said. \"Thought ye would. Need everybody\r\nthis time--you understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came on pleasure,\" retorted Mr. Wetherell, somewhat angrily.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby appeared hugely to enjoy the joke.\r\n\r\n\"So I callated,\" he cried, still holding Wetherell's hand in a mild, but\r\npersuasive grip. \"So I callated. Guess I done you an injustice, Will.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a leetle mite smarter than I thought you was. So long. Got a\r\nleetle business now--you understand a leetle business.\"\r\n\r\nWas it possible, indeed, for the simple-minded to come to the capital and\r\nnot become involved in cabals? With some misgivings William Wetherell\r\nwatched Mr. Bixby disappear among the throng, kicking up his heels\r\nbehind, and then went upstairs. On the first floor Cynthia was standing\r\nby an open door.\r\n\r\n\"Dad,\" she cried, \"come and see the rooms Uncle Jethro's got for us!\" She\r\ntook Wetherell's hand and led him in. \"See the lace curtains, and the\r\nchandelier, and the big bureau with the marble top.\"\r\n\r\nJethro had parted his coat tails and seated himself enjoyably on the bed.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't come often,\" he said, \"m-might as well have the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" said Wetherell, coughing nervously and fumbling in the pocket\r\nof his coat, \"you've been very kind to us, and we hardly know how to\r\nthank you. I--I didn't have any use for these.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out the pieces of cardboard which had come in Cynthia's letter.\r\nHe dared not look at Jethro, and his eye was fixed instead upon the\r\nsomewhat grandiose signature of Isaac D. Worthington, which they bore.\r\nJethro took them and tore them up, and slowly tossed the pieces into a\r\ncuspidor conveniently situated near the foot of the bed. He rose and\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Er--when you get freshened up, come into Number 7,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNumber 7! But we shall come to that later. Supper first, in a great\r\npillared dining room filled with notables, if we only had the key. Jethro\r\nsits silent at the head of the table eating his crackers and milk, with\r\nCynthia on his left and William Wetherell on his right. Poor William,\r\ngreatly embarrassed by his sudden projection into the limelight, is\r\nhelpless in the clutches of a lady-waitress who is demanding somewhat\r\nfiercely that he make an immediate choice from a list of dishes which she\r\nis shooting at him with astonishing rapidity. But who is this, sitting\r\nbeside him, who comes to William's rescue, and demands that the lady\r\nrepeat the bill of fare? Surely a notable, for he has a generous\r\npresence, and jet-black whiskers which catch the light, which give the\r\ngentleman, as Mr. Bixby remarked, \"quite a settin'.\" Yes, we have met him\r\nat last. It is none other than the Honorable Heth Sutton, Rajah of\r\nClovelly, Speaker of the House, who has condescended to help Mr.\r\nWetherell.\r\n\r\nHis chamberlain, Mr. Bijah Bixby, sits on the other side of the Honorable\r\nHeth, and performs the presentation of Mr. Wetherell. But Mr. Sutton, as\r\nbecomes a man of high position, says little after he has rebuked the\r\nwaitress, and presently departs with a carefully chosen toothpick;\r\nwhereupon Mr. Bixby moves into the vacant seat--not to Mr. Wetherell's\r\nunqualified delight.\r\n\r\n\"I've knowed him ever sense we was boys,\" said Mr. Bixby; \"you saw how\r\nintimate we was. When he wants a thing done, he says, 'Bije, you go out\r\nand get 'em.' Never counts the cost. He was nice to you--wahn't he,\r\nWill?\" And then Mr. Bixby leaned over and whispered in Mr. Wetherell's\r\near; \"He knows--you understand--he knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knows what?\" demanded Mr. Wetherell.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby gave him another admiring look.\r\n\r\n\"Knows you didn't come down here with Jethro jest to see the sights.\"\r\n\r\nAt this instant the talk in the dining room fell flat, and looking up\r\nWilliam Wetherell perceived a portly, rubicund man of middle age being\r\nshown to his seat by the headwaiter. The gentleman wore a great,\r\nglittering diamond in his shirt, and a watch chain that contained much\r\nfine gold. But the real cause of the silence was plainly in the young\r\nwoman who walked beside him, and whose effective entrance argued no\r\nlittle practice and experience. She was of a type that catches the eye\r\ninvoluntarily and holds it,--tall, well-rounded, fresh-complexioned, with\r\nheavy coils of shimmering gold hair. Her pawn, which was far from\r\nunbecoming, was in keeping with those gifts with which nature had endowed\r\nher. She carried her head high, and bestowed swift and evidently fatal\r\nglances to right and left during her progress through the room. Mr.\r\nBixby's voice roused the storekeeper from this contemplation of the\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n\"That's Alvy Hopkins of Gosport and his daughter. Fine gal, hain't she?\r\nEver sense she come down here t'other day she's stirred up more turmoil\r\nthan any railroad bill I ever seed. She was most suffocated at the\r\ngovernor's ball with fellers tryin' to get dances--some of 'em old\r\nfellers, too. And you understand about Alvy?\"\r\n\r\n\"What about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alvy says he's a-goin' to be the next governor, or fail up.\" Mr. Bixby's\r\nvoice sank to a whisper, and he spoke into Mr. Wetherell's ear. \"Alvy\r\nsays he has twenty-five thousand dollars to put in if necessary. I'll\r\nintroduce you to him, Will,\" he added meaningly. \"Guess you can help him\r\nsome--you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bixby!\" cried Mr. Wetherell, putting down his knife and fork.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Mr. Bixby, reassuringly; \"'twon't be no bother. I know him\r\nas well as I do you--call each other by our given names. Guess I was the\r\nfirst man he sent for last spring. He knows I go through all them river\r\ntowns. He says, 'Bije, you get 'em.' I understood.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell began to realize the futility of trying to convince Mr.\r\nBixby of his innocence in political matters, and glanced at Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't think he was listenin', would you, Will?\" Mr. Bixby\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"Listening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ears are sharp as a dog's. Callate he kin hear as far as the governor's\r\ntable, and he don't look as if he knows anything. One way he built up his\r\npower--listenin' when they're talkin' sly out there in the rotunda.\r\nThey're almighty surprised when they l'arn he knows what they're up to.\r\nGuess you understand how to go along by quiet and listen when they're\r\ntalkin' sly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never did such a thing in my life,\" cried William Wetherell,\r\nindignantly aghast.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bixby winked.\r\n\r\n\"So long, Will,\" he said, \"see you in Number 7.\"\r\n\r\nNever, since the days of Pompadour and Du Barry, until modern American\r\npolitics were invented, has a state been ruled from such a place as\r\nNumber 7 in the Pelican House--familiarly known as the Throne Room. In\r\nthis historic cabinet there were five chairs, a marble-topped table, a\r\npitcher of iced water, a bureau, a box of cigars and a Bible, a\r\nchandelier with all the gas jets burning, and a bed, whereon sat such\r\ndignitaries as obtained an audience,--railroad presidents, governors and\r\nex-governors and prospective governors, the Speaker, the President of the\r\nSenate, Bijah Bixby, Peleg Hartington, mighty chiefs from the North\r\nCountry, and lieutenants from other parts of the state. These sat on the\r\nbed by preference. Jethro sat in a chair by the window, and never took\r\nany part in the discussions that raged, but listened. Generally there was\r\nsome one seated beside him who talked persistently in his ear; as at\r\npresent, for instance, Mr. Chauncey Weed, Chairman of the Committee on\r\nCorporations of the House, who took the additional precaution of putting\r\nhis hand to his mouth when he spoke.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen Merrill was in the Throne Room that evening, and\r\nconfidentially explained to the bewildered William Wetherell the exact\r\nsituation in the Truro Franchise fight. Inasmuch as it has become our\r\nduty to describe this celebrated conflict,--in a popular and engaging\r\nmanner, if possible,--we shall have to do so through Mr. Wetherell's\r\neyes, and on his responsibility. The biographies of some of the gentlemen\r\nconcerned have since been published, and for some unaccountable reason\r\ncontain no mention of the Truro franchise.\r\n\r\n\"All Gaul,\" said Mr. Merrill--he was speaking to a literary man--\"all\r\nGaul is divided into five railroads. I am one, the Grand Gulf and\r\nNorthern, the impecunious one. That is the reason I'm so nice to\r\neverybody, Mr. Wetherell. The other day a conductor on my road had a\r\nshock of paralysis when a man paid his fare. Then there's Batch,\r\npresident of the 'Down East' road, as we call it. Batch and I are out of\r\nthis fight,--we don't care whether Isaac D. Worthington gets his\r\nfranchise or not, or I wouldn't be telling you this. The two railroads\r\nwhich don't want him to get it, because the Truro would eventually become\r\na competitor with them, are the Central and the Northwestern. Alexander\r\nDuncan is president of the Central.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alexander Duncan!\" exclaimed Wetherell. \"He's the richest man in the\r\nstate, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Merrill, \"and he lives in a big square house right here\r\nin the capital. He ain't a bad fellow, Duncan. You'd like him. He loves\r\nbooks. I wish you could see his library.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid there's not much chance of that,\" answered Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I say, there's Duncan, of the Central, and the other is\r\nLovejoy, of the Northwestern. Lovejoy's a bachelor and a skinflint. Those\r\ntwo, Duncan and Lovejoy, are using every means in their power to prevent\r\nWorthington from getting that franchise. Have I made myself clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think Mr. Worthington will get it?\" asked Wetherell, who had in\r\nmind a certain nocturnal visit at his store.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill almost leaped out of his chair at the question. Then he\r\nmopped his face, and winked very deliberately at the storekeeper. Then\r\nMr. Merrill laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said, \"for a man who comes down here to stay with Jethro\r\nBass to ask me that!\" Whereupon Mr. Wetherell flushed, and began to\r\nperspire himself. \"Didn't you hear Isaac D. Worthington's virtuous appeal\r\nto the people at Brampton?\" said Mr. Merrill.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Wetherell, getting redder.\r\n\r\n\"I like you, Will,\" said Mr. Merrill, unexpectedly, \"darned if I don't.\r\nI'll tell you what I know about it, and you can have a little fun while\r\nyou're here, lookin' on, only it won't do to write about it to the\r\nNewcastle Guardian. Guess Willard wouldn't publish it, anyhow. I suppose\r\nyou know that Jethro pulls the strings, end we little railroad presidents\r\ndance. We're the puppets now, but after a while, when I'm crowded out,\r\nall these little railroads will get together and there'll be a row worth\r\nlooking at, or I'm mistaken. But to go back to Worthington,\" continued\r\nMr. Merrill, \"he made a little mistake with his bill in the beginning.\r\nInstead of going to Jethro, he went to Heth Sutton, and Heth got the bill\r\nas far as the Committee on Corporations, and there she's been ever since,\r\nwith our friend Chauncey Weed, who's whispering over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sutton couldn't even get it out of the Committee!\" exclaimed\r\nWetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Not an inch. Jethro saw this thing coming about a year ago, and he took\r\nthe precaution to have Chauncey Weed and the rest of the Committee in his\r\npocket--and of course Heth Sutton's always been there.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell thought of that imposing and manly personage, the\r\nHonorable Heth Sutton, being in Jethro's pocket, and marvelled. Mr.\r\nChauncey Weed seemed of a species better able to thrive in the atmosphere\r\nof pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I say, there was the Truro Franchise Bill sound asleep in the\r\nCommittee, and when Isaac D. Worthington saw that his little arrangement\r\nwith Heth Sutton wasn't any good, and that the people of the state didn't\r\nhave anything more to say about it than the Crow Indians, and that the\r\nend of the session was getting nearer and nearer, he got desperate and\r\nwent to Jethro, I suppose. You know as well as I do that Jethro has\r\nagreed to put the bill through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why doesn't he get the Committee to report it and put it through?\"\r\nasked Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Bless your simple literary nature,\" exclaimed Mr Merrill, \"Jethro's got\r\nmore power than any man in the state, but that isn't saying that he\r\ndoesn't have to fight occasionally. He has to fight now. He has seven of\r\nthe twelve senators hitched, and the governor. But Duncan and Lovejoy\r\nhave bought up all the loose blocks of representatives, and it is\r\nsupposed that the franchise forces only control a quorum. The end of the\r\nsession is a week off, and never in all my experience have I seen a more\r\npraiseworthy attendance on the part of members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that they are being paid to remain in their seats?\" cried\r\nthe amazed Mr. Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Mr. Merrill, with a twinkle in his eye, \"that is a\r\nlittle bald and--and unparliamentary, perhaps, but fairly accurate. Our\r\nfriend Jethro is confronted with a problem to tax even his faculties, and\r\nto look at him, a man wouldn't suspect he had a care in the world.\"\r\n\r\nJethro was apparently quite as free from anxiety the next morning when he\r\noffered, after breakfast, to show Wetherell and Cynthia the sights of the\r\ntown, though Wetherell could not but think that the Throne Room and the\r\nTruro Franchise Bill were left at a very crucial moment to take care of\r\nthemselves. Jethro talked to Cynthia--or rather, Cynthia talked to Jethro\r\nupon innumerable subject's; they looked upon the statue of a great\r\nstatesman in the park, and Cynthia read aloud the quotation graven on the\r\nrock of the pedestal, \"The People's Government, made for the People, made\r\nby the People, and answerable to the People.\" After that they went into\r\nthe state library, where Wetherell was introduced to the librarian, Mr.\r\nStorrow. They did not go into the State House because, as everybody\r\nknows, Jethro Bass never went there. Mr. Bijah Bixby and other\r\nlieutenants might be seen in the lobbies, and the governor might sign\r\nbills in his own apartment there, but the real seat of government was\r\nthat Throne Room into which we have been permitted to enter.\r\n\r\nThey walked out beyond the outskirts of the town, where there was a grove\r\nor picnic ground which was also used as a park by some of the\r\ninhabitants. Jethro liked the spot, and was in the habit sometimes of\r\ntaking refuge there when the atmosphere of the Pelican House became too\r\nthick. The three of them had sat down on one of the board benches to\r\nrest, when presently two people were seen at a little distance walking\r\namong the trees, and the sight of them, for some reason, seemed to give\r\nJethro infinite pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Cynthia, \"one of them is that horrid girl everybody was\r\nlooking at in the dining room last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't like her, Cynthy?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cynthia, \"I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty--hain't she--pretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's brazen,\" declared Cynthia.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, Miss Cassandra Hopkins, daughter of that Honorable Alva\r\nwho--according to Mr. Bixby was all ready with a certain sum of money to\r\nbe the next governor. Miss Cassandra was arrayed fluffily in cool, pink\r\nlawn, and she carried a fringed parasol, and she was gazing upward with\r\ntelling effect into the face of the gentleman by her side. This would\r\nhave all been very romantic if the gentleman had been young and handsome,\r\nbut he was certainly not a man to sweep a young girl off her feet. He was\r\ntall, angular, though broad-shouldered, with a long, scrawny neck that\r\nrose out of a very low collar, and a large head, scantily covered with\r\nhair--a head that gave a physical as well as a mental effect of hardness.\r\nHis smooth-shaven face seemed to bear witness that its owner was one who\r\nhad pushed frugality to the borders of a vice. It was not a pleasant\r\nface, but now it wore an almost benign expression under the influence of\r\nMiss Cassandra's eyes. So intent, apparently, were both of them upon each\r\nother that they did not notice the group on the bench at the other side\r\nof the grove. William Wetherell ventured to ask Jethro who the man was.\r\n\r\n\"N-name's Lovejoy,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Lovejoy!\" ejaculated the storekeeper, thinking of what Mr. Merrill had\r\ntold him of the opponents of the Truro Franchise Bill. \"President of the\r\n'Northwestern' Railroad?\"\r\n\r\nJethro gave his friend a shrewd look.\r\n\r\n\"G-gettin' posted--hain't you, Will?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Is she going to marry that old man?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nJethro smiled a little. \"G-guess not,\" said he, \"g-guess not, if the old\r\nman can help it. Nobody's married him yet, and hain't likely to.\"\r\n\r\nJethro was unusually silent on the way back to the hotel, but he did not\r\nseem to be worried or displeased. He only broke his silence once, in\r\nfact, when Cynthia called his attention to a large poster of some\r\nbloodhounds on a fence, announcing the fact in red letters that \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin\" would be given by a certain travelling company at the Opera\r\nHouse the next evening.\r\n\r\n\"L-like to go, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Uncle Jethro, do you think we can go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never b'en to a show--hev you--never b'en to a show?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never in my life,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"We'll all go,\" said Jethro, and he repeated it once or twice as they\r\ncame to Main Street, seemingly greatly tickled at the prospect. And there\r\nwas the Truro Franchise Bill hanging over him, with only a week left of\r\nthe session, and Lovejoy's and Duncan's men sitting so tight in their\r\nseats! William Wetherell could not understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when Mr. Wetherell knocked timidly at Number\r\n7,--drawn thither by an irresistible curiosity,--the door was opened by a\r\nportly person who wore a shining silk hat and ample gold watch chain. The\r\ngentleman had, in fact, just arrived; but he seemed perfectly at home as\r\nhe laid down his hat on the marble-topped bureau, mopped his face, took a\r\nglass of iced water at a gulp, chose a cigar, and sank down gradually on\r\nthe bed. Mr. Wetherell recognized him instantly as the father of the\r\ncelebrated Cassandra.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jethro,\" said the gentleman, \"I've got to come into the Throne\r\nRoom once a day anyhow, just to make sure you don't forget me--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"A-Alvy,\" said Jethro, \"I want you to shake hands with a particular\r\nfriend of mine, Mr. Will Wetherell of Coniston. Er--Will, the Honorable\r\nAlvy Hopkins of Gosport.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins rose from the bed as gradually as he had sunk down upon it,\r\nand seized Mr. Wetherell's hand impressively. His own was very moist.\r\n\r\n\"Heard you was in town, Mr. Wetherell,\" he said heartily. \"If Jethro\r\ncalls you a particular friend, it means something, I guess. It means\r\nsomething to me, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will hain't a politician,\" said Jethro. \"Er--Alvy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" said Mr. Hopkins.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Will don't talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Jethro had been real tactful,\" said the Honorable Alvy, sinking down\r\nagain, \"he'd have introduced me as the next governor of the state.\r\nEverybody knows I want to be governor, everybody knows I've got twenty\r\nthousand dollars in the bank to pay for that privilege. Everybody knows\r\nI'm going to be governor if Jethro says so.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was a little taken aback at this ingenuous statement of\r\nthe gentleman from Gosport. He looked out of the window through the\r\nfoliage of the park, and his eye was caught by the monument there in\r\nfront of the State House, and he thought of the inscription on the base\r\nof it, \"The People's Government.\" The Honorable Alva had not mentioned\r\nthe people--undoubtedly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Wetherell, twenty thousand dollars.\" He sighed. \"Time was when\r\na man could be governor for ten. Those were the good old days--eh,\r\nJethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"A-Alvy, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin's' comin' to town tomorrow--to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't tell me,\" said the Honorable Alva, acquiescing cheerfully in\r\nthe change of subject. \"We'll go. Pleased to have you, too, Mr.\r\nWetherell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alvy,\" said Jethro, again, \"'Uncle Tom's Cabin' comes to town\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins stopped fanning himself, and glanced at Jethro questioningly.\r\n\r\n\"A-Alvy, that give you an idea?\" said Jethro, mildly.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell looked blank: it gave him no idea whatsoever, except of\r\nlittle Eva and the bloodhounds. For a few moments the Honorable Alva\r\nappeared to be groping, too, and then his face began to crease into a\r\nsmile of comprehension.\r\n\r\n\"By Godfrey, Jethro, but you are smart.\" he exclaimed, with involuntary\r\ntribute; \"you mean buy up the theatre?\"\r\n\r\n\"C-callate you'll find it's bought up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean pay for it?\" said Mr. Hopkins.\r\n\r\n\"You've guessed it, Alvy, you've guessed it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins gazed at him in admiration, leaned out of the perpendicular,\r\nand promptly drew from his trousers' pocket a roll of stupendous\r\nproportions. Wetting his thumb, he began to push aside the top bills.\r\n\r\n\"How much is it?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nBut Jethro put up his hand.\r\n\r\n\"No hurry, Alvy--n-no hurry. H-Honorable Alvy Hopkins of\r\nGosport--p-patron of the theatre. Hain't the first time you've b'en a\r\npatron, Alvy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" said Mr. Hopkins, solemnly, putting up his money, \"I'm much\r\nobliged to you. I'm free to say I'd never have thought of it. If you\r\nain't the all-firedest smartest man in America to-day,--I don't except\r\nany, even General Grant,--then I ain't the next governor of this state.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he lapsed into an even more expressive silence, his face still\r\nglowing.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Alvy,\" said Jethro presently, \"what's the name of your gal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Hopkins, \"I guess you've got me. We did christen her\r\nLily, but she didn't turn out exactly Lily. She ain't the type,\" said Mr.\r\nHopkins, slowly, not without a note of regret, and lapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n\"W-what did you say her name was, Alvy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess her name's Cassandra,\" said the Honorable Alva.\r\n\r\n\"C-Cassandry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see,\" he explained a trifle apologetically, \"she's kind of\r\ntaken some matters in her own hands, my gal. Didn't like Lily, and it\r\ndidn't seem to fit her anyway, so she called herself Cassandra. Read it\r\nin a book. It means, 'inspirer of love,' or some such poetry, but I don't\r\ndeny that it goes with her better than Lily would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh-she's a good deal of a gal, Alvy--fine-appearin' gal, Alvy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Jethro, I didn't know you ever looked at a woman. But I\r\nsuppose you couldn't help lookin' at my gal--she does seem to draw men's\r\neyes as if she was magnetized some way.\" Mr. Hopkins did not speak as\r\nthough this quality of his daughter gave him unmixed delight. \"But she's\r\na good-hearted gal, Cassy is, high-spirited, and I won't deny she's\r\nhandsome and smart.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll kind of grace my position when I'm governor. But to tell you the\r\ntruth, Jethro, one old friend to another, durned if I don't wish she was\r\nmarried. It's a terrible thing for a father to say, I know, but I'd feel\r\neasier about her if she was married to some good man who could hold her.\r\nThere's young Joe Turner in Gosport, he'd give his soul to have her, and\r\nhe'd do. Cassy says she's after bigger game than Joe. She's young--that's\r\nher only excuse. Funny thing happened night before last,\" continued Mr.\r\nHopkins, laughing. \"Lovejoy saw her, and he's b'en out of his head ever\r\nsince. Al must be pretty near my age, ain't he? Well, there's no fool\r\nlike an old fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-Alvy introduce me to Cassandry sometime will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly,\" answered Mr. Hopkins, heartily, \"I'll bring her in\r\nhere. And now how about gettin' an adjournment to-morrow night for 'Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin'? These night sessions kind of interfere.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when the representatives were pouring into the\r\nrotunda for dinner, a crowd was pressing thickly around the desk to read\r\na placard pinned on the wall above it. The placard announced the coming\r\nof Mr. Glover's Company for the following night, and that the Honorable\r\nAlva Hopkins of Gosport, ex-Speaker of the House, had bought three\r\nhundred and twelve seats for the benefit of the members. And the\r\nHonorable Alva himself, very red in the face and almost smothered, could\r\nbe dimly discerned at the foot of the stairs trying to fight his way out\r\nof a group of overenthusiastic friends and admirers. Alva--so it was said\r\non all sides--was doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nSo it was that one sensation followed another at the capital, and the\r\npoliticians for the moment stopped buzzing over the Truro Franchise Bill\r\nto discuss Mr. Hopkins and his master-stroke. The afternoon Chronicle\r\nwaxed enthusiastic on the subject of Mr. Hopkins's generosity, and\r\npredicted that, when Senator Hartington made the motion in the upper\r\nhouse and Mr. Jameson in the lower, the General Court would unanimously\r\nagree that there would be no evening session on the following day. The\r\nHonorable Alva was the hero of the hour.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Cynthia and her father walked through the green park to\r\nmake their first visit to the State House. They stood hand in hand on the\r\ncool, marble-paved floor of the corridor, gazing silently at the stained\r\nand battered battle-flags behind the glass, and Wetherell seemed to be\r\nlistening again to the appeal of a great President to a great Country in\r\nthe time of her dire need--the soul calling on the body to fight for\r\nitself. Wetherell seemed to feel again the thrill he felt when he saw the\r\nblue-clad men of this state crowded in the train at Boston: and to hear\r\nagain the cheers, and the sobs, and the prayers as he looked upon the\r\nblood that stained stars and stripes alike with a holy stain. With that\r\nblood the country had been consecrated, and the state--yes, and the\r\nbuilding where they stood. So they went on up the stairs, reverently, nor\r\nheeded the noise of those in groups about them, and through a door into\r\nthe great hall of the representatives of the state.\r\n\r\nLife is a mixture of emotions, a jumble of joy and sorrow and reverence\r\nand mirth and flippancy, of right feeling and heresy. In the morning\r\nWilliam Wetherell had laughed at Mr. Hopkins and the twenty thousand\r\ndollars he had put in the bank to defraud the people; but now he could\r\nhave wept over it, and as he looked down upon the three hundred members\r\nof that House, he wondered how many of them represented their neighbors\r\nwho supposedly had sent them here--and how many Mr. Lovejoy's railroad,\r\nMr. Worthington's railroad, or another man's railroad.\r\n\r\nBut gradually he forgot the battle-flags, and his mood changed. Perhaps\r\nthe sight of Mr. Speaker Sutton towering above the House, the very\r\nessence and bulk of authority, brought this about. He aroused in\r\nWetherell unwilling admiration and envy when he arose to put a question\r\nin his deep voice, or rapped sternly with his gavel to silence the tumult\r\nof voices that arose from time to time; or while some member was\r\nspeaking, or the clerk was reading a bill at breathless speed, he turned\r\nwith wonderful nonchalance to listen to the conversation of the gentlemen\r\non the bench beside him, smiled, nodded, pulled his whiskers, at once\r\nconscious and unconscious of his high position. And, most remarkable of\r\nall to the storekeeper, not a man of the three hundred, however obscure,\r\ncould rise that the Speaker did not instantly call him by name.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was occupied by such reflections as these when suddenly\r\nthere fell a hush through the House. The clerk had stopped reading, the\r\nSpeaker had stopped conversing, and, seizing his gavel, looked\r\nexpectantly over the heads of the members and nodded. A sleek,\r\ncomfortably dressed mail arose smilingly in the middle of the House, and\r\nsubdued laughter rippled from seat to seat as he addressed the chair.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jameson of Wantage.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jameson cleared his throat impressively and looked smilingly about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the House,\" he said, \"if I desired to\r\narouse the enthusiasm--the just enthusiasm--of any gathering in this\r\nHouse, or in this city, or in this state, I should mention the name of\r\nthe Honorable Alva Hopkins of Gosport. I think I am right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jameson was interrupted, as he no doubt expected, by applause from\r\nfloor and gallery. He stood rubbing his hands together, and it seemed to\r\nWilliam Wetherell that the Speaker did not rap as sharply with his gavel\r\nas he had upon other occasions.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the House,\" continued Mr. Jameson, presently, \"the\r\nHonorable Alva Hopkins, whom we all know and love, has with unparalleled\r\ngenerosity--unparalleled, I say--bought up three hundred and twelve seats\r\nin Fosters Opera House for to-morrow night\" (renewed applause), \"in order\r\nthat every member of this august body may have the opportunity to witness\r\nthat most classic of histrionic productions, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'.\" (Loud\r\napplause, causing the Speaker to rap sharply.) \"That we may show a proper\r\nappreciation of this compliment--I move you, Mr. Speaker, that the House\r\nadjourn not later than six o'clock to-morrow, Wednesday evening, not to\r\nmeet again until Thursday morning.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jameson of Wantage handed the resolution to a page and sat down\r\namidst renewed applause. Mr. Wetherell noticed that many members turned\r\nin their seats as they clapped, and glancing along the gallery he caught\r\na flash of red and perceived the radiant Miss Cassandra herself leaning\r\nover the rail, her hands clasped in ecstasy. Mr. Lovejoy was not with\r\nher--he evidently preferred to pay his attentions in private.\r\n\r\n\"There she is again,\" whispered Cynthia, who had taken an instinctive and\r\nextraordinary dislike to Miss Cassandra. Then Mr. Sutton rose\r\nmajestically to put the question.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, are you ready for the question?\" he cried. \"All those in\r\nfavor of the resolution of the gentleman from Wantage, Mr. Jameson--\" the\r\nSpeaker stopped abruptly. The legislators in the front seats swung\r\naround, and people in the gallery craned forward to see a member standing\r\nat his seat in the extreme rear of the hall. He was a little man in an\r\nill-fitting coat, his wizened face clean-shaven save for the broom-shaped\r\nbeard under his chin, which he now held in his hand. His thin, nasal\r\nvoice was somehow absurdly penetrating as he addressed the chair. Mr.\r\nSutton was apparently, for once, taken by surprise, and stared a moment,\r\nas though racking his brain for the name.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Suffolk, Mr. Heath,\" he said, and smiling a little,\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Suffolk, still holding on to his beard, pitched in\r\nwithout preamble.\r\n\r\n\"We farmers on the back seats don't often get a chance to be heard, Mr.\r\nSpeaker,\" said he, amidst a general tittering from the front seats. \"We\r\ncome down here without any l'arnin' of parli'ment'ry law, and before we\r\nknow what's happened the session's over, and we hain't said nothin'.\"\r\n(More laughter.) \"There's b'en a good many times when I wanted to say\r\nsomethin', and this time I made up my mind I was a-goin' to--law or no\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\n(Applause, and a general show of interest in the gentleman from Suffolk.)\r\n\"Naow, Mr. Speaker, I hain't ag'in' 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' It's a good\r\nplay, and it's done an almighty lot of good. And I hain't sayin' nothin'\r\nag'in' Alvy Hopkins nor his munificence. But I do know there's a sight of\r\nlittle bills on that desk that won't be passed if we don't set to-morrow\r\nnight--little bills that are big bills for us farmers. That thar\r\nwoodchuck bill, for one.\" (Laughter.) \"My constituents want I should have\r\nthat bill passed. We don't need a quorum for them bills, but we need\r\ntime. Naow, Mr. Speaker, I say let all them that wants to go and see\r\n'Uncle Tom's Cabin' go and see it, but let a few of us fellers that has\r\nwoodchuck bills and other things that we've got to get through come down\r\nhere and pass 'em. You kin put 'em on the docket, and I guess if anything\r\ncomes along that hain't jest right for everybody, somebody can challenge\r\na quorum and bust up the session. That's all.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Suffolk sat down amidst thunderous applause, and\r\nbefore it died away Mr. Jameson was on his feet, smiling and rubbing his\r\nhands together, and was recognized.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker,\" he said, as soon as he could be heard, \"if the gentleman\r\nfrom Suffolk desires to pass woodchuck bills\" (renewed laughter), \"he can\r\ndo so as far as I'm concerned. I guess I know where most of the members\r\nof this House will be to-morrow night-\" (Cries of 'You're right', and\r\nsharp rapping of the gavel.) \"Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my resolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Wantage,\" said the Speaker, smiling broadly now,\r\n\"withdraws his resolution.\"\r\n\r\nAs William Wetherell was returning to the Pelican House, pondering over\r\nthis incident, he almost ran into a distinguished-looking man walking\r\nbriskly across Main Street.\r\n\r\n\"It was Mr. Worthington!\" said Cynthia, looking after him.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Worthington had a worried look on his face, and was probably too\r\nmuch engrossed in his own thoughts to notice his acquaintances. He had,\r\nin fact, just come from the Throne Room, where he had been to remind\r\nJethro that the session was almost over, and to ask him what he meant to\r\ndo about the Truro Bill. Jethro had given him no satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Duncan and Lovejoy have their people paid to sit there night and day,\"\r\nMr. Worthington had said. \"We've got a bare majority on a full House; but\r\nyou don't seem to dare to risk it. What are you going to do about it, Mr.\r\nBass?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-want the bill to pass--don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Mr. Worthington had cried, on the edge of losing his temper.\r\n\r\n\"L-left it to me--didn't you?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I'm entitled to know what's being done. I'm paying for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-hain't paid for it yet--hev you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I most assuredly haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"B-better wait till you do.\"\r\n\r\nThere was very little satisfaction in this, and Mr. Worthington had at\r\nlength been compelled to depart, fuming, to the house of his friend the\r\nenemy, Mr. Duncan, there to attempt for the twentieth time to persuade\r\nMr. Duncan to call off his dogs who were sitting with such praiseworthy\r\npertinacity in their seats. As the two friends walked on the lawn, Mr.\r\nWorthington tried to explain, likewise for the twentieth time, that the\r\nextension of the Truro Railroad could in no way lessen the Canadian\r\ntraffic of the Central, Mr. Duncan's road. But Mr. Duncan could not see\r\nit that way, and stuck to his present ally, Mr. Lovejoy, and refused\r\npoint-blank to call off his dogs. Business was business.\r\n\r\nIt is an apparently inexplicable fact, however, that Mr. Worthington and\r\nhis son Bob were guests at the Duncan mansion at the capital. Two\r\ncountries may not be allies, but their sovereigns may be friends. In the\r\npresent instance, Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington's railroads were\r\nopposed, diplomatically, but another year might see the Truro Railroad\r\nand the Central acting as one. And Mr. Worthington had no intention\r\nwhatever of sacrificing Mr. Duncan's friendship. The first citizen of\r\nBrampton possessed one quality so essential to greatness--that of looking\r\ninto the future, and he believed that the time would come when an event\r\nof some importance might create a perpetual alliance between himself and\r\nMr. Duncan. In short, Mr. Duncan had a daughter, Janet, and Mr.\r\nWorthington, as we know, had a son. And Mr. Duncan, in addition to his\r\nown fortune, had married one of the richest heiresses in New England.\r\nPrudens futuri, that was Mr. Worthington's motto.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Cynthia, who was walking about the town alone, found\r\nherself gazing over a picket fence at a great square house with a very\r\nwide cornice that stood by itself in the centre of a shade-flecked lawn.\r\nThere were masses of shrubbery here and there, and a greenhouse, and a\r\nlatticed summer-house: and Cynthia was wondering what it would be like to\r\nlive in a great place like that, when a barouche with two shining horses\r\nin silver harness drove past her and stopped before the gate. Four or\r\nfive girls and boys came laughing out on the porch, and one of them, who\r\nheld a fishing-rod in his hand, Cynthia recognized. Startled and ashamed,\r\nshe began to walk on as fast as she could in the opposite direction, when\r\nshe heard the sound of footsteps on the lawn behind her, and her own name\r\ncalled in a familiar voice. At that she hurried the faster; but she could\r\nnot run, and the picket fence was half a block long, and Bob Worthington\r\nhad an advantage over her. Of course it was Bob, and he did not scruple\r\nto run, and in a few seconds he was leaning over the fence in front of\r\nher. Now Cynthia was as red as a peony by this time, and she almost hated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all people, Cynthia Wetherell!\" he cried; \"didn't you hear me\r\ncalling after you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you stop?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to,\" said Cynthia, glancing at the distant group on the\r\nporch, who were watching them. Suddenly she turned to him defiantly. \"I\r\ndidn't know you were in that house, or in the capital,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And I didn't know you were,\" said Bob, upon whose masculine intelligence\r\nthe meaning of her words was entirely lost. \"If I had known it, you can\r\nbet I would have looked you up. Where are you staying?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the Pelican House.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Bob, \"with all the politicians? How did you happen to go\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass asked my father and me to come down for a few days,\" answered\r\nCynthia, her color heightening again. Life is full of contrasts, and\r\nCynthia was becoming aware of some of them.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro?\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Uncle Jethro,\" said Cynthia, smiling in spite of herself. He always\r\nmade her smile.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro owns the Pelican House,\" said Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Does he? I knew he was a great man, but I didn't know how great he was\r\nuntil I came down here.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia said this so innocently that Bob repented his flippancy on the\r\nspot. He had heard occasional remarks of his elders about Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean quite that,\" he said, growing red in his turn. \"Uncle\r\nJethro--Mr. Bass--is a great man of course. That's what I meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's a very good man,\" said Cynthia, who understood now that he had\r\nspoken a little lightly of Jethro, and resented it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of it,\" said Bob, eagerly. Then Cynthia began to walk on,\r\nslowly, and he followed her on the other side of the fence. \"Hold on,\" he\r\ncried, \"I haven't said half the things I want to say--yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to say?\" asked Cynthia, still walking. \"I have to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you don't! Wait just a minute--won't you?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia halted, with apparent unwillingness, and put out her toe between\r\nthe pickets. Then she saw that there was a little patch on that toe, and\r\ndrew it in again.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to say?\" she repeated. \"I don't believe you have\r\nanything to say at all.\" And suddenly she flashed a look at him that made\r\nhis heart thump.\r\n\r\n\"I do--I swear I do!\" he protested. \"I'm coming down to the Pelican\r\nto-morrow morning to get you to go for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia could not but think that the remoteness of the time he set was\r\nscarce in keeping with his ardent tone.\r\n\r\n\"I have something else to do to-morrow morning,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll come to-morrow afternoon,\" said Bob, instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Who lives here?\" she asked irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Duncan. I'm visiting the Duncans.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a carryall joined the carriage at the gate. Cynthia\r\nglanced at the porch again. The group there had gown larger, and they\r\nwere still staring. She began to feel uncomfortable again, and moved on\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\"Mayn't I come?\" asked Bob, going after her; and scraping the butt of the\r\nrod along the palings.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't there enough girls here to satisfy you?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"They're enough--yes,\" he said, \"but none of 'em could hold a candle to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you tell them all something like that,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't do any such thing,\" he retorted, and then he laughed himself,\r\nand Cynthia laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"I like you because you don't swallow everything whole,\" said Bob,\r\n\"and--well, for a good many other reams.\" And he looked into her face\r\nwith such frank admiration that Cynthia blushed and turned away.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe a word you say,\" she answered, and started to walk off,\r\nthis time in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" cried Bob. They were almost at the end of the fence by this,\r\nand the pickets were sharp and rather high, or he would have climbed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCynthia paused hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll come at two o'clock to-morrow,\" said he; \"We're going on a picnic\r\nto-day, to Dalton's Bend, on the river. I wish I could get out of it.\"\r\n\r\nJust then there came a voice from the gateway.\r\n\r\n\"Bob! Bob Worthington!\"\r\n\r\nThey both turned involuntarily. A slender girl with light brown hair was\r\nstanding there, waving at him.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"That?\" said Bob, in some confusion, \"oh, that's Janet Duncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming to-morrow,\" he called after her, but she did not turn. In a\r\nlittle while she heard the carryall behind her clattering down the\r\nstreet, its passengers laughing and joking merrily. Her face burned, for\r\nshe thought that they were laughing at her; she wished with all her heart\r\nthat she had not stopped to talk with him at the palings. The girls,\r\nindeed, were giggling as the carryall passed, and she heard somebody call\r\nout his name, but nevertheless he leaned out of the seat and waved his\r\nhat at her, amid a shout of laughter. Poor Cynthia! She did not look at\r\nhim. Tears of vexation were in her eyes, and the light of her joy at this\r\nvisit to the capital flickered, and she wished she were back in Coniston.\r\nShe thought it would be very nice to be rich, and to live in a great\r\nhouse in a city, and to go on picnics.\r\n\r\nThe light flickered, but it did not wholly go out. If it has not been\r\nshown that Cynthia was endowed with a fair amount of sense, many of these\r\npages have been written in vain. She sat down for a while in the park and\r\nthought of the many things she had to be thankful for--not the least of\r\nwhich was Jethro's kindness. And she remembered that she was to see\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" that evening.\r\n\r\nSuch are the joys and sorrows of fifteen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMr. Amos Cuthbert named it so--our old friend Amos who lives high up in\r\nthe ether of Town's End ridge, and who now represents Coniston in the\r\nLegislature. He is the same silent, sallow person as when Jethro first\r\ntook a mortgage on his farm, only his skin is beginning to resemble dried\r\nparchment, and he is a trifle more cantankerous. On the morning of that\r\nmemorable day when, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" came to the capital, Amos had\r\nentered the Throne Room and given vent to his feelings in regard to the\r\ngentleman in the back seat who had demanded an evening sitting on behalf\r\nof the farmers.\r\n\r\n\"Don't that beat all?\" cried Amos. \"Let them have their darned woodchuck\r\nsession; there won't nobody go to it. For cussed, crisscross\r\ncontrariness, give me a moss-back Democrat from a one-boss, one-man town\r\nlike Suffolk. I'm a-goin' to see the show.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to the show, be you, Amos?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I be,\" answered Amos, bitterly. \"I hain't agoin' nigh the house\r\nto-night.\" And with this declaration he departed.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if he really is going?\" queried Mr. Merrill looking at the\r\nceiling. And then he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't he go?\" asked William Wetherell.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill's answer to this question was a wink, whereupon he, too,\r\ndeparted. And while Wetherell was pondering over the possible meaning of\r\nthese words the Honorable Alva Hopkins entered, wreathed in smiles, and\r\nclosed the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\"It's all fixed,\" he said, taking a seat near Jethro in the window.\r\n\r\n\"S-seen your gal--Alvy--seen your gal?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins gave a glance at Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Will don't talk,\" said Jethro, and resumed his inspection through the\r\nlace curtains of what was going on in the street.\r\n\r\n\"Cassandry's, got him to go,\" said Mr. Hopkins. \"It's all fixed, as sure\r\nas Sunday. If it misses fire, then I'll never mention the governorship\r\nagain. But if it don't miss fire,\" and the Honorable Alva leaned over and\r\nput his hand on Jethro's knee, \"if it don't miss fire, I get the\r\nnomination. Is that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-you've guessed it, Alvy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all I want to know,\" declared the Honorable Alva; \"when you say\r\nthat much, you never go back on it. And, you can go ahead and give the\r\norders, Jethro. I have to see that the boys get the tickets. Cassandry's\r\ngot a head on her shoulders, and she kind of wants to be governor, too.\"\r\nHe got as far as the door, when he turned and bestowed upon Jethro a\r\nglance of undoubted tribute. \"You've done a good many smart things,\" said\r\nhe, \"but I guess you never beat this, and never will.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-hain't done it yet, Alvy,\" answered Jethro, still looking out through\r\nthe window curtains at the ever ganging groups of gentlemen in the\r\nstreet. These groups had a never ceasing interest for Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell didn't talk, but had he been the most incurable of gossips\r\nhe felt that he could have done no damage to this mysterious affair,\r\nwhatever it was. In a certain event, Mr. Hopkins was promised the\r\ngovernorship: so much was plain. And it was also evident that Miss\r\nCassandra Hopkins was in some way to be instrumental. William Wetherell\r\ndid not like to ask Jethro, but he thought a little of sounding Mr.\r\nMerrill, and then he came to the conclusion that it would be wiser for\r\nhim not to know.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Will,\" said Jethro, presently, \"you know Heth Sutton--Speaker Heth\r\nSutton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--wouldn't mind askin' him to step in and see me before the\r\nsession--if he was comin' by--would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--if he was comin' by,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell found Mr. Speaker Sutton glued to a pillar in the rotunda\r\nbelow. He had some difficulty in breaking through the throng that pressed\r\naround him, and still more in attracting his attention, as Mr. Sutton\r\ntook no manner of notice of the customary form of placing one's hand\r\nunder his elbow and pressing gently up. Summoning up his courage, Mr.\r\nWetherell tried the second method of seizing him by the buttonhole. He\r\npaused in his harangue, one hand uplifted, and turned and glanced at the\r\nstorekeeper abstractedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass asked me to tell you to drop into Number 7,\" said Wetherell,\r\nand added, remembering express instructions, \"if you were going by.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell had not anticipated the magical effect this usual message would\r\nhave on Mr. Sutton, nor had he thought that so large and dignified a body\r\nwould move so rapidly. Before the astonished gentlemen who had penned him\r\ncould draw a breath, Mr. Sutton had reached the stairway and, was\r\nmounting it with an agility that did him credit. Five minutes later\r\nWetherell saw the Speaker descending again, the usually impressive\r\nquality of his face slightly modified by the twitching of a smile.\r\n\r\nThus the day passed, and the gentlemen of the Lovejoy and Duncan factions\r\nsat, as tight as ever in their seats, and the Truro Franchise bill still\r\nslumbered undisturbed in Mr. Chauncey Weed's committee.\r\n\r\nAt supper there was a decided festal air about the dining room of the\r\nPelican House, the little band of agricultural gentlemen who wished to\r\nhave a session not being patrons of that exclusive hotel. Many of the\r\nSolons had sent home for their wives; that they might do the utmost\r\njustice to the Honorable Alva's hospitality. Even Jethro, as he ate his\r\ncrackers and milk, had a new coat with bright brass buttons, and Cynthia,\r\nwho wore a fresh gingham which Miss Sukey Kittredge of Coniston had\r\nhelped to design, so far relented in deference to Jethro's taste as to\r\ntie a red bow at her throat.\r\n\r\nThe middle table under the chandelier was the immediate firmament of Miss\r\nCassandra Hopkins. And there, beside the future governor, sat the\r\npresident of the \"Northwestern\" Railroad, Mr. Lovejoy, as the chief of\r\nthe revolving satellites. People began to say that Mr. Lovejoy was hooked\r\nat last, now that he had lost his head in such an unaccountable fashion\r\nas to pay his court in public; and it was very generally known that he\r\nwas to make one of the Honorable Alva's immediate party at the\r\nperformance of \"Uncle Tam's Cabin.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker Sutton, of course, would have to forego the pleasure of the\r\ntheatre as a penalty of his high position. Mr. Merrill, who sat at\r\nJethro's table next to Cynthia that evening, did a great deal of joking\r\nwith the Honorable Heth about having to preside aver a woodchuck session,\r\nwhich the Speaker, so Mr. Wetherell thought, took in astonishingly good\r\npart, and seemed very willing to make the great sacrifice which his duty\r\nrequired of him.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Mr. Wetherell took a seat in the rotunda. As an observer of\r\nhuman nature, he had begun to find a fascination in watching the group of\r\npoliticians there. First of all he encountered Mr. Amos Cuthbert, his\r\nlittle coal-black eyes burning brightly, and he was looking very\r\nirritable indeed.\r\n\r\n\"So you're going to the show, Amos?\" remarked the storekeeper, with an\r\nattempt at cordiality.\r\n\r\nTo his bewilderment, Amos turned upon him fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"Who said I was going to the show?\" he snapped.\r\n\r\n\"You yourself told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd ought to know whether I'm a-goin' or not,\" said Amos, and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Wetherell sat meditating, upon this inexplicable retort, a\r\nretired, scholarly looking gentleman with a white beard, who wore\r\nspectacles, came out of the door leading from the barber shop and quietly\r\ntook a seat beside him. The storekeeper's attention was next distracted\r\nby the sight of one who wandered slowly but ceaselessly from group to\r\ngroup, kicking up his heels behind, and halting always in the rear of the\r\nspeakers. Needless to say that this was our friend Mr. Bijah Bixby, who\r\nwas following out his celebrated tactics of \"going along by when they\r\nwere talkin' sly.\" Suddenly Mr. Bixby's eye alighted on Mr. Wetherell,\r\nwho by a stretch of imagination conceived that it expressed both\r\nastonishment and approval, although he was wholly at a loss to understand\r\nthese sentiments. Mr. Bixby winked--Mr. Wetherell was sure of that. But\r\nto his surprise, Bijah did not pause in his rounds to greet him.\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell was beginning to be decidedly uneasy, and was about to go\r\nupstairs, when Mr. Merrill came down the rotunda whistling, with his\r\nhands in his pockets. He stopped whistling when he spied the storekeeper,\r\nand approached him in his usual hearty manner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, this is fortunate,\" said Mr. Merrill; \"how are you, Duncan?\r\nI want you to know Mr. Wetherell. Wetherell writes that weekly letter for\r\nthe Guardian you were speaking to me about last year. Will, this is Mr.\r\nAlexander Duncan, president of the 'Central.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Wetherell?\" said the scholarly gentleman with the\r\nspectacles, putting out his hand. \"I'm glad to meet you, very glad,\r\nindeed. I read your letters with the greatest pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell, as he took Mr. Duncan's hand, had a variety of emotions\r\nwhich may be imagined, and need not be set down in particular.\r\n\r\n\"Funny thing,\" Mr. Merrill continued, \"I was looking for you, Duncan. It\r\noccurred to me that you would like to meet Mr. Wetherell. I was afraid\r\nyou were in Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just got back,\" said Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted Wetherell to see your library. I was telling him about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be delighted to show it to him,\" answered Mr. Duncan. That\r\nlibrary, as is well known, was a special weakness of Mr. Duncan's.\r\n\r\nPoor William Wetherell, who was quite overwhelmed by the fact that the\r\ngreat Mr. Duncan had actually read his letters and liked them, could\r\nscarcely utter a sensible word. Almost before he realized what had\r\nhappened he was following Mr. Duncan out of the Pelican House, when the\r\nstorekeeper was mystified once more by a nudge and another wink from Mr.\r\nBixby, conveying unbounded admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you write a book, Mr. Wetherell?\" inquired the railroad\r\npresident, when they were crossing the park.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I could do it,\" said Mr. Wetherell, modestly. Such incense\r\nwas overpowering, and he immediately forgot Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can,\" said Mr. Duncan, \"only you don't know it. Take your\r\nletters for a beginning. You can draw people well enough, when you try.\r\nThere was your description of the lonely hill-farm on the spur--I shall\r\nalways remember that: the gaunt farmer, toiling every minute between sun\r\nand sun; the thin, patient woman bending to a task that never charged or\r\nlightened; the children growing up and leaving one by one, some to the\r\ncities, some to the West, until the old people are left alone in the\r\nevening of life--to the sunsets and the storms. Of course you must write\r\na book.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan quoted other letters, and William Wetherell thrilled. Poor\r\nman! he had had little enough incense in his time, and none at all from\r\nthe great. They came to the big square house with the cornice which\r\nCynthia had seen the day before, and walked across the lawn through the\r\nopen door. William Wetherell had a glimpse of a great drawing-room with\r\nhigh windows, out of which was wafted the sound of a piano and of\r\nyouthful voice and laughter, and then he was in the library. The thought\r\nof one man owning all those books overpowered him. There they were, in\r\nstately rows, from the floor to the high ceiling, and a portable ladder\r\nwith which to reach them.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan, understanding perhaps something of the storekeeper's\r\nembarrassment, proceeded to take down his treasures: first editions from\r\nthe shelves, and folios and mistrals from drawers in a great iron safe in\r\none corner and laid them on the mahogany desk. It was the railroad\r\npresident's hobby, and could he find an appreciative guest, he was happy.\r\nIt need scarcely be said that he found William Wetherell appreciative,\r\nand possessed of knowledge of Shaksperiana and other matters that\r\nastonished his host as well as pleased him. For Wetherell had found his\r\ntongue at last.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mr. Duncan drew out his watch and gave a start.\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" he exclaimed, \"it's after eight o'clock. I'll have to ask\r\nyou to excuse me to-night, Mr. Wetherell. I'd like to show you the rest\r\nof them--can't you come around to-morrow afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell, who had forgotten his own engagement and \"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin,\" said he would be happy to come. And they went out together and\r\nbegan to walk toward the State House.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't often I find a man who knows anything at all about these\r\nthings,\" continued Mr. Duncan, whose heart was quite won. \"Why do you\r\nbury yourself in Coniston?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went there from Briton for my health,\" said the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass lives there, doesn't he\" said Mr. Duncan, with a laugh. But\r\nI suppose you don't know anything about politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing at all,\" said Mr. Wetherell, which was quite true. He had\r\nbeen in dreamland, but now the fact struck him again, with something of a\r\nshock, that this mild-mannered gentleman was one of those who had been\r\npaying certain legislators to remain in their seats. Wetherell thought of\r\nspeaking to Mr. Duncan of his friendship with Jethro Bass, but the\r\noccasion passed.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to heaven I didn't have to know anything about politics,\" Mr.\r\nDuncan was saying; \"they disgust me. There's a little matter on now,\r\nabout an extension of the Truro Railroad to Harwich, which wouldn't\r\ninterest you, but you can't conceive what a nuisance it has been to watch\r\nthat House day and night, as I've had to. It's no joke to have that\r\ntownsman of yours; Jethro Bass, opposed to you. I won't say anything\r\nagainst him, for he many be a friend of yours, and I have to use him\r\nsometimes myself.\" Mr. Duncan sighed. \"It's all very sordid and annoying.\r\nNow this evening, for instance, when we might have enjoyed ourselves with\r\nthose books, I've' got to go to the House, just because some backwoods\r\nfarmers want to talk about woodchucks. I suppose it's foolish,\" said Mr.\r\nDuncan; \"but Bass has tricked us so often that I've got into the habit of\r\nbeing watchful. I should have been here twenty minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they had come to the entrance of the State House, and\r\nWetherell followed Mr. Duncan in, to have a look at the woodchuck session\r\nhimself. Several members hurried by and up the stairs, some of them in\r\ntheir Sunday black; and the lobby above seemed, even to the storekeeper's\r\nunpractised eye, a trifle active for a woodchuck session. Mr. Duncan\r\nmuttered something, and quickened his gait a little on the steps that led\r\nto the gallery. This place was almost empty. They went down to the rail,\r\nand the railroad president cast his eye over the House.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" he said sharply, \"there's almost a quorum here.\" He ran his\r\neye over the members. \"There is a quorum here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan stood drumming nervously with his fingers on the rail,\r\nscanning the heads below. The members were scattered far and wide through\r\nthe seats, like an army in open order, listening in silence to the\r\ndroning voice of the clerk. Moths burned in the gas flames, and June bugs\r\nhummed in at the high windows and tilted against the walls. Then Mr.\r\nDuncan's finger nails whitened as his thin hands clutched the rail, and a\r\nsense of a pending event was upon Wetherell. Slowly he realized that he\r\nwas listening to the Speaker's deep voice.\r\n\r\n\"'The Committee on Corporations, to whom was referred House Bill Number\r\n109, entitled, 'An Act to extend the Truro Railroad to Harwich, having\r\nconsidered the same, report the same with the following resolution:\r\nResolved, that the bill ought to pass. Chauncey Weed, for the\r\nCommittee.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Truro Franchise! The lights danced, and even a sudden weakness came\r\nupon the storekeeper. Jethro's trick! The Duncan and Lovejoy\r\nrepresentatives in the theatre, the adherents of the bill here! Wetherell\r\nsaw Mr. Duncan beside him, a tense figure leaning on the rail, calling to\r\nsome one below. A man darted up the centre, another up the side aisle.\r\nThen Mr. Duncan flashed at William Wetherell from his blue eye such a\r\nlook of anger as the storekeeper never forgot, and he, too, was gone.\r\nTingling and perspiring, Wetherell leaned out over the railing as the\r\nSpeaker rapped calmly for order. Hysteric laughter, mingled with hoarse\r\ncries, ran over the House, but the Honorable Heth Sutton did not even\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nA dozen members were on their feet shouting to the chair. One was\r\nrecognized, and that man Wetherell perceived with amazement to be Mr.\r\nJameson of Wantage, adherent of Jethro's--he who had moved to adjourn for\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"! A score of members crowded into the aisles, but the\r\nSpeaker's voice again rose above the tumult.\r\n\r\n\"The doorkeepers will close the doors! Mr. Jameson of Wantage moves that\r\nthe report of the Committee be accepted, and on this motion a roll-call\r\nis ordered.\"\r\n\r\nThe doorkeepers, who must have been inspired, had already slammed the\r\ndoors in the faces of those seeking wildly to escape. The clerk already\r\nhad the little, short-legged desk before him and was calling the roll\r\nwith incredible rapidity. Bewildered and excited as Wetherell was, and\r\nknowing as little of parliamentary law as the gentleman who had proposed\r\nthe woodchuck session, he began to form some sort of a notion of Jethro's\r\ngeneralship, and he saw that the innocent rural members who belonged to\r\nDuncan and Lovejoy's faction had tried to get away before the roll-call,\r\ndestroy the quorum, and so adjourn the House. These, needless to say,\r\nwere not parliamentarians, either. They had lacked a leader, they were\r\nstunned by the suddenness of the onslaught, and had not moved quickly\r\nenough. Like trapped animals, they wandered blindly about for a few\r\nmoments, and then sank down anywhere. Each answered the roll-call\r\nsullenly, out of necessity, for every one of them was a marked man. Then\r\nWetherell remembered the two members who had escaped, and Mr. Duncan, and\r\nfell to calculating how long it would take these to reach Fosters Opera\r\nHouse, break into the middle of an act, and get out enough partisans to\r\ncome back and kill the bill. Mr. Wetherell began to wish he could witness\r\nthe scene there, too, but something held him here, shaking with\r\nexcitement, listening to each name that the clerk called.\r\n\r\nWould the people at the theatre get back in time?\r\n\r\nDespite William Wetherell's principles, whatever these may have been, he\r\nwas so carried away that he found himself with his watch in his hand,\r\ncounting off the minutes as the roll-call went on. Fosters Opera House\r\nwas some six squares distant, and by a liberal estimate Mr. Duncan and\r\nhis advance guard ought to get back within twenty minutes of the time he\r\nleft. Wetherell was not aware that people were coming into the gallery\r\nbehind him; he was not aware that one sat at his elbow until a familiar\r\nvoice spoke, directly into his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Will--held Duncan pretty tight--didn't you? He's a hard one to fool,\r\ntoo. Never suspected a mite, did he? Look out for your watch!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby seized it or it would have fallen. If his life had depended on\r\nit, William Wetherell could not have spoken a word to Mr. Bixby then.\r\n\r\n\"You done well, Will, sure enough,\" that gentleman continued to whisper.\r\n\"And Alvy's gal done well, too--you understand. I guess she's the only\r\none that ever snarled up Al Lovejoy so that he didn't know where he was\r\nat. But it took a fine, delicate touch for her job and yours, Will.\r\nGodfrey, this is the quickest roll-call I ever seed! They've got halfway\r\nthrough Truro County. That fellow can talk faster than a side-show,\r\nticket-seller at a circus.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk was, indeed, performing prodigies of pronunciation. When he\r\nreached Wells County, the last, Mr. Bixby so far lost his habitual sang\r\nfroid as to hammer on the rail with his fist.\r\n\r\n\"If there hain't a quorum, we're done for,\" he said. \"How much time has\r\ngone away? Twenty minutes! Godfrey, some of 'em may break loose and git\r\nhere is five minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Break loose?\" Wetherell exclaimed involuntarily.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby screwed up his face.\r\n\r\n\"You understand. Accidents is liable to happen.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherell didn't understand in the least, but just then the clerk\r\nreached the last name on the roll; an instant of absolute silence, save\r\nfor the June-bugs, followed, while the assistant clerk ran over his\r\nfigures deftly and handed them to Mr. Sutton, who leaned forward to\r\nreceive them.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative and\r\nforty-eight in the negative, and the report of the Committee is\r\naccepted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten more'n a quorum!\" ejaculated Mr. Bixby, in a voice of thanksgiving,\r\nas the turmoil below began again. It seemed as though every man in the\r\nopposition was on his feet and yelling at the chair: some to adjourn;\r\nsome to indefinitely postpone; some demanding roll-calls; others swearing\r\nat these--for a division vote would have opened the doors. Others tried\r\nto get out, and then ran down the aisles and called fiercely on the\r\nSpeaker to open the doors, and threatened him. But the Honorable Heth\r\nSutton did not lose his head, and it may be doubted whether he ever\r\nappeared to better advantage than at that moment. He had a voice like one\r\nof the Clovelly bulls that fed in his own pastures in the valley, and by\r\nsheer bellowing he got silence, or something approaching it,--the\r\nprotests dying down to a hum; had recognised another friend of the bill,\r\nand was putting another question.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gibbs of Wareham moves that the rules of the House be so far\r\nsuspended that this bill be read a second and third time by its title,\r\nand be put upon its final passage at this time. And on this motion,\"\r\nthundered Mr. Sutton, above the tide of rising voices, \"the yeas and nays\r\nare called for. The doorkeepers will keep the doors shut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abbey of Ashburton.\"\r\n\r\nThe nimble clerk had begun on the roll almost before the Speaker was\r\nthrough, and checked off the name. Bijah Bixby mopped his brow with a\r\nblue pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"My God,\" he said, \"what a risk Jethro's took! they can't git through\r\nanother roll-call. Jest look at Heth! Ain't he carryin' it magnificent?\r\nHain't as ruffled as I be. I've knowed him ever sence he wahn't no\r\nhigher'n that desk. Never would have b'en in politics if it hadn't b'en\r\nfor me. Funny thing, Will--you and I was so excited we never thought to\r\nlook at the clock. Put up your watch. Godfrey, what's this?\"\r\n\r\nThe noise of many feet was heard behind them. Men and women were crowding\r\nbreathlessly into the gallery.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't take it long to git noised araound,\" said Mr. Bixby. \"Say, Will,\r\nthey're bound to have got at 'em in the thea'tre. Don't see how they held\r\n'em off, c-cussed if I do.\"\r\n\r\nThe seconds ticked into minutes, the air became stifling, for now the\r\nfront of the gallery was packed. Now, if ever, the fate of the Truro\r\nFranchise hung in the balance, and, perhaps, the rule of Jethro Bass. And\r\nnow, as in the distance, came a faint, indefinable stir, not yet to be\r\nidentified by Wetherell's ears as a sound, but registered somewhere in\r\nhis brain as a warning note. Bijah Bixby, as sensitive as he,\r\nstraightened up to listen, and then the whispering was hushed. The\r\nmembers below raised their heads, and some clutched the seats in front of\r\nthem and looked up at the high windows. Only the Speaker sat like a wax\r\nstatue of himself, and glanced neither to the right nor to the left.\r\n\r\n\"Harkness of Truro,\" said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\"He's almost to Wells County again,\" whispered Bijah, excitedly. \"I\r\ndidn't callate he could do it. Will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will--you hear somethin'?\"\r\n\r\nA distant shout floated with the night breeze in at the windows; a man on\r\nthe floor got to his feet and stood straining: a commotion was going on\r\nat the back of the gallery, and a voice was heard crying out:--\r\n\r\n\"For the love of God, let me through!\"\r\n\r\nThen Wetherell turned to see the crowd at the back parting a little, to\r\nsee a desperate man in a gorgeous white necktie fighting his way toward\r\nthe rail. He wore no hat, his collar was wilted, and his normally ashen\r\nface had turned white. And, strangest of all, clutched tightly in his\r\nhand was a pink ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"It's Al Lovejoy,\" said Bijah, laconically.\r\n\r\nUnmindful of the awe-stricken stares he got from those about him when his\r\nidentity became known, Mr. Lovejoy gained the rail and shoved aside a man\r\nwho was actually making way for him. Leaning far out, he scanned the\r\nhouse with inarticulate rage while the roll-call went monotonously on.\r\nSome of the members looked up at him and laughed; others began to make\r\nfrantic signs, indicative of helplessness; still others telegraphed him\r\nobvious advice about reenforcements which, if anything, increased his\r\nfury. Mr. Bixby was now fanning himself with the blue handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"I hear 'em!\" he said, \"I hear 'em, Will!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did. The unmistakable hum of the voices of many men and the sound\r\nof feet on stone flagging shook the silent night without. The clerk read\r\noff the last name on the roll.\r\n\r\n\"Tompkins of Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nHis assistant lost no time now. A mistake would have been fatal, but he\r\nwas an old hand. Unmindful of the rumble on the wooden stairs below, Mr.\r\nSutton took the list with an admirable deliberation.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative,\r\nforty-eight in the negative, the rules of the House are suspended, and\"\r\n(the clerk having twice mumbled the title of the bill) \"the question is:\r\nShall the bill pass? As many as are of opinion that the bill pass will\r\nsay Aye, contrary minded No.\"\r\n\r\nFeet were in the House corridor now, and voices rising there, and noises\r\nthat must have been scuffling--yes, and beating of door panels. Almost\r\nevery member was standing, and it seemed as if they were all\r\nshouting,--\"personal privilege,\" \"fraud,\" \"trickery,\" \"open the doors.\"\r\nBijah was slowly squeezing the blood out of William Wetherell's arm.\r\n\r\n\"The doorkeepers has the keys in their pockets!\" Mr. Bixby had to shout,\r\nfor once.\r\n\r\nEven then the Speaker did not flinch. By a seeming miracle he got a\r\nsemblance of order, recognized his man, and his great voice rang through\r\nthe hall and drowned all other sounds.\r\n\r\n\"And on this question a roll-call is ordered. The doorkeepers will close\r\nthe doors!\"\r\n\r\nThen, as in reaction, the gallery trembled with a roar of laughter. But\r\nMr. Sutton did not smile. The clerk scratched off the names with\r\nlightning rapidity, scarce waiting for the answers. Every man's color was\r\nknown, and it was against the rules to be present and fail to vote. The\r\nnoise in the corridors grew louder, some one dealt a smashing kick on a\r\npanel, and Wetherell ventured to ask Mr. Bixby if he thought the doors\r\nwould hold.\r\n\r\n\"They can break in all they've a mind to now,\" he chuckled; \"the Truro\r\nFranchise is safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Wetherell demanded excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"If a member hain't present when a question is put, he can't git into a\r\nroll-call,\" said Bijah.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the day was lost was evidently brought home to those below,\r\nfor the strife subsided gradually, and finally ceased altogether. The\r\nwhispers in the gallery died down, the spectators relayed a little.\r\nLovejoy alone remained tense, though he had seated himself on a bench,\r\nand the hot anger in which he had come was now cooled into a\r\nvindictiveness that set the hard lines of his face even harder. He still\r\nclutched the ribbon. The last part of that famous roll-call was conducted\r\nso quietly that a stranger entering the House would have suspected\r\nnothing unusual. It was finished in absolute silence.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative,\r\nforty-eight in the negative, and the bill passes. The House will attend\r\nto the title of the bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"An act to extend the Truro Railroad to Harwich,\" said the clerk, glibly.\r\n\r\n\"Such will be the title of the bill unless otherwise ordered by the\r\nHouse,\" said Mr. Speaker Sutton. \"The doorkeepers will open the doors.\"\r\n\r\nSomebody moved to adjourn, the motion was carried, and thus ended what\r\nhas gone down to history as the Woodchuck Session. Pandemonium reigned.\r\nOne hundred and forty belated members fought their way in at the four\r\nentrances, and mingled with them were lobbyists of all sorts and\r\nconditions, residents and visitors to the capital, men and women to whom\r\nthe drama of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was as nothing to that of the Truro\r\nFranchise Bill. It was a sight to look down upon. Fierce wrangles began\r\nin a score of places, isolated personal remarks rose above the din, but\r\nyour New Englander rarely comes to blows; in other spots men with broad\r\nsmiles seized others by the hands and shook them violently, while Mr.\r\nSpeaker Sutton seemed in danger of suffocation by his friends. His\r\nenemies, for the moment, could get nowhere near him. On this scene Mr.\r\nBijah Bixby gazed with pardonable pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Guess there wahn't a mite of trouble about the river towns,\" he said, \"I\r\nhad 'em in my pocket. Will, let's amble round to the theatre. We ought to\r\ngit in two acts.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell went. There is no need to go into the psychology of the\r\nmatter. It may have been numbness; it may have been temporary insanity\r\ncaused by the excitement of the battle he had witnessed, for his brain\r\nwas in a whirl; or Mr. Bixby may have hypnotized him. As they walked\r\nthrough the silent streets toward the Opera House, he listened perforce\r\nto Mr. Bixby's comments upon some of the innumerable details which Jethro\r\nhad planned and quietly carried out while sitting, in the window of the\r\nThrone Room. A great light dawned on William Wetherell, but too late.\r\n\r\nJethro's trusted lieutenants (of whom, needless to say, Mr. Bixby was\r\none) had been commanded to notify such of their supporters whose fidelity\r\nand secrecy could be absolutely depended upon to attend the Woodchuck\r\nSession; and, further to guard against surprise, this order had not gone\r\nout until the last minute (hence Mr. Amos Cuthbert's conduct). The seats\r\nof these members at the theatre had been filled by accommodating\r\ntownspeople and visitors. Forestalling a possible vote on the morrow to\r\nrecall and reconsider, there remained some sixty members whose loyalty\r\nwas unquestioned, but whose reputation for discretion was not of the\r\nbest. So much for the parliamentary side of the affair, which was a\r\nrevelation of generalship and organization to William Wetherell. By the\r\ntime he had grasped it they were come in view of the lights of Fosters\r\nOpera House, and they perceived, among a sprinkling of idlers, a\r\nconspicuous and meditative gentleman leaning against a pillar. He was\r\nludicrously tall and ludicrously thin, his hands were in his trousers\r\npockets, and the skirts of his Sunday broadcloth coat hung down behind\r\nhim awry. One long foot was crossed over the other and rested on the\r\npoint of the toe, and his head was tilted to one side. He had, on the\r\nwhole, the appearance of a rather mournful stork. Mr. Bixby approached\r\nhim gravely, seized him by the lower shoulder, and tilted him down until\r\nit was possible to speak into his ear. The gentleman apparently did not\r\nresent this, although he seemed in imminent danger of being upset.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Peleg? Er--you know Will?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby seized Mr. Wetherell under the elbow, and addressed himself to\r\nthe storekeeper's ear.\r\n\r\n\"Will, I want you to shake hands with Senator Peleg Hartington, of\r\nBrampton. This is Will Wetherell, Peleg,--from Coniston--you understand.\"\r\n\r\nThe senator took one hand from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"How be you?\" he said. Mr. Bixby was once more pulling down on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"H-haow was it here?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Almighty funny,\" answered Senator Hartington, sadly, and waved at the\r\nlobby. \"There wahn't standin' room in the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass Republican Club come and packed the entrance,\" explained Mr.\r\nBixby with a wink. \"You understand, Will? Go on, Peleg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sidewalk and street, too,\" continued Mr. Hartington, slowly. \"First come\r\nalong Ball of Towles, hollerin' like blazes. They crumpled him all up and\r\nlost him. Next come old man Duncan himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will kep' Duncan,\" Mr. Bixby interjected.\r\n\r\n\"That was wholly an accident,\" exclaimed Mr. Wetherell, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Will wahn't born in the country,\" said Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington bestowed on the storekeeper a mournful look, and\r\ncontinued:--\r\n\r\n\"Never seed Duncan sweatin' before. He didn't seem to grasp why the boys\r\nwas there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't seem to understand,\" put in Mr. Bixby, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"'For God's sake, gentlemen,' says he, 'let me in! The Truro Bill!' 'The\r\nTruro Bill hain't in the theatre, Mr. Duncan,' says Dan Everett. Cussed\r\nif I didn't come near laughin'. 'That's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" Mr. Duncan,'\r\nsays Dan. 'You're a dam fool,' says Duncan. I didn't know he was profane.\r\n'Make room for Mr. Duncan,' says Dan, 'he wants to see the show.' 'I'm\r\na-goin' to see you in jail for this, Everett,' says Duncan. They let him\r\npush in about half a rod, and they swallowed him. He was makin' such a\r\nnoise that they had to close the doors of the theatre--so's not to\r\ndisturb the play-actors.\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand,\" said Mr. Bixby to Wetherell. Whereupon he gave another\r\nshake to Mr. Hartington, who had relapsed into a sort of funereal\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" resumed that personage, \"there was some more come, hollerin'\r\nabout the Truro Bill. Not many. Guess they'll all have to git their\r\nwimmen-folks to press their clothes to-morrow. Then Duncan wanted to git\r\nout again, but 'twan't exactly convenient. Callated he was\r\nsuffocatin'--seemed to need air. Little mite limp when he broke loose,\r\nDuncan was.\"\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Peleg stopped again, as if he were overcome by the\r\nrecollection of Mr. Duncan's plight.\r\n\r\n\"Er--er--Peleg!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington started.\r\n\r\n\"What'd they do?--what'd they do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do?\"\r\n\r\n\"How'd they git notice to 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Hartington, \"cussed if that wuhn't funny. Let's see, where\r\nwas I? After awhile they went over t'other side of the street, talkin'\r\nsly, waitin' for the act to end. But goldarned if it ever did end.\"\r\n\r\nFor once Mr. Bixby didn't seem to understand.\r\n\r\n\"D-didn't end?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" explained Mr. Hartington; \"seems they hitched a kind of nigger\r\nminstrel show right on to it--banjos and thingumajigs in front of the\r\ncurtain while they was changin' scenes, and they hitched the second act\r\nright on to that. Nobody come out of the theatre at all. Funny notion,\r\nwahn't it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby's face took on a look of extreme cunning. He smiled broadly and\r\npoked Mr. Wetherell in an extremely sensitive portion of his ribs. On\r\nsuch occasions the nasal quality of Bijah's voice seemed to grow.\r\n\r\n\"You see?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Know that little man, Gibbs, don't ye?\" inquired Mr. Hartington.\r\n\r\n\"Airley Gibbs, hain't it? Runs a livery business daown to Rutgers, on\r\nLovejoy's railroad,\" replied Mr. Bixby, promptly. \"I know him. Knew old\r\nman Gibbs well's I do you. Mean cuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"This Airley's smart--wahn't quite smart enough, though. His bright idea\r\ncome a little mite late. Hunted up old Christy, got the key to his law\r\noffice right here in the Duncan Block, went up through the skylight,\r\nclumb down to the roof of Randall's store next door, shinned up the\r\nlightnin' rod on t'other side, and stuck his head plump into the Opery\r\nHouse window.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know!\" ejaculated Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\n\"Somethin' terrible pathetic was goin' on on the stage,\" resumed Mr.\r\nHartington, \"the folks didn't see him at first,--they was all cryin' and\r\neverythin' was still, but Airley wahn't affected. As quick as he got his\r\nbreath he hollered right out loud's he could: 'The Truro Bill's up in the\r\nHouse, boys. We're skun if you don't git thar quick.' Then they tell me'\r\nthe lightnin' rod give way; anyhow, he came down on Randall's gravel roof\r\nconsiderable hard, I take it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington, apparently, had an aggravating way of falling into\r\nmournful revery and of forgetting his subject. Mr. Bixby was forced to\r\njog him again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they did,\" he said, \"they did. They come out like the theatre was\r\nafire. There was some delay in gettin' to the street, but not much--not\r\nmuch. All the Republican Clubs in the state couldn't have held 'em then,\r\nand the profanity they used wahn't especially edifyin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peleg's a deacon--you understand,\" said Mr. Bixby. \"Say, Peleg, where\r\nwas Al Lovejoy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lovejoy come along with the first of 'em. Must have hurried some--they\r\ntell me he was settin' way down in front alongside of Alvy Hopkins's gal,\r\nand when Airley hollered out she screeched and clutched on to Al, and Al\r\nsaid somethin' he hadn't ought to and tore off one of them pink gew-gaws\r\nshe was covered with. He was the maddest man I ever see. Some of the club\r\nwas crowded inside, behind the seats, standin' up to see the show. Al was\r\nso anxious to git through he hit Si Dudley in the mouth--injured him\r\nsome, I guess. Pity, wahn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Si hain't in politics, you understand,\" said Mr. Bixby. \"Callate Si paid\r\nto git in there, didn't he, Peleg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Callate he did,\" assented Senator Hartington.\r\n\r\nA long and painful pause followed. There seemed, indeed, nothing more to\r\nbe said. The sound of applause floated out of the Opera House doors,\r\naround which the remaining loiterers were clustered.\r\n\r\n\"Goin' in, be you, Peleg?\" inquired Mr. Bixby.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Will and me had a notion to see somethin' of the show,\" said Mr. Bixby,\r\nalmost apologetically. \"I kep' my ticket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Hartington, reflectively, \"I guess you'll find some of\r\nthe show left. That hain't b'en hurt much, so far as I can ascertain.\"\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, when Mr. Isaac D. Worthington happened to be sitting\r\nalone in the office of the Truro Railroad at the capital, there came a\r\nknock at the door, and Mr. Bijah Bixby entered. Now, incredible as it may\r\nseem, Mr. Worthington did not know Mr. Bixby--or rather, did not remember\r\nhim. Mr. Worthington had not had at that time much of an experience in\r\npolitics, and he did not possess a very good memory for faces.\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby, who had, as we know, a confidential and winning manner, seated\r\nhimself in a chair very close to Mr. Worthington--somewhat to that\r\ngentleman's alarm. \"How be you?\" said Bijah, \"I-I've got a little bill\r\nhere--you understand.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington didn't understand, and he drew his chair away from Mr.\r\nBixby's.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about it, sir,\" answered the president of the\r\nTruro Railroad, indignantly; \"this is neither the manner nor the place to\r\npresent a bill. I don't want to see it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bixby moved his chair up again. \"Callate you will want to see this\r\nbill, Mr. Worthington,\" he insisted, not at all abashed. \"Jethro Bass\r\nsent it--you understand--it's engrossed.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr. Bixby drew from his capacious pocket a roll, tied with\r\nwhite ribbon, and pressed it into Mr. Worthington's hands. It was the\r\nTruro Franchise Bill.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that Mr. Worthington understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThere are certain instruments used by scientists so delicate that they\r\nhave to be wrapped in cotton wool and kept in ductless places, and so\r\nsensitive that the slightest shock will derange them. And there are\r\ncertain souls which cannot stand the jars of life--souls created to\r\nregister thoughts and sentiments too fine for those of coarser\r\nconstruction. Such was the soul of the storekeeper of Coniston. Whether\r\nor not he was one of those immortalized in the famous Elegy, it is not\r\nfor us to say. A celebrated poet who read the letters to the Guardian--at\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman's request--has declared Mr. Wetherell to have been\r\na genius. He wrote those letters, as we know, after he had piled his\r\nboxes and rolled his barrels into place; after he had added up the\r\ncolumns in his ledger and recorded, each week, the small but ever\r\nincreasing deficit which he owed to Jethro Bass. Could he have been\r\nremoved from the barrels and the ledgers, and the debts and the cares and\r\nthe implications, what might we have had from his pen? That will never be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nWe left him in the lobby of the Opera House, but he did not go in to see\r\nthe final act of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" He made his way, alone, back to the\r\nhotel, slipped in by a side entrance, and went directly to his room,\r\nwhere Cynthia found him, half an hour later, seated by the open window in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you well, Dad?\" she asked anxiously. \"Why didn't you come to see\r\nthe play?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I was detained Cynthia,\" he said. \"Yes--I am well.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him and felt his forehead and his hands, and the\r\nevents of the evening which were on her lips to tell him remained\r\nunspoken.\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to have left Coniston,\" she said; \"the excitement is too\r\nmuch for you. We will go back tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Cynthia, we will go back to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the early train,\" said Wetherell, \"and now you must go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" said Cynthia, as she kissed him good night. \"I have enjoyed\r\nit here, and I am grateful to Uncle Jethro for bringing us, but--but I\r\nlike Coniston best.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell could have slept but a few hours. When he awoke the\r\nsparrows were twittering outside, the fresh cool smells of the morning\r\nwere coming in at his windows, and the sunlight was just striking across\r\nthe roofs through the green trees of the Capitol Park. The remembrance of\r\na certain incident of the night before crept into his mind, and he got\r\nup, and drew on his clothes and thrust his few belongings into the\r\ncarpet-bag, and knocked on Cynthia's door. She was already dressed, and\r\nher eyes rested searchingly on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, you aren't well. I know it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBut he denied that he was not.\r\n\r\nHer belongings were in a neat little bundle under her arm. But when she\r\nwent to put them in the bag she gave an exclamation, knelt down, took\r\neverything out that he had packed, and folded each article over again\r\nwith amazing quickness. Then she made a rapid survey of the room lest she\r\nhad forgotten anything, closed the bag, and they went out and along the\r\ncorridor. But when Wetherell turned to go down the stairs, she stopped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to say goodby to Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I would rather go on and get in the train, Cynthia,\" he said. \"Jethro\r\nwill understand.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia was worried, but she did not care to leave him; and she led him,\r\nprotesting, into the dining room. He had a sinking fear that they might\r\nmeet Jethro there, but only a few big-boned countrymen were scattered\r\nabout, attended by sleepy waitresses. Lest Cynthia might suspect how his\r\nhead was throbbing, Wetherell tried bravely to eat his breakfast. He did\r\nnot know that she had gone out, while they were waiting, and written a\r\nnote to Jethro, explaining that her father was ill, and that they were\r\ngoing back to Coniston. After breakfast, when they went to the desk, the\r\nclerk stared at them in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Going, Mr. Wetherell?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I find that I have to get back,\" stammered the storekeeper. \"Will you\r\ntell me the amount of my bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge Bass gave me instructions that he would settle that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of Mr. Bass,\" said Wetherell, \"but I prefer to pay it\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"The judge will be very angry, Mr. Wetherell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly give me the bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk made it out and handed it over in silence. Wetherell had in his\r\npocket the money from several contributions to the Guardian, and he paid\r\nhim. Then they set out for the station, bought their tickets and hurried\r\npast the sprinkling of people there. The little train for Truro was\r\nstanding under the sheds, the hissing steam from the locomotive rising\r\nperpendicular in the still air of the morning, and soon they were settled\r\nin one of the straight-backed seats. The car was almost empty, for few\r\npeople were going up that day, and at length, after what, seemed an\r\neternity of waiting, they started, and soon were in the country once more\r\nin that wonderful Truro valley with its fruit trees and its clover\r\nscents; with its sparkling stream that tumbled through the passes and\r\nmirrored between green meadow-banks the blue and white of the sky. How\r\nhungrily they drank in the freshness of it.\r\n\r\nThey reached Truro village at eleven. Outside the little tavern there,\r\nafter dinner, the green stage was drawn up; and Tom the driver cracked\r\nhis long whip over the Morgan leaders and they started, swaying in the\r\nsand ruts and jolting over the great stones that cropped out of the road.\r\nUp they climbed, through narrow ways in the forest--ways hedged with\r\nalder and fern and sumach and wild grape, adorned with oxeye daisies and\r\ntiger lilies, and the big purple flowers which they knew and loved so\r\nwell. They passed, too, wild lakes overhung with primeval trees, where\r\nthe iris and the waterlily grew among the fallen trunks and the\r\nwater-fowl called to each other across the blue stretches. And at length,\r\nwhen the sun was beginning visibly to fall, they came out into an open\r\ncut on the western side and saw again the long line of Coniston once more\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Dad,\" said Cynthia, as she gazed, \"don't you love it better than any\r\nother place in the world?\"\r\n\r\nHe did. But he could not answer her.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, from the hilltops above Isaac Worthington's mills, they\r\nsaw the terraced steeple of Brampton church, and soon the horses were\r\nstanding with drooping heads and wet sides in front of Mr. Sherman's\r\ntavern in Brampton Street; and Lem Hallowell, his honest face aglow with\r\njoy, was lifting Cynthia out of the coach as if she were a bundle of\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" he cried, \"this is a little might sudden! What's the\r\nmatter with the capital, Will? Too wicked and sophisticated down thar to\r\nsuit ye?\" By this time, Wetherell, too, had reached the ground, and as\r\nLem Hallowell gazed into his face the laughter in his own died away and\r\ngave place to a look of concern. \"Don't wonder ye come back,\" he said,\r\n\"you're as white as Moses's hoss.\"\r\n\r\n\"He isn't feeling very well, Lem;\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Jest tuckered, that's all,\" answered Lem; \"you git him right into the\r\nstage, Cynthy, I won't be long. Hurry them things off, Tom,\" he called,\r\nand himself seized a huge crate from the back of the coach and flung it\r\non his shoulder. He had his cargo on in a jiffy, clucked to his horses,\r\nand they turned into the familiar road to Coniston just as the sun was\r\ndipping behind the south end of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be surprised some, and disappointed some,\" said Lem, cheerily;\r\n\"they was kind of plannin' a little celebration when you come back,\r\nWill--you and Cynthy. Amandy Hatch was a-goin' to bake a cake, and the\r\nminister was callatin' to say some word of welcome. Wahn't goin' to be\r\nanything grand--jest homelike. But you was right to come if you was\r\ntuckered. I guess Cynthy fetched you. Rias he kep' store and done it\r\nwell,--brisker'n I ever see him, Rias was. Wait till I put some of them\r\nthings back, and make you more comfortable, Will.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved a few parcels and packages from Wetherell's feet and glanced at\r\nCynthia as he did so. The mountain cast its vast blue shadow over forest\r\nand pasture, and above the pines the white mist was rising from Coniston\r\nWater--rising in strange shapes. Lem's voice seemed to William Wetherell\r\nto have given way to a world-wide silence, in the midst of which he\r\nsought vainly for Cynthia and the stage driver. Most extraordinary of\r\nall, out of the silence and the void came the checker-paned windows of\r\nthe store at Coniston, then the store itself, with the great oaks bending\r\nover it, then the dear familiar faces,--Moses and Amandy, Eph Prescott\r\nlimping toward them, and little Rias Richardson in an apron with a scoop\r\nshovel in his hand, and many others. They were not smiling at the\r\nstorekeeper's return--they looked very grave. Then somebody lifted him\r\ntenderly from the stage and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry a mite, Cynthy. Jest tuckered, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell was \"just tuckered.\" The great Dr. Coles, authority on\r\npulmonary troubles, who came all the way from Boston, could give no\r\nbetter verdict than that. It was Jethro Bass who had induced Dr. Coles to\r\ncome to Coniston--much against the great man's inclination, and to the\r\ndetriment of his patients: Jethro who, on receiving Cynthia's note, had\r\nleft the capital on the next train and had come to Coniston, and had at\r\nonce gone to Boston for the specialist.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know why I came,\" said the famous physician to Dr. Abraham\r\nRowell of Tarleton, \"I never shall know. There is something about that\r\nman Jethro Bass which compels you to do his will. He has a most\r\nextraordinary personality. Is this storekeeper a great friend of his?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only intimate friend he had in the world,\" answered Dr. Rowell;\r\n\"none of us could ever understand it. And as for the girl, Jethro Bass\r\nworships her.\"\r\n\r\n\"If nursing could cure him, I'd trust her to do it. She's a natural-born\r\nnurse.\"\r\n\r\nThe two physicians were talking in low tones in the little garden behind\r\nthe store when Jethro came out of the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"He looks as if he were suffering too,\" said the Boston physician, and he\r\nwalked toward Jethro and laid a hand upon his shoulders. \"I give him\r\nuntil winter, my friend,\" said Dr. Coles.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass sat down on the doorstep--on that same millstone where he had\r\ntalked with Cynthia many years before--and was silent for a long while.\r\nThe doctor was used to scenes of sorrow, but the sight of this man's\r\nsuffering unnerved him, and he turned from it.\r\n\r\n\"D-doctor?\" said Jethro, at last.\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned again: \"Yes?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"D-doctor--if Wetherell hadn't b'en to the capital would he have\r\nlived--if he hadn't been to the capital?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Dr. Coles, \"if Mr. Wetherell had always lived in a warm\r\nhouse, and had always been well fed, and helped over the rough places and\r\nshielded from the storms, he might have lived longer. It is a marvel to\r\nme that he has lived so long.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the doctor went way, back to Boston. Many times in his long\r\nprofessional life had the veil been lifted for him--a little. But as he\r\nsat in the train he said to himself that in this visit to the hamlet of\r\nConiston he had had the strangest glimpse of all. William Wetherell\r\nrallied, as Dr. Coles had predicted, from that first sharp attack, and\r\none morning they brought up a reclining chair which belonged to Mr.\r\nSatterlee, the minister, and set it in the window. There, in the still\r\ndays of the early autumn, Wetherell looked down upon the garden he had\r\ngrown to love, and listened to the song of Coniston Water. There Cynthia,\r\nwho had scarcely left his side, read to him from Keats and Shelley and\r\nTennyson--yet the thought grew on her that he did not seem to hear. Even\r\nthat wonderful passage of Milton's, beginning \"So sinks the day-star in\r\nthe ocean bed,\" which he always used to beg her to repeat, did not seem\r\nto move him now.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors came and sat with him, but he would not often speak. Cheery\r\nLem Hallowell and his wife, and Cousin Ephraim, to talk about the war,\r\nhobbling slowly up the stairs--for rheumatism had been added to that\r\ntrouble of the Wilderness bullet now, and Ephraim was getting along in\r\nyears; and Rias Richardson stole up in his carpet slippers; and Moses,\r\nafter his chores were done, and Amandy with her cakes and delicacies,\r\nwhich he left untouched--though Amandy never knew it. Yes, and Jethro\r\ncame. Day by day he would come silently into the room, and sit silently\r\nfor a space, and go as silently out of it. The farms were neglected now\r\non Thousand Acre Hill. William Wetherell would take his hand, and speak\r\nto him, but do no more than that.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Cynthia leaned over him, listening as he breathed\r\nto know whether he slept or were awake. If he were not sleeping, he would\r\nspeak her name: he repeated it often in those days, as though the sound\r\nof it gave him comfort; and he would fall asleep with it on his lips,\r\nholding her hand, and thinking, perhaps, of that other Cynthia who had\r\ntended and nursed and shielded him in other days. Then she would steal\r\ndown the stairs to Jethro on the doorstep: to Jethro who would sit there\r\nfor hours at a time, to the wonder and awe of his neighbors. Although\r\nthey knew that he loved the storekeeper as he loved no other man, his was\r\na grief that they could not understand.\r\n\r\nCynthia used to go to Jethro in the garden. Sorrow had brought them very\r\nnear together; and though she had loved him before, now he had become her\r\nreliance and her refuge. The first time Cynthia saw him; when the worst\r\nof the illness had passed and the strange and terrifying apathy had come,\r\nshe had hidden her head on his shoulder and wept there. Jethro kept that\r\ncoat, with the tear stains on it, to his dying day, and never wore it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes--sometimes I think if he hadn't gone to the capital, Cynthy,\r\nthis mightn't hev come,\" he said to her once.\r\n\r\n\"But the doctor said that didn't matter, Uncle Jethro,\" she answered,\r\ntrying to comfort him. She, too, believed that something had happened at\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n\"N-never spoke to you about anything there--n-never spoke to you,\r\nCynthia?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never,\" she said. \"He--he hardly speaks at all, Uncle Jethro.\"\r\n\r\nOne bright morning after the sun had driven away the frost, when the\r\nsumacs and maples beside Coniston Water were aflame with red, Bias\r\nRichardson came stealing up the stairs and whispered something to\r\nCynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Dad,\" she said, laying down her book, \"it's Mr. Merrill. Will you see\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell gave her a great fright. He started up from his\r\npillows, and seized her wrist with a strength which she had not thought\r\nremained in his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Merrill!\" he cried--\"Mr. Merrill here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Cynthia, agitatedly, \"he's downstairs--in the store.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him to come up,\" said Wetherell, sinking back again, \"ask him to\r\ncome up.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia, as she stood in the passage, was of two minds about it. She was\r\nthoroughly frightened, and went first to the garden to ask Jethro's\r\nadvice. But Jethro, so Milly Skinner said, had gone off half an hour\r\nbefore, and did not know that Mr. Merrill had arrived. Cynthia went back\r\nagain to her father.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Mr. Merrill?\" asked Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, do you think you ought to see him? He--he might excite you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I insist upon seeing him, Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell had never said anything like that before. But Cynthia\r\nobeyed him, and presently led Mr. Merrill into the room. The kindly\r\nlittle railroad president was very serious now. The wasted face of the\r\nstorekeeper, enhanced as it was by the beard, gave Mr. Merrill such a\r\nshock that he could not speak for a few moments--he who rarely lacked for\r\ncheering words on any occasion. A lump rose in his throat as he went over\r\nand stood by the chair and took the sick man's hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you came, Mr. Merrill,\" said Wetherell, simply, \"I wanted to\r\nspeak to you. Cynthia, will you leave us alone for a few minutes?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia went, troubled and perplexed, wondering at the change in him. He\r\nhad had something on his mind--now she was sure of it--something which\r\nMr. Merrill might be able to relieve.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Merrill who spoke first when she was gone.\r\n\r\n\"I was coming up to Brampton,\" he said, \"and Tom Collins, who drives the\r\nTruro coach, told me you were sick. I had not heard of it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill, too, had something on his mind, and did not quite know how\r\nto go on. There was in William Wetherell, as he sat in the chair with his\r\neyes fixed on his visitor's face, a dignity which Mr. Merrill had not\r\nseen before--had not thought the man might possess.\r\n\r\n\"I was coming to see you, anyway,\" Mr. Merrill said.\r\n\r\n\"I did you a wrong--though as God judges me, I did not think of it at the\r\ntime. It was not until Alexander Duncan spoke to me last week that I\r\nthought of it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" continued Mr. Merrill wiping his brow, for he found the matter\r\neven more difficult than he had imagined, \"it was not until Duncan told\r\nme how you had acted in his library that I guessed the truth--that I\r\nremembered myself how you had acted. I knew that you were not mixed up in\r\npolitics, but I also knew that you were an intimate friend of Jethro's,\r\nand I thought that you had been let into the secret of the woodchuck\r\nsession. I don't defend the game of politics as it is played, Mr.\r\nWetherell, but all of us who are friends of Jethro's are generally\r\nwilling to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going on, and have\r\na practical joke when we can. It was not until I saw you sitting there\r\nbeside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make a great deal\r\nof difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or not, provided\r\nthey didn't learn of the matter too early, because some of their men had\r\nbeen bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of humor to play the\r\ngame that way--and it was very effective. When I saw you there beside\r\nDuncan I remembered that he had spoken about the Guardian letters, and\r\nthe notion occurred to me to get him to show you his library. I have\r\nexplained to him that you were innocent. I--I hope you haven't been\r\nworrying.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell sat very still for a while, gazing out of the window,\r\nbut a new look had come into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass did not know that you--that you had used me?\" he asked at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Merrill thickly, \"no. He didn't know a thing about\r\nit--he doesn't know it now, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nA smile came upon Wetherell's face, but Mr. Merrill could not look at it.\r\n\r\n\"You have made me very happy,\" said the storekeeper, tremulously. \"I--I\r\nhave no right to be proud--I have taken his money--he has supported my\r\ndaughter and myself all these years. But he had never asked me to--to do\r\nanything, and I liked to think that he never would.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill could not speak. The tears were streaming down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to promise me, Mr. Merril!\" he went on presently, \"I want you\r\nto promise me that you will never speak to Jethro, of this, or to my\r\ndaughter, Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill merely nodded his head in assent. Still he could not speak.\r\n\r\n\"They might think it was this that caused my death. It was not. I know\r\nvery well that I am worn out, and that I should have gone soon in any\r\ncase. And I must leave Cynthia to him. He loves her as his own child.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell, his faith in Jethro restored, was facing death as he\r\nhad never faced life. Mr. Merrill was greatly affected.\r\n\r\n\"You must not speak of dying, Wetherell,\" said he, brokenly. \"Will you\r\nforgive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to forgive, now that you have explained matters, Mr.\r\nMerrill\" said the storekeeper, and he smiled again. \"If my fibre had been\r\na little tougher, this thing would never have happened. There is only one\r\nmore request I have to make. And that is, to assure Mr. Duncan, from me,\r\nthat I did not detain him purposely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will see him on my way to Boston,\" answered Mr. Merrill.\r\n\r\nThen Cynthia was called. She was waiting anxiously in the passage for the\r\ninterview to be ended, and when she came in one glance at her father's\r\nface told her that he was happier. She, too, was happier.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would come every day, Mr. Merrill\" she said, when they\r\ndescended into the garden after the three had talked awhile. \"It is the\r\nfirst time since he fell ill that he seems himself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill's answer was to take her hand and pat it. He sat down on the\r\nmillstone and drew a deep breath of that sparkling air and sighed, for\r\nhis memory ran back to his own innocent boyhood in the New England\r\ncountry. He talked to Cynthia until Jethro came.\r\n\r\n\"I have taken a fancy to this girl, Jethro,\" said the little railroad\r\npresident, \"I believe I'll steal her; a fellow can't have too many of\r\n'em, you know. I'll tell you one thing,--you won't keep her always shut\r\nup here in Coniston. She's much too good to waste on the desert air.\"\r\nPerhaps Mr. Merrill, too, had been thinking of the Elegy that morning. \"I\r\ndon't mean to run down Coniston it's one of the most beautiful places I\r\never saw. But seriously, Jethro, you and Wetherell ought to send her to\r\nschool in Boston after a while. She's about the age of my girls, and she\r\ncan live in my house: Ain't I right?\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't know but what you be, Steve,\" Jethro answered slowly.\r\n\r\n\"I am right,\" declared Mr. Merrill \"you'll back me in this, I know it.\r\nWhy, she's like your own daughter. You remember what I say. I mean\r\nit.--What are you thinking about, Cynthia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't leave Dad and Uncle Jethro,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless your soul,\" said Mr. Merrill \"bring Dad along. We'll find\r\nroom for him. And I guess Uncle Jethro will get to Boston twice a month\r\nif you're there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Merrill got into the buggy with Mr. Sherman and drove away to\r\nBrampton, thinking of many things.\r\n\r\n\"S-Steve's a good man,\" said Jethro. \"C-come up here from Brampton to see\r\nyour father--did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Cynthia, \"he is very kind.\" She was about to tell Jethro\r\nwhat a strange difference this visit had made in her father's spirits,\r\nbut some instinct kept her silent. She knew that Jethro had never ceased\r\nto reproach himself for inviting Wetherell to the capital, and she was\r\nsure that something had happened there which had disturbed her father and\r\nbrought on that fearful apathy. But the apathy was dispelled now, and she\r\nshrank from giving Jethro pain by mentioning the fact.\r\n\r\nHe never knew, indeed, until many years afterward, what had brought\r\nStephen Merrill to Coniston. When Jethro went up the stairs that\r\nafternoon, he found William Wetherell alone, looking out over the garden\r\nwith a new peace and contentment in his eyes. Jethro drew breath when he\r\nsaw that look, as if a great load had been lifted from his heart.\r\n\r\n\"F-feelin' some better to-day, Will?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I am well again, Jethro,\" replied the storekeeper, pressing Jethro's\r\nhand for the first time in months.\r\n\r\n\"S-soon be, Will,\" said Jethro, \"s-soon be.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell, who was not speaking of the welfare of the body, did not\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" he said presently, \"there is a little box lying in the top of\r\nmy trunk over there in the corner. Will you get it for me.\"\r\n\r\nJethro rose and opened the rawhide trunk and handed the little rosewood\r\nbox to his friend. Wetherell took it and lifted the lid reverently, with\r\nthat same smile on his face and far-off look in his eyes, and drew out a\r\nsmall daguerreotype in a faded velvet frame. He gazed at the picture a\r\nlong time, and then he held it out to Jethro; and Jethro looked at it,\r\nand his hand trembled.\r\n\r\nIt was a picture of Cynthia Ware. And who can say what emotions it awoke\r\nin Jethro's heart? She was older than the Cynthia he had known, and yet\r\nshe did not seem so. There was the same sweet, virginal look in the gray\r\neyes, and the same exquisite purity in the features. He saw her again--as\r\nif it were yesterday--walking in the golden green light under the village\r\nmaples, and himself standing in the tannery door; he saw the face under\r\nthe poke bonnet on the road to Brampton, and heard the thrush singing in\r\nthe woods. And--if he could only blot out that scene from his\r\nlife!--remembered her, a transformed Cynthia,--remembered that face in\r\nthe lantern-light when he had flung back the hood that shaded it; and\r\nthat hair which he had kissed, wet, then, from the sleet. Ah, God, for\r\nthat briefest of moments she had been his!\r\n\r\nSo he stared at the picture as it lay in the palm of his hand, and forgot\r\nhim who had been her husband. But at length he started, as from a dream,\r\nand gave it back to Wetherell, who was watching him. Her name had never\r\nbeen mentioned between the two men, and yet she had been the one woman in\r\nthe world to both.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange,\" said William Wetherell, \"it is strange that I should\r\nhave had but two friends in my life, and that she should have been one\r\nand you the other. She found me destitute and brought me back to life and\r\nmarried me, and cared for me until she died. And after that--you cared\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you mustn't think of that, Will, 'twahn't much what I did--no more\r\nthan any one else would hev done!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was everything,\" answered the storekeeper, simply; \"each of you came\r\nbetween me and destruction. There is something that I have always meant\r\nto tell you, Jethro,--something that it may be a comfort for you to know.\r\nCynthia loved you.\"\r\n\r\nJethro Bass did not answer. He got up and stood in the window, looking\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"When she married me,\" Wetherell continued steadily, \"she told me that\r\nthere was one whom she had never been able to drive from her heart. And\r\none summer evening, how well I recall it!--we were walking under the\r\ntrees on the Mall and we met my old employer, Mr. Judson, the jeweller.\r\nHe put me in mind of the young countryman who had come in to buy a\r\nlocket, and I asked her if she knew you. Strange that I should have\r\nremembered your name, wasn't it? It was then that she led me to a bench\r\nand confessed that you were the man whom she could not forget. I used to\r\nhate you then--as much as was in me to hate. I hated and feared you when\r\nI first came to Coniston. But now I can tell you--I can even be happy in\r\ntelling you.\"\r\n\r\nJethro Bass groaned. He put his hand to his throat as though he were\r\nstifling. Many, many years ago he had worn the locket there. And now? Now\r\nan impulse seized him, and he yielded to it. He thrust his hand in his\r\ncoat and drew out a cowhide wallet, and from the wallet the oval locket\r\nitself. There it was, tarnished with age, but with that memorable\r\ninscription still legible,--\"Cynthy, from Jethro\"; not Cynthia, but\r\nCynthy. How the years fell away as he read it! He handed it in silence to\r\nthe storekeeper, and in silence went to the window again. Jethro Bass was\r\na man who could find no outlet for his agony in speech or tears.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Wetherell, \"I thought you would have kept it. Dear, dear, how\r\nwell I remember it! And I remember how I patronized you when you came\r\ninto the shop. I believed I should live to be something in the world,\r\nthen. Yes, she loved you, Jethro. I can die more easily now that I have\r\ntold you--it has been on my mind all these years.\"\r\n\r\nThe locket fell open in William Wetherell's hand, for the clasp had\r\nbecome worn with time, and there was a picture of little Cynthia within:\r\nof little Cynthia,--not so little now,--a photograph taken in Brampton\r\nthe year before. Wetherell laid it beside the daguerreotype.\r\n\r\n\"She looks like her,\" he said aloud; \"but the child is more vigorous,\r\nmore human--less like a spirit. I have always thought of Cynthia Ware as\r\na spirit.\"\r\n\r\nJethro turned at the words, and came and stood looking over Wetherell's\r\nshoulder at the pictures of mother and daughter. In the rosewood box was\r\na brooch and a gold ring--Cynthia Ware's wedding ring--and two small\r\nslips of yellow paper. William Wetherell opened one of these, disclosing\r\na little braid of brown hair. He folded the paper again and laid it in\r\nthe locket, and handed that to Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"It is all I have to give you,\" he said, \"but I know that you will\r\ncherish it, and cherish her, when I am gone. She--she has been a daughter\r\nto both of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jethro, \"I will.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell lived but a few days longer. They laid him to rest at\r\nlast in the little ground which Captain Timothy Prescott had hewn out of\r\nthe forest with his axe, where Captain Timothy himself lies under his\r\nslate headstone with the quaint lettering of bygone days.--That same\r\nautumn Jethro Bass made a pilgrimage to Boston, and now Cynthia Ware\r\nsleeps there, too, beside her husband, amid the scenes she loved so well.",
