VI.--September, 1864--No. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot of those affairs which are domestic in a broad, national sense; not\r\nof any of our home institutions, 'peculiar' or otherwise; not of\r\npolitics in any shape, nor of railroads and canals, nor of interstate\r\nrelations, reconstructions, amnesty; not even of the omnivorous\r\nquestion, The War, do I propose to treat under the head of 'Our Domestic\r\nAffairs;' but of a subject which, though scarcely ever discussed except\r\nflippantly, and with unworthy levity, in that broad arena of public\r\njournalism in which almost every other conceivable topic is discussed,\r\nis yet second to none, if not absolutely first of all in its bearings\r\nupon our domestic happiness. I refer to the question of domestic service\r\nin our households.\r\n\r\nThe only plausible explanation of the singular fact that this important\r\nsubject is not more frequently discussed in public is, undoubtedly, to\r\nbe found in its very magnitude. Men and women whose 'mission' it is to\r\nenlighten and instruct the people, abound in every walk of morals.\r\nReligion, science, ethics, and every department of social economy but\r\nthis, have their 'reformers.' Before the great problem, How shall the\r\nevils which attend our domestic service be removed? the stoutest-hearted\r\nreformer stands appalled. These evils are so multiform and\r\nall-pervading, they strike their roots so strongly, and ramify so\r\nextensively, that they defy the attempt to eradicate them; and they are\r\nthus left to flourish and increase. We have plenty of groans over these\r\nevils, but scarcely ever a thoughtful consideration of their cause, or\r\nan attempt worth noting to remove or mitigate them.\r\n\r\nThis is surely cowardly and wrong. This great question, which is really\r\nso engrossing that it is more talked of in the family circle than any\r\nother--this profound and intricate problem, upon the solution of which\r\nthe comfort, happiness, and thrift of every household in the land depend\r\nmore than upon almost any other--surely demands the most careful study,\r\nand the deepest solicitude of the reformer and philanthropist. The\r\nsubject just now is receiving considerable attention in England, and the\r\njournals and periodicals of that country have recently teemed with\r\narticles setting forth the miseries with which English households are\r\nafflicted, owing to the want of good servants. But, unfortunately, from\r\nnone of these has the writer been able to extract much assistance in\r\npreparing an answer to the only practical question: How are the evils\r\nof domestic service to be remedied? I quote, however, an extract from a\r\nrecent article in _The Victoria Magazine_, in order to show how far the\r\ncomplaints made in England of the shortcomings of servants run parallel\r\nwith those of our own housekeepers. It is to be noted that the writer\r\nconfessedly holds a brief for the servants. If the facts are fairly\r\nstated, the relation between a servant in an English family and her\r\nemployer differs widely from the like relation with us;\r\n\r\n     'The prizes in domestic service are few, the blanks many. Ladies\r\n     think only of the prizes. Needlewomen and factory girls, when they\r\n     turn their attention to domestic service, see the hardworked,\r\n     underfed scrub lacking the one condition which goes far to\r\n     alleviate the hardest lot, that of personal liberty. People who\r\n     have never known what it is to be subject to the caprices of a\r\n     petty tyrant, scarcely appreciate this alleviation at its true\r\n     value. They expatiate upon the light labors, the abundance, the\r\n     freedom from anxiety which characterize the lot of servants in good\r\n     places, with an unction worthy of Southern slaveholders. What more\r\n     any woman can want they cannot understand. They think it nothing\r\n     that a servant has not, from week to week, and month to month, a\r\n     moment that she can call her own, a single hour of the day or\r\n     night, of which she can say, 'This is mine, and no one has a right\r\n     to prescribe what I shall do with it'--that, in most cases, she has\r\n     no recognized right to invite any one to come and see her, and\r\n     therefore can have no full and satisfying sense of home--that many\r\n     mistresses go so far as to claim the regulation of her dress--that\r\n     even in mature age and by the kindest employers she is treated more\r\n     as a child to be taken care of than as a responsible, grown-up\r\n     woman, able to think and judge for herself. These are substantial\r\n     drawbacks to the lot of the pampered menial.... These complaints of\r\n     the readiness of servants to leave their places are based on the\r\n     assumption that they are under obligations to their employers. In\r\n     many cases, no doubt, they are, though probably least so where\r\n     gratitude is most expected. But, at any rate, employers are also\r\n     under obligations to them. When one thinks of all servants do for\r\n     us, and how little, comparatively, we do for them, it appears that\r\n     the demand for gratitude might come more appropriately from the\r\n     other side. It is an old saying that we value in others the virtues\r\n     which are convenient to ourselves, and this is curiously\r\n     illustrated in the popular ideal of a good servant. In the master's\r\n     estimate besides the indispensable physical qualification of\r\n     vigorous health--diligence, punctuality, cleverness, readiness to\r\n     oblige, and rigid honesty, of a certain sort, are essentials.'\r\n\r\nWe would look long through our laundries and kitchens for the\r\n'hardworked, underfed scrub' of the above extract; and the 'servant who\r\nhas not from week to week, and month to month, a moment that she can\r\ncall her own, a single hour of the day or night, of which she can say,\r\nThis is mine,' etc., does not belong to so numerous a class that her\r\nsorrows in this respect invoke commiseration in the public journals. But\r\ngreat as is the difference still between English and American servants,\r\nas indicated by the above extract, the former are in a steadily\r\n'progressive' state, and every year brings them nearer in their\r\ncondition to the happy--and, fortunately for the rest of mankind, as yet\r\nanomalous--state of American domesticdom. An article in the London\r\n_Saturday Review_ thus comments upon this progress:\r\n\r\n     'It seems to be too generally forgotten that servants are a part of\r\n     the social system, and that, as the social system changes, the\r\n     servants change with it. In the days of our great-grandmothers, the\r\n     traditions of the patriarchal principle and the subtile influences\r\n     of feudalism had not died out. 'Servitude' had scarcely lost its\r\n     etymological significance, and there was something at least of the\r\n     best elements of slavery in the mutual relation of master and\r\n     servant. There was an identification of interests; wages were\r\n     small; hiring for a year under penal obligations was the rule of\r\n     domestic service; and facilities for changing situations were rare\r\n     and legally abridged. It was as in married life; as the parties to\r\n     the contract were bound to make the best of each other, they did\r\n     make the best of each other. Servants served well, because it was\r\n     their interest to do so; masters ruled well and considerately, for\r\n     the same practical reason. Add to this that the class of hirers was\r\n     relatively small, while the class of hired and the opportunities of\r\n     choice were relatively large. These conditions are now reversed. As\r\n     education has advanced, the social condition of the class from\r\n     which servants are taken has been elevated, and it is thought to be\r\n     something of a degradation to serve at all. 'I am a servant, not a\r\n     slave,' is the form in which Mary Jane asserts her independence;\r\n     and she is only in a state of transition to the language of her\r\n     American cousin, who observes, 'I am a help, not a servant.' It is\r\n     quite true that there are no good servants nowadays, at least none\r\n     of the old type; and the day is not perhaps so very distant when\r\n     there will be no servants at all.'\r\n\r\nThe servant classes of France, Germany, and the other Continental\r\ncountries, seem to be, to a great extent, free from the faults that\r\nbeset those of England and America. A recent number of _Bell's Weekly\r\nMessenger_ thus discusses this difference:\r\n\r\n     'The truth is that among the Celtic and Sclavonian families service\r\n     is felt to be honorable; those engaged in it take it up as a\r\n     respectable and desirable condition. They are as willing to\r\n     acknowledge it as the physician, the lawyer, or the clergyman is to\r\n     admit and be proud of their own. A French female servant, at least\r\n     away from Paris, wears a dress which marks at once what she is. She\r\n     is not ashamed of her condition, and nowhere is there such real\r\n     attachment between servants and their employers as in France. In\r\n     England, on the other hand, it is difficult to persuade a young\r\n     girl to accept domestic service; she requires what she imagines to\r\n     be something higher, or--to use her own word--more 'genteel.' If\r\n     she be a dressmaker, or a shop girl, or a barmaid, she assumes the\r\n     title of 'young lady,' and advertises--to the disgust of all\r\n     sensible people--as such. This monstrous notion, which strikes at\r\n     the root of all social comfort, and a great deal of social\r\n     respectability, is on the increase among us. It is not quite so\r\n     rampant as it is in America, but it is tending in the same\r\n     direction. In fact, our household prospects are not promising.\r\n     Since we feel that home cookery is far from rivalling that of the\r\n     clubs, restaurants are being established in the city equal to those\r\n     of Paris, and the cartoon of _Punch_ is daily fulfilled with a\r\n     terrible accuracy. 'What has your mistress for dinner to-day?' says\r\n     the master of the house, on the doorstep, his face toward the city.\r\n     'Cold mutton, sir.' 'Cold mutton! Ah! very nice; _very_ nice. By\r\n     the by, Mary, you may just mention to your mistress that I _may_\r\n     perhaps be detained rather later than usual to-day, and she is not\r\n     to wait dinner for me.' With these things before our eyes, we\r\n     cannot but feel grateful to any one who will _bona fide_ undertake\r\n     to teach a little plain cookery. The want of this is the cause of\r\n     more waste than any other deficiency. The laboring man marries; but\r\n     he marries a woman who can add nothing to the comfort of his home;\r\n     she supplies him with more mouths to feed, and she spoils that\r\n     which is to be put into them; she becomes slatternly, feels her own\r\n     incapacity, and, finding that she can do but little of her duty,\r\n     soon leaves off trying to do it at all. As her family increases the\r\n     discomforts of her home increase, and the end is\r\n     frequently--drunkenness, violence, and appeals to the police\r\n     magistrate.'\r\n\r\nThe writer of the present article pretends to no peculiar fitness for\r\nthe investigation of this important subject, and to no more varied and\r\nprofound experience than that which has fallen to the lot of tens of\r\nthousands of others; but much observation leads to the conviction that\r\nthe experience of any single family extending through a series of years\r\nof housekeeping, may be taken as a type of that of all families who have\r\nto employ servants; and if what shall be advanced in these pages shall\r\nhave the effect of stimulating others more competent to thought upon the\r\nsubject, with a view to practical suggestions for the amelioration of\r\nthe universal difficulty, much will have been gained.\r\n\r\nThe chief evils we have to consider on the part of servants are,\r\nbriefly, ignorance, wastefulness, untidiness, pertness, or downright\r\nimpudence, and what is called 'independence,' a term which all\r\nhousekeepers thoroughly understand. I leave out of the category the\r\nvices of intemperance and dishonesty, which, although lamentably\r\nprevalent among the class to which we are accustomed to look for our\r\nmain supply of domestics, yet do not belong, as do the other faults I\r\nhave named, to the entire class, and I gladly set them down as moral\r\nobliquities, as likely to be exceptional in the class under\r\nconsideration as in any other. With regard to the other specified\r\nfailings, every housekeeper will allow that it is so much the rule for a\r\nservant to be afflicted with the whole catalogue, that the mistress who\r\ndiscovers her hired girl to be possessed of a single good quality, the\r\nreverse of any I have named, as for example, economy, neatness, or a\r\nconscientious devotion to the interests of her employers, although she\r\nmay utterly lack any other, fears to dismiss her, for fear that the next\r\nmay prove an average 'help,' and have not a solitary good point. A girl\r\nwho combines all the above-named good qualities is a rare treasure\r\nindeed, and the possessor of the prize is an object of envy, wide and\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the causes which produce bad servants, I shall\r\nconfine myself more especially to those which develop in them the faults\r\nof wastefulness, impudence, and 'independence,' both because every\r\nhousekeeper will allow that they are the most common as well as trying\r\nof all, and because it is only for them, I confess freely, I have any\r\nhope of suggesting a remedy. Ignorance of their duties is chronic in all\r\nIrish and German girls when they first go out to service, and their\r\nacquirement of the requisite knowledge depends very much upon the amount\r\nof such knowledge possessed by the housekeeper who has the privilege of\r\ninitiating them. Untidiness is almost equally universal among the same\r\nclasses, and, being a natural propensity, is extremely difficult of\r\neradication. It may be stated, however, that given an average\r\n'greenhorn,' Irish or German, the notable and tidy housewife will make\r\nof her a very fair servant, as well instructed as her native\r\nintelligence will allow, and, unless a downright incorrigible, whose\r\nnatural slatternliness is beyond the reach of improvement, a certainly\r\ntolerably neat, and possibly a very tidy servant. And just here I will\r\nremark that it is an unquestionable fact that the good housekeeper has a\r\nmuch more encouraging prospect of making a useful servant out of one of\r\nthese same 'greenhorns' than of a girl who has been longer in the\r\ncountry, and who has nevertheless yet to be 'licked into shape.' Of\r\ncourse this remark covers the whole ground, and it is obvious that to\r\n_start_ a girl right in habits of economy, respectfulness, etc., is\r\nquite as important as to start her right in any other good habit. It is\r\nnot necessary to say further that starting right is not of itself\r\nenough: there must ever accompany the progress of the servant in\r\nimprovement, the watchful eye and guiding hand of the skilled mistress\r\nand head of the family. I cannot, within the scope of this article,\r\nenter into the consideration of the important correlative branch of my\r\nsubject, which includes the fitness of housekeepers to make good\r\nservants out of the rough, to keep good what they so find, or to improve\r\nsuch as they receive, be they good or bad. It is obvious that this\r\nfitness presupposes a practical knowledge of the science of\r\nhousekeeping--(how worthy it is to be called a 'science'!)--and a\r\nwillingness to accept and carry out the responsibilities which devolve\r\nupon the mistress of a family. I admit that very many of those who keep\r\nservants are utterly unfit in many important senses for the\r\nresponsibilities of family economists. Yet I still believe it possible\r\nfor even the most inexperienced housekeepers to adopt and pursue, in\r\ntheir management of servants, one or two cardinal principles which will\r\nsave them a vast deal of vexation. Of these, more hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe very prevalent pertness and 'independence' of servants are due,\r\nprimarily, unquestionably to the great demand for them, and the ease\r\nwith which situations are procured. This is not, in my judgment, because\r\nthe supply is inadequate; I do not believe it is. It is because the\r\nfrequent changings of servants by our families places it in the power of\r\nevery one of the former to procure a situation without the slightest\r\ntrouble. A girl about to leave a place has but to inquire for two or\r\nthree doors around, to find some family about to change 'help.' This\r\n'independence' is also undoubtedly fostered by a false and exaggerated\r\nidea which these girls imbibe from their brothers, 'cousins,' etc.--the\r\nvoting 'sovereigns' of the land--of the dignity of their new republican\r\nrelation. Most of the 'greenhorns' _begin_ humbly enough, but, after a\r\nfew months' tutelage of fellow servants, and especially if they pass\r\nthrough the experiences of the 'intelligence offices' (of which more\r\nanon), they are thoroughly spoiled, and become too impudent and\r\n'independent' for endurance. The male adopted citizen, fawned upon by\r\ndemagogues for his vote, is 'as good as anybody;' and why not Bridget\r\nand Katrina?\r\n\r\nNow I do not broach the abstract question of equality: I am willing to\r\nadmit that in the eye of our Maker we are, and before the law ought to\r\nbe, all equal--that is to say, _ought all to have an equal chance_; but\r\nto abolish the idea of subordination in the employed to the employer,\r\nand to abrogate the relation of dependence of the servant upon her or\r\nhis master or mistress, would simply be to reverse the teachings of\r\ninspiration and nature. As well say that the child shall be independent\r\nof the parent as that the servant shall not be subject in all reasonable\r\nthings to the master.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that this spirit of insubordination spoken of is\r\nfar more rife among girls of Irish birth who go out to service than\r\namong the Germans, Scotch, or English. Neither is there among these\r\nlatter so much clannishness, or disposition to establish the feeling\r\nunder consideration as a _class_ prejudice and principle of conduct, as\r\nthere is among the former. The absence of such a homogeneity of feeling\r\namong German, English, and Scotch domestics makes them much more\r\nfavorable subjects for the operation of the rules I propose to suggest\r\nfor their improvement.\r\n\r\nThe clannishness just alluded to is a very important influence among\r\nthose which tend to produce insubordination and other serious faults\r\namong servants. Every housekeeper must have observed that a marvellous\r\nfacility of intercommunication exists among the servant classes, and\r\nmore particularly among the Irish. There seems to be some mysterious\r\nmethod at work, whereby the troubles and bickerings of each mistress\r\nwith her 'help' are made known through the whole realm of servantdom. It\r\nis no uncommon thing for a mistress to have minutely detailed to her by\r\nher hired girl the particulars of some difficulty with a previous\r\nservant, with whom she has no reason to believe the narrator has had any\r\nintercourse. So frequently does this happen that many housekeepers\r\nreligiously believe that the Irish servants are banded together in some\r\nsort of a 'society,' in the secret conclaves of which the experiences of\r\neach kitchen are confided to the common ear. This belief is not confined\r\nto American housekeepers, but obtains very extensively in England also.\r\nThe arrest and punishment of a woman in London for giving a good\r\n'character' to a dishonest servant, who subsequently robbed her\r\nemployer, naturally caused some excitement in housekeeping circles in\r\nthat city, and numerous communications to _The Times_ evinced the\r\nfeeling upon the subject. In one of these 'A Housekeeper' boldly asserts\r\nthat there are combinations among the servants, and that housekeepers\r\nwho refuse to give a certificate of good character are 'spotted,' and\r\nfind in consequence the greatest difficulty in obtaining any servants\r\nthereafter. Indeed, she asserts that in some instances, so rigorously\r\ndoes the system work, offending families have been compelled to\r\nrelinquish housekeeping, and go into lodgings or abroad, until their\r\noffence was forgotten! The fundamental principle which our housekeepers\r\nbelieve to pervade these societies is that employers are fair game; that\r\nthe servant has to expect nothing but to be oppressed, persecuted,\r\noverworked, ground down, and taken advantage of at every opportunity,\r\nand that it is her duty, therefore, to hold the employer at bitter\r\nenmity, and to make the best fight she can.\r\n\r\nNow such a belief can scarcely be termed absurd, and yet it is\r\nunquestionably groundless. The mysterious 'understanding' of servants,\r\nand their wide knowledge of each other's experiences, may be explained\r\nupon a perfectly simple and rational theory, and I think we may venture\r\nto reject the 'society' hypothesis altogether.\r\n\r\nServant life is as much a world in itself as political, religious, or\r\nart life. Indeed, its inhabitants are even _more_ isolated and\r\nself-existent than those of any other sphere, for while the politician,\r\ntheologian, and artist are generally, to some extent, under the\r\ninfluence of interests and passions other than those which belong\r\nexclusively to their special walk, the dwellers in kitchens have but the\r\none all-embracing sphere, and its incidents, which seem to us so\r\ntrivial, are to them as important as the great events which we think are\r\nworthy of being embalmed in epics or made imperishable in history. To\r\nthem the reproof of the mistress or the loss of wages for the careless\r\npulverization of a soup tureen is lawful theme for the agitation of all\r\nservantdom. Martin Luther had his tussles with pope and devil, Handel\r\nand Gluck had their wars with the hostile cabals, Henry Clay had his\r\nJohn Randolph and Andrew Jackson--and Bridget and Catharine have their\r\ndisturbing and absorbing questions of 'wages,' and 'privileges,' and\r\nother matters; and a wrangle that the mistress forgets in a day, the\r\nmaid carefully cherishes in her memory, and makes it the theme of widest\r\ndiscussion. Without resorting, then, to the improbable notion of the\r\nexistence of a secret society among the servants, through which the\r\nknowledge of our difficulties with them is disseminated, I think the\r\ntheory above outlined sufficiently explains what seems so mysterious.\r\nThere can, however, be no question that the feeling among servants\r\ngenerally is unfortunately something like that alluded to above as the\r\nimaginary inspiration of a hypothetical society, namely, that employers\r\nare oppressive, exacting, and utterly selfish; and there is certainly a\r\ntacit understanding that, as between servant and mistress, it is\r\n'diamond cut diamond;' and the habit domestics have of making common\r\ncause with a sister in trouble, no doubt practically works as much evil\r\nas if such a society as has been mentioned really existed. The girl,\r\nconfronting her adversary, in military phrase, feels a hundred comrades\r\n'touching her elbow,' and her lip is wonderfully stiffened thereby. Now\r\nit is needless for me to say that the idea that these poor girls have,\r\nthat their employers are their natural enemies, is wrong and absurd, and\r\nevery housekeeper should endeavor to make this clear to her servants. If\r\nthis false idea could be eradicated, and the true theory established\r\nthat the interests of the employer and employe are identical, much will\r\nhave been accomplished toward making better servants.\r\n\r\nAmong the influences which are at work to spoil servants, none are more\r\nbaleful than the system, as at present conducted, of 'intelligence\r\noffices.' These agencies _might_ be and _ought_ to be among the most\r\nuseful of our social institutions: they _are_, as a class, utterly\r\nworthless, and many of them are positively dens of thieves. Almost\r\nwithout exception they are conducted upon the vicious principle I have\r\njust above discussed, and in them the servant is confirmed in her belief\r\nthat the employing class is a class of cruel oppressors. The interest of\r\nthe _employer_ seems to be held by the managers of most of these\r\ninstitutions as absolutely of no account. The following conversation,\r\nwhich actually took place in one of these offices, between its\r\nproprietor and an applicant for a domestic, will illustrate, better than\r\na lengthy disquisition could do, the system upon which too many of these\r\nemployment agencies are conducted:\r\n\r\nLADY. I want a girl for general housework.\r\n\r\nPROPRIETOR. Well, I can suit you, if you _can_ be suited. Here's a girl,\r\nnow, just out of a place, and I can recommend her (beckoning to one of\r\nthe fifty girls who are seated in full hearing of all that passes).\r\n\r\nLADY (after a few questions addressed to the girl, who, of course, can\r\ncook, and bake, and wash and iron, and is extravagantly fond of\r\n'childer,' etc., etc.). Well, there is one thing I am very particular\r\nabout. I want a girl who is _honest_. The last girl I had from you I had\r\nto discharge for making too free with my stores for the benefit of her\r\nown family relations.\r\n\r\nPROPRIETOR (with an insolent sneer). Honest! humph! that depends upon\r\nwhat you _call_ honest. _Some_ people call a girl a thief if she takes a\r\nbit of cake from the pantry without saying, 'By your leave.' (Chorus of\r\ngiggles and approbatory nods from the sympathizing audience of fifty.)\r\n\r\nThe crude notions of the respective rights of _meum_ and _tuum_\r\nfurnished the 'help' graduated by such an institution, may be imagined.\r\n\r\nSome pains are occasionally taken to provide a regular customer, whose\r\npatronage it is desirable to retain, with a good servant, but generally\r\nall is fish that comes to their net. The business is now in such ill\r\nodor that intelligence-office servants are proverbial for worthlessness\r\nand all the worst qualities of the class. I have known a thief, a\r\ndrunkard, and a vixen to be sent from one of these offices in\r\nsuccession, the victimized housekeeper finally begging that no more be\r\nsent, preferring to let the retaining fee go, than to be pestered any\r\nfurther. It is well known that the more decent and self-respecting of\r\nthe class of domestics rarely, now, enter their names upon the books of\r\nintelligence offices. Indeed, such seldom have occasion to seek places;\r\nif they do, they usually prefer to advertise.\r\n\r\nIn this employment-agency business a radical reform is needed. A\r\nrespectable and conscientious man at the head of such an institution,\r\nmanaging it upon the principle that it is just as much his interest to\r\nfurnish the employer with a good servant as to provide the servant with\r\na good place, would be truly a public benefactor. In this, as in all\r\nother kinds of business, honesty would be found the best _policy_. It is\r\na base imposition to recommend as good a servant who is known to be bad,\r\nand it is just as dishonest to recommend as good one whose character is\r\ntotally unknown. It should be the business of every purveyor of\r\nhousehold 'help' to ascertain, by rigid investigation, the characters\r\nand qualifications of those who apply for places; and they should\r\nsteadily refuse to have anything to do with any they cannot honestly\r\nrecommend. This, we repeat, they would speedily find their best policy.\r\nIn this way, and this only, can they win back the confidence and\r\npatronage of the public; and they would soon find that the worthless\r\ncharacters who now constitute their main stock in trade, would be\r\nsuperseded by a much better class. There would be another important\r\nbenefit to the servants themselves in such a course. In an office thus\r\nconducted, the known necessity of being able to show a clean record in\r\norder to procure a place, would reform many a bad servant, who now,\r\nknowing that her twenty-five cents will procure her a place (and no\r\nquestions asked by the agent, so that he need tell no lies), has no\r\nincentive to improvement or good conduct. There would soon be a rivalry\r\namong servants as to who should stand highest upon the roll of merit.\r\n\r\nThe fault which has been before alluded to under the name of\r\n'independence,' deserves more special mention than I have yet given it.\r\nIt is probably the most exasperating, as it is the most general of all\r\nthe failings of servants. It makes the timid and sensitive housekeeper a\r\nslave in her own house. No matter how grave may be the offences of her\r\nhired girl, she must bear them in the meekest silence. Even the most\r\nfriendly advice, conveyed in the blandest possible tone, is often\r\ndeclined with freezing dignity or repelled with tart resentment. The\r\ncook who makes a cinder of your joint, or sends you up disgusting slops\r\nfor coffee, or the laundress between whose clean and soiled linen you\r\nare puzzled to choose, has almost invariably the reply, uttered with a\r\nmajestic sternness that never fails to crush any but a veteran and\r\nplucky housekeeper: 'This is the first time any mistress ever found\r\nfault with _my_ cooking (or washing), and I have always lived with the\r\n_best families_, too.' The cutting emphasis with which this point of the\r\n'best families' is pushed home, is familiar to nearly every housekeeper.\r\nIt was scarcely a departure from sober truth in the lady who, on being\r\nasked if she kept a hired girl, replied that she had an Irish lady\r\nboarding with her, who occasionally condescended, when she had nothing\r\nof more consequence to do, to help a little in the work of the family.\r\nAn amusing trifle is going the rounds of the papers, which well hits\r\noff, and without much exaggeraration, the self-assumed prerogatives of\r\nthe servant girl of our great cities:\r\n\r\n     \"Now, Miss Bradford, I always likes to have a good, old-fashioned\r\n     talk with the lady I lives with, before I begins. I'm awful\r\n     tempered, but I'm dreadful forgivin'. Have you Hecker's flour,\r\n     Beebe's range, hot and cold water, stationary tubs, oilcloth on the\r\n     floor, dumb waiter?' Then follows her planned programme for the\r\n     week: 'Monday I washes. I'se to be let alone that day. Tuesday I\r\n     irons. Nobody's to come near me that day. Wednesday I bakes. I'se\r\n     to be let alone that day. Thursday I picks up the house. Nobody's\r\n     to come near me that day. Friday I goes to the city. Nobody's to\r\n     come near me that day. Saturday I bakes, and Saturday afternoon my\r\n     beau comes to see me. Nobody's to come near me that day. Sunday I\r\n     has to myself.\"\r\n\r\nI have now pointed out some of the principal faults of servants, and\r\nindicated what I believe to be some of the causes of those faults.\r\nAlluding, in passing, to some influences which it seems to me might be\r\nmade available in correcting some of these faults, I have yet to mention\r\nwhat I conceive to be the most important reason of all for the general\r\nworthlessness of the class under consideration. And in noticing this I\r\nshall necessarily couple with that notice some suggestions which I\r\nfirmly believe, if put into practice, will be exceedingly beneficial in\r\nproducing the reform we all so ardently wish for. And I feel the less\r\nhesitation in saying this, because they are based upon no theory of my\r\nown devising, but upon principles which are everywhere recognized and\r\nacted upon, except, singularly enough, in the conduct of our domestic\r\naffairs. To be brief, then, I attribute the greatest of the evils of our\r\nsystem of domestic service _to a want of business management in our\r\ndomestic affairs_.\r\n\r\nA wife, in the truest sense, is her husband's most important business\r\npartner--his partner in a more complete and comprehensive sense than any\r\nother he can have. It is not, as many seem to imagine, the business of\r\nthe wife to spend the money the husband earns. She is as much bound to\r\nforward the mutual prosperity as he is. The household is her department\r\nof the great business of life, as her husband's is the store, the\r\nmanufactory, or the office. Her department does not embrace the conduct\r\nof great enterprises, bargains, speculations, etc.; she has only to\r\nremember and act upon the brief, simple maxim: 'A penny saved is a penny\r\nearned.' In this way she can greatly advance the common weal. If she\r\nfails to act constantly upon this principle, she is an unfaithful and\r\nuntrustworthy partner, and is as much, to blame as if her husband were\r\nto neglect his stock, his shipping, his contract, or his clients. Why\r\nshould the husband be expected to manage _his_ part of the business upon\r\nsound and correct business principles--system, responsibility,\r\neconomy--while his helpmeet is letting hers go at loose ends, with a\r\nshiftlessness which if he should emulate would ruin him in a year?\r\n\r\nNow what is the principle upon which every good business man manages his\r\naffairs? Why, simply that of _sovereignty_. In his domain his will is\r\nlaw, and no employe dare question it. He has to deal with the male\r\ncounterparts of Bridget and Catharine, as porters, laborers, sometimes\r\nas cooks and waiters; but he has no trouble. The 'independent' man soon\r\ngoes out of the door. If he be a manufacturer, he does not allow his\r\nemployes to help themselves to his stores and material. He keeps, if he\r\nis a sensible man, his stock under lock and key, and exacts a rigid\r\naccountability in their use. What is to prevent the introduction of just\r\nsuch a system of accountability in the family economy? 'Why,' say many\r\nhousekeepers, 'we would not _dare_ to lock up our butter, and eggs, and\r\nflour, and sugar; we could not keep a girl a day if we doled out our\r\nstores and held our servants responsible for their economical use.' But,\r\ndear, doubting mesdames, your business partner does this every day, and\r\nwe should like to see the clerk or apprentice who would even 'look\r\nblack' at him for doing it. Perhaps your business partner has to employ\r\ngirls; if so, he has many Irish among them; don't _they_ stand his\r\nmanner of doing business, without grumbling? If they don't, they find\r\nanother shop, that's all. Suppose this case: A manufacturer of jewelry\r\nreasons as you do. He says: 'I cannot keep my hands satisfied unless I\r\ngive them free access to my stock of gold, silver, and diamonds. I must\r\nthrow open my tool drawers, so that they can help themselves; and I must\r\nnot ask how much material this or that manufactured article has taken to\r\nmake.' That man would have to shut up shop in a year, even if he were\r\nnot robbed of a dollar. Now, I ask, is it fair to expect the husband to\r\nbe orderly, systematic, and business-like, and to superintend his\r\nbusiness himself, while the wife surrenders her legitimate affairs to\r\nthe hands of ignorant and irresponsible subordinates?\r\n\r\nBut the female partner of the shrewd man of business, or the plodding,\r\nhardworking mechanic, may be inclined to say, 'I hate business,' and to\r\nthink it hard that she should be called upon to regulate her household\r\naffairs upon any such severe and rigid rules. But, my dear madam, apart\r\nfrom the clear fact that it is your duty to manage your household wisely\r\nand prudently, which we have seen cannot be done without business\r\nsystem, of which you must be the head, I assure you that such a system\r\nis neither intricate nor vexatious. It does not necessarily entail upon\r\nyou the least participation in the actual _labor_ of the family. It does\r\nnot absolutely require your personal presence at the scene of those\r\nlabors, although the woman who considers it beneath her dignity to go\r\ninto her kitchen, has no more business to undertake to keep house than\r\nthe master mechanic, who is too proud to enter his workshop, has to try\r\nto carry on a shop. The absolutely _essential_ thing is that yours\r\nshould be the directing and controlling mind, and that to you _every one\r\nin your employ should be held rigorously responsible_. Now don't tell me\r\nthat such a system cannot be introduced with the present race of\r\nservants; that you would be left half the time without anybody to do\r\nyour work; that until mistresses can combine to lay down rules for the\r\nbetter regulation of domestic service, you must submit to the present\r\nevils. You are not justified in assuming any of these things to be so,\r\nuntil you have honestly and thoroughly tried the experiment in your\r\nsingle household. To make such a system work, it is of course necessary\r\nthat your servants should be made to understand perfectly certain facts,\r\nwhich you should take pains distinctly to announce to every new domestic\r\nyou engage. They are so plainly just and reasonable that the most\r\ncaptious servant cannot take exception to them as a matter of principle.\r\nIt must depend upon your persevering spirit and firm hand that they do\r\nnot fail in practice. First, you should tell your servant that,\r\nemploying them at a stipulated rate of wages, to do certain, work,\r\n_their time belongs to you_. Tell them that you insist upon their being\r\nabsolutely under your direction and control, that you expect to grant\r\nthem all reasonable privileges, but that they must be regarded _as\r\nprivileges_, and not as _rights_. Tell them distinctly that, if you\r\nprefer to keep your stores under lock and key, it is not because you\r\nsuspect their integrity, but because you consider it as your business as\r\na housekeeper to know what is the cost of your living. Tell them that\r\nyou are in the habit of keeping an accurate account of your expenses,\r\nand that, in consequence, it is necessary that you should know of every\r\ncent that is expended. If these facts are clearly made known and\r\nconsistently acted upon, much of the trouble of managing servants is\r\ndone away with.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plan of keeping a book of family accounts only belongs\r\nincidentally to the main subject under discussion, it is so important\r\nthat I cannot refrain from a more special mention of it than is given\r\nabove. It is the simplest thing in the world, not taking more than ten\r\nminutes on an average every day. For reference, in case of a disputed\r\nbill, it is invaluable, while its influence in keeping down expenses is\r\nwonderfully wholesome.\r\n\r\nIf the affairs of a family are to be conducted on business principles,\r\nthe family account book cannot be neglected. It would be just as safe\r\nand sensible for the merchant to neglect _his_ cash book, as for his\r\ndomestic partner, who undertakes to do her business properly, to fail to\r\nkeep _her_ cash book.\r\n\r\nOne of the regulations which is proposed posed above as part of the\r\nsystem of family management is, in my judgment, as important in its\r\nbearing upon the honesty of the servant as it is upon the question of\r\neconomy. I refer to the keeping the family stores under the immediate\r\ncare of the housekeeper. It is nothing to the discredit of servants that\r\nthis is said. More people are honest _through circumstances_ than is\r\ngenerally supposed. Many a servant is tempted into habits of pilfering\r\nby the free and unquestioned access she has to the family stores. I have\r\nbefore used the case of a man carrying on a business and having employes\r\nunder him, to illustrate my subject. Suppose a merchant or a bank should\r\nallow all their clerks free access to the safe or till, they knowing no\r\ncash account was kept. If some of these boys or young men were tempted\r\nto steal, would not the blame lie chiefly at the door of those who,\r\nhaving it in their power, yet did not remove the temptation?\r\n\r\nHaving now given a few rules for the improvement of servants, which are\r\neasily tried, and which I know from observation of their practical\r\nworking are _worth_ a trial by every housekeeper, I wish to add a few\r\nwords concerning the material of which, our present supply of servants\r\nconsists, and to offer some observations upon the question of a\r\nprospective supply of possibly a better material.\r\n\r\nIt is probably no exaggeration to say that four fifths of our female\r\nservants are Irish. I have already given several reasons why this class\r\nare more intractable and difficult to manage than any other. To apply\r\nthe rules I have given to this class will be more difficult than to the\r\ndomestics of any other nation. But, as I have said, I have seen them\r\nenforced with success even in cases where an Irish domestic was the\r\nsubject. And here let me repeat that almost everything depends upon the\r\n_starting right_. No Irish girl ever yet went to a new place perfectly\r\nsure of her ground, although they generally can measure the quality of\r\ntheir mistress during the negotiations which precede the engagement. In\r\nstarting with a new servant, it is emphatically the first encounter that\r\nmust decide who is to be the ruler. Dignity, coolness, and decision,\r\nupon the first attempt to 'put on airs,' will generally bring you off\r\npermanent conqueror.\r\n\r\nBy some housekeepers German domestics are preferred. They are naturally\r\nless impulsive and more amenable to control than the Irish. Their class\r\nprejudices are not so violent; there is less unity of purpose among\r\nthem, and they are, in consequence, more favorable subjects for the\r\napplication of the rules given than are generally the Irish. It is,\r\nhowever, difficult to assimilate the German girls to American customs.\r\nThey are not apt to learn, and great patience is required in teaching\r\nthem. The virtues of order and cleanliness seem to be not only rare in\r\nthem, but exceedingly difficult to graft upon them. Their cooking,\r\nespecially, is generally execrable. But once properly trained, they make\r\nthe best of servants. They are generally contented, almost always\r\ncheerful and good tempered, and have little of that irritating pertness\r\nand 'independence' so characteristic of the Irish domestic.\r\n\r\nThat branch of the present subject which relates to the going out to\r\nservice of American women has been publicly discussed somewhat more\r\nextensively than any of the others, particularly of late, it having\r\nentered largely into the question of woman's labor, which has been\r\nattracting considerable attention. It is truly a deplorable thing that\r\nhousehold service is so generally regarded as a menial employment, not\r\nfit for an American woman to engage in. Our countrywomen will do almost\r\nanything rather than go out to service. They will work ten or twelve\r\nhours a day in close, unwholesome shops, surrounded by all the unsexing\r\nand contaminating influences attending the customary free and easy\r\ncommingling of male and female employes in such places. They will accept\r\navocations from which the native delicacy and neatness of an American\r\ngirl must revolt. They will put up with wages which will barely keep\r\nbody and soul together, wear the meanest clothes, submit to the vilest\r\ntyranny and extortion, rather than enter a position where they will have\r\nbut the natural, wholesome labor of woman to perform, that of domestic\r\nlife; accompanied by all the pure influences and comforts of a home. I\r\nwould be rejoiced if anything I could say would be useful in removing\r\nthis absurd and injurious prejudice among American women toward domestic\r\nservice. There is surely nothing menial in the work they would have to\r\ndo. It is woman's work all over the world, far more so than a hundred\r\nother occupations they now eagerly seek. Their repugnance to the\r\nposition itself is the sticking point. This repugnance is based upon a\r\nchimera. They are, in any position in which they labor for wages,\r\n'servants' in as complete a sense as if they labored for wages in\r\nhousehold employments. Far be it from me to say a word to lower that\r\njust and honorable pride which is the birthright of the American girl.\r\nBut in declining domestic service for that of the shops, the American\r\ngirl declines an honest, reputable, healthful, and every way elevating\r\nemployment, for, in many cases, a dwarfing, degrading, wretched slavery;\r\nshe turns from her natural and proper sphere to enter a walk of harsh\r\nand degrading experiences, in which it is not possible she can pass her\r\nlife. A word on this latter point: Almost every young woman expects some\r\nday to marry. Now, I ask, what sort of a fitting can a girl receive in a\r\nshop for the serious business of homekeeping? The significance of this\r\nword 'homekeeping' is not apparent at a glance. It means far more than\r\nmere 'housekeeping' although the latter is one of its most essential\r\nelements. A girl of sixteen is forced to earn her own living. She\r\nchooses to go into a shop. Grant that she escapes contamination from the\r\ninfluences heretofore alluded to; that her health bears up under\r\nconfinement, bad air, scanty food, and insufficient clothing--all of\r\nwhich are experiences too familiar with women who labor at mechanical\r\nemployments;--when she reaches a marriageable age, and takes the\r\nimportant step which is to 'settle her for life,' what is her condition?\r\nThe chances are that she has become the wife of some hardworking\r\nmechanic, or man of scanty means, who cannot afford to keep a fine lady\r\nin his domestic establishment. But she knows no more of the mysteries of\r\nhousekeeping than she does of the Latin kalends. She must keep a\r\nservant, who will waste the common substance, and keep her husband's\r\nnose perpetually at the grindstone, to the great wear of mutual comfort\r\nand temper. And once more: There is far more of forecast in young men\r\nseeking wives than they commonly get credit for. The neat, smart girl,\r\nwho works in the shop, _may_ get a good husband--the young woman who is\r\na notable, tidy, thrifty housewife, is _sure_ to be sought after.\r\n\r\nI would add a remark upon another point. American girls are frequently\r\nheard to say they would not object to going out to service could they be\r\n'treated as one of the family.' No American girl who respects herself\r\nneed fear that in an American family she will fail to command respect.\r\nIt should be remembered that the rigid line which is drawn in most\r\nfamilies between mistress and servant, is not simply because such\r\nrelations exist, but because there is generally absolutely nothing in\r\ncommon between them save sex alone; no community of nationality,\r\nreligious belief, intelligence--nothing which can excite mutual\r\nsympathy, or move to homogeneity. The American girl who lives out at\r\nservice need not fear that she will occupy a position in all respects\r\ncorresponding to that occupied by the great mass of servants.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that we shall be able hereafter to procure many\r\nvaluable servants from the South. When freedom shall have taken the\r\nplace of slavery, and labor becomes honorable in that section, many\r\nSouthern women will do--as many Northern women always have done--their\r\nown work. In this way many servants will be set free. Then, when it\r\nbecomes necessary to pay wages to servants, there will be a swarming out\r\nfrom the kitchens of the South of Dinah and Phillis _et als._, and many\r\nof these superfluous servants will find their way North. Already out of\r\nthe bloody wreck of society at the South, through the flaming borders of\r\nbayonets and cannon, have drifted into happy Northern homes thousands of\r\nvaluable servants, and they will be followed by thousands more, 'when\r\nthis cruel war is over.' We cannot judge of the qualities of colored\r\nservants from the wretched specimens we have heretofore had among us.\r\nThe trained house-servants of the South are the best in the world. They\r\nare docile, cleanly, quick-witted, and respectful to humbleness.\r\n\r\nThere have been many projects devised looking to the education of girls\r\nfor housekeeping. There was a very excellent institution in existence\r\nten years ago in one of the Eastern States, which combined with the\r\ncustomary course of intellectual instruction a systematic training in\r\nthe mysteries of housekeeping. The writer has heard nothing of this\r\nschool for some years, and presumes it has failed for want of support.\r\nWe train our daughters only to shine in the drawing room, and the real\r\ngraces of life are neglected. Music, French, and Italian are very\r\nexcellent things, but they should stand second, not first, in the\r\nacquirements which we should desire for those who are to be future\r\nwives, mothers, and mistresses of families.[1] But this is a little\r\napart from the present subject. The idea of a school for training girls\r\nfor housekeeping, however, suggests a thought on the expediency of an\r\ninstitution for the education of servants. Such a project has frequently\r\nbeen urged as a most desirable one to be put into operation, though I am\r\nnot aware that it has ever been tried.[2] Of course it cannot be\r\nexpected that girls wishing to become servants could enter such an\r\ninstitution if it cost anything for instruction. But there can be no\r\nquestion that, purely as a matter of speculation, such a school would be\r\na success. If, in one of our large cities, an institution should be\r\nopened by some one having the requisite knowledge, embodying the\r\nprinciple of our present intelligence offices, taking young girls and\r\ntraining them gratuitously, some for cooks, waiters, nursery maids,\r\nlaundresses, and a larger number for what is termed 'general housework,'\r\nit being understood that in selecting the material the proprietor had an\r\neye to honesty and intelligence, it would be an immense success. The\r\nservants graduating from such an institution would be eagerly sought\r\nfor, and would command the highest wages. The fee for furnishing a\r\nservant could be placed at a much higher rate than is now paid at\r\nintelligence offices, and would be paid readily, for the employer would\r\nbe reasonably confident of securing a good domestic. Such institutions\r\nwould go very far toward remedying the evils under which we now groan,\r\nand I trust it will not be many years before schools for servants will\r\nbe among the recognized institutions of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The pity of it is that the majority of our young ladies, on leaving\r\nschool, know as little of music, French, and Italian as they can\r\npossibly do of housekeeping.--ED.

It was toward the end of a bright and cloudless day,\r\nand Rome was gradually arousing itself from its wonted siesta. The heat\r\nhad at no time been oppressive, for during the whole morning a cool\r\nbreeze had been gambolling across the Campagna from the sea; so that\r\neven during the small hours of the day, the streets had not been kept\r\nfree from moving masses of life. Now that the atmosphere became still\r\nfurther tempered, fresh throngs poured forth from all the smaller\r\npassages and alleys, until the greater arteries of the city swarmed with\r\neager, animated crowds.\r\n\r\nMore now than at any other time during the few weeks that had just\r\nelapsed; for upon the morrow was to commence the dedication of the great\r\namphitheatre of Titus, and thousands of strangers had already poured\r\ninto Rome to witness the games, combats, and pageantry. From the\r\nsurrounding towns and villages--from the cities of the south--from the\r\nconfines of the Alps--even from the farthermost provinces, countless\r\nthrongs had assembled to greet an occasion second only to the grand\r\ntriumphal entry with the spoils of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nFrom her window overlooking the streets, AEnone surveyed the panorama of\r\nlife spread out before her. Upon the battlements and towers of the\r\nCaesars' house, in full sight over against the Palatine Hill, floated the\r\nimperial banners, gently waving their folds in anticipation of the\r\nsplendors of the ensuing days; and round about stood crowds of\r\nstrangers, wondering at the magnificence of the palace architecture, and\r\nthe vast compass of its walls, and straining their eager gaze in the\r\nhope of being able to catch a chance glimpse of the emperor himself.\r\nFarther down was the now completed Colosseum, around which other\r\nthousands stood watching the pigmies who, in dark clusters upon the top\r\nand along the edge, laboriously erected the poles upon which, in case of\r\nneed, to stretch the protecting velarium. This was the last outward\r\npreparation of all; and when that was done, everything would be ready.\r\nAs one of these poles was being elevated, he who had hold of the lower\r\nend of it lost his balance, and fell to the ground. He was lifted up\r\noutside, dead--a shapeless, gory mass. The crowd shuddered to see that\r\nhelpless body falling from such a height; but, at the next moment, all\r\nsympathy passed away. The man wore a slave's dress, and was recognized\r\nas belonging to the praetorian lieutenant Patrocles. Upon the morrow, if\r\nhe had lived, he was to have appeared in the arena as a retiarius--he\r\nwould then most likely have been conquered and slain--it was merely a\r\nday sooner--a victim outside the walls instead of within--he had\r\nclambered up to overlook the ground upon which he was to have fought,\r\nand need not thus recklessly have volunteered to aid the regular\r\nlaborers--it was his fate--_Deus vult_--what more could be said?\r\n\r\nAEnone had not witnessed the fall, for she had not been looking at palace\r\nor amphitheatre, both, of which were too familiar with her to attract\r\nher attention. The one had been for years the centrepiece of her\r\nview--and the other had grown up arch by arch and tier by tier so\r\nsteadily before her eyes that it seemed as though she could almost count\r\nits stones. Her gaze was now fixed upon the open space beneath her\r\nwindow, where the Sacred and Triumphal Walls joined--a space always at\r\nthat hour gay with a phantasmagoria of shifting life, and at this time\r\nmore than ever provocative of curiosity and attention. Its bordering\r\npalaces, already being hung with lively tapestries for the morrow--its\r\nsparkling fountains--its corners decked with arches--its pavement\r\nthronged with carriages and horsemen--the crowds of slaves, beginning in\r\nadvance to take their holiday, and affording pleasing contrasts as they\r\nwound their way in slender currents through the openings in the throng\r\nof their betters--the soldiery passing here and there in large or small\r\ndetachments--where else in the world could such a varied scene of life\r\nand animation be presented?\r\n\r\nFirst before her eyes passed a number of the praetorian guard, with\r\nmartial music, cutting the crowd asunder like a wedge in their steady\r\nmarch toward the imperial palace. Then came the chariot of the African\r\nproconsul, with liveried footmen in front, and Nubian slaves, in short\r\ntunics and silver anklets, running beside the wheels. After that a\r\ncovered van, toilsomely dragged along by tired horses and guarded by\r\narmed slaves in livery. The imperial cipher was emblazoned upon the\r\ndusty canvas screen thrown over the top, and from within, at intervals,\r\ncame half-smothered growls and roars. It was some wild beast arriving at\r\nthis late hour from Nubia--a contribution from some provincial\r\ngovernor--a booty which had cost pounds of gold, and perhaps the lives\r\nof many slaves, and which was now destined to perform, in the sanded\r\narena, the combats of the jungle. The crowd, which had let the African\r\nproconsul pass by with but a careless glance of uninterested\r\nscrutiny--for dignitaries were too common to excite much\r\ncuriosity--pressed tumultuously and with frantic eagerness around the\r\nheavy cage, exulting in each half-stifled roar from within as though it\r\nwere a strain of sweet music--and thus followed the van until it arrived\r\nat the amphitheatre and passed out of sight through one of the deep, low\r\narches leading to the tiers of grated stone cages, already well filled\r\nwith the choicest forest spoils of every tributary country.\r\n\r\nThen came a black-bearded horseman. The trappings of his steed were\r\nmarked with the insignia of distinction; and footmen, with staves, ran\r\nbefore him to clear the way. He sat with proud and haughty mien--as one\r\nwho felt his power and immunity, and yet with the expression of one\r\naware that all his rank and state could not protect him from secret\r\nscorn and hate. Not many looked at him; for, in that thronging display\r\nof wealth and power, a single gayly caparisoned horse and two liveried\r\nfootmen counted for almost nothing. One or two, however, of those few\r\nwho study men for their deeds alone, turned and gazed scrutinizingly\r\nafter him, for he had already taken rank as one of the historians of the\r\nage. And as he passed farther along, a group of slaves, whose marked\r\nfeatures denoted Jewish descent, suffered expressions of aversion to\r\nbreak from them; some turning their backs--some gazing up with faces\r\ninflamed with the fiercest intensity of hate--while one, less cautious,\r\nclenched his fist and hurled after the rider a handful of dust and\r\nvolleys of heavy Hebrew curses. And so the apostate Josephus passed on,\r\nand was gradually lost to view.\r\n\r\nAfter him, slowly wending his way on foot through the crowds,\r\noccasionally moving aside to allow others, more urgent, the privilege of\r\npassing him, and constantly careful not to excite the impatient wrath of\r\nthose nearest to him by a too lively pressure, yet all the time making\r\nsure progress along his chosen path, came a single figure--a\r\nwhite-bearded man, in plain, coarse tunic and well-worn sandals. Few\r\nregarded him or even seemed to know that he was there, except when in\r\ntheir hurry they found it expedient to jostle him one side. But in his\r\nface gleamed an intelligence far beyond what could be expected from one\r\nin his humble attire; and as AEnone watched him, a suspicion crossed her\r\nthat the poor, beggarly dress and the quiet, yielding mien were assumed\r\nto baffle observation. Soon another person in similar dress but of fewer\r\nyears met him. The two joined hands and looked earnestly into each\r\nother's eyes, and the older one appeared to mutter a word or two. What\r\nwas that word, at which the younger bent his head with reverent gesture?\r\nWas it a command or a blessing? Whatever it was, in a second it was all\r\nsaid. The hands then unclasped--the bended head raised with a startled\r\nglance around, as though with a fear that even such a mere instant of\r\nhumble bearing might have betrayed something which should be kept\r\nsecret; and then the two men parted, and were swallowed up in different\r\nsides of the concourse.\r\n\r\n'I know that person,' said Cleotos, He had been gazing, for the past\r\nminute, out at the same window with AEnone; and while attracted by the\r\nhumble figure of that old man, he had noticed that she had been equally\r\nobservant.\r\n\r\n'You know him, Cleotos?'\r\n\r\n'They call him Clemens, noble lady. He is a leader of the Christian\r\nsect, and a person of influence among them. It was at Corinth that I\r\nfirst saw him, and it was he who let me copy the good words which are\r\nwritten upon my little leaf of parchment. That was two years ago, but I\r\nstill recognize him. What does he here? Why should he thus peril his\r\nlife In public?'\r\n\r\n'Give me that little scroll, Cleotos,' said AEnone. 'Let me have it for\r\nmy own.'\r\n\r\nCleotos gazed at her for a moment in dismay. Was she about to use her\r\nauthority, and take away from him by force those few lines, which,\r\nthough he understood them so little, had often served to cheer his heart\r\nwith their promises of future rest and joy? If so, he must submit; but\r\nof what avail, then, was all her previous kindness?\r\n\r\n'I ask it not as mistress, but as friend,' she said, reading his\r\nthoughts. 'I ask it because, when you are away, I shall need some memory\r\nof what have been happy days, and because I may then often wish to apply\r\nthose same words of comfort to my own soul. You can make another copy of\r\nthe same, and, in your own land, I doubt not, can find, with proper\r\nsearch, many more words of equal value.'\r\n\r\n'In my own land?' Cleotos repeated, ed, as in a dream. But, though her\r\nmeaning did not as yet flash upon him, he knew that she spoke in\r\nkindness, and that she would not ask anything which he would not care to\r\ngrant; and he drew the little stained parchment from beneath his tunic,\r\nand handed it to her.\r\n\r\n'Close, now, the window, Cleotos, and shut out from sight that giddy\r\nwhirl, for I have something to say to you.'\r\n\r\nHe closed the window with its silken blind; and then, in obedience to\r\nher motion, glided away from before it She seated herself upon her\r\nlounge, and he upon his accustomed stool in front of her.\r\n\r\n'Think not, Cleotos,' she said, after a moment's silence, 'that I first\r\nbrought you hither to become a mere slave. It was rather done in order\r\nthat, when the proper time came, I might set you free. Had\r\nshe--Leta--but shown herself worthy of you, the day might have come when\r\nI could have managed to free her also, and send you both home again\r\ntogether. But that cannot be. You must go alone, Cleotos, but not, I\r\nhope, despairingly. Once again in your own loved Samos, I know that,\r\nsooner or later, there will be found some other one to make you forget\r\nwhat you have suffered here.'\r\n\r\nHe could no longer doubt her meaning--she was about to give him to\r\nliberty again. At the thought the blood rushed to his heart, and he\r\ngasped for breath. For the moment, as he gazed into her face and saw\r\nwith what sisterly sympathy and compassion she looked upon him, the\r\nimpulse came into his mind to refuse the proffered freedom, and ask only\r\nto remain and serve her for life. But then came such floods of memories\r\nof his native place, which he had never expected to see again--and its\r\nhills and streams and well-remembered haunts seemed to approach with one\r\nbound so near to him--and the faces of the loved ones at home began once\r\nagain to look so tenderly into his own--and the thought of throwing off\r\neven the light, silken chains which he had been wearing, and of standing\r\nup in the sight of heaven a free man again, was so grateful to his\r\nsoul--what could he do but remain silent and overpowered with\r\nconflicting emotions, and wait to hear more?\r\n\r\n'Think not to refuse your liberty,' she said, as she read his doubts and\r\nperplexities, 'It must not be. No man has the right to suffer\r\ndegradation when he can avoid it. And though I might continue kind to\r\nyou, who can answer for it that I should live to be kind to the end? No,\r\nno; from this instant be a free man again. And, for the few moments that\r\nremain to us, strive to think of me only as your equal and your friend.'\r\n\r\nStill silent. What, indeed, could he say? She knew that he was grateful\r\nto her, and that was enough. But why should he, of all slaves in Rome,\r\nfind such kindly treatment? What had he ever done to deserve it? And--as\r\noften before--that puzzled look of wondering inquiry came over his face\r\nwhile he gazed into her own. She noticed it, but now made no attempt to\r\ndisguise herself by any forced and unnatural assumption of haughty\r\npride. Were he at last to learn the truth, there could surely no harm\r\ncome of it.\r\n\r\n'You must depart to-night,' she said, 'and before it becomes known that\r\nI am sending you away; lest, knowing it, others might claim authority to\r\ndelay or prevent you. Take this little purse. It contains a few gold\r\npieces, which you may need. And here is a written pass which will lead\r\nyou to Ostia. There you will go to the tavern of the Three Cranes, and\r\ninquire for one Pollio, who has a vessel ready to sail for Samos. In\r\nthat vessel your passage is paid. Show him this ring. It will be a token\r\nfor him to know you by. And keep the ring ever afterward, as a sign that\r\nyou have a friend left here, who will often think of you with pleasure\r\nand interest.'\r\n\r\n'My mistress,' he said, taking the ring and placing it upon his finger,\r\n'what have I done that you should be thus kind to me?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; no longer mistress, but friend,' she said, with a melancholy\r\nsmile. 'As such alone let us converse during the hour that remains, for\r\nyou must soon leave me. It may be that when you arrive at Ostia, the\r\nvessel will not be ready to set sail, nor yet for a day or two, for its\r\nowner spoke to my messenger concerning possible delays. If so, there\r\nwill be time for you to look around you, and think of the days when you\r\nwandered along the shore, hand in hand with your chosen one. You will,\r\nperhaps, go over those wanderings again--along the sands leading past\r\nDruse's olive grove to the altar of Vesta, or to the--'\r\n\r\n'How know you about Druse's grove?' he cried with a start; and again\r\nthat look of keen inquiry came into his face. It was but a single step\r\nnow--he stood upon the very border of the truth. Should she repress him?\r\nIt were hardly worth the while. So she let him gaze, and, if anything,\r\nsoftened her features yet more into the old familiar expression.\r\n\r\n'Past Druse's Grove, Cleotos--or to the smooth rock which the waves\r\nwashed at Cato's Point. Do you remember, Cleotos, how often we there\r\nsat, you holding me with your arm while I slid down the sloping side,\r\nthe better to dip my naked feet into the water?'\r\n\r\nWith a wild sob he seized her hand, and threw himself at her feet. Near\r\nto the truth as he had been standing, it seemed at the last to burst\r\nupon him with as much force as though even a suspicion of it had been a\r\nthing before impossible. And yet, at the same time, it appeared to him\r\nas though he must have known it all the while; for how could he\r\ncomprehend his blindness?\r\n\r\n'AEnone,' he cried, 'send me not away! Let me stay here to serve you\r\nforever!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, speak not thus!' she said, touching his lips lightly with her\r\nfinger. 'Had you not been about to go from here, you should never have\r\nrecognized me. Forget, now, all that has ever passed between us; or\r\nrather, strive to remember it only as a pleasant dream which left us in\r\nits proper time. If the Fates separated us, it was only because they\r\nwere wiser than ourselves. Those bright anticipations of our youthful\r\nlove could never have been fully realized; and, if persisted in, might\r\nhave led only to sorrow and despair. Let me not blush now at having\r\nrevealed myself to you. Think, for the few minutes that remain to us, of\r\nfriendship and of duty alone.'\r\n\r\nRaising him up, she placed him beside her, and there they talked about\r\nthe past and its pleasant recollections. How the cross miller, who had\r\nnever been known to do a kindness to any one else, had sometimes let\r\nthem ride upon his horse--how they had once rowed together about the\r\nbay, and he had taken her aboard his ship--how she had stolen away from\r\nhome each pleasant evening to meet him, and with what feeble\r\nexcuses--and the like. As the shades of afternoon deepened and shut out\r\nfrom sight the gilded cornices and costly frescoes, and all else that\r\ncould remind them of present wealth, and as, each instant, their\r\nthoughts buried themselves still further in the memories of the past, it\r\nseemed to them, at last, as though they were again wandering hand in\r\nhand upon the beach, or sitting upon the wave-washed rock at Cato's\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\nWith something wanting, however. No force of illusion could bring back\r\nto either of them, in all its former completeness, that sense of mutual\r\ninterest which had once absorbed them. Whatever dreams of the past\r\nmight, for the moment, blind their perceptions, there was still the\r\never-present consciousness of now standing in another and far different\r\nrelation to each other. Though AEnone musingly gazed upon his face and\r\nlistened to his voice, until the realities of the present seemed to\r\nshrink away, and the fancies of other years stole softly back, and, with\r\ninvoluntary action, her hand gently toyed with his curls and parted them\r\none side, as she had once been accustomed to do, it was with no love for\r\nhim that she did it now. He was only her friend--her brother. He had\r\nbeen kind to her, and perhaps, if necessary, she might even now consent\r\nto die for him; but, with all that, he was no longer the idol of her\r\nheart. Another had taken that place, and, however unworthy to hold it,\r\ncould not now be dispossessed. And though Cleotos, likewise, as he\r\nlooked at her and felt the gentle pressure of her hand upon his\r\nforehead, seemed as though transported into the past, until he saw no\r\nlonger the matron in the full bloom of womanhood, but only the young\r\ngirl sparkling with the fresh hue and sunshine of early youth, yet to\r\nhim still clung the perception that there was a barrier between them.\r\nWhat though the form of the treacherous Leta may then have faded from\r\nhis memory as completely as though he had never seen her? What though.\r\nAEnone's pleasant and sympathetic tones may have again melted into his\r\nheart as warmly as when first whispered at Ostia? The smile upon her\r\nface--the winning intonation of her voice--all might seem the same; but\r\nhe knew that he must bide within his own heart all that he had thus felt\r\nanew, and be content with the offered friendship alone, for that not\r\nmerely her duty but her altered inclination had separated her from him\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAt last the brief hour came to an end, and AEnone arose. The sun had set,\r\nand the darkness of night had already begun to shroud the city. Here and\r\nthere, from some of the more wealthy neighborhoods, faint glimmers of\r\nlamp light shone out and marked the scenes of solitary study or of\r\nfestive gathering, but as yet these indications were few. Already the\r\nchariots and horsemen who had thronged the Appian Way had dispersed--a\r\nsingle rider here and there occupying the place where so lately gay\r\nbands had cantered, disputing each available empty space of pavement.\r\nThe walks were yet crowded with loiterers, but of a different class.\r\nPatricians and fair ladies had departed, and left the course to the\r\nlower orders of citizens and to slaves, who now emerged from the arches\r\nand alleys, and, anticipative of the morrow's holiday, swarmed in dusky\r\ncrowds hither and thither in search of rude pastime.\r\n\r\n'You must go now,' said AEnone, dropping the curtain which she had lifted\r\nfor a moment in order to peer into the street. 'Stay not for anything\r\nthat belongs to you, for I would not that you should be hindered or\r\ndelayed. You have been here as mine own property; and yet, how do I know\r\nthat some pretence of others' right might not be urged for your\r\ndetention, if it were known that you were departing? Go, therefore, at\r\nonce, Cleotos, and may the gods be with you!'\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand to him. He took it in his own, and, for the\r\nmoment, gazed inquiringly into her face. Was this to be their only\r\nparting? Nay, need there be a parting at all? A flush came into his\r\ncountenance as he felt one wild thought and desire burning into his\r\nsoul. What if he were to yield to the impulse which beset him, and\r\nshould throw himself at her feet, and ask her to forget the years which\r\nhad separated them, and the trials which had beset them, and to give up\r\nall else, and depart with him? Alas! only one result could follow such\r\nan appeal as that! In the vain attempt to gain her love, he would lose\r\nher friendship also. She would part from him as an enemy who had taken\r\nadvantage of her sisterly affection to inflict an insult upon her. He\r\nknew that this would surely be the consequence; but yet, for the moment,\r\nhe could scarce resist the maddening impulse to thus forfeit all while\r\nstriving to attain impossibilities.\r\n\r\n'Shall we never meet again?' he said, at length, after the hard struggle\r\nto command himself.\r\n\r\n'It may be, in after years; who can tell?' she answered. 'And yet, let\r\nus rather look the truth in the face, and not delude ourselves with\r\nfalse hopes. The world is very wide, and the way from here to your home\r\nis far, and the fatalities of life are many. Dear Cleotos, let us rather\r\nmake up our minds that this parting is for ever; unless it may be that\r\nthe gods will let us look upon each other's faces again in some future\r\nstate. But there may be times when you can write to me, or send some\r\nmessage of good tidings; and then--'\r\n\r\n'Talk not to me of the gods!' he interrupted, in a storm of passionate\r\nexclamation. 'What have they ever done for us, that we should worship or\r\npray to them? Why look to them for blessings in a future state, when\r\nthey have done us such evil in the present life? Here we were poor and\r\nlowly together; and have they not dragged us apart? And will they, then,\r\nin another life, be the more disposed to let us see each other's\r\nfaces--you one of the nobles of the earth, and I one of its meanest\r\nplebeians? Is it written in the temples or by the priests and oracles,\r\nthat when the Caesars are throned in Olympus, their lowly subjects shall\r\nbe permitted to approach, them any nearer than when here? How, then,\r\ncould we meet each other better hereafter than now? Away with all talk\r\nabout the gods! I believe not in them! If we part now for this world, it\r\nis for eternity as well!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, say not that!' she exclaimed. 'And still pray to the gods as of\r\nold, for they may yet bring good out of all that now seems to us so\r\nobscure. Remember that to the best of us, this world offers little but\r\nwhat is mingled with unhappiness. Take not, therefore, away from\r\nyourself and me a belief in something better to come.'\r\n\r\n'Take, then, with you, a belief in the God about whom I learned in\r\nGreece, for He it is who tells of comfort hereafter for the poor and\r\noppressed, and He is the only one who does so,' Cleotos doggedly\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n'It may be--it may be,' she said. 'Who can tell which is right? We have\r\nso often talked about it, and have not yet found out. They may both be\r\nthe true gods--they may neither of them be. Ah, Cleotos, my brother, let\r\nus not doubt. It is pleasanter and safer, too, that we should believe,\r\neven if we extend our faith to a belief in both. Choose, then, your own,\r\nas I will mine. I must not abandon the gods in whose worship I have been\r\nbrought up; but when I pray to them, I will first pray for you. And\r\nyou--if you adopt the God of the Christians, who speaks so much better\r\ncomfort to your soul--will always pray to Him for me. And thereby, if\r\neither of us is wrong, the sin may perhaps be pardoned, on account of\r\nthe other, who was right. And now, once more--and it may be for\r\never--dear Cleotos, farewell!'\r\n\r\n'Farewell, AEnone, my sister!' he said. And he raised her hand and\r\npressed it to his lips, and was about turning sorrowfully away, when the\r\ndoor flew open, and Sergius Vanno burst into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.--No. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  See 'neath the swelling storm,\r\n  The willow's slender form\r\n  With grace doth ever yield;\r\n  While oaks, the monarchs of the field,\r\n  In pride resist the blast,\r\n  And prostrate lie, ere it is past:\r\n  But now the storm is o'er,\r\n  The willow bows no more;\r\n  While oaks from overthrow\r\n  No rising ever know.\r\n\r\n  So with the meek, in strife\r\n  Against the storms of life;\r\n  Though often roughly cast,\r\n  They stand erect at last:\r\n  But those who will not bend\r\n  To what their God doth send,\r\n  Are whelmed in lasting woe,\r\n  And rising up will never know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT PRUSSIAN POLITICS.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n     [The author of the ensuing article, the topic of which is just now\r\n     one of special interest, is MR. CHARLES M. MEAD, a gentleman who\r\n     has spent the last year in Germany. Having resided in the family of\r\n     Professor Jacobi, who fills the chair of history in the University\r\n     of Halle, he has had excellent opportunities for making himself\r\n     acquainted with his subject. Having a natural taste for political\r\n     studies, he has investigated it in its many bearings with calm\r\n     impartiality, and written upon it _con amore_. The conclusion will\r\n     be given in our next issue.--EDITOR CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe struggle now going on in Prussia, whatever may be the issue, must be\r\nregarded as one of immense political importance. To Americans certainly,\r\nno less than to any other people, is the character and progress of this\r\nstruggle a matter of profound interest. Though it cannot be said that\r\nthe contest is that of revolutionists or even of republicans against a\r\nlegitimately ruling monarch, yet the real principles involved in the\r\ncontest are in substance those of absolutism and of democracy.\r\n\r\nDeep and irreconcilable as is now the opposition between the two\r\ncontending elements, all Prussians are proud of Prussia's history. In\r\norder to a correct understanding of the present circumstances of the\r\ncountry, a brief survey of its previous history is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the national domain, perhaps no other instance can be\r\nfound so striking as that here presented, of a steady growth of an\r\ninsignificant territory, from the first surrounded by powerful nations,\r\nto a size which entitles it to rank among the first Powers of the earth.\r\nPassing over the first few hundred years of her history, during which\r\nperiod much confusion prevailed as to boundaries as well as everything\r\nelse, we find that as late as 1417 the country embraced a territory of\r\nonly about seven thousand eight hundred square miles, or of about the\r\nsize of Massachusetts; whereas its present extent is about one hundred\r\nand twelve thousand square miles, _i. e._, about as large as New\r\nEngland, New York, and New Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn respect to population, the increase is proportionally great. In 1417\r\nit was only one hundred and eighty-eight thousand five hundred; now it\r\nis over eighteen millions. As to general culture, the progress of the\r\nnation and its present relative position in the scale of civilization\r\nleave little for national pride to wish.\r\n\r\nThe history of the nation commences with the conquest of Brandenburg by\r\nthe Saxon emperor Henry I., in 927. He founded the so-called _North\r\nMark_, and set over it a margrave. The government was administered by\r\nmargraves until 1411, when, after a century of anarchy, during which the\r\nMark was struggled for by many aspiring dukes, it was delivered over by\r\nthe emperor Sigismund, an almost worthless possession, to Frederick of\r\nHohenzollern, burggrave of Nuremberg, with the title of elector.\r\n\r\nThe house of Hohenzollern is still the reigning dynasty. In 1701,\r\nFrederick III., who became elector in 1688, secured from the emperor\r\nLeopold I. the title of King Frederick I. Not king of Brandenburg, since\r\nBrandenburg belonged to the Austrian empire, but king in Prussia, the\r\nname of a Polish duchy acquired by John Sigismund as a feudal possession\r\nin 1621, but in 1656 made an independent possession by Frederick\r\nWilliam. Not king _of_ Prussia, but _in_ Prussia, because not all the\r\nterritory to which that name belonged was included in the\r\nafore-mentioned duchy. The rest was not annexed till 1772, so that\r\nFrederick the Great was the first king _of_ Prussia. And not till 1815\r\nwas the name Prussia strictly a designation of the whole land now so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nWe cannot stop even to glance at the political condition of the nation\r\nduring the period of the electorate, interesting as it might be, and\r\nimportant as revealing the sources of subsequent political developments.\r\nYet in passing, this at least must be borne in mind, that there was all\r\nthe while a struggle going on between the nobility and the monarchy, the\r\nlatter gradually gaining in strength.\r\n\r\nFrederick I., whose vanity led him to make it his main object to secure\r\nthe _name_ of king, did less than his immediate predecessor, the 'great\r\nelector,' toward deepening the foundations of the monarchy. The most\r\nnoticeable feature of his reign was the increase of the standing army\r\nfrom twenty-five thousand to fifty thousand. He secured the _title_ of\r\nroyalty. It remained for his son and successor to secure its power and\r\nauthority.[3]\r\n\r\nFrederick William I. was the first absolute monarch of Prussia. He was a\r\nman of rough manners and coarse tastes. Caring little for the pomp of\r\nroyalty, he jealously sought to maintain his hold on the essence of it.\r\nNo sooner had he dried the tears shed over his deceased father, than he\r\ndismissed the larger part of the court attendants, cut off unnecessary\r\nexpenses, inaugurated a simple style of living in the court, and began\r\nto direct his attention to the improvement of the military and financial\r\ncondition of the country. More than any predecessor, he identified the\r\noffice of king with that of commander-in-chief of the army. His\r\ndomineering disposition carried him so far that he personally scolded\r\nand threatened with blows whoever seemed to him lazy and shiftless,\r\nhowever little the matter personally concerned him. So violent was his\r\ntemper that, because his son, afterward Frederick the Great, displayed\r\nmore taste for literature, and less for religion and warfare, than he\r\nhad wished, he became disgusted with him, threateningly raised his cane\r\nwhenever he saw him; and, when the prince, exasperated by constant\r\nabuse, formed a plan of escape to Sinsheim, the king, having discovered\r\nit before its execution, was so infuriated that, except for the\r\nintervention of bystanders, he would have run him through with his\r\nsword. As it was, at one time he beat him furiously with his cane.\r\nFrederick's confidant was executed before his eyes, and he himself\r\ncondemned to a long banishment from the court; and not till he had shown\r\nsigns of repentance, was he readmitted to it and to his father's favor.\r\nFrederick William is famous for the 'tobacco club' which he established,\r\nat whose sessions over the pipe and the beer he and his friends indulged\r\nin the most unrestrained mirth and freedom; also for his monomania\r\nconcerning 'tall fellows'--a passion for securing as many regiments as\r\npossible of extraordinarily tall soldiers, for which he spared no pains,\r\nand often paid little regard to the personal wishes of the tall fellows\r\nthemselves. To increase their number, he scoured all Europe, other\r\nmonarchs being not unwilling to secure his good will by providing him\r\nwith the coveted men, for whom his almost insane passion made him\r\nwilling to give any price. But the real significance of his reign in\r\nrelation to Prussia's subsequent history, is the impulse which he gave\r\nto her military tastes, and his success in establishing firmly the\r\nabsolute authority of the monarch. The power of feudal lords had already\r\nbeen shattered; it required only a strong army and a strong will to\r\ndestroy it altogether. These the king possessed. He reigned at a time\r\nwhen the obstacles to the exercise of unlimited power by the king were\r\nnot what they now are, viz.: a desire on the part of the people in\r\ngeneral for a constitutional government. The most certain way to secure\r\nthe esteem of the people was to centralize the power in himself, and\r\nthen exercise that power in the promotion of the people's material\r\nwelfare. This the king did. He laid the foundations of the still\r\nexisting system of general school education. He invited colonists from\r\nabroad to settle in the more uncultivated parts of his domains. He\r\nreformed the judiciary. He diminished the taxes, and yet by his economy\r\nincreased the real revenue of the state from two and a half to seven and\r\na half millions. Himself disinclined to become entangled in foreign\r\nwars, he raised the troops and the money without which his son could not\r\nhave won the military glory which has given him the title of _the\r\nGreat_.\r\n\r\nFrederick William I. established the absolute monarchy by internal\r\npolitical changes and institutions. Frederick the Great secured for it a\r\nsolid foundation in the hearts of the people. The one was thoroughly\r\nautocratic in disposition, and not seldom displayed this disposition too\r\noffensively; the other knew how to use his hereditary power without\r\nseeming to care about it. In fact, under the influence of Voltaire and\r\nthe French liberalism, he himself learned to cherish very liberal\r\nopinions respecting popular rights. But practically he was absolute, and\r\npreferred to be so. By his brilliant military successes in the two\r\nSilesian wars and in the Seven Years' War he roused the national\r\nenthusiasm for the royal house to the highest pitch. He secured for\r\nPrussia the rank of a great Power in Europe. He enlarged her boundaries,\r\nand, notwithstanding his expensive wars, promoted the general prosperity\r\nof the land. Genial and kind-hearted, he won the affections of the\r\npeople, so that loyalty was easy and pleasant--none the less so, the\r\nmore completely the object of the loyalty was the king's person.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Frederick William II. was not characterized by any special\r\ndevelopment in the political condition of the country. Lacking in energy\r\nand decision, given to self-indulgence, controlled by courtiers and\r\nfavorite women, although by the partition of Poland he increased the\r\nnational domains, and by educational measures helped to promote German\r\nliterature instead of the French preferred by his father, he was yet too\r\ninferior to the great Frederick to be able to uphold the glory of the\r\nroyal house. By his disgraceful withdrawal from the First Coalition and\r\nthe Treaty of Basle, by which he yielded to France all of Prussia lying\r\nbeyond the Rhine, he prepared the way for her subsequent humiliation by\r\nBonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe long reign of Frederick William III. is the richest period of\r\nPrussia's history. Here begins that development whose progress is now\r\none of the most noteworthy of our time. The king, cautious,\r\nconscientious, patriotic, but timid, declined to join the Second\r\nCoalition (1799), hoping thereby to secure Prussia against the ravages\r\nof war. Prominent Prussians, moreover, were positively friendly to\r\nNapoleon; so that, even after the latter had violated his obligations by\r\nmarching through Prussian territory, the king hesitated a year to\r\ndeclare war. This was done August 9, 1806; but two months later his army\r\nwas routed at Jena; Napoleon entered Berlin; the Prussians were finally\r\ndefeated at Friedland by the French, and at Tilsit, July 9, 1807, the\r\nPrussian king was forced to give up the half of his domains, and to\r\nfurnish the conqueror a tribute of one hundred and forty millions of\r\nfrancs. For six years Prussia lay prostrate at the feet of France. In\r\n1812 he was compelled to furnish twenty thousand men to join Napoleon's\r\narmy in his invasion of Russia. Not till after the disastrous issue of\r\nthis invasion did king or people dare to lift an arm in defence of the\r\nnational independence. But these years compose just the period which\r\nPrussians love to call that of Prussia's regeneration. The insolence of\r\nthe conqueror united the national heart. Full of the most flaming\r\npatriotism, and not doubting that deliverance would finally come,\r\nstatesmen and warriors, Stein, Scharnhorst, Bluecher, Schill, and others,\r\nlabored unweariedly to keep up the spirits of the people, and prepare\r\nthem for the coming War of Liberation. Now for the first time the cities\r\nwere invested with the right to regulate their own internal affairs. Now\r\nfor the first time the peasants were delivered from the serfdom under\r\nwhich they had hitherto suffered. In short, the whole policy of the\r\nGovernment was determined by the resolution to inspire the people with a\r\nhealthful, unconstrained, enthusiastic devotion to the national weal,\r\nand, as a means to this end, with zeal for the king. These efforts were\r\nfully successful. When the providential time arrived, and the king\r\nissued, February 3, 1813, a call for volunteers, and, March 17, his\r\nfamous _Aufruf an mein Volk_, all Prussia sprang to arms. In alliance\r\nwith Russia, finally also assisted by Austria and Sweden, her troops\r\nwere engaged in nine bloody battles with the French between April 5 and\r\nOctober 18, the enthusiasm of the people and the dogged intrepidity of\r\nBluecher being at length rewarded by the decisive victory at Leipsic. The\r\nimmediate result of this victory for Prussia was the recovery of the\r\nterritory between the Elbe and the Rhine ceded to France by the\r\npreceding king. At the congress of Vienna there were assigned to her in\r\naddition all that she had possessed before the Treaty of Tilsit, half of\r\nSaxony, and an increase of the former possessions on the Rhine. Some\r\nfurther acquisitions and cessions were made at the second Treaty of\r\nParis, November 2, 1815, since which time the boundaries of Prussia have\r\nbeen little changed.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the so-called War of Liberation could not have been\r\navoided in an attempt to describe the present political condition of\r\nPrussia. The enthusiasm with which the semi-centennial anniversary of\r\nthe battle of Leipsic was celebrated on the 18th of last October by men\r\nof all parties and sentiments was a lively evidence of the profound\r\ninfluence of that war on the national character. The chief significance\r\nof the war for Prussia was its influence in uniting the people in the\r\npursuit of a common patriotic end. It was a struggle for national\r\nexistence; and all minor considerations were for the time forgotten. It\r\ntended to break down the barriers which before had so effectually\r\nseparated the higher from the lower classes. The Government had need of\r\nthe hearty aid of all Prussians; and, in order to secure this, it was\r\nnecessary to abandon the invidious distinctions which, in spite of all\r\nprevious reformatory measures, made a large portion of the people\r\npractically slaves. The sentiment was encouraged, that whoever was ready\r\nto lay down his life for his country deserved full protection from his\r\ncountry. The promise was made that this should henceforth be the spirit\r\nand practice of the Government.\r\n\r\nWe are here to mark a twofold influence on the political sentiments of\r\nthe Prussian people springing from the war against French invasion. On\r\nthe one hand, from here dates the first positive preparations for, and\r\nexpectations of, a national representative assembly--a change from an\r\nabsolute to a limited monarchy; on the other, the perfect identification\r\nof the interests of the king with those of the people, combined with a\r\nreal love for the royal family, made the people satisfied, after the\r\nrestoration of peace, to continue under the sway of a king in whom,\r\nthough his power was unlimited, they had perfect confidence that he\r\nwould use his power with conscientious regard to their good. To this day\r\nthe recollection of those years of pious loyalty, when every citizen\r\ncherished a feeling of filial love and trust toward Frederick William\r\nIII., is the chief element of strength in the conservative party.\r\nPrussia, they say, is what her kings have made her; the house of\r\nHohenzollern has raised her from an insignificant beginning to the rank\r\nof a great Power; under this rule the people have prospered; no tyranny\r\nhas disgraced it; there is no need of a change; there is no danger that\r\na continuance of the former order of things can ever inure to our hurt;\r\ngratitude to our sovereigns requires us not to attack their hereditary\r\nprerogatives. There is danger of foreigners, especially republicans, not\r\nfully appreciating the force of these considerations. To us, the fact\r\nthat one king, or even a series of kings, have ruled well, is no proof\r\nthat they have a divine right to rule; still less, that, when their\r\npolicy comes into conflict with the decided wishes of the people, they\r\nhave a right by unconstitutional measures to resist the popular will.\r\nBut it must be remembered that Prussia, even in the midst of the present\r\nconflict, is thoroughly monarchical. No party pretends to wish any\r\nchange of the present form of government. Patriotism has so long been\r\nassociated with simple devotion to the royal house, and the royal house\r\nhas so uniformly proved itself not unworthy of this devotion, that it is\r\nno easy matter, especially for those who by nature are conservative, to\r\nbe satisfied with a change which reduces the monarchical office to a\r\nmerely empty hereditary honor. In addition to this, it would be unfair\r\nnot to recognize the fact that the most cultivated and religious part of\r\nthe Prussian people belongs to the Conservative party. This, as a\r\ngeneral statement, is, as all acknowledge, true. That the exceptions,\r\nhowever, are very numerous, is no less true. It is also, doubtless, not\r\nunjust to assume that the dependence of churches and universities on the\r\nstate leads to much hypocritical piety and selfish loyalty. Yet the\r\ngeneral fact that the most estimable citizens are royalists, is not so\r\nto be accounted for. The War of Liberation was a war not only against\r\nFrench aggression, but against a power whose origin was to be traced to\r\na contempt not only of time-honored political customs, but also of\r\nChristianity itself. Revolutions and republicanism became associated\r\nwith infidelity. It was natural, therefore, that Christians should\r\nacquire the notion that every approximation toward democracy would\r\ninvolve danger to the church; especially as the church and state were\r\nunited, and the king not only professed personal belief in Christianity,\r\nbut endeavored to promote its interests by his administrative measures.\r\nIt was to them a touching recollection that their king and the Austrian\r\nand Russian emperors kneeled together on the battle field of Leipsic to\r\noffer to the Lord of hosts their thanks for the victory that he had\r\nvouchsafed to them. And when two years later the same monarchs united\r\nthemselves in the Holy Alliance, it is not strange, whatever may now be\r\nthought of their motives, that Christians should have rejoiced at the\r\nsight of princes publicly acknowledging their obligation to rule in the\r\ninterests of Christianity, and binding themselves to promote the\r\nreligious good of their subjects. As republicanism in France had\r\nappeared in a positively unchristian form, here monarchism appeared in a\r\npositively Christian form. Nothing was therefore more natural than that\r\ntheir devotion to the king--already, for other reasons, hearty and\r\nenthusiastic--should be increased as they thought they saw in him the\r\nsurest defender of the church. Instead, therefore, of encouraging or\r\nwishing a separation of church and state--a consummation which it was in\r\nthe power of leading theologians, to procure--they preferred a still\r\ncloser union. Nor is it to be wondered at that, ever since, men of the\r\nmost earnest piety have made a defence of the royal prerogatives a part\r\nof their religion, and that some have gone even so far as to deny that\r\nin Prussia a Christian can be anything but a Conservative. It cannot but\r\nserve to soften many prejudices against this party to know that men like\r\nthe venerable Professor Tholuck, of Halle, are decided supporters of the\r\nGovernment, and regard the triumph of the Liberal party as almost\r\nequivalent to the downfall of the church. And it may serve in part to\r\nexcuse the persistence of the Government in its course to know that it\r\nis advised so to persist by men who should be supposed to have the\r\nhighest good of the country at heart.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, as we have remarked, the seeds of the present\r\nLiberal party were sown during this same period of national disaster,\r\nand that, too, by the royal hand. The regeneration of Prussia is\r\nattributed by all to the indefatigable efforts of the minister, Baron\r\nvon Stein, and, after he was deposed by command of Napoleon, of his\r\nsuccessor, Count Hardenberg. Their work, however, consisted not only in\r\nabolishing villanage, the usufruct of royal lands, serfdom, the\r\nexemption of the nobility from taxation, and the oppressive monopoly of\r\nthe guilds; in giving to all classes the right of holding landed\r\npossessions and high offices; in the reconstruction of the courts; in\r\nthe enfranchisement of the cities; in the promotion of general\r\neducation; in relieving military service of many abuses and\r\nseverities;--this was not all: the king was moved to issue, October 27,\r\n1810, an edict, in which he distinctly promised to give the people a\r\nconstitution and a national parliamentary representation. A year later\r\nthis promise was renewed. 'Our intention,' says the king, 'still is, as\r\nwe promised in the edict of October 27, 1810, to give the nation a\r\njudiciously constituted representation.' That this promise was not\r\nimmediately fulfilled is, considering the condition of the country, not\r\nspecially surprising. Whatever may then have been the king's personal\r\ninclinations, there is perhaps no reason to doubt that he intended to\r\nintroduce the constitution as soon as the return of peace should give\r\nhim the requisite means of devoting to the subject his undivided\r\nattention. That the promise was originally drawn from him by the urgent\r\ninfluence of his counsellors, especially Von Stein and Hardenberg, there\r\nis every reason to believe. That he should have been inclined,\r\nunsolicited, to limit his own power, is more than can ordinarily be\r\nexpected of monarchs. The bad love power because it gratifies their\r\nselfish lusts; the good, who really wish the weal of their subjects, can\r\neasily persuade themselves that the more freely they can use their\r\npower, the better it will be for all concerned. But, for whatever\r\nreasons, the pledge was given; yet, though Frederick William reigned\r\nthirty years after giving it, he never fulfilled the pledge. It may be\r\nthat, had he done so, the party divisions which now agitate the land\r\nwould not have been avoided. Conservatives might have complained that he\r\nhad yielded too much to the unreasonable demands of an unenlightened\r\npopulace; Liberals might have complained that he had not yielded enough;\r\nat all events, the opposing principles, of the divine right of kings,\r\nand of popular self-government, whatever form they might have taken,\r\nwould have divided public sentiment. This may have been; but even more\r\ncertain is it that the failure on the part of the monarch to carry out a\r\npromise solemnly and repeatedly made, a promise which he never would\r\nhave made unless believing that it would gratify his people, could not\r\nbut lead ultimately to a deep disaffection on the part of the people.\r\nHis course resembled too much the equivocating prophecies of the witches\r\nin Macbeth; he kept the word of promise to the ear, and broke it to the\r\nhope. It is then not strange that many should have found their faith in\r\nroyalty weakened, and come to the conclusion that whatever was to be\r\ngained in the point of popular government must be secured by insisting\r\non it as a right which the Government _nolens volens_ should be required\r\nto concede.\r\n\r\nSuch, in general terms, is the animus of the two political parties of\r\nPrussia. Turning to a more particular consideration of the historical\r\nprogress of events, we find that the first movement toward a freer\r\ndevelopment of popular character was made by Frederick the Great.\r\nThroughout his life he was inclined, theoretically, to favor a\r\nrepublican form of government; and, although he was no friend of sudden\r\nchanges, and did not think that the time had come for a radical change\r\nin Prussia, he yet recognized the truth that a king's duty is to act as\r\nthe servant of the state; and, in spite of the sternness with which, in\r\nmany relations, he exercised his power, he introduced some changes which\r\nmay be regarded as the earnests of a permanent establishment of a\r\nconstitutional government. These changes consisted specially in the\r\nincrease of freedom which he allowed respecting the press, religion, and\r\nthe administration of justice. But, as we have seen, nothing like a real\r\nlimitation of the royal power was undertaken until the War of Liberation\r\nseemed to make it a national necessity. The changes which Frederick\r\nWilliam's ministers made in the social and political condition of the\r\npeople were in themselves of vast and permanent importance. They were\r\nmade under the stimulus of a more or less clear recognition of the truth\r\nof natural, inalienable rights. Fighting against a people whose\r\nfrightful aggressions were the product of this principle abnormally\r\ndeveloped, they yet had to borrow their own weapons from the same\r\narmory. Or, if the republican principle was not at all approved, the\r\ncourse of the Government showed that it was so far believed in by the\r\npeople that certain concessions to it were necessary as a matter of\r\npolicy. But these changes were yet by no means equivalent to the\r\nintroduction of republican elements in the Government. An approach was\r\nmade toward the granting of equality of rights; but this was only\r\n_granted_; the Government was still absolute; strictly speaking, it had\r\nthe right, so far as formal obligations were concerned, to remove the\r\nvery privileges which it had given. But the _promise_ of something more\r\nwas given also. Besides the already-mentioned renewal of that promise,\r\nthe king, June 3, 1814, in an order issued while he was in Paris,\r\nintimated his intention to come to a final conclusion respecting the\r\nparticular form of the constitution after his return to Berlin. In May,\r\n1815, he issued another edict, the substance of which was that provision\r\nshould be made for a parliamentary representation of the people; that,\r\nto this end, the so-called estates of the provinces should be\r\nreorganized, and from them representatives should be chosen, who should\r\nhave the right to deliberate respecting all subjects of legislation\r\nwhich concern the persons and property of citizens; and that a\r\ncommission should be at once appointed, to meet in Berlin on the first\r\nof September, whose business should be to frame a constitution. But this\r\ncommission was not then appointed, and of course did not meet on the\r\nfirst of September. Two years later the commissioners were named; but\r\ntheir work has never been heard of.\r\n\r\nHere is to be discerned a manifest wavering in the mind of the king\r\nrespecting the fulfilment of his intentions. The German States, taught\r\nby the bitter experience of the late war the disadvantages of their\r\ndismembered condition, and bound together more closely than ever before\r\nby the recollection of their common sufferings and common triumphs, saw\r\nthe necessity of a real union, to take the place of the merely nominal\r\none which had thus far existed in the shadowy hegemony of the house of\r\nHapsburg. The German Confederation, essentially as it still exists, was\r\norganized at Vienna by the rulers of the several German States and\r\nrepresentatives from the free cities, June 8, 1815. Although there was\r\nin this assembly no direct representation of the people, it is clear\r\nthat its deliberations were in great part determined by the unmistakable\r\nutterances of the popular mind. For one of the first measures adopted\r\nwas to provide that in all the States of the Confederacy constitutional\r\ngovernments should be guaranteed. Frederick William himself was one of\r\nthe most urgent supporters of this provision. It is therefore not\r\ncalculated to elevate our estimation of the openness, honesty, and\r\nsimplicity for which this king is praised, and to which his general\r\ncourse seems to entitle him, that as late as March, 1818, in reply to a\r\npetition from the city of Coblenz, that he would grant the promised\r\nconstitution, he remarked that 'neither the order of May 22, 1815, nor\r\narticle xiii. of the acts of the Confederacy had fixed the _time_ of the\r\ngrant, and that the determination of this time must be left to the free\r\nchoice of the sovereign, in whom unconditional confidence ought to be\r\nplaced.' We are to account for this hesitation, however, not by\r\nsupposing that he originally intended to delay the measure in question\r\nso long as he actually did delay it, but by the fears with which he was\r\ninspired by the popular demonstrations in the times following the close\r\nof the war. The fact was palpable, not only that the idea of popular\r\nrights, notwithstanding the miserable failure of the French Revolution,\r\nhad become everywhere current, but that, together with this feeling, a\r\ndesire for German unity was weakening the hold of the several princes on\r\ntheir particular peoples. At this time sprang up the so-called _Deutsche\r\nBurschenschaft_, organizations of young men, whose object was to promote\r\nthe cause of German union. The tri-centennial anniversary of the\r\nReformation, in 1817, was made the occasion of inflaming the public mind\r\nwith this idea. The sentiment found ready access to the German heart. It\r\nwas shared and advocated by many of the best and ablest men. As\r\nsubsidiary to the same movement, was at the same time introduced the\r\npractice of systematic and social gymnastic exercises, an institution\r\nwhich still exists, and constitutes one of the most prominent features\r\nof the German movement. Immense concourses of gymnasts from all parts of\r\nGermany meet yearly to practise in friendly rivalry, and inspire one\r\nanother with zeal for the good of the common fatherland. But the\r\n_Burschenschaft_ in its pristine glory could not so long continue. The\r\nseparate German Governments were naturally jealous of the influence of\r\nthese organizations, and, though not able to accuse them of directly\r\naiming at treason and revolution, were ready to seize the first pretext\r\nfor striking at their power. A pretext was soon found. A certain Von\r\nKotzebue, a novelist of some notoriety, suspected of being a Russian\r\nspy, wrote a book in which he attacked the _Burschenschaft_ with great\r\nseverity. A theological student at Jena, Karl Sand, whose enthusiasm in\r\nthe cause of the _Burschenschaft_ had reached the pitch of a half-insane\r\nfanaticism, took it upon him to avenge the wounded honor of the German\r\nname. He visited Kotzebue at the dwelling of the latter, delivered him a\r\nletter, and, while he was reading it, stabbed him with a dagger. Sand\r\nwas of course executed, and, though it was proved that the crime was\r\nwholly his own, though the German Confederation, through a commission\r\nappointed specially for the purpose of searching all the papers of the\r\nparticipants in the _Burschenschaft_ movement, found no evidence of\r\nanything like treasonable purposes, yet it was resolved that these\r\n'demagogical intrigues' must cease. The _Burschenschaft_ was pronounced\r\na treasonable association; its members were punished by imprisonment or\r\nexile. The poet and professor Arndt and the professor Jahn, prominent\r\nleaders in the movement, were not only deposed from their\r\nprofessorships, but also imprisoned. The celebrated De Wette was removed\r\nfrom the chair of theology in the University of Berlin, simply because,\r\non the ground that an erring conscience ought to be obeyed, he had\r\nexcused the deed of Sand. In short, the princes intended effectually to\r\ncrush the efforts which, though indirectly, were tending to undermine\r\ntheir thrones. Seemingly they succeeded. But they had only 'scotched the\r\nsnake, not killed it.' It is easy to see that these developments must\r\nhave shaken Frederick William's purpose. Of all things, the most\r\nunpleasant to a monarch is to be driven by his subjects. In the present\r\ncase he saw not only a loosening of the loyalty which he felt to be due\r\nto him, but also a positive transfer of loyalty, if we may so speak,\r\nfrom the Prussian throne to the German people in general. If he should\r\nnow grant a popular constitution, he would seem not only to be yielding\r\nto a pressure, but would be surrendering what he regarded as a sacred\r\nright, into the hands of ungrateful recipients. He therefore set himself\r\nagainst the popular current, gave up his former plan, and contented\r\nhimself with restoring, in some degree, the form of government as it had\r\nexisted before the establishment of the absolute monarchy. He gave, in\r\n1823, to the estates of the provinces, a class of men consisting partly\r\nof nobles and owners of knights' manors, partly of representatives of\r\nthe cities and of the peasants, the right of _advising_ the crown in\r\nmatters specially concerning the several provinces. Nothing further was\r\ndone in the matter of modifying the constitution during the reign of\r\nFrederick William III., although he declared his _intention_ of\r\norganizing a national diet.\r\n\r\nComparative quiet ensued till 1830, when the French revolution, followed\r\nby the insurrection of the Austrian Netherlands against Holland, and of\r\nPoland against Russia, again stirred the public mind. But, although the\r\nPolish revolution, on account of its local proximity and ancient\r\npolitical relations, threatened to involve Prussia in war, she yet\r\nescaped the danger, and passed through the excitement with little\r\ninternal commotion. But the existence of disaffection was made manifest\r\nby sundry disturbances in the chief cities, which, however, were easily\r\nquelled. Suffering under no palpable oppression, accustomed once more to\r\npeace, seeing no prospect of gaining any radical change in the form of\r\ngovernment except through violent and bloody measures, which, as\r\nexperience had proved, would, after all, be likely to be unsuccessful,\r\nthe masses of the people had little heart for a constant agitation in\r\nbehalf of an indefinite and uncertain good. Those who did continue the\r\nagitation exhibited less of zeal for German unity and more for that sort\r\nof liberalism which had been current in France, than had marked the\r\nefforts of the _Burschenschaft_. Many of the leaders were obliged to\r\nescape the country, in order to avoid arrest.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Frederick William IV. ascended the throne. According to the old\r\ncustom, he summoned to Koenigsberg the estates of the provinces of\r\nPrussia and Posen to attend the coronation and take their oaths of\r\nfealty. On this occasion he inquired of this body whether they would\r\nelect twelve members of the East Prussian knighthood, to represent the\r\nold order of lords, and what privileges they wished to have secured.\r\nThey replied that they saw no need of reviving that order; and as to\r\nprivileges, instead of mentioning any in particular which they desired\r\nto see protected, they wished them all protected and confirmed. They\r\nthen reminded the king of the promise of his father to give the nation\r\na constitution and a diet. The king replied that their reasons for\r\ndeclining the first proposal were satisfactory, but the establishment of\r\na general representation of the people he must decline to grant, 'on\r\naccount of the true interests of the people intrusted to his care.' The\r\ndissatisfaction produced by this reply was somewhat tempered by the\r\nsplendor of the coronation ceremonies, and by the hitherto unknown\r\ncondescension of the king in addressing the assembled throng as he took\r\nupon him the vow to be a just judge, a faithful, provident, merciful\r\nprince, a Christian king, as his ever-memorable father had been.\r\nPersonally he was a man of more than ordinary talents and of estimable\r\ncharacter. High expectations could be, and were, entertained of the\r\nsuccess of his reign. One of his first acts was to release from prison\r\nthose who were there languishing for having been connected with the\r\n_Burschenschaft_. He manifested in his general policy a mildness and\r\nbenevolence which, had he lived when nothing had ever been heard of a\r\nconstitution, would have doubtless secured for him the uninterrupted\r\nlore and devotion of his subjects. As it was, it is probable that his\r\nreign would have been disturbed by no serious outbreak, had the occasion\r\nfor disturbance not come from without.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Frederick I. ruled till 1713; the succession since then has been as\r\nfollows: Frederick William I., 1713-'40; Frederick II. (the Great),\r\n1740-'86: Frederick William II., 1786-'97; Frederick William III.,\r\n1797-1840; Frederick William IV., 1840-'61; William I., 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASLEEP.\r\n\r\n  What, darling, asleep in this sylvan retreat!\r\n  Thy loose tresses sprinkled with rose petals sweet;\r\n  Blown in from the sunlight, some float to thy breast;\r\n  Less fragrant are they than their beautiful nest.\r\n\r\n  There flutt'ring a moment they rise and they sink,\r\n  As quivers a humbird his honey to drink,\r\n  Or fond doves a-wooing that shiver their wings,\r\n  Or throat of a song bird that throbs while he sings.\r\n\r\n  These petals at last swoon far down in thy snow,\r\n  Whose warm drifts of wonder they only can know;\r\n  And hidden they lie there all rocked by thy breath,\r\n  And pressed in soft odors to ravishing death.\r\n\r\n  Thine eyes their dear curtains now shut from the light,\r\n  Sweet veined and blue tinted they round to my sight,\r\n  Fair shells of deep oceans! And sometimes a shell,\r\n  When close to your ear, its home secrets will tell:\r\n\r\n  But in music so mystic, you cannot guess\r\n  The strange tales of Ocean it tries to confess.\r\n  So lady, thine eyelids, as skies shut the sea,\r\n  Or shells _try_ to whisper, are whisp'ring to me.\r\n\r\n  As glad streams of day 'neath the dawn's glowing tide,\r\n  So white keys of laughter thy curving lips hide,\r\n  Warm gates of the morning, when morning is new,\r\n  And red for the sunshine of smiles to break through!\r\n\r\n  Thy round arms rest o'er thee so fair and so lone,\r\n  Like that white path of stars across the night's zone:\r\n  That pathway, when twilight late vanishing dies,\r\n  Embraces the earth, though it quits not the skies.\r\n\r\n  Thus stars kiss the hills, and the trees, and the plain,\r\n  Yet never can they kiss the stars back again;\r\n  Though yearning they thirst for those arms of the sky,\r\n  They never will taste the white home where they lie.\r\n\r\n  So rivers and oceans with influence sweet,\r\n  Their mighty hearts swelling loved Luna to greet,\r\n  Strain sobbing their bosoms to hold her dear face,\r\n  And thrilled to their depths with her luminous grace,\r\n\r\n  In tossing waves rapturous rise to her smile.\r\n  In vain! Their coy queen half receding the while,\r\n  In slow fainting cadence they sink to the shore,\r\n  And hoarse tones of love-hunger moan evermore.\r\n\r\n  Ah, lady, bright sleeper, my soul, like the sea,\r\n  Illumed with thy beauty, is trembling to thee:\r\n  I kneel in the silence, and drink in the air\r\n  That, fragrant and holy, has toyed with thy hair;\r\n\r\n  And hushed in thy presence with worshipping fear--\r\n  The breeze even stills when it reaches thine ear--\r\n  My lips dare not whisper in softest refrain\r\n  The trance of my heart in its passionate pain.\r\n\r\n  Oh, open thine eyes! let their smile make me brave--\r\n  The Queen e'en of Ocean will _look_ at her slave!--\r\n  Let me drown in their light--deliciously drown,\r\n  And lay thy white hand on my head for a crown,\r\n\r\n  And chrism. And thus regally shrived, might I dare\r\n  Exhale the warm infinite incense of prayer\r\n  From my deep soul to thine. Nor then couldst thou know\r\n  The wealth of the censer. Thou wak'st!--must I go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASTLE IN THE AIR.\r\n\r\n  'I built my soul a lordly pleasure-house,\r\n    Wherein at ease for aye to dwell;\r\n  I said, 'O soul, make merry and carouse,\r\n    Dear soul, for all is well.'\r\n\r\n                                TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimes are changed. Most people (_i.e._, Bostonians) now build their\r\ncastles on the 'new land.'[4] But I belong to the old school, and I\r\nstill build mine in the air.\r\n\r\nThe situation has its advantages. As Miss Gail Hamilton observed, when I\r\nhad the pleasure of exhibiting it to her, it is airy. I need scarcely\r\nadd that it is the favorite haunt of those kindred spirits Ari-osto and\r\nAry Scheffer. It is too high ever to be reached by any unsavory odors\r\nfrom the Back Bay. Cool in summer it is also, notwithstanding,\r\nremarkably warm in winter. My castle is quite too retired for any\r\ncritics to intrude upon it. They cannot get at the plan of it even,\r\nunless in the event of its being shown them by my friend, the editor of\r\na popular magazine, which is a betrayal too improbable to enter into my\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nThere is no stucco or sham about my castle. Like a fair and frank\r\nrepublican, I built it all of pure freestone, from the doorsteps up to\r\nthe observatory. This observatory--I will speak of it while I think of\r\nit--holds a telescope exactly like the one at Cambridge, except that the\r\ntube has a blue-glass spectacle to screw on, through which it does not\r\nput out one's eye to look at the moon.\r\n\r\nMy workmen never make mistakes nor keep me waiting. The painters paint,\r\nthe upholsterers upholster, and the carpenters _carpent_ precisely when\r\nand as I wish. I do not have to heat myself by running over the town for\r\nstraw matting, nor to catch cold in crypts full of carpets. Everything\r\nthat I order comes to my door as soon as I order.\r\n\r\nEvery time that I go down Washington street, I choose something in the\r\nshop windows for my castle--an engraving at Williams & Everett's, a\r\nmosaic or classic onyx at Jordan's, or a camel's hair--for a dressing\r\ngown, of course at Hovey's. It really costs surprisingly little, and is\r\nan agreeable exercise of taste and judgment. It is likewise an exercise\r\nof benevolence. I select as many things for my guests as I do for\r\nmyself. My castle is never too full. Little by little my tastes change;\r\nand little by little, I let most of my old treasures go to make room for\r\nnew ones.\r\n\r\nBut certain principles always prevail in my selections. For instance, as\r\nmy particular friend, the Reverend George Herbert, remarked, as he\r\nlooked about him on one of his visits to my castle: 'Sober handsomeness\r\ndoth bear the bell.' I cannot admit anything gaudy, needlessly exotic,\r\nor impertinently obtruding the idea of dollars. Now a travelled lady,\r\nwho had heard of my castle, once offered me for it a buhl cabinet, of\r\nangry and alarming redness and a huge idol of a gilded trough, standing\r\non bandy legs, and gorged with artificial flowers. And I thanked her for\r\nher kind intentions, ordered a handcart, sent the lumber to auction, and\r\napplied the proceeds to the benefit of the insane.\r\n\r\nTapestry, however, clever bronzes, sheathed daggers from Hassam's with\r\nbeetles crawling on the hilts, and illuminated, brazen-clasped old\r\ntomes abound at my castle. They come to me one by one, each bringing\r\nwith it its separate pleasure. I have no fancy for buying up, at one\r\nfell swoop, the whole establishment of some bankrupt banker or\r\n_confiscated_ Russian nobleman. Instead of slipping at once, like a\r\ndishonest hermit-crab, into the whole investment of somebody else, I\r\nrather choose to come by my own, as I suppose other more happily\r\nconstituted shell-fish do, by gradual and individual accretion or\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nMy winter parlor looks down Beacon street. It is lofty, like all the\r\nrest of my apartments, but otherwise small and snug. The floor is of a\r\ndark wood, polished to the utmost. The great wood-fire loves to wink at\r\nits own glowing face mirrored in this floor; and, when alone, I often\r\nskate upon it. But as I do not wish to see my less sure-footed friends\r\ndisposed about it in writhing attitudes expressive of agony and broken\r\nbones, I usually keep it covered, up to a yard's breadth from the\r\ndark-carved wainscot, with a velvety carpet, which was woven for me at\r\nWilton, and represents the casting scene in the 'Song of the Bell.' The\r\nwindow curtains are of velvet, of just the shade of purple that nestles\r\nin the centre of the most splendid kind of fuchsia, and have an Etruscan\r\nborder and heavy fringes of gold bullion. The walls are covered with a\r\ncrimson velvet paper, of the hue of the outer petals of that same\r\nfuchsia, with little golden suns shining over it everywhere. One end of\r\nthe room is further lighted up by a portrait of the terrestrial fury\r\nEtna, in a full suit of grape vines and an explosion of fiery wrath.\r\nOpposite is a spirited scene, by an artist who shall be nameless,\r\nsuggested by a passage in an interesting sermon by Jonathan Edwards. The\r\ncontemplation of the latter picture, especially, makes a chance\r\nsensation of chilliness a luxury rather than the contrary.\r\n\r\nMy tawny Scotch terrier, Wye-I, always takes up his position on the\r\npurple plush cushion at one side of the fireplace, and the Maltese cat,\r\nCattiva, on the crimson one opposite, by instinct, because most becoming\r\nseverally to their complexions. The cat never catches mice. There are no\r\nmice in my castle for her to catch. The dog is much attached to her. He\r\nis considered remarkably intelligent. In gratitude for my forbearing to\r\ncut off his tail, he uses it as a brush, watches the coals, and, when\r\nthey snap out, sweeps them up with it. He sometimes, with a natural\r\nsensibility which does him no discredit, accompanies the performance\r\nwith the appropriate music which has earned him his name.\r\n\r\nMy summer parlor is much larger. It is paved with little hexagonal\r\ntiles, green, purple, and white alternately, like a bed of cool violets,\r\nwith a border of marine shells in mosaic. The walls are cloaked as\r\ngreatly as the _Cloaca Maxima_, with verdant leaves, light and dark,\r\nthrough which, here and there, peeps a rock. There is no arsenic among\r\nthem. The windows look seaward to see the ships come and go. Venetian\r\nblinds, of the kind that turn up and down, admit only green light at\r\nnoon, softer or brighter according to my mood. Lace curtains sweep the\r\nfloor with a slumberous sound when the sea breeze breathes in. Some of\r\nmy visitors might say that this room was too empty. I should promptly\r\ndisagree with them. To a person of correct taste, not to speak of a\r\nphilanthropic bias, it must be painful to see, in warm weather, anything\r\nwhich calls up a vision of warm handmaidens, laborious with their brooms\r\nand dusters. Therefore I must persist in admitting here little furniture\r\nbesides the oriental bamboo couches and porcelain barrels that flank the\r\nroom, with little daisy-and-moss-like _chenille_ rugs beside them. One\r\nCanton tepoy holds my _aquarium_, and another, beside the most\r\nfrequented of the lounges, the last number of the most weighty of North\r\nAmerican periodicals. If ever I take a nap, it is here.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room, a white-marble Egeria, carved by Thorwaldsen,\r\nthrows up between her hands a shaft of cold crystal water, pure as\r\ntruth, which spreads into a silvery veil all around her, and plashes\r\ndown in a snowy basin: no place could be more inviting for a bath. But\r\nin the winter Egeria shows her power of adaptation by furnishing instead\r\na Geyser of hot water. Then I turn my scientific friends in here, when\r\nthey call upon me, to make them feel at home.\r\n\r\nIn the position of Jack Horner, sits Miss Hosmer's Puck. Opposite is a\r\nmate production, which she never put on exhibition. It is Ariel, perched\r\nhiding in a honeysuckle, and leaning slyly out to play on an AEolian harp\r\nin a cottage latticed window.\r\n\r\nOver the somewhat frequented couch of which I have spoken, there is a\r\npicture by Paul Delaroche of\r\n\r\n                     'Sabrina fair\r\n  Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,\r\n    In twisted braids of lilies knitting\r\n  The loose folds of her amber-dropping hair.'\r\n\r\nOn the other side hangs another painting which I prefer, partly perhaps\r\nbecause even in my castle I was for a time at a loss how to procure it.\r\nThe subject was recommended to me by Hans Christian Andersen. It is the\r\nstory of a beautiful princess. Are not Danish princesses always\r\nbeautiful?\r\n\r\nHer numerous brothers were so unfortunate as to be laid, by a witch,\r\nunder a spell of a most inconvenient sort. Every morning they were\r\nturned into wild swans. Every day they were obliged to fly over many a\r\nleague of gray ocean to the mainland and back to their home, an island\r\nin the midst of the sea. At every sunset they resumed their natural\r\nshape, and were princes all night. One day they met their sister on the\r\nshore. They undertook to carry her back with them. Her Weight made them\r\nslower than usual. A storm came up in the after noon. There was a sad\r\nprobability of the swans being turned into princes again before they\r\ncould possibly 'see her home.'\r\n\r\nIn my picture, half of the swans are a plumy raft for her, and row her\r\nthrough the air with their sweeping wings. Another relay, more tired,\r\nperhaps, make a canopy over her, and fan her as they fly. Their\r\noutstretched gaze sees only the island. But the princess, as she lies\r\nfacing backward, sees the danger. In despairing, motionless silence, she\r\nlooks at the sinking sun, with no color in her cheeks but that which he\r\ncasts upon her. The red, warning sun looks awfully back, face to face\r\nwith her, in the narrowing strip of blue sky between two horizontal bars\r\nof thundering clouds, which the lightning is beginning to chain\r\ntogether, that the night may come before its time, and the enchanted\r\nprinces and their sister may drown in darkness.\r\n\r\nChurch did the water very well, and Paul Weber the island. Rosa Bonheur\r\nwas so kind as to paint the swans--I need not say how. But the rest of\r\nthe picture was such a perplexity to me that I could think of nothing\r\nbetter than to send for Mr. Laroy Sunderland to call one day when I was\r\nout, and knock up Raphael to draw the princess, and Salvator Rosa, the\r\nclouds, and Titian to see to the sky and light. When I came in again,\r\nthe completed whole met me as a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nNot far off are Landseer's 'Challenge,' and a few other Arctic pieces of\r\nhis, which I look at in July to keep myself cool. But the chief of my\r\npictures are in the picture gallery, at the top of my castle, lighted\r\nfrom above. _Connoisseurs_ assure me, with rare candor, that the\r\n'Transfiguration,' 'Last Judgment,' 'Assumption of the Virgin,' and so\r\nforth, there, are duplicates rather than copies of the originals.\r\n\r\nIn my library there is scarcely a single picture to be found, nor a\r\nstatue, nor a bust even, except of the duskiest, self-hiding bronze\r\noverhead--only some dim, dark engraving, or brown, antiquated autograph,\r\nfading in a little black frame, or a signet ring hanging against the\r\nbook written by the crumbled hand that once wore it--only relics having\r\nthe power to excite thought without distracting attention--- unobtrusive\r\nmemorials of the dead with whom I am soon to live. Rich, black, old\r\nbookcases, carved all over in high relief, hold their immortal works or\r\nthe records of their undying deeds. Even the writings of the living are\r\nsparingly admitted here. I stand on my guard constantly, lest I be\r\nenslaved by their influence. It is less by obsequiousness to the Present\r\nthan by listening to the admonitions of the Past, that we may hope to\r\ngain a hearing from the Future.\r\n\r\nSaints and seraphs, such as they appeared to _Fra Angelico_, look in\r\nupon me through the stained-glass windows, that I may always read and\r\nstudy as if under their holy eyes. Ivy runs thickly over their deep\r\narched recesses, and over the stags' heads which surmount them. In\r\nwinter, little but painted beams and glow come through them. In summer,\r\nthe oriel opens of an evening to show me the phantom ships that haunt\r\nthe misty, dreamy harbor; and the lattices that look westerly over the\r\nlake-like mouth of the Charles, are seldom shut against the sun or moon.\r\n\r\nThe floor is smoothly paved with broad, square slabs of freestone, on\r\nwhich is here or there engraved one or another illustrious name, like a\r\n'footprint on the sands of time,' with a date of birth and death. Tables\r\nthat match the bookcases support portfolios containing allegorical\r\ndesigns by Relszch, Blake, and Albrecht Durer. On a writing desk, that\r\nwas once Vittoria Colonna's, a little Parian angel holds my ink for me,\r\nkneeling as if to ask a blessing upon it, and to entreat me to blot no\r\npages with it in the souls whereon I write,\r\n\r\n        [Greek: 'Mede mousa moi\r\n  Genoit aoidos etis umnesei kaka']\r\n\r\nBefore the reading chairs, plenty of tiger and leopard skins lie in wait\r\nto cherish the cool feet of students, but there is nothing to trip up my\r\nown, along the long diameter of the long oval room, if sometimes the\r\nfancy seizes me to walk up and down there for hours alone, listening to\r\nthe 'voices' that are not 'from without.'\r\n\r\nAt the end opposite to the oriel, I have just had placed an organ, the\r\ntwin of the new one at the Music Hall, except that the faces on the\r\npipes are beautiful, and do not look as if it hurt them to pipe. The\r\nworld may be too small; but the organ cannot possibly be too large.\r\nMalibran, Jenny Lind, or Mrs. Mott usually sings to it of an evening,\r\naccompanied by Franz, Schubert, or Mendelssohn; or Beethoven drops in to\r\nplay one of his symphonies. Sunday nights, Handel performs upon it\r\nregularly for a choir composed of Vaughan, Herbert, the minister who\r\nchants 'Calm on the listening ear of night,' Madame Guyon, and Sarah\r\nAdams. Between their hymns, Robertson preaches a sermon and reads from\r\nthe liturgy of King's Chapel. This service is designed as a special\r\neasement to the consciences and stomachs alike of those oppressed\r\nChristians, whom modern customs and physical laws impel, of an\r\nafternoon, to be dining and digesting precisely at the hours during\r\nwhich their pastors are unaccountably and unjustifiably in the habit of\r\npreaching.\r\n\r\nThe books upon the shelves, last not least, are less numerous than\r\nchoice. Among them still are to be found the most masterly writings of\r\nthe most masterly minds in the three learned professions, and the\r\nnoblest treatises on the nobler of the arts and sciences. There are many\r\n'chronicles of eld,' which, if not true, as the Frenchman said, at any\r\nrate '_meritent bien de l'etre_.' There are such few fictions as bear\r\nthe stamp of much individual thought, character, and observation.\r\nEspecially there is a great deal of biography; for biography is the\r\ngreat, all-embracing epic of humanity.\r\n\r\nTwo suits of armor stand on guard, one on each side, by each\r\nwell-assorted bookcase. I always think it prudent to warn my incautious\r\nvisitors that these are _automata_, wound up and set to deal a box with\r\ntheir gauntleted hands on each ear of each disorderly wight who puts a\r\nbook where it does not belong.\r\n\r\nBelow my library, and beyond my courtyard, is a boat in which I row\r\nmyself out in warm weather to visit my friends along the coast. When I\r\nply the oar, the crab-fishery is unproductive, droughts prevail, and I\r\nam not often upset or drowned.\r\n\r\nIn my stable are sometimes to be found, eating unmingled oats, two tame\r\nponies, Mattapony and Poniatowski. They take my invalid acquaintance out\r\non airings in the daytime, and my lingering guests home at a reasonable\r\nhour in the evening. The coachman thinks it is good for the horses to be\r\nout in bad weather. He loves to wash the coach. For my own use, I keep a\r\nlarge dapple-gray, an ex-charger of the purest blood. He has the\r\nsmoothest canter and the finest mouth that I ever felt; but, with decent\r\nregard to appearances, and my private preferences, expressed or\r\nunderstood, he never fails to prance in a manner to strike awe and\r\nterror into all beholders, for full five minutes every time I mount him.\r\n\r\nIn the common world, I myself am, I trust, often amiable--always in some\r\nrespects exemplary. In my castle, I am always all that I ought to\r\nbe--all that I wish to be. I am as stately as Juno, as beautiful as\r\nAdonis, as elegant as Chesterfield, as edifying as Mrs. Chapone, as\r\neloquent as Burke, as noble as Miss Nightingale, as perennial as the\r\nCountess of Desmond, and as robust as Dr. Windship. I also understand\r\neverything but entomology and numismatology; and if I do not understand\r\nthem, the only reason is that, as the dear little boys say, 'I _doe_\r\nwant to.'\r\n\r\nThe blossom-end of the day I keep to myself in my castle. I spend all\r\nthe mornings alone in the library writing--_calamo currente_, like one\r\nof the heroines of the author of 'Ohone'--the most admirable romances\r\nand poems of the age. People very seldom call to see me. When they do,\r\nthey go away again directly on hearing that I am engaged, without as\r\nmuch as sending in a message. My porter has Fortunatus's purse, and is\r\ngiving discreet largesses, in collusion with the agent of the Provident\r\nAssociation, to the less opulent of the beggars who apply for my\r\npecuniary aid, while I am providing above for the wants of those who\r\ncrave my higher wealth. So that really the only drawback to the pleasure\r\nenjoyed by me at such times, is the idea of the frightful quarrels which\r\nmust arise, as soon as I put anything to the press, between the\r\nbooksellers, who stand ready to contend with one another for the honor\r\nof publishing it. The very first novel I ever completed led to a duel\r\nbetween the Montague and Capulet of the trade, in which each party must\r\nhave lost his life but for the strenuous interposition of Noah\r\nWorcester. The fear of a repetition of that scene is all which withholds\r\nme from more frequently answering the importunate calls of the public to\r\nappear before them. Matters were simultaneously almost as bad between\r\nBirket Foster and Darley. But I made a compromise there, by promising\r\nthat, the next time I got out an edition, I would get out another, and\r\nthat of the two each artist should illustrate one. Each eagerly agreed\r\nto this arrangement, naturally feeling sure that such a comparison would\r\nforever establish his own superiority.\r\n\r\nDid I say there was but one drawback to my pleasure? There is one more.\r\nIt is the idea of the monotonous uniformity with which the Reviews will\r\neulogize me. They cannot say a word of commendation beyond what is\r\nstrictly true, I am fully aware; and I am not obliged to read any more\r\nof it than I please. Still it may appear extravagant to the very few yet\r\nunacquainted with the merits of my works.\r\n\r\nOf an evening I am usually at home to visitors; and three times every\r\nwinter I give the young people a ball. It breaks up at twelve. I provide\r\nnone but the lightest wines. Nor do I encourage the 'round dances.' I\r\nreally cannot. Those who do not think it right to join in them would\r\neither do so against their consciences, or feel left out and forlorn;\r\npretty girls would get overheated, tumbled, and torn, and carry about\r\nthe marks of black arms on their delicate waists; and youths,\r\nunsurpassed in the natural nobleness of their port and presence, would\r\nmake ridiculous faces in their well-founded anxiety lest they should\r\nlose the time or meet with collisions. But I give them, to make such\r\namends as I can, plenty of room, pure air, neither hot nor cold, and\r\nflowers in abundance. Soyer furnishes their supper; Strauss and Labitzky\r\nplay for them; and they are in a measure consoled for their privations\r\nby seeing and hearing how uncommonly handsome they look to the end of\r\nthe evening. The only qualifications I require for admission to the\r\nentertainment are, that the candidates shall be generally acquainted\r\nwith one another, respectable in character, tasteful in dress, happy and\r\nkind in their looks, and well-mannered enough to show that they have\r\nassembled to give and receive as much innocent pleasure as they can.\r\n\r\nGood talkers and good listeners only are invited to my dinner parties. I\r\ngive one every Wednesday. It is a pleasant thing to look forward to\r\nthrough the first half of the week, and to look back upon through the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nMy cook likes it. She is the complement to the unhappy gentleman who had\r\n'the temperament of genius without genius.' She has the genius without\r\nthe temperament.\r\n\r\nPart of my waiters are the attendant hands formerly engaged in the\r\nservice of the White Cat. They are always gloved, and never spill nor\r\nbreak anything. Others, who are dumb, carry everything needed safely to\r\nand fro between table and kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe walls of my dining room are hung with portraits of all of my\r\npresentable ancestors, from the time of Apelles down to that of Copley.\r\nThere are not too many of them to leave room for some Dutch paintings of\r\nfruit, game, and green-grocers' shops, for whets to the hunger.\r\n\r\nMy responsibility, with regard to the banquet, begins and ends with\r\nseeing, as I never fail to do, that each of the banqueters has a\r\ngenerally agreeable and peculiarly congenial companion. As for myself, I\r\nmaintain that a host has his privileges; and I always place the Reverend\r\nSydney Smith very near my right hand. On my left, I enjoy a variety. The\r\nAutocrat of the Breakfast Table is sometimes so kind as to grace that\r\ncorner of my dinner table. So is a gentleman who was once two years\r\nbefore the mast as an uncommon sailor; and so is Sir Lainful, and a\r\nchild from a neighboring college town, whose society is better than that\r\nof most men.\r\n\r\nNothing is more promotive of digestion than laughter. I regret that my\r\nexperience does not enable me to speak quite so favorably of choking. By\r\nmeans of the latter, my bright career was, on the very first of this\r\nseries of festivities, nearly brought to a premature close. But as upon\r\nthat occasion it was impossible for me to stop laughing, so likewise was\r\nit impossible for me to stop living. Some sort of action of the lungs\r\nwas kept up, and complete asphyxia prevented; and, having smiled myself\r\nnearly to death, I smiled myself back to life again. Ever since, my\r\n_convives_, apprised of this mortal frailty of mine, time their remarks\r\nmore prudently, and allow me to take alternately a joke and a morsel.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott always sits at the farther end of the table. He is the\r\nbest talker that I ever heard, but not so good for dinner as he is for\r\nluncheon, because what he says is too interesting, and takes away one's\r\nappetite; nor for supper either, because he makes one dream. I always\r\ncontrive that the more plethoric of my guests shall take their seats\r\nnear him.\r\n\r\n_I_ could never be tired of Macaulay; but he contradicts people, and\r\nonce made two ladies cry. They were introduced to me by an author to\r\nwhom I owe much enjoyment, Miss Wetherell, of the State of New York. One\r\nwas the bride of the Reverend John Humphreys, and the other Mrs. Guy\r\nCarleton. To be sure, I did not see why they should cry--unless from\r\nhabit; but still, he ought not to have made them.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, those who show no signs of having talked themselves out,\r\nare rewarded and encouraged by being privately invited to prolong their\r\nstay, and meet a few other guests in the library.\r\n\r\nShakspeare always appears there among the first, collected and calm, but\r\nwhether happy or not, his manner does not show. With regard both to his\r\npast and present life, his reserve is impenetrable. Like a mocking bird,\r\nhe utters himself in so many different strains, that I can seldom make\r\nout which is most his own, except when he will sing one of his little\r\nlyrics; when, I must say, I never heard so sweet and rich a voice but\r\nthat of Milton on such occasions, or those of Shelley's skylark and\r\ncloud. But yet, whether this voice of his own says that the heart out of\r\nwhich it comes is most glad or sad, I never can distinguish.\r\n\r\nDante comes with him, as tall, and, I think, as strong a man; but 'Pace'\r\nis still upon his lips and not upon his brow. He complains that heaven\r\nis a melancholy place to him. He has become better acquainted with\r\nBeatrice, and finds her not more beautiful than the rest of the angels,\r\nand otherwise rather a commonplace spirit.\r\n\r\nTo Goethe I usually have myself excused. To borrow a little slang from\r\nthe critics, he 'draws' uncommonly well, especially when he draws\r\nportraits. But I do not care to have my eye trained much by an artist\r\nwho has such an infirmity of color that he does not know black from\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nSchiller meets with many a welcome, and rarely a heartier one than when\r\nhe brings his Wilhelm Tell or Jungfrau. I should be glad to ask some of\r\nthose who are more intimate with him than I am, whether he is not a good\r\ndeal like three wise men, whose plays Socrates and I used to go to see\r\nperformed at Athens, two or three thousand years ago, when I was there.\r\nFurther, I should be glad to ask whether it would not be better if, in\r\none respect, he were more like them still. As he at least has seemed to\r\nme to do, they threw the strength of their invention into two or three\r\nimpersonations; but as he sometimes does, they always--to steal a term\r\nfrom the nearest grocery--lumped all the merely necessary and accessary\r\npeople, and called them simply 'Chorus.' Thus the wise men's ingenuities\r\nand our memories were spared the trouble of assigning and remembering a\r\nhost of insignificant names; and there was no looking back to the\r\n_dramatis personae_, or _dramatos prosopa_, as we called them then, to\r\nfind out _who was who_.\r\n\r\nA Government officer sometimes reports himself at my gates from Rydal,\r\nwith a washing tub of ink on castors, which he pushes about with him\r\nwherever he goes, and in which, as in a Claude-Lorraine mirror, he\r\ncontemplates everything that he can both on earth and above. He is\r\nconstantly employed in fishing in it with a quill for ideas; and as\r\noften as he catches one, even if it is half drowned, my door-keeper\r\nopens to him.\r\n\r\nLady Geraldine was one of my most constant guests of an evening. But\r\nafter her courtship and marriage, she was too apt to bring in her\r\nhusband. I received him cordially enough two or three times,\r\nparticularly when he came with 'the good news from Ghent.' But on other\r\noccasions his conversation was so far from agreeable, so unintelligible,\r\nor, 'not to put too fine a point upon it,' unedifying, that at last my\r\nporter was obliged to hand him out for immediate chastisement.[5] He\r\nnever came again. I do not quite see why not; for, if others are willing\r\nto take pains for his good, he certainly should be no less so.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe does honor to one of the most honorable places in the\r\nassembly--her head crowned with an everlasting glory by the spirit of\r\nUncle Tom.\r\n\r\nPoor Charlotte Bronte is always present. She looks happy at last, with a\r\nhappiness that is not of this world; and if her laurels are but earthly\r\nlaurels, I often fancy that in the hand which smoothed her sisters'\r\ndeathbeds, I can discern a heavenly palm. There are not many secular\r\nwriters whom I would not turn away, if need were, to make room for her.\r\nIf I do not always admire her characters, I do her mind. I do not\r\naltogether like her stories; but I want words to express my appreciation\r\nof the way in which she tells them.\r\n\r\nI may state in this place, as well as in any, that--an enlightened\r\nconservative in all things--I always hold myself in readiness to\r\nreceive, with marked distinction, intellectual women, who 'keep to their\r\nsphere,' such as Miss Mitchell, whose sphere is the celestial globe,\r\nMiss Austin, whose sphere is the _beau monde_, and Miss Blackwell, whose\r\nsphere is the pill.\r\n\r\nCromwell, or Frederick the Great either, would have secured a standing\r\ninvitation for Carlyle, I dare say; but it is impossible for me to\r\noverlook his present state of politics. I have little doubt that it fell\r\nupon him as a Nemesis, in the first place for writing bad English, and\r\nsecondly for daring to 'damn with faint praise' the loyal, generous,\r\njoyous, chivalrous, religious soldier, Frederick, Baron de la\r\nMotte-Fouque, and prince of romance. When the latter presents himself\r\nfor admission my castle needs short siege. The drawbridge falls before\r\nthe summons; and when I see him cross my threshold with his lovely and\r\nnoble children, Ondine and Sintram, I should be almost too happy, if I\r\nwere not afraid of his being affronted by the mischievous humor of\r\nCervantes.\r\n\r\nFor Cervantes will make his way in now and then. It is impossible\r\nutterly to banish so much originality, elegance, and grace as his, even\r\nif the fun which accompanies them is sometimes too broad; and, when he\r\ncomes to see me, he is always on his very best behavior. Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne came once; but I thought he talked too much about himself; and\r\nscarcely anybody seemed to know him.\r\n\r\nHazlitt brought me a letter of introduction from the Emperor Napoleon. I\r\nwas not inclined to think much of either of them; but I knew Hazlitt was\r\na friend of Lamb's; and I have a regard for Lamb, on account of his\r\nregard for his sister. So my porter asked Mr. Hazlitt to walk in; and so\r\nMr. Hazlitt did. Presently I heard him say, in an aside to Mrs. Jameson,\r\nthat women were usually very stupid; if not by nature, by education and\r\nprinciple. The next time he called I happened to be rather particularly\r\nengaged in writing a review of him. Nobody ever heard him say anything\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nOf course, I single out merely a few even of the 'representative men and\r\nwomen' among my guests, and conveniences and luxuries in my\r\nestablishment. If I told over the tithe of them, I should become\r\ndiffuse; but if there is any one thing for which, more than for any\r\nother thing, my writings are remarkable, that one thing[6] is a\r\nthrice-condensed conciseness--in my castle in the air.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Land recently reclaimed from the Back Bay, near the foot of Beacon\r\nstreet, in which the richer citizens of Boston are continually building\r\nand furnishing the most showy houses.\r\n\r\n[5] I was made a convert to that excellent officer, Corporal Punishment,\r\nby the 'happy effects,' as medical writers say of blisters, thereby\r\nbrought about in the case of a divine of tender years, who had got at\r\nhis Bible through the medium of German (not Luther's).\r\n\r\nTaking for his text the first verse of Genesis, he paraphrased it: 'In\r\nthe beginning, all things projected themselves from within outward, and\r\nevolved a Final Cause out of the depths of their individual\r\nconsciousness.' As soon as he had got through his discourse and\r\ngratefully asked a blessing on all that we had 'learned and taught,' the\r\nsexton, who apparently entertained unusually high and comprehensive view\r\nof the duties of his calling, attended the preacher to the vestry.\r\nThence presently issued cries indicative not only of remorse, but of\r\nsome kind of physical distress. The two are often connected as\r\nintimately as mysteriously in the discipline of the visible world,\r\nalthough we are often assured by those who must know, that they have\r\nnothing whatever to do with each other In the invisible. On the\r\nreappearance of the offender, as he meekly wiped his eyes and passed\r\ndown the aisle, he was heard, in a broken voice, inquiring of the\r\ndeacons where a Hebrew dictionary could be bought; and I have since been\r\ncredibly informed that before he arrived at maturity he had learned a\r\ngood deal.\r\n\r\nNow anybody can read German; in fact, a great many persons seem wholly\r\nunable to stop. But if we do not keep a theological boy to read our\r\nGreek and Hebrew for us, then what do we keep one for? Or, to make the\r\nquestion intelligible to those among us who speak the Sweden-borgian\r\ntongue, what 'uses does he perform?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S CANON IN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis wonderful ravine is more generally known under the name of the\r\n_Geysers of California_, an ambitious misnomer, which associates it with\r\nthe grand Geysers of Iceland, and has given rise to erroneous ideas in\r\nregard to the nature and action of the springs it contains.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent idea of a geyser is a hot fountain, sometimes quiescent,\r\nbut at others rising in turbulent eruption. The mere existence of a hot\r\nspring does not imply a 'geyser,' for, if such were the case, their\r\nnumber would be very great, hot springs in many parts of the world being\r\nfrequent if not general accompaniments of volcanic action.\r\nUnquestionably, the Geysers of Iceland, the 'Strokr,' and the spring of\r\nthe Devil's Canon, the 'Witches' Caldron', are the results of volcanic\r\naction; but that action differs essentially in its operation. The\r\n'Strokr' and the 'Great Geyser' are intermittent, and are accounted for\r\nby the siphon theory: the 'Witches' Caldron' is always full and boiling,\r\nand no difference is seen in it from one year's end to another.\r\n\r\nIt is not, moreover, a fountain, but a basin in the hillside, in which a\r\nblack and muddy spring is always bubbling without overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe great eruptions of the Icelandic Geysers are, it has been observed,\r\naccounted for by the siphon theory; in other words, this theory supposes\r\nthe existence of a chamber in the heated earth, not quite full of water,\r\nand communicating with the upper air by means of a pipe, whose lower\r\norifice is _at the side_ of the cavern and _below_ the surface of the\r\nwater. The water, being kept boiling by the intense heat, generates\r\nsteam, which soon accumulates such force as to discharge the contents of\r\nthe pond into the air through the narrow vent, or, at least enough to\r\nallow of the escape of the superfluous steam. In the Great Geyser of\r\nIceland this eruption occurs with tremendous power, lasting only a few\r\nmoments, when, all the volume of water falling back into the pool, it\r\nsinks much below its ordinary level, and remains quiescent for several\r\ndays, until a fresh creation of steam repeats the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n'The Witches' Caldron,' which is the 'Great Geyser' of California, on\r\nthe contrary, never rises into the air; the subterranean pond of which\r\nit is the safety valve, may be considered to rise in it, as in a pipe,\r\nto the surface. It is not necessary to suppose a siphon; a straight\r\npipe, communicating with the air, will account for all that is peculiar\r\nto this hot spring.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to describe the wonders of the 'Devil's Canon,' it may\r\nbe well to give some account of the Geysers of Iceland, to render this\r\nessential difference in character the more striking, especially as\r\nnumerous theories, professing to account for the Californian phenomena,\r\nhave been propounded by the people of that State, none of which are\r\nthoroughly satisfactory to any one who has examined them attentively.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from 'Letters from High Latitudes,' which\r\nappeared in 1861, and is only one of many accounts by Iceland\r\ntravellers. Those interested in these matters will derive much\r\ninformation from the sketches of Mr. J. Ross Browne, which have had many\r\nreaders through _Harper's Magazine_. We quote:\r\n\r\n     'I do not know that I can give you a better notion of the\r\n     appearance of the place than by saying that it looked as if for\r\n     about a quarter of a mile the ground had been honey-combed by\r\n     disease into numerous sores and orifices; not a blade of grass grew\r\n     on its hot, inflamed surface, which consisted of\r\n     unwholesome-looking, red, livid clay, or crumbled shreds and shards\r\n     of slough-like incrustations. Naturally enough, our first impulse\r\n     on dismounting was to scamper off to the Great Geyser. As it lay at\r\n     the farthest end of the congeries of hot springs, in order to reach\r\n     it we had to run the gauntlet of all the pools of boiling water and\r\n     scalding quagmires of soft clay that intervened, and consequently\r\n     arrived on the spot with our ankles nicely poulticed. But the\r\n     occasion justified our eagerness.\r\n\r\n     'A smooth, silicious basin, seventy-two feet in diameter and four\r\n     feet deep, wide at the bottom, as in washing basins on board a\r\n     steamer, stood before us, brimful of water just upon the simmer;\r\n     while up into the air above our heads rose a great column of vapor,\r\n     looking as if it was going to turn into the Fisherman's Genie. The\r\n     ground above the brim was composed of layers of incrusted silica\r\n     like the outside of an oyster shell, sloping gently down on all\r\n     sides from the edge of the basin.\r\n\r\n     'As the baggage train with our tents and beds had not yet arrived,\r\n     we fully appreciated our luck in being treated to so dry a night;\r\n     and having eaten everything we could lay hands on, we sat quietly\r\n     down to chess, and _coffee brewed in geyser water_; when suddenly\r\n     it seemed as if beneath our very feet a quantity of subterranean\r\n     cannon were going off: the whole earth shook, and Sigurdr, starting\r\n     to his feet, upset the chess board (I was just beginning to get the\r\n     best of the game), and started off at full speed toward the great\r\n     basin. By the time we reached its brim, however, the noise had\r\n     ceased, and all we could see was a slight movement in the centre,\r\n     as if an angel had passed by and troubled the water. Irritated by\r\n     this false alarm, we determined to revenge ourselves by going and\r\n     tormenting the Strokr.\r\n\r\n     'The Strokr--or the _Churn_--you must know, is an unfortunate\r\n     geyser, with so little command over his temper and his stomach that\r\n     you can get a _rise_ out of him whenever you like. All that is\r\n     necessary is to collect a quantity of sods, and throw them down his\r\n     funnel. As he has no basin to protect him from these liberties, you\r\n     can approach to the very edge of the pipe, about five feet in\r\n     diameter, and look down at the boiling water, which is perpetually\r\n     seething at the bottom. In a few minutes the dose of turf you have\r\n     administered begins to disagree with him; he works himself up into\r\n     an awful passion--tormented by the qualms of incipient sickness; he\r\n     groans and hisses, and boils up and spits at you with malicious\r\n     vehemence, until at last, with a roar of mingled pain and rage, he\r\n     throws up into the air a column of water forty feet high, which\r\n     carries with it all the sods that have been chucked in, and\r\n     scatters them scalded and half digested at your feet. So irritated\r\n     has the poor thing's stomach become by the discipline it has\r\n     undergone, that long after all foreign matter has been thrown off,\r\n     it goes on retching and spluttering, until, at last, nature is\r\n     exhausted, when, sobbing and sighing to itself, it sinks back into\r\n     the bottom of its den. Put into the highest spirits by the success\r\n     of this performance, we turned to examine the remaining springs. I\r\n     do not know, however, that any of the rest are worthy of any\r\n     particular mention. They all resemble in character the two I have\r\n     described, the only difference being that they are infinitely\r\n     smaller, and of much less power and importance.\r\n\r\n     'As our principal object in coming so far was to see an eruption of\r\n     the Great Geyser, it was of course necessary to wait his pleasure;\r\n     in fact, our movements entirely depended upon his. For the next two\r\n     or three days, therefore, like pilgrims round some ancient shrine,\r\n     we patiently kept watch, but he scarcely deigned to vouchsafe us\r\n     the slightest manifestation of his latent energies. Two or three\r\n     times the cannonading we heard immediately after our arrival\r\n     recommenced--and once an eruption to the height of about ten feet\r\n     occurred; but so brief was its duration, that by the time we were\r\n     on the spot, although the tent was not eighty yards distant, all\r\n     was over; as after every effort of the fountain, the water in the\r\n     basin mysteriously ebbed back into the funnel. This performance,\r\n     though unsatisfactory in itself, gave us an opportunity of\r\n     approaching the mouth of the pipe, and looking down its scalded\r\n     gullet. In an hour afterward the basin was brimful as ever.\r\n\r\n     'On the morning of the fourth day a cry from the guides made us\r\n     start to our feet, and with one common impulse rush toward the\r\n     basin. The usual subterranean thunders had already commenced. A\r\n     violent agitation was disturbing the centre of the pool. Suddenly a\r\n     dome of water lifted itself up to the height of eight or ten\r\n     feet--then burst and fell; immediately after which a shining liquid\r\n     column, or rather sheaf of columns, wreathed in robes of vapor,\r\n     sprang into the air, and in a succession of jerking leaps, each\r\n     higher than the last, flung their silver crests against the sky.\r\n     For a few minutes the fountain held its own, then all at once\r\n     appeared to lose its ascending energy. The unstable waters\r\n     faltered--drooped--fell, 'like a broken purpose,' back upon\r\n     themselves, and were immediately sucked down into the recesses of\r\n     their pipe.\r\n\r\n     'The spectacle was certainly magnificent; but no description can\r\n     give an idea of its most striking features. The enormous wealth of\r\n     water, its vitality, its hidden power, the illimitable breadth of\r\n     sunlit vapor, rolling out in exhaustless profusion--all combined to\r\n     make one feel the stupendous energy of nature's slightest movement.\r\n\r\n     'And yet I do not believe that the exhibition was so fine as some\r\n     that have been seen: from the first burst upward to the moment the\r\n     last jet retreated into the pipe, was no more than a space of seven\r\n     or eight minutes, and at no moment did the crown of the column\r\n     reach higher than sixty or seventy feet above the surface of the\r\n     basin. Now early travellers talk of three hundred feet, which must,\r\n     of course, be fabulous; but many trustworthy persons have judged\r\n     the eruptions at two hundred feet, while well-authenticated\r\n     accounts--when the elevation of the jet has been actually\r\n     measured--make it to have attained a height of upward of one\r\n     hundred feet.'\r\n\r\nSuch are the peculiar characteristics of the Geysers of Iceland,\r\ndiffering in almost every essential point from the hot springs, so\r\ncalled, in California. We propose to show that the phenomena of the\r\nDevil's Canon appear in other parts of the world in connection with some\r\nknown volcano, which has at some period in history been in active\r\noperation, and that there is strong reason to believe that they can be\r\nexplained by the sinking of cold water into the earth, in a country rich\r\nin salts and minerals, and encountering a volcanic focus, from which the\r\nwater is discharged hot and strongly impregnated with the salts through\r\nwhich it has passed. It was Humboldt's opinion that hot springs\r\ngenerally originated thus, for he says in 'Kosmos':\r\n\r\n     'A very striking proof of the origin of hot springs by the sinking\r\n     of cold meteoric water into the earth, and by its contact with a\r\n     volcanic focus, is afforded by the volcano of Jorullo. When, in\r\n     September, 1759, Jorullo was suddenly elevated into a mountain\r\n     eleven hundred and eighty-three feet above the surrounding plain,\r\n     two small rivers, the Rio de Cuitimba and the Rio de San Pedro,\r\n     disappeared, and some time afterward burst forth again during\r\n     violent shocks of an earthquake, as hot springs, whose temperature\r\n     I found, in 1803, to be 186.4 deg. Fahr.'\r\n\r\nThe most marked characteristics of the springs of the Devil's Canon are,\r\nthe small space in which they are all contained; the profusion and\r\nvariety of mineral salts, and the proximity of different minerals,\r\nalmost flowing into each other, but never mingling; the number and\r\ndifferent forces of the steam jets on every side; and the remarkable\r\nappearance of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe approach to the Devil's Canon is through a section of country\r\nbearing evident traces of volcanic action, and rich in mineral springs,\r\nof which the most important are those of the Napa Valley. First among\r\nthese, at the greatest distance from the volcano (if we may be allowed\r\nto call it so), is the soda spring of Napa, a cold spring, greatly\r\nresembling in flavor the water of the Congress Spring at Saratoga.\r\nPassing up the Napa Valley, we find a tepid sulphur spring near St.\r\nHellon's, known as the 'White Sulphur Spring,' being strongly\r\nimpregnated with that mineral, and tasting much like the famous 'White\r\nSulphur' of Virginia. Its waters, however, are slightly warm, and,\r\nalthough stronger than those of the 'Warm Springs' of the Blue Ridge, a\r\nbasin as clear and buoyant as that could easily be made.\r\n\r\nThis spring is owned by Mr. Alstrom, of the Lick House, at San\r\nFrancisco, and, being in a charming valley, is fast becoming the most\r\npopular watering place on the Pacific coast. About twelve miles beyond\r\nthe Sulphur Springs are the 'Hot Springs,' which resemble the\r\ndescription just given of the Icelandic Geysers--the little\r\ngeysera--there being the same quaking bog around them, which emits steam\r\nto the tread, and the surface being scabby, like an old salt meadow\r\nunder a midsummer sun. These waters are scalding hot, but are pure,\r\nexcepting a trace of iron. If they have been analyzed, the writer has\r\nnot seen the results.\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Canon lies about fifteen miles beyond the Hot Springs, and\r\nin the heart of a wild, mountainous country, difficult of access, and\r\nbarren of vegetation, except of the most hardy character, such as the\r\nmanzanita and Californian oak. Molten mercury, pure and rich, is found\r\nin the crevices of the rocks. Quartz and basalt are freely met with, and\r\non Geyser Peak disintegrating lava.\r\n\r\nHere the road attains an elevation of three thousand feet, and on either\r\nhand are broad and fertile valleys, with rivers winding through them,\r\nthe Russian River valley and the Napa being the most beautiful beneath,\r\nwhile before us are gorges and barren hills, that rise above each other\r\nin picturesque confusion.\r\n\r\nThe first view of the Devil's Canon is obtained from one of these\r\ndesolate hills. At our very feet, fully two thousand feet below,\r\nseemingly a sheer descent, rises a little column of smoke or vapor, and\r\nthe opposing hills, which rise abruptly to the height of a thousand\r\nfeet, seem cleft by a narrow chasm, the sides of which and the\r\nneighboring hillside seem to have been burnt over by fire, and baked of\r\nmany colors, like the neighborhood of an old brick kiln. Any one who has\r\nseen the island of St. Helena will at once recognize it as the same\r\nphenomenon which is famous in the 'Hangings,' the blasted precipice by\r\nthe side of Longwood Farm, overhanging the valley which Napoleon chose\r\nfor his last resting place. This striking similarity is all the more\r\nworthy of note from its occurring there in a purely volcanic island,\r\nevery inch of which is decomposed or crumbling lava or lava rock. At the\r\n'Hangings' the soil has the appearance of having been slowly roasted,\r\nlong after the central fires which produced the island had lost their\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nDescending the mountain we find ourselves on the brink of a precipice,\r\noverhanging a turbulent stream about two hundred feet below, and facing\r\nthe ravine or canon, which contains these wonders, and which is smoking\r\nincessantly throughout its entire length.\r\n\r\nJust at this commanding point a hotel has been erected, from the portico\r\nof which in the early morning we can watch the grand columns of vapor\r\nopposite, before they are shorn of a portion of their splendor by the\r\nrising sun.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to walk the entire length of the ravine, surrounded by\r\njets of steam, and little bubbling springs of mineral water; some\r\nhissing, some sputtering, others roaring, and others shrieking; the\r\nground being soft and hot, your stick sinking into the clayey ooze, and\r\na puff of spiteful steam following it as withdrawn; your shoes white or\r\nyellow, as you tread the chalk or the sulphur banks, and your feet\r\nburning with the hot breath of the sulphur blasts below.\r\n\r\nIf you are not stifled by the sulphur fumes above, be thankful; and when\r\nat last you reach the 'Mountain of Fire' at the head of the ravine, and\r\nlook back upon the perils of your upward journey, you think of poor\r\nChristian in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Bunyan in his dreams\r\nnever imagined a more horrible place.\r\n\r\nIt is a vale of wonders--Nature's laboratory, where chemistry is to be\r\nstudied. The name and number of the springs is 'legion,' Hot Sulphur,\r\nWarm Sulphur, Blue Sulphur, White Sulphur, Alum, Salt, and nobody knows\r\nall the mineral compounds. You may stand with one foot in a cold bath\r\nand another in a hot one--if you can. With one hand you may dip up alum\r\nwater, as bitter and pure as chemistry can compound it, and with the\r\nother sulphur water, that shall sicken your very soul. If you have\r\nrheumatism, bathe in the splendid sulphur baths or the Indian Spring; if\r\nyour eyes are weak, use the eye-water, which beats any ever charmed by\r\nmagical incantations.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this ravine, into which so many springs are emptying\r\nthemselves, is a little stream, which, starting from the head of the\r\ncanon quite cool and pure, receives all their mingled waters, and\r\ngradually increases in heat and abominable taste, until at last it\r\ndefies description.\r\n\r\nIts stones and the rocks that line its banks, owing probably to the\r\nprotection of the cooler water, are tolerably firm in texture, all other\r\nparts of the ravine being burned to a powder which crumbles in the hand,\r\nor, when mixed with water, forms an ooze or clay. Many of these stones\r\nby the sides of this little stream are banded with colors like the\r\nPictured Rocks of Lake Superior (to compare great things with small),\r\nand probably from the same cause. These beautiful cliffs, the\r\nSchwee-archibi-kung of the Indians, are colored by percolations of\r\nsurface-water, by which the coloring matter of various minerals and\r\nacids is brought to the face of the precipice, and it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the drainage of the mountains behind the Devil's Canon,\r\nsinking to similar beds of minerals, is thrown out by the volcano below\r\nin the shape of steam or mineral springs. It is impossible to drill a\r\nhole two feet deep in the side of the ravine without provoking a little\r\njet of steam. Now, Daubeny, who is the highest authority on volcanoes,\r\nstates that the greater part of their ascending vapor is mere steam, and\r\nthat in 'Pantellaria (a volcanic island near Sicily) steam issues from\r\nmany parts of this insular mountain, and hot springs gush forth from it\r\nwhich form together a lake six thousand feet in circumference.'\r\n\r\nSimilar jets of steam and hot water are observed at St. Lucia, near the\r\ncrater Oalibou, where also there is a continual formation of sulphur\r\nfrom the condensation of the vapors, a phenomenon which is lavishly\r\ndisplayed in the Devil's Canon, and in fact around most known volcanoes.\r\nThe writer observed it fully two miles from the active volcano of\r\nKilawea, forming a fine sulphur bed, and a body of steam so dense that\r\nrheumatic natives of Hawaii were in the habit of using it as a vapor\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nThe jets of steam in the canon are of the most curious variety. One,\r\nhonored by the name of the 'Devil's Steamboat,' is quite a formidable\r\naffair, high up on the hillside, and puffing uninterruptedly, and so\r\npowerfully that the steam is invisible for at least five feet from the\r\nvent. The ground about it is too soft to permit approach, and the heat\r\ntoo great to tempt it. On a frosty morning, just before sunrise, it is a\r\nfine sight. This, however, is only one of hundreds. It would be imagined\r\nthat if they all came from the same source, they would puff in some sort\r\nof unison--that the beatings of the mighty heart below would be felt\r\nsimultaneously in every pulse; but the fact is quite the reverse. No\r\ntune or concord is preserved by any two in the canon; one moves with the\r\nquiet regularity of respiration, while the next is puffing with the\r\nnervous anxiety of a little high-pressure tug boat. It affords endless\r\namusement to listen to their endless variety of complaint; some are\r\nrestless, some spiteful, and some angry, while others sound as merrily\r\nas a teakettle, or beat a jolly 'rub-a-dub,' 'rataplan,' that makes a\r\nman's soul merry to hear. In fact, there is a little retreat just out of\r\nthe canon, styled the Devil's Kitchen, where the pot and the saucepan,\r\nthe gridiron and the teakettle are visible to men gifted with\r\nimaginations strong enough to grasp the unseen.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of the canon, which has given it the unmerited name of\r\n'Geyser,' is the Witches' Caldron, a small cavity in the hillside,\r\nseemingly running back into the hill at an angle of forty-five degrees,\r\nfilled with villanous black mud in unceasing commotion.\r\n\r\nHow different from the pellucid basin of the Great Geyser! Lord Dufferin\r\ntells us that he '_brewed his coffee_ in the Geyser water.'\r\n\r\nThe mud boils like the angry lava-waves of a volcano; it is always of a\r\nvery high temperature, and occasionally runs over the rim of the basin,\r\nbut never rises violently into the air. It looks like black sulphur\r\n(bitumen), and has a brimstone smell. Certainly it is a diabolical pit,\r\nand worth coming far to see, but it shows none of the phenomena which\r\ntempt travellers to Iceland.\r\n\r\nIt more closely resembles the salses or mud volcanoes of Central and\r\nSouth America, and is a phenomenon very common on the sides of\r\nvolcanoes. As far back as the time of Pliny it was observed that 'in\r\nSicily eruptions of wet mud precede the glowing (lava) stream.'\r\n\r\nHumboldt recognizes in the 'salses, or small mud volcanoes, a transition\r\nfrom the changing phenomena presented by the eruptions of vapor and\r\nthermal springs, to the more powerful and awful activity of the streams\r\nof lava that flow from volcanic mountains.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the recent discovery of the Devil's Canon in California makes\r\nit impossible to say at what time, if ever, this smothered volcano may\r\nhave been more active, we have accounts of analogous phenomena in\r\nCentral America and San Salvador, in the Ausoles of Ahuachapan, near the\r\nvolcano of Izalco, which were described in 1576 by Licenciado Palacio,\r\nand also in what was called the 'Infernillo,' on the side of the volcano\r\nof San Vicente, which was mentioned by the Spanish _Conquistadores_. We\r\nalso know something of the subsequent history of these volcanoes; for M.\r\nArago has remarked that\r\n\r\n     'The volcano of Izalco is extremely active. Among its eruptions may\r\n     be cited those of 1798, 1805, 1807, and 1825. On the occasion of\r\n     the last eruption the course of the river Tequisquillo was altered\r\n     to the extent of several kilometres.'\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n     'The volcano of San Vicente, called also Sacatecoluca, was\r\n     distinguished in 1643 by a very violent eruption which covered all\r\n     the surrounding country with ashes and sulphur. In January, 1835, a\r\n     new eruption of this volcano destroyed many towns and villages.'\r\n\r\nNow let us see what old Palacio says of the springs on the side of this\r\nfearful volcano of Izalco:\r\n\r\n     'The springs, which the Indians call 'Hell,' are all within the\r\n     space of a gunshot across, and each makes a different noise. One\r\n     imitates the sound of a fuller's mill; another that of a forge, and\r\n     a third a man snoring. The water in some is turbid; in some clear;\r\n     in others red, yellow, and various colors. They all leave deposits\r\n     of corresponding colors. Collectively the springs form the Rio\r\n     Caliente, running underground for a quarter of a league, and so hot\r\n     on reaching the surface as to take the skin off a man's feet.\r\n     Double the range of a musket shot from these springs are others,\r\n     which flow from a rock fifteen feet long by nine feet broad, split\r\n     in the centre, sending out with water columns of smoke and steam,\r\n     with a fearful sound, distinguishable for half a league.'\r\n\r\nA later visitor has given an account of the same springs, which may be\r\nthus condensed:\r\n\r\n     'Not far from Apaneca and in the vicinity of the town of\r\n     Ahuachapan, are some remarkable thermal springs, called _Ausoles_.\r\n     They emit a dense white steam from a semi-fluid mass of mud and\r\n     water in a state of ebullition, which continually throws off large\r\n     and heavy bubbles. [The mud bubbles of the Witches' Caldron are\r\n     quite as extraordinary.] They occupy a considerable space, the\r\n     largest not less than one hundred yards in circumference. In this\r\n     one the water is exceedingly turbid, of a light brown color, and\r\n     boils furiously. The waters in the other caldrons vary in color,\r\n     and form deposits of the finest clay of every shade. Steam ascends\r\n     in a dense white cloud, shutting out the sun; the ground is all\r\n     hot, soon becoming insupportable. In places a little jet of steam\r\n     and smoke rises fiercely from a hole in the hills, while in others\r\n     boiling water rushes out as if forced from a steam engine. The\r\n     water possesses varying mineral qualities.\r\n\r\n     'All these springs are on the side of the volcano Apaneca, one of a\r\n     cluster of which Izalco is the most active, and Santa Anna the\r\n     mother volcano.'\r\n\r\nThese accounts would be equally correct if applied to the Devil's Canon;\r\nbut the following appears to surpass it in the power of the volcano\r\nbelow. It is condensed from a description by the same traveller, whose\r\nname cannot be ascertained:\r\n\r\n     'On the north side of the volcano of San Vicente (a water volcano\r\n     occupying the geographical centre of San Salvador, seven thousand\r\n     feet above the sea), at the head of a considerable ravine, and near\r\n     the base of the mountain, is a place called 'El Infernillo.'\r\n\r\n     'For the space of several hundred yards, rills of hot water spring\r\n     from the ground, which looks red and burned, and there are numerous\r\n     orifices sending out spires of steam with a fierce vigor like the\r\n     escape of a steam engine. The principal discharge is from an\r\n     orifice thirty feet broad, opening beneath a ledge of igneous\r\n     rocks, nearly on a level with the bottom of the ravine. Smoke,\r\n     steam, and hot water are sent out with incredible velocity for a\r\n     distance of forty yards, as if from a force pump, with a roar as of\r\n     a furnace in full blast. The noise is intermittent (although never\r\n     ceasing entirely) and as regular as respiration. All around are\r\n     salts, crystallized sulphur, and deposits of clay of every shade.\r\n     There is no vegetation in the vicinity, and the stream for a mile\r\n     is too hot for the hand to bear.'\r\n\r\nSuch a striking similarity in phenomena at so great a distance apart, in\r\nconnection with active or dormant volcanoes, would seem to be enough to\r\nprove the connection in any candid mind, and utterly refute the idle\r\ntheory that all this heat may be produced by the chemical action of\r\nwater on beds of sulphates or phosphates just below the surface. The\r\ntemperature of the water should be sufficient to show that it comes from\r\ngreat depths. The writer was unable, from want of a thermometer, to\r\nverify the temperatures of the various springs in the Devil's Canon, but\r\nwas told that they average 201 deg., and as most of them were boiling, it\r\nappeared not to be far from the truth. Since Arago discovered, in 1821,\r\nthat the deepest artesian wells were the hottest, it has been observed\r\nthat the hottest springs are the purest; and from their geological\r\nsurroundings, many are proved to come from great depths. The Aguas\r\nCalientes de las Trincheras, near Puerto Cabello, issue from _granite_,\r\nat a temperature of 206 deg.; the Aguas de Comaugillas, near Guanaxuato,\r\nfrom _basalt_, at 205 deg.. To more fully establish the volcanic origin of\r\nthe phenomena of California and Central America, if such a thing were\r\nnecessary, it can, however, be shown that similar phenomena are found\r\naround the crater of a volcano in _actual eruption_.\r\n\r\nA graphic account of 'White Island,' in the South Pacific, from the pen\r\nof Captain Cracroft, R. N., who visited it with the Governor of New\r\nZealand, in H. M. S. Niger, speaks of boiling springs, 'geysers,' and\r\nsteam-escapes, in connection with a very remarkable active volcano.\r\n\r\nAs very few are acquainted with this singular island, his description of\r\nhis visit is given in full:\r\n\r\n                                          'Sunday, _January_ 15, 1862.\r\n\r\n     'This morning we were well inside the Bay of Plenty, and as the\r\n     wind declined to a calm, I got steam up, and stood for White\r\n     Island, on which there is a volcano in active operation. The white\r\n     cloud of smoke that always hovers over it was in sight before eight\r\n     o'clock, in shape like a huge palm tree, and at eleven o'clock, H.\r\n     E., the governor, gladly accompanied me ashore, with all the\r\n     officers of the ship that could be spared from duty.\r\n\r\n     'As we approached the island, its aspect was of the most singular\r\n     and forbidding description. Except on its northern face, to which\r\n     the sulphurous vapor does not appear to reach, it is utterly\r\n     destitute of vegetation: here and there are a few patches of\r\n     underwood; but in every other direction the island is bald, bleak,\r\n     and furrowed into countless deep-worn ravines. The centre of the\r\n     island has been hollowed out by the crater of the volcano into a\r\n     capacious basin, almost circular, and, excepting to the south,\r\n     where there is a huge cleft or rent, its sides or edges rise almost\r\n     perpendicular full eight hundred feet from the base. After some\r\n     trouble, carefully backing in with the swell, a landing was\r\n     effected on the south side, when a most extraordinary sight was\r\n     displayed to our view. Before us, in the hollow of the basin, was a\r\n     lake of yellow liquid, smoking hot, about a hundred yards in\r\n     diameter, as near as could be guessed. Around this, but chiefly\r\n     toward the north side, were numerous jets of steam spouting out of\r\n     the ground. A strong sulphurous smell pervaded the atmosphere, and\r\n     warned us what was to be expected from a nearer proximity to the\r\n     crater in active operation at the farther end of the lake, to\r\n     which, nothing daunted by its appearance, our party was determined\r\n     to penetrate. Our advance was made cautiously; the surface of the\r\n     ground was in some places soft and yielding, and we knew not to\r\n     what brimstone depths an unwary step might sink us. There were\r\n     little ravines to be crossed, which had to be first carefully\r\n     sounded. As we proceeded on the soft, crustaceous surface,\r\n     diminutive spouts of vapor would spit forth, as if to resent our\r\n     intrusion. In skirting the edge of the lake, its temperature and\r\n     taste were both tested; the former varied with the distance from\r\n     the seething bubbling going on at the extremity; in some places the\r\n     hand could be kept in, but 130 deg. was the highest registered, without\r\n     risk to the thermometer, by Mr. Lawrenson, assistant surgeon: the\r\n     taste may be imagined, but not described!\r\n\r\n     'Continuing our advance, the roaring and hissing became louder and\r\n     louder, as though a hundred locomotives were all blowing off\r\n     together, while the steam from the crater and numerous geysers\r\n     surrounding it was emitted in huge volumes, ascending full two\r\n     thousand feet in the air. Most fortunately it was a perfect calm,\r\n     or the fumes of the sulphur would alone have sufficed to stop our\r\n     progress; but there was also every reason to believe, judging from\r\n     the description I have by me of a former visit, that the volcano\r\n     was to-day in a more quiescent state than usual. Everywhere sulphur\r\n     was strewed around, and we had only to enlarge any of the vapor\r\n     holes to obtain it in its pure crystallized state. We were now\r\n     within a few yards of the crater--huge bubbles of boiling mud were\r\n     rising several feet from the surface of the lake--the heat and\r\n     sulphurous vapor were almost insupportable; it was evident that no\r\n     animal life could long exist here. But before leaving this caldron,\r\n     one of the mids, more venturous than the rest, climbed up a small,\r\n     semi-detached hill, and his example being followed, we beheld a\r\n     scene that beggars all description. In full activity a roaring\r\n     fountain shot up into the scorching atmosphere: we deemed this to\r\n     be molten sulphur, but no flame was visible in the daylight; stones\r\n     were thrown in, but they were projected into the air as high as the\r\n     ship's mast-heads. It was a sight never to be forgotten; and we\r\n     retraced our steps to the boats with the satisfaction of having\r\n     been permitted to make a closer examination of this grand natural\r\n     curiosity than any previous visitor. We saw no indication of either\r\n     animal or insect life, and it is not likely that any can exist on\r\n     this island. On the beach, which was composed of large bowlders,\r\n     lay the bones of an enormous whale, and a couple of whale birds\r\n     hovered round the boats as they pulled back to the ship.'\r\n\r\nHere we have an account agreeing in every respect, as far as it goes,\r\nwith the appearance of the desolate valley known as 'Geyser Canon,' the\r\nsame 'burnt-out' look of the land, the same jets of steam, large and\r\nsmall, and boiling caldrons of mud.\r\n\r\n'The surface of the soil was soft and yielding,' according to the\r\ngallant captain, and the punching of a stick called out spiteful little\r\njets of steam. It is to be regretted, however, that the observant\r\nofficer does not acquaint us with the taste of the waters. Probably one\r\nswallow was enough for him, if it was sulphur water; and he does not\r\neven tell us that, so that it is impossible to say whether the numerous\r\nkinds of salts noticed in California are to be traced here. His\r\ntestimony is explicit that these 'geysers' occur on the sides of a great\r\nvolcano.[7]\r\n\r\nThus, in conclusion, it will be seen how a comparison of all the\r\nphenomena occurring in the 'Devil's Canon'--where, without any other\r\npositive proof, we suspect the existence of a deep-seated volcano--with\r\nsimilar thermal springs and jets of steam on the sides of known\r\nvolcanoes, in many and distant parts of the world, either now or at some\r\nrecorded time in active operation, drives us irresistibly to the\r\ninference that the so-called 'Geysers' are of similar origin, and only\r\nanother manifestation of the dormant energies of the interior of our\r\nglobe; now bursting out in lava flames, as on Hecla or Vesuvius, and now\r\nmildly presenting us with a tepid bath.\r\n\r\nAs to the name of geyser being applied to the Californian phenomena, we\r\nprotest against it. A true geyser is a natural hydraulic machine of\r\nmagnificent power; it is a spring, to be sure, but a mineral spring is\r\nnot necessarily a geyser, and there is as much difference between the\r\n'Geysers of California' and the Strokr or the 'Great Geyser,' as there\r\nis between a squib and a musket-shot. Call the springs AUSOLES, if you\r\nplease, like their counterparts of Ahuachapan, or 'give the devil his\r\ndue,' and call the place as it was called by its discoverer.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S CANON is not a bad name for such a diabolical, sulphurous,\r\nhot, and altogether infernal den.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Said the pleader to the judge, 'If there is any one thing which,\r\nmore than any other thing, proves the thing, this thing is that thing!'\r\n'Which thing?' said the judge to the pleader.\r\n\r\n[7] White Island is in the Bay of Plenty, not far from Auckland, the\r\ngovernment seat of New Zealand, on the more northerly of the two islands\r\nforming the group. According to Mr. George French Angas, whose Travels\r\nin New Zealand are quoted In Dicken's _Household Words_ for October 19,\r\n1850, the neighboring mainland (if the word may be applied to the\r\nprincipal inland) abounds in hot springs of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\nMr. Angas says:\r\n\r\n'I visited the boiling springs which issue from the side of a steep\r\nmountain, called Te Rapa. There were nearly one hundred of them; they\r\nburst out, bubbling from little orifices in the ground, which are not\r\nmore than a few inches in diameter, the steam rushes out in clouds with\r\nconsiderable force: the hillside is covered with them, and a river of\r\nhot water runs down into the lake. The soil around is a red-and-white\r\nclay, strongly impregnated with sulphur and hydrogen gas; pyrites also\r\noccur. Several women were busy cooking baskets of potatoes over some of\r\nthe smaller orifices: leaves and ferns were laid over the holes, upon\r\nwhich the food was placed. They were capitally done.\r\n\r\n'About two miles from this place, on the edge of a great swampy flat, I\r\nmet with a number of boiling ponds; some of them of very large\r\ndimensions. We forded a river flowing swiftly toward the lake, which is\r\nfed by the snows melting in the valleys of the Tongariro. In many\r\nplaces, in the bed of this river, the water boils up from the\r\nsubterranean springs below, suddenly changing the temperature of the\r\nstream, to the imminent risk of the individual who may be crossing.\r\nAlong whole tracts of land I heard the water boiling violently beneath\r\nthe crust over which I was treading. It is very dangerous travelling,\r\nfor, if the crust should break, scalding to death must ensue. I am told\r\nthat the Rotuma natives, who build their houses over the hot springs in\r\nthat district, for the sake of constant warmth at night, frequently meet\r\nwith accidents of this kind: it has happened that when a party has been\r\ndancing on the floor, the crust has given way, and the convivial\r\nassembly has been suddenly swallowed up in the boiling caldron beneath!\r\nSome of the ponds are ninety feet in circumference, filled with a\r\ntransparent pale-blue boiling water, sending up columns of steam.\r\nChannels of boiling water run along the ground in every direction, and\r\nthe surface of this calcareous flat around the margin of the boiling\r\nponds covered with beautiful incrustations of lime and alum, in some\r\nparts forming flat saucer-like figures. Husk of maize, moss, and\r\nbranches of vegetable substances were incrusted in the same manner. I\r\nalso observed small deep holes, or wells, here and there among the grass\r\nand rushes, from two inches to as many feet in diameter, filled with\r\nboiling mud, that rises in large bubbles as thick as hasty pudding;\r\nthese mud pits sent up a strong sulphureous smell. Although the ponds\r\nboiled violently, I noticed small flies walking swiftly, or rather\r\nrunning on their surface.\r\n\r\nThe steam that rises from these boiling springs is visible for many\r\nmiles, appearing like the jets of a number of steam engines.'--Vol. ii.,\r\npp. 113, 114, 115.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLY LEAVES FROM THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER.\r\n\r\nPART I.--SCALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were in the _three_-months.\r\n\r\nThere! I feel as proud of that as one of the Old Guard would have been\r\nin saying: 'I was of the Army of Italy.'\r\n\r\nThere is but one _three_-months (pronounced with the accent strongly\r\nresting on the numeral adverb, after the Hibernian). All others are\r\nspurious imitations. I refer to the early days of the war: the dark days\r\nthat followed the first fall of Sumter, when our Southern friends had\r\njust finished the last volume of the lexicon of slavery, that for so\r\nlong a time had defined away our manhood, our national honor, and our\r\nbirthright of freedom, with such terrible words as 'coercion,'\r\n'secession,' 'fratricidal war,' 'sovereign States,' and what not; before\r\nwe had begun to look without fear even at the title page of the new\r\nGospel of Liberty: the days when we were mudsills and greasy mechanics,\r\nwhose pockets were to be touched: the days, in short, when we were still\r\ninclined to crawl upon our bellies, from the preference arising out of\r\nlong and strong habit. Then, you remember, the rebellion was to be\r\ncrushed in sixty days. So the President issued his proclamation, of date\r\nthe 15th of April, A. D. 1861 (and of the independence of the United\r\nStates the _first_), calling out SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND men for ninety\r\ndays to do it.\r\n\r\nOn the same day we were mustered into the service as a part of this\r\ngigantic force of seventy-five thousand, at the bare suggestion of whose\r\nnumbers the refractory South was confidently expected to abandon its\r\nrash enterprise, and kindly resume its sway over us. Before the awful\r\nceremony known as 'mustering in,' we were sixty odd excited young\r\ngentlemen, hailing from and residing in all parts of the country. After\r\nit we were Company N, commanded by Captain John H. Pipes, of the First\r\nRegiment of District of Columbia Volunteers, commanded by Colonel\r\nCharles Diamond, as the muster rolls called us, or the 'American\r\nSharpshooters,' as we called ourselves.\r\n\r\nMajor McDuff mustered us in. He did it after this fashion: First he\r\nwalked out into the yard of the War Department, where the company stood\r\nat 'parade rest,' or the nearest militia approach thereto, waiting to be\r\nabsorbed. Then he had us marched across the yard and halted; then up it;\r\nthen down it; then back to the first position; then forward in a line a\r\nfew paces; then, by the right flank, into the back yard, where he left,\r\nus, at a 'rest,' for two hours and fifty-three minutes, while he retired\r\ninto the War Department building, probably to ascertain if the thing was\r\nregular. Then, at the fifty-fourth minute, or thereabout, after the\r\nsecond hour, he caused us to be marched into our original position.\r\nAfter gazing at us uneasily for a few minutes, he proceeded to inspect\r\nour arms with the utmost care: the importance of which manoeuvre will\r\nmore fully appear from the fact that they intended to take us, and did\r\ntake many of us, _sans_ lock, stock, or barrel. Then he told us that we\r\nwere--called into the--service--of the--United States--for--three\r\nmonths--to serve in the District--not to go beyond the District--under\r\nany circumstances. Then he called the roll, so accurately (never having\r\nseen it before) that nearly all of us recognized our names, and in\r\nhardly more than two and three quarters the time it would have taken the\r\norderly sergeant to do it. Then we were told to hold up our right hands,\r\nand a stout party, well known to all early volunteers, stepped forward\r\nfrom wherever he had been before, and, introducing himself by\r\nexclaiming, in solemn and cavernous tones, 'THE FOLLOWING IS THE OATH!'\r\nswore us in. Then, after another short adjournment of half an hour, we\r\nwere marched to our barracks.\r\n\r\nThat was a queer organization, the 1st D.C. Vols., composed as it was of\r\na cloud of independent companies--thirty-five, or thereabout, in all, I\r\nthink--all made up of men from everywhere, largely in the tadpole stage\r\nof Unionism, and all sworn in for service in the District, not to go\r\nbeyond the District. Early in May they were organized into eight\r\nbattalions of four or five companies each, commanded by\r\nlieutenant-colonels, majors, or the senior captains. Nearly every\r\ncompany occupied its own separate 'armory' or barracks, and all the\r\nofficers and men lived at home when not actually on guard or other duty!\r\n\r\nIt was an awful feeling that sandwiched the gaps of new-born exultation\r\nat finding ourselves real soldiers--that feeling of a merged identity;\r\nthe individual Smith sold for glory at $11 per mensem, and lost, lost in\r\nan aggregate: become only a cog in a little machine connected with a\r\nlarger machine that forms part of the great machine called an army. One\r\nthing saved us the full horror of this discovery: we were not bothered\r\nwith corps, divisions, brigades, or even greatly with regiments, in\r\nthose days, and if individually we were ciphers or merely recurring\r\ndecimals, collectively 'our company' was of the first importance; and\r\nthis reflection stiffened the breasts of our gray frock coats, and\r\ncaused our scales (we wore scales!) to shine again.\r\n\r\n_First night_. Everybody wants to be on guard! Think of that, old\r\nsoldiers, and grin. The captain details twice as many as are necessary,\r\nto prevent clamor. Some of the more enthusiastic of the disappointed\r\nones offer to stay at the armory all night, to be on hand in case of\r\nanything happening. We can never be certain about the enemy's crossing\r\nthe Long Bridge, you know. The company, guard and all, is drilled\r\nvigorously, in squads, for two hours. Then the unhappy fellows who are\r\nto go home loiter themselves, with many wistful glances, out of the\r\nbuilding. Then the guard plays euchre, reads, reads aloud, sings,\r\nfences, and drills. A few sleepy heads lie down in corners about one\r\nA.M., and are not going to sleep, but nevertheless shortly complain of\r\nbeing kept awake by the noise. 'Never mind,' growls the melancholy man\r\nof the company; 'won't hear any of this to-morrow night. D----d glad to\r\ngo to sleep then.' The melancholy man, now as hereafter, is voted a\r\nbore, but, as I presently discover, turns out to be pretty nearly right,\r\nand achieves the sad triumph of being able to say, 'Told you so;\r\nwouldn't believe me; now see.'--Daylight. No one has been asleep, yet,\r\nstrange to say, everyone has waked up and found everyone else snoring.\r\nNo one waits for _reveille_, this first morning. You stretch yourself,\r\nand endeavor to rise. Which is you, and which the board floor? You\r\nrather think this must be you that has just got up, because it aches so\r\ndown the grain, and its knots or eyes--yes, they are eyes--are so full\r\nof sand. This must be how Rip Van Winkle felt after his nap in the\r\nCatskills, you think. You wonder how those fellows Boyce and Tripp can\r\nskylark so on an empty stomach. Three hours to breakfast. You police the\r\nquarters with vigor. 'Heavens, what a dust! Open the windows, somebody;\r\nand look here, Sergeant! the floor hasn't been sprinkled.' The sharp,\r\nquick tones of the sergeant of the guard (more like the sound of a\r\ntenpenny nail scratching mahogany than aught else in nature) soon set\r\nmatters right. You think you have surely swallowed your peck of dirt\r\nthat morning, and feel even more gastric than you usually do on an empty\r\nstomach. You can go home to breakfast now: but you hear Johnny Todd's\r\ncheery voice sing out; 'Fall in, cocktail squad!' and march off with a\r\nscore of your comrades to the nearest restaurant, which, finding just\r\nopen, the squad incontinently takes possession of. You take a cocktail,\r\na whiskey cocktail, with the edge of the green glass previously lemoned\r\nand dipped in powdered sugar. 'Ah,' says Todd to everybody, and\r\neverybody, to everybody else, including Todd, 'that goes to the right\r\nplace' (slapping it affectionately). Oh, reader, if wearer of p[)a]hnts,\r\ndid you ever meet with a decoction, infusion, or other mixture\r\nwhatsoever, vinous, alcoholic, or maltic, with or without sugar, that\r\ndid _not_ go to the right place? And if there was a fault, wasn't it in\r\nthe addition of a trifle too much lemon peel? The crowd takes another of\r\nthe same sort. You take another. Then you wish you hadn't.\r\n\r\nYou go to the office that day, for, in common with two-thirds of the\r\ncompany, you are a clerk in one of the Departments as well as a soldier;\r\nand you can think and talk of nothing but the war. The oldsters quiz\r\nyour enthusiasm unmercifully, and cause your complexion to assume a red\r\nand gobbling appearance, and your conversation to limp into\r\nhalf-incoherent feebleness. Nevertheless everyone is very kind to you,\r\nfor you are a great pet with the old fogies--their prize 'Jack;' and\r\neven old Mr. Gruff rasps down his tones, so that those harsh accents\r\nseem to pat you on the back. Your handwriting, usually so firm and easy,\r\nquavers a little, and exhibits more of the influence of the biceps\r\nmuscle than of your accustomed light play of the wrist and fingers. But,\r\nyou think, it's the rifle that does it, and are rather proud of this.\r\n\r\n_Second night._ You rush down after an early dinner, in rash anxiety to\r\nbe drilled. Arriving very red and hot at the armory, you find bales of\r\nstraw and boxes on the sidewalk in front, and hear dreadful rumors that\r\nour armory is to be taken away; that we are to have regular barracks,\r\nand live there all the time; that we are to draw rations, and cook them.\r\nDismay is on every face. The melancholy man alone seems not to be\r\njostled from his habitual sad composure: he explains to the inquiring,\r\ndoubting crowd that the ration consists of 'one and a quarter pounds of\r\nfresh beef or three quarters of a pound of salt beef, pork, or bacon,\r\nfourteen ounces of flour or twelve ounces of hard bread, with eight\r\npounds of coffee, ten of sugar, ten of rice or eight quarts of beans,\r\nfour quarts of vinegar, four pounds of soap, one and a quarter pounds\r\ncandles, and two quarts of salt, to the hundred rations. But you won't\r\nget fresh meat often, nor yet flour, and I reckon you'll have to take\r\nbeans instead of rice pretty much all the time, now't South Car'lina's\r\nout.' _We_ eat salt pork! or beans either, except very occasionally.\r\nThere began to be serious symptoms of mutiny. Fippany and one or two\r\nothers declaimed so violently against the outrage, that the more\r\nenthusiastic of us felt bound to use our influence to prevent the spread\r\nof a disaffection that seemed to us highly calculated to embarrass the\r\naction of the Government in this crisis. The end of it was that we\r\nmarched up to our new quarters, and, in the excitement of moving in and\r\nreceiving our clothing and camp and garrison equipage, had forgotten our\r\ntroubles, when (just as the melancholy man discovered that the overcoats\r\nwere seven short of the right number, that the mess pans all leaked, and\r\nthat the quarters were full of fleas) our orders to move were\r\ncountermanded, and we marched back again in joy. There were fewer\r\nvolunteers for guard duty that night, and the natural rest of the\r\nsergeant of the guard was undisturbed save by the occasional nightmare\r\nof having overslept the hour for relieving the meek sentinels (not yet\r\ninstructed in the art of awakening drowsy non-commissioned officers by\r\nstentorian alarms, and indeed not yet knowing accurately the measure of\r\ntheir 'two hours on'), or by some louder howl than usual from poor Todd\r\nsecond, who, having continued his course of eye-opening to the hours\r\nwhen sober citizens and prudent soldiers incline to close theirs, spent\r\nthe major portion of the night in dramatic recitations of the beauties\r\nof Shakspeare, utterly neglecting and refusing to 'dry up,' although\r\nfrequently admonished thereto by the growls and eke by the curses of his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon and evening, including in the latter elastic term\r\nmany hours more properly claimed by the night, were spent in confused\r\nand bungling attempts to issue the clothing and camp and garrison\r\nequipage considerately provided for us by the Government. First\r\neverybody opened all the boxes at once, and grabbed for everything. Then\r\neverybody put his things back and petitioned for somebody else's. 'My\r\novercoat is too big.' 'Mine is too short.' 'Golly! what sleeves!' 'What\r\nare these bags for?' 'Those things knapsacks! how you goin' to fassen\r\n'em? no straps!' 'My canteen has no cork.' ... '_Silence_!' roars the\r\ncaptain, and '=Silence!=' rasps the orderly sergeant, three times as\r\nloudly and six as disagreeably. And then everybody being ordered to\r\nreplace everything, that a proper system of distribution may be adopted,\r\nhalf of us hide our plunder away, and the other half dump their prizes\r\npromiscuously and in sullenness. 'Here, here!' barks Sergeant Files;\r\n'this kind of thing's played out. There were sixty-five canteens;\r\nwhere's the other sixty?' Presently the confusion unravels a little,\r\nbut, after a breathing spell, begins again worse than ever, when our\r\nmelancholy friend, Smallweed, having signed the clothing receipt\r\ndoubtfully, presently announces, with the air of an injured martyr, that\r\nhe supposes it's all right, but he can't find all the things he signed\r\nfor. Then everybody frantically examines into this new difficulty, and\r\ndiscovers that they signed for everything, and got nothing. Poor Captain\r\nPipes scratches his head perplexedly, and smokes in anxious puffs.\r\nSergeant Files hustles everybody about, exposes several shamefaced\r\nimpostors, who have more than everything, and by the timely announcement\r\nthat Smallweed's deficiency consists of two overcoat straps, which are\r\nno longer used in the service, restores comparative quiet. Smallweed,\r\nhowever, retires up and shakes his head dubiously, remarking in an\r\nundertone, to a weak-eyed young man, who stands in mortal awe of him,\r\nthat it may be all right, but he don't see it.\r\n\r\nDrills, drills, drills! For the next week we have nothing but\r\ndrills--except guard duty. Squad drills, company drills, drills in the\r\nfacings, drills under arms, drills in the morning, noonday drills,\r\ndrills at night. Besides these, the office all day, and guard duty every\r\nthird night. Talk about the patriotic days of '76! you think--was there\r\never anything like this? In less than a week everybody is played out;\r\neverybody, that is, except a lymphatic, dull-visaged backwoodsman, named\r\nTetter, who drags through everything so slowly and heavily, that he\r\ncan't get tired, and an old Polish cavalryman, named Hrsthzschnoffski,\r\nor something of the kind, but naturally called Snuffsky, who knows\r\nneither enthusiasm nor fatigue, who never volunteers for a duty nor ever\r\nbegs off from it. Growls arise. Men pale about the cheeks, beady in the\r\nforehead, and dark under the eyes, begin to collect in knotlets, and\r\ntalk over the situation. 'We enlisted to fight,' the bolder spirits\r\nhint; 'we came to fight, not to drill and guard armories. Why don't they\r\ntake us out and let us whip the enemy, and go back to our business?' But\r\npresently comes\r\n\r\n_The 19th of April._ No drill to-night. What is that? A fight in\r\nBaltimore? Nonsense! True though, for all that, as history will vouch.\r\nSix regiments of Massachusetts troops have been attacked in Baltimore by\r\nthe 'Plugs,' and cut to pieces. Where was the 'Seventh!' we wonder,\r\neducated in the creed of its invincibility and omnipresence. The Seventh\r\nwas there too, and has been massacred. Colonel Lefferts is killed. There\r\nis a stir around the armory door, the knot of idlers gives way\r\nrespectfully, and admits a little man, the pride of the regiment, always\r\ncool, collected, handsome, and soldierly--Colonel Diamond. He says half\r\na dozen words in a whisper to the captain, writes three lines with a\r\npencil on the fly leaf of an old letter, gives a comprehensive glance\r\naround, in which we feel he sees everything, salutes the captain, and\r\nmarches briskly, almost noiselessly, into the street. Smallweed, the\r\nmelancholy man, rolls up his blanket, packs his knapsack, combs his hair\r\nsadly, and moans out: 'Detail for the guard: Private Smallweed. I'm\r\nd----d if I stand this any longer! I'll write to----'\r\n\r\n'Fall in men; fall in under arms; fall in lively now!' barks the orderly\r\nsergeant. 'Get up here, Snuffsky. Tetter, don't you mean to fall in at\r\nall?' and so on. Volunteers are wanted for special and perhaps dangerous\r\nservice. Perhaps dangerous! (Quick movement of admiration.) 'Every man\r\nwilling to go will step two paces to the front.' The company moves\r\nforward in line, much to the disgust of Sergeant Files, who finds he\r\nmust make a detail after all. Lieutenant Frank, Sergeant Mullins,\r\nCorporal Bledsoe, and twenty privates are presently detailed, and, after\r\ntremendous preparation and excitement, during which Smallweed discovers\r\nthat some one has stolen his percussion caps, and is incontinently\r\ncursed by Sergeant Files for his pains, march off amid the cheers of the\r\ndisappointed remainder. We mourn our sad lot at being left out of the\r\ndetail, when presently comes a second detail: Second Lieutenant\r\nTreadwell, Sergeant Ogle, Corporal Funk, and twenty privates, of whom\r\nyou, Jenkins, are one. As you get ready, you adopt stern resolves,\r\nstiffen that upper lip, and confide a short message for some one to one\r\nof the survivors, in case, as you proudly hint, you should not return.\r\nThe survivor rewards you with a pressure of the hand, and a look of\r\nwonder at your coolness.\r\n\r\n'_Support_--ARMS! _Quick_--MARCH!' the lieutenant says, almost in a\r\nwhisper, as we leave the building, and are fairly in the street. Where\r\nare we going? Why do we go down Pennsylvania Avenue? This is not the\r\nway to Long Bridge. Are the enemy attacking the navy yard? all wonder;\r\nno one speaks. 'Halt!' Why, this is the telegraph office! and we take\r\npossession of it in the name of the United States. Despatches between\r\nBaltimore and Richmond have passed over the wires that very evening, and\r\nwe even interrupt one with our sword bayonets. Then we hear the truth\r\nabout that Baltimore business. The Southern operators and clerks crow\r\nover and denounce us. We feel gulpy about the throat, and those of us\r\nwho yet tremble at the thought of 'fratricide,' wish they were out of\r\nthis, until Smallweed effects a diversion by dexterously, though quite\r\naccidentally, upsetting the longest-haired, loudest-mouthed operator\r\ninto the biggest and dirtiest spittoon. But worse than this is in store\r\nfor the unlucky sympathizers, for, after thinking sadly over his feat,\r\nthe same melancholy Smallweed suddenly asks them what tune the Southern\r\nConfederacy will adopt as its national air. One incautious Georgian\r\nsuggests 'Dixie,' he reckons. ''Spittoon,' I should think,' says\r\nSmallweed mournfully. For which he is pronounced by the same gentleman\r\nfrom Georgia to be a divinely condemned fool. How hungry we grew, and\r\nhow pale and seedy, before the relief came at 8 A.M., with the great\r\nnews that the other detail had seized the Alexandria boat!\r\n\r\nThis is the age of seizures. We seize all the steamers. We seize the\r\nrailroad, A train comes in, and we seize the cars. Then there is a let\r\nup: the Confederate lexicon still at work, flashing out the last feeble\r\njerks of its poison. We release the telegraph; we release the railway;\r\nwe release the steamers. One of the latter, the George Page, goes down\r\nto Alexandria, straightway to become a _ram_, terrible to the\r\nweak-minded, though harmless enough in reality. Then we seize them all\r\nagain, and, this time, with the railway--praised be Allah!--a train of\r\ncars! Presently a detachment, envied by the disappointed, goes out from\r\nour company on this train to reconnoitre. Communication with the great\r\nNorth is cut off. Every stalk of corn in all Maryland rises up, in the\r\nnightmare that seems to possess the capital, a man, nay, a 'Southron,'\r\nterrible, invincible, Yankee-hating. Will relief never come? Where are\r\nthose seventy-five thousand? Where is the Seventh? Officers in mufti are\r\nknown to have been sent out to Annapolis and Baltimore with orders and\r\nfor news. Others arrive in Washington filled with strange and vague\r\ntidings of impending disaster. But as yet these doves have no news save\r\nof the deluge. Presently an early _reveille_ startles us from our beds\r\nof soft plank, and, as we fall in sleepily, fagged and exhausted in mind\r\nand body by this work, so new and so trying, we are electrified by the\r\nhoarse croak of Sergeant Files--he too is used up. 'Volunteers to go\r\nbeyond the District,' step two paces t'the front--H'rch!' Four men\r\nremain in the ranks. All eyes turn to this shabby remnant, but they\r\nremain immovable, with the leaden expression belonging to the victims of\r\nthe Confederate lexicon, that seems to say, unaccused, '_I am not\r\nashamed._' These men are instantly detailed for guard duty at the armory\r\nfor the next twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe rest of us reach the railway station shortly after daylight, are\r\ntold off into platoons, and embarked on the train which the hissing\r\nengine announces to be waiting for us. Our comrades in this adventure\r\nare Captain Hoblitzel's company, the 'Swartz-Jaegers,' brawny mechanics,\r\nsturdy Teutons, and all of a size. These are Germans, remember, not what\r\nwe call Hessians; not the kind that are destined to make Pennsylvania a\r\nbyword; not the kind that advance in clogs but retreat in seven-league\r\nboots. We part from our German friends with a rousing cheer, as heartily\r\nreturned, at a bridge which they are to guard. Then we have the cars to\r\nourselves. Surely this is the _ne plus ultra_ of railway travelling;\r\nfree tickets and a whole seat to yourself. We are to keep our rifles out\r\nof sight, unless an emergency arises. The funny men play conductor,\r\nannouncing familiar stations in unintelligible roars, and singing out\r\n'Tickets!' importunately. This is our first real danger. There is real\r\nexcitement in this. We all hope there will be a fight; all except\r\nSmallweed, who remains melancholy, according to his wont, save when a\r\nsad pun breaks the surface into a temporary ripple of quiet smiles. And\r\nso, with wild jokes, mad capers, and loudly shouted songs, we whirl\r\nalong, twenty miles an hour, over bridges, through cuts, above\r\nembankments, always through danger and into danger. Hoot, toot! shrieks\r\nthe engine; the breaks are rasped down; the train slowly consumes its\r\nmomentum in vainly trying to stop suddenly. Silence reigns. Every man\r\nnervously, as by instinct, grasps his rifle, half cocks it, looks to the\r\ncap, and thrusts his head out of the window. A shout: 'There they are!'\r\n'Where?' Several of the more nervous rifle barrels protrude uncertainly\r\nfrom the windows. 'Steady men, _steady!_' from the clear voice of\r\nCaptain Pipes. 'I see them.' 'There they are.' 'Three of them.' 'One of\r\nthem has on gray clothes, and--'\r\n\r\n'THE SEVENTH, by----!' rings in every ear. No matter who said it. '_The\r\nSeventh_,' every throat shouts. Then such a cheer, and such another, and\r\nsuch another after that, and such a tiger after that, and such other\r\ncheers and such other tigers!--until the train stops, and, regardless of\r\norders, unheeding the vain protests of the captain or the curses of the\r\nlieutenants, or the objurgations of Sergeant Files, we rush madly,\r\npellmell, from the cars. Everybody shakes hands with the Seventh man,\r\nand with everybody else. He is thirsty: sixty odd flasks are uncorked\r\nand jammed at him. Hungry, too? The men hustle him into the cars, and\r\nalmost into the barrels of pork and bread, with which we came provided\r\nin quantities sufficient, as we thought in our simplicity, for a siege,\r\nthough really, as I have since found reason to believe, amounting to\r\nless than a thousand rations.\r\n\r\n'Where is the Seventh?' 'At the Junction.' We are only a mile from the\r\nJunction. All aboard again, and we steam up to the Junction, just in\r\ntime to see the leading companies file into the station, from their\r\nhistorical march--famous from being the first of the war, twice famous\r\nbecause Winthrop told its story; in time to see the Eighth Massachusetts\r\nfollow our favorite heroes; in time to bring the Seventh to Washington;\r\nin time thus to terminate the dark hours of anxious suspense and doubt\r\nthat followed the 19th of April and the drawing of the first blood in\r\nthe streets of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nDulness succeeds this spurt of glory, and there is nothing more\r\ninteresting than guarding the Long Bridge or a steamboat, alternating\r\nwith drills, drills, drills! We are initiated into the mystery of the\r\ndouble quick, under knapsacks and overcoats. Men begin to be detailed on\r\nextra duty. More men are detailed on extra duty. Doctor Peacack makes\r\nhis appearance. The sick list becomes an institution. It is curious to\r\nnotice how the same men, detailed for guard, police, or fatigue, appear\r\non the sick list, and, being excused by the mild Peacack, straightway\r\nreappear in the 'cocktail squad.' But a wink, as good as a nod, from the\r\ncaptain, and the fragrant oil of the castor bean, prescribed to be taken\r\non the spot, soon corrects these little discrepancies. The guardhouse\r\nbecomes an institution. Todd second is a frequent inmate; he will drink.\r\nSwilliams is another, who takes a drink, and becomes insane; takes\r\nanother, and becomes sick; takes another, and then a quiet snooze, with\r\nhis head resting on the nearest curb. We call these unfortunates\r\n'Company Q;' a splendid joke. The captain drills us as far as 'On the\r\nright, by file, into line,' and apparently can get no farther. So we\r\nthink, and that the first lieutenant kn=ows twice much as the captain.\r\nAnd, oh! how we come to hate Sergeant Files, and his hard, carking\r\nvoice, always rasping somebody about something! We have been in service\r\na month. The city is full of troops; the heights back are covered with\r\ncamps; the 'Fire Zouaves' have introduced the Five Points to our\r\nacquaintance; General Blankhed is still giving passes to go to Richmond;\r\nthe enemy's pickets stare at ours from other end of Long Bridge; nobody\r\nis hurt as yet. Presently comes an order constituting the 'American\r\nSharpshooters,' the 'Fisler Guards,' the Union Carbineers,' the 'Seward\r\nCadets,' and the 'Bulger Guards,' a battalion, to be known as the Ninth\r\nBattalion (did I say there were only eight? no matter) of the First\r\nRegiment of District of Columbia Volunteers, and to be commanded by\r\nMajor Johnson Heavysterne, the _beau ideal_ of a militia major--fat,\r\npompous, not much acquainted with military, but, to use his own\r\nvocabulary, knowing right smart in the fish and cheese line. But let me\r\ndeal kindly with the honest old soul; he meant well, but he had bad\r\nluck; and he made me, Private William Jenkins, the writer of these\r\ndisjointed phrases, sergeant-major of the battalion. Whereof, kind\r\nreader, more anon: for here I left off my _scales_ and sewed on my\r\n_chevrons_. (That is, she did. Please see PART II.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SACRIFICE\r\n\r\n\r\n  The blood that flows for freedom is God's blood!\r\n  Who dies for man's redemption, dies with Christ!\r\n  The plan of expiation is unchanged:\r\n  And, as One died, supremely good, for all,\r\n  So one dies still, that many more may live.\r\n\r\n  So fall our saviours on the bloody field,\r\n  In deadly swamps, along the foul lagoons,\r\n  On the long march, in crowded hospitals,\r\n  Of wounds, of weariness, of pain and thirst,\r\n  Of wasting fevers and of sudden plagues,\r\n  Of pestilence, that lurks within the camp,\r\n  Of long home-sickness, and of hope deferred,\r\n  Of languishing, in hostile prisons chained--\r\n  And, with their blood, they wash the nation clean,\r\n  And furnish expiation for the sin\r\n  That those who slay them have been guilty of.\r\n\r\n  So God selects the noblest of the land:\r\n  He culls the qualities that are His own--\r\n  Our courage, patience, love of human kind,\r\n  Our strong devotion to the cause of Right,\r\n  Our noblest aspirations for the time\r\n  When every man shall stand erect and free,\r\n  Self-elevated, God-appointed king!\r\n  Knowing no equals, save his brother men;\r\n  Ruling no lieges, save his own desires;\r\n  The undisputed sovereign of himself,\r\n  Owning no higher sovereignty but God.\r\n\r\n  God culls these qualities, that are Himself--\r\n  These sparks of Deity that live in man--\r\n  And, in man's person, offers up Himself,\r\n  A long, perpetual sacrifice for sin.\r\n\r\n  This is the plan--the changeless plan of Heav'n:\r\n  The good die, that the evil may be purged;\r\n  The noble perish, that the base may live;\r\n  The free are bound, that slaves may break their bonds;\r\n  Those who have happy homes are self-exiled,\r\n  That other exiles may have happy homes;\r\n  The bravest sons of Freedom's land are slain,\r\n  That the oppressed of tyrant realms may live;\r\n  The guilty land is washed in innocent blood;\r\n  And slavery is atoned for by the free.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Oh! desolate mother, wailing for thy son,\r\n  Be comforted. He was a chosen one.\r\n  The Lord selected him from other men,\r\n  Because the Eternal Eye discerned in him\r\n  Some noble attribute, some spark divine,\r\n  Some unseen quality, that was from God,\r\n  And is a part of God, howe'er obscured\r\n  By human weakness, or by human sin--\r\n  Something deemed worthy for the sacrifice\r\n  That shall redeem a nation. Weep no more;\r\n  For thou art blessed among womankind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRECK-VERSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart freezes upon the snowcapped summit of a mountain of learning.\r\n\r\nLead heads will not answer as plummets to fathom the depths of the\r\n  Infinite.\r\n\r\nCharitable views are enlarged by tear mists.\r\n\r\nThorns form footholds by which to reach the rose.\r\n\r\nLooking up to the sun, the sad behold rainbows through their tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDIVINE COMEDY.--A POLISH DRAMA.\r\n\r\nDedicated to Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n     'To be, or not to be, that is the question.'\r\n\r\n     'To the accumulated errors of their ancestors, they added others\r\n     unknown to their predecessors Doubt and Fear;--therefore it came to\r\n     pass that they vanished from the face of the earth, and a deep\r\n     silence shrouded them forever.'--_Koran_ il. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn offering to the public a translation of the great drama of Count\r\nSigismund Krasinski, a statesman and poet of Poland, it is not the\r\nintention of the translator to enter upon any detailed analysis of this\r\nwidely and justly celebrated work. Such a dissection would diminish the\r\ninterest of the reader in the development of the plot, and moreover\r\npertains properly to the critics, to whom 'The Undivine Comedy' is\r\nespecially commended. It is so full of original and subtile thoughts, of\r\nprofound truths, of metaphysical deductions and psychological\r\ndivinations, that it cannot fail to repay any consideration they may\r\nbestow upon it. A few general remarks, however, seem necessary to\r\nintroduce it, in its proper light, to the reader.\r\n\r\nIt was published in 1834, and, although it appeared anonymously, it at\r\nonce succeeded in attracting the attention of the readers and thinkers\r\nof Poland, Russia, France, and Germany. Its author is now known to have\r\nbeen Count Sigismund Krasinski, a member of one of the most ancient and\r\ndistinguished families of Poland. He was equally eminent as poet,\r\npatriot, and statesman. He took an active and important part in the\r\nsocial and political questions of his day, many of which are ably\r\ndiscussed in this drama; questions which have so long disturbed the\r\npeace of Europe, and whose solution is perhaps to be finally given in\r\nour land of equality and freedom.\r\n\r\n'The Undivine Comedy' was not intended for the stage, and, as if to\r\nsever it as widely as possible from all scenic associations, Count\r\nKrasinski makes no use of the terms 'scenes' or 'acts.' This omission\r\ngives a somewhat singular appearance to what is, in fact, a drama; the\r\ntranslator has, however, remained faithful throughout to the original\r\nform. As the hero, the count, is styled 'The Man' throughout the\r\noriginal, the name has been preserved, in spite of its awkward\r\nappearance in English: the spirit of a poetic work, full of mystic\r\nsymbolism, evaporates so readily in the process of translation, that no\r\nsacrifice of the literal meaning has been made to grace or elegance.\r\n\r\n'The Undivine Comedy,' so called in contradistinction to 'The Divine\r\nComedy' of Dante, is the first purely _prophetic_ play occurring in the\r\nworld of art. Its scenes are indeed all laid in the _time to come_; its\r\npersons, actions, and events are _yet to be_. The struggle of the dying\r\nPast with the vigorous but immature Future, forms the groundwork of the\r\ndrama. The coloring is not local, nor characteristic of any country in\r\nparticular, because the truths to be illustrated are of universal\r\napplication, and are evolving their own solutions in all parts of the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nThe soul of the hero, 'The Man,' is great and vigorous; he is by nature\r\na poet. Belonging to the Future by the very essence of his being, he yet\r\nbecomes disgusted by the debasing materialism into which its living\r\nexponents, the '_New Men_, have fallen, he loses all hope in the\r\npossible progress of humanity, and is presented to us as the champion of\r\nthe dying but poetic Past. But in this he finds no rest, and is involved\r\nin perpetual struggles and contradictions. Baffled in a consuming\r\ndesire to solve the perplexing religious and social problems of the day\r\nby the force of his own intellect; longing for, yet despairing of, human\r\nprogress; discerning the impracticability and chicanery of most of the\r\nmodern plans for social amelioration--he determines to throw himself\r\ninto common life, to bind himself to his race by stringent laws and\r\nduties. The drama opens when he is about to contract marriage.\r\n\r\nHis Guardian Angel, anxious to save him, tries to lead him, through the\r\naccomplishment of human duties, safely into that mystic Future, which he\r\nhad already vainly tried to find through the power of his own intellect.\r\nThe Angel chants to him:\r\n\r\n'Peace be to men of good will. Blessed is the man who has still a heart;\r\nhe may yet be saved!\r\n\r\n'Pure and true wife, reveal thyself to him; and a child be born to their\r\nhouse!'\r\n\r\nThus the words once heard by the shepherds, and which then announced a\r\nnew epoch to humanity, open the drama. It is indeed only 'men of good\r\nwill,' men who sincerely seek the truth, who, in great or new epochs,\r\nare able to comprehend it, or willing to receive it. And the number of\r\nthose who have preserved a _heart_ during the excitement and passions of\r\nsuch eras, is always very small, and without it they cannot be saved,\r\nfor love and self-abnegation are the essence of Christianity.\r\n\r\nTo instil new life and hope into the wearied 'Man,' the Angel ordains\r\nthat a pure and good woman shall join her fate with his; that innocent\r\nyoung souls shall descend and dwell with them. Domestic love and quiet\r\nbliss are the counsel of the heavenly visitant.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the simple chant of the Guardian Angel, the voice of\r\nthe Evil Spirit is heard seducing 'The Man' from the quiet path of\r\nhumble human duties. The glories of the ideal realm are spread before\r\nhim; Nature is invoked with all her entrancing charms; ambitious desires\r\nof terrestrial greatness are awakened in his soul; he is filled with\r\nvague hopes of paradisiacal happiness, which the Demon whispers him it\r\nis quite possible to establish on earth. In the temptations so cunningly\r\nset before him by the Father of Lies, three widely-spread metaphysical\r\nsystems are shadowed forth: the ideal or poetic; the pantheistic; and\r\nthe anthropotheistic (Comte's), which deifies man. The vast symbolism of\r\nthis original drama is especially recommended to the attention of the\r\ncritic.\r\n\r\nAbiding by the counsel of the Angel, our hero marries, thus involving\r\nanother in his fate. He makes a solemn vow to be faithful, in the\r\nkeeping of which vow he takes upon himself the responsibility of the\r\nhappiness of one of God's creatures, a pure and trusting woman, who\r\nloves him well. A husband and a father, he breaks his oath. Tempted by\r\nthe phantom of a long-lost love, the Ideal under the form of a 'Maiden,'\r\nhe deserts the real duties he has assumed to pursue this Ideal,\r\npersonated indeed by Lucifer himself, and which becomes--true and\r\nfearful lesson for those who seek the infinite in the human!--a\r\nloathsome skeleton as soon as grasped. From the false and disappointing\r\nsearch into which he had been enticed by the demon, he returns to find\r\nthe innocent wife, whom he had deserted, in a madhouse. False to human\r\nduties, his punishment came fast upon the heels of crime.\r\n\r\nIn the scene which occurs in Bedlam we find the key which admits us to\r\nmuch of the symbolism of this drama. We are conducted into the madhouse\r\nto visit the broken-hearted wife, and are there introduced into our\r\nstill-existing society, formal, monotonous, cold, and about to be\r\ndissolved. Our hero had himself married the Past, a good and devout\r\nwoman, but not the realization of his poetic dreams, which nothing\r\ncould have satisfied save the infinite. In the midst of this scene of\r\nstrange suffering, we hear the cries of the Future, and all is terror\r\nand tumult. This Future, with its turbulence, blood, and demonism, is\r\nrepresented as existing in its germs among the maniacs. Like the springs\r\nof a volcanic mountain, which are always disturbed before an eruption of\r\nfire, their cries break upon us; the broken words and shrill shrieks of\r\nthe madmen are the clouds of murky smoke which burst from the explosive\r\ncraters before the lava pours its burning flood. Voices from the right,\r\nfrom the left, from above, from below, represent the conflicting\r\nreligious opinions and warring political parties of this dawning Future,\r\nalready hurtling against those of the dissolving Present.\r\n\r\nInto this pandemonium, by his desertion of her for a vain ideal, our\r\nhero has plunged his wife, the woman of the Past, whom he had sworn to\r\nmake happy. And it is to be observed that she was not necessarily his\r\ninferior, but, in the world of _heart_, superior to himself. A true and\r\npure character, feeling its inferiority and anxious to advance, cannot\r\nlong remain in the background; it has sufficient stamina to attain the\r\nheight of self-abnegating greatness. God sometimes deprives men of the\r\nstrength necessary for action, but He never robs them of the faculty of\r\nprogress, of spiritual elevation. Head and heart throb with the same\r\npulsation; the brain thinks not aright without the healthful heart.\r\nMeanness and grovelling are always voluntary, and their essence is to\r\nresist superiority, to struggle against it, to try to degrade it: thus,\r\nall the bitter reactions of the Past against the changes truly needed\r\nfor the development of the Future, spring from a primeval root of\r\nbaseness.\r\n\r\nAn admirable picture of an exhausted and dying society is given us in\r\nthe person of the precocious but decrepit child, the sole fruit of a sad\r\nmarriage. Destined from its birth, to an early grave, its excitable\r\nimagination soon consumes its frail body. Nothing could be more\r\nexquisitely tender, more true to nature, than the portraiture of this\r\nunfortunate but lovely boy.\r\n\r\nAfter the betrayal of our hero by his Ideal, the Guardian Angel again\r\nappears to give him simple but sage counsel:\r\n\r\n'Return to thy house, and sin no more!\r\n\r\n'Return to thy house, and love thy child!'\r\n\r\nBut vain this sage advice! As if driven to the desert to be tempted, we\r\nagain meet our hero in the midst of storm and tempest, wildly communing\r\nwith Nature, trying to read in her changeful phenomena lessons he should\r\nhave sought in the depths of his own soul; seeking from her dumb lips\r\noracles only to be found in his fulfilment of sacred duties; for only\r\nthus is to be solved the perplexing riddle of human destiny. 'Peace to\r\nmen of good will!' Roaming through the wilderness, sad and hopeless, and\r\nin his despair about to fall into the gloomy and blighting sin of caring\r\nfor no one but himself, the Angel again appears, and again chants to him\r\nthe divine lesson that only in self-sacrificing love and lowly duties,\r\ncan the true path to the Future be found:\r\n\r\n'Love the sick, the hungry, the despairing!\r\n\r\n'Love thy neighbor, thy poor neighbor, as thyself, and thou wilt be\r\nredeemed!'\r\n\r\nThe reiterated warning is again given in vain. The demon of ambition\r\nthen appears to him under the form of a gigantic eagle, whose wings stir\r\nhim like the cannon's roar, the trumpet's call; he yields to the\r\ntemptation, and the Guardian Angel pleads no more! He determines to\r\nbecome great, renowned, to rule over men: political power is to console\r\nhim for the domestic ruin he has spread around him, in having preferred\r\nthe dreams of his own excited imagination, to the love and faith of the\r\nsimple but tender heart which God had confided to him in the holy bonds\r\nof marriage. The love and deification of self in the delusive show of\r\nmilitary or political glory, is the lowest and last temptation into\r\nwhich a noble soul can fall, for individual fame is preferred to God's\r\neternal justice, and men are willing to die, if only laurel crowned,\r\nwith joy and pride even in a bad cause.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the third part of the comedy we are introduced into\r\nthe 'new world.' The old world, with its customs, prejudices,\r\noppressions, charities, laws, has been almost destroyed. The details of\r\nthe struggle, which must have been long and dreadful, are not given to\r\nus; they are to be divined. Several years are supposed to have passed\r\nbetween the end of the second and the beginning of the third part, and\r\nwe are called to witness the triumphs of the victors, the tortures of\r\nthe vanquished. The character of the idol of the people is an admirable\r\nconception. All that is negative and destructive in the revolutionary\r\ntendencies of European society, is skilfully seized upon, and incarnated\r\nin a single individual. _His mission is to destroy._ He possesses a\r\ngreat intellect, but no heart. He says: \"_Of the blood we shed to-day,\r\nno trace will be left to-morrow._\" In corroboration of this conception\r\nof the character of a modern reformer, it is well known that most of the\r\nprojected reforms of the last century have proceeded from the brains of\r\nlogicians and philosophers.\r\n\r\nThis man of intellect succeeds in grasping power. His appearance speaks\r\nhis character. His forehead is high and angular, his head entirely bald,\r\nhis expression cold and impassible, his lips never smile--he is of the\r\nsame type as many of the revolutionary leaders during the French reign\r\nof terror. His name is Pancratius, which name, from the Greek, signifies\r\nthe union of all material or brutal forces. It is not by chance that he\r\nhas received this name. The profound truth in which this character is\r\nconceived is also manifested in his distrust of himself, in his\r\nhesitation. As he is acting from false principles, he cannot deceive\r\nhimself into that enthusiastic faith with which he would fain inspire\r\nhis disciples. He confides in Leonard, because he is in possession of\r\nthis precious quality.\r\n\r\nHis monologue is very fine; perhaps it stands next in rank to that of\r\nHamlet. It opens to us the strange secrets of the irresolution and\r\nvacillation which have always characterized the men who have been called\r\nupon by fate alone to undertake vast achievements. In proof of this, it\r\nis well known that Cromwell was anxious to conceal the doubts and fears\r\nwhich constantly harassed him. It was these very doubts and fears which\r\nled him to see and resee so frequently the dethroned Charles, and which\r\nat last drove the conscience-stricken Puritan into the sepulchre of the\r\ndecapitated king, that he might gaze into the still face of the royal\r\nvictim, whose death he had himself effected. Did the sad face of the\r\ndead calm the fears of the living?\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that Danton addressed to himself the most dreadful\r\nreproaches. Even, at the epoch of his greatest power, Robespierre was\r\ngreatly annoyed because he could not convince his cook of the justice\r\nand permanence of his authority. Men who are sent by Providence only to\r\ndestroy, feel within them the worm which gnaws forever: it constantly\r\npredicts to them, in vague but gloomy presentiments, their own\r\napproaching destruction.\r\n\r\nA feeling of this nature urges Pancratius to seek an interview with his\r\nmost powerful enemy, 'The Man;' he is anxious to gain the confidence of\r\nhis adversary, because he cannot feel certain of his own course while a\r\nsingle man of intellectual power exists capable of resisting his ideas.\r\nIn the interview which occurs between the two antagonistic leaders of\r\nthe Past and Future, the various questions which divide society,\r\nliterature, religion, philosophy, politics, are discussed. Is it not a\r\nprofound truth that in the real world also, _mental_ encounters always\r\nprecede _material_ combats; that men always measure their strength,\r\n_spirit to spirit_, before they meet in external fact, _body to body_?\r\nThe idea of bringing two vast systems face to face through living and\r\nhighly dramatic personifications, is truly great, suggestive, and\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nBut as the Truth is neither in the camp of Pancratius nor in the feudal\r\ncastle of the count, our hero, the victory will profit neither party!\r\n\r\nThe opening of the last act is exceedingly beautiful. No painter could\r\nreproduce on canvas the sublime scenery sketched in its prologue; more\r\ngloomy than the pictures of Ruysdael, more sombre than those of Salvator\r\nRosa. Before describing the inundation of the masses, our author\r\nnaturally recalls the traditions of the Flood. The nobles, the\r\nrepresentatives of the Past, with their few surviving adherents, have\r\ntaken refuge in their last stronghold, the fortress of the Holy Trinity,\r\nsecurely situated upon a high and rocky peak overhanging a deep valley,\r\nsurrounded and hedged in by steep cliffs and rocky precipices. Through\r\nthese straits and passes once howled and swept the waters of the deluge.\r\nAs wild an inundation is now upon them, for the valley is almost filled\r\nwith the living surges of the myriads of the 'New Men,' who are rolling\r\ntheir millions into its depths. But everything is hidden from view by an\r\nocean of heavy vapor, wrapping the whole landscape in its white, chill,\r\nclinging shroud. The last and only banner of the Cross now raised upon\r\nthe face of the earth, streams from the highest tower of the castle of\r\nthe Holy Trinity; it alone pierces through and floats above the cold,\r\nvague, rayless heart of the sea of mist--nought save the mystic symbol\r\nof God's love to man soars into the unclouded blue of the infinite sky!\r\n\r\nAfter frequent defeats, after the loss of all hope, the hero, wishing to\r\nembrace for the last time his sick and blind son, sends for the\r\nprecocious boy, whose death-hour is to strike before his own. I doubt if\r\nthe scene which then occurs has, in the whole range of fiction and\r\npoetry, ever been surpassed. This poor boy, the son of an insane mother\r\nand a poet-father, is gifted with supernatural faculties, endowed with\r\nsecond or spiritual sight. Entirely blind, and consequently surrounded\r\nby perpetual darkness, it mattered not to him if the light of day or the\r\ngloom of midnight was upon the earth; and in his rayless wanderings he\r\nhad made his way into the dungeons, sepulchres, and vaults, which were\r\nlying far below the foundations of the castle, and which had for\r\ncenturies served as places of torture, punishment, and death to the\r\nenemies of his long and noble line. In these secret charnel houses were\r\nburied the bodies of the oppressed, while in the haughty tombs around\r\nand above them lay the bones of their oppressors. The unfortunate and\r\nfragile boy, the last sole scion of a long line of ancestry, had there\r\nmet the thronging and complaining ghosts of past generations. Burdened\r\nwith these dreadful secrets, when his vanquished father seeks him to\r\nembrace him for the last time, he shudderingly hints to him of fearful\r\nknowledge, and induces his parent to accompany him into the subterranean\r\ncaverns. He then recounts to him the scenes which are passing before his\r\nopen vision among the dead. The spirits of those who had been chained,\r\ntortured, oppressed, or victimized by his ancestors appear before him,\r\ncomplaining of past cruelties. They then form a mystic tribunal to try\r\ntheir old masters and oppressors; the scenes of the dreadful Day of\r\nJudgment pass before him; the unhappy and loving boy at last recognizes\r\nhis own father among the criminals; he is dragged to that fatal bar, he\r\nsees him wring his hands in anguish, he hears his dreadful groans as he\r\nis given over to the fiends for torture--he hears his mother's voice\r\ncalling him above, but, unwilling to desert his father in his anguish,\r\nhe falls to the earth in a deep and long fainting fit, while the\r\nwretched father hears his own doom pronounced by that dread but unseen\r\ntribunal: '_Because thou hast loved nothing, nor revered aught but\r\nthyself and thine own thoughts, thou art damned to all eternity!_'\r\n\r\nIt is true this scene is very brief, but, rapid as the lightning's\r\nflash, it lasts long enough to scathe and blast, breaking the darkness\r\nbut to show the surrounding horror, to deepen into despair the fearful\r\ngloom. Although of the most severe simplicity, it is sublime and\r\nterrible. It is so concise that our hearts actually long for more,\r\nunwilling to believe in the reality of the doom of that ghostly\r\ntribunal. It repeats the awful lessons of Holy Writ, and our conscience\r\nawakes to our deficiencies, while the marrow freezes in our bones as we\r\nread.\r\n\r\nThe close of the drama is equally sublime. Because the 'TRUTH' was\r\nneither in the camp of Pancratius nor the castle of the count, IT\r\nappears in the clouds to confound them both.\r\n\r\nAfter Pancratius has conquered all that opposed him--has triumphantly\r\ngloated over his Fourieristic schemes for the _material_ well-being of\r\nthe race whom he has robbed of all higher faith--he grows agitated at\r\nthe very name of God when it falls from the lips of his confidant,\r\nLeonard: the sound seems to awaken him to a consciousness that he is\r\nstanding in a sea of blood, which he has himself shed; he feels that he\r\nhas been nothing but an instrument of destruction, that he has done\r\ncertain evil for a most uncertain good. All this rushes rapidly upon\r\nhim, when, on the bosom of a crimson sunset cloud, he perceives a mystic\r\nsymbol, unseen save by himself: 'the extended arms are lightning\r\nflashes, the three nails shine like stars--his eyes die out as he gazes\r\nupon it--he falls dead to the earth, crying, in the strange words spoken\r\nby the apostate emperor Julian with his parting breath: '_Vicisti\r\nGalilee_!' Thus this grand and complex drama is really consecrated to\r\nthe glory of the Galilean!\r\n\r\nThe intense melancholy characterizing every page of this drama, has its\r\nroot in the character and intensity of the truths therein developed, and\r\nis not manifested in artistic declamation, in highly wrought phrases, or\r\nin glowing rhetorical passages proper for citation. It is as bitter as\r\nlife; as gloomy as death and judgment. The style is one of utter, almost\r\nbald, simplicity. The situations are merely indicated, and the\r\ncharacters are to be understood, as are those of the living, rather from\r\na few words in close connection with accompanying facts, than from\r\neloquent utterances, sharp invectives, or bitter complaints. There are\r\nno highly wrought amplifications of imaginative passions to be found in\r\nits condensed pages, but every word is in itself a drop of gall,\r\nreflecting from its sphered surface a world of grief, of agony. The\r\ncharacters pass before us like shadows thrown from a magic lantern,\r\nshowing only their profiles, and but rarely their entire forms. Flitting\r\nrapidly o'er our field of vision, they leave us but a few lines, but so\r\ntrue to nature, so deeply significant, that we are able to produce from\r\nthese shifting and evanescent shadows a complete and rounded image. Thus\r\nwe are enabled to form a vivid conception of every character--we know\r\nthe history of their past, we divine the part they will play in the\r\nfuture. We know the friends, the godfather, the priest, in whom we find\r\nan admirable sketch from a decomposed and dying society. He who, in a\r\nproper state of things, would have been the representative of living\r\nspiritual principles, is a mere supernumerary. He makes signs of the\r\ncross, pronounces accustomed formulas, but he never once thinks of\r\nexamining into the strange and contradictory relations existing between\r\nthe husband, forced by his very being into the Future, and the wife,\r\nfettered by the conventions and chains of the Past. Neither does he\r\nstudy, with an eye enlightened by philanthropy and spirituality, the\r\npoor infant, whose mental restlessness began in the cradle, although his\r\ncharacter and destiny seem to have been comprehended by the father. The\r\npriest, however, remains cold and indifferent throughout, never once\r\nseeking to render the two beings, whom he had himself united in a\r\nsacramental bond, intelligible to each other, nor to save the\r\nunfortunate boy brought to him for baptism, the sole fruit of this\r\nunhappy marriage.\r\n\r\nOur author also stigmatizes the whole medical art of our day as a\r\nscience of death and moral torture. While the anguished father tries to\r\npenetrate the decrees of Providence, and in his agony demands from God\r\nhow the innocent and helpless infant can have deserved a punishment so\r\ndreadful as the loss of sight, the doctor admires the strength of the\r\nnerves and muscles of the blue eyes of the fair child, at the same time\r\nannouncing to his father that he is struck with total and hopeless\r\nblindness. Immediately after the declaration of this fearful sentence,\r\nhe turns to the distressed parent to ask him if he would like to know\r\nthe name of this malady, and that in Greek it is called [Greek:\r\namaurosis]\r\n\r\nIndeed, through the whole of this melancholy scene, only one human being\r\nmanifests any deep moral feeling--a woman, a servant! Falling upon her\r\nknees, she prays the Holy Virgin to take her eyes, and place them in the\r\nsightless sockets of the young heir, her fragile but beloved charge.\r\nThus it is a woman of the people who, in the midst of the corrupt and\r\ndissolving society, alone preserves the sacred traditions of sympathy\r\nand self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe cruel tyranny of Pancratius and the mob, is also full of important\r\nlessons. From it we gather that despotism does not consist in the fact\r\nof the whole power being vested in the hands of one or many, _but in the\r\ntruth that a government is without love for the governed, whatever may\r\nbe its constitutional form_. One or many, an assembly of legislators or\r\na king, an oligarchy or a mob, may be equally despotic, if love be not\r\nthe ruling principle.\r\n\r\nWith these few remarks, some of them necessary for a full comprehension\r\nof this subtile and many-sided Polish drama, we leave the reader to the\r\npleasant task of its perusal.\r\n\r\nHe will find a full and eloquent criticism, in which its faults and\r\nbeauties are ably discussed, in a course of 'Lectures on Sclavonic\r\nLiterature,' delivered by the Polish poet Mickiewicz, before the College\r\nof France. Most of the above remarks have been condensed from his\r\nvaluable work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAL.\r\n\r\nStars are around thy head--under thy feet surges the sea--a rainbow\r\nforever floats upon the waves before thee--painting the mists, or\r\nmelting them into light--whatsoever thou lookest upon is thine--the\r\nshores, the cities, the men belong to thee--the heavens are thine--it\r\nseems as if nothing ever equalled thy glory!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo alien ears thou chantest airs of inconceivable rapture--thou weavest\r\nhearts into one with a single touch of thy fairy fingers, and with a\r\nbreath again dividest them--thou forcest tears--thou driest them with a\r\nsmile--alas! the next moment thou frightenest the wan smile from the\r\nquivering lip for a time--too often, forever!\r\n\r\nTell me, what dost thou thyself feel? Of what dost thou think? What dost\r\nthou create?\r\n\r\nThe living stream of Beauty flows on through thee, but thou thyself art\r\nnot Beauty!\r\n\r\nWoe to thee! woe! the child crying on the lap of its nurse, the field\r\nflower unconscious of its gift of perfume, have more merit before the\r\neyes of the Lord than thou!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat has been thy origin, thou empty shadow, bearing witness to the\r\nLight, yet knowing not the Light, which thou seest not, and wilt not\r\nsee!\r\n\r\nIn anger, or in mockery, wert thou made? Who was thy creator? Who gave\r\nthee thy short and mobile life, and taught thee such seductive magic,\r\nthat thou seemst to glitter for a moment like an angel before thou\r\nsinkest into clay, to creep like a worm, and be stifled in thine own\r\ncorruption?\r\n\r\nThy beginning is one with that of the woman.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet, alas! thou sufferest, although thy agony brings nought to the\r\nbirth, and avails thee nothing.\r\n\r\nThe groans of the lowest beggar are counted in heaven, compensated amid\r\nthe music of angels' harps--but thy sighs, thy despair, fall into the\r\nbottomless abyss, and Satan gathers them together, and joyfully adds\r\nthem to the pile of his own lies and delusions--and the Lord will deny\r\nand disown them, as they have denied and disowned the Lord!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut not for this do I pity thee, spirit of Poetry, mother of Beauty and\r\nFreedom! No. I mourn for the unhappy souls who are forced to remember or\r\ndivine thee upon chaotic worlds destined to destruction--alas! thou\r\nruinest only those who consecrate themselves to thee, who become the\r\nliving voices of thy fame!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, blessed is it when thou takest up thine abode in a man, as God\r\ndwelt in the world, unseen, unknown, yet everywhere great and mighty,\r\nthe Lord, before whom all creatures bow and say: 'He is here!'\r\n\r\nSuch a man will bear thee like a star upon his radiant brow; he will\r\nnever turn from thee even for the duration of a little word; he will\r\nlove men, and, like a man, walk with his brethren.\r\n\r\nAnd he who guards thee not, who is willing to betray thee, to devote\r\nthee to the idle pleasure of men--from him thou turnest sadly away,\r\nscattering in pity a few fading flowers upon his head; he plays with the\r\ndying bloom, and weaves his death-wreath all the days of his short life.\r\n\r\nThy beginning is one with that of the woman!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     'De toutes les bouffonneries la plus serieuse est le\r\n     mariage.'--_Figaro._\r\n\r\n     Of all jests the most serious is marriage.\r\n\r\nGUARDIAN ANGEL.

A night lamp stands upon a table, and shines\r\n     upon the face of the husband sleeping beside his wife.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_still sleeping_). Ha! whence comest thou? I have neither heard\r\nnor seen thee for months--for years.\r\n\r\nAs water softly flows, so flow thy feet, two white waves!\r\n\r\nA holy calm is on thy brow--all that I have ever dreamed--have ever\r\nloved--unite in thee!\r\n\r\n     Awaking suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhere am I?... Ha! I am sleeping by my wife--yes, that _is_ my wife--\r\n\r\n     Gazing long upon her.\r\n\r\nAh! I once thought thou wert my early Dream--but thou art it not;--after\r\nyears of time, it has returned to me--and is not thee, Mary, nor like\r\nthee!\r\n\r\nThou art mild, pure, good--but she....\r\n\r\nMy God! what do I see? Am I really awake?\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. Thou hast deserted and betrayed me!      Vanishes.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Cursed be the hour in which I married a wife, in which I\r\ndeserted the Love of my youth, the thought of my thought, the soul of my\r\nsoul....\r\n\r\nWIFE (_awaking_). What is it, Henry? Does the day already break? Is the\r\ncarriage at the door? We have so much to attend to to-day.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. No: it is only midnight. Go to sleep--sleep soundly!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Have you been taken suddenly ill, my dear? Shall I rise and get\r\nanything for you?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Sleep, sleep, I pray.\r\n\r\nWIFE. My dearest, tell me what is the matter with you! Your voice\r\ntrembles, your cheeks burn with fever.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_jumping out of bed_). I only want fresh air--for God's sake,\r\nstay here; do not follow me! Once more I beg you will not rise!\r\n\r\n     He leaves hurriedly the chamber.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Man is seen standing in a garden lighted by the moon. A gothic\r\n     church is in the distance.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Since the bells rang in my marriage morn, I have dozed away\r\nlife like a lump of clay, vegetating like a peasant, sleeping like a\r\nGerman boor. The whole world around me seems asleep in my own image.\r\nWhat a monotonous existence! I have visited relations, gone to shops,\r\nseen physicians, and when a child was born to me, I went for a nurse.\r\n\r\n     It strikes two upon the tower clock.\r\n\r\nReturn to me! return, O my old and misty realm, so safely sheltered in\r\nthe world of thought! Ye shadowy yet lovely forms, once wont to throng\r\naround me through the lonely midnight hours, hear my adjuration, and\r\nreturn! return!\r\n\r\n     He wrings his hands.\r\n\r\nO my God! hast Thou in very truth sanctified the ties which link two\r\nbodies into one?\r\n\r\nHast Thou surely said that nothing should avail to break them, even when\r\nthe two souls repel each other; when to advance at all, they must move\r\non upon opposing pathways, while the two chained bodies stiffen into\r\nfrozen corpses?\r\n\r\nAnd now that thou art again near me, my all, oh, take me with thee! If\r\nthou art but a dream, the creation of an o'erwrought brain, let me too\r\nbe but a dream, a cloud, a mist, that I may be one with thee!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. 'Remember, you have sworn to be true until death.'\r\n\r\nWilt thou follow me, if I fly near to lead thee on?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Stay, and melt not like a dream away! If thou art beautiful\r\nabove all other beauty; a thought above all other thoughts--why tarriest\r\nthou no longer than a wish a fading vision?\r\n\r\n     The window of the house standing in the garden is opened.\r\n\r\nA FEMALE VOICE. The chill of the night air will fall upon your breast,\r\nmy dear. Come back, Henry; it is fearful to be here alone in this vast\r\ndark room.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Yes; in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe fair spirit has vanished, but she promised to return for me--and\r\nthen farewell house and garden! and farewell wife! created for the house\r\nand garden, but not for me!\r\n\r\nFEMALE VOICE. For God's sake, come in! It grows so chill toward morning.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. But my child--O God!\r\n\r\n     He leaves the garden.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A large saloon. Two candles stand upon an open piano. A cradle is\r\n     near it, in which lies a sleeping child. The Man reclines upon a\r\n     sofa, covering his face with his hands. The Wife is seated at the\r\n     piano.\r\n\r\nWIFE. I have been to see Father Benjamin; he promised to be here day\r\nafter to-morrow.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nWIFE. I have also sent to the confectioner and ordered cakes and ices,\r\nfor I suppose you have invited many guests to the baptism of our infant.\r\nHe is to furnish us with some of those chocolate confections, with the\r\nname of our son, George Stanislaus, upon them.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nWIFE. God be thanked that the ceremony is so soon to be completed, and\r\nthat our little George will be made an entire Christian; for although he\r\nhas been already baptized with water, it always seems to me as if he\r\nwere wanting something.\r\n\r\n     She goes to the cradle.\r\n\r\nSleep, darling, sleep! Art thou dreaming, that thou thus tossest about\r\nthy white arms, and sufferest no covering to remain around thee? So\r\nnow--that will keep thee warm--lie so! How very restless my baby is\r\nto-day! What can be the matter with him? My darling! my beautiful!\r\nsleep! sleep!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_aside_). How hot and sultry it grows! A storm is rising; will\r\nnot the lightning flash from heaven, and strike me to the heart!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Neither yesterday, nor to-day, nor for the last week--O God! it is\r\nnow almost a whole month since you have, of your own accord, addressed a\r\nsingle word to me--and every one says I am growing so pale and thin!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_aside_). The hour is here--nothing can delay it longer.\r\n\r\n     (To his wife.)\r\n\r\nIndeed, on the contrary, I think you are looking remarkably well.\r\n\r\nWIFE. Alas! it is a matter of perfect indifference to you; you never\r\neven see me! When I come near you, Henry, you turn your head away; and\r\nif I sit down beside you, you cover your face with your hands.\r\n\r\nI went to confession yesterday, and carefully thought overall my faults\r\nand follies--but I could not remember in what way I had so grievously\r\noffended you.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You have not offended me.\r\n\r\nWIFE. O God! My God!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I feel it is my duty to love you.\r\n\r\nWIFE. You kill me with the words _my duty_! Rather say at once, _I do\r\nnot love you_--then I would at least know all--the worst!\r\n\r\n     She runs to the cradle, and holds up the child.\r\n\r\nForsake him not--your son! Let all your anger fall on me alone--love my\r\nchild! my child! Henry!\r\n\r\n     She kneels before him with the infant in her arms.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_raising her gently from the ground_). Think not of what I have\r\nsaid. Gloomy moments sometimes come upon me, confusion--faintness--\r\n\r\nWIFE. But one word more, I implore! one promise, Henry! that you will\r\nnever cease to love him!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Neither him, nor you--both shall be dear to me--believe me,\r\nMary!\r\n\r\n     He kisses her brow, she embraces him. At that moment a loud clap of\r\n     thunder is heard, followed by strains of music--the chords grow\r\n     ever wilder and more wild.\r\n\r\nWIFE. Hark! What is that?\r\n\r\n     She presses the child closely to her bosom. The music ceases.\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN (_entering_). O my beloved, I bring thee joy and peace: come,\r\nfollow me! Throw off the earthly fetters which enchain, thee, O my love,\r\nand follow me! I have sought thee from a new world of endless bliss, in\r\nwhich night never comes--ah! I am only thine!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Save me, holy Mother of God!\r\n\r\nThis ghost is ghastly pale--its eyes are dying out--its voice is hollow\r\nas the rolling of the death-hearse with the corpse!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thy white brow glitters; thy fair head is wreathed with\r\nflowers, O beloved!\r\n\r\nWIFE. A white shroud hangs in tatters from the shoulders to the feet!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Around and from thee rays the light of heaven! but once to hear\r\nthy voice--then die!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. She who restrains and impedes thee is but an illusion; her\r\nlife a passing breath; her love a dying leaf, to fall with thousands of\r\nits fellows at the first chill breath, lost and withered--but I will\r\nendure forever!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Henry--Henry! hide me! Oh do not leave me! the air is filled with\r\nsulphur, heavy with the breath of the grave!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Envy not, nor slander, O woman of dust and clay! Behold the\r\nIdeal in which God created you--His first thought of what you were meant\r\nto be. But following the counsel of the serpent, you became what you now\r\nare!\r\n\r\nWIFE. I will never leave you!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Beloved, I forsake my house, my all, and follow thee!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Henry! Henry! Henry!\r\n\r\n     She falls to the floor in a fainting fit, with the child in her\r\n     arms; loud and repeated claps of thunder are again heard.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The baptism. Guests. Father Benjamin. The Godfather and Godmother.\r\n     The nurse with the child in her arms; the Wife seated upon the\r\n     sofa. Retainers and servants in the background.\r\n\r\nFIRST GUEST. I wonder where the count is hiding.\r\n\r\nSECOND GUEST. Perhaps he has been accidentally detained, or he may be\r\nwriting verses.\r\n\r\nFIRST GUEST. How pale and tired the countess looks, and as yet she has\r\nspoken to no one.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GUEST. This christening reminds me of a ball which I once\r\nattended; the host had just lost his whole estate at cards, and was a\r\ncomplete bankrupt, while he continued to receive his many guests with\r\nthe courtesy of despair.\r\n\r\nFOURTH GUEST. I left my lovely princess, and came here, because I\r\nthought to play my part at a gay breakfast; but I am disappointed, for\r\nit seems to me that I am, as the Scripture hath it, in the midst of\r\n'wailing and gnashing of teeth.'\r\n\r\nFATHER BENJAMIN. George Stanislaus, wilt thou receive holy unction?\r\n\r\nGODFATHER AND GODMOTHER. I receive it.\r\n\r\nA GUEST. Look! look! the countess rises from the sofa, and comes slowly\r\nforward as if in a dream!\r\n\r\nANOTHER GUEST. How she reels and totters--poor thing! She is advancing\r\nto the infant--how deadly pale she grows!\r\n\r\nTHIRD GUEST. Shall I offer her my arm? She looks as if about to faint--\r\n\r\nFATHER BENJAMIN. George Stanislaus! wilt thou renounce the devil and all\r\nhis works?\r\n\r\nGODFATHER AND GODMOTHER. I renounce them.\r\n\r\nA GUEST. Hush! the countess--look!\r\n\r\nWIFE (_laying her hand softly on the head of the infant_). Where is thy\r\nfather, tell me, George?\r\n\r\nFATHER BENJAMIN. I beg that the ceremony may not be interrupted.\r\n\r\nWIFE. Bless thee, George! I bless thee, my son! Become a poet, that thy\r\nfather may love thee, and never desert thee, George!\r\n\r\nGODMOTHER. I conjure you, my dear Mary!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Become a poet! that thus thou mayst serve thy father, mayst please\r\nhim, and then he will forgive thy mother, and return--\r\n\r\nFATHER BENJAMIN. For the love of God, countess!\r\n\r\nWIFE. I curse thee, George, if thou becomest not a poet!\r\n\r\n     She falls to the ground in a fainting fit--the servants bear her\r\n     out.\r\n\r\nGUESTS (_whispering among themselves_). All this is very extraordinary.\r\nWhat can have happened here? We had better leave the house immediately.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile the solemn ceremony is completed--the crying infant is\r\n     again placed in his cradle.\r\n\r\nGODFATHER (_standing by the cradle_). George Stanislaus! you have just\r\nbeen made a Christian, and entered into the pale of human society; in\r\nafter years you will also be a citizen, and, through the grace of God\r\nand the wise training of your parents, you may become a great statesman:\r\nremember that you must love your native land; that it is noble and\r\nbeautiful to die for your country!\r\n\r\n     Exit all.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A beautiful landscape, diversified with hills and forests; a\r\n     mountain in the distance.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. That for which I have so long striven, for which I have so\r\nardently prayed, is at last almost within my grasp!\r\n\r\nThe world of men lies far below me; the human pismires there may throng\r\ntheir ant-hills, and struggle on for crumbs and flies--may burst with\r\nrage if they fail to find them, or die with despair if they should lose\r\nthem. I have left all to....\r\n\r\nVOICE OF THE MAIDEN. Here--this way--through--\r\n\r\n     She glides rapidly on.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Hills and mountains overhanging the sea. Clouds, mist, wind, storm.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Where is she gone? The morning breeze dies suddenly away, the\r\nthick mists gather, and the sky grows dark.\r\n\r\nThere! I have gained at last the very top of this steep peak;--heavens,\r\nwhat a frightful abyss yawns before me! How moaningly the wind howls up\r\nthis rocky pass!\r\n\r\nVOICE OF THE MAIDEN (_from a distance_). Come! to me! to me! beloved!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Where art thou? thy voice is almost lost in the distance. How\r\ncan I follow thee through this abyss?\r\n\r\nA VOICE (_in his ear_). Where are thy wings?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Evil spirit, why dost thou mock and torture me? I scorn thee!\r\n\r\nANOTHER VOICE. What! a great, immortal soul, which in a single moment\r\nshould be able to traverse the boundless space of heaven, to faint and\r\nperish at a cliff on the side of a hill! Stout heart! sublime soul,\r\nshuddering, and imploring thy feet to go no farther! poor things!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Appear! Take forms with which I may contend, which may be\r\noverthrown! If I start or quail before you, may _she_ never again be\r\nmine!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN (_from the other side of the abyss_). Seize my hand, and\r\nswing thyself over to me!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What strange change is coming over thee!...\r\n\r\nThe flowers start from thy temples, tear themselves loose from thy hair,\r\nand when thou touchest them, they crawl like lizards, and writhe and\r\nhiss like adders!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. My beloved!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Merciful God! the wind has twisted and torn off thy floating\r\ndrapery; it hangs in squalid rags about thee!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. Why dost thou linger?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. The rain drops from thy heart, and freezes as it\r\nfalls;--skeleton bones look forth from thy bosom!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. Thou hast promised, hast sworn!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. The lightning has burned out the apples of thine eyes!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF EVIL SPIRITS. Old Satan, welcome back to hell! Thou hast\r\nseduced and ruined a mighty spirit, admired by men, a marvel to itself.\r\n\r\nSublime soul, haughty heart--follow thy beloved!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Wilt thou then damn me, O my God! because I have believed that\r\nThy Beauty far surpassed the loveliness of earth; because I have left\r\nall to follow it; and have suffered for it until I have grown the very\r\njest of devils?\r\n\r\nEVIL SPIRIT. Hear, brothers, hear!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. The last hour strikes! the storm whirls in black and\r\never-widening circles--the sea is breaking and dashing higher and higher\r\nagainst the rocks, and as it mounts them, draws me on--an invisible\r\npower urges me forward--nearer--ever nearer--bands of men advance from\r\nbehind upon me--mount my neck--and plunge me into the abyss!\r\n\r\nEVIL SPIRIT. Rejoice, brothers, rejoice! He comes!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. It is vain to struggle; useless to combat! the giddy bliss of\r\nthe abyss draws me on--my head is dizzy--the plunge is inevitable--my\r\nbrain whirls!--O God!--Thy fiend has conquered!\r\n\r\nTHE GUARDIAN ANGEL (_floating over the sea_). Peace, ye waves! Be still!\r\n\r\n     At this very moment of time the holy water of baptism is poured\r\n     upon the head of the infant, George Stanislaus.\r\n\r\nGUARDIAN ANGEL. Return to thy house: and sin no more!\r\n\r\nReturn to thy house: and love thy child!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The saloon with the piano. The Man enters, and a servant follows\r\n     with a light.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Where is the countess?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. My lady is ill.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. She is not in her chamber; I have been there, and found it\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. The countess is not here, my lord.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Has she left the castle? Where is she to be found?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. They came for my lady yesterday, and carried her away.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Answer at once, and tell me where they have taken the countess!\r\n\r\nSERVANT. To the madhouse!\r\n\r\n     He rushes out.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Hear me, answer me, Mary!\r\n\r\nAh, I know you are only hiding for a moment to punish me for my\r\ndesertion; but I suffer, Mary!\r\n\r\nMary, my own Mary, in pity speak!\r\n\r\nNo--it is not so. She is not here, or she would answer to my cries.\r\n\r\nJohn! Caroline! nurse!\r\n\r\nThe whole house seems deaf and dumb!\r\n\r\nBut what he has just told me, is not, cannot be true; it would be too\r\nhorrible!\r\n\r\nAh! I have never wished to wrong any human being; I would have made the\r\nwhole world happy; yet I have plunged the woman who trusted herself to\r\nme, the innocent creature whom I swore to love and guard, into the hell\r\nof those already damned on earth!\r\n\r\nI blast all upon whom I breathe; and am doomed to destroy myself also!\r\nHell has only released me for a few hours, that I might present to men\r\nits living image upon earth!\r\n\r\nUpon what a pillow of horror will she lay to-night her helpless head!\r\nwith what harmonies have I surrounded her in the darkness?--the wild\r\nshrieks and howls of madmen in their cells!\r\n\r\nI see her there! that brow so calm, so innocent, upon which no harsh\r\nthought ever rests, is sunk and buried in her little hands. Her pure\r\nthoughts wander idly now through space; they rove in search of the\r\nhusband who deserted her--and the unfortunate weeps--and is mad! mad!\r\n\r\nA VOICE. Poet! thou chant'st a Drama!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Ha! the voice of my evil spirit!\r\n\r\n     He hurries to the door of the saloon and tears it open.\r\n\r\nHaste! saddle my Arabian, and bring me my cloak and pistols!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A hilly country. An asylum for the insane, surrounded by a garden.\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF THE PHYSICIAN. (_She is seen opening a barred door, and\r\nwears a great bunch of keys at her girdle._) Are you a relation of the\r\ncountess?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I am a friend of the count's; he sent me here.\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF THE PHYSICIAN. We have indeed but little hope of her\r\nrecovery. I am sorry my husband is not at home; he could have explained\r\nthe whole case to you. She was brought here in convulsions\r\nyesterday--how very hot it is to-day!\r\n\r\n     Wiping the perspiration from her face.\r\n\r\nWe have a great many patients here, but none so ill as the countess.\r\n\r\nOnly think of it--this asylum costs us two hundred thousand--but you are\r\ngrowing impatient--tell me, is it true that the Jacobins seized her\r\nhusband at midnight, and thus drove her mad?\r\n\r\nI beg you....\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A room with a grated window. A bed, a chair. The Wife is lying upon\r\n     a sofa, supported by pillows.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (entering). I wish to be left alone with the countess.\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF THE PHYSICIAN (_without_). My husband will be very angry\r\nif....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_closing the door_). Leave us in peace!\r\n\r\n     Approaches his wife.\r\n\r\nVOICE (_from the ceiling_). You have chained and fettered God himself!\r\nYou have already put one God to death on the cross; I am the second, and\r\nyou have given me into the hands of the headsman.\r\n\r\nVOICE (_under the floor_). Kneel down before the King, your Lord!\r\n\r\nVOICE (_from the wall on the left_). The comet tracks its way in fire\r\nacross the sky; the day of wrath already breaks--the trump of Judgment\r\nsounds!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Mary--do you know me?\r\n\r\nWIFE. I have sworn to be true to you until death.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Give me your hand, Mary. Let us quit this dreadful place!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Yes, but I cannot stand up--my soul has left my body, and is all\r\nburning, blazing, in my brain.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I can carry you in my arms to the carriage, which is waiting\r\nfor you at the door; I want to take you home, Mary!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Yes, we will go home. But you must wait for me; leave me for a\r\nlittle while, and I will become worthy of you, Henry!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I do not understand you, Mary.\r\n\r\nWIFE. Ah! I have prayed through weary days and endless nights; at last\r\nGod heard me, and smiled upon me!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I know not what you mean, Mary!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Listen, Henry! After you left me, a great change came upon my\r\nspirit, and I felt what was wanting to make you love me. I cried to God\r\nunceasingly; I struck my breast; I placed a blessed candle on my bosom;\r\nI did penance; I said: 'Lord God be merciful unto me! Oh send down upon\r\nme the spirit of Poetry, that I may be loved!'\r\n\r\nAnd on the third day I was a Poet!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Mary!\r\n\r\nWIFE. You will no more despise me; no longer leave me to my lonely\r\nevenings; for I am full of inspiration, a Poet, Henry!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Never! never!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Look upon me! have I not grown like yourself? I understand\r\neverything now; I can explain and describe all that is: I chant the sea,\r\nthe stars, the clouds, battles--yes, stars--seas--storms--but battles?\r\nNo, I have never seen a battle. You must take me to see a battle, Henry.\r\nI must watch men die! I must see and describe a corpse--a shroud--the\r\nnight dew--the moon--a cradle--a coffin:\r\n\r\n  Endless space will spread around me,\r\n    I will seek the farthest star,\r\n  Cleaving swift the air around me,\r\n    Searching beauty near and far.\r\n  Like an eagle onward cleaving,\r\n  All the Past behind me leaving,\r\n  Chaos dark around me lying,\r\n  Through its dimness lightly flying,\r\n  Through its infinite abysses,\r\n  On through darker worlds than this is,\r\n  Farther--farther--ringing--ringing--\r\n  Sounds the curse my soul is singing....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Horrible! horrible!\r\n\r\nWIFE (_throwing her arms round him, and resting her head on his bosom_).\r\nMy Henry! my Henry! I am so, so happy!\r\n\r\nVOICE (_from below_). I have murdered three kings with my own hand; ten\r\nare still left for the block: a hundred priests still sing mass--\r\n\r\nVOICE (_from the left_). The sun has lost the half of its glory; its\r\nlight is dying; the stars have lost their way, and hurtle each other\r\nfrom their paths--woe! woe!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. The Day of Judgment has already come upon me!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Do not look so sad, Henry. Cheer up, you make me again unhappy!\r\nWhat is the matter? I can tell you something will make you so glad.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Tell me what it is. I will do everything you wish me to do,\r\n\r\nWIFE. Listen! _Your son will be a Poet!_\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What are you saying, Mary?\r\n\r\nWIFE. The priest, when he baptized him, gave him _first_ the name: Poet;\r\nand then: George Stanislaus.\r\n\r\nIt is I who have done this; first I blessed him--then I affixed a curse\r\nto the blessing: I know he will be a Poet!\r\n\r\nVOICE (_from above_). Father, forgive them; they know not what they do!\r\n\r\nWIFE. There is some one above us, suffering from strange and incurable\r\nmadness; is it not so?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Very strange.\r\n\r\nWIFE. He does not know what he is saying; but I can tell you how it\r\nwould all be if God should go mad.\r\n\r\n     She seizes him by the hand.\r\n\r\nAll the worlds would go flying about, up and down, and crash against one\r\nanother: every worm would cry out: 'I am God!' and then some of them\r\nwould die every moment; they would all perish one after the other!\r\n\r\nAll the comets and suns would go out in the sky! Christ would redeem us\r\nno longer; He would tear His bleeding hands away from the nails, and\r\npitch the cross into the bottomless abyss. It falls!\r\n\r\nListen! how this cross, the hope of millions, goes crashing and hurtling\r\nagainst the stars! Hark! it breaks! it flies asunder! the sky grows dark\r\nwith the ruined fragments--they fall like hail, deeper, deeper--a wild\r\nstorm surges from them--dreadful!\r\n\r\nThe holy Mother of God alone continues to pray, and the faithful stars,\r\nher servants, which have not yet deserted her:--but she too will plunge\r\nwhere all created things are storming down, for God is mad--and Christ\r\nhas thrown away His Cross!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Mary, will you not come home with me to see our child?\r\n\r\nWIFE. I have given wings to our son, and dipped him under the waves of\r\nthe sea, that he might take into his soul all that is beautiful,\r\nsublime, and terrible. He will return to you a poet, and you will\r\nrejoice in him.\r\n\r\nAh me! ah me!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Do you suffer, Mary?\r\n\r\nWIFE. Some one has hung up a lamp in my brain--and the light sways and\r\nflickers--I cannot bear it!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. My beloved Mary, be calm and tranquil, as you were wont to be!\r\n\r\nWIFE. Poets never live long.\r\n\r\n     She faints.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Help! Save her! Help!\r\n\r\n     Several women rush in.\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF THE PHYSICIAN. Pills--powders--no. She can swallow nothing\r\nsolid; a fluid potion is the best.\r\n\r\nMargaret, run for the apothecary!\r\n\r\n     Speaking to the Count.\r\n\r\nThis is all your fault, and my husband will be very angry.\r\n\r\nWIFE. Henry, my Henry, farewell!\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF THE PHYSICIAN. You are then the count!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Mary! Mary!\r\n\r\n     Takes her in his arms.\r\n\r\nWIFE. I am well--happy! I die near thee!\r\n\r\n     Her head sinks upon his breast.\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF THE PHYSICIAN. Her face grows crimson--the blood is rushing\r\nto her brain.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Her pure heart breaks--nor love nor wrong can ever reach her\r\nmore! O Mary! Mary!\r\n\r\n     The Physician enters and approaches the sofa.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. It is all over now: she is dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND REFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nA TORCHER.\r\n\r\nWhat of the common lot of woman in the state hymeneal? Echo: High\r\nmenial!\r\n\r\nBRIDAL.\r\n\r\nWhat does the world consider a proper tie? Echo: Property!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the fifteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord one\r\nthousand eight hundred and sixty-four, the following resolution, which\r\nhad already passed the Senate, was put upon its final passage in the\r\nHouse of Representatives as a joint resolution of Congress, to be\r\nproposed to the people of the United States for an amendment to the\r\nConstitution:\r\n\r\n     'SECTION 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a\r\n     punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\n     convicted, shall exist in the United States, or any place subject\r\n     to their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n     'SECTION 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\n     appropriate legislation.'\r\n\r\nThe resolution was rejected for failure of the two-thirds vote required\r\nby the Constitution on a question of amendment; the vote standing, yeas\r\nninety-four, nays sixty-five. Which vote has definitely determined two\r\nthings: first, that the party which calls itself Democratic is afraid to\r\ntrust this question to the people, and so belies its honored name; and\r\nsecondly, that there is a political element in our country whose\r\nattachment to the slaveholding interest survives the attachment of the\r\nslaveholding interest to the Union. Is this the best evidence of\r\npatriotism?\r\n\r\nThree years ago this summer of 1864, even after the treason of Southern\r\nleaders had precipitated the flagrant Southern rebellion, ay, and even\r\nafter treason had dared the loyal army of the nation and flaunted its\r\ndefiant banner on the field of battle, the sentiment of a forbearing\r\npeople declared that no interference with the local establishments of\r\nthe treason-infected South would be permitted. So faithful were we to\r\nthe compromises of our fathers; so loth to believe in the wicked purpose\r\nthat had moved the rebellion. Three years of desperate resistance to the\r\nnation's authority, three years of war, with its lessons of bitterness,\r\nand grief, and death, and agony worse than death, have convinced us that\r\nno further compromise is possible. Men told us so before, but we were\r\ntoo devoted to the Union to believe in a treason that would not stop\r\nshort of the nation's complete dishonor. God be thanked that we know the\r\nissue at last! Our conviction has gradually, but how immovably,\r\nestablished itself! And now the sentiment of the people, no longer\r\nforbearing, but not less just, and based upon the same unalterable\r\ndevotion to the Union, withdraws the pledges of the past and dictates an\r\namendment to the Constitution that shall leave no possibility of\r\nslaveholding treason hereafter. That sentiment has found expression in\r\ntwo mass conventions, representing the undoubted overwhelming majority\r\nof the people, and it remains now to show the justice of it. It is\r\naccordingly the purpose of this paper to discuss the nature of the\r\nproposed amendment, and to state some controlling reasons in favor of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe question, plainly stated, is: Ought the Constitution to be amended\r\nso as to abolish slavery throughout the United States? Or, in other\r\nwords, Ought liberty to become part of the supreme law of the land?\r\nOught the idea of the nation to be now, at last, incorporated into the\r\nlaw of the nation, and so made a fixed fact of the nation's history?\r\n\r\nIt should seem that the mere statement of the question suggests the\r\nbasis and positive force of the affirmative of it. For it reminds us at\r\nonce of the mighty revolution that has agitated and aroused it. The\r\nprogress of a century has been crowded into less than a decade of years.\r\nThe statesmanship of 1850 (profound and patriotic, as alas! it is to be\r\nfeared, too much of what we call statesmanship to-day is not) has been\r\noutgrown. Let us not be startled by the statement. The highest art of\r\npolitics is to recognize existing facts. No thinking person will deny\r\nthat the policies of the past are powerless to-day. We cannot, if we\r\nwould, unmake the history of the last ten years. _Tempora mutantur, et\r\nmutamur in illis_. Or, as a distinguished and eloquent son of Tennessee\r\nlately paraphrased this old maxim: 'The world moves, and takes us along\r\nwith it, whether we will or not.'\r\n\r\nOur discussion naturally divides itself into two branches: first, as to\r\nthe right, or constitutional power, to adopt the proposed amendment; and\r\nsecondly, as to the expediency and necessity of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE RIGHT, UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, TO ADOPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\nNo characteristic of the American people is more marked than their\r\nregard for law; and in nothing is that characteristic more striking than\r\nin their respect for the Constitution, the supreme law of the land.\r\nWhatever seems to come in conflict with that supreme law must encounter\r\nan irresistible odium. And herein appears the splendid fruit of the\r\nteachings of our great legists and statesmen, enforced, as they are, by\r\nthe hereditary traditions of our Anglo-Saxon birthright. It is,\r\nmoreover, a standing proof that democracy is not necessarily radical and\r\ndestructive; and so furnishes us with a complete answer to the\r\nassumptions of English Tories, as in Alison's 'History of Europe,' that\r\ndemocracy is but the organized exponent of the self-willed passions of\r\nthe multitude. What thing, indeed, is more wonderful than the tenacity\r\nwith which conscientious men still cling to the doctrine (that had once\r\nsome reason for it) of constitutional guaranties in behalf of\r\nslavery--an institution that has inspired the most monstrous treason of\r\nall history! What people but the American would still be hesitating,\r\nafter the solemn experience of these three years, to strike down every\r\npossible support to slavery!\r\n\r\nSurely the lesson of the French Revolution, in its trumpet-toned warning\r\nto the nations against a destructive radicalism, has not been lost upon\r\nus. How ought we to adore the Providence, guided by whose inspiration\r\n(as with becoming reverence we may believe) Washington and his\r\nsupporters directed our infant republic in the track of English\r\nconservatism, fearful of the vagaries of the Red Republicanism of\r\nFrance! This prudent policy justifies itself more and more in our\r\nexperience; and to-day the great heart of the people beats in unison\r\nwith those Providential leadings. Therefore it is that the question, in\r\nreference to any measure, Is it constitutional? far from exciting\r\nridicule, as sometimes with superficial thinkers it has done, is to be\r\nrecognized as proof of our magnificent control over the wayward factions\r\nof the hour, and of our abiding trust in the hardly less than inspired\r\nwisdom of our fathers, to which we thus make our ultimate appeal. For\r\nthe Constitution is the organic law of the nation, and stands for the\r\nfirm foundation of our national life. The indissoluble bond of the\r\nUnion, it is itself the palladium of our liberties. It is, in fine, the\r\ngrandest chart of liberty and law, of justice and political order, which\r\nthe world ever saw. The man who dares knowingly violate its provisions\r\nmerits the punishment that followed the sacrilegious touch of David's\r\nservant to the ark of the covenant--instant death. In the midst of a\r\nfierce conflict with traitors who set at nought its binding force, let\r\nus beware lest in our zeal to punish them we be not guilty of an equal\r\ncrime!\r\n\r\nWe yield, then, to no one in our devotion to the Constitution. We will\r\nnot allow that any one goes before us in reverence for it. But we are of\r\nthose who think that the time has come, in the providence of God, for\r\nan amendment to its provisions.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Constitution derives not the least portion of its claim upon\r\nour tender regard from the fact that it recognizes the eternal law of\r\nprogress; and, while establishing a government whose stability should be\r\nas enduring as the principles upon which it is based, does not assume to\r\ndeclare that it has exhausted the possibilities of the future. Guarding\r\nagainst any and every impulse of popular passion, it nevertheless leaves\r\nscope for the necessary changes of time and circumstance, which may make\r\nthe politic statesmanship of one period the exploded fallacy of the\r\nnext. For of the science of politics it may be said, as in the glowing\r\neulogy of Macaulay upon the philosophy of Bacon: 'It is a philosophy\r\nwhich never rests, which has never attained its end, which is never\r\nperfect. Its law is progress. A point which yesterday was invisible is\r\nits goal to-day, and will be its starting-post to-morrow.' Political\r\nscience, indeed, is only another one of those 'illustrations of\r\nuniversal progress,' which the genius of Herbert Spenser has made\r\nfamiliar to our literature. And therefore it is that we cannot too much\r\nadmire the sagacity of the patriots who framed our Constitution. It was\r\na sagacity drawing its inspiration from all history, which taught, and\r\nteaches, that if progress is attempted to be checked, it will find vent\r\nin volcanic revolution. Reformation is the watchword of history: anarchy\r\nand destruction the fate of those nations which heed it not.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the principle of amendment found its way into the\r\nConstitution of the United States--a principle so just that by it we are\r\nenabled in these bitter days to faithfully withstand the usurpation that\r\nseeks to justify itself by appealing to the right of revolution. For in\r\nthe principle of amendment (as has heretofore been stated in this\r\nmagazine) the right of revolution was at the same time recognized and\r\nexalted; and by it a means of war was made a means of peace, and so\r\nrevolution was sought to be forestalled. Nothing but despotism itself\r\nwould have disregarded this humane provision of the Constitution, and\r\nsought a remedy for alleged grievances that is only justified by\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the principle of amendment in our Constitution, and what\r\nare its provisions? They are found in the fifth article, and read thus:\r\n'_The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it\r\nnecessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution_, or, on the\r\napplication of the legislatures of two thirds of the several States,\r\nshall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case,\r\n_shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this\r\nConstitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the\r\nseveral States_, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one\r\nor the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress;\r\nprovided, ... that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of\r\nits equal suffrage in the Senate.'\r\n\r\nCan anything be clearer? And yet how men have contrived to mystify the\r\nwhole question by vague declamation about the rights of States! As if\r\nthose rights of States that were meant to be protected, were not\r\ncarefully guarded by the article itself, and especially by the proviso\r\n'that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal\r\nsuffrage in the Senate'! As if, too, the rights of the States were\r\neverything, the rights of the Nation nothing! It might well be asked,\r\nmoreover (as, indeed, a discriminating writer in _The Evening Post_ has\r\nlately asked), whether the _people_ of the States have no rights that\r\nare to be considered in this discussion; whether there are not certain\r\nreserved rights of the people that have been violated by many\r\nStates--rights reserved in the very constitutions of those States, as\r\nwell as in the Constitution of the United States? But let it be noted,\r\nas above intimated, that this fifth article is duly careful to guard the\r\nrights of States. Three fourths of the States must concur in the\r\namendment; and in no event may a State be unwillingly deprived of its\r\nequal suffrage in the Senate, which is the distinguishing mark of the\r\nindependent equality of all the States in the Union. On the other hand,\r\nthe rights of the States being thus protected in a manner and degree\r\nwhich we must suppose to have been satisfactory to the men who framed\r\nand the States which ratified the Constitution, the article then\r\nproceeds to care for the rights of the Nation, by declaring that the\r\namendment duly ratified by three fourths of the States 'shall be valid,\r\nas part of the Constitution:' thus binding all the States, the three\r\nfourths which have ratified it, and the one fourth which may not have\r\nratified it. We have here a key to the motives of the Southern\r\nrebellion. The leaders of Southern politics knew well that an amendment\r\nlike the one now proposed must one day come, and that whenever it should\r\ncome, article fifth left them no pretext for resistance. So they\r\nprecipitated their revolution, and have only hastened that inevitable\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBut it is objected that the right to amend the Constitution does not\r\ngive us the right to enlarge its powers. Why not? And if not, to what\r\nthings does the right of amendment extend? Such an interpretation makes\r\narticle fifth an absurdity. This objection springs from the same\r\nmischievous doctrine of State sovereignty, which has so outraged the\r\npatriotic common sense of the people by the denial of our right to\r\n'coerce' a State, and tends to the same result--nullification and\r\nsecession. It is good logic for a confederation, but bad logic for a\r\nnation, to say that the articles of its organic law may not be changed\r\nby the will of the people. And let us not neglect to observe in the\r\nprovisions of article fifth the strong incidental proof that the\r\nConstitution of the United States was meant to be the basis of a\r\n_nation_, and not the compact of a _confederation_. For how may this\r\narticle be reconciled with the theory of a compact? _Three fourths_ of\r\nthe States may concur in adopting an amendment that shall be valid as\r\npart of the Constitution, which declares itself to be the supreme law of\r\nthe land, over _all_ the States.\r\n\r\nThis incidental point serves fitly to introduce the second branch of our\r\ndiscussion, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE EXPEDIENCY AND NECESSITY OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\nFor slavery, or, in other words (lest we seem to offend some), a\r\nrebellion in the interests and for the avowed establishment of slavery,\r\nhas struck _at the life of the nation_; and in self-defence the nation\r\nmust strike down slavery. If our Government is only the compact of a\r\nconfederation, then not only is there no need, but we have not the right\r\nto adopt the proposed amendment. For by it an institution fostered by\r\nthe legislation of some of the States would be overthrown, in defiance\r\nof that legislation. But the right, or constitutional power, of itself\r\nimplies the necessity to adopt the amendment whenever the occasion for\r\nit may arise. The right is made part of the Constitution: the necessity,\r\nor expediency, must be determined by circumstances outside of the\r\nConstitution. We contend that circumstances at present point to the\r\ncomplete extinguishment of slavery as the political necessity of the\r\nperiod. The time for timid counsels is past. The day of tenderness for\r\nSouthern prejudices is gone by.\r\n\r\nComing, then, directly to the root of the matter, we lay down this first\r\nproposition:\r\n\r\n1. The proposed amendment finds its justification and highest warrant,\r\nas a measure of political reform, in the _fact of the Southern\r\nConfederacy_. This fact, pure and simple, is the controlling and\r\nabundant necessity for it. We need not take the ground that slavery is\r\nthe cause of the rebellion: though to the philosophical inquirer it\r\ncertainly seems difficult to reach any other conclusion. We Americans\r\nare so much under the influence of partisan prejudices, so surrounded\r\nwith the complications of present and past political issues, that for us\r\na dispassionate study of this point is almost, or quite, impossible. But\r\nthe investigations of impartial and unprejudiced foreigners seem\r\nremarkably to concur in designating slavery as the moving cause of the\r\nwar. We may cite, for example, the recent profound review of the slave\r\npower by Professor Cairnes. And surely no person who pauses to reflect\r\nupon the inherent nature of the slave system as a labor basis of\r\nsociety, will venture to deny that such a principle is at war with the\r\nelemental principles of our Government. No person will deny that slavery\r\ndepreciates the dignity of labor, which is the pride and boast of our\r\ninstitutions. Nor does it need any but the logic of common sense to\r\npoint out the incongruity of a free government resting, even partially,\r\nupon a basis of slave labor.\r\n\r\nBut all this may be waived. We may discard all these considerations.\r\nPerhaps it is wise to discard them. Let us forget our differences of\r\npolitical opinion in the past, and seek for points of agreement in the\r\npresent. Taking this position, we cannot ignore the fact of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, and that the avowed basis of it is slavery. It is a\r\nstubborn fact confronting us at the outset of our inquiry, and, like\r\nBanquo's ghost, 'will not down.' Proclaiming boldly that free labor is a\r\nmistake, and unblushingly affirming as a doctrine of social and\r\npolitical economy that 'capital must own labor,' the Southern\r\nConfederacy challenges the Christian civilization of the age, and\r\ndeclares its right to exist as an independent nation of slaveholders.\r\nHow may we explain so monstrous a pretence? There is but one explanation\r\nthat is adequate. It may be stated in a single word, _ambition_. The\r\nlesson of our experience is that this malignant system of slavery, the\r\nchattel slavery of the South, is too great a temptation to the ambition\r\nof men. Let us not disregard it. Political ambition stands always ready\r\nto strike hands with the devil, and the devil is always near the\r\nconscience of ambitious men. We have no recourse but to remove the\r\ntemptation. The death-knell of Carthage is well appropriated: _Servitudo\r\nest delenda_. So long as a vestige of the slavery establishment remains,\r\nthe temptation remains--a deadly risk to our Government. The peril of it\r\nis too great. And this furnishes a complete answer to the superficial\r\nobjection that there is no need of the amendment because slavery is dead\r\nalready; for ambition may revive it, and what ambition _may_ do it\r\n_will_ do. In other words, and to sum up the argument on this point:\r\nWhatever may have been our individual opinions and beliefs before the\r\nrebellion (variant enough at all times), the attempted establishment of\r\na confederacy avowedly based on slavery, proves beyond possibility of\r\ncavil that chattel slavery, to which we have been lenient without limit,\r\nis a temptation too great for the peace of the nation, and therefore the\r\nhighest interests of the nation require its removal.\r\n\r\n2. The simple fact of the Southern Confederacy is also the basis of our\r\nsecond proposition. For it reveals clearly the necessity of the proposed\r\namendment as a thing essential to be added to the organic law, in order\r\nto carry out the purpose of it. That purpose is thus expressed in the\r\npreamble to the Constitution: 'We, the people of the United States, _in\r\norder to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity_, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United\r\nStates of America.' Every one of the objects therein specified is, in\r\nthe baleful light of the rebellion, a plea for the amendment.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that this preamble has heretofore served as a basis for the\r\nstanchest conservatism, and wisely so. We are of those who have always\r\ncontended that the 'blessings of liberty' are best secured by whatever\r\ntends most to strengthen the Union--the asylum and hope of liberty,\r\nwithout which liberty, disorganized and unprotected, were a vain show.\r\nWe are of that opinion still, and therefore support the amendment,\r\nbecause we are for strengthening the Union and making it 'more perfect.'\r\nWe have not changed: circumstances have changed. What was formerly\r\nconservatism is now radicalism, and radicalism is now the true\r\nconservatism. For the period is one of transition, a crisis period, when\r\nthese two forces, to be of use, must be interfused, and thus become a\r\ncombined power of reform.\r\n\r\nSo long as the cotton and slaveholding interest could be held in check\r\nand kept measurably subordinate to the supremacy of the Constitution,\r\nthere was hope that eventually the steadily-increasing forces of free\r\nlabor would overpower the gradually-decreasing forces of slave labor. It\r\nwas believed that by the silent action of natural laws freedom would, in\r\nthe long run, assert itself superior, and the ideal of our Government,\r\nuniversal freedom, would thus at last become a reality and fact. Such,\r\nwe have been taught to believe, was the doctrine of the statesmanship of\r\n1850. Such was the underlying argument of Webster's great 7th of March\r\nspeech--the enduring monument of his unselfish patriotism, seeking only\r\nthe good of his whole country. Such was his meaning when he declared\r\nthat the condition of the territories was fixed by an 'irrepealable\r\nlaw,' needing no irritating legislation to assure their freedom.\r\n\r\nContrary to the hopes of our fathers, the slave system had prospered and\r\ngrown strong--chiefly because of the impetus given to it by the growth\r\nof cotton, as was clearly shown by Webster in the speech just noted. We\r\nsuppose no candid reader of our history will deny this point. But the\r\nsystem had no vital force within itself, and could not withstand those\r\nlaws of nature and free emigration to which we have adverted. It sought\r\nprotective legislation, and got it. Still, it was hampered by\r\nlimitations, notwithstanding it had present control of the cotton\r\ngrowth. So the question of the slave trade was mooted. Thus it came to\r\npass that within half a century after it had expired by limitation of\r\nthe Constitution, that monstrous anomaly of the Christian era was sought\r\nto be revived. And so corrupt had public sentiment become that the slave\r\ntrader captain of the yacht Wanderer could not be convicted by a jury of\r\nhis countrymen of violating the ordinance of the nation against this\r\ntraffic.[8] Will any one dare affirm that the tone of public feeling in\r\nthe South on this subject was not higher and purer in the time of\r\nJefferson than in the time of Buchanan? To what a depth of moral\r\ndegradation the nation might have sunk under the thus retrogressive\r\ninfluences of ungodly Mammon, setting God and Christianity at total\r\ndefiance, may not easily be conjectured. But that law of action and\r\nreaction which balances the powers of nature with such equal justice,\r\nholds good also in the world of mind; and in the providence of God the\r\ntime of reaction came at last, and the temper of the nation reverted to\r\nits pristine purity. That time came when defiant Mammon waxed so bold as\r\nto threaten the nation's life. Under the protective statutes of\r\nCongress, jealously watching over the local institutions of States,\r\nslavery had grown to be a dominating power in the country; and, bound\r\nby legislation and compromise, and the strict letter of the\r\nConstitution, the people could only protest, and bide the inevitable\r\nissue of such arrogant domination.\r\n\r\nNow no longer is slavery dominant. Its own hand has struck down the\r\nprotecting shield of a quasi-constitutional guaranty, and all men feel\r\nthat its condemnation is just. Now there is 'none so poor to do it\r\nreverence.' Why is this? It is the uniform course and consequence of\r\nsin. 'Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,\r\ntherefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.'\r\nBut God has spoken at last in a voice that we must heed. It is the voice\r\nof war, a voice of woe; the voice of civil war, the chief of woes.\r\nSlavery is now at our mercy. And mercy to it is to be measured by our\r\nhumanity to man and our fear of God. 'The word is nigh thee, even in thy\r\nown mouth.' _Servitudo delenda est: deleta est_. Slavery is to be\r\ndestroyed: it is already destroyed. Shall we permit it a chance to be\r\nrevived? The way is opened to us, as it was not to our fathers, to\r\nremove the curse from our borders. We shall be false to every\r\ninspiration of patriotism if we now fail to remove it. The time has come\r\nto complete the unity of the Constitution, and make the ideal purpose of\r\nit, as stated in the preamble, a living fact. Shall we let the\r\nopportunity slip? Now, at last, we may ordain a Constitution by which 'a\r\nmore perfect Union' shall 'secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves\r\nand our posterity.'\r\n\r\n3. A third reason for the proposed amendment, not less cogent though\r\nmore familiar to our political discussions than the two already named,\r\nis found in article fourth, section second, of the Constitution:\r\n'Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the several States.' Everybody knows that this\r\nsection of the Constitution has been heretofore practically a dead\r\nletter, albeit as fully a part of the supreme law as that other\r\nprovision in the same section for the rendition of 'persons held to\r\nservice.' So everybody knows equally well the reason of it. It was a\r\nconcession to the fierce passions of slaveholding politics. From the\r\nvery nature of the case there could not be the same toleration of speech\r\nand press in a Slave State which the men from a Slave State enjoyed in a\r\nFree State. It was incendiary. So for half a century there has been this\r\nvirtual nullification of one of the justest compromises of the\r\nConstitution; and citizens of the United States have, within the limits\r\nof the United States, been tarred and feathered, and burnt, and hung,\r\nand subjected to indignities without number and without name. Nobody\r\nwill probably be willing to say that such a state of things is worthy to\r\nbe continued. The hope of peaceable relief has for long restrained the\r\nhands of a people educated to an abhorrence of war. We have submitted to\r\na despotism less tolerant than the autocracy of Russia, or the\r\nabsolutism of France--hoping, vainly hoping, for some change; willing to\r\nforego all things rather than dissever the Union, which we have held,\r\nand hold, to be foremost, because bearing the promise of all other\r\npolitical blessings; pardoning much to a legacy left the South for which\r\nit was not primarily responsible, and ready to second the humane care of\r\na feeble race, and clinging to the hope of that better time to which all\r\nthe signs pointed, when, by force of freedom, there could be no more\r\nslavery. The time has come, though sooner and under other circumstances\r\n(alas! far other circumstances) than we expected. We need now no longer\r\ngive guaranties to the slaveholding interest. Taking advantage of such\r\nas it had, it has not hesitated to attack its sole benefactor, and now\r\nall our obligations are at an end. The Congress of the nation may and\r\nwill take care that, secession being stifled, there shall not\r\nhenceforth be a nullification of the least provision of the organic law,\r\nout of mistaken tenderness for the interest of any section. We have at\r\nlast learned a nobler virtue than forbearance, and henceforth either the\r\nConstitution, in all its parts, is to be supreme, or else the nation\r\nmust die. One or other of these things must result. Let him who can\r\nhesitate between them write himself down a traitor; for he is one. No\r\npatriot can hesitate. No lover of his country can falter in a time like\r\nthis. And if three years of war have not taught a man that this is the\r\nalternative, that man does not deserve a country.\r\n\r\n4. But there is a more emphatic expression of our fundamental law than\r\nany yet cited; which, if left to its proper working, as now it may be,\r\nstrikes at the root of slavery. It is the fourth section of the fourth\r\narticle of the Constitution. 'The United States shall guarantee to every\r\nState in this Union a republican form of government.'\r\n\r\nThe essence of republicanism is freedom. A republic that, like Sparta,\r\npermits the enslavement of any portion of its people, is surely not\r\npredicated upon the true idea of a republic; and it is worth while to\r\nconsider that the ancient republics found their bane in slavery, and\r\nthat the aristocratic republics of modern times, like Venice, have\r\nperished. Only those republics survive to-day which, like San Marino,\r\nhave free institutions. A republic is a country where the whole people\r\nis the public, and the state the affair of the whole people. It is a\r\n_public affair_ (as its name imports), a thing of the public; and this\r\nis not true of any other than a democracy. For the essential idea of\r\nsuch a government is expressed in the maxim: 'the greatest good to the\r\ngreatest number;' and in that other maxim which is part of our\r\nDeclaration of Independence, that 'government derives its just powers\r\nfrom the consent of the governed.' It needs no argument to show that\r\nthese maxims are violated in a country where any portion of the people\r\nare deprived of their highest good--liberty. For what is the object of\r\ngovernment? To protect men from oppression. And our republican doctrine\r\nis that this is best accomplished in a form of government which gives to\r\nthe voice of all men the controlling power. 'The voice of the people is\r\nthe voice of God,' because humanity is of God. The doctrine is that the\r\nstate is made for the individual, not the individual for the state; just\r\nas our Saviour declared that 'the Sabbath was made for man, not man for\r\nthe Sabbath.' These things being so (and it is not pretended that they\r\nare novel, for they are very trite), does it not immediately appear how\r\nessentially opposed is slavery to the idea of a republic? Therefore when\r\nthe Constitution guarantees to every State a republican form of\r\ngovernment, it guarantees to all the people of every State a voice in\r\nits control. And whatever State disfranchises any portion of its people\r\nviolates this provision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo the objection that, at the time of adopting the Constitution, all the\r\nStates were Slave States, with a single exception, and therefore within\r\nthe meaning of that instrument slavery and a republican form of\r\ngovernment are not incongruous, there are two answers. First, it is\r\nmatter of history that the framers of the Constitution acted throughout\r\nwith reference to the eventual abolition of slavery; as has been already\r\nadverted to in this paper. Therefore such States as have retained their\r\nslave establishments have done so in violation of the spirit of this\r\nprovision of the Constitution; while such States as have since been\r\nadmitted into the Union with slave establishments have been admitted by\r\ncompromises, equally in violation of that provision, but acquiesced in\r\nby the whole country, as the slave establishments of the original\r\nStates had been, and therefore equally binding on our good faith. We are\r\nnow no longer bound by any compromises. We have kept our plighted faith\r\nstrictly and fairly, though the Slave States have not. Our duty now is\r\nto reconstruct, if we can, the fabric of the Union. If, in doing this,\r\nwe abolish slavery entirely, which makes impossible the full realization\r\nof this guaranteeing clause, the guaranty will spring into new life and\r\nbecome a power in the law of the land. Secondly, what is meant by a\r\nrepublican form of government within the meaning of the Constitution\r\nmust be determined by reference to the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich is the basis of our Government, and declares the principles of it.\r\nThat Declaration was promulgated as embodying the doctrines of a new\r\nage--an age in which the rights of man should at last be maintained as\r\nagainst the rights of royalty and privilege. It is, therefore, the\r\nsoundest rule of interpretation to refer the ambiguities of the organic\r\nlaw to the declaration that preceded and introduced it and made it\r\npossible. And so interpreting, will any one say that slavery is\r\ncompatible with the principles of the Declaration of Independence?\r\n\r\nIn support, moreover, of the view here taken, may be cited the opinion\r\nof many of our statesmen, as expressed on the question of admitting new\r\nStates into the Union: as, for instance, when Missouri applied for\r\nadmission with a slave constitution. Nor is it competent to offset this\r\nwith the opinion of such statesmen as have advocated the doctrine of the\r\nVirginia Resolutions of State sovereignty; for they notoriously\r\ndisregarded the paramount supremacy of the Constitution. The\r\nconscientious doubt of others as to making the exclusion of slavery a\r\ncondition precedent to admission into the Union, proves not the\r\nincorrectness of this position, but strengthens it, by showing that only\r\na controlling love of the Union caused the doubt, which originated in a\r\npolicy that would not even seem to do injustice to any State.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be true as to the opinions of the fathers and early\r\nstatesmen of the republic; whatever may be true as to the precise\r\nmeaning of the term 'republican form of government' in the Constitution;\r\nsurely, in the light of our rebellion, there cannot longer be a doubt as\r\nto the inherent antagonism of slavery to the principles of republican\r\ngovernment. The Southern Confederacy sprang into existence as an\r\noligarchy of slaveholders, willing (if need be) to live under a military\r\ndespotism (as is the fact to-day, and will be hereafter if the world\r\nshould witness the dire misfortune of its success), rather than submit\r\nto the searching scrutiny of republican ideas, with freedom of speech\r\nand press and person. And so it is that we recur to the simple fact of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy for the vindication of the proposed amendment\r\nin all its bearings, finding in that fact the full warrant and\r\njustification of it.\r\n\r\n5. There is still another reason for the proposed amendment, that may be\r\nurged with great force, on the ground of expediency; namely, that it\r\nwould settle the whole question of reconstruction in a manner and with\r\nan effect that could not be gainsaid. For, once incorporated into the\r\nfundamental law, there could not then arise questions touching the\r\nvalidity of acts by which slaves are declared freemen. There would be\r\nnothing left to hang a doubt upon. The Proclamation of Emancipation as a\r\nwar measure is undoubtedly a proper proceeding; but as a means of\r\neffecting organic changes, and as possible to operate beyond the period\r\nof actual war, it is open to many grave objections. Freedom being thus\r\nmade the law of the land, there would be no longer reason for\r\ndifferences, as now there are wide differences among conscientious and\r\ncapable men, as to the proper mode of reinvesting the States usurped by\r\nthe rebellion with their rightful powers as kindred republics of the\r\nnation. Constituent parts of a common and indivisible empire, those\r\npowers cannot be destroyed by a usurping rebellion.\r\n\r\nBut, it is objected, the proposed amendment destroys certain of those\r\npowers. Yes, it takes away all pretended right to hold slaves. For the\r\nright of slavery is nowhere recognized in the Constitution. The fact of\r\nslavery as part of the local establishments of some States could not be\r\nignored, although, as is well known, the word 'slave' was expressly\r\nruled out of the Constitution. Hence, the famous provisions for the\r\nrendition of '_persons held to service_' (art. iv. sec. 2), and for the\r\napportionment of representatives and direct taxes, 'by adding to the\r\nwhole number of free persons ... _three fifths of all other persons_'\r\n(art. i. sec. 2): which are the only recognition slavery finds in our\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt is true, therefore, that slavery, never a right, but always a wrong,\r\nunder the Constitution, as under the law of nature and revelation, is\r\nnow to be no longer recognized even as a fact. To abolish it by this\r\namendment is to abolish it entirely throughout the Union, irrespective\r\nof apparent State rights. The repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law remits\r\nthe question of restoring 'persons held to service' to the safeguards of\r\ntrial by jury, but has no further force. To supplement and complete the\r\nwork of reconstruction, we need to make impossible the pretence of a\r\npower anywhere within the domain of the United States to hold a person\r\nin bondage.\r\n\r\nTo the objection we have just noted, that certain State rights are thus\r\ndestroyed, there are two sufficient answers. First, in no State of the\r\nUnion, it is believed, does slavery exist by virtue of positive law. It\r\nis the subject of legislation only as a recognized fact in society. It\r\nexists in Virginia in violation of the Bill of Rights, which is part of\r\nthe organic law of that State, and, in its essential features, of every\r\nslaveholding State. Therefore to abolish it is both to fulfil the duty\r\nof the United States in guaranteeing to every State a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and to assert the only true doctrine of State rights,\r\nnamely, that the legislation of a State shall conform to the fundamental\r\nlaw at once of the State itself and the nation. And thus the Bill of\r\nRights of a slaveholding State will be no longer a mockery, but a living\r\npower. Secondly, the destruction of this pseudo right of a State to hold\r\nslaves is no cause of complaint--even supposing it were a legitimate and\r\nproper right.[9] For, the Constitution once adopted, the provision for\r\namendment, as part of it, has also been ratified and adopted; and\r\ntherefore, by a familiar principle of law, the exercise of that\r\nprovision may not afterward be questioned. It is not for the parties who\r\nhave once solemnly ratified an agreement to complain of the carrying\r\ninto effect of its terms. They must forever hold their peace.\r\n\r\nThus, by virtue of the proposed amendment, all the States of the Union\r\nwill become Free States, and there will be no longer the anomaly of a\r\nfree nation upholding slavery. It will then, moreover, have been settled\r\nby the highest authority in the land, that a republican form of\r\ngovernment means, first of all, freedom; and so a free constitution will\r\nbe the unquestionable condition precedent of the admission of any State\r\ninto the Union. This doctrine will seem monstrous to the believer in\r\nState sovereignty as paramount to the sovereignty of the nation: so it\r\nwill seem monstrous to the believer in secession and rebellion. But by\r\nthe lover of the Union (who alone is the true patriot in our country) it\r\nwill be accepted as a doctrine that adds another bond of unity to the\r\nnation, and so tends to secure its perpetual strength.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the Constitution itself is all bristling with arguments for\r\nthis amendment. Besides the provisions already quoted, there is the\r\nfifth article of the amendments, declaring that 'no person shall be\r\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,'\r\nwhich has now a significance unknown before. Oh, how the rebellion has\r\ninterpreted for us and commented upon the provisions of the\r\nConstitution! In the dread light of its unholy fires, we see, as never\r\nbefore, how cursed and doubly accursed a thing is slavery--making men\r\nforget all that is holiest and sacredest, quenching all their\r\ninspirations of patriotism, and leading them to sell body and soul for\r\nmad ambition. How true, alas! is the poet's word: 'How like a mounting\r\ndevil in the heart rules the unreined ambition!'\r\n\r\nWe _must_, therefore, put an end to slavery. In its whole essence and\r\nsubstance, it militates against the perpetuity of our national Union. To\r\nthink of preserving both it and the Union is to shut our eyes wilfully\r\nto the facts of the last half century, and the culminating condemnation\r\nof slavery in the rebellion. A Southern journal (_The Nashville Times_)\r\nhas lately said, with great truth and force: 'Slavery can no more\r\nviolate the law of its existence and become loyal and law-abiding than a\r\nstagnant pool can freshen and grow sweet in its own corruption.' Discard\r\nall other considerations; say, if we please, that slavery has nothing to\r\ndo with the origin of the war; yet we must recognize the fact of a\r\nconfederacy avowedly basing itself on the system of slavery, and which\r\nis in the interest of slaveholders, and is fostered by the minions of\r\ndespotism all over the world. Then, if we can, let us come to any other\r\nconclusion than the one suggested in the proposed amendment.\r\n\r\nThis confederacy in the interest of slaveholders threatens the life of\r\nthe nation. There is a limit to the powers of the Constitution, and we\r\nmay not pass beyond it. But shall we deny that there is a higher law\r\nback of the Constitution, back of all constitutions--namely, that\r\n'safety of the people,' which is 'the supreme law'? If we say that there\r\nis no such thing as moral government in the world; that a beneficent God\r\ndoes not sit in the heavens, holding all nations as in the hollow of His\r\nhand; yet we cannot deny this law of self-preservation. This law, this\r\nhigher law of human society, the law political, in the very nature of\r\nthings, demands the amendment.\r\n\r\nAbove all, let us not ignore the lessons of the war. The million graves\r\nof the heroes fallen in defence of our liberties and laws, are so many\r\nmillion wounds in the bleeding body of the nation, whose poor, dumb\r\nmouths, if they had voice, would cry out to Heaven against the system\r\nwhich has moved this foul treason against those liberties and laws. Let\r\nus, then, in the white heat of this terrible crisis, adopt the\r\namendment, and stamp on the forefront of the nation, as its motto, for\r\nall time, those magnificent words of Webster: 'Liberty _and_ Union, now\r\nand forever, one and inseparable!' For let us be well assured that the\r\nSouthern Confederacy cannot triumph. In the darkest and most mournful\r\nperiod of the despotism of the first Napoleon, when all hearts were\r\nfailing, a minister of the Church of England spoke these words of the\r\nmilitary empire of France, and they may fitly be spoken of the military\r\nempire of the South to-day:\r\n\r\n'It has no foundation in the moral stability of justice. It is\r\nirradiated by no beam from heaven; it is blessed by no prayer of man; it\r\nis worshipped with no gratitude by the patriot heart. It may remain for\r\nthe time that is appointed it, but the awful hour is on the wing when\r\nthe universe will resound with its fall; and the same sun which now\r\nmeasures out with reluctance the length of its impious reign, will one\r\nday pour his undecaying beams amid its ruins, and bring forth from the\r\nearth which it has overshadowed the promises of a greater spring.'[10]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The writer saw the defiant little yacht lying snug at the Savannah\r\nwharf, in October, 1859--after the trial.\r\n\r\n[9] In the constitution of the _republic_ of Texas (1836), it is\r\ndeclared (sec. 9 of General Provisions), 'All persons of color who were\r\nslaves for life previous to their immigration to Texas, and who are now\r\nheld in bondage, _shall remain in the like state of servitude_.' But in\r\nthe constitution of the _State_ of Texas (1845) there is no such\r\ndeclaration; and article i., the Bill of Rights, sec. 1, declares: 'All\r\npower is inherent in the people.' The foregoing provision of the Texan\r\nconstitution of 1836, is believed to be the only actual establishment of\r\nslavery in any Southern State, and even that has been abrogated, as is\r\nseen, by the State constitution of 1845.

F. V.'s, fitted well to our needs;\r\n  They pranced and they neighed, as if proud of the joys\r\n  Of bearing, not home guards, but Averill's boys.\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n  We dashed on the rail-track, we ripped and we tore;\r\n  We dashed on the depots, made bold with their store;\r\n  Then away, swift away, for 'twas trifling with fire;\r\n  We were far in the foe's depths, and free to his ire.\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n  Fierce Ewell and Early and Stuart and Hill\r\n  Launched forth their fleet legions to capture and kill;\r\n  But we mocked all pursuit, and eluded each toil,\r\n  And drummed unopposed on their dear sacred soil.\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n  We swam icy torrents, climbed wild, icy roads\r\n  Where alone wolf and woodman held savage abodes;\r\n  We floundered down glary steeps, ravine, and wall,\r\n  Either side, where, one slip, and a plunge settled all:\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n  The dark, mighty woods heaved like billows, as o'er\r\n  Burst harsh jarring blasts, and like breakers their roar;\r\n  While clink of the hoof-iron and tinkle of blade\r\n  Made sprinkle like lute in love's soft serenade.\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n  Oh, footsore and weary our steeds at last grew!\r\n  Oh, hungry and dreary the long moments drew!\r\n  We froze to our saddles, spur hardly could ply:\r\n  What of that! we were lucky, and now could but die!\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n  But we wore through the moments, we rode though in pain;\r\n  Were sure to forget all when camp came again;--\r\n  So we rode and we rode, till, hurrah! on our sight\r\n  Burst our tents, as on midnight comes bursting the light!\r\n    Three cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs much interest is manifested for increased knowledge of solar\r\ncharacteristics, and as many astronomers and numerous amateurs are daily\r\nengaged in their investigation, I have thought that the experience of\r\nthousands of observations and the final advantages of a host of\r\nexperiments in combination of lenses and colored glasses, resulting\r\nhighly favorably to a further elucidation of solar characteristics,\r\nwould be interesting, especially to such as are engaged in that branch\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\nMy experiments have resulted in two important discoveries. First, by a\r\nnew combination of lenses, I prevent heat from being communicated to the\r\ncolored glasses, which screen the eye from the blinding effects of solar\r\nlight, and thus avoid the not infrequent cracking of these glasses from\r\nexcess of heat, thereby endangering the sight--whereas, by my method,\r\nthe colored glasses remain as cool after an hour's observation as at the\r\ncommencement, and no strain or fatigue to the eye is experienced.\r\nSecondly, the defining power of the telescope is greatly increased, so\r\nthat with a good three-and-a-quarter inch acromatic object-glass, with\r\nfifty-four inches focal length (mine made by Buron, Paris), I have\r\nobtained a clearer view of the physical features of the sun than any\r\ndescribed in astronomical works.\r\n\r\nIn a favorable state of the atmosphere, and when spots are found lying\r\nmore than halfway between the sun's centre and the margin, or better\r\nstill, if nearer the margin, when the spots lie more edgeways to the\r\neye, I can see distinctly the relative thickness of the photosphere and\r\nthe underlying dusky penumbra, which lie on contiguous planes of about\r\nequal thickness, like the coatings of an onion. When these spots are\r\nnearer the centre of the sun, we see more vertically into their depths,\r\nby which I frequently observe a third or cloud stratum, underlying the\r\npenumbra, and partially closing the opening, doubtless to screen the\r\nunderlying globe (which, by contrast with the photosphere, is intensely\r\nblack) from excessive light, or to render it more diffusive.[11] The\r\nconcentric faculae are then plainly visible, and do not appear to rise\r\nabove the surface of the photosphere (as generally described), but\r\nrather as depressions in that luminous envelope, frequently breaking\r\nentirely through to the penumbra; and when this last parts, forms what\r\nare called 'spots.' The delusion in supposing the faculae to be elevated\r\nridges, appears to me to be owing to the occasional depth of the faculae\r\nbreaking down through the photosphere to the dusky penumbra, giving the\r\nappearance of a shadow from an elevated ridge. What is still more\r\ninteresting, in a favorable state of the atmosphere, I can distinctly\r\nsee over the _whole_ surface of the sun, not occupied by large spots or\r\nby faculae, a network of pores or minute spots in countless numbers, with\r\ndividing lines or faculae-like depressions in the photosphere, separating\r\neach little hole, varying in size, some sufficiently large to exhibit\r\nirregularities of outline, doubtless frequently combining and forming\r\nlarger spots.[12] When there are no scintillations in the air, the rim\r\nor margin of the sun appears to be a perfect circle, as defined, in\r\noutline, as if carved. By interposing an adjusted circular card, to cut\r\noff the direct rays of the sun, thus improvising an eclipse, not a stray\r\nray of light is seen to dart in any direction from the sun, except what\r\nis reflected to the instrument, diffusively, from our atmosphere; thus\r\nproving that the corona, the coruscations or flashes of light, seen\r\nduring a total or nearly total eclipse of the sun by the moon, are not\r\nrays direct from the sun, but reflections from lunar snow-clad\r\nmountains, into her highly attenuated atmosphere. Solar light, being\r\nelectric, is not developed as light until reaching the atmosphere of a\r\nplanet or satellite, or their more solid substance, which would explain\r\nwhy solar light is not diffused through space, and thus account for\r\nnocturnal darkness.\r\n\r\nThe combination of glasses which enabled me to inspect the above details\r\nmay be stated briefly thus: In the place of my astronomic eyepiece, I\r\nuse an elongator (obtainable of opticians) to increase the power. Into\r\nthis I place my terrestrial tube, retaining only the field glasses, and\r\nusing a microscopic eyepiece of seven eighths of an inch in diameter.\r\nOver this I slide a tube containing my colored glasses, one dark blue\r\nand two dark green, placed at the outer end of the sliding tube, one and\r\na half inches from the eyeglass. The colored glasses are three quarters\r\nof an inch in diameter, and the aperture next the eye in diameter half\r\nan inch. The power which I usually employ magnifies but one hundred and\r\nfifty diameters; and I use the entire aperture of my object glass. This\r\ncombination of colored glasses gives a clear dead white to the sun, the\r\nmost desirable for distinct vision, as all shaded portions, such as\r\nspots, however minute, and their underlying dusky penumbra, are thus\r\nbrought into strong contrasts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Imagine an immense sphere enclosed within two contiguous and\r\nequally thin envelopes, and yet sufficiently thick to show their edges\r\ndistinctly when broken; the outer, a photosphere, having an intensely\r\nbright surface, and the inner, or penumbra, of a dull gray surface;\r\nwhile the enclosed hollow space is all dark, with the exception of an\r\noccasional fleecy cloud, floating within, and contiguous to the inner\r\nenvelope. Now remove a large irregular piece from the outer, and a\r\nsmaller piece from the inner envelope, and you have an exact idea of the\r\nappearance of a spot; contrasting the comparative brilliancy of the\r\nphotosphere with the penumbra; their relative thickness; the intense\r\nblackness within, and occasional cloud stratum floating beneath the\r\nopening, as seen, under the most favorable circumstances, with a good\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] The Nasmyth willow-leaf appearance, I think, is either the result\r\nof imperfect vision, defective instruments, or unfavorable state of the\r\nair, distorting the unvarying result of my observations, as above\r\ndescribed, which have been a thousand times repeated in our clearer\r\natmosphere, both on the coast and interior mountain regions. My\r\nobservation of a general pore-like character, over the whole surface of\r\nthe photosphere of the sun, is, I think, corroborated by considering the\r\nspots, as usually known and visible with ordinary instruments, as merely\r\ngreater pores of the same general character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARMY: ITS ORGANIZATION AND MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\n_FOURTH PAPER_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous papers we have briefly related the history of the art of war\r\nas now practised, stated the functions of the principal staff\r\ndepartments, and mentioned some of the peculiar features of the\r\ndifferent arms of military service. It remains to describe the\r\noperations of an army in its totality--to show the methods in which its\r\nthree principal classes of operations--marching, encamping, and\r\nfighting--are performed.\r\n\r\nThe first necessity for rendering an army effective is evidently\r\nmilitary discipline, including drill, subordination, and observance of\r\nthe prescribed regulations. The first is too much considered as the\r\ndevotion of time and toil to the accomplishment of results based on mere\r\narbitrary rules. The contrary is the truth. Drilling in all its\r\nforms--from the lowest to the highest--from the rules for the position\r\nof the single soldier to the manoeuvres of a brigade--is only\r\ninstruction in those movements which long experience has proved to be\r\nthe easiest, quickest, and most available methods of enabling a soldier\r\nto discharge his duties: it is not the compulsory observance of rules\r\nunfounded on proper reasons, designed merely to give an appearance of\r\nuniformity and regularity--merely to make a handsome show on parade.\r\nNothing so much wearies and discourages a new recruit as his drill; he\r\ncannot at first understand it, and does not see the reason for it. He\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n  'I'm sick of this marching,\r\n  Pipe-claying and starching.'\r\n\r\nHe thinks he can handle his musket with more convenience and rapidity if\r\nhe is permitted to carry it and load it as he chooses, instead of going\r\nthrough the formula of motions prescribed in the manual. Perhaps as an\r\nindividual he might; but when he is only one in a large number, his\r\nmotions must be regulated, not only by his own convenience, but also by\r\nthat of his neighbors. Very likely, a person uneducated in the mysteries\r\nof dancing would never adopt the polka or schottish step as an\r\nexpression of exuberance; but if he dances with a company, he must be\r\ngoverned by the rules of the art, or he will be likely to tread on the\r\ntoes of his companions, and be the cause of casualties. Military drill\r\nis constantly approaching greater simplicity, as experience shows that\r\nvarious particulars may be dispensed with. Formerly, when soldiers were\r\nkept up as part of the state pageants, they were subjected to numberless\r\npetty tribulations of drill, which no longer exist. Pipe-clayed belts,\r\nfor example, have disappeared, except in the marine corps. Frederick the\r\nGreat was the first who introduced into drill ease and quickness of\r\nexecution, and since his day it has been greatly simplified and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nOne great difficulty in our volunteer force pertains to the institution\r\nof a proper subordination. Coming from the same vicinage, often related\r\nby the various interests of life, equals at home, officers and men have\r\nfound it disagreeable to assume the proper relations of their military\r\nlife. The difficulty has produced two extremes of conduct on the part of\r\nofficers--either too much laxity and familiarity, or the entire\r\nopposite--too great severity. The one breeds contempt among the men, and\r\nthe other hatred. After the soldier begins to understand the necessities\r\nof military life, he sees that his officers should be men of dignity and\r\nreliability. He does not respect them unless they preserve a line of\r\nconduct corresponding to their superior military position. On the other\r\nhand, if he sees that they are inflated by their temporary command, and\r\nemploy the opportunity to make their authority needlessly felt, and to\r\nexercise petty tyranny, he entertains feelings of revenge toward them. A\r\nmodel officer for the volunteer service is one who, quietly assuming the\r\nauthority incident to his position, makes his men feel that he exercises\r\nit only for their own good. Such an officer enters thoroughly into all\r\nthe details of his command--sees that his men are properly fed, clothed,\r\nand sheltered--that they understand their drill, and understand also\r\nthat its object is to render them more effective and at the same time\r\nmore secure in the hour of conflict--is careful and pains-taking, and at\r\nthe same time, in the hour of danger, shares with his men all their\r\nexposures. Such an officer will always have a good command. We think\r\nthere has been a tendency to error in one point of the discipline of the\r\nvolunteer forces, by transferring to them the system which applied well\r\nenough to the regulars. In the latter, by long discipline, each man\r\nknows his duty, and if he commits a fault, it is his own act. In the\r\nvolunteers, the faults of the men are in the majority of cases\r\nattributable to the officers. We know some companies in which no man has\r\never been sent to the guard house, none ever straggled in marching, none\r\never been missing when ordered into battle. The officers of these\r\ncompanies are such as we have described above. We know other\r\ncompanies--too many--in which the men are constantly straying around the\r\ncountry, constantly found drunk or disorderly, constantly out of the\r\nranks, and constantly absent when they ought to be in line. Invariably\r\nthe officers of such companies are worthless. If, then, the system of\r\nholding officers responsible for the faults of the men, were adopted, a\r\ngreat reform would, in our judgment, be introduced into the service. It\r\nis a well-known fact in the army that the character of a regiment, of a\r\nbrigade, of a division even, can be entirely changed by a change of\r\ncommanders. A hundred or a thousand men, selected at random from civil\r\nlife anywhere, will have the same average character; and if the military\r\norganization which these hundred or thousand form differs greatly from\r\nthat of any similar organization, it is attributable entirely to those\r\nin command.\r\n\r\nPassing to the army at large, the next matter of prominent necessity to\r\nbe noticed is the infusion in it of a uniform spirit--so as to make all\r\nits parts work harmoniously in the production of a single tendency and a\r\nsingle result. This must depend upon the general commanding. It is one\r\nof the marks of genius in a commander that he can make his impress on\r\nall the fractions of his command, down to the single soldier. An army\r\ndivided by different opinions of the capacity or character of its\r\ncommander, different views of policy, can scarcely be successful.\r\nNapoleon's power of impressing his men with an idolatry for himself and\r\na confidence in victory is well known. The _moral_ element in the\r\neffectiveness of an army is one of great importance. Properly stimulated\r\nit increases the endurance and bravery of the soldiers to an amazing\r\ndegree. Physical ability without moral power behind it, is of little\r\nconsequence. It is a well-known fact that a man will, in the long run,\r\nendure more (proportionately to his powers) than a horse, both being\r\nsubject to the same tests of fatigue and hunger. A commander with whom\r\nan army is thoroughly in accord, and who shows that he is capable of\r\nconducting it through battle with no more loss than is admitted to be\r\nunavoidable, can make it entirely obedient to his will. The _faculty of\r\ncommand_ is of supreme importance to a general. Without it, all other\r\nattainments--though of the highest character--will be unserviceable.\r\n\r\nHowever large bounties may have given inducements for men to enlist as\r\nsoldiers, it is undeniable that patriotism has been a deciding motive.\r\nUnder the influence of this, each soldier has entertained an ennobling\r\nopinion of himself, and has supposed that he would be received in the\r\ncharacter which such a motive impressed on him. He has quickly\r\nascertained, however, when fully entered on his military duties, that\r\nthe discipline has reduced him from the position of an independent\r\npatriot to that of a mere item in the number of the rank and file.\r\nMilitary discipline is based on the theory that soldiers should be mere\r\nmachines. So far as obedience is concerned, this is certainly correct\r\nenough; but discipline in this country, and particularly with\r\nvolunteers, should never diminish the peculiar American feeling of being\r\n'as good as any other man.' On the contrary, the soldier should be\r\nencouraged to hold a high estimation of himself. We do not believe that\r\nthose soldiers who are mere passive instruments--like the Russians, for\r\nexample--can be compared with others inspired with individual pride.\r\nYet, perhaps, our discipline has gone too far in the 'machine'\r\ndirection. To keep up the feeling of patriotism to its intensest glow is\r\na necessity for an American army, and a good general would be careful to\r\nmake this a prominent characteristic of the impression reflected from\r\nhis own genius upon his command. Professional fighting is very well in\r\nits place, and there are probably thousands who are risking blood and\r\nlife in our armies, who yet do not cordially sympathize with the objects\r\nof the war. But an army must be actuated by a living motive--one of\r\npowerful importance; in this war there is room for such a motive to have\r\nfull play, and it is essential that our soldiers should be incited by no\r\nmere abstract inducements, by no mere entreaties to gain victory, but by\r\nexhibitions of all the reasons that make our side of the struggle the\r\nnoblest and holiest that ever engaged the attention of a nation.\r\n\r\nBut we must leave such discussions, and proceed specifically to the\r\nsubject of this paper--the methods of moving an army.\r\n\r\nA state of war having arrived, it depends upon the Government to decide\r\nwhere the _theatre of operations_ shall be. Usually, in Europe, this has\r\nbeen contracted, containing but few _objective points_, that is, the\r\nplaces the capture of which is desired; but in our country the theatre\r\nof operations may be said to have included the whole South. The places\r\nfor the operations of armies having been decided on, the Government\r\nadopts the necessary measures for assembling forces at the nearest\r\npoint, and accumulating supplies, as was done at Washington in 1861. A\r\ncommander is assigned to organize the forces, and at the proper time he\r\nmoves them to the selected theatre. Now commences the province of\r\n_strategy_, which is defined as 'the art of properly directing masses\r\nupon the theatre of war for the defence of our own or the invasion of\r\nthe enemy's country.' Strategy is often confounded with tactics, but is\r\nentirely different--the latter being of an inferior, more contracted and\r\nprescribed character, while the former applies to large geographical\r\nsurfaces, embraces all movements, and has no rules--depending entirely\r\non the genius of the commander to avail himself of circumstances. It is\r\nthe part of strategy, for instance, so to manoeuvre as to mislead the\r\nenemy, or to separate his forces, or to fall upon them singly. Tactics,\r\non the contrary, are the rules for producing particular effects, and\r\napply to details. The strategy of the commander brings his forces into\r\nthe position he has chosen for giving battle; tactics prescribe the\r\nvarious evolutions of the forces by which they take up their assigned\r\npositions. It was by strategy that General Grant obtained the position\r\nat Petersburg; it was by tactics that his army was able to march with\r\nsuch celerity and precision that the desired objects were attained.\r\n\r\nMarches are of two classes--of concentration and of manoeuvre. The\r\nformer, being used merely for the assembling of an army, or conducting\r\nit to the theatre of operations, need but little precision; the latter\r\nare performed upon the actual theatre of war, often in the presence of\r\nthe enemy, and require care and skill for their proper conduct. The\r\ndetails of marches are of course governed by the nature of the country\r\nin which they are performed, but so far as practicable they are made in\r\ntwo methods--by parallel columns, or by the flank. The former is the\r\nmost usual and the most preferable in many respects; indeed, the latter\r\nis never adopted except when compelled by necessity, or for the purpose\r\nof executing some piece of strategy. A careful arrangement of all\r\ndetails by commanders, and a steady persistence in their performance on\r\nthe part of the troops, are required to permit this class of marches to\r\nbe made safely in the presence of an enemy.\r\n\r\nFor the use of an army of a hundred thousand men about to march forward\r\nagainst an enemy, all the parallel roads within a space of at least ten\r\nmiles are needed, and the more of them there are the better, since the\r\ncolumns can thereby be made shorter, and the trains be sent by the\r\ninterior roads. Where a sufficient number of parallel roads exist,\r\navailable for the army, it is usual to put about a division on\r\neach--sometimes the whole of a corps--according to the nature of the\r\ncountry and the objects to be attained. We will attempt to illustrate\r\nthe march of an army by columns in the following diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuppose that E and F are two towns thirty miles apart, and that there\r\nare road connections as represented in the diagram. The army represented\r\nby the dotted line A B, wishes to move to attack the army C D. Cavalry,\r\nfollowed by infantry columns, would be sent out on the roads E M N and E\r\nG I, the cavalry going off toward P and K to protect the flanks, and the\r\ninfantry taking position at I and O. Meantime another column, behind\r\nwhich are the baggage trains, covered with a rear guard, has moved to L.\r\nIf the three points I, L, and O are reached simultaneously, the army can\r\nsafely establish its new line, the baggage trains are entirely\r\nprotected, and the whole country is occupied as effectually as if every\r\nacre were in possession.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a marching column varies according to circumstances,\r\nbut is usually somewhat as follows, when moving toward an enemy:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Skirmishers.\r\n\r\n    Advance guard.\r\n\r\n    Brigade of infantry.\r\n\r\n    Battery of artillery.\r\n\r\n    Main body of infantry.\r\n\r\n    Main body of artillery.\r\n\r\n    Ambulances and wagon\r\n    trains\r\n\r\n    Rear guard.]\r\n\r\nThe dots representing the ambulances and wagon trains do not show the\r\ntrue proportion of these to the rest of the column, and it cannot be\r\ngiven except at too great a sacrifice of space. They occupy more road\r\nthan all the other parts of the column combined. With the advance guard\r\ngo the engineers and pioneers, to repair the roads, make bridges, etc.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and dangers attending a _flank march_ can be made\r\napparent by a diagram:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet A B and C D represent two armies drawn up against each other in\r\nthree lines of battle, on opposite sides of a stream, E F. The commander\r\nof the army A B, finding he cannot cross and drive the enemy from their\r\nworks, determines, by a flank march to the left, to go around them,\r\ncrossing at the point E. In order to effect this he must send his trains\r\noff by the road I K L to some interior line, and then slowly unfold his\r\nmasses upon the single road K E H. By the time the head of his column is\r\nat H the rear has not perhaps left K, and thus the whole length of his\r\narmy is exposed on its side to an attack by the enemy, which may sever\r\nit into two unsupporting portions. It will be perceived that to\r\naccomplish such marches with security, they must be made in secret as\r\nfar as possible, until a portion of the marching force reaches the rear\r\nof the enemy; the column must be kept compact, and great vigilance must\r\nbe exercised. In his progress from the Rapidan to the James, General\r\nGrant made three movements of this character with entire success, each\r\ntime putting our forces so far in the rear of the rebels that they were\r\ncompelled to hasten their own retreat instead of delaying to avail\r\nthemselves of the opportunity for attacking.\r\n\r\nBesides the topography of the country, various circumstances influence\r\nthe manner in which a march is conducted--particularly the position of\r\nthe enemy. When following a retreating foe, the cavalry is sent in the\r\nadvance, supported by some infantry and horse artillery, to harass the\r\nrear guard, and, if practicable, delay the retreat until the main army\r\ncan come up. This was the case in the peninsula campaign, from Yorktown\r\nto the Chickahominy. Again, the exact position of the enemy may not be\r\nknown, or he may have large bodies in different places, so that his\r\nintentions cannot be surmised. It is then necessary to scatter the army\r\nso as to cover a number of threatened points, care being exercised to\r\nhave all the different bodies within supporting distances, and to be on\r\nguard against a sudden concentration of the enemy between them. This was\r\nthe case in the campaign which ended so gloriously at Gettysburg. The\r\nrebels were then threatening both Harrisburg and Baltimore, and the two\r\nextremities of our army were over thirty miles apart, so as to be\r\nconcentrated either on the right, left, or centre, as events might\r\ndetermine. It happened that a collision was brought on at Gettysburg,\r\nand both armies immediately concentrated there. The corps on the right\r\nof our army was obliged to march about thirty-two miles, performing the\r\ndistance in about eighteen or nineteen hours, and arriving in time to\r\nparticipate in the second day's battle. As much skill is evinced by a\r\ncommander in preliminary manoeuvring marches and the assignment of\r\npositions to the different portions of his army as in the direction of a\r\nbattle. Napoleon gained many of his victories through the effects of\r\nsuch manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n_Time_ is a very important element in marching. An army which can march\r\nfive miles a day more than its opponent will almost certainly be\r\nvictorious, for it can go to his flank, or assail him when unprepared,\r\nFrederick the Great achieved his successes by imparting mobility to his\r\ntroops, and Napoleon also was a master of that peculiar feature in that\r\nfaculty of command of which we have before spoken, that enables a leader\r\nto obtain from his men the maximum amount of continued exertion. To\r\nachieve facility in marching, all the equipments of the soldiers should\r\nbe as light as possible, and the columns should be encumbered with no\r\nmore trains than are absolutely indispensable. Officers of the highest\r\nclass must be prepared to forego unnecessary luxuries, and to march with\r\nnothing more than a blanket, a change of clothing, and rations for a few\r\ndays in their haversacks.\r\n\r\nWhen a march is contemplated, orders are issued from the general\r\nheadquarters prescribing all the details--the time at which each corps\r\nis to start, the roads to be taken, the precautions to be observed, and\r\nthe points to be gained. Usually an early hour in the morning is fixed\r\nfor the commencement of the march. If not in the immediate presence of\r\nthe enemy, and a surprise is not intended, the _reveille_ is beaten\r\nabout three o'clock, and the sleepy soldiers arouse from their beds on\r\nthe ground, pack up their tents, blankets, and equipments, get a hasty\r\nbreakfast, and fall into their ranks. If some commander--perhaps of a\r\nregiment only--has been dilatory, the whole movement is delayed. Many\r\nwell-formed plans have been defeated by the indolence of a subordinate\r\ncommander and his failure to put his troops in motion at the designated\r\nhour. Such a delay may embarrass the whole army by detaining other\r\nportions, whose movements are to be governed by those of the belated\r\nfragment. At four o'clock, if orders have been obeyed, the long columns\r\nare moving. Perhaps four or five hours are occupied in filing out into\r\nthe road. While the sun is rising and the birds engaged at their matins,\r\nthe troops are trudging along at that pace of three miles an hour, which\r\nseems so tardy, but which, persisted in day after day, traverses so\r\ngreat a distance. Every hour there is ten or fifteen minutes' halt,\r\nenabling the rear to close up, and the men to relieve themselves\r\ntemporarily of their guns and knapsacks. Soon the heat commences to grow\r\noppressive, the dust rises in suffocating clouds, knapsacks weigh like\r\nlead, and the artillery horses pant as they drag the heavy guns. But the\r\nsteady tramp must be continued till about eleven o'clock, when a general\r\nhalt under the shelter of some cool woods, by the side of a stream, is\r\nordered. Two or three hours of welcome rest are here employed in dinner\r\nand finishing the broken morning's nap. After the intenser heat of the\r\nday is past, the tramp recommences, and continues till six or seven\r\no'clock, when the place appointed for encamping is reached. Soon white\r\ntents cover every hill and plain and valley, the weary animals are\r\nunharnessed, trees and fence rails disappear rapidly to feed the\r\nconsuming camp fires, there is a universal buzz formed from the laugh,\r\nthe song, the shout, and the talking of twenty thousand voices: it\r\ngradually subsides, the fires grow dim, and silence and darkness fall\r\nupon the scene.\r\n\r\nSuch marching, with its twenty, twenty-five, or thirty miles a day, is\r\nlight compared with the harassing fatigues of a retreat, before the\r\npursuit of a triumphant enemy. To accomplish this movement, so as to\r\nsave the organization and the material of an army, without too great a\r\nloss of life, tests in the highest degree the skill of a commander and\r\nthe fortitude of the men. In a retreat, the usual order of marching is\r\nreversed--the trains are sent in the advance, and the troops must remain\r\nbehind for their protection. Often it happens that they are obliged to\r\nremain in line all day, to check by fighting the advance of the enemy,\r\nand then continue their march by night. The dead and wounded must, to a\r\ngreat extent, be left on the field; supplies are perhaps exhausted, with\r\nno opportunity for replenishment; the merciless cannon of the enemy are\r\nconstantly thundering in the rear, his cavalry constantly making inroads\r\nupon the flanks. Weary, hungry, exhausted, perhaps wounded, the soldier\r\nmust struggle along for days and nights, if he would avoid massacre or\r\nconsignment to the cruelties of a prison. The rout of a great army--the\r\ndisorganization and confusion of a retreat, even when well\r\nconducted--the toil and suffering and often slaughter--are the saddest\r\nscenes earth can present. Who can paint the terrors of that winter\r\nretreat of the French from Moscow? Fortunately, in our war we have had\r\nnothing to equal in horrors the retreats of European armies, but no one\r\nwho passed through those trying seven days fighting and marching which\r\nclosed the Peninsula campaign, can ever fail to shudder at the\r\nsufferings imposed on humanity by a retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLATIONS OF LITERARY PROPERTY.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.--LIFE AND CHARACTER OF JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the rights which are ill protected by law, and yet of essential\r\nimportance to the individual and society, are those of literary\r\nproperty. If any bequest should be sacred, it is that of thought,\r\nconvictions, art--the intellectual personality that survives human\r\nlife--and the 'local habitation and the name' whereby genius, opinion,\r\nsentiment--what constitutes the best image and memorial of a life and a\r\nmind, a character and a career, is preserved and transmitted. And yet,\r\nwith all our boasted civilization and progress, no rights are more\r\nfrequently or grossly violated, no wrongs so little capable of\r\nredress, as those relating to literary property. Herein there is a\r\nsingular moral obtuseness a want of chivalry, an inadequate sense of\r\nobligation--doubtless in part originating in that unjust legislation, or\r\nrather want of legislation, whereby international law protects the\r\nproducts of the mind and recognizes national literature as a great\r\nsocial interest. Within a few months, the biography of our pioneer\r\nauthor,[13] whose memory his life and character, not less than his\r\ngenius, had singularly endeared to the whole range of English\r\nreaders--was prepared by a relative designated by himself, who, with\r\nremarkable tact and fidelity, completed his delicate task, according to\r\nthe materials provided and the wishes expressed by his illustrious\r\nkinsman. A London publisher reprinted the work, with eighty pages\r\ninterpolated, wherein, with an utter disregard to common delicacy toward\r\nthe dead or self-respect in the living, unauthentic gossip is made to\r\ndesecrate the reticent and consistent tone of the work, pervert its\r\nspirit, and detract from its harmonious attraction and truth. A greater\r\nor more indecent and unjustifiable liberty was never taken by a\r\npublisher with a foreign work; it was an insult to the memory of\r\nWashington Irving, to his biographer and those who cherish his fame.\r\n\r\nNot many weeks ago, an eloquent young divine, who had in no small degree\r\nsaved the State of California to the Union, by his earnest and constant\r\nplea for national integrity, died in the midst of his useful and noble\r\ncareer: forthwith the publisher of a Review, in whose pages some of his\r\nearly essays had appeared, announced their republication: in vain the\r\nfriends and family of Starr King protested against so crude and limited\r\na memorial of his genius, and entreated that they might be allowed to\r\nglean and garner more mature and complete fruits of his pen, as a token\r\nof his ability and his career; and thus do justice, by careful selection\r\nand well-advised preparation, to the memory they and their fellow\r\ncitizens so tenderly and proudly cherished: no; the articles had been\r\npaid for, the recent death of the writer gave them a market value, and\r\nthe publishers were resolved to turn them to account, however good taste\r\nand right feeling and sacred associations were violated.\r\n\r\nAgain, one of the few legal works of American origin which has a\r\nstandard European reputation is Wheaton's 'International Law.' Its\r\nauthor was eminently national in his convictions; foreign service and\r\npatriotic instincts had made him thoroughly American in his sympathies\r\nand sentiments; no one of our diplomatic agents sent home such\r\ncomprehensive and sagacious despatches, having in view 'the honor and\r\nwelfare of the whole country;' and no one who knew Henry Wheaton doubts\r\nthat, were he living at this hour, all his influence, hopes, and faith\r\nwould be identified with the Union cause.\r\n\r\nYet an edition[14] of his great work has lately appeared, edited in an\r\nopposite interest; and the standard reference on the law of nations, so\r\nhonorable to the legal knowledge, perspicacity, and candor of an\r\nAmerican author, goes forth perverted and deformed by annotations and\r\ncomments indirectly sympathetic with the wicked rebellion now\r\ndevastating the nation. Can a greater literary outrage be imagined? Is\r\nit possible more grossly to violate the rights of the dead?\r\n\r\nAware that certain rules apply to the annotation of legal treatises not\r\nrecognized in other departments of literature, and diffident of personal\r\njudgment in this respect, in order to ascertain how far our sense of\r\nthis violation of literary property and reputation was well founded, how\r\nfar we were right in asserting a partisan aim, we requested an\r\naccomplished lawyer, thoroughly versed in the literature of his\r\nprofession, and experienced as an editor, to examine this edition of\r\nWheaton, and state his own opinion thereof: to him we are indebted for\r\nthe following clear and palpable instances of a perverted use of a\r\nstandard American treatise, endeared to many living friends of the\r\nauthor, and all his intelligent and patriotic countrymen: of the\r\n'additions' to the original by the editor, he says:\r\n\r\n     '1. They indicate considerable reading and industry, but are far\r\n     too voluminous, and abound in extended extracts from speeches,\r\n     state papers, and statutes, which should have been omitted\r\n     altogether, or very much abridged.\r\n\r\n     '2. They contain no language complimentary to the Administration,\r\n     little or nothing in defence of the Government--none that can be\r\n     offensive to Jefferson Davis; and, as a whole, they give the\r\n     impression that he regards the Confederate position as being quite\r\n     as defensible, on the principles of international law, as that of\r\n     the United States.\r\n\r\n     '3. He has no word of censure for Lord John Russell, and no word\r\n     of apology for Mr. Seward. He nowhere calls the Confederates\r\n     _rebels_, and nowhere thinks the conduct of France suspicious or\r\n     unfriendly.\r\n\r\n     '4. His positions are unquestionably the same with those of\r\n     Seymour, Bishop Hopkins, Professor Morse, Judge Woodward, etc.\r\n\r\n     '5. He is everywhere cold--more willing to wound than bold to\r\n     strike; and yet he fretfully commits himself before he gets\r\n     through, in defence of slavery and extreme democratic positions.\r\n\r\n     '6. He does not pretend that he was ever requested by the great\r\n     author with whose productions he has taken such liberties to\r\n     undertake the editorial duties.\r\n\r\n     'His language is so general that one needs to read it carefully to\r\n     feel the full force of what I have said.\r\n\r\n     'In the preface (page 1-20), he speaks of 'Spanish American\r\n     independence, now jeopardized by our _fratricidal_\r\n     contest'--fratricidal is indeed a favorite word; he uses it in an\r\n     offensive sense as regards the United States. Page 99, note, he\r\n     says of slavery, what is utterly untrue, that 'the Constitution\r\n     recognized it as property, and pledges the Federal Government to\r\n     protect it.' The noble act of June 19, 1862, forbidding slavery in\r\n     United States Territories, he comments on in this wise: 'This act\r\n     wholly ignores the decision of the Supreme Court (meaning the Dred\r\n     Scott case) on the subject of slavery.' He then inserts the whole\r\n     act in the note, only to hold it up to censure--'testing it by\r\n     international law' as interpreted by him. At page 605 he denounces\r\n     that law as 'obnoxious not only to the principles of international\r\n     law, but to the Constitution of the United States.' His note and\r\n     extracts, including long extracts from speeches of Thomas, of\r\n     Massachusetts, and Crittenden, of Kentucky, fill more than\r\n     twenty-two pages--reserving a line or two of text at the top. To\r\n     say nothing of the sentiments, such notes are a shameful abuse of\r\n     the reputation and work of Mr. Wheaton, and a perversion of the\r\n     duties and rights of an editor. But a word of the sentiments. He\r\n     exhausts himself and the records of the past in accumulating\r\n     precedents to condemn the policy of freeing slaves as a war\r\n     measure, or of arming them in the nation's defence.\r\n\r\n     'At page 614, in this same note, speaking of the effect of the\r\n     Proclamation of Emancipation, he says: 'The attention of publicists\r\n     may well be called to the withdrawal of the four millions of men\r\n     from the cultivation of cotton, which, is the source of wealth of\r\n     the great commercial and manufacturing nations of Europe.' That is,\r\n     he suggests this as a ground for interference in our affairs on the\r\n     principles of _his_ international law. He further adds that this\r\n     cultivation of cotton is 'by nature a virtual monopoly of the\r\n     seceded States;' that is, nature preordained the negroes to be\r\n     slaves in the seceded States to raise cotton; and hence natural and\r\n     international law require emancipation proclamations to be put\r\n     down. Did Stephens ever go farther? Again, on the same page, he\r\n     says: 'The effect on the United States, _in the event of the\r\n     reestablishment of the Federal authority,_' without the\r\n     Proclamation in force, etc., 'would be _seriously felt_, in its\r\n     financial bearings,' etc.--'abroad as well as at home.' Not\r\n     satisfied, therefore, with suggesting a justification of\r\n     intervention, on the basis of international law, he appeals to the\r\n     cupidity of foreigners as well as natives, by hinting also that\r\n     financial ruin may follow the triumph of Freedom and the Federal\r\n     armies. What a shame that an American editor should use the great\r\n     name of Wheaton to give dignity to such suggestions in foreign\r\n     countries.' He then gives--all in the same interminable note (page\r\n     614)--an extract from _The Morning Chronicle_, of May 16, 1860, of\r\n     which I give you this delicious morsel: 'No blacks, no cotton, such\r\n     is the finality.' At page 609, he speaks of the 'incompatibility of\r\n     confiscation of property with the present state of civilization.'\r\n     At page 609, he quotes, with evident delight, the sanctimonious\r\n     despatch of Lord John Russell about sinking ships in Charleston\r\n     harbor, which his lordship calls a 'project only worthy the times\r\n     of barbarism;' and the American annotator, who could use page after\r\n     page to degrade his own Government for emancipating slaves, of\r\n     course could not be expected to refer to any of the precedents that\r\n     would have silenced Lord John, and have justified the United\r\n     States; and he therefore passes on with no reference to them.\r\n\r\n     'At page 669, Mr. Wheaton says: 'The validity of maritime captures\r\n     must be determined in a court of the captor's Government,' etc.\r\n     This American editor does not so much as allude to the fact, that\r\n     while he is writing, the highways of the ocean are lighted by the\r\n     fires of American merchantmen, plundered, and then burned, without\r\n     condemnation of any court, by vessels fitted out in English ports,\r\n     in open violation of the first principles of international law, and\r\n     which have never been in any port under the jurisdiction of the\r\n     piratical Confederacy!\r\n\r\n     'Some of his indications of sympathy with the rebellion are quite\r\n     in excess of those of Lord John, with whose views, on the whole, he\r\n     seems well enough pleased. For example, at page 254, Lord John is\r\n     quoted as follows: 'Has a commission from the _so-called_ President\r\n     Davis,' etc.; but at page 107 and generally, the American editor,\r\n     not willing to imply that there is any doubt about the reality or\r\n     permanency of the Confederate concern, nor being willing to offend\r\n     its managers, speaks of 'the President of the Confederate States,'\r\n     and 'an act of Congress of the Confederate States,' etc.; and when\r\n     he reaches page 535, as if to set Lord John a better example (and I\r\n     believe there had been some Confederate victories about the time he\r\n     was writing that note), he says: 'A proclamation was issued by\r\n     _President Davis_, on the 14th of August, 1861, ordering all\r\n     citizens adhering to the Government of the United States, etc., to\r\n     depart from the _Confederate States_ in forty days.' It is very\r\n     evident the author approves this order as warranted by\r\n     international law, at least according to his interpretation\r\n     thereof.\r\n\r\n     'Need I go farther to satisfy you of the temper and character of\r\n     the notes, and the views of their author? I can hardly suppress the\r\n     expression of my indignation that such a use should have been made\r\n     of this great national work--that such an opportunity should have\r\n     been lost to say something worthily in favor of colonization and\r\n     freedom, and in vindication of our nation, in its great struggle\r\n     with the relics of barbarism in its midst, and with the selfish and\r\n     ambitious spirits of the European continent, so ready to take\r\n     advantage of our troubles to promote their own schemes.'\r\n\r\nWe now come to another and more generally obnoxious instance of this use\r\nof standard national works for personal or political objects. The\r\n'Federalist,' from the circumstances under which it was written, the\r\ninfluence it exerted, the events with which it is associated, the\r\ncharacter of the writers, and the ability manifest both in their\r\narguments and the style--has long been regarded as a political classic.\r\nIt was the text book of a large and intelligent party at the time of and\r\nlong subsequent to the adoption of the Constitution; and few works of\r\npolitical philosophy, written to meet an exigency and prepare the way\r\nfor a governmental change, have attained so high and permanent a rank\r\namong foreign critics and historians. It is evident that such a work,\r\nwhoever owns the copyright or boasts the authorship, has a national\r\nvalue and interest. To preserve it intact, to keep it in an eligible and\r\naccessible form before the public, is all that any editor or publisher\r\nhas a right to claim. Much has been written as to the authorship of the\r\nrespective papers, and some passages have been variously rendered in\r\ndifferent editions; but the general scope and merit of the work, and the\r\nobvious and unchallenged identity of style and opinion with the\r\nacknowledged authors as regards most of the articles, make the\r\ndiscussions on these points of comparative little significance to the\r\nreader of the present day, who regards the work as a whole, seizes its\r\nessential traits, and is _en rapport_ with its magnanimous tone, so\r\nwholly opposed to petty division of credit in a labor undertaken from\r\npatriotic motives, and by scholars and gentlemen. Enough that we have\r\nhere the reasonings of enlightened citizens, the views of statesmen, the\r\narguments whereby the claims of the Constitution were vindicated.\r\nWhoever is familiar with the history of the period, finds in this\r\nremarkable work a memorable illustration of that rectitude and wisdom\r\nwhich presided over the early counsels of the nation, and an evidence of\r\nthe rare union of sagacity and comprehensiveness, of liberal aspiration\r\nand prudential foresight, of conscientiousness and intelligence, which\r\nhas won for the founders of the republic the admiration of the world. In\r\nthese pages, how much knowledge of the past is combined with insight as\r\nto the future, what common sense is blent with learning, what\r\nperspicacity with breadth of view! Each department of the proposed\r\ngovernment is described and analyzed; the political history of Greece,\r\nRome, the Italian republics, France, and Great Britain examined for\r\nprecedents and illustrations; popular objections answered; popular\r\nerrors rectified; this provision explained, that clause justified; the\r\njudicial, legislative, and executive functions defined; national revenue\r\ndiscussed in all its relations; the advantages of our civil list, of a\r\nrepublic over a democracy in controlling the effects of faction, are\r\nclearly indicated; as are those attending the reservation of criminal\r\nand civil justice to the respective States: on the one hand the defects\r\nof the old Confederacy are stated with emphasis and truth, and on the\r\nother, the transcendent benefits of Federal union are elaborately\r\nargued, and economy, stability, and vigor proved to be its legitimate\r\nfruits. Of the evils of the old system, it is said: 'Let the point of\r\nextreme depression to which our national dignity and credit have sunk,\r\nlet the inconvenience felt everywhere from a lax and ill-administered\r\ngovernment, let the revolt of a part of North Carolina, the memory of\r\ninsurrection in Pennsylvania, and actual insurrection in Massachusetts,\r\ndeclare it.' An unique distinction of this political treatise is that\r\nwhile Pericles, Cato, Hume, Montesquieu, Junius, and other classical and\r\nmodern authorities are cited with scholarly tact, the most practical\r\narguments drawn from the facts of the hour and the needs of the people,\r\nare conveyed in language the most lucid and impressive. To give a\r\ncomplete analysis of the 'Federalist' would require a volume; the glance\r\nwe have cast upon its various topics sufficiently indicates the extent\r\nand importance of the work. Not less memorable is the spirit in which it\r\nwas undertaken. 'A nation without a national government,' it is said,\r\n'is, in my view, an awful spectacle;' and elsewhere--'The establishment\r\nof a constitution in times of profound peace, by the voluntary consent\r\nof a whole people, is a prodigy, to the completion of which I look\r\nforward with trembling anxiety.' 'I dread,' writes Jay, 'the more the\r\nconsequences of new attempts, because I know that powerful individuals\r\nin this and in other States are enemies to a General National Government\r\nin every possible shape.'\r\n\r\nUnder such a sense of responsibility, with such patriotic solicitude did\r\nHamilton, Madison, and Jay plead for the new Constitution with their\r\nfellow citizens of New York in the journals of the day, and it is these\r\nfragmentary comments and illustrations which, subsequently brought\r\ntogether in volumes, constitute 'the Federalist'; and well did they,\r\ntoward the close of the discussion, observe: 'Let us now pause and ask\r\nourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed\r\nConstitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions\r\nthrown upon it, and whether it has not been shown worthy of the public\r\napprobation and necessary to the public safety and prosperity.' Whatever\r\ndegree of sympathy or antagonism the intelligent reader of the\r\n'Federalist' may feel, he can scarcely fail to admit that it is a\r\nmasterly discussion of principles, and that the influence it exerted in\r\nsecuring the ratification of the Constitution in the State of New York,\r\nwas a legitimate result of intelligent and conscientious advocacy. But\r\nthe work has other than merely historical and literary claims upon our\r\nesteem at this hour. Its principles find confirmation here and now, in a\r\ndegree and to an extent which lends new force and distinction to its\r\nauthors as writers of political foresight and patriotic prescience.\r\nThere are innumerable passages as applicable to the events of the last\r\nthree years as if suggested by them; there are arguments and prophecies\r\nwhich have only attained practical demonstration through the terrible\r\nordeal of civil war now raging around and in the heart of the republic.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw the announcement of a new edition[15] of this national work,\r\nwe hailed it as most seasonable and desirable: when the first volume\r\ncame under our notice, our first feeling was one of gratitude to the\r\neditor for having taken such care to reproduce the work with the\r\ngreatest possible correctness of text, obtained by patient collation of\r\nthe different editions: regarding his labors as those of a disinterested\r\nhistorical student, ambitious to bring before the public a work full of\r\nwarning and wisdom for this terrible national crisis, we at first saw in\r\nhis annotations and comments only the labor of love whereby a standard\r\nwork is illustrated and made more emphatic and complete: but, ere long,\r\nwe found a spirit of detraction at work, a want of sympathy with the\r\ntone and a want of understanding of the motives of the authors, which\r\nmade us regret that, instead of this partisan edition, the 'Federalist'\r\nhad not been reissued with a brief explanatory introduction, and without\r\nnote or comment.\r\n\r\nInstead of a hearty recognition, we find a narrow interpretation of\r\nthese eminent men: long-exploded slanders, born of partisan spite, are\r\nmore in the mind of the editor than the permanent and invaluable traits\r\nwhich, to a generous and refined mind, constitute the legitimate claims\r\nof the work itself and the authors thereof. Guizot remarks: 'In the\r\ndiscussions of the numbers' (the 'Federalist'), 'for all that combines a\r\nprofound knowledge of the great elementary principles of human\r\ngovernment with the wisest maxims of practical administration, I do not\r\nknow in the whole compass of my reading, whether from ancient or modern\r\nauthors, so able a work.' _The Edinburgh Review_ says: 'The 'Federalist'\r\nis a publication that exhibits an extent and precision of information, a\r\nprofundity of research and an acuteness of understanding, which would\r\nhave done honor to the most illustrious statesmen of ancient or modern\r\ntimes.'\r\n\r\nIn contrast with these and similar instances of eminent foreign\r\nappreciation, the editor of this edition of the 'Federalist' attributes\r\nto tact what is due to truth, represents the people, as such, as opposed\r\nto the Constitution, and Hamilton, Jay, and Madison 'poor antagonists'\r\nin combating their objections; if so, how does he account for the\r\nremarkable triumph of their dispassionate exposition and lucid\r\narguments? In all political and literary history there are few more\r\nbenign and distinguished examples of the practical efficiency of\r\nintelligent, patriotic, and conscientious reasoning against ignorance,\r\nprejudice, and partisan misrepresentation. And yet, in the face of this\r\ntestimony, by the self-constituted editor of this national work,\r\nHamilton is described as sophistical and disingenuous, whose object is\r\nto deceive rather than to instruct, to mislead rather than enlighten,\r\nand whose motives are partisan rather than patriotic.\r\n\r\nThroughout the introduction there is a spirit of latent detraction;\r\ninsinuations against the aims and methods, if not against the character\r\nof the illustrious men whose memories are our most precious inheritance;\r\nwe feel that, however industrious in research and ingenious in\r\nconjecture, the tone and range of the critic's mind are wholly\r\ninadequate for any sympathetic insight as to the nature of the men whose\r\nwritings he undertakes to reintroduce to the public--and this\r\nirrespective of any difference of political opinion: something more than\r\nverbal accuracy and patient collation is requisite to interpret the\r\n'Federalist' and appreciate its authors; even a political opponent, of\r\nkindred social and personal traits, would do better justice to the\r\ntheme: and a truly patriotic citizen of the republic, at such a crisis\r\nas the present, could never find therein an appropriate occasion to\r\nmagnify political differences at the expense of national sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhatever the literary merit or political interest of the 'Federalist,'\r\nits moral value is derived from our faith in the absolute sincerity and\r\nprofound convictions of its authors: not only does the internal evidence\r\nof every page bear emphatic testimony thereto, but the correspondence of\r\neach writer as well as of contemporary statesmen, attest the same truth:\r\nthey regarded the condition of the country as ruinous, and lamented that\r\nthe fruits of victory turned to ashes on the lips of the people, because\r\nthere was no homogeneous and vital organization to conserve and\r\nadminister the invaluable blessings won by the sword: against the\r\nsuicidal jealousy of State rights as adequate for prosperous\r\nself-reliance without the bonds and blessings of a vital National\r\nGovernment, they earnestly directed the most patriotic and intelligent\r\narguments: of these the 'Federalist' is the chief repertory; hence its\r\nvalue and interest as a popular treatise which prepared the way for the\r\nintelligent adoption of the Constitution; yet in this edition the\r\nintroductory remarks impugn the sincerity of the authors, and attempt to\r\nrevive the political heresy of extreme State as opposed to Federal\r\npower, which it is the primary object of the work to expose and condemn;\r\nand this at a time when the fatal doctrine is in vogue as what may be\r\ncalled the metaphysical apology for the most base and barbarous\r\nrebellion against free government recorded in history. According to this\r\neditor, Chancellor Livingston was 'dilatory and uncertain,' Duane\r\nsympathized with the Tories in power, Hamilton exaggerated the troubles\r\nof the country and consciously sought to make his fellow citizens\r\nattribute, against the facts, the depreciated currency and the dearth of\r\ntrade to the weakness of the Confederation--making a false issue to\r\neffect a political triumph: 'his plan of operations,' his 'tact,' are\r\nreferred to as if, instead of being a true patriot and conscientious\r\nstatesman, he was a mere special pleader, intriguing and ambitious. Add\r\nto this that, when introducing the 'Federalist' to the public in what\r\npurports to be an historical preface, he is silent on the wonderful\r\nfruits of the Constitution therein advocated--and fails to indicate, as\r\nwould any candid critic, the remarkable proofs which time and experience\r\nyield of the practical wisdom and patriotic foresight of the men whose\r\nhonorable prestige he thus indirectly seeks to undermine. Jay, we are\r\ntold, was regarded 'by the majority of his fellow citizens as selfish,\r\nimpracticable, and aristocratic;' he is said to have been 'induced to\r\nundertake' his share of the 'Federalist;' he speaks of the small part he\r\nactually did write, without alluding to the fact that illness withdrew\r\nhim from work of all kinds, after his third paper had been\r\ncontributed--thus conveying the impression of a lukewarm zeal and even\r\nutter indifference; whereas not only do his own words confute the\r\nimputation, but we have Madison's declaration that the idea of the\r\n'Federalist' was suggested by Jay; 'and it was undertaken last fall,' he\r\nwrites to Jefferson, 'by Jay, Hamilton, and myself. The proposal came\r\nfrom the two former. The execution was thrown, by the sickness of Jay,\r\nmostly on the two others.' It is even insinuated by this editor that Jay\r\nconfined himself to topics which could be discussed 'without\r\ncompromising in the least his general political sentiments, and without\r\nobliging him to assent even by implication to any portion of the\r\nproposed Constitution.' The representative duties and offices again and\r\nagain forced upon John Jay--whether as a writer, jurist, envoy, or\r\nlegislator--the evidence of his own letters, and especially the\r\ntestimony of his fellow statesmen, adequately confute such\r\nmisrepresentations as we have noted. It is a thankless, and, we believe,\r\na superfluous task to vindicate the manliness, sincerity, and patriotism\r\nof the authors of the 'Federalist' and their fellow statesmen; indeed,\r\ntheir illustrious opponents in political questions again and again bore\r\nwitness to the worth, wisdom, and integrity of the _men_, while many\r\ndisputed the doctrine of the writers; popular sentiment embalms their\r\nfame and cherishes their memories; the insinuations of any\r\nself-constituted editor cannot impair the confidence or reverse the\r\nverdict which time has only confirmed and national growth made more\r\nemphatic. On the other hand, such attempts to diminish the personal\r\nauthority, by misrepresenting the methods and motives of these eminent\r\nmen, as are exhibited in the whole tone and manner of this editorship of\r\na national work, imply a perverted sense of the duties of the hour, an\r\ninsensibility to the terrible crisis through which the nation is\r\npassing, that cannot be too severely condemned by the patriotic and\r\nintelligent of all parties. Now, if never before, we should keep bright\r\nthe escutcheon of our country's honor, and renew our love and admiration\r\nfor the fathers of the republic and our faith in their principles.\r\n\r\nScrupulous as firm, Jay acted with judicial moderation; he advocated the\r\nlast petition before declaring hostility against Great Britain--desirous\r\nof trying every means before accepting the dread alternative of war; he\r\ninsisted upon a general convention of the States before deciding upon\r\nthe new Constitution; he was loyal until loyalty became an abrogation of\r\nfree citizenship; law and justice with him went hand in hand with\r\nreform, and rectitude, not impulse, gave consistency to his course. Such\r\na man lays himself open to factious criticism far more than reckless\r\npoliticians, who are restrained by no sense of responsibility; but, on\r\nthe other hand, in the last analysis, they stand forth the most pure\r\nbecause the most patient, just, and truly patriotic of representative\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jay,' says John Adams, 'had as much influence in the preparatory\r\nmeasures for digesting the Constitution and in obtaining its adoption as\r\nany man in the nation;' yet according to this editor of the\r\n'Federalist,' he found therein 'little that he could commend, and\r\nnothing for which he could labor:' the same authority declares that he\r\nwas regarded 'by the majority of his fellow citizens as selfish,\r\nimpracticable, and aristocratic;' while Dr. McVickar justly remarks that\r\nthe first thing that strikes us in contemplating his life is 'the\r\nunbroken continuity, the ceaseless succession of honorable confidences,\r\nthroughout a period of twenty-eight years, reposed in Jay by his\r\ncountrymen.'\r\n\r\nBut instead of dwelling upon such abortive disparagement, the only\r\nimportance of which arises from its being annexed to and associated with\r\na standard political text-book, let us refresh our memories, our\r\npatriotism, our best sympathies of mind and heart, by tracing once more\r\nthe services and delineating the character of this illustrious man,\r\nwhose benign image seems to invoke his countrymen, at this momentous\r\nclimax of our national life, to recur to those principles and that faith\r\nwhich founded and should now save the republic.\r\n\r\nAmong the French Protestants who were obliged to seek a foreign home\r\nwhen the Edict of Nantes was revoked, was Pierre Jay, a prosperous\r\nmerchant of Rochelle, who took up his abode in England. This statement\r\nalone is no inadequate illustration of the character of John Jay's\r\npaternal grandfather; sagacity, enterprise, and application, are\r\nqualities we may justly infer from commercial success; and when the\r\nfruits thereof were, in no small degree, sacrificed by adherence to a\r\nproscribed religion, no ordinary degree of moral courage and pure\r\nintegrity must have been united to prudential industry. Those who\r\nbelieve in that aristocracy of nature whereby normal instincts are\r\ntransmitted, will find even in this brief allusion to the Huguenot\r\nmerchant traits identical with those which insured the public usefulness\r\nand endear the personal memory of his grandson. The latter's father,\r\nAugustus Jay, was one of three sons. He, with many others of the second\r\ngeneration of exiled French Protestants, found in America a more\r\nauspicious refuge than even the more free states of Europe afforded. A\r\nfamily who had previously emigrated to New York, under similar\r\ncircumstances, naturally welcomed the new _emigre_; and the daughter of\r\nBathezan Bayard became his wife. Their children consisted of three\r\ndaughters and one son, who was named Peter for his grandfather. One of\r\nthe prominent names of the original Dutch colonists of New York is Van\r\nCortland; and Peter Jay married, in 1728, Mary, a daughter of this race,\r\nby whom he had ten children, of which John, the subject of this sketch,\r\nwas the eighth. Genealogists, who reckon lineage according to humanity\r\nrather than pride, might find in the immediate ancestry of John Jay one\r\nof those felicitous combinations which so often mark the descent of\r\neminent men among our Revolutionary statesmen. With the courteous and\r\nintelligent proclivities of Gallic blood the conservative, domestic, and\r\nhonest nature of the Hollander united to form a well-balanced mind and\r\nefficient character. With the best associations of the time and place\r\nwere blended the firmness of principle derived from ancestors who had\r\nsuffered for conscience' sake; so that in the antecedents and very blood\r\nof the boy were elements of the Christian, patriot, and gentleman; which\r\nphases of his nature we find dominant and pervasive throughout his life;\r\nfor it is a remarkable fact in the career of John Jay that by no triumph\r\nof extraordinary genius, by no favor of brilliant circumstances did he\r\nwin and leave an honored name, but through the simple uprightness and\r\nthe sound wisdom of a consistent and loyal character--so emphatic and\r\nyet unostentatious as to overcome, in the end, the most rancorous\r\npolitical injustice. His early training was no less favorable to this\r\nresult than his birth. His father removed to Westchester county, and, on\r\na pleasant rural domain still occupied by the family, the future\r\njurist's childhood was passed. At that time there was a French church at\r\nNew Rochelle, the pastor of which was an excellent scholar; and this\r\ngentleman fitted young Jay for college. He gave early proofs of a\r\nstudious turn of mind and a reticent temperament; acquiring knowledge\r\nwith pleasure and facility; and, for the most part, exhibiting a\r\nthoughtful demeanor. In some of his father's letters, alluding to his\r\nchildhood, he is described as a boy of 'good capacity,' of 'grave\r\ndisposition,' and one who 'takes to learning exceedingly well.' He\r\nattended the grammar school of the French clergyman until the age of\r\nfourteen, and then entered King's (now Columbia) College, at that time\r\nunder the care of President Johnson. Here he became intimate with\r\nthree youths with whom he was destined to be memorably associated\r\nin after life, and whose names, with his own, have since become\r\nhistorical--Gouverneur Morris, Alexander Hamilton, and Robert R.\r\nLivingston. We can easily imagine that the diversities of character\r\nbetween these remarkable men were already evident; the ardor and\r\nfrankness of Hamilton, the emphatic rhetoric of Morris and fluent grace\r\nof Livingston must have singularly contrasted with the reserve,\r\nseriousness, and quietude of Jay; yet were they akin in the normal basis\r\nof character--in the love of knowledge, in loyalty to conviction, and\r\nthat heart of courtesy which harmonizes the most diverse gifts of mind\r\nand traits of manner; even then no common mutual respect must have\r\nexisted between them, and difference of opinion elicited both wit and\r\nwisdom. In a letter to the latter of these young friends, written soon\r\nafter, Jay speaks of himself as 'ambitious;' but little in his\r\nsubsequent life justifies the idea; he had more pride of character--more\r\nneed to respect himself--than ambition, as that word is usually\r\nunderstood; excellence more than distinction was his aim;--no one of the\r\nleaders in the Revolution sought office less, none fulfilled its duties\r\nwith more singleness of purpose, or escaped from its responsibilities\r\nwith greater alacrity; the instincts of John Jay were mainly for truth,\r\nduty, and success, in the higher acceptation of the term. What he\r\nundertook, indeed, he strove to do well, but it was from an ideal\r\nrectitude and a pride of achievement more than a desire to gain applause\r\nand advancement; his ambition was more scholarly than political or\r\npersonal. He graduated with the highest honors on the fifteenth of May,\r\n1764, and delivered the Latin salutatory. His family had gained wealth\r\nand position in commerce, and it is probable that, with his\r\nclear-sighted perseverance, John Jay would have been a most successful\r\nmerchant; but his tastes were intellectual; he determined to study\r\nlaw--at that period, in this country, when Blackstone's 'Commentaries'\r\nhad not appeared, before Chancellor Kent had written, or a law school\r\nhad been established, a discipline so arduous and uninviting as to be\r\nconscientiously adopted only by the most self-reliant and determined.\r\n\r\nFor a brief period Jay was the law partner of his friend Livingston,\r\nafterward the chancellor of the State. The evidences of his professional\r\ncareer, like those of so many eminent lawyers, are inadequate to suggest\r\nany clear idea of his method and ability, except so far as the respect\r\nhe won, the practice he acquired, and the style of those state papers\r\nwhich are preserved, indicate argumentative powers, extensive knowledge,\r\nand finished style: in a few years he had become eminent at the bar, and\r\nwhile in the full tide of success, the exigencies of public affairs--the\r\ndawn of the American Revolution, called him from personal to patriotic\r\nduties. He was an active participant in the first meeting called to\r\nprotest against the injustice and oppression of the British Government,\r\nand elected one of the committee of fifty chosen by the people, to\r\ndecide upon a course of action: at his instance they recommended the\r\nappointment of deputies from each of the thirteen colonies. Jay was the\r\nyoungest member of the Congress that met on the 5th of September, 1774,\r\nand was selected as one of the committee to draft an address to the\r\npeople of Great Britain; in the next Congress he was one of the\r\ncommittee to prepare the declaration showing the causes and necessity of\r\na resort to arms, and of that appointed to draft a petition to the\r\nking--as a last resort before actual hostilities; he also wrote the\r\naddress to the people of Canada, Jamaica, and Ireland. The address to\r\nthe people of Great Britain opens thus:\r\n\r\n     'When a nation, led to greatness by the hand of liberty, and\r\n     possessed of all the glory that heroism, munificence, and humanity\r\n     can bestow, descends to the ungrateful task of forging chains for\r\n     her friends and children, and, instead of giving support to\r\n     freedom, turns advocate for slavery and oppression, there is reason\r\n     to suspect she has either ceased to be virtuous, or been extremely\r\n     negligent in the appointment of her rulers.'\r\n\r\nIt concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n     'It is with the utmost regret that we find ourselves compelled, by\r\n     the overruling principles of self-preservation, to adopt measures\r\n     detrimental in their consequences to numbers of our fellow subjects\r\n     in Great Britain and Ireland. But we hope that the magnanimity and\r\n     justice of the British nation will furnish a Parliament of such\r\n     wisdom, independence, and public spirit, as may save the violated\r\n     rights of the whole empire from the devices of wicked ministers and\r\n     evil counsellors, whether in or out of office; and thereby restore\r\n     that harmony, friendship, and fraternal affection between all the\r\n     inhabitants of his majesty's kingdoms and territories, so ardently\r\n     wished for by every true and honest American.'\r\n\r\nThese and other state papers, emanating, as Jefferson declared, 'from\r\nthe finest pen in America,' won the eloquent admiration of Chatham, and,\r\nby their dignified, rational, and well-informed spirit, had a great\r\ninfluence in securing, at the outset of the momentous struggle, the\r\nrespect and sympathy of the wise and conscientious in both hemispheres,\r\nfor the people and their enlightened and intrepid representatives.\r\n\r\nAs correspondent with the other colonies, in all the important\r\ndiscussions and arrangements, we find John Jay earnest, sagacious, and\r\nindefatigable: chosen a delegate to the New York colonial convention, he\r\ncould not be present in Congress to sign the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; but he reported the resolutions whereby his State endorsed\r\nthat memorable instrument--her first official act toward American\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, Jay had married the daughter of Governor Livingston, of New\r\nJersey; and the glimpses which his correspondence affords of his\r\ndomestic life, indicate that in this regard he was peculiarly blest, not\r\nonly in the sweet and dignified sympathies of a family inspired by\r\ntenderness, loyalty, and faith, but in the freshness and vigor of his\r\nown affections, whereby retirement became far more dear than the\r\ngratification even of patriotic ambition in an official career. His home\r\nwas indeed overshadowed by the dark angel, and the loss of a beloved\r\ndaughter long and deeply saddened his heart; but there was a daily\r\nbeauty in the confidence and sympathy of his conjugal relation--hinted\r\nrather than developed in the freedom of his letters to the home whose\r\nattractions were only increased by absence and distance, in the respect\r\nand love of his sons, and the tender consideration devoted to his blind\r\nbrother; while, spreading in beautiful harmony from this sacred centre,\r\nhis heart and hand freely and faithfully responded to numerous and\r\neminent ties of friendship, associations of enterprise and philanthropy,\r\nand the humblest claims of neighborhood and dependants.\r\n\r\nHis next eminent service was to draft the Constitution of New York;\r\nsubsequently amended, it yet attests his patriotism and legal insight;\r\nwhile his own illustrations sanctioned its judicial workings: one of the\r\ncouncil of safety and appointed chief justice of the supreme court, Jay\r\nmaintained, but never abused the high authority with which he was thus\r\ninvested; kindness to political opponents, devoid of all bitterness,\r\ninflexibly just, he was often compared to the unyielding and\r\nself-possessed characters of antiquity. When Clinton was preparing to\r\njoin Burgoyne, Jay held his first court at Kingston--administering\r\njustice under the authority of an invaded State, and on the very line of\r\nan enemy's advance; under such circumstances, his uniform dignity,\r\ncalmness, faith in the people, in the cause, and in the result, made a\r\ndeep and salutary impression, enhanced by the courage exhibited in his\r\ncharge to the grand jury. In order to serve as delegate to the Congress\r\nover which he soon presided, Jay resigned the chief justiceship on the\r\ntenth of November, 1778; and signalized his advent by a logical,\r\nseasonable, and cheering address to the people on the condition of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nJay's mind was essentially judicial: he had the temperament and taste as\r\nwell as the reasoning powers desirable for legal investigation, and the\r\nprobity and decision of character essential to an administrator of law.\r\nWith strong domestic proclivities and rural taste--the conflicts,\r\nexcitement, and responsibilities of a political career were alien to his\r\nnature; but the functions of the higher magistracy found in him a\r\ncongenial representative. Accordingly, it is evident from his\r\ncorrespondence and the concurrent testimony of his kindred and friends,\r\nthat while as chief justice his sphere of duty was, however laborious,\r\nfull of interest to his mind--the vocation of a diplomatist was\r\noppressive: he undertook it, as he had other temporary public offices,\r\nfrom conscientious patriotism; the same qualities which gave him\r\ninfluence and authority on the bench commended him specially to his\r\nfellow citizens as a negotiator in the difficult and dangerous\r\nexigencies produced in our foreign relations by the war with Great\r\nBritain. Tact, sagacity, courage--the ability to command respect and to\r\nadvocate truth and maintain right--dignity of manner, benignity of\r\ntemper--devotion to his country--all the requisites seemed to combine in\r\nthe character of Jay, on the one hand to enforce just claims, and, on\r\nthe other, to propitiate good will. To raise a loan and secure an\r\nalliance in Spain seemed a hopeless task: Jay undertook it, much to his\r\npersonal inconvenience and with extreme reluctance. The history of his\r\nmission, as revealed by his correspondence and official documents, is a\r\nhistory of vexations, mortifications, and patient, isolated struggles\r\nwith difficulties, such as few men would have encountered voluntarily or\r\nendured with equanimity. The Spanish Government shrank from a decisive\r\ncourse, feared self-committal, promised aid, and to concede, on certain\r\nterms, the right of the United States to navigate the Mississippi. Jay\r\ntook council of Franklin, who advised him not to accede to the terms\r\nproposed, but to maintain 'the even good temper hitherto manifested.'\r\nMeantime Congress drew on him for the loan without waiting to hear that\r\nit had been negotiated; after a small advance, the Spanish Government\r\ndeclined the loan unless the sole right of navigating the Mississippi\r\nwere granted. Having thus failed to accomplish the great object, which\r\nindeed was unattainable except at a sacrifice which subsequent events\r\nhave proved would have essentially interfered with the prosperous\r\ndevelopment of the Southwest--Jay, sensitively vigilant of his country's\r\ncredit, despite his habitual prudence, accepted the bill at his own\r\ncredit; boldly assuming the responsibility; his claims on the Spanish\r\nGovernment were proved; Franklin remitted twenty-five thousand dollars;\r\nof the one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, due December, 1780, only\r\ntwenty-five thousand was paid by the following April; his outstanding\r\nacceptances amounted to two hundred and thirty-one thousand dollars--the\r\ngreater part of which was due in two months. A more painful situation\r\nfor a gentleman of refinement and honor can scarcely be imagined than\r\nthat of John Jay--living without any salary, living on credit, scarcely\r\nrecognized by the proud court to which he had been accredited; and yet\r\nmaintaining his self-respect, persistent in his aim, courteous in his\r\nmanner, faithful to his trust, harassed by anxiety--patient, true, and\r\npatriotic. As we read the lively and genial letters of the lamented\r\nIrving, when American minister at Madrid seventy years later, what a\r\ncontrast to the high consideration and social amenities he enjoyed, are\r\nthe humiliations and the baffled zeal of Jay, when obliged to 'stand and\r\nwait,' under circumstances at once so perplexing and hopeless! In March,\r\n1782, the bills were protested; but the credit that seemed utterly\r\ndestroyed was soon retrieved, though Jay found himself constrained, by\r\nthe instructions of his Government, to yield the right of navigating the\r\nMississippi in order to secure the treaty; having drawn and presented\r\nit, his presence was no longer requisite, and he proceeded to France to\r\nact in concert with Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, and Lee in negotiating\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1782, Jay arrived in Paris, and, with Franklin, for the most\r\npart carried on the negotiations which resulted in the treaty of peace;\r\nit was a period of 'painful anxiety and difficult labor:' Hamilton,\r\nJefferson, and other of his eminent countrymen recognized warmly his\r\nservices and his success: he did not altogether agree with Franklin, and\r\nwas pertinacious in claiming all respect due to the Government he\r\nrepresented, assuring the British envoy that he would take no part in\r\nthe business unless the United States 'were treated as an independent\r\nnation:' he drew up such a commission as would meet his views. While\r\nHamilton gave Jay full credit for sagacity and honesty, he thought him\r\nsuspicious, because he so far evaded his instructions as not to show\r\n'the preliminary articles to our ally before he signed them:' this\r\ncaution, however, arose from Jay's patriotic circumspection; he excused\r\nhimself on the ground that his instructions 'had been given for the\r\nbenefit of America, and not of France,' and argued justly that there was\r\ndiscretionary power to consult the public good rather than any literal\r\ndirections, the spirit, aim, and scope thereof being steadily adhered\r\nto. Subsequent revelations abundantly proved that sagacity rather than\r\nsuspicion, and knowledge more than conjecture justified Jay's course.\r\nThere is a letter of Pickering, when Secretary of State, to Pinckney,\r\nwhen about to visit France as envoy from the United States Government,\r\nin regard to which Washington manifests in his correspondence particular\r\nsolicitude for the absolute correctness of its statements; wherein the\r\ntreachery of the French Government is demonstrated from official\r\ndocuments. Jay, during his residence in Spain, had ample opportunity to\r\nrealize the selfish intrigues of the Bourbon dynasty, and he had a\r\nbetter insight as to the real objects of the French Government, from\r\nexamining its policy at a distance and in connection with an ally, than\r\nFranklin, who had been exposed to its immediate blandishments, and had\r\nso many personal reasons for confidence and hope. Vergennes, then prime\r\nminister, looked to the relinquishment of the fisheries, and while\r\nFrance, from animosity to Great Britain, cheerfully aided us in the war\r\nof the Revolution, it was no part of her secret purpose to foster into\r\nindependent greatness the power which she befriended from motives of\r\npolicy during her own struggle with England. Jay, therefore, insisted\r\nupon a recognition of our independence on the part of Great Britain, not\r\nas the first article of the treaty, but as _un fait accompli_; and\r\nwisely declined to allow the French minister, whose plans and views he\r\nso well understood, to see the advantageous terms we made with the\r\nformidable enemy of France, until those terms were accepted, and the\r\ntreaty signed.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting England and returning to Paris, having declined an\r\ninvitation from the Spanish Government to resume negotiations, and also\r\na tender from his own Government of the English mission, Jay returned to\r\nhis native land with delight, and on landing in New York, on the 24th of\r\nJuly, 1784, was received with great honor and affection. Ten years of\r\npublic life had so little weaned him from his legal proclivities that he\r\nhad determined to resume practice; but Congress urged upon him the\r\nimportant position of Secretary of Foreign Affairs, which place he\r\nfilled with distinguished ability until the convention to form the\r\nConstitution met. In his correspondence, Jay's views of government are\r\nfrankly and clearly unfolded: he had experienced the manifold evils of\r\ninadequate authority; and while he would have power emanate from the\r\npeople, he deeply felt the necessity of making it sufficient for the\r\nexigencies of civil society: a strong General Government, therefore, he\r\ndeemed essential to national prosperity; his theory was not speculative,\r\nbut practical, founded upon observation and experience: it was sustained\r\nby the wisest and best of his countrymen: it was, however, opposed to a\r\nprevalent idea of State rights, a jealousy of their surrender and\r\ninfringement; comparatively few of his fellow citizens had, by reading\r\nand reflection, risen to the level of the problem whose solution was to\r\nbe found in a charter at once securing all essential private rights and\r\nlocal freedom, while binding together, in a firm and patriotic union,\r\nthe will and interests of a continent. Add to these obstacles the fierce\r\npartisan feeling engendered by the circumstances of the time and\r\ncountry--fears of aristocratic influences on the one hand, and sectional\r\nintrigues on the other, and we can easily perceive that the first duty\r\nof the enlightened and patriotic was to clear away prejudices, explain\r\nprinciples, advocate cardinal political truths, and lift the whole\r\nsubject out of the dense region of faction and into the calm and clear\r\nsphere of reason and truth. Accordingly, Hamilton, Madison, Jay, and\r\nothers, by public discussion sought to elucidate and vindicate the\r\nConstitution: by conversation, correspondence, in the committee room and\r\nthe assembly, through reference to the past, analysis of the present,\r\nanticipations of the future, John Jay, directly and indirectly advocated\r\nand illustrated the Constitution. With his gifted coadjutors he became\r\nan efficient political essayist; and, though prevented by illness from\r\ncontributing largely to the 'Federalist,' he wrote enough to identify\r\nhimself honorably with that favorite American classic of statesmen. His\r\nfrankness, lucid style, perspicuous sense, made him as effective a\r\nwriter in his own manner as the more intrepid Hamilton. When Washington\r\ncame to New York to be inaugurated as first President of the United\r\nStates, Jay proffered his hospitality with characteristic simplicity and\r\ngood sense; he received the votes of two States as Vice President; at\r\nWashington's request he continued to perform the duties of Foreign\r\nSecretary until Jefferson assumed the office, when, with eminent\r\nsatisfaction and in accordance with Jay's views, the President sent the\r\nlatter's name to the Senate as Chief Justice, thus associating him with\r\nhis Administration.\r\n\r\nWhen Genet's arrival had stimulated partisan zeal into reckless faction,\r\nand his insulting course widened the breach between the two political\r\nsects, their representatives were exposed to all the unjust aspersion\r\nand violent prejudice born of extreme opinions and free discussions: one\r\nparty held in high esteem the principles of the British constitution,\r\nrecognized the moral as well as civic necessity of a strong central\r\nGovernment, and dreaded the unbridled license of French demagoguism;\r\nthey steadily opposed any identity of action or responsibility in\r\nforeign affairs, cherished self-respect and self-reliance as the\r\nsafeguard of the States, and sustained the dignified and consistent\r\ncourse of Washington: of these, John Jay was one of the most firm and\r\nintelligent advocates, and hence the object of the most unscrupulous\r\npartisan rancor: the name of Monarchist was substituted for Federalist,\r\nof Jacobin for Democrat: on the one hand, the British minister\r\nreproached the American Government with injustice to British subjects\r\nand interests, contrary to treaty stipulations; on the other, Genet\r\ncomplained of the ingratitude of the Government, and sought to array the\r\npeople against it: England had not as yet fulfilled her part of the\r\ntreaty; along the frontiers her troops still garrisoned the forts; the\r\nlakes were not free for American craft, and no remuneration had been\r\nmade by Great Britain for the negroes which her fleet carried off at the\r\nclose of the war: meantime her warlike attitude toward France made\r\nstill fiercer the conflict of the respective partisans on this side of\r\nthe Atlantic; American seamen were impressed; crowds surrounded the\r\nPresident's house, clamorous for war; and he was only sustained in the\r\nSenate by an extremely small majority, while the Democratic party were\r\neager for immediate action against England. At this crisis, Washington\r\nresolved to try another experiment for conciliation, and to this end\r\nproposed Jay as especial envoy to Great Britain. His nomination was\r\nopposed in the Senate, but prevailed by a vote of eighteen against\r\neight. The mission was not desired by him. Uncongenial as were absence\r\nfrom home and diplomatic cares, this exile and duty were, in all private\r\nrespects, opposed to his tastes and wishes; he foresaw the difficulties,\r\nanticipated the result, but, once convinced that he owed the sacrifice\r\nof personal to public considerations, he now, as before and\r\nsubsequently, brought all his conscientiousness and intelligence to the\r\nservice of his country. His reception at the court of St. James was kind\r\nand considerate, and his intercourse with Grenville, then Secretary of\r\nForeign Affairs, carried on with the greatest mutual respect. A treaty\r\nwas negotiated--Jay obtaining the best terms in his power: no state\r\npaper ever gave rise to more virulent controversy; it became a new line\r\nof demarcation, a new test of party feeling: Hamilton was its eloquent\r\nadvocate, Jefferson its violent antagonist: Washington doubted the\r\nexpediency of accepting it; and it passed the Senate by a bare majority.\r\nWhile in a calm retrospect we acknowledge many serious objections to\r\nsuch a treaty, they do not account for the intense excitement it caused;\r\nand the circumstances under which it was executed sufficiently explain,\r\nwhile they do not reconcile us to, the signal advantages it secured to\r\nGreat Britain. She agreed to give up the forts;--but this concession had\r\nalready been made; to compensate for illegal captures; there was a\r\nprovision for collecting British debts in America; and in a commercial\r\npoint of view American interests were sacrificed; it was declared a\r\ntreaty wherein a weak power evidently succumbed to a strong: but on the\r\nother hand, public expectation had been extravagant: no reasonable\r\nAmerican citizen, cognizant of the state of the facts and of party\r\nfeeling, could have believed it possible to secure, at the time and\r\nunder the circumstances, a satisfactory understanding; and no candid\r\nmind could doubt that a negotiator so patriotic, firm, and wise as John\r\nJay had earnestly sought to make the best of a difficult cause, or that\r\nhe was 'clear in his great office'--an office reluctantly accepted. It\r\nhas been well said of Jay's treaty that 'now few defend it on principle,\r\nmany on policy.' When its ratification was advised by the Senate, and it\r\nbecame public, the whole country was aroused; all the latent venom of\r\npartisan hate and all the wise forbearance of patriotic self-possession\r\nwere arrayed face to face in so fierce an opposition that Washington\r\njustly described the period as 'a momentous crisis.' It was denounced as\r\ncowardly; it was defended as expedient; copies were publicly destroyed\r\namid shouts of exultation: Jay was burned in effigy; the Boston Chamber\r\nof Commerce voted in favor of its ratification: Hamilton, under the\r\nsignature of 'Camillus,' analyzed its claims, and deprecated the bitter\r\nhostility it had evoked; and Fisher Ames, in pleading for moderation to\r\nboth parties, in the House of Representatives, embalmed his patriotic\r\ncounsel with such heroic patience and eloquent references to his\r\napproaching end, that his speech became one of the standard exemplars of\r\nAmerican eloquence.\r\n\r\n     'When the fiery vapors of the war lowered in the skirts of our\r\n     horizon,' he observes, 'all our wishes were concentred in this\r\n     one--that we might escape the desolation of the storm: this treaty,\r\n     like a rainbow on the edge of the storm, marked to our eyes the\r\n     space where it was raging, and afforded, at the same time, the sure\r\n     prognostic of fair weather: if we reject it, the vivid colors will\r\n     grow pale; it will be a baleful meteor, portending tempest and\r\n     war.'\r\n\r\nAnd he ends this remarkable speech in these words:\r\n\r\n     'I have thus been led by my feelings to speak more at length than I\r\n     had intended. Yet I have perhaps as little personal interest in the\r\n     event as any one here. There is, I believe, no member who will not\r\n     think his chance to be a witness of the consequences greater than\r\n     mine. If, however, the vote should pass to reject, and a spirit\r\n     should rise, as it will, with the public disorders, to make\r\n     confusion worse confounded, even I, slender and almost broken as my\r\n     hold upon life is, may outlive the Government and Constitution of\r\n     my country.'\r\n\r\nJay's own remarks on the subject in his private correspondence, are\r\ncharacteristic alike of his rectitude of purpose and equanimity of soul:\r\n'The approbation,' he observes, in a letter to Dr. Thatcher, 'of one\r\njudicious and virtuous man relative to the conduct of the negotiations,\r\naffords me more satisfaction than clamor and intrigue have given me\r\nconcern.'\r\n\r\nBefore the outbreak of political animosity on account of the treaty, and\r\nduring his absence on that mission, Jay had been elected Governor of the\r\nState of New York; had that instrument been published in April instead\r\nof July, he would not have been chosen; and yet, despite the fever of\r\npartisan feeling, he made no removals. At the close of this memorable\r\nyear, Washington died: that illustrious man held no man in greater\r\nesteem than Jay: to him and Hamilton he had submitted his Farewell\r\nAddress: when the former's term of office expired, he determined to\r\nretire; and did so on the 1st of July, 1801, declining the reappointment\r\nas Chief Justice, earnestly tendered him. He now removed to his paternal\r\nestate at Bedford, in Westchester county, New York, to enjoy\r\nlong-coveted repose from public duties. Thenceforth his life was one of\r\ndignified serenity and active benevolence. The superintendence of his\r\nfarm, co-operation in philanthropic enterprises, the amenities of\r\nliterature, the consolations of religion, and the graces of hospitality\r\ncongenially occupied his remaining years--years abounding in respect\r\nfrom his countrymen, and the satisfactions of culture, integrity, and\r\nfaith. He rebuilt the family mansion, occasionally made visits on\r\nhorseback to New York and Albany. Now zealous in building up a church,\r\nand now benignly considerate of a dependant's welfare--loyal and happy\r\nin his domestic relations, interested in the welfare of both nation and\r\nneighborhood, and preserving his intimacy with the classics and the\r\nScriptures--the last thirty years of John Jay's life, in their peaceful\r\nroutine and gracious tenor, reflected with 'daily beauty' the sustained\r\nelevation of mind and the consistent kindliness and rectitude of a\r\nChristian gentleman. On the 17th of May, 1829, he died, crowned with\r\nlove and honor. The echoes of party strife had long died away from his\r\npath: the clouds of party malice had faded from his horizon: all felt\r\nand acknowledged, in his example and character, the ideal of an American\r\ncitizen. Not as a brilliant but as a conscientious man, not as a\r\nwonderfully gifted but as an admirably well-balanced mind, not as an\r\nexceptional hero but as a just, prudent, faithful, and benignant human\r\nbeing--true to the best instincts of religion, the highest principles of\r\ncitizenship, the most pure aspirations of character--are cherished the\r\ninfluence and memory of Jay.\r\n\r\nHis personal appearance is familiar to us through the masterly portraits\r\nof Stuart: that in judicial robes has long been a favorite examplar of\r\nthis eminent artist, exhibiting as it does his best traits of expression\r\nand color: although destitute of those vivid tints which Stuart\r\nreproduced with such marvellous skill, the keen eyes, fine brow,\r\naquiline nose, pointed chin, and hair tied behind and powdered, with the\r\nbenign intelligence pervading the whole, render this an effective\r\nsubject for such a pencil: it is a face in which high moral and\r\nintellectual attributes, dignity, rectitude, and clear perception\r\nharmoniously blend: the lineaments and outline are decidedly Gallic: one\r\nthinks, in looking at the portrait, not only of the able jurist,\r\nChristian gentleman, and patriot--but also of his Huguenot ancestor, who\r\nfought at Boyne, urbanely accepted exile rather than compromise faith,\r\nand suffered persecution with holy patience and adaptive energy of\r\nintellect and character.\r\n\r\nThe political opinions of Jay were obnoxious to a large party of his\r\ncountrymen; but had we not so many examples in history and experience of\r\nthe blind prejudice and malicious injustice generated by faction, it\r\nwould seem incredible, as we contemplate, in the impartial light of\r\nretrospective truth, his character and career, that any imaginable\r\ndiversity of views on questions of state policy, could have bred such\r\nfalse and fierce misconstruction in reference to one whose every memory\r\nchallenges such entire respect and disinterested admiration. As it is,\r\nthe record of his life, the influence of his character seem to borrow\r\nnew brightness from the evidences of partisan calumny found in the more\r\ncasual records of the past. Singularly intense and complicated is the\r\nhistory of the period when Jay's prominence and activity in the\r\npolitical world were at their height. On the one hand, the triumph of\r\nfreedom in the New World; on the other, the atrocities committed in her\r\nsacred name in the Old: the American and French Revolutions, considered\r\nin regard to their origin, development, and results, seem to have\r\nbrought to a practical test all principles of government and elements of\r\ncivic life inherent in human society: so that they have since afforded\r\nthe tests and illustrations of the most enlightened publicists and\r\nstatesmen, and now yield the most familiar and emphatic precedents for\r\npolitical speculation and faith. In England, Pitt, Burke, Fox, and\r\nMackintosh represented, with memorable power, the opposing elements of\r\nconservatism and reform, of social order and revolution, of humanity and\r\nof authority; while in America, Hamilton, Adams, Morris, Jay, and other\r\nleading Federalists, repudiated the license and condemned the\r\nencroachments of France, as Jefferson and his followers advocated the\r\nFrench republic on abstract principles of human rights and as having\r\nlegitimate claims upon American gratitude. No small part of the\r\nbitterness exhibited toward Jay by the latter party arose from his\r\nhaving testified, with Rufus King, that Genet intended to appeal from\r\nthe Government to the people of the United States--an audacious purpose\r\non the part of the French envoy, which excited the just indignation of\r\nevery citizen whose self-respect had not been quenched in the flame of\r\npolitical zeal: accordingly he, to a peculiar extent, 'shared the odium\r\nwhich the French Revolution had infused into the minds of its admirers:'\r\npartial to the spirit if not the letter of the English constitution,\r\nconvinced by the absolute moral necessity of a strong central\r\nGovernment, an enlightened and strenuous advocate of law, a thorough\r\ngentleman, and a sincere Christian--his undoubted claim to the\r\nadditional distinction of pure patriot did not save him from the\r\naristocratic imputations, which professed champions of popular rights\r\nthen and there attached to all men who recognized as essential to social\r\norder and progress, respect for and allegiance to justly constituted\r\nauthorities in government and society: jealousy of the rights of the\r\npeople was the ostensible motive of a political opposition to Jay,\r\nwhich, at this day and with all the evidence before us, seems\r\ninexplicable until we remember how the mirage of party fanaticism\r\ndistorts the vision and perverts the sympathies of men.\r\n\r\nBut to a well-poised, clear-sighted, upright character like his, the\r\nstorms of faction seemed innocuous: how candid is his own confession of\r\nfaith, how just his reasoning, and enlightened his principles, and\r\npatriotic his motives, as revealed in every act, state and judicial\r\npaper, recorded conversation, and private letter! 'Neither courting nor\r\ndreading public opinion,' he writes (in his account of the Spanish\r\nmission), 'on the one hand, nor disregarding it on the other, I joined\r\nmyself to the first assertors of the American cause, because I thought\r\nit my duty; and because I considered caution and neutrality, however\r\nsecure, as being no less wrong than dishonorable.' As he had espoused\r\nthe cause deliberately, he served it conscientiously, and met the\r\ndifficulties in the way of organizing the Federal Government with\r\nphilosophical candor: 'It was a thing,' he observes, in his first\r\ncontribution to the 'Federalist,' 'hardly to be expected that in a\r\npopular revolution, the minds of men should stop at the happy mean which\r\nmarks the boundary between power and privilege, and combines the energy\r\nof government with the security of private right.'\r\n\r\nAn aesthetical student and delineator of character remarks that 'where we\r\nrecognize in any one an image of moral elevation, which seems to us, at\r\nthe first glance, unique and transcendent, I believe that, on careful\r\nexamination, we shall find that among his coevals, or in the very nature\r\nof the times, those qualities which furnish their archetype in him were\r\nrife and prevalent.'[16] The highest class of American statesmen and\r\npatriots, and especially those grouped around the peerless central\r\nfigure of Washington, afford striking evidence of the truth of this\r\nobservation. A certain spirit of disinterested integrity and devotion,\r\nan elevated and consistent tone of feeling and method of action alike\r\ndistinguished them; and nothing can be imagined more violently in\r\ncontrast therewith than the inadequate standard of judgment and scope of\r\ncriticism adopted by those who, actuated by partisan zeal and guided by\r\nnarrow motives, apply to such characters the limited gauge of their own\r\ninsight and estimation--endeavoring to atone by microscopic accuracy for\r\nimbecility in fundamental principles.' Hence the foreign publicist of\r\nlarge research and precise historical knowledge, the scholar of broad\r\nand earnest sympathies, the patriot of generous and tenacious\r\nprinciples, find in these exemplars of civic virtue objects of permanent\r\nadmiration; while many of their self-appointed commentators, entrenched\r\nin pedantic or political dogmas, and devoid of comprehensive ideas and\r\ntrue magnanimity, fail to recognize and delight in depreciating\r\nqualities with which they have no affinity, and whose legitimate\r\nfunctions they ignore or pervert--for 'Folly loves the martyrdom of\r\nFame.' With all due allowance for honest differences of opinion as to\r\npolitical or religious creeds, for diversities of taste and education,\r\nthere yet remains to the truly humane, wise, and liberal soul, an\r\ninstinctive sense of justice, veneration for rectitude, love of the\r\nbeautiful and the true, which keeps alive their veneration and quickens\r\ntheir higher sympathies despite the venom of faction and the blindness\r\nof prejudice; and thus causes the elemental in character to maintain its\r\nlawful sway whatever may be the inferences of partisan logic or the\r\ndicta of personal opinion. Goethe's invaluable rule of judging every\r\ncharacter and work of art by its own law is ever present to their minds,\r\nand they find a satisfaction in the spontaneous tribute of love and\r\nhonor to real genius and superior worth, all the more grateful because\r\nthere is not entire sympathy of sentiment and creed; their homage and\r\nfaith are as disinterested as they are sincere.\r\n\r\nAn eminent English novelist has indicated with genial emphasis, in one\r\nof his essays, how much more wonderful as a psychological phenomenon is\r\nthe clairvoyance of imagination than that ascribed to mesmerism: since,\r\nby the former, writers of genius describe with verisimilitude, and\r\nsometimes with a moral accuracy such as we can scarcely believe to\r\noriginate in the creative mind alone, all the traits and phases of a\r\nscene, an event, or a character, the details of which are lost in dim\r\ntradition or evaded by authentic history. Shakspeare is cited as the\r\nmemorable example of this intellectual prescience. There is, however,\r\nanother species of foresight and insight whereby the logic of events is\r\nanticipated, and great principles embraced before the multitude are\r\nprepared for their adoption; reformers and statesmen are thus in advance\r\nof their age, and through high ethical judgment and the inspiration of\r\nrectitude, see above the clouds of selfishness and beyond the limits of\r\negotism, into the eternal truth of things. It was this wisdom, sustained\r\nby, if not born of, integrity and disinterestedness, that distinguished\r\nthe highest class of our Revolutionary and Constitutional statesmen,\r\nculminating in Washington, and in no one of his contemporaries more\r\nmanifest than in John Jay. We have alluded to the comprehensive and\r\nsagacious scope of his various state papers and judicial decisions,\r\nbased invariably upon the absolute principles of equity; and the same\r\ntraits are as obvious in his correspondence and occasional writings: but\r\nrecently there was found among his papers a charge to the grand jury at\r\nRichmond, Virginia, in which are expressed the most authentic principles\r\nof international drawn from natural law, at a period and in a country\r\nwhere the former had not been codified or even vaguely understood; and\r\nso practical as to be of direct application to the exigencies of the\r\npresent hour. At the root of these convictions was a profound religious\r\nfaith. No one of the early American statesmen, for instance, has left on\r\nrecord a more clear and just statement of his views of slavery;--that\r\nfoul blot on the escutcheon of the republic was ever before the eyes and\r\nconscience of Jay; he sought not to evade, but to make apparent its\r\ninevitable present shame and future consequences, and argued for a\r\nprospective abolition clause in the Constitution. The events of the last\r\nthree years are a terrible and true response to his warnings. 'Till\r\nAmerica,' he wrote, 'comes into this measure (emancipation) her prayers\r\nto heaven will be impious. I believe God governs the world, and I\r\nbelieve it is a maxim in His as in our courts, that those who ask for\r\nequity ought to do it.' He set the example in the manumission of a boy\r\nthen his legal property, and was the president of the first anti-slavery\r\nsociety, bequeathing the cause to his descendants, who have faithfully\r\nacquitted themselves of the once contemned but now honored trust, for\r\nthree generations; for his son succeeded him in the office, his grandson\r\nhas been and is its strenuous advocate, and his great-grandson now\r\nconfronts the slaveholding rebels in the Army of the Potomac. His\r\nintelligent and patriotic fellow citizens realized and recognized the\r\nfaith and probity whence arose his moral courage and his clear mental\r\nvision, 'His life,' says Sullivan, 'was governed by the dictates of an\r\nenlightened Christian conscience.' One of his last letters was in reply\r\nto the congratulation of the corporation of New York that he lived to\r\nwitness the fiftieth anniversary of our national independence, and an\r\ninvitation to join in its commemoration; too feeble, from advanced age,\r\nto meet their wishes in this respect, in gratefully declining he thus\r\nbore testimony to his life-long convictions: 'The most essential means\r\nof securing the continuance of our civil and religious liberties is\r\nalways to remember with reverence and gratitude the source from which\r\nthey flow?' We can readily appreciate the literal truth of Verplanck's\r\nobservation, when death canonized such a character: 'A halo of\r\nveneration seemed to encircle him, as one belonging to another world,\r\nthough lingering among us: the tidings of his death were received with\r\nsolemn awe.'\r\n\r\nJay cherished a firm belief in Providence, confirmed by his long life of\r\nvaried experience and thoughtful observation. Proverbially courteous and\r\nurbane, he was, at the same time, inflexible in the withdrawal of all\r\nconfidence when once deceived or disappointed in character. Clear and\r\nstrong in his religious convictions, he was none the less free from\r\nintolerance; he enjoyed communion with a Quaker neighbor as well as\r\ncorrespondence with clerical friends of different persuasions, though\r\nhimself a stanch Episcopalian.\r\n\r\nUnderlying a singularly contained demeanor and aptitude for calm and\r\nserious investigations, there was a vein of pleasant humor which\r\nenhanced the charm of his intimate companionship; bold, independent, and\r\ntenacious in opinion, when once formed, he was perfectly modest in\r\npersonal bearing and intercourse; his mind was more logical than severe\r\nin temper, more vigorous than versatile, judicial in taste and tone,\r\nwith more precision than eagerness; and his temperament united the\r\ngravity of a cultivated and thoughtful with the vivacity and amenity of\r\na harmonious and cheerful nature. Like Washington and Morris, he was\r\nfond of agricultural pursuits; and like them, his example as a statesman\r\nseems to acquire new force and beauty from the long and contented\r\nretirement from official life that evinced the plenitude of his own\r\nresources, and evidenced how much more a sense of public duty than\r\npolitical ambition had been the motive power of his civic career. It is\r\nthis which distinguishes the first-class representative men of our\r\ncountry from the mere politicians; we feel that their essential\r\nindividuality of character and genius was superior to the accidents of\r\nposition; that their intrinsic worth and real dignity required no\r\naddition from fame or fortune--that they are nobler than their offices,\r\nsuperior to their popularity, above their external relation to the\r\nparties and functions illustrated by their talents, and made memorable\r\nby their integrity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] 'Life and Letters of Washington Irving,' by Pierre M.

But let these\r\nskeletons resemble ours ever so closely, I, for one, am not prepared to\r\nconcede that these creatures, when they existed, were men in the sense\r\nthat we are. Revelation declares quite explicitly that the present race\r\nis not more than six thousand years old.\r\n\r\n_A._ What theory, then, must we adopt respecting these human-shaped\r\nfossils? Why do you deny that they were men like us?\r\n\r\n_B._ Tell me what a human being is, and I will answer your query.\r\n\r\n_A._ The definition would be a somewhat prolix one.\r\n\r\n_B._ It will be sufficient for our purpose that you admit two points\r\nregarding the existing race.\r\n\r\n_A._ The first?\r\n\r\n_B._ That man _has_ a body.\r\n\r\n_A._ Good. The second?\r\n\r\n_B._ That man _is_ a soul, a spiritual being.\r\n\r\n_A._ Good.\r\n\r\n_B._ Well, then; answer me this: Were the men whose remains are now\r\nbeing discovered, of a spiritual nature, and endowed with minds? Might\r\nthey not rather have been mere mammals, shaped indeed in the same\r\nexternal mould as that in which the Creator intended, when the time\r\nshould come, to form his masterpiece; but not as yet tenanted by that\r\ndivine nature which would have entitled him to rank with the race\r\nexisting now?\r\n\r\n_A._ Such questions it is hardly the province of geology to solve. But\r\nit may fairly be asked, What right have we to suppose that beings ever\r\nexisted who were men only in shape, but who were destitute of the\r\nspiritual nature? Does the Bible allow us any margin on which to base\r\nsuch a belief? Do the sacred writers mention the creation of two human\r\nraces, one endowed with merely an animal nature, the other possessing a\r\nspiritual nature?\r\n\r\n_B._ Scripture does so in passages which I shall point out presently.\r\nBut first, concede to me this one point, admitted by many theologians\r\nalready, that in the first and second chapters of Scripture, the term\r\n'day' has an ambiguous meaning--that the days were vast geological eras.\r\n\r\n_A._ Granted.\r\n\r\n_B._ The first human creation spoken of by Moses is that mentioned in\r\nGen. i. 27, where, immediately after recording the creation of the\r\ninferior animals, it is said that 'God created man in his own image,'\r\netc. Thus the visible and external creation has received its top and\r\nclimax: the animals have found a master. After that, we are told that\r\n'the evening and the morning were the sixth day.' Then the second\r\nchapter is opened, and the seventh day is described as forming a vast\r\ninterval of rest.\r\n\r\n_A._ All true.\r\n\r\n_B._ Now look at the seventh verse of this second chapter. The words\r\nare: 'And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\r\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living\r\nsoul.' Now I regard this passage as referring to a creation quite\r\ndistinct from that of the first chapter.\r\n\r\n_A._ Theologians have been in the habit of considering the two passages\r\nas descriptive of the same act.\r\n\r\n_B._ I am aware of it. But by what right have they done so? Everywhere\r\nelse in Genesis we find events recorded in chronological order, and\r\nthere is no reason why the historian should in this instance commit the\r\nirregularity of passing from the end of the seventh day to the beginning\r\nof the sixth: it is certainly much more likely that in the story of the\r\nsecond chapter and seventh verse he has passed on to an event which\r\ntranspired at the close of the seventh day, or, still more probably, on\r\nthe _first_ day of a new series. And if it were so, we would thus have,\r\nin the time of this second and spiritual creation, a beautiful symbol of\r\na more recent first-day's-work, when manifestation was made of a life\r\nfar nobler than Adam's.\r\n\r\n_A._ Your parallel is not without beauty, and, therefore, not without\r\nweight; but I cannot see enough of difference between the two accounts\r\nto warrant the hypothesis that the first refers to an unspiritual man,\r\nthe second to a spiritual. The first account says that 'man was made in\r\nGod's image.' The second says of the man which it describes, that 'God\r\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living\r\nsoul.'\r\n\r\n_B._ We must not attach too much importance to the term 'God's image.'\r\nThe sacred writer might make use of such an expression merely to show\r\nthe excellency of the image or form of the body of this first human\r\nrace, whose frame, relatively to the inferior animals, was, _par\r\nexcellence_, God's image. And on the whole, the difference between the\r\ntwo accounts is very wide and very important. The first passage does not\r\nstand connected with the history of the present race at all: the second\r\ndoes. In the former passage the creation of a _race_ is described, but\r\nthe _individual_ is not even named: in the latter we are not merely told\r\nof a race, we are introduced to an individual. His name is given, and he\r\nis connected with the existing race of mankind by a continuous history.\r\nIn speaking of the difference between the two passages, it were well to\r\nconsider that, till of late, there has been no reason to suspect their\r\nreal significancy, _i. e._, to suppose that they spoke of two creations\r\nand two races. But now that the proofs of a pre-Adamite race are fast\r\naccumulating upon us, it were well to inquire whether God's revelation\r\nhas not anticipated the story which the strange hieroglyphics of his\r\nfinger are now unfolding. The philologist and the geologist are each\r\ndeciphering the same story in two different books, that are equally\r\ndivine. It remains to be seen which will be the first to read correctly.\r\n\r\n_A._ The account in the second chapter certainly speaks explicitly\r\nenough of the creation of the soul or spirit.\r\n\r\n_B._ Yes; and observe this: that the seventh day, a mighty geological\r\nera, has elapsed between the two creations--a period long enough for the\r\nfirst race to pass entirely away, leaving behind them as their only\r\nmemorials a few skeletons, to be dug up here and there in the nineteenth\r\ncentury of the Christian era. When the last specimen of the anterior\r\nrace had been long dead, God created the new man, 'breathed into his\r\nnostrils the breath of life,' and gave him a mind and a name to\r\ndistinguish him from the former race that had borne the same image.\r\n\r\n_A._ Of course we cannot expect geologists to discriminate between the\r\ntwo races, seeing they differed only by the latter having a spiritual\r\nnature, while the former had not.\r\n\r\n_B._ Of course not.\r\n\r\n_A._ Perhaps, then, there is, after all not so much absurdity as has\r\nbeen supposed in the oriental traditions of pre-Adamite kings.\r\n\r\n_B._ It need not surprise us that there should, among primitive nations,\r\nexist some traditionary vestiges of the first race: and such traditions\r\nwere probably derived from some very reliable source. But be that as it\r\nmay, I am not afraid to trust the settlement of the entire question to\r\nthe arbitration of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO KNOWS?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Who knows but the hope that we bury to-day\r\n    May be the seed of success to-morrow?\r\n  We could not weep o'er the coffined clay\r\n    If a lovelier life it should never borrow.\r\n  Did we know that the worm had conquered all,\r\n    That Death had forever secured his plunder,\r\n  Not a sigh would escape, not a tear would fall,\r\n    For the human heart must burst asunder.\r\n  Death mimics life, and life feigns death:\r\n  What parts them but a fleeting breath?\r\n\r\n  Who knows but the love that in silence broods,\r\n    Slinking away to some lonely corner,\r\n  May yet, in the change of times and moods,\r\n    Sit proudly throned in the heart of the scorner?\r\n  I have seen a haughty soul destroy\r\n    The glittering prize that once it bled for;\r\n  I have seen the sad heart leap for joy,\r\n    And smiling grant what it vainly plead for:\r\n  True tears the flashing eye may wet,\r\n  The lip that curled may quiver yet.\r\n\r\n  Who knows but the dream that mocks our sleep\r\n    With visions that end in a sorrowful waking,\r\n  Leaving just enough of brightness to keep\r\n    Our souls from despair and our hearts from breaking,\r\n  May come in the heat of the midday glare,\r\n    Or the afternoon with its gorgeous splendor,\r\n  Palpable, real, but not less fair,\r\n    With airs as soft and touch as tender?\r\n  Morn breaks on the longest night of sorrow,\r\n  And there is more than one to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LINNET'S TRIAL. A Tale. By S. M., Author of 'Twice Lost.' Second\r\n     Edition. Loring, publisher, 319 Washington street, Boston. 1864.\r\n\r\nA moral and interesting novel. There is a fascinating freshness and\r\noriginality about it, pervaded by genial humor and strong common sense,\r\nand an utter absence of all common and clap-trap sensational expedients.\r\nThe plot is simple, but well conceived; the characters consistent and\r\nclear cut, the incidental remarks tolerant and full of spirit. We know\r\nno more true and delightful character-painting than that of Rose. Her\r\nshyness, exclusiveness, pettishness, and ignorance are delicious in the\r\nrosy girl of sixteen. Her friendship with Linnet, a woman of imaginative\r\nand impassioned stamp, is natural in conception, and skilfully rendered.\r\nLinnet is expansive and sympathetic, her sweet and all-pervading\r\ninfluence is the true charm of the book. The woman of beauty and genius\r\nripens into the perfect wife, strengthening weak hands and reviving\r\ncourage in weary, doubting hearts. 'Linnet is like an alabaster vase,\r\nonly seen to perfection when lighted up from within.'\r\n\r\nWe heartily recommend 'Linnet' to all readers of fiction, who like to\r\nstudy character through its rainbow sheen.\r\n\r\n\r\n     PHANTOM FLOWERS. A Treatise on the Art of Producing Skeleton\r\n     Leaves. Boston: J. E. Tilton & Co. 1864.\r\n\r\nA complete treatise on this beautiful art, in which typography and\r\nillustrations are alike perfect. The directions given are ample and\r\naccurate. The contents are: Chap. 1. Anatomy of a Leaf; Green and Dried\r\nLeaves. 2. Preparing the Leaves and Flowers. 3. Bleaching the Leaves and\r\nSeed Vessels. 4. Arranging the Bouquets. 5. Illustrated List of Plants\r\nfor Skeletonizing. 6. Seed Vessels. 7. The Wonders and Uses Of a Leaf.\r\n8. Leaf Printing. 9, Commercial Value of the Art; Preservation of\r\nFlowers. We have accurate cuts of the skeletonized leaves of the\r\nAmerican Swamp Magnolia, Silver Poplar, Aspen Poplar, Tulip Poplar,\r\nNorway Maple, Linden and Weeping Willow, European Sycamore, English Ash,\r\nEverlasting Pea, Elm, Deutzia, Beech, Hickory, Chestnut, Dwarf Pear,\r\nSassafras, Althea, Rose, Fringe Tree, Dutchman's Pipe, Ivy and Holly,\r\nwith proper times of gathering and individual processes of manipulation\r\nfor securing success with each. 'Fanciful though expressive,' says our\r\nauthor, 'is the appellation of 'Phantom' or 'Spiritual' Flowers; it was\r\ngiven to the first American specimens by those who produced them, and it\r\nhas since become so general as to be everywhere understood and accepted\r\nas their most appropriate name. Referring to the process by which these\r\nflowers are prepared, a Christian friend beautifully used them as\r\nemblems of the Resurrection, and as illustrating the ideas--'Sown a\r\nnatural body, raised a spiritual body,' and, 'This corruptible must put\r\non incorruption, and this mortal immortality.''\r\n\r\nAll who practise this beautiful and _lucrative_ art with any hope of\r\nsuccess, should purchase 'Phantom Flowers,' the result of _five years'_\r\nindustrious and intelligent effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n     POEMS: With Translations from the German of Geibel and Others. By\r\n     _Lucy Hamilton Hooper_. Philadelphia: Frederick Leypoldt.\r\n\r\nThese translations are of far more than ordinary merit. From his\r\nexceeding and tender simplicity, Geibel is very difficult to render\r\naright: a word too much will frequently ruin the stanza in which it may\r\nhave been introduced almost necessarily to fill up the rhythm or\r\nconsummate the rhyme; a single injudicious ornament will spoil the whole\r\neffect of the cadenced emotions of which his poems consist. We have\r\ntried Geibel, and the songs of Heine, and know the difficulties; we\r\nheartily congratulate our authoress on her success. Nor are her own\r\npoems less beautiful. Musically rhythmed, delicately worded, and purely\r\nfelt, they commend themselves to the reader. They do not soar into the\r\nregion of abstract thought; they are without pretension, mysticism, or\r\neffort. She challenges no crown, her range is limited, but our hearts\r\nswell and throb with the emotions she sings. A single specimen will best\r\nelucidate our meaning:\r\n\r\n\r\nBABY LILY.\r\n\r\n  She was a purer, fairer bud\r\n    Than summer's sun uncloses;\r\n  Spring brought her with the violets;\r\n    She left us with the roses.\r\n\r\n  A little pillow, where the print\r\n    Of her small head yet lingers;\r\n  A silver coral, tarnished o'er\r\n    With clasp of tiny fingers;\r\n\r\n  A mound, the rose bush at the head\r\n    Were all too long to measure;--\r\n  And this is _all_ that Heaven has left\r\n    Of her, our little treasure.\r\n\r\n  O human pearl, so pale and pure!\r\n    0 little lily blossom!\r\n  The angels lent a little space\r\n    To grace a mortal bosom.\r\n\r\n  The azure heavens bend above,\r\n    Unpitying and cruel;\r\n  A casket all too cold and vast\r\n    To shrine our little jewel.\r\n\r\n  We cannot picture her to mind,\r\n    An angel, crowned and holy;\r\n  A fair and helpless human thing,\r\n    Our hearts still keep her solely.\r\n\r\n  Sleep, baby, calmly in thy nest\r\n    Amid the fading flowers,\r\n  The while we strive to learn the words:\r\n    'God's will be done--not ours!'\r\n\r\n\r\n     HISTORY OF THE ROMANS UNDER THE EMPIRE. By CHARLES MERIVALE, B. D.,\r\n     late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. From the fourth\r\n     London Edition. With a copious Analytical Index. Vol. IV. New York:\r\n     D. Appleton & Co., 443 & 445 Broadway.\r\n\r\nThe character of this work is so high and so widely known that it is\r\nonly necessary to remind or inform our readers of the appearance of the\r\nfourth volume to awaken their interest. Merivale succeeds in making his\r\nsubject intensely interesting. Beginning with the anticipations of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy, the indifference of the citizens on political\r\nquestions, the legislative measures to encourage marriage, the efforts\r\nof Augustus to revive the national sentiment, this volume carries us\r\nquite through his important reign, with all its great events and\r\ndomestic dramas. We have descriptions of the nature of life in Rome,\r\nplaces of recreation, exhibitions of wild beasts and gladiators, the\r\nschools of the rhetoricians, as well as studies of the authors, Livy,\r\nVirgil, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, each reflecting in his own\r\nway the sentiments of the Augustan age. It is a complex and important\r\nperiod of history, and nobly treated by our author. Brutus and Cassius\r\nevoke no false sympathy. The character of Augustus is closely analyzed,\r\nand the sketch of the Roman dominion, in its political, social, and\r\nintellectual outlines, is able and interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIVED.\r\n\r\n     CHRISTIAN EXAMINER.
