To give the quality and texture of the state of\r\nmind and feeling of an individual or class, to create for the reader the\r\nillusion (not delusion, O able Critic!) of the intellectual atmosphere\r\nof past times, I have as a matter of course introduced many quotations;\r\nbut I have also ventured to resort frequently to the literary device\r\n(this, I know, gives the whole thing away) of telling the story by\r\nmeans of a rather free paraphrase of what some imagined spectator or\r\nparticipant might have thought or said about the matter in hand. If\r\nthe critic says that the product of such methods is not history, I am\r\nwilling to call it by any name that is better; the point of greatest\r\nrelevance being the truth and effectiveness of the illusion aimed\r\nat--the extent to which it reproduces the quality of the thought and\r\nfeeling of those days, the extent to which it enables the reader to\r\nenter into such states of mind and feeling. The truth of such history\r\n(or whatever the critic wishes to call it) cannot of course be\r\ndetermined by a mere verification of references.\r\n\r\nTo one of my colleagues, who has read the entire manuscript, I am under\r\nobligations for many suggestions and corrections in matters of detail;\r\nand I would gladly mention his name if it could be supposed that an\r\nhistorian of established reputation would wish to be associated, even in\r\nany slight way, with an enterprise of questionable orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nCarl Becker.\r\n\r\nIthaca, New York, January 6, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nThe Eve of the Revolution Chapter Chapter Title Page        Preface                         vii\r\nI.

I predict will be happy and truly\r\nglorious.--Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe 29th of January, 1757, was a notable day in the life of Ben Franklin\r\nof Philadelphia, well known in the metropolis of America as printer and\r\npolitician, and famous abroad as a scientist and Friend of the Human\r\nRace. It was on that day that the Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned\r\nhim as its agent to repair to London in support of its petition\r\nagainst the Proprietors of the Province, who were charged with having\r\n\"obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies [the Governors\r\nof Pennsylvania] with instructions inconsistent not only with the\r\nprivileges of the people, but with the service of the Crown.\" We may,\r\ntherefore, if we choose, imagine the philosopher on that day, being then\r\nin his fifty-first year, walking through the streets of this metropolis\r\nof America (a town of something less than twenty thousand inhabitants)\r\nto his modest home, and there informing his \"Dear Debby\" that her\r\nhusband, now apparently become a great man in a small world, was ordered\r\nimmediately \"home to England.\"\r\n\r\nIn those leisurely days, going home to England was no slight\r\nundertaking; and immediately, when there was any question of a great\r\njourney, meant as soon as the gods might bring it to pass. \"I had agreed\r\nwith Captain Morris, of the Pacquet at New York, for my passage,\" he\r\nwrites in the Autobiography, \"and my stores were put on board, when Lord\r\nLoudoun arrived at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavor\r\nan accommodation between the Governor and the Assembly, that his\r\nMajesty's service might not be obstructed by their dissentions.\"\r\nFranklin was the very man to effect an accommodation, when he set his\r\nmind to it, as he did on this occasion; but \"in the mean time,\" he\r\nrelates, \"the Pacquet had sailed with my sea stores, which was some loss\r\nto me, and my only recompence was his Lordship's thanks for my service,\r\nall the credit for obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now war time, and the packets were at the disposal of Lord\r\nLoudoun, commander of the forces in America. The General was good enough\r\nto inform his accommodating friend that of the two packets then at New\r\nYork, one was given out to sail on Saturday, the 12th of April--\"but,\"\r\nthe great man added very confidentially, \"I may let you know, entre\r\nnous, that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but\r\ndo not delay longer.\" As early as the 4th of April, accordingly, the\r\nprovincial printer and Friend of the Human Race, accompanied by many\r\nneighbors \"to see him out of the province,\" left Philadelphia. He\r\narrived at Trenton \"well before night,\" and expected, in case \"the roads\r\nwere no worse,\" to reach Woodbridge by the night following. In crossing\r\nover to New York on the Monday, some accident at the ferry delayed him,\r\nso that he did not reach the city till nearly noon, and he feared\r\nthat he might miss the packet after all--Lord Loudoun had so precisely\r\nmentioned Monday morning. Happily, no such thing! The packet was still\r\nthere. It did not sail that day, or the next either; and as late as the\r\n29th of April Franklin was still hanging about waiting to be off. For it\r\nwas war time and the packets waited the orders of General Loudoun, who,\r\nready in promises but slow in execution, was said to be \"like St. George\r\non the signs, always on horseback but never rides on.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin himself was a deliberate man, and at the last moment he\r\ndecided, for some reason or other, not to take the first packet. Behold\r\nhim, therefore, waiting for the second through the month of May and\r\nthe greater part of June! \"This tedious state of uncertainty and long\r\nwaiting,\" during which the agent of the Province of Pennsylvania,\r\nrunning back and forth from New York to Woodbridge, spent his time more\r\nuselessly than ever he remembered, was duly credited to the perversity\r\nof the British General. But at last they were off, and on the 26th\r\nof July, three and a half months after leaving Philadelphia, Franklin\r\narrived in London to take up the work of his mission; and there he\r\nremained, always expecting to return shortly, but always delayed, for\r\nsomething more than five years.\r\n\r\nThese were glorious days in the history of Old England, the most heroic\r\nsince the reign of Good Queen Bess. When the provincial printer arrived\r\nin London, the King and the politicians had already been forced, through\r\nmultiplied reverses in every part of the world, to confer power upon\r\nWilliam Pitt, a disagreeable man indeed, but still a great genius and\r\nWar Lord, who soon turned defeat into victory. It was the privilege of\r\nFranklin, here in the capital of the Empire, to share the exaltation\r\nengendered by those successive conquests that gave India and America\r\nto the little island kingdom, and made Englishmen, in Horace Walpole's\r\nphrase, \"heirs apparent of the Romans.\" No Briton rejoiced more\r\nsincerely than this provincial American in the extension of the Empire.\r\nHe labored with good will and good humor, and doubtless with good\r\neffect, to remove popular prejudice against his countrymen; and he wrote\r\na masterly pamphlet to prove the wisdom of retaining Canada rather than\r\nGuadaloupe at the close of the war, confidently assuring his readers\r\nthat the colonies would never, even when once the French danger was\r\nremoved, \"unite against their own nation, which protects and encourages\r\nthem, with which they have so many connections and ties of blood,\r\ninterest, and affection, and which 'tis well known they all love much\r\nmore than they love one another.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin, at least, loved Old England, and it might well be maintained\r\nthat these were the happiest years of his life. He was mentally so\r\ncosmopolitan, so much at ease in the world, that here in London he\r\nreadily found himself at home indeed. The business of his particular\r\nmission, strictly attended to, occupied no great part of his time. He\r\ndevoted long days to his beloved scientific experiments, and carried\r\non a voluminous correspondence with David Hume and Lord Kames, and with\r\nmany other men of note in England, France, and Italy. He made journeys,\r\nto Holland, to Cambridge, to ancestral places and the homes of surviving\r\nrelatives; but mostly, one may imagine, he gave himself to a steady flow\r\nof that \"agreeable and instructive conversation\" of which he was so much\r\nthe master and the devotee. He was more famous than he knew, and the\r\nreception that everywhere awaited him was flattering, and as agreeable\r\nto his unwarped and emancipated mind as it was flattering. \"The regard\r\nand friendship I meet with,\" he confesses, \"and the conversation of\r\ningenious men, give me no small pleasure\"; and at Cambridge, \"my vanity\r\nwas not a little gratified by the particular regard shown me by the\r\nChancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the University, and the Heads of the\r\nColleges.\" As the years passed, the sense of being at ease among friends\r\ngrew stronger; the serene and placid letters to \"Dear Debby\" became\r\nrather less frequent; the desire to return to America was much\r\nattenuated.\r\n\r\nHow delightful, indeed, was this Old England! \"Of all the enviable\r\nthings England has,\" he writes, \"I envy it most its people.... Why\r\nshould this little island enjoy in almost every neighborhood more\r\nsensible, virtuous, and elegant minds, than we can collect in ranging\r\none hundred leagues of our vast forests?\" What a proper place for a\r\nphilosopher to spin out the remnant of his days! The idea had occurred\r\nto him; he was persistently urged by his friend William Strahan to carry\r\nit into effect; and his other friend, David Hume, made him a pretty\r\ncompliment on the same theme: \"America has sent us many good things,\r\ngold, silver, sugar, tobacco; but you are the first philosopher for whom\r\nwe are beholden to her. It is our own fault that we have not kept him;\r\nwhence it appears that we do not agree with Solomon, that wisdom is\r\nabove gold; for we take good care never to send back an ounce of the\r\nlatter, which we once lay our fingers upon.\" The philosopher was willing\r\nenough to remain; and of the two objections which he mentioned to\r\nStrahan, the rooted aversion of his wife to embarking on the ocean and\r\nhis love for Philadelphia, the latter for the moment clearly gave him\r\nless difficulty than the former. \"I cannot leave this happy island and\r\nmy friends in it without extreme regret,\" he writes at the moment of\r\ndeparture. \"I am going from the old world to the new; and I fancy I\r\nfeel like those who are leaving this world for the next; grief at the\r\nparting; fear of the passage; hope for the future.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 1st of November, 1762, Franklin quietly slipped into\r\nPhiladelphia, he found that the new world had not forgotten him. For\r\nmany days his house was filled from morning till night with a succession\r\nof friends, old and new, come to congratulate him on his return;\r\nexcellent people all, no doubt, and yet presenting, one may suppose, a\r\nrather sharp contrast to the \"virtuous and elegant minds\" from whom\r\nhe had recently parted in England. The letters he wrote, immediately\r\nfollowing his return to America, to his friends William Strahan and Mary\r\nStevenson lack something of the cheerful and contented good humor which\r\nis Franklin's most characteristic tone. His thoughts, like those of a\r\nhomesick man, are ever dwelling on his English friends, and he still\r\nnourishes the fond hope of returning, bag and baggage, to England for\r\ngood and all. The very letter which he begins by relating the cordiality\r\nof his reception in Philadelphia he closes by assuring Strahan that \"in\r\ntwo years at fartherest I hope to settle all my affairs in such manner\r\nas that I may then conveniently remove to England--provided,\" he adds as\r\nan afterthought, \"we can persuade the good woman to cross the sea. That\r\nwill be the great difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether it was this difficulty that prevented the\r\neminent doctor, revered in two continents for his wisdom, from changing\r\nthe place of his residence. Dear Debby, as docile as a child in most\r\nrespects, very likely had her settled prejudices, of which the desire to\r\nremain on dry land may have been one, and one of the most obstinate.\r\nOr it may be that Franklin found himself too much occupied, too much\r\ninvolved in affairs after his long absence, to make even a beginning in\r\nhis cherished plan; or else, as the months passed and he settled once\r\nmore to the familiar, humdrum life of the American metropolis, sober\r\nsecond thought may have revealed to him what was doubtless a higher\r\nwisdom. \"Business, public and private, devours my time,\" he writes in\r\nMarch, 1764. \"I must return to England for repose. With such thoughts I\r\nflatter myself, and need some kind friend to put me often in mind that\r\nold trees cannot safely be transplanted.\" Perhaps, after all, Dear Debby\r\nwas this kind friend; in which case Americans must all, to this day, be\r\nmuch indebted to the good woman.\r\n\r\nAt least it was no apprehension of difficulties arising between England\r\nand the colonies that induced Franklin to remain in America. The Peace\r\nof Paris he regarded as \"the most advantageous\" of any recorded in\r\nBritish annals, very fitting to mark the close of a successful war, and\r\nwell suited to usher in the long period of prosperous felicity which\r\nshould properly distinguish the reign of a virtuous prince. Never\r\nbefore, in Franklin's opinion, were the relations between Britain and\r\nher colonies more happy; and there could be, he thought, no good reason\r\nto fear that the excellent young King would be distressed, or his\r\nprerogative diminished, by factitious parliamentary opposition.\r\n\r\nYou now fear for our virtuous young King, that the faction forming will\r\noverpower him and render his reign uncomfortable [he writes to Strahan].\r\nOn the contrary, I am of opinion that his virtue and the consciousness\r\nof his sincere intentions to make his people happy will give him\r\nfirmness and steadiness in his measures and in the support of the honest\r\nfriends he has chosen to serve him; and when that firmness is fully\r\nperceived, faction will dissolve and be dissipated like a morning fog\r\nbefore the rising sun, leaving the rest of the day clear with a sky\r\nserene and cloudless. Such after a few of the first years will be the\r\nfuture course of his Majesty's reign, which I predict will be happy\r\nand truly glorious. A new war I cannot yet see reason to apprehend. The\r\npeace will I think long continue, and your nation be as happy as they\r\ndeserve to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II THE BURDEN OF EMPIRE\r\n\r\nNothing of note in Parliament, except one slight day on the American\r\ntaxes.--Horace Walpole.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of men in England, any time before 1763, who found\r\nthat an excellent arrangement which permitted them to hold office in the\r\ncolonies while continuing to reside in London. They were thereby enabled\r\nto make debts, and sometimes even to pay them, without troubling much\r\nabout their duties; and one may easily think of them, over their claret,\r\nas Mr. Trevelyan says, lamenting the cruelty of a secretary of state\r\nwho hinted that, for form's sake at least, they had best show themselves\r\nonce in a while in America. They might have replied with Junius: \"It was\r\nnot Virginia that wanted a governor, but a court favorite that wanted a\r\nsalary.\" Certainly Virginia could do with a minimum of royal officials;\r\nbut most court favorites wanted salaries, for without salaries unendowed\r\ngentlemen could not conveniently live in London.\r\n\r\nOne of these gentlemen, in the year 1763, was Mr. Grosvenor Bedford.\r\nHe was not, to be sure, a court favorite, but a man, now well along in\r\nyears, who had long ago been appointed to be Collector of the Customs\r\nat the port of Philadelphia. The appointment had been made by the great\r\nminister, Robert Walpole, for whom Mr. Bedford had unquestionably\r\ndone some service or other, and of whose son, Horace Walpole, the\r\nletter-writer, he had continued from that day to be a kind of dependent\r\nor protégé, being precisely the sort of unobtrusive factotum which that\r\nfastidious eccentric needed to manage his mundane affairs. But now,\r\nafter this long time, when the King's business was placed in the hands\r\nof George Grenville, who entertained the odd notion that a Collector of\r\nthe Customs should reside at the port of entry where the customs were\r\ncollected rather than in London where he drew his salary, it was being\r\nnoised about, and was presently reported at Strawberry Hill, that Mr.\r\nBedford, along with many other estimable gentlemen, was forthwith to be\r\nturned out of his office.\r\n\r\nTo Horace Walpole it was a point of more than academic importance to\r\nknow whether gentlemen were to be unceremoniously turned out of their\r\noffices. As far back as 1738, while still a lad, he had himself been\r\nappointed to be Usher of the Exchequer; and as soon as he came of age,\r\nhe says, \"I took possession of two other little patent places in\r\nthe Exchequer, called Comptroller of the Pipe, and Clerk of the\r\nEstreats\"--all these places having been procured for him through the\r\ngenerosity of his father. The duties of these offices, one may suppose,\r\nwere not arduous, for it seems that they were competently administered\r\nby Mr. Grosvenor Bedford, in addition to his duties as Collector of the\r\nCustoms at the port of Philadelphia; so well administered, indeed, that\r\nHorace Walpole's income from them, which in 1740 was perhaps not more\r\nthan £1500 a year, nearly doubled in the course of a generation. And\r\nthis income, together with another thousand which he had annually from\r\nthe Collector's place in the Custom House, added to the interest of\r\n£20,000 which he had inherited, enabled him to live very well, with\r\nimmense leisure for writing odd books, and letters full of extremely\r\ninteresting comment on the levity and low aims of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nAnd so Horace Walpole, good patron that he was and competent\r\nletter-writer, very naturally, hearing that Mr. Bedford was to lose an\r\noffice to which in the course of years he had become much accustomed,\r\nsat down and wrote a letter to Mr. George Grenville in behalf of his\r\nfriend and servant. \"Though I am sensible I have no pretensions for\r\nasking you a favour, ... yet I flatter myself I shall not be thought\r\nquite impertinent in interceding for a person, who I can answer has\r\nneither been to blame nor any way deserved punishment, and therefore I\r\nthink you, Sir, will be ready to save him from prejudice. The person\r\nI mean is my deputy, Mr. Grosvenor Bedford, who, above five and twenty\r\nyears ago, was appointed Collector of the Customs in Philadelphia by my\r\nfather. I hear he is threatened to be turned out. If the least fault can\r\nbe laid to his charge, I do not desire to have him protected. If there\r\ncannot, I am too well persuaded, Sir, of your justice not to be sure you\r\nwill be pleased to protect him.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Grenville, a dry, precise man of great knowledge and industry,\r\nalmost always right in little matters and very patient of the\r\nmisapprehensions of less exact people, wrote in reply a letter which\r\nmany would think entirely adequate to the matter in hand:\r\n\r\nI have never heard [he began] of any complaint against Mr. Grosvenor\r\nBedford, or of any desire to turn him out; but by the office which you\r\ntell me he holds in North America, I believe I know the state of the\r\ncase, which I will inform you of, that you may be enabled to judge of\r\nit yourself. Heavy complaints were last year made in Parliament of the\r\nstate of our revenues in North America which amount to between £1,000\r\nand £2,000 a year, the collecting of which costs upon the establishment\r\nof the Customs in Great Britain between £7,000 and £8,000 a year. This,\r\nit was urged, arose from the making all these offices sinecures in\r\nEngland. When I came to the Treasury ¹ I directed the Commissioners of\r\nthe Customs to be written to, that they might inform us how the revenue\r\nmight be improved, and to what causes they attributed the present\r\ndiminished state of it.... The principal cause which they assigned\r\nwas the absence of the officers who lived in England by leave of the\r\nTreasury, which they proposed should be recalled. This we complied with,\r\nand ordered them all to their duty, and the Commissioners of the Customs\r\nto present others in the room of such as should not obey. I take it for\r\ngranted that this is Mr. Bedford's case. If it is, it will be attended\r\nwith difficulty to make an exception, as they are every one of them\r\napplying to be excepted out of the orders.... If it is not so, or if\r\nMr. Bedford can suggest to me any proper means of obviating it without\r\noverturning the whole regulation, he will do me a sensible pleasure.\r\n\r\n¹ On the resignation of Lord Bute in April, 1763, Grenville formed a\r\nministry, himself taking the two offices of First Lord of the Treasury\r\nand Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to show that Mr. Bedford was able to do Mr.\r\nGrenville this \"sensible pleasure.\" The incident, apparently closed, was\r\none of many indications that a new policy for dealing with America was\r\nabout to be inaugurated; and although Grenville had been made minister\r\nfor reasons that were remote enough from any question of efficiency\r\nin government, no better man could have been chosen for applying to\r\ncolonial administration the principles of good business management. His\r\nconnection with the Treasury, as well as the natural bent of his mind,\r\nhad made him \"confessedly the ablest man of business in the House of\r\nCommons.\" The Governors of the Bank of England, very efficient men\r\ncertainly, held it a great point in the minister's favor that they\r\n\"could never do business with any man with the same ease they had done\r\nit with him.\" Undoubtedly the first axiom of business is that one's\r\naccounts should be kept straight, one's books nicely balanced;\r\nthe second, that one's assets should exceed one's liabilities. Mr.\r\nGrenville, accordingly, \"had studied the revenues with professional\r\nassiduity, and something of professional ideas seemed to mingle in all\r\nhis regulations concerning them.\" He \"felt the weight of debt, amounting\r\nat this time to one hundred and fifty-eight millions, which oppressed\r\nhis country, and he looked to the amelioration of the revenue as the\r\nonly mode of relieving it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true there were some untouched sources of revenue still available\r\nin England. As sinecures went in that day, Mr. Grosvenor Bedford's was\r\nnot of the best; and on any consideration of the matter from the point\r\nof view of revenue only, Grenville might well have turned his attention\r\nto a different class of officials; for example, to the Master of the\r\nRolls in Ireland, Mr. Rigby, who was also Paymaster of the Forces, and\r\nto whose credit there stood at the Bank of England, as Mr. Trevelyan\r\nassures us, a million pounds of the public money, the interest of which\r\nwas paid to him \"or to his creditors.\" This was a much better thing than\r\nGrosvenor Bedford had with his paltry collectorship at Philadelphia;\r\nand the interest on a million pounds, more or less, had it been diverted\r\nfrom Mr. Rigby's pocket to the public treasury, would perhaps have\r\nequaled the entire increase in the revenue to be expected from even\r\nthe most efficient administration of the customs in all the ports of\r\nAmerica. In addition, it should perhaps be said that Mr. Rigby, although\r\nexcelled by none, was by no means the only man in high place with a good\r\ndegree of talent for exploiting the common chest.\r\n\r\nThe reform of such practices, very likely, was work for a statesman\r\nrather than for a man of business. A good man of business, called upon\r\nto manage the King's affairs, was likely to find many obstacles in the\r\nway of depriving the Paymaster of the Forces of his customary sources\r\nof income, and Mr. Grenville, at least, never attempted anything so\r\nhazardous. Scurrilous pamphleteers, in fact, had made it a charge\r\nagainst the minister that he had increased rather than diminished the\r\nevil of sinecures--\"It had been written in pamphlets that £400,000 a\r\nyear was dealt out in pensions\"; from which charge the able Chancellor,\r\non the occasion of opening his first budget in the House of Commons, the\r\n9th of March, 1764, defended himself by denying that the sums were \"so\r\ngreat as alleged.\" It was scarcely an adequate defense; but the truth\r\nis that Grenville was sure to be less distressed by a bad custom, no\r\nlaw forbidding, than by a law, good or bad, not strictly enforced,\r\nparticularly if the law was intended to bring in a revenue.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, therefore, the minister turned to America, where it was\r\na notorious fact that there were revenue laws that had not been enforced\r\nthese many years. Mr. Grenville, we may suppose, since it was charged\r\nagainst him in a famous epigram, read the American dispatches with\r\nconsiderable care, so that it is quite possible he may have chanced\r\nto see and to shake his head over the sworn statement of Mr. Sampson\r\nToovey, a statement which throws much light upon colonial liberties and\r\nthe practices of English officials in those days:\r\n\r\nI, Sampson Toovey [so the statement runs], Clerk to James Cockle, Esq.,\r\nCollector of His Majesty's Customs for the Port of Salem, do declare on\r\noath, that ever since I have been in the office, it hath been customary\r\nfor said Cockle to receive of the masters of vessels entering from\r\nLisbon, casks of wine, boxes of fruit, etc., which was a gratuity for\r\nsuffering their vessels to be entered with salt or ballast only, and\r\npassing over unnoticed such cargoes of wine, fruit, etc., which are\r\nprohibited to be imported into His Majesty's plantations. Part of which\r\nwine, fruit, etc., the said James Cockle used to share with Governor\r\nBernard. And I further declare that I used to be the negotiator of\r\nthis business, and receive the wine, fruit, etc., and dispose of them\r\nagreeable to Mr. Cockle's orders. Witness my hand. Sampson Toovey.\r\n\r\nThe curious historian would like much to know, in case Mr. Grenville did\r\nsee the declaration of Sampson Toovey, whether he saw also a letter\r\nin which Governor Bernard gave it as his opinion that if the colonial\r\ngovernments were to be refashioned it should be on a new plan, since\r\n\"there is no system in North America fit to be made a module of.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Grenville, whether or not he ever saw this letter from\r\nGovernor Bernard, was familiar with the ideas which inspired it.\r\nMost crown officials in America, and the governors above all, finding\r\nthemselves little more than executive agents of the colonial assemblies,\r\nhad long clamored for the remodeling of colonial governments: the\r\ncharters, they said, should be recalled; the functions of the assemblies\r\nshould be limited and more precisely defined; judges should be appointed\r\nat the pleasure of the King; and judges and governors alike should be\r\npaid out of a permanent civil list in England drawn from revenue raised\r\nin America. In urging these changes, crown officials in America were\r\npowerfully supported by men of influence in England; by Halifax since\r\nthe day, some fifteen years before, when he was appointed to the office\r\nof Colonial Secretary; by the brilliant Charles Townshend who, in\r\nthe year 1763, as first Lord of the Treasury in Bute's ministry, had\r\nformulated a bill which would have been highly pleasing to Governor\r\nBernard had it been passed into law. And now similar schemes were being\r\nurged upon Grenville by his own colleagues, notably by the Earl of\r\nHalifax, who is said to have become, in a formal interview with the\r\nfirst minister, extremely heated and eager in the matter.\r\n\r\nBut all to no purpose. Mr. Grenville was well content with the form of\r\nthe colonial governments, being probably of Pope's opinion that \"the\r\nsystem that is best administered is best.\" In Grenville's opinion, the\r\nMassachusetts government was good enough, and all the trouble arose from\r\nthe inattention of royal officials to their manifest duties and from\r\nthe pleasant custom of depositing at Governor Bernard's back door sundry\r\npipes of wine with the compliments of Mr. Cockle. Most men in England\r\nagreed that such pleasant customs had been tolerated long enough.\r\nTo their suppression the first minister accordingly gave his best\r\nattention; and while Mr. Rigby continued to enjoy great perquisites in\r\nEngland, many obscure customs officials, such as Grosvenor Bedford,\r\nwere ordered to their posts to prevent small peculations in America. To\r\nassist them, or their successors, in this business, ships of war were\r\nstationed conveniently for the intercepting of smugglers, general writs\r\nwere authorized to facilitate the search for goods illegally entered,\r\nand the governors, His Excellency Governor Bernard among the number,\r\nwere newly instructed to give their best efforts to the enforcement of\r\nthe trade acts.\r\n\r\nAll this was but an incident, to be sure, in the minister's general\r\nscheme for \"ameliorating the revenue.\" It was not until the 9th of\r\nMarch, 1764, that Grenville, \"not disguising how much he was hurt\r\nby abuse,\" opened his first budget, \"fully, for brevity was not his\r\nfailing,\" and still with great \"art and ability.\" Although ministers\r\nwere to be congratulated, he thought, \"on the revenue being managed with\r\nmore frugality than in the late reign,\" the House scarcely need be\r\ntold that the war had greatly increased the debt, an increase not to\r\nbe placed at a lower figure than some seventy odd millions; and so, on\r\naccount of this great increase in the debt, and in spite of gratifying\r\nadvances in the customs duties and the salutary cutting off of the\r\nGerman subsidies, taxes were now, the House would easily understand,\r\nnecessarily much higher than formerly--\"our taxes,\" he said, \"exceeded\r\nby three millions what they were in 1754.\" Much money, doubtless, could\r\nstill be raised on the land tax, if the House was at all disposed to put\r\non another half shilling in the pound. Ministers could take it quite for\r\ngranted, however, that country squires, sitting on the benches, would\r\nnot be disposed to increase the land tax, but would much prefer some\r\nskillful manipulation of the colonial customs, provided only there was\r\nsome one who understood that art well enough to explain to the House\r\nwhere such duties were meant to fall and how much they might reasonably\r\nbe expected to bring in. And there, in fact, was Mr. Grenville\r\nexplaining it all with \"art and ability,\" for which task, indeed, there\r\ncould be none superior to his Majesty's Chancellor of the Exchequer, who\r\nhad so long \"studied the revenue with professional assiduity.\"\r\n\r\nThe items of the budget, rather dull reading now and none too\r\nilluminating, fell pleasantly upon the ears of country squires\r\nsitting there on the benches; and the particular taxes no doubt seemed\r\nreasonably clear to them, even if they had no perfect understanding of\r\nthe laws of incidence, inasmuch as sundry of the new duties apparently\r\nfell upon the distant Americans, who were known to be rich and were\r\ngenerally thought, on no less an authority than Jasper Mauduit, agent of\r\nthe Province of Massachusetts Bay, to be easily able and not unwilling\r\nto pay considerable sums towards ameliorating the revenue. It was odd,\r\nperhaps, that Americans should be willing to pay; but that was no great\r\nmatter, if they were able, since no one could deny their obligation. And\r\nso country squires, and London merchants too, listened comfortably to\r\nthe reading of the budget so well designed to relieve the one of taxes\r\nand swell the profits flowing into the coffers of the other.\r\n\r\n\"That a duty of £2 19s. 9d. per cwt. avoirdupois, be laid upon all\r\nforeign coffee, imported from any place (except Great Britain) into\r\nthe British colonies and plantations in America. That a duty of 6d. per\r\npound weight be laid upon all foreign indico, imported into the said\r\ncolonies and plantations. That a duty of £7 per ton be laid upon all\r\nwine of the growth of the Madeiras, or of any other island or place,\r\nlawfully imported from the respective place of the growth of such wine,\r\ninto the said colonies and plantations. That a duty of 10s. per ton be\r\nlaid upon all Portugal, Spanish, or other wine (except French wine),\r\nimported from Great Britain into the said colonies and plantations. That\r\na duty of 2s. per pound weight be laid upon all wrought silks, Bengals,\r\nand stuffs mixed with silk or herba; of the manufacture of Persia,\r\nChina, or East India, imported from Great Britain into the said colonies\r\nand plantations. That a duty of 2s. 6d. per piece be laid upon all\r\ncallicoes....\"\r\n\r\nThe list no doubt was a long one; and quite right, too, thought country\r\nsquires, all of whom, to a man, were willing to pay no more land tax.\r\n\r\nOther men besides country squires were interested in Mr. Grenville's\r\nbudget, notably the West Indian sugar planters, virtually and actually\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons and voting there this day. Many of\r\nthem were rich men no doubt; but sugar planting, they would assure you\r\nin confidence, was not what it had been; and if they were well off after\r\na fashion, they might have been much better off but for the shameless\r\nfrauds which for thirty years had made a dead letter of the Molasses Act\r\nof 1733. It was notorious that the merchants of the northern and middle\r\ncolonies, regarding neither the Acts of Trade nor the dictates of\r\nnature, had every year carried their provisions and fish to the foreign\r\nislands, receiving in exchange molasses, cochineal, \"medical druggs,\"\r\nand \"gold and silver in bullion and coin.\" With molasses the thrifty New\r\nEnglanders made great quantities of inferior rum, the common drink of\r\nthat day, regarded as essential to the health of sailors engaged in\r\nfishing off the Grand Banks, and by far the cheapest and most effective\r\ninstrument for procuring negroes in Africa or for inducing the western\r\nIndians to surrender their valuable furs for some trumpery of colored\r\ncloth or spangled bracelet. All this thriving traffic did not benefit\r\nBritish planters, who had molasses of their own and a superior quality\r\nof rum which they were not unwilling to sell.\r\n\r\nSuch traffic, since it did not benefit them, British planters were\r\ndisposed to think must be bad for England. They were therefore willing\r\nto support Mr. Grenville's budget, which proposed that the importation\r\nof foreign rum into any British colony be prohibited in future; and\r\nwhich further proposed that the Act of 6 George II, c. 13, be continued,\r\nwith modifications to make it effective, the modifications of chief\r\nimportance being the additional duty of twenty-two shillings per\r\nhundredweight upon all sugar and the reduction by one half of the\r\nprohibitive duty of sixpence on all foreign molasses imported into the\r\nBritish plantations. It was a matter of minor importance doubtless, but\r\none to which they had no objections since the minister made a point of\r\nit, that the produce of all the duties which should be raised by virtue\r\nof the said act, made in the sixth year of His late Majesty's reign, \"be\r\npaid into the receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer, and there reserved,\r\nto be from time to time disposed of by Parliament, towards defraying the\r\nnecessary expences of defending, protecting, and securing the British\r\ncolonies and plantations in America.\"\r\n\r\nWith singularly little debate, honorable and right honorable members\r\nwere ready to vote this new Sugar Act, having the minister's word for\r\nit that it would be enforced, the revenue thereby much improved, and a\r\nsudden stop put to the long-established illicit traffic with the\r\nforeign islands, a traffic so beneficial to the northern colonies, so\r\nprejudicial to the Empire and the pockets of planters. Thus it was that\r\nMr. Grenville came opportunely to the aid of the Spanish authorities,\r\nwho for many years had employed their guarda costas in a vain effort to\r\nsuppress this very traffic, conceiving it, oddly enough, to be injurious\r\nto Spain and highly advantageous to Britain.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Spanish authorities regarded the West Indian trade\r\nas a commercial system rather than as a means of revenue. This aspect of\r\nthe matter, the commercial effects of his measures, Mr. Grenville at all\r\nevents managed not to take sufficiently into account, which was rather\r\nodd, seeing that he professed to hold the commercial system embodied in\r\nthe Navigation and Trade Acts in such high esteem, as a kind of\r\n\"English Palladium.\" No one could have wished less than Grenville to lay\r\nsacrilegious hands on this Palladium, have less intended to throw sand\r\ninto the nicely adjusted bearings of the Empire's smoothly working\r\ncommercial system. If he managed nevertheless to do something of this\r\nsort, it was doubtless by virtue of being such a \"good man of business,\"\r\nby virtue of viewing the art of government too narrowly as a question of\r\nrevenue only. For the moment, preoccupied as they were with the quest of\r\nrevenue, the new measures seemed to Mr. Grenville and to the squires\r\nand planters who voted them well adapted to raising a moderate sum, part\r\nonly of some £350,000, for the just and laudable purpose of \"defraying\r\nthe necessary expences of defending, protecting, and securing the\r\nBritish colonies and plantations in America.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem of colonial defense, so closely connected with the question\r\nof revenue, was none of Grenville's making but was a legacy of the war\r\nand of that Peace of Paris which had added an immense territory to the\r\nEmpire. When the diplomats of England and France at last discovered, in\r\nsome mysterious manner, that it had \"pleased the Most High to diffuse\r\nthe spirit of union and concord among the Princes,\" the world was\r\ninformed that, as the price of \"a Christian, universal, and perpetual\r\npeace,\" France would cede to England what had remained to her of Nova\r\nScotia, Canada, and all the possessions of France on the left bank of\r\nthe Mississippi except the City of New Orleans and the island on which\r\nit stands; that she would cede also the islands of Grenada and the\r\nGrenadines, the islands of St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago, and the\r\nRiver Senegal with all of its forts and factories; and that she would\r\nfor the future be content, so far as her activities in India were\r\nconcerned, with the five factories which she possessed there at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1749.\r\n\r\nThe average Briton, as well as honorable and right honorable members of\r\nthe House, had known that England possessed colonies and had understood\r\nthat colonies, as a matter of course, existed to supply him with sugar\r\nand rice, indigo and tobacco, and in return to buy at a good price\r\nwhatever he might himself wish to sell. Beyond all this he had given\r\nslight attention to the matter of colonies until the great Pitt had\r\nsomewhat stirred his slow imagination with talk of empire and destiny.\r\nIt was doubtless a liberalizing as well as a sobering revelation to\r\nbe told that he was the \"heir apparent of the Romans,\" with the\r\nresponsibilities that are implied in having a high mission in the\r\nworld. Now that his attention was called to the matter, it seemed to the\r\naverage Briton that in meeting the obligation of this high mission and\r\nin dealing with this far-flung empire, a policy of efficiency such as\r\nthat advocated by Mr. Grenville might well replace a policy of salutary\r\nneglect; and if the national debt had doubled during the war, as he was\r\nauthoritatively assured, why indeed should not the Americans, grown rich\r\nunder the fostering care of England and lately freed from the menace of\r\nFrance by the force of British arms, be expected to observe the Trade\r\nActs and to contribute their fair share to the defense of that new world\r\nof which they were the chief beneficiaries?\r\n\r\nIf Americans were quite ready in their easy-going way to take chances in\r\nthe matter of defense, hoping that things would turn out for the best\r\nin the future as they had in the past, British statesmen and right\r\nhonorable members of the House, viewing the question broadly and without\r\nprovincial illusions, understood that a policy of preparedness was the\r\nonly salvation; a policy of muddling through would no longer suffice\r\nas it had done in the good old days before country squires and London\r\nmerchants realized that their country was a world power. In those days,\r\nwhen the shrewd Robert Walpole refused to meddle with schemes for taxing\r\nAmerica, the accepted theory of defense was a simple one. If Britain\r\npoliced the sea and kept the Bourbons in their place, it was thought\r\nthat the colonies might be left to manage the Indians; fur traders,\r\nwhose lure the red man could not resist, and settlers occupying the\r\nlands beyond the mountains, so it was said, would do the business. In\r\n1749, five hundred thousand acres of land had been granted to the Ohio\r\nCompany \"in the King's interest\" and \"to cultivate a friendship with\r\nthe nations of Indians inhabiting those parts\"; and as late as 1754 the\r\nBoard of Trade was still encouraging the rapid settling of the West,\r\n\"inasmuch as nothing can more effectively tend to defeat the dangerous\r\ndesigns of the French.\"\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the last French war it may well have seemed to the Board\r\nof Trade that this policy was being attended with gratifying results.\r\nIn the year 1749, La Galissonière, the acting Governor of Canada,\r\ncommissioned Céloron de Blainville to take possession of the Ohio\r\nValley, which he did in form, descending the river to the Maumee, and so\r\nto Lake Erie and home again, having at convenient points proclaimed\r\nthe sovereignty of Louis XV over that country, and having laid down,\r\nas evidence of the accomplished fact, certain lead plates bearing\r\nawe-inspiring inscriptions, some of which have been discovered and\r\nare preserved to this day. It was none the less a dangerous junket.\r\nEverywhere Blainville found the Indians of hostile mind; everywhere, in\r\nevery village almost, he found English traders plying their traffic and\r\n\"cultivating a friendship with the Indians\"; so that upon his return\r\nin 1750, in spite of the lead plates so securely buried, he must needs\r\nwrite in his journal: \"All I can say is that the nations of those\r\ncountries are ill disposed towards the French and devoted to the\r\nEnglish.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of the war all this devotion was nevertheless\r\nseen to be of little worth. Like Providence, the Indians were sure to\r\nside with the big battalions. For want of a few effective garrisons at\r\nthe beginning, the English found themselves deserted by their quondam\r\nallies, and although they recovered this facile allegiance as soon as\r\nthe French garrisons were taken, it was evident enough in the late years\r\nof the war that fear alone inspired the red man's loyalty. The Indian\r\napparently did not realize at this early date that his was an inferior\r\nrace destined to be supplanted. Of a primitive and uncultivated\r\nintelligence, it was not possible for him to foresee the beneficent\r\ndesigns of the Ohio Company or to observe with friendly curiosity the\r\nsurveyors who came to draw imaginary lines through the virgin forest.\r\nAnd therefore, even in an age when the natural rights of man were being\r\nloudly proclaimed, the \"Nations of Indians inhabiting those parts\" were\r\nonly too ready to believe what the Virginia traders told them of\r\nthe Pennsylvanians, what the Pennsylvania traders told them of the\r\nVirginians--that the fair words of the English were but a kind of mask\r\nto conceal the greed of men who had no other desire than to deprive the\r\nred man of his beloved hunting grounds.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the industrious men with pedantic minds who day by day\r\nread the dispatches that accumulated in the office of the Board of Trade\r\nbecame aware, during the years from 1758 to 1761, that the old policy\r\nof defense was not altogether adequate. \"The granting of lands hitherto\r\nunsettled,\" so the Board reported in 1761, \"appears to be a measure of\r\nthe most dangerous tendency.\" In December of the same year all governors\r\nwere accordingly forbidden \"to pass grants ... or encourage settlements\r\nupon any lands within the said colonies which may interfere with the\r\nIndians bordering upon them.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy thus initiated found final expression in the famous\r\nProclamation of 1763, in the early months of Grenville's ministry. By\r\nthe terms of the Proclamation no further grants were to be made within\r\nlands \"which, not having been ceded to, or purchased by us, are reserved\r\nto the said Indians\"--that is to say, \"all the lands lying to the\r\nwestward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from\r\nthe west or the northwest.\" All persons who had \"either willfully or\r\ninadvertently seated themselves\" on the reserved lands were required\r\n\"forthwith to remove themselves\"; and for the future no man was to\r\npresume to trade with the Indians without first giving bond to observe\r\nsuch regulations as \"we shall at any time think fit to ... direct for\r\nthe benefit of the said trade.\" All these provisions were designed \"to\r\nthe end that the Indians may be convinced of our justice and determined\r\nresolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent.\" By royal act\r\nthe territory west of the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, from Florida\r\nto 50° north latitude, was thus closed to settlement \"for the present\"\r\nand \"reserved to the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken measures to protect the Indians against the colonists,\r\nthe mother country was quite ready to protect the colonists against the\r\nIndians. Rash Americans were apt to say the danger was over now that the\r\nFrench were \"expelled from Canada.\" This statement was childish\r\nenough in view of the late Pontiac uprising which was with such\r\ngreat difficulty suppressed--if indeed one could say that it was\r\nsuppressed--by a general as efficient even as Amherst, with seasoned\r\nBritish troops at his command. The red man, even if he submitted\r\noutwardly, harbored in his vengeful heart the rankling memory of many\r\ngriefs, real or imaginary; and he was still easily swayed by his ancient\r\nbut now humiliated French friends, who had been \"expelled from Canada\"\r\nonly indeed in a political sense but were still very much there as\r\npromoters of trouble. What folly, therefore, to talk of withdrawing\r\nthe troops from America! No sane man but could see that, under the\r\ncircumstances, such a move was quite out of the question.\r\n\r\nIt would materially change the circumstances, undoubtedly, if Americans\r\ncould ever be induced to undertake, in any systematic and adequate\r\nmanner, to provide for their own defense in their own way. In that case\r\nthe mother country would be only too glad to withdraw her troops, of\r\nwhich indeed she had none too many. But it was well known what the\r\ncolonists could be relied upon to do, or rather what they could be\r\nrelied upon not to do, in the way of coöperative effort. Ministers had\r\nnot forgotten that on the eve of the last war, at the very climax of the\r\ndanger, the colonial assemblies had rejected a Plan of Union prepared\r\nby Benjamin Franklin, the one man, if any man there was, to bring the\r\ncolonies together. They had rejected the plan as involving too great\r\nconcentration of authority, and they were unwilling to barter the\r\nveriest jot or tittle of their much prized provincial liberty for any\r\namount of protection. And if they rejected this plan--a very mild and\r\nharmless plan, ministers were bound to think--it was not likely they\r\ncould be induced, in time of peace, to adopt any plan that might be\r\nthought adequate in England. Such a plan, for example, was that prepared\r\nby the Board of Trade, by which commissioners appointed by the governors\r\nwere empowered to determine the military establishment and to apportion\r\nthe expense of maintaining it among the several colonies on the basis\r\nof wealth and population. Assemblies which for years past had\r\nsystematically deprived governors of all discretionary power to expend\r\nmoney raised by the assemblies themselves would surely never surrender\r\nto governors the power of determining how much assemblies should raise\r\nfor governors to expend.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it might be said with truth that the colonies had voluntarily\r\ncontributed more than their fair share in the last war; but it was also\r\ntrue that Pitt, and Pitt alone, could get them to do this. The King\r\ncould not always count on there being in England a great genius like\r\nPitt, and besides he did not always find it convenient, for reasons\r\nwhich could be given, to employ a great genius like Pitt. A system\r\nof defense had to be designed for normal times and normal men; and in\r\nnormal times with normal men at the helm, ministers were agreed,\r\nthe American attitude towards defense was very cleverly described by\r\nFranklin: \"Everyone cries, a Union is absolutely necessary, but when\r\nit comes to the manner and form of the Union, their weak noddles are\r\nperfectly distracted.\"\r\n\r\nNoddles of ministers, however, were in no way distracted but saw clearly\r\nthat, if Americans could not agree on any plan of defense, there was no\r\nalternative but \"an interposition of the authority of Parliament.\" Such\r\ninterposition, recommended by the Board of Trade and already proposed\r\nby Charles Townshend in the last ministry, was now taken in hand by\r\nGrenville. The troops were to remain in America; the Mutiny Act, which\r\nrequired soldiers in barracks to be furnished with provisions and\r\nutensils by local authorities, and which as a matter of course went\r\nwhere the army went, was supplemented by the Quartering Act, which\r\nmade further provision for the billeting and supplying of the troops\r\nin America. And for raising some part of the general maintenance fund\r\nministers could think of no tax more equitable, or easier to be levied\r\nand collected, than a stamp tax. Some such tax, stamp tax or poll tax,\r\nhad often been recommended by colonial governors, as a means of bringing\r\nthe colonies \"to a sense of their duty to the King, to awaken them to\r\ntake care of their lives and their fortunes.\" A crown officer in North\r\nCarolina, Mr. M'Culloh, was good enough to assure Mr. Charles Jenkinson,\r\none of the Secretaries of the Treasury, backing up his assertion\r\nwith sundry statistical exhibits, that a stamp tax on the continental\r\ncolonies would easily yield £60,000, and twice that sum if extended to\r\nthe West Indies. As early as September 23, 1763, Mr. Jenkinson, acting\r\non an authorization of the Treasury Board, accordingly wrote to the\r\nCommissioners of Stamped Duties, directing them \"to prepare, for their\r\nLordships' consideration, a draft of an act for imposing proper stamp\r\nduties on His Majesty's subjects in America and the West Indies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Grenville, who was not in any case the man to do things in a hurry,\r\nnevertheless proceeded very leisurely in the matter. He knew very well\r\nthat Pitt had refused to \"burn his fingers\" with any stamp tax; and some\r\nmen, such as his friend and secretary, Mr. Jackson, for example, and\r\nthe Earl of Hillsborough, advised him to abandon the project altogether,\r\nwhile others urged delay at least, in order that Americans might have an\r\nopportunity to present their objections, if they had any. It was decided\r\ntherefore to postpone the matter for a year; and in presenting the\r\nbudget on March 9, 1764, the first minister merely gave notice that \"it\r\nmaybe proper to charge certain stamp duties in the said colonies and\r\nplantations.\" Of all the plans for taxing America, he said, this one\r\nseemed to him the best; yet he was not wedded to it, and would willingly\r\nadopt any other preferred by the colonists, if they could suggest\r\nany other of equal efficacy. Meanwhile, he wished only to call upon\r\nhonorable members of the House to say now, if any were so minded, that\r\nParliament had not the right to impose any tax, external or internal,\r\nupon the colonies; to which solemn question, asked in full house, there\r\nwas not one negative, nor any reply except Alderman Beckford saying: \"As\r\nwe are stout, I hope we shall be merciful.\"\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that Americans did have objections to a stamp tax.\r\nWhether it were equitable or not, they would rather it should not be\r\nlaid, really preferring not to be dished up in any sauce whatever,\r\nhowever fine. The tax might, as ministers said, be easily collected, or\r\nits collection might perhaps be attended with certain difficulties;\r\nin either case it would remain, for reasons which they were ready to\r\nadvance, a most objectionable tax. Certain colonial agents then in\r\nEngland accordingly sought an interview with the first minister in order\r\nto convince him, if possible, of this fact. Grenville was very likely\r\nmore than ready to grant them an interview, relying upon the strength of\r\nhis position, on his \"tenderness for the subjects in America,\" and\r\nupon his well-known powers of persuasion, to bring them to his way\r\nof thinking. To get from the colonial agents a kind of assent to his\r\nmeasure would be to win a point of no slight strategic value, there\r\nbeing at least a modicum of truth in the notion that just government\r\nsprings from the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\nI have proposed the resolution [the minister explained to the agents]\r\nfrom a real regard and tenderness for the subjects in the colonies. It\r\nis highly reasonable they should contribute something towards the charge\r\nof protecting themselves, and in aid of the great expense Great Britain\r\nhas put herself to on their account. No tax appears to me so easy and\r\nequitable as a stamp duty. It will fall only upon property, will be\r\ncollected by the fewest officers, and will be equally spread over\r\nAmerica and the West Indies.... It does not require any number of\r\nofficers vested with extraordinary powers of entering houses, or extend\r\na sort of influence which I never wished to increase. The colonists\r\nnow have it in their power, by agreeing to this tax, to establish a\r\nprecedent for their being consulted before any tax is imposed upon them\r\nby Parliament; for their approbation of it being signified to Parliament\r\nnext year ... will afford a forcible argument for the like proceeding\r\nin all such cases. If they think of any other mode of taxation more\r\nconvenient to them, and make any proposition of equal efficacy with the\r\nstamp duty, I will give it all due consideration.\r\n\r\nThe agents appear at least to have been silenced by this speech, which\r\nwas, one must admit, so fatherly and so very reasonable in tone; and\r\ndoubtless Grenville thought them convinced, too, since he always so\r\nperfectly convinced himself. At all events, he found it possible, for\r\nthis or for some other reason, to put the whole matter out of his mind\r\nuntil the next year. The patriotic American historian, well instructed\r\nin the importance of the Stamp Act, has at first a difficulty in\r\nunderstanding how it could occupy, among the things that interested\r\nEnglish statesmen at this time, a strictly subordinate place; and\r\nhe wonders greatly, as he runs with eager interest through the\r\ncorrespondence of Grenville for the year 1764, to find it barely\r\nmentioned there. Whether the King received him less coldly today than\r\nthe day before yesterday was apparently more on the minister's mind than\r\nany possibility that the Stamp Act might be received rather warmly in\r\nthe colonies. The contemporaries of Grenville, even Pitt himself, have\r\nalmost as little to say about the coming great event; all of which\r\ncompels the historian, reviewing the matter judiciously, to reflect\r\nsadly that Englishmen of that day were not as fully aware of the\r\nimportance of the measure before it was passed as good patriots have\r\nsince become.\r\n\r\nThere is much to confirm this notion in the circumstances attending the\r\npassage of the bill through Parliament in the winter of 1765. Grenville\r\nwas perhaps further reassured, in spite of persistent rumors of much\r\nhigh talk in America, by the results of a second interview which he had\r\nwith the colonial agents just before introducing the measure into\r\nthe House of Commons. \"I take no pleasure,\" he again explained in his\r\nreasonable way, \"in bringing upon myself their resentments; it is my\r\nduty to manage the revenue. I have really been made to believe that,\r\nconsidering the whole circumstances of the mother country and the\r\ncolonies, the latter can and ought to pay something to the common cause.\r\nI know of no better way than that now pursuing to lay such a tax. If you\r\ncan tell of a better, I will adopt it.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin, who was present with the others on this occasion, ventured\r\nto suggest that the \"usual constitutional way\" of obtaining colonial\r\nsupport, through the King's requisition, would be better. \"Can you\r\nagree,\" asked Grenville, \"on the proportions each colony should raise?\"\r\nNo, they could not agree, as Franklin was bound to admit, knowing the\r\nfact better than most men. And if no adequate answer was forthcoming\r\nfrom Franklin, a man so ready in expedients and so practiced in the\r\nsubtleties of dialectic, it is no great wonder that Grenville thought\r\nthe agents now fully convinced by his reasoning, which after all was\r\nonly an impersonal formulation of the inexorable logic of the situation.\r\n\r\nProceeding thus leisurely, having taken so much pains to elicit\r\nreasonable objection and none being forthcoming, Grenville, quite\r\nsure of his ground, brought in from the Ways and Means Committee, in\r\nFebruary, 1765, the fifty-five resolutions which required that stamped\r\npaper, printed by the government and sold by officers appointed for that\r\npurpose, be used for nearly all legal documents, for all customs papers,\r\nfor appointments to all offices carrying a salary of £20 except military\r\nand judicial offices, for all grants of privilege and franchises made\r\nby the colonial assemblies, for licenses to retail liquors, for\r\nall pamphlets, advertisements, handbills, newspapers, almanacs, and\r\ncalendars, and for the sale of packages containing playing cards and\r\ndice. The expediency of the act was now explained to the House, as it\r\nhad been explained to the agents. That the act was legal, which few\r\npeople in fact denied, Grenville, doing everything thoroughly and with\r\nsystem, proceeded to demonstrate also. The colonies claim, he said, \"the\r\nprivilege of all British subjects of being taxed only with their own\r\nconsent.\" Well, for his part, he hoped they might always enjoy that\r\nprivilege. \"May this sacred pledge of liberty,\" cried the minister with\r\nunwonted eloquence, \"be preserved inviolate to the utmost verge of our\r\ndominions and to the latest pages of our history.\" But Americans were\r\nclearly wrong in supposing the Stamp Act would deprive them of the\r\nrights of Englishmen, for, upon any ground on which it could be said\r\nthat Englishmen were represented, it could be maintained, and he was\r\nfree to assert, that Americans were represented, in Parliament, which\r\nwas the common council of the whole Empire.\r\n\r\nThe measure was well received. Mr. Jackson supposed that Parliament\r\nhad a right to tax America, but he much doubted the expediency of the\r\npresent act. If it was necessary, as ministers claimed, to tax the\r\ncolonies, the latter should be permitted to elect some part of the\r\nParliament, \"otherwise the liberties of America, I do not say will be\r\nlost, but will be in danger.\" The one notable event of this \"slight day\"\r\nwas occasioned by a remark of Charles Townshend, who asked with\r\nsome asperity whether \"these American children, planted by our care,\r\nnourished up by our indulgence to a degree of strength and opulence,\r\nand protected by our arms,\" would now be so unfilial as to \"grudge to\r\ncontribute their mite to relieve us from the heavy burden under which we\r\nlie?\" Upon which Colonel Isaac Barré sprang to his feet and delivered\r\nan impassioned, unpremeditated reply which stirred the dull House for\r\nperhaps three minutes:\r\n\r\nThey planted by your care! No; your oppression planted them in America.\r\nThey fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated, inhospitable\r\ncountry, where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to\r\nwhich human nature is liable.... They nourished up by your indulgence!\r\nThey grew by your neglect of them. As soon as you began to care about\r\nthem, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule them in one\r\ndepartment and another, who were, perhaps, the deputies of deputies\r\nto some members of this house, sent to spy out their liberties, to\r\nmisrepresent their actions, and to prey upon them; men whose behaviour\r\non many occasions has caused the blood of these sons of liberty to\r\nrecoil within them.... They protected by your arms! They have nobly\r\ntaken up arms in your defense; have exerted a valor amidst their\r\nconstant and laborious industry, for the defense of a country whose\r\nfrontier was drenched in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its\r\nlittle savings to your emolument.\r\n\r\nA very warm speech, and a capital hit, too, thought the honorable\r\nmembers of the House, as they settled comfortably back again to endure\r\nthe routine of a dull day. Towards midnight, after seven hours of\r\nlanguid debate, an adjournment was carried, as everyone foresaw it would\r\nbe, by a great majority--205 to 49 in support of the ministry. On the\r\n13th of February the Stamp Act bill was introduced and read for the\r\nfirst time, without debate. It passed the House on the 27th; on the\r\n8th of March it was approved by the Lords without protest, amendment,\r\ndebate, or division; and two weeks later, the King being then\r\ntemporarily out of his mind, the bill received the royal assent by\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nAt a later day, when the fatal effects of the Act were but too apparent,\r\nit was made a charge against the ministers that they had persisted in\r\npassing the measure in the face of strong opposition. But it was not so.\r\n\"As to the fact of a strenuous opposition to the Stamp Act,\" said Burke,\r\nin his famous speech on American taxation, \"I sat as a stranger in your\r\ngallery when it was under consideration. Far from anything inflammatory,\r\nI never heard a more languid debate in this house.... In fact, the\r\naffair passed with so very, very little noise, that in town they\r\nscarcely knew the nature of what you were doing.\" So far as men\r\nconcerned themselves with the doings of Parliament, the colonial\r\nmeasures of Grenville were greatly applauded; and that not alone by\r\nmen who were ignorant of America. Thomas Pownall, once Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, well acquainted with the colonies and no bad friend\r\nof their liberties, published in April, 1764, a pamphlet on the\r\nAdministration of the Colonies which he dedicated to George Grenville,\r\n\"the great minister,\" who he desired might live to see the \"power,\r\nprosperity, and honor that must be given to his country, by so great\r\nand important an event as the interweaving the administration of the\r\ncolonies into the British administration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III THE RIGHTS OF A NATION\r\n\r\nBritish subjects, by removing to America, cultivating a wilderness,\r\nextending the domain, and increasing the wealth, commerce, and power\r\nof the mother country, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes, ought\r\nnot, and in fact do not thereby lose their native rights.--Benjamin\r\nFranklin.\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of Grenville that this \"interweaving,\" as Pownall\r\ndescribed it, should have been undertaken at a most inopportune time,\r\nwhen the very conditions which made Englishmen conscious of the burden\r\nof empire were giving to Americans a new and highly stimulating sense\r\nof power and independence. The marvelous growth of the colonies in\r\npopulation and wealth, much commented upon by all observers and asserted\r\nby ministers as one principal reason why Americans should pay taxes,\r\nwas indeed well worth some consideration. A million and a half of people\r\nspread over the Atlantic seaboard might be thought no great number; but\r\nit was a new thing in the world, well worth noting--which had in fact\r\nbeen carefully noted by Benjamin Franklin in a pamphlet on The Increase\r\nof Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.--that within three-quarters of\r\na century the population of the continental colonies had doubled every\r\ntwenty-five years, whereas the population of Old England during a\r\nhundred years past had not doubled once and now stood at only some six\r\nand a half millions. If this should go on--and, considering the immense\r\nstretches of free land beyond the mountains, no one could suppose that\r\nthe present rate of increase would soon fall off--it was not unlikely\r\nthat in another century the center of empire, following the course of\r\nthe sun, would come to rest in the New World. With these facts in mind,\r\none might indeed say that a people with so much vitality and expansive\r\npower was abundantly able to pay taxes; but perhaps it was also a fair\r\ninference, if any one was disposed to press the matter, that, unless it\r\nwas so minded, such a people was already, or assuredly soon would be,\r\nequally able not to pay them.\r\n\r\nPeople in new countries, being called provincial, being often told in\r\neffect that having made their bed they may lie in it, easily maintain\r\ntheir self-respect if they are able to say that the bed is indeed a very\r\ncomfortable one. If, therefore, Americans had been given to boasting,\r\ntheir growing wealth was not, any more than their increasing numbers, a\r\nthing to be passed over in silence. In every colony the \"starving time,\"\r\neven if it had ever existed, was now no more than an ancient tradition.\r\n\"Every man of industry has it in his power to live well,\" according to\r\nWilliam Smith of New York, \"and many are the instances of persons who\r\ncame here distressed in their poverty who now enjoy easy and plentiful\r\nfortunes.\" If Americans were not always aware that they were rich men\r\nindividually, they were at all events well instructed, by old-world\r\nvisitors who came to observe them with a certain air of condescension,\r\nthat collectively at least their material prosperity was a thing to be\r\nenvied even by more advanced and more civilized peoples. Therefore any\r\nman called upon to pay a penny tax and finding his pocket bare might\r\ntake a decent pride in the fact, which none need doubt since foreigners\r\nlike Peter Kalm found it so, that \"the English colonies in this part of\r\nthe world have increased so much in ... their riches, that they almost\r\nvie with old England.\"\r\n\r\nThat the colonies might possibly \"vie with old England,\" was a notion\r\nwhich good Americans could contemplate with much equanimity; and even if\r\nthe Swedish traveler, according to a habit of travelers, had stretched\r\nthe facts a point or two, it was still abundantly clear that the\r\ncontinental colonies were thought to be, even by Englishmen themselves,\r\nof far greater importance to the mother country than they had formerly\r\nbeen. Very old men could remember the time when English statesmen and\r\neconomists, viewing colonies as providentially designed to promote the\r\nincrease of trade, had regarded the northern colonies as little better\r\nthan heavy incumbrances on the Empire, and their commerce scarcely worth\r\nthe cost of protection. It was no longer so; it could no longer be said\r\nthat two-thirds of colonial commerce was with the tobacco and sugar\r\nplantations, or that Jamaica took off more English exports than the\r\nmiddle and northern colonies combined; but it could be said, and was now\r\nbeing loudly proclaimed--when it was a point of debate whether to keep\r\nCanada or Guadeloupe--that the northern colonies had already outstripped\r\nthe islands as consumers of English commodities.\r\n\r\nOf this fact Americans themselves were well aware. The question whether\r\nit was for the interest of England to keep Canada or Guadeloupe, which\r\nwas much discussed in 1760, called forth the notable pamphlet from\r\nFranklin, entitled The Interest of Great Britain Considered, in which\r\nhe arranged in convenient form for the benefit of Englishmen certain\r\nstatistics of trade. From these statistics it appeared that, whereas\r\nin 1748 English exports to the northern colonies and to the West Indies\r\nstood at some £830,000 and £730,000 respectively, ten years later the\r\nexports to the West Indies were still no more than £877,571 while those\r\nto the northern colonies had advanced to nearly two millions. Nor was\r\nit likely that this rate of increase would fall off in the future. \"The\r\ntrade to our northern colonies,\" said Franklin, \"is not only greater but\r\nyearly increasing with the increase of the people.... The occasion for\r\nEnglish goods in North America, and the inclination to have and use\r\nthem, is and must be for ages to come, much greater than the ability\r\nof the people to buy them.\" For English merchants the prospect was\r\ntherefore an inviting one; and if Canada rather than Guadeloupe was kept\r\nat the close of the war, it was because statesmen and economists were\r\ncoming to estimate the value of colonies in terms of what they could\r\nbuy, and not merely, as of old, in terms of what they could sell. From\r\nthis point of view, the superiority of the continental over the\r\ninsular colonies was not to be doubted. Americans might well find great\r\nsatisfaction in this disposition of the mother country to regard her\r\ncontinental colonies so highly and to think their trade of so much\r\nmoment to her; all of which, nevertheless, doubtless inclined them\r\nsometimes to speculate on the delicate question whether, in case they\r\nwere so important to the mother country, they were not perhaps more\r\nimportant to her than she was to them.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of rapidly increasing material power, which was\r\ngreatly strengthened by the last French war, did nothing to dull the\r\nsense of rights, but it was, on the contrary, a marked stimulus to\r\nthe mind in formulating a plausible, if theoretical, justification of\r\ndesired aims. Doubtless no American would say that being able to pay\r\ntaxes was a good reason for not paying them, or that obligations\r\nmight rightly be ignored as soon as one was in a position to do so\r\nsuccessfully; but that he should not \"lose his native rights\" any\r\nAmerican could more readily understand when he recalled that his\r\nancestors had without assistance from the mother country transformed a\r\nwilderness into populous and thriving communities whose trade was now\r\nbecoming indispensable to Britain. Therefore, in the summer of 1764,\r\nbefore the doctrine of colonial rights had been very clearly stated\r\nor much refined, every American knew that the Sugar Act and also the\r\nproposed Stamp Act were grievously burdensome, and that in some way or\r\nother and for reasons which he might not be able to give with precision,\r\nthey involved an infringement of essential English liberties. Most men\r\nin the colonies, at this early date, would doubtless have agreed with\r\nthe views expressed in a letter written to a friend in England by Thomas\r\nHutchinson of Boston, who was later so well hated by his compatriots for\r\nnot having changed his views with the progress of events.\r\n\r\nThe colonists [said Hutchinson] claim a power of making laws, and\r\na privilege of exemption from taxes, unless voted by their own\r\nrepresentatives.... Nor are the privileges of the people less affected\r\nby duties laid for the sake of the money arising from them than by an\r\ninternal tax. Not one tenth part of the people of Great Britain have a\r\nvoice in the elections to Parliament; and, therefore, the colonies can\r\nhave no claim to it; but every man of property in England may have his\r\nvoice, if he will. Besides, acts of Parliament do not generally affect\r\nindividuals, and every interest is represented. But the colonies have\r\nan interest distinct from the interest of the nation; and shall the\r\nParliament be at once party and judge? ...\r\n\r\nThe nation treats her colonies as a father who should sell the services\r\nof his sons to reimburse him what they had cost him, but without the\r\nsame reason; for none of the colonies, except Georgia and Halifax,\r\noccasioned any charge to the Crown or kingdom in the settlement of\r\nthem. The people of New England fled for the sake of civil and religious\r\nliberty; multitudes flocked to America with this dependence, that their\r\nliberties should be safe. They and their posterity have enjoyed them to\r\ntheir content, and therefore have endured with greater cheerfulness all\r\nthe hardships of settling new countries. No ill use has been made\r\nof these privileges; but the domain and wealth of Great Britain have\r\nreceived amazing addition. Surely the services we have rendered the\r\nnation have not subjected us to any forfeitures.\r\n\r\nI know it is said the colonies are a charge to the nation, and they\r\nshould contribute to their own defense and protection. But during the\r\nlast war they annually contributed so largely that the Parliament was\r\nconvinced the burden would be insupportable; and from year to year made\r\nthem compensation; in several of the colonies for several years together\r\nmore men were raised, in proportion, than by the nation. In the trading\r\ntowns, one fourth part of the profit of trade, besides imposts and\r\nexcise, was annually paid to the support of the war and public charges;\r\nin the country towns, a farm which would hardly rent for twenty pounds\r\na year, paid ten pounds in taxes. If the inhabitants of Britain had paid\r\nin the same proportion, there would have been no great increase in the\r\nnational debt.\r\n\r\nNor is there occasion for any national expense in America. For one\r\nhundred years together the New England colonies received no aid in their\r\nwars with the Indians, assisted by the French. Those governments now\r\nmolested are as able to defend their respective frontiers; and had\r\nrather do the whole of it by a tax of their own raising, than pay their\r\nproportion in any other way. Moreover, it must be prejudicial to the\r\nnational interest to impose parliamentary taxes. The advantages promised\r\nby an increase of the revenue are all fallacious and delusive. You will\r\nlose more than you will gain. Britain already reaps the profit of all\r\ntheir trade, and of the increase of their substance. By cherishing their\r\npresent turn of mind, you will serve your interest more than by your\r\npresent schemes.\r\n\r\nThomas Hutchinson, or any other man, might write a private letter\r\nwithout committing his country, or, with due caution to his\r\ncorrespondent, even himself; but for effective public and official\r\nprotest the colonial assemblies were the proper channels, and very\r\nexpert they were in the business, after having for half a century and\r\nmore devoted themselves with singleness of purpose to the guardianship\r\nof colonial liberties. Until now, liberties had been chiefly threatened\r\nby the insidious designs of colonial governors, who were for the most\r\npart appointed by the Crown and very likely therefore to be infected\r\nwith the spirit of prerogative than which nothing could be more\r\ndangerous, as everyone must know who recalled the great events of the\r\nlast century. With those great events, the eminent men who directed the\r\ncolonial assemblies--heads or scions or protégés of the best families in\r\nAmerica, men of wealth and not without reading--were entirely familiar;\r\nthey knew as well as any man that the liberties of Englishmen had been\r\nvindicated against royal prerogative only by depriving one king of his\r\nhead and another of his crown; and they needed no instruction in the\r\nsignificance of the \"glorious revolution,\" the high justification of\r\nwhich was to be found in the political gospel of John Locke, whose\r\nbook they had commonly bought and conveniently placed on their library\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nMore often than not, it is true, colonial governors were but ordinary\r\nEnglishmen with neither the instinct nor the capacity for tyranny,\r\nintent mainly upon getting their salaries paid and laying by a\r\ncompetence against the day when they might return to England. But if\r\nthey were not kings, at least they had certain royal characteristics;\r\nand a certain flavor of despotism, clinging as it were to their official\r\nrobes and reviving in sensitive provincial minds the memory of bygone\r\nparliamentary battles, was an ever-present stimulus to the eternal\r\nvigilance which was well known to be the price of liberty.\r\n\r\nAnd so, throughout the eighteenth century, little colonial aristocracies\r\nplayed their part, in imagination clothing their governors in the\r\ndecaying vesture of old-world tyrants and themselves assuming the\r\nhomespun garb, half Roman and half Puritan, of a virtuous republicanism.\r\nSmall matters were thus stamped with great character. To debate a point\r\nof procedure in the Boston or Williamsburg assembly was not, to be sure,\r\nas high a privilege as to obstruct legislation in Westminster; but men\r\nof the best American families, fashioning their minds as well as their\r\nhouses on good English models, thought of themselves, in withholding a\r\ngovernor's salary or limiting his executive power, as but reënacting\r\non a lesser stage the great parliamentary struggles of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It was the illusion of sharing in great events rather than any\r\nlow mercenary motive that made Americans guard with jealous care their\r\nlegislative independence; a certain hypersensitiveness in matters of\r\ntaxation they knew to be the virtue of men standing for liberties which\r\nEnglishmen had once won and might lose before they were aware.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, therefore, the colonial assemblies protested\r\nagainst the measures of Grenville. The General Court of Massachusetts\r\ninstructed its agent to say that the Sugar Act would ruin the New\r\nEngland fisheries upon which the industrial prosperity of the northern\r\ncolonies depended. What they would lose was set down with some care, in\r\nprecise figures: the fishing trade, \"estimated at £164,000 per annum;\r\nthe vessels employed in it, which would be nearly useless, at £100,000;\r\nthe provisions used in it, the casks for packing fish, and other\r\narticles, at £22,700 and upwards: to all which there was to be added the\r\nloss of the advantage of sending lumber, horses, provisions, and other\r\ncommodities to the foreign plantations as cargoes, the vessels employed\r\nto carry the fish to Spain and Portugal, the dismissing of 5,000 seamen\r\nfrom their employment,\" besides many other losses, all arising from\r\nthe very simple fact that the British islands to which the trade of\r\nthe colonies was virtually confined by the Sugar Act could furnish no\r\nsufficient market for the products of New England, to say nothing of the\r\nmiddle colonies, nor a tithe of the molasses and other commodities now\r\nimported from the foreign islands in exchange.\r\n\r\nOf the things taken in exchange, silver, in coin and bullion, was not\r\nthe least important, since it was essential for the \"remittances to\r\nEngland for goods imported into the provinces,\" remittances which during\r\nthe last eighteen months, it was said, \"had been made in specie to\r\nthe amount of £150,000 besides £90,000 in Treasurer's bills for the\r\nreimbursement money.\" Any man must thus see, since even Governor Bernard\r\nwas convinced of it, that the new duties would drain the colony of all\r\nits hard money, and so, as the Governor said, \"There will be an end of\r\nthe specie currency in Massachusetts.\" And with her trade half gone and\r\nher hard money entirely so, the old Bay colony would have to manufacture\r\nfor herself those very commodities which English merchants were so\r\ndesirous of selling in America.\r\n\r\nThe Sugar Act was thus made out to be, even from the point of view of\r\nEnglish merchants, an economic blunder; but in the eyes of vigilant\r\nBostonians it was something more, and much worse than an economic\r\nblunder. Vigilant Bostonians assembled in Town Meeting in May, 1764, in\r\norder to instruct their representatives how they ought to act in these\r\nserious times; and knowing that they ought to protest but perhaps not\r\nknowing precisely on what grounds, they committed the drafting of their\r\ninstructions to Samuel Adams, a middle-aged man who had given much time\r\nto the consideration of political questions, and above all to this very\r\nquestion of taxation, upon which he had wonderfully clarified his ideas\r\nby much meditation and the writing of effective political pieces for the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThrough the eyes of Samuel Adams, therefore, vigilant Bostonians saw\r\nclearly that the Sugar Act, to say nothing of the Stamp Act, was not\r\nonly an economic blunder but a menace to political liberty as well. \"If\r\nour trade may be taxed,\" so the instructions ran, \"why not our lands?\r\nWhy not the produce of our lands, and everything we possess or make use\r\nof? This we apprehend annihilates our charter right to govern and tax\r\nourselves. It strikes at our British privileges which, as we have never\r\nforfeited them, we hold in common with our fellow-subjects who are\r\nnatives of Great Britain. If taxes are laid upon us in any shape without\r\nour having a legal representative where they are laid, are we not\r\nreduced from the character of free subjects to the miserable state of\r\ntributary slaves?\" Very formidable questions, couched in high-sounding\r\nphrases, and representing well enough in form and in substance the state\r\nof mind of colonial assemblies in the summer of 1764 in respect to the\r\nSugar Act and the proposed Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nYet these resounding phrases doubtless meant something less to Americans\r\nof 1764 than one is apt to suppose. The rights of freemen had so often,\r\nin the proceedings of colonial assemblies as well as in the newspaper\r\ncommunications of many a Brutus and Cato, been made to depend upon\r\nwithholding a governor's salary or defining precisely how he should\r\nexpend a hundred pounds or so, that moderate terms could hardly be\r\ntrusted to cope with the serious business of parliamentary taxation.\r\n\"Reduced from the character of free subjects to the miserable state\r\nof tributary slaves\" was in fact hardly more than a conventional and\r\ndignified way of expressing a firm but entirely respectful protest.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, therefore, that while everyone protested in such spirited\r\nterms as might occur to him, few men in these early days supposed the\r\nnew laws would not take effect, and fewer still counseled the right\r\nor believed in the practicability of forcible resistance. \"We yield\r\nobedience to the act granting duties,\" declared the Massachusetts\r\nAssembly. \"Let Parliament lay what duties they please on us,\" said James\r\nOtis; \"it is our duty to submit and patiently bear them till they be\r\npleased to relieve us.\" Franklin assured his friends that the passage\r\nof the Stamp Act could not have been prevented any more easily than the\r\nsun's setting, recommended that they endure the one mischance with the\r\nsame equanimity with which they faced the other necessity, and even saw\r\ncertain advantages in the way of self-discipline which might come of\r\nit through the practice of a greater frugality. Not yet perceiving the\r\ndishonor attaching to the function of distributing stamps, he did\r\nhis two friends, Jared Ingersoll of Connecticut and John Hughes of\r\nPennsylvania, the service of procuring for them the appointment to the\r\nnew office; and Richard Henry Lee, as good a patriot as any man and\r\ntherefore of necessity at some pains later to explain his motives in the\r\nmatter, applied for the position in Virginia.\r\n\r\nRichard Henry Lee was no friend of tyrants, but an American freeman,\r\nless distinguished as yet than his name, which was a famous one and not\r\nwithout offense to be omitted from any list of the Old Dominion's \"best\r\nfamilies.\" The best families of the Old Dominion, tide-water tobacco\r\nplanters of considerable estates, admirers and imitators of the minor\r\naristocracy of England, took it as a matter of course that the political\r\nfortunes of the province were committed to their care and for many\r\ngenerations had successfully maintained the public interest against the\r\ndouble danger of executive tyranny and popular licentiousness. It\r\nis therefore not surprising that the many obscure freeholders, minor\r\nplanters, and lesser men who filled the House of Burgesses had followed\r\nthe able leadership of that little coterie of interrelated families\r\ncomprising the Virginia aristocracy. John Robinson, Speaker of the House\r\nand Treasurer of the colony, of good repute still in the spring of 1765,\r\nwas doubtless the head and front of this aristocracy, the inner circle\r\nof which would also include Peyton Randolph, then King's Attorney, and\r\nEdmund Pendleton, well known for his cool persuasiveness in debate, the\r\nlearned constitutional lawyer, Richard Bland, the sturdy and honest but\r\nungraceful Robert Carter Nicholas, and George Wythe, noblest Roman of\r\nthem all, steeped in classical lore, with the thin, sharp face of a\r\nCæsar and for virtuous integrity a very Cato. Conscious of their English\r\nheritage, they were at once proud of their loyalty to Britain\r\nand jealous of their well-won provincial liberties. As became\r\nBritish-American freemen, they had already drawn a proper Memorial\r\nagainst the Sugar Act and were now, as they leisurely gathered at\r\nWilliamsburg in the early weeks of May, 1765, unwilling to protest again\r\nat present, for they had not as yet received any reply to their former\r\ndignified and respectful petition.\r\n\r\nTo this assembly of the burgesses in 1765, there came from the\r\nback-country beyond the first falls of the Virginia rivers, the frontier\r\nof that day, many deputies who must have presented, in dress and manners\r\nas well as in ideas, a sharp contrast to the eminent leaders of the\r\naristocracy. Among them was Thomas Marshall, father of a famous son, and\r\nPatrick Henry, a young man of twenty-nine years, a heaven-born orator\r\nand destined to be the leader and interpreter of the silent \"simple\r\nfolk\" of the Old Dominion. In Hanover County, in which this tribune of\r\nthe people was born and reared and which he now represented, there were,\r\nas in all the back-country counties, few great estates and few slaves,\r\nno notable country-seats with pretension to architectural excellence,\r\nno modishly dressed aristocracy with leisure for reading and the\r\ncultivation of manners becoming a gentleman. Beyond the tide-water, men\r\nfor the most part earned their bread by the sweat of their brows, lived\r\nthe life and esteemed the virtues of a primitive society, and braced\r\ntheir minds with the tonic of Calvin's theology--a tonic somewhat\r\ntempered in these late enlightened days by a more humane philosophy and\r\nthe friendly emotionalism of simple folk living close to nature.\r\n\r\nFree burgesses from the back-country, set apart in dress and manners\r\nfrom the great planters, less learned and less practiced in oratory and\r\nthe subtle art of condescension and patronage than the cultivated men\r\nof the inner circle, were nevertheless staunch defenders of liberty and\r\nAmerican rights and were perhaps beginning to question, in these days of\r\npopular discussion, whether liberty could very well flourish among men\r\nwhose wealth was derived from the labor of negro slaves, or be well\r\nguarded under all circumstances by those who, regarding themselves as\r\nsuperior to the general run of men, might be in danger of mistaking\r\ntheir particular interests for the common welfare. And indeed it\r\nnow seemed that these great men who sent their sons to London to be\r\neducated, who every year shipped their tobacco to England and bought\r\ntheir clothes of English merchants with whom their credit was always\r\ngood, were grown something too timid, on account of their loyalty to\r\nBritain, in the great question of asserting the rights of America.\r\n\r\nJean Jacques Rousseau would have well understood Patrick Henry, one of\r\nthose passionate temperaments whose reason functions not in the service\r\nof knowledge but of good instincts and fine emotions; a nature to be\r\neasily possessed of an exalted enthusiasm for popular rights and for\r\ncelebrating the virtues of the industrious poor. This enthusiasm in the\r\ncase of Patrick Henry was intensified by his own eloquence, which had\r\nbeen so effectively exhibited in the famous Parson's Cause, and in\r\nopposition to the shady scheme which the old leaders in the House of\r\nBurgesses had contrived to protect John Robinson, the Treasurer, from\r\nbeing exposed to a charge of embezzlement. Such courageous exploits,\r\nwidely noised abroad, had won for the young man great applause and had\r\ngot him a kind of party of devoted followers in the back-country and\r\namong the yeomanry and young men throughout the province, so that to\r\ntake the lead and to stand boldly forth as the champion of liberty\r\nand the submerged rights of mankind seemed to Patrick Henry a kind of\r\nmission laid upon him, in virtue of his heavenly gift of speech, by that\r\nProvidence which shapes the destinies of men.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Mr. Henry was not learned in the law; but he had read\r\nin Coke upon Littleton that an Act of Parliament against Magna Carta,\r\nor common right, or reason, is void--which was clearly the case of the\r\nStamp Act. On the flyleaf of an old copy of that book this unlearned\r\nlawyer accordingly wrote out some resolutions of protest which he showed\r\nto his friends, George Johnston and John Fleming, for their approval.\r\nTheir approval once obtained, Mr. Johnston moved, with Mr. Henry as\r\nsecond, that the House of Burgesses should go into committee of the\r\nwhole, \"to consider the steps necessary to be taken in consequence of\r\nthe resolutions ... charging certain Stamp Duties in the colonies\";\r\nwhich was accordingly done on the 29th of May, upon which day Mr. Henry\r\npresented his resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe 29th of May was late in that session of the Virginia House of\r\nBurgesses; and most likely the resolutions would have been rejected if\r\nsome two-thirds of the members, who knew nothing of Mr. Henry's plans\r\nand supposed the business of the Assembly finished, had not already gone\r\nhome. Among those who had thus departed, it is not likely that there\r\nwere many of Patrick Henry's followers. Yet even so there was much\r\nopposition. The resolutions were apparently refashioned in committee of\r\nthe whole, for a preamble was omitted outright and four \"Resolves\"\r\nwere made over into five which were presented to the House on the day\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Jefferson, at that time a law student and naturally much\r\ninterested in the business of lawmaking, heard the whole of this day's\r\nfamous debate from the door of communication between the House and the\r\nlobby. The five resolutions, he afterwards remembered, were \"opposed by\r\nRandolph, Bland, Pendleton, Nicholas, Wythe, and all the old members,\r\nwhose influence in the House had, till then, been unbroken; ... not from\r\nany question of our rights, but on the ground that the same sentiments\r\nhad been, at their preceding session, expressed in a more conciliatory\r\nform, to which the answers were not yet received. But torrents of\r\nsublime eloquence from Mr. Henry, backed by the solid reasoning of\r\nJohnston, prevailed.\" It was in connection with the fifth resolution,\r\nupon which the debate was \"most bloody,\" that Patrick Henry is said to\r\nhave declared that \"Tarquin and Cæsar had each his Brutus, Charles\r\nthe First his Cromwell, and George the Third--\"; upon which cries of\r\n\"Treason\" were heard from every part of the House. Treason or not, the\r\nresolution was carried, although by one vote only; and the young law\r\nstudent standing at the door of the House heard Peyton Randolph say,\r\nas he came hastily out into the lobby: \"By God, I would have given 500\r\nguineas for a single vote.\" And no doubt he would, at that moment, being\r\nthen much heated.\r\n\r\nNext day Mr. Randolph was probably much cooler; and so apparently were\r\nsome others who, in the enthusiasm of debate and under the compelling\r\neye of Patrick Henry, had voted for the last defiant resolution.\r\nThinking the matter settled, Patrick Henry had already gone home \"to\r\nrecommend himself to his constituents,\" as his enemies thought, \"by\r\nspreading treason.\"\r\n\r\nBut the matter was not yet settled. Early on that morning of the 31st,\r\nbefore the House assembled, the young law student who was so curious\r\nabout the business of lawmaking saw Colonel Peter Randolph, of his\r\nMajesty's Council, standing at the Clerk's table, \"thumbing over the\r\nvolumes of journals to find a precedent for expunging a vote of the\r\nHouse.\" Whether the precedent was found the young law student did not\r\nafterwards recollect; but it is known that on motion of Peyton Randolph\r\nthe fifth resolution was that day erased from the record. Mr. Henry was\r\nnot then present. He had been seen, on the afternoon before, \"passing\r\nalong the street, on his way to his home in Louisa, clad in a pair of\r\nleather breeches, his saddle-bags on his arm, leading a lean horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe four resolutions thus adopted as the deliberate and formal protest\r\nof the Old Dominion were as mild and harmless as could well be. They\r\nasserted no more than that the first adventurers and settlers of\r\nVirginia brought with them and transmitted to their posterity all the\r\nprivileges at any time enjoyed by the people of Great Britain; that\r\nby two royal charters they had been formally declared to be as surely\r\npossessed of these privileges as if they had been born and were then\r\nabiding within the realm; that the taxation of the people by themselves\r\nor by persons chosen by themselves to represent them \"is the only\r\nsecurity against a burthensome taxation, and the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristick of British freedom, without which the ancient\r\nconstitution cannot exist\"; and that the loyal colony of Virginia had\r\nin fact without interruption enjoyed this inestimable right, which had\r\nnever been forfeited or surrendered nor ever hitherto denied by the\r\nkings or the people of Britain. No treason here, expressed or implied;\r\nnor any occasion for 500 guineas passing from one hand to another to\r\nprove that the province of Virginia was still the ancient and loyal Old\r\nDominion.\r\n\r\nBut Fate, or Providence, or whatever it is that presides at the\r\ndestinies of nations, has a way of setting aside with ironical smile the\r\nmost deliberate actions of men. And so, on this occasion, it turned out\r\nthat the hard-won victory of Messrs. Randolph, Bland, Pendleton, and\r\nWythe was of no avail. William Gordon tells us, without mentioning the\r\nsource of his information, that \"a manuscript of the unrevised resolves\r\nsoon reached Philadelphia, having been sent off immediately upon their\r\npassing, that the earliest information of what had been done might\r\nbe obtained by the Sons of Liberty.\" From Philadelphia a copy was\r\nforwarded, on June 17, to New York, in which loyal city the resolutions\r\nwere thought \"so treasonable that their possessors declined printing\r\nthem\"; but an Irish gentleman from Connecticut, who was then in town,\r\ninquired after them and was with great precaution permitted to take a\r\ncopy, which he straightway carried to New England. All this may be true\r\nor not; but certain it is that six resolutions purporting to come from\r\nVirginia were printed in the Newport Mercury on June 24, 1765, and\r\nafterwards, on July 1, in many Boston papers.\r\n\r\nThe document thus printed did not indeed include the famous fifth\r\nresolution upon which the debate in the House of Burgesses was \"most\r\nbloody\" and which had been there adopted by a single vote and afterwards\r\nerased from the record; but it included two others much stronger than\r\nthat eminently treasonable one: Resolved, That his Majesty's Liege\r\npeople, the inhabitants of this colony, are not bound to yield obedience\r\nto any law or ordinance whatever, designed to impose any taxation\r\nwhatsoever upon them, other than the laws and ordinances of the General\r\nAssembly aforesaid. Resolved, That any person who shall, by speaking or\r\nwriting, assert or maintain that any person or persons, other than the\r\nGeneral Assembly of this colony, have any right or power to impose any\r\ntaxation on the people here, shall be deemed an enemy to his Majesty's\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions, which Governor Fauquier had not seen, and which were\r\nperhaps never debated in the House of Burgesses, were now circulated far\r\nand wide as part of the mature decision of the Virginia Assembly. On the\r\n14th of September, Messrs. Randolph, Wythe, and Nicholas were appointed\r\na committee to apprise the Assembly's agent \"of a spurious copy of the\r\nresolves of the last Assembly ... being dispersed and printed in the\r\nNews Papers and to send him a true copy of the votes on that occasion.\"\r\nIn those days of slow and difficult communication, the truth, three\r\nmonths late, could not easily overtake the falsehood or ever effectively\r\nreplace it.\r\n\r\nIn later years, when it was thought an honor to have begun the\r\nRevolution, many men denied the decisive effect of the Virginia\r\nResolutions in convincing the colonists that the Stamp Act might be\r\nsuccessfully resisted. But contemporaries were agreed in according them\r\nthat glory or that infamy. \"Two or three months ago,\" said Governor\r\nBernard, \"I thought that this people would submit to the Stamp Act.\r\nMurmurs were indeed continually heard, but they seemed to be such\r\nas would die away. The publishing the Virginia Resolutions proved an\r\nalarm-bell to the disaffected.\" We read the resolutions, said Jonathan\r\nSewell, \"with wonder. They savored of independence; they flattered the\r\nhuman passions; the reasoning was specious; we wished it conclusive.\r\nThe transition to believing it so was easy, and we, almost all America,\r\nfollowed their example in resolving that the Parliament had no such\r\nright.\" And the good patriot John Adams, who afterwards attributed the\r\nhonor to James Otis, said in 1776 that the \"author of the first Virginia\r\nResolutions against the Stamp Act ... will have the glory with posterity\r\nof beginning ... this great Revolution.\" ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Upon the death of George II., 1760, the collectors of the customs at\r\nBoston applied for new writs of assistance. The grant was opposed by the\r\nmerchants, and the question was argued before the Superior Court. It was\r\non this occasion that James Otis made a speech in favor of the rights\r\nof the colonists as men and Englishmen. All that is known of it is\r\ncontained in some rough notes taken at the time by John Adams (Works of\r\nJohn Adams, ii., 125). An elaboration of these notes was printed in the\r\nMassachusetts Spy, April 29, 1773, and with corrections by Adams fifty\r\nyears after the event in William Tudor's Life of James Otis, chs. 5-7.\r\nThis is the speech to which Adams, at a later date, attributed the\r\nbeginning of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nJames Otis in 1765 declared the Virginia Resolutions to be treasonable.\r\nIt was precisely their treasonable flavor that electrified the country,\r\nwhile the fact that they came from the Old Dominion made men think that\r\na union of the colonies, so essential to successful resistance, might be\r\nachieved in spite of all. The Old Dominion, counted the most English of\r\nthe colonies in respect to her institutions and her sympathies, had a\r\ncharacter for loyalty that, in any matter of opposition to Britain,\r\ngave double weight to her action. Easy-going tobacco-planters, Church of\r\nEngland men all, were well known not to be great admirers of the precise\r\nPuritans of New England, whose moral fervor and conscious rectitude\r\nseemed to them a species of fanaticism savoring more of canting\r\nhypocrisy than of that natural virtue affected by men of parts. Franklin\r\nmay well have had Virginia and Massachusetts in mind when he said, but\r\na few years earlier, no one need fear that the colonies \"will unite\r\nagainst their own nation ... which 'tis well known they all love much\r\nmore than they love one another.\" Nor could anyone have supposed that\r\nthe \"Ancient and Loyal Colony of Virginia\" would out-Boston Boston in\r\nasserting the rights of America. Yet this was what had come to pass, the\r\nevidence of which was the printed resolutions now circulating far and\r\nwide and being read in this month of July when it was being noised about\r\nthat a Congress was proposed for the coming October. The proposal had\r\nin fact come from Massachusetts Bay in the form of a circular letter\r\ninviting all the colonies to send delegates to New York for the purpose\r\nof preparing a loyal and humble \"representation of their condition,\" and\r\nof imploring relief from the King and Parliament of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nNo very encouraging response was immediately forthcoming. The Assembly\r\nof New Jersey unanimously declined to send any delegates, although it\r\ndeclared itself \"not without a just sensibility respecting the late acts\r\nof Parliament,\" and wished \"such other colonies as think proper to be\r\nactive every success they can loyally and reasonably desire.\" For two\r\nmonths there was no indication that any colony would think it \"proper\r\nto be active\"; but during August and September the assemblies of six\r\ncolonies chose deputies to the congress, and when that body finally\r\nassembled in October, less formally designated representatives from\r\nthree other colonies appeared upon the scene. The Assembly of New\r\nHampshire declined to take part. Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina\r\nwere also unrepresented, which was perhaps due to the fact that the\r\ngovernors of those provinces refused to call the assemblies together to\r\nconsider the Massachusetts circular letter.\r\n\r\nOf the 27 members of the Stamp Act Congress, few if any were inclined\r\nto rash or venturesome measures. It is reported that Lord Melbourne,\r\nas Prime Minister of England, once remarked to his Cabinet, \"It doesn't\r\nmatter what we say, but we must all say the same thing.\" What the Stamp\r\nAct Congress said was to be sure of some importance, but that it should\r\nsay something which all could agree to was of even greater importance.\r\n\"There ought to be no New England man, no New Yorker, known on the\r\ncontinent,\" wrote Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina, \"but all of\r\nus Americans.\" New Yorkers and New England men could not indeed be\r\nso easily transformed over night; but the Stamp Act Congress was\r\nsignificant as marking a kind of beginning in that slow and difficult\r\nprocess. After eleven days of debate, in which sharp differences of\r\nopinion were no doubt revealed, a declaration of rights and grievances\r\nwas at last adopted; a declaration which was so cautiously and loyally\r\nphrased that all could subscribe to it, and which was perhaps for that\r\nvery reason not quite satisfactory to anyone.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's subjects in the colonies, the declaration affirmed, are\r\nentitled to those \"inherent rights and liberties\" which are enjoyed by\r\n\"his natural born subjects\" in Great Britain; among which rights is that\r\nmost important one of \"not being taxed without their own consent\"; and\r\nsince the people of the colonies, \"from local circumstances, cannot be\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons,\" it follows that taxes cannot be\r\n\"imposed upon them, but by their respective legislatures.\" The Stamp\r\nAct, being a direct tax, was therefore declared to have a \"manifest\r\ntendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonies.\" Of the\r\nSugar Act, which was not a direct tax, so much could not be said; but\r\nthis act was at least \"burthensome and grievous,\" being subversive of\r\ntrade if not of liberty. No one was likely to be profoundly stirred by\r\nthe declaration of the Stamp Act Congress, in this month of October when\r\nthe spirited Virginia Resolutions were everywhere well known.\r\n\r\n\"The frozen politicians of a more northern government,\" according to the\r\nBoston Gazette, \"say they [the people of Virginia] have spoken treason\";\r\nbut the Boston Gazette, for its part, thought they had \"spoken very\r\nsensibly.\" With much reading of the resolutions and of the commendatory\r\nremarks with which they were everywhere received, the treasonable flavor\r\nof their boldest phrases no doubt grew less pronounced, and high talk\r\ntook on more and more the character of good sense. During the summer\r\nof 1765 the happy phrase of Isaac Barré--\"these sons of liberty\"--was\r\neverywhere repeated, and was put on as a kind of protective coloring by\r\nstrong patriots, who henceforth thought of themselves as Sons of Liberty\r\nand no traitors at all. Rather were they traitors who would in any\r\nway justify an act of tyranny; most of all those so-called Americans,\r\naccepting the office of Stamp Master, who cunningly aspired to make\r\na farthing profit out of the hateful business of enslaving their own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nWho these gentry might be was not certainly known until early August,\r\nwhen Jared Ingersoll, himself as it turned out one of the miscreants,\r\nbrought the commissions over from London, whereupon the names were all\r\nprinted in the papers. It then appeared that the gentleman appointed\r\nto distribute the stamps in Massachusetts was Andrew Oliver, a man very\r\nwell connected in that province and of great influence with the best\r\npeople, not infrequently entrusted with high office and perquisites, and\r\nbut recently elected by the unsuspecting Bostonians to represent them in\r\nthe council of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It seemed inconsistent that a\r\nman so often honored by the people should meanwhile pledge himself to\r\ndestroy their liberties; and so on the morning of the 14th of August,\r\nMr. Oliver's effigy, together with a horned devil's head peeping out of\r\nan old boot, was to be seen hanging from the Liberty Tree at the south\r\nend of Boston, near the distillery of Thomas Chase, brewer and warm\r\nSon of Liberty. During the day people stopped to make merry over the\r\nspectacle; and in the evening, after work hours, a great crowd gathered\r\nto see what would happen. When the effigy was cut down and carried away,\r\nthe crowd very naturally followed along through the streets and through\r\nthe Town House, justifying themselves--many respectable people were\r\nin the crowd--for being there by calling out, \"Liberty and Property\r\nforever; no Stamp.\" And what with tramping and shouting in the warm\r\nAugust evening, the whole crowd became much heated and ever more\r\nenthusiastic, so that, the line of march by some chance lying past\r\nthe new stamp office and Mr. Oliver's house, the people were not to be\r\nrestrained from destroying the former and breaking in the windows of the\r\nlatter, in detestation of the hated Stamp Act and of the principle that\r\nproperty might be taken without consent.\r\n\r\nMr. Oliver hastened to resign his office, which doubtless led many\r\npeople to think the methods taken to induce him to do so were very good\r\nones and such as might well be made further use of. It was in fact not\r\nlong afterwards, about dusk of the evening of the 26th of August, that\r\na mob of men, more deliberately organized than before, ransacked the\r\noffice of William Story, Deputy Registrar of the Court of Admiralty,\r\nand, after burning the obnoxious records kept there, they forcibly\r\nentered the house, and the cellar too, of Benjamin Hallowell,\r\nComptroller of the Customs. \"Then the Monsters,\" says Deacon Tudor,\r\n\"being enflam'd with Rum & Wine which they got in sd. Hallowell's\r\ncellar, proceeded with Shouts to the Dwelling House of the Hon-l. Thos.\r\nHutchinson, Esq., Lieut. Governor, & enter'd in a voyalent manner.\" At\r\nthat moment the Lieutenant-Governor was sitting comfortably at dinner\r\nand had barely time to escape with his family before the massive front\r\ndoor was broken in with axes. As young Mr. Hutchinson went out by the\r\nback way he heard someone say: \"Damn him, he's upstairs, we'll have him\r\nyet.\" They did not indeed accomplish this purpose; but when the morning\r\nbroke the splendid house was seen to be completely gutted, the partition\r\nwalls broken in, the roof partly off, and the priceless possessions of\r\nthe owner ruined past repair: mahogany and walnut furniture finished\r\nin morocco and crimson damask, tapestries and Turkey carpets, rare\r\npaintings, cabinets of fine glass and old china, stores of immaculate\r\nlinen, India paduasoy gowns and red Genoa robes, a choice collection of\r\nbooks richly bound in leather and many manuscript documents, the fruit\r\nof thirty years' labor in collecting--all broken and cut and cast about\r\nto make a rubbish heap and a bonfire. From the mire of the street there\r\nwas afterwards picked up a manuscript history of Massachusetts which is\r\npreserved to this day, the soiled pages of which may still be seen in\r\nthe Boston library. Mr. Hutchinson was no friend of the Stamp Act;\r\nbut he was a rich man, Lieutenant-Governor of the province, and\r\nbrother-in-law of Andrew Oliver.\r\n\r\nGovernment offered the usual rewards--which were never claimed--for\r\nevidence leading to the detection of any persons concerned in the riots.\r\nMen of repute, including the staunchest patriots such as Samuel Adams\r\nand Jonathan Mayhew, expressed their abhorrence of mobs and of all\r\nlicentious proceedings in general; but many were nevertheless disposed\r\nto think, with good Deacon Tudor, that in this particular instance\r\n\"the universal Obhorrance of the Stamp Act was the cause of the Mob's\r\nriseing.\" It would be well to punish the mob, but punishing the mob\r\nwould not cure the evil which was the cause of the mob; for where there\r\nwas oppression the lower sort of people, as was well known, would\r\nbe sure to express opposition in the way commonly practiced by them\r\neverywhere, in London as well as in Boston, by gathering in the streets\r\nin crowds, in which event some deplorable excesses were bound to follow,\r\nhowever much deprecated by men of substance and standing. If ministers\r\nwished the people to be tranquil, let them repeal the Stamp Act; if\r\nthey were determined to persist in it, and should attempt to land and\r\ndistribute the stamps, loyal and law-abiding citizens, however much they\r\nmight regret the fact, could only say that similar disorders were very\r\nlikely to become even more frequent and more serious in the future than\r\nthey had been in the past.\r\n\r\nAs the first of November approached, that being the day set for the\r\nlevying of the tax, attention and discussion came naturally to center\r\non the stamps rather than on the Stamp Act. Crowds of curious people\r\ngathered wherever there seemed a prospect of catching a glimpse of\r\nthe bundles of stamped papers. Upon their arrival the papers had to be\r\nlanded; they could therefore be seen; and the mere sight of them was\r\nlikely to be a sufficient challenge to action. It seemed a simple matter\r\nto resist a law which could be of no effect without the existence\r\nof certain papers, paper being a substance easily disposed of. And\r\neverywhere in fact the stamps were disposed of--disposed of by mobs,\r\nwith the tacit consent and impalpable encouragement of many men who,\r\nhaving a reputable position to maintain, would themselves by no means\r\nendure to be seen in a common crowd; men of good estate whom no one\r\ncould think of as countenancers of violence, but who were, on this\r\noccasion, as Mr. Livingston said, \"not averse to a little rioting\"\r\non condition that it be kept within bounds and well directed to the\r\nattainment of their just rights.\r\n\r\nA little rioting, so easy to be set on foot, was difficult to keep\r\nwithin reasonable bounds, as Mr. Livingston and his friends in New York\r\nsoon discovered, somewhat to their chagrin. In New York, even after the\r\nstamps were surrendered by Lieutenant-Governor Colden and safely lodged\r\nin the Town House, there were many excesses wholly unnecessary to the\r\nattainment of the original object. Mr. Colden's new chariot, certainly\r\nnever designed to carry the stamps, was burned; and on repeated\r\noccasions windows were broken and \"particulars\" threatened that their\r\nhouses would presently be pulled down. Mr. Livingston was himself the\r\nowner of houses, had an immense respect for property rights and for the\r\nlaw that guaranteed them, and therefore wished very much that the lower\r\nsort of people would give over their mobbish practices now that the\r\nstamps had been disposed of. Since the law could not now operate without\r\nstamps, what more was necessary except to wait in good order, patiently\r\ndenying themselves those activities that involved a violation of the\r\nlaw, until the law should be repealed? The Stamp Act Congress had\r\nprotested in a proper and becoming manner; merchants had agreed not to\r\nimport British goods; the Governor had closed the courts. Stopping of\r\nbusiness would doubtless be annoying and might very likely produce\r\nsome distress. But it would be legal and it would be effective: the\r\ngovernment would get no revenue; British merchants no profit; and\r\nAmericans could not be charged with violating a law the failure of\r\nwhich was primarily due to the fact that papers indispensable to its\r\napplication were, for one reason or another, not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMr. Livingston, happily possessed of the conservative temperament, was\r\ndisposed to achieve desired ends with the least possible disturbance of\r\nhis own affairs and those of his country; and most men of independent\r\nmeans, landowners and merchants of considerable estates, moneyed men and\r\nhigh salaried officials whose incomes were not greatly affected by any\r\ntemporary business depression, were likely to be of Mr. Livingston's\r\nopinion, particularly in this matter of the Stamp Act. Sitting\r\ncomfortably at dinner every day and well knowing where they could lay\r\nhands on money to pay current bills, they enjoyed a high sense of\r\nbeing defenders of liberty and at the same time eminently law-abiding\r\ncitizens. They professed a decided preference for nullifying the Stamp\r\nAct without violating it. Sitting at dinner over their wine, they swore\r\nthat they would let ships lie in harbor and rot there if necessary, and\r\nwould let the courts close for a year or two years, rather than employ\r\ntaxed papers to collect their just debts; with a round oath they bound\r\nthemselves to it, sealing the pledge, very likely, by sipping another\r\nglass of Madeira. In the defense of just rights, Mr. Livingston and his\r\nconservative friends were willing to sacrifice much: they foresaw some\r\nmonths of business stagnation, which they nevertheless contemplated with\r\nequanimity, being prepared to tide over the dull time by living in a\r\ndiminished manner, if necessary even dispensing with customary bottles\r\nof Madeira at dinner.\r\n\r\nMen of radical temperament, having generally less regard for the status\r\nquo, are quick to see ulterior motives back of conservative timidity and\r\nsolemn profession of respect for law and order. It was so in the case of\r\nthe Stamp Act. Small shopkeepers who were soon sold out and had no great\r\nstock of \"old moth-eaten goods\" to offer at enhanced prices, rising\r\nyoung lawyers whose fees ceased with the closing of the courts, artisans\r\nand laborers who bought their dinners (no Madeira included) with their\r\ndaily wage--these, and indeed all the lower sort of people, contemplated\r\nthe stopping of business with much alarm. Mr. John Adams, a young lawyer\r\nof Braintree and Boston, was greatly interested in the question of the\r\ncourts of justice. Were the courts to be closed on the ground that no\r\nlegal business could be done without stamped papers? Or were they to go\r\non trying cases, enforcing the collection of debts, and probating wills\r\nprecisely as if no Stamp Act had ever been heard of? The Boston superior\r\ncourt was being adjourned continuously, for a fortnight at a time,\r\nthrough the influence of Messrs. Hutchinson and Oliver, to the great\r\nand steadily rising wrath of young Mr. Adams. The courts must soon be\r\nopened, he said to himself; their inactivity \"will make a large chasm\r\nin my affairs, if it should not reduce me to distress.\" Young Mr. Adams,\r\nwho had, no less than Mr. Oliver, a family to support and children to\r\nprovide for, was just at the point of making a reputation and winning a\r\ncompetence \"when this execrable project was set on foot for my ruin as\r\nwell as that of America in general.\" And therefore Mr. Adams, and Mr.\r\nSamuel Adams, and Mr. Otis, and Mr. Gridley, in order to avert the ruin\r\nof America in general, were \"very warm\" to have the courts open and\r\nvery bitter against Messrs. Hutchinson and Oliver whose \"insolence and\r\nimpudence and chicanery\" in the matter were obvious, and whose secret\r\nmotives might easily be inferred. Little wonder if these men, who had\r\nmanaged by hook or crook to get into their own hands or into the hands\r\nof their families nearly all the lucrative offices in the province, now\r\nsought to curry favor with ministers in order to maintain their amazing\r\nascendancy!\r\n\r\nWhen the Stamp Act was passed, all men in America had professed\r\nthemselves, and were thought to be, Sons of Liberty. Even Mr. Hutchinson\r\nhad declared himself against ministerial measures. But scarce a month\r\nhad elapsed since the law was to have gone into effect before it was\r\nclear to the discerning that, for all their professions, most of\r\nthe \"better sort\" were not genuine Sons of Liberty at all, but timid\r\nsycophants, pliant instruments of despotism, far more intent upon the\r\nruin of Mr. Adams and of America in general than any minister could\r\nbe shown to be. For the policy of dispensing with activities requiring\r\nstamped papers, much lauded by these gentry as an effective and\r\nconstitutional means of defeating the law, was after all nothing but \"a\r\nsort of admittance of the legality of the Stamp Act, and had a tendency\r\nto enforce it, since there was just reason to apprehend that the\r\nsecret enemies of liberty had actually a design to introduce it by\r\nthe necessity to which the people would be reduced by the cessation of\r\nbusiness.\" It was well, therefore, in view of such insidious designs of\r\nsecret enemies, that the people, even to the lowest ranks, should become\r\n\"more attentive to their liberties, and more inquisitive about them, and\r\nmore determined to defend them, than they were ever before known or had\r\noccasion to be.\"\r\n\r\nTo defend their liberties, not against ministers but against ministerial\r\ntools, who were secret betrayers of America, true patriots accordingly\r\nbanded themselves in societies which took to themselves the name of Sons\r\nof Liberty and of which the object was, by \"putting business in motion\r\nagain, in the usual channels, without stamps,\" to prevent the Stamp Act\r\never being enforced. Such a society composed mainly of the lower orders\r\nof people and led by rising young lawyers, was formed in New York. On\r\nJanuary 7, at Mr. Howard's coffee house, abandoning the secrecy which\r\nhad hitherto veiled their activities, its members declared to the world\r\ntheir principles and the motives that would determine their action in\r\nthe future:\r\n\r\nResolved: That we will go to the last extremity and venture our lives\r\nand fortunes effectively to prevent the said Stamp Act from ever taking\r\nplace in this city and province; Resolved: That any person who shall\r\ndeliver out or receive any instrument of writing upon stamped paper ...\r\nshall incur the highest resentment of this society, and be branded with\r\neverlasting infamy; Resolved: That the people who carry on business as\r\nformerly on unstamped Paper ... shall be protected to the utmost power\r\nof this society.\r\n\r\nMalicious men said that the Sons of Liberty were \"much concerned that\r\nthe gentlemen of fortune don't publically join them,\" for which reason\r\nthe society \"formed a committee of correspondence with the Liberty Boys\r\nin the neighboring provinces.\" In February, the society did in fact\r\nappoint such a committee, which sent out letters to all the counties of\r\nNew York and to all the colonies except Georgia, proposing the formation\r\nof an intercolonial association of the true Sons of Liberty; to which\r\nletters many replies were received, some of which are still preserved\r\namong the papers of the secretary, Mr. John Lamb. The general sense\r\nof these letters was that an intercolonial association and close\r\ncorrespondence were highly necessary in view of the presence, in nearly\r\nevery colony, of many \"secret and inveterate enemies of liberty,\" and of\r\nthe desirability of keeping \"a watchful eye over all those who, from\r\nthe nature of their offices, vocations, or dispositions, may be the most\r\nlikely to introduce the use of stamped paper, to the total subversion of\r\nthe British constitution.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the society kept its watchful eye on every unusual activity and\r\nall suspicious characters, but to what extent it succeeded in \"putting\r\nbusiness in motion again, in the usual channels, without stamps,\" cannot\r\nbe said. Both before and after the society was founded, much business\r\nwas carried on in violation of the law: newspapers and pamphlets\r\ncontinued to flourish in the land; the inferior courts at least were\r\nsooner or later opened in nearly every colony; and not infrequently\r\nunstamped clearance papers were issued to shipmasters willing to take\r\nthe risk of seizure in London or elsewhere. Mr. John Hancock, easily\r\npersuading himself that there should be no risk, shipped a cargo of oil\r\nwith the Boston packet in December. \"I am under no apprehensions,\" he\r\nwrote his London agent. \"Should there be any Difficulty in London as\r\nto Marshall's clearance, You will please to represent the circumstances\r\nthat no stamps could be obtained, ... in which case I think I am to be\r\njustified, & am not liable to a seizure, or even run any risque at all,\r\nas I have taken the Step of the Law, and made application for clearance,\r\n& can get no other.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such practices, which were frequent enough, it was a\r\ndull winter, with little profit flowing into the coffers of Mr. Hancock,\r\nwith low wages or none at all for worthy artisans and laborers; so that\r\nit must often have seemed, as Governor Moore said, \"morally impossible\r\nthat the people here can subsist any time under such inconveniences\r\nas they have brought on themselves.\" Such inconveniences became more\r\nirksome as time passed, with the result that, during the cold and\r\ndreary months of February and March, it became every day a more pressing\r\nquestion, particularly for the poor, to know whether the bad times would\r\nend at last in the repeal or the admission of the tyrannical act.\r\n\r\nConfronted with this difficult dilemma, the faithful Sons of Liberty\r\nwere preparing in April to assemble a continental congress as a last\r\nresort, when rumors began to spread that Parliament was on the point\r\nof carrying the repeal. The project of a congress was accordingly\r\nabandoned, and everywhere recrimination gave place to rejoicing. On\r\nApril 21, 1766, the vigilant Boston Sons voted that when the rumors\r\nshould be confirmed they would celebrate the momentous event in a\r\nbefitting manner--would celebrate it \"Under the deepest Sense of Duty\r\nand Loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign King George, and in respect\r\nand Gratitude to the Patriotic Ministry, Mr. Pitt, and the Glorious\r\nMajority of both Houses of Parliament, by whose Influence, under Divine\r\nProvidence, against a most strenuous Opposition, a happy Repeal of the\r\nStamp Act, so unconstitutional as well as Grievous to His Majesty's good\r\nSubjects of America, is attained; whereby our incontestible Right of\r\nInternal Taxation remains to us inviolate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV DEFINING THE ISSUE\r\n\r\nA pepper-corn, in acknowledgement of the right, is of more value than\r\nmillions without it.--George Grenville.\r\n\r\nA perpetual jealousy respecting liberty, is absolutely requisite in all\r\nfree states.--John Dickinson.\r\n\r\nGood Americans everywhere celebrated the repeal of the Stamp Act with\r\nmuch festivity and joyful noises in the streets, and with \"genteel\r\nentertainments\" in taverns, where innumerable toasts were drunk to\r\nLiberty and to its English defenders. Before his house on Beacon Hill,\r\nMr. John Hancock, on occasion a generous man, erected a platform and\r\nplaced there a pipe of Madeira which was broached for all comers. At\r\nColonel Ingersoll's, where twenty-eight gentlemen attended to take\r\ndinner, fifteen toasts were drunk, \"and very loyal they were, and suited\r\nto the occasion\"; upon which occasion, we are told, Mr. Hancock again\r\n\"treated every person with cheerfulness.\" Throughout the land men with\r\nliterary gifts, or instincts, delivered themselves of vigorous free\r\nverse, founded upon the antithesis of Freedom and Tyranny, and enforcing\r\nthe universal truth that \"in the unequal war Oppressors fall, the hate,\r\ncontempt, and endless curse of all.\" In New York, on the occasion of the\r\nKing's birthday, an ox was roasted whole in the Fields, and twenty\r\nkegs of beer were opened for a great dinner at the King's Arms; and\r\nafterwards, through the generosity of the Assembly of that province,\r\nthere was erected on the Bowling Green a mounted statue--made of lead\r\nbut without present intention of being turned into bullets--representing\r\nHis Majesty King George the Third, of ever glorious memory, the Restorer\r\nof Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe joyful Americans could not know how little King George aspired to\r\nbe thought the Restorer of Liberty. In reality he was extremely sulky\r\nin his silent, stubborn way over the repeal of the Stamp Act, and vexed\r\nmost particularly at the part which he himself had been forced to\r\nplay in it. The idea of a Patriot King, conceived by Lord Bolingbroke\r\n(one-time Jacobite exile) and instilled into the mind of the young\r\nHanoverian monarch by an ambitious mother, had little to do with\r\nliberty, either British or colonial, but had much to do with authority.\r\nThe Patriot King was to be a king indeed, seeking advice of all virtuous\r\nmen of whatever connections, without being bound by any man or faction\r\nof men. It was not to restore liberty, nor yet to destroy it, but to\r\ndestroy factions, that the King was ambitious; and for this purpose he\r\ndesired a ministry that would do his bidding without too much question.\r\nIf Mr. Grenville did not satisfy His Majesty, it was not on account\r\nof the Stamp Act, in respect to which the King was wholly of Mr.\r\nGrenville's opinion that it was a just law and ought to be enforced. In\r\nJuly, 1765, when Mr. Grenville was dismissed, there had indeed as yet\r\nbeen no open resistance in America; and if the King had been somewhat\r\nannoyed by the high talk of his loyal subjects in Virginia, he had been\r\nannoyed much more by Mr. Grenville, who was disposed, in spite of his\r\noutward air of humility and solemn protestations of respect, to be very\r\nfirm with His Majesty in the matter of ministerial prerogative, reading\r\nhim from time to time carefully prepared pedantic little curtain\r\nlectures on the customs of the Constitution and the duties of kings\r\nunder particular circumstances.\r\n\r\nUnable to endure Mr. Grenville longer, the King turned to Mr. Pitt. This\r\nstatesman, although extremely domineering in the House, was much subdued\r\nin the presence of his sovereign, and along with many defects had one\r\ngreat virtue in his Majesty's eyes, which was that he shared the King's\r\ndesire to destroy the factions. The King was accordingly ready to\r\nreceive the Great Commoner, even though he insisted on bringing \"the\r\nConstitution,\" and Earl Temple into the bargain, with him to St. James's\r\nPalace. But when it appeared that Earl Temple was opposed to the repeal\r\nof the Stamp Act, Mr. Pitt declined after all to come to St. James's on\r\nany terms, even with his beloved Constitution; whereupon the harassed\r\nyoung King, rather than submit again to Mr. Grenville's lectures,\r\nsurrendered himself, temporarily, to the old-line Whigs under the lead\r\nof the Marquis of Rockingham. In all the negotiations which ended in\r\nthis unpromising arrangement of the King's business, the Stamp Act had\r\napparently not been once mentioned; except that Mr. Grenville, upon\r\nretiring, had ventured to say to His Majesty, as a kind of abbreviated\r\nparting homily, that if \"any man ventured to defeat the regulations\r\nlaid down for the colonies, by a slackness in the execution, he [Mr.\r\nGrenville] should look upon him as a criminal and the betrayer of his\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Rockingham and his friends had no intention of betraying\r\ntheir country. They had, perhaps, when they were thus accidentally\r\nlifted to power, no very definite intentions of any sort. Respecting the\r\nStamp Act, as most alarming reports began to come in from America,\r\nHis Majesty's Opposition, backed by the landed interest and led by\r\nMr. Grenville and the Duke of Bedford, knew its mind much sooner than\r\nministers knew theirs. America was in open rebellion, they said, and so\r\nfar from doing anything about it ministers were not even prepared, four\r\nmonths after disturbances began, to lay necessary information before\r\nthe House. Under pressure of such talk, the Marquis of Rockingham had\r\nto make up his mind. It would be odd and contrary to well-established\r\nprecedent for ministers to adopt a policy already outlined by\r\nOpposition; and in view of the facts that good Whig tradition, even\r\nif somewhat obscured in latter days, committed them to some kind of\r\nliberalism, that the City and the mercantile interest thought Mr.\r\nGrenville's measures disastrous to trade, and that they were much in\r\nneed of Mr. Pitt's eloquence to carry them through, ministers at last,\r\nin January, 1766, declared for the repeal.\r\n\r\nNow that it was a question of repealing Mr. Grenville's measures,\r\nserious attention was given to them; and honorable members, in the\r\nnotable debate of 1766, learned much about America and the rights of\r\nEnglishmen which they had not known before. Lord Mansfield, the most\r\neminent legal authority in England, argued that the Stamp Act was\r\nclearly within the power of Parliament, while Lord Camden, whose opinion\r\nwas by no means to be despised, staked his reputation that the law was\r\nunconstitutional. Mr. Grenville, in his precise way, laid it down\r\nas axiomatic that since \"Great Britain protects America, America is\r\ntherefore bound to yield obedience\"; if not; he desired to know when\r\nAmericans were emancipated. Whereupon Mr. Pitt, springing up, desired\r\nto know when they were made slaves. The Great Commoner rejoiced that\r\nAmerica had resisted, and expressed the belief that three millions of\r\npeople so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit\r\nto be made slaves would be very fit instruments to make slaves of all\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nHonorable members were more disposed to listen to Mr. Pitt than to vote\r\nwith him; and were doubtless less influenced by his hot eloquence than\r\nby the representations of English merchants to the effect that trade was\r\nbeing ruined by Mr. Grenville's measures. Sir George Seville, honorable\r\nmember for Yorkshire, spoke the practical mind of business men when he\r\nwrote to Lord Rockingham: \"Our trade is hurt; what the devil have you\r\nbeen doing? For our part, we don't pretend to understand your politics\r\nand American matters, but our trade is hurt: pray remedy it, and a\r\nplague of you if you won't.\" This was not so eloquent as Mr. Pitt's\r\nspeech, but still very eloquent in its way and more easily followed\r\nthan Mr. Pitt's theory that \"taxation is no part of the governing or\r\nlegislative power.\"\r\n\r\nConstitutional arguments, evenly balanced pro and con, were not certain\r\nto change many minds, while such brief statements as that of Sir George\r\nSeville, although clearly revealing the opinion of that gentleman,\r\ndid little to enlighten the House on the merits of the question. That\r\nmembers might have every opportunity to inform themselves about America,\r\nthe ministers thought it worth while to have Benjamin Franklin of\r\nPhiladelphia, printer and Friend of the Human Race, brought before the\r\nbar of the House to make such statements of fact or opinion as might be\r\ndesired of him. The examination was a long one; the questions very much\r\nto the point; the replies very ready and often more to the point than\r\nthe questions. With much exact information the provincial printer\r\nmaintained that the colonists, having taxed themselves heavily in\r\nsupport of the last war, were not well able to pay more taxes, and that,\r\neven if they were abundantly able, the sugar duties and the stamp\r\ntax were improper measures. The stamps, in remote districts, would\r\nfrequently require more in postage to obtain than the value of the tax.\r\nThe sugar duties had already greatly diminished the volume of colonial\r\ntrade, while both the duties and the tax, having to be paid in silver,\r\nwere draining America of its specie and thus making it impossible for\r\nmerchants to import from England to the same extent as formerly. It\r\nwas well known that at the moment Americans were indebted to English\r\nmerchants to the amount of several million pounds sterling, which they\r\nwere indeed willing, as English merchants themselves said, but unable\r\nto pay. Necessarily, therefore, Americans were beginning to manufacture\r\ntheir own cloth, which they could very well do. Before their old clothes\r\nwere worn out they \"would have new ones of their own making.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the Stamp Act, honorable members were reminded, there was a\r\nspecial objection to be urged. It was thought with good reason to be\r\nunconstitutional, which would make its application difficult, if not\r\nimpossible. Troops might no doubt be sent to enforce it, but troops\r\nwould find no enemy to contend with, no men in arms; they would find no\r\nrebellion in America, although they might indeed create one. Pressed by\r\nMr. Townshend to say whether the colonies might not, on the ground of\r\nMagna Carta, as well deny the validity of external as internal taxes,\r\nthe Doctor was not ready to commit himself on that point. It was true\r\nmany arguments had lately been used in England to show Americans that,\r\nif Parliament has no right to tax them internally, it has none to tax\r\nthem externally, or to make any other law to bind them; in reply to\r\nwhich, he could only say that \"at present they do not reason so, but in\r\ntime they may possibly be convinced by these arguments.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the Parliament was truly enlightened and resolved by statistical\r\ninformation and lofty constitutional argument is not certainly known;\r\nbut it is known that the King, whose steady mind did not readily change,\r\nwas still opposed to the repeal, a fact supposed to be not without\r\ninfluence in unsettling the opinions of some honorable members. Lord\r\nMansfield had discreetly advised His Majesty that although it was\r\ncontrary to the spirit of the constitution to \"endeavour by His\r\nMajesty's name to carry questions in Parliament, yet where the lawful\r\nrights of the King and Parliament were to be asserted and maintained, he\r\nthought the making His Majesty's opinion in support of those rights to\r\nbe known, was very fit and becoming.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinction was subtle, but perhaps not too subtle for a great\r\nlawyer. It was apparently not too subtle for a Patriot King, since\r\ncertain noble lords who could be counted on to know the King's wishes\r\nconveyed information to the proper persons that those who found it\r\nagainst their conscience to vote for the repeal would not for that\r\nreason be received coldly at St. James's Palace. In order to preserve\r\nthe constitution as well as to settle the question of the repeal on its\r\nmerits, Lord Rockingham and the Earl of Shelburne obtained an interview\r\nwith the King at which they pointed out to him the manifest irregularity\r\nof such a procedure, and in addition expressed their conviction that, on\r\naccount of the high excitement in the City, failure to repeal the\r\nStamp Act would be attended with very serious consequences. Whether to\r\npreserve the Constitution, or to allow the repeal to be determined on\r\nits merits, or for some other reason, the King at last gave in writing\r\nhis consent to the ministers' measure. On February 22, by a vote of\r\n275 to 167, Mr. Conway was given leave to bring in the bill for a total\r\nrepeal of the Stamp Act. The bill was accordingly brought in, passed by\r\nboth houses, and on March 18 assented to by the King.\r\n\r\nIn the colonies the repeal was thought to be a victory for true\r\nprinciples of government, at least a tacit admission by the mother\r\ncountry that the American interpretation of the Constitution was the\r\ncorrect one. No Englishman denied that the repeal was an American\r\nvictory; and there were some, like Pitt and Camden, who preferred\r\nthe constitutional theories of Daniel Dulaney ¹ to those of George\r\nGrenville. But most Englishmen who took the trouble to have any views on\r\nsuch recondite matters, having in general a poor opinion of provincial\r\nlogic, easily dismissed the whole matter with the convincing phrase of\r\nCharles Townshend that the distinction between internal and external\r\ntaxes was \"perfect nonsense.\" The average Briton, taking it for granted\r\nthat all the subtle legal aspects of the question had been thoroughly\r\ngone into by Lord Mansfield, was content to read Mr. Soame Jenyns, a\r\nwriter of verse and member of the Board of Trade, who in a leisure hour\r\nhad recently turned his versatile mind to the consideration of colonial\r\nrights with the happiest results. In twenty-three very small pages\r\nhe had disposed of the \"Objections to the Taxation of Our American\r\nColonies\" in a manner highly satisfactory to himself and doubtless also\r\nto the average reading Briton, who understood constitutional questions\r\nbest when they were \"briefly considered,\" and when they were humorously\r\nexpounded in pamphlets that could be had for sixpence.\r\n\r\n¹ Daniel Dulaney, of Maryland, was the author of a pamphlet entitled\r\nConsiderations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes on the British\r\nColonies. Pitt, in his speech on the repeal of the Stamp Act, referred\r\nto this pamphlet as a masterly performance.\r\n\r\nHaving a logical mind, Mr. Jenyns easily perceived that taxes could\r\nbe objected to on two grounds: the ground of right and the ground of\r\nexpediency. In his opinion the right of Parliament to lay taxes on\r\nAmerica and the expediency of doing so at the present moment were\r\npropositions so clear that any man, in order not to bring his\r\nintelligence in question, needed to apologize for undertaking to defend\r\nthem. Mr. Jenyns wished it known that he was not the man to carry owls\r\nto Athens, and that he would never have thought it necessary to prove\r\neither the right or the expediency of taxing our American colonies, \"had\r\nnot many arguments been lately flung out ... which with insolence equal\r\nto their absurdity deny them both.\" With this conciliatory preliminary\r\ndisclaimer of any lack of intelligence on his own part, Mr. Jenyns\r\nproceeded to point out, in his most happy vein, how unsubstantial\r\nAmerican reasoning really appeared when, brushing aside befogging\r\nirrelevancies, you once got to the heart of the question.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the question was the proposition that there should be no\r\ntaxation without representation; upon which principle it was necessary\r\nto observe only that many individuals in England, such as copyholders\r\nand leaseholders, and many communities, such as Manchester and\r\nBirmingham, were taxed in Parliament without being represented there. If\r\nAmericans quoted you \"Lock, Sidney, Selden, and many other great names\r\nto prove that every Englishman ... is still represented in Parliament,\"\r\nhe would only ask why, since Englishmen are all represented in\r\nParliament, are not all Americans represented in exactly the same way?\r\nEither Manchester is not represented or Massachusetts is. \"Are Americans\r\nnot British subjects? Are they not Englishmen? Or are they only\r\nEnglishmen when they solicit protection, but not Englishmen when taxes\r\nare required to enable this country to protect them?\" Americans said\r\nthey had Assemblies of their own to tax them, which was a privilege\r\ngranted them by charter, without which \"that liberty which every\r\nEnglishman has a right to is torn from them, they are all slaves, and\r\nall is lost.\" Colonial charters were, however, \"undoubtedly no more than\r\nthose of all corporations, which empower them to make bye-laws.\" As for\r\n\"liberty,\" the word had so many meanings, \"having within a few years\r\nbeen used as a synonymous term for Blasphemy, Bawdy, Treason, Libels,\r\nStrong Beer, and Cyder,\" that Mr. Jenyns could not presume to say what\r\nit meant.\r\n\r\nAgainst the expediency of the taxes, Mr. Jenyns found that two\r\nobjections had been raised: that the time was improper and the manner\r\nwrong. As to the manner, the colonies themselves had in a way prescribed\r\nit, since they had not been able at the request of ministers to suggest\r\nany other. The time Mr. Jenyns thought most propitious, a point upon\r\nwhich he grew warm and almost serious.\r\n\r\nCan any time be more proper to require some assistance from our\r\ncolonies, to preserve to themselves their present safety, than when this\r\ncountry is almost undone by procuring it? Can any time be more proper to\r\nimpose some tax upon their trade, than when they are enabled to rival us\r\nin their manufactures by the encouragement and protection which we\r\nhave given them? Can any time be more proper to oblige them to settle\r\nhandsome incomes on their governors, than when we find them unable to\r\nprocure a subsistence on any other terms than those of breaking all\r\ntheir instructions, and betraying the rights of their Sovereign? ... Can\r\nthere be a more proper time to force them to maintain an army at their\r\nexpence, than when that army is necessary for their own protection, and\r\nwe are utterly unable to support it? Lastly, can there be a more proper\r\ntime for this mother country to leave off feeding out of her own vitals\r\nthese children whom she has nursed up, than when they are arrived at\r\nsuch strength and maturity as to be well able to provide for themselves,\r\nand ought rather with filial duty to give some assistance to her\r\ndistresses?\r\n\r\nAmericans, after all, were not the only ones who might claim to have a\r\ngrievance!\r\n\r\nIt was upon a lighter note, not to end in anticlimax, that Mr. Jenyns\r\nconcluded his able pamphlet. He had heard it hinted that allowing the\r\ncolonies representation in Parliament would be a simple plan for making\r\ntaxes legal. The impracticability of this plan, he would not go into,\r\nsince the plan itself had nowhere been seriously pressed, but he would,\r\nupon that head, offer the following consideration:\r\n\r\nI have lately seen so many specimens of the great powers of speech of\r\nwhich these American gentlemen are possessed, that I should be much\r\nafraid that the sudden importation of so much eloquence at once would\r\ngreatly endanger the safety of the government of this country.... If we\r\ncan avail ourselves of these taxes on no other condition, I shall never\r\nlook upon it as a measure of frugality, being perfectly satisfied that\r\nin the end, it will be much cheaper for us to pay their army than their\r\norators.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenyns's pamphlet, which could be had for sixpence, was widely read,\r\nwith much appreciation for its capital wit and extraordinary common\r\nsense; more widely read in England than Mr. James Otis's Rights of the\r\nBritish Colonies Asserted and Proved or Daniel Dulaney's Considerations\r\non the Propriety of Imposing Taxes on the British Colonies; and it\r\ntherefore did much more than these able pamphlets to clarify English\r\nopinion on the rights of Parliament and the expediency of taxing\r\nAmerica. No one could deny that Government had yielded in the face of\r\nnoisy clamor and forcible resistance. To yield under the circumstances\r\nmay have been wise or not; but Government had not yielded on any ground\r\nof right, but had on the contrary most expressly affirmed, in the\r\nDeclaratory Act, that \"the King's Majesty, by and with the advice of\r\nthe lords spiritual and temporal, and commons of Great Britain, in\r\nParliament assembled, had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power\r\nand authority to make such laws and statutes of sufficient force and\r\nvalidity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the\r\nCrown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.\" Government had not\r\neven denied the expediency of taxing America, the total repeal of the\r\nStamp Act and the modification of the Sugar Act having been carried on a\r\nconsideration of the inexpediency of these particular taxes only. Taxes\r\nnot open to the same objection might in future be found, and doubtless\r\nmust be found, inasmuch as the troops were still retained in America and\r\nthe Quartering Act continued in force there. For new taxes, however, it\r\nwould doubtless be necessary to await the formation of a new ministry.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a new ministry was not an unusual occurrence in\r\nthe early years of King George the Third. No one supposed that Lord\r\nRockingham could hold on many months; and as early as July, 1766, all\r\nLondon knew that Mr. Pitt had been sent for. The coming and going\r\nof great men in times of ministerial crisis was always a matter of\r\ninterest; but the formation of that ministry of all the factions which\r\nthe Patriot King had long desired was something out of the ordinary, the\r\npoint of greatest speculation being how many irreconcilables Mr. Pitt\r\n(the Earl of Chatham he was now) could manage to get seated about a\r\nsingle table. From the point of view of irreconcilability, no one was\r\nmore eligible than Mr. Charles Townshend, at that moment Paymaster\r\nof the Forces, a kind of enfant terrible of English politics, of whom\r\nHorace Walpole could say, with every likelihood of being believed,\r\nthat \"his speech of last Friday, made while half drunk, was all wit and\r\nindiscretion; nobody but he could have made it, nobody but he would\r\nhave made it if he could. He beat Lord Chatham in language, Burke in\r\nmetaphors, Grenville in presumption, Rigby in impudence, himself in\r\nfolly, and everybody in good humour.\"\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, much to his astonishment, one day received the following\r\nnote from Lord Chatham: \"Sir: You are too great a magnitude not to be\r\nin a responsible place; I intend to propose you for Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and must desire to have your answer by nine o'clock tonight.\"\r\nMr. Townshend was dismayed as well as astonished, his dismay arising\r\nfrom the fact that the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer was worth\r\nbut £2700, which was precisely £4300 less than he was then receiving as\r\nPaymaster of the Forces. To be a great magnitude on small pay had its\r\ndisadvantages, and Mr. Townshend, after remaining home all day in great\r\ndistress of mind, begged Mr. Pitt to be allowed to retain the office\r\nof Paymaster; which was no sooner granted than he changed his mind and\r\nbegged Mr. Pitt to be allowed to accept the Exchequer place, which Mr.\r\nPitt at first refused and was only persuaded to grant finally upon the\r\nintercession of the Duke of Grafton. The day following, Mr. Townshend\r\naccordingly informed the King that he had decided, in view of the\r\nurgent representations of the Earl of Chatham, to accept the office of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer in his Majesty's new ministry.\r\n\r\nNo one supposed, least of all himself, that this delightful man would\r\nhave any influence in formulating the policies of the Chatham ministry.\r\nLord Chatham's policies were likely to be his own; and in the present\r\ncase, so far as America was concerned, they were not such as could be\r\nreadily associated with Mr. Townshend's views, so far as those views\r\nwere known or were not inconsistent. For dealing with America, the\r\nEarl of Shelburne, because of his sympathetic understanding of colonial\r\nmatters, had been brought into the ministry to formulate a comprehensive\r\nand conciliatory plan; as for the revenue, always the least part of Lord\r\nChatham's difficulties as it was the chief of Mr. Grenville's, it was\r\nthought that the possessions of the East India Company, if taken over by\r\nthe Government, would bring into the Treasury sums quite sufficient to\r\npay the debt as well as to relieve the people, in England and America\r\nat least, of those heavy taxes which Mr. Grenville and his party had\r\nthought necessarily involved in the extension of empire. It was a\r\ncurious chapter of accidents that brought all these well-laid plans\r\nto nought. Scarcely was the ministry formed when the Earl of Chatham,\r\nincapacitated by the gout, retired into a seclusion that soon became\r\nimpenetrable; and \"even before this resplendent orb was entirely set,\r\nand while the western horizon was in a blaze with his descending glory,\r\non the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another luminary, and, for\r\nhis hour, became lord of the ascendant.\" This luminary was Mr. Charles\r\nTownshend.\r\n\r\nMr. Townshend was the \"delight and ornament\" of the House, as Edmund\r\nBurke said. Never was a man in any country of \"more pointed and finished\r\nwit, or (where his passions were not concerned) of a more refined,\r\nexquisite, and penetrating judgment\"; never a man to excel him in\r\n\"luminous explanation and display of his subject,\" nor ever one less\r\ntedious or better able to conform himself exactly to the temper of the\r\nHouse which he seemed to guide because he was always sure to follow it.\r\nIn 1765 Mr. Townshend had voted for the Stamp Act, but in 1766, when the\r\nStamp Act began to be no favorite, he voted for the repeal, and would\r\nhave spoken for it too, if an illness had not prevented him. And now,\r\nin 1767, Mr. Townshend was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as such\r\nresponsible for the revenue; a man without any of that temperamental\r\nobstinacy which persists in opinions once formed, and without any fixed\r\nopinions to persist in; but quite disposed, according to habit, to\r\n\"hit the House just between wind and water,\" and to win its applause by\r\nspeaking for the majority, or by \"haranguing inimitably on both sides\"\r\nwhen the majority was somewhat uncertain.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1767, when Lord Chatham was absent and the majority was\r\nvery uncertain, Mr. Grenville took occasion, in the debate upon the\r\nextraordinaries for the army in England and America, to move that\r\nAmerica, like Ireland, should support its own establishment. The\r\nopportunity was one which Mr. Townshend could not let pass. Much to the\r\nastonishment of every one and most of all to that of his colleagues in\r\nthe ministry, he supported Mr. Grenville's resolution, declaring himself\r\nnow in favor of the Stamp Act which he had voted to repeal, treating\r\n\"Lord Chatham's distinction between internal and external taxation as\r\ncontemptuously as Mr. Grenville had done,\" and pledging himself able, if\r\nnecessary, to find a revenue in America nearly adequate to the proposed\r\nproject. The Earl of Shelburne, in great distress of mind, at once wrote\r\nto Lord Chatham, relating the strange if characteristic conduct of the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and declaring himself entirely ignorant of\r\nthe intentions of his colleagues. It was indeed an anomalous situation.\r\nIf Lord Chatham's policies were still to be considered those of\r\nthe ministry, Mr. Townshend might be said to be in opposition, a\r\ncircumstance which made \"many people think Lord Chatham ill at St.\r\nJames's\" only.\r\n\r\nLord Chatham was not ill at St. James's. He was most likely very well\r\nat St. James's, being unable to appear there, thus leaving the divided\r\nministry amenable to the King's management or helpless before a factious\r\nOpposition. The opportunity of the Opposition came when the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, in February, proposed to continue the land tax at four\r\nshillings for one year more, after which time, he thought, it might be\r\nreduced to three shillings in view of additional revenues to be obtained\r\nfrom the East India Company. But Opposition saw no reason why, in\r\nview of the revenue which Mr. Townshend had pledged himself to find in\r\nAmerica, a shilling might not be taken from the land at once, a proposal\r\nwhich Mr. Dowdeswell moved should be done, and which was accordingly\r\nvoted through the influence of Mr. Grenville and the Duke of Bedford,\r\nwho had formerly carried the Stamp Act, aided by the Rockingham Whigs\r\nwho had formerly repealed it. If Lord Chatham was ill at St. James's,\r\nthis was a proper time to resign. It was doubtless a proper time to\r\nresign in any case. But Lord Chatham did not resign. In March he came\r\nto London, endeavored to replace Mr. Townshend by Lord North, which he\r\nfailed to do, and then retired to Bath to be seen no more, leaving Mr.\r\nTownshend more than ever \"master of the revels.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Townshend did not resign either, but continued in office, quite\r\nundisturbed by the fact that a cardinal measure of the ministry had been\r\ndecisively voted down. Mr. Townshend reasoned that if Opposition would\r\nnot support the ministry, all difficulties would be straightened out by\r\nthe ministry's supporting the Opposition. This was the more reasonable\r\nsince Opposition had perhaps been right after all, so far as the\r\ncolonies were concerned. Late reports from that quarter seemed to\r\nindicate that the repeal of the Stamp Act, far from satisfying the\r\nAmericans, had only confirmed that umbrageous people in a spirit of\r\nlicentiousness, which was precisely what Opposition had predicted as\r\nthe sure result of any weak concession. The New York Assembly, it now\r\nappeared, refused to make provision for the troops according to the\r\nterms of the Quartering Act; New York merchants were petitioning for\r\na further modification of the trade acts; the precious Bostonians,\r\nwrangling refined doctrinaire points with Governor Bernard, were making\r\ninterminable difficulties about compensating the sufferers from the\r\nStamp Act riots. If Lord Chatham, in February, 1767, could go so far\r\nas to say that the colonies had \"drunk deep of the baneful cup of\r\ninfatuation,\" Mr. Townshend, having voted for the Stamp Act and for its\r\nrepeal, might well think, in May, that the time was ripe for a return to\r\nrigorous measures.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, in a speech which charmed the House, Mr. Townshend opened\r\nhis plan for settling the colonial question. The growing spirit of\r\ninsubordination, which must be patent to all, he thought could be most\r\neffectively checked by making an example of New York, where defiance\r\nwas at present most open; for which purpose it was proposed that the\r\nmeetings of the Assembly of that province be totally suspended until\r\nit should have complied with the terms of the Mutiny Act. As one chief\r\nsource of power in colonial assemblies which contributed greatly to make\r\nthem insubordinate was the dependence of executive officials upon them\r\nfor salaries, Mr. Townshend now renewed the proposal, which he had\r\nformerly brought forward in 1763, to create an independent civil list\r\nfor the payment of governors and judges from England. The revenue for\r\nsuch a civil list would naturally be raised in America. Mr. Townshend\r\nwould not, however, venture to renew the Stamp Act, which had been so\r\nopposed on the ground of its being an internal tax. He was free to say\r\nthat the distinction between internal and external taxes was perfect\r\nnonsense; but, since the logical Americans thought otherwise, he would\r\nconcede the point and would accordingly humor them by laying only\r\nexternal duties, which he thought might well be on various kinds of\r\nglass and paper, on red and white lead, and upon teas, the duties to be\r\ncollected in colonial ports upon the importation of these commodities\r\nfrom England. It was estimated that the duties might altogether make\r\nabout £40,000, if the collection were properly attended to; and in order\r\nthat the collection might be properly attended to, and for the more\r\nefficient administration of the American customs in general, Mr.\r\nTownshend further recommended that a Board of Customs Commissioners be\r\ncreated and established in Massachusetts Bay. With slight opposition,\r\nall these recommendations were enacted into law; and the Commissioners\r\nof the Customs, shortly afterward appointed by the King, arrived in\r\nBoston in November, 1767.\r\n\r\nAt Boston, the Commissioners found much to be done in the way of\r\ncollecting the customs, particularly in the matter of Madeira wines.\r\nMadeira wines were much drunk in the old Bay colony, being commonly\r\nimported directly from the islands, without too much attention to the\r\nduty of £7 per ton lawfully required in that case. Mr. John Hancock, a\r\npopular Boston merchant, did a thriving business in this way; and his\r\nsloop Liberty, in the ordinary course of trade, carrying six pipes of\r\n\"good saleable Madeira\" for the coffee-house retailers, four pipes of\r\nthe \"very best\" for his own table, and \"two pipes more of the best ...\r\nfor the Treasurer of the province,\" entered the harbor on May 9,\r\n1768. In the evening Mr. Thomas Kirk, tide-waiter, acting for the\r\nCommissioners, boarded the sloop, where he found the captain, Nat\r\nBernard, and also, by some chance, another of Mr. Hancock's skippers,\r\nyoung James Marshall, together with half a dozen of his friends. They\r\nsat with punch served by the captain all round until nine o'clock, when\r\nyoung James Marshall casually asked if a few casks might not as well be\r\nset on shore that evening. Mr. Kirk replied that it could not be done\r\nwith his leave; whereupon he found himself \"hoved down\" into the cabin\r\nand confined there for three hours, from which point of disadvantage\r\nhe could distinctly hear overhead \"a noise of many people at work,\r\na-hoisting out of goods.\" In due time Mr. Kirk was released, having\r\nsuffered no injury, except perhaps a little in his official character.\r\nNext day Mr. Hancock's cargo was duly entered, no pipes of Madeira\r\nlisted; and to all appearance the only serious aspect of the affair\r\nwas that young James Marshall died before morning, it was thought from\r\noverexertion and excitement.\r\n\r\nVery likely few people in Boston knew anything about this interesting\r\nepisode; and a month later much excitement was accordingly raised by\r\nthe news that Mr. Hancock's sloop Liberty had been ordered seized\r\nfor non-payment of customs. A crowd watched the ship towed, for\r\nsafe-keeping, under the guns of the Romney in the harbor. When the\r\nCommissioners, who had come down to see the thing done, left the wharf\r\nthey were roughly handled by the incensed people; and in the evening\r\nwindows of some of their houses were broken, and a boat belonging to a\r\ncollector was hauled on shore and burnt on the Common. Governor Bernard\r\nat last informed the Commissioners that he could not protect them in\r\nBoston, whereupon they retired with their families to the Romney, and\r\nlater to Castle William. There they continued, under difficulties, the\r\nwork of systematizing the American customs; and not without success,\r\ninasmuch as the income from the duties during the years from 1768 to\r\n1774 averaged about £30,000 sterling, at an annual cost to the revenue\r\nof not more than £13,000. This saving was nevertheless not effected\r\nwithout the establishment at Boston, on the recommendation of the\r\nCommissioners, of two regiments of the line which arrived September\r\n28, 1768, and were landed under the guns of eight men-of-war, without\r\nopposition. The cost of maintaining the two regiments in Boston was\r\ndoubtless not included in the £13,000 charged to the revenue as the\r\nannual expense of collecting £30,000 of customs.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the two regiments of the line, with artillery, Boston was\r\nnot quiet in this year 1768. The soldiers acted decently enough, no\r\ndoubt; but their manners were very British and their coats were red,\r\nand \"their simple presence,\" conveying every day the suggestion of\r\ncompulsion, was \"an intolerable grievance.\" Every small matter was\r\nmagnified. The people, says Hutchinson, \"had been used to answer to the\r\ncall of the town watch in the night, yet they did not like to answer\r\nto the frequent calls of the centinels posted at the barracks; ... and\r\neither a refusal to answer, or an answer accompanied with irritating\r\nlanguage, endangered the peace of the town.\" On Sundays, especially,\r\nthe Boston mind found something irreverent, something at the very least\r\nirrelevant, in the presence of the bright colored and highly secular\r\ncoats; while the noise of fife and drum, so disturbing to the sabbath\r\ncalm, called forth from the Selectmen a respectful petition to the\r\ngeneral requesting him to \"dispense with the band.\"\r\n\r\nThese were but slight matters; but as time passed little grievances\r\naccumulated on both sides until the relation between the people and the\r\nsoldiers was one of settled hostility, and at last, after two years, the\r\ntense situation culminated in the famous Boston Massacre. On the evening\r\nof March 5, 1770, there was an alarm of fire, false as it turned out,\r\nwhich brought many people into the streets, especially boys, whom one\r\nmay easily imagine catching up, as they ran, handfuls of damp snow to\r\nmake snowballs. For snowballs, there could be no better target than\r\nred-coated sentinels standing erect and motionless at the post of duty;\r\nand it chanced that one of these individuals, stationed before the\r\nCustoms House door, was pelted with the close-packed missiles. Being\r\nseveral times struck, he called for aid, the guard turned out, and a\r\ncrowd gathered. One of the soldiers was presently knocked down, another\r\nwas hit by a club, and at last six or seven shots were fired, with or\r\nwithout orders, the result of which was four citizens lying dead on the\r\nsnow-covered streets of Boston.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Massacre was not as serious as the Massacre of Saint\r\nBartholomew or the Sicilian Vespers; but it served to raise passion to\r\na white heat in the little provincial town. On the next day there was\r\nassembled, under the skillful leadership of Samuel Adams, a great town\r\nmeeting which demanded in no uncertain terms the removal of the troops\r\nfrom Boston. Under the circumstances, six hundred British soldiers would\r\nhave fared badly in Boston; and in order to prevent further bloodshed,\r\nacting Governor Hutchinson finally gave the order. Within a fortnight,\r\nthe two small regiments retired to Castle William. Seven months later\r\nCaptain Preston and other soldiers implicated in the riot were tried\r\nbefore a Boston jury. Ably defended by John Adams and Josiah Quincy,\r\nthey were all acquitted on the evidence, except two who were convicted\r\nand lightly punished for manslaughter.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the Boston Massacre occurred on the 5th of March, 1770,\r\nwhich was the very day that Lord North rose in the House of Commons to\r\npropose the partial repeal of the Townshend duties. This outcome was not\r\nunconnected with events that had occurred in America during the eighteen\r\nmonths since the landing of the troops in Boston in September, 1768. In\r\n1768, John Adams could not have foretold the Boston Massacre, or have\r\nforeseen that he would himself incur popular displeasure for having\r\ndefended the soldiers. But he could, even at that early date, divine the\r\nmotives of the British government in sending the troops to Boston. To\r\nhis mind, \"the very appearance of the troops in Boston was a strong\r\nproof ... that the determination of Great Britain to subjugate us was\r\ntoo deep and inveterate to be altered.\" All the measures of ministry\r\nseemed indeed to confirm that view. Mr. Townshend's condescension in\r\naccepting the colonial distinction between internal and external taxes\r\nwas clearly only a subtle maneuver designed to conceal an attack upon\r\nliberty far more dangerous than the former attempts of Mr. Grenville.\r\nAfter all, Mr. Townshend was probably right in thinking the distinction\r\nof no importance, the main point being whether, as Lord Chatham had\r\nsaid, the Parliament could by any kind of taxes \"take money out of their\r\npockets without their consent.\"\r\n\r\nDuties on glass and tea certainly would take money out of their pockets\r\nwithout their consent, and therefore it must be true that taxes could be\r\nrightly laid only by colonial assemblies, in which alone Americans could\r\nbe represented. But of what value was it to preserve the abstract\r\nright of taxation by colonial assemblies if meanwhile the assemblies\r\nthemselves might, by act of Parliament, be abolished? And had not the\r\nNew York Assembly been suspended by act of Parliament? And were not\r\nthe new duties to be used to pay governors and judges, thus by subtle\r\nindirection undermining the very basis of legislative independence?\r\nAnd now, in the year 1768, the Massachusetts Assembly, having sent a\r\ncircular letter to the other colonies requesting concerted action in\r\ndefense of their liberties, was directed by Lord Hillsborough, speaking\r\nin his Majesty's name, \"to rescind the resolution which gave birth\r\nto the circular letter from the Speaker, and to declare their\r\ndisapprobation of, and dissent to, that rash and hasty proceeding.\"\r\nClearly, it was no mere question of taxation but the larger question of\r\nlegislative independence that now confronted Americans.\r\n\r\nA more skillful dialectic was required to defend American rights against\r\nthe Townshend duties than against the Stamp Act. It was a somewhat\r\nstubborn fact that Parliament had for more than a hundred years passed\r\nlaws effectively regulating colonial trade, and for regulating trade had\r\nimposed duties, some of which had brought into the Exchequer a certain\r\nrevenue. Americans, wishing to be thought logical as well as loyal,\r\ncould not well say at this late date that Parliament had no right to lay\r\nduties in regulation of trade. Must they then submit to the Townshend\r\nduties? Or was it possible to draw a line, making a distinction, rather\r\nmore subtle than the old one between internal and external taxes,\r\nbetween duties for regulation and duties for revenue? This latter feat\r\nwas undertaken by Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, anonymously, under\r\nthe guise of a simple but intelligent and virtuous farmer whose arcadian\r\nexistence had confirmed in him an instinctive love of liberty and had\r\nsupplied him with the leisure to meditate at large upon human welfare\r\nand the excellent British Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickinson readily granted America to be dependent upon Great\r\nBritain, \"as much dependent upon Great Britain as one perfectly\r\nfree people can be on another.\" But it appeared axiomatic to the\r\nunsophisticated mind of a simple farmer that no people could be free if\r\ntaxed without its consent, and that Parliament had accordingly no right\r\nto lay any taxes upon the colonies; from which it followed that the\r\nsole question in respect to duties laid on trade was whether they were\r\nintended for revenue or for regulation. Intention in such matters was\r\nof primary importance, since all duties were likely to be regulative\r\nto some extent. It might be objected that \"it will be difficult for any\r\npersons but the makers of the laws to determine which of them are made\r\nfor regulation of trade, and which for raising a revenue.\" This was\r\ntrue enough but at present of academic importance only, inasmuch as the\r\nmakers of the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Townshend duties had\r\nconveniently and very clearly proclaimed their intention to be the\r\nraising of a revenue. Yet this question, academic now, might soon become\r\nextremely practical. The makers of laws might not always express their\r\nintention so explicitly; they might, with intention to raise a revenue,\r\npass acts professing to be for regulation only; and therefore, since\r\n\"names will not change the nature of things,\" Americans ought \"firmly\r\nto believe ... that unless the most watchful attention be exerted, a\r\nnew servitude may be slipped upon us under the sanction of usual and\r\nrespectable terms.\" In such case the intention should be inferred from\r\nthe nature of the act; and the Farmer, for his part, sincerely hoped\r\nthat his countrymen \"would never, to their latest existence, want\r\nunderstanding sufficient to discover the intentions of those who rule\r\nover them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dickinson's Farmer's Letters were widely read and highly commended.\r\nThe argument, subtle but clear, deriving the nature of an act from the\r\nintention of its makers, and the intention of its makers from the nature\r\nof the act, contributed more than any other exposition to convince\r\nAmericans that they \"have the same right that all states have, of\r\njudging when their privileges are invaded.\"\r\n\r\n\"As much dependent on Great Britain as one perfectly free people can be\r\non another,\" the Farmer said. Englishmen might be excused for desiring\r\na more precise delimitation of parliamentary jurisdiction than could\r\nbe found in this phrase, as well as for asking what clear legal ground\r\nthere was for making any delimitation at all. To the first point, Mr.\r\nDickinson said in effect that Parliament had not the right to tax the\r\ncolonies and that it had not the right to abolish their assemblies\r\nthrough which they alone could tax themselves. The second point Mr.\r\nDickinson did not clearly answer, although it was undoubtedly most\r\nfundamental. To this point Mr. Samuel Adams had given much thought;\r\nand in letters which he drafted for the Massachusetts Assembly, in the\r\nfamous circular letter particularly, and in the letter of January 12,\r\n1769, sent to the Assembly's agent in England, Mr. Dennys De Berdt,\r\nMr. Adams formulated a theory designed to show that the colonies\r\nwere \"subordinate\" but not subject to the British Parliament. The\r\ndelimitation of colonial and parliamentary jurisdictions Mr. Adams\r\nachieved by subordinating all legislative authority to an authority\r\nhigher than any positive law, an authority deriving its sanction from\r\nthe fixed and universal law of nature. This higher authority, which no\r\nlegislature could \"overleap without destroying its own foundation,\" was\r\nthe British Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams spoke of the British Constitution with immense confidence, as\r\nsomething singularly definite and well known, the provisions of which\r\nwere clearly ascertainable; which singular effect doubtless came from\r\nthe fact that he thought of it, not indeed as something written down\r\non paper and deposited in archives of state, but as a series of\r\npropositions which, as they were saying in France, were indelibly\r\n\"written in the hearts of all men.\" The British Constitution, he said,\r\nlike the constitution of every free state, \"is fixed,\" having its\r\nfoundation not in positive law, which would indeed give Parliament an\r\nultimate and therefore a despotic authority, but in \"the law of God\r\nand nature.\" There were in the British Empire many legislatures, all\r\nderiving their authority from, and all finding their limitations in,\r\nthe Constitution. Parliament had certainly a supreme or superintending\r\nlegislative authority in the Empire, as the colonial assemblies had\r\na \"subordinate,\" in the sense of a local, legislative authority; but\r\nneither the Parliament nor any colonial assembly could \"overleap the\r\nConstitution without destroying its own foundation.\" And therefore,\r\nsince the Constitution is founded \"in the law of God and nature,\" and\r\nsince \"it is an essential natural right that a man shall quietly enjoy\r\nand have the sole disposal of his property,\" the Americans must enjoy\r\nthis right equally with Englishmen, and Parliament must be bound to\r\nrespect this right in the colonies as well as in England; from which it\r\nfollowed irresistibly that the consent of the colonies to any taxation\r\nmust be sought exclusively in their own assemblies, it being manifestly\r\nimpossible for that consent to be \"constitutionally had in Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIt was commonly thought in America that Mr. Adams, although not a judge,\r\nhad a singular gift for constitutional interpretation. Far-sighted men\r\ncould nevertheless believe that a powerful party in England, inspired by\r\ninveterate hatred of America and irretrievably bent upon her ruin, would\r\npronounce all his careful distinctions ridiculous and would still reply\r\nto every argument by the mere assertion, as a fact behind which one\r\ncould not go, that Parliament had always had and must therefore still\r\nhave full power to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever. If Britain\r\nwould not budge from this position, Americans would soon be confronted\r\nwith the alternative of admitting Parliament to have full power or\r\ndenying it to have any.\r\n\r\nWith that sharp-set alternative in prospect, it would be well to keep in\r\nmind the fact that arguments lost carrying power in proportion to their\r\nsubtlety; and in the opinion of so good a judge as Benjamin Franklin the\r\nreasoning of Mr. Adams and Mr. Dickinson was perhaps not free from this\r\ngrave disadvantage.\r\n\r\nI am not yet master [he was free to confess] of the idea these ...\r\nwriters have of the relation between Britain and her colonies. I know\r\nnot what the Boston people mean by the \"subordination\" they acknowledge\r\nin their Assembly to Parliament, while they deny its power to make laws\r\nfor them, nor what bounds the Farmer sets to the power he acknowledges\r\nin Parliament to \"regulate the trade of the colonies,\" it being\r\ndifficult to draw lines between duties for regulation and those for\r\nrevenue; and, if the Parliament is to be the judge, it seems to me that\r\nestablishing such a principle of distinction will amount to little.\r\nThe more I have thought and read on the subject, the more I find myself\r\nconfirmed in opinion, that no middle ground can be well maintained, I\r\nmean not clearly with intelligible arguments. Something might be made of\r\neither of the extremes: that Parliament has a power to make all laws\r\nfor us, or that it has a power to make no laws for us; and I think the\r\narguments for the latter more numerous and weighty, than those for the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThe good Doctor had apparently read and thought a great deal about the\r\nmatter since the day when Mr. Grenville had called him in to learn if\r\nthere were good objections to be urged against the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nPractical men were meanwhile willing to allow the argument to take\r\nwhatever direction the exigencies of the situation might require, being\r\nready to believe that Mr. Dickinson counseled well and that Mr. Franklin\r\ncounseled well; being nevertheless firmly convinced from past experience\r\nthat an Englishman's ability to see reason was never great except when\r\nhis pocket was touched. Practical men were therefore generally of the\r\nopinion that they could best demonstrate their rights by exhibiting\r\ntheir power. This happily, they could do by bringing pressure to bear\r\nupon English merchants by taking money out of their pockets--without\r\ntheir consent to be sure but in a manner strictly legal--by means of\r\nnon-importation agreements voluntarily entered into.\r\n\r\nAs early as October, 1767, the Boston merchants entered into such an\r\nagreement, which was however not very drastic and proved to be of no\r\neffect, as it was at first unsupported by the merchants in any other\r\ncolony. In April, 1768, the merchants of New York, seeing the necessity\r\nof concerted action, agreed not to import \"any goods [save a very few\r\nenumerated articles] which shall be shipped from Great Britain after the\r\nfirst of October next; provided Boston and Philadelphia adopt similar\r\nmeasures by the first of June.\" Philadelphia merchants said they were\r\nnot opposed to the principle of non-importation, but greatly feared the\r\nNew York plan would serve to create a monopoly by enabling men of means\r\nto lay in a large stock of goods before the agreement went into effect.\r\nThis was very true; but the objection, if it was an objection, proved\r\nnot to be an insurmountable one. Before the year was out, in the late\r\nsummer for the most part, the merchants in all the commercial towns had\r\nsubscribed to agreements, differing somewhat in detail, of which the\r\nsubstance was that they would neither import from Great Britain any\r\ncommodities, nor buy or sell any which might inadvertently find their\r\nway in, until the duties imposed by the Townshend act should have been\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nThe merchants' agreements were, for whatever reason, much better\r\nobserved in some places than in others. Imports from Great Britain to\r\nNew York fell during the year 1769 from about £482,000 to about £74,000.\r\nImports into New England and into Pennsylvania declined a little more\r\nthan one half; whereas in the southern colonies there was no decline at\r\nall, but on the contrary an increase, slight in the case of Maryland\r\nand Virginia and rather marked in the Carolinas. In spite of these\r\ndefections, the experiment was not without effect upon English\r\nmerchants. English merchants, but little interested in the decline or\r\nincrease of trade to particular colonies, were chiefly aware that the\r\ntotal exportation to America was nearly a million pounds less in 1769\r\nthan in 1768. Understanding little about colonial rights, but knowing\r\nonly, as in 1766, that their \"trade was hurt,\" they accordingly applied\r\nonce more to Parliament for relief. The commerce with America which was\r\n\"so essential to afford employment and subsistence to the manufactures\r\nof these kingdoms, to augment the public revenue, to serve as a nursery\r\nfor seamen, and to increase our navigation and maritime strength\"--this\r\ncommerce, said the Merchants and Traders of the City of London Trading\r\nto America, \"is at present in an alarming state of suspension\"; and\r\nthe Merchants and Traders of the City of London therefore humbly\r\nprayed Parliament to repeal the duties which were the occasion of their\r\ninconveniences.\r\n\r\nThe petition of the London merchants came before the House on March 5,\r\n1770, that being the day fixed by Lord North for proposing, on behalf\r\nof the ministry, certain measures for America. No one, said the first\r\nminister, could be more free than himself to recognize the importance\r\nof American trade or more disposed to meet the wishes of the London\r\nmerchants as far as possible. The inconveniences under which that trade\r\nnow labored were manifest, but he could not think, with the petitioners,\r\nthat these inconveniences arose from \"the nature of the duties\" so much\r\nas \"through the medium of the dissatisfaction of the Americans,\r\nand those combinations and associations of which we have\r\nheard\"--associations and combinations which had been called, in an\r\naddress to the House, \"unwarrantable,\" but which he for his part would\r\ngo so far as to call illegal. These illegal combinations in America\r\nwere obviously what caused the inconveniences of which the merchants\r\ncomplained. To the pressure of illegal combinations alone Parliament\r\nought never to yield; and ministers wished it clearly understood that,\r\nif they were about to propose a repeal of some of the duties, they were\r\nnot led to take this step from any consideration of the disturbances in\r\nthe colonies.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the duties which it was now proposed to repeal--the\r\nduties on lead, glass, and paper--were to be repealed strictly on\r\nthe ground that they ought never to have been laid, because duties on\r\nBritish manufactures were contrary to true commercial principles. Last\r\nyear, when ministers had expressed, in a letter of Lord Hillsborough to\r\nthe governors, their intention to repeal these duties, some members had\r\nbeen in favor of repealing all the duties and some were still in favor\r\nof doing so. As to that, the first minister could only say that he had\r\nnot formerly been opposed to it and would not now be opposed to it,\r\nhad the Americans, in response to the Earl of Hillsborough's letter,\r\nexhibited any disposition to cease their illegal disturbances or\r\nrenounce their combinations. But the fact was that conditions in America\r\nhad grown steadily worse since the Earl of Hillsborough's letter, and\r\nnever had been so bad as now; in view of which fact ministers could not\r\nbut think it wise to maintain some tax as a matter of principle purely.\r\nThey would therefore recommend that the tax on tea, no burden certainly\r\non anyone, be continued as a concrete application of the right of\r\nParliament to tax the colonies.\r\n\r\nIn so far as they were designed to bring pressure to bear upon the\r\nmother country, the merchants' agreements were clearly not without a\r\nmeasure of success, having helped perhaps to bring Parliament to the\r\npoint of repealing the duties on lead, glass, and paper, as well as\r\nto bring ministers to the point of keeping the duty on tea. Americans\r\ngenerally were doubtless well pleased with this effect; but not all\r\nAmericans were able to regard the experiment in non-importation with\r\nunqualified approval in other respects. Non-importation, by diminishing\r\nthe quantity and increasing the price of commodities, involved a certain\r\namount of personal sacrifice. This sacrifice, however, fell chiefly on\r\nthe consumers, the non-importation not being under certain circumstances\r\naltogether without advantage to merchants who faithfully observed their\r\npledges as well as to those who observed them only occasionally. So long\r\nas their warehouses, well stocked in advance, contained anything that\r\ncould be sold at a higher price than formerly, non-importation was no\r\nbad thing even for those merchants who observed the agreement. For those\r\nwho did not observe the agreement, as well as for those who engaged in\r\nthe smuggling trade from Holland, it was no bad thing at any time,\r\nand it promised to become an increasingly excellent thing in exact\r\nproportion to the exhaustion of the fair trader's stock and the\r\nconsequent advance in prices. As time passed, therefore, the fair\r\ntrader became aware that the non-importation experiment, practically\r\nconsidered, was open to certain objections; whereas the unfair trader\r\nwas more in favor of the experiment the longer it endured, being every\r\nday more convinced that the non-importation agreement ought to be\r\ncontinued and strictly adhered to as essential to the maintenance of\r\nAmerican liberties.\r\n\r\nThe practical defects of non-importation were likely to be understood,\r\nby those who could ever understand them, in proportion to the decay of\r\nbusiness; and in the spring of 1770 they were nowhere better understood\r\nthan in New York, where the decay of business was most marked. This\r\ndecrease was greatest in New York, so the merchants maintained, because\r\nthat city had been most faithful in observing the agreement, importation\r\nhaving there fallen from £482,000 to £74,000 during the year. It is\r\npossible, however, that the decay of business in New York was due in\r\npart and perhaps primarily to the retirement, in November, 1768, of the\r\nlast issues of the old Bills of Credit, according to the terms of\r\nthe Paper Currency Act passed by Parliament during Mr. Grenville's\r\nadministration. As a result of this retirement of all the paper money in\r\nthe province, money of any sort was exceedingly scarce during the\r\nyears 1769 and 1770. Lyon dollars were rarely seen; and the quantity\r\nof Spanish silver brought into the colony through the trade with the\r\nforeign islands, formerly considerable but now greatly diminished by the\r\nstricter enforcement of the Townshend Trade Acts, was hardly sufficient\r\nfor local exchange alone, to say nothing of settling heavy balances in\r\nLondon, although, fortunately perhaps, there were in the year 1769\r\nno heavy London balances to be settled on account of the faithful\r\nobservance of the non-importation agreement by the merchants. The lack\r\nof money was therefore doubtless a chief cause of the great decay\r\nof business in New York; and some there were who maintained that the\r\nfaithful observance of the non-importation agreement by the merchants\r\nwas due to the decay of trade rather than the decay of trade being due\r\nto the faithful observance of the non-importation agreement.\r\n\r\nWhatever the true explanation of this academic point might be, it was an\r\nundoubted fact that business was more nearly at a standstill in New\r\nYork than elsewhere. Accordingly, in the spring of 1770, when money was\r\nrarely to be seen and debtors were selling their property at one-half\r\nor one-third of its former value in order to discharge obligations long\r\noverdue, the fair trading merchants of New York were not disposed to\r\ncontinue an experiment of which, as they said, they had borne the chief\r\nburden to the advantage of others and to their own impending ruin.\r\nZealous Sons of Liberty, such as Alexander MacDougall and John Lamb,\r\npopular leaders of the \"Inhabitants\" of the city, were on the other\r\nhand determined that the non-importation agreement should be maintained\r\nunimpaired. The hard times, they said, were due chiefly to the monopoly\r\nprices exacted by the wealthy merchants, who were not ruined at all, who\r\nhad on the contrary made a good thing out of the non-importation as long\r\nas they had anything to sell, and whose patriotism (God save the mark!)\r\nhad now suddenly grown lukewarm only because they had disposed of all\r\ntheir goods, including \"old moth-eaten clothes that had been rotting in\r\nthe shops for years.\"\r\n\r\nThese aspersions the merchants knew how to ignore. Their determination\r\nnot to continue the non-importation was nevertheless sufficiently\r\nindicated in connection with the annual celebration, in March, of the\r\nrepeal of the Stamp Act. On this occasion the merchants refused to meet\r\nas formerly with the Sons of Liberty, but made provision for a dinner of\r\ntheir own at another place, where all the Friends of Liberty and Trade\r\nwere invited to be present. Both dinners were well attended, and at both\r\nthe repeal of the Stamp Act was celebrated with patriotic enthusiasm,\r\nthe main difference being that whereas the Sons of Liberty drank a toast\r\nto Mr. MacDougall and to \"a continuance of the non-importation agreement\r\nuntil the revenue acts are repealed,\" the Friends of Liberty and Trade\r\nignored Mr. MacDougall and drank to \"trade and navigation and a speedy\r\nremoval of their embarrassments.\"\r\n\r\nIn the determination not to continue the old agreement, the Friends of\r\nLiberty and Trade were meanwhile strongly confirmed when it was learned\r\nthat Britain was willing on her part to make concessions. By the middle\r\nof May it was known that the Townshend duties (except the duty on tea)\r\nhad been repealed; and in June it was learned that Parliament had at\r\nlast, after many representations from the Assembly, passed a special act\r\npermitting New York to issue £120,000 in Bills of Credit receivable\r\nat the Treasury. It was thought that concession on the part of Great\r\nBritain ought in justice to meet with concession on the part of America.\r\nAccordingly, on the ground that other towns, and Boston in particular,\r\nwere more active \"in resolving what they ought to do than in doing what\r\nthey had resolved,\" and on the ground that the present non-importation\r\nagreement no longer served \"any other purpose than tying the hands of\r\nhonest men, to let rogues, smugglers, and men of no character plunder\r\ntheir country,\" the New York merchants, on July 9, 1770, resolved\r\nthat for the future they would import from Great Britain all kinds\r\nof commodities except such as might be subject to duties imposed by\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe New York merchants were on every hand loudly denounced for having\r\nbetrayed the cause of liberty; but before the year was out the old\r\nagreement was everywhere set aside. Yet everywhere, as at New York, the\r\nmerchants bound themselves not to import any British teas. The duty\r\non British teas was slight. Americans might have paid the duty without\r\nincreasing the price of their much prized luxury; ministers might have\r\ncollected the same duty in England to the advantage of the Exchequer.\r\nThat Britain should have insisted on this peppercorn in acknowledgement\r\nof her right, that America should have refused it in vindication of her\r\nliberty, may be taken as a high tribute from two eminently practical\r\npeoples to the power of abstract ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V A LITTLE DISCREET CONDUCT\r\n\r\nIt has been his [Thomas Hutchinson's] principle from a boy that mankind\r\nare to be governed by the discerning few, and it has been ever since his\r\nambition to be the hero of the few.--Samuel Adams.\r\n\r\nWe have not been so quiet these five years.... If it were not for two or\r\nthree Adamses, we should do well enough.--Thomas Hutchinson.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1771, Horace Walpole, a persistent if not an infallible\r\npolitical prophet, was of opinion that all the storms that for a decade\r\nhad distressed the Empire were at last happily blown over; among which\r\nstorms he included, as relatively of minor importance, the disputes with\r\nthe colonies. During two years following, this prediction might well\r\nhave appeared to moderate minded men entirely justified. American\r\naffairs were barely mentioned in Parliament, and a few paragraphs in the\r\nAnnual Register were thought sufficient to chronicle for English readers\r\nevents of interest occurring across the Atlantic. In the colonies\r\nthemselves an unwonted tranquillity prevailed. Rioting, as an\r\nestablished social custom, disappeared in most of the places where it\r\nhad formerly been so much practised. The Sons of Liberty, retaining the\r\nsemblance of an organization, were rarely in the public eye save at\r\nthe annual celebrations of the repeal of the Stamp Act, quite harmless\r\noccasions devoted to the expression of patriotic sentiments. Merchants\r\nand landowners, again prosperous, were content to fall back into\r\naccustomed habits of life, conscious of duty done without too much\r\nstress, readily believing their liberties finally vindicated against\r\nencroachments from abroad and their privileges secure against\r\nunwarranted and dangerous pretensions at home. \"The people appear to be\r\nweary of their altercations with the mother country,\" Mr. Johnson, the\r\nConnecticut agent, wrote to Wedderburn, in October, 1771; \"a little\r\ndiscreet conduct on both sides would perfectly reëstablish that warm\r\naffection and respect towards Great Britain for which this country was\r\nonce remarkable.\"\r\n\r\nDiscreet conduct was nowhere more necessary than in Massachusetts, where\r\nthe people, perhaps because they were much accustomed to them, grew\r\nweary of altercations less easily than in most colonies. Yet even in\r\nMassachusetts there was a marked waning of enthusiasm after the high\r\nexcitement occasioned by the Boston Massacre, a certain disintegration\r\nof the patriot party. James Otis recovered from a temporary fit of\r\ninsanity only to grow strangely suspicious of Samuel Adams. Mr. Hancock,\r\ndiscreetly holding his peace, attended to his many thriving and very\r\nprofitable business ventures. John Adams, somewhat unpopular for having\r\ndefended and procured the acquittal of the soldiers implicated in the\r\nMassacre, retired in high dudgeon from public affairs to the practice\r\nof his profession; in high dudgeon with everyone concerned--with himself\r\nfirst of all, and with the people who so easily forgot their interests\r\nand those who had served them, and with the British Government and all\r\nfawning tools of ministers, of whom Mr. Thomas Hutchinson was chief.\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Hutchinson, so roughly handled in the secret diary of the\r\nrising young lawyer, was the recipient of new honors, having been made\r\nGovernor of the province to succeed Francis Bernard. For once finding\r\nhimself almost popular, he thought he perceived a disposition in all\r\nthe colonies, and even in Massachusetts, to let the controversy subside.\r\n\"Though there are a small majority sour enough, yet when they seek\r\nmatter for protests, remonstrances, they are puzzled where to charge\r\nthe grievances which they look for.\" The new Governor looked forward to\r\nhappier days and an easy administration. \"Hancock and most of the party\r\nare quiet,\" he said, \"and all of them, except Adams, abate of their\r\nvirulence. Adams would push the Continent into a rebellion tomorrow, if\r\nit was in his power.\"\r\n\r\nNo one, in the year 1770, was better fitted than Samuel Adams, either by\r\ntalent and temperament or the circumstances of his position, to push the\r\ncontinent into a rebellion. Unlike most of his patriot friends, he had\r\nneither private business nor private profession to fall back upon when\r\npublic affairs grew tame, his only business being, as one might say,\r\nthe public business, his only profession the definition and defense of\r\npopular rights. In this profession, by dint of single-minded devotion\r\nto it through a course of years, he had indeed become wonderfully expert\r\nand had already achieved for himself the enviable position of known and\r\nnamed leader in every movement of opposition to royal or magisterial\r\nprerogative. In this connection no exploit had brought him so much\r\ndistinction as his skillful management of the popular uprising which had\r\nrecently forced Governor Hutchinson to withdraw the troops from Boston.\r\nThe event was no by-play in the life of Samuel Adams, no amateur\r\nachievement accomplished on the side, but the serious business of a man\r\nwho during ten years had abandoned all private pursuits and had embraced\r\npoverty to become a tribune of the people.\r\n\r\nSamuel Adams had not inherited poverty nor had he, after all, exactly\r\nembraced it, but had as it were naturally drifted into it through\r\nindifference to worldly gain, the indifference which men of single and\r\nfixed purpose have for all irrelevant matters. The elder Samuel Adams\r\nwas a merchant of substance and of such consequence in the town of\r\nBoston that in Harvard College, where students were named according to\r\nthe prominence of their families, his son's name was fifth in a class\r\nof twenty-two. In 1748, upon the death of his father, Samuel Junior\r\naccordingly inherited a very decent property, considered so at least\r\nin that day--a spacious old house in Purchase Street together with a\r\nwell-established malt business. For business, however, the young man,\r\nand not so young either, was without any aptitude whatever, being\r\nentirely devoid of the acquisitive instinct and neither possessing nor\r\never being able to acquire any skill in the fine art of inducing people\r\nto give for things more than it cost to make them. These deficiencies\r\nthe younger Adams had already exhibited before the death of his father,\r\nfrom whom he received on one occasion a thousand pounds, half of which\r\nhe promptly loaned to an impecunious friend, and which he would in any\r\ncase doubtless have lost, as he soon did the other half, on his own\r\naccount. In such incompetent hands the malt business soon fell to be a\r\nliability rather than an asset. Other liabilities accumulated, notably\r\none incurred by the tax collectors of the town of Boston, of whom Samuel\r\nAdams was one during the years from 1756 to 1764. For one reason or\r\nanother, on Adams's part certainly on account of his humane feelings and\r\ngeneral business inefficiency, the collectors fell every year a little\r\nbehind in the collections, and one day found themselves declared on the\r\nofficial records to be indebted to the town in the sum of £9,878.\r\nThis indebtedness Mr. Hutchinson and other gentlemen not well disposed\r\ntowards Samuel Adams conveniently and frequently referred to in later\r\nyears as a \"defalcation.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year of 1764, when he had lost his entire patrimony except the\r\nold house in Purchase Street, now somewhat rusty for want of repair,\r\nSamuel Adams was married to Elizabeth Wells. It was his second marriage,\r\nthe first having taken place in 1749, of which the fruit was a son and\r\na daughter. Samuel Adams was then--it was the year of the Sugar\r\nAct--forty-two years old; that is to say, at the age when a man's hair\r\nbegins to turn gray, when his character is fixed, when his powers, such\r\nas they are, are fully matured; well known as a \"poor provider,\" an\r\nimprovident man who had lost a fair estate, had failed in business, and\r\nwas barely able, and sometimes not able, to support his small family.\r\nThese mundane matters concerned Samuel Adams but little. To John Adams\r\nhe said on one occasion that \"he never looked forward in life; never\r\nplanned, laid a scheme, or formed a design for laying up anything for\r\nhimself or others after him.\" This was the truth, inexplicable as it\r\nmust have seemed to his more provident cousin. It was even less than\r\nthe truth: during the years following 1764, Samuel Adams renounced all\r\npretense of private business, giving himself wholly to public affairs,\r\nwhile his good wife, with excellent management, made his stipend\r\nas clerk of the Assembly serve for food, and obtained, through the\r\ngenerosity of friends or her own ingenious labors, indispensable clothes\r\nfor the family. Frugality, that much lauded virtue in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, needed not to be preached in the old Purchase Street home;\r\nbut life went on there, somehow or other, decently enough, not without\r\ngeniality yet with evident piety. The old Bible is still preserved from\r\nwhich each evening some member of the family read a chapter, and at\r\nevery meal the head of the house said grace, returning thanks for God's\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nIf Samuel Adams at the age of forty-two was known for a man who could\r\nnot successfully manage his own affairs, he was also known, and very\r\nwell known, for a man with a singular talent for managing the affairs of\r\nthe community; he could manage successfully, for example, town meetings\r\nand every sort of business, great or small, incidental to local\r\npolitics. This talent he may have inherited from his father, who was\r\nhimself a notable of the neighborhood--one of the organizers of the \"New\r\nSouth\" church, and prominent about 1724 in a club popularly known as\r\nthe \"Caulkers' Club,\" formed for the purpose of laying \"plans for\r\nintroducing certain persons into places of trust and power,\" and was\r\nhimself from time to time introduced into such places of trust and power\r\nas justice of the peace, deacon, selectman, and member of the provincial\r\nassembly. From an early age, the younger Samuel exhibited a marked\r\naptitude for this sort of activity, and was less likely to be found\r\n\"in his counting-house a-counting of his money\" than in some hospitable\r\ntavern or back shop discussing town topics with local worthies. Samuel\r\nAdams was born to serve on committees. He had the innate slant of\r\nmind that properly belongs to a moderator of mass meetings called to\r\naggravate a crisis. With the soul of a Jacobin, he was most at home in\r\nclubs, secret clubs of which everyone had heard and few were members,\r\ndesigned at best to accomplish some particular good for the people, at\r\nall events meeting regularly to sniff the approach of tyranny in the\r\nabstract, academically safeguarding the commonwealth by discussing the\r\nfirst principles of government.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Anne Hutchinson, Boston never lacked clubs; and the\r\nCaulkers' Club was the prototype of many, rather more secular and\r\npolitical than religious or transcendental, which flourished in the\r\nyears preceding the Revolution. John Adams, in that Diary which tells us\r\nso much that we wish to know, gives us a peep inside one of these clubs,\r\nthe \"Caucus Club,\" which met regularly at one period in the garret of\r\nTom Dawes's house. \"There they smoke tobacco till you cannot see from\r\none end of the garret to the other. There they drink flip, I suppose,\r\nand there they choose a moderator who puts questions to the vote\r\nregularly; and selectmen, assessors, collectors, wardens, fire-wards,\r\nand representatives are regularly chosen before they are chosen in\r\nthe town. Uncle Fairfield, Story, Ruddock, Adams, Cooper, and a rudis\r\nindigestaque moles of others are members. They send committees to wait\r\non the merchants' club, and to propose and join in the choice of men\r\nand measures.\" The artist Copley, in the familiar portrait by which\r\nposterity knows Samuel Adams, chose to represent him in conventional\r\ngarb, on a public and dramatic occasion, standing erect, eyes flashing\r\nand mouth firm-set, pointing with admonitory finger to the Charter of\r\nMassachusetts Bay--a portrait well suited to hang in the Art Museum or\r\nin the meeting place of the Daughters of the Revolution. A different\r\neffect would have been produced if the man had been placed in Tom\r\nDawes's garret, dimly seen through tobacco smoke, sitting, with coat\r\noff, drinking flip, in the midst of Uncle Fairfield, Story, Cooper, and\r\na rudis indigestaque moles. This was his native habitat, an environment\r\nprecisely suited to his peculiar talent.\r\n\r\nSamuel Adams had a peculiar talent, that indispensable combination of\r\nqualities possessed by all great revolutionists of the crusading type,\r\nsuch as Jean Jacques Rousseau, John Brown, or Mazzini. When a man\r\nabandons his business or job and complacently leaves the clothing of his\r\nchildren to wife or neighbors in order to drink flip and talk politics,\r\nordinary folk are content to call him a lazy lout, ne'er-do-well,\r\nworthless fellow, or scamp. Samuel Adams was not a scamp. He might have\r\nbeen no more than a ne'er-do-well, perhaps, if cosmic forces had not\r\nopportunely provided him with an occupation which his contemporaries and\r\nposterity could regard as a high service to humanity. In his own eyes,\r\nthis was the view of the situation which justified his conduct. When\r\nhe was about to depart for the first Continental Congress, a number of\r\nfriends contributed funds to furnish him forthwith presentable apparel:\r\na suit of clothes, new wig, new hat, \"six pair of the best silk hose,\r\nsix pair of fine thread ditto, ... six pair of shoes\"; and, it being\r\n\"modestly inquired of him whether his finances were not rather low than\r\notherwise, he replied it was true that was the case, but he was very\r\nindifferent about these matters, so that his poor abilities were of any\r\nservice to the public; upon which the gentleman obliged him to accept\r\na purse containing about fifteen or twenty Johannes.\" To accept so much\r\nand still preserve one's self-respect would be impossible to ordinary\r\nmen under ordinary circumstances. Fate had so ordered the affairs\r\nof Samuel Adams that integrity of character required him to be an\r\nextraordinary man acting under extraordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe character of his mind, as well as the outward circumstances of\r\nhis life, predisposed Samuel Adams to think that a great crisis in the\r\nhistory of America and of the world confronted the men of Boston. There\r\nwas in him some innate scholastic quality, some strain of doctrinaire\r\nPuritan inheritance diverted to secular interests, that gave direction\r\nto all his thinking. In 1743, upon receiving the degree of Master of\r\nArts from Harvard College, he argued the thesis, \"Whether it be lawful\r\nto resist the Supreme Magistrate, if the Commonwealth cannot otherwise\r\nbe preserved.\" We may suppose that the young man acquitted himself\r\nwell, reasoning with great nicety in favor of the legality of an illegal\r\naction, doubtless to the edification of Governor Shirley, who was\r\npresent and who perhaps felt sufficiently remote from the performance,\r\nbeing himself only an actual supreme magistrate presiding over a real\r\ncommonwealth. And indeed for most young men a college thesis is but an\r\nexercise for sharpening the wits, rarely dangerous in its later\r\neffects. But in the case of Samuel Adams, the ability to distinguish\r\nthe speculative from the actual reality seemed to diminish as the years\r\npassed. After 1764, relieved of the pressure of life's anxieties\r\nand daily nourishing his mind on premises and conclusions reasonably\r\nabstracted from the relative and the conditioned circumstance, he\r\nacquired in a high degree the faculty of identifying reality with\r\npropositions about it; so that, for example, Liberty seemed threatened\r\nif improperly defined, and a false inference from an axiom of politics\r\nappeared the same as evil intent to take away a people's rights. Thus it\r\nwas that from an early date, in respect to the controversy between\r\nthe colonies and the mother country, Samuel Adams became possessed of\r\nsettled convictions that were capable of clear and concise presentation\r\nand that were at once impersonal and highly subjective, for which\r\noutward events--the Stamp Act, the Townshend duties, the appointment\r\nof Thomas Hutchinson as Governor, or whatever--furnished as it were the\r\nsuggestion only, the convictions themselves being largely the result of\r\ninward brooding, the finespun product of his own ratiocinative mind.\r\n\r\nThe crisis which thus threatened--in the mind of Samuel Adams--was\r\nnot an ordinary one: no mere complication of affairs, or creaking\r\nof worn-out institutions, or honest difference of opinion about the\r\nexpediency or the legality of measures. It was a crisis engendered\r\ndeliberately by men of evil purpose, public enemies well known and often\r\nnamed. Samuel Adams, who had perhaps not heard of even one of the many\r\nmaterialistic interpretations of history, thought of the past as chiefly\r\ninstructive in connection with certain great epochal conflicts between\r\nLiberty and Tyranny--a political Manicheanism, in which the principle of\r\nLiberty was embodied in the virtuous many and the principle of Tyranny\r\nin the wicked few. Those who read history must know it for a notorious\r\nfact that ancient peoples had lost their liberties at the hands of\r\ndesigning men, leagued and self-conscious conspirators against the\r\nwelfare of the human race. Thus the yoke was fastened upon the Romans,\r\n\"millions ... enslaved by a few.\" Now, in the year 1771, another of\r\nthese epochal conflicts was come upon the world, and Samuel Adams,\r\nliving in heroic days, was bound to stand in the forefront of the\r\nvirtuous against \"restless Adversaries ... forming the most dangerous\r\nPlans for the Ruin of the Reputation of the People, in order to build\r\ntheir own Greatness upon the Destruction of their liberties.\"\r\n\r\nA superficial observer might easily fall into the error of supposing\r\nthat the restless adversaries and designing conspirators against whom\r\npatriots had to contend were all in England; on the contrary, the most\r\npersistent enemies of Liberty were Americans residing in the midst\r\nof the people whom they sought to despoil. One might believe that in\r\nEngland \"the general inclination is to wish that we may preserve our\r\nliberties; and perhaps even the ministry could for some reasons find it\r\nin their hearts to be willing that we should be restored to the state\r\nwe were in before the passing of the Stamp Act.\" Even Lord Hillsborough,\r\nrichly meriting the \"curses of the disinterested and better part of\r\nthe colonists,\" was by no means \"to be reckoned the most inveterate and\r\nactive of all the Conspirators against our rights. There are others on\r\nthis side of the Atlantick who have been more insidious in plotting\r\nthe Ruin of our Liberties than even he, and they are the more infamous,\r\nbecause the country they would enslave, is that very Country in which\r\n(to use the words of their Adulators and Expectants) they were 'born and\r\neducated.'\" Of all these restless adversaries and infamous plotters of\r\nruin, the chief, in the mind of Samuel Adams, was probably Mr. Thomas\r\nHutchinson.\r\n\r\nJudged only by what he did and said and by such other sources of\r\ninformation as are open to the historian, Thomas Hutchinson does not\r\nappear to have been, prior to 1771, an Enemy of the Human Race. One of\r\nhis ancestors, Mistress Anne Hutchinson, poor woman, had indeed been--it\r\nwas as far back as 1637--an enemy of the Boston Church; but as a family\r\nthe Hutchinsons appear to have kept themselves singularly free from\r\nnotoriety or other grave reproach. Thomas Hutchinson himself was born\r\nin 1711 in Garden Court Street, Boston, of rich but honest parents, a\r\ndifficult character which he managed for many years to maintain with\r\nreasonable credit. In 1771, he was a grave, elderly man of sixty years,\r\nmore distinguished than any of his forebears had been, having since\r\nthe age of twenty-six been honored with every important elective and\r\nappointive office in the province, including that of governor, which\r\nhe had with seeming reluctance just accepted. It may be that Thomas\r\nHutchinson was ambitious; but if he elbowed his way into office by\r\nsolicitation or by the mean arts of an intriguer the fact was well\r\nconcealed. He was not a member of the \"Caulkers' Club.\" So far as is\r\nknown, he was not a member of any club designed \"to introduce certain\r\npersons into places of trust and power\"; except indeed of the club,\r\nif one may call it such, composed of the \"best families,\" closely\r\ninterrelated by marriage and social intercourse, mostly wealthy,\r\nenjoying the leisure and the disposition to occupy themselves with\r\naffairs, and commonly regarding themselves as forming a kind of natural\r\naristocracy whose vested duty it was to manage the commonwealth. To this\r\nclub Mr. Hutchinson belonged; and it was no doubt partly through its\r\ninfluence, without any need of solicitation on his part, that offices\r\nwere thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nOne morning in September, 1760--it was the day following the death of\r\nChief Justice Sewall--Mr. Hutchinson was stopped in the street by the\r\nfirst lawyer in the province, Jeremiah Gridley, who assured him that\r\nhe, Mr. Hutchinson, must be Mr. Sewall's successor; and it soon appeared\r\nthat other principal lawyers, together with the surviving judge of the\r\nSuperior Court, were of the same opinion as Mr. Gridley. Although the\r\nplace was an attractive one, Mr. Hutchinson distrusted his ability to\r\ndischarge competently the duties of a Chief Justice, since he had never\r\nhad any systematic training as a lawyer. Besides, as he was aware, James\r\nOtis, Sr., who desired the place and made no secret of the fact that he\r\nhad formerly been promised it by Governor Shirley, at once became active\r\nin pressing his claims upon the attention of Governor Bernard. In this\r\nsolicitation he was joined by his son, James Otis, Jr. Mr. Hutchinson,\r\non the contrary, refrained from all solicitation, so he tells us at\r\nleast, and even warned Governor Bernard that it would perhaps be wiser\r\nto avoid any trouble which the Otises might be disposed to make in\r\ncase they were disappointed. This line of conduct may have been only a\r\nshrewder form of solicitation, the proof of which, to some minds, would\r\nbe that Mr. Hutchinson was in fact appointed to be Chief Justice. This\r\nappointment was afterwards recalled as one of Mr. Hutchinson's\r\nmany offenses, although at the time it seems to have given general\r\nsatisfaction, especially to the lawyers.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers may well have been pleased, for the new Chief Justice was\r\na man whose outstanding abilities, even more than his place in society,\r\nmarked him for responsible position. Thomas Hutchinson possessed the\r\nefficient mind. No one surpassed him in wide and exact knowledge, always\r\nat command, of the history of the province, of its laws and customs, of\r\npast and present practice in respect to the procedure of administration.\r\nIndustrious and systematic in his habits of work, conscientious in the\r\nperformance of his duties down to the last jot and tittle of the law,\r\nhe was preëminently fitted for the neat and expeditious dispatch of\r\nofficial business; and his sane and trenchant mind, habituated by long\r\npractice to the easy mastery of details, was prompt to pass upon any\r\npractical matter, however complicated, an intelligent and just judgment.\r\nIt was doubtless thought, in an age when the law was not too highly\r\nspecialized to be understood by any but the indoctrinated, that\r\nthese traits would make him a good judge, as they had made him a good\r\ncouncilor. Not all people, it is true, are attracted by the efficient\r\nmind; and Mr. Hutchinson in the course of years had made enemies, among\r\nwhom were many who still thought of him as the man chiefly responsible\r\nfor the abolition, some eleven years before, of what was probably the\r\nmost vicious system of currency known to colonial America. Nevertheless,\r\nin the days before the passing of the Stamp Act, Mr. Hutchinson was\r\ncommonly well thought of, both for character and ability, and might\r\nstill without offense be mentioned as a useful and honored public\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchinson did not, at any time in his life, regard himself as\r\nan Enemy of the Human Race, or of America, or even of liberty rightly\r\nconsidered. Perhaps he had not the fine enthusiasm for the Human Race\r\nthat Herder or Jean Jacques Rousseau had; but at least he wished it\r\nwell; and to America, the country in which he was born and educated and\r\nin which he had always lived, he was profoundly attached. Of America he\r\nwas as proud as a cultivated and unbigoted man well could be, extremely\r\njealous of her good name abroad and prompt to stand, in any way that was\r\nappropriate and customary, in defense of her rights and liberties. To\r\nrights and liberties in general, and to those of America in particular,\r\nhe had given long and careful thought. It was perhaps characteristic\r\nof his practical mind to distinguish the word liberty from the various\r\nthings which it might conceivably represent, and to think that of these\r\nvarious things some were worth more than others, what any of them was\r\nworth being a relative matter depending largely upon circumstances.\r\nSpeaking generally, liberty in the abstract, apart from particular and\r\nknown conditions, was only a phrase, a brassy tinkle in Mr. Hutchinson's\r\near, meaning nothing unless it meant mere absence of all constraint.\r\nThe liberty which Mr. Hutchinson prized was not the same as freedom from\r\nconstraint. Not liberty in this sense, or in any sense, but the welfare\r\nof a people neatly ordered for them by good government, was what he took\r\nto be the chief end of politics; and from this conception it followed\r\nthat \"in a remove from a state of nature to the most perfect state of\r\ngovernment there must be a great restraint of natural liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe limitations proper to be placed upon natural liberty could scarcely\r\nbe determined by abstract speculation or with mathematical precision,\r\nbut would obviously vary according to the character and circumstances\r\nof a people, always keeping in mind the \"peace and good order\" of the\r\nparticular community as the prime object. In all such matters reasonable\r\nmen would seek enlightenment not in the Utopias of philosophers but in\r\nthe history of nations; and, taking a large view of history, the history\r\nmore particularly of the British Empire and of Massachusetts Bay,\r\nit seemed to Mr. Hutchinson, as it seemed to John Locke and to Baron\r\nMontesquieu, that a proper balance between liberty and authority had\r\nbeen very nearly attained in the British Constitution, as nearly\r\nperhaps as common human frailty would permit. The prevailing \"thirst\r\nfor liberty,\" which seemed to be \"the ruling passion of the age,\"\r\nMr. Hutchinson was therefore able to contemplate with much sanity and\r\ndetachment. \"In governments under arbitrary rule\" such a passion for\r\nliberty might, he admitted, \"have a salutary effect; but in governments\r\nin which as much freedom is enjoyed as can consist with the ends of\r\ngovernment, as was the case in this Province, it must work anarchy and\r\nconfusion unless there be some external power to restrain it.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1771, Thomas Hutchinson was perfectly convinced that this passion for\r\nliberty, during several years rising steadily in the heads of the most\r\nunstable part of the population, the most unstable \"both for character\r\nand estates,\" had brought Massachusetts Bay to a state not far removed\r\nfrom anarchy. Not that he was unaware of the mistakes of ministers. The\r\nmeasures of Mr. Grenville he had regarded as unwise from every point\r\nof view. In behalf of the traditional privileges of the\r\ncolonies--privileges which their conduct had well justified--and in\r\nbehalf of the welfare of the Empire, he had protested against these\r\nmeasures, as also later against the measures of Mr. Townshend; and of\r\nall these measures he still held the same opinion, that they were unwise\r\nmeasures. Nevertheless, Parliament had undoubtedly a legal right--other\r\nrights in the political sense, Mr. Hutchinson knew nothing of--to pass\r\nthem; and the passing of legal measures, however unwise, was not to his\r\nmind clear evidence of a conspiracy to establish absolute despotism\r\non the ruins of English liberty. Mr. Hutchinson was doubtless\r\ntemperamentally less inclined to fear tyranny than anarchy. Of the\r\ntwo evils, he doubtless preferred such oppression as might result from\r\nparliamentary taxation to any sort of liberty the attainment of which\r\nmight seem to require the looting of his ancestral mansion by a Boston\r\nmob. In 1771, at the time of his accession to the governorship, Mr.\r\nHutchinson was therefore of opinion that \"there must be an abridgment of\r\nwhat is called English liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe liberty Thomas Hutchinson enjoyed least and desired most to have\r\nabridged was the liberty of being governed, in that province where he\r\nhad formerly been happy in the competent discharge of official duties,\r\nby a self-constituted and illegal popular government intrenched in the\r\ntown of Boston. In a letter which he wrote in 1765 but did not send, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nIt will be some amusement to you to have a more circumstantial account\r\nof the model of government among us. I will begin with the lowest\r\nbranch, partly legislative, partly executive. This consists of the\r\nrabble of the town of Boston, headed by one Mackintosh, who, I imagine,\r\nyou never heard of. He is a bold fellow, and as likely for a Masaniello\r\nas you can well conceive. When there is occasion to burn or hang\r\neffigies or pull down houses, these are employed; but since government\r\nhas been brought to a system, they are somewhat controlled by a superior\r\nset consisting of the master-masons, and carpenters, &c., of the town of\r\nBoston. When anything of more importance is to be determined, as opening\r\nthe custom-house on any matter of trade, these are under the direction\r\nof a committee of the merchants, Mr. Rowe at their head, then Molyneaux,\r\nSoloman Davis, &c.: but all affairs of a general nature, opening of\r\nthe courts of law, &c., this is proper for a general meeting of the\r\ninhabitants of Boston, where Otis, with his mob-high eloquence, prevails\r\nin every motion, and the town first determine what is necessary to be\r\ndone, and then apply either to the Governor or Council, or resolve that\r\nit is necessary for the General Court to correct it; and it would be a\r\nvery extraordinary resolve indeed that is not carried into execution.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1765. In 1770, the matter had ceased to be amusing, for\r\nevery year the model government was brought to a greater perfection,\r\nso that at last the Town Meeting, prescriptively composed of certain\r\nqualified voters and confined to the determination of strictly local\r\nmatters, had not only usurped all the functions of government in the\r\nprovince, which was bad enough, but was completely under the thumb\r\nof every Tom, Dick, and Harry who might wish to attend, which was\r\nmanifestly still worse. \"There is a Town Meeting, no sort of regard\r\nbeing had to any qualification of voters, but all the inferior people\r\nmeet together; and at a late meeting the inhabitants of other towns who\r\nhappened to be in town, mixed with them, and made, they say themselves,\r\nnear 3000,--their newspapers say 4000, when it is not likely there are\r\n1500 legal voters in the town. It is in other words being under the\r\ngovernment of a mob. This has given the lower part of the people such a\r\nsense of their importance that a gentleman does not meet with what used\r\nto be common civility, and we are sinking into perfect barbarism....\r\nThe spirit of anarchy which prevails in Boston is more than I am able to\r\ncope with.\" The instigators of the mob, it was well known, were certain\r\nartful and self-seeking demagogues, of whom the chief had formerly been\r\nJames Otis; but in late years Mr. Otis, \"with his mob-high eloquence,\"\r\nhad given way to an abler man, Samuel Adams, than whom, Mr. Hutchinson\r\nthought, there was not \"a greater incendiary in the King's dominion,\r\nor a man of greater malignity of heart, [or one] who less scruples any\r\nmeasure however criminal to accomplish his purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter, undated and undirected, in which Thomas Hutchinson\r\npronounced this deliberate judgment on Samuel Adams, was probably\r\nwritten about the time of his accession to the Governorship; that is to\r\nsay, about the time when Mr. Johnson, the Connecticut Agent, was writing\r\nto Wedderburn that \"the people seem to grow weary of altercations,\" and\r\nthat \"a little discreet conduct on both sides\" would perfectly restore\r\ncordial relations between Britain and her colonies. In the way of \"a\r\nlittle discreet conduct,\" even a very little, not much was to be hoped\r\nfor from either Governor Hutchinson or Samuel Adams in their dealings\r\nwith each other. Unfortunately, they had dealings with each other:\r\nin the performance of official functions, their incommensurable and\r\nrepellent minds were necessarily brought to bear upon the same matters\r\nof public concern. Both, unfortunately, lived in Boston and were likely\r\nany day to come face to face round the corner of some or other narrow\r\nstreet of that small town. That reciprocal exasperation engendered by\r\nreasonable propinquity, so essential to the life of altercations, was\r\ntherefore a perpetual stimulus to both men, confirming each in his\r\nobstinate opinion of the other as a malicious and dangerous enemy of\r\nall that men hold dear. Thus it was that during the years 1771 and\r\n1772, when if ever it appeared that others were \"growing weary of\r\naltercations,\" these honorable men and trusted leaders did what they\r\ncould to perpetuate the controversy. By giving or taking occasion\r\nto recall ancient grudges or revive fruitless disputes, wittingly or\r\nunwittingly they together managed during this time of calm to keep the\r\ndying embers alive against the day when some rising wind might blow them\r\ninto devouring flames.\r\n\r\nWith Samuel Adams it was a point of principle to avoid discreet conduct\r\nas much as possible. In his opinion, the great crisis which was his\r\nsoul's abiding place, wherein he nourished his mind and fortified his\r\nwill, admitted of no compromise. Good will was of no avail in dealing\r\nwith the \"Conspirators against our Liberties,\" the very essence of whose\r\ntactics it was to assume the mask of benevolence, and so divide, and\r\nby dividing disarm, the people; \"flattering those who are pleased with\r\nflattery; forming connections with them, introducing Levity, Luxury, and\r\nIndolence, and assuring them that if they are quiet the Ministry will\r\nalter their Measures.\" During these years there was no power in the\r\ncourse of events or in the tongue of man to move him in the conviction\r\nthat \"if the Liberties of America are ever completely ruined, it will\r\nin all probability be the consequence of a mistaken notion of prudence,\r\nwhich leads men to acquiesce in measures of the most destructive\r\ntendency for the sake of present ease.\" Never, therefore, were \"the\r\npolitical affairs of America in a more dangerous state\" than when the\r\npeople had seemingly grown weary of altercations and Parliament could\r\nendure an entire session \"without one offensive measure.\" The chief\r\ndanger of all was that the people would think there was no danger.\r\nMillions could never be enslaved by a few \"if all possessed the\r\nindependent spirit of Brutus who to his immortal honor expelled the\r\nproud Tyrant of Rome.\" During the years of apathy and indifference\r\nSamuel Adams accordingly gave his days and nights, with undiminished\r\nenthusiasm and a more trenchant acerbity, to the task of making Brutuses\r\nof the men of Boston that the fate of Rome might not befall America.\r\n\r\nThey were assured in many an essay by this new Candidus that\r\n\r\nThe liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil constitution,\r\nare worth defending at all hazards: and it is our duty to defend them\r\nagainst all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from\r\nour worthy ancestors. They purchased them for us with toil and danger\r\nand expense of treasure and blood; and transmitted them to us with care\r\nand diligence. It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy upon the\r\npresent generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to\r\nbe wrested from us by violence without a struggle; or be cheated out of\r\nthem by the artifices of false and designing men. Of the latter we\r\nare in most danger at present. Let us therefore be aware of it. Let us\r\ncontemplate our forefathers and posterity; and resolve to maintain the\r\nrights bequeathed to us from the former, for the sake of the latter.\r\nInstead of sitting down satisfied with the efforts we have already made,\r\nwhich is the wish of our enemies, the necessity of the times, more than\r\never, calls for our utmost circumspection, deliberation, fortitude and\r\nperseverance. Let us remember that \"if we suffer tamely a lawless attack\r\nupon our liberty, we encourage it, and involve others in our doom!\" It\r\nis a very serious consideration, which should deeply impress our minds,\r\nthat millions yet unborn may be the miserable sharers in the event.\r\n\r\nThese were days when many a former Brutus seemed ready to betray the\r\ncause. Deserted by James Otis, whom he had supplanted, and by John\r\nHancock, whose great influence he had formerly exploited and whom he\r\nhad \"led about like an ape,\" as was currently reported, Samuel Adams\r\nsuffered a measure of eclipse. The Assembly would no longer do his\r\nbidding in respect to the vital question of whether the General Court\r\nmight be called by the Governor to meet outside of Boston; and it\r\neven imposed upon him, as one of a committee, the humiliating task of\r\npresenting an address to Mr. Hutchinson, acknowledging his right to\r\nremove the legislature to any place he liked--\"to Housatonic, in the\r\nwestern extreme of the province,\" if he thought fit. There was even\r\ngrave danger that the Governor would be satisfied with this concession\r\nand would recall the Court to sit in Boston. Boston was indeed the very\r\nplace where Samuel Adams wished to have it sit; but to attain a right\r\nend in a wrong manner would be to suffer a double defeat, losing at once\r\nthe point of principle and the grievance necessary for maintaining the\r\ncontention. Friends of the Government were much elated at the waning\r\ninfluence of the Chief Incendiary; and Mr. Sparhawk condescended to\r\nexpress a certain sympathy for their common enemy, now that he was so\r\nmuch diminished, \"harassed, dependent, in their power.\" It was indeed\r\nunder great difficulties, during these years when Massachusetts was\r\nalmost without annals, that Samuel Adams labored to make Brutuses of the\r\nmen of Boston.\r\n\r\nSo far deserted by his friends, Samuel Adams might never have succeeded\r\nin overcoming these difficulties without the assistance presently\r\nrendered by his enemies. Of those who were of invaluable aid to him in\r\nthis way, Thomas Hutchinson was one. The good Governor, having read his\r\ninstructions, knew what his duties were. One of them manifestly was to\r\nstand in defense of Government; and, when Government was every day being\r\nargumentatively attacked, to provide, as a counter-irritant, arguments\r\nin defense of Government. Imagining that facts determined conclusions\r\nand conclusions directed conduct, Mr. Hutchinson hoped to diminish the\r\ninfluence of Samuel Adams by showing that the latter's facts were wrong,\r\nand that his inferences, however logically deduced, were therefore not\r\nto be taken seriously. \"I have taken much pains,\" he says, \"to procure\r\nwriters to answer the pieces in the newspapers which do so much mischief\r\namong the people, and have two or three engaged with Draper, besides a\r\nnew press, and a young printer who says he will not be frightened, and I\r\nhope for some good effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor had read his instructions, but not the mind of Samuel\r\nAdams or the minds of the many men who, like the Chief Incendiary, were\r\nprepared \"to cultivate the sensations of freedom.\" Perhaps the only\r\n\"good effect\" of his \"pieces\" was to furnish excellent theses for Samuel\r\nAdams to dispute upon, which he did with unrivaled shrewdness each week\r\nin the Boston Gazette under the thin disguise of Candidus, Valerius\r\nPoplicola, or Vindex. To this last name, Vindex, Mr. Hutchinson thought\r\nthere might appropriately have been added another, such as Malignus\r\nor Invidus. And indeed of all these disputative essays, in the Boston\r\nGazette or in Mr. Draper's paper, one may say that the apparent aim was\r\nto win a dialectic victory and the obvious result to prove that ill will\r\nexisted by exhibiting it.\r\n\r\nThomas Hutchinson's faith in the value of disputation was not easily\r\ndisturbed; and after two years, when it appeared that his able\r\nlieutenants writing in Mr. Draper's newspaper were still as far as\r\never from bringing the controversy to a conclusion, he could no longer\r\nrefrain from trying his own practiced hand at an argument--which he did\r\nin a carefully prepared address to the General Court, delivered January\r\n6, 1773. \"I have pleased myself for several years,\" he said, \"with\r\nhopes that the cause [of the 'present disturbed and disordered state'\r\nof government] would cease of itself, and the effect with it, but I am\r\ndisappointed; and I may not any longer, consistent with my duty to\r\nthe King, and my regard to the interests of the province, delay\r\ncommunicating my sentiments to you upon a matter of so great\r\nimportance.\" The cause of their present difficulties Mr. Hutchinson\r\nthought as evident as the fact itself: a disturbed state of government\r\nhaving always followed, must have been caused by the denial of the\r\nauthority of Parliament to make laws binding the province. Upon a right\r\nresolution of this question everything depended.\r\n\r\nThe Governor accordingly confined himself to presenting, all in good\r\ntemper, a concise and remarkably well-articulated argument to prove that\r\n\"no line can be drawn between the supreme authority of Parliament\r\nand the total independence of the colonies\"; of which argument the\r\nconclusion must be, inasmuch as the total independence of the colonies\r\nwas not conceivably any one's thought, that supreme authority rested\r\nwith Parliament. This conclusion once admitted, it was reasonable\r\nto suppose that disturbances would cease; for \"if the supremacy of\r\nParliament shall no longer be denied, it will follow that the mere\r\nexercise of its authority can be no matter of grievance.\" In closing,\r\nhis Excellency expressed the desire, in case the two Houses did not\r\nagree with his exposition of the Constitution, to know their objections.\r\n\"They may be convincing to me, or I may be able to satisfy you of the\r\ninsufficiency of them. In either case, I hope we shall put an end to\r\nthose irregularities which ever will be the portion of a government\r\nwhere the supreme authority is controverted.\" In this roundabout way,\r\nGovernor Hutchinson finally reached as a conclusion the prepossession\r\nwith which he began; namely, that whereas a disturbed state of\r\ngovernment is, ex hypothesi, a vital evil, assertions or denials which\r\ntend to cause the evil must be unfounded.\r\n\r\nIt happened that both Houses, the lower House especially, remained\r\nunconvinced by the Governor's exposition of the Constitution; and both\r\nHouses took advantage of his invitation to present their objections.\r\nThe committee which the lower House appointed to formulate a reply found\r\ntheir task no slight one, not from any doubt that Mr. Hutchinson was in\r\nerror, but from the difficulty of constructing an argument that might be\r\nregarded as polemically adequate. At the request of Major Hawley,\r\nJohn Adams was accordingly \"invited, requested, and urged to meet the\r\ncommittee, which he did every evening till the report was finished.\"\r\nWhen the first draft of a reply, probably drawn by Dr. Joseph Warren,\r\nwas presented to Mr. Adams for his criticism, he \"modestly suggested to\r\nthem the expediency of leaving out many popular and eloquent periods,\r\nand of discussing the question with the Governor upon principles more\r\nespecially legal and constitutional,\" there being in this first\r\ndraft, so Mr. Adams thought, \"no answer, nor any attempt to answer the\r\nGovernor's legal and constitutional arguments, such as they were.\" And\r\nso, being \"very civilly requested\" by the committee to make such changes\r\nin the draft as seemed to him desirable, Mr. Adams \"drew a line over the\r\nmost eloquent parts of the oration they had before them, and introduced\r\nthose legal and historical authorities which appear on the record.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply, prepared in this way and finally adopted by the Assembly,\r\nwas longer and more erudite than Mr. Hutchinson's address. To meet the\r\nGovernor's major premise and thus undermine his entire argument, legal\r\nprecedents and the facts of history were freely drawn upon to prove\r\nthat the colonies were properly \"outside of the Realm,\" and therefore,\r\nalthough parts of the Empire by virtue of being under the special\r\njurisdiction of the Crown, not subject in all matters to parliamentary\r\nlegislation. Law and history thus supported the contention, contrary to\r\nthe Governor's assertion, that a line not only could be but always had\r\nbeen \"drawn between the supreme authority of Parliament and the total\r\nindependence of the colonies.\" Apart from any question of law or fact,\r\nthe Assembly thought it of high practical importance that this line\r\nshould be maintained in the future as in the past; for, \"if there be no\r\nsuch line,\" none could deny the Governor's inference that \"either\r\nthe colonies are vassals of the Parliament, or they are totally\r\nindependent\"; upon which the Assembly would observe only that, \"as it\r\ncannot be supposed to have been the intention of the parties in\r\nthe compact that we should be reduced to a state of vassalage, the\r\nconclusion is that it was their sense that we were thus independent.\"\r\nWith very few exceptions, everyone who was of the patriot way of\r\nthinking regarded the Assembly's reply as a complete refutation of the\r\nargument presented in Governor Hutchinson's address.\r\n\r\nIn the Governor's opinion, the disturbed state of government to which\r\nhe had referred in his address was at this time brought to the\r\nhighest pitch by the committees of correspondence recently established\r\nthroughout the province--an event long desired and now brought to pass\r\nby Samuel Adams. That something might be done by a coördinated system of\r\nlocal committees was an \"undigested thought\" that dropped from Adams's\r\nmind while writing a letter to Arthur Lee in September, 1771. At that\r\ntime, such was the general apathy of the people, it would clearly \"be an\r\narduous task for any man to attempt to awaken a sufficient Number in\r\nthe colonies to so grand an undertaking.\" But Samuel Adams, who thought\r\n\"nothing should be despaired of,\" took upon himself the performance of\r\nthis arduous task. Such committees, if they were anywhere needed, were\r\ncertainly needed in Massachusetts, where the people labored under a\r\n\"state of perfect Despotism,\" daily submitting to be ruled--by a native\r\nGovernor who refused to accept a grant from the General Court, received\r\nhis salary from London, and governed the province according to his\r\ninstructions. \"Is it not enough,\" asked Valerius Poplicola in the\r\nGazette \"to have a Governor ... pensioned by those on whom his existence\r\ndepends? ... Is Life, Property, and Every Thing dear and sacred, to be\r\nnow submitted to the Decisions of pension'd judges, holding their places\r\nduring the pleasure of such a Governor, and a Council perhaps overawed?\"\r\n\r\nConfronted by so unprecedented a situation, it occurred to Samuel Adams\r\nthat perhaps Mr. Hutchinson himself might be induced to come to his\r\nassistance. Late in 1772 he accordingly got the Boston town meeting\r\nto present to the Governor an address expressing great alarm at the\r\nestablishment of salaries for judges, and praying that the legislature,\r\nwhich was to meet the 2d of December, might not be prorogued. It\r\nwas possible that in replying the Governor might take a \"high tone,\"\r\nrefusing the request as an interference with his own prerogative; but,\r\nas it was clearly the right of the people to petition, for the Governor\r\nto refuse would be, Samuel Adams thought, to \"put himself in the wrong,\r\nin the opinion of every honest and sensible man; the consequence of\r\nwhich will be that such measures as the people may determine upon to\r\nsave themselves ... will be the more reconcilable even to cautious\r\nminds, and thus we may expect that unanimity which we wish for.\" The\r\nGovernor, in a tone that might be called \"high,\" did in fact object\r\nto the request as not properly a function of town meetings and thus\r\nfurnished the occasion for organizing the committees which he thought so\r\ndisturbing to the state of government.\r\n\r\nIt was on November 2, 1772, upon a motion of Samuel Adams, that a\r\ncommittee was appointed by a town meeting in Faneuil Hall \"to state the\r\nRights of the colonies and of this Province in particular, as Men, as\r\nChristians, and as Subjects; to communicate and publish the same to the\r\nseveral Towns in this Province and to the World as the sense of this\r\nTown, with the Infringements and Violations thereof that have been,\r\nor from time to time may be made ... requesting of each Town a free\r\ncommunication of their Sentiments on this Subject.\" The report of the\r\ncommittee, adopted November 20, announced to the world that, as men, the\r\ncolonists, and those of Massachusetts in particular, were possessed of\r\ncertain \"Natural Rights,\" among them the right to life, liberty, and\r\nproperty; and that, inasmuch as \"men enter into Society ... by voluntary\r\nconsent,\" they still retained \"every Natural Right not expressly given\r\nup or by the nature of the Social Compact necessarily ceded.\" Being\r\nChristians as well as men, the colonists enjoyed also those rights\r\nformulated in \"the institutes of the great Lawgiver and head of the\r\nChristian Church, ... written and promulgated in the New Testament.\"\r\nLastly, being Englishmen, the colonists were, \"by the Common Law of\r\nEngland, exclusive of all charters from the Crown, ... entitled, and by\r\nthe acts of the British Parliament ... declared to be entitled to all\r\nthe Liberties and Privileges of Subjects born ... within the Realm.\"\r\nThe infringements which had been made upon these rights, although\r\nwell known, were once more stated at length; and all the towns of the\r\nprovince were requested, in case they agreed with the sentiments of the\r\nTown of Boston, to unite in a common effort \"to rescue from impending\r\nruin our happy and glorious Constitution.\" For its part, the Town of\r\nBoston was confident that the wisdom of the other towns, as well as\r\ntheir regard for themselves and the rising generation, would not suffer\r\nthem \"to dose, or set supinely indifferent on the brink of destruction,\r\nwhile the Iron hand of oppression is daily tearing the choicest Fruit\r\nfrom the fair Tree of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nModerate men might think, in the winter of 1773, that \"the Iron hand of\r\noppression tearing the choicest Fruit from the Fair Tree of Liberty\" was\r\na figure of speech which did not shape itself with nice flexibility to\r\nthe exact form and pressure of observable facts. It is the limitation\r\nof moderate men to be much governed by observable facts; and if the\r\nmajority could not at once rise to the rhetoric of Samuel Adams, it\r\nwas doubtless because they had not his instinctive sense of the Arch\r\nConspirator's truly implacable enmity to America. The full measure of\r\nthis enmity Mr. Adams lived in the hope of some day revealing.\r\n\r\nIt was of course well known that Mr. Bernard had formerly written home\r\nletters most injurious to the province; and in 1770 there \"was abundant\r\nreason to be jealous,\" as Samuel Adams, writing on behalf of the Town\r\nof Boston, assured Benjamin Franklin, \"that the most mischievous and\r\nvirulent accounts have been lately sent to Administration from Castle\r\nWilliam,\" no doubt from the Commissioners of the Customs. Conveying\r\nmalicious and unfounded misrepresentations of America under the seal of\r\nofficial correspondence had indeed long been a favorite means of mending\r\nthe fortunes of those decayed gentlemen and bankrupt politicians whose\r\nambition it was to rise in office by playing the sycophant to some great\r\nman in England. Mr. Bernard had \"played this game,\" and had been found\r\nout at it, as every one knew. But Mr. Bernard was no American; and it\r\nwas scarcely to be imagined that Mr. Hutchinson, who boasted \"that his\r\nAncestors were of the first Rank and figure in the Country, who ... had\r\nall the Honors lavished upon him which his Fellow-Citizens had it in\r\ntheir power to bestow, who professed the strongest attachment to his\r\nnative Country and the most tender feelings for its Rights, ... should\r\nbe so lost to all sense of Gratitude and public Love as to aid the\r\nDesigns of despotick power for the sake of rising a single step higher.\"\r\n\r\nThis was indeed scarcely to be imagined, yet Samuel Adams imagined it\r\nperfectly. Before there was any material evidence of the fact, he was\r\nable, by reasonable inference, to erect well-grounded suspicions into\r\na kind of working hypothesis. Mr. Hutchinson, Governor of the Province,\r\nwas an Enemy of Liberty with many English friends; he would be required\r\nby official duty and led by personal inclination to maintain a regular\r\ncorrespondence with high officials in England; from which the conclusion\r\nwas that Thomas Hutchinson, professed friend of America, was a traitor,\r\nin secret alienating the affections of the King from his loyal subjects.\r\nSamuel Adams knew this well; and now, after all these years, the\r\nmaterial evidence necessary to convince men of little faith was at\r\nhand. Under circumstances that might be regarded as providential, Thomas\r\nHutchinson was at last unmasked.\r\n\r\nThe prelude to this dramatic performance was pronounced in the\r\nMassachusetts Assembly, one day in June, 1773, by Mr. John Hancock, who\r\ndarkly declared that within eight and forty hours a discovery of great\r\npith and moment would be made to the House. On the next day but one,\r\nSamuel Adams arose and desired the galleries cleared, as there were\r\nmatters to lay before the members which the members only had a right\r\nto know of. When the galleries were cleared he informed the House that\r\ncertain letters, written by high officials in the province and extremely\r\nhostile to the rights and liberties of America, had been procured in\r\nEngland and transmitted to a gentleman who had in turn placed them in\r\nhis, Mr. Adams's, hands, but with the strictest injunction that they be\r\nreturned without being copied or printed. Mr. Adams had given his pledge\r\nto this effect; and, if the House would receive them on these terms, he\r\nwould be glad to read the letters, no restriction having been placed\r\non their being read. They were read accordingly; and a committee having\r\nbeen appointed to make recommendations, it was at length resolved by\r\nthe House of Assembly that certain letters presented to it by Mr. Samuel\r\nAdams tended and were manifestly designed to undermine the Constitution\r\nand establish a despotic power in the province. The proceedings of the\r\nHouse being spread abroad, it soon became everywhere known that only\r\nthe pledged word of the House stood in the way of revelations highly\r\ndamaging to the public character of Governor Hutchinson.\r\n\r\nThis outcome of the matter, however gratifying to Samuel Adams, did\r\nnot satisfy Governor Hutchinson. After there had been \"buzzed about for\r\nthree or four months a story of something that would amaze everybody,\"\r\nand these dark rumors being \"spread through all the towns in the\r\nprovince and everybody's expectations ... raised,\" it was exasperating\r\nto his pragmatic nature to have nothing more definite transpire than\r\nthat the something which would amaze everybody would indeed amaze\r\neverybody if only it could be made known. It should at least be made\r\nknown to the person most concerned. The Governor therefore requested the\r\nAssembly to furnish him copies of the letters which were attributed to\r\nhim and declared by the House to be destructive of the Constitution. In\r\nreply, the House sent certain dates only. The House was of opinion that\r\nthe Governor could easily make authentic copies of whatever letters\r\nhe had written at these dates, if he had written any; and such copies,\r\nbeing furnished to the Assembly, might be published, and the whole\r\nmatter thus cleared up without violating the pledged word of anyone.\r\n\r\nWith this request the Governor refused to comply, on the ground that it\r\nwould be improper to reveal his private correspondence and contrary to\r\ninstructions to reveal that of a public nature. He would say, however,\r\nthat he had written letters on the days mentioned, but in these letters\r\nthere was no statement of fact or expression of opinion not already well\r\nknown. What his opinions were the Assembly and the world might very well\r\ngather from his published speeches and his History of Massachusetts Bay.\r\nIt could scarcely be maintained that he had ever lacked frankness in\r\nthe expression of his opinions; and while his opinions might be thought\r\ndestructive of the Constitution, it was rather late to be amazed at\r\nthem. In any case, the Assembly was assured by the Governor that his\r\nletters neither tended \"nor were designed to subvert, but rather to\r\npreserve entire the constitution of government\" as established by the\r\ncharter of the province.\r\n\r\nA great many people besides the Governor desired to see letters the\r\nsubstance of which could be so differently understood. Samuel Adams\r\nprobably preferred not to be forced to print them; knowing their\r\ncontents, he may have thought that here was a case of those \"dangers\r\nwhich, being known, lose half their power for evil\"; besides, having\r\npledged his word, he wished to keep it. Yet the pressure of public\r\nopinion, becoming every day greater, was difficult to resist,\r\nparticularly by men who were firm believers in the wisdom of the people.\r\nMoreover, it presently appeared that there was no longer any point in\r\nrefusing to publish the letters, inasmuch as Mr. Hancock assured the\r\nHouse that men on the street were, in some way not known, possessed of\r\ncopies, some of which had been placed in his hands. Mr. Hancock's copies\r\nbeing found on comparison to be accurate rescripts of the letters which\r\nhad been read in the House, a committee was accordingly appointed to\r\nconsider how the House might come into honorable possession of the\r\noriginals; from which committee Mr. Hawley soon reported that Samuel\r\nAdams had informed them that the gentleman from whom he had received\r\nthe letters now consented to their being copied, seeing that they had\r\nalready been copied, and printed, seeing that they were already widely\r\ncirculated; whereupon the House, considering itself in honorable\r\npossession, ordered the letters all published.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was thought expedient, before issuing the letters, to\r\nprint and circulate such a series of \"Resolves\" as might prepare the\r\npublic mind for what was to come later. This was accordingly done. The\r\n\"Resolves,\" bearing date of June 16, 1773, indicated clearly and at\r\nlength the precise significance of the letters; declared it to be the\r\nhumble opinion of the House that it was not to the interest of the Crown\r\nto continue in high places persons \"who are known to have, with great\r\nindustry, though secretly, endeavored to undermine, alter, and overthrow\r\nthe Constitution of the province\"; and concluded by praying \"that his\r\nMajesty would be pleased to remove ... forever from the government\r\nthereof\" the Honorable Andrew Oliver and his Excellency Thomas\r\nHutchinson.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty did not remove Mr. Hutchinson; but the Governor's\r\nusefulness, from every point of view, was at an end. When the notorious\r\nletters were finally printed, it appeared that there were seventeen in\r\nall, of which six were written by Mr. Hutchinson in the years 1768 and\r\n1769. These latter documents did not in fact add anything to the world's\r\nstock of knowledge; but they had been so heralded, ushered in with so\r\nmuch portentous explication that they scarcely needed to be read to be\r\nunderstood. \"Had they been Chevy Chase,\" the Governor said, the people\r\nwould have believed them \"full of evil and treason.\" It was indeed the\r\nperfect fruit of Samuel Adams's labors that the significance of Mr.\r\nHutchinson's letters had in some manner become independent of their\r\ncontents. So awake were the people to the danger of being deceived, that\r\nwhatever the Governor now said or ever had written was taken to be but\r\nthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the attention of all patriots was diverted from the letters\r\nto a far more serious matter; and when, on December 16, 1773, a cargo\r\nof the East India Company's tea, consigned among others to Thomas and\r\nElisha Hutchinson, was thrown into Boston harbor, the great crisis,\r\nwhich Samuel Adams had done so much to make inevitable by virtue of\r\nthinking it so, was at last a reality. It was a limitation of Thomas\r\nHutchinson's excellent administrative mind that he was wholly unaware\r\nof this crisis. In February of the next year, finding that \"a little\r\ndiscreet conduct,\" or indeed any conduct on his part, was altogether\r\nwithout good effect, the Governor announced that he had \"obtained leave\r\nfrom the King to go to England.\" On the 1st of June, driving from his\r\nhome to the foot of Dorchester Heights, he embarked on the Minerva and\r\narrived in London one month later. It was his expectation that after a\r\nbrief absence, when General Gage by a show of military force should have\r\nbrought the province to a reasonable frame of mind, he would return and\r\nassume again the responsibilities of his office. He never returned, but\r\ndied in England on June 3, 1780, an unhappy and a homesick exile from\r\nthe country which he loved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI TESTING THE ISSUE\r\n\r\nThe die is now cast; the colonies must either submit or triumph.--George\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal,\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable\r\nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nHappiness.--Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nTwo months and ten days after Mr. Hutchinson embarked for England, John\r\nAdams, the Hon. Thomas Cushing, Mr. Samuel Adams, and Robert Treat Paine\r\nset out \"from Boston, from Mr. Cushing's house, and rode to Coolidge's,\r\nwhere they dined ... with a large company of gentlemen, who went out\r\nand prepared an entertainment for them at that place. A most kindly and\r\naffectionate meeting we had, and about four in the afternoon we took\r\nleave of them, amidst the kindest wishes and fervent prayers of every\r\nman in the company for our health and success. The scene was truly\r\naffecting, beyond all description affecting.\" The four men who in\r\nthis manner left Boston on the 10th of August, 1774, were bound for\r\nPhiladelphia to attend the first Continental Congress. Even Samuel\r\nAdams, in excellent spirits, a little resplendent and doubtless a little\r\nuncomfortable in his new suit and new silk hose, could scarcely have\r\nknown that they were about to share in one of the decisive events in the\r\nhistory of the modern world.\r\n\r\nThe calling of the Continental Congress had followed hard upon those\r\nrecent measures of the British Government which no reasonable man could\r\ndoubt were designed to reduce the colonies to a state of slavery. In\r\nMay, 1773, the East India Company, whose privileges in India had just\r\nbeen greatly restricted, was given permission to export tea from its\r\nEnglish warehouses directly to America, free of all English customs and\r\nexcise duties. The threepenny duty in America was indeed retained; but\r\nthis small tax would not prevent the Company from selling its teas\r\nin America at a lower price than other importers, either smugglers or\r\nlegitimate traders, could afford. It was true the Americans were opposed\r\nto the threepenny tax, and they had bound themselves not to import\r\nany dutied tea; yet neither the opposition to the tax nor the\r\nnon-importation agreements entered into had prevented American merchants\r\nfrom importing, during the last three years, about 580,831 pounds of\r\nEnglish tea, upon which the duty had been paid without occasioning much\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind, hard-headed American merchants, to whom the\r\nCompany applied for information about the state of the tea trade in the\r\ncolonies, assured the directors that the Americans drank a great deal\r\nof tea, which hitherto had been largely smuggled from Holland; and that,\r\nalthough they were in principle much opposed to the tax, \"mankind in\r\ngeneral are bound by interest,\" and \"the Company can afford their teas\r\ncheaper than the Americans can smuggle them from foreigners, which puts\r\nthe success of the design beyond a doubt.\"\r\n\r\nThe hard-headed merchants were doubtless much surprised at the universal\r\noutcry which was raised when it became known that the East India\r\nCompany was preparing to import its teas into the colonies; and yet the\r\nstrenuous opposition everywhere exhibited rather confirmed than refuted\r\nthe philosophical reflection that \"mankind in general are bound by\r\ninterest.\" Neither the New York and Philadelphia merchants who smuggled\r\ntea from Holland, nor the Boston and Charleston merchants who imported\r\ndutied tea from England, could see any advantage to them in having this\r\nprofitable business taken over by the East India Company. Mr. Hancock,\r\nfor example, was one of the Boston merchants who imported a good deal of\r\ndutied tea from England, a fact which was better known then than it has\r\nbeen since; and at Philadelphia John Adams was questioned rather closely\r\nabout Mr. Hancock's violation of the non-importation agreement, in reply\r\nto which he could only say: \"Mr. Hancock, I believe, is justifiable,\r\nbut I am not certain whether he is strictly so.\" Justifiable or not,\r\nMr. Hancock would not wish to see the entire tea trade of America in the\r\nhands of the East India Company.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed to whose interest would it be to have an English company\r\ngranted a monopoly of a thriving branch of American trade? To those,\r\ndoubtless, who were the consignees of the Company, such as the sons of\r\nThomas Hutchinson, or Mr. Abram Lott of New York. Certainly no private\r\nmerchant \"who is acquainted with the operation of a monopoly ... will\r\nsend out or order tea to America when those who have it at first hand\r\nsend to the same market.\" And therefore, since the Company have the\r\nwhole supply, America will \"ultimately be at their mercy to extort what\r\nprice they please for their tea. And when they find their success in\r\nthis article, they will obtain liberty to export their spices, silks,\r\netc.\" This was the light in which the matter appeared to the New York\r\nCommittee of Correspondence.\r\n\r\nJohn Dickinson saw the matter in the same light, a light which his\r\nsuperior abilities enabled him to portray in more lurid colors. The\r\nconduct of the East India Company in Asia, he said,\r\n\r\nhas given ample proof how little they regard the laws of nations,\r\nthe rights, liberties, or lives of men. They have levied war, excited\r\nrebellions, dethroned princes, and sacrificed millions for the sake of\r\ngain. The revenues of mighty kingdoms have centered in their coffers.\r\nAnd these not being sufficient to glut their avarice, they have, by the\r\nmost unparalleled barbarities, extortions, and monopolies, stripped the\r\nmiserable inhabitants of their property and reduced whole provinces to\r\nindigence and ruin ... Thus having drained the sources of that immense\r\nwealth ... they now, it seems, cast their eyes on America, a new\r\ntheater, whereon to exercise their talents of rapine, oppression, and\r\ncruelty. The monopoly of tea, is, I dare say, but a small part of the\r\nplan they have formed to strip us of our property. But thank God we\r\nare not Sea Poys, nor Marattas, but British subjects, who are born to\r\nliberty, who know its worth, and who prize it high.\r\n\r\nFor all of these reasons, therefore--because they were in principle\r\nopposed to taxation without consent, and by interest opposed to an\r\nEnglish company monopolizing the tea trade, and perhaps because they\r\ndesired to give a signal demonstration of the fact that they were\r\nneither Sea Poys nor Marattas--Americans were willing to resort to the\r\nuse of force in order to maintain their own rights by depriving the East\r\nIndia Company of its privileges.\r\n\r\nWhen Capt. Curling's ship arrived in Charleston, the people in that\r\ntown, assembled to deal with the grave crisis, were somewhat uncertain\r\nwhat to do with the Company's tea. On the very ship which brought the\r\nCompany's tea, there were some chests consigned to private merchants;\r\nand certain enthusiastic patriots attending the meeting of citizens\r\naffirmed that the importation of dutied tea by private merchants\r\ncontrary to the non-importation agreement was no less destructive to\r\nliberty than the importation of tea by the East India Company. \"All\r\nthis,\" it was said, \"evinced a desire of not entering hastily into\r\nmeasures.\" In the end, the Company's tea was seized by the Collector and\r\nstored in the vaults under the Exchange. At New York and Philadelphia,\r\nthe Company's tea ships were required to return to England without\r\nlanding; and it was only at Boston, where Governor Hutchinson, whose\r\nsons had been appointed by the Company as its consignees, refused return\r\nclearance papers, that the tea, some £14,000 worth of it, was thrown\r\ninto the harbor.\r\n\r\nThrowing the tea into the harbor raised a sharp sense of resentment in\r\nthe minds of Britons. The common feeling was that, unless the British\r\nGovernment was prepared to renounce all pretense of governing the\r\ncolonies, something must be done. There were a few, such as Josiah\r\nTucker, who thought that the thing to do was to give up the colonies;\r\nin their opinion, colonies were in any case more of a burden than an\r\nadvantage, the supposed advantages of colonies being bound up with\r\nrestrictions on trade, and restrictions on trade being contrary to the\r\nnatural law by which commerce should be free. But the natural law was\r\nonly a recent discovery not yet widely accepted in England; and it did\r\nnot occur to the average Briton that the colonies should be given up.\r\nThe colonies, he supposed, were English colonies; and he thought the\r\ntime had come to establish that fact. He had heard that the colonies had\r\ngrievances. All he knew was that the Government had good-naturedly made\r\nconcessions for the last ten years; and as for this new grievance about\r\ntea, the average Briton made out only that the Americans could buy their\r\ntea cheaper than he could himself.\r\n\r\nObviously the time had come for Old England to set the colonies right by\r\nshowing less concession and more power. Four regiments, as General\r\nGage said, would do the business. The average Briton therefore gave his\r\ncordial approval to four \"coercive\" measures, passed by overwhelming\r\nmajorities in Parliament, which remodeled the Massachusetts charter,\r\nauthorized the Governor to transfer to courts in other colonies or to\r\nEngland any cases involving a breach of the peace or the conduct of\r\npublic officers, provided for quartering troops on the inhabitants, and\r\nclosed the port of Boston until the East India Company should have been\r\ncompensated for the loss of its tea. In order to make these measures\r\neffective, General Gage, commander of the American forces, was made\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts. To what extent he would find it necessary to\r\nuse the military depended upon the Bostonians. \"The die is now cast,\"\r\nthe King wrote to Lord North; \"the colonies must either submit or\r\ntriumph.\" The King's judgment was not always good; but it must be\r\nconceded that in this instance he had penetrated to the very center of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, very naturally, wished not to submit, but whether she\r\ncould triumph without the support of the other colonies was more than\r\ndoubtful; and it was to obtain this support, to devise if possible\r\na method of resistance agreeable to all, that the Congress was now\r\nassembling at Philadelphia. The spirit in which the colonies received\r\nthe news of the Boston Port Bill augured well for union, for in every\r\ncolony it was felt that this was a challenge which could not be evaded\r\nwithout giving the lie to ten years of high talk about the inalienable\r\nrights of Englishmen. As Charles James Fox said, \"all were taught to\r\nconsider the town of Boston as suffering in the common cause.\" This\r\nsentiment John Adams found everywhere expressed--found everywhere, as\r\nhe took his leisurely journey southward, that people were \"very firm\" in\r\ntheir determination to support Massachusetts against the oppression of\r\nthe British Government.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the measures which should be adopted to achieve the end\r\ndesired, there was not the same unanimity. Mr. Adams, at the age of\r\nthirty-eight years, never having been out of New England, kept his\r\neyes very wide open as he entered the foreign colonies of New York\r\nand Pennsylvania. In New York he was much impressed with the \"elegant\r\ncountry seats,\" with the bountiful hospitality, and the lavish way of\r\nliving. \"A more elegant breakfast I never saw\"--this was at Mr. Scott's\r\nhouse--\"rich plate, a very large silver coffee-pot, a very large silver\r\ntea-pot, napkins of the finest materials, toast, and bread and butter\r\nin great perfection,\" and then, to top it off, \"a plate of beautiful\r\npeaches, another of pears, and another of plums, and a musk-melon were\r\nplaced upon the table.\" Nevertheless, in spite of the friendliness\r\nshown to him personally, in spite of the sympathy which, abstractly\r\nconsidered, the New Yorkers expressed for the sad state of Boston, Mr.\r\nAdams was made to understand that if it came to practical measures\r\nfor the support of Massachusetts, many diverse currents of opinion and\r\ninterest would make themselves felt.\r\n\r\nNew York was \"very firm\" in the cause, certainly, but \"Mr. MacDougall\r\ngave a caution to avoid every expression which looked like an allusion\r\nto the last appeal. He says there is a powerful party here who are\r\nintimidated by fears of a civil war, and they have been induced to\r\nacquiesce by assurances that there was no danger, and that a peaceful\r\ncessation of commerce would effect relief. Another party, he says, are\r\nintimidated lest the leveling spirit of the New England colonies\r\nshould propagate itself into New York. Another party are instigated by\r\nEpiscopalian prejudices against New England. Another party are\r\nmerchants largely concerned in navigation, and therefore afraid of\r\nnon-importation, non-consumption, and non-exportation agreements.\r\nAnother party are those who are looking up to Government for favors.\"\r\n\r\nThese interests were doubtless well enough represented by the New York\r\ndeputies to the Congress, whom Mr. Adams now saw for the first time. Mr.\r\nJay, it was said, was a good student of the law and a hard worker. Mr.\r\nLow, \"they say, will profess attachment to the cause of liberty, but his\r\nsincerity is doubted.\" Mr. Alsop was thought to be of good heart, but\r\nunequal, as Mr. Scott affirmed, \"to the trust in point of abilities.\"\r\nMr. Duane--this was Mr. Adams's own impression--\"has a sly, surveying\r\neye, ... very sensible, I think, and very artful.\" And finally there\r\nwas Mr. Livingston, \"a downright, straightforward man\" who reminded Mr.\r\nAdams that Massachusetts had once hung some Quakers, affirmed positively\r\nthat civil war would follow the renunciation of allegiance to Britain,\r\nand threw out vague hints of the Goths and Vandals.\r\n\r\nConfiding these matters to his Diary and keeping his own opinion,\r\nMr. Adams passed on to Philadelphia. There the Massachusetts men were\r\ncordially welcomed, twice over, but straightway cautioned against two\r\ngentlemen, one of whom was \"Dr. Smith, the Provost of the College, who\r\nis looking up to Government for an American Episcopate and a pair\r\nof lawn sleeves\"--a very soft, polite man, \"insinuating, adulating,\r\nsensible, learned, insidious, indefatigable,\" with art enough, \"and\r\nrefinement upon art, to make impressions even upon Mr. Dickinson and Mr.\r\nReed.\" In Pennsylvania, as in every colony, Mr. Adams found, there was\r\na tribe of people \"exactly like the tribe, in the Massachusetts, of\r\nHutchinsonian Addressers.\" Some of this tribe had managed to elbow their\r\nway into the committees of deputies to the Congress, at least from the\r\nmiddle colonies, and probably from South Carolina as well.\r\n\r\nThe \"most spirited and consistent of any\" of the deputies were the\r\ngentlemen from Virginia, among whom were Mr. Henry and Mr. R. H. Lee,\r\nsaid to be the Demosthenes and the Cicero of America. The latter, Mr.\r\nAdams liked much, a \"masterly man\" who was very strong for the most\r\nvigorous measures. But it seemed that even Mr. Lee was strong for\r\nvigorous measures only because he was \"absolutely certain that the same\r\nship which carries hence the resolutions will bring back the redress.\"\r\nIf he supposed otherwise, he \"should be for exceptions.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first day of the Congress it was known that the Massachusetts\r\nmen were in favor of \"vigorous measures;\" vigorous measures\r\nbeing understood to mean the adoption of strict non-importation,\r\nnon-consumption, and non-exportation agreements. There were moments\r\nwhen John Adams thought even these measures tame and unheroic: \"When\r\nDemosthenes (God forgive the vanity of recollecting his example) went\r\nambassador from Athens to the other states of Greece, to excite a\r\nconfederacy against Phillip, he did not go to propose a Non-Importation\r\nor Non-Consumption Agreement....\" For all this, the Massachusetts men\r\nkept themselves well in the background, knowing that there was much\r\njealousy and some fear of New England leadership and well aware that\r\nthe recent experience with non-importation agreements had greatly\r\ndiminished, in the mercantile colonies of New York, Pennsylvania, and\r\nSouth Carolina, the enthusiasm for such experiments.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with non-importation agreements, as Major Hawley had told\r\nJohn Adams, was that \"they will not be faithfully observed; that the\r\nCongress have no power to enforce obedience to their laws; that they\r\nwill be like a legislative without an executive.\" Did Congress have, or\r\ncould it assume, authority to compel men to observe its resolutions, to\r\ncompel them to observe, for example, a non-importation agreement? This\r\nwas a delicate question upon which opinion was divided. \"We have\r\nno legal authority,\" said Mr. Rutledge, \"and obedience to our\r\ndeterminations will only follow the reasonableness, the apparent\r\nutility, and necessity of the measures we adopt. We have no coercive or\r\nlegislative authority.\" If this was so, the non-intercourse policy would\r\ndoubtless prove a broken reed. Massachusetts men were likely to be of\r\nanother opinion, were likely to agree with Patrick Henry, who affirmed\r\nthat \"Government is dissolved. Fleets and armies and the present state\r\nof things show that government is dissolved. We are in a state of\r\nnature, Sir!\" If they were indeed in a state of nature, it was perhaps\r\nhigh time that Congress should assume the powers of a government, in\r\nwhich case it might be possible to adopt and to enforce non-intercourse\r\nmeasures. In this gingerly way did the deputies lift the curtain and\r\npeer down the road to revolution.\r\n\r\nThe deputies, like true Britons, contrived to avoid the highly\r\ntheoretical question of authority, and began straightway to concern\r\nthemselves with the practical question of whether the Congress, with\r\nor without authority, should recommend the adoption of strict\r\nnon-intercourse agreements. Upon this question, as the chief issue, the\r\ndeputies were divided into nearly equal groups. Mr. Galloway, Mr. Duane,\r\nand Mr. Rutledge were perhaps the leaders of those, probably a majority\r\nat first, who were opposed to such vigorous measures, fearing that they\r\nwere intended as a cloak to cover the essentially revolutionary designs\r\nof the shrewd New Englanders. \"We have too much reason to suspect that\r\nindependence is aimed at,\" Mr. Low warned the Congress; and Mr. Galloway\r\ncould see that while the Massachusetts men were in \"behavior very\r\nmodest, yet they are not so much so as not to throw out hints, which\r\nlike straws and feathers show from which point in the compass the wind\r\ncomes.\" In the early days of the Congress, if we are to believe Mr.\r\nHutchinson, this cold north wind was so much disliked that the New\r\nYork and New Jersey deputies, \"and others,\" carried a vote against the\r\nadoption of non-intercourse agreements, \"agreed to present a petition\r\nto the King,\" and \"expected to break up, when letters arrived from Dr.\r\nFranklin which put an end to the petition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journals of the Congress do not record any vote of this kind; but\r\na number of things are known to have occurred in the Congress which the\r\nJournals do not record. On September 17, the famous \"Suffolk Resolves\"\r\nwere laid before the deputies for their approval. The resolutions had\r\nbeen adopted by a county convention in Massachusetts, and in substance\r\nthey recommended to the people of Massachusetts to form a government\r\nindependent of that of which General Gage was the Governor, urged them\r\nmeanwhile to arm themselves in their own defense, and assured them that\r\n\"no obedience is due from this province to either or any part\" of the\r\nCoercive Acts. These were indeed \"vigorous measures\"; and when the\r\nresolutions came before Congress, \"long and warm debates ensued between\r\nthe parties,\" Mr. Galloway afterwards remembered; and he says that when\r\nthe vote to approve them was finally carried, \"two of the dissenting\r\nmembers presumed to offer their protest to it in writing which was\r\nnegatived,\" and when they then insisted that the \"tender of the protest\r\nand the negative should be entered on the minutes, this was also\r\nrejected.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the month, September 28, Mr. Galloway introduced his famous\r\nplan for a \"British-American Parliament\" as a method for permanent\r\nreconciliation. The motion to enter the plan on the minutes and to refer\r\nit for further consideration gave rise to \"long and warm debates,\" the\r\nmotion being carried by a majority of one colony; but subsequently,\r\nprobably on October 21, it was voted to expunge the plan, together with\r\nall resolutions referring to it, from the minutes. Nothing, as Benjamin\r\nFranklin wrote from England, could so encourage the British Government\r\nto persist in its oppressive policy as the knowledge that dissensions\r\nexisted in the Congress; and since these dissensions did unfortunately\r\nexist, there was a widespread feeling that it would be the part of\r\nwisdom to conceal them as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a majority of the deputies, when they first read the Suffolk\r\nResolutions, were amazed that the rash New Englanders should venture to\r\npledge themselves so frankly to rebellion. Certainly no one who thought\r\nhimself a loyal subject of King George could even contemplate rebellion;\r\nbut, on the other hand, to leave Massachusetts in the lurch after so\r\nmuch talk of union and the maintenance of American rights would\r\nmake loyal Americans look a little ridiculous. That would be to show\r\nthemselves lambs as soon as Britons had shown themselves lions, which\r\nwas precisely what their enemies in England boasted they would do.\r\nConfronted by this difficult dilemma, moderate men without decided\r\nopinions began to fix their attention less upon the exact nature of the\r\nmeasures they were asked to support, and more upon the probable effect\r\nof such measures upon the British Government. It might be true, and\r\nall reports from England seemed to point that way, that the British\r\nGovernment was only brandishing the sword in terrorem, to see whether\r\nthe Americans would not run at once to cover; in which case it would be\r\nwiser for all loyal subjects to pledge themselves even to rebellion, the\r\nprospect being so very good that Britain would quickly sheathe its sword\r\nand present instead the olive branch, saying, \"This is what I intended\r\nto offer.\" Therefore, rather than leave Massachusetts in the lurch and\r\nso give the lie to the boasted unity of the colonies, many moderate\r\nand loyal subjects voted to approve the Suffolk Resolutions, which they\r\nthought very rash and ill-advised measures.\r\n\r\nWhatever differences still prevailed, if indeed practical men could hold\r\nout after the accomplished fact, might be bridged and compromised\r\nby adopting those petitions and addresses which the timid thought\r\nsufficient and at the same time by subscribing to and \"recommending\"\r\nthose non-intercourse agreements which the bolder sort thought\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nThis compromise was in fact effected. The Congress unanimously adopted\r\nthe moderate addresses which Lord Chatham afterwards praised for their\r\nmasterly exposition of true constitutional principles; but it likewise\r\nadopted, also unanimously, a series of resolutions known as the\r\nAssociation, to which the deputies subscribed their names. By signing\r\nthe Association, the deputies bound themselves, and recommended the\r\npeople in all the colonies to bind themselves, not to import, after\r\nDecember 1, 1774, any commodities from Great Britain or Ireland, or\r\nmolasses, syrups, sugars, and coffee from the British plantations, or\r\nEast India Company tea from any place, or wines from Madeira, or foreign\r\nindigo; not to consume, after March 1, 1775, any of these commodities;\r\nand not to export, after September 10, 1775, any commodities whatever to\r\nGreat Britain, Ireland, or the West Indies, \"except rice to Europe.\" It\r\nwas further recommended that a committee be formed in each city, town,\r\nand county, whose business it should be to observe the conduct of all\r\npersons, those who refused to sign the Association as well as those who\r\nsigned it, and to publish the names of all persons who did not observe\r\nthe agreements there entered into, \"to the end that all such foes of\r\nthe rights of British-America may be publicly known and universally\r\ncondemned as the enemies of American liberty\"; and it was likewise\r\nrecommended that the committees should inspect the customs entries\r\nfrequently, that they should seize all goods imported contrary to the\r\nrecommendation of the Association and reship them, or, if the owner\r\npreferred, sell them at public auction, the owner to be recompensed for\r\nthe first costs, the profits, if any, to be devoted to relieving the\r\npeople of Boston.\r\n\r\nHaving thus adopted a Petition to the King, a Memorial to the\r\nInhabitants of the British Colonies, and an Address to the People of\r\nGreat Britain, and having recommended a certain line of conduct to\r\nbe followed by all loyal Americans, the first Continental Congress\r\nadjourned. It had assumed no \"coercive or legislative authority\";\r\nobedience to its determinations would doubtless depend, as Mr. Rutledge\r\nhad said, upon \"the reasonableness, the apparent utility and necessity\"\r\nof its recommendations.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt,\" the Earl of Dartmouth is reported to have said,\r\n\"that every one who had signed the Association was guilty of treason.\"\r\nThe Earl of Dartmouth was not counted one of the enemies of America; and\r\nif this was his opinion of the action of the first Continental Congress,\r\nLord North's supporters in Parliament, a great majority since the\r\nrecent elections, were not likely to take a more favorable view of it.\r\nNevertheless, when the American question came up for consideration in\r\nthe winter of 1775, \"conciliation\" was a word frequently heard on all\r\nsides, and even corrupt ministers were understood to be dallying with\r\nschemes of accommodation. In January and February great men were sending\r\nagents, and even coming themselves, to Dr. Franklin to learn what in his\r\nopinion the colonies would be satisfied with. Lord Chatham, as might\r\nbe guessed, was meditating a plan. On the 29th of January, he came to\r\nCraven Street and showed it to Franklin, who made notes upon it, and\r\nlater went out to Hayes, two hours' ride from London, where he remained\r\nfor four hours listening to the easy flow of the Great Commoner's\r\neloquence without being able to get any of his own ideas presented.\r\n\r\nFortified by the presence if not by the advice of Franklin, Lord Chatham\r\nlaid his plan before Parliament on the 1st of February. He would have an\r\nexplicit declaration of the dependence of the colonies on the Crown and\r\nParliament in all matters of trade and an equally explicit declaration\r\nthat no tax should be imposed upon the colonies without their consent;\r\nand when the Congress at Philadelphia should have acknowledged the\r\nsupremacy of the Crown and Parliament and should have made a free and\r\nperpetual grant of revenue, then he would have all the obnoxious acts\r\npassed since 1764, and especially the Coercive Acts, totally repealed.\r\nLord Sandwich, in a warm speech, moved to reject these proposals at\r\nonce; and when the vote was taken it was found that 61 noble lords were\r\nin favor of rejecting them at once, while only 31 were opposed to so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nLord North was perhaps less opposed to reconciliation than other noble\r\nlords were. A few days later Franklin was approached by Admiral Howe,\r\nwho was understood to know the First Minister's mind, to learn whether\r\nhe might not suggest something for the Government to go upon. The\r\nvenerable Friend of the Human Race was willing enough to set down on\r\npaper some \"Hints\" which Admiral Howe might think advisable to show\r\nto ministers. It happened, however, that the \"Hints\" went far beyond\r\nanything the Government had in mind. Ministers would perhaps be willing\r\nto repeal the Tea Act and the Boston Port Bill; but they felt strongly\r\nthat the act regulating the Massachusetts charter must stand as \"an\r\nexample of the power of Parliament.\" Franklin, on the other hand, was\r\ncertain that \"while Parliament claims the right of altering American\r\nconstitutions at pleasure, there can be no agreement.\" Since the\r\nparties were so far apart, it seemed useless to continue the informal\r\nnegotiation, and on February 20, Lord North laid before Parliament his\r\nown plan for effecting an accommodation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, it was not his own plan; for Lord North, much\r\ninclined to regard himself as the King's minister, was likely to\r\nsubordinate his wishes to those of his master. King George III, at all\r\nevents, had his own ideas on conciliation. \"I am a friend to holding\r\nout the olive branch,\" he wrote in February, \"yet I believe that,\r\nwhen vigorous measures appear to be the only means, the colonies will\r\nsubmit.\" Knowing the King's ideas, as well as those of Dr. Franklin,\r\nLord North accordingly introduced into Parliament the Resolution on\r\nConciliation, which provided that when any colony should make provision\r\n\"for contributing their proportion to the common defense, ... and for\r\nthe support of the civil government, and the administration of justice\r\nin such province, ... it will be proper, ... for so long as such\r\nprovision shall be made, ... to forbear, in respect of such province,\r\n... to levy any Duty, Tax, or Assessment, ... except ... for the\r\nregulation of commerce.\" The minister's resolution, although by most of\r\nhis supporters thought to be useless, was adopted by a vote of 274 to\r\n88.\r\n\r\nIt was not the intention of the Government to hold out the olive branch\r\nby itself. Lord North, and perhaps the King also, hoped the colonies\r\nwould accept it; but by all maxims of politics an olive branch was more\r\nlikely to be accepted if the shining sword was presented at the same\r\ntime as the only alternative. As early as the 10th of February, Lord\r\nNorth had introduced into Parliament a bill, finally passed March 30,\r\n\"to restrain the trade and commerce\" of the New England colonies to\r\n\"Great Britain, Ireland, and the British islands in the West Indies,\"\r\nand to exclude these colonies from \"carrying on any fishery on the banks\r\nof Newfoundland,\" it being \"highly unfit that the inhabitants of the\r\nsaid provinces ... should enjoy the same privileges of trade ... to\r\nwhich his Majesty's faithful and obedient subjects are entitled.\" The\r\nprovisions of this act were extended to the other colonies in April; and\r\nmeantime measures were taken to strengthen the naval forces.\r\n\r\nThe first certain information that Lord North had extended the olive\r\nbranch reached New York April 24, 1775, two weeks before the day fixed\r\nfor the meeting of the second Continental Congress. Important changes\r\nhad taken place since the first Congress, six months earlier, had sent\r\nforth its resolutions. In every colony there was a sufficient number\r\nof patriots who saw \"the reasonableness, the apparent utility, and\r\nnecessity\" of forming the committees which the Association recommended;\r\nand these committees everywhere, with a marked degree of success,\r\nimmediately set about convincing their neighbors of the utility and\r\nnecessity of signing the non-importation agreement, or at least of\r\nobserving it even if they were not disposed to sign it. To deny the\r\nreasonableness of the Association was now indeed much more difficult\r\nthan it would have been before the Congress assembled; for the Congress,\r\nhaving published certain resolutions unanimously entered into, had come\r\nto be the symbol of America united in defense of its rights; and what\r\nAmerican, if indeed one might call him such, would wish to be thought\r\ndisloyal to America or an enemy of its liberties? It required a degree\r\nof assurance for any man to set up his individual judgment against the\r\ndeliberate and united judgment of the chosen representatives of all the\r\ncolonies; and that must be indeed a very subtle mind which could draw\r\nthe distinction between an enemy of liberty and a friend of liberty who\r\nwas unwilling to observe the Association.\r\n\r\nSome such subtle minds there were--a considerable number in most\r\ncolonies who declared themselves friends of liberty but not of the\r\nAssociation, loyal to America but not to the Congress. One of these was\r\nSamuel Seabury, an Episcopalian clergyman living in Westchester\r\nCounty, New York, a vigorous, downright man, who at once expressed his\r\nsentiments in a forcible and logical manner, and with much sarcastic\r\nhumor, in a series of pamphlets which were widely read and much\r\ncommended by those who found in them their own views so effectively\r\nexpressed. This Westchester Farmer--for so he signed himself--proclaimed\r\nthat he had always been, and was still, a friend of liberty in general\r\nand of American liberty in particular. The late British measures he\r\nthought unwise and illiberal, and he had hoped that the Congress would\r\nbe able to obtain redress, and perhaps even to effect a permanent\r\nreconciliation. But these hopes were seen to be vain from the day when\r\nthe Congress approved the Suffolk Resolutions and, instead of adopting\r\nMr. Galloway's plan, adopted the Association. For no sane man could\r\ndoubt that, under the thin disguise of \"recommendations,\" Congress had\r\nassumed the powers of government and counseled rebellion. The obvious\r\nconclusion from this was that, if one could not be a loyal American\r\nwithout submitting to Congress, then it was impossible to be at the same\r\ntime a loyal American and a loyal British subject.\r\n\r\nBut, if the problem were rightly considered, Mr. Seabury thought one\r\nmight be loyal to America in the best sense without supporting Congress;\r\nfor, apart from any question of legality, the Association was highly\r\ninexpedient, inasmuch as non-importation would injure America more than\r\nit injured England, and, for this reason if for no others, it would be\r\nfound impossible to \"bully and frighten the supreme government of the\r\nnation.\" Yet all this was beside the main point, which was that the\r\naction of Congress, whether expedient or not, was illegal. It was\r\nillegal because it authorized the committees to enforce the Association\r\nupon all alike, upon those who never agreed to observe it as well as\r\nupon those who did; and these committees, as everyone knew, were so\r\nenforcing it and were \"imposing penalties upon those who have presumed\r\nto violate it.\" The Congress talked loudly of the tyranny of the British\r\nGovernment. Tyranny! Good Heavens! Was any tyranny worse than that of\r\nself-constituted committees which, in the name of liberty, were daily\r\nconducting the most hateful inquisition into the private affairs of free\r\nBritish subjects? \"Will you choose such committees? Will you submit to\r\nthem should they be chosen by the weak, foolish, turbulent part of the\r\n... people? I will not. No. If I must be enslaved, let it be by a King\r\nat least, and not by a parcel of upstart, lawless committeemen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts men were meanwhile showing no disposition to submit\r\nto the King. In that colony a Provincial Congress, organized at Salem\r\nin October, 1774, and afterwards removed to Cambridge, had assumed\r\nall powers of government in spite of General Gage and contrary to the\r\nprovisions of the act by which Parliament had presumed to remodel the\r\nMassachusetts charter. Outside of Boston at least, the allegiance of the\r\npeople was freely given to this extra-legal government; and under its\r\ndirection the towns began to prepare for defense by organizing the\r\nmilitia and procuring and storing arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nTo destroy such stores of ammunition seemed to General Gage quite the\r\nmost obvious of his duties; and Colonel Smith was accordingly ordered to\r\nproceed to the little village of Concord, some eighteen miles northwest\r\nof Boston, and destroy the magazines which were known to be collected\r\nthere. The night of the 18th of April was the time fixed for this\r\nexpedition; and in the evening of that day patriots in Boston noted\r\nwith alarm that bodies of troops were moving towards the waterside. Dr.\r\nJoseph Warren, knowing or easily guessing the destination of the troops,\r\nat once despatched William Dawes, and later in the evening Paul Revere\r\nalso, to Lexington and Concord to spread the alarm. As the little army\r\nof Colonel Smith--a thousand men, more or less--left Boston and marched\r\nup into the country, church bells and the booming of cannon announced\r\ntheir coming. Day was breaking when the British troops approached the\r\ntown of Lexington; and there on the green they could see, in the\r\nearly morning light, perhaps half a hundred men standing in military\r\narray--fifty against a thousand! The British rushed forward with huzzas,\r\nin the midst of which shots were heard; and when the little band of\r\nminutemen was dispersed eight of the fifty lay dead upon the village\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Lexington was begun, but it was not yet finished. Pushing\r\non to Concord, the thousand disciplined British regulars captured and\r\ndestroyed the military stores collected there. This was easily done; but\r\nthe return from Concord to Lexington, and from Lexington to Cambridge,\r\nproved a disastrous retreat. The British found indeed no minutemen drawn\r\nup in military array to block their path; but they found themselves\r\nsubject to the deadly fire of men concealed behind the trees and rocks\r\nand clumps of shrubs that everywhere conveniently lined the open road.\r\nWith this method of warfare, not learned in books, the British were\r\nunfamiliar. Discipline was but a handicap; and the fifteen hundred\r\nsoldiers that General Gage sent out to Lexington to rescue Colonel Smith\r\nserved only to make the disaster greater in the end. When the retreating\r\narmy finally reached the shelter of Cambridge, it had lost, in\r\nkilled and wounded, 247 men; while the Americans, of whom it had been\r\nconfidently asserted in England that they would not stand against\r\nBritish regulars, had lost but 88.\r\n\r\nThe courier announcing the news of Lexington passed through New York\r\non the 23d of April. Twenty-four hours later, during the height of the\r\nexcitement occasioned by that event, intelligence arrived from England\r\nthat Parliament had approved Lord North's Resolution on Conciliation.\r\nFor extending the olive branch, the time was inauspicious; and when the\r\nsecond Continental Congress assembled, two weeks later, on the 10th of\r\nMay, men were everywhere wrathfully declaring that the blood shed at\r\nLexington made allegiance to Britain forever impossible.\r\n\r\nIt might indeed have seemed that the time had come when every man must\r\ndecide, once for all, whether he would submit unreservedly to the King\r\nor stand without question for the defense of America. Yet not all men,\r\nnot a majority of men in the second Continental Congress, were of that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe second Congress was filled with moderate minded men who would not\r\nbelieve the time had come when that decision had to be made--men who\r\nwere bound to sign themselves British-Americans till the last possible\r\nmoment, many of whom could not now have told whether in the end they\r\nwould sign themselves Britons or Americans. Surely, they said, we need\r\nnot make the decision yet. We have the best of reasons for knowing that\r\nBritain will not press matters to extremities. Can we not handle the\r\nolive branch and the sword as well as Lord North? A little fighting, to\r\nconvince ministers that we can't be frightened, and all will be well. We\r\nshall have been neither rebels nor slaves. The second Congress was full\r\nof men who were, as yet, \"Neither-Nor.\"\r\n\r\nThere was Joseph Galloway, once more elected to represent Pennsylvania,\r\nready to do what he could to keep Congress from hasty action, hoping\r\nfor the best yet rather expecting the worst, discreetly retiring, at an\r\nearly date, within the ranks of the British loyalists. John Alsop, the\r\n\"soft, sweet\" man, was also there, active enough in his mild way until\r\nthe very last--until the Declaration of Independence, as he said,\r\n\"closed the last door to reconciliation.\" There, too, was James Duane,\r\nwith never so great need of his \"surveying eye\" to enable him to size up\r\nthe situation. He is more discreet than any one, and sits quietly in his\r\nseat, on those days when he finds it convenient to attend, which is not\r\ntoo often--especially after November, at which time he moved his effects\r\nto Duanesborough, and so very soon disappears from sight, except perhaps\r\nvicariously in the person of his servant, James Brattle, whom we see\r\nflitting obscurely from Philadelphia to New York conveying secret\r\ninformation to Governor Tryon. John Jay, the hard-reading young\r\nlawyer, who favored Mr. Galloway's plan but in the end signed the\r\nAssociation--here he is again, edging his way carefully along, watching\r\nhis step, crossing no bridges beforehand, well over indeed before\r\nhe seems aware of any gulf to be crossed. And here is the famous\r\nPennsylvania Farmer, leader of all moderate men, John Dickinson, only\r\ntoo well aware of the gulf opening up before him, fervently praying\r\nthat it may close again of its own accord. Mr. Dickinson has no mind\r\nfor anything but conciliation, to obtain which he will go the length of\r\ndonning a Colonel's uniform, or at least a Colonel's title, perfecting\r\nhimself and his neighbors in the manual of arms against the day when\r\nthe King would graciously listen to the loyal and humble petition of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickinson, staking all on the petition, was distressed at the rash\r\ntalk that went on out of doors; and in this respect, no one distressed\r\nhim more than his old friend, John Adams, who thought and said that\r\na petition was a waste of time and who was all for the most vigorous\r\nmeasures (such, doubtless, as Demosthenes might have counseled),--the\r\nseizure of all crown officers, the formation of state governments, the\r\nraising of an army, and negotiations for obtaining the assistance of\r\nFrance. When Mr. Dickinson, having marshaled his followers from\r\nthe middle colonies and South Carolina, got his petition before the\r\nCongress, John Adams, as a matter of course, made \"an opposition to\r\nit in as long a speech as I commonly made ... in answer to all the\r\narguments that had been urged.\" And Adams relates in his Diary how,\r\nbeing shortly called out of Congress Hall, he was followed by Mr.\r\nDickinson, who broke out upon him in great anger. \"What is the\r\nreason, Mr. Adams, that you New-England men oppose our measures of\r\nreconciliation? There now is Sullivan, in a long harangue, following you\r\nin a determined opposition to our petition to the King. Look ye! If you\r\ndon't concur with us in our pacific system, I and a number of us will\r\nbreak off from you in New England, and we will carry on the opposition\r\nby ourselves in our own way.\" At that moment it chanced that John Adams\r\nwas \"in a very happy temper\" (which was not always the case), and so,\r\nhe says, was able to reply very coolly. \"Mr. Dickinson, there are many\r\nthings that I can very cheerfully sacrifice to harmony, and even to\r\nunanimity; but I am not to be threatened into an express adoption or\r\napprobation of measures which my judgment reprobates. Congress must\r\njudge, and if they pronounce against me, I must submit, as, if they\r\ndetermine against you, you ought to acquiesce.\"\r\n\r\nThe Congress did decide. It decided to adopt Mr. Dickinson's petition;\r\nand to this measure John Adams submitted. But the Congress also decided\r\nto raise a Continental army to assist Massachusetts in driving\r\nthe British forces out of Boston, of which army it appointed, as\r\nCommander-in-Chief, George Washington, Esq.; and in justification of\r\nthese measures it published a Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of\r\nTaking up Arms:\r\n\r\nOur cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources\r\nare great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly\r\nattainable.... Fortified with these animating reflections, we ...\r\ndeclare that ... the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to\r\nassume, we will ... employ for the preservation of our liberties, being\r\nwith one mind resolved to die freemen rather than live slaves.... We\r\nhave not raised armies with ambitious designs of separating from Great\r\nBritain.... We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the\r\npart of the aggressors.... With an humble confidence in the mercies\r\nof the supreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the Universe, we ...\r\nimplore his divine goodness to protect us happily through this great\r\nconflict, to dispose our adversaries to reconciliation on reasonable\r\nterms, and thereby to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn these measures Mr. Dickinson acquiesced, as John Adams had submitted\r\nto the petition. The \"perfect\" union which was thus attained was\r\nnevertheless a union of wills rather than of opinions; and on July 24,\r\n1775, in a letter to James Warren, John Adams gave a frank account of\r\nthe state of mind to which the perfect union had reduced him:\r\n\r\nIn confidence, I am determined to write freely to you this time. A\r\ncertain great Fortune and piddling Genius, whose Fame has been trumpeted\r\nso loudly, has given a silly Cast to our whole Doings. We are between\r\nHawk and Buzzard. We ought to have had in our Hands a month ago the\r\nwhole Legislative, executive, and judicial of the whole Continent, and\r\nhave completely modeled a Constitution; to have raised a naval Power,\r\nand opened our Ports wide; to have arrested every Friend of Government\r\non the Continent and held them as Hostages for the poor Victims of\r\nBoston, and then opened the Door as wide as possible for Peace and\r\nReconciliation. After that they might have petitioned, and negotiated,\r\nand addressed, etc., if they would. Is all this extravagant? Is it wild?\r\nIs it not the soundest Policy?\r\n\r\nIt seems that Mr. Adams would have presented the sword boldly, keeping\r\nthe olive branch carefully concealed behind his back. His letter,\r\nintercepted by the British Government, and printed about the time when\r\nMr. Dickinson's petition was received in London, did nothing to make\r\nthe union in America more perfect, or to facilitate the opening of that\r\nrefractory \"Door ... for Peace and Reconciliation.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is that John Adams no longer believed in the possibility of\r\nopening this door, even by the tiniest crack; and even those who still\r\nhad faith in the petition as a means to that end found it somewhat\r\ndifficult to keep their faith alive during the weary month of October\r\nwhile they waited for the King's reply. Mr. Chase, although he had\r\n\"not absolutely discarded every glimpse of a hope of reconciliation,\"\r\nadmitted that \"the prospect was gloomy.\" Mr. Zubly assured Congress that\r\nhe \"did hope for a reconciliation and that this winter may bring it\";\r\nand he added, as if justifying himself against sceptical shrugs of\r\nshoulders, \"I may enjoy my hopes for reconciliation; others may enjoy\r\ntheirs that none will take place.\" It might almost seem that the idea\r\nof reconciliation, in this October of 1775, was a vanishing image to be\r\nenjoyed retrospectively rather than anything substantial to build upon\r\nfor the future. This it was, perhaps, that gave especial point to Mr.\r\nZubly's oft-repeated assertion that Congress must speedily obtain one\r\nof two things--\"a reconciliation with Great Britain, or the means of\r\ncarrying on the war.\"\r\n\r\nReconciliation or war! This was surely a new antithesis. Had not arms\r\nbeen taken up for the purpose precisely of disposing their adversaries\r\n\"to reconciliation on reasonable terms\"? Does Mr. Zubly mean to say then\r\nthat war is an alternative to reconciliation--an alternative which\r\nwill lead the colonies away from compromise towards that which all\r\nhave professed not to desire? Is Mr. Zubly hinting at independence even\r\nbefore the King has replied to the petition? No. This is not what Mr.\r\nZubly meant. What he had in the back of his mind, and what the Congress\r\nwas coming to have in the back of its mind, if one may judge from the\r\nabbreviated notes which John Adams took of the debates in the fall of\r\n1775, was that if the colonies could not obtain reconciliation by means\r\nof the non-intercourse measures very soon--this very winter as Mr.\r\nZubly hoped--they would have to rely for reconciliation upon a vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war; in which case the non-intercourse measures were\r\nlikely to prove an obstacle rather than an advantage, since they would\r\nmake it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the \"means of carrying\r\non the war.\"\r\n\r\nThe non-intercourse measures had been designed to obtain conciliation\r\nby forcing Great Britain to make concessions; but if Great Britain would\r\nmake no concessions, then the non-intercourse measures, by destroying\r\nthe trade and prosperity of the colonies, would have no other effect\r\nthan to bring about conciliation by forcing the colonies to make\r\nconcessions themselves. This was not the kind of conciliation that any\r\none wanted; and so the real antithesis which now confronted Congress\r\nwas between war and non-intercourse. Mr. Livingston put the situation\r\nclearly when he said: \"We are between hawk and buzzard; we puzzle\r\nourselves between the commercial and warlike opposition.\"\r\n\r\nThrough long debates Congress puzzled itself over the difficult task of\r\nmaintaining the Association and of obtaining the means for carrying on\r\nthe war. Doubtless a simple way out would be for Congress to allow\r\nso much exportation only as might be necessary to pay for arms and\r\nammunition; and still not so simple either, since it would at once\r\nexcite many jealousies. \"To get powder,\" Mr. Jay observed, \"we keep a\r\nsecret law that produce may be exported. Then come the wrangles among\r\nthe people. A vessel is seen loading--a fellow runs to the committee.\"\r\nWell, it could not be helped; let the fellow run to the committee, and\r\nlet the committee reassure him--that was the business of the committee;\r\nand so the Congress authorized the several colonies to export as much\r\n\"produce, except horned cattle, sheep, hogs, and poultry, as they may\r\ndeem necessary for the importation of arms, ammunition, sulphur, and\r\nsaltpetre.\" Thus powder might be obtained.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, war could not live by powder alone. The imponderable moral\r\nfactors had to be considered, chief of which was the popular support or\r\nopposition which Congress and the army might count upon under certain\r\ncircumstances. No doubt people were patriotic and wished to maintain\r\ntheir rights; but no doubt people would be more patriotic and more\r\nenthusiastic and practically active in their support of both Congress\r\nand the army, if they were reasonably prosperous and contented than if\r\nthey were not. Self-denying ordinances were, by their very nature, of\r\ntemporary and limited efficacy; and it was pertinent to inquire how long\r\nthe people would be content with the total stoppage of trade and the\r\ndecay of business which was becoming every day more marked. \"We can live\r\non acorns; but will we?\" It would perhaps be prudent not to expect\r\n\"more virtue ... from our people than any people ever had\"; it would\r\nbe prudent \"not to put virtue to too severe a test, ... lest we wear it\r\nout.\" And it might well be asked what would wear it out and \"disunite us\r\nmore than the decay of all business? The people will feel, and will say,\r\nthat Congress tax them and oppress them more than Parliament.\" If the\r\npeople were to be asked to fight for their rights, they must at all\r\nhazards not be allowed to say that Congress oppressed them more than\r\nParliament!\r\n\r\nFor the moment all this was no more than a confession that the\r\nAssociation, originally designed as a finely chiseled stepping-stone to\r\nreconciliation, was likely to prove a stumbling-block unless the King\r\ngraciously extended his royal hand to give a hearty lift. It presently\r\nappeared that the King refused to extend his hand. October 31, 1775,\r\ninformation reached America that Richard Penn and Arthur Lee, having\r\npresented the petition to Lord Dartmouth, were informed that the King\r\nwould not receive them, and furthermore that no answer would be returned\r\nto the Congress. Ignoring the petition was to exhibit only one degree\r\nmore of contempt for that carefully prepared document than the Congress\r\nhad shown for Lord North's Resolution on Conciliation; and now that the\r\nolive branch had been spurned on both sides, it was a little difficult\r\nto see how either side could possibly refuse the sword.\r\n\r\nThat the colonies would refuse the sword was not very likely; but, as\r\nif to make a refusal impossible, the British Government, on December 22,\r\n1775, decided to thrust the sword into their hands. This at all events\r\nwas thought by many men to be the effect of the Prohibitory Act, which\r\ndeclared the colonies outside the protection of the Crown, and which,\r\nfor the purpose of reducing them to submission, laid an embargo upon all\r\ntheir trade and proclaimed their ports in a state of blockade.\r\n\r\nI know not [John Adams wrote] whether you have seen the Act of\r\nParliament called the Restraining Act or Prohibitory Act, or Piratical\r\nAct, or Act of Independency--for by all these titles is it called. I\r\nthink the most apposite is the Act of Independency; the King, Lords,\r\nand Commons have united in sundering this country from that, I think,\r\nforever. It is a complete dismemberment of the British Empire. It throws\r\nthirteen colonies out of the royal protection, and makes us independent\r\nin spite of supplications and entreaties. It may be fortunate that the\r\nact of Independency should come from the British Parliament rather than\r\nfrom the American Congress; but it is very odd that Americans should\r\nhesitate at accepting such a gift from them.\r\n\r\nThe majority of those who refused to accept it--and the number was\r\nlarge--retired, with saddened hearts for the most part, into the ranks\r\nof the British Loyalists; only a few, with John Dickinson at their head,\r\ncould still visualize the vanishing image of reconciliation. Whether the\r\nProhibitory Act made reconciliation impossible or not, one thing at all\r\nevents it made clear: if Britain was bent on forcing the colonies to\r\nsubmit by ruining their trade, it could scarcely be good policy for the\r\ncolonies to help her do it; of which the reasonable conclusion seemed\r\nto be that, since the Parliament wished to close the ports of America to\r\nthe world, Congress would do well to open them to the world. On February\r\n16, 1776, Congress accordingly took into \"consideration the propriety of\r\nopening the ports.\" To declare the ports open to the world was no doubt\r\neasily done; but the main thing after all was to carry on trade with the\r\nworld; and this was not so easy since British naval vessels were there\r\nto prevent it. \"We can't carry on a beneficial trade, as our enemies\r\nwill take our ships\"; so Mr. Sherman said, and of this he thought the\r\nobvious inference was that \"a treaty with a foreign power is necessary,\r\nbefore we open our trade, to protect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A treaty with a foreign power\"--Mr. Wythe also mentioned this as a\r\npossible way of reviving the trade of the colonies; but a treaty with a\r\nforeign power was easier conceived of than made, and Mr. Wythe thought\r\n\"other things are to be considered before we adopt such a measure.\"\r\nIn considering these \"other things,\" Mr. Wythe asked and answered the\r\nfundamental question: \"In what character shall we treat?--as subjects of\r\nGreat Britain--as rebels? ... If we should offer our trade to the court\r\nof France, would they take notice of it any more than if Bristol or\r\nLiverpool should offer theirs, while we profess to be subjects? No.\r\nWe must declare ourselves a free people.\" Thus it appeared that the\r\ncharacter of British subjects, no less than the Association, was a\r\nstumbling-block in the way of obtaining \"the means of carrying on the\r\nwar.\" The sword, as an instrument for maintaining rights, could after\r\nall not be effectively wielded by America so long as her hand was\r\nshackled by even the half-broken ties of a professed allegiance to\r\nBritain. Therefore, when the Congress, on the 6th of April, opened the\r\nports of the colonies to the world, the Declaration of Independence was\r\na foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe idea of independence, for many months past, had hovered like a\r\ndisembodied hope or menace about the entrance ways of controversy. A few\r\nclear-sighted men, such as John Adams and Samuel Seabury, had so long\r\ncontemplated the idea without blinking that it had taken on familiar\r\nform and substance. But the great majority had steadily refused to\r\nconsider it, except as a possible alternative not needing for the\r\npresent to be embraced. All these moderate, middle-of-the-way men\r\nhad now to bring this idea into the focus of attention, for the great\r\nillusion that Britain would not push matters to extremities was rapidly\r\ndissolving, and the time was come when it was no longer possible for any\r\nman to be a British-American and when every man must decide whether it\r\nwas better to be an American even at the price of rebellion or a Briton\r\neven at the price of submission. It is true that many never made up\r\ntheir minds on this point, being quite content to swear allegiance\r\nto whichever cause, according to time or place, happened to be in the\r\nascendant. But of all those thinking men whose minds could be made up\r\nto stay, perhaps a third--this is the estimate of John Adams--joined\r\nthe ranks of the British Loyalists; while the rest, with more or\r\nless reluctance, gave their support, little or great, to the cause of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nWhen one has made, with whatever reluctance, an irrevocable decision, it\r\nis doubtless well to become adjusted to it as rapidly as possible; and\r\nthis he can best do by thinking of the decision as a wise one--the only\r\none, in fact, which a sensible person could have made. Thus it was that\r\nthe idea of independence, embraced by most men with reluctance as a last\r\nresort and a necessary evil, rapidly lost, in proportion as it seemed\r\nnecessary, its character of evil, took on the character of the highest\r\nwisdom, and so came to be regarded as a predestined event which all\r\nhonest patriots must rejoice in having had a hand in bringing about.\r\n\r\nThis change in the point of view would doubtless have been made in any\r\ncase; but in rapidly investing the idea of independence with the shining\r\nvirtues of an absolute good to be embraced joyously, a great influence\r\nmust be ascribed to the little pamphlet entitled Common Sense, written\r\nby a man then known to good patriots as Thomas Paine, and printed in\r\nJanuary, 1776. Intrinsically considered, Common Sense was indeed no\r\ngreat performance. The matter, thin at best, was neither profoundly nor\r\nsubtly reasoned; the manner could hardly be described by even the most\r\ncomplacent critic as humane or engaging. Yet Common Sense had its brief\r\nhour of fame. Its good fortune was to come at the psychological moment;\r\nand being everywhere read during the months from January to July, 1776,\r\nit was precisely suited to convince men, not so much that they ought to\r\ndeclare independence, as that they ought to declare it gladly, ought\r\nto cast off lightly their former false and mawkish affection for the\r\n\"mother country\" and once for all to make an end of backward yearning\r\nlooks over the shoulder at this burning Sodom.\r\n\r\nTo a militant patriot like Thomas Paine it was profoundly humiliating\r\nto recall that for ten years past Americans had professed themselves\r\n\"humble and loyal subjects\" and \"dutiful children,\" yielding to none in\r\n\"admiration\" for the \"excellent British Constitution,\" desiring only to\r\nlive and die as free citizens under the protecting wing of the mother\r\ncountry. Recalling all this sickening sentimentalism, Mr. Paine uttered\r\na loud and ringing Bosh! Let us clear our minds of cant, he said in\r\neffect, and ask ourselves what is the nature of government in general\r\nand of the famous British Constitution in particular. Like the Abbé\r\nSieyès, Mr. Paine had completely mastered the science of government,\r\nwhich was in fact extremely simple. Men form societies, he said,\r\nto satisfy their wants, and then find that governments have to\r\nbe established to restrain their wickedness; and therefore, since\r\ngovernment is obviously a necessary evil, that government is best which\r\nis simplest.\r\n\r\nJust consider then this \"excellent British Constitution,\" and say\r\nwhether it is simple. On the contrary, it is the most complicated,\r\nirrational, and ridiculous contrivance ever devised as a government of\r\nenlightened men. Its admirers say that this complexity is a virtue, on\r\naccount of the nice balance of powers between King, Lords, and Commons,\r\nwhich guarantees a kind of liberty through the resulting inertia of the\r\nwhole. The Lords check the Commons and the Commons check the King. But\r\nhow comes it that the King needs to be checked? Can he not be trusted?\r\nThis is really the secret of the whole business--that Monarchy naturally\r\ntends to despotism; so that the complication of the British Constitution\r\nis a virtue only because its basic principle is false and vicious. If\r\nAmericans still accept the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, well\r\nand good; if not, then in Heaven's name let them cease to bow down in\r\nabject admiration of the British Constitution!\r\n\r\nAnd in ceasing to admire the British Constitution, Americans should\r\nalso, Thomas Paine thought, give up that other fatal error, the\r\nsuperstition that up to the present unhappy moment the colonies had\r\nderived great benefits from living under the protecting wing of the\r\nmother country. Protection! \"We have boasted the protection of\r\nGreat Britain, without considering that her motive was interest not\r\nattachment; and that she did not protect us from our enemies on our own\r\naccount, but from her enemies on her own account, from those who have no\r\nquarrel with us on any other account, and who will always be our enemies\r\non the same account.\" An odd sort of protection that, which served\r\nonly to entangle the colonies in the toils of European intrigues and\r\nrivalries, and to make enemies of those who would otherwise be friends!\r\n\"Our duty to mankind at large, as well as to ourselves, instructs us to\r\nrenounce the alliance: because, any submission to, or dependence upon,\r\nGreat Britain, tends directly to involve this continent in European wars\r\nand quarrels, and set us at variance with nations who would otherwise\r\nseek our friendship and against whom we have neither anger nor\r\ncomplaint.\"\r\n\r\nWhat foolishness then to seek reconciliation, even if it were possible!\r\nReconciliation at this stage would be the ruin of America. If King\r\nGeorge were indeed clever, he would eagerly repeal all the obnoxious\r\nacts and make every concession; for when the colonies had once become\r\nreconciled he could accomplish by \"craft and subtlety, in the long run,\r\nwhat he cannot do by force and violence in the short one.\" The colonies,\r\nhaving come to maturity, cannot always remain subject to tutelage; like\r\nthe youth who has reached his majority, they must sooner or later go\r\ntheir own way. Why not now? Beware of reconciliation and of all those\r\nwho advocate it, for they are either \"interested men, who are not to be\r\ntrusted, weak men who cannot see, prejudiced men who will not see, or a\r\ncertain set of moderate men who think better of the European world than\r\nit deserves.\"\r\n\r\nSuch arguments were indeed precisely suited to convince men that\r\nindependence, so far from being an event in which they had become\r\nentangled by the fatal network of circumstance, was an event which they\r\nfreely willed. \"Read by almost every American, and recommended as a work\r\nreplete with truth, against which none but the partial and prejudiced\r\ncan form any objection, ... it satisfied multitudes that it is their\r\ntrue interest immediately to cut the Gordian knot by which the ...\r\ncolonists have been bound to Great Britain, and to open their commerce,\r\nas an independent people, to all the nations of the world.\" In April and\r\nMay, after the Congress had opened the ports, the tide set strongly and\r\nirresistibly in the direction of the formal declaration. \"Every post\r\nand every day rolls in upon us,\" John Adams said, \"Independence like a\r\ntorrent.\" It was on the 7th of June that Richard Henry Lee, in behalf\r\nof the Virginia delegation and in obedience to the instructions from the\r\nVirginia Convention, moved \"that these United Colonies are, and of\r\nright ought to be, free and independent States ...; that it is expedient\r\nforthwith to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign\r\nAlliances; ... and that a plan of confederation be prepared and\r\ntransmitted to the respective Colonies for their consideration and\r\napprobation.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"resolution respecting independency,\" debated at length, was\r\npostponed till the 1st of July, when it was again brought up for\r\nconsideration. It was still, on that day, opposed by many, chiefly by\r\nJohn Dickinson, who now said that he should not be against independence\r\nultimately, but that he could not consent to it at the present moment\r\nbecause it would serve to divide rather than to unite the colonies. At\r\nthe close of the debate on the 1st of July, there seemed little prospect\r\nof carrying the resolution by a unanimous vote. The Delaware deputies\r\nwere evenly divided, the third member, Cæsar Rodney, not being at the\r\nmoment in Philadelphia; the Pennsylvania deputies were opposed to the\r\nresolution, three against two; while the New York and South Carolina\r\ndeputies were not in a position to vote at all, having, as they said,\r\nno instructions. The final vote was therefore again postponed until the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nWhich of the deputies slept this night is not known. But it is known\r\nthat Cæsar Rodney, hastily summoned, mounted his horse and rode\r\npost-haste to Philadelphia, arriving in time to cast the vote of\r\nDelaware in favor of independence; it is known that John Dickinson\r\nand Robert Morris remained away from Independence Hall, and that James\r\nWilson changed his mind and voted with Franklin and Morton; and it is\r\nknown that the South Carolina deputies came somehow to the conclusion,\r\nover night, that their instructions were after all sufficient. Thus\r\nit was that on July 2, 1776, twelve colonies voted that \"these United\r\nColonies are, and of right ought to be, Free and Independent States.\"\r\nOne week later, the New York deputies, having been properly instructed,\r\ncast the vote of their colony for the resolution also.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a committee had been appointed to prepare a formal\r\ndeclaration, setting forth the circumstances and the motives which might\r\njustify them, in the judgment of mankind, in taking this momentous step.\r\nThe committee had many meetings to discuss the matter, and, when the\r\nmain points had been agreed upon, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were\r\ninstructed to \"draw them up in form, and clothe them in a proper dress.\"\r\nMany years afterwards, in 1822, John Adams related, as accurately as he\r\ncould, the conversation which took place when these two met to perform\r\nthe task assigned them. \"Jefferson proposed to me to make the draught. I\r\nsaid, 'I will not.' 'You should do it.' 'Oh! no.' 'Why will you not?\r\nYou ought to do it.' 'I will not.' 'Why?' 'Reasons enough.' 'What can be\r\nyour reasons?' 'Reason first--You are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought\r\nto appear at the head of this business. Reason second--I am obnoxious,\r\nsuspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third--You\r\ncan write ten times better than I can.' 'Well,' said Jefferson, 'if you\r\nare decided, I will do as well as I can.'\" In some such manner as\r\nthis it came about that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, no doubt doing, as he said, the best he could.\r\n\r\nIt is the judgment of posterity that Mr. Jefferson did very well--which\r\nwas doubtless due partly to the fact that he could write, if not ten\r\ntimes better, at least better than John Adams. Yet the happy phrasing of\r\na brief paragraph or two could scarcely by itself have won so much fame\r\nfor the author; and perhaps much of the success of this famous paper\r\ncame from the circumstance that ten years of controversy over the\r\nquestion of political rights had forced Americans to abandon, step by\r\nstep, the restricted ground of the positive and prescriptive rights of\r\nEnglishmen and to take their stand on the broader ground of the natural\r\nand inherent rights of man. To have said, \"We hold this truth to\r\nbe self-evident: that all Englishmen are endowed by the British\r\nConstitution with the customary right of taxing themselves internally\"\r\nwould probably have made no great impression on the sophisticated\r\nEuropean mind. It was Thomas Jefferson's good fortune, in voicing the\r\nprevailing sentiment in America, to give classic expression to those\r\nfundamental principles of a political faith which was destined, in the\r\ncourse of a hundred years, to win the allegiance of the greater part of\r\nthe western world.\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created\r\nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable\r\nRights, that among these, are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nHappiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among\r\nMen, deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed. That,\r\nwhenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is\r\nthe Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new\r\nGovernment, laying its foundation on such Principles and organizing its\r\nPowers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their\r\nSafety and Happiness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to these principles--for a generation somewhat obscured, it must\r\nbe confessed, by the Shining Sword and the Almighty Dollar, by the\r\nlengthening shadow of Imperialism and the soporific haze of Historic\r\nRights and the Survival of the Fittest--it is to these principles, these\r\n\"glittering generalities,\" that the minds of men are turning again in\r\nthis day of desolation as a refuge from the cult of efficiency and from\r\nfaith in \"that which is just by the judgment of experience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\nContemporary Writings; Many of the most important documents for this\r\nperiod are in the following brief collections: W.

One version is the Abraham Lincoln edition\r\nof the series, a premium version which includes pictures. A textbook\r\nedition was also produced, which does not contain the pictures and\r\ncaptions associated with the pictures, but is otherwise the same book.\r\nThis book was produced to match the textbook edition of the book. We\r\nhave retained the original punctuation and spelling in the book, but\r\nthere are a few exceptions. Obvious errors were corrected--and all of\r\nthese changes can be found in the Detailed Notes Section of these notes.\r\nThe Detailed Notes Section also includes issues that have come up during\r\nthe transcription process. One common issue is that words are sometimes\r\nsplit into two lines for spacing purposes. These words are hyphenated in\r\nthe physical book, but there is a question sometimes as to whether the\r\nhyphen should be retained in transcription. The reasons behind some of\r\nthese decisions are itemized.\r\n\r\nDetailed Notes Section:\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II • Page 25: While \"indico\" should be spelled \"indigo,\" the\r\nword is quoted from a budget and the spelling from the source document\r\nis retained. • Page 25: While \"herba\" should be spelled \"herbs,\" the\r\nword is quoted from a budget and the spelling from the source document\r\nis retained. • Page 27: Hundred-weight is hyphenated and split between\r\ntwo lines for spacing. No other word of similar nature appears in\r\nthe document. The hyphen was not used in transcription: \"twenty-two\r\nshillings per hundredweight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III • Page 67 and Page 69: Back-country was hyphenated and split\r\nbetween two lines for spacing. On Page 67, the same word was used with\r\na hyphen in the middle of a line in the clause: \"there came from the\r\nback-country...\" Therefore, the hyphen was retained in the two places\r\nin question: \"as in all the back-country counties,\" (Page 67) and\r\n\"followers in the back-country.\" (Page 69) • Page 76: There appears to\r\nbe missing quotes around the introductory clause attributed to Jonathan\r\nSewell in page 76: [We read the resolutions, said Jonathan Sewell,...].\r\nIn the Preface, Becker cautioned that he would use an unorthodox method\r\nof telling the story to give \"quality and texture of the state of mind\r\nand feeling of an individual or class.\" As transcribers, we will simply\r\nsay that the quotation marks here match those in the printed book, and\r\nthus, we assume that Becker intended to leave the introductory clause of\r\nSewell unquoted for subtle reasons implied in the Preface.\r\n\r\nChapter IV • Page 124: coffee-house was hyphenated and split between two\r\nlines for spacing. On Page 93, \"coffee house\" was split into two words\r\nfor \"Mr. Howard's coffee house.\" The hyphen was retained in the clause\r\n\"for the coffee-house retailers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V • Page 159: firm-set is hyphenated and split between two lines\r\nfor spacing. The hyphen was retained in the clause \"eyes flashing and\r\nmouth firm-set.\" • Page 163: worn-out is hyphenated and split between\r\ntwo lines for spacing. The hyphen was retained in the clause \"or\r\ncreaking of worn-out institutions.\" • Page 182: changed double quotes\r\nto single quotes when transcribing: [of the 'present disturbed and\r\ndisordered state' of government], because this clause is embedded within\r\na quotation. • Page 196: Placed a semi-colon after them; the punctuation\r\nmark is unclear in my copy of the book. \"Samuel Adams probably preferred\r\nnot to be forced to print them; knowing their contents, ...\"",
