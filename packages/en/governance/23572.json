De Tocqueville is one of the greatest, perhaps the very greatest, of\r\nthe political philosophers of the present day. Alone of all his\r\ncontemporaries, his best works will bear a comparison with those of\r\nMachiavelli and Bacon. Less caustic and condensed than Tacitus, less\r\nimaginative and eloquent than Burke, he possesses the calm judgment, the\r\ndiscriminating eye, and the just reflection, which have immortalised the\r\nFlorentine statesman and the English philosopher. Born and bred in the\r\nmidst of the vehement strife of parties in his own country, placed\r\nmidway, as it were, between the ruins of feudal and the reconstruction\r\nof modern society in France, he has surveyed the contest with an\r\nimpartial gaze. He has brought to the examination of republican\r\ninstitutions in the United States, the eye of calm reason and the powers\r\nof philosophic reflection. The war-cries, the illusions, the\r\nassociations of neither party have been able to disturb his steady mind.\r\nThough a man of rank, descended, as his name indicates, of an ancient\r\nfamily, he is not bigoted in favour of the old regime; though belonging\r\nto a profession where strenuous efforts can alone ensure success, he is\r\nnot blind to the dangers of the new order of things. The feudal ages,\r\nwith their dignified manners, glorious episodes, and heart-stirring\r\nrecollections, are not lost upon him, but they have not closed his eyes\r\nto the numerous evils which they brought in their train. Modern times,\r\nwith their general activity, vast achievements, and boundless\r\nanticipations, have produced their full effect on his thoughtful mind;\r\nbut they have not rendered him insensible to the perils with which they\r\nare fraught. He is a Burke without his imagination--a Machiavelli\r\nwithout his crimes.\r\n\r\nM. De Tocqueville, it is well known, is a firm believer in the progress\r\nof society to a general system of equality and popular government. He\r\nthinks that, for better or for worse, this tendency is inevitable; that\r\nall efforts to resist it are vain, and that true wisdom consists in\r\naccommodating ourselves to the new order of things, and making the\r\ntransition with as little confusion and individual distress as may be.\r\nAmerica he considers as the type of what Europe is to become; though he\r\nhas grievous misgivings as to the final result of such a prostration of\r\nthe great interests of society as has there taken place, and is too\r\nwell-read a scholar not to know that it was in the institutions of the\r\nByzantine empire that a similar levelling resulted in ancient times. But\r\nbeing thus a devout believer, if not in the doctrine of perfectibility,\r\nat least in that of ceaseless progress towards democracy, his opinions\r\nare of the highest value when he portrays the perils with which the new\r\norder of things is attended. Alone of all the moderns, he has fixed the\r\npublic attention upon the real danger of purely republican institutions;\r\nhe first has discerned in their working in America, where it is that the\r\nlasting peril is to be apprehended. Passing by the bloodshed, suffering,\r\nand confiscations with which the transition from aristocratic ascendency\r\nto democratic power is necessarily attended, he has examined with a\r\nscrutinising eye the practical working of the latter system in the\r\nUnited States, where it had been long established and was in pacific\r\nundisputed sovereignty. He has demonstrated that in such circumstances,\r\nit is not the _weakness_ but the _strength_ of the ruling power in the\r\nstate which is the great danger, and that the many-headed despot, acting\r\nby means of a subservient press and servile juries, speedily becomes as\r\nformidable to real freedom as ever Eastern sultaun with his despotic\r\npower and armed guards has proved.\r\n\r\nThe works of this very eminent writer, however, are by no means of equal\r\nmerit. The last two volumes of his \"Democratie en Amerique\" are much\r\ninferior to the first. In the latter, he sketched out with a master\r\nhand, when fresh from the object of his study, the practical working of\r\ndemocratic institutions, when entirely free from all the impediments\r\nwhich, it was alleged, concealed or thwarted their operation in the Old\r\nWorld. He delineated the results of the republican principle in a new\r\nstate, without a hereditary nobility, established church, or national\r\ndebt; unfettered by primogeniture, pauperism, or previous misgovernment;\r\nsurrounded by boundless lands of exceeding fertility, with all the\r\npowers of European knowledge to bring them into cultivation, and all the\r\nenergy of the Anglo-Saxon race to carry out the mission of Japhet--to\r\nreplenish the earth and subdue it. The world had never seen, probably\r\nthe world will never again see, the democratic principle launched into\r\nactivity under such favourable circumstances, and when its practical\r\neffect, for good or for evil, could with so much accuracy and certainty\r\nbe discerned. The study and delineation of such an experiment, in such\r\ncircumstances, and on such a scale, by a competent observer, must have\r\nbeen an object of the highest interest at any time; but what must it be\r\nwhen that observer is a man of the capacity and judgment of M. De\r\nTocqueville?\r\n\r\nThe latter volumes of the same work, however, have dipped into more\r\ndoubtful matters, and have brought forward more questionable opinions.\r\nThe inquisitive mind, philosophic turn, and deep reflection of the\r\nauthor, indeed, are every where conspicuous; but his opinions do not\r\nequally as in the first two volumes bear the signet mark of truth\r\nstamped upon them. They are more speculative and fanciful; founded\r\nrather on contemplation of future, than observation of present effects.\r\nWhen De Tocqueville painted the unrestrained working of democracy on\r\npolitical thought and parties, as he saw it around him in the course of\r\nhis residence in America, he drew a picture which all, in circumstances\r\nat all similar, must at once have recognised as trustworthy, because it\r\nwas only an extension of what they had witnessed in their own vicinity.\r\nBut when he extended these effects so far as he has done in his later\r\nvolumes, to manners, opinions, habits, and the intercourse of the sexes,\r\nthe attempt seemed overstrained. The theory, beyond all question just to\r\na certain point, was pushed too far. M. De Tocqueville's great\r\nreputation, accordingly, has been somewhat impaired by the publication\r\nof his last two volumes on democracy in America; and it is to the first\r\ntwo that the philosophic student most frequently recurs for light on the\r\npractical working of the popular system.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, there is another, and a still more cogent, reason why the\r\nreputation of this philosopher has not continued so general as it at\r\nfirst was. This is his _impartiality_. Both the great parties which\r\ndivide the world turned to his work on its first appearance with\r\navidity, in the hope of discovering something favourable to their\r\nrespective views. Neither were disappointed. Both found numerous facts\r\nand observations of the very highest importance, and having a material\r\nbearing on the points at issue between them. Enchanted with the\r\ndiscovery, each raised an _Io Paean_; and in the midst of a chorus of\r\npraise from liberals and conservatives, M. De Tocqueville took his place\r\nas the first political philosopher of the age. But in process of time,\r\nboth discovered something in his opinions which they would rather had\r\nbeen omitted. The popular party were displeased at seeing it proved that\r\nthe great and virtuous middle classes of society could establish a\r\ndespotism as complete, and more irresistible, than any sultaun of Asia:\r\nthe aristocratic, at finding the opinion of the author not disguised\r\nthat the tendency to democracy was irresistible, and that, for good or\r\nfor evil, it had irrevocably set in upon human affairs. But present\r\ncelebrity is seldom a test of future fame; in matters of thought and\r\nreflection, scarcely ever so. What makes a didactic author popular at\r\nthe moment is, the coincidence of his opinions with those of his\r\nreaders, in the main, and the tracing them out to some consequences as\r\nyet new to them. What gives him fame with futurity is, his having boldly\r\nresisted general delusions, and violently, and to the great vexation of\r\nhis contemporaries, first demonstrated the erroneous nature of many of\r\ntheir opinions, which subsequent experience has shewn to be false.\r\n\"Present and future time,\" says Sir Joshua Reynolds, \"are rivals; he who\r\npays court to the one, must lay his account with being discountenanced\r\nby the other.\" We augur the more favourably for M. De Tocqueville's\r\nlasting fame, from his being no longer quoted by party writers on either\r\nside of the questions which divide society.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville calls the history he has recently published, and which\r\nforms the subject of this article,--\"A _Philosophic_ History of the\r\nReign of Louis XV.\"[2] We regret the title: we have an instinctive\r\naversion to _soi-disant_ philosophic histories. Those that really are\r\nso, invariably shun the name. Robertson, in his first volume of Charles\r\nV.; Guizot in his \"Civilisation Europeenne;\" Sismondi, in his \"Essais\r\nsur les Sciences Sociales,\" and the last volume of his \"Republiques\r\nItaliennes,\" have carried the philosophy of history to the highest\r\nperfection; but none of them thought of calling their immortal works\r\n\"Philosophic Histories.\" Schlegel has written an admirable book not\r\nimproperly styled \"the _Philosophy_ of History;\" but it avowedly is not\r\na history, but a review of the general conclusions which seemed\r\ndeducible from it. Bossuet entitled his celebrated work, \"Histoire\r\nUniverselle,\" without a word of philosophy. In truth, philosophy, though\r\na corollary from history, is not its primary object. That is, and ever\r\nmust be, the narrative of human events. Not but what the noblest and\r\nmost important lessons of philosophy may and should be deduced from\r\nhistory; but they should be _deduced_, not made the main object of the\r\nwork. The reason is obvious: history is addressed to the great body of\r\nmankind; to most of whom, narrative of event, if told in an agreeable\r\nmanner, may be made an object of interest; but to not one in twenty of\r\nwhom general or philosophic conclusions ever can be a matter of the\r\nsmallest concern. History, in truth, is much more nearly allied to\r\npoetry, oratory, and painting. The drama is but the expansion of its\r\ntouching scenes,--painting, the representation of its fleeting events.\r\nEven to the few who are gifted by nature with the power of abstract\r\nthought, it is often hazardous to push matters to a conclusion too\r\nopenly. Lingard evinced the profound knowledge of the human heart by\r\nwhich the Church of Rome has ever been distinguished, when, in his\r\nskilful narrative, he concealed the Roman Catholic save in the facts\r\nwhich he brought forward. It is well to enlist self-love on the side of\r\ntruth. No conclusions are so readily embraced, as those which the reader\r\nflatters himself he himself has had a large share in drawing. Like the\r\nfamous images which were withheld from the funeral of Junia, they are\r\nonly the more present to the mind that they are withdrawn from the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nPerhaps M. de Tocqueville meant, by prefixing this title to his work, to\r\nprepare his readers for what they were to expect. He does not aim at\r\nmaking a very interesting narrative. Though possessed, as the extracts\r\nwe shall give will abundantly testify, of considerable power of\r\ndescription, and rising at times into strains of touching eloquence, it\r\nis not his object to render his work attractive in either of these ways.\r\nHad it been so, he would have chosen a different subject; he would have\r\nselected the glories of Louis XIV. which preceded the disasters of the\r\nRevolution; the glories of the empire, which followed it. His turn of\r\nmind is not dramatic; he is neither poetic in his imagination, nor\r\npictorial in his description. Considering the close connexion between\r\nthese arts and history, these are very great deficiencies, and must ever\r\nprevent his work from taking its place beside the masterpieces in this\r\ndepartment of literature. It will not bear a comparison with the\r\ndramatic story of Livy, the caustic nerve of Sallust, the profound\r\nobservation of Tacitus, or the pictorial page of Gibbon. But, regarded\r\nas a picture of the moral causes working in society, anterior to a great\r\nand memorable convulsion, it is entitled to the highest praise, and will\r\never be viewed as a most valuable _preliminary volume_ to the most\r\nimportant period of European history.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville possesses one most important quality, in addition to\r\nhis calm judgment and discriminating sagacity. His moral and religious\r\nprinciples are not only unexceptionable, but they are founded on the\r\nsoundest and most enlightened basis. Humane without being\r\nsentimental--moral but not uncharitable--religious but not fanatical--he\r\nsurveys society, its actors and its crimes, with the eve of enlightened\r\nphilanthropy, experienced reason, and Christian charity. He is neither a\r\nfierce, imperious Romish bigot like Bossuet, nor a relentless\r\nCalvinistic theologian like D'Aubigne, nor a scoffing infidel like\r\nVoltaire. Deeply impressed with the vital importance of religion to the\r\ntemporal and eternal welfare of mankind, he is yet enlightened enough to\r\nsee that all systems of religious belief have much to recommend them,\r\nand rejects the monstrous doctrine that salvation can be obtained only\r\nby the members of any particular sect. He sees much good in all\r\nreligions; much evil in many of their supporters. He is a Roman\r\nCatholic; but he is the first to condemn the frightful injustice of the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes; he does not doom the whole members of\r\nthe Church of England to damnation, as so many of our zealous sectarians\r\ndo the adherents of the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable and most consolatory circumstance, that these just\r\nand enlightened views on the subject of religion, and its beneficial\r\ninfluence on society, are now entertained by all the deepest thinkers\r\nand most brilliant writers in France. There is not an intellect which\r\nrises to a certain level now in that country--not a name which will be\r\nknown a hundred years hence, which is not thoroughly _Christian_ in its\r\nprinciples. _That_, at least, is one blessing which has resulted from\r\nthe Revolution. Chateaubriand, Guizot, Lamartine, Vilmain, De\r\nTocqueville, Michelet, Sismondi, Amadee Thierry, Beranger, Barante,\r\nbelong to this bright band. When such men, differing so widely in every\r\nother respect, are leagued together in defence of Christianity, we may\r\nregard as a passing evil whatever profligacy the works of Victor Hugo,\r\nEugene Sue, and Sand, pour forth upon the Parisian world and middle\r\nclasses throughout France. They, no doubt, indicate clearly enough the\r\nstate of general opinion _at this time_. But what then? Their great\r\ncompeers, the giants of thought, foreshadow what it will be. The\r\nprofligate novels, licentious drama, and irreligious opinions of the\r\nmiddle class now in France, are the result of the infidelity and\r\nwickedness which produced the Revolution. The opinions of the great men\r\nwho have succeeded the school of the Encyclopedie, who have been taught\r\nby the suffering it produced, will form the character of a future\r\ngeneration. Public opinion, of which we hear so much, is never any thing\r\nelse than the re-echo of the thoughts of a few great men _half a century\r\nbefore_. It takes that time for ideas to flow down from the elevated to\r\nthe inferior level. The great never adopt, they only originate. Their\r\nchief efforts are always made _in opposition_ to the prevailing\r\nopinions by which they are surrounded. Thence it is that a powerful mind\r\nis always uneasy when it is not in the minority on any subject which\r\nexcites general attention.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Louis XV. is peculiarly favourable for a writer possessed\r\nof the philosophic mind, calm judgment, and contemplative turn of M. de\r\nTocqueville. It was then that the many causes which concurred to produce\r\nthe Revolution were brought to maturity. We say _brought to maturity_:\r\nfor, great as were the corruptions, enormous the profligacy of that\r\nreign, and of the regency which preceded it, it would be absurd to\r\nsuppose that it was during them alone that the causes which produced the\r\nterrible convulsion began to operate. They were only brought to\r\nmaturity--but the catastrophe undoubtedly was accelerated by the vices\r\nthat succeeded the reign of Louis XIV., not so much by the evils they\r\ninflicted on the people, as by the corruption which they spread among\r\nthe defenders of the throne. They paralysed the nobility by the fatal\r\ngangrene of individual selfishness; they prostrated thought by diverting\r\nit almost entirely to wicked and licentious purposes. Intellect, instead\r\nof being the guardian of order, the protector of religion, the supporter\r\nof morality, became their most fatal enemy; for its powers--and they\r\nwere gigantic in that age--were all devoted to the spread of infidelity,\r\nthe ridicule of virtue, the fomenting of passion. It is in this\r\n_debauchery of the public mind_ by the example of royal and noble\r\nprofligacy, and the power of vigorous and perverted talent, that the\r\nreal causes of the Revolution are to be found. The working classes of\r\nthemselves can never overturn a state--if they could, England would have\r\nbeen revolutionised in 1832. They may make a _Jacquerie_, but they\r\ncannot make a revolution. They may rear up a Jack Cade, a Wat Tyler, or\r\na Jacques Bonhomme, but they will never produce a Robespierre or a\r\nCromwell. It is the _coincidence_ of general evils that make all the\r\npeople feel sore, with corrupted manners, and licentious or selfish\r\nwriters who make their leaders _think wrong_, which can alone overturn\r\nsociety. The first furnishes the private soldier, the last the officers\r\nto the army of revolution; or, what is the same thing, they withdraw\r\nthem from that of religion and order.\r\n\r\nThe latter years of Louis XV. were so completely sunk in shameless\r\ndebaucheries, the glory of France had been so long tarnished by the\r\nwretched choice which his mistresses had made of ministers to rule the\r\nstate and generals to lead the armies, that the world has not\r\nunnaturally come to entertain an opinion in many respects exaggerated or\r\nerroneous, of his character. He had many good points; at first he was an\r\nunexceptionable sovereign. Though bred up in the licentious school of\r\nthe Regent Orleans, he led in the outset a comparatively blameless life.\r\nThe universal grief which seized the nation when he lay at the point of\r\ndeath at Metz, in 1744, proves to what extent he had then won the hearts\r\nof his subjects. His person was fine and well-proportioned; his manners\r\nwere grace personified; he possessed considerable penetration when his\r\nnative indolence would permit him to attend to public affairs; and he\r\nwas not destitute, like his predecessor Charles VI., when roused by\r\nnecessity, or the entreaties of a high-minded and generous mistress, of\r\nnoble and heroic qualities. His conduct at Foutenoy, and during the few\r\noccasions when he made war in person, in company with Marshal Saxe,\r\nsufficiently proved this. Nay, what is still more extraordinary, he was\r\nat first a model of conjugal fidelity. Though married at nineteen to his\r\nQueen, Marie Leczinska, daughter of the king of Poland, who was six\r\nyears older than himself, and possessed of no remarkable personal\r\nattractions, he resisted for long all the arts of the ladies of the\r\ncourt, who were vieing with each other for his homage, saying constantly\r\nto those who urged the beauty of any one upon him, \"the Queen is\r\nhandsomer.\" The Queen had already borne him nine children, before a\r\nsuspicion even of his infidelities came to be entertained; and he was\r\nled into them at first, rather by the efforts of those around him than\r\nhis own inclination. So timid was his disposition in these respects in\r\nearly years--so strong the religious scruples to which throughout life\r\nhe continued subject, that, on the first occasion on which he obtained\r\nan interview with his future mistress, Madame de Chateauroux, the visit\r\npassed over without the desired result, and on the second his valet had,\r\nliterally speaking, to throw him into her arms. \"C'est le premier pas\r\nqui coute.\" He became less scrupulous in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nOf the Regent Orleans, who succeeded Louis XIV. in the government, and\r\npreceded Louis XV. in its abuse, M. de Tocqueville gives the following\r\nmasterly character:--\r\n\r\n\"Nature had bestowed on the Duke of Orleans all those gifts which\r\nusually captivate mankind. His physiognomy was agreeable and\r\nprepossessing: to a natural eloquence he joined uncommon sweetness of\r\nmanner. Brave, full of liveliness, his penetration was never at fault,\r\nand his abilities would have procured for him distinction at the head of\r\ncouncils or armies. Those Who were about his person became attached to\r\nhim, because they found him amiable and indulgent. They lamented his\r\nfaults, without ceasing to love him, carried away by the graces of his\r\ncharacter and amiability of his manners, which recalled, they said,\r\nthose of his grandfather, Henry IV. He had the good fortune, rare in\r\nprinces, to preserve his friends to the hour of his death. He readily\r\nforgave offences and pardoned injuries. But the mind endowed with so\r\nmany amiable qualities was destitute of that which can alone develop or\r\nturn them to good account--he had no force of character. Without the\r\nenergy which prompts crime, he was equally without that which leads to\r\nvirtue. After having lost his first preceptor, his ill fortune placed\r\nhim in the hands of Dubois, the most corrupt of men. This Dubois, the\r\nson of an apothecary of Brives-la-Gaillarde, founded his hopes of\r\nfortune on the entire demoralisation of the prince committed to his\r\ncare. Inspired by the genius of vice, he divined and encouraged the\r\nvices of others, and above all of his master. He taught him to believe\r\nthat virtue is but a mask worn by hypocrisy, a chimera on which no one\r\ncan rely in the business of life; that religion is a political\r\ninvention, of use only to the lower people; that all men are cheats and\r\ndeceivers, and pretended rectitude a mere cover for intended villany.\r\nMadame, the mother of the Regent, early discovered the character of this\r\ndetestable man. 'My son,' said she, 'I desire nothing but the good of\r\nthe state and your glory: I ask but one thing for your safety, and I\r\ndemand your word of honour for it--it is never to employ that scoundrel\r\nthe Abbe Dubois--the greatest miscreant on the earth: who would at any\r\ntime sacrifice the state and you to the slightest interest of his own.'\r\nThe Duke of Orleans gave his word accordingly, but he was not long of\r\nbreaking it. Shortly after, he made Dubois a councillor of state. The\r\ndebaucheries into which that man impelled him soon became all\r\nindispensable distraction for that soft and enervated mind, to which the\r\n_ennui_ of a court was insupportable. He loved its scandal and\r\nrumours--even the report of incest was not displeasing to him. Every\r\nevening, he assembled his _roues_, his mistresses, some _danseuses_ from\r\nthe Opera, often his daughter the Duchess de Berri,[3] and some persons\r\nof obscure birth, but brilliant for their talent or renowned for their\r\nvices. At these suppers the choicest viands, the finest wines,\r\nexhilarated the guests, all the disorders and scandal of court and the\r\ncity were passed in review. They drank, they became intoxicated; the\r\nconversation became licentious; impieties of every sort issued from\r\nevery mouth. At last, fatigued with satiety, the party was broken up:\r\nthose who could walk retired to rest; the others were carried to\r\nbed;--and the next evening a similar scene was renewed.\"--(Vol. i. pp.\r\n22-24.)\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived what an effect manners such as these pervading the\r\nhead of a court, already sufficiently inclined to excitement and\r\ngratification, must have had upon the general tone of morals among the\r\nhigher ranks. M. de Tocqueville portrays it in strong colours, but not\r\nstronger we believe than the truth:--\r\n\r\n\"The disorders of its head spread to all the branches of the royal\r\nfamily. There was not a princess who had not her lover--not a prince who\r\nhad not his mistresses. This system soon descended from the palace to\r\nthe hotels of the nobles. Conjugal fidelity was considered as a\r\nprejudice, fit only to be the subject of ridicule. Adultery became the\r\nfashion, intemperance a path to distinction--the seduction of women was\r\ndeemed the great object of life, and conquests in that line were sought\r\nas the highest glory; minds absorbed in the frivolous pursuits of a man\r\n_a bonnes fortunes_, became incapable of attention to serious affairs.\r\nWhen a young woman appeared in the world, no inquiries were made as to\r\nthe union which prevailed in her establishment, the sole point was what\r\nlover they were to give her. The men with pretensions in that line, the\r\ncorrupted women, entered into a league to plunge her into crime; and in\r\nthat abominable lottery, they fixed beforehand on the person to whom she\r\nwas to fall. The example of the Duchess de Berri obtained many\r\nimitators. Sometimes devotion was mingled with debauchery, as if a\r\nfeeble struggle was still kept up between the recollections of the past\r\nand the seductions of the present. Women of gallantry, ambitious\r\ndebauchees, passed from their orgies to the cloister; and the abstinence\r\nof penitence furnished some respite to the pleasure of the world and the\r\nagitations of politics. Such was the society of the great world, under\r\nthe regency. The impulse given to vice during that period, continued\r\nthrough that which followed it. Neither the good example given by Louis\r\nXV., during the first years of his youth, nor the grave habits of\r\nCardinal de Fleury, could avail as a barrier to the inundation. It only\r\nabated something of its audacity; more veiled, it excited less public\r\nscandal.\"--(Vol. i. p. 31.)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that in any country, but most of all in a monarchical\r\nand in aristocratic one, such manners can exist in the higher ranks,\r\nwithout inducing a total depravity of general thought, and perversion of\r\nthe power of mind. Talent, often the most venal of venal things, follows\r\nin the wake of corruption. Covetous of gain, thirsting for patronage, it\r\nfans, instead of lowering, the passions by which all hope to profit.\r\nWhenever prevailing vices have set in upon a nation, be they such as\r\nspring from a monarchical, an aristocratic, or a democratic regime, the\r\ngreat majority of its abilities will do nothing but encourage its\r\nexcesses, because it is there alone they can gain profit. A few great\r\nand generous minds will probably set themselves to resist the torrent,\r\nand they may produce a great effect upon a future age; but in their own,\r\nthey are almost sure to meet with nothing but ridicule, abuse, and\r\nneglect. We see this deplorable subservience of talent, even of a very\r\nhigh cast, to the taste of the majority holding preferment in their\r\nhands, around us in Great Britain at this time; and the same evil was\r\nexperienced in an equal degree in France during the whole course of the\r\nreign of Louis XV. and his virtuous but ill-fated successor.\r\n\r\n\"The reign,\" says Tocqueville, \"of Louis XIV. finished: that of Louis\r\nXV. commenced. During its course we shall see every thing change: of old\r\nforms there will remain only the shadow. Never was alteration more\r\ncomplete among mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\"In lieu of lofty thoughts, and their serious expression, will appear a\r\nsterile futility. An incurable frivolity will get possession of the high\r\nsociety, and come entirely to direct thought. Licentiousness of language\r\nwill accompany wicked manners, and lend a seduction the more to vice.\r\nLibertinism becomes the fashion. Impiety _a la mode_, miserable\r\nvanities, will supplant a noble pride to achieve a reputation in\r\nletters: it will become necessary to raise a doubt, wherever truth has\r\nbeen admitted. Amidst the din of feasts and the music of the ball-room,\r\nthey will sap the foundations of religion, morality, and society. They\r\nwill call themselves philanthropic, they will declaim on humanity--at\r\nthe very moment that they are taking from the people the consolations\r\nwhich render supportable the miseries of life, and the religious curb\r\nwhich suspends wrath and restrains vengeance. It is thus, also, that\r\nthey will obtain the envied title of philosophy, and merit the\r\nprotection of the great; for they, too, will desire the reputation of\r\n_Esprits forts_. All will give way together. In war, no more great\r\ngenerals. The pulpit will no longer resound with the illustrious\r\norators, whose words seemed to descend from divine inspiration.\r\nStatesmen will be without elevation: instead of able men, mere\r\nintriguers: the influence of talent will be replaced by the influence of\r\ncoteries. Business will be treated of in boudoirs, and decided according\r\nto the caprice of abandoned women. They will dispose of administrations,\r\nlower politics to the level of their own minds, and even ecclesiastical\r\ndignities will depend on their patronage. As a consequence of that\r\ngeneral debasement, an unmeasured disdain will arise in the inferior\r\nclasses of all that is great in the state. Doubt will be applauded, and\r\nit will extend to the power of the king, the noblesse, and the clergy.\r\nThe spirit of investigation and analysis will replace the flights of the\r\nimagination. Men will sound the depths of that power which they have\r\nceased to regard with respect. The authorities of the earth will not be\r\nsufficiently respected to make them look up to them--they must bring\r\nthem down to their own level, and look below them. A terrible reaction\r\nwill arise--the result of old rancours to which general feeling will no\r\nlonger oppose any barrier. On all sides will spring up the ideas of\r\nliberty and independence. Meanwhile the redoubtable progress of a\r\nrevolution, which is advancing, will escape the observation of those\r\nwhom it is to swallow up; for the frivolity of their lives, and the\r\nvacancy of their thoughts, will have deprived them of all\r\nforesight.\"--(Vol. i. p. 22.)\r\n\r\nThe courage with which the French church frequently denounced the vices\r\nand corruptions in high places with which it was surrounded, has always\r\nbeen one of the most honourable features of its glorious annals.\r\nMassillon, in the corrupted days of the regency, was not behind\r\nBourdalone and Bossuet and Fenelon, in the time of Louis XIV., in the\r\ndischarge of this noble duty:--\r\n\r\n\"When Massillon ascended the pulpit to instruct the young king, he\r\nthreatened with the wrath of God the great on the earth who violated his\r\ncommandments, and the Regent manifested no displeasure: conscience had\r\npalsied his mind. Never had religion been more sublime,--never did she\r\nappear clothed in more magnificent language. To the profound corruption\r\nof the court, the preacher opposed the example of the little and the\r\nweak; to their pride, the virtue of the poor, and its omnipotence in the\r\nsight of God. 'If Providence permits,' said he, 'the elevation of some\r\nunworthy characters, it is that they may be rendered useful to others.\r\nAll power comes from God, and is established only for the use of man.\r\nThe great would be useless on the earth if they were not surrounded by\r\nthe poor and the indigent; they owe their elevation to the public\r\nnecessities; and, so far are the people from being made for them, it is\r\nthey who are made for the people. It is the people who give the great\r\nthe right which they have to approach the throne; and it is for the\r\npeople that the throne itself has been raised. In a word, the great and\r\nthe princes are but, as it were, the men of the people: thence it is\r\nthat the prosperity of the great and their ministers, and of the\r\nsovereigns who have been the oppressors of the people, has never brought\r\nany thing but shame, ignominy, and maledictions to their descendants. We\r\nhave seen issue from that stem of iniquity the shameless shoots which\r\nhave been the disgrace of their name and of their age. The Lord has\r\nbreathed upon the heaps of their ill-gotten riches; he has dispersed\r\nthem as the dust: if he yet leaves on the earth the remnants of their\r\nrace, it is that they may remain an eternal monument of his vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"'The glory of a conqueror will be always stained with blood:--He passes\r\nlike a torrent over the earth, only to devastate it, and not as a\r\nmajestic river which brings joy and abundance. The remembrance of his\r\nreign will recall only the recollection of the evils he has inflicted on\r\nhumanity. The people suffer always from the vices of their sovereign.\r\nWhatever exaggerates authority, vilifies or degrades it; princes, ruled\r\nby their passions, are always pernicious and bizarre masters. Government\r\nhas no longer a ruler when its head has none.\r\n\r\n\"'The Lord has ever blown on the haughty races and withered their roots.\r\nThe prosperity of the impious has never passed to their descendants.\r\nThrones themselves, and royal succession have failed, to effeminate and\r\nworthless princes; and the history of the crimes and excess of the great\r\nis, at the same time, the history of their misfortunes and of their\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\"'Prince's and sovereigns cannot be great but in rendering themselves\r\nuseful to the people--in bringing them, like Jesus Christ, abundance and\r\npeace. The liberty which princes owe to their people, is the liberty of\r\nthe laws. You know only God above you, it is true; but the laws should\r\nhave an authority even superior to yourselves.\r\n\r\n\"'A great man--a prince--is not born for himself alone. He owes himself\r\nto his subjects. The people, in elevating him, have entrusted him with\r\npower and authority, and have reserved to themselves, in exchange, his\r\ncare, his time, his vigilance. He is a superintendant whom they have\r\nplaced at their head to protect and defend them. It is the people who,\r\nby the order of God, have made them what they are.--Yes, Sire! _It is\r\nthe choice of the nation which has put the sceptre in the hand of your\r\nancestors._ It is it which proclaimed them sovereigns. The kingdom came\r\nin time to be considered as the inheritance of their successors; but\r\nthey owed it at first to the free consent of their subjects, and it was\r\nthe public suffrages which, in the beginning, attached that right and\r\nthat prerogative to their birth. In a word, as their prerogative first\r\nflowed from ourselves, so kings should make no use of their power but\r\nfor us.'\"--(Vol. i. p. 67.)\r\n\r\nSuch was the eloquent and intrepid language in which Massillon addressed\r\nthe Regent Orleans and Louis XV., in the plenitude of their power, in\r\nthe chapel-royal at Versailles. It was a minister of the _established_\r\nchurch, be it recollected, who thundered in those unmeasured terms to\r\nthe prince who held in his hands the whole patronage of the church of\r\nFrance. We should like to see a preacher of the Free and popular\r\ndissenting establishments of Great Britain or America, thunder in\r\nequally intrepid strains on the sins which most easily beset the\r\ndemocratic congregations upon whom their elevation and fortune depend.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing new,\" says the Wise Man, \"under the sun.\" We have seen\r\nenough, of late years, of railway manias, and the almost incredible\r\nanxiety of all classes to realise something in the numerous El Dorados\r\nwhich infatuation or cupidity set afloat in periods of excitement. But,\r\nfrom the following account of De Tocqueville, it appears that a hundred\r\nand thirty years ago the same passions were developed on a still greater\r\nscale in France; and even our ladies of rank and fashion may take a\r\nlesson in these particulars from the marchionesses and countesses of the\r\ncourt of the Regent Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of August 1719, the anxiety to procure shares (in the\r\nMississippi scheme) began to assemble an immense crowd in the street\r\nQuincampoix, where, for many years, the public funds had been bought and\r\nsold. From six in the morning, crowds of people, men and women, rich and\r\npoor, gentlemen and burghers, filled the street and never left it till\r\neight at night. There were spread all sorts of rumours, true or false;\r\nand all the devices of stock-jobbing were put in practice, in order to\r\neffect a rise or fall in the prices. The price of some shares rose to\r\n_six-and-thirty times_ their original value. Their price often varied,\r\nduring the course of a single day, several thousand francs. From this\r\nperilous gambling arose alternately incredible fortunes and total ruins.\r\n\r\n\"The numerous instances which occurred of person who had risen from\r\nnothing and suddenly become possessed of immense wealth, raised the\r\npublic avidity to a perfect frenzy. At that epoch of scandal and\r\nopprobrium, there was no folly or vice in which the high society did not\r\ntake the lead. The degradation of men's minds was equal to the\r\ncorruption of their manners. The courtiers, even the princes of the\r\nblood, besieged the Regent to obtain shares. He flung them among them\r\nwith open hands; and soon they were seen mingling in the crowds of\r\nspeculators, and covetous like them of discreditable gains. 'My son,'\r\nsaid the Regent's mother, 'has given me, for my family, two millions in\r\nshares. The King has taken some millions for his house. The whole royal\r\nfamily have received some; all the children of France, all their\r\ngrandsons and princes of the blood.'--(28th Nov. 1719.)\r\n\r\n\"Women of the highest rank did not scruple to pay the most assiduous\r\ncourt to Law to obtain shares. They passed whole days in his\r\nante-chamber waiting for an audience, which he very seldom gave them.\r\nOne caused her carriage to be overturned before his door to attract his\r\nattention, and had the good fortune, in consequence, to get a few words\r\nfrom him. Another stopped before his hotel and made her servants call\r\nout 'Fire,' to force him to come out, and thus obtain an interview. They\r\nwere to be seen seated on the front part of the carriage of Madame Law,\r\nstriving to obtain from her a profitable friendship. That woman who had\r\nthe effrontery to take the name of Law, though she was only his\r\nmistress, treated them with hauteur.\r\n\r\n\"The same passion was not less vehement in the other classes of society.\r\nThe latest _arrets_ of the council had ordained that all shares should\r\nbe paid in paper: and instantly a crowd assembled round the bank, to\r\nexchange their gold and silver for bank-notes. The women sold their\r\ndiamonds and pearls, the men their plate. Ere long the provinces became\r\nenvious of the profits made in the capital, and desirous to share in\r\nthem: proprietors sold their lands for whatever they would bring, and\r\nhastened to Paris to acquire the much coveted shares. Ecclesiastics,\r\nbishops even, did not scruple to mingle in these transactions. In a\r\nshort time, the population of the capital was increased by three hundred\r\nthousand souls. Foreigners also arrived in crowds; but, less intoxicated\r\nby the prevailing madness than the French, they foresaw the fatal\r\ndenouement, and, for the most part, extricated themselves in time from\r\nits effects.\"--(Vol. i. pp. 129, 130.)\r\n\r\nThe ultimate issue of this, as of all other general manias, was\r\ndisastrous in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\"The rise of shares having at length experienced a check, they continued\r\nfor some time to oscillate up and down without any material variation,\r\naccording to the devices employed by skilful speculators. These\r\nvariations occasioned enormous changes in the fortune of the gamblers.\r\nThose newly enriched, displayed an unheard-of luxury; hastening to enjoy\r\nwealth which had come to them like a dream, and which the wakening from\r\nit might dissipate. Never had the equipages been so magnificent, never\r\nso numerous. Laquais rolled about in their chariots, and, from the force\r\nof habit, were seen sometimes _to get upon the back of their own\r\ncarriages_. 'Put the most showy arms on my coach,' said one to his\r\ncoach-maker. 'I will have that livery,' said another, when a\r\nparticularly stylish one drove past. Their furniture was sumptuous,\r\ntheir repasts exquisite, and the _noblesse_ did not disdain to honour\r\ntheir tables, making such condescension the first step to alliances\r\nwhich might hereafter convey to them some of the profits of their\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile a frightful tumult disturbed every existence. Speculation\r\nbecame universal, unbounded, at length brutal. Persons were crushed to\r\ndeath in the approaches to the Rue Quincampoix: the men with large\r\nportfolios were in hourly danger of their lives. Assassinations were\r\ncommitted: a Count de Horn was condemned to be broken on the wheel by\r\nthe Parliament, and the sentence carried into execution, for having\r\nrobbed and murdered a courtier. Alarmed at the crowds, the Regent\r\ninterdicted the speculators from making use of the Rue Quincampoix: they\r\ntook refuge in the Place Vendome. In a single day that square was\r\ncovered with tents, where the most sumptuous stuffs were displayed; and,\r\nwithout disquieting themselves with the wild joy of some, or the abject\r\ndespair of others, the ladies of the court seated themselves at gambling\r\ntables, where the choicest refreshments were handed to them. Bands of\r\nmusicians and courtezans served to amuse that insensate crowd. Soon its\r\nexcesses led to its being expelled from the Place Vendome; it then fixed\r\nitself in the Hotel de Soissons.\"--(Vol. i. pp. 133-134.)\r\n\r\nThis exceeds even the joint-stock mania of 1824, or the railway mania of\r\n1845, in this country, of which, in the conclusion of his first volume\r\nof \"Tancred,\" Mr D'Israeli has given a graphic picture. Lady Bertie and\r\nBellair, whose billet regarding the \"_broad gauge_\" occasioned her to\r\nswoon, and dispelled the romantic attachment of Lord Montacute, was but\r\na repetition of the French countesses, who thronged the antechambers of\r\nLaw a century before. More vehement in their desires, more mercurial in\r\ntheir temperament than the English, the French, when seized with any\r\ngeneral mania, push it even into greater excesses, and induce upon\r\nthemselves and their country more wide-spread calamities.\r\n\r\nM. De Tocqueville frequently says that he is not a military historian;\r\nand although he has considerable powers of description, and, like all\r\nhis countrymen, understands something of the art of war, yet it is very\r\napparent that his inclination does not lie in that direction. We gladly\r\ngive a place, however, to his admirable account of the battle of\r\nFontenoy, and the exploits of the famous \"English column,\" which, though\r\nin the end unsuccessful, displayed a valour on the banks of the Scheldt\r\nwhich foreshadowed the heroism of Albuera and Waterloo:--\r\n\r\n\"The King of France passed the Scheldt, and, in spite of the\r\nrepresentations of Marshal Saxe, placed himself on an eminence\r\ncommanding a view of the field of battle, and where the balls rolled to\r\nhis horse's feet. Many persons were wounded behind him. The English and\r\nthe Dutch commenced the attack at the same time at different points. The\r\nformer advanced as if nothing could disconcert their audacity. As the\r\nground contracted, their battalions became more close together, but\r\nstill keeping the finest order; and there was formed, partly by design,\r\npartly by accident, that redoubtable column of which the Duke of\r\nCumberland soon felt the full value. Nothing could withstand that\r\nterrible mass. Steadily it moved on, launching forth death incessantly\r\nfrom every front. The French regiments in vain strove to impede its\r\nprogress; they perished in the attempt. The first corps which the\r\nEnglish approached was the regiment of Gardes Francaises. Before the\r\nfire commenced, an English officer stepped forth from the rank, and\r\ntaking off his hat, said, 'Gentlemen of the French guard, fire.' A\r\nFrench officer advanced and replied, 'The French do not fire first: we\r\nwill reply.' The English then levelled their pieces, and sent in a\r\ndischarge with such precision, that the whole front rank of the Guard\r\nfell. That ill-timed piece of courtesy cost the lives of eighteen\r\nofficers. No sooner was this over than the column renewed its march,\r\nslowly but with immovable firmness. Soon it had passed by six hundred\r\ntoises (1800 feet) the front of the French army. The battle seemed lost,\r\nand the persons who surrounded the King already began to counsel him to\r\nleave the field. 'Who is the scoundrel who dares to give that advice to\r\nyour Majesty?' exclaimed the Marshal, who had been all day in the\r\nhottest of the fire. 'Before the action began it was my time to give it:\r\nnow it is too late.' In truth, all was lost if the monarch had left his\r\npost. His remaining there seemed to make heroes spring out of the earth:\r\nhis departure would have spread discouragement through the ranks. The\r\nadvice of the Marshal coincided with the feelings of the King, and he\r\nremained firm. The blood of Henry IV. then beat at his heart. By his\r\nadvice a new effort better combined was resolved on. The King, whose\r\n_sang froid_ had never for an instant been disturbed, in person rallied\r\nthe fugitives. Four guns, kept in reserve for his personal safety, were\r\nbrought forward, and placed in battery at the distance of forty paces\r\nfrom the head of the English column. They fired with grape with\r\nextraordinary rapidity, and soon huge chasms appeared in the enemy's\r\nranks. The cavalry of the French Guard charged impetuously in at the\r\nopenings,--the Dauphin, sword in hand, leading them on. The swords of\r\nthe horsemen, aided by the fire of the guns and the foot-soldiers, soon\r\ncompleted the work of destruction. And ere long that terrible column\r\nwhich had so recently made the bravest tremble, is nothing but a vast\r\nruin. The English had nine thousand killed and wounded, the French were\r\nweakened by five thousand men.\"--(Vol. i. pp. 425-426.)\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of the conduct of the English troops at\r\nFontenoy--the only great battle on the continent of Europe in which they\r\never sustained a defeat from the French--as given by the historians of\r\nFrance itself. The crisis produced by the irruption of this terrible\r\ncolumn into the centre of the French army, exactly resembles a similar\r\nattack at Aspern and Wagram, and the last onset of the Imperial Guards\r\nat Waterloo. The account of the progress of the English column, and the\r\nmeans by which its advance was at length arrested, might pass for a\r\nnarrative of the penetrating of the Austrian centre by the French column\r\nunder Lannes, on the second day of Aspern, or the famous advance of the\r\nOld and Middle Guard against the British right centre, on the evening of\r\nthe 18th June 1815. Both these formidable attacks were defeated, and by\r\nmeans precisely similar to those by which Marshal Saxe stopped the\r\nEnglish column at Fontenoy. At Wagram, also, the heavy mass of infantry\r\nled by Macdonald was arrested by the dreadful cross-fire of the Austrian\r\nbatteries; and if the Archduke Charles had evinced the same tenacity and\r\nresolution as Marshal Saxe, the result would probably have been the\r\nsame, and Wagram had been Waterloo!\r\n\r\nOf the effects of the irreligious fanaticism, the natural result of the\r\ntyranny and oppressive conduct of the Church of Rome, which pervaded\r\nFrance for half a century before the Revolution, our author gives the\r\nfollowing interesting account:--\r\n\r\n\"Another powerful cause of dissolution existed in French society at this\r\nperiod. The vast conspiracy against Christianity, of which Voltaire was\r\nthe chief, daily developed itself in a more alarming manner. A body of\r\nmen styling themselves philosophers--that is, lovers of wisdom--set up\r\nfor reformers of the human race. They professed to be the enemies of\r\nprejudice; they had for ever in their mouths the words 'humanity,' and\r\n'philanthropy;' their object was declared to be to restore the dignity\r\nof man, and with that view they proposed to substitute certain\r\nconventional virtues for the precepts of Christianity. They pleaded\r\ntolerance, and soon they became themselves intolerant. Misfortune\r\nexcited their pity; they ever undertook its defence, when there was a\r\nnoise to be made, celebrity to be acquired by doing so. By these means,\r\nthey acquired a great renown; to philosophise was continually in their\r\nmouths and their writings. It is no wonder it was so; for to\r\nphilosophise, in their estimation, was to attack all the received\r\nopinions, and annihilate them under the weight of public contempt; to\r\npersecute fanaticism without perceiving that the irreligious passion\r\nsoon acquired the character of the worst species of fanaticism.\r\n\r\n\"Voltaire, endowed by nature with immense talent, had, from his earliest\r\nyears, the steady will and unshaken determination which were necessary\r\nto make him a leader of thought. He laboured at it all his life, and his\r\nmental qualifications enabled him to keep pace with the public desires\r\nin all their branches. The age was frivolous, and he excelled in\r\nfugitive pieces; it was libertine, and he had obscene verses at command;\r\nthe _esprits forts_ had a leaning to incredulity, and he put himself at\r\nthe head of the movement, and made use of it to turn into ridicule all\r\nthat men had been most accustomed to revere. Gifted with extraordinary\r\npowers of raillery and sarcasm, he faithfully reflected in his writings\r\nthe graces and the vices of the brilliant and profligate society in\r\nwhich he lived. He kept some measure in his publications as long as he\r\nhad any hope of obtaining in France a political station; but from the\r\nvery beginning, the acerbity of his disposition displayed itself in his\r\nceaseless attacks on the mysteries of religion, in the elegant society\r\nwhich sought him, and of which he was the delight. 'He had the art,'\r\nsays Vilmain, 'of throwing discredit on a dogma by a happy couplet; by a\r\nphilosophic sentence he refuted a syllogistic argument.'\"--(Vol. ii. pp.\r\n61, 62.)\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Voltaire with the King of Prussia, the bond of\r\nunion in which was their common antipathy to Christianity, forms not the\r\nleast curious part of the lives of both these eminent men. Nearly all\r\nthe sovereigns of the Continent, at this period, were led away by this\r\nmania, destined to produce such fatal effects to themselves and their\r\nchildren. Catherine of Russia was peculiarly active in the infidel\r\nleague. De Tocqueville gives the following interesting account of the\r\nalmost incredible extent to which this mania prevailed in the age which\r\npreceded the French Revolution:--\r\n\r\n\"Voltaire and the King of Prussia resembled two lovers who were\r\ncontinually quarreling and making up their differences. The royal hero\r\ncould never dispense with the renown which the praises of the Patriarch\r\nof Incredulity gave to him. Catherine II. of Russia kept up a close\r\ncorrespondence with him; his expressions to her were confiding, even\r\ntender. She required that trumpet to celebrate her exploits, and\r\npalliate the crimes committed in the pursuit of her ambition. 'My\r\n_Catau_ (his name for the Empress) loves the philosophers, her husband\r\nwill suffer for it with posterity.' At the same time, she respected him\r\nmore than Frederick, and her letters were never disgraced by any\r\nimpurity. She offered D'Alembert to intrust him with the education of\r\nher only son, and to settle on him a pension of 50,000 francs (L2000).\r\nShe flattered Diderot, and sent him a present of 66,000 francs (L2400).\r\nIf the Encyclopedia is proscribed at Paris, it was reprinted at St\r\nPetersburg; the Empress went so far as herself to translate the\r\nBelisarius of Marmontel into the Russian tongue. Eighteen other princes,\r\namong whom were the King of Poland, the King of Sweden, and the King of\r\nDenmark, corresponded with Voltaire, and hastened to deposit in his\r\nhands their adhesion to his protest against the prejudices of the age.\r\nThe princes and great men who were travelling in Europe, endeavoured to\r\nstop at Ferney, happy if they could enjoy for a few minutes the\r\nconversation of the great writer. 'I have been,' said he to Madame de\r\nDeffand, 'for fourteen years the hotel-keeper of Europe.' In his old\r\nage, intoxicated with joy, he wrote to Helvetius, on the 26th June 1765:\r\n'Do you not see that the whole North is for us, and that it is\r\ninevitable that sooner or later those miserable fanatics of the South\r\nmust be confounded? The Empress of Russia, the King of Prussia, the\r\nconqueror of the superstitious Austrian, besides many other princes,\r\nhave already erected the standard of philosophy.' Again he wrote to\r\nD'Alembert, on the 4th June 1767: 'Men begin to open their eyes from one\r\nend of Europe to the other. Fanaticism, which feels its weakness and\r\nimplores the arm of authority, despite itself, acknowledges its defeat.\r\nThe works of Bolingbroke, of Trent, and of Boulanger, universally\r\ndiffused, are so many triumphs of Reason. Let us bless that revolution\r\nwhich for the last fifteen or twenty years has taken place in general\r\nopinion. It has exceeded my most sanguine hopes. _With respect to the\r\ncommon people, I take no charge of them--they will always remain the\r\nrabble._ I cultivate my own garden; it is unavoidable that there should\r\nbe frogs in it, but they do not prevent my nightingales from\r\nsinging.'\"--Vol. ii. pp. 357-8.\r\n\r\nSuch were the opinions of the wise men of Europe in the age which\r\npreceded the French Revolution! It is not surprising they brought on\r\nthat convulsion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful means by which Voltaire and his party succeeded\r\nin rousing so strong a feeling among the ablest men of Europe in their\r\nfavour, was by the constant appeals which they made to the feelings of\r\nhumanity, and the resolution with which they denounced the cruelties,\r\nequally impolitic and inhuman, which the Romish Church, whenever it had\r\nthe power, still exercised on the unhappy victims who occasionally fell\r\nunder the barbarous laws of former times. This atrocious adherence to\r\nantiquated severity, in the vain idea of coercing the freedom of modern\r\nthought, in an age of increasing philanthropy, was, perhaps, the\r\ngreatest cause of the spread of modern infidelity, and of the general\r\nhorror with which the Roman Catholic Church was generally regarded by\r\nenlightened men throughout Europe. In this respect their labours are\r\nworthy of the highest approbation; and in so far as they mainly\r\ncontributed to destroy the dreadful fabric of ecclesiastical tyranny\r\nwhich the Romish Church had established wherever their faith was still\r\nprevalent, they deserve, and will ever obtain, the warmest thanks of all\r\nfriends of humanity. But, like most other reformers, in the ardour of\r\ntheir zeal for the removal of real grievances, they destroyed, also,\r\nbeneficent institutions. It appears, too, from his confidential\r\ncorrespondence, that Voltaire's zeal in the cause of humanity was more a\r\nwar-cry assumed to rouse a party, than a feeling of benevolence towards\r\nmankind; for no one rejoiced more sincerely than he did when the\r\nacerbity of the fanatics was directed against each other.\r\n\r\n\"It must ever be regretted,\" says M. De Tocqueville, \"that Voltaire, in\r\nundertaking the defence of outraged humanity, appeared to have had no\r\nother object but to employ his sensibility to render the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion odious.\" The same man who had expressed such touching regrets\r\non the fate of the unhappy Calas, a Protestant, who had been broken on\r\nthe wheel without sufficient evidence, on a charge of murder by a\r\nsentence of the parliament of Toulouse, permitted the most cruel irony\r\nto flow from his pen when tortures were inflicted on the Jesuits. 'I\r\nhear,' said he, 'that they have at last _burned three Jesuits_ at\r\nLisbon. This is truly _consoling intelligence_; but unhappily it rests\r\non the authority of a Jansenist.' (Voltaire to M. Vernet, 1760.) 'It is\r\nsaid that they have broken Father Malagrida on the wheel: _God be\r\npraised for it! I should die content if I could see the Jansenists and\r\nMolenists crushed to death by each other._' (Letter to the Countess of\r\nLutzelbourg, vol. ii. p. 363.)\r\n\r\nGreat Britain was at that period as much shaken by the effects of her\r\nirreligious party as France; in fact, it was from the writings of\r\nBolingbroke, Tindal, Toland, and their contemporaries, that Voltaire\r\ndrew almost all the arguments with which his writings abound against the\r\ndoctrines of Christianity. Gibbon afterwards lent the same cause the aid\r\nof his brilliant genius and vast industry. Scotland, too, had its own\r\nshare of the prevailing epidemic. Hume was the great apostle of\r\nscepticism, caressed by all Europe. But neither England nor Scotland\r\nwere overturned by their efforts: on the contrary, Christianity, tried\r\nbut not injured, came forth unscathed from the furnace. The\r\nlearning--the talent--the zeal which arose in defence of religion, were\r\nat least equal to what was employed in the attack; and so completely did\r\nthey baffle the efforts of the infidel party, that Christianity grew and\r\nstrengthened with every assault made upon it; and when this great\r\nconflict began between the antagonist principles in 1793, England was\r\nfound at its proper post in the vanguard of religion and order. This\r\nfact is very remarkable, and deserves more serious consideration than\r\nhas yet been bestowed upon it. It clearly points to some essential\r\ndifference between the political and religious institutions of France\r\nand England at that period, on the capacity which they bestowed upon a\r\nnation to withstand the assaults of infidelity and corruption. It is not\r\ndifficult to see what that difference was. In England, a free\r\nconstitution was established, freedom of discussion was permitted, and\r\nthe church was not allowed to exercise any tyrannical sway over either\r\nthe minds or bodies of men. The consequence was, genius in the hour of\r\nneed came to her side, and brought her triumphant through all the\r\ndangers by which she was assailed. Intellect was divided; it was not as\r\nin France wholly ranged on the side of infidelity. The cause of truth,\r\nthough it may be subjected to grievous temporary trials, has nothing in\r\nthe end to fear except from the excesses of tyranny exerted in its\r\ndefence. Unsheltered by power, talent will speedily come to its aid. The\r\nwounds inflicted by mind can be cured only by mind: but they will never\r\nfail of being so if mind is left to itself.\r\n\r\nOne of the well-known abuses which preceded the Revolution, was the\r\nimproper use which, in the reign of Louis XV. was made of _lettres de\r\ncachet_, obtained too often by private solicitation or the interest of\r\nsome of the mistresses of the King or his ministers. Their abuse rose to\r\nthe highest pitch, under the administration of the Duke de la Villiere.\r\nThe Marchioness Langeac, his mistress, openly made a traffic of them,\r\nand never was one refused to a man of influence, who had a vengeance to\r\nsatiate, a passion to gratify. The Comte de Segur gives the following\r\ncharacteristic anecdote, illustrating the use made of these instruments\r\nof tyranny, even upon the inferior classes of society.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard related the sad mishap which occurred to a young\r\nshop-mistress, named Jeanneton, who was remarkable for her beauty. One\r\nday the Chevalier de Coigny met her radiant with smiles, and in the\r\nhighest spirits. He inquired the cause of her extreme satisfaction. 'I\r\nam truly happy,' she replied,--'My husband is a scold, a brute; he gave\r\nme no rest--I have been with M. le Comte de Saint Florentin; Madame\r\n----, who enjoys his good graces, has received me in the kindest manner,\r\nand for a present of ten _Louis_ I have just obtained a _lettre de\r\ncachet_ which will deliver me from the persecution of that most jealous\r\ntyrant.'\r\n\r\n\"Two years afterwards, M. de Coigny met the same Jeanneton, but now sad,\r\npale, with downcast look, and a care-worn countenance. 'Ah! my poor\r\nJeanneton!' said he, 'what has become of you? I never meet you any\r\nwhere. What has cast you down, since we last met?' 'Alas! sir,' replied\r\nshe, 'I was very foolish to be then in such spirits; my villanous\r\nhusband had that very day taken up the same idea as I; he went to the\r\nminister, and the same day, by the intervention of his mistress, _he\r\nbrought an order to shut me up_; so that it cost our poor _menage_\r\ntwenty _louis_ to throw us at the same time reciprocally into\r\nprison.'\"--(Vol. ii. p. 489.)\r\n\r\nM. De Tocqueville sums up in these eloquent words which close his work,\r\nthe tendency and final result of the government of the Regent Orleans\r\nand Louis XV.:--\r\n\r\n\"The high society was more liberal than the bourgeois: the bourgeois\r\nthan the people. The Revolution commenced in the head of the social\r\nsystem; from that it gained the heart, and spread to the extremities. It\r\nbecame a point of honour to be in opposition. It was a mode of shining\r\nand acquiring popularity; a fashion which the young seized with avidity.\r\nThe words Liberty and Representative Government were continually in the\r\nmouths of those who were, ere long, to ascribe to them all their\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\n\"The partition of Poland revealed to the French the political\r\ndegradation of their country. The great and beautiful kingdom of France\r\nresembled a planet under eclipse: its light seemed extinguished. The\r\nFrench honour felt itself profoundly mortified. In the midst of that\r\ndegradation, and from its very effects, political combinations entered\r\nmore and more into every thought. The activity of mind, which no longer\r\ncould find employment in the glory of the country, took a direction\r\ntowards industry and the sciences. The middle class, rich and\r\ninstructed, obtained an influence which formerly had been monopolised by\r\nthe _noblesse_, and aspired to the destruction of privileges which it\r\ndid not enjoy. Beneath both, the working classes, steeped in misery,\r\ncrushed under the weight of taxes, reserved to the innovators the most\r\nformidable support.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the movement, arising from many different causes, extended more\r\nand more. The philosophers, by incessantly depreciating the nation in\r\ntheir writings, had succeeded in rendering the nation ashamed of itself.\r\nAll parties in the nation seemed to unite in deeming it necessary to\r\ndestroy the ancient social order. It was manifest that important changes\r\nwould take place at no distant period, though the exact time of their\r\napproach could not be fixed with certainty. It was at the approach of\r\nthat tempest which was destined to shake the state to its foundations,\r\nthat the pride of philosophy sought to exalt itself by attacking heaven.\r\nBy it the curb of conscience was broken, and the great name of God,\r\nwhich might have imposed a restraint on the violence of the passions\r\nwhich the Revolution called forth, was effaced. By this means, to the\r\nlegitimate conquest of liberty will ere long succeed a mortal strife of\r\nvanities, in which those of the majority, having proved victorious, will\r\nstain themselves without mercy with the blood of the vanquished. Other\r\npeople will, in future times, undergo changes similar to ours; but they\r\nwill eschew the same violence, because the influence of religion will\r\nnot be extinct among them. Posterity, that equitable judge of the past,\r\nimputes to philosophy that it perverted the minds of the people while it\r\npretended to enlighten them, and turned aside from its proper end a\r\nrevolution commenced with the design of ameliorating the lot of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\n\"Louis XV. left royalty tarnished in France. At his death the people\r\nrejoiced,--the enlightened classes congratulated themselves. The vices\r\nof the sovereign had opened in every heart an incurable wound. Neither\r\nthe virtues of Louis XVI., nor the glory acquired during the American\r\nwar; nor the sight of France restored to its rank among the nations; nor\r\nthe love of the King for his subjects; nor the liberal institutions\r\nwhich he bestowed on them, could heal that fatal wound. The stains of\r\nthe crown could be washed out only by the blood of the just ascending to\r\nHeaven by the steps of the scaffold.\"[4]--(Vol. ii. pp. 531, 533.)\r\n\r\nAfter these quotations, it is needless to say what the merits of M. De\r\nTocqueville's work are. He possesses the abstract thought, the\r\nphilosophic temperament, the reflecting mind, which enable him to\r\nfollow, with a correct and discerning eye, the _general_ course of\r\nevents. He does not attach himself to individual men,--he is no\r\nhero-worshipper. His narrative has not the interest of biography, or of\r\nhistories framed on its model. It has not the dramatic air of Thierry,\r\nthe genius of Chateaubriand, or the pictorial powers of Michelet. It is,\r\non that account, not likely to be so generally popular as the works of\r\nany of these eminent writers. It resembles more nearly the admirable\r\n\"Sketches of the Progress of Society,\" to be found in the works of\r\nGuizot and Sismondi. As such, it possesses very high merit, and will\r\ndoubtless take its place among the standard works of French history.\r\nPerhaps his work is more worthy of study, and more likely to be esteemed\r\nby thinking men in other countries than his own: for France has gone\r\nthrough the convulsions consequent on the social and moral evils which\r\nhe has so well portrayed; but other nations are only in their\r\ncommencement. What to the one is history, to the other, if not averted,\r\nmay be prophecy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Histoire Philosophique du Regne de Louis XV._ Par M. Le Comte DE\r\nTOCQUEVILLE. 2 Vols.

No,\r\nNicolai's case, has extinguished that delusion. The visitant and his\r\ndress are figments of the imagination _always_. They are as unreal and\r\nsubjective as the figures we see in our dreams. They are fancy's\r\nprogeny, having under pressing circumstances acting rank, as realities.\r\nBut, Archy, do dreams never come true? Let them plead their own cause.\r\nEnter Dream.\r\n\r\nA Scottish gentleman and his wife were travelling four or five years ago\r\nin Switzerland. There travelled with them a third party, an intimate\r\nfriend, a lady, who some time before had been the object of a deep\r\nattachment on the part of a foreigner, a Frenchman. Well, she would have\r\nnothing to say to him, but she gave him a good deal of serious advice,\r\nwhich I conclude she thought he wanted, and ultimately promoted, or was\r\na cognisant party to his marriage with a lady, whom she likewise knew.\r\nThe so-married couple were now in America. And the lady, my friend's\r\nfellow-traveller, occasionally heard from them, and had every reason to\r\nbelieve they were both in perfect health. One morning on their meeting\r\nat breakfast she told her companions, that she had had a very impressive\r\ndream the night before, which had recurred twice. The scene was a room\r\nin which lay a coffin, near which stood her ex-lover, in a luminous\r\ntransfigured resplendent state; his wife was by, looking much as usual.\r\nThe dream had caused the lady some misgivings; but her companions\r\nexhorted her to view it as a trick of her fancy, and she was half\r\npersuaded so to do. The dream, however, was right notwithstanding. In\r\nprocess of time, letters arrived announcing the death after a short\r\nillness of the French gentleman, within the twenty-four hours in which\r\nthe vision appeared. Exit Dream, with applause.\r\n\r\nI adduce this individual instance, simply because it is the last I have\r\nheard, out of many that have come before me equally well attested. I\r\nshould have observed, that my informant was the fellow-traveller\r\nhimself: he told me the story in presence of his wife, who religiously\r\nattested its accuracy. You will meet with similar stories, implicitly\r\nbelieved, in every society you go into, varying in their\r\ncircumstances--a ghost being sometimes put in the place of a dream, and\r\nsometimes a vague but strong mental impression, a foreboding only. But\r\nthe common point exists in all, that all intimation of the death of an\r\nabsent acquaintance has been in one or another way insinuated into the\r\nmind of his friend about the time the event really took place. Instances\r\nof this kind, it will be found, are far too numerous to permit one\r\noff-hand to conclude that they have arisen from accident; that the\r\nconnexion between the event and its anticipation and foreshadowing has\r\nbeen merely coincidence.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me how I would otherwise explain these stories, I will\r\nfrankly avow, that it appears to me neither impossible, nor absurdly\r\nimprobable, that the soul, or the nervous system, as you like, of the\r\ndying man, should have put itself into direct communication with the\r\nthoughts of his absent friend.\r\n\r\nAh, ah! the last touch of the vampyr theory again! You were then very\r\nmodest about your hobby, and pretended not to know him, and passed him\r\noff as my beast, and now you daringly mount him yourself, and expect to\r\nbe allowed to pace him before us, in that easy and confident style, as\r\nif he were some well-known roadster of Stewart's, or Ferriar's, or\r\nHibbert's, or Abercromby's. Now shall we shortly see you thrown, or run\r\naway with, or led by some will-o'-the-wisp into a bottomless slough.\r\n\r\nWell, that at all events will amuse you.\r\n\r\nBut in the mean time did you ever hear of the Wynyard ghost? A late\r\nGeneral Wynyard and the late Sir John Colebrook, when young men, were\r\nserving in Canada. One day--it was daylight--Mr Wynyard and Mr Colebrook\r\nboth saw a figure pass through the room in which they were sitting,\r\nwhich Mr Wynyard recognised as a brother then far away. One of them\r\nwalked to the door, and looked out upon the landing-place; but the\r\nstranger was not there, and a servant, who was on the stairs, had seen\r\nnobody pass out. In time the news arrived, that Mr Wynyard's brother had\r\ndied about the time of the visit of the apparition. Of this story, which\r\nI had heard narrated, I inquired the truth of two military men, each a\r\nGeneral Wynyard, near relations of the ghost-seer of that name. They\r\ntold me it was so narrated _by him_, certainly, and that it had the\r\nimplicit belief of the family.\r\n\r\nAnother similar, double-barreled ghost story I recently had narrated to\r\nme, and was assured it rested on evidence equally good. I have heard of\r\nseveral others being in existence.\r\n\r\nNow, if these stories be true, to suppose the events mere coincidences,\r\nor rather to believe them to be so, would be an immense stretch of\r\ncredulity. The chances would be millions to one against two persons,\r\nneither of whom, before or after, experienced sensorial illusions,\r\nbecoming the subject of one, and seemingly the same illusion at the same\r\nmoment--the two hallucinations coinciding in point of time with an event\r\nwhich they served, in the mind of one of the parties at least, to\r\nforeshadow. I prefer supposing that the event so communicated really had\r\nto do with, and was the common idea of the sensorial illusion\r\nexperienced by both parties. To speak figuratively, my dear Archy--mind,\r\n_figuratively_--I prefer to think, that the death of a human being\r\nthrows a sort of gleam through the spiritual world, which may now and\r\nthen touch some congenial object with sudden light, _or even two_, when\r\nthey happen to be exactly in the proper position; as the twin spires of\r\na cathedral may be momentarily illuminated by some far-off flash, while\r\nthe countless roofs below lie in unbroken gloom.\r\n\r\nPretty well, indeed! I think I hear you say--Very easy, certainly! But,\r\nperhaps, you will be kind enough to give us a trifle more grounds for\r\nadmitting your hypothesis than you have yet vouchsafed. Likewise a\r\nlittle explanation of what you exactly mean might be of use, if you\r\nseriously hope to reconcile us to this most prodigious prance.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy to give you every reasonable satisfaction. Then, in the\r\nfirst place, I propose to establish beyond the possibility of doubt or\r\nquestion, and at once, that the mind of a living human being, in his\r\nordinary state, may enter into communication with the mind of another\r\nhuman being, likewise in his every-day state, through some other channel\r\nthan that of the senses, in their understood and ordinary operation, and\r\nas it would seem, _immediately and directly_; so that it becomes _at\r\nonce_ intimately acquainted with all the former affections, feelings,\r\nvolitions, history of the second mind.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Zschokke, I need hardly say, is one of the most eminent\r\nliterary men now living in Europe; one, too, whose life has not been\r\nexclusively occupied with the cultivation of letters, but who, having\r\nbeen early engaged in public and official employments in Switzerland,\r\nthe country of his adoption, has been practically tried and proved in\r\nsight of the world, in which he has always borne a high and unblemished\r\ncharacter; one, finally, whose writings and whose life have happily\r\nconcurred in winning for him general respect, esteem, and confidence.\r\nThen, in a sort of autobiography which Zschokke published a few years\r\nback, (_Selbstschau_, it is entitled--Self-retrospect,) there occurs the\r\nfollowing passage, which I translate and give at length, from its\r\nmarvellous interest, from its unquestioned fidelity, from the complete\r\nand irresistible evidence it affords that the phenomenon, enunciated in\r\nthe last paragraph, occasionally turns up in men's experience.\r\n\r\n\"If the reception of so many visitors was occasionally troublesome, it\r\nrepaid itself occasionally, either by making me acquainted with\r\nremarkable personages, or by bringing out a wonderful sort of seer-gift,\r\nwhich I called my inward vision, and which has always remained an enigma\r\nto me. I am almost afraid to say a word upon this subject, not for fear\r\nof the imputation of being superstitious, but lest I should encourage\r\nthat disposition in others; and yet it forms a contribution to\r\npsychology. So to confess.\r\n\r\n\"It is acknowledged that the judgment which we form of strangers upon\r\nfirst seeing them, is frequently more correct than that which we adopt\r\nupon a longer acquaintance with them. The first impression, which,\r\nthrough an instinct of the soul, attracts one towards, or repels one\r\nfrom another, becomes after a time more dim, and is weakened, either\r\nthrough his appearing other than at first, or through our being\r\naccustomed to him. People speak, too, in reference to such cases, of\r\ninvoluntary sympathies and aversions, and attach a special certainty to\r\nsuch manifestations in children, in whom knowledge of mankind by\r\nexperience is wanting. Others again are incredulous, and attribute all\r\nto physiognomical skill. But of myself.\r\n\r\n\"It has happened to me occasionally, at the first meeting with a total\r\nstranger, when I have been listening in silence to his conversation,\r\nthat his past life up to the present moment, with many minute\r\ncircumstances, belonging to one or other particular scene in it, has\r\ncome across me like a dream, but distinctly, entirely involuntarily and\r\nunsought, occupying in duration a few minutes. During this period, I am\r\nusually so completely plunged into the representation of the stranger's\r\nlife, that at last I neither continue to see distinctly his face, on\r\nwhich I was idly speculating, nor hear intelligently his voice, which at\r\nfirst I was using as a commentary on the test of his physiognomy. For a\r\nlong time, I was disposed to consider those fleeting visions as a trick\r\nof the fancy; the more so that my dream-vision displayed to me the dress\r\nand movements of the actors, the appearance of the room, the furniture\r\nand other accidents of the scene. Till on one occasion, in a gamesome\r\nmood, I narrated to my family the secret history of a sempstress, who\r\nhad just before quitted the room. I had never seen the person before.\r\nNevertheless, the hearers were astonished, and laughed, and would not be\r\npersuaded but that I had a previous acquaintance with the former life of\r\nthe person, in as much as what I had stated was perfectly true. I was\r\nnot less astonished to find that my dream-vision agreed with reality. I\r\nthen gave more attention to the subject, and as often as propriety\r\nallowed of it, I related to those whose lives had so passed before me,\r\nthe substance of my dream-vision, to obtain from them its contradiction\r\nor confirmation. On every occasion its confirmation followed, not\r\nwithout amazement on the part of those who gave it.\r\n\r\n\"Least of all could I myself give faith to these conjuring tricks of my\r\nmind. Every time that I described to any one my dream-vision respecting\r\nhim, I confidently expected him to answer, it was not so. A secret\r\nthrill always came over me, when the listener replied, \"It happened as\r\nyou say,\" or when, before he spoke, his astonishment betrayed that I was\r\nnot wrong. Instead of recording many instances, I will give one, which\r\nat the time made a strong impression upon me:--\r\n\r\n\"On a market-day, (fair-day,) I went into the town of Waldshut,\r\naccompanied by two young foresters who are still alive. It was evening,\r\nand, tired with our walk, we went into an inn called the Rebstock. We\r\ntook our supper with a numerous company at the public table, when it\r\nhappened that they made themselves merry over the peculiarities and\r\nsimplicity of the Swiss; in common with the belief in mesmerism,\r\nLavater's physiognomical system, and the like. One of my companions,\r\nwhose national pride was touched by their raillery, begged me to make\r\nsome reply, particularly in answer to a young man of superior\r\nappearance, who sat opposite, and had indulged in unrestrained\r\nridicule. It happened that the events of this very person's life had\r\njust previously passed before my mind. I turned to him with the\r\nquestion, whether he would reply to me with truth and candour, if I\r\nnarrated to him the most secret passages of his history, he being as\r\nlittle known to me as I to him. That would, I suggested, go something\r\nbeyond Lavater's physiognomical skill. He promised, if I told the truth,\r\nto admit it openly. Then I narrated the events which my dream-vision had\r\nfurnished me with, and the table learned the history of the young\r\ntradesman's life, of his school years, his peccadilloes, and finally of\r\na little act of roguery committed by him on the strong-box of his\r\nemployer. I described the uninhabited room, with its white walls, where,\r\nto the right of the brown door, there had stood upon the table the small\r\nblack money-chest, &c. A dead silence reigned in the company during this\r\nrecital, which I broke in upon, only by occasionally asking whether I\r\nspoke the truth. The man, much struck, admitted the correctness of each\r\ncircumstance--even, which I could not expect, of the last. Touched with\r\nhis frankness, I reached my hand to him across the table, and closed my\r\nnarrative. He asked my name, which I gave him. We sat up late in the\r\nnight conversing. He may be alive yet.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I can well imagine how a lively imagination could picture, romance\r\nfashion, from the obvious character of a person, how he would act under\r\ngiven circumstances. But whence came to me the involuntary knowledge of\r\naccessory details, which were without any sort of interest, and\r\nrespected people who for the most part were perfectly indifferent to me,\r\nwith whom I neither had, nor wished to have, the slightest association?\r\nOr was it in each case mere coincidence? Or had the listener, to whom I\r\ndescribed his history, each time other images in his mind than the\r\naccessory ones of my story, but, in surprise at the essential\r\nresemblance of my story to the truth, lost sight of the points of\r\ndifference? Yet I have, in consideration of this possible source of\r\nerror, several times taken pains to describe the most trivial\r\ncircumstances that the dream-vision has shown me.\r\n\r\n\"Not another word about this strange seer-gift--which I can aver was of\r\nno use to me in a single instance, which manifested itself occasionally\r\nonly, and quite independently of my volition, and often in relation to\r\npersons in whose history I took not the slightest interest. Nor am I the\r\nonly one in possession of this faculty. In a journey with two of my\r\nsons, I fell in with an old Tyrolese, who travelled about selling lemons\r\nand oranges, at the inn at Unterhauenstein in one of the Jura passes. He\r\nfixed his eyes for some time upon me, joined in our conversation,\r\nobserved that though I did not know him, he knew me, and began to\r\ndescribe my acts and deeds to the no little amusement of the peasants,\r\nand astonishment of my children, whom it interested to learn that\r\nanother possessed the same gift as their father. How the old lemon\r\nmerchant acquired his knowledge, he was not able to explain to himself,\r\nor to me. But he seemed to attach great importance to his hidden\r\nwisdom.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, my dear Archy, that the remarkable statement which I\r\nhave thus put before you, completely establishes that, in reference to\r\nthe past, the mind occasionally receives knowledge through other than\r\nthe known and ordinary channels; and that the simplest and most natural\r\ninterpretation of the facts narrated, is to suppose that, under special\r\ncircumstances, one mind can put itself into direct communication with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that these considerations give a front and plausibility to\r\nthe hypothesis, that, in some cases of dreams and sensorial illusions,\r\nwhich have turned out true and significant intimations of the death of\r\nabsent persons, there may have been at the bottom of them a relation\r\nestablished between the minds or nervous systems of the distant parties.\r\n\r\nI will now go a step further, and throw out the conjecture, that the\r\nmind may occasionally assert the power of penetrating into futurity, not\r\nthrough a shrewd calculation of what is likely to come to pass, but by\r\nputting itself in relation with some other source of knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor I think it cannot be doubted that there is something in the\r\nsuperstition of second-sight, which formerly prevailed so extensively in\r\nScotland, in the northern islands, and Denmark. Every one has heard and\r\nread of this pretended gift. I have no evidence, I must confess, to\r\noffer of its reality beyond that which is accessible to every one. But I\r\nhave heard several instances told, which, if the testimony of sensible\r\npeople may be taken in such marvellous matters as readily as on other\r\nsubjects, evinced _foreknowledge_. The thing foretold has generally been\r\ndeath or personal misfortune. Sometimes the subject has been more\r\ntrivial. A much-respected Scottish lady, not unknown in literature, told\r\nme very recently how a friend of her mother's, whom she well remembered,\r\nhad been compelled to believe in second-sight, through its manifestation\r\nin one of her servants. She had a cook, who was a continual annoyance to\r\nher through her possession of this gift. On one occasion, when the lady\r\nexpected some friends, she learned, a short time before they were to\r\narrive, that the culinary preparations which she had ordered in their\r\nhonour had not been made. Upon her remonstrating with the offending\r\ncook, the latter simply but doggedly assured her that come they would\r\nnot, that she knew it of a certainty; and true enough they did not come.\r\nSome accident had occurred to prevent their visit. The same person\r\nfrequently knew beforehand what her mistress's plans would be, and was\r\nas inconvenient in her kitchen as a calculating prodigy in a\r\ncounting-house. Things went perfectly right, but the manner was\r\nvexatious and irregular; so her mistress sent her away. This anecdote\r\nwould appear less puerile to you, if I might venture to name the lady\r\nwho told it to me, and who believed it. But, as I said before, I do not\r\nbuild, in this branch of the question, upon any special evidence that I\r\nhave to adduce. I rely upon the mass of good, bad, and indifferent proof\r\nthere is already before the world, of the reality of second-sight. I\r\nhave, of course, not the least doubt that more than half of those who\r\nhave laid claim to the faculty, were not possessed of it. I have further\r\nno doubt that those who occasionally really manifested it, often\r\ndeceived themselves, and confounded casual impressions with real\r\nintimations; and that they were nuisances to themselves and to their\r\nfriends, through being constantly on the look-out for, and conveying\r\nwarnings and forebodings; and that the power which they possessed, was\r\nprobably never useful in a single instance, either to themselves or\r\nothers--those only having gained by the superstition, who were mere\r\nrogues and impostors, and turned their pretended gift to purposes of\r\ndeception.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to inquire how far it is conceivable that the mind\r\nor soul, its usual channels of communication with external objects, the\r\nsenses namely, being suspended and unemployed, may enter into direct\r\nrelation with other minds.\r\n\r\nThere is a school of physiological materialists, who hold that the mind\r\nis but the brain in action; in other words, that it is the office of the\r\nbrain to produce thought and feeling. I must begin by combating this\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by one substance producing another? A metal is produced\r\nfrom an ore; alcohol is produced from saccharine matter; the bones and\r\nsinews of an animal are produced from its food. Production, in the only\r\nintelligible sense of the word, means the conversion of one substance\r\ninto another, weight for weight, agreeably with, or under mechanical,\r\nchemical, and vital laws. But to suppose that in order to produce\r\nconsciousness, the brain is converted, weight for weight, into thought\r\nand feeling, is absurd.\r\n\r\nBut what, then, is the true relation between consciousness and the\r\nliving brain, in connexion with which it is manifested?\r\n\r\nTo elucidate the question, let us consider the parallel relation of\r\nother imponderable forces to matter. Take, for instance, electricity. A\r\ngalvanic battery is set in action. Chemical decomposition is in\r\nprogress; one or more new compounds are produced; the quantitative\r\ndifferences are exactly accounted for. But there is something further\r\nto be observed. The chemical action has disturbed the omnipresent force\r\nof electricity, and a vigorous electric current is in motion.\r\n\r\nThe principle of consciousness is another imponderable force which\r\npervades the universe. The brain and nerves are framed of such materials\r\nand in such arrangements, that the chemical changes constantly in\r\nprogress under the control of life, determine in them currents of\r\nthought and feeling.\r\n\r\nWe must be satisfied with having got thus far by help of the analogy,\r\nnor try to push it further; for beyond the fact of both being\r\nimponderable forces, electricity and consciousness have nothing in\r\ncommon. They are otherwise violently unlike; or resemble each other as\r\nlittle as a tooth-pick and a headach. Their further relations to the\r\nmaterial arrangements through which they may be excited or disturbed,\r\nare subjects of separate and dissimilar studies, and resolvable into\r\nlaws which have no affinity, and admit of no comparison.\r\n\r\nBut upon the step which we have gained, it stands to reason, that the\r\nindividual consciousness or mind, habitually energizing in and through a\r\ngiven living brain, may, for any thing we know to the contrary, and very\r\nconceivably, be drawn, under circumstances favourable to the event, into\r\ndirect communication with consciousness, individualised or diffused\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, there is no intrinsic absurdity in supposing that\r\nZschokke's mind was occasionally thrown into direct relation with that\r\nof a chance visitor through favourable influences; that the soul of\r\nArnod Paole, as he lay in his grave alive, in the so-called\r\nvampyr-state, may have drawn into communion the minds of other persons,\r\nwho were thereupon the subjects of sensorial illusions of which he was\r\nthe theme;--that the mind of Joan of Arc may by possibility have been\r\nplaced in relation with a higher mind, which foreknew her destiny, and\r\nin a parallel manner displayed it to her.\r\n\r\nIndividual facts may be disputed or attributed to more coincidence, but\r\nas soon as their number and singularity and authentication take them out\r\nof that category, the explanation offered above cannot be put aside as\r\n_prima facie_ absurd. Like other first hypotheses, indeed, it will, if\r\nreceived for a time, have ultimately to make way for a correcter notion.\r\nStill it will have helped to lead to truth. I am quite indifferent to\r\nits fate. But I am not indifferent to the reception the facts themselves\r\nmay meet with, which I have adduced it to explain. It is true that\r\nnothing can be more trivial and useless than the character in which they\r\npresent themselves. Disconnected objectless outbreaks, they seem, of\r\nsome obscure power, they may be compared to the attraction of light\r\nbodies by amber after friction, and are as yet as unmeaning and\r\nvalueless as were the first indications of the electric force.\r\nTherefore, doubtless, are they so commonly disregarded.\r\n\r\nIt is not indeed unlikely that, on looking closer, a number of other\r\nincidents, turning up on trifling or important occasions, may be found\r\nto depend on the same cause with those we have been considering--things\r\nthat seem for a moment odd and unaccountable, something more than\r\ncoincidences, and are then forgotten. The simultaneous suggestions of\r\nthe same idea to two persons in conversation, the spread of panic-fears,\r\nsympathy in general, the attraction or repulsion felt on first\r\nacquaintance, the intuitive knowledge of mankind which some possess, the\r\nuniversal fascination exercised by others, may be found, perhaps, in\r\npart to hinge on the same principle with Zschokke's seer-gift.\r\n\r\nAmong the odd incidents which this train of reflection brings to my\r\nmind, (which you are at liberty to explain in the way you like best,) I\r\nam tempted to select and mention two that were communicated to me by\r\nAdmiral the Honourable G. Dundas, then a Lord of the Admiralty, and in\r\nconstant communication with his colleague, Sir Thomas Hardy, from whom\r\nhe received them. They were mentioned as anecdotes of Lord Nelson, to\r\nshow his instinctive judgment of men. They both go further.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Nelson was preparing to follow the French fleet to the West\r\nIndies, Captain Hardy was present as he gave directions to the commander\r\nof a frigate to make sail with all speed,--to proceed to certain points,\r\nwhere he was likely to see the French,--having seen the French, to go to\r\na certain harbour, and there wait Lord Nelson's coming. After the\r\ncommander had left the cabin, Nelson said to Hardy, \"He will go to the\r\nWest Indies, he will see the French, he will go to the harbour I have\r\ndirected, but he will not wait for me. He will return to England.\" He\r\ndid so. Shortly before the battle of Trafalgar, an English frigate was\r\nin advance of the fleet looking out for the enemy; her place in the\r\noffing was hardly discernible. Captain Hardy was with Nelson on the\r\nquarter-deck of the Victory. Without any thing to lead to it, Nelson\r\nsaid, \"The Celeste\" (or whatever the frigate's name may have been)--\"the\r\nCeleste sees the French.\" Hardy had nothing to say on the matter. \"She\r\nsees the French; she'll fire a gun.\" Within a little, the boom of the\r\ngun was heard.\r\n\r\nSocrates, it is well known, had singular intimations, which he\r\nattributed to a familiar or demon. One day being with the army, he tried\r\nto persuade an officer, who was going across the country, to take a\r\ndifferent route to that which he intended; \"If you take that,\" he said,\r\n\"you will be met and slain.\" The officer, neglecting his advice, was\r\nkilled, as Socrates had forewarned him.\r\n\r\nTimarchus, who was curious on the subject of the demon of Socrates, went\r\nto the cave of Trophonius, to learn of the oracle about it. There,\r\nhaving for a short time inhaled the mephitic vapour, he felt as if he\r\nhad received a sudden blow on the head, and sank down insensible. Then\r\nhis head appeared to him to open and to give issue to his soul into the\r\nother world; and an imaginary being seemed to inform him that, \"the part\r\nof the soul engaged in the body, entrammelled in its organisation, is\r\nthe soul is ordinarily understood; but that there is another part or\r\nprovince of the soul, which is the demon. This has a certain control\r\nover the bodily soul, and among other offices constitutes conscience. In\r\nthree months,\" the vision added, \"you will know more of this.\" At the\r\nend of three months Timarchus died.\r\n\r\n    Again adieu. Yours, &c.,\r\n                      MAC DAVUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--TRANCE AND SLEEPWALKING.\r\n\r\nDEAR ARCHY.--The subjects which remain to complete our brief\r\ncorrespondence, are Religious Delusions, the Possessed, and Witchcraft.\r\n\r\nIn order that I may set these fully and distinctly before you, it is\r\nnecessary that you should know what is meant by Trance.\r\n\r\nYou have already had partial glimpses of this comprehensive phenomenon.\r\nArnod Paole was in a trance, in his grave in the church-yard of\r\nMeduegua: Timarchus was in a trance in the cave of Trophonius.\r\n\r\nBut we must go still further back. To conceive properly the nature of\r\ntrance, it is necessary to form clear ideas of the state of the mind in\r\nordinary sleeping and waking.\r\n\r\nDuring our ordinary waking state, we are conscious of an uninterrupted\r\nflow of thought, which we may observe to be modified by three\r\ninfluences--the first, suggestions of our experience and reflections,\r\nimpulses of our natural and acquired character; the second, present\r\nimpressions on our senses; the third, voluntary exertion of the\r\nattention to detain one class of ideas in preference to others.\r\n\r\nFurther, we habitually perceive things around us, by or through\r\nsensation. But on some, and for the most part trivial occasions, we seem\r\nendowed with another sort of perception, which is either direct, or\r\ndependent on new modes of sensation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the balance of the mental machinery may be overthrown. The\r\nsuggestions of the imagination may become sensorial illusions; the\r\njudgment may be the subject of parallel hallucinations; the feelings may\r\nbe perverted; our ideas may lose connexion and coherence; and\r\nintelligence may sink into fatuity.\r\n\r\nSo much for our waking state.\r\n\r\nDuring sleep, there are no adequate reasons for doubting that the flow\r\nof our ideas continues as uninterrupted as in a waking state. It is\r\ntrue, that some persons assert that they never dream; and others that\r\nthey dream occasionally only. But there is a third class, to which I\r\nmyself belong, who continually dream, and who always, on waking,\r\ndistinctly discern the fugitive rearguard of their last sleep thoughts.\r\nThe simplest view of these diversified instances, is to suppose that all\r\npersons in sleep are always dreaming, and that the spaces seemingly\r\nvacant of dreams, are only gaps in the memory; that all persons asleep\r\nalways dream, but that all persons do not always remember their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe suggestive influences that modify the current of ideas in sleep, are\r\nnot so numerous as those in operation in our waking state.\r\n\r\nThe principal, indeed in general the exclusive, impulse to our dreaming\r\nthoughts, is our past experience and existing character, from and in\r\nobedience to which, imagination moulds our dreams.\r\n\r\nNot that sensation is suspended in sleep. On the contrary, it appears to\r\nhave its usual acuteness; and impressions made upon our senses--the\r\nfeelings produced by an uneasy posture, for instance, or the\r\nintroduction of sudden light into the room, or a loud and unusual noise,\r\nor even whisperings in the ear--will give a new and corresponding\r\ndirection to the dreaming thoughts. Sensation is only commonly not\r\ncalled into play in sleep: we shut our eyes; we even close the pupils;\r\nwe cover up our ears; court darkness and quiet; knowing that the more we\r\nexclude sensible impressions the better we shall sleep.\r\n\r\nBut the great difference between sleeping and waking, that which indeed\r\nconstitutes the essence of the former state, psychically considered, is\r\nthe suspension of the attention--all the leading phenomena of sleep are\r\ndirectly traceable to this cause: for example--\r\n\r\nIn sleep we cease to support ourselves, and fall, if we were previously\r\nstanding or sitting. That is, we cease to attend to the maintenance of\r\nour equilibrium. We forget the majority of our dreams: attention is the\r\nsoul of recollection.\r\n\r\nOur dreams are often nonsense, or involve absurdities or ideas which we\r\nknow to be false. The check of the attention is absent.\r\n\r\nOur ideas whirl with unwonted rapidity in our dreams; the fly-wheel of\r\nthe attention has been taken off.\r\n\r\nWhen we are being overcome with sleep, we are conscious of not being\r\nable to fix our attention.\r\n\r\nWhen we would encourage sleep, we endeavour to avoid thoughts which\r\nwould arouse the attention.\r\n\r\nThough the sensibility of our organs is really undiminished, _it seems\r\nto be lowered_ in sleep, because then no attention is given to common\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nSleep, however, it should be added, may be either profound, or light, or\r\nimperfect; in the two latter cases, the attention seems to be less\r\ncompletely suspended.\r\n\r\nSo, in sleep, it is the attention alone that really sleeps; the rest of\r\nthe mental powers and impulses are on the contrary in motion, but free\r\nand unchecked, obtaining their refreshment and renovation from\r\ngambolling about and stretching themselves. The inspector only slumbers;\r\nor, to use a closer figure, he retires to a sufficient distance from\r\nthem, not to be disturbed by any common noise they may make; any great\r\ndisturbance calls him back directly; likewise, he sits with his watch in\r\nhis hand, having a turn for noting the flight of time.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the above conception of the states of sleeping and\r\nwaking, the alternations of which compose our ordinary being, I have now\r\nto hold up another conception, resembling the first, of which it is the\r\ndouble,--but vaguer, more shadowy, of larger and gigantic proportions,\r\nfrom its novelty astonishing, like the mocking spectre of the Hartz;\r\nwhich is yet but your own shadow cast by the level sunbeams on the\r\nmorning mist.\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena embodied in this conception, I propose to denominate\r\nTrance. But let me premise that all do not belong to every instance of\r\ntrance. If I undertook to specify the external appearances of the human\r\nspecies, I must enunciate among other things, as colours of the skin,\r\nwhite, yellow, brown, black; as qualities of the hair, that it is\r\nflowing, soft, lanky, harsh, frizzled, woolly; but I should not mean\r\nthat every human being presented all these features.\r\n\r\nThen, as our ordinary being presents an alternation of sleeping and\r\nwaking, so does trance-existence. There is a trance-sleep and a\r\ntrance-waking to correspond with ordinary sleep and ordinary waking.\r\n\r\nAs natural sleep has different degrees of profoundness, so has trance\r\nsleep. They present a latitude so extensive, that it is convenient and\r\nallowable to lay down three different degrees or states of trance-sleep.\r\n\r\nThen, of trance-sleep first, and of its three degrees.\r\n\r\nThe deepest grade of trance-sleep extinguishes all the ordinary signs of\r\nanimation. It forms the condition in which many are buried alive. It is\r\nthe so-called vampyr state in the vampyr superstition. [See Letter II.\r\nof this series.]\r\n\r\nThe middle grade presents the appearance of profound unconsciousness;\r\nbut a gentle breathing and the circulation are distinguishable. The body\r\nis flexible, relaxed, perfectly impassive to ordinary stimuli. The\r\npupils of the eyes are not contracted, but yet are fixed. This state is\r\nwitnessed occasionally in hysteria, after violent fits of hysteric\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nIn the lightest degree of trance-sleep, the person can sustain itself\r\nsitting; the pupils are in the same state as above, or natural; the\r\napparent unconsciousness profound.\r\n\r\nTwo features characterise trance-sleep in all its grades. One, an\r\ninsensibility to all common stimulants, however violently applied; the\r\nother, an inward flow of ideas, a dream or vision. It is as well to\r\nprovide all words with a precise meaning. The term vision had better be\r\nrestricted to mean a dream during trance-sleep.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of Grando, who had been buried in the vampyr state, when\r\nthey were clumsily cutting his head off, makes no exception to the first\r\nof the above positions. He had then just emerged out of his\r\ntrance-sleep, either through the lapse of time, or from the admission of\r\nfresh air, or what not.\r\n\r\nIt will not be doubted that the mind may have visions in all the grades\r\nof trance-sleep, if it can be proved capable of them in the deepest;\r\ntherefore, one example will suffice for all three cases.\r\n\r\nHenry Engelbrecht, as we learn in a pamphlet published by himself in the\r\nyear 1639, after a most ascetic life, during which he had experienced\r\nsensorial illusions, was thrown for a brief period into the deepest form\r\nof trance-sleep, which event he thus describes:--\r\n\r\nIn the year 1623, exhausted by intense mental excitement of a religious\r\nkind, and by abstinence from food, after hearing a sermon which strongly\r\naffected him, he felt as if he could combat no more, so he gave in and\r\ntook to his bed. There he lay a week without tasting any thing but the\r\nbread and wine of the sacrament. On the eighth day, he thought he fell\r\ninto the death-struggle; death seemed to invade him from below upwards;\r\nhis body became rigid; his hands and feet insensible; his tongue and\r\nlips incapable of motion: gradually his sight failed him, but he still\r\nheard the laments and consultations of those around him. This gradual\r\ndemise lasted from mid-day till eleven at night, when he heard the\r\nwatchmen; then he lost consciousness of outward impressions. But an\r\nelaborate vision of immense detail began; the theme of which was, that\r\nhe was first carried down to hell, and looked into the place of torment;\r\nfrom thence, quicker than an arrow, was he borne to paradise. In these\r\nabodes of suffering and happiness, he saw and heard and smelt things\r\nunspeakable. These scenes, though long in apprehension, were short in\r\ntime, for he came enough to himself by twelve o'clock, again to hear the\r\nwatchmen. It took him another twelve hours to come round entirely. His\r\nhearing was first restored; then his sight, feeling, and motion\r\nfollowed; as soon as he could move his limbs, he rose. He felt himself\r\nstronger than before the trance.\r\n\r\nTrance-waking presents a great variety of phases; but it is sufficient\r\nfor a general outline of the subject to make or specify but two\r\ngrades--half-waking and full-waking.\r\n\r\nIn trance half-waking, the person rises, moves about with facility, will\r\nconverse even, but is almost wholly occupied with a dream, which he may\r\nbe said to act, and his perceptions and apprehensions are with\r\ndifficulty drawn to any thing out of the circle of that dream.\r\n\r\nIn trance full-waking, the person is completely alive to all or most of\r\nthe things passing around him, and would not be known by a stranger to\r\nbe otherwise than ordinarily awake.\r\n\r\nI propose to occupy the latter half of this letter with details of cases\r\nexemplifying these two states. Those which I shall select, will be\r\ninstances either of somnambulism, double consciousness, or catalepsy,\r\nthe popular phenomena of which I take this occasion of displaying. By\r\nthese details the following features will be proved to belong to\r\ntrance-waking.\r\n\r\n1. Common feeling, taste, and smell, are generally suspended in\r\ntrance-waking. In trance half-waking, sight is equally suspended. In\r\ntrance full-waking, every shade of modified sensibility up to perfect\r\npossession of sensation, presents itself in different cases, and\r\nsometimes in successive periods of the same cases.\r\n\r\n2. The general diminution or suspension of sensation is, as it were,\r\nmade up for, either by an intense acuteness of partial sensation, often\r\ndeveloped in an unaccustomed organ, or by some new mode of perception.\r\n\r\n3. The memory and circle of ideas are curiously circumscribed.\r\n\r\n4. To make up for this, some of the powers of the mind acquire\r\nconcentration and temporary increase of force, and occasionally new\r\npowers of apprehension appear to be developed.\r\n\r\n5. Spasms of the muscles, generally tonic or maintained spasms, but\r\nsometimes, having the character of convulsive struggles, are\r\noccasionally manifested in trance. And they may bear either of two\r\nrelations to it. They may occur simultaneously with trance-waking or\r\nalternately with it, and occupying the patient's frame in the intervals\r\nof trance.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of things, trance-sleep precedes trance-waking,\r\nand follows it. So that some have described trance-waking as waking in\r\ntrance. Trance-sleep may come on during ordinary sleep, or during\r\nordinary waking. By use the introductory and terminal states of\r\ntrance-sleep become abridged; and sometimes, if either exist, it is so\r\nbrief, that the transition to and from trance-waking out of and into\r\nordinary waking, _appears_ immediate.\r\n\r\nNow to illustrate the phenomena of trance half-waking, by describing\r\nsomnambulism.\r\n\r\nA curious fate somnambulism has had. When other forms of trance have\r\nbeen exalted into mystical phenomena and figure in history, somnambulism\r\nhas had no superstitious altars raised to her--has had no\r\nfear-worship--has at the highest been promoted to figure in an opera. Of\r\na quiet and homely nature, she has moved about the house, not like a\r\nvisiting demon, but as a maid of all work. To the public, the phenomenon\r\nhas presented no more interest than a soap-bubble or the fall of an\r\napple.\r\n\r\nSomnambulism is a form of half-waking trance which usually comes on\r\nduring the night, and in ordinary sleep. When it occurs in the daytime,\r\nthe attack of trance is still ordinarily preceded by a short period of\r\ncommon sleep.\r\n\r\nThe somnambulist then, half waking in trance, is disposed to rise and\r\nmove about. Sometimes his object seems a mere excursion, and then it is\r\nremarked that he shows a disposition to ascend heights. So he climbs,\r\nperhaps, to the roof of the house, and makes his way along it with\r\nagility and certainty: sometimes he is observed, where the tiles are\r\nloose, to try if they are secure before he advances. Generally these\r\nfeats are performed in safety. But occasionally, a somnambulist has\r\nmissed his footing, fallen, and perished. His greatest danger is from\r\nill-judged attempts to wake and warn him of his perilous situation.\r\nLuckily, it is not easy to wake him. He then returns, goes to bed,\r\nsleeps, and the next morning has no recollection of what he has done. In\r\nother cases, the somnambulist, on rising from his bed, betakes himself\r\nto his customary occupations, either to some handiwork, or to\r\ncomposition, or what not.\r\n\r\nThese three points are easily verifiable respecting his condition. He is\r\nin a dream, which he, as it were, acts after his thoughts; occasionally\r\nhe remembers on the following day some of the incidents of the night\r\nbefore, as part of a dream.\r\n\r\nBut his common sensibility to ordinary impressions is suspended: he does\r\nnot feel; his eyes are either shut, or open and fixed; he does not see;\r\nhe does not observe light, and works as well with as without it; he has\r\nnot taste or smell: the loudest noise makes no impression on him.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, to accomplish the feats he performs, the most accurate\r\n_perception_ of sensible objects is required. Of what nature is that of\r\nwhich he so marvellously evinces the possession? You may adopt the\r\nsimple hypothesis,--that the mind, being disengaged from its ordinary\r\nrelations to the senses, does without them, and perceives things\r\ndirectly. Or you may suppose, if you prefer it, that the mind still\r\nemploys sensation, using only impressions that in ordinary waking are\r\nnot consciously attended to, for its more wonderful feats; and otherwise\r\ncommon sensation, which, however generally suspended, may be awakened by\r\nthe dreaming attention to its objects.\r\n\r\nThe following case of somnambulism, in which the seizure supervened, in\r\na girl affected with St Vitus's dance, and combined itself with that\r\ndisorder, is given by Lord Monboddo:--\r\n\r\nThe patient, about sixteen years of age, used to be commonly taken in\r\nthe morning a few hours after rising. The approach of the seizure was\r\nannounced by a sense of weight in the head, a drowsiness which quickly\r\nterminated in sleep, in which her eyes were fast shut. She described a\r\nfeeling beginning in the feet, creeping like a gradual chill higher and\r\nhigher, till it reached the heart, when consciousness or recollection\r\nleft her. Being in this state, she sprang from her seat about the room,\r\nover tables and chairs, with the astonishing agility belonging to St\r\nVitus's dance. Then, if she succeeded in getting out of the house, she\r\nran at a pace with which her elder brother could hardly keep up, to a\r\nparticular spot in the neighbourhood, taking the directest but the\r\nroughest path. If she could not manage otherwise, she got over the\r\ngarden-wall with surprising rapidity and precision of movement. Her eyes\r\nwere all the time fast closed. The impulse to visit this spot she was\r\noften conscious of during the approach of the paroxysm, and, afterwards,\r\nshe sometimes thought she had dreamed of going thither. Towards the\r\ntermination of her indisposition, she dreamed that the water of a\r\nneighbouring spring would do her good, and she drank much of it. One\r\ntime they tried to cheat her by giving her water from another spring,\r\nbut she immediately detected the difference. Towards the end, she\r\nforetold that she would have three paroxysms more, and then be well--and\r\nso it proved.\r\n\r\nThe following case is from a communication by M. Pigatti, published in\r\nthe July Number of the _Journal Encyclopedique_ of the year 1762. The\r\nsubject was a servant of the name of Negretti, in the household of the\r\nMarquis Sale.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Negretti would seat himself in a chair in the anteroom,\r\nwhen he commonly fell asleep, and would sleep quietly for a quarter of\r\nan hour. He then righted himself in his chair, so as to sit up. [This\r\nwas the moment of transition from ordinary sleep into trance.] Then he\r\nsat some time without motion, as if he saw something. Then he rose and\r\nwalked about the room. On one occasion, he drew out his snuff-box and\r\nwould have taken a pinch, but there was little in it; whereupon he\r\nwalked up to an empty chair, and addressing by name a cavalier whom he\r\nsupposed to be sitting in it, asked him for a pinch. One of those who\r\nwere watching the scene, here held towards him an open box, from which\r\nhe took snuff. Afterwards he fell into the posture of a person who\r\nlistens; he seemed to think that he heard an order, and thereupon\r\nhastened with a wax-candle in his hand, to a spot where a light usually\r\nstood. As soon as he imagined that he had lit the candle, he walked with\r\nit in the proper manner, through the _salle_, down the steps, turning\r\nand waiting from time to time, as if he had been lighting some one down.\r\nArrived at the door, he placed himself sideways, so as to let the\r\nimaginary persons pass, and he bowed as he let them out. He then\r\nextinguished the light, returned up the stairs, and sat himself down\r\nagain in his place, to play the same farce over again once or twice the\r\nsame evening. When in this condition, he would lay the tablecloth, place\r\nthe chairs, which he sometimes brought from a distant room, and opening\r\nand shutting the doors as he went, with exactness; would take decanters\r\nfrom the _beauffet_, fill them with water at the spring, put them on a\r\nwaiter, and so on. All the objects _that were concerned in these\r\noperations_, he distinguished where they were before him with the same\r\nprecision and certainty as if he had been in the full use of his senses.\r\nOtherwise he seemed to observe nothing--so, on one occasion, in passing\r\na table, he upset a waiter with two decanters upon it, which fell and\r\nbroke, without exciting his attention. The dominant idea had entire\r\npossession of him. He would prepare a salad with correctness, and sit\r\ndown and eat it. Then, if they changed it, the trick passed without his\r\nnotice. In this manner he would go on eating cabbage, or even pieces of\r\ncake, seemingly without observing the difference. The taste he enjoyed\r\nwas imaginary; the sense was shut. On another occasion, when he asked\r\nfor wine, they gave him water, which he drank for wine, and remarked\r\nthat his stomach felt the better for it. On a fellow-servant touching\r\nhis legs with a stick, the idea arose in his mind that it was a dog, and\r\nhe scolded to drive it away; but the servant continuing his game,\r\nNegretti took a whip to beat the dog. The servant drew off when Negretti\r\nbegan whistling and coaxing to get the dog near him; so they threw a\r\nmuff against his legs, which he belaboured soundly.\r\n\r\nM. Pigatti watched these proceedings with great attention, and convinced\r\nhimself by many trials that Negretti did not use his senses. The\r\nsuspension of taste was shown by his not distinguishing between salad\r\nand cake. He did not hear the loudest sound, when it lay out of the\r\ncircle of his dreaming ideas. If a light was held close to his eyes,\r\nnear enough to singe his eyebrows, he did not appear to be aware of it.\r\nHe seemed to feel nothing when they inserted a feather into his\r\nnostrils. The ordinary sensibility of his organs seemed withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the most interesting case of somnambulism on record, is that\r\nof a young ecclesiastic, the narrative of which, from the immediate\r\ncommunication of an Archbishop of Bordeaux, is given under the head of\r\nsomnambulism in the French Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\nThis young ecclesiastic, when the archbishop was at the same seminary,\r\nused to rise every night, and write out either sermons or pieces of\r\nmusic. To study his condition, the archbishop betook himself several\r\nnights consecutively to the chamber of the young man, where he made the\r\nfollowing observations.\r\n\r\nThe young man used to rise, to take paper, and to write. Before he wrote\r\nmusic, he would take a stick and rule the lines with it. He wrote the\r\nnotes, together with the words corresponding with them, with perfect\r\ncorrectness. Or, when he had written the words too wide, he altered\r\nthem. The notes that were to be black, he filled in after he had written\r\nthe whole. After completing a sermon, he read it aloud from beginning to\r\nend. If any passage displeased him, he erased it, and wrote the amended\r\npassage correctly over the other; on one occasion he had to substitute\r\nthe word \"_adorable_\" for \"_divin_;\" but he did not omit to alter the\r\npreceding \"_ce_\" into \"_cet_,\" by adding the letter \"_t_\" with exact\r\nprecision to the word first written. To ascertain whether he used his\r\neyes, the archbishop interposed a sheet of pasteboard between the\r\nwriting and his face. He took not the least notice, but went on writing\r\nas before. The limitation of his perceptions to what he was thinking\r\nabout was very curious. A bit of aniseed cake, that he had sought for,\r\nhe eat approvingly; but when, on another occasion, a piece of the same\r\ncake was put in his month, he spit it out without observation. The\r\nfollowing instance of the dependance of his perceptions upon, or rather\r\ntheir subordination to, his preconceived ideas is truly wonderful. It is\r\nto be observed that he always knew when his pen had ink in it.\r\nLikewise, if they adroitly changed his papers, when he was writing, he\r\nknew it, if the sheet substituted was of a different size from the\r\nformer, and he appeared embarrassed in that case. But if the fresh sheet\r\nof paper, which was substituted for that written on, was exactly of the\r\nsame size with the former, he appeared not to be aware of the change.\r\nAnd he would continue to read off his composition from the blank sheet\r\nof paper, as fluently as when the manuscript itself lay before him; nay,\r\nmore, he would continue his corrections, and introduce the amended\r\npassage, writing it upon exactly the place on the blank sheet which it\r\nwould have occupied on the written page.\r\n\r\nThe form of trance which has been thus exemplified may be therefore well\r\ncalled half-waking, inasmuch as the performer, whatever his powers of\r\nperception may be in respect to the object he is thinking of, is\r\nnevertheless lost in dream, and blind and deaf to every thing without\r\nits scope.\r\n\r\nThe following case may serve as a suitable transition to instances of\r\nfull-waking in trance. The subject of it alternated evidently between\r\nthat state and half-waking. Or she, could be at once roused from the\r\nlatter into the former by the conversation of her friends. The case is\r\nrecorded in the Acta Vratisl. ann. 1722, Feb. class iv., art. 2.\r\n\r\nA girl seventeen years of age was used to fall into a kind of sleep in\r\nthe afternoon, in which it was supposed, from her expression of\r\ncountenance and her gestures, that she was engaged in dreams which\r\ninterested her. After some days, she began to speak when in this state.\r\nThen, if those present addressed remarks to her, she replied very\r\nsensibly; but then fell back into her dream-discourse, which turned\r\nprincipally upon religious and moral topics, and was directed to warn\r\nher friends how a female should live, Christianly, well-governed, and so\r\nas to incur no reproach. When she sang, which often happened, she heard\r\nherself accompanied by an imaginary violin or piano, and would take up\r\nand continue the accompaniment upon an instrument herself. She sewed,\r\ndid knitting, and the like. But on the other hand, she imagined on one\r\noccasion that she wrote a letter upon a napkin, which she folded with\r\nthe intention of sending it to the post. Upon waking, she had not the\r\nleast recollection of her dreams, or of what she had been doing. After a\r\nfew months she recovered.\r\n\r\nI come now to the exemplification of full-waking in trance, as it is\r\nvery perfectly manifested in the cases which have been termed double\r\nconsciousness. These are in their principle very simple; but it is not\r\neasy in a few words to convey a distinct idea of the condition of the\r\npatient. The case consists of a series of fits of trance, in which the\r\nstep from ordinary waking to full trance-waking is sudden and immediate,\r\nor nearly so, and either was so originally, or through use has become\r\nso. Generally for some hours on each day, occasionally for days\r\ntogether, the patient continues in the state of trance; then suddenly\r\nreverts to that of ordinary waking. In the perfectest instances of\r\ndouble consciousness, there is nothing in the bearing or behaviour of\r\nthe entranced person which would lead a stranger to suppose her (for it\r\nis an affection far commoner in young women than in boys or men) to be\r\nother than ordinarily awaked. But her friends observe that she does\r\nevery thing with more spirit and better--sings better, plays better, has\r\nmore readiness, moves even more gracefully, than in her natural state.\r\nShe has an innocent boldness and disregard of little conventionalisms,\r\nwhich imparts a peculiar charm to her behaviour. In the mean time, she\r\nhas two complete existences separate and apart, which alternate but\r\nnever mingle. On the day of her first fit, her life split into a double\r\nseries of thoughts and recollections. She remembers in her ordinary\r\nstate nothing of her trance existence. In her trances, she remembers\r\nnothing of the intervening hours of ordinary waking. Her recollections\r\nof what she had experienced or learned before the fits began is\r\nsingularly capricious, differing extraordinarily in its extent in\r\ndifferent cases. In general, the positive recollection of prior events\r\nis annulled; but her prior affections and habits either remain, and her\r\ngeneral acquirements, or they are quickly by association rekindled or\r\nbrought into the circle of her trance ideas. Generally she names all her\r\nfriends anew; often her tone of voice is a little altered; sometimes she\r\nintroduces with particular combinations of letters some odd inflection,\r\nwhich she maintains rigorously and cannot unlearn.\r\n\r\nKeeping before him this conception, the reader will comprehend the\r\nfollowing sketch of a case of double consciousness, communicated by Dr\r\nGeorge Barlow. To one reading them without preparation, the details,\r\nwhich are very graphic and instructive, would appear mere confusion:--\r\n\r\n\"This young lady has two states of existence. During the time that the\r\nfit is on her, which varies from a few hours to three days, she is\r\noccasionally merry and in spirits; occasionally she appears in pain and\r\nrolls about in uneasiness; but in general she seems so much herself,\r\nthat a stranger entering the room would not remark any thing\r\nextraordinary; she amuses herself with reading or working, sometimes\r\nplays on the piano and better than at other times, knows every body, and\r\nconverses rationally, and makes very accurate observations on what she\r\nhas seen and read. The fit leaves her suddenly, and she then forgets\r\nevery thing that has passed during it, and imagines that she has been\r\nasleep, and sometimes that she has dreamed of any circumstance that has\r\nmade a vivid impression upon her. During one of these fits she was\r\nreading Miss Edgeworth's tales, and had in the morning been reading a\r\npart of one of them to her mother, when she went for a few minutes to\r\nthe window, and suddenly exclaimed, 'Mamma, I am quite well, my headach\r\nis gone.' Returning to the table, she took up the open volume, which she\r\nhad been reading five minutes before, and said, 'What book is this?' she\r\nturned over the leaves, looked at the frontispiece, and replaced it on\r\nthe table. Seven or eight hours afterwards, when the fit returned, she\r\nasked for the book, went on at the very paragraph where she had left\r\noff, and remembered every circumstance of the narrative. And so it\r\nalways is; as she reads one set of books during one state, and another\r\nduring the other. She seems to be conscious of her state; for she said\r\none day, 'Mamma, this is a novel, but I may safely read it; it will not\r\nhurt my morals, for, when I am well, I shall not remember a word of\r\nit.'\"\r\n\r\nThis state of double consciousness forms the basis of the psychical\r\nphenomena observed in the extraordinary cases which have been\r\noccasionally described under the general name of catalepsy. The accounts\r\nof the most interesting of these that I have met with, were given by M.\r\nPetatin in 1787; M. Delpet, 1807; Dr Despine, 1829. The wonderful powers\r\nof perception evinced by the patients when in this state of\r\ntrance-waking would exceed belief, but for the respectable names of the\r\nobservers, and the internal evidence of good faith and accuracy in the\r\nnarratives themselves. The patients did not see with their eyes nor hear\r\nwith their ears. But they heard at the pit of the stomach, and perceived\r\nthe approach of persons when at some distance from their residence, and\r\nread the thoughts of those around.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear Archy, no wonder-monger; so I am not tempted to make a\r\nparade to you of these extraordinary phenomena. Nor in truth do they\r\ninterest me further than as they concur with the numerous other facts I\r\nhave brought forward to show, and positively prove, that under certain\r\nconditions the mind enters into new relations, spiritual and material. I\r\nwill, however, in conclusion, give you the outline of a case of the sort\r\nwhich occurred a few years ago in England, and the details of which were\r\ncommunicated to me by the late Mr Bulteel. He had himself repeatedly\r\nseen the patient, and had scrupulously verified what I now narrate to\r\nyou:--\r\n\r\nThe patient was towards twenty years of age. Her condition was the state\r\nof double consciousness, _thus_ aggravated, that when she was not in the\r\ntrance, she suffered from spasmodic contraction of the limbs. In her\r\nalternate state of trance-waking, she was composed and apparently well;\r\nbut the expression of her countenance was slightly altered, and there\r\nwas some peculiarity in her mode of speaking. She would mispronounce\r\ncertain letters, or introduce consonants into words upon a regular\r\nsystem; and to each of her friends she had given a new name, which she\r\nonly employed in her trance. As usual, she knew nothing in either state\r\nof what passed in the other. Then in her trance she exhibited three\r\nmarvellous powers: she could read by the touch alone: if she pressed her\r\nhand against the whole surface of a written or printed page, she\r\nacquired a perfect knowledge of its contents, not of the substance only,\r\nbut of the words, and would criticise the type or the handwriting. A\r\nline of a folded note pressed against the back of her neck, she read\r\nequally well: she called this sense-feeling. Contact was necessary for\r\nit. Her sense of smell was at the same time singularly acute; when out\r\nriding one day, she said, \"There is a violet,\" and cantered her horse\r\nfifty yards to where it grew. Persons whom she knew she could tell were\r\napproaching the house, when yet at some distance. When persons were\r\nplaying chess at a table _behind her_, and intentionally made impossible\r\nmoves, she would smile, and ask them why they did it.\r\n\r\nCases of this description are no doubt of rare occurrence. Yet not a\r\nyear passes in London without something transpiring of the existence of\r\none or more of them in the huge metropolis. Medical men view them with\r\nunpardonable indifference. Thus one doctor told me of a lady, whom he\r\nhad been attending with other physicians, who, it appeared, always\r\nannounced that they were coming some minutes before they drove to her\r\ndoor. It was very odd, he thought, and there was an end of it.\r\n\r\n\"M. l'Abbe,\" said Voltaire to a visitor, who gave him a commonplace\r\naccount of some remarkable scenes, \"do you know in what respect you\r\ndiffer from Don Quixote?\"--\"No,\" said the Abbe, not half liking the look\r\nof the question. \"Why, M. l'Abbe, Don Quixote took the inns on the road\r\nfor castles, but you have taken castles for inns.\"\r\n\r\n    Adieu, dear Archy.--Yours, &c.\r\n                        MAC DAVUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR SONNETS BY ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LIFE.\r\n\r\n    Each creature holds an insular point in space;\r\n    Yet, what man stirs a finger, breathes a sound,\r\n    But all the multitudinous beings round\r\n    In all the countless worlds, with time and place\r\n    For their conditions, down to the central base,\r\n    Thrill, haply, in vibration and rebound;\r\n    Life answering life across the vast profound,\r\n    In full antiphony, by a common grace?--\r\n    I think this sudden joyaunce, which illumes\r\n    A child's mouth sleeping, unaware may run\r\n    From some soul breaking new the bond of tombs:\r\n    I think this passionate sigh, which, half begun,\r\n    I stifle back, may reach and stir the plumes\r\n    Of God's calm angel standing in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LOVE.\r\n\r\n    We cannot live, except thus mutually\r\n    We alternate, aware or unaware,\r\n    The reflex act of life: and when we bear\r\n    Our virtue outward most impulsively,\r\n    Most full of invocation, and to be\r\n    Most instantly compellant, certes, there,\r\n    We live most life, whoever breathes most air\r\n    And counts his dying years by sun and sea!\r\n    But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth\r\n    Show out her full force on another soul,\r\n    The conscience and the concentration, both,\r\n    Make mere life, Love! For life in perfect whole\r\n    And aim consummated, is Love in sooth,\r\n    As nature's magnet-heat rounds pole with pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. HEAVEN AND EARTH. 1845.\r\n\r\n\"And there was silence in heaven for the space of half an\r\nhour.\"--_Revelation._\r\n\r\n    God, who with thunders and great voices kept\r\n    Beneath thy throne, and stars most silver-paced\r\n    Along the inferior gyres, and open-faced\r\n    Melodious angels round, canst intercept\r\n    Music with music, yet, at will, hast swept\r\n    All back--all back--(said he in Patmos placed)\r\n    To fill the heavens with silence of the waste,\r\n    Which lasted half an hour! Lo! I, who have wept\r\n    All day and night, beseech Thee by my tears,\r\n    And by that dread response of curse and groan\r\n    Men alternate across these hemispheres,\r\n    Vouchsafe as such a half-hour's hush alone,\r\n    In compensation of our noisy years!\r\n    As heaven has paused from song, let earth, from moan.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE PROSPECT. 1845.\r\n\r\n    Methinks we do as fretful children do,\r\n    Leaning their faces on the window-pane\r\n    To sigh the glass dim with their own breath's stain,\r\n    And shut the sky and landscape from their view.\r\n    And thus, alas! since God the maker drew\r\n    A mystic separation twixt those twain,\r\n    The life beyond us and our souls in pain,\r\n    We lose the prospect which we are called unto,\r\n    By grief we are fools to use. Be still and strong,\r\n    O man, my brother! hold thy sobbing breath,\r\n    And keep thy soul's large window pure from wrong,\r\n    That so, as life's appointment issueth,\r\n    Thy vision may be clear to watch along\r\n    The sunset consummation-lights of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSAURA: A TALE OF MADRID.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourteen years have elapsed since there dwelt in Madrid a certain\r\nstudent, who went by the name of El Rojo, or the Red. Not by his\r\nacquaintances and intimates alone was he thus designated, but by all the\r\nvarious classes of idlers with whom the Spanish capital abounds; by the\r\nlistless loiterers at the coffee-house doors, by the lounging gossips of\r\nthe Puerta del Sol, and by the cloaked saunterers who, when the siesta\r\nis over, pace the Calle Alcala, puffing their beloved Havanas, retailing\r\nthe latest news, discussing the chances of a change of ministry, or the\r\nmost recent and interesting scandalous anecdote current in that gallant\r\nmetropolis. It would be wrong to infer, from his somewhat ambiguous\r\nappellation, that the student's skin had the copper hue of a Pawnee or\r\nan Osage, or his hair the ruddy tint usually deemed detrimental and\r\nunbecoming. The name implied no sneer--it was given and taken as a\r\ncompliment; and Federico was at least as proud of it as of the abundant\r\ngolden curls to which he owed it, and that flowed in waving luxuriance\r\ndown his graceful neck and over his well-formed shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn southern climes, where the ardent sun embrowns the children of the\r\nsoil, fair locks and eyes of azure are prized in proportion to their\r\nrarity. No wonder, then, that Federico found favour in the sight of the\r\ndark-browed and inflammable Madrilenas. Many were the tender glances\r\ndarted at him from beneath veil and mantilla, as he took his evening\r\nstroll upon the Prado; oftentimes, when he passed along the street,\r\nwhite and slender fingers, protruded through half-closed _jalousies_,\r\ndropped upon his handsome head a shower of fragrant jasmin blossoms.\r\nAmongst the dames and damsels who thus signified their favour and\r\npartiality, not a few--so it is certified by the veracious authority\r\nwhence we derive this history--dwelt in stately mansions, and went\r\nabroad in brave equipage, drawn by prancing steeds and comely mules, all\r\nglittering with trappings of silk and gold. These, it may be thought,\r\ncondescended overmuch thus to notice an humble student. But the\r\nlove-breathing daughters of Castile reck little of rank and station; and\r\nFederico, by all personal endowments, well deserved the distinction he\r\nobtained. Poor hidalgo though he was, no count or duke, or blue-blooded\r\ngrandee, from Cadiz to Corunua, bore himself better, or had more the\r\nmien of a well-born and thorough-bred _caballero_. None more gallantly\r\nwore the broad-leafed sombrero, none more gracefully draped the ample\r\ncloak; and all Spain might have been searched in vain to match the\r\nbright and joyous glance of the student's dark-blue eye. Excepting on\r\nthe coast, and in certain districts where Mahomedan forefathers have\r\nbequeathed their oriental physiognomy and tall slender frame to their\r\nChristian descendants, Spaniards are rarely of very lofty stature.\r\nFederico was from the flat and arid province of La Mancha, where, as in\r\ncompensation for the unproductiveness of the parched soil, handsome men\r\nand beauteous women abound. Of the middle height, his figure was\r\nsymmetrical, elastic, and muscular, formed for feats of agility and\r\nstrength; his step was light, but firm; his countenance manly,--the\r\nexpression of his regular and agreeable features denoted a passionate\r\nnature and lofty character. Like most of his countrymen, he was quickly\r\nroused, but easy to appease. Generosity and forbearance were prominent\r\namongst his good qualities; and he had nobly displayed them in more than\r\none encounter with antagonists, whose feebleness placed them at his\r\nmercy, and rendered them unworthy of his wrath. For in the use of arms,\r\nas in all manly exercises, Federico was an adept; and whether with\r\nToledo blade, or _Majo's_ knife, there were few men in Spain who would\r\nnot have found in him a formidable and dangerous adversary.\r\n\r\nStrange to tell of so young a man, and of a Spaniard, in one respect our\r\nstudent appeared passionless. He met the advances of his female admirers\r\nwith the utmost coldness--seemed, indeed, to avoid the society of the\r\nfair sex, threw love-letters into the fire, unread and unanswered,\r\nneglected invitations, went to no rendezvous. Favours which other men\r\nwould gladly have purchased with years of life, he disdainfully\r\nrejected. The wrinkled duennas, who under various pretexts brought him\r\ntender messages and tempting assignations, met, instead of the golden\r\nguerdon with which such Mercuries are usually rewarded, harsh rebuffs\r\nand cutting sarcasm at the hands of the stoic of two-and-twenty. And\r\nwith so much scorn did this Manchegan Joseph repel on one occasion the\r\namorous attentions of a lady of birth and station, that her indiscreet\r\nlove was changed into bitter hate, and Federico narrowly escaped a\r\ndagger-stab and a premature death. From that day, he was more\r\ninaccessible than ever, not only to women, but to men. Gradually he\r\nwithdrew from intercourse with his former associates and was seldom seen\r\nin the streets or public places, but sat at home, buried amongst books,\r\nand diligently studying, with the intention, he was heard to declare, of\r\ngoing to Ciudad Real, and passing his examination as advocate in the\r\nroyal courts. And thus, little by little, it happened with Federico as\r\nit does with most persons who neglect and forget the world, the world\r\nforgot him. His old intimates--joyous, light-hearted lads, revelling in\r\nthe enjoyments and dissipation of the capital--voted him a spoil-sport\r\nand a pedant, and thought of him no more: friends, in the true sense of\r\nthe word, he had none; and so, after a very short time, the list of\r\nvisitors to the gloomy old apartment in which the eccentric youth mused\r\nand studied was reduced to one man, and that a very odd one, but whom\r\nFederico loved, because he in some sort owed him his life.\r\n\r\nThis second hero of our tale was one of those strange characters to be\r\nmet with in Spain only. Don Geronimo Regato was a little wizened old\r\ncreature, blind of an eye, and with a very ugly face, whose life had\r\nbeen a series of extraordinary adventures and bustling incidents. He had\r\nserved his country in the most opposite capacities. In 1808, he fought\r\nthe French in the streets of Madrid; two years later, he headed a\r\nguerilla band in the wild passes of the Sierra Morena; another two\r\nyears, and he took the oath to the constitution of Cadiz, and was seen\r\nat Wellington's head-quarters as colonel of the Spanish line, and\r\ndelegate from the Cortes. In 1814, he changed his colours, and was\r\nnoted, after the return of Ferdinand VII., as a stanch royalist. But\r\nvariety was his motto; and the revolution of 1820 saw him in the ranks\r\nof the Liberals, to whom he continued faithful until their cause was\r\nruined and hopeless. That was the signal, with this Talleyrand on a\r\nsmall scale, for another _vuelta casaca_: once more he turned his coat;\r\nand as an earnest of penitence for past offences, opened to the Royalist\r\ntroops the gates of a small Estremaduran fortress. Notwithstanding this\r\nact of tardy allegiance, he was thrown into prison at Madrid, and owed\r\nit entirely to the intercession and good offices of an old schoolfellow,\r\nthe influential Father Cyrillo, that his neck was not brought into\r\nunpleasant contact with the iron hoop of the _garrote_. Either warned by\r\nthis narrow escape, or because the comparatively tranquil state of Spain\r\nafforded no scope for his restless activity, since 1823 this political\r\nProteus had lived in retirement, eschewing apparently all plots and\r\nintrigues; although he was frequently seen in the very highest circles\r\nof the capital, where his great experience, his conversational powers,\r\nand social qualities sufficiently accounted for the welcome he at all\r\ntimes met.\r\n\r\nReturning late one night from a tertulia at the house of Ferdinand's\r\nprime minister, Don Geronimo heard the clash of steel and sound of a\r\nscuffle, and hurrying to the spot, saw a young man defending himself\r\nagainst the attack of two bravos. Forthwith Regato set himself to shout\r\nout words of command, as if he had a whole regiment at his back, and the\r\nruffians, thinking the patrol was upon them, instantly took to flight.\r\nFederico was the person assailed; and although he boldly asserted and\r\ndoubtlessly fully believed, that, left to himself, he would speedily\r\nhave defeated his cowardly opponents, he was still not altogether sorry\r\nto be relieved from such odds by the old gentleman's timely arrival and\r\ningenious stratagem. This was the origin of his acquaintance with\r\nRegato. From that night forward they visited each other, and soon\r\nGeronimo took particular pleasure in the society of the handsome youth,\r\nwhose earnestness and vigour of mind, he said, were refreshing to\r\ncontemplate in a century when the actions of most men made them resemble\r\nbeasts and apes, rather than beings formed in the image of their\r\nCreator. The young student, for his part, found much to interest him in\r\nhis new friend, the only person who now varied the monotony of his\r\nsolitude. He listened eagerly to Regato's discourse, as he alternately\r\npoured out his stores of knowledge and experience, and broke into a vein\r\nof keen and bitter sarcasm on the men, parties, and circumstances of\r\ndistracted and unhappy Spain. Federico enthusiastically loved his\r\ncountry, and his proud eyes often filled with tears when the old man\r\nplaced its former greatness in striking contrast with its present\r\ndegradation. In spite of all the veerings and weathercock variations of\r\nhis political life, Regato was at heart a Liberal. He set forth in\r\nglowing colours the evils and tyranny of Ferdinand's government,\r\nexpatiated on the barbarous executions of Riego, Torrijos, and other\r\nmartyrs to freedom's cause, and exposed the corruption and villany of\r\nthe men who retained their country in the bonds of slavery and\r\nfanaticism; until Federico's cheeks glowed, and heart beat quick with\r\npatriotic indignation, and he felt that he too, when the battle-hour\r\nshould strike, would joyfully draw his sword and lose his life for the\r\nliberation of the land he loved so well. At times the student would take\r\ndown his guitar, and sing, with closed doors and windows--for\r\nFerdinand's spies were, a quick-eared legion--the spirit-stirring Hymn\r\nof the Constitution, or the wild Tragala--that Spanish Marseillaise, to\r\nwhose exciting notes rivers of blood have flowed. And then old Regato\r\nbeat time with his hand, and his solitary eye gleamed like a ball of\r\nfire, whilst he mingled his hoarse and suppressed bass with Federico's\r\nmellow tenor.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their vast difference of age and character, and although\r\nthe one was but commencing, whilst the other had nearly run, the up-hill\r\nrace of life, the more these two men saw of each other the stronger grow\r\ntheir sympathy and friendship. Don Geronimo's visits to the student\r\nbecame more and more frequent, and often, forgetful or careless of the\r\ntime, they would sit talking till far into the night. It seemed a relief\r\nto Regato to disburden his heart and mind of their innermost secrets;\r\nand he rejoiced to have found a man to whose honour, truth, and secresy,\r\nhe felt he could safely entrust them. Federico repaid his confidence\r\nwith one equally unlimited. He not only told his friend the history of\r\nhis short life from infancy upwards, but he made him his father\r\nconfessor, informed him of the progress of his studies, confided to him\r\nhis doubts and hopes, his religious creed and political aspirations, and\r\neven his connexion with some of the secret orders and societies, of\r\nwhich, at that period, notwithstanding the vigilance of the police, a\r\nmultitude existed in Spain.\r\n\r\n\"And can it be, my young friend,\" said Geronimo one evening, when a\r\nbrief pause succeeded to some of the fiery Federico's vehement political\r\ndiatribes--\"can it be,\" he said, fixing his penetrating eye upon the\r\nflushed and impassioned countenance of the student, \"that you have\r\nreached your present age and never loved woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" replied the student, \"you have asked the question before, and I\r\nhave answered it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But 'tis incomprehensible, and out of nature,\" cried the old Don. \"Why\r\nhave you a heart in your bosom, blood in your veins, strong limbs, and\r\nbright eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was all that given me that I might love woman?\" retorted Federico with\r\na merry laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly: what is life worth, without love to sweeten it? Nothing,\r\nworse than nothing. It is that gentle sympathy of hearts, that strange\r\nfever of the soul, those sweet hopes and joyous transports, and tremors\r\nscarce less pleasing, that render life endurable, and reconcile man to\r\nthe vileness of mortality. The nearest approach to paradise on earth, is\r\nfound in bright eyes that beam for us alone--in gentle lips that murmur\r\nto our ears words of pure tenderness and unselfish affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Virgin!\" cried Federico, \"I am neither of wood nor stone. Yes,\r\nthere are creatures of heavenly beauty whom I _could_ love. But I am\r\nlike the Moorish Prince of Granada, who was too proud to eat common\r\nfood, and fed on gold. The metal was over hard for his royal stomach,\r\nand so he starved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which means that what you could have, you don't like, and what you\r\nwould like, you can't get.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possible,\" replied Federico smiling. \"I strike high.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not? To dare is often to succeed. For the bold and the prudent,\r\nno aim is too lofty. But tell me more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" cried the student. \"I did but jest. It occurred to me that\r\nthis very day I saw a lady whose fair face I shall not easily forget.\r\nShe was richly dressed, and sat in an open carriage, drawn by\r\nmagnificent horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"What colour was the carriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brown, lined with purple velvet. The arms on the panels were supported\r\nby coroneted griffins; and on the luxurious cushions my goddess\r\nreclined, in a robe of rose-coloured satin. A black lace mantilla\r\nfloated over her alabaster shoulders, further veiled by a cloud of\r\nglossy ebon hair; and her eyes, friend Geronimo--her beauteous eyes,\r\nwere soft and heavenly as a spring day in the almond groves of\r\nValencia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are poetical,\" said Regato. \"A good sign. Federico, you are in\r\nlove; but, by our Lady, you are audacious in your choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know her?\" eagerly exclaimed Federico.\r\n\r\n\"Did she appear to notice you?\" inquired Geronimo, leaving the question\r\nunanswered.\r\n\r\n\"Paralysed by her exceeding beauty,\" replied the student, \"I stood dumb\r\nand motionless in the carriage-way, and was nearly run over. I sprang\r\naside, but just in time. She observed me, and smiled: I almost think she\r\nblushed. One thing I am sure of, she could not help seeing that her\r\nwondrous beauty had turned my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is all?\" said Regato, slyly.\r\n\r\n\"What more could there be?\" cried the young lawyer, indignantly. \"Would\r\nyou have such an angel throw flowers at me, or appoint a rendezvous?\r\nWhen the carriage turned out of the street towards the Prado, she looked\r\nback. Holy Mother of Sorrows! even at that distance, the sunshine of\r\nthose eyes scorched my very heart!--But this is folly, sheer folly! Next\r\nweek I go to Ciudad Real, and amongst dusty deeds and dry folios I shall\r\nsoon forget eyes and their owner.\"\r\n\r\nSenor Regato assumed a thoughtful countenance, took a large pinch of\r\nsnuff, and lit a fresh cigar. After three or four puffs, emitted through\r\nhis nostrils with the delectation of a veteran smoker, he broke silence.\r\n\r\n\"You will not go to Ciudad Real.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" cried Federico.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if I am not greatly mistaken, you will remain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange if I do!\" laughed the student.\r\n\r\n\"Less so, perhaps, than you imagine. Would you go if the rose-coloured\r\nlady bid you stay? What if she sent a tender billet to the young\r\nwoman-hater, and said, 'Come and love me, if you have the heart and\r\ncourage of a man.' I think I see you then, though ten thousand devils\r\nbarred the way. Ciudad Real and the royal courts would soon be\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Federico. \"But you tantalise me with\r\nimpossibilities.\"\r\n\r\nDon Geronimo put on his hat, took his young friend's hand, and said with\r\ngreat gravity,--\"Nothing is impossible. And as regards love, nought in\r\nthis world can withstand it--no bolt, or lock, or bar, or rank, or\r\npower. Bear that in mind, and be of good courage, if you again fall in\r\nwith her of the rose-coloured robe. I should not wonder if you saw her\r\nthis very night. Be happy whilst you may, whilst youth and beauty last.\r\nThey quickly pass, and never return; and in love be adventurous and\r\nbold, like a true Spaniard and gallant gentleman. Daring wins the day.\"\r\n\r\nHe departed. Federico remained alone. With a smile at his friend's\r\nadvice, the young man sat down to study. But he soon started up, and\r\ngazed like one in a dream at the massive volumes encumbering his table.\r\nHe knew not how it happened, but the well-known letters of the alphabet\r\nseemed changed into inexplicable hieroglyphics. The simplest passages\r\nwere wholly unintelligible; the paragraphs were all rose-coloured; black\r\nlocks and brilliant eyes twined and sparkled through the quaint\r\narabesques and angular capitals that commenced each chapter of the code,\r\nconfusing and dazzling his brain. At last he angrily slammed the\r\nparchment-bound volume, muttered a curse on his own folly, then laughed\r\naloud at the recollection of that comical old fellow, Geronimo Regato,\r\nand went to bed. There he found little rest. When he closed his eyes,\r\nthe slender form of the incognita glided before them. Her white hand,\r\nextended from beneath her mantilla, beckoned him to follow; nay, he felt\r\nthe pressure of the tiny fingers, her warm breath upon his cheek, her\r\nvelvet lips gently laid to his. And when he started from his sleep, it\r\nwas to fancy the rustle of a dress, and a sweet low voice that timidly\r\nuttered his name. So passed the night, and only towards daybreak did he\r\nsink into a sounder and more refreshing slumber. But when he arose, he\r\nfound, to his consternation, that she who had haunted his dreams was\r\nequally present to his waking imagination. The fascinating image of the\r\nbeautiful stranger had established itself in his heart, and Federico\r\nfelt that all efforts to dislodge it would be as fruitless as painful.\r\n\r\n\"If I believed in sorcery,\" he soliloquised, \"I should think that old\r\nrogue Geronimo had cast a charm over me. He predicted that she would\r\nvisit me this night, and truly she has done so, and here remains.\r\nWhether it be for the best, I greatly doubt.\"\r\n\r\nMusing on the fair apparition that thus pertinaciously intruded upon\r\nhim, the young lawyer dressed himself. It was late, and to atone for\r\nlost time, he resolved to remain at home, and study hard the whole day.\r\nBut somehow or other, exactly at the same hour as on the previous one,\r\nhe found himself in the Calle Alcala; and scarcely was he there, when\r\nthe brown carriage and the splendid horses came rattling by. And there,\r\nupon the purple cushions, sat, more beautiful than ever, the divinity\r\nwho for the last twenty-four hours had monopolised so large a share of\r\nthe love-sick student's thoughts. He gazed at her with rapture, and\r\ninvoluntarily bowed his head, as to a being not of the earth. She\r\nsmiled: her look had something inquiring and mysterious; then, as if by\r\naccident, she placed her hand upon the edge of the carriage, and let a\r\nflower fall. Almost before it reached the ground, Federico caught and\r\nconcealed it in his bosom, as though it had been some precious jewel\r\nwhich all would seek to tear from him. It was an almond blossom, a\r\nsymbol of love and hope. Like a criminal, he hurried away, lest his\r\nprize should be reclaimed, when he suddenly found himself face to face\r\nwith Geronimo, who gravely took off his hat and greeted his friend.\r\n\r\n\"How goes it?\" said the old Don, his widowed eye twinkling significantly\r\nas he spoke. \"How have you slept? Did the lady visit you or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw her!\" cried Federico imploringly. \"For heaven's sake, her\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" replied Geronimo; \"I saw nothing. But if it be she who sits in\r\nyonder carriage, beware, young man! 'Tis dangerous jesting with giants,\r\nwho can crush us like straws beneath their finger. Your life is in\r\ndanger,\" he continued in a whisper; \"forget this folly. There are plenty\r\nof handsome faces in the world. Throw away the silly flower that peeps\r\nfrom your vest, and be off to Ciudad Real, where scores of pretty girls\r\nawait you.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to depart; Federico detained him.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go,\" said Geronimo: \"I am in haste. I will call upon you\r\npresently, and you shall hear more.\"\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding his promise, and although Federico remained all day\r\nat home, impatiently expecting him, Geronimo came not. Never had the\r\nstudent been so out of temper. He bitterly reproached himself as a\r\ndreamer, a fool, an idiot; and yet there he remained, his thoughts fixed\r\nupon one object, his eyes riveted on the almond blossom, which he had\r\nplaced in water, and whose delicate cup, now fully open, emitted a\r\ndelightful perfume. And as he gazed, fancy played her wildest pranks\r\nwith the enamoured youth. Small fairy-like creatures glided and danced\r\nbetween the dusty stamina of the graceful flower. At times, its leaves\r\nseemed partly to close, and from out the contracted aperture, the lady\r\nof his thoughts smiled sweetly upon him. Then the welcome vision\r\nvanished, and was succeeded by stern frowning faces of men, armed from\r\nhead to heel, who levelled daggers at his heart.\r\n\r\n\"By St Jago!\" the bewildered student at last exclaimed, \"this is too\r\nmuch. When will it end? What ails me? Have I so long withstood the\r\nfascinations of the black-eyed traitresses, to be thus at last entrapped\r\nand unmanned? Geronimo was right; at daybreak, I start for Ciudad Real.\r\nI will think no more of that perilous syren.\" He plucked the almond\r\nblossom from its vase. \"And this flower,\" he pensively murmured, \"has\r\ntouched her hand, perhaps her lips! Oh! were it possible that she loves\r\nme!\" As he spoke, he pressed the flower so impetuously to his mouth,\r\nthat its tender leaves were crushed and tarnished. He laughed\r\nscornfully. \"Thus is it,\" he exclaimed, \"with woman's love; as fair and\r\nas fragile as this poor blossom. Begone, then! Wither, and become dust,\r\nthou perishable emblem of frailty!\" Approaching the open window, he was\r\nabout to throw away the flower, when something flew into the room,\r\nstruck his breast, and rolled upon the ground. Federico started back,\r\nand his eye fell upon the clock that regulated his studies. The hands\r\nwere on the stroke of midnight, and for a moment, in his then excited\r\nstate, a feeling of superstitious fear stole over him. The next instant\r\nhe was again at the window, straining his eyes through the gloom. He\r\ncould see nothing. The night was dark: a few large stars twinkled in the\r\nsable canopy, the jasmin bushes in his balcony rustled in the breeze,\r\nand brushed their cool leaves against his heated temples. \"Who is\r\nthere?\" he cried. His question was unanswered. Closing the _jalousies_,\r\nhe took a light and sought about the room till he perceived something\r\nwhite under a table. It was a paper wrapped round a small roll of wood,\r\nand secured by a silken thread. Trembling with eagerness, he detached\r\nthe scroll. Upon it were traced a few lines in a woman's delicate\r\nhandwriting. \"If you are willing,\" so ran the missive, \"to encounter\r\nsome risk for an interview with her who writes this, you will repair,\r\nto-morrow evening at nine o'clock, to the western door of the church of\r\nSt James. One will meet you there in whom you may confide, if he asks\r\nyou what flower you love best.\"\r\n\r\n\"And though death were in the path,\" exclaimed Federico, with vehement\r\npassion--\"though a thousand swords opposed me, and King Ferdinand\r\nhimself--\" He paused at that name, with the habitual caution of a\r\nManchegan. \"I will go,\" he resumed, in a calmer but equally decided\r\ntone, \"I will go; and though certain to be stabbed at her feet, I still\r\nwould go.\"\r\n\r\nLazily, to the impetuous student's thinking, did the long hours loiter\r\ntill that of his rendezvous arrived. Tormented by a thousand doubts and\r\nanxieties, not the least of these arose from the probability that the\r\nassignation came not whence he hoped, and was, perhaps, the work of some\r\nmischievous jester, to send him on a fool's errand to the distant church\r\nof St James. Above all things, he wished to see his friend Geronimo; but\r\nalthough he passed the day in invoking his presence, and heaping curses\r\non his head, that personage did not appear. Evening came; the sun went\r\ndown behind the gardens of Buen Retiro; at last it was quite dark.\r\nFederico wrapped himself in his cloak, pressed his hat over his brows,\r\nconcealed in the breast of his coat one of those forbidden knives whose\r\nshort strong triangular blade is so terrible a weapon in a Spaniard's\r\nhand, and crossing the Plaza Mayor, glided swiftly through streets and\r\nlanes, until, exactly as the clock of St James's church struck nine, he\r\nstood beneath the massive arches of the western portico. All was still\r\nas the grave. The dark enclosure of a convent arose at a short distance,\r\nand from a small high window a solitary ray of light fell upon the\r\npainted figure of the Virgin that stood in its grated niche on the\r\nchurch wall.\r\n\r\nHis back against the stone parapet, in the darkest corner of the\r\nportico, Federico posted himself, silent and motionless. He had not long\r\nwaited, when he heard the sound of footsteps upon the rough pavement.\r\nThey came nearer; a shadow crossed the front of the arched gateway and\r\nwas merged in the gloom, as its owner, muttering indistinctly to\r\nhimself, entered the portico. It was a man, closely muffled in a dark\r\ncloak. To judge from his high and pointed hat, he belonged to the lower\r\nclass of the people; a wild black beard, a moment visible in the light\r\nfrom the convent window, was all of his physiognomy discernible by the\r\nstudent. He might be any thing; a Gallego, a muleteer, or a robber.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Federico made a slight noise, and advanced a step from\r\nhis corner. \"Who is there?\" cried the stranger. \"Who is there?\" he said.\r\n\"Answer, in God's name. What do you here at this hour of the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who questions me?\" boldly demanded the young man. And at the same time\r\nhe approached the speaker.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two men gazed suspiciously at each other; then the\r\nstranger again spoke. \"Night and solitude enjoin prudence, senor,\" said\r\nhe; \"and so, keep your distance. What brings you to this gloomy church\r\ndoor? At this hour such gay cavaliers are oftener found in the Prado or\r\nthe Delicias, plucking flowers for their mistresses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love flowers,\" replied Federico, \"but I also love solitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what flower, my gallant young gentleman, do you best love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough!\" joyfully exclaimed the student. \"'Tis you I seek: I am\r\nready to follow.\"\r\n\r\nWithout reply, the stranger produced a long black cloth.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" said Federico, who vigilantly observed his movements.\r\n\r\n\"To blindfold you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senor, that you may not see whither I conduct you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so!\" cried the student suspiciously. \"I will follow, but with open\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gallego threw the skirt of his large cloak over his left shoulder,\r\ntouched his pointed hat by way of salutation, and said courteously,\r\n\"_Buenas noches, senor._ May you sleep well, and live a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Federico; \"you are mad. Whither away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without you, senor. The truth is, you are wanted blind, or not at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of the colloquy that ensued was, that the Gallego twisted his\r\ncloth thrice round the student's eyes, ears, and nose, and led him\r\ncarefully across the Plaza, down a street and round sundry corners and\r\nturnings, till at last he deposited him in a carriage, which instantly\r\nset off at a rapid pace. After a tolerably long drive, by no means a\r\npleasant one for our adventurer, whose guide held his hands firmly in\r\nhis--probably to prevent his removing the bandage--the coach stopped,\r\nthe two men got out, and Federico was again conducted for some distance\r\non foot. He knew that he was still in Madrid, for he walked over\r\npavement, and in spite of the thick cloth that impeded his hearing, he\r\ncould distinguish the distant sound of carriages and hum of life.\r\nPresently a door creaked, and he apparently entered a garden, for there\r\nwas a smell of flowers and a rustling of leaves; then he ascended a\r\nstaircase, and was conducted through cool lofty apartments, and through\r\ndoors which seemed to open and shut of themselves. Suddenly his\r\ncompanion let go his hand. Federico stood for a minute in silent\r\nexpectation, then, groping around him with extended arms, he said in a\r\nlow voice--\"Am I at my journey's end? Answer!\" But nobody replied.\r\n\r\nBy one decided pull, the student tore the bandage from his eyes and\r\ngazed around him in wonder and bewilderment. He was alone in a spacious\r\nand magnificent apartment, whose walls were tapestried with striped blue\r\nand white satin, and whose carved ceiling was richly gilt and decorated.\r\nThe tall Venetian mirrors, the costly furniture, the beautifully fine\r\nIndian matting, every thing in the room, in short, convinced him that he\r\nwas in the favoured abode of wealth, and rank, and luxury. A lamp,\r\nsuspended by silver chains, shed a soft light over the apartment.\r\nFederico's position was a doubtful, probably a dangerous one; but love\r\nemboldened him, and he felt the truth of a saying of Geronimo's, that\r\ncourage grows with peril. Happen what might, there he was, and he knew\r\nno fear. The only perceptible exit from the room was by the large,\r\nfolding-doors through which he had entered. He tried them--they were\r\nfastened. His mother-wit suggested to him that his retreat had perhaps\r\nbeen thus cut off, that he might seek another outlet. He did so, and\r\npresently perceived hinges under the tapestry. A silver handle protruded\r\nfrom the wall; he grasped it, a door opened, and a cry of astonishment\r\nand delight burst from the student. Beaming with loveliness, a blush\r\nupon her cheek, a soft smile upon her rosy lips, the lady of his\r\nthoughts stood before him.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the pair gazed at each other in silence, their looks\r\ntelling more eloquently than any words, the love that filled their\r\nhearts. But soon Federico started from his brief trance, threw himself\r\nat the feet of the incognita, and, seizing her hand, pressed it ardently\r\nto his lips, murmuring the while, in low and passionate accents, such\r\nbroken and rapturous sentences as only lovers speak and love alone can\r\ncomprehend. The lady stood over him, her graceful form slightly bowed,\r\nher large lustrous eyes alternately fixed upon the kneeling youth and\r\nroving anxiously round the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Don Federico,\" she said, in tones whose sweetness thrilled his blood,\r\n\"may the Holy Virgin forgive my unmaidenly boldness. I have yielded to\r\nan impulse stronger than my reason, to the desire of seeing you, of\r\nhearing--\"\r\n\r\n\"That I love you,\" interrupted Federico--\"that I adore you since the\r\nfirst hour I beheld you,--that I will die at your feet if you refuse me\r\nhope!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent forward, and laid her small rosy hand upon his throbbing\r\nforehead. The touch was electric, the fiery glow of passion flashed in\r\nher glance. \"Light of my eyes!\" she whispered, \"it were vain to deny\r\nthat my heart is thine. But our love is a flower on the precipice's\r\nbrink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear not the fall,\" Federico impetuously exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Dare you risk every thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"For your love, every thing!\" was the enthusiastic reply.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, then, to the difficulties that beset us, and say if they are\r\nsurmountable.\"\r\n\r\nThe maiden paused, started, grew pale.\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" she exclaimed--\"what is that? He comes! Be still! be silent!\"\r\nWith wild and terrified haste, she seized Federico's hand, dragged him\r\nacross the room, and opened a door. The student felt a burning kiss upon\r\nhis lips, and before he knew where he was, the door was shut, and he was\r\nin total darkness. All that had happened since he entered the house had\r\noccurred so rapidly, was so mysterious and startling, that he was\r\nutterly bewildered. For a moment he thought himself betrayed, groped\r\nround his prison, which was a narrow closet, found the door, and,\r\ngrasping his stiletto, was about to force his way through all\r\nopposition, when he suddenly heard heavy steps on the other side of the\r\ntapestried screen. Motionless, he listened.\r\n\r\n\"Bring lights!\" said a deep commanding voice; \"the lamp burns dim as in\r\na bridal chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"It anticipates its office,\" replied another male voice, with a laugh.\r\n\"Is not your wedding-day fixed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; in the course of next week, perhaps,\" answered the first\r\nspeaker, striding up and down the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"You are in small haste,\" returned his companion, \"to enjoy what all\r\nenvy you. Never did I behold beauty more divine and captivating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful she certainly is,\" was the reply; \"but what is woman's\r\nbeauty? The vision of a day; snow, sullied and dispelled in a night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are in exceeding good humour,\" said the friend of this morose and\r\nmoralising bridegroom.\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, during which Federico's heart beat so strongly that he\r\nthought its throbbings must surely be audible through the slight barrier\r\nseparating him from the speakers. A servant brought lights, and a\r\nslender bright ray shot through a small opening in the tapestry,\r\npreviously unobserved by the student. Applying his eye to the crevice,\r\nhe obtained a view of the apartment, and of the persons whose\r\nconversation he had overheard. One of these wore a uniform glittering\r\nwith embroidery; the other was dressed in black, with several stars and\r\norders on his breast. Both were in the middle period of life: the one in\r\nuniform was the youngest and most agreeable looking; the dark features\r\nof the other were of a sombre and unpleasing cast.\r\n\r\nThe servant left the room, and the man in black suspended his walk and\r\npaused opposite his friend.\r\n\r\n\"You had something to communicate?\" he said, in a suppressed voice.\r\n\r\n\"Are we secure from listeners?\" asked the officer, in French.\r\n\r\n\"Entirely; and doubly so if we speak French. Rosaura herself, did she\r\noverhear us, would be none the wiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the soldier, \"I sincerely wish you joy of this marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks! But with equal sincerity I tell you that I am\r\nheartily weary of such congratulations. In marrying, one gives and\r\ntakes. I give Rosaura my name and rank, titles and dignities, honours\r\nand privileges.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you take your lovely ward and a rich estate. A fair exchange,\r\nExcellency. I can only say that the world wonders at the delay of so\r\nsuitable a union, and even inclines to the belief that a certain\r\ndisinclination----\"\r\n\r\n\"The world is greatly mistaken,\" interrupted the Count. \"I ardently love\r\nRosaura, and I have his Majesty's consent to the marriage. But what a\r\nfool men take me for, if they suppose----\" he stopped short, and tossed\r\nhis head with a scornful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said the officer.\r\n\r\n\"Solve the riddle yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand! Your position is uneasy, the future dark, the decisive\r\nmoment at hand. With one's feet on a volcano, one is little disposed to\r\nenjoy a honeymoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when the mine explodes, and one is tossed into the air, it is\r\npleasant to fall in the soft lap of love, there to forget one's wounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! But what if the lap refuse to receive the luckless engineer?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Amigo!_\" replied the Count--\"I thought you knew me better. Under all\r\ncircumstances, Rosaura remains mine. For myself, I have trained and\r\nnurtured this fair and delicate plant, and to me, as the gardener, it\r\nbelongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"She loves you, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Loves me? What a question! Of course she does. She has grown up with\r\nthe idea that she is to be my wife. Her heart is pure and unblemished as\r\na diamond: it shall be my care to keep it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fear rivals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear!\" repeated the Count, a smile flitting over his dark countenance.\r\n\"But we trifle precious time. What have you to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something important to our cause,\" replied the officer, drawing nearer\r\nto his companion. \"But first, how goes it yonder?\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed with his finger in the direction of the closet. Federico\r\ninstinctively started back, but again applied his eye to the loophole on\r\nhearing the Count's answer. \"I have just come thence,\" he said, \"and\r\nmust soon return. The hand of death is upon him--in vain would he parry\r\nthe blow. Still the struggle is a hard one; he persists in discrediting\r\nhis danger, and will abandon none of his habits. But the remorseless\r\ntyrant is there, soon to claim him for his own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must take our measures without delay,\" said the officer.\r\n\r\n\"They are already taken,\" was his companion's quiet answer.\r\n\r\n\"Your colleagues are agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fully agreed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Read that,\" said the Count, taking a large folded paper from a\r\nportfolio, and spreading it before his friend, who devoured its contents\r\nwith every demonstration of extreme surprise.\r\n\r\n\"His handwriting! his signature!\" he cried. \"A revocation, annihilating\r\nthe shameless intrigues and machinations of years! Now, Heaven be\r\npraised, our country and religion--the faith, honour, and dignity of\r\nSpain are rescued! How was it obtained? How possible? My noble friend,\r\nyou are indeed a great statesman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this priceless document,\" calmly replied the Count; \"convey it to\r\nyour master. Only in his hands is it entirely safe. The future welfare\r\nof Spain, the salvation of us all, is suspended to its seal. That I\r\nobtained it,\" he continued, his voice sinking to a whisper, \"is the work\r\nof Providence. During the last two days, he has had spasms and fainting\r\nfits that have weakened his mind and energies. The secret is well kept,\r\nand without the palace gates nought is known of these dangerous\r\nsymptoms. In such moments of agony and depression, the weary soul\r\nrecalls the past, and trembles for the future. Then, in vivid colours, I\r\nplaced before him the confusion and unhappiness, and infernal mischief,\r\nto which his deplorable decision must give rise; I urged the injustice\r\nhe had committed, the sin that would lie at his door; and showed how,\r\nalmost before his eyes had closed, the work he had achieved at peril to\r\nhis soul, would sink and crumble in an ocean of blood and tears. Alcudia\r\nsupported me; the others chimed in; this document was ready, and--he\r\nsigned.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now we have got it,\" cried the officer triumphantly, \"we will hold\r\nit fast with hands and teeth. How long, think you, may he still live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Castillo says not more than two days, and that he will hardly regain\r\nthe full use of his intellects.\" The eyes of the conspirators met; for a\r\nmoment they gazed at each other, and then broke into a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the officer, \"I came commissioned to assure you special\r\nfavour and high reward, but, by my honour as a soldier, no gain or\r\nrecompense can worthily requite such service as yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"For me little can be done,\" replied the Count. \"My desires tend to the\r\npeaceful existence in the arms of my young wife, far removed from cares\r\nof state. Such is the reward I promise myself. Let your acts be speedy\r\nand decided, for it might well happen that--\" his brow contracted into\r\ndeeper folds, and his voice assumed a discordant harshness--\"I have\r\ndecimated the ranks of the scoundrels, but enough yet remain to give\r\nmuch trouble. Take sure measures, and muster your resources. You will\r\nneed them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not,\" replied the confident soldier. \"We, too, have been active,\r\nand have good and steady friends. At a word, the Realista volunteers and\r\nthe trusty Agraviados fly to their arms. Romagosa, Caraval, Erro,\r\nGonzalez, and the venerable Cyrillo, still live. The Guards are for us.\r\nSo are the civil authorities and captains-general of eleven provinces.\r\nLet the moment come, and you will see that, with this document in our\r\nhand, all is done. Confidence for confidence,\" he continued. \"Read this\r\nlist of names. It contains those of our most approved friends, and will\r\nreassure you as to the chances of the future.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed a paper to the Count, who, barely looking at it, said\r\nthoughtfully--\r\n\r\n\"Leave it with me till to-morrow. At the critical moment, it will be of\r\nimmense weight with many waverers. 'Tis late; in a few minutes I must go\r\nout. Place me at the feet of your gracious master, and tell him he will\r\nhave no more faithful subject than his humble slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you see him?\" said the officer gently. His companion shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"'Twere not wise,\" he replied. \"The time is not yet come. When it\r\narrives, I shall be the first to bend knee before him. Be watchful,\r\nprudent, and prompt. Yet one word. You have confided somewhat in that\r\nfellow Regato. Trust him not too far. I deem him a traitor. Let him be\r\nproved such, and he shall not escape the rope he has long deserved. And\r\nnow, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men parted, and, as the Count returned from the door, Federico\r\nheard a rustling of silks that materially increased the rapidity of his\r\nheart's pulsations.\r\n\r\n\"My fair bride!\" gallantly exclaimed his Excellency, \"I am enchanted to\r\nsee you. How lovely you look, Rosaura! and how deeply I regret that\r\nimportant affairs leave me but a few moments to devote to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would seem,\" said the lady, with cold severity, \"that your\r\nExcellency has converted my poor apartment into an audience chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand pardons, dear Rosaura,\" was the reply. \"A particular friend\r\ncraved a short interview.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is late,\" said the lady pointedly. \"I wish your Excellency a good\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried the Count impatiently. \"You dismiss me thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am indisposed to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a cruel tyrant, Rosaura.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, Excellency? They say worse things of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, and what?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter. May your Excellency live a thousand years!\"\r\n\r\n\"With you, Rosaura,\" replied the Count, assuming an air of tenderness\r\nwhich, as Federico thought, sat supremely ill upon him, and endeavouring\r\nto take her hand. She drew it quickly back.\r\n\r\n\"_Veremos, Excelencia._ We shall see.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil take the Excellency!\" cried the Count, losing all\r\nself-command, and stamping angrily with his foot. Rosaura curtsied low.\r\n\r\n\"You forget my rights over you, Rosaura. I came to tell you that in a\r\nfew days, as I hope, my dearest wishes will be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see, Excellency,\" repeated the provoking beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Count stepped up to her, and said, with his sullen smile, \"You\r\nrejoice not at it, Rosaura?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was her laconic, reply.\r\n\r\n\"You love me not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Love _you_, Excellency? a great statesman like you! Certainly not,\r\nExcellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"I grieve to hear it, my beautiful bride; but, fortunately, love often\r\ncomes with marriage. You shall learn to love me, Rosaura. Our existence\r\nshall be a happy and envied one. You detest state affairs: I will leave\r\nthem and devote myself solely to you. Far from the capital, we will lead\r\na pastoral life, amidst myrtles and meadows, flocks and shepherds, in\r\nall the sweet tranquillity of a terrestrial paradise.\"\r\n\r\nWhether sketched in jest or in earnest, this picture of rustic felicity\r\nhad evidently few charms for Rosaura, at least in the companionship\r\nproposed. Suddenly she stepped up to the Count, took his hand, looked\r\nfull into his dark serious countenance, and laughed aloud and most\r\nmusically.\r\n\r\n\"What do I hear, Excellency?\" she exclaimed; \"_you_ in myrtle groves and\r\nsmiling meadows--_you_ leading a shepherd's tranquil life! Oh, ye\r\nSaints! _he_ a shepherd in the Alpuxarras. Ah! the flocks would fly and\r\nscatter themselves, when they beheld the gloomy lines upon your brow.\r\nWhere are sheep to be found who would be tended by that ensanguined\r\nhand? Where could _you_ find repose? Is there a place free from the\r\nechoes of the curses that martyred Liberals have heaped upon you? Where\r\nis the domestic hearth around which would not range themselves the\r\nspectres of the wretches who, at your command, have been blotted from\r\nthe book of life. Count, I shudder at the thought! Holy Mother of God!\r\nis that the happy future you would compel me to share? No, no,\r\nnever!--though the garrote were to encircle my neck, as it did that of\r\nthe unhappy lady at Granada, who refused to betray her husband, and whom\r\nyou sent to the scaffold in his stead! Has she never appeared to your\r\nExcellency, cold and pale, and with sightless eyes? For Quito's\r\ntreasures would I not behold her--her and the whole ghastly train;\r\nhundreds, ay hundreds of them, in the long, black-bordered shrouds, and\r\nthe barefooted friars with their fearful _misericordia_! Mercy, mercy,\r\nExcellency! with me would come the evil spirits, and a thousand----but,\r\ngood-night, good-night, Excellency.\"\r\n\r\nWith a graceful movement of hand and head she glided from the room. The\r\nCount attempted not to detain her. He stood motionless, his hand thrust\r\ninto his breast, and followed her with his eyes in mute astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"The silly child!\" he at last murmured. \"But how lovely she is! I, whom\r\nall fear--even HE,\" he emphatically added--\"I almost quail before her\r\nmad petulance. Well, well!\" he continued after a pause, \"the priest\r\nfirst, and discipline afterwards. A man who has bowed and broken so many\r\nstubborn spirits, will hardly be vanquished by the humours of a wilful\r\ngirl. Good-night, my lovely bride. 'We shall see,' you said; and\r\nassuredly we _will_ see.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his hat, and was about to leave the room, when, by an\r\ninadvertent movement, Federico let fall his poniard. The Count was quick\r\nof hearing, and the noise, slight as it was, drew his attention. He\r\nturned sharply towards the spot where the student was concealed.\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" he cried. \"Something fell in the closet. Have we\r\nlisteners here?\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant he hesitated; then, taking one of the massive silver\r\ncandlesticks, he stepped briskly to the closet, and was almost knocked\r\ndown by the door, which Federico pushed violently open. The waxlights\r\nfell to the ground; like a winged shadow, the student sprang past the\r\nastonished Count, reached the door before the latter recovered from his\r\nalarm, and would doubtless have got clear off, had he not, in hurry and\r\nignorance, turned the wrong handle. The Count grasped his coat-skirt,\r\nand pulled him back.\r\n\r\n\"Scoundrel!\" he cried. \"What do you here?\"\r\n\r\nFor sole reply, Federico seized his assailant by the throat, and a\r\nstruggle began, which, although speedily decided in favour of the active\r\nstudent, was destined to have most important results. The Count was\r\nvigorous, and defended himself well. He had little opportunity of\r\ncalling out, closely grappled as he was, but he dealt his antagonist\r\nmore than one heavy blow. At last Federico dashed him to the ground, and\r\ndisappeared from the room, leaving behind him one of his coat-skirts,\r\ntorn off in the contest. In falling, the Count's head struck against a\r\ntable, and he lay for a few seconds stunned by the shock. Recovering\r\nhimself, he sprang to his feet, foaming with rage, his dark visage black\r\nwith shame and anger. \"Seize him!\" he cried, hurrying down the corridor.\r\nTwenty servants flew to obey the order. But it was too late. The student\r\npassed like a fire-flash before the porter, and made good his escape\r\nfrom the house. \"Follow him!\" shouted the Count--\"a hundred ounces for\r\nhis captor!\" And, stimulated by this princely reward, the eager\r\ndomestics ran, like hounds after a deer, on the track of the student,\r\nwho soon heard the shouts of his enemies, and the shrill whistle of the\r\n_serenos_, around and on all sides of him.\r\n\r\nAlthough panting from his brief but violent struggle with the Count,\r\nFederico traversed with extreme swiftness several streets and squares,\r\nuntil want of breath at last compelled him to a moment's pause. He\r\nlooked around, and observed the locality. Before him lay the massive\r\nbuildings of the royal palace, favoured by whose shadow he continued his\r\nflight, now up-hill. But the numbers of his pursuers, their intimate\r\nknowledge of the ground, and of the short cuts and by-lanes, gave them a\r\ngreat advantage; and, to his dismay, he found himself so closely and\r\naccurately followed, that capture appeared inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Had I but my knife,\" he exclaimed aloud, pausing in despair, \"I would\r\nkeep them off or die! Fool that I have been! Sentries on all sides! They\r\nhave taken alarm! What can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to Ciudad Real, if not too late,\" said a man, wrapped in a cloak,\r\nand wearing a small three-cornered hat, who suddenly stepped from behind\r\na massive stone column, close to where the student stood.\r\n\r\nFederico at once recognised the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Geronimo!\" he cried, \"assist me in this strait. If they\r\ncatch me, I am lost. And hark! yonder they come! I hear the baying of\r\nthe menial pack. On all sides the way is barred!\"\r\n\r\nGeronimo seized Federico's hand, and hurried him behind the pillar.\r\n\"There is only one chance,\" he said, \"muffle yourself in my cloak, take\r\nmy hat, assume a stoop, and walk slowly, like an old man.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your plan?\" cried the student.\r\n\r\n\"Ask no questions. Do as I bid you. Do you see yonder door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Into the palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. Look neither right nor left; cross the first court to the\r\ngreat portal. There await me. Quick, quick--here they come!\" And he\r\npushed him away.\r\n\r\nNot without doubt and disquietude did Federico obey the orders of the\r\nold man, who displayed, in this conjuncture, a promptitude and decision\r\nrare at his age. But the student had no alternative. Wrapped in Regato's\r\ncloak, and feigning a feeble gait, he passed slowly and unquestioned\r\nbefore the soldiers of the royal guard. This impunity in a palace where\r\nthe strictest watch and ward were usually kept, was an enigma to\r\nFederico; and he was still more puzzled, when, whilst waiting at the\r\nportal, several persons, shrouded like himself in dark cloaks, passed\r\nbefore him, greeting him as they went with a muttered \"_buenas noches_,\"\r\nand disappeared in the corridors of the palace. At last came Geronimo.\r\nHe had provided himself in the interval with another cloak. His\r\nappearance was an immense relief to the student.\r\n\r\n\"Are they gone?\" said Federico. \"May I venture out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank the saints that you are here!\" replied Geronimo. \"And now, tell\r\nme what has happened.\"\r\n\r\nFederico told his adventures; and old Regato listened to the narrative\r\nwith marks of the strongest interest. Now he nodded his head, then beat\r\nthe ground with his heel, or threw back his cloak and gesticulated with\r\nhis arms. When he heard what the Count had said of him and of his\r\nprobable fate, he laughed heartily. \"Bah!\" said he; \"threatened men live\r\nlong. I have had hotter broth cooked for me, and cooled it with my\r\nbreath. I hope to die in my bed, like a good Christian; and as for my\r\nchance of a rope, I would not change with his Excellency. The infernal\r\nschemer! I'll pay him off now. _Madre de todas gracias!_ had we but the\r\nlist of the conspirators, what a blow might be struck!\"\r\n\r\n\"The list!\" repeated Federico. \"Stay, let me remember!\" and, plunging\r\nhis hand into his pocket, he pulled out a torn paper. \"When I threw the\r\nman down, this remained sticking between my waistcoat and neckcloth,\r\nwhere he had grappled me. I noticed it when I got outside, and thrust it\r\ninto my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nWithout listening to this explanation, Geronimo seized the paper, and,\r\nby the light of a lamp under the portal, examined it with eager\r\ncuriosity. At sight of its contents, a savage joy sparkled in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, _maldito!_\" he exclaimed with a laugh of triumph; \"we have you now.\r\nFederico, the rose-coloured lady is ten times more surely yours, than if\r\nyou had remained in the closet and his Excellency had not discovered\r\nyou. Follow, and be silent. Whatever happens, not a word till I bid you;\r\nthen speak boldly, and tell what you know.\"\r\n\r\nThrough winding corridors, up and down stairs, along galleries where\r\nsentries stood like statues, Geronimo led the way, until he reached a\r\nroom whose door was opened by a gigantic lackey in the gaudy royal\r\nlivery. Federico, who followed close upon his heels, suddenly found\r\nhimself in the presence of a number of men, for the most part elderly\r\nand of grave respectable aspect, who stood in small knots about the\r\napartment, or sat at tables on which were wine and refreshments,\r\nconversing in a low tone. Amongst these a hum of interest arose on\r\nRegato's entrance; and under cover of the attention he attracted, his\r\ncompanion passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIt at once flashed upon Federico, that he had penetrated into that\r\nnotorious Camarilla or secret council of King Ferdinand VII., so much\r\nspoken of, so often cursed and scoffed at, so greatly feared, and justly\r\nhated. This was the cringing and pernicious conclave, of whose vile\r\nproceedings so many tales were told; these were the men, of all ranks\r\nand classes, who poured into the jealous despot's ear the venom of\r\ncalumny and falsehood; these the spies and traitors who, by secret and\r\ninsidious denunciations, brought sudden arrest and unmerited punishment\r\nupon their innocent fellow-citizens, and who kept the King advised of\r\nall that passed in Madrid, from the amorous intrigues of a grocer's\r\nwife, to the political ones concerted in the cabinet of the Infante Don\r\nCarlos.\r\n\r\nThe student's first uneasiness at finding himself upon such new and\r\nperilous ground, vanished when he saw that he was wholly unheeded. He\r\nremembered to have heard that persons once admitted to the camarilla,\r\nand honoured by the King's confidence, were at liberty to return when\r\nthey thought fit, at short or long intervals; and thus it might well\r\nhappen that some of the members were unknown to each other. And on that\r\nnight, these illicit counsellors of majesty were evidently preoccupied\r\nwith some pressing and important matter. They crowded round Regato, took\r\nhis arm, seized him by the button, whispered so eagerly, and questioned\r\nhim so fast, that the little man lost all patience.\r\n\r\n\"Hands off, gentlemen!\" he cried. \"Which of you will buy me a new coat\r\nwhen you have torn mine? 'Tis true that this morning our gracious lord\r\nthe King was very ill: but I hear that he is now better; and by the\r\ngrace of our blessed Lady, he will rejoice his humble and loving slaves,\r\nand dispel their deep anxiety, by the sunshine of his presence.\"\r\n\r\nThe words had scarce left Geronimo's lips, when the opening of a\r\nside-door proved the signal for a respectful silence in the apartment.\r\nThe whole assembly bowed profoundly, and preserved that posture,\r\nalthough no cause was yet apparent for such extraordinary greeting. At\r\nlast one showed itself, in the person of a man who tottered slowly and\r\nfeebly into the room, supported on the arms of two attendants, his livid\r\nand bloated countenance distorted by a smile as painful to behold as if\r\ncompelled by thumbscrews. The face of the new comer, who nodded in reply\r\nto the humble salutation of the camarilla, might once have been\r\nhandsome, but it could never have been intellectual or prepossessing,\r\nand now it was hideously cadaverous and ghastly. The features were those\r\ncharacterising a well-known family, world-renowned for the high places\r\nit has filled, rather than for the virtues or abilities of its members.\r\nThe eyes were sunk deep in their sockets, the straight, scanty black\r\nhair shaded a brow blue and transparent from disease; the tall person\r\nand once well-formed limbs were swollen and unwieldy. The sick man's\r\ndress would have suited some plain burgher of Madrid, taking his use in\r\nhis summer-house: it consisted of a light nankeen jacket, a white\r\nneckcloth knotted loosely round the throat, linen trousers, and large\r\nshoes. He seemed scarcely able to set foot to ground, and the agony each\r\nstep occasioned him betrayed itself in spasmodic twitchings of the\r\nnerves and muscles. Still there was a violent effort of the will to\r\nconceal the pangs that racked the enfeebled frame; a fruitless attempt,\r\nby the assumption of smiling case and gracious condescension, to hide,\r\neven from himself, the approach of that equalising hour when human\r\ngreatness and human misery sink to one level.\r\n\r\nThe sick man propped himself against a table, beside which stood an\r\neasy-chair, and with an affable wave of his hand, addressed the company.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, senores!\" he said: \"we have felt ourselves somewhat\r\nunwell, and our careful physician Castillo, as also our trusty Grijalva,\r\nwas solicitous on our account. But we would not put off this meeting. We\r\nlove to meet our good friends, and are not to be kept from them, by\r\nslight bodily inconvenience. Men fancy us more ailing than we are. You\r\ncan refute such reports. What say you, Mexas--and you, Salcedo? Is our\r\naspect so very sickly? We know that many build hopes upon our death; but\r\nthey are mistaken, and by Our Lady, they shall be disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"God preserve our gracious lord a thousand years!\" exclaimed several\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n\"An example should be made,\" said the man appealed to as Salcedo, \"of\r\nthe traitors who dare spread lying reports concerning the royal health.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis too true,\" observed another, \"that such rumours are used to the\r\nmost criminal ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will sit down,\" said the sick monarch. And with the assistance of\r\nhis attendants, he deposited his exhausted person in the elbow-chair.\r\n\"Drink, my friends, and tell me the news. Give me a cigar, good\r\nCastillo. Senor Regato, how goes it? what is new in our fair city of\r\nMadrid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little is heard,\" replied Geronimo, \"save lamentations for the\r\nindisposition of our beloved master.\"\r\n\r\n\"The good people!\" exclaimed Ferdinand. \"We will have care of their\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said a little old man with a countenance of repulsive\r\nugliness, \"there be reprobates who laugh whilst all true and faithful\r\nsubjects weep. There is my neighbour, the merchant Alvaro. Yesterday he\r\nmarried his daughter to a young nobleman, Don Francisco Palavar, who\r\nclaims relationship with the Marquis of Santa Cruz. The wedding-guests\r\nwere numerous; they sang and danced, and rejoiced beyond measure. Senor\r\nAlvaro, said I, are you not ashamed to be so joyous at such a time?\r\n'Friend,' was his answer, 'let the times wag--they are certainly bad\r\nenough, but must soon change. All things have an end. We rejoice in\r\nhopes of a better future.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The wretch!\" exclaimed another of the camarilla. \"I know him well; he\r\nwas always a _negro_.\"\r\n\r\n\"A knave grown gray in the sins of the Exaltados,\" cried a third.\r\n\r\n\"He must be looked to,\" said the sick King. \"Salcedo, what have you to\r\ntell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have gathered intelligence,\" replied Salcedo, \"from an equerry of a\r\ncertain illustrious personage.\" He paused, and looked meaningly at the\r\nKing, whose brow contracted, and whose lips muttered a well-known name.\r\n\"The equerry,\" Salcedo said, \"tattled of great bustle and many visits at\r\nhis master's palace. For days past its court-yard had been filled with\r\ncarriages, bringing generals, ministers, dignitaries of the church, and\r\nmany officers, chiefly of the Royal Guard.\" On hearing this, a feverish\r\nand uneasy flush reddened Ferdinand's pale countenance, and his dim eyes\r\nglared angrily.\r\n\r\n\"I know them,\" he said, \"the old conspirators, the Catalan volunteers,\r\nthe _agraviados_. Why have I not heard this sooner? But I will take\r\norder with them. Ha, Tadeo!--you there? Why has this been kept from me?\"\r\n\r\nUttering these last words, the King looked directly at the spot where\r\nFederico stood. So, at least, it seemed to the student, who, much\r\nconfused, and apprehensive of discovery, averted his eyes from the royal\r\ngaze. But his embarrassment was exchanged for consternation, when he\r\nbeheld, in the person addressed by Ferdinand as Tadeo, his recent\r\nantagonist, the affianced of Rosaura. The Count, who stood at his elbow,\r\ngave him but one look, but that one comprised every thing--astonishment,\r\nanger, hatred, confidence of power, and a fixed determination of\r\nrevenge. A chill came over the poor student, and he debated in his mind\r\nwhether to rush from the room, or to fall at the King's feet and reveal\r\nall he knew. His first surprise over, and seeing that Don Tadeo took no\r\nfurther notice of him, he thought it wisest to follow Geronimo's\r\ndirections and remain quiet.\r\n\r\n\"My gracious liege,\" said Tadeo to the King, with his usual gloomy\r\ndecision of manner, \"it was unnecessary to importune your majesty by\r\nsuch reports, seeing that they are merely lying devices of the\r\nevil-disposed. And even were it true that many visits are paid to that\r\npalace, its master has right and reason to receive them, without--\"\r\n\r\nBy an impatient gesture, the King interrupted the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"It needs but to name the visitors,\" said Regato, with a quick sharp\r\nglance at Tadeo. \"Eguia is one of them; San Juan, O'Donnel, Moreno,\r\nCaraval, are others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has it not been remarked,\" said Mexas, with a sarcastic smile, \"that in\r\nthe apartments of a certain illustrious lady, meetings are also held, to\r\nwhich repair the Dukes of San Lorenzo and Fernando, Martinez de la Rosa,\r\nCambronero, and many others? What can be said against that?\"\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed this bold remark: all knew well who the\r\nillustrious lady was who thus assembled round her the leaders of the\r\nLiberals. Suddenly the ominous pause was broken by the voice of\r\nFederico, to whom Regato had made a sign, significant although barely\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\n\"Don Tadeo,\" cried the audacious student, his mellow manly tones ringing\r\nthrough the apartment, \"is a traitor to his King. This very night he\r\ndelivered an all-important document to an agent of the Infante Don\r\nCarlos.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were an electric shock to the camarilla. The King started, and\r\nshowed symptoms of extraordinary agitation. \"What is that? Who says\r\nthat?\" he cried, rising from his chair with the vigour of sudden\r\nexcitement. \"Who knows of the document? where is it? Seize him--he shall\r\nexplain,--confess!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seize the scoundrel,\" cried Tadeo, \"who has dared intrude himself\r\nhither.\"\r\n\r\n\"My guards! my guards!\" cried the King, his eyes rolling wildly, his\r\nfeatures frightfully convulsed. \"Where is the paper? Tadeo, I _will_\r\nhave it back! Ha! what is this! mercy! blessed Virgin, mer----!\" The\r\nword was unfinished; and Ferdinand, doubly tortured by bodily pain and\r\nmental anguish, fell back into the arms of his physician.\r\n\r\n\"The King is dead!\" exclaimed Tadeo. \"Help here!\"\r\n\r\nThe camarilla crowded round Ferdinand, who lay without sense or motion.\r\n\"What is it, Senor Castillo?\" said Tadeo. The physician let fall his\r\npatient's wrist.\r\n\r\n\"A sudden paroxysm, your Excellency,\" he replied in a low voice. \"It was\r\nto be apprehended--all is over!\"\r\n\r\nThe Count turned away, and his eye fell upon Federico, who, seeing\r\nresistance useless, stood passive in the custody of several of the\r\ncamarilla. With a vindictive frown, Tadeo pulled open the student's\r\ncloak, and pointed to his skirtless coat.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot deny it,\" he said. \"The proof of your guilt is in my\r\npossession. Who is the fellow?\"\r\n\r\nGeronimo Regato stepped forward and stared in the student's face.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried he, \"is not that Don Federico, the young advocate, well\r\nknown in the coffee-houses as a virulent Exaltado, a determined scoffer,\r\na propagator of atrocious doctrines?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought as much,\" said the Count. \"None but such an unprincipled\r\nscoundrel would dare to act the spy in the very palace. Call the guard,\r\nand away with him to prison. Let this man be securely ironed,\" he added,\r\nto the soldiers who now entered; \"and let none have speech of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was promptly obeyed. A very brief space elapsed before\r\nFederico found himself in a narrow dungeon, stretched on damp straw,\r\nwith manacles on hands and feet. In total darkness, and seated\r\ndespondingly upon his comfortless couch, the events of the evening\r\nappeared to him like some frightful nightmare. But in vain did he rub\r\nhis eyes and try to awake from his imaginary sleep; the terrible reality\r\nforced itself upon him. He thought of Rosaura, the original cause of his\r\nmisfortunes, and almost doubted whether she were indeed a woman, or some\r\ndemon in angel's form, sent to lure him to destruction. Of Geronimo,\r\ntoo, he thought with feelings of inexpressible bitterness. He, the\r\nfriend in whom he had placed such implicit reliance, to betray him thus;\r\nfor his own advantage, doubtless, and to draw his own head out of the\r\nnoose! There were none, then, to whom he could now look for succour. The\r\nKing was dead; his successor, the apostolical ruler, the partisan and\r\ndefender of the Inquisition, whose name, for years past, had been the\r\nrallying-cry of the disaffected, owed his crown to the powerful Tadeo\r\nwhom the student had offended and ill treated, whose love he had dared\r\nto cross, whose revenge he must now encounter. Federico felt that his\r\nfate was sealed. Already he heard, in imagination, the clank of\r\nponderous fetters in the dismal halls of the Inquisition; already he saw\r\nthe terrible machines--the screws and weights, the ladder and iron\r\ncouch, and felt the burning sulphur, as it was dropped hissing upon his\r\nnaked flesh by the masked and pitiless executioner. He thought of\r\nArguelles, the Divine, whom he had seen an animated corpse, his limbs\r\ncrushed and distorted by similar tortures; and in spite of his natural\r\ncourage, a shudder came over him as he heard the bars of his dungeon\r\ndoor withdrawn, and the heavy bolts shot back into their sockets. The\r\nnext instant he closed his eyes, dazzled by a glare of light.\r\n\r\nWhen he re-opened them, the Count, or Tadeo, whichever was his most\r\nfitting appellation, stood before him. With the courage of pride and\r\ndespair, Federico boldly met his searching gaze. For some moments they\r\nlooked at each other in silence, broken at last by Tadeo.\r\n\r\n\"I come to question you,\" he said: \"answer truly, and your captivity may\r\nbe very brief. Deceive me, and your life shall be yet shorter. Your\r\ncrimes shall meet their just reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am guilty of no crime,\" retorted Federico. \"I am the victim of\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are they?\" eagerly inquired the Count.\r\n\r\nFederico was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know me, Senor?\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Beware, then, lest you learn to know me too well. What did you,\r\nconcealed in yonder closet? Where is the paper you robbed me of? Who\r\nadmitted you into the house? Do you belong to a secret society? Were you\r\nsent as a spy? A dagger was found in the closet: did you come to\r\nassassinate me?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused after each question, but Federico answered none of them, save\r\nthe last, to which he replied by a stern negative. \"You had best\r\nconfess,\" resumed Tadeo. \"If you are no political offender, if no\r\ncriminal project led you where I found you, I pledge my word, Senor--and\r\nI pledge it only to what I can and will perform--you shall at once be\r\nreleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can say but this,\" replied the prisoner; \"it was not my object to\r\noverhear you: an accident conducted me where you discovered me, and I\r\nheartily regret that a casual noise betrayed my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you will say?\"\r\n\r\n\"All.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know not with whom you deal,\" cried the Count. Then, lowering his\r\nvoice, and with a smile that he strove to render amiable. \"It was,\r\nperhaps, a love-affair,\" he said. \"Young man, which of Dona Rosaura's\r\nhandmaidens did you seek? Who introduced you into that apartment? Tell\r\nme this, satisfy me on a point that concerns myself personally, and not\r\nonly will I forget all, but remain your debtor.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst thus he spoke, the Count's features expressed very different\r\nsentiments from those announced by his smooth and placable speech. In\r\ntheir convulsive workings, and in the savage fire of his eyes, jealousy\r\nand hatred were plainly to be read; he looked like a tiger about to\r\nspring upon its prey.\r\n\r\n\"Senor,\" said Federico contemptuously, \"you waste time. If a lady did\r\nintroduce me into your house, rest assured I am not base enough to\r\nreveal her name. From me you get no further answer. Do with me as you\r\nwill. In this unhappy land, might is above right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed the Count, fiercely advancing upon his undaunted\r\ncaptive; \"you have betrayed yourself. I will destroy you, knave, like an\r\ninsect. A lady conceal you! What audacious slander is this?\" He\r\nstruggled with his rage, and, mastering himself, resumed. \"It has been\r\nproved that you are the spy of a dangerous and treasonable association.\r\nWhere is the paper you stole?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no paper,\" replied Federico, \"and will answer no more questions.\r\nI am in your power; do your worst.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count stepped to the dungeon door, and summoned two men in waiting\r\noutside. Whilst one of them searched Federico, closely examining each\r\npocket and fold of his dress, but without discovering the much-coveted\r\ndocument, the other listened respectfully to the Count, who gave him\r\ninstructions in a low voice. His last words, which reached the ear of\r\nthe student, were not calculated to reassure him as to the future. \"Be\r\nit so,\" said Don Tadeo. \"The necessary warrant shall at once be made\r\nout, and then--despatch.\" And with a vindictive glance at his prisoner,\r\nhe left the prison.\r\n\r\nIt was some consolation to the unfortunate Federico, when again in\r\ndismal solitude, and with the prospect of a cruel death before his eyes,\r\nto reflect on the firmness he had shown, and on the agony of jealous\r\ndoubt he had inflicted on his rival. In his defenceless and desperate\r\ncircumstances, such revenge was doubly sweet; and for a while he dwelt\r\non it with pleasure. Then his thoughts took other direction, and an\r\nactive and excited imagination transported him from that gloomy cell to\r\nthe chamber of the beautiful cause of his misfortunes. She knelt before\r\na crucifix, and wept and prayed for him. He heard her breathe his name,\r\nand invoke the saints to his assistance; and in a transport of love and\r\ngratitude he extended his arms to clasp her to his heart. They were\r\nrudely checked by the chain that linked them to the wall. And now pale\r\nspectres flitted through the gloom, and grinned at him with their\r\nskeleton mouths, and murmured in his ear that he must die, and never\r\nagain see her whose kiss was yet hot upon his lips. And the last ominous\r\nwords and deadly look of his foe recurred to him, chasing all hope. Who\r\nwould miss him, the humble and friendless student; who inquire where or\r\nhow he had met his fate? Far greater than he, the wealthy, the titled,\r\nthe powerful, had met the fate he anticipated, at hangman's hands, in\r\nthe dark and silent recesses of Spanish dungeons. To the long list of\r\nillustrious victims, he, an insignificant one, would be added unnoticed.\r\nAnd the remembrance of those who had preceded him, ennobling an\r\nignominious death, gave Federico courage. \"Yes!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"I\r\nwill die, as so many great and good men have died before me! Would that\r\nI had done service to my poor oppressed country, something to deserve\r\nthe tyrant's hate! But for thee, Rosaura, will I gladly perish, and to\r\nthee only shall my last sigh be given.\"\r\n\r\nHis words yet echoed in the dungeon, when he heard steps at the door,\r\nand its fastenings again withdrawn. This time, he doubted not it was his\r\ndeath-warrant and the executioner. Nerving himself to endure the worst,\r\nhe gazed sternly and steadily at his visitors.\r\n\r\n\"That is he,\" said the turnkey, to a tall, sullen-looking man.\r\n\r\n\"Take off his chains,\" was the answer; \"and you, senor, follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick with your work,\" cried Federico. \"Call your aids. I am prepared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence and follow!\" harshly replied the stranger. \"Lucky for you if\r\nyou are prepared for all.\"\r\n\r\nWithout the dungeon stood a third man, muffled in a short mantle.\r\nFederico shuddered. \"Another of the hangman brood!\" he murmured. \"Lead\r\non, I fear thee not!\" The man followed without a word. After traversing\r\nseveral corridors, they ascended a lofty staircase. Behind each door\r\nFederico fancied a torture chamber or a garrote, but none of them\r\nrevealed what he expected. At last his conductor paused.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready,\" he said, \"to appear before your Supreme Judge?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready,\" Federico solemnly replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then enter here.\"\r\n\r\nA door opened, the student set foot across the threshold, and uttered a\r\ncry of surprise. Instead of the garrote, instead of racks and torturers,\r\nhe beheld a gorgeous saloon, brilliantly lighted up with a profusion of\r\nwax tapers. Five or six men of distinguished mien and elegant\r\nappearance, with stars and orders upon their breasts, were grouped round\r\na large carved chair, and looked curiously and expectantly at Federico.\r\nBut he scarcely observed them. Even on a lady of great beauty and\r\nmajestic aspect, who sat in the chair, wrapped in a costly mantle of\r\nembroidered velvet, his attention was fixed but for an instant, for\r\nbehind her stood another lady, somewhat pale and anxious-looking, but\r\nwho yet bore so strong a resemblance to the cause of his sufferings, to\r\nher of the rose-coloured robe, to Rosaura herself, that all the blood in\r\nhis veins rushed to his heart. Her name hovered on his lips, and,\r\nforgetting everything but love and newly-revived hope, he was about to\r\nspring forward and throw himself at her feet, when the lady in the chair\r\naddressed him.\r\n\r\n\"Remain there, senor,\" she said with a smile and gracious movement of\r\nher head, as if she divined the impulse to which the impetuous student\r\nso nearly yielded. \"You have had strange adventures, I am told, within\r\nthe last few hours. They will terminate happily for you, if you tell me\r\nthe whole truth, and relate without reserve all that has occurred. Where\r\nhave you passed this night? What took you to the house in which you were\r\nfound hidden? What heard you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senora,\" replied Federico, respectfully, but firmly; \"I have already\r\npreferred death to the revelation of a secret that is not mine. My\r\nresolution is unchanged. I can answer no questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady cast a friendly and approving glance at the steadfast youth.\r\n\r\n\"Now, by our Lady,\" she said, turning to the gentlemen around her, \"this\r\nis a chivalrous fidelity, right pleasant to behold in these unchivalrous\r\ndays. I doubt not, young Sir, that the lady of your affections will know\r\nhow to repay it. But here are great interests at stake, and your excuse\r\nmay not avail. You must relate all, truly and without reserve. And to\r\nremove your scruples, know that the secret you have so bravely kept is\r\nno longer one for any here present. Proceed!\"\r\n\r\nA look from Rosaura confirmed this assurance, and without farther\r\nhesitation, Federico told his adventures, and repeated the dialogue he\r\nhad heard from the closet. At times the listeners seemed surprised; at\r\ntimes they smiled, or looked significantly at each other, and spoke\r\ntogether in brief whispers. Twice had the student to tell his tale, and\r\nhis words were taken down by one of the gentlemen present. That done,\r\nthe lady rose quickly from her chair, laid a hand upon his shoulder, and\r\nfixing her keen bright eyes searchingly upon his face, pointed to the\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\n\"Can you swear to that?\" she cried. \"Is it all true? Before God and his\r\nsaints, did all pass as you have said? No word too much or too little?\r\nSaw you the document with your own eyes? _Santa Madre!_ Is it possible?\r\nSurely it cannot be; and yet--my friends, what say you? What think you,\r\nDuke of San Fernando, and you, Marquis of Santa Cruz? What says his\r\nGrace of San Lorenzo, and our discreet friend, Martinez de la Rosa? No,\r\nI need not fear, whilst thus surrounded by the best and wisest in the\r\nland. Cambronero, advise us. How may we defeat the machinations of our\r\ncrafty foes?\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who had written down the deposition, raised his head, and\r\nFederico recognised the features of one renowned throughout Spain as a\r\nwise counsellor and learned lawyer. With surprise and respect the\r\nstudent gazed at the distinguished and illustrious persons he had just\r\nheard named.\r\n\r\n\"Much depends,\" said Cambronero, \"on his Majesty's health. If unhappily\r\nhe departs this life without regaining consciousness, we must recover\r\nthe surreptitiously obtained document at point of sword. No other course\r\nwill then be open to us. But if, by God's gracious mercy, the king's\r\nsenses return, not a moment must be lost in obtaining from his hand a\r\nrevocation of the act. He must be told every thing; he must be shown how\r\nhis confidence has been abused, and what base advantage has been taken\r\nof a momentary weakness. He must hear the witnesses whom Heaven has\r\nraised up for your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" cried the lady, with an impatient and energetic gesture, \"you are\r\nright, Cambronero; we must act! All that can be done, Christina will do.\r\nThey shall not triumph by weakness of hers! Don Fernando still lives,\r\ncan yet retract. He shall hear how they have laboured to bring shame\r\nupon his name; shall learn the perfidy of those who have environed him\r\nwith their snares! I go to tell him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen left the room. \"To me it seems, Senores,\" said Cambronero, a\r\nquiet smile playing on his shrewd features, \"that things have happened\r\nfor the best, and that the result of all this is not doubtful, provided\r\nonly the king be not already dead. The Apostolicals have been active.\r\nTheir creatures have worked their way even into the cabinet and the\r\ncamarilla. The guards, the captains-general, and many officers of state\r\nare long since gained over. In all cases, on King Ferdinand's death, a\r\nwar is inevitable. The succession to the throne is a Gordian knot, to be\r\ncut only by the sword. The Infante will never yield his claim, or admit\r\nas valid the abrogation of the ancient Salic law.[5] And doubtless the\r\ncrown would be his, were not the people and the spirit of the times\r\nopposed to him. He is retrograde; the Spain of to-day is and must be\r\nprogressive. The nation is uneasy; it hates despotic government and the\r\ninquisition; it ferments from north to south, from Portugal to the\r\nMediterranean; but that fermentation would lack a rallying point without\r\nthe decree which commands all to cling to Christina and her children,\r\nand repel the Infante. The partisans of Carlos have striven to obtain by\r\ncraft what they could not hope to conquer by the strong hand, and they\r\nhave succeeded in making a dying monarch revoke in a moment of delirium\r\nor imbecility that all-important act. The revocation is in the hands of\r\nthe Infante; the Salic law is once more the law of the land, and\r\nChristina's children are in their turn disinherited. And if it is\r\nimpossible to restore the king to consciousness, I fear----\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried the Marquis of Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n\"That we are on the eve of a great revolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said the Duke of San Lorenzo, looking anxiously around him.\r\n\"These are dangerous words, my friend.\" And his eye fell upon the\r\nhandsome countenance of Martinez de la Rosa, who smiled thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Call it reform, Cambronero,\" he said; \"wise progress of the times,\r\nmoderate, cautious, adapted to the circumstances; not rash, reckless,\r\nsweeping revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer cast a keen glance at the former minister of the Cortes.\r\n\r\n\"Reform!\" he cried. \"Ay, certainly; but what reform? Does Senor de la\r\nRosa mean such reform as he helped to bring about? I bid him beware:\r\nthese are no times for trifling. Here we stand, but a few paces from the\r\ndeath-bed of a powerful prince. He fettered this revolution or reform;\r\nbut, Senores, it was only for a while and in appearance. Like the mole,\r\nit has laboured and advanced, surely and unseen. Happy for our king if\r\nhe expires before the vanity of his efforts, and the inutility of the\r\nbloodshed and misery they have occasioned, are demonstrated; before he\r\nlearns that a principle never dies, though all the artillery of the\r\nworld be brought to bear upon it. History judges the dead; nations judge\r\nthe living. Let us so act that we may stand with honour before both\r\ntribunals.\"\r\n\r\n\"The subject leads us too far,\" said the poet and minister, rising from\r\nhis chair and glancing at Federico, who, struck and delighted by\r\nCambronero's words, gazed at him with expanded brow and flashing eyes.\r\n\"Let us beware of kindling fanaticism: coolness and prudence are\r\nbecoming to men, and, God knows, we need both.\"\r\n\r\nHe took Cambronero's arm, and led him to the other end of the spacious\r\napartment. The noblemen followed, and the conversation was resumed in a\r\nlower tone. So enthralling had been the interest with which Federico had\r\nlistened to the words of these influential Liberals, that for an instant\r\nhe had neglected Rosaura, who stood nearly concealed behind the swelling\r\ncushions and high gilt back of the throne-like chair. Her beautiful face\r\nwore an anxious, inquiring expression, which seemed to reproach him with\r\nforgetting her; but as he drew near, she smiled, and rays of love and\r\nhope broke from beneath her long dark lashes. And under the magic\r\ninfluence of those beaming eyes, Federico's doubts and fears vanished\r\nlike frost before mid-day sun, and were replaced by a transport of\r\nblissful emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Rosaura!\" he exclaimed, \"what unspeakable joy is this! Strange, indeed,\r\nhave been the events of the night! The wonders of Arabian tales are\r\nrealised. A moment ago, I awaited death in a dungeon; and behold I am in\r\na king's chamber, and at your feet, Rosaura. Explain these things,\r\nadored mistress of my heart! How do we thus meet? How came you hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"With our friend, Geronimo Regato,\" replied the lady.\r\n\r\n\"The traitor!\" indignantly exclaimed Federico. \"No thanks to him if I\r\nescape with life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge not so hastily,\" cried Rosaura: \"you know not all you owe Regato.\r\nFrom him I first heard your name. He was my confidant; he knew my\r\naversion to the detested man, who considered me already his own. My\r\nfather, of an old family, although not of the highest nobility, was\r\nPresident of the Burgos Tribunal, and by commercial transactions in the\r\ntime of the Constitution, he acquired great wealth. My hated suitor is\r\nalso sprung from the people. My father was his friend, and at one time\r\nhad to thank his influence for escape from persecution. Out of gratitude\r\nhe promised him my hand, and, dying a year ago, left him my guardian. In\r\nthat capacity he administered my estates, and had me in his power. But,\r\nthanks to the Virgin, I am at last free from his odious control.\"\r\n\r\nShe gazed tenderly at Federico, and held out her hand, which he covered\r\nwith kisses. But she hastily withdrew it, on becoming aware that their\r\nproceedings were observed by the group of politicians.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the time and place?\" she said, with a smile of sweet confusion\r\nand arch reproach. \"And yet, Federico, best beloved, why should I feign\r\nindifference, or conceal that my heart is wholly yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Angel!\" cried the enraptured student, trembling with ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" whispered Rosaura. \"Cambronero looks and laughs at us. Hear me,\r\nFederico. The decisive moment approaches; but I fear it not--I love and\r\nhope. It was Geronimo, disguised as a Gallego, who brought you to my\r\nabode; Geronimo, hates him whom we hate; he knew me as a child, was my\r\nfather's friend, and loves us both. He spoke to me of you long before I\r\nsaw you; he told me the hour of your walks in the Prado. At the first\r\nglance I recognised you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is that singular man?\" Federico inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I know not, but doubtless at no great distance. This night, a few hours\r\nago, I lay sleepless on my pillow, anxious for your fate, when a\r\ncarriage stopped at the door. It was surrounded with guards and\r\ntorch-bearers, and I was told that my presence was instantly required at\r\nthe palace. My alarm at so untimely a summons was dissipated by the\r\narrival of Geronimo. 'Fear nothing,' he said: 'the hour of happiness is\r\nat hand. He whom you hate is vanquished. Federico is his conqueror.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I his conqueror!\" cried the student. And then, recalling all that had\r\noccurred. \"Strange destiny!\" he continued. \"Yes, I now see that the\r\nsecret intrigues of a dangerous and powerful man have been revealed by\r\nmy means. But who is he? I in vain conjecture.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know him?\" cried Rosaura, greatly astonished--\"not\r\nknow----?\" She suddenly paused, for at that moment the door burst open,\r\nand the Queen entered the room, in extreme haste and violent agitation.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty is recovered,\" she exclaimed, her voice shrill and\r\nquivering with contending emotions; \"his swoon is over, God's grace be\r\nthanked. I have spoken, my noble friends, and not in vain. The King will\r\nhimself hear the witnesses. These young people must come with me. Call\r\nGeronimo Regato. Remain here, Cambronero, and all of you; I must see you\r\nagain, I need your counsel--desert me not!\"\r\n\r\n\"When your majesty next honours us with your presence,\" said Cambronero,\r\nbowing low, and raising his voice, \"it will be as Queen Regent of\r\nSpain.\"\r\n\r\nRegato entered the room, and Federico rubbed his eyes in fresh\r\nastonishment. It was the same man in the dark mantle who had followed\r\nhim from his dungeon to the Queen's audience chamber, and whom he had\r\ntaken for an executioner. Gradually the mysteries of the night\r\nunravelled themselves. He understood that if Regato had accused him, it\r\nhad been to avert suspicion from himself, and that he might work more\r\neffectually for both, by revealing to the Queen or to Cambronero what he\r\nhad learned from Federico, and by placing before them the list of the\r\nconspirators. Musing upon this, and each moment more convinced of\r\nGeronimo's wisdom and good faith, he followed the Queen, who, with rapid\r\nstep, led him and Rosaura through a suite of splendid apartments.\r\nStopping before a door, she turned to the student.\r\n\r\n\"Speak fearlessly,\" she said: \"suppress no word of truth, and reckon on\r\nmy favour and protection.\"\r\n\r\nFederico bowed. The door turned noiselessly on its hinges, and the\r\nQueen paused a moment as in anger and surprise, whilst a dark glow\r\nflushed her excited and passionate countenance. From the door a view was\r\ncommanded of the whole apartment, which was dimly lighted, and occupied\r\nby several persons, standing in a half circle, round a bed placed near a\r\nmarble chimneypiece. Upon this bed, propped by cushions into a half\r\nsitting posture, lay Ferdinand VII., his suffering features and livid\r\ncomplexion looking ghastly and spectral in the faint light, and\r\ncontrasted with the snow-white linen of his pillow. A black-robed priest\r\nknelt at his feet, and mumbled the prayer for the dying; Castillo the\r\nphysician held his arm, and reckoned the slow throbs of the feeble\r\npulse. At the bed-side sat a lady, her hands folded on the velvet\r\ncounterpane, her large dark eyes glancing uneasily, almost fiercely,\r\naround the room--her countenance by no means that of a sorrowing and\r\nresigned mourner.\r\n\r\n\"The document!\" groaned the sick man, with painful effort; \"the\r\ndocument, where is it? To your hands I intrusted it; from you I claim it\r\nback. Produce it instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gracious sovereign,\" replied the person addressed--and at the sound\r\nof that sinister voice, Federico felt Rosaura's hand tremble in his--\"my\r\ngracious sovereign, that paper, that weighty and important document,\r\nsigned after wise and long deliberation, cannot thus lightly be revoked\r\nby a momentary impulse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" interrupted the King angrily.\r\n\r\n\"In the safest keeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the hands of the Infante,\" cried the Queen, entering the room, and\r\napproaching the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Traitor!\" exclaimed Ferdinand, making a violent but fruitless effort to\r\nraise himself. \"Is it thus you repay my confidence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear me, gracious sir,\" cried Tadeo; but his tongue faltered, and he\r\nturned deadly pale, for just then he perceived Rosaura, Federico, and\r\nRegato standing at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hear these,\" said the Queen, placing her arm affectionately round her\r\nsuffering husband, and bowing her head over him, whilst tears, real or\r\nfeigned, of sympathy or passion, fell fast from her eyes. \"They have\r\nbetrayed you, Sire; they have abused your confidence; they have\r\nconspired against me, against you, against your innocent children.\r\nApproach, Don Federico; speak freely and fearlessly. You are under the\r\nsafeguard of your King, who demands of you the entire truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" said Ferdinand; \"I have read the young man's deposition. Look\r\nat it, sir,\" he added, to Tadeo, pointing to the paper, \"and deny it if\r\nyou can.\"\r\n\r\nTadeo obeyed; as he read, his hand visibly shook, and at last he dropped\r\nthe paper, and sank upon his knee.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot deny it,\" he said, in a troubled voice, \"but let your majesty\r\nhear my justification. I implore permission to explain my conduct.\"\r\n\r\nThe little lady who sat beside the King's bed sprang to her feet, her\r\ncountenance flaming with wrath, and rushed upon the kneeling man.\r\nUnbridled rage flashed from her eyes, and distorted each feature of her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Traitor!\" she cried, \"where is the document? what have you done with\r\nit? You stole it, to deliver to men as vile and base as yourself!\r\nTraitor, produce it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam!\" exclaimed the astonished object of this furious apostrophe.\r\n\r\nHis remonstrance was cut short, for, quick as lightning, the\r\nungovernable Infanta raised her hand, and let it fall upon his face with\r\nsuch vigour and good will, that the minister, unprepared for so\r\nunwomanly an assault, staggered backwards, and narrowly avoided a fall.\r\n\r\n\"Carlotta!\" cried the Queen, seizing her sister's arm, and restraining\r\nher from further violence.\r\n\r\n\"The villain! the traitor!\" shrieked the Infanta, in tones that\r\nresounded through the palace.\r\n\r\n\"Away with him from my sight!\" cried Ferdinand, his voice growing\r\nfainter as he spoke. \"The Queen, whom I appoint Regent during my\r\nillness, will decide upon his fate. I myself strip him of all offices\r\nand honours. Away with him, and for ever! You are no longer my minister,\r\nTADEO CALOMARDE. Oh, God! what a bitter deception! He too! He too! By\r\nall the saints, he shall rue it. His treachery is my death-stroke!\"\r\n\r\nThe King sank back like a corpse upon his cushions; but presently\r\nrecovered himself, and with all speed, before the assembled ministers,\r\nthe extorted decree was annulled, the Pragmatic Sanction again declared\r\nin full force, and the Queen nominated Regent. Whilst this took place,\r\nFederico, unheeded in the bustle of such important business, remained\r\nlike one entranced. It was Calomarde, then, the man whose ruthless hand\r\nhad been so pitilessly stretched forth over the suffering land--it was\r\nthe all-powerful minister, the curse of Spain, the butcher of the noble\r\nTorrijos and his unhappy companions, whom he, the insignificant student,\r\nhad cast down from his high state! The giant had succumbed before the\r\npigmy; the virtual ruler of the kingdom had fallen by the agency of one\r\nwhom, a day previously, he might with impunity have annihilated. Events\r\nso extraordinary and of such rapid occurrence, were hard to comprehend;\r\nand Federico had scarcely convinced himself of their reality, when he\r\nreceived, a few hours afterwards, a summons to the Queen's presence.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun shone into the royal apartment, revealing the traces of\r\na sleepless night and recent agitation upon the handsome features of the\r\nnewly-made Regent. She received the student with a smile, and placed\r\nRosaura's hand in his.\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing from Calomarde,\" she said. \"He has fled his well-merited\r\npunishment. Those sent for his arrest, sought him in vain. You are under\r\nmy protection, Rosaura--and you also, Don Federico. You have established\r\na lasting claim upon my gratitude, and my friendship shall never fail\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not appear how long these fair promises were borne in mind by a\r\nqueen whose word, since that time, has been far oftener pledged than\r\nredeemed. Perhaps she thought she had acquitted herself of all\r\nobligations when, three months later, she honoured with her presence the\r\nnuptials of Federico and Rosaura, and with her own hand twined a costly\r\nwreath of brilliants through the sable ringlets of the beautiful bride.\r\nAnd perhaps the young couple neither needed nor desired further marks of\r\nher favour; for they withdrew from Madrid to reside in happy retirement\r\nupon Rosaura's estates. Geronimo Regato went with them; and for a while\r\nwas their welcome guest. But his old habits were too confirmed to be\r\neradicated, even by the influence of those he loved best. The atmosphere\r\nof a court, the excitement of political intrigue, were essential to his\r\nexistence, and he soon returned to the capital. There, under a very\r\ndifferent name from that by which he has here been designated, he played\r\nan important part in the stirring epoch that succeeded the death of\r\nFerdinand the Well-beloved.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] By the Pragmatic Sanction, promulgated during the first pregnancy of\r\nChristina, in May 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE.\r\n\r\nA METAPHYSICAL FRAGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have made their way through the German systems of idealism,\r\nfrom Kant to Hegel--destined in a future age to form one of the most\r\ncurious chapters in the history, or romance, of philosophy--have\r\nprobably, for the most part, come to the conclusion of their task, with\r\nthe profound impression of the futility of the study of metaphysics,\r\nwhich, full of labour, is yet fruitless as idleness. _L'art de s'egarer\r\navec methode_--such it has been wittily defined, and such our Teutonic\r\nneighbours have been resolved to demonstrate it. Yet, this is not\r\naltogether the impression, we think, which such a course of study ought\r\nto produce: a better lesson may be drawn from it. There is, after all, a\r\nright as well as a wrong method of philosophising. The one leads, it may\r\nbe, but to a few modest results, of no very brilliant or original\r\ncharacter, yet of sterling value and importance. The other may conduct\r\nto startling paradox, to applauded subtleties, to bold and novel\r\nspeculations, but baseless, transient, treacherous. It evidently\r\nrequires something more than intellectual keenness; it requires the\r\nvirtue of forbearance, and a temperate spirit, to adhere to sober\r\nrectitude of thought, and eschew the temptations that a daring and\r\nself-willed philosophy displays. Such is the lesson which these \"follies\r\nof the wise\" ought to inculcate. They should lead us to intrench\r\nourselves more securely than ever within the sound rules for the\r\ninvestigation of truth.\r\n\r\nPhilosophise men will--men must. Even the darkest paths, and the most\r\nlabyrinthine of metaphysics, must be perpetually trodden. In vain is it\r\nproclaimed that they lead back only to the point of ignorance from which\r\nthey started; in vain is it demonstrated that certain problems are\r\nindemonstrable. If the same race of men lived for ever upon the earth,\r\nsuch inextricable problems might at length be set at rest. But each new\r\ngeneration finds them as fresh and attractive as if they had never been\r\ntouched, never probed and tortured by fruitless examination; to each\r\ngeneration they appear in all the unabated charms of mystery; to each\r\ngeneration must their solution at least be shown to be unattainable. In\r\nvain you write over the portal _Lasciate ogni speranza_! there is always\r\na band of _youth_ newly arrived before the gates, who will rush in.\r\n\r\nIt is futile, therefore, to think of discarding metaphysics; if a good\r\nsystem is not adopted, its contrary will speedily prevail. \"A good\r\nphysician,\" says Paul Richter, \"saves us--from a bad one--if from\r\nnothing else.\" And a rational method of philosophising has, at all\r\nevents, the same negative merit. Good sense, cries one, is sufficient\r\nfor all the purposes of life, and even for all the useful walks of\r\nliterature. The remark might be pertinent enough if you could secure a\r\nman in the quiet, uninterrupted possession of his plain good sense. But\r\nhe who has not studied philosophy in his youth, will probably plunge\r\ninto it, without study, in his old age. There is no guarantee against\r\nthe infection of speculative thought. Some question suddenly interests\r\nthe man of hitherto quiescent temper--invades his tranquillity--prompts\r\nhim to penetrate below the surface of the matter--to analyse its\r\nintricacies--to sound its depths. Meanwhile, untutored, undisciplined\r\nfor such labours, he speedily involves himself in inextricable\r\ndifficulties--grasps at some plausibility that had been a thousand times\r\nbefore seized on and relinquished--tilts valiantly at his men of\r\nstraw--thrice slays the dead--and in short, strong-limbed as he is, and\r\nwith all his full-grown thews and sinews, plays upon this new arena all\r\nthe vagaries of a child. It may be said of philosophy, as it has been\r\nsaid of love,--it is, or it has been, or it will one day be, your\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nWe have seen reverend doctors of divinity present no very dignified\r\nspectacle when they have suddenly bethought them of paying their\r\nsomewhat late devotions to philosophy. Accustomed to receive, as their\r\ndue, a profound respect from others, they assume with easy confidence\r\nthe cloak of the philosopher; and while they are thinking only how to\r\narrange its folds with classic grace, they are unconsciously winding\r\nround their sturdy limbs what will sadly entangle their feet, and bring\r\nthem, with shame and sore contusions, to the ground. Some will parade an\r\nancient theory of morals, and introduce to us with all the pride of\r\nfresh discovery what now looks \"as pale and hollow as a ghost.\" Others\r\nexplain the beautiful; and with a charming audacity, a courage that is\r\nquite exhilarating, propound some theoretic fancy which has the same\r\nrelation to philosophy that Quarle's Emblems bear to that pictorial art\r\nthey especially delight to descant upon. But the greater number of these\r\nbelated wanderers in the paths of philosophy, enter through the portals\r\nof religion. How could it be otherwise? Religion and philosophy touch at\r\nso many points--have so many problems in common--that the first moment\r\nthe good man bethinks him he will be profound, sees him plunged in all\r\nthe darkest enigmas of speculative thought, there to lose himself in we\r\nknow not what heretical delusions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no one thing on which we are more disposed to\r\ncongratulate Scotland than on her chairs of philosophy. Occupied by her\r\nmost distinguished men, and teaching a sound system of psychology, they\r\nearly train her youth to the severest and most useful discipline of\r\nthought. They have given its tone and its strength to the intellect of\r\nScotland. They teach it to face all difficulties manfully, and to turn\r\nwith equal manliness from vain and presumptuous speculations, which,\r\nunder a boastful show of profundity, conceal invariably an arrant\r\ndogmatism. We turn with hearty satisfaction from the tissue of false\r\nsubtleties which the German professor lays before his youth, to the\r\ncareful and modest analysis of mental phenomena by which a professor in\r\nour northern universities at once enlightens and fortifies the mind.\r\nScotland, may well be proud of the position she has now long held in the\r\nphilosophical world. Her oscillations of error she, too, has no doubt\r\nexhibited--a necessary condition this of vitality and progress--but\r\nnowhere has a body of philosophers so systematically adhered to the\r\nsound canons of reasoning and research, and that upon a subject where\r\nthere is the greatest facility and temptation to depart from them.\r\n\r\nM. Cousin, and others who take that discursive light-tripping\r\nphilosopher for their guide, have represented the Scotch as a sort of\r\nhalf Germans, and have both praised them, and praised them coldly, on\r\nthis very account, that they have travelled half-way, and only half-way,\r\ntowards the region of \"high _a priori_\" speculation. With M. Cousin's\r\npermission, the Scotch come of quite another house. His praise we should\r\nbeg leave to decline: he may carry it to Alexandria, if he will. The\r\nmethod of philosophising pursued in Germany is fundamentally different\r\nfrom that which happily obtains in Scotland. No two schools of\r\nphilosophy could resemble each other less. For ourselves, we regard the\r\nwhole history of modern German speculation--the most remarkable\r\ninstance, in our judgment, of great mental powers ill applied which the\r\nworld has ever witnessed--as one continuous comment upon this text, the\r\nnecessity of adhering to careful, honest observation of mental\r\nphenomena, however homely may be the results of such observation, and\r\nthe astounding conclusions to which a train of thought rigidly pursued\r\nmay conduct us, if, at its very point of departure, it has broken loose\r\nfrom this the first obligation of philosophy. The whole career of German\r\nspeculation manifests a disregard of some of those fundamental\r\nprinciples of human belief, which, according to M. Cousin himself, it is\r\nthe peculiar merit of the Scotch to have seized and held with tenacity.\r\n\r\nThese observations we will illustrate by a glance at the theories\r\npropounded on the great subject of perception--on the nature of our\r\nknowledge of the external world, this _visible and tangible_ creation.\r\n\r\nTo a plain unsophisticated man, a stranger to the subtleties of\r\nmetaphysical thought, it appears quite inconceivable, when he is told\r\nthat the existence of the visible and palpable scene before him should\r\nbe converted into a problem of apparently invincible difficulty. Yet so\r\nit is. The metaphysician first carries off in triumph what are called\r\nits secondary qualities, as colour and heat, proving them to be no\r\nqualities of matter, but of mind, or the sensitive being. He next\r\nassails what had been pronounced to be its primary or essential\r\nqualities; the dark tangible mass that he had left behind is not\r\nsuffered to retain its inert existence; extension, the power to fill\r\nspace or resist pressure, what are these, he asks, but our own\r\nsensations or remembered sensations of touch, which have got associated,\r\nembodied together, agglomerated round some occult cause? What, after\r\nall, he exclaims, do we know of matter but as a _something_ which\r\npossesses certain influences over _us_?--a something which is utterly\r\nunrepresented to us by the senses. And now this word \"substance,\" which\r\nformerly expressed a thing so well known, and every moment handled and\r\nlooked at, is transformed to an invisible, intangible, imperceptible\r\nsubstratum--an unknown upholder of certain qualities, or, in more exact\r\nlanguage, an unseen power clothing itself in _our_ attributes--an\r\nexistence far more resembling what is popularly understood by spirit\r\nthan by matter. At length, even this unseen substratum is drawn within\r\nthe world of thought, and becomes itself mere thought. There is _no_\r\nmatter, there is no space, save what the mind creates for, and out of\r\nitself. Our man of simple apprehension, much bewildered, not at all\r\nconvinced, breaks from the chain of sophistry, opens wide his eyes, and\r\ndeclares after all that \"seeing is believing.\"\r\n\r\nWe think so too.\r\n\r\nOn this subject of _perception_ it is well known that Reid and Stewart,\r\nrefusing to be drawn into any hypothesis or unsatisfactory analysis,\r\ncontented themselves with stating, in the preciser language of the\r\nschools, the _fact_ as it appears to the plain unsophisticated observer.\r\nReid's explanations are unfortunately mingled up with his controversy\r\nagainst the old hypothesis of _ideas_ or _images_ of things perceived in\r\nthe mind--an hypothesis combated by him with unnecessary vehemence--but\r\nthis detracts little from their substantive correctness or utility. This\r\nstrange notion of images emanating from the external object, entering\r\nthe mind, and being there perceived, was, after all, in its origin,\r\nrather a physical than a metaphysical hypothesis. The ancient speculator\r\nupon the causes of things felt, as we feel at this moment, the necessity\r\nfor some medium of communication between the eye and the distant object,\r\nand not having detected this medium in the light which traverses or\r\nfills the space between them, he had recourse to this clumsy invention\r\nof _images_ or _species_ raying out from the surfaces of things. At the\r\ntime when Reid wrote, this hypothesis, in its crude form, cannot be said\r\nto have existed; but it had left its traces in the philosophical\r\nlanguage of the period, and there was certainly a vague notion prevalent\r\nthat the idea of an object was a _tertium quid_, a something that was\r\nneither the mind nor the object.\r\n\r\nWe will quote the statement which Dugald Stewart makes of Reid's\r\ndoctrine of perception. As he himself adopts the statement, it will\r\nembrace at once the opinion of both these philosophers:--\r\n\r\n\"To what, may it be asked, does this statement (of Reid's) amount?\r\nMerely to this, that the mind is so formed that certain impressions\r\nproduced on our organs of sense by external objects, are followed by\r\ncorrespondent sensations, and that these sensations (which have no more\r\nresemblance to the qualities of matter, than the words of a language\r\nhave to the things they denote) are followed by a perception of the\r\nexistence and qualities of the bodies by which the impressions are made;\r\nthat all the steps of this progress are equally incomprehensible; and\r\nthat for any thing we can prove to the contrary, the connexion between\r\nthe sensation and the perception, as well as that between the impression\r\nand the sensation, may be both arbitrary; that it is therefore by no\r\nmeans impossible that our sensations may be merely the occasions on\r\nwhich the correspondent perceptions are excited; and that at any rate\r\nthe consideration of these sensations, which are attributes of mind,\r\ncan throw no light on the manner in which we acquire our knowledge of\r\nthe existence and qualities of body. From this view of the subject, it\r\nfollows that it is the external objects themselves, and not any species\r\nor images of these objects (_or, we may add, any mere agglomeration of\r\npresent and remembered sensations_) that the mind perceives; and that\r\nalthough, by the constitution of our nature, certain sensations are\r\nrendered the constant antecedents of our perceptions, yet it is just as\r\ndifficult to explain how our perceptions are obtained by their means, as\r\nit would be upon the supposition that the mind were all at once inspired\r\nwith them, without any concomitant sensations whatever.\"--(_Elements of\r\nthe Philosophy of the Human Mind_, Vol. i. p. 92.)\r\n\r\nIt is seen here that both Reid and Stewart considered perception as a\r\nsimple elementary fact or phenomenon of the human mind, and refused\r\ntheir assent to that analysis which would resolve it into sensation,\r\naccompanied with certain acts of memory and judgment. This last,\r\nhowever, has been the most popular amongst modern psychologists, who\r\nhave many of them expressed an extreme impatience at the apparent\r\nsluggishness of these veterans in philosophy. We remember the time when\r\nwe shared the same feeling of impatience, and thought it a most useless\r\nencumbrance to maintain this _perception_ amongst the simple elements of\r\nthe human mind: we now think otherwise, and see reason to acquiesce in\r\nthe sound judgment, which took up the only safe, though unostentatious\r\nposition, which this embarrassing subject affords.\r\n\r\nDr Brown, it is well known, departed from his predecessors at this\r\npoint, and may here be considered as one of the ablest representatives\r\nof the _sensational_ school. He expended much ingenuity in his analysis\r\nof perception, though in our opinion with very little result. No one saw\r\nmore distinctly than he, that sensation alone could never give us the\r\nidea of an external object, or of space, or any thing external to the\r\nmind. No one has more satisfactorily shown that the notion of an\r\nextended resisting body, supposed by many to be resolved into the\r\nsensations of touch, cannot be derived from this source alone, but must\r\nhave some other origin than the pure sensation, which is a mere mental\r\nphenomenon or state of the consciousness. But he imagined he had\r\novercome the difficulty by introducing to us a new sensation, the\r\n_muscular_, that which we experience when we move our limbs. What he\r\ncould not derive from the old sense of touch, he thought himself able to\r\ndeduce from the reasonings of the mind on this muscular sensation; but\r\nthe same difficulties which he himself so lucidly set forth when\r\ntreating upon touch, will be found to pursue him here also. This\r\nmuscular sensation, like every other, is in itself a mere state of the\r\nconsciousness, begins and ends in a mere pleasure or pain. That it\r\nterminates abruptly, and contrary to our volition, in a feeling of\r\nresistance, (as when our arm is arrested in its motion,) is saying\r\nnothing more than that one sensation gives place to another without our\r\nwilling it; a statement which might be made in a thousand other cases of\r\nsensation with equal propriety. But the author shall explain his own\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\"The infant stretches his arm for the first time, by that volition\r\nwithout a known object, which is either a mere instinct or very near\r\nakin to one; this motion is accompanied with a certain feeling; he\r\nrepeats the volition, which moves his arm, fifty or one thousand times,\r\nand the same progress of feeling takes place during the muscular action.\r\nIn this repeated progress he feels the truth of that intuitive\r\nproposition, which in the whole course of the life that awaits him is to\r\nbe the source of all his expectations, and the guide of all his\r\nactions--the simple proposition that _what has been_ as an antecedent,\r\nwill be followed by _what has been_ as a consequent. At length he\r\nstretches out his arm _again_, and instead of the accustomed\r\nprogression, there arises, in the resistance of some object opposed to\r\nhim, a feeling of a very different kind, which, if he persevere in his\r\nvoluntary effort, increases gradually to severe pain, before he has half\r\ncompleted the usual progress. There is a difference, therefore, which\r\nwe may without any absurdity suppose to astonish the little reasoner;\r\nfor the expectation of similar consequents from similar antecedents, is\r\nobservable even in his earliest actions, and is probably the result of\r\nan original law of mind, as universal as that which renders certain\r\nsensations of sight and sound the immediate result of certain affections\r\nof our eye or ear. To any being who is thus impressed with belief of\r\nsimilarities of sequence, a different _consequent_ necessarily implies a\r\ndifference of the _antecedent_. In the case at present supposed,\r\nhowever, the infant, who as yet knows nothing but himself, is conscious\r\nof no previous difference; and the feeling of _resistance_ seems to him,\r\ntherefore, something _unknown_, which has its _cause in something that\r\nis not himself_.\"--(Vol. i. p. 514.)\r\n\r\nThere is a certain pre-arrangement here of the circumstances to suit the\r\nconvenience of explanation. The little arm of the infant being very\r\nclosely fastened to its own little body, it could hardly move it fifty\r\nor a thousand times in succession, or even once, without its muscular\r\nsensation terminating in the sense of resistance, or pressure, which is\r\nbut another form of the sense of touch. In short, this would be always\r\nsooner or later the consequent upon this muscular sensation. And it\r\nappears very evident that \"the little reasoner,\" more especially if he\r\nheld the same doctrine as Brown on the nature of cause and effect, would\r\nlook no further than the _first_ sensation for the cause of the\r\n_second_. There would be few instances in his limited experience more\r\nmarked of invariable antecedence and consequence than this,--that the\r\nmuscular sensation would sooner or later be followed by a tactual one.\r\nIf we could suppose it possible, that the infant logician had to make\r\nthe discovery of an external world by an effort of reasoning upon its\r\nsensations, we should say that this case was the least likely of any to\r\nlead him to the discovery--the least likely to impel him to look out of\r\nthe circle of sensations for a cause of them.\r\n\r\nMere sensation of any kind, reason on it how we will, cannot account for\r\nthe perception of external objects, which is another and separate fact.\r\nWe are reduced to admit that it is by a simple primary law of our\r\nconstitution that the organs of sense (which may with equal propriety be\r\ncalled the organs of perception) convey to us a knowledge of the\r\nexternal world. We touch, and a tangible extended body is made known to\r\nus; we open our eyes, and a visible body is before us.\r\n\r\nDr Brown, adopting and refining upon Berkeley's theory of vision,\r\nattributes originally nothing more than the mere sensation of colour to\r\nthe eye, which sensation, by association with that of touch, becomes\r\nextended, so to speak, over an external surface, and defined into\r\nlimited figures. We are not disposed to lay any greater stress than Dr\r\nBrown himself upon the _image_ said to be traced upon the retina; but we\r\nsay that the eye, as well as the touch, immediately informs us of\r\nexternal surface and definite figure.\r\n\r\nThere is, it is true, a _sensation_ of colour apart from the\r\n_perception_. This may be separated, in our reflection, from all\r\nexternal surface. It is a _pleasure_ which colour gives, and which\r\nenters largely into the complex sentiments of beauty. But our notion of\r\ncolour itself we cannot dissociate from external surface: we cannot\r\nthink of colour but as something outward. And if it comes to us\r\noriginally under the condition of external surface, it must also present\r\nitself originally under certain forms and figures; for only where the\r\nwhole field of vision is occupied by one unvaried colour, as when the\r\neye is fixed upon a cloudless sky, could there be the perception of\r\nsurface without some figure, more or less defined on it.\r\n\r\nAnd why is it, that on a subject of this nature the manifest facts\r\nwitnessed in the whole animal creation are to be overlooked? If other\r\nanimals evidently, on the first opening of their eyes, see form, and\r\nmovement, and the whole world before them; does not this sufficiently\r\nintimate the instantaneous knowledge which it is the nature of vision to\r\nbestow? The human infant arrives, indeed, more slowly at the perfect use\r\nof its senses. It arrives, also, more slowly at the perfect use of its\r\nlimbs. But we never conclude because it does not rise and skip about the\r\nfields like a dropped lamb, that there is any essential difference\r\nbetween its muscular powers and those of other animals of creation. Why\r\nshould we suppose that its vision is regulated by different laws merely\r\nbecause it obtains the perfect use of its eyesight somewhat later?\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from the imperfect analysis which the _sensational_\r\nschool presents, to the speculations of the _idealist_. It will be seen\r\nthat the hasty conclusions of the first gave a sort of basis for the\r\nstrange results to which the second would conduct us.\r\n\r\nKant looked in vain for the idea of extension, or of space, where the\r\nphilosophers had been seeking it, in the phenomena of sensation. He\r\npronounced, therefore, that it was not derivable from experience, did\r\nnot come to us from without, through any direct communication from the\r\nsenses. Not finding this idea of space where the analytical psychologist\r\nhad been searching for it, he drew it at once from the mind itself. He\r\ndescribed it as a product of the _subject_ man, a _form of the\r\nsensibility_ with which he invests his own sensations.\r\n\r\nWe must first remark, that to this description of what perception really\r\nis, there lies the same objection that may be urged against the account\r\nof the sensationalist. A sensation clothed in space!--is this\r\nintelligible? is it by any means an account of the matter? To invest\r\nsensation with space, is it not as if we spoke of a _pleasure_ that was\r\n_square_, or of a _circular pain_?\r\n\r\nSo far, however, as this internal origin of the idea of space is\r\nconcerned, the statement of Kant, though expressed in unusual terms, is\r\nnot opposed to the general belief of mankind, or to our irresistible\r\nconvictions. It may merely convey this meaning, that the mind has an\r\nimmediate knowledge (drawn from the laws of its own cogitation) of\r\nspace, or extension. But then, according to the universal and\r\nunalterable convictions of mankind, this idea of space, though it may be\r\nderived from the innate resources of the mind, is in fact the knowledge\r\nof an external reality--of an _objective_ truth. Kant decided otherwise.\r\nHe pronounced this _form of the sensibility_ to be merely and only a\r\nmode of thought--that space had, in fact, no other existence, was solely\r\na _subjective_ truth.\r\n\r\nThis one decision has been the cause of, or at least has served as the\r\nstarting-point for a series of the wildest speculations that perhaps\r\nphilosophy has to record. And this decision, how arbitrary!--how\r\ndogmatic!\r\n\r\nIt must be manifest, we think, to every intelligent person, that,\r\ngranting we cannot demonstrate the _objective truth_ of the existence of\r\nspace, it is equally impossible to prove its _subjective_ nature. We\r\ncannot conceive of space but as existing really around us. The\r\nmetaphysician says we may be deceived. This universal and irresistible\r\nconviction--this fundamental law of human belief, may not be\r\ncorrespondent with absolute truth, may not be trustworthy. Granted that\r\nwe _may_ be deceived, that there is footing here for his _scepticism_,\r\nhe cannot proceed a step further, and show that we _are_ deceived. When,\r\nin his turn, he would assert, or dogmatise, he at all events is as open\r\nto our scepticism as we were to his. If a fundamental belief of this\r\nkind is not to be trusted, so neither can it be convicted of falsehood.\r\nWe cannot launch ourselves out of our own nature; we _cannot test_ our\r\nown faculties of cognition. This could only be done by some superior\r\nintelligence who could survey apart the object and the percipient\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWe _may be_ deceived in believing that we ourselves exist--that there is\r\nany permanent being we call ourselves--but there is no demonstrating\r\nthat we _are_ so deceived. The two cases are strictly analogous. We have\r\njust the same proof of the existence of the external object as of the\r\nthinking and percipient subject. The very first sensation or perception\r\nwe experience brings with it instantaneously the two correlates, object\r\nand subject; they are made known in the same act or feeling; they are\r\nmade known the one by means of the other--for unless through the means\r\nof the antagonist idea of object we should not have that of subject, nor\r\n_vice versa_. In our judgment, therefore, there is as little philosophy\r\nin denying the external existence of matter as the internal existence of\r\nmind. The two ideas, as we have said, rise instantaneously,\r\nsynchronously, and are in such manner correlates that it is only by the\r\npresence of the one that the other reveals itself.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen Kant advanced from doubting of the _objective_ truth of our\r\nknowledge of space, to deciding against it--to asserting that it was\r\npurely _subjective_--he was exceeding the limits of the human faculties,\r\nand offering a mere dogmatism which can never be brought to any test\r\nwhatever. He was asking us to judge of the trustworthiness of our\r\nfaculties of cognition--by what?--by our faculties of cognition. He was\r\nelevating what is at best a strange suspicion, a mere _guess_, into a\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole superstructure of the systems of idealism which his German\r\nfollowers have reared, rests upon this guess!\r\n\r\nKant left nothing of the material world but an indescribable _noumenon_,\r\nwhich did not even exist in space. Of course the categories of\r\nAristotle, classifying as they did those relations which constitute our\r\nknowledge of this world, were converted by him into mere forms of the\r\n_understanding_, moulding the given products of the _sensibility_.\r\nCertain other regulative modes of thought predominating, in their turn,\r\nover the products of the _understanding_, he called ideas of the _pure\r\nreason_.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Fichte, it will be seen, advanced but little further when\r\nhe pronounced for a system of _idealism_. The subjective nature of our\r\nknowledge had been laid down; there was nothing left of the real world\r\nbut this _noumenon_ which had been ejected from the realm of space; he\r\nacted, therefore, a consistent and charitable part, in taking this\r\nforlorn and banished entity into the region, at least, of thought. All\r\nthe external world is now but a projection from the individual mind--the\r\n_non-ego_ is but another development of the _ego_--the _object_ is\r\nnothing but a sort of limitation or contrast which the subject throws\r\nout, to make a life for itself; the web it spins in the blank\r\ninfinitude. Of the whole material world we have for ever got rid.\r\n\r\nHere it might be supposed that speculation in this direction had reached\r\nits extreme point; and as idealism is a system in which the mind cannot\r\nlong rest, contradicting, as it does, its ineradicable convictions, that\r\nhere would commence a philosophical revolution, and a return to a more\r\nsober and accurate method of investigation. But the German mind has put\r\nforth at this point an astonishing fertility. It has played with this\r\nidealism, refined upon it, varied it, produced new phases of it;\r\nreviving the strangest paradoxes of the Alexandrian school; and\r\nteaching--in this, the nineteenth century--with the gravest confidence\r\nin the world--with all the assurance of an ancient Scald chanting forth\r\nhis mythological fables, a whole system of idealistic cosmogony!\r\n\r\nSchelling, in his idealism, in some measure reinstated the _object_; not\r\nby reviving the vulgar notion of its reality, but declaring it to be in\r\nits essence identical with the _subject_, and pronouncing both to have\r\nan equally real or equally ideal existence. He thus got rid of the\r\nembarrassment which encounters us in the ordinary systems of idealism,\r\nof the subjective _Ego_ producing the objective _Ego_. _Thought_ and\r\n_thing_ are identical. But this identity is to be recognised only in the\r\nmind of God, in the absolute--which develops what in itself is unity in\r\nthe form of a duality. As if (to use a rude illustration) the same image\r\nshould be shot from the interior of a magic lantern through two\r\ndiverging tubes, making that twofold which was itself identical.\r\n\r\nAs it is hard for common apprehension to conceive this _absolute_, and\r\nseize upon this identity of thought and thing, Schelling invented a\r\nfaculty of mind expressly for the comprehension of such profound\r\ndoctrines of philosophy. He called it _intellectual intuition_. Those\r\nwho possess it not--and it is by no means general--must be content to\r\nlive without philosophy. Nor can those on whom nature has failed to\r\nbestow this intellectual intuition, acquire it by any study or industry\r\nof their own. _Philosophus nascitur, non fit_.\r\n\r\nViewed from one aspect, Schelling's philosophy is not without a certain\r\ncharm. \"Spirit is invisible nature, nature is visible spirit.\" In this\r\nview of things, if mind loses its pre-eminence, nature, or the visible\r\nworld, is exalted and spiritualised. It is a system likely to fascinate\r\nthe poet and the artist, and we believe it has had a recognised\r\ninfluence on the cultivation of the fine arts in Germany. It awakens our\r\nenthusiasm for nature. More than ever is mind, is deity, seen in the\r\nvisible world. Nature is, in fact, deified, whatever other sacrifices\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nBut if there was something for enthusiasm to lay hold of in the system\r\nof Schelling, there was much wanting, it seems, to satisfy the rigid\r\ndemands of philosophy. _His_ cosmogony, his manner of tracing, _a\r\npriori_, the development of all things from the absolute, was\r\nconsidered, by those who understand such profundities, to be deficient\r\nin accuracy. Hegel next trod\r\n\r\n          \"with wandering feet\r\n    The dark, unbottomed, infinite abyss.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we are told gravely, by grave expositors, how, beginning with\r\n_nothing_, he showed, with logical precision, how every thing had\r\nregularly proceeded from it!\r\n\r\nIn the system of Hegel, object and subject are both lost sight of:\r\nnothing exists but the relation between them. As the thing and the\r\nthought of it are identical, and as the essence of a thought is the\r\nrelation between two terms, it follows very logically that this relation\r\nis all, and that nothing really exists but relations. We should have\r\nsupposed this to be a fair _reductio ad absurdum_, proving (if the\r\nmatter could need of proof) that the _thing_ and the _thought_ were not\r\nidentical. But the march of ideal philosophy was not to be so easily\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached what is distinguished as _absolute idealism_.\r\n\r\n\"They (the three idealisms) may be thus illustrated,\" (writes Mr Lewes\r\nin his _History of Philosophy_.) \"I see a tree. Fichte tells me that it\r\nis I alone who exist; the tree is a modification of my mind. This is\r\n_subjective_ idealism. Schelling tells me that both the tree and my\r\n_ego_ are existences equally real, or ideal, but they are nothing less\r\nthan manifestations of the absolute. This is _objective_ idealism. But\r\nHegel tells me, that all these explanations are false. The only thing\r\nreally existing is the idea--the relation. The ego and the tree are but\r\ntwo terms of the relation, and owe their reality to it. This is\r\n_absolute_ idealism.\"[7]\r\n\r\nIf Martinus Scriblerus were alive, he also might be tempted to give an\r\nillustration of these three forms of idealism.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of spectators at a fair, he might say, if they see a man\r\ndancing upon the tight-rope, strained between two posts--have no doubt\r\nin the world that the rope, and the man on it, are equally supported by\r\nthe same two posts, which, moreover, they presume to stand up there in\r\nveritable substantiality before them. Were our three sages at the fair,\r\nthey would reason otherwise. Fichte would say--these people think there\r\nare two posts! There is but one. That left-hand post is but the shadow\r\nof the other. It is the right-hand _subjective_ post which has projected\r\nit forth.\r\n\r\nSchelling, gravely looking on, observes they are _both shadows_:\r\nnay, they are identical. If you were to stand in the centre of\r\nthe rope, in the _point of indifference_ between them, and to turn\r\nround till the intellectual intuition were sufficiently excited,\r\nyou would find the right-hand and the left-hand post blended\r\ntogether--undistinguishable--you would perceive their absolute identity.\r\n\r\nShadows! identical! Very true, says Hegel, slowly stepping forward, but\r\nwhat a mistake have both philosophers and the vulgar been making all\r\nthis time! They have presumed that these posts support the rope! It is\r\nthe rope which upholds the posts; which are indeed but its opposite\r\nends. You may see that, separately, each post is good for nothing; it is\r\nthe relation between them that is every thing; the rope is all. This\r\nalone can be said to exist. Every thing about us is plainly at one end\r\nor the other end of this, or some other rope. There runs, he would add,\r\na vulgar tradition that man made the rope. I will demonstrate that the\r\nrope made the man and every thing else in the whole fair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is not our object at present to enter further into the labyrinth\r\nof German metaphysics; at a future time, if our readers should endure\r\nthe subject, we will endeavour to act as guide and interpreter through\r\nsome of its more curious passages; we are here concerned only with the\r\npoints of view taken of the material world. Have we not said enough to\r\nsupport our thesis? to prove what strange results may be arrived at if\r\nphilosopher, following after philosopher, bases his speculations on what\r\nis current in the school-room, instead of recurring to honest and\r\nsimple-minded observations of nature--and to show that on this subject\r\nof _perception_ our veterans Reid and Stewart have taken up the only\r\nsafe position our present knowledge admits of?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] \"Relatives are known only together: the science of contraries is\r\none. Subject and object, mind and matter, are known only in correlation\r\nand contrast, and in the same common act: which knowledge is at once a\r\nsynthesis and an antithesis of both, and may be indifferently defined an\r\nantithetic synthesis and a synthetic antithesis of the terms. Every\r\nconception of _self_ necessarily implies a conception of _not self_;\r\nevery perception of what is different from me, implies a recognition of\r\nthe percipient subject in contradistinction from the object perceived.\r\nIn one object of knowledge, indeed, the object is the prominent element,\r\nin another the subject; but there is none in which either is known out\r\nof relation to the other. The immediate knowledge which Reid allows of\r\nthings different from the mind, and the immediate knowledge of mind\r\nitself, cannot, therefore, be split into two distinct acts. In\r\nperception, as in other faculties, the same indivisible consciousness is\r\nconversant about both terms of the relation of knowledge.\"--_Edinburgh\r\nReview_, No. 103, p. 165.--A very able and elaborate paper, attributed\r\nto Sir William Hamilton.\r\n\r\n[7] _Lewes' Biographical History of Philosophy._ Vol. iv., p. 209. In\r\nevery way a remarkable work. Written with great vivacity and clearness,\r\ncomprising a world of matter in the briefest possible space,--and, O\r\nreader, and O author, forgive the anticlimax!--at the least possible\r\ncost. In fact it forms part of the Series known as \"_Knight's Weekly\r\nVolume_.\" To find a strictly original work of so much ability given to\r\nthe world in this form, proves that the publisher and the man of letters\r\nare, in this mercantile age, second to none in the activity and\r\nenterprise with which they render _their_ service to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DE BERNARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of French novels and novelists in the appreciation of the\r\nEnglish public, has undergone, within the last few years, a notable\r\nchange. We need revert to no distant period to recall the day when the\r\nword \"Paris\" on the title-page of a book of fiction, was, to the work so\r\ninscribed, virtual sentence of exclusion from respectable library and\r\ndecent drawing-room this side the Channel. It was the foul-bill of\r\nhealth, the signal of a moral quarantine, interminable and hopeless of\r\npratique. French novels came to England and were read; but the arrivals\r\nwere comparatively rare, the readers scarce more numerous; whilst by the\r\nmasses they were condemned as contraband and dangerous merchandise, and\r\neschewed as religiously as Lyons silks by the humane, when Spitalfields\r\nare starving. The wilful and wicked minority who took pleasure in their\r\npungent pages, did so clandestinely, and with precaution. In\r\ncarefully-locked desk, or on topmost shelf of bookcase, lurking behind\r\nan honourable front-rank of history and essay, the disreputable\r\nliterature was bestowed. Nor was its reception more openly hospitable\r\nwhen arrayed in English garb. Translators there were, who strove to\r\nrender into the manly, wholesome Anglo-Saxon tongue, the produce--witty,\r\nfrivolous, prurient, and amusing--of Gallic imagination. But either the\r\ntranslations shared the interdict incurred by the objectionable\r\noriginals, or the plan adopted to obtain their partial acceptance,\r\ndestroyed pith and point. Letters from plague-ridden shores are fitted\r\nfor the perusal of the uninfected by fumigation and other mysterious\r\nprocesses. They reach us reeking with aromatics and defaced by\r\nperforations, intended doubtless to favour the escape of the demon of\r\npestilence bodily imprisoned within their folds. But their written\r\ncontents are uninjured by the salutary operation; the words of\r\naffection, the combinations of commerce, the politician's plans, are\r\nstill to be read upon their stained and punctured surface. Not so with\r\nthe French novels that underwent fumigation and curtailment at the hands\r\nof decorous translators. The knife that extirpated the gangrene,\r\nunavoidably trenched upon the healthy flesh: in rooting up the abundant\r\ntares, the scanty grain was shaken out, and chaff and straw alone\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nWe speak of times past, although still recent; glance we at the present,\r\nand, Heaven help us! what a change is here! Tempora mutantur et\r\n_libri_--or it were perhaps more proper to say, _et lectores_. With\r\nheadlong velocity, one extreme has been abandoned for its opposite. The\r\ndenounced of yesterday is the favoured of to-day; the scouted is now the\r\ncherished; the rejected stone has a lofty place in the literary edifice.\r\nFrench novels, translated, if not original, are as commonly seen in the\r\n\"best regulated families\" as comfits at the confectioner's or poison on\r\npotter-carriers' shelves. The ban is removed, the anathema revoked;\r\neither the Upas has been discovered to be less baneful than was\r\nimagined, or the disease lurking at the core has been forgotten in the\r\nbright colours and pleasant flavour of the appetible fruit. We take up\r\nthe newspaper. What heads the column? Half a score advertisements of the\r\n\"Mysteries of Paris\"--a new edition of the \"Wandering Jew,\" \"illustrated\r\nby the first artists\"--\"Memoirs of a Physician,\" in twopenny numbers and\r\nshilling volumes; French novels, in short, at all prices and in every\r\nform. We step into the club; the produce of Paris and Brussels presses\r\nstrews the table, and an elderly gentleman, with a solemn face and\r\nquakerish coat, searches amongst them for the nine-and-twentieth volume\r\nof \"Monte Christo,\" or of some other French romance of longitude equally\r\nsea-serpentine. We call upon our friend Tom Sterling, a worthy fellow,\r\nmuch respected on 'Change. Miss Sterling is deep in a natty duodecimo,\r\nwhose Flemish aspect speaks volumes in favour of international\r\ncopyright. Our natural clearsightedness enables us to read, even from\r\nthe door, \"Societe Belge de Librairie\" upon its buff paper cover. Is the\r\nbook hastily smuggled under sofa-cushions, or stealthily dropped into\r\nthe neglected work-basket? By no means. The fair student deliberately\r\nmarks her place, and engages us in a controversy as to the merits,\r\nfaults, and beauties of a score of French romancists, in whose\r\nlucubrations she assuredly is far better read than ourselves. In short,\r\nEnglish aversion for French modern literature has disappeared, and been\r\nreplaced by partiality--not to say affection. Dumas is a staple\r\ncommodity; Sue is voted delightful; English authors of talent and\r\nstanding translate or \"edite\"--to use the genteel word now adopted--the\r\nworks of French ones; even George Sand finds lady-translators, and, we\r\nfear, lady readers; French books are reprinted in London, and the Palais\r\nRoyal is transported to the arcade of Burlington. We shall not take upon\r\nourselves to blame or applaud this change in public taste, to decide how\r\nfar such large importation and extensive patronage of foreign wares are\r\nadvantageous or deplorable--to tax with laxity those who write, or with\r\nlevity those who read, the lively and palatable productions of the\r\npresent French school. Without encouraging, we will venture to direct,\r\nthe prevailing appetite, by pointing the attention of Maga's\r\nreaders--whose name is Legion--to the writings of an author not the best\r\nknown, but certainly one of the most accomplished, of his class. In\r\nFrance, his reputation stands very high; and if in England it is not yet\r\nequally well-established, it must be attributed to his having written\r\nlittle, and to the absence of that charlatanry and egotism which has\r\nbrought other cultivators of the Belles Lettres into such universal\r\nnotice here and on the Continent. M. Dumas, for instance, even had his\r\nwritings, and those of the numerous staff of literary aid-de-camps to\r\nwhose bairns he stands godfather, been less diverting, would still have\r\ncommanded readers in every country where French is understood, and which\r\nthe post from Paris reaches. The man is his own advertisement; his\r\neccentricities are worth, at a moderate estimate, a dozen advertising\r\nvans, a daily paragraph in a score of newspapers, and a cartload of\r\nposters. He is a practical puff, an incarnate stimulant to popular\r\ncuriosity. Let the public appetite for his weekly volumes flag ever so\r\nlittle, and forthwith he puts in practice, for the renewal of his vogue,\r\ndevices so ingenious, that proceeding from any but the privileged\r\nmonarch of romance-writers, they would be looked upon as the tricks of a\r\nlunatic. One day in a court of assizes, the next at that of a king, on\r\nthe morrow before a civil tribunal, the illustrious inheritor of the\r\nmarquisate of La Pailleterie parades his graces, jogs the world's memory\r\nas to the fact of his existence, and bids it read his books and bow\r\nbefore his footstool. To-day he is on the Corso, to-morrow on the sunny\r\nbanks of Rhine; the next day he peeps into Etna's crater, or gasps\r\nbeneath the brazen sky of shadeless Syria. Now we hear of him in Spanish\r\npalaces, figuring at royal weddings, and adding one more to the\r\ncountless ribbon-ends that already grace his button-hole; and scarcely\r\nhas our admiration subsided, when a Mediterranean breeze murmurs sweet\r\ntidings of his presence on African shores, taking his coffee with Beys,\r\ncommanding war-steamers, riving the captive's fetters, and rivetting his\r\nclaims on his country's gratitude. Wherever he goes, he stands, a modern\r\nGulliver, pre-eminent in moral giantship, amidst surrounding pigmies,\r\nwho\r\n\r\n     \"Walk under his huge legs, and peep about To find themselves\r\n     dishonourable graves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the seeming ubiquity of the famous quadroon[8] is not more\r\nmarvellous than the multiplicity of characters he assumes. \"Dumas at\r\nHome and Abroad\" offers an inexhaustible theme and a boundless field for\r\npen and pencil caricaturists. Alternately dramatist, novelist, tourist,\r\nambassador, the companion of princes, the manager of theatres, an\r\nauthority in courts of justice, a challenger of deputies, and shining\r\nwith equal lustre in these and fifty other capacities equally diverse,\r\nwhat wonder that the slightest work flowing from the pen of so\r\nremarkable a genius, though it be but a forgotten \"trifle of twelve\r\nthousand lines,\" is received with intense gratitude, and caught at like\r\nmanna by a famished multitude? Eugene Sue is another writer who has\r\ntaken the world by storm, but in quite a different fashion. The\r\nex-lieutenant of marine does not obtrude his personality upon public\r\nnotice, and relies more upon the powerful calibre of his guns than upon\r\ntheir number. Two books, lengthy ones certainly, established his\r\nreputation. He had been many years a cultivator of literature, and had\r\nproduced sundry romances of little more than average merit, when he\r\nsuddenly burst upon the public, in the widely spread _feuilleton_ of the\r\n_Debats_, with a work which, however objectionable in some respects, is\r\nunquestionably of extraordinary power and interest. Like the Pickwick\r\nPapers, the \"Mysteres de Paris\" at once established their author in\r\npopular estimation, not only in the land in whose language they were\r\nwritten, but in all the reading countries of Europe. It was the opening\r\nof a new vein in the literary mine, and though the metal might have been\r\npurer, it had all the glitter that captivates the multitude. The \"Juif\r\nErrant,\" inferior to its predecessor, was scarcely less successful. Its\r\nbitter attacks on the Jesuits, and the consequent anathemas fulminated\r\nagainst it, with more zeal than wisdom, by certain of the French clergy,\r\ndoubtless contributed to its vogue. After Sue and Dumas, Balzac is (with\r\nthe exception, perhaps, of Madame Dudevant,) the best known, and most\r\nread, out of France, of all the living French novelists. We hold him\r\nmuch over-rated, but his great fertility, and the real excellence of a\r\nfew of his books, have made him a widely-spread reputation. His early\r\nefforts were less successful than those of Sue; and his first thirty\r\nvolumes scarcely attained mediocrity. At last he made a start, and took\r\nhis place on the first line of his class, in virtue of a few\r\nmasterpieces, scanty diamonds glittering in a cinder-heap.\r\nOver-production, the crying vice of the literature of the day, and an\r\nover-weening conceit, prevented Honore de Balzac from maintaining the\r\nposition he might and ought to have occupied. Such gems as the \"Pere\r\nGoriot\" and \"Eugenie Grandet\" were buried and lost sight of under\r\nmountains of rubbish. True that he now denied a number of books\r\npublished under supposititious names, and which had been universally\r\nattributed to him; but enough remained, which he could not deny, to\r\ntarnish, if not to cancel his fame. To these he has since, with the\r\nreckless and inconsiderate greed that cares not for the public, so long\r\nas it finds a publisher, considerably added. His self-sufficiency is\r\nunparalleled; and in the preface to an edition of his works published\r\nunder the comprehensive and presumptuous title of \"La Comedie Humaine,\"\r\nhe puts himself on a level with the first of poets and philosophers,\r\nproposing himself the modest aim of portraying human nature in every\r\nvariety of its moral physiognomy.\r\n\r\nLess prolific, more unassuming, and far less universally known than the\r\nthree authors at whose character and writings we have thus briefly\r\nglanced, Charles de Bernard need fear comparison with none of them. That\r\nhe is faultless we do not assert; that he in great measure eschews the\r\nerrors of his contemporaries, will be patent to all who peruse his\r\npages. The objections that English readers will make to his books are to\r\nbe traced to no aberrations of his, but to those of the society whose\r\nfollies he so ably and wittily depicts. He faithfully sketches, and more\r\noften amusingly caricatures, the vices, foibles, and failings of French\r\nmen and women. If those are to be delineated at all--and, with a view to\r\ntheir amendment, surely they may--the task could hardly be executed with\r\na chaster and less offensive pencil. De Bernard paints immorality--it\r\nwould be unjust to say that he encourages it. He neither deals in\r\nhighly-coloured and meretricious scenes _a la_ Sue and Dumas; nor\r\nsupports, with the diabolical talent and ingenuity of a Sand, the most\r\nsubversive and anti-social doctrines. His works are not befouled with\r\nfilth and obscenity, such as that impure old reprobate Paul de Kock\r\ndelights and wallows in--or disgraced by the irreligion, and contempt of\r\nthings holy, found in the writings of scores of French authors whom we\r\ncould name, were they worth the naming. It is undeniable that the\r\ningenious plots of his very entertaining books turn, for the most part,\r\non matters difficult to touch upon with propriety, and which English\r\nwriters usually avoid; frequently, for instance, on illicit passion and\r\nconjugal infidelity. And therefore many Englishmen, with whatever\r\ninterest and amusement they themselves might read his volumes, would\r\nhesitate to recommend them to their sisters and daughters. Some few of\r\nhis tales, especially of the shorter ones, are in all respects\r\nunexceptionable. We instance \"La Peau du Lion,\" translated as \"The\r\nCossack's Grave;\" and \"L'Anneau d'Argent,\" which has also appeared in\r\nEnglish. Gerfaut, one of this author's earliest works, and\r\nunquestionably his masterpiece, has little that can justly offend,\r\nalthough its translation met, we believe, a cold reception. The plot\r\nturns on an attachment between a married woman and the hero of the\r\nstory. But if M. de Bernard falls readily enough into the easy,\r\nmatter-of-course tone in which his countrymen habitually discuss amatory\r\npeccadilloes--and he could hardly have attained his present popularity\r\nin France had he assumed the prude--he does not disdain or neglect to\r\npoint a moral after his own fashion. In administering a remedy, a wise\r\nphysician has regard to the idiosyncrasy of the patient as well as to\r\nthe nature of the disease. A nation whose morality is unhealthy, must\r\nnot be treated like a sick horse, whose groom crams a ball down his\r\nthroat, and holds his jaws together, and his head back, to prevent its\r\nrejection. The dose must be artfully disguised, wrapped in a sweetmeat,\r\nand the invalid will take it kindly, and sooner or later feel the\r\nbenefit. We would fain discern, in some of M. de Bernard's books, under\r\na perfumed envelope of palatable trifle, a tendency worthy of applause;\r\na design to combat, by quiet and implied ridicule, the moral maladies of\r\nhis country. It is not his wont, as with many of his competitors, to\r\nmake the vicious interesting and the virtuous fools. His husbands are\r\nnot invariably good-natured, helpless noodles, with whom, even in their\r\ndirest calamities, the most right-thinking have difficulty to\r\nsympathise: the Lovelaces who pursue married women with their insidious\r\nand dangerous attentions, are not by him for ever exalted into heroes,\r\nredeeming their pleasant vices by a host of high and chivalrous\r\nqualities. On the contrary, the apparently easy-going husband often\r\nproves a smart fellow, and thorough Tartar--the brilliant lover an\r\nemancipated bagman, or contemptible _chevalier d'industrie_. Of this we\r\nhave an example in \"Le Gendre,\" in some respects one of the most\r\nobjectionable of De Bernard's novels, certainly not well suited for a\r\nbirth-day present to misses in their teens. A seemingly tame, insipid\r\nclown of a husband counteracts the base manoeuvres of a dashing Paris\r\n_roue_; and finally, after refusing to fight the would-be seducer, whom\r\nhe has ascertained to be an arrant swindler, takes truncheon in hand,\r\nand belabours him in presence of his intended victim and of a roomful of\r\ncompany. But setting aside any moral tendency which goodwill towards\r\nsuch a vastly pleasant author as De Bernard may induce us, by the aid of\r\nour most complaisant spectacles, to discover in his writings, his\r\ngentlemanly tone is undeniable, his pictures of French life, especially\r\nin Paris, are beyond praise. In the most natural and graphic style\r\nimaginable, he dashes off a portrait typifying a class, and in a page\r\ngives the value of a volume of the much-vaunted \"Physiologies.\" And this\r\nhe does, like all he does, in a sparkling, well-bred, impertinent style,\r\npeculiar to himself, and peculiarly attractive.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked, that M. de Bernard has written little. The\r\nassertion was comparative; we meant that he has produced, since the\r\ncommencement of his literary career--not yet very remote--an average of\r\nonly three or four volumes per year. This rate, in days when French\r\nscribes carry on five romances at a time, in the daily feuilletons of\r\nfive newspapers, and when certain English authors, emulous of Gallic\r\nfecundity, annually conceive and elaborate their dozen or two of\r\noctavos--says little for his industry, or much for his judicious\r\nforbearance. Latterly, however, we regret to observe in him a\r\ndisposition to increase the length of his books, and abandon the\r\npleasant one, two, and three volume tales with which he began. In this\r\nhe is wrong; books of so very light a description as his will not bear\r\ngreat prolongation. Things agreeable enough in small quantities, pall\r\nand cloy if the ration be overmuch augmented. However fragrant and\r\nwell-spiced, syllabub is not to be drunk by the bucketful; neither would\r\nit be satisfactory to dine off a _souffle au marasquin_, though\r\ncompounded by the philanthropical Regenerator himself. In England,\r\ncustom has decided that three volumes are the proper length for a novel,\r\nand they have become, as a maximum, a rule rarely departed from. We are\r\ncontent that it should be so, and, indeed, heartily rejoice at it, when\r\nwe see works of fiction spun out by indefatigable French manufacturers\r\ninto interminable series, through which, at twelve hours a-day, the most\r\ninsatiable devourer of the romantic needs a month to toil. Following the\r\nfashion of the times, and encouraged by the example of his successfully\r\ndiffuse brethren, M. de Bernard, weary of launching trim corvettes and\r\ndashing frigates, has taken to build line-of-battle ships. He had better\r\nhave kept to the small craft, which he found to float so well. Two of\r\nhis recent works, \"Le Beaupere,\" and \"Le Gentilhomme Campagnard,\" have\r\nlost in merit what they have gained in length. The subject of the former\r\nis most unpleasant: its catastrophe unnecessarily painful. And the\r\n\"Gentilhomme Campagnard,\" just now concluded, although containing, as do\r\nall his books, much spirited dialogue, many well-drawn characters, and\r\nwell-contrived incidents, is weakened by being spun out, and at times,\r\nby its tediousness of detail, reminds us of De Balzac. And here we will\r\nremark, that there is a certain general resemblance between the styles\r\nof De Bernard and De Balzac; so much so, that when the former first\r\nwrote, some persons conjectured his name to be a pseudonyme adopted by\r\nthe latter, to the detriment of publishers, to whom, it was said, he had\r\ncontracted to deliver all he should produce. And the malignant hinted,\r\nthat the author of \"Eugenie Grandet\" was sufficiently unscrupulous and\r\nhungry of gain to render such a stratagem on his part any thing but\r\nimprobable. Whether Charles de Bernard be an assumed name or not, it has\r\nlong since been evident, that the books published under it proceed from\r\na more guarded and uniformly sprightly pen, than that of M. de Balzac.\r\n\r\nThe plot of the \"Gentilhomme Campagnard,\" is based on the dissensions of\r\ntwo villages, or more properly speaking, of a hamlet and a very small\r\ntown, situated within a mile of each other, and which had once\r\nconstituted two separate parishes, but had been amalgamated at the\r\nrevolution of '89, greatly to the detriment and indignation of the\r\nweaker party. It is in 1836 that M. de Bernard takes up the\r\nimaginary history of their jealousy and squabbles, as a canvass\r\non which to embroider the flowers of his invention. The hamlet,\r\nChateaugiron-le-Vieil, is inhabited, and virtually governed, by the\r\nGentilhomme Campagnard, the Baron de Vaudrey--a retired colonel of\r\ncuirassiers, whose services under the empire do not prevent his stanch\r\nadherence, under the citizen monarchy of July, to the legitimate and\r\nexiled sovereigns of France. His nephew, the Marquis of Chateaugiron,\r\nless addicted to the fallen Bourbons, arrives, at the opening of the\r\ntale, at his family mansion in Chateaugiron-le-Bourg, with certain\r\nelectioneering projects, highly displeasing to the baron, who resolves\r\nvigorously to oppose them, and accordingly gives the whole weight of his\r\ninfluence to a neighbouring iron-master, M. Grandperrin, also a\r\ncandidate. The iron-master has married a second wife, a heartless\r\nvindictive woman, and former mistress of the marquis. She plays an\r\nimportant part in the clever plot, which, although complicated, is\r\nperfectly clear. To sketch at any length even the principal of the\r\nnumerous characters in the amusing comedy, would lead us much too far;\r\nwe can barely afford to glance at a few of them. On the foremost\r\nline--after the Gentilhomme Campagnard himself, a fine, generous-hearted\r\nveteran, an excellent compound of the soldier and the nobleman,\r\npossessed of great good sense and shrewdness, and altogether one of\r\nthose personages of whom, whether real or imaginary, one reads with\r\npleasure--stands Madame Bonvalot, or _de_ Bonvalot, as she best loves to\r\nbe styled, the _parvenue_ widow of a Bordeaux wine merchant. Her\r\nbeautiful and amiable daughter, an excellent model of a virtuous French\r\nlady, gracefully and delicately drawn, is married to the Marquis of\r\nChateaugiron. The mother, an affected, frivolous, rouged, bejewelled\r\ndowager of fifty, who, through ambition to figure at the Tuileries, has\r\nextorted from her noble son-in-law a promise that he will adhere to the\r\nnew order of things, is followed from Paris by one Pichot, ex-clerk to a\r\nnotary, also a former lover of Madame Grandperrin, and self-styled\r\nViscount de Langerac. This fortune-hunter has managed to worm himself\r\ninto the intimacy of the marquis, and to kindle, in the too-susceptible\r\nbreast of Madame Bouvalot, a tender flame, which he diligently fans.\r\nThen we have a young country-lawyer, Froidevaux, an honest, independent\r\nfellow, and desperate sportsman, who gives advice gratis, thinks more of\r\npartridges than parchments, prefers a day's shooting to a profitable\r\nlawsuit, and is consequently as poor as he is popular, and, to all\r\nappearance, has very little chance of obtaining the hand of Mademoiselle\r\nVictorine, the iron-master's only daughter and heiress, a plump little\r\nbeauty, who views Froidevaux with special favour and affection, and with\r\nwhom he is deeply in love. Amongst the personages of a lower class, the\r\nmost prominent is Toussaint Gilles, landlord of the Cheval Patriote, and\r\nson of one of the revolutionary butchers of the Reign of Terror; a\r\nfurious republican, who wears a _carmagnole_ and a red cap, inherits his\r\nfather's hatred of the vile aristocrats, and prides himself on his\r\nprinciples, and on a truculent and immeasurable mustache. Amoudru, a\r\npusillanimous mayor; Bobilier, a fiery old justice of the peace, and\r\ndevoted vassal of the house of Chateaugiron; and Rabusson, once a\r\nsergeant in M. de Vaudrey's regiment, now his game-keeper, must not be\r\nforgotten. A festival got up by Bobilier to celebrate the marquis's\r\narrival at the castle of his ancestors, stirs the bile of Toussaint\r\nGilles, who sees in it a base adulation of the _ci-devants_. As\r\npresident of the republican club of Chateaugiron-le-Bourg, he, on the\r\nfollowing day, incites a few discontented spirits to a popular\r\ndemonstration, to consist in burning down the triumphal arch erected by\r\nthe servile justice of peace, and in hoisting a brand-new tricolored\r\nflag on the tree of liberty--a poplar planted, during the glorious days\r\nof July, close to the gate of the marquis's chateau, but which had long\r\nsince withered into a dry and unsightly maypole. A number of bad\r\ncharacters mingle in the crowd, and the demonstration assumes a more\r\nturbulent and criminal aspect than its original promoters had\r\ncontemplated. The outer gate of the chateau is forced, and stones are\r\nthrown, one of which grazes the cheek of the Viscount de Langerac, who\r\nreceives the wound, so he affirms, whilst heroically interposing his\r\nperson between Madame de Bonvalot and the shower of missiles. At last\r\nthe marquis arms his servants, and repels the rioters, already\r\nfrightened at their own deeds; the justice of peace menaces them with\r\nthe assizes, Froidevaux exerts his influence, and the disturbance is\r\nnearly at an end, when the flames communicate from the triumphal arch to\r\nthe tree of liberty. Toussaint Gilles, as captain of the firemen,\r\nhurries to extinguish the conflagration that menaces the flag-staff, on\r\nwhose summit Picardet the blacksmith, another zealous member of the\r\ndemocratic club, is busy fastening the tricolored symbol of freedom. The\r\nfollowing scene, one of the most detachable in the book, will give a\r\nnotion of M. de Bernard's lively and pointed style.\r\n\r\n\"The by-standers, whether firemen or not, hurried after the captain to a\r\nshed adjoining the Town-hall. Some of them harnessed themselves to the\r\nengine, and dragged it at full speed to the scene of the fire; others\r\nseized the buckets, and hastened to fill them; soon a line was formed\r\nfrom the well to the burning tree. Quickly as this was done, the\r\nprogress of the flames was still more rapid, and Picardet soon found his\r\npost untenable. On first perceiving the fire, the smith had climbed,\r\nlike a frightened cat, to the very top of the poplar, at risk of\r\nbreaking the tapering stem by the weight of his body; but the refuge was\r\na very precarious one, for the fire followed him, and he required wings\r\nto rise higher than the place he had attained. Three expedients offered\r\nthemselves to him; all equally unpleasant. To leap from the poplar--he\r\nwould inevitably break his neck; to slide down the blazing trunk--he\r\nwould reach the ground roasted; to wait till assistance reached\r\nhim--would it arrive in time? If not immediate, the tree would be on\r\nfire from bottom to top.\r\n\r\n\"Under such circumstances, the most intrepid might well hesitate, and\r\nPicardet, although naturally brave, remained for a moment undecided; but\r\nwhen he saw the flag catch fire close to his feet, he understood that\r\ndelay was mortal, and heroically made up his mind. Relaxing his hold, he\r\nglided with lightning velocity from top to bottom of the tree.\r\n\r\n\"At the very moment that the smith, blinded and suffocated by the smoke,\r\nhis hair blazing like the tail of a comet, his hands bleeding, and his\r\nclothes torn, rolled upon the ground, roaring with pain, a stream of\r\nwater, issuing from the engine, and directed by Toussaint Gilles,\r\ninundated him from head to foot, time enough to save a part of his\r\nsinged locks.\r\n\r\n\"'Now that Picardet is put out,' cried the captain of the firemen, 'save\r\nthe tree of liberty! Come, men! Steady, and with a will!'\r\n\r\n\"As he spoke, Toussaint Gilles levelled the flexible hose at the poplar,\r\nand his assistants pumped vigorously; but before a single drop of water\r\nhad reached its destination, the firemen saw, with surprise and alarm,\r\nthe engine rise under their hands, and fall heavily on one side,\r\ndeluging their legs with the whole of its contents. All eyes fixed\r\nthemselves in astonishment on M. de Vaudrey, who had fallen amongst them\r\nlike a bomb, and whose herculean strength had just performed this feat.\r\nThe country gentleman was perfectly calm, but his complexion was high,\r\nand his brow moist with perspiration, as if he had walked very fast. A\r\nfew paces in his rear stood the faithful Rabusson, motionless and in a\r\nmartial attitude; in one hand he grasped a knotted stick, more like a\r\nmace than a walking-cane; with the other he led Sultan, the baron's\r\nenormous watch-dog.\r\n\r\n\"The stupified silence that ensued was at last broken by Toussaint\r\nGilles.\r\n\r\n\"'What means this?' he demanded, his voice trembling with rage.\r\n\r\n\"'It is easy to understand,' coolly replied M. de Vaudrey.\r\n\r\n\"'Why have you upset our pump?'\r\n\r\n\"'To prevent your pumping.'\r\n\r\n\"'And why do you prevent our pumping?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because those who lighted the fire shall not put it out. It pleased\r\nyou to see yonder wooden columns burn, it pleases me to see the poplar\r\nblaze.'\r\n\r\n\"'Raise the pump,' said the captain to his men, with an imperious air.\r\n'We will see who dares upset it again.'\r\n\r\n\"'And we will see who dares raise it, when I forbid!' retorted the\r\nbaron, calmly folding his muscular arms across his vast chest.\r\n\r\n\"A murmur was heard; but nobody stirred.\r\n\r\n\"'Cowards!' cried Toussaint Gilles, with a furious glance at his\r\nfriends; 'are you all afraid of one man?'\r\n\r\n\"'In the first place, there are two of them,' said the prudent Laverdun\r\nto his neighbour, 'and two who are worth ten; to say nothing of their\r\nmonster of a dog, who demolishes a wolf with a single bite.'\r\n\r\n\"'M. Toussaint Gilles,' said the baron, smiling ironically, 'when an\r\nofficer gives an order, and is not obeyed, do you know what he should\r\ndo?'\r\n\r\n\"'I want none of your advice,' cried the captain of firemen, in a brutal\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"'He should execute his order himself,' said M. de Vaudrey with\r\nimmovable calmness.\r\n\r\n\"'So I will,' said Toussaint Gilles, advancing roughly. But at the very\r\nmoment that he stooped to raise the engine, the baron grasped his\r\ncollar, and compelled him to stand upright.\r\n\r\n\"'M. Toussaint Gilles,' he said, 'listen to me. You are a bad fellow,\r\nneeding correction, and I undertake to correct you.'\r\n\r\n\"'To correct me!' cried the captain, struggling, as ineffectually as a\r\nhare in the clutches of an eagle, in the powerful grasp that restrained\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"'He is strangling the captain! Help the captain!' exclaimed several of\r\nthe spectators.\r\n\r\n\"But words were all the help they offered to their chief, so greatly\r\nwere the boldest awed by the colossal figure and well-known strength and\r\ncourage of the old officer. Gautherot the butcher, constitutionally\r\nbrave and pugnacious, was the only one who went to his friend's\r\nassistance. He rushed upon M. de Vaudrey, when Rabusson barred his\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\"'One to one,' said the sergeant; 'if you want a thrashing, here am I.'\r\n\r\n\"'You've a dog, and a cudgel,' replied the butcher; 'I have only my\r\nfists.'\r\n\r\n\"'True.'\r\n\r\n\"With a generosity bordering on imprudence, Rabusson placed his heavy\r\nstick in the dog's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"'Keep that, Sultan,' said he imperatively, 'and don't stir.' Then\r\nturning to the butcher with an air of defiance--\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' he said, 'are you ready?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ready,' replied Gautherot, putting himself on guard, with the\r\nsteadiness of an experienced boxer.\r\n\r\n\"The circle which had formed round the baron and the captain, enlarged\r\nitself to leave space for the new antagonists. After a few preliminary\r\nevolutions, Gautherot assumed the offensive.\r\n\r\n\"'Guard that,' he cried, dealing his adversary a blow that would have\r\nfloored an ox. Rabusson guarded it with his left arm, and repaid it with\r\nsuch a smashing hit in the face, that the bold butcher rolled upon the\r\nground, blood gushing from his nose and mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Although Gautherot had numerous friends amongst the rioters, and\r\nalthough he was then in some sort their champion, a roar of laughter\r\naccompanied his overthrow, and all eyes were fixed admiringly upon the\r\nconqueror. Popular favour, ever ready to abandon a falling hero, is\r\nrarely withheld from him who triumphs.\r\n\r\n\"At this moment an unexpected incident increased the confusion of the\r\nstormy scene. Excited by the shouts of the mob, and by the fight he had\r\nwitnessed, Sultan forgot his orders, dropped the club confided to his\r\ncare, and without a bark or other notification of his intentions, sprang\r\nfuriously upon the person nearest him. This unlucky individual chanced\r\nto be Laverdun the grocer.\r\n\r\n\"Under any circumstances, the honourable vice-president of the\r\nChateaugiron club would have been utterly unable to contend against a\r\ndog as big as a lion, and almost as formidable; but on this occasion,\r\nattacked without warning, and petrified by fear, he did not even attempt\r\nresistance. The consequence was, that in less than a second he lay upon\r\nthe ground, pale as death, and half strangled, by the side of his friend\r\nGautherot, who, stunned by his fall, made no attempt to rise.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst this occurred, M. de Vaudrey addressed the following admonition\r\nto Captain Toussaint Gilles, who strove in vain to escape from his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"'I well know, Mr Innkeeper, that you have long been in the habit of\r\nspeaking against me and my nephew, and hitherto I have treated your\r\ninsolence with the contempt it merited. But though I care nothing for\r\nyour bark, I shall not allow you to bite. Bear this in mind: to-day I\r\npardon you, but if you value your mustaches and your ears, don't begin\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\n\"So saying, M. de Vaudrey destroyed, by an irresistible shock, the\r\nequilibrium of Toussaint Gilles, and hurled him to the ground to keep\r\ncompany with Gautherot and Laverdun.\r\n\r\n\"Of the five principal members of the club, three were thus humbled to\r\nthe dust; the fourth, singed like a fowl in preparation for the spit,\r\nwas in no condition to show fight; Vermot, the turbulent clerk of the\r\njustice of peace, who completed this political quintet, had long since\r\nabandoned the field of battle. On beholding the discomfiture of their\r\nleaders, the rioters stared at each other with a disconcerted air.\r\n\r\n\"'_Messieurs les bourgeois de Chateaugiron_,' said Monsieur de Vaudrey,\r\nlooking round at the crowd with a mixture of calm assurance and ironical\r\ncontempt--'I thank you, in my nephew's name, for having burned the\r\nabsurd tree which obstructed the entrance to his chateau; you planted\r\nit, and it was for you to destroy it.'\r\n\r\n\"'It was not done on purpose,' said a bystander, with great _naivete_.\r\n\r\n\"'We will plant another,' cried a voice from the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"'In the same place?' asked the baron.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, in the same place,' replied the voice.\r\n\r\n\"'Then I beg to be invited to the ceremony,' said M. de Vaudrey, with\r\nimperturbable phlegm; 'some of you seem to have very confused notions\r\nwith regard to other people's property, and I undertake to complete your\r\neducation.'\r\n\r\n\"At that moment the poplar, into whose heart the flames had eaten, gave\r\na loud crack, quivered above the heads of the startled crowd, and broke\r\nin the middle. The lower half remained erect, whilst the upper portion\r\nfell blazing upon the ruins of the triumphal arch, as, in a duel, a\r\ndesperately wounded combatant falls expiring upon the body of his slain\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\n\"Toussaint Gilles, Gautherot, and Laverdun had all risen from their\r\nrecumbent attitude, but none of them showed a disposition to recommence\r\nthe engagement. The butcher wiped his bleeding muzzle with a cotton\r\nhandkerchief, and seemed to count, with the end of his tongue, how many\r\nteeth he had left; the grocer, pale as his own tallow candles, examined\r\nhis throat with a trembling hand, to make sure that the fangs of the\r\nterrible Sultan had not penetrated beyond the cravat; finally, the\r\nCaptain gnawed his mustache, but dared not manifest his fury otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThis energetic interference of the baron and his two aid-de-camps, biped\r\nand quadruped, and the fall of the tree of liberty, which the rioters,\r\nsuperstitious in spite of their republicanism, look upon as a bad omen,\r\nput an end to the disturbance. The disaffected disperse, and M. de\r\nVaudrey enters his nephew's house, where an amusing scene occurs between\r\nhim and Madame de Bonvalot. Then come a robbery and a fire, and\r\nabundance of incidents--some tolerably new in conception, all very\r\npleasant in narration. The good sense, perspicacity and straightforward\r\ndealing of the baron, subjugate every one. He unmasks the fictitious\r\nviscount, cures his nephew of his electioneering ambition, and the\r\npainted dowager of her longing for an invite to the Tuileries; and\r\nadopts Froidevaux--whose father had saved his life at Leipsic, and who\r\nhas himself picked the baron out of a burning house--as his son and\r\nheir, thus rendering him a suitable husband for the pretty Victorine.\r\nThe story ends, as all proper-behaved novels should end, with the\r\ndiscomfiture of the wicked, and a prospect of many years of happiness\r\nfor the virtuous. In this agreeable perspective, Madame de Bonvalot is a\r\nsharer. Having, by the adoption of Froidevaux, alienated the greater\r\npart of his fortune from his nephew's children, the baron is resolved to\r\nsecure them the reversion of their grandmother's ample jointure. But\r\nMadame de Bonvalot, whose wrinkles are hidden by her rouge, forgets the\r\nhalf century that has passed over her head, and hankers after matrimony.\r\nTo preserve her from it, M. de Vaudrey commences a course of delicate\r\nattentions, sufficiently marked to prevent her favouring other admirers,\r\nbut duly regulated by thermometer, and warranted never to rise to\r\nmarrying point. And the fall of the curtain leaves the humorous old\r\nsoldier of fifty-five and the vain coquette of fifty, fairly embarked\r\nupon the tepid and rose-coloured stream of flirtation; he quizzing her,\r\nshe admiring him--she thinking of her wedding, he only of her will. A\r\nnew and ingenious idea, worthy of a French novelist, and which, we\r\napprehend, could by no possibility have occurred to any other.\r\n\r\nWe shall close this paper with a tale, appended, as make-weight, to the\r\nfinal volume of the \"Gentilhomme Campagnard\", and whose brevity\r\nrecommends it for extraction. It is too short and slight to be a fair\r\nspecimen of M. de Bernard's powers, but, as far as it goes, it is as\r\nwitty and amusing as any thing he has written. It is entitled--\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONSULTATION.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of last autumn, amongst a number of persons\r\nassembled in Doctor Magnian's waiting room, sat a man of about forty\r\nyears of age, fair complexioned, thin, pale, with a slight stoop in his\r\nshoulders, and altogether of a weak and sickly aspect, that would have\r\nconvinced any one he was in the house of a physician. On his entrance,\r\nthis person had established himself in a corner with an uneasy air, and\r\nthere waited until all the other patients had had their consultations.\r\nWhen the last had departed, the master of the house approached him with\r\na friendly smile.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Bouchereau,\" said the doctor; \"excuse me for making you\r\nwait; but my time belongs in the first instance to the sick, and I trust\r\nyou have no such claim on an early audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sufferings of the mind are worse than those of the body,\" said the\r\npale man, with a stifled sigh.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" cried the doctor. \"You look haggard and anxious.\r\nSurely Madame Bouchereau is not ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife is in robust health,\" replied Bouchereau, smiling bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Then what is the cause of your agitation? The mind, say you? If you do\r\nnot speak, how am I to tell what passes in yours? Come, how can I serve\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear doctor,\" said the other, sitting down with a most dejected\r\ncountenance, \"we have known each other for twenty years. I look upon you\r\nas my best friend, and in you I have unlimited confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said the doctor--\"enough of compliments.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not compliments; I speak from my heart. And the strange\r\nconfession I have resolved to make to you will be sufficient proof of my\r\nesteem for your character.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the point!\" cried Magnian impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is melancholy for me, and may even appear ridiculous. That is\r\nwhy I hesitate. Promise me, in the first place, never to reveal what I\r\nam about to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The secret of the confessional is as sacred for the physician as for\r\nthe priest,\" said Doctor Magnian gravely.\r\n\r\nBouchereau again sighed, bit his lips, and gazed up at the ceiling. \"You\r\nknow Pelletier?\" he at last said, looking piteously at his friend.\r\n\r\n\"The captain on the staff? Of course I do. Sanguine habit, short neck,\r\nmore shoulders than brains, organisation of a bull! I have always\r\npredicted he would die of apoplexy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven fulfil your prophecy!\"\r\n\r\n\"You astonish me! I thought you friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends!\" repeated Bouchereau, with mingled irony, and indignation.\r\n\r\n\"_Que diantre!_ Speak out, or hold your tongue. I am no Oedipus to\r\nguess your riddle.\"\r\n\r\nThe impatience that sparkled in the doctor's eyes brought his doleful\r\nfriend to the substance of his intended confession.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear Magnian,\" said he, in an agitated voice, \"in two words,\r\nhere is the case: Pelletier makes love to my wife.\"\r\n\r\nTo conceal a smile, the doctor protruded his under-lip, and nodded his\r\nhead several times with affected gravity.\r\n\r\n\"Who would have thought it?\" he at last exclaimed. \"I never suspected\r\nthe great dragoon of such good taste. But are you quite sure? Husbands\r\nare usually the last persons to discover those things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only too sure; and you shall hear how. My wife is at Fontainbleau,\r\npassing a few days with her mother. The day before yesterday I happened\r\nto remark that the key of my desk fitted her drawers. Mechanically, I\r\nopened one of them, and in a sort of mysterious pigeon-hole I found\r\nseveral letters from Pelletier.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce you did! But why open drawers belonging to your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my right. Besides, do not judge hastily. From the tenor of the\r\ncorrespondence, I am convinced Virginia's only fault is to have received\r\nthe letters and concealed the fact from me. I am pretty sure she has\r\ngiven the writer no encouragement, and I am therefore much less angry\r\nwith her than with Pelletier. Him I will never pardon. A man to whom I\r\nhave thrown open my house! an old comrade at Sainte Barbe! A friend, in\r\nshort; at least I thought him so!\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that one is never betrayed but by one's friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I called upon him yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"I reproached him with his shameful conduct. Can you guess his answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"He denied the fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"At first. But when I showed him his letters he saw it was useless to\r\nlie. 'My dear Bouchereau,' he said, in his impertinent manner, 'since\r\nyou know all about it, I will not take the trouble to contradict you. It\r\nis perfectly true that I am in love with your wife; I have told her so\r\nalready, and I cannot promise you that I will not tell her so again, for\r\nvery likely I should not keep my promise. I perfectly understand my\r\nconduct may be disagreeable to you, but you know I am too much the\r\ngentleman not to accept the responsibility of my acts and deeds. And if\r\nyou feel offended, I am at your orders, ready to give you satisfaction,\r\nwhen, where, and how you like.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Very cool indeed!\" said the physician, struggling violently to keep his\r\ncountenance. \"What! he had the effrontery to tell you that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Word for word.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was your answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he should hear from me shortly. Then I left him, deeming further\r\ndiscussion unbecoming. And so the matter stands.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked grave. After walking once up and down the room, his\r\neyes on the ground, his hands behind his back, he returned to his\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\"What shall you do?\" he said, looking him steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\"What do you advise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such behaviour is very hard to put up with, but on the other hand, I\r\nshould be sorry to see you engaged in a duel with that bully Pelletier.\"\r\n\r\n\"A professed duellist,\" cried Bouchereau, his eyes opening wider and\r\nwider; \"a man who passes his mornings in the shooting gallery and\r\nfencing room, and has a duel regularly once a quarter!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" said the Doctor with a piercing look, \"have you ever fought a\r\nduel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" replied the married man, looking paler even than his wont; \"not\r\nbut that I have had opportunities, but duelling is repugnant to my\r\nprinciples. The idea of shedding blood shocks me; it is a barbarous\r\ncustom, a monstrous anomaly in these civilised days.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, you have no very strong desire to enter the lists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I positively outraged, had I a mortal injury to revenge, the voice\r\nof passion would perhaps drown that of humanity; for, in certain\r\nmoments, the wisest man cannot answer for himself. But in this instance,\r\nthe affair not being so serious, if Pelletier, instead of affecting an\r\narrogant tone, had made the apology to which I think I have a right, and\r\nhad promised to behave better in future, then--all things considered--to\r\navoid scandal--don't you think it would have been possible and\r\nhonourable--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to fight?\" interrupted Magnian; \"certainly. If you go out with\r\nPelletier, ten to one that he bleeds you like a barn-door fowl, and that\r\nwould be unpleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, you misunderstand me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. And to prove the contrary, you shall not fight, and the\r\nCaptain shall make you a satisfactory apology. Is not that what you\r\nwant?\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor's penetration called up a faint flush on the cheek of the\r\nlover of peace.\r\n\r\n\"Pelletier is a brute,\" resumed Magnian, as if speaking to himself.\r\n\"Staff officers have generally more breeding than that. To make love to\r\nthe wife, well and good; but to defy the husband is contrary to all the\r\nrules of polite society.\"\r\n\r\n\"You advise me, then, to let the matter be arranged?\" said Bouchereau,\r\nin an insinuating tone.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the physician laughing, \"and what is more, I\r\nundertake the negotiation. I repeat my words: to-morrow Pelletier shall\r\nretract his provocation, make you a formal apology, and swear never\r\nagain to disturb your conjugal felicity. This is my share of the\r\nbusiness; the rest concerns you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is one thing to promise, another to perform. It would be prudent to\r\nfacilitate the observance of the Captain's vow by a little tour, which\r\nfor a few months would remove Madame Bouchereau from the immediate\r\nvicinity of this military Adonis. His duty keeps him at Paris; you are\r\nfree. Why not pass the winter in the South: at Nice, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has already occurred to me that a short absence would be desirable,\r\nand I rejoice to find you of my opinion. But why Nice, rather than any\r\nother town?\"\r\n\r\n\"The climate is extremely salutary, especially for a person whose chest\r\nis rather delicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my chest is very strong,--at least I hope so,\" interrupted\r\nBouchereau, in an uneasy tone, and trying to read the Doctor's thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; I say nothing to the contrary,\" replied Magnian gravely; \"I\r\nhave no particular motive for my advice; but precautions never do harm,\r\nand it is easier to prevent than cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think me threatened with consumption!\" cried Bouchereau, who, as\r\nhas been shown, entertained the warmest affection for Number One.\r\n\r\n\"I said nothing of the sort,\" replied the physician, as if reproaching\r\nhimself for having said too much. \"If you want to know why I proposed\r\nNice, I will tell you: it is from a selfish motive. I shall probably\r\npass part of this winter there, and my stay would be made very agreeable\r\nby the society of yourself and Madame Bouchereau.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will see; the thing may be arranged,\" replied Bouchereau. And\r\nhe left the house, more uneasy than he entered it; for to the\r\napprehension of a duel was superadded the fear of a dangerous disease,\r\nby which he had never before contemplated the possibility of his being\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock that evening, Doctor Magnian entered the Cafe Anglais,\r\nwhere he made pretty sure to find Pelletier. Nor was he mistaken; the\r\ngallant Captain was there, solitarily installed at a little table, and\r\ndining very heartily, without putting water in his wine. He was a tall,\r\nstout, vigorous fellow, square in the shoulder, narrow in the hip, with\r\na bold keen eye, a well-grown mustache, a high complexion, and a\r\nmuscular arm; one of those men of martial mien who would seem to have\r\nmissed their vocation if they were not soldiers, and whose aspect\r\ninspires the most presumptuous with a certain reserve and modesty. More\r\ndoughty champions than the cadaverous Bouchereau might have shrunk from\r\nan encounter with a lion of such formidable breed.\r\n\r\nThe physician and the officer saluted each other cordially, and after\r\nexchanging a few compliments, took their dinner at different tables.\r\nThey left the coffee-house at the same time, and meeting at the door,\r\nwalked arm in arm along the boulevard, in the direction of the\r\nMadeleine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Doctor,\" said Pelletier jocosely, \"have you found me what I have\r\nasked you for at least ten times: a pretty woman--maid or widow, fair or\r\ndark, tall or short, all one to me--who will consent to make me the\r\nhappiest of men, by uniting her lot with mine? I ask only a hundred\r\nthousand crowns: you must own I am modest in my expectations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too modest! you are worth more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are laughing at me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; besides the moment would be ill chosen to jest, for I have\r\na serious affair on hand. Bouchereau has commissioned me to speak to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you call that a serious affair?\" said the Captain, laughing\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n\"A matter that can only end in bloodshed, appears to me deserving of the\r\nepithet,\" said the Doctor, with assumed gravity.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! M. Bouchereau thirsts for my blood?\" cried Pelletier, laughing\r\nstill louder; \"hitherto, I took him to be rather herbivorous than\r\ncarniverous. And with what sauce does he propose to eat me--sword or\r\npistol?\"\r\n\r\n\"He leaves you the choice of arms,\" replied M. Magnian, with\r\nimperturbable seriousness.\r\n\r\n\"It's all one to me. I told him so already. Let me see: to-morrow I\r\nbreakfast with some of my comrades; it is a sort of regimental feed, and\r\nI should not like to miss it, but the day after to-morrow, I'm your man.\r\nWill that do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. The day after to-morrow, seven in the morning, at the\r\nentrance of the forest of Vincennes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" said the Captain, familiarly slapping his companion's arm with\r\nhis large brawny hand. \"So you meddle with duelling, Doctor? I should\r\nhave thought a man of your profession would have looked upon it as a\r\ndangerous competitor.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician replied to this very old joke, by a malicious smile, which\r\nhe immediately repressed.\r\n\r\n\"At random you have touched me on the raw,\" he said, after a moment's\r\nsilence. \"Shall I tell you the strange, I might say the monstrous idea\r\nthat has just come into my head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do. I am rather partial to monstrous ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"It occurred to me that for the interest of my reputation, I ought to\r\nwish the projected duel to prove fatal to Bouchereau.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" inquired the officer, with some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Because if you don't kill him, in less than a year I shall have the\r\ncredit of his death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand. Are you going to fight him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; but I am his physician, and as such, responsible for his\r\nexistence in the eyes of the vast number of persons who expect medical\r\nscience to give sick men the health that nature refuses them. Therefore,\r\nas Bouchereau, according to all appearance, has not a year to live----\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with him?\" cried Pelletier, opening his great eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Consumption!\" replied the Doctor, in a compassionate tone, \"a chronic\r\ndisease--quite incurable! I was about sending him to Nice. We,\r\nphysicians, as you know, when we have exhausted the resources of\r\nmedicine, send our patients to the waters or to the South. If nothing\r\nhappens to him the day after to-morrow, he shall set out: God knows if\r\nhe will ever return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consumptive! he who is always as sallow as Debureau.\"\r\n\r\n\"Complexion has nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think he is in danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not give him a year to live; perhaps not six months.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men walked some distance, silent and serious.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Captain,\" said the Doctor, breaking the pause, \"we may look upon\r\nPoor Bouchereau as a dead man, even setting aside the risk he incurs\r\nfrom your good blade. Before twelve months are past, his wife may think\r\nabout a second husband. She will be a charming little widow, and will\r\nnot want for admirers.\"\r\n\r\nPelletier cast a sidelong look at his companion, but the Doctor's air of\r\nperfect simplicity dispelled the suspicion his last words had awakened.\r\n\r\n\"If Bouchereau died, his wife would be rich?\" said the Captain,\r\nmusingly, but in an interrogative tone.\r\n\r\n\"_Peste!_\" replied Magnian, \"you may say that. Not one hundred thousand,\r\nbut two hundred thousand crowns, at the very least.\"\r\n\r\n\"You exaggerate!\" cried the Captain, his eyes suddenly sparkling.\r\n\r\n\"Easy to calculate,\" said Magnian confidently--\"Madame Bouchereau\r\ninherited a hundred thousand francs from her father, she will have a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand from her mother, and her husband will leave\r\nher three hundred and fifty thousand more: add that up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her husband's fortune is secured to her, then, by marriage contract?\"\r\ninquired Pelletier, who had listened with rapidly increasing interest to\r\nhis companion's enumeration.\r\n\r\n\"Every _sou_,\" replied the physician, solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe two words were worth an hour's oration, and with a person whom he\r\nesteemed intelligent, M. Magnian would not have added another. But,\r\nremembering that the Captain, as he had said a few hours before, was\r\nmore richly endowed with shoulders than with brains, he did not fear to\r\nweigh a little heavily upon an idea from which he expected a magical\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\"For you,\" he jestingly resumed, \"who have the bump of matrimony finely\r\ndeveloped, here would be a capital match. Young, pretty, amiable, and a\r\nfortune of six hundred thousand francs. Though, to be sure, if you kill\r\nthe husband, you can hardly expect to marry the widow.\"\r\n\r\nPelletier forced a laugh, which ill agreed with the thoughtful\r\nexpression his physiognomy had assumed; then he changed the\r\nconversation. Certain that he had attained his end, the Doctor pleaded a\r\nprofessional visit, and left the Captain upon the boulevard, struck to\r\nthe very heart by the six hundred thousand francs of the future widow.\r\n\r\nWithout halt or pause, and with the furious velocity of a wounded\r\nwild-boar, Pelletier went, without help of omnibus, from the Madeleine\r\nto the Bastille. When he reached the Porte St Martin, his determination\r\nwas already taken.\r\n\r\n\"Without knowing it,\" he thought, \"the Doctor has given me excellent\r\nadvice. Fight Bouchereau! not so stupid. I should kill him; I am so\r\nunlucky! and then how could I reappear before Virginia? The little\r\ncoquette views me with no indifferent eye; and luckily I have made love\r\nto her for the last three months, so that when the grand day comes, she\r\ncannot suppose I love her for her money. Kill Bouchereau! that _would_\r\nbe absurd. Let him die in his bed, the dear man--I shall not prevent it.\r\nI shall have plenty of fighting with my rivals, as soon as his wife is a\r\nwidow. Six hundred thousand francs! They'll throng about her like bees\r\nround a honey-pot. But let them take care; I'm first in the field, and\r\nnot the man to let them walk over my body.\"\r\n\r\nThe following morning, long before the consultations had begun, the\r\nCaptain strode into Magnian's reception room.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said he, with military frankness, \"what you said yesterday\r\nabout Bouchereau's illness, has made me seriously reflect. I cannot\r\nfight a man who has only six months to live. Suppose I wound him: a\r\nhurt, of which another would get well, might be mortal to one in his\r\nstate of health; and then I should reproach myself, all my life, with\r\nhaving killed an old friend for a mere trifle. Did he tell you the cause\r\nof our quarrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Doctor, who, in his capacity of negotiator, thought\r\nhimself at liberty to lie.\r\n\r\n\"A few hasty words,\" said Pelletier, deceived by Magnian's candid air;\r\n\"in fact, I believe I was in the wrong. You know I am very hasty; a\r\npropos of some trifle or other, I was rough to poor Bouchereau, and now\r\nI am sorry for it. In short, I have had enough duels to be able to avoid\r\none without any body suspecting a white feather in my wing. So if you\r\nwill advise Bouchereau to let the matter drop, I give you _carte\r\nblanche_. Between ourselves, I think he will not be sorry for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may find yourself mistaken, Captain,\" replied the Doctor, with\r\nadmirable seriousness; \"yesterday Bouchereau was much exasperated:\r\nalthough of peaceable habits, he is a perfect tiger when his blood is\r\nup. It appears that you hurt his feelings, and unless you make a formal\r\napology----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" interrupted Pelletier, \"it is not much in my way to\r\napologise, and this is the first time; but with an old friend, I will\r\nstretch a point. I would rather make concessions than have to reproach\r\nmyself hereafter. Shall we go to Bouchereau?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go,\" said the Doctor, who could hardly help smiling to see how\r\nthe voice of interest instilled sensibility and humanity into the heart\r\nof a professed duellist.\r\n\r\nWhen Magnian and the officer entered his drawing-room, Bouchereau, who\r\nhad not shut his eyes the whole night, experienced all the sensations of\r\nthe criminal to whom sentence of death is read. But the first words\r\nspoken restored fluidity to his blood, for a moment frozen in his veins.\r\nThe Captain made the most explicit and formal apology, and retired after\r\nshaking the hand of his old friend, who, overjoyed at his escape, did\r\nnot show himself very exacting.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, you are a sorcerer!\" cried Bouchereau, as soon as he found\r\nhimself alone with the physician.\r\n\r\n\"It is almost part of my profession,\" replied Magnian laughing.\r\n\"However, the terrible affair is nearly arranged. I have done my share;\r\ndo yours. When shall you set out for the south?\"\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction depicted on Bouchereau's physiognomy vanished, and was\r\nreplaced by sombre anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said he, in an altered voice, \"You must tell me the truth; I\r\nhave resolution to hear my sentence with calmness; my chest is attacked,\r\nis it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"My head also!\" cried Bouchereau, positively green with terror.\r\n\r\n\"You are mad,\" said the Doctor, shrugging his shoulders; \"I would\r\nwillingly change my chest for yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deceive me. I cannot forget what escaped you yesterday. I coughed\r\nall night long, and I have a pain between my shoulders which I never\r\nperceived before.\"\r\n\r\n\"All fancy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel what I feel,\" continued Bouchereau gloomily; \"I do not fear\r\ndeath; but I confess that I could not, without regret, bid an eternal\r\nadieu, in the prime of life, to my wife and family. It is my duty to be\r\ncautious for their sake, if not for my own. Instead of writing to\r\nVirginia to return home, I will join her at Fontainbleau, and start at\r\nonce for Nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" said the doctor, \"the journey cannot hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you think it will benefit me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not too late, then, to combat this frightful malady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are not very far gone,\" said Magnian ironically. \"I shall be at\r\nNice myself in less than six weeks, so that you are sure to be attended\r\nby a physician in whom you have confidence, if, contrary to all\r\nprobability, your state of health requires it.\"\r\n\r\nThe two friends parted: the Doctor laughing at his patient's fears, the\r\npatient imagining himself in imminent peril, and almost doubting whether\r\nit would not have been better to fall by the terrible sword of Captain\r\nPelletier than to linger and expire, in the flower of his age, upon an\r\ninhospitable foreign shore. In two days, Bouchereau, haunted by his\r\nfunereal visions, had taken out his passport, arranged his affairs, and\r\ncompleted his preparations. Getting into a post-chaise, he made his\r\nunexpected appearance at Fontainbleau; and, exerting his marital\r\nauthority to an extent he had never previously ventured upon, he carried\r\noff his wife, stupified by such a sudden decision, and greatly vexed to\r\nleave Paris, which Pelletier's languishing epistles had lately made her\r\nfind an unusually agreeable residence. By the end of the week, the\r\nhusband and wife, one trembling for his life, the other regretting her\r\nadmirer, arrived at Nice, where, towards the close of the autumn, they\r\nwere joined by Dr Magnian, who thus showed himself scrupulously exact in\r\nthe fulfilment of his promise.\r\n\r\nOn an evening of the month of April following, the tragedy of _Les\r\nHoraces_ was performed at the _Theatre Francais_. Thanks to the young\r\ntalent of Mademoiselle Rachel, rather than to the old genius of\r\nCorneille, the house was crowded. In the centre of the right-hand\r\nbalcony, Captain Pelletier, accompanied by some blusterers of the same\r\nkidney, talked loud, laughed ditto, criticised the actors and\r\nspectators, and disturbed all his neighbours, without any one venturing\r\nto call him to order; so powerful, in certain cases, is the influence of\r\nan insolent look, a ferocious mustache, and an elephantine build.\r\n\r\nAfter examining with his opera glass every corner of the theatre, from\r\nthe pit to the roof, the Captain at last caught sight of a group, snugly\r\ninstalled in a comfortable box, which at once fixed his attention. It\r\nconsisted of Monsieur and Madame Bouchereau, in front, and of Doctor\r\nMagnian, seated behind the lady. The appearance and attitude of these\r\nthree persons were characteristic. With his usual pallid complexion and\r\nunhappy look, his eyes adorned with a pair of blue spectacles--a new\r\nembellishment, which he owed to an imaginary ophthalmia--the pacific\r\nhusband whiled away the _entr'acte_ by the study of a play-bill, which\r\nhe abandoned when the curtain rose, to bestow his deepest attention on\r\nthe actors, even though none but the inferior characters were on the\r\nstage. Madame Bouchereau trifled with an elegant nosegay, whose perfume\r\nshe frequently inhaled, and whose crimson flowers contrasted so well\r\nwith the fairness of her complexion, as to justify a suspicion that\r\nthere was some coquetry in the manoeuvre executed with such apparent\r\nnegligence. Leaning back in her chair, she frequently turned her head,\r\nthe better to hear Magnian's smiling and half-whispered remarks. The\r\nhusband paid no attention to their conversation, and did not seem to\r\nremark its intimate and confidential character.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it you have been looking at for the last quarter of an hour?\"\r\ninquired one of the Captain's comrades. \"At your old flame, Madame\r\nBouchereau? I thought you had forgotten her long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know she had returned from Nice,\" replied Pelletier, with a\r\nreserved air.\r\n\r\n\"She has been at Paris a fort-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does not Bouchereau look very ill? The southern climate has not done\r\nhim much good. He is twice as pale as before he went. Poor Bouchereau!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed the officer, \"have you been gulled by the story of the\r\ndecline? That is really too good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is too good?\" asked the Captain abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"The trick that rogue Magnian played Bouchereau and you; for if I may\r\njudge from your astonished look, you also have been mystified.\"\r\n\r\n\"Berton, you abuse my patience,\" said Pelletier in a surly tone.\r\n\r\n\"Wolves do not eat one another,\" replied Berton laughing; \"so let us\r\ntalk without anger. The story is this:--all Paris, except yourself, has\r\nbeen laughing at it for a week past. It appears that on the one hand,\r\nalthough no one suspected it, the aforesaid Magnian was in love with\r\nMadame Bouchereau, and that on the other, finding himself threatened\r\nwith a pulmonary complaint, he thought it advisable to pass the winter\r\nin a warm climate. What did the arch-schemer? He persuaded Bouchereau\r\nthat it was he, Bouchereau, whose chest was affected; sent him off to\r\nNice with his pretty wife, and, at his leisure, without haste or hurry,\r\njoined them there. You have only to look at them, as they sit yonder, to\r\nguess the _denouement_ of the history. The appropriate label for their\r\nbox would be the title of one of Paul de Kock's last novels; _la Femme_,\r\n_le Mari_, _el l'Amant_. Magnian is a cunning dog, and has very\r\ningenious ideas. Fearing, doubtless, that the husband might be too\r\nclear-sighted, he threatened him with an ophthalmia, and made him wear\r\nblue spectacles. Clever, wasn't it? and a capital story?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming, delightful!\" cried the Captain, with a smile that resembled a\r\ngnashing of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy was over. Dr Magnian left his box; Pelletier followed his\r\nexample. The next minute the two men met in the lobby.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, a word with you,\" said the officer sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Two, if you like, Captain,\" was Magnian's jovial reply.\r\n\r\n\"It appears, that in spite of your prognostics, Bouchereau is in perfect\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Voudriez-vous qu'il mourut?_ Would you have him die?\" said the Doctor,\r\nparodying with a comical emphasis the delivery of Joanny, who had taken\r\nthe part of the father of the Horatii.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are excellent at a joke,\" retorted Pelletier, whose vexation\r\nwas rapidly turning to anger; \"but you know that I am not accustomed to\r\nserve as a butt. Be good enough to speak seriously. Is it true that\r\nBouchereau was never in danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"In great danger, on the contrary. Was he not about fighting you?\"\r\n\r\n\"So that when you sent him to Nice----?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to prevent the duel. As a physician, I watch over the health of\r\nmy clients; and it was my duty to preserve Bouchereau from your sword,\r\nwhich is said to be a terrible malady.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of which you will perhaps have to cure yourself before very long,\"\r\nexclaimed the Captain, completely exasperated by the Doctor's coolness.\r\n\"The idiot Bouchereau may die of fear, or of any thing else. I certainly\r\nshall not do him the honour to meddle with him; but you, my friend, so\r\nskilled in sharp jests, I shall be glad to see if your valour equals\r\nyour wit.\"\r\n\r\nThe part of an unfortunate and mystified rival is so humiliating, that\r\nPelletier's vanity prevented his stating his real ground of complaint,\r\nand mentioning the name of Madame Bouchereau. The Doctor imitated his\r\nreserve, and listened to the officer's defiance with the same tranquil\r\nsmile which had previously played upon his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Captain,\" he said, \"at this moment you would particularly like\r\nto pass your good sword through my body, or to lodge a ball in my\r\nleg--for, in consideration of our old friendship, I presume you would\r\nspare my head. You shall have the opportunity, if you positively insist\r\nupon it. But if you kill me, who will arrange your marriage with\r\nMademoiselle Nanteuil?\"\r\n\r\nPelletier stared at his adversary with an astonished look, which\r\nredoubled the Doctor's good humour.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Mademoiselle Nanteuil?\" he at last said, his voice involuntarily\r\nsoftening.\r\n\r\n\"An amiable heiress whom I attend, although she is in perfect health;\r\nwho has two hundred thousand francs in possession, as much more in\r\nperspective, and who, if an intelligent friend undertook the\r\nnegotiation, would consent, I think, to bestow her hand and fortune upon\r\na good-looking fellow like yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound this Magnian!\" said the Captain, taking the Doctor's arm, \"it\r\nis impossible to be angry with him.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] It is pretty generally known--even to those to whom it has not been\r\ngranted to stand in the imposing presence of our fast friend and ancient\r\nally, Monsieur Alexandre Dumas--that there is a slight tinge of black in\r\nthe blood of that greatest of French _romanciers_, past, present, or to\r\ncome. In connexion with the fact, we will cite an anecdote:--\r\n\r\nA person more remarkable for inquisitiveness than for correct\r\nbreeding--one of those who, devoid of delicacy and reckless of rebuffs,\r\npry into every thing--took the liberty to question M. Dumas rather\r\nclosely concerning his genealogical tree.\r\n\r\n\"You are a quadroon, M. Dumas?\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir,\" quietly replied Dumas, who has sense enough not to be\r\nashamed of a descent he cannot conceal.\r\n\r\n\"And your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was a mulatto.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"A negro,\" hastily answered the dramatist, whose patience was waning\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n\"And may I inquire what your great-grandfather was?\"\r\n\r\n\"An ape, sir,\" thundered Dumas, with a fierceness that made his\r\nimpertinent interrogator shrink into the smallest possible compass. \"An\r\nape, sir--my pedigree commences where yours terminates.\"\r\n\r\nThe father of Alexander Dumas, the republican general of the same name,\r\nwas a mulatto, born in St Domingo, the son of a negress and of the white\r\nMarquis de la Pailleterie. By what legitimatizing process the bend\r\nsinister was erased, and the marquisate preserved, we have hitherto been\r\nunable to ascertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELISARIUS,--WAS HE BLIND?\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: Greek sections in this article are unclear and have\r\nbeen transliterated to the best of my ability. The very unclear letters\r\nhave been replaced by an asterisk]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Belisarius is more generally known through the medium of the\r\nnovel, the opera, and the print-shop than by the pages of history.\r\nProcopius, Gibbon, and Lord Mahon have done less for his universal\r\npopularity than some unknown Greek romancer or ballad-singer in the\r\nmiddle ages. Our ideas of the hero are involuntarily connected with the\r\nfigure of a tall old man, clad in a ragged mantle, with a stout staff in\r\nhis left hand, and a platter to receive an obolus in his right,\r\naccompanied by a fair boy grasping his tattered garments, and carefully\r\nguiding his steps.\r\n\r\nWe shall now venture to investigate the relationship between the\r\nBelisarius of romance, and the Belisarius of history; and we believe we\r\nshall be able to prove that the historical hero died in full possession\r\nof his sight several centuries before the birth of his blind namesake,\r\nthe hero of romance; that he was not more directly related to the\r\nunfortunate sufferer, than our disreputable acquaintance Don Juan of the\r\nopera, was to the gallant and presumptuous Don Juan of Austria, the hero\r\nof Lepanto; and that in short, as we say in Scotland, there was no\r\nconnexion but the name. In this case, however, the connexion has proved\r\na pretty close one; for a noble, accomplished and accurate English\r\nhistorian, Lord Mahon, in his \"Life of Belisarius\" has considered it\r\nstrong enough to advance a plea of identity between the warrior of\r\nhistory and the beggar of romance.\r\n\r\nSuch an authority renders the labour of brushing the dust from a few\r\nvolumes of Byzantine Chronicles to us \"a not ungrateful task;\" and one\r\nthat we hope will not prove entirely without interest to our readers.\r\nOur object is to re-establish the truth of history, and to restore to\r\nsome Greek Walter Scott of the middle ages the whole merit of\r\nconstructing an immortal tale, which for centuries has tinged the stern\r\nannals of the Eastern empire with an unwonted colouring of pathos. Lord\r\nMahon has so fairly stated his case, that we believe his candour has\r\nlaid criticism to sleep, and his readers have generally adopted his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the Belisarius of history, the bold and splendid general\r\nof Justinian, is a hero of the Roman empire, of the Eastern or Byzantine\r\nempire, if you please, but still historically a Roman hero. Now, on the\r\nother hand, the Belisarius of romance, the vision of a noble victim of\r\nimperial ingratitude, is a creation of Greek genius, of modern Greek\r\ngenius, if you prefer adding the depreciating epithet, but still of\r\nGreek genius placed in its undying opposition to Roman power.\r\n\r\nWe must now introduce to our readers the Belisarius of history as he\r\nreally lived, acted, and suffered. It is not necessary for this purpose\r\nto recite his military exploits. They are described in the immortal\r\npages of Gibbon, and minutely detailed in the accurate biography by Lord\r\nMahon. It will suffice for our purpose to collect a few authentic\r\nsketches of his personal conduct and character, and some anecdotes of\r\nhis style of living, from the works of his secretary Procopius, the last\r\nclassic Greek writer, and an historian of no mean merit.\r\n\r\nBelisarius was born in the city of Germania, a metropolitan see on the\r\nfrontiers of the Thracian and Illyrian nations.[9] Thus, though strictly\r\nspeaking he was neither a Roman nor a Greek, he considered himself, and\r\nwas considered by his contemporaries, a Roman. The dialect of the\r\ninhabitants of Thrace and Illyria is supposed still to possess a\r\nrepresentative in the modern Albanian; but in the time of Justinian,\r\nthe language of the higher classes in the cities was Latin, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that Belisarius spoke both Latin and Greek with equal\r\nfluency. As far as race was concerned, it seems, however, tolerably\r\ncertain, that he was more closely allied in blood to Scanderberg and\r\nMiaoulis than to Scipio or Epaminondas. As he was a man of rank and\r\nfamily, he became an officer of the imperial guard at an early age.[10]\r\nHis tall and vigorous frame, smooth and handsome face, joined to a\r\nsmoother tongue, a calm and equable disposition, and a stout heart, made\r\nhim the very man to rise rapidly in the Roman service. Accordingly, as\r\nearly as the year 526, he appears in a high military command.[11] Like\r\nMarlborough, to whom he bears some resemblance in personal character, he\r\nstrengthened his position at court by marrying the Lady Antonina, the\r\nbeautiful favourite of the Empress Theodora, though she was as fierce a\r\nshrew as the Duchess Sarah, and wherewithal not so modest, if we give\r\ncredit to her husband's secretary.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion at the Horse-guards of Constantinople during the\r\nreign of Justinian, to encourage barbarian usages in military affairs.\r\nHussars from the country of the Gepids, cuirassiers from Armenia and the\r\nancient seats of the Goths, and light cavalry from the regions occupied\r\nby the Huns, were the favourite bodies of troops. The young nobles of\r\nthe Roman empire adopted the uniforms of these regiments; wore long\r\nhair, inlaid armour, and tight nether garments, and never condescended\r\nto invest their persons in the modest equipments of the old Roman\r\ndragoons, or of the modern legionaries whose ranks were officered by\r\nmere provincials.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which compelled the imperial government to prefer foreign\r\nmercenaries to native troops were based at first on principles of\r\ninternal policy, and at last on absolute necessity. Augustus feared the\r\nRoman senators and knights; Constantine had not the means of paying for\r\ngood Roman soldiers; and Justinian could not have found a sufficient\r\nnumber of suitable recruits among the citizens of his wide-extended\r\nempire. The pivot of the administration of Imperial Rome, as of Imperial\r\nBritain, was the treasury, not the Horse-guards. The taxes paid by the\r\ncitizens filled that treasury: but a soldier was exempt from taxation;\r\nconsequently, it became a measure of unavoidable necessity on the part\r\nof the Roman government to prevent citizens escaping their financial\r\nburdens by becoming soldiers. Had the citizens got possession of arms,\r\nRome could not have remained a despotism.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the system of Roman tactics rendered it necessary to\r\nprocure military recruits of a degree of physical strength far above the\r\naverage standard of mankind. When the population of the empire had been\r\ndivided into two widely separated social classes of wealthy citizens and\r\npoor cultivators, serfs, or slaves, the supply of recruits furnished by\r\nthe richest portions of the empire became very small. The danger of\r\nemploying foreign barbarians, who remained isolated amidst an\r\ninnumerable population, and surrounded by hundreds of walled towns,\r\nmanned by their own municipal guards, was evidently less than that of\r\nentrusting legions of slaves with arms, and teaching them habits of\r\ncombination and discipline. The servile wars, which inflicted a mortal\r\nwound on the Republic, would have been renewed, and would probably have\r\nsoon destroyed the Empire.[12]\r\n\r\nIt is customary with historians to discourse on the impolicy of the\r\nRoman emperors in employing barbarian mercenaries; but the fact is, that\r\ntheir finances did not admit of their purchasing the thews and sinews\r\nrequired for the service any where but among the barbarians. The system\r\ncertainly answered admirably for the imperial government. It upheld the\r\ntyranny of the Caesars and the terror of the Roman arms for more than a\r\nthousand years; and it might have rendered Rome immortal had she not\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\nIf the system really be so bad as it is often represented, it seems\r\nstrange that it should have been adopted with all its imperfections in\r\nBritish India. But the truth is this; the mercenaries of the Roman\r\narmies were more faithful to their contract than the emperors. It is by\r\nsovereigns and ministers of state, not by generals of mercenaries, that\r\nempires are prepared for destruction. Our Indian empire is always in\r\ngreater danger from a conceited Foreign secretary or a foolish\r\nGovernor-general than from a rebellion of the native troops. If our\r\nadministration be only as wise as that of Imperial Rome, somewhat more\r\njust, and a great deal less avaricious, there seems no reason why a\r\nBritish government should rule at Calcutta for a shorter period than a\r\nRoman one at Constantinople. The laws of Rome still survive in the\r\ncourts of justice of the greater part of Europe; the spirit of the Roman\r\nRepublic breathes, at the present hour, in full energy in the Papal\r\ncouncils; and are we to suppose that the institutions of a more Catholic\r\nphilanthropy, in the progress of development under the British\r\nconstitution, are less capable of acquiring an inherent vitality?\r\n\r\nThe age of Belisarius was deeply imbued with the military spirit of the\r\nmiddle ages; and Belisarius was himself as proud of his accomplishments\r\nas a daring horseman, a good lance, and a stout bowman, as of his\r\nmilitary science. Cavalry was the favourite portion of the army in his\r\nday, and he shared in the general contempt felt for infantry. The\r\nhorsemen were sheathed in complete steel; and their helmets,\r\nbreast-plates and shields, were impenetrable even to the shafts of the\r\nPersians, who drew their bow-strings to the right ear, and threw\r\ndiscredit on the prowess of the Homeric archers.[13] The Roman officers,\r\nas must always be the case where cavalry is the principal arm, were\r\nremarkable for personal courage and impetuous daring; and perhaps in the\r\nwhole annals of Rome there cannot be found another period in which\r\nheadlong rashness was so universally the characteristic of the generals\r\nof the Roman armies.\r\n\r\nThe favourite position of Belisarius on the field of battle was to\r\nfigure like Richard Coeur-de-Lion as a colonel of cuirassiers, not\r\nlike Marlborough, to perform the duties of a commander-in-chief.\r\nProcopius prefaces an account of one of his rashest combats by declaring\r\nthat he was not in the habit of exposing himself unnecessarily, but on\r\nthe occasion in question, he owns that Belisarius fought too much like a\r\nmere soldier in the front rank.\r\n\r\nThe whole Gothic army advancing to besiege Rome had passed the Tiber\r\nbefore Belisarius was aware that his troops, stationed to defend the\r\nMilvian bridge, had abandoned their post. On going out to reconnoitre,\r\nhe fell in with the enemy. Instead of retreating, he led on the cavalry\r\nthat attended him to the charge. He was mounted on his favourite\r\ncharger; the Greeks called it Phalion, the barbarians Balan, from its\r\ncolour: it was a bay with a white face. Balan was perfectly broken to\r\nhis hand, and his armour, wrought by the skill of Byzantine artists, was\r\ntoo light to incommode his powerful frame, yet tempered to resist the\r\nbest-directed arrow or javelin. The person of Belisarius was soon\r\nrecognised in the Gothic army, and the shout spread far and wide to the\r\njavelin-men and the archers, \"At the bay horse! At the bay horse!\" The\r\nbravest of the Gothic chiefs placed their lances in rest, and rushed\r\nforward to bear down the Roman general. The guards of Belisarius, in\r\nthat trying hour, showed themselves worthy of their own and, their\r\ngeneral's fame. They closed up by his side, so well as to leave him only\r\na single enemy. It is ridiculous to attempt describing a personal\r\nencounter thirteen centuries after the event. The duties of Procopius\r\ndid not place him at the elbow of Belisarius at such an hour, and even\r\nif he had been there he could have seen but little of what others were\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe result of the encounter is matter of history. A thousand Goths fell\r\nin the skirmish, and the bravest of the veteran guards of Belisarius\r\nperished by his side. The barbarians were driven back to their camp; but\r\nwhen Belisarius imprudently followed them, he was repulsed by the Gothic\r\ninfantry forming before the lines, and the Romans were compelled to make\r\na precipitate retreat. They galloped back to the gates of Rome closely\r\npursued by fresh squadrons of Gothic cavalry. But as they reached the\r\nwalls in disorder, the garrison refused to open the gates, fearing lest\r\nthe Goths might force their way into the city with the fugitives, and\r\nbelieving that Belisarius had perished in the battle. There was now\r\nnothing left for the commander-in-chief but to form a small squadron of\r\nhis faithful guards, and make a desperate and sudden charge on the\r\nadvancing Goths. The manoeuvre was executed with consummate skill, and\r\nthe leading ranks of the enemy were broken, thrown into confusion, and\r\nforced back on the succeeding squadrons by the impetuous charge. The cry\r\nspread that the garrison had made a sally; the obscurity of evening was\r\ncommencing, the Goths commenced their retreat; and Belisarius and his\r\nwearied troops were at last allowed to enter Rome. In this desperate\r\nencounter, their respective enemies allowed that Belisarius was the\r\nbravest of the Romans, and Wisand of the Goths. The Roman general\r\nescaped without a wound, but the valiant Goth, borne down in the combat\r\naround the person of Belisarius, was left for dead on the field, where\r\nhe remained all the next day, and it was only on the third morning, in\r\ntaking up his body for interment, that he was discovered to be still\r\nalive. He recovered from his wounds and lived long afterwards.[14]\r\n\r\nBelisarius, unlike the noble barons of more modern days, who were all\r\npride and presumption in their iron shells, mounted on their dray\r\nhorses, but useless when dismounted, did not disdain to add to his\r\nknightly accomplishments that of a most skilful archer. This skill saved\r\nRome in a dangerous attack. When the Goths advanced their movable\r\ntowers against the walls, drawn forward by innumerable yokes of oxen,\r\nBelisarius, placing himself on the ramparts, ordered the garrison to\r\nallow the towers to advance unmolested by the machines to within\r\nbow-shot. Then taking up a long bow, which might have graced the hand of\r\nRobin Hood, and choosing two shafts of a yard in length, he drew the\r\nbowstring to his ear, and shot his shaft at the tower. The Gothic\r\ncaptain, who was directing its movements from the summit, had trusted\r\ntoo much to the workmanship of his Milan armour. The fabric was not\r\nequal to that of Byzantium. The shaft pierced him to the heart; he\r\ntottered a moment on the edge of the tower, and then fell headlong\r\nforward. The second shaft brought down another Goth. Belisarius then\r\nordered his archers to shoot at the oxen, which soon fell, pierced by a\r\nthousand arrows; and the towers that the Gothic army counted on to\r\nenable them to make a general assault, remained immovable until the\r\nRomans could burn them.[15]\r\n\r\nBelisarius, fond of cavalry, seems to have overlooked, nay, even to have\r\nneglected, the discipline of the Roman infantry. While besieged in Rome,\r\nhe defended the place by a series of cavalry skirmishes, and allowed all\r\nthe officers of the infantry who could mount themselves to serve on\r\nhorse-back. Some of the native officers of the legionaries, jealous of\r\ntheir reputation, offered to lead their troops on foot. Belisarius would\r\nhardly allow them to quit the walls, and plainly expressed his want of\r\nconfidence in the Roman infantry on the field of battle, while he showed\r\nhis utter contempt for the city militia, by keeping it carefully shut up\r\nwithin the walls. The battle in which the infantry took part proved\r\nunsuccessful; but the officers who led it died bravely, sustaining the\r\ncombat after the cavalry had fled.[16]\r\n\r\nYet Belisarius knew well how to appreciate the tactics of the old Roman\r\nlegion; and he made use of a singular method of obtaining the great\r\nmilitary advantages to be derived from the possession of a body of the\r\nbest infantry. At the battle of Kallinikon, when his cavalry was broken\r\nby the iron-cased horsemen of Persia--the renowned _kataphraktoi_, or\r\noriginal steel lobsters--the Roman general, with the genius of a Scipio\r\nor a Caesar, saw that the steadiness of a body of infantry could alone\r\nsave his army. He immediately ordered the heavy lancers of his own guard\r\nto dismount, and form square before the feebler and less perfectly\r\nequipped soldiers of the legions of the line. With this phalanx,\r\npresenting its closely serried shields and long lances to the repeated\r\ncharges of the _kataphraktoi_, he foiled every attack of the victorious\r\nPersians, and saved his army.[17]\r\n\r\nBelisarius, however, acquired more favour at the court of Justinian, and\r\nsecured the personal affection of the Emperor more, by slaughtering the\r\npeople of Constantinople in a city rebellion, originating out of the\r\nfactions of the Circus, than by his exploits against the distant enemies\r\nof the empire. The affair was called the Day of Victory. The scene was\r\nrepeated on the 4th of October 1795, in the city of Paris, and was\r\ncalled the Day of the Sections. The part of the Thracian Belisarius was\r\nthen performed by the Corsican Bonaparte. In the tragedy of old, three\r\nthousand citizens were massacred by the mild Belisarius, in that of\r\nParis, hardly three hundred perished by the inexorable Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe personal conduct of Belisarius is presented to us under two totally\r\ndifferent points of view, in the works of his Secretary Procopius. In\r\nthe authentic history of the Persian, Vandal, and Gothic wars, he\r\nappears as the commander-in-chief of the Roman armies, his actions are\r\nnarrated by a Roman historian, and his conduct is held up to the\r\nadmiration of Roman society. In the secret history, on the contrary, we\r\nhave, it is true, the same man described by the same author, but the\r\nwork is addressed to the Greek race, and not to their Roman rulers, and\r\nit presents Belisarius as the instrument of a corrupt and tyrannical\r\ncourt, engaged in plundering the people, while crouching under the\r\noppression of which he was the minister. The history of Procopius was\r\nwritten for the libraries of the Byzantine nobles; the anecdotes for the\r\nclubs of the Greek people. Though composed in the same language, they\r\nbelong not only to two different classes of literature, but even to the\r\nliterature of two different races of men.[18]\r\n\r\nBelisarius was a fortunate, as well as a great general. His victories\r\nover the Vandals and the Goths prove his military talents; but the\r\nspectacle of their kings, Gelimer and Witiges, the representatives of\r\nthe dreaded Genseric and the mighty Theoderic, walking as captives\r\nthrough the streets of Constantinople, made a deeper impression on men's\r\nminds than the slaughter of the bloodiest battle. Nor was the\r\nrestoration of the sacred plate of the Temple of the Jews to the city of\r\nJerusalem, an event of less importance, in a superstitious age, than the\r\ndestruction of a barbarian monarchy. Among the spoils of the Vandals at\r\nCarthage, Belisarius had found in the treasury those sacred vessels\r\nwhich Titus, nearly five centuries before, had carried away to Rome from\r\nthe ruins of Jerusalem. Genseric had transported these relics to Africa,\r\nwhen he plundered Rome in the year 455. Justinian was generous enough to\r\nrevive the long forgotten ceremony of a Roman triumph in order to\r\naugment the glory of Belisarius; and the sacred plate of the Jews was\r\nexhibited to the people of Constantinople amidst the pomp of the\r\ngorgeous pageant. The emperor then commanded them to be removed to\r\nJerusalem, to be preserved in a Christian church.[19]\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the sacred spoils of Jerusalem rendered the name of\r\nBelisarius renowned in the eastern world, far beyond the bounds of the\r\nRoman empire; the glory of refusing the throne of the Caesars of the\r\nwest, amazed the barbarians of Europe as far as the filiation of the\r\nGothic and Germanic races extended. The glory of being deemed worthy of\r\nthe empire, was eclipsed by the singular display of personal dignity\r\nwhich could refuse the honour. When Belisarius was on the eve of putting\r\nan end to the Gothic monarchy by the conquest of Ravenna and the capture\r\nof Witiges, the Goths, reflecting on their national position in the days\r\nof Alaric and Theoderic, when they were only the soldiers of the empire,\r\noffered their submission to Belisarius, and invited him to assume the\r\ndignity of Emperor of the West. Belisarius refused the offer. He had\r\nseen in his Italian campaigns, that the Gothic nobles of Italy were no\r\nlonger the same soldiers as the Gothic mercenaries of the imperial\r\narmies.[20] The merit of refusing the empire must have been deeply felt\r\nby Justinian; but the jealousy excited by the renown, which conferred\r\nthe option of accepting such power, gradually effaced the impression of\r\nthat merit in the breasts both of the feeble emperor, and of his\r\nenergetic and ambitious consort, Theodora. Though Belisarius loved money\r\nand splendour, and had more of Pompey than Caesar in his character, still\r\nthe boldest cabinet minister must have felt that lie could no longer\r\nsafely be entrusted with the whole military power of the empire. Though\r\nhis fidelity remained inviolable, a seditious army could compel him,\r\neven if unwilling, to become its instrument. From the day, therefore,\r\nthat Belisarius refused the Empire of the West, a cloud fell over his\r\nmilitary career. It was determined by the imperial administration never\r\nagain to entrust him with a force sufficient to proceed in a career of\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to dwell on the military events of the life of\r\nBelisarius. Lord Mahon states it as the purpose of his work, to show how\r\nthe genius of one man averted the dangers, and corrected the defects,\r\nwhich beset the tottering empire.[21] Gibbon, in gorgeous phrase, exalts\r\nhim to the dignity of being the Africanus of New Rome; and speaks of the\r\nRoman armies as being animated by the spirit of Belisarius, one of those\r\nheroic names which are familiar to every age and to every nation.[22]\r\nBut if history is to be composed from the facts recorded by historians,\r\nrather than from their opinions and their distribution of flattery and\r\ncensure, it must be owned that Belisarius was only the greatest in a\r\nconstellation of gallant warriors. Hilbud, Germanos, and Salomon, were\r\nhis worthy companions in arms; and the eunuch Narses was all but his\r\nequal as a general, and greatly his superior as a statesman.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to examine the personal conduct of Belisarius. He was\r\nunfortunately too much under the influence of his beautiful wife, though\r\nshe was a few years older than her husband. Her close friendship with\r\nthe Empress Theodora, her talents, her bold character, and the devoted\r\nattachment she displayed to Belisarius, excuses his too servile\r\naffection. She embarked with him in the African expedition, though\r\nProcopius says that the boldest Roman generals feared the enterprise;\r\nand she accompanied him in Italy. In the historical works of Procopius,\r\nshe is represented as an excellent wife; in his secret libel, as a\r\nshameless and profligate woman.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Lady Antonina at Carthage and Rome, compelled\r\nBelisarius to keep up a splendid and expensive court. The\r\ncommander-in-chief was fond of wealth, Antonina of splendour. The\r\nfortunes of private individuals were still enormous, and rivalled the\r\nwealth of Crassus and the debts of Caesar.[23] Belisarius, like a noble\r\nRoman, availed himself of his commands in Africa, and Italy, to become\r\nmaster of sums equalling in amount the mighty accumulations of extortion\r\ncollected by the consuls and proconsuls of old Rome, when they plundered\r\nSyria, Egypt, Pontus and Armenia. Of this wealth Belisarius made no\r\ninconsiderable display when at Constantinople. He passed along the\r\nstreets, and appeared in the Hippodrome, attended by a numerous and\r\nbrilliant suite of Gothic, Vandal, and Mauritanian chiefs, mounted on\r\nthe finest horses, and clad in the richest armour, that wealth could\r\ncommand. In the days of his greatest prosperity, his own guards amounted\r\nto 7000 horsemen; and they were more formidable from their discipline\r\nand military experience than from their numbers. To this band of\r\nwell-trained veterans, he owed many of his victories over the Goths in\r\nItaly.[24]\r\n\r\nThe civil administration of Belisarius was never very successful. His\r\nbad financial management involved his African army in revolt; and in\r\nItaly he overlooked disorders, which at last produced indiscipline in\r\nhis own ranks, and famine among the Italians. The expense of supporting\r\nhis cohorts of personal guards, and the necessity of securing the\r\nservices of the most experienced and boldest troopers in this chosen\r\ncorps, induced him to wink at irregularities in Africa and Italy, that\r\nhe would have been obliged to punish severely near Constantinople or in\r\nGreece. At Abydos, he had ordered two Huns of the mercenary cavalry to\r\nbe hanged for committing a murder; at Rome, he ran the risk of being\r\nmurdered himself in the midst of a council of war, by one of his\r\ngenerals, from having neglected too long to cheek the rapacity and\r\ninjustice every where perpetrated under the sanction of his authority.\r\n\r\nHis own personal conduct, and the manner in which he governed Italy,\r\ncannot be better illustrated than by two examples recorded, not in the\r\nsecret libel, but in the public history of his secretary Procopius.\r\n\r\nBelisarius deposed the Pope of Rome, as well as the Kings of the Vandals\r\nand the Goths. The account Procopius gives us of this extraordinary act,\r\nis conveyed in so few and in such cautious words, that it is necessary\r\nto notice their brevity. \"The Pope Silverius was suspected of holding\r\ntreasonable communication with the Goths, who at that time besieged\r\nRome. Belisarius seized him, and banished him to Greece.\"[25] But even\r\nif the fact that Pope Silverius had really held treasonable\r\ncommunication with the Goths, be admitted, still the manner in which he\r\nwas condemned by Belisarius affords irrefragable evidence of the\r\ninjustice of his civil administration.\r\n\r\nAs the representative of the emperor, Belisarius held a court with all\r\nthe pomp of a sovereign prince. Yet when the Pope, accompanied by his\r\nclergy, presented himself at the palace to answer the summons of the\r\nimperial lieutenant, he was compelled to enter alone into the cabinet,\r\nwhere the affairs of Italy were decided by the governor-general. In this\r\nhall of audience, the Pope found Belisarius seated, while Antonina was\r\nreclining on a sofa, in the midst of the assembly, and taking an active\r\npart in the business transacted. It was she, and not Belisarius, who\r\ninterrogated the pontiff. The general's wife insulted the representative\r\nof Saint Peter with reproaches, while the general remained a silent\r\nspectator of the lady's arrogance, and did not even investigate the\r\nevidence of the Pope's guilt. Prejudged by the suspicions of Belisarius,\r\nand condemned by the anger of Antonina, Silverius was allowed no\r\nopportunity of repelling the accusations brought against him. In the\r\nvery presence of the commander-in-chief, his pontifical robes were torn\r\noff; and as he was hurried away, he was hastily covered with the garb of\r\na monk, and immediately embarked for Greece, to die an exile.\r\n\r\nNow, whether it be true or not that Belisarius and Antonina persecuted\r\nthe Pope to gratify the revenge of Theodora, who had vainly demanded his\r\napprobation of an heretical favourite, or that they committed this act\r\nof injustice to participate in a large bribe paid by his successor,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the manner of the Pope's condemnation,\r\nwithout trial, must have destroyed all confidence in the justice of\r\nBelisarius throughout Italy, and from this moment every calumny against\r\nhis administration would readily find credence.\r\n\r\nThe second example of the arbitrary government of Belisarius, affords\r\nthe means of estimating the extent to which the officers of the army\r\nwere allowed to carry their peculation and extortion, as well as the\r\ntotal disregard of all the principles of judicial administration\r\ndisplayed by the commander-in-chief himself, in compelling them to\r\ndisgorge their plunder. The details of this singular event are reported\r\nby Procopius with minuteness and simplicity, and he concludes his\r\nnarration with a distinct condemnation of the injustice of his patron's\r\nconduct. He says, it was the only dishonourable act of his life, but\r\nadds, that in spite of the usual moderation of Belisarius, Konstantinos\r\nwas murdered.[26]\r\n\r\nKonstantinos, a Thracian general, was one of the bravest and most active\r\nof the Byzantine officers. He led a division of the army against Perugia\r\nand Spoleto; and during the assault of Rome by the Goths, the defence of\r\nthe tomb of Hadrian had been confided to him. He defended this strange\r\nfortress with great valour, though his proceedings have been the subject\r\nof execration for the lovers of ancient art ever since, as he used the\r\ninnumerable statues with which the tomb was adorned, to serve as\r\nmissiles against the enemy.[27]\r\n\r\nPraesidius, a Roman of Italy, and a man of some distinction, resided at\r\nRavenna under the dominion of the Goths. Wishing to escape from their\r\npower, he fled, and sought refuge in a church near Spoleto. The only\r\nobjects of great value he had carried away with him, were two splendid\r\ndaggers set in gold, and richly adorned with valuable gems.\r\nKonstantinos, hearing of this booty, sent his adjutant to take away the\r\ndaggers. Praesidius hastened to Rome, and on arriving complained to\r\nBelisarius, who only requested Konstantinos to arrange the affair. Such\r\nconduct appeared to Praesidius a mockery of justice; and one day, as\r\nBelisarius was riding through the Agora, he laid hold of the reins of\r\nthe general's horse, and called with a loud voice, \"Is it permitted,\r\nBelisarius, by the laws of the Roman empire, that a suppliant who\r\nimplores your protection against the barbarians be plundered by Roman\r\ngenerals?\" In vain the staff officers around ordered Praesidius to let go\r\nthe general's bridle, and threatened him with punishment; he refused,\r\nuntil he received a promise from Belisarius that he should receive\r\njustice. There is something truly Oriental in all this, and very little\r\nin accordance with the principles of the Justinian code: the promise of\r\nBelisarius is considered of more value than the laws of the empire. He\r\nappears in the character of a vizier or a sultan in the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nNext day a council of the principal officers of the army was convoked in\r\nthe palace of Belisarius; and, in the presence of the assembled\r\ngenerals, Konstantinos was summoned to restore the jewelled daggers to\r\nPraesidius. The attempt to discountenance military license, which had so\r\nlong been tolerated, appeared to the rude Thracian a parade of justice,\r\nassumed merely for the purpose of imposing on the Italians; he\r\nconceived, that while surrounded by his colleagues, he might safely\r\ndespise what he considered to be a farce. He therefore refused to give\r\nup his plunder, and said gaily that he would rather throw the daggers\r\ninto the Tiber than restore them. Belisarius, enraged at the insolent\r\nboldness of his proceeding, exclaimed, \"Are you not bound to obey me?\"\r\nThe reply was, \"Yes, in every thing else according to the Emperor's\r\ncommission; but not in this matter.\" On receiving this answer, the\r\ncommander-in-chief ordered his guards to be summoned. The order\r\nastonished Konstantinos, who saw the affair was assuming a more serious\r\naspect than he had foreseen. Well aware that peculation and extortion\r\nwere not very heinous offences in the Roman armies, he immediately\r\nsuspected the existence of a project to ruin him for some other reason,\r\nand cried out, \"Are the guards ordered in to murder me?\" \"No,\" said\r\nBelisarius, \"only to compel you to restore the plunder which your\r\nadjutant seized in the church at Spoleto.\" Konstantinos saw the\r\ncommander-in-chief enraged, and knew the Byzantine government well\r\nenough to feel his life insecure under the turn affairs seemed taking.\r\nWith the quick determination of the daring chiefs who then led the\r\nfierce soldiers of the empire, he resolved to secure revenge, and\r\nperhaps make it the means of escape. Suddenly drawing his sword, he\r\nsprang at Belisarius, and made a thrust at his heart. The\r\ncommander-in-chief, struck with amazement, only contrived to escape by\r\njumping back and dodging behind Bessas, a Thracian Goth of high rank in\r\nthe Roman army.[28] Konstantinos turned to escape, but was seized by the\r\ngenerals Ildiger and Valerian; and the guards entering dragged him from\r\nthe council chamber to another room, where he was shortly after murdered\r\nby the order of Belisarius.[29]\r\n\r\nNow it must be recollected that we have an account of these two\r\nremarkable events in the life of Belisarius from an eye-witness. The\r\nvery reserve of Procopius, who, in the affair of the Pope, omits all\r\nmention of Antonina, and glides over the injustice of the proceedings\r\nfrom dread of the feminine ferocity of the lady, and the priestly\r\npersecution of the successor of Silverius, who still continued to occupy\r\nthe Papal chair when the history was written, affords us an indubitable\r\nwarrant for the accuracy of the graphic description of the impressive\r\nscene which attended the murder of Konstantinos. When the History of the\r\nGothic War was published, many of the generals who had been present at\r\nthe council were still living.\r\n\r\nThese pictures of Belisarius and his times are not very favourable. A\r\ngovernor-general sitting in council, with his wife on the sofa directing\r\nthe despatch of business, and a commander-in-chief holding a council at\r\nwhich one of his generals of division rushes at him with a drawn sword,\r\ndo not give us an exalted idea of the order maintained in society during\r\nthe brilliant conquests of Justinian's reign. Reasoning from analogy, it\r\nmay appear natural enough that such a governor-general and\r\ncommander-in-chief should end his career by having his eyes put out and\r\nby begging his bread.\r\n\r\nThere was another circumstance which very much increased the probability\r\nof Belisarius dying a beggar. We do not wish to deprive the tale of the\r\nsmallest portion of the just sympathy of the latest posterity. The fact\r\nis, Belisarius grew enormously rich during his successful campaigns\r\nagainst Gelimer and Witiges, and even contrived to accumulate treasures\r\nduring his unsuccessful wars with Chosroes and Totila.[30] Like his\r\nfriend Bessas and his enemy Konstantinos, as the truth must be spoken,\r\nhe did not neglect the golden opportunities he enjoyed of gaining golden\r\nspoils from all sorts of men. Now, from the days of Sylla, to those of\r\nJustinian, not to say a good deal earlier and later, it was the avowed\r\nsystem of the financiers of Rome to increase the budget by\r\nconfiscations. The Ottoman empire, heir to most of the vices and some of\r\nthe grandeur of Imperial Constantinople, cherished the system as a part\r\nof its strength, until it adopted the more pitiful vices of Western\r\nEurope. Anastasius--not the ecclesiastical historian of the earlier\r\nPopes, but the hero of the \"Memoirs of a Greek,\" by Mr Thomas Hope--in\r\nhis ratiocination on the principles of Ottoman finance, gives us a\r\ncompendious abstract of those of Imperial Rome during eleven centuries,\r\nfrom Augustus to Constantine Dragoses:--\r\n\r\n\"Regarding each officer of the state only in the light of one of the\r\nsmaller and more numerous reservoirs, distributed on distant points to\r\ncollect the first produce of dews, and drip, and rills, ere the\r\ncollective mass be poured into the single greater central basin of the\r\nSultan's treasury, you give yourself no trouble to check the dishonesty\r\nof your agent, or to prevent his peculations. You rather for a while\r\nconnive at, and favour and lend your own authority to his exactions,\r\nwhich will enable you, when afterwards you squeeze him out, to combine\r\ngreater profit with a more signal show of justice. In permitting a\r\ntemporary defalcation from your treasury, you consider yourselves as\r\nonly lending out your capital at more usurious interest. Nine long\r\nyears, while your work is done for you gratuitously, you feign to sleep,\r\nand the tenth you wake from your deceitful slumber; like the roused\r\nlion, you look round where grazes the fattest prey, stretch your ample\r\nclaw, crush your devoted victim, and make every drop of his blood, so\r\nlong withheld from your appetite, at last flow into the capacious bowels\r\nof your insatiable _hazne_\"--(treasury).[31]\r\n\r\nBelisarius was certainly a fatted prey, and it is no wonder that his\r\ninordinate wealth excited the cravings of the minister of finance of the\r\nlavish Justinian and the luxurious Theodora. After his return from the\r\nconquest of Italy, he lived at Constantinople in a degree of\r\nmagnificence unrivalled by the proudest modern sovereign. His household\r\nconsisted, as we have already seen, of a small army; and as he was fond\r\nof parade, he rarely appeared in public without a splendid staff of\r\nmounted officers. His liberality and his military renown ensured him the\r\napplause of the people whenever he presented himself among them. Such\r\nwealth, such a train of guards, and such popularity, not unnaturally\r\nexcited both envy and alarm. Accordingly, when the unsuccessful issue of\r\nthe campaigns against the Persians under Chosroes, in 541 and 542, had\r\ndiminished the popularity of Belisarius, the Emperor seized the occasion\r\nof rendering him less an object of fear by depriving him of a\r\nconsiderable number of his guards and great part of his treasures.[32]\r\nThe picture Procopius has drawn of Belisarius in his disgrace, is by no\r\nmeans flattering to the general; it represents him as a mean-spirited\r\nand uxorious courtier. \"It was a strange spectacle, and incredible, had\r\nwe not been eye-witnesses of the fact, to behold Belisarius, deprived of\r\nall his official rank, walking in the streets of Constantinople almost\r\nalone, dejected, melancholy, and fearing for his life.\"[33]\r\n\r\nShortly after, Belisarius was partially reinstated in favour and sent to\r\ncommand in Italy against Totila. In 548, he quitted that country for the\r\nsecond time, after struggling unsuccessfully against the Gothic monarch.\r\nThe jealousy of Justinian had prevented his receiving the supplies\r\nnecessary for carrying on the war with vigour; and the want of success\r\nis not to be considered as any stain on the military reputation of\r\nBelisarius. Though he returned ingloriously to Constantinople, still,\r\neven amidst the misfortunes of the Roman arms in Italy, he had not\r\nneglected to save or accumulate wealth, and he was enabled to pass the\r\nrest of his life in great if not in regal splendour.[34]\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed the glory of his earlier exploits, and the popularity secured\r\nby his equable temperament, undisturbed for eleven years. In the year\r\n559, an incursion of the Huns was pushed forward to the very walls of\r\nConstantinople. The weakness of Justinian, the avarice of his ministers,\r\nand the rapacity of his courtiers, had introduced such abuses in the\r\nmilitary establishments of the capital, that in this unexpected danger\r\nthe city appeared almost without a regular garrison. In this difficulty,\r\nall ranks, from Justinian to the populace, turned to Belisarius as the\r\nchampion of the empire. The aged hero, finding the imperial guards\r\nuseless as a military corps, since it had been converted into a body of\r\npensioners, appointed by the favour of ministers and courtiers, and its\r\nranks filled up with shopkeepers and valets--assembled such of the\r\nprovincial troops and of his old guards as were living in the\r\ncapital.[35] With a small body of experienced veterans, and an army in\r\nwhich fear at least ensured obedience to his orders, he took the field\r\nagainst the Huns. Victory attended his standard. He not only drove back\r\nthe barbarians, but overtook and destroyed the greater part of their\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of romance in this last campaign of Belisarius. He\r\ncould no longer lead his gallant guards to display his own, and their\r\nvalour, in some rash enterprise. His war-horse, Balan, was in its grave,\r\nand his own strength no longer served him to act the colonel of\r\ncuirassiers. But he was, perhaps, all the better general for the change;\r\nand his manoeuvres effected a more complete destruction of the Huns,\r\nthan would have resulted from the defeat of their army by the bold\r\nsallies of his youthful tactics.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the aged hero, and the proofs it afforded of his great\r\npopularity and extensive authority over the military classes throughout\r\nthe empire, again revived the jealousy of the court. The ministers of\r\nJustinian perhaps dreaded that the affection of the emperor for his\r\nformer favourite might recall Belisarius into public life, and effect a\r\nchange in the cabinet. To prevent this, they calumniated him to the\r\nfeeble prince, and worked so far on his timidity as to induce the\r\nemperor to withhold those testimonials for great public services which,\r\nit was customary to bestow. The fact that he was persecuted by the\r\ncourt, endeared Belisarius to the people and augmented the aversion of\r\nthe emperor.[36]\r\n\r\nBelisarius was now an object of suspicion to the government. And at this\r\ninteresting period of his life, all cotemporary history suddenly fails\r\nus. The events of his latter days are recorded by writers who lived more\r\nthan two hundred years after his death.[37]\r\n\r\nIn the year 562, a plot against the life of Justinian was discovered,\r\nand Belisarius was accused by some of the conspirators as privy to it.\r\nThe accusation was sure to please the party in power. Several of his\r\ndependents, on being put to the torture, gave evidence against him. He\r\nwas suspected by the government; but his conduct during a long life\r\nrendered the charge improbable, and the Roman law never placed any great\r\nreliance on evidence extracted by torture.[38] In this bitter hour, it\r\nmust be confessed that Justinian treated Belisarius with more justice\r\nthan he had treated the Pope Silverius. A privy council was convoked, at\r\nwhich the principal nobles, the patriarch, and some of the officers of\r\nthe imperial household, were present with the emperor in person.\r\nBelisarius was summoned, and the cause of the conspirators was heard.\r\nJustinian was induced for a moment to believe in his guilt. The order\r\nwas given to place him under arrest. He was deprived of the guards that\r\nstill attended him, his fortune was sequestered, and he was confined a\r\nprisoner in his palace. Six days after the first examination, the\r\nbusiness of the conspiracy was again investigated, and Justinian did not\r\nretract his previous suspicions. Belisarius was kept under arrest in\r\nhis own palace without any further proceedings being directed against\r\nhim. These examinations took place on the 5th and 11th of December; and\r\nthe text of Malalas must be received as convincing evidence that\r\nJustinian took no stronger measures against Belisarius before the\r\ncommencement of the year 563.[39]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July of that year Belisarius was restored by Justinian to\r\nall his honours. Some months of cool reflection had convinced the\r\nemperor, that the extorted evidence of a few dependents against an\r\nopposition leader, ought not not to outweigh the testimony of a long\r\nlife of unstained loyalty. The remainder of that life was passed in\r\ntranquillity; and in the month of March of the year 565, the patrician\r\nBelisarius terminated his glorious career, and his fortune reverted to\r\nthe imperial treasury. Such is the brief account which we possess of the\r\nlast days of the conqueror of the Vandals and the Goths--the restorer of\r\nthe spoils of Jerusalem--the deposer of a Pope--the destroyer of the\r\ntomb of Hadrian--and the last of the Romans who triumphed, leading kings\r\ncaptive in his train.[40] Antonina survived her husband, and lived in\r\nretirement with Vigilantia, the sister of Justinian, but in the\r\nenjoyment of wealth. Before her death she reconstructed the church of St\r\nProcopius, which had been destroyed by fire; and it received, from her\r\naffection for Justinian's sister, the name of Vigilantia.[41]\r\n\r\nWe must now notice the accounts of the modern Byzantine writers. George\r\nCedrenus was a monk of the eleventh century, who has left us a history\r\nof the world to the year 1057. It contains many popular stories, but\r\noften transcribes or abridges official documents as well as ancient\r\nhistorians. In this work we might expect to find any fable, generally\r\naccredited, concerning Belisarius; but the account of his latter days is\r\nin exact conformity with those of Theophanes and Malalas.[42]\r\n\r\nJohn Zonaras had been Grand Drungary, or First Lord of the Admiralty at\r\nConstantinople, before he retired to end his days in a monastery on\r\nMount Athos. His Chronicle extends from the Creation to the year 1118,\r\nand contains much information not found elsewhere. He is considered as\r\namong the most valuable of the Byzantine historians. He mentions that\r\nBelisarius was compromised in the plot against the life of Justinian;\r\nthat he was deprived of his guards and kept prisoner in his house; and\r\nthat, when he died, his fortune was taken by the imperial treasury.[43]\r\nConsequently Belisarius was in possession of his fortune at the time of\r\nhis death, and it is possible that Justinian may have been his legal\r\nheir.[44]\r\n\r\nThe chronicle published under the name of Leo Grammaticus, which dates\r\nfrom the twelfth century, states that Belisarius, having been accused of\r\nplotting against the Emperor Justinian, died of grief.[45]\r\n\r\nSuch are the historical accounts which the annals of the Byzantine\r\nempire furnish concerning the fate of Belisarius. But, attached to the\r\ncollection of Justinian's laws, there is a rescript, which would alone\r\nafford conclusive evidence of the restoration of Belisarius to all his\r\nhonours, if we could place implicit reliance on the date it bears.\r\nUnfortunately, however, for our purpose, the authority on which Cujacius\r\npublished it, is not sufficiently established to give satisfactory\r\nauthenticity to its date. This date is 565, and in the month of March of\r\nthis year Belisarius died; and in the month of November Justinian also\r\nfollowed him. The rescript speaks of Belisarius incidentally as \"our\r\nmost glorious patrician;\" an expression incompatible with his having\r\nsuffered any great indignity, or remained in permanent disgrace.[46]\r\n\r\nWe must now turn from examining public history, to consider popular\r\nfeeling. Belisarius, as we have already observed, was the hero of the\r\nRoman world; but another society existed in the very heart of that\r\nworld, which hated every thing Roman. This society was Greek; it had its\r\nown feelings, its own literature, and its own church. Of its literature,\r\nProcopius has left us a curious specimen in his Secret History, where\r\nthe facts of his public Roman history are presented to the discontented\r\nGreeks, richly spiced with calumny and libels on the Roman\r\nadministration. Peculiar circumstances gave the reign of Justinian a\r\nprominent position in the history of the world, as the last great era of\r\nRoman history, and its memory was long cherished with a feeling of\r\nwonder and awe.[47] We must, however, remark, that from the death of\r\nJustinian to the accession of Leo III. the Isaurian, the government of\r\nthe Eastern empire was strictly Roman. From the reign of Leo III. to\r\nthat of Basil I. the Macedonian (867) if not quite Roman, it was very\r\nfar from Greek.\r\n\r\nThree centuries after the death of Belisarius and Justinian, new\r\nfeelings arose. The Greeks then looked back on the authentic history of\r\nBelisarius as they did on that of Scipio and Sylla,--as a history\r\nunconnected with their own national glory, but marking the last\r\nconquests which illustrated the annals of the Roman empire, and\r\naffording one of those mighty names admirably adapted\r\n\r\n     \"To point a moral, or adorn a tale.\"\r\n\r\nWe must now endeavour to prove that its use for this purpose, in the\r\nmanner transmitted to us, was subsequent to the accession of Basil the\r\nMacedonian.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the blindness and beggary of Belisarius, as recorded in\r\nthe Greek romance, of which the memory has become a part of the\r\ntradition of Western Europe, was suggested to the novelist by the fate\r\nof Symbat, an Armenian noble in the Byzantine service, who married the\r\ndaughter of the Caesar Bardas, the uncle of the Emperor Michael III. The\r\ncatastrophe of the romance is mentioned by two writers of the twelfth\r\ncentury. One is the anonymous author of a description of Constantinople,\r\nwho was a cotemporary of Zonaras. The other is John Tzetzes, who wrote a\r\nrambling work consisting of mythological and historical notices in Greek\r\npolitical, civil, or profane verse, as it may be called, (_versus\r\npolitici_)--the epic poetry of modern Greece; correctly compared by Lord\r\nByron to the heroic strain of\r\n\r\n     \"A captain bold of Halifax who lived in country quarters.\"\r\n\r\nThis poet flourished at the end of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous Guide-Book, relates that Justinian, envying the glory of\r\nBelisarius, put out his eyes, and ordered him to be placed in the Lauron\r\nwith a bowl of earthenware in his hand, that the charitable might bestow\r\non him an obolus.[48] Tzetzes repeats the same story in his learned\r\ndoggrel, only he gives Belisarius a wooden dish in his hand, and\r\nstations him to beg in the Milion or Stadium of Constantinople. But\r\nTzetzes, who piqued himself on his historical knowledge, candidly tells\r\nhis readers, that other chronicles say that Belisarius was restored to\r\nall his former honours.[49]\r\n\r\nThe notices of a Greek guide-book, and the tales of a popular versifier,\r\nconcerning a Roman general, ought certainly to be received with great\r\ncaution, when they are found to be at variance with all historical\r\nevidence. In this case, tradition cannot be admitted to have had any\r\nexistence for many centuries after the death of Belisarius. The supposed\r\ntradition is Greek,--the authentic history is Roman. But historical\r\nevidence exists to show that all the details concerning the blindness\r\nand beggary of Belisarius have been copied by the author of the romance,\r\nfrom circumstances which occurred at Constantinople in the year 866.\r\n\r\nIn that year, the Armenian, Symbat, after assisting his wife's cousin\r\nthe Emperor Michael III. (who rejoiced in the jolly epithet of the\r\nDrunkard,) and the future emperor Basil the Macedonian, (who\r\nsubsequently murdered his patron the Drunkard,) to assassinate his own\r\nfather-in-law Caesar Bardas, rebelled against his connexion the\r\nDrunkard.[50] He engaged Peganes, the general of the theme of Opsikion,\r\nor the provinces on the Asiatic shore of the Hellespont, in his\r\nrebellion. Peganes was soon taken prisoner by the imperial troops, and\r\nthe Drunkard ordered his eyes to be put out and his nose to be cut off,\r\nand he then sent him to stand in the Milion for three days successively,\r\nwith a bowl in his hand, to solicit alms. A month after, the news that\r\nSymbat was captured was brought to the emperor, while he was feasting in\r\nthe palace of St Mamas. He ordered Peganes to be led out to meet the new\r\nprisoner, that Symbat might be conducted into Constantinople with every\r\npossible indignity. The blind and mutilated Peganes was compelled to\r\nwalk before his friend, with a bowl of earthenware in the form of a\r\ncenser, filled with sulphur, as if burning incense to perfume him. The\r\nright eye of Symbat was put out, and his right hand cut off, and in this\r\nstate he was placed in the Lauron, like a beggar, with a bowl hung\r\nbefore his breast to receive charity. Three days after, the two rebels\r\nwere allowed to return to their houses, where they were kept prisoners.\r\nSymbat regained possession of his sequestered fortune when Basil the\r\nMacedonian became emperor.\r\n\r\nNow, even if we admit the possibility of the politic Justinian having\r\ntreated Belisarius as Michael the Drunkard treated the unprincipled\r\nSymbat, still it is impossible to compare the words in which the\r\nGuide-book and Tzetzes commemorate the misfortunes of the hero with the\r\nnarratives of the punishment of Peganes and Symbat, without feeling that\r\nthe former are transcribed from the latter.\r\n\r\nTo prove this, if necessary, we could quote the words of our\r\nauthorities. The earliest account of the punishment of Peganes and\r\nSymbat is given by George the Monk, a Byzantine writer whose chronicle\r\nends with the year 920. The chronicle of Simeon Metaphrastes, which also\r\nbelongs to the tenth century, and that of Leo Grammaticus, give the same\r\naccount, almost in the same words. There can be no doubt that they are\r\nall copied from official documents; the style is a rich specimen of the\r\nmonastic state-paper abridgment.[51]\r\n\r\nThe state-paper style was retained in the romance from which the\r\nGuide-book was copied, to impress the feeling of reality on the minds of\r\nthe people; while the mention of the obolus, an ancient coin, marked\r\nthe antique dignity with which the tale was invested. The obolus had\r\nbeen, for centuries, unknown in the coinage of Constantinople; and the\r\nword was no longer in use in the public markets of Greece. But besides\r\nthis, if the Guide-book is to be admitted as an authority for a\r\nhistorical fact, it very soon destroys the value of its own testimony\r\nconcerning the blindness and beggary of Belisarius; for, only a few\r\nlines after recording his disgrace, it mentions a gilt statue of the\r\nhero as standing near the palace of Chalce.\r\n\r\nSuch is fame. The real Belisarius, the hero of the history and the\r\nlibels of Procopius, being a Roman general, owes his universal\r\nreputation to the creation of an imaginary Belisarius by some unknown\r\nGreek romance-writer or ballad-singer. The interest of mankind in the\r\nconquests and records of Byzantine Rome has become torpid; but the\r\nfeelings of humanity, in favour of the victims of courtly ingratitude,\r\nare immortal. The unextinguishable aversion of the Hellenic race to\r\ntyranny and oppression, has given a degree of fame to the name of\r\nBelisarius which his own deeds, great as they were, would never have\r\nconferred. This is but one proof of the singular influence exercised by\r\nthe Hellenic mind over the rest of the world during the middle ages. It\r\nmay be continually traced in the literature both of the east and the\r\nwest. Whenever the sympathies are awakened by general sentiments of\r\nphilanthropy among the emirs of the east, or the barons of the west,\r\nthere is reason to suspect that the origin of the tale must be sought in\r\nGreece. Europe has been guided by the mind of Hellas in every age, from\r\nthe days of Homer to those of Tzetzes; and its power has been maintained\r\nby addressing the feelings common to the whole human race--feelings long\r\ncherished in Greece after they had been banished from western society by\r\nGoths, Franks, and Normans.[52]\r\n\r\nThere is yet one important reflection which, if the study of the age of\r\nBelisarius and Justinian does not suggest, we have failed to comprehend\r\nits true spirit. In spite of its glory--of its legislative, its legal,\r\nits military, its administrative, its architectural, and its\r\necclesiastical greatness, it was destitute of that spiritual power which\r\nrules and guides the souls of men. It was an age entirely material and\r\nselfish. Religion was a mere formula: Christianity slept victorious\r\namidst the ruins of extinguished paganism. Belisarius could depose one\r\nPope, and sell the chair and the keys of St Peter to another, without\r\nrousing the indignation of the Christian world. Liberty was an\r\nincomprehensible term. That energy of individual independence and\r\nphysical force which excited the barbarians of the north to conquer the\r\nwestern empire, and enabled the Romans of Byzantium to save the eastern,\r\nwas sinking into lethargy. Patriotism was an unknown feeling. Indeed,\r\nwhat idea of nationality or love of country could be formed by the\r\nprivileged classes of Constantinople? Their successors the Turks may be\r\ntaken as interpreters of the sentiments of the Byzantine Romans on this\r\nsubject, who, while vegetating in Stamboul, gravely tell you that Mecca\r\nis their country.\r\n\r\nIn short, the spirit of liberty and religion was torpid in the empire of\r\nJustinian, and perhaps in the soul of Belisarius. These two remarkable\r\nmen were both governed by the material impulses of military discipline\r\nand systematic administration. Verily, the mission of Mahomet was\r\nnecessary to awaken mankind, and rouse the Christian world from its\r\nlethargy to the great mental struggle which, from the hour of the\r\nunfolding of the banner of Islam, has left the minds of men no repose;\r\nand will henceforth compel them to unite the spirit of religion with all\r\ntheir restless endeavours to realise each successive dream of social\r\nimprovement that the human soul shall dare to conceive.\r\n\r\n    _Athens, March 20, 1847._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] _Procopius de Bello Vandalico_, lib. i. c. 11.

The whole scene could hardly fail to\r\nproduce a profound impression on the coolest spectator, even in that\r\nage, when men were more accustomed to stabbing than in our delicate days\r\nof gunshot wounds.

(See _Ibid._ iv. 13.)\r\n\r\n[29] Ildiger, doubtless a barbarian, from his name, was married to a\r\ndaughter of Antonina by her first husband.--(_De Bello Vandalico_, ii.\r\n8.) Valerian was also probably a barbarian, as he commanded a division\r\nof federate cavalry in the African war. He was general of the right wing\r\nof the Roman army under Narses at the battle of Taginas or Lentagio,\r\nwhich put an end to the life of the gallant Totila, and gave the mortal\r\nwound to the monarchy of the Ostrogoths.--(_De Bello Gotthico_, iv. 31.)\r\n\r\n[30] Procopius would lead us to believe that a fine of 300 lbs. of gold\r\n(upwards of L140,000 in specie, and twice that sum in value) extorted\r\nfrom Belisarius in 543, was the produce of his profits during the\r\nAsiatic campaigns of 541 and 542.

Capodistrias lighted his pipe\r\nwith Canning's treaties and King Leopold's renunciation; and Colettis\r\nmakes game of the feeble acts and strong expressions of Viscount\r\nPalmerston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT AND MODERN BALLAD POETRY.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day of April is a festival too prominent in the Kalendar of\r\nMomus to be passed over without due commemoration. The son of Nox, who,\r\naccording to that prince of heralds, Hesiod, presides especially over\r\nthe destinies of reviewers, demands a sacrifice at our hands; and as, in\r\nthe present state of the provision market, we cannot afford to squander\r\na steer, we shall sally forth into the regions of rhyme and attempt to\r\ncapture a versifier.\r\n\r\nThe time has been when such a task was, to say the least of it, very\r\nsimple. Each successive spring, at the season when \"a livelier iris\r\nglows upon the burnished dove,\" Parnassus sent forth its leaves, and the\r\nvoices of many cuckoos were heard throughout the land. Small difficulty\r\nthen, either to flush or to bag sufficient game. But, somehow or other,\r\nof late years there has been a sort of panic among the poets. The\r\ngentler sort have either been scared by the improvisatore warblings of\r\nMr Wakley, or terrified into silence by undue and undeserved\r\napprehensions of the Knout. Seldom now are they heard to chirrup except\r\nunder cover of the leaves of a sheltering magazine; and although we do\r\noccasionally detect a thin and ricketty octavo taking flight from the\r\ncounter of some publisher, it is of so meek and inoffensive a kind that\r\nwe should as soon think of making prize of a thrush in a bed of\r\nstrawberries. We are much afraid that the tendency of the present age\r\ntowards the facetious has contributed not a little to the dearth of\r\nsonnets and the extermination of the elegiac stanza. So long as friend\r\nMichael Angelo Titmarsh has the privilege of frequenting the house of\r\nMrs Perkins and other haunts of fashionable and literary celebrity,\r\nPoseidon Hicks will relapse into gloomy silence, and Miss Bunion refrain\r\nfrom chanting her Lays of the Shattered Heart-strings. It a hard thing\r\nthat a poet may not protrude his gentle sorrows for our commiseration,\r\nmourn over his blighted hopes, or rejoice the bosom of some budding\r\nvirgin by celebrating her, in his Tennysonian measure, as the\r\nlight-tressed Ianthe or sleek-haired Claribel of his soul, without being\r\nimmediately greeted by a burst of impertinent guffaws, and either\r\nwantonly parodied or profanely ridiculed to his face. So firm is our\r\nbelief in the humanising influence of poetry that we would rather, by a\r\nthousand times, that all the reviews should perish, and all the\r\nsatirists be consigned to Orcus, than behold the total cessation of song\r\nthroughout the British Islands. And if we, upon any former occasion,\r\nhave spoken irreverently of the Nincompoops, we now beg leave to tender\r\nto that injured body our heartfelt contrition for the same; and invite\r\nthem to join with us in a pastoral pilgrimage to Arcadia, where they\r\nshall have the run of the meadows, with a fair allowance of pipes and\r\nall things needful--where they may rouse a satyr from every bush,\r\nscamper over the hills in pursuit of an Oread, or take a sly vizzy at a\r\nwater-nymph arranging her tresses in the limpid fountains of the\r\nAlpheus. What say you, our masters and mistresses, to this proposal for\r\na summer ramble?\r\n\r\nHitherto we have spoken merely of the gentler section of the bards. But\r\nthere is another division of that august body by no means quite so\r\ndiffident. Since our venerated Father Christopher paid, some four years\r\nago, a merited tribute to the genius of Mr Macaulay, commenting upon the\r\nthews and sinews of his verse, and the manly vigour of his Lays of\r\nAncient Rome--ballad poetry in all its forms and ramifications has\r\nbecome inconceivably rampant. The Scottish poetry also, which from time\r\nto time has appeared in MAGA, seems to have excited, in certain\r\nquarters, a spirit of larcenous admiration; and not long ago it was our\r\ngood fortune to behold in the Quarterly Review a laudation of certain\r\nlines which are neither more nor less than a weak dilution of a ballad\r\ncomposed by one of our contributors. It would be well, however, had we\r\nnothing more to complain of than this. But the ballad fever has got to\r\nsuch a height that it may be necessary to make an example. Our young\r\nEnglish poets are now emulating in absurdity those German students, who\r\ndress after the costume of the middle ages as depicted by Cornelius, and\r\nterrify the peaceful Cockney on the Rhine by apparitions of Goetz of\r\nBerlichingen. They are no longer Minnesingers, but warriors of\r\nsanguineous complexion. They are all for glory, blood, chivalry, and the\r\ndeeds of their ancestors. They cut, thrust, and foin as fiercely as\r\nfifty Francalanzas, and are continually shouting on Saint George. Dim\r\nideas of the revival of the Maltese Order seem to float before their\r\nexcited imaginations; and, were there the slightest spark of genuine\r\nfeeling in their enthusiasm, either Abd-el-Kader or Marshal Bugeaud\r\nwould have had by this time some creditable recruits. But the fact is,\r\nthat the whole system is a sham. Our young friends care about as much\r\nfor Saint George as they do for Saint Thomas Aquinas; they would think\r\ntwice before they permitted themselves to be poked at with an unbuttoned\r\nfoil; and as for the deeds of their ancestors, a good many of them would\r\nhave considerable difficulty in establishing their descent even from a\r\ncreditable slop-seller--\"the founder of our family\"--in the reign of\r\nGeorge the Third. It is therefore a mystery to us why they should\r\npersevere in their delusion. What--in the name of the Bend\r\nSinister--have they to do with the earlier Harrys or Edwards, or the\r\ncharge of the Templars at Ascalon, or the days of the Saxon Heptarchy?\r\nAre they called upon by some irrepressible impulse to ransack the pages\r\nof English history for a \"situation,\" or to crib from the Chronicles of\r\nFroissart? Cannot they let the old warriors rest in peace, without\r\nsummoning them, like the Cid, from their honoured graves, again to put\r\non harness and to engage in feckless combat? For oh!--weak and most\r\nwashy are the battles which our esteemed young friends describe! Their\r\nwar-horses have for the most part a general resemblance to the hacks\r\nhired out at seven-and-sixpence for the Sunday exhibition in the Park.\r\nTheir armour is of that kind more especially in vogue at Astley's, in\r\nthe composition of which tinfoil is a principal ingredient, and\r\npasteboard by no means awanting. Their heroes fight, after preliminary\r\nparley which would do credit to the chivalry of the Hippodrome; and\r\ntheir lances invariably splinter as frush as the texture of the\r\nbullrush. Their dying chiefs all imitate Bayard, as we once saw\r\nWiddecomb do it, when struck down by the infuriated Gomersal; and the\r\npoem generally concludes with a devout petition to \"Our Ladye,\" not only\r\nto vouchsafe her grace to the defunct champion, but to grant that the\r\nliving minstrel may experience the same end--a prayer which, for the\r\nsake of several respectable young members of society, we hope may be\r\nutterly disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that instead of being the easiest, the ballad is\r\nincomparably the most difficult kind of all poetical composition. Many\r\nmen, who were not poets in the highest sense of the word, because they\r\nwanted the inventive faculty, have nevertheless, by dint of\r\nperseverance, great accomplishment, and dexterous use of those materials\r\nwhich are ready to the hand of every artificer, gained a respectable\r\nname in the roll of British literature--but never, in any single\r\ninstance, by attempting the construction of a ballad. That is the\r\nShibboleth, by which you can at once distinguish the true minstrel from\r\nmere impostor or pretender. It is the simplest, and at the same time the\r\nsublimest form of poetry, nor can it be written except under the\r\ninfluence of that strong and absorbing emotion, which bears the poet\r\naway far from the present time, makes him an actor and a participator in\r\nthe vivid scenes which he describes, and which is, in fact, inspiration\r\nof the very loftiest kind. The few who enjoy the glorious privilege, not\r\noften felt, nor long conferred, of surrendering themselves to the magic\r\nof that spell, cease for the time to be artists; they take no thought of\r\nornament, or of any rhetorical artifice, but throw themselves headlong\r\ninto their subject, trusting to nature for that language which is at\r\nonce the shortest and the most appropriate to the occasion; spurning all\r\nfar-fetched metaphors aside, and ringing out their verse as the iron\r\nrings upon the anvil! It was in this way that Homer, the great old\r\nballad-maker of Greece, wrote--or rather chanted, for in his day pens\r\nwere scarce, wire-wove unknown, and the pride of Moseley undeveloped.\r\nGod had deprived the blind old man of sight; but in his heart still\r\nburned the fury of the fight of Troy; and trow ye not, that to him the\r\nsilent hills of Crete many a time became resonant with the clang of\r\narms, and the shouts of challenging heroes, when not a breath of wind\r\nwas stirring, and the ibex stood motionless on its crag? What a\r\ndifference between Homer and Virgil! Moeonides goes straight to work,\r\nlike a marshal calling out his men. He moves through the encampment of\r\nthe ships, knowing every man by headmark, and estimating his\r\ncapabilities to a buffet. No metaphor or nonsense in the combats that\r\nrage around the sepulchre of Ilus--good hard fighting all of it, as\r\nbefits barbarians, in whose veins the blood of the danger-seeking\r\ndemigods is seething: fierce as wild beasts they meet together, smite,\r\nhew, and roll over in the dust. Jove may mourn for Sarpedon, or\r\nAndromache tear her hair above the body of her slaughtered Hector; but\r\nnot one whit on that account abstain their comrades from the banquet,\r\nand on the morrow, under other leaders, they will renew the battle--for\r\nman is but as the leaves of the forest, whilst glory abideth for ever.\r\n\r\nVirgil, on the contrary, had but little of the ballad-maker in his\r\ncomposition. He was always thinking of himself, and of his art, and the\r\neffect which his AEneid would produce,--nay, we are even inclined to\r\nsuspect that at times he was apt to deviate into a calculation of the\r\nnumber of sestertia which he might reasonably reckon to receive from the\r\nbounty of the Emperor. The AEneid is upon the whole a sneaking sort of a\r\npoem. The identity of AEneas with Augustus, and the studied\r\npersonification of every leading character, is too apparent to be\r\ndenied. It is therefore less an epic than an allegory; and--without\r\nquestioning the truth of Hazlitt's profound apothegm, that allegories do\r\nnot bite--we confess that, in general, we have but small liking to that\r\nspecies of composition. For in the first place, the author of an\r\nallegory strips himself of the power of believing it. He can have no\r\nfaith in the previous existence of heroes whom he is purposely\r\nportraying as shadows, and he must constantly be put to shifts, in order\r\nto adapt his story, during its progress, to the circumstances which he\r\nattempts to typify. And, in the second place, he commits the error,\r\nequally palpable, of disenchanting the eyes of his reader. For the very\r\nessence of that pleasure which we all derive from fiction, lies in our\r\novercoming to a certain extent the idea of its actual falsity, and in\r\nour erecting within ourselves a sort of secondary belief, to which,\r\naccordingly, our sympathies are submitted. Every thing, therefore, which\r\ninterferes with this fair and legitimate credulity is directly noxious\r\nto the effect of the poem; it puts us back one stage further from the\r\npoint of absolute faith, and materially diminishes the interest which we\r\ntake in the progress of the piece. Spenser's Faerie Queen is a notable\r\nexample of this. Could we but think that Una was intended, though only\r\nby the poet's fancy, to be the portraiture of a mortal virgin,\r\nunfriended and alone amidst the snares and enchantments of the world,\r\nwould we not tremble for her sweet sake, knowing that some as innocent\r\nand as fair as she have fallen victims to jealousy less dark than\r\nDuessa's, and wiles less skilfully prepared than those of the hoary\r\nArchimage? But Una never for one moment appears to us as a woman. From\r\nthe first we feel that she is there, not exposed to temptation, but as a\r\npure and holy spirit, in whose presence hypocrisy is unmasked, and all\r\nsin and iniquity unveiled. Nor fear we for the Red-Cross Knight, even\r\nwhen he seems to go astray, and turns from the side of her whom he had\r\nsworn to protect and guard; for he bears a talisman upon his shield and\r\nhis bosom, expressive of his origin, and able to resist for ever the\r\nfiery darts of the wicked. Never rode knight and lady through earthly\r\nwilderness as these two journey together. For them we have no human\r\ninterest--not even such tears as we might shed for the lapse of an\r\nerring angel. They have not put on mortality, nor do they meet or combat\r\nwith mortal foes. Truth will do much for us, even in poetry where the\r\nmortal interest is most largely intermingled with the supernatural. Some\r\nbelief we have even in the wildest flights of Ariosto. Astolfo does not\r\ncease to be one of ourselves when traversing the regions of air on his\r\nhippogriff, or conversing on the mount of terrestial Paradise with the\r\nbeloved Apostle John. But which of us even in fancy can ride with the\r\nRed-Cross warrior, penetrate with Guyon into the cave of Mammon, or\r\nrealise the dreary pageant that issued from the House of Pride?\r\n\r\nSpenser's is the purer allegory--Virgil's but a secondary one. The AEneid\r\nis a hybrid poem, wherein the real and the ideal mingle. There is\r\nsufficient of the first to preserve for us some epic interest, and\r\nenough of the latter at times to stagger our belief. But apart from\r\nthis, how inferior is the AEneid in interest to the masterpiece of Homer!\r\nIt consists, epically speaking, of three divisions--the landing at\r\nCarthage, the Sicilian visit to Acestes, and the final campaign of\r\nItaly--and the two first of these have no bearing at all upon the third,\r\nand even that third is incomplete. Whatever homage we may be compelled\r\nto pay to the sweetness of Virgil's muse, and his marvellous power of\r\nmelody, this at least is undeniable, that in inventive genius he falls\r\nimmeasurably short of the Greek, and that his scenes of action are at\r\nonce both tinselled and tame. One magnificent exception, it is true, we\r\nare bound to make from such a censure. The second book of the AEneid\r\nstands out in strong and vivid contrast from the rest; and few poets,\r\nwhether ancient or modern, have written aught like the conflagration of\r\nTroy. Nor shall we, with the severer critics, darkly hint of works which\r\nhad gone before, but of which the substance long ago has perished--of\r\nthe Cyclic poem of Arctinus, said to have been of all others the nearest\r\nin point of energy to the Iliad, or of the songs of Lesches and\r\nEuphorion. Rather let us be thankful for this one episode, without which\r\nthe great tale of Ilium would have been incomplete, and the lays of\r\nDemodocus in the Odyssey remained mere hints of the woful catastrophe of\r\nPriam. But if you wish to see how Homer could handle a ballad, turn up\r\nthe eighth book of your Odyssey until you come to the Minstrel's son--or\r\nif haply you are somewhat rusted in your Greek, and yearn for the aid of\r\nDonnegan, listen to the noble version of Maginn, who alone of all late\r\ntranslators has caught the true fire and spirit of Moeonides.\r\n\r\n    \"The Minstrel began as the Godhead inspired:\r\n    He sang how their leaguer the Argives had fired,\r\n    And over the sea in trim barks bent their course,\r\n    While their chiefs with Odysseus were closed in the horse,\r\n    Mid the Trojans who had that fell engine of wood\r\n    Dragged on, till in Troy's inmost turret it stood;\r\n    There long did they ponder in anxious debate\r\n    What to do with the steed as around it they sate.\r\n\r\n    Then before them three several counsels were laid:\r\n    Into pieces to hew it by the edge of the blade;\r\n    Or to draw it forth thence to the brow of the rock,\r\n    And downward to fling it with shivering shock;\r\n    Or, shrined in the tower, let it there make abode\r\n    As an offering to ward off the anger of God.\r\n    The last counsel prevail'd; for the moment of doom,\r\n    When the town held the horse, upon Ilium had come.\r\n\r\n    The Argives in ambush awaited the hour\r\n    When slaughter and death on their foes they should shower.\r\n    When it came, from their hollow retreat rushing down\r\n    The sons of th' Achivi smote sorely the town.\r\n    Then, scattered, on blood and on ravaging bent,\r\n    Through all parts of the city chance-guided they went.\r\n    And he sung how Odysseus at once made his way\r\n    To where the proud towers of Deiphobus lay.\r\n\r\n    With bold Menelaus he thitherward strode,\r\n    In valour in equal to War's fiery god,\r\n    Then fierce was the fight--dread the deeds that were done,\r\n    Till, aided by Pallas, the battle he won.\r\n    So sung the rapt Minstrel the blood-stirring tale,\r\n    But the check of Odysseus waxed deadly and pale;\r\n    While the song warbled on of the days that were past,\r\n    His eyelids were wet with the tears falling fast.[54]\"\r\n\r\nIf we go on twaddling thus about the Greeks and Romans, we shall lose\r\nthe thread of our discourse, and possibly be found tripping on the\r\nsubject of Wolf's _Prolegomena_. Let us, therefore, get back as fast as\r\nwe can to the Moderns.\r\n\r\nUnless the poet is imbued with a deep sympathy for his subject, we would\r\nnot give sixpence for his chance of producing a tolerable ballad. Nay,\r\nwe go further, and aver that he ought when possible to write in the\r\nunscrupulous character of a partisan. In historical and martial ballads,\r\nthere always must be two sides; and it is the business of the poet to\r\nadopt one of these with as much enthusiasm and prejudice, as if his life\r\nand fortunes depended upon the issue of the cause. For the ballad is the\r\nreflex of keen and rapid sensation, and has nothing to do with judgment\r\nor with calm deliberative justice. It should embody, from beginning to\r\nend, one fiery absorbing passion, such as men feel when their blood is\r\nup, and their souls thoroughly roused within them; and we should as soon\r\nthink of moralising in a ballad as in the midst of a charge of cavalry.\r\nIf you are a Cavalier, write with the zeal of a Cavalier combating for\r\nhis king at Naseby, and do not disgust us with melancholy whinings about\r\nthe desolate hearths of the Ironsides. Forget for a time that you are a\r\nshareholder in a Life Assurance Company, and cleave to your immediate\r\nbusiness of emptying as many saddles as possible. If you are out--as\r\nperhaps your great-grandfather was--with Prince Charles at Prestonpans,\r\ndo not, we beseech you, desert the charging column of the Camerons, to\r\ncry the coronach over poor old Colonel Gardiner, fetched down from his\r\nhorse by the Lochaber axe of the grim Miller of Invernahyle. Let him\r\nhave the honourable burial of a brave man when the battle is over;\r\nbut--whilst the shouts of victory are ringing in our ears, and the tail\r\nof Cope's horse is still visible over the knowe which rises upon the\r\nBerwick road--leave the excellent Seceder upon the sod, and toss up your\r\nbonnet decorated with the White Rose, to the glory and triumph of the\r\nclans! If you are a Covenanter and a Whig, we need not entreat you to\r\npepper Claverhouse and his guardsmen to the best of your ability at\r\nDrumclog. You are not likely to waste much of your time in lamentations\r\nover the slaughtered Archbishop: and if you must needs try your hand at\r\nthe execution of Argyle, do not mince the matter, but make a regular\r\nmartyr of him at once. In this way should all ballads be written; and\r\nsuch indeed is the true secret of the craft as transmitted to us by the\r\nmasters of old.\r\n\r\nWe have warned you against moralising: let us now say a word or two on\r\nthe subjects of description and declamation. Upon one or other of these\r\nrocks, have most of our modern ballad-writers struck and foundered. What\r\ncan be in worse taste than the introduction of an elaborate landscape\r\ninto the midst of a poem of action, or an elaborate account of a man's\r\naccoutrements when he is fighting for life or death? A single epithet,\r\nif it be a choice one, can indicate the scene of action as vividly and\r\nfar more effectively than ten thousand stanzas; and, unless you are a\r\ntailor and proud of your handiwork, what is the use of dilating upon the\r\ncomplexion of a warrior's breeches, when the claymore is whistling\r\naround his ears? Nevertheless, even our best ballad-writers, when their\r\nsoul was not in their task, have fallen into this palpable error. None\r\nof Sir Walter's ballads commences more finely than \"The Gray\r\nBrother,\"--none has been more spoiled in its progress by the\r\nintroduction of minute description. We pass from the high altar of Saint\r\nPeter to the bank of the Eske, and there we are regaled with a catalogue\r\nof the modern seats and villas, utterly out of place and inconsistent\r\nwith the solemn nature of the theme. But \"The Gray Brother\" is a mere\r\nfragment which Scott never would complete--owing, perhaps, to a secret\r\nconsciousness, that he had already marred the unity of the poem by\r\nsketching in a modern landscape behind his antique figures. Give him,\r\nhowever, a martial subject--let his eye but once kindle, and his cheek\r\nflush at the call of the trumpet, and we defy you to find his equal.\r\nRead--O ye poetasters who are now hammering at Crecy--read the \"Bonnets\r\nof Dundee,\" and then, if you have a spark of candour left, you will\r\nshove your foolscap into the fire. Or tell us if you really flatter\r\nyourselves that, were your lives prolonged to the perpetuity of the\r\nvenerable Parr, you ever would produce ten stanzas worthy of being\r\nprinted in the same volume with these:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Coronach's cried on Bennachie,\r\n      And down the Don and a',\r\n    And Hieland and Lawland may mournfu' be,\r\n      For the sair field of Harlaw.\r\n\r\n    They saddled a hundred milk-white steeds,\r\n      They hae saddled a hundred black,\r\n    With a chafron of steel on each horse's head,\r\n      And a good knight upon his back.\r\n\r\n    They hadna ridden a mile, a mile,\r\n      A mile, but barely ten,\r\n    When Donald came branking down the brae,\r\n      Wi' twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\n    Their tartans they were waving wide,\r\n      Their glaives were glancing clear,\r\n    The pibrochs rung frae side to side,\r\n      Would deafen you to hear.\r\n\r\n    The great Earl in his stirrups stood,\r\n      That Highland host to see;\r\n    'Now here a knight that's stout and good,\r\n      May prove a jeopardie.\r\n\r\n    'What would ye do, my squire so gay,\r\n      That rides beside my rein,\r\n    Were ye Glenallan's Earl this day,\r\n      And I were Roland Cheyne?\r\n\r\n    'To turn the rein were sin and shame,\r\n      To fright were wondrous peril:\r\n    What would ye do now, Roland Cheyne,\r\n      Were ye Glenallan's Earl?'\r\n\r\n    'Were I Glenallan's Earl this tide,\r\n      And ye were Roland Cheyne,\r\n    The spear should be in my horse's side,\r\n      The bridle upon his mane.\r\n\r\n    'If they hae twenty thousand blades,\r\n      And we twice ten times ten,\r\n    Yet they hae but their tartan plaids,\r\n      And we are mail-clad men.\r\n\r\n    'My horse shall ride through ranks sae rude,\r\n      As through the moorland fern,\r\n    Then ne'er let gentle Norman blude\r\n      Grow cauld for Hieland kerne!'\"\r\n\r\nScott was no declaimer. Although bred a barrister, he estimated the\r\nfaculty of speech at its proper value, and never thought of making his\r\nheroes, on the eve of battle, address their soldiery in a harangue which\r\nwould do credit to a President of the Speculative Society. In certain\r\npositions, eloquence is not only thrown away, but is felt to be rank\r\nimpertinence. No need of rhetorical artifice to persuade the mob to the\r\npumping of a pickpocket, or, in case of a general row, to the assault of\r\nan intoxicated policeman. Such things come quite naturally to their\r\nhands without exhortation, and it is dangerous to interfere with\r\ninstinct. The Homeric heroes are, of any thing, a little too much given\r\nto talking. You observe two hulking fellows, in all their panoply of\r\nshield and armour, drawing nigh to one another at the fords of the\r\nScamander, each with a spear about the size of a moderate ash-tree\r\nacross his shoulder. The well-greaved Greek, you already know, is deep\r\nin the confidences of Minerva; the hairy Trojan, on the contrary, is\r\nprotected by the Lady Venus. You expect an immediate onslaught; when, to\r\nyour astonishment, the Greek politely craves some information touching a\r\ngenealogical point in the history of his antagonist's family; whereat\r\nthe other, nothing loath, indulges him with a yarn about Assaracus. Tros\r\nbeing out of breath, the Argive can do nothing less than proffer a\r\nbouncer about Hercules; so that, for at least half an hour, they stand\r\nlying like a brace of Sinbads--whilst Ajax, on the right, is spearing\r\nhis proportion of the Dardans, and Sarpedon doing equal execution among\r\nthe unfortunate Achivi on the left. Nor, until either warrior has\r\nexhausted his patriarchal reminiscences, do they heave up the boss and\r\nthe bull-hide, or make play for a thrust at the midriff. Now, unless the\r\ngenealogy of their opponents was a point of honour with the\r\nancients--which it does not appear to have been--these colloquies seem a\r\nlittle out of place. In the middle ages, a knight would not enter the\r\nlists against an opponent of lesser rank; and in such a case,\r\nexplanation is intelligible. But in battle there was no distinction of\r\nranks, and no man cared a stiver about the birth and parentage of\r\nanother. Genealogies, in fact, are awkward things, and should be\r\neschewed by gentlemen in familiar discourse, as tending much less\r\ntowards edification than offence. Many people are absurdly jealous on\r\nthe subject of their coffined sires; nor is it wise in convivial moments\r\nto strike up an ancestral ditty to the tune of--\r\n\r\n    \"Green grows the grass o'er the graves of my governors.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an unfortunate accident of this kind which led to the battle of\r\nthe Reidswire.\r\n\r\n    \"Carmichael bade him speak out plainly,\r\n    And cloke no cause for ill nor gude;\r\n    The other, answering him as vainly,\r\n      _Began to reckon kin and blude._\r\n    He rase, and raxed him, where he stude,\r\n      And bade him match him with his marrows:\r\n    Then Tynedale heard them reason rude,\r\n      And they loot off a flight of arrows.\"\r\n\r\nScott's heroes are unusually terse and taciturn. They know their\r\nbusiness better than to talk when they should be up and doing; and\r\naccordingly, with them, it is just a word and a blow.\r\n\r\n    \"But no whit weary did he seem,\r\n    When, dancing in the sunny beam,\r\n    He marked the crane on the Baron's crest;\r\n    For his ready spear was in its rest.\r\n    Few were the words, and stern and high,\r\n    That marked the foemen's feudal hate;\r\n    For question fierce and proud reply,\r\n    Gave signal soon of dire debate.\r\n    Their very coursers seem'd to know,\r\n    That each was other's mortal foe,\r\n    And snorted fire, when wheel'd around,\r\n    To give each knight his vantage ground.\r\n\r\n    In rapid round the Baron bent;\r\n    He sighed a sigh, and pray'd a prayer;\r\n    The prayer was to his patron saint--\r\n    The sigh was to his ladye fair.\r\n    Stout Deloraine nor sigh'd nor pray'd,\r\n    Nor saint nor ladye called to aid;\r\n    But he stoop'd his head, and couch'd his spear,\r\n    And spurr'd his stead to full career.\r\n    The meeting of these champions proud\r\n    Seem'd like the bursting thunder-cloud.\"\r\n\r\nThis, you observe, is practical eloquence,--the perfect pantomime of\r\nrhetoric; and, when your eyes have recovered the dazzling shock of the\r\nencounter, you shall see William of Deloraine lying on the green sward,\r\nwith the Baron's spear-head sunk a foot within his bosom. Nothing, in\r\nshort, can be more conclusive or satisfactory.\r\n\r\nLet us now take an instance to the contrary. Few men have written with\r\nmore fire and energy than Mr Macaulay; and, in the heart of a battle, he\r\nhandles his falchion like a Legionary. Still, every now and then, the\r\nrhetorician peeps out in spite of himself, and he goes through the\r\ncatalogue of the topics. Nothing can be better or more ballad-like than\r\nthe blunt declaration by Horatius of his readiness to keep the bridge:--\r\n\r\n    \"Then out spoke bold Horatius,\r\n      The captain of the gate:\r\n    'To every man upon this earth\r\n      Death cometh soon or late;\r\n    And how can man die better\r\n      Than facing fearful odds,\r\n    For the ashes of his fathers,\r\n      And the temples of his gods?'\"\r\n\r\nNot one other word should stout old Cocles have uttered, of apology for\r\nclaiming to himself the post of danger and of death. No higher motive\r\nneed he have assigned than those contained in the last two lines, which\r\nmust have gone home at once to the heart of every Roman. But the poet\r\nwill not leave him there. He interpolates another stanza, which has the\r\neffect of diluting the strength of the passage.\r\n\r\n    \"'And for the tender mother\r\n      Who dandled him to rest,\r\n    And for the wife who nurses\r\n      Her baby at her breast;\r\n    And for the holy maidens\r\n      Who feed the eternal flame,\r\n    To save them from false Sextus\r\n      That wrought the deed of shame?'\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of this stanza is bad;--the last four lines of it simply and\r\npurely execrable. Mr Macaulay is far too judicious a critic not to be\r\nfully aware of the danger of any weak passage in a short poem of\r\nincident; and we trust, in the next edition, to see this palpable\r\neye-sore removed. But it is in the ballad of Virginia that his besetting\r\ntendency towards declamation becomes most thoroughly apparent. You are\r\nto suppose yourself in the market-place of Rome;--the lictors of\r\nClaudius have seized upon the daughter of the centurion; the people have\r\nrisen in wrath at the outrage; and, for a moment, there is hope of\r\ndeliverance. But the name of the decemvir still carries terror with it,\r\nand the commons waver at the sound. In this crisis, Icilius, the\r\nbetrothed of the virgin, appears, and delivers a long essay of some\r\nfifty double lines, upon the spirit and tendency of the Roman\r\nconstitution. This is a great error. Speeches, when delivered in the\r\nmidst of a popular tumult, must be pithy in order to be effective: nor\r\nwas Appius such an ass as to have lost the opportunity afforded him by\r\nthis dialectic display, of effectually securing his captive.\r\n\r\nThere is no literary legacy the people of Scotland ought to be so\r\nthankful as for their rich inheritance of national ballads. In this\r\nrespect they stand quite unrivalled in Europe; for, although the\r\nScandinavian peninsula has a glorious garland of its own, and Spain and\r\nEngland are both rich in traditionary story, our northern ballad poetry\r\nis wider in its compass, and far more varied in the composition of its\r\nmaterial. The high and heroic war-chant, the deeds of chivalrous\r\nemprise, the tale of unhappy love, the mystic songs of fairy-land,--all\r\nhave been handed down to us, for centuries, unmutilated and unchanged,\r\nin a profusion which is almost marvellous, when we reflect upon the\r\ngreat historic changes and revolutions which have agitated the country.\r\nFor such changes, though tending essentially towards the production of\r\nthe ballad, especially in the historical department, cannot possibly be\r\nfavourable to its preservation; and no stronger proof of the intense\r\nnationality of the people of Scotland can be found than this--that the\r\nsongs commemorative of our earlier heroes have outlived the Reformation,\r\nthe union of the two crowns, the civil and religious wars of the\r\nrevolution, and the subsequent union of the kingdoms; and, at a\r\ncomparatively late period, were collected from the oral traditions of\r\nthe peasantry. Time had it not in its power to chill the memories which\r\nlay warm at the nation's heart, or to efface the noble annals of its\r\nlong and eventful history. There is a spell of potency still in the\r\nnames of the Bruce and the Douglas.\r\n\r\nBy whom those ballads were written, is a question beyond solution. A\r\nlarge portion of them were, we know, composed long before the Press was\r\nin existence--some, probably, may date so far back as the reign of\r\nAlexander the Third--and to their own intrinsic merit are they indebted\r\nfor preservation. But we are in ignorance of the authorship even of\r\nthose which are much nearer to our own immediate period. Much of the\r\nJacobite minstrelsy, and of the songs commemorative, of the Fifteen and\r\nthe Forty-five, is anonymous; and we cannot tell whether those ditties,\r\nwhich have still the power to thrill our hearts so strangely, were\r\nwritten by gentle or by simple, in the hall or by the cottage fire.\r\nAfter all, it matters not. The poet of Otterbourne will be greater\r\nwithout a name, than fifty modern versifiers whom it would be odious to\r\nparticularise, notwithstanding the blazon of their Christian and\r\npatronymic prefix. Better to live for ever innominate in a song, than\r\nto be quoted for a life-time by one's friends, as a self-marked and\r\nimmolated driveller.\r\n\r\n\"Give me,\" said Fletcher of Saltoun, \"the making of a nation's ballads,\r\nand I will let you make its laws.\" This was, in our opinion, a speech of\r\nconsiderable boldness; and if Fletcher really made it, he must have had\r\na high estimate of his own poetical powers. Why then, in the name of\r\nOrpheus, did he not set about it incontinently? We presume that there\r\nwas nothing whatever to have prevented him from concocting as many\r\nballads as he chose; or from engaging, as engines of popular\r\npromulgation, the ancestors of those unshaven and raucous gentlemen, to\r\nwhose canorous mercies we are wont, in times of political excitement, to\r\nintrust our own personal and patriotic ditties. Seldom, indeed, have we\r\nexperienced a keener sense of our true greatness as a poet, than when we\r\nencountered, on one occasion, a peripatetic minstrel, deafening the\r\nCanongate with the notes of our particular music, and surrounded by an\r\neager crowd demanding the halfpenny broadsheet. \"This is fame!\" we\r\nexclaimed to a legal friend who was beside us; and, with a glow of\r\ntriumph on our countenance, we descended the North Bridge, to indite\r\nanother of the same. Notwithstanding this, we cannot aver from\r\nexperience that our ballads have wrought any marked effect in modifying\r\nthe laws of the country. We cannot even go the length of asserting that\r\nthey have once turned an election; and therefore it is not unnatural\r\nthat we should regard the dogma of Fletcher with distrust. The truth is,\r\nthat a nation is the maker of its own ballads. You cannot by any\r\npossibility contrive to sway people from their purpose by a song; but\r\nsongs--ballads especially--are the imperishable records of their\r\npurpose. And therefore it is that they survive, because they are real\r\nand not ideal. It is no feigned passion which they convey, but the\r\nactual reflex of that which has arisen, and wrought, and expended\r\nitself; and each historical ballad is, in fact, a memorial of a national\r\nimpulse; and wo be to the man who would attempt to illustrate the past,\r\nif he cannot again create within himself the sympathies and the motives\r\nwhich led to the deeds he must celebrate. Wo be to him, we say--for as\r\nsure as there is truth in the retributive justice of posterity, he will\r\nattain an eminent position, not in the roll of beatified bards, but in\r\nthat of the British blockheads, and be elected by unanimous consent as a\r\nproper Laureate for the Fogie Club.\r\n\r\nIt is now a good many years since Sir Walter Scott compiled his\r\n_Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border_. Previous to the publication of that\r\nwork, several excellent collections of the older Scottish ballads had\r\nbeen made, and industrious gleaners have since gathered up every stray\r\ntraditionary ear of corn which still lay unnoticed in the furrow. Our\r\nexcellent friend Robert Chambers, availing himself of all these labours,\r\nhas given, in a popular form, the essence and spirit of the whole; nor\r\ndoes there, we believe, exist a single fragment of the least merit which\r\nhas escaped so rigorous a search. We understood that the English ballads\r\nhad long ago been collected. These were neither so numerous nor so\r\nromantic as ours; but they had fallen at a much earlier date into the\r\nhands of the antiquaries, and we hardly expected in our day to be told\r\nof a considerable addition. Therefore it was with no little\r\nastonishment, and some curiosity, that we perused the announcement of a\r\nnew work entitled, \"The Minstrelsy of the English Border; being a\r\ncollection of ballads, ancient, remodelled, and original--founded on\r\nwell-known Border legends. With illustrative notes by Frederick\r\nSheldon.\"\r\n\r\nPredisposed though we certainly were to do every justice to the original\r\nstrains of Mr Sheldon, he will forgive us when we own that the ancient\r\nballads were the primary objects of our quest. We were eager to discover\r\nwhat kind of materials--what snatches of antique song, he had rescued\r\nfrom oblivion among the wild moors of Northumberland; and his preface\r\ngave us ample hope of the choice nature of his budget.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" says Mr Sheldon, alluding to Sir Walter's literary\r\nresearches upon the Border--\"no doubt many ballads _did_ escape, and\r\nstill remain scattered up and down the country side, existing, probably,\r\nin the recollection of many a sun-browned shepherd, or the\r\nweather-beaten brains of ancient hinds, or 'eldern' women; or in the\r\nwell-thumbed and nearly illegible leaves of some old book or pamphlet of\r\nsongs, snugly resting on the 'pot-head,' or sharing their rest with the\r\n'great ha' bible,' 'Scott's Worthies,' or 'Blind Harry's' lines. The\r\nparish dominie, or pastor of some obscure village amid the many nooks\r\nand corners of the Borders, possesses, no doubt, treasures in the ballad\r\nware, that would have gladdened the heart of a Ritson, a Percy, or a\r\nSurtees; in the libraries, too, of many an ancient descendant of a\r\nBorder family, some black-lettered volume of ballads doubtlessly\r\nslumbers in hallowed and unbroken dust. From such sources I have\r\nobtained many of the ballads in the present collection. Those to which I\r\nhave stood godfather, and so baptised and remodelled, I have mostly met\r\nwith in the 'broadside' ballads, as they are called; but notwithstanding\r\ntheir fire and pathos, I found so much obscenity and libertinism mingled\r\nwith their beauties, that I was compelled with a rash hand to pluck the\r\nnettles away that choked the healthy growth of the young, fresh, and\r\nbudding flowers; preserving, as nearly as I could, their ancient\r\nsimplicity and diction. Others, by local and nameless poets, I have\r\ngiven as I found them. Those ballads, virtually my own, are stated to be\r\nso in the notes, and these, with great fear and tribulation, I hang as a\r\nvotive wreath on the altar of the Muses.\" This is explicit and\r\nsatisfactory, and we shall now proceed to see how our author has\r\nredeemed his promise.\r\n\r\nWe have read every one of the thirty-seven ballads contained in this\r\nvolume, and the following is our synoptical view. Of \"original\"\r\nballads--by which Mr Sheldon means those which must be attributed to his\r\nown inspired pen, and which constitute, as aforesaid, his votive\r\nwreath--there are no less than thirteen; four ballads are taken from the\r\nworks of Messrs Mackay, Wilson, Telfer, and Hall--bards who have\r\nflourished during the last twenty years upon the Border; four are\r\n\"remodelled\" by Mr Sheldon; and _sixteen_, having no other\r\ndistinguishing mark upon them, must be set down as \"ancient\"\r\ncompositions. The man who can bestow upon us at the present time sixteen\r\nauthentic and hitherto unknown ballads, is indeed a public benefactor!\r\n\r\nOut of courtesy to Mr Sheldon, we shall, in the first instance, dispose\r\nof his own particular garland; and as it would be a pity to dismember\r\nsuch a posy, we shall merely lay before our readers the following\r\n_morceau_ from the ballad of \"Seton's Sons.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Seton he gaspit and he girn'd,\r\n      And showed his teeth sae whyte,\r\n    His een were glaikit like a man's\r\n      That's strycken wi' affryghte.\r\n\r\n    Quo' he, 'Lorde Percy, dinna think\r\n      I speak your lugs to blaw;\r\n    But let him spare my twa brave sonnes\r\n      And at his feet I'll fa!\r\n\r\n    'And wat them wi' these happing tears\r\n      That wash my auld, auld een,--\r\n    That channel down these wrynkelets,\r\n      Gin he will list bedeen.'\r\n\r\n    'My bairnies,' quo' the mother then,\r\n      'That I have kist sae aft,\r\n    Canna we save them frae their death,\r\n      But sic a pryce we coft?\r\n\r\n    'Thare pretty necks I've slibbered sae\r\n      Ah! Percy, gentil lord,\r\n    To hae them raxed upon a tree,\r\n      And strangled wi' a cord!'\"\r\n\r\nAdmirers of the ancient ballad--what do you say to that? There is the\r\nfine old Scots dialect in all its purity with a vengeance! In what part\r\nof the island such a jargon is spoken, we are fortunately at present\r\nunaware. Certain we are that our fathers never heard it; and as for\r\nourselves, though reasonably cognizant of the varieties of speech which\r\nare current in Gilmerton, Aberdeen, the Crosscauseway and the Gorbals,\r\nwe protest that we never yet met with any thing so cacophonous as this.\r\nIt is impossible, however, to deny Mr Sheldon the merit of pure\r\noriginality. Nobody but himself could have written the first glorious\r\nstanza, which embodies so perfect a picture of despair, or the second,\r\nin which the old familiar phrase of \"blawing intill his lug\" is so\r\nappositely adapted to verse, and put into the mouth of a knightly\r\nScottish commander. Lady Seton, too, is exquisite in her way. The\r\n\"slibbering\" reminiscence--which, we presume, is equivalent to\r\nslobbering--is one of those natural touches which, once uttered, can\r\nnever be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt will, we opine, be sufficient to quench the curiosity of our readers,\r\nwhen we state that the above is a fair average specimen of Mr Sheldon's\r\noriginal productions. We presume that few will thirst for another\r\ndraught from this pitcherful of the Border Helicon; and--as time\r\npresses--we shall now push forward to the consideration of the\r\nremodelled poetry. The first of these is called \"Halidon Hill,\" and, as\r\nwe are informed in the notes, it dates back to the respectable antiquity\r\nof 1827. The following magnificent stanzas will convey some idea of the\r\nspirit and style of that production.\r\n\r\n    Glower'd the Scot down on his foe:\r\n      'Ye coof, I cam not here to ride;\r\n    But syne it is so, give me a horse,\r\n      I'll curry thee thine English hide.'\r\n\r\n    Quod Benhal, 'I cam to fight a man\r\n      And not a blude mastyff,--\r\n    Were ye a man and no a pup,\r\n      Saint Bride I had as lief.'\r\n\r\n    'Foam not, or fret, thou baby knicht,\r\n      _Put some food in thy wame_,\r\n    For thou art but the champion\r\n      Of some fond Norfolk dame.\r\n\r\n    'My dog shall shake thy silken hide,\r\n      Thy brainis prove his fee,\r\n    Gif in that bagie skull of thine\r\n      There any brainis be.'\r\n\r\n    'Thou art a bragging piece of clay,\r\n      Sae fyrst wise prove thy threat;'\r\n    Loud geckit Trummall as he cried,\r\n      'I'll mak' thee haggish meat!!'\"\r\n\r\nYes, reader--you may well stare! but such is absolutely the rubbish\r\nwhich has been shot from the Chiswick Press. Next--hear it, ye powers of\r\nimpudence!--Allan Cunningham's beautiful ballad of Lady Anne, makes its\r\nappearance as \"Lady Nell.\" We need scarcely add that in such hands the\r\nvirgin degenerates into a drab. The other remodelments are trash. The\r\n\"Merchant's Garland\" is a new version by Sheldon of a street ditty\r\ncalled the \"Factor's Garland,\" of which we happen to have a copy in a\r\ncollection of penny histories. It is as much an ancient ballad as the\r\nMurder of William Weare--is dear at the ransom of a brass farthing--and\r\ncommences thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Behold, here's a ditty that's new, and no jest,\r\n    Concerning a young gentleman in the East,\r\n    Who, by his great gaming came to poverty,\r\n    And afterwards went many voyages to sea.\r\n\r\n    Being well educated, and one of great wit,\r\n    Three merchants of London, they all thought it fit,\r\n    To make him their captain, and factor also,\r\n    And for them to Turkey a voyage he did go.\"\r\n\r\nThis is sorry enough doggrel, as every one who has the capacity of\r\nreckoning feet upon his fingers must allow; but Sheldon fairly trumps\r\nit. In a fit of enthusiasm, he has enlisted the name of a friend in the\r\nservice, and that gentleman must doubtless feel infinitely obliged for\r\nthe honour of such immortalisation.\r\n\r\n    \"Syr Carnegie's gane owre the sea,\r\n      And's plowing thro' the main,\r\n    And now must make a lang voyage,\r\n      The red gold for to gain.\r\n\r\n    Now woe befall the cogging die,\r\n      And weary the painted beuks,\r\n    A Christian curse go with all naigs,\r\n      And eke all hounds and cocks.\r\n\r\n    Three merchants of great London town,\r\n      To save the youth were bent,\r\n    And they sent him as factor to Turkish ground,\r\n      For the gaming has hym shent.\"\r\n\r\nPoets of the Isle of Muck, did ye ever listen to such a strain? Now let\r\nus take a look at the works of the ancients. The first in point of order\r\nis the \"Laidley Worm of Spindleston Heugh,\" touching which Mr Sheldon\r\ngives us the following information. \"This ballad was made by the old\r\nmountain bard, Duncan Fraser of Cheviot, who lived A.D. 1320, and, was\r\nfirst printed some years ago, from an ancient MS., by Robert Lambe,\r\nvicar of Norham.\" We do not know what exact time maybe meant by the\r\nphrase \"some years ago,\" but the fact is that the \"Laidley Worm,\"--which\r\nis neither more nor less than a very poor version of the old Scots\r\nBallad, \"Kempion\"--was, according to Sir Walter Scott, \"_either entirely\r\ncomposed, or rewritten_, by the Rev. Mr Lamb of Norham,\" and had been so\r\noften published, that it was not thought worth while to insert it in the\r\nMinstrelsy of the Scottish Border. For the same reason, and for its\r\ninferior quality, it was kept out of Mr S. C. Hall's \"Book of British\r\nBallads.\" Intrinsically it is so bad, that Mr Sheldon himself might have\r\nwritten it in a moment of extraordinary inspiration; indeed the\r\nfollowing three verses, are in every way worthy of his pen;--\r\n\r\n    \"He sprinkled her with three drops o' the well,\r\n      In her palace where she stood;\r\n    When she grovelled down upon her belly,\r\n      A foul and loathsome toad.\r\n\r\n    And on the lands, near Ida's towers,\r\n      A loathsome toad she crawls,\r\n    And venom spits on every thing,\r\n      Which cometh to the walls.\r\n\r\n    The virgins all of Bamborough town,\r\n      Will swear that they have seen\r\n    This spiteful toad of monstrous size,\r\n      Whilst walking in the green.\"\r\n\r\nWe are now coolly asked to believe that this stuff was written in the\r\nfourteenth century, and reprinted, seven years ago, from an ancient\r\nmanuscript. But we must not be surprised at any thing from a gentleman\r\nwho seems impressed with the idea that the Chronicles of Roger Hoveden\r\nare written in the English language.\r\n\r\nWe next come to a ballad entitled \"The Outlandish Knight,\" whereof Mr\r\nSheldon gives us the following history. \"This ballad I have copied from\r\na broadsheet, in the possession of a gentleman of Newcastle; it has also\r\nbeen published in 'Richardson's Table Book.' _The verses with inverted\r\ncommas_, I added at the suggestion of a friend, as it was thought that\r\nthe Knight was not rendered sufficiently odious, without this new trait\r\nof his dishonour.\"\r\n\r\nSo far well; but Mr Sheldon ought, at the same time, to have had the\r\ncandour to tell us the source from which he pilfered those verses. His\r\nbelief in the ignorance and gullibility of the public must indeed be\r\nunbounded, if he expected to pass off without discovery a vamped version\r\nof \"May Collean.\" That fine ballad is to be found in the collections of\r\nHerd, Sharpe, Motherwell, and Chambers; and seldom, indeed, have we met\r\nwith a case of more palpable cribbage, as the following specimen will\r\ndemonstrate:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY COLLEAN.\r\n\r\n    \"'Loup off your steed,' says fause Sir John,\r\n      'Your bridal bed you see--\r\n    Here have I drowned eight ladies fair,\r\n      The ninth one you shall be.\r\n\r\n    'Cast off,' says he, 'thy jewels fine,\r\n      Sae costly and sae brave;\r\n    They are ower gude, and ower costly,\r\n      To throw in the sea-wave.\r\n\r\n    'Cast off, cast off, your Holland smock,\r\n      And lay it on this stone;\r\n    It is ower fine and ower costly,\r\n      To rot in the saut sea-foam.'\r\n\r\n    'Oh! Turn ye then about, Sir John,\r\n      And look to the leaf of the tree,--\r\n    It is not comely for a man\r\n      A naked woman to see.'\r\n\r\n    He turned himself straight round about,\r\n      To look to the leaf o' the tree;\r\n    She has twined her arms about his waist,\r\n      And thrown him into the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLANDISH KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n    \"'Alight thee, from thy milk-white steed,\r\n      And deliver it unto me;\r\n    Six maids have I drowned where the billows sound,\r\n      And the seventh one thou shalt be.\r\n\r\n    'But first pull off thy kirtle fine,\r\n      And deliver it unto me;\r\n    Thy kirtle of green is too rich I ween\r\n      To rot in the salt, salt sea.\r\n\r\n    'Pull off, pull off thy bonny green plaid,\r\n      That floats in the breeze so free,\r\n    It is woven fine with the silver twine,\r\n      And comely it is to see.'\r\n\r\n    'If I must pull off my bonny silk plaid,\r\n      Oh turn thy back to me,\r\n    And gaze on the sun which has just begun\r\n      To peer owre the salt, salt sea.'\r\n\r\n    He turned his back on the fair damselle,\r\n      And looked upon the beam,--\r\n    She grasped him tight with her arms so white\r\n      And plunged him in the stream.\"\r\n\r\nThis, it must be acknowledged, is, to use the mildest phrase, an\r\ninstance of remarkable coincidence.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the glibness of his preface, and the scraps of antique\r\ninformation which he is constantly parading, Mr Sheldon absolutely knows\r\nless about ballad poetry than any writer who has yet approached the\r\nsubject. As an editor, he was in duty bound to have looked over former\r\ncollections, and to have ascertained the originality of the wares which\r\nhe now proffers for our acceptance. He does not seem, however, to have\r\nread through any one compilation of the Scottish ballads, and is\r\nperpetually betraying his ignorance. For example, he gives us a ballad\r\ncalled \"The Laird of Roslin's daughter,\" and speaks thus of it in his\r\npreface:-\"This is a fragment of an apparently ancient ballad, related to\r\nme by a lady of Berwick-on-Tweed, who used to sing it in her childhood.\r\nI have given all that she was able to furnish me with. The same lady\r\nassures me that she never remembers having seen it in print, and that\r\nshe had learnt it from her nurse, together with the ballad of Sir\r\nPatrick Spens, and several Irish legends, since forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful instance of the discovery of a mare's nest! Mr\r\nSheldon's fragment is merely an imperfect version of \"Captain\r\nWedderburn's Courtship\"--one of the raciest and wittiest of the Scottish\r\nballads, which has been printed over and over again, and is familiar to\r\nalmost every child in the country. It is given at full length by Robert\r\nChambers, in his collection, with this note appended to it:--\"This very\r\ningenious and amusing poem, which has been long popular all over\r\nScotland, first appeared in the 'New British Songster,' a collection\r\npublished at Falkirk in 1785. The present copy is taken directly from\r\nJamieson's 'Popular Ballads,' with the advantage of being collated with\r\none taken from recitation by Mr Kinloch.\" Such are the consequences of\r\nrelying upon the traditions of \"eldern women!\"\r\n\r\nWe, have, moreover, a version of \"Johnny Faa,\" of which ballad Mr\r\nSheldon seems to consider himself the sole discoverer--at least he does\r\nnot say one word of its notable existence elsewhere. And we are the more\r\ndisposed to give him credit for this ignorance, as he hazards an opinion\r\nthat \"the incidents recorded in this ballad must have occurred in the\r\nreign of James the Fifth of Scotland, or possibly in that of his father\r\nJames the Fourth, the King of the Commons;\" whereas the story is an\r\nhistorical one, and took place in the times of the Covenant. Be that as\r\nit may, Sheldon's version is certainly the worst that we have seen; and\r\nthe new stanzas which he has introduced are utterly loathsome and\r\nvulgar. Only think of the beautiful Lady Cassilis who eloped with a\r\nbelted knight, being reduced to the level of a hedge-tramper, and\r\ninterchanging caresses with a caird!\r\n\r\n    \"The Countess went down to the ha'\r\n      To hae a crack at them, fairly, O;\r\n    'And och,' she cried, 'I wad follow thee\r\n      To the end o' the world or nearly, O.'\r\n\r\n    He kist the Countess' lips sae red,\r\n      And her jimp white waist he cuddled, O;\r\n    She smoothed his beard wi' her lovely hand,\r\n      And a' for her Gipsy laddie, O.\"\r\n\r\nReally we do not think that we ever read any thing in print so intensely\r\nabominable as this.\r\n\r\nWe have no intention of wading through much more of Sheldon's\r\nlucubrations--nor is it necessary, as, after a close examination, we\r\ncannot discover one single ancient ballad which is new to us in the\r\nwhole collection. One or two, as we have already shown, are old friends\r\nin filthy garments, whose acquaintance we accordingly repudiate. Two or\r\nthree, such as \"Sir John le Sprynge,\" are mere reprints, and the\r\nremainder may be shortly characterised as unmitigated trash. It is\r\nrather too much that ditties still redolent of ardent spirits, and\r\ndistinctly traceable in their authorship to a drunken horse-couper in\r\nHawick, should be presented to the public as genuine Border ballads. For\r\nexample, we are favoured with an effusion called \"Loudon Jock's\r\nCourtship,\" which Mr Sheldon avers to be \"a very old ballad, now for the\r\nfirst time published,\" and states that he took it down \"from the recital\r\nof an old drover, called A. Pringle, who attended Kelso market.\" We do\r\nnot for a moment doubt that this valuable lay was actually pronounced by\r\nthe baked lips of Sandy, over half-a-mutchkin of aqua-vitae in a\r\ntoll-house; but we decline to register it as ancient upon the authority\r\nof such a Pisistratus. On the contrary, the beast who composed it was\r\nmanifestly free of the Vennel, acquainted with every nauseous close in\r\nthe old town of Edinburgh, and frequently found at full length upon the\r\nBridge, in a state of brutal intoxication. The localities are quite\r\nunequivocal, and mark the date of its composition. The \"brig,\"\r\nunfortunately for Mr Sheldon, is by no means an ancient structure. No\r\ndoubt the ditty is graphic in its way, and full-flavoured enough to turn\r\nthe stomach of a Gilmerton carter, as the following specimen will\r\ntestify:\r\n\r\n    \"Jock lifted and fought, gat in mony a scrape,\r\n      But it was all the same thing to that rattling chiel,\r\n    He wad aye spoil the horn, or else mak' a spoon,\r\n      The crown o' the causey, a kirk or a mill.\r\n\r\n    He rade into Embro' wi' gowd in his pouch,\r\n      To look at the ferlies and houses sae grand;\r\n    The Castle and Holyrood, the lang walk o' Leith,\r\n    Great joy for his coming soon Loudon Jock fand.\r\n\r\n    'Twas first hae this gill, and then aye anither,\r\n      Syne bottles o' sma' yill, and baups for his kite;\r\n    And then cam' the feyther o't, sister and brither,\r\n      And Jock stoited awa' at the heel o' the night.\r\n\r\n    Jock met wi' a hizzy upon the high brig,\r\n      That looks o'er the yard as he stoited away;\r\n    Jock aye lo'ed a blink o' a bonnie girl's eye,\r\n      And she speer'd at the reiver his fortune to spae.\r\n\r\n    But Jock cam' to questions, and being a fallow\r\n      Stout, buirdly and sonsy, he soon pleased her taste,\r\n    And awa' went the twasome, haup-jaup in their daffin',\r\n      Thro' wynds and blind alleys no time for to waste.\"\r\n\r\nAncient ballad indeed! the minstrel who would venture to chant such a\r\nditty in the Cowgate, would be cheaply let off with a month's solitary\r\nimprisonment on a diet of bread and water.\r\n\r\nWe pass with pleasure from this medley of balderdash and drivel to the\r\nmore sober tome of Mr Collier, because we know that whatever he gives us\r\nwill at least have the merit of being genuine. Out of the thousand\r\nblack-letter broadsides which constitute the Roxburghe collection, the\r\neditor has selected upwards of fifty, and thus states the object of\r\ntheir publication:--\"The main purpose of the ensuing collection is to\r\nshow, in their most genuine state, the character and quality of\r\nproductions written expressly for the amusement of the lower orders, in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, James, and Charles. Our volume consists of such\r\nordinary materials as formed the stock of the English ballad-singer,\r\nduring a period not far short of a century. Many traces will be found in\r\nthem of the modes in which they were rendered acceptable to the crowd,\r\nwhen sung in our most frequented thoroughfares.\" We need hardly say that\r\nthe volume is got up with great care; and it will doubtless be an\r\nacceptable addition to the libraries of our literary epicures:\r\nnevertheless, we are free to confess that we were somewhat disappointed\r\nwith its contents. We did not, it is true, expect to find, in this\r\nquarto, any new historical, or even romantic ballads of the first or\r\nhighest class. The literature of Elizabeth and James is remarkably\r\nsterile in productions of this nature; and the few which are\r\nintrinsically excellent have long since become familiar and have lost\r\nthe gloss of novelty. But the didactic ballad and the canzonet were then\r\nextensively practised, and, with the fugitive poetry of Peele, Marlowe,\r\nGreene, and Lodge in our recollection, we had hoped to recover some\r\nvaluable specimens of their more obscure contemporaries. In the\r\nvoluminous records of the Elizabethan era, we find mention of many poets\r\nwho enjoyed a reasonable celebrity at the time, but whose works, devoid\r\nof buoyancy, have since settled into oblivion. We find the names of some\r\nof these persons, such as Thomas Churchyard, who is spoken of in \"The\r\nReturn from Parnassus,\" attached to poems in Mr Collier's collection;\r\nbut we are compelled on perusal to acknowledge that there is much\r\njustice in the critical decrees of time, and that very little which is\r\nat all worthy of preservation has been silently permitted to perish. In\r\nan aesthetical point of view, therefore, we cannot expect to derive much\r\nadvantage from this reprint of the Roxburghe broadsides. But the\r\nantiquary, who has a natural taste for the cast-off raiment of the\r\nworld, will doubtless fasten upon the volume; and the critical\r\ncommentator may glean from it some scraps of obsolete information. To\r\nthem accordingly we leave it, and pass into the glades of Sherwood.\r\n\r\nWe wonder whether \"Robin Hood, that archer good,\" is as great a\r\nfavourite in the nursery now as he was in our younger days? We are\r\nafraid not. Our Robin was a mysterious sort of personage, something\r\nbetween an outlaw and an earl,--a kind of Judge Lynch, who distributed\r\narbitrary justice beneath the shade of an enormous oak-tree, and who was\r\nperpetually confiscating the moveables of abbots for the exclusive\r\nbenefit of the poor. Maid Marian we could never distinctly realise.\r\nSometimes she appeared to us as a soft flaxen-haired beauty, not unlike\r\na lay-figure, once the property of Mr Giannetti, which we loved in our\r\nyouth, and to whose memory we still are constant. Green as emerald was\r\nthe garb she wore, and the sun loved to shine upon her as she glided\r\nfrom the shadow of the trysting-tree. But then this fairy personage did\r\nnot tally well with the other figures of the group. We could not\r\nconceive her associating familiarly with the gaunt but good-natured\r\nScathelock, and Mutch the miller's son. Summer, too, must pass away from\r\nSherwood as it does from every sublunary scene. The leaves fall--the\r\nbirds are mute--the grass has withered down--and there is snow lying two\r\nfeet deep in the forest,--and then, wo is me for poor Marian, shivering\r\nin her slight silken kirtle in the midst of a faded bower! So that we\r\nwere sometimes compelled per-force to change our fancy, metamorphose\r\nMarian into a formidable Girzy, and provide her with a suit of\r\nlinsey-woolsey against the weather, and a pair of pattens big enough to\r\nhave frightened all the fallow-deer of the forest with their clatter.\r\n\r\nIvanhoe, however, has played the deuce with our ideal creations, and\r\nRobin Hood is now fixed to us for ever in the guise of the yeoman\r\nLocksley. We do not like him half so well as we did before. He has, in\r\nsome degree, compromised his character as an outlaw, by entering into an\r\narrangement with him of the Lion-heart, and he now shoots deer under\r\ncover of the kingly license. The old warfare between Little John and the\r\nSheriff of Nottingham is over, and the amicable diacylon conceals the\r\nlast vestige of their feud. Allan-a-Dale has become a gentleman, and\r\nFriar Tuck laid down the quarter-staff, if he has not taken up the\r\nbreviary.\r\n\r\nBut if any one wants to know bold Robin as he really was, let him\r\nstraightway possess himself of those two delightful volumes for which we\r\nare indebted to Mr Gutch. We have here not only the consecutive series\r\nof ballads known as \"The Lytell Geste of Robin Hode,\" but every ballad,\r\ntale, and song, relating to the famous outlaw; and the whole are\r\nbeautifully illustrated. Mr Gutch thoroughly understands the duty of an\r\neditor, and has applied himself heart and soul to the task: in\r\nconsequence, he has given us by far the best collection of English\r\nballads which for years has issued from the press.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the English ballads, as a whole, are decidedly\r\ninferior to the Scottish. They are neither, in their individual kinds,\r\nso stirring, so earnest, so plaintive, nor so imaginative, and Chevy\r\nChase is a tame concern when weighed against the Battle of Otterbourne.\r\nBut many of them are of great merit, and amongst the very best are those\r\nwhich relate to Robin Hood, and the three stout bowmen of the North,\r\nAdam Bell, Clym of the Clough, and William of Cloudeslee. Robin has a\r\nfair right to be considered the yeoman hero of England, and the\r\nrepresentative of what must have been a tolerably large class of persons\r\nthroughout the wars of the Roses. In his history, we can trace a kind of\r\ntacit protest against absolute despotism and feudal oppression. He is\r\nthe daring freeman of the soil, who will not live under arbitrary law,\r\nand who, in consequence, ends by setting all laws whatever at defiance.\r\nHe is not a thief, but a free-booter, and is entitled to receive from\r\nposterity whatever credit may be attachable to such a character. His is,\r\nin many respects, a parallel case to that of Rob Roy Macgregor, though\r\nthere is far more of deep tragedy as well as of patriotism, interwoven\r\nwith the history of the Highland outlaw. Robin asserts no tangible\r\nprinciples beyond active opposition to the church, and determined\r\nhostility to the game-laws. For the first of these tenets Baines would\r\nhave fallen down and worshipped him: for the second, John Bright would\r\nhave clothed his whole company gratuitously in drab. He is fond of\r\nfighting, and ready to take up the cudgels with any chance customer;\r\nbut, somehow or other, he has invariably the worst of the encounter.\r\nTinker, beggar-man, tanner, shepherd, and curtail friar, in succession,\r\nbring him to his knees, and his life would have been many times a\r\nforfeit, but for the timely assistance of his horn, which brought Little\r\nJohn and the rest to the rescue. Guy of Gisborne was, we believe, the\r\nonly champion whom he slew unaided, and even in that meeting he was\r\nplaced in sore jeopardy.\r\n\r\n    \"Robin was reachless on a root,\r\n      And stumbled at that tide,\r\n    And Guy was quick and nimble withall,\r\n      And hit him upon the side.\r\n\r\n    Oh dear Ladye! said Robin Hood,\r\n      That art both mother and may,\r\n    I think it was never man's destiny\r\n      To dye before his day.\r\n\r\n    Robin thought on our Ladye dear,\r\n      And soon leapt up againe,\r\n    And straight he came with a backward stroke\r\n      And he Sir Guy hath slaine.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is a fine jovial rollocking spirit about the outlawed hero of\r\nSherwood, which endears Robin to the popular heart of England: and we\r\nfirmly believe that Shakspeare, when he went out poaching of a moonlight\r\nnight, was more actuated by poetical precept and impulse than by any\r\nsensual covetise for the venison of old Sir Thomas Lucy.\r\n\r\nMany ingenious persons--nay many excellent poets, have in modern times\r\nattempted to imitate the ancient Scottish ballad, but in no single case\r\nhas there been a perfect fac-simile produced. The reason of the failure\r\nis obvious. An ingenious person, who is not a poet, could not for the\r\ndear life of him construct a ditty which, in order to resemble its\r\noriginal, must embody a strain of music, and a burst of heroic or of\r\nplaintive passion. It is not, however, by any means so difficult to\r\nimitate the diction: of which we have a notable example in the ballad of\r\n\"Childe Ether,\" which is included in several of the collections. \"Childe\r\nAlcohol,\" perhaps, would have been the better name, if all the\r\ncircumstances which we have heard relating to its composition be true;\r\nnevertheless it is undeniable that our facetious friends who are\r\nchargeable with this literary sin, have succeeded in producing a very\r\npassable imitation, and that their phraseology at least is faultless. A\r\npoet, again, neither can nor ought to imitate, and when he is writing in\r\nearnest the attempt is absolutely hopeless. For every poet has his own\r\nstyle, and his own unmistakeable manner of thought and of expression,\r\nwhich he cannot cast off at will. If he imitates, he ceases for the time\r\nto be a poet, degenerates into a rhymster, and his flowers upon close\r\ninspection will be found to have been fabricated from muslin.\r\n\r\nVery blind indeed must be the man who could mistake \"Sir James the Rose\"\r\nfor an ancient Scottish ballad. Michael Bruce, the author, was more than\r\nan ingenious person: he was also a poet, and had he lived a little\r\nlonger, and at a period when simplicity in composition was rated at its\r\ntrue value, he would in all probability have executed something better.\r\nBut he wanted power, and that pathos which is indispensable for the\r\ncomposition of a perfect ballad. Even Scott, when he attempted too close\r\nan imitation, failed. The glorious fragment which we have already\r\nquoted, \"The Eve of Saint John,\" \"Lochinvar,\" and others, are not to be\r\nconsidered in the light of imitations, but as pure outbursts of his own\r\nhigh chivalrous and romantic imagination. But the third part of \"Thomas\r\nthe Rhymer\" is an adaptation to, or continuation of the ancient\r\nfragment, with which, however, in no respect can it possibly compare.\r\nIndeed the old ballad stands almost isolated in poetry, for its wild\r\nimaginative strain.\r\n\r\n    \"She's mounted on her milk-white steed,\r\n      She's ta'en true Thomas up behind;\r\n    And aye, whene'er her bridle rung,\r\n      The steed flew swifter than the wind.\r\n\r\n    O they rade on, and further on;\r\n      The steed gaed swifter than the wind,\r\n    Until they reached a desart wide,\r\n      And every land was left behind.\r\n\r\n    \"Light down, light down, now, true Thomas,\r\n      And lean your head upon my knee,\r\n    Abide and rest a little space,\r\n      And I will show you ferlies three.\r\n\r\n    \"O see ye not yon narrow road,\r\n      So thick beset with thorns and briers?\r\n    That is the path of righteousness\r\n      Tho' after it but few inquires.\r\n\r\n    \"And see ye not that braid, braid road,\r\n      That lies across the lily leven?\r\n    That is the path of wickedness,\r\n      Tho' some call it the road to heaven.\r\n\r\n    \"And see ye not that bonny road\r\n      That winds about the fernie brae?\r\n    That is the road to fair Elf land,\r\n      Where thou and I this night maun gae.\r\n\r\n    \"But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue,\r\n      Whatever ye may hear or see;\r\n    For if ye speak word in Elfin land\r\n      Ye'll ne'er get back to your ain countrie.\"\r\n\r\n    O they rade on and farther on,\r\n      And they waded through rivers aboon the knee,\r\n    And they saw neither the sun nor moon,\r\n      But they heard the roaring of the sea.\r\n\r\n    It was mirk mirk night, and there was nae stern-light,\r\n      And they waded through red blude to the knee,\r\n    For a' the blude that's shed on earth\r\n      Rins through the springs o' that countrie.\"\r\n\r\nThe late ingenious Mr Cromek was not, so far as we know, physically\r\nblind, but most assuredly there hung a heavy cloud over his mental\r\nlight, since he could not discern the burning stamp of original genius\r\nin the fragments which were communicated to him by Allan Cunningham, and\r\nwhich he published under the title of \"Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway\r\nSong.\" Poor Allan Cunningham has passed away from amongst us, not\r\nunknown indeed, nor unhonoured, but without having received that full\r\nmeed of praise and fame which was justly his due. For Allan, though a\r\nmost industrious man, was far too careless of his poetic reputation, and\r\nnever could be prevailed on to collect together those scattered snatches\r\nof song, which he had sown with too liberal a hand in detached and\r\ndistant places. But the service which he would not render to himself,\r\nhas been performed by filial piety; and we now congratulate the public\r\non their possessing, in a cheap and elegant form, the works of the most\r\ntender and pathetic of the Scottish Minstrels who have arisen since the\r\ndeath of Burns. If this little book does not become a favourite, and if\r\nit does not speedily make its way, not only into every library, but into\r\nevery farm-steading of Scotland--if the poems of Allan Cunningham do\r\nnot become as familiar to the lips, and as dear to the hearts, of our\r\nshepherds and our peasantry, as those of his great predecessor--then we\r\nshall be constrained to believe that the age is indeed an iron one, that\r\nthe heart of our beloved country has at last grown cold, and its\r\nimpulses less fervid than of yore. It is now nearly thirty years ago--a\r\nlong, long time to us--since Cromek's collection of Remains was noticed\r\nin this Magazine. Cunningham was then in the flush and zenith of his\r\ngenius, with years, as we had fondly hoped, of fame before him, and all\r\nthe early difficulties which beset the path of a youthful poet overcome.\r\nHe was then urged to a diligent cultivation of the glorious talent he\r\npossessed, and to a further development of the seeds of poetry which lay\r\nwithin his own bosom, and in the spirit of his native land. And surely\r\nhad Allan acted thus, and confined himself to the range of literature\r\nwithin which he had few equals and no superior, he would ere now have\r\ngained a lofty and imperishable name. But a mistaken ambition diverted\r\nhim to other tasks. He left the field of song to wander through the\r\nforest of romance, and we fear that he lost himself amidst its mazes.\r\n\r\nIt is upon the present collection of his poems and songs that\r\nCunningham's fame must rest; and small as is the bulk of the volume, we\r\nyet do not hesitate to say that it would be difficult to point out\r\nanother containing more lyrics of exquisite beauty, with fewer palpable\r\nblemishes. Cunningham's poetical style is both rare and remarkable. With\r\na singular simplicity of diction, he combines imagery of the highest\r\nkind, and a pathos which at once finds its way to the heart of every\r\nreader. To many of our friends the following ballad may be familiar; but\r\nas a new generation who know less of Allan has arisen since the days of\r\nCromek, we may be excused for transferring once more to our pages a gem\r\nof such purity and lustre.\r\n\r\n    \"She's gane to dwall in heaven, my lassie,\r\n      She's gane to dwall in heaven;\r\n    'Ye're owre pure,' quo' the voice o' God,\r\n      'For dwalling out o' heaven!'\r\n\r\n    O what'll she do in heaven, my lassie?\r\n      O what'll she do in heaven?\r\n    She'll mix her ain thoughts wi' angel's sangs,\r\n      An' make them mair meet for heaven.\r\n\r\n    She was beloved by a', my lassie,\r\n      She was beloved by a';\r\n    But an angel fell in love wi' her,\r\n      An' took her frae us a'.\r\n\r\n    Lowly there thou lies, my lassie,\r\n      Lowly there thou lies;\r\n    A bonnier form ne'er went to the yird\r\n      Nor frae it will arise!\r\n\r\n    Fu' soon I'll follow thee, my lassie,\r\n      Fu' soon I'll follow thee;\r\n    Thou left me nought to covet ahin',\r\n      But took gudeness sel' wi' thee.\r\n\r\n    I look'd in thy death-cold face, my lassie,\r\n      I look'd in thy death-cold face;\r\n    Thou seem'd a lily new cut i' the bud,\r\n      An' fading in its place.\r\n\r\n    I look'd on thy death-shut eye, my lassie,\r\n      I look'd on thy death-shut eye;\r\n    And a lovelier light, in the brow of heaven,\r\n      Fell Time shall ne'er destroy.\r\n\r\n    Thy lips were ruddy and calm, my lassie,\r\n      Thy lips were ruddy and calm;\r\n    But gane was the holy breath o' heaven\r\n      That sang the evening psalm.\r\n\r\n    There's naught but dust now mine, lassie,\r\n      There's naught but dust now mine;\r\n    My soul's wi' thee i' the cauld grave,\r\n      An' why should I stay behin'!\"\r\n\r\nWe really must find fault with Mr Peter Cunningham for calling this, and\r\nothers of his father's choicest productions, \"imitations of the old\r\nballad.\" They are no more imitations than the finest poems of Burns, or\r\nHogg, or Motherwell. They are, it is true, written in the Scots dialect,\r\nand they share, along with the old traditional strains, the charm of a\r\nsweet simplicity; but every one of them came direct from the heart of\r\nour beloved Allan, and are, in their way, as truly original compositions\r\nas any burst that ever yet was uttered by inspired poet under the canopy\r\nof heaven. Poor old Cromek, who knew as little about the Scottish\r\nballads as Mr Sheldon, believed them to be ancient, and, we dare say,\r\ndied in that belief. But every man here, who knew or cared about the\r\nmatter, saw at once that such poems as \"The Lord's Marie,\" or \"Bonnie\r\nLady Anne,\" were neither ancient nor imitated; and accordingly, by the\r\ncommon consent of his brethren, Allan Cunningham was at once enrolled on\r\nthe list of the sweet singers of Scotland--and long and distant be the\r\nday when his name shall be forgotten on the flowery braes of Nithsdale,\r\nor the pleasant holms of Dalswinton, which in life he loved so well.\r\n\r\nThe last work which we have to notice is the collected edition of\r\nMotherwell's Poems, which has just issued from the Glasgow Press, under\r\nthe auspices of Mr James M'Conechy. William Motherwell must always stand\r\nvery high in the list of the minor Scottish poets, and one lyric of his,\r\n\"Jeanie Morrison,\" is as pathetic as any in the language. But of him so\r\nmuch has already been said in former numbers of MAGA, that we may\r\ndispense with present criticism: and we shall merely draw the attention\r\nof the lovers of the supernatural to a more terrific temptation of Saint\r\nAnthony than ever was painted by Teniers. Motherwell was a noted\r\nghost-seer, and few could beat him in the magic circle. Witness\r\n\"Elfinland Wud,\" which is enough to frighten, not a nursery of children,\r\nbut a score of bearded callants out of their wits, if they heard it\r\nchanted, on an eerie night, in the dim forests of Glenmore.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMON LADY.\r\n\r\n    \"Again in my chamber!\r\n      Again at my bed!\r\n    With thy smile sweet as sunshine,\r\n      And hand cold as lead!\r\n    I know thee! I know thee!\r\n      Nay, start not, my sweet!\r\n    These golden robes shrunk up\r\n      And showed me thy feet;\r\n    These golden robes shrunk up,\r\n      And taffety thin,\r\n    While out crept the emblems\r\n      Of Death and of Sin.\r\n\r\n    Bright beautiful devil!\r\n      Pass, pass from me now;\r\n    For the damp dew of death\r\n      Gathers thick on my brow;\r\n    And bind up thy girdle,\r\n      Nor beauties disclose,\r\n    More dazzlingly white\r\n      Than the wreath-drifted snows:\r\n    And away with thy kisses;\r\n      My heart waxes sick,\r\n    As thy red lips, like worms,\r\n      Travel over my cheek!\r\n\r\n    Ha! press me no more with\r\n      That passionless hand,\r\n    'Tis whiter than milk, or\r\n      The foam on the strand;\r\n    'Tis softer than down, or\r\n      The silken-leafed flower;\r\n    But colder than ice thrills\r\n      Its touch at this hour.\r\n    Like the finger of death,\r\n      From cerements unroll'd,\r\n    Thy hand on my heart falls\r\n      Dull, clammy, and cold.\r\n\r\n    Nor bend o'er my pillow--\r\n      Thy raven-black hair\r\n    O'ershadows my brow with\r\n      A deeper despair;\r\n    These ringlets, thick falling,\r\n      Spread fear through my brain,\r\n    And my temples are throbbing\r\n      With madness again.\r\n    The moonlight! the moonlight!\r\n      The deep-winding bay!\r\n    There are TWO on that strand,\r\n      And a ship far away!\r\n\r\n    In its silence and beauty,\r\n      Its passion and power,\r\n    Love breathed o'er the land\r\n      Like the soul of a flower.\r\n    The billows were chiming\r\n      On pale yellow sands,\r\n    And moonshine was gleaming\r\n      On small ivory hands.\r\n    There were bow'rs by the brook's brink,\r\n      And flowers bursting free;\r\n    There were hot lips to suck forth\r\n      A lost soul from me.\r\n\r\n    Now mountain and meadow,\r\n      Frith, forest, and river,\r\n    Are mingling with shadows--\r\n      Are lost to me ever.\r\n    The sunlight is fading,\r\n      Small birds seek their nest;\r\n    While happy hearts, flower-like,\r\n      Sink sinless to rest.\r\n    But I!-'tis no matter;\r\n      Ay, kiss cheek and chin;\r\n    Kiss--kiss--thou hast won me,\r\n      Bright, beautiful Sin!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now we shall lay down our pen, and bid farewell for a season both to\r\npoet and to poetaster. If any of our young friends who are now setting\r\nup as ballad-writers upon their own account, have a spark of genius\r\nwithin them--and we do think that, with proper training, something might\r\nbe made of the lads--let them study the distinctions which we have drawn\r\nabove, and cultivate energy and simplicity as the cardinal virtues of\r\ncomposition. Also let them study, but not copy, the ancient ballad-book:\r\nfor it is a domain which we have long preserved from poachers, and if we\r\ncatch any of them appropriating, remodelling, or transferring from it,\r\nwe shall beg an afternoon's loan of THE CRUTCH, and lay the delinquent\r\nas low as Sheldon. It may be that some do not know what is in that\r\nballad-book: if so--let them read the Death of the Douglas at\r\nOtterbourne, and then, if they dare, indulge us with the catastrophe of\r\nHarry Hotspur.\r\n\r\n    \"And then he called his little foot-page,\r\n      And said, 'Run speedilie,\r\n    And fetch my ae dear sister's son,\r\n      Sir Hugh Montgomerie.'\r\n\r\n    'My nephew gude,' the Douglas said,\r\n      'What recks the death o' ane!\r\n    Last nicht I dreimed a drearie dreim,\r\n      And I ken the day's thy ain.\r\n\r\n    'My wound is deep, I fain wad sleep;\r\n      Tak thou the vanguard o' the three,\r\n    And bury me by the braken-bush\r\n      That grows on yonder lily-lee.\r\n\r\n    O bury me by the braken-bush\r\n      Beneath the bluming brier;\r\n    Let never living mortal ken\r\n      That a kindly Scot lies here!'\r\n\r\n    He lifted up that noble lord,\r\n      Wi' the saut tear in his e'e;\r\n    He laid him in the braken-bush,\r\n      That his merrie-men might not see.\r\n\r\n    The moon was clear, the day drew near,\r\n      The spears in flinders flew;\r\n    And mony a gallant Englishman\r\n      Ere day the Scotsmen slew.\r\n\r\n    The Gordons gude in English blude\r\n      They steep'd their hose and shoon;\r\n    The Lindsays flew like fire about\r\n      Till a' the fray was dune.\r\n\r\n    The Percy and Montgomery met,\r\n      That either of other were fain;\r\n    They swappet swords, and they twa swat,\r\n      Till the blude ran down like rain.\r\n\r\n    'Now yield thee, yield thee, Percy,' he said,\r\n      'Or else I shall lay thee low.'\r\n    'To whom shall I yield?' Earl Percy said,\r\n      'Sin' I see it maun be so.'\r\n\r\n    Thou shalt not yield to lord nor loun,\r\n      Nor yet shalt thou yield to me;\r\n    But yield thee to the braken-bush\r\n      That grows on yon lily-lee.'\r\n\r\n    This deed was dune at the Otterbourne\r\n      About the breaking o' the day.\r\n    Earl Douglas was buriet at the braken-bush,\r\n      And Percy led captive away.\"\r\n\r\nSo died in his harness the doughty Earl of Douglas, and never was the\r\nfall of a warrior more greatly commemorated by minstrel, be his age, his\r\nland, his birth, or his language what they may!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] _The Minstrelsy of the English Border; being a collection of\r\nBallads, ancient, remodelled, and original, founded on well-known Border\r\nLegends._ With illustrative notes by FREDERICK SHELDON.

Any measure, therefore, professing to\r\nhave that object, would receive our attentive consideration; but we\r\nshould expect it to be framed with a care and caution corresponding to\r\nthe grave importance of the social relations which are to be affected,\r\nand in a spirit congenial to the deep moral and religious convictions\r\nwhich have always been cherished among our countrymen, and which, on\r\nthis subject above all others, it is important to preserve unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe Bill recently introduced into Parliament \"to amend the law of\r\nScotland affecting the constitution of marriage,\" appears to us not to\r\npossess the recommendations which we think essential to such an attempt.\r\nWe consider it, though well intended, to proceed on a partial and\r\nimperfect view of the subject, and to threaten us with the introduction\r\nof greater evils than those which it professes to remedy. We regard it\r\nas calculated to destroy or deaden the sacred character of the conjugal\r\nunion, and to diminish the solemnity of its obligations; to give new and\r\ndangerous encouragements to precipitate and improper connections; and,\r\nmore especially as regards young persons, to create formidable\r\ntemptations to imprudence or immorality, and fatal facilities to the\r\ndesigns of adventurers who may seek by marriage to obtain wealth or\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nAs the Bill is short, we shall insert it as the text of our\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n\"_A BILL to amend the Law of Scotland affecting the Constitution of\r\nMarriage._\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it is expedient that the law of marriage in Scotland should be\r\namended as far as the same affects the constitution of marriage in that\r\ncountry; be it enacted, by the Queen's most excellent Majesty, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and\r\nCommons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of\r\nthe same, that from and after the last day of March, One thousand eight\r\nhundred and Forty-eight, excepting as hereinafter excepted and provided,\r\n_no marriage_ to be contracted in Scotland _shall be valid or effectual_\r\nunless it shall be registered by the parties contracting the same, in\r\nterms of an act passed in the present session of Parliament, intituled,\r\n\"An Act for registering births, deaths and marriages in Scotland,\" by\r\nthe said parties appearing in presence of the registrar, and then and\r\nthere signing before witnesses the entry of their marriage in the\r\nregister, and having the same otherwise registered in the manner\r\nprovided by the said act, in the case of the registration of marriages\r\nby the parties themselves contracting marriage; _upon which registration\r\nonly_ the marriage shall be held to be contracted or valid or effectual\r\nto any effect or purpose whatever; and it is hereby declared that _such\r\nregistration shall of itself constitute marriage_, and such parties\r\nshall thereafter be held and deemed to be married parties to all effects\r\nand purposes whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Provided always, and be it enacted, that nothing herein contained shall\r\naffect or be held or construed to affect the validity of any marriage\r\nwhere the marriage has been solemnised in presence of a clergyman, or of\r\na party professing to be acting as, and believed to be a clergyman, or,\r\nin the case of Jews, has been solemnised according to the rites observed\r\nby persons professing the Jewish religion, or, in the case of Quakers,\r\naccording to the rites or form observed by persons belonging to the\r\nSociety of Friends commonly called Quakers.\r\n\r\n\"And be it enacted, that the word 'clergyman' shall include all\r\nclergymen or ministers of religion authorised to solemnise marriage,\r\nwhether belonging to the established church, or to any other church, or\r\nto any sect or persuasion by whatever name or denomination known.\r\n\r\n\"And be it enacted, that this act may be amended or repealed by any act\r\nto be passed during the present session of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThe operation of this Bill, it will be seen, depends so far on the\r\nmachinery provided by another Bill which is also now before Parliament,\r\n\"for registering births, deaths, and marriages, in Scotland.\" Into the\r\ndetails of that Bill, it is unnecessary here to enter; find we shall\r\nonly mention that it provides for the establishment of resident officers\r\nin various districts and subdistricts in Scotland, who are to keep a\r\nbook for the formal registration of the events specified in the title of\r\nthe Bill. We are no enemies of a judicious system of registration,\r\nthough we do not approve of all the enactments of the Bill in question,\r\nand we think that they will require special and close examination before\r\nthey shall be sanctioned by the Legislature. But we shall merely insert\r\nat present the clause that seems most material for discussing the merits\r\nof the Marriage Bill.\r\n\r\n\"And be it enacted, that in all cases of marriage contracted in Scotland\r\nfrom and after the last day of December one thousand eight hundred and\r\nforty-seven, the persons contracting such marriage, at the time of the\r\ncontraction thereof, or within two months thereafter, shall sign along\r\nwith two witnesses, in the presence of the registrar, the entry of such\r\nmarriage in the register-book to be kept by the registrar, and the\r\nregistrar shall make such entry according to the form of Schedule (C.)\r\nhereunto annexed; and if the person so contracting marriage, together\r\nwith two witnesses as aforesaid, shall, within ten days thereafter,\r\nattend upon the registrar for the purpose of signing the entry in the\r\nregister, the registrar shall for such entry be entitled to a fee of\r\nfive shillings; and if such persons shall so attend after ten days and\r\nwithin two months of contracting the marriage, the registrar shall be\r\nentitled to a fee of ten shillings, or it shall be competent to the\r\npersons so contracting marriage to _require the registrar of the\r\nsubdistrict within which such marriage has been contracted to attend at\r\nthe contraction_, or within two months thereafter, at any place within\r\nsuch subdistrict; and such registrar is hereby required, upon a written\r\nnotice of forty-eight hours given to him to that effect, to attend with\r\nthe register-book accordingly, and to make the proper entry therein, and\r\nfor such attendance and entry, if at the contraction or within ten days\r\nof the contraction of such marriage, the registrar shall be entitled to\r\na fee of one guinea, besides the sum of sixpence for each mile which\r\nsuch registrar shall be obliged to travel in going from his place of\r\nabode to the place of such marriage; and if such attendance shall be\r\nrequired after ten days but within two months of the contraction of such\r\nmarriage, the registrar shall for such attendance and entry be entitled\r\nto a fee of two guineas, besides the sum of sixpence for each mile which\r\nsuch registrar shall be obliged to travel as aforesaid; and any person\r\ncontracting marriage and failing to register the same, and sign the\r\nentry thereof in manner herein prescribed during the period of two\r\nmonths thereafter, shall be liable in a penalty of fifty pounds, and in\r\ndefault of payment thereof to suffer imprisonment for one month.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot help thinking that the Registration Bill, from which we have\r\njust quoted, has been framed without any view to the purpose which its\r\nmachinery is to serve under the Marriage Bill, of not merely registering\r\na marriage otherwise constituted, but also of actually constituting the\r\nmarriage that is to be registered. There is a gap apparently left\r\nbetween the two Bills, and at least there is something that appears very\r\nblank and meagre in the provision made for extra-ecclesiastical\r\nmarriages to be contracted in the registrar's presence. We presume that\r\nthis officer is not to judge what ceremony or declaration shall\r\nconstitute a marriage; if he were to do so new difficulties would arise:\r\nbut we take it for granted that if asked by the contracting parties to\r\nregister them as married persons, the registrar must immediately obey,\r\nwhen the entry will of itself marry them, whether they were married or\r\nnot before.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly something startling in a system of registration which\r\ndoes not precisely settle the antecedent matter on which it is to act;\r\nand it is still more singular to consider mere registration as\r\nconstituting in itself the very thing that is to be registered. But it\r\nseems to be so written in the Bill before us.\r\n\r\nVarious other observations will occur as to the imperfect structure of\r\nthe two Acts thus taken in connexion; but we pass over these minor\r\nmatters to point out the characteristic principles of this measure, and\r\nthe consequences which we think it involves.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, first, that it declares marriage to be constituted by\r\nmere registration to all effects and purposes, so that two parties thus\r\nentered in the register, are conclusively and irrevocably united by that\r\nsimple fact. Second, that it professes no preference, and shows no\r\nfavour for ecclesiastical marriages over those constituted by simple\r\ncontract or mere registration, the old-fashioned mode of solemnising,\r\nthem by a clergyman being merely saved from abolition, but shorn of all\r\nits privileges, and left, as it were, to die out in due time. Third,\r\nthat in registration marriages, no proclamation of banns is required,\r\nand no notice of any kind is given to the public, nor any interval for\r\ndeliberation forced upon the parties. Fourth, that no locality is\r\nassigned within which the parties may thus marry by registration, it\r\nbeing competent apparently to carry out the arrangement in any district\r\nhowever distant from their ordinary abode, by requiring, in a somewhat\r\nIrish fashion, \"the registrar of the subdistrict within which such\r\nmarriage HAS BEEN contracted to attend _at the contraction_.\"\r\n\r\nNow we think it can require little argument to show that a system of\r\nthis kind, introduced as the basis of _the marriage law of the land_,\r\nis, as has been predicted, much more likely to prove a bane than a\r\nblessing. Marriage is undoubtedly a civil contract, but in all\r\nenlightened Christian countries it has been looked upon as a solemn\r\nengagement, over which the church ought to preside, in order duly to\r\nimpress the contracting parties with the religious origin from which it\r\nsprung, with the religious duties which it involves, and with the\r\nreligious sanctions by which those duties are guarded. Considered as the\r\nfoundation of society itself, as the source of all pure and kindly\r\naffections, as the introduction to the parental as well as to the\r\nconjugal relation, it is impossible that it can be lightly treated or\r\nhurried over as a matter of mere routine or ordinary business, without\r\nlowering its character, and weakening its obligations, and relaxing\r\ngenerally the moral tone of the community.\r\n\r\nThat under such a system, also, facilities must be given for the hasty\r\ncontraction of imprudent or improper marriages, is too obvious to be\r\npointed out. A transient resolution, a half frolic, a moment's\r\nsubmission to undue influence, may at once and for ever create the\r\nstatus of matrimony by the simple act of registration, from which there\r\nis to be no room for repentance or escape.\r\n\r\nBut we shall be told that these evils are not introduced for the first\r\ntime by the present Bill, but already exist in their full extent under\r\nthe common law. If this were the case, it would be a serious objection\r\nto the Bill, that while it professed to amend the law, it left such\r\nevils untouched. But on further examination, it will be found that the\r\nmischievous consequences to which we have alluded are wholly or almost\r\nwholly unknown under the law as now existing, and will either be called\r\ninto operation by the present Bill, if it should pass into an Act, or\r\nwill be fearfully aggravated by such a measure.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, it must be observed that the law as it stands\r\ngives _no countenance_ and _no facility_ to extra-ecclesiastical\r\nmarriages. It tolerates but it does not give the sanction of its\r\napproval to them. On the contrary, it considers them to be irregular and\r\ncontrary to good order, and it provides punishment for those who\r\ncelebrate or engage in them. The present act places them on an entirely\r\nnew footing. It makes them part and parcel of the statute law. It\r\nprovides a machinery and pays an officer, according to a settled and\r\nmoderate tariff, for actually carrying through those summary connexions\r\nhitherto deemed irregular, but which can now be deemed irregular no\r\nlonger. This change of itself involves a serious danger.\r\n\r\nWhatever is left to depend on consuetudinary law, will derive its\r\ncharacter from the feelings of the people, among whom the law has been\r\nformed and preserved. The one custom, in its growth and progress, is\r\nchecked and qualified by others of an opposite and counteracting\r\ntendency. As matters now stand in Scotland, marriages celebrated without\r\nthe presence of a clergyman, or without the proclamation of banns,\r\nthough held to be valid, are denounced as irregular and improper. All\r\nthe feelings of the people are against them. No one, with any remains of\r\ndecent pride, or a sense of propriety, would contract marriage in that\r\nway; and such a step would infer a loss of social position and\r\nrespectability, even in the humblest ranks of life.\r\n\r\nBut, how long would this feeling last under the new bill? Could we rely\r\non its continuance in reference to marriages, which can no longer be\r\ncalled contraband or clandestine, which are recognised and regulated by\r\nan Act of Parliament, as being on an equal footing with marriages _in\r\nfacie ecclesiae_, and which are henceforward to be performed by a\r\nstatutory officer, intrusted with important and honourable duties? Are\r\nwe sure that a change in this respect would not soon come over all but\r\nthe very best among us; and at least that many thoughtless, and rash,\r\nand presumptuous persons, might not give to the registrar's book a\r\nposition somewhat approaching to the clergyman's benediction? The\r\nstatute is a clear and intelligible warrant for such a feeling, and may\r\nbe cited as lending _a stamp and currency_ to unclerical marriages,\r\nwhich they do not possess at present, but which it would afterwards be\r\ndifficult to deny them.\r\n\r\nIf this change of opinion or practice takes place, and the framers of\r\nthis bill cannot wonder or find fault if such a result should follow,\r\nlet us consider what a safeguard would in that way be removed, and how\r\ndeeply the national character might in time be deteriorated. At present,\r\nbesides other obstacles and drawbacks, to be immediately noticed, there\r\nexists a strong barrier against irregular marriages in their\r\ndisreputable character. The stigma that attaches to them, _both in law\r\nand in fact_, deters all but the licentious from resorting to them. But\r\nlet this reluctance once be diminished, and we cannot fail to see that\r\nextra-ecclesiastical marriages will be more frequent, particularly under\r\nthe facilities afforded by this bill, and a wide opening will be made\r\nfor the admission of all the evils attending them. The bill will thus\r\nhave a double operation of a detrimental kind, first by removing the\r\nlegal and moral objections to the marriages now called irregular, and\r\nnext by providing the means of easily and safely contracting those\r\nmarriages, by converting the registrar into _a marrying officer_, and,\r\nas has been truly said, establishing a popular Gretna-green in every\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is proper to remark, that by the present law, irregular\r\nmarriages are subject to other disadvantages, which operate to prevent\r\nthem, but which will now be taken away. The very _uncertainty_ which\r\nattaches to them under the existing law, though an evil in one way, is\r\nbeneficial in another. Every apparent consent to marry, if irregularly\r\ndeclared out of the presence of the church, is at present liable to\r\ninquiry and explanation. The most formal written engagement or verbal\r\ndeclaration is of itself inconclusive; it being always competent to\r\ninquire, whether it was not interchanged in jest or in error, or for\r\nsome other purpose than that of constituting marriage; and several cases\r\nhave occurred where, upon evidence that there was no genuine and serious\r\nintention to marry, such documents or declarations have been wholly\r\ndisregarded. It is obvious that the very fear of such contingencies,\r\ncarries with it; some degree of good to the morals and welfare of\r\nsociety. Designing persons seeking to form matrimonial connexions for\r\nsordid purposes, cannot be sure that their plan will succeed even if\r\nthey should entrap their victim into an apparent acquiescence in it; and\r\nfemales possessed of any principles or prudence, will not surrender\r\ntheir persons upon the faith of private contracts, which are not only\r\ndisreputable in point of character, but doubtful in point of security.\r\nUnder this Bill, however, all such difficulties would be removed. No\r\ninterchange of consent, however hasty, however ill considered, however\r\nimproperly obtained, could ever be got the better of when once it was\r\nregistered. A half-tipsy lad and a giddy lass, passing the registrar's\r\nhouse, after a fair, may be irrevocably buckled in three minutes, though\r\nthey should change their minds before they are well out of the door. A\r\nfortune-hunter has only to prevail on a silly girl, who has a few\r\nthousand pounds, to walk with him to the office, and there, with two of\r\nhis associates, make her sign her name in a book, and his purpose is\r\nfully and effectually accomplished; while the lady's maid of the family\r\nwill find it as easy, on the other side, to make a match with her\r\nmaster's son, at any favourable moment that offers.\r\n\r\nWe do not pretend to know what sort of man the registrar is to be. But\r\nhis office does not require him to be either a minister or a magistrate.\r\nIt is not, therefore, necessary that he should offer any advice or\r\nremonstrance as to the necessity of due deliberation, or the consent of\r\nfriends, in entering into the holy state of matrimony. And, indeed, such\r\ninterference would be an impertinence and a breach of duty. We presume,\r\nat the same time, that, as he must be a mortal man, and is to be paid by\r\nfees, he will have no objection to encourage every thing that brings\r\ngrist to the mill. He is not likely to grudge being knocked up at night\r\nwhen a gratuity is to be the result. And thus we conclude that all\r\nobservance of canonical hours will be dispensed with; and that the great\r\nwork of matrimonial registration will be practicable at any period of\r\nthe civil day.\r\n\r\nIf we were to indulge in the ludicrous on such a subject, we should only\r\nhave to imagine a marriage bazaar of this kind, opened at a\r\nwatering-place or at the sea-side, where young ladies might be attended\r\nor waylaid by amorous exiles of Erin, watching the _mollia tempora_ to\r\nwile the confiding fair one from the library to the pastry-cook's, and\r\nfrom the pastry-cook's to the registrar's shop, or else taking shelter\r\nwithin the statutory office during a shower of rain, or arranging to\r\nmeet at that happy rendezvous after the concert or ball. Or take the\r\nconverse case, of gawky country lads, hooked in by knowing widows or\r\nother female adventurers, and the chain riveted in an unguarded moment,\r\nbefore their unhappy parents, or even the witless victims themselves,\r\nhad dreamed that it was forging. But even this kind of publicity is not\r\nnecessary. As far as we see, the registrar may, at any hour, be summoned\r\nto attend at the most private spot of his district, and there be\r\ncompelled to witness and _legalise_ the most monstrous match that could\r\nbe imagined, or the most infamous advantage that duplicity ever gained\r\nover simple folly or unsuspecting inexperience.\r\n\r\nWho can doubt that scenes of this kind are not unlikely to occur under\r\nsuch a change of the law? When the restraints of moral customs and\r\nhabits have been broken through by the interference of the legislature;\r\nand when an invitation is thus held out, and a mechanism provided for\r\nprecipitate marriages, who can calculate the infinite evils that will\r\nensue? The obvious fruits of such a system will be conjugal unhappiness\r\nand consequent infidelity, the neglect of children, and the weakening of\r\nall domestic affections. The worst mischiefs to the personal and social\r\ncharacter of a people have always sprung from a disregard of the serious\r\nand solemn nature of the marriage tie; and the least risk of such laxity\r\nis to be deprecated.\r\n\r\n    \"Foecunda culpae saecula nuptias\r\n    Primum inquinavere, et genus et domos;\r\n      Hoc fonte derivata clades\r\n      In patriam populumque fluxit.\"\r\n\r\nIn the discussion on this subject out of doors, reference has been made,\r\nto the English registration act. It is not necessary for us to pronounce\r\nan opinion on the merits of that measure. But we will merely say that\r\nits character and provisions are essentially different from those of the\r\nScotch Bill we have been considering.\r\n\r\nThe English marriage act, which introduced a system of registration, is\r\nthe 6 & 7 William IV., c. 85. It is at least a well-digested and\r\nwell-developed measure, complete in itself, and laying down the grounds\r\non which it proceeds, and the precise mode of its operation. It was\r\nintroduced as a concession of religious toleration, being intended to\r\nrelieve the scruples of Dissenters, who objected to being married\r\naccording to the ritual of the Church of England. In that light the\r\npresent bill is wholly unnecessary. The fullest religious freedom\r\nalready exists in Scotland; the celebration of marriage by a clergyman\r\nof any denomination, after proclamation of banns, being equally valid\r\nand regular as when the ceremony is performed by a minister of the\r\nEstablishment. But the English registration act, so far from throwing\r\necclesiastical marriages into the shade, shows a studied anxiety to\r\npromote and encourage them, and contains numerous provisions directed to\r\nthat object, as well as intended to give publicity and deliberation to\r\nthe matrimonial contract to be entered into. It further provides a\r\nsystem by which the scruples of Dissenters are saved without destroying\r\nthe religious character of the contract, by allowing sectarian places of\r\nworship to be registered for the purpose of solemnising marriage\r\ntherein. It is only after all these provisions, and in order expressly\r\nto meet further religious scruples, that a marriage before the\r\nregistering officer is sanctioned. But in this case also, the statutory\r\nperiod of public premonition is required, as well as the observance of\r\nthe other precautions against precipitate and clandestine marriages. The\r\nclause on this subject is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"And be it enacted, that any persons _who shall object to marry under\r\nthe provisions of this Act, in any such registered building_, may,\r\n_after due notice and certificate issued_ as aforesaid, contract and\r\n_solemnise_ marriage at the office and in the presence of the\r\nsuperintendent registrar, and some registrar of the district, and in the\r\npresence of two witnesses, _with open doors_, and _between the hours\r\naforesaid_, making the declaration, and using the form of words herein\r\nbefore provided in the case of marriage, in any such registered\r\nbuilding.\"\r\n\r\nA statute of this kind was not likely to undermine the public feeling in\r\nfavour of the religious celebration of marriage; and we believe that it\r\nhas not done so. But the Bill now proposed for Scotland is framed on a\r\nvery different principle, and would in all probability involve very\r\ndifferent results.\r\n\r\nBut indeed it is needless here to refer to the law of England, which in\r\none essential respect is so widely distinguished from that of our own\r\ncountry. The restraints that, on the other side of the Tweed, have been\r\nprovided against the marriage of minors without the consent of their\r\nparents and guardians, have no existence with us, and the merits of the\r\nBill under consideration must be estimated in reference to that most\r\nmaterial fact.\r\n\r\nBy the theory of the law of Scotland, a boy of fourteen and a girl of\r\ntwelve may validly contract marriage by mutual consent, without the\r\nsanction, and in spite even of the opposition of their guardians. If\r\nsuch be the case, it may be asked, whether and why they do not actually\r\nmarry at present as rashly and as indiscriminately as they are likely to\r\ndo under the new bill? The answer is, that such is not the case, and the\r\nreason is to be found in the considerations we have already suggested.\r\nThe law is neutralised, and made nearly a dead letter, by the state of\r\nfeeling that prevails on the subject, and by the other obstacles to\r\nwhich we have referred. Some are preserved from the danger by ignorance,\r\nothers by the scandal and discredit attaching to irregular marriages,\r\nand others by the doubt and difficulty attending them. If these\r\npreventives be taken away, what protection remains? If a statutory\r\nmarriage by the registrar is not looked upon as discreditable--and why\r\nshould it be so, since the law enacts it?--then the position of the\r\nyoung is indeed most hazardous. The feelings of shame and fear most\r\nlikely to operate on youthful minds are withdrawn; and instead of\r\ndifficulties being thrown in the way, facilities for the evil are\r\ncreated. An encouragement is held out--an office is opened,--a sure and\r\ncertain method is provided and _advertised_ for indulging precipitately\r\nthe caprice of a moment at the expense of family peace and happiness and\r\nrespectability for the rest of life.\r\n\r\nWe might say much more upon this subject had we not, as we believe,\r\nsufficiently suggested the mischiefs with which this measure is\r\nfraught. We are not satisfied that, as far as the young are concerned,\r\nthe existing law as to seduction under promise of marriage can be safely\r\nabrogated, unless some other protection is provided in its place; and we\r\nsuspect that the apparent facility of registration at any time might be\r\nused as a means of temptation in the first instance, while it might\r\nafterwards be evaded with the most unjust consequences. Neither are we\r\nclear that long repute and cohabitation should not, at least, afford a\r\n_prima facie_ presumption of marriage, so as to supply the want of due\r\nevidence of celebration, which may in some cases be lost, particularly\r\nby persons coming from other countries to reside in Scotland. We see\r\ndifficulties, too, as to the effect of registration of marriage under\r\nfeigned names, which will often be resorted to where there is a desire\r\nfor concealment. If a marriage so registered is to be bad, what a door\r\nis to be opened for deception! If it is to be good, how little security\r\nmay the registration afford! But we recur to the more comprehensive and\r\nradical objections which we have already stated to this Bill, that it\r\ndestroys the sanctity and reverence attending marriage as a religious\r\nengagement, and that it affords dangerous facilities and temptations to\r\nthe hasty contraction of improper marriages, which, more especially in\r\nthe case of persons under age, may have a very wide and pernicious\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see that the Church of Scotland has earnestly taken up\r\nthis question in the same light with ourselves. But it equally concerns\r\nthe parents and guardians of youth of every religious denomination. We\r\nshall not be suspected of claiming for the Established Church alone the\r\nreligious right to sanctify the marriage obligation. Every Christian\r\nChurch in the land has a good claim and a deep interest to give its\r\nblessing and its sanction to its own members when so contracting. But\r\nall, indeed, who have the moral character and welfare of their country\r\nsincerely at heart, must feel as we do, if they share in the\r\nanticipations which we have expressed. Neither is the interest of the\r\nsubject confined to those who are residents in Scotland. It also\r\nconcerns every one whose children may enter or remain within our\r\nterritory at a marriageable age; and if the Scotch law is ever to be\r\nthoroughly amended, it will be but imperfectly done unless the feelings\r\nand rights of our English neighbours are specially attended to in this\r\nimportant point.\r\n\r\nIf we were to offer our own views as to a measure that might be safely\r\nadopted on this subject, we should be disposed to make the following\r\nsuggestions for consideration: 1st, That registration should be\r\nnecessary to validate irregular marriages, but should not constitute\r\nmarriage; 2d, That the registrar should not attend at the contraction of\r\nany irregular marriage; 3d, That a certain period of public\r\ncohabitation, in the same residence, as married persons, should\r\nconstitute or presume marriage; 4th, That, at least in reference to\r\nyoung females, marriage by promise and subsequent connexion should be\r\nvalid, if steps to declare it were taken within a certain time; 5th,\r\nThat the marriage of English parties under age should be subjected to\r\nsome reasonable restraint by requiring prior residence of some duration.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time however, we trust the Bill will not receive the\r\ncountenance of the Legislature. Minor amendments upon it may be\r\nproposed, but we do not expect that the principle can be corrected. It\r\nhas been introduced, no doubt, with a laudable desire to obviate the\r\nuncertainty at present attending irregular marriages. But in mitigating\r\nthat evil, it appears to us to involve others of a much more serious and\r\nsweeping kind, which it must be the duty of all religious and reflecting\r\nmen who see the danger to use every exertion to avert.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrinted by WILLIAM BLACKWOOD AND SONS, Edinburgh.",
