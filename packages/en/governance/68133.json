John and his sister lived many a day, as every body\r\nknows, in the two adjoining houses which were left them by their\r\nfather; and it matters not now to say, how much better John was lodged\r\nthan his sister, and how many more improvements he had made on his\r\nfarm. We never heard of any difference arising between them on this\r\nscore, farther than some jeers and taunts between the blackguards or\r\nscullions of either house, who generally got themselves bloody noses\r\nupon the occasion. As for Peg herself, she was so far from complaining\r\nof her portion, that nothing could offend her more, than to be told out\r\nof doors, that she was not the richest heiress in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say, whether it was Peg’s own temper, the badness of\r\nher subject, or the perpetual vexations she met with in her youth,\r\nthat hindered her from minding her domestic affairs, so much as she\r\nshould have done: but the truth is, that matters were often at sixes\r\nand sevens in her family; and her brother and she, to be sure, never\r\ncould agree about any thing. All the world knows how long their affairs\r\nremained in confusion, merely because they would not employ the same\r\nattorney, and what an aversion they had to trust their affairs in\r\ncommon to any single person. Peg would say, “I’ll have nothing to do\r\nwith John’s lawyers; whoever I employ must mind nobody’s affairs but\r\nmine. I have as good a right to be served as he; and if he pays more\r\nthan I do, let it be for services done to himself, not for cheating\r\nme.” John again would swagger and swear, and said, that whoever Peg\r\nemployed, must be a dirty lousy fellow; and would come to no terms,\r\nunless she would take a steward of his choosing.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, at last, as every careful peruser of history\r\nknoweth, that every man of the law, within the reach almost of John’s\r\nknowledge, from the master down to the merest clerk-boy, died, or left\r\nthe country, or disappeared some how or other, and John was obliged\r\nfor once to put his papers in the hands of his sister’s lawyer, a very\r\nbook-learned man, as many people affirm even unto this day. But be\r\nthis as it will, Peg had the vanity to boast, that though her lawyer\r\nnow lived in John’s own house, yet it was she who gave that clod-pated\r\npock-puddened numskull the lawyer at last; and that this same man\r\nof the law, if he had any gratitude to the house where he was born\r\nand bred, would not let her be wronged, or forget her boys, when the\r\nstock came to be divided. She trusted too, that they would remember\r\nthemselves, and if John or the attorney pretended to cheat them, she\r\ntalked no less than of beating out both their brains. John was really\r\nat bottom a good-natured fellow, and knowing himself to be an overmatch\r\nfor Peg, did not mind her peevish humours a rush; but he would not have\r\nliked her attorney for all that, if he had not expected to manage him,\r\nby keeping him in his own house, and by putting clerks about him, who\r\nnever had any connexion with Margaret, or her hungry loons, from whom,\r\nthe truth is, he expected no good.\r\n\r\nThis affair being settled between the brother and sister, as well as\r\ncould be expected with so little cordiality on either side, their\r\ncommon concerns began to be a little better managed, and people got\r\nsome rest in their beds; for they did not harbour vagrants, as they\r\nused to do, to hamstring one another’s cattle, to tear up the young\r\nplanting, and knock out one another’s brains. They differed, it is\r\ntrue, now and then about this thing, and t’other thing, and about\r\nattornies and agents, but it always happened that they employed the\r\nsame person, even whilst John wished Peg at the bottom of the sea; and\r\nPeg sometimes let devilish knocks at him, and the attorney too, when\r\nshe was jealous of either.\r\n\r\nJohn, however, was so far lucky, that his sister concurred with him\r\nvery readily in most things of consequence, such as turning off Squire\r\nGeoffry, and the like; insomuch, that he himself was not readier to\r\npart with this Squire, as every body knows, although he claimed kindred\r\nto Peg, as the foster-mother of his family; and to make all sure, she\r\nput her hand as freely to the perpetual contract with Sir Thomas. This\r\nwas a gentleman in the neighbourhood, of an ancient family, and a\r\npretty fortune of his own: but he was willing to take charge of the\r\nbrother and sister’s affairs, provided he had some security that he\r\nshould not be turned out the next moment, which was accordingly granted\r\nin the form of a contract, by virtue of which he continues to manage\r\ntheir business in a very orderly regular manner.\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not hinder some persons in both families, who had\r\na hankering after Squire Geoffry, from being mad enough once and\r\nagain, to think of restoring him to his office, in spite of John’s\r\nand Margaret’s teeth. They came sometimes from the garret, and from\r\nthe cellar, roaring about this matter; and when they got drunk, they\r\nimagined nothing was easier to be done. The truth is, that if Peg had\r\nnot been firm to the contract, John would often have been sore beset.\r\n\r\nAlthough the intention of this proem is far from being to give a full\r\naccount of the affairs of these two families, preceding the present\r\ntransaction, much less to censure or run down other grave historians,\r\nwho have published to the learned world any part of their history; yet\r\nwe cannot altogether pass in silence some few mistakes in the otherwise\r\nelaborate work of the celebrated Sir Humphrey Polisworth, bred in the\r\nlearned university of Grub-street. An historian, in our opinion, should\r\nbe as mindful of truth in whatever he may occasionally mention, as he\r\nis in the main series of his story. For want of attending to this\r\ntruth, the learned Sir Humphrey has unguardedly misrepresented the\r\nnature of John’s and Peg’s agreement, together with the causes which\r\ninduced John to sollicit that accommodation. Many learned writers of\r\nthat time say, that the question was not then about John’s heir, but\r\nabout the old story the choice of a steward, and the perpetual contract\r\nwe have mentioned. But be this as it will, there was no disagreement\r\nbetween John and his sister on either of these points, as Sir Humphrey\r\nPolisworth himself doth acknowledge. On the contrary, if John roared\r\nagainst Squire Geoffry, Peg tore her cap and her apron in perfect rage,\r\nand was like cat and dog with the same Squire and his gang, all the\r\ntime they were in the management of John’s business.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter was, that about the time of the great change\r\nwe have mentioned, many people in both families said, Although we\r\nagree now, we may quarrel hereafter, and it will be a plaguey thing\r\nto come into the hands of different lawyers and attornies again, who\r\nnever fail to set people by the ears for their own advantage. John and\r\nMargaret have lived so much better, since they came to employ the same\r\nlawyer, that it is a pity they should ever be in danger of parting\r\ntheir affairs. The lands of Bull-hall and Thistle-down were never\r\nintended for two farms, the same hedge and ditch surround them, and\r\nwhilst they continue in one, they may be kept with half the looking\r\nafter; for nobody can be half so troublesome to either family, as they\r\nhave formerly been to one another. For these, and many more reasons, an\r\nagreement was thought upon; and though it went somewhat against John’s\r\nstomach, yet he coaxed and flattered sister Peg till he obtained her\r\nconsent, not to come to live in his house, as the learned Sir Humphrey\r\nPolisworth has erroneously related, but merely to shut up her own\r\ncompting-room, dismiss her overseers, and send her clerks to John’s\r\nhouse, to manage their affairs together with his accomptant, under\r\nthe inspection of the great lawyer, as he was then called, in both\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThis agreement, however, did not please every body. The servants who\r\nattended Peg’s compting-room, were angry at the loss of their vails.\r\nThe upper servants, as every body knows, mismanaged their part of the\r\nbusiness some how or other, and many people said, that the house looked\r\nmelancholy when the windows of the counting-room just looking to the\r\nSouth were shut up. In short, you could hear a buzz in every corner of\r\nthe house, that the whole family was undone for ever. Jack himself grew\r\nvery sulky, and for the turn of a straw would have played the devil.\r\nBut what will not a little time to. Peg’s people got gradually into\r\nbetter humour; Jack’s zeal for the contract made with Sir Thomas, soon\r\nreconciled him to whatever was connected with it, and Peg’s affairs\r\nwent on so tolerably, that every body was pacified, except the few who\r\nwould be pleased with nothing, unless Squire Geoffry was restored.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Sir Thomas came to the office, there was a great\r\nturmoil in John’s kitchin and back-yard, and in Peg’s garret, where\r\nindeed she harboured a parcel of curious fellows, who did not mind\r\nthe business of the family much, but would run you up and down stairs\r\nlike lightning, sometimes get into the kitchen, the hen roost, or back\r\nyard, and snap up any thing their fingers could lay hold of. Their\r\nmistress seldom got any rent from them, except a days work now and\r\nthen in harvest, or the use of their children to keep the crows from\r\nthe barley. But the true secret of her liking to them was, that they\r\nwere excellent fellows at a brawl, and you had as good put your head\r\nin the fire, as meddle with their mistress when they were by. But Peg\r\ncould never get them to agree among themselves till very lately, nor\r\nalways to behave very respectfully to herself; insomuch, that both John\r\nand she were often tempted to condemn that garret. But things must have\r\ntheir course, the garret gentry have sometimes done excellent service,\r\nand there is nobody John himself likes better to see about him, when\r\nLewis Baboon or Lord Strutt come about cudgel-playing, which is a very\r\ncommon case, as the learned Sir Humphrey has very well observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n _How =John= quarrelled with =Lewis Baboon= about dividing the\r\n West-common; and how instead of going to law, they came to blows._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe account it a great oversight in the learned Sir Humphrey Polisworth,\r\nthat he has taken little or no notice of John Bull’s land-estate, his\r\norchards, kitchen-grounds, and corn-fields, of which he has always\r\npossessed an excellent share; but considered him as a simple clothier\r\nand mechanic, merely because he sent goods of this, and many other\r\nkinds to market. John got ready money, it is true, by the sale of\r\nhis goods; but the great support of his family, and what made him be\r\ntreated like a gentleman in the neighbourhood, was the excellent manor\r\nof Bull-hall, where John and his posterity may find capon and bacon,\r\nand beef and mutton, without being obliged to any body, and without\r\ncringing to Lord Strutt, Squire South, or Lewis Baboon, for their\r\ncustom. It is true, that the devil possessed John sometimes to that\r\ndegree, that you could not hear a word from him but about his cloth,\r\nand his iron-work, and his pottery, and you would see him up to the\r\neyes in clay, or steeped, till he grew all the colours of the rainbow,\r\nin dyer’s stuff, or smoaked and roasted like a smith, or sallow and\r\ngreasy like a weaver, and no gentleman could keep company with him, or\r\nany of his family, such low habits they had got behind the counter, or\r\nin the work-shop. “Mind your customers, lads,” says John; “Good words\r\ngo far; Be civil to every body whether they buy or no;” and then he\r\nwould rap out a string of proverbs, such as, “A penny saved is a penny\r\ngot; Fast bind, fast find,” and so forth; in short, if it had not been\r\nfor some good blood which John had still in his veins, he must have\r\ngrown a mere pedling, sneaking, designing, mercenary rogue, as ever was.\r\n\r\nThere was, as we say, blood, or something else, that kept up John’s\r\nspirit, so that he went abroad now and then, in as gentleman-like a\r\nway as could be wished, although Lewis Baboon used to sit sneering at\r\nhim sometimes as he passed; but John minded him not a rush.\r\n\r\nNow it happened, that John and Lewis had about the same time taken in\r\npart of the west-common, and though their fields were not contiguous,\r\nthey could not agree about their marches. Many meetings they had to\r\nsettle them, but all to no purpose, for none of them knew well what\r\nhe would be at. The common saying was, that Lewis wanted to get all\r\nthe land in the country, and you needed only to tell John so much, in\r\norder to put him in a downright foam of rage and fury. However this\r\nbe, Lewis tormented his own people enough, with making them stick in\r\nposts and stakes in different parts of the common; and when John asked\r\nhim what he meant, he said, They were only rubing posts for his cows\r\nto scratch themselves, in case they strayed so far. But other people\r\ntold John, that Lewis would some day or other claim every bit of that\r\nground as his own, by virtue of those stakes, if he was not checked in\r\ntime. Accordingly, John sent him some angry message about them, and\r\nLewis in return, begged leave to present his compliments to John, and\r\nallured him, that the thing in the world he wished most, was to live in\r\ngood terms with his honoured friend and neighbour John Bull. Mean time,\r\nsome of John’s cow-herds met with a fellow or two belonging to Lewis,\r\nand after a great deal of bad language, painful to repeat, they came\r\nto blows, and made a great noise, which brought John and Lewis too, to\r\nsee what was the matter. John, indeed, happened to be in his barge that\r\nafternoon, on the lake to the west of his house, which he affected to\r\ncall his own fish-pond, and Lewis too being on his way to the common,\r\ntheir barges unhappily met, when John, without any more ado, took up an\r\noar, and aimed a blow at Lewis Baboon’s brains, You damn’d, insidious,\r\nfair-tongued villain, this is all your doing, with your stakes and\r\nyour posts, and your covetousness for land, which nobody will possess\r\nunder you, you damned, oppressive, squeezing rascal. My dear John,\r\nsays Lewis, what is the matter? The matter, you scoundrel! With that\r\nJohn aimed another blow; but their barges ran foul of one another, and\r\nhe fastened on Lewis Baboon’s wig, tore his bag, and threw it in the\r\nwater; in short, before you could count six, there was not a hat nor a\r\nwig to be seen in the whole boats-crew, of either side. History says,\r\nthat Lewis had like to have been drowned outright, and was glad to get\r\nhome with his head broken in many places, and cursing John Bull, for\r\nthe most rash, cholerick, blunder-headed fellow, that ever was known in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n _What sort of fellows =John= and =Lewis= were in use to employ to keep\r\n their orchards, and their poultry._\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory tells us many lies, if this was the first time that John and\r\nLewis came to blows; and Sir Humphrey Polisworth may think to conceal\r\nit if he will, but many a time has Lewis, in his youth, lost his hat\r\nand his wig in scuffles with John, and as often has John come home with\r\na broken pate, though very few people durst tell it to his wife or his\r\nmother. In short, these two had been troublesome rogues to one another\r\ntime out of mind; and at the time of which we are now speaking, there\r\nwas no such thing as law or justice in the whole country. If you could\r\nkeep your own, it was well; if not, it did not signify complaining;\r\ntwo or three stout fellows at your back, a brace of pistols, or a\r\nblunderbuss, was a better title to an estate than the best conveyance\r\nin the world. Whilst you thought yourself sure of your lands, two or\r\nthree fellows in the neighbourhood would be disputing who should have\r\nit; and of Lord Strutt, Lewis Baboon, Squire South, Nicholas Frog,\r\nJohn Bull himself, and all the gang of them, there was not one to\r\nmend another, they did not mind blowing out one another’s brains one\r\nfarthing; they had got honourable names for thieving, robbing, and\r\nhouse-breaking, such as policy, conquest, and invasion; and if you\r\nlived in their neighbourhood, they were sure to leave you nothing,\r\nunless you could handle a cutlass, or fire a blunderbuss, and kept\r\nfriends with some one or other of them, who protected you for his own\r\nsake, or that he might take all you had at a more convenient time. God\r\nhelp the poor milk-sop that trusted to the goodness of his cause.\r\n\r\nThis made every body look about him; and John among the rest, for\r\nmany a day, had as stout a family of young fellows as any in all the\r\nneighbourhood, and would not take an affront or an injury from any man.\r\nHis boys were for the most part sober, peaceable fellows within doors;\r\nbut if there was any noise heard over-night among the poultry in the\r\norchard, or the workshop, it needed only the bark of a dog to bring a\r\nscore of them into the court, and from every corner of John’s house you\r\ncould hear nothing but striving who should be out first. Every body\r\nhad his cutlass, or his carabine at his bed’s-head, and it is hard to\r\nsay which they were most jealous of, their father’s honour, or the\r\npreservation of his estate. It was the pride of John’s heart in those\r\ndays, to see his boys hardy and resolute, and he hated a sneaking,\r\npuny, pewling fellow, like the devil.\r\n\r\nIn this humour John lived for many a day; but many changes happen\r\nwhich nobody looks for; people persuaded him by degrees, that if\r\nhe had money enough there was nothing else worth minding. From this\r\nhopeful maxim, he even neglected sending his children to school, locked\r\nup their cudgels and cricket-batts, and would not let one of them touch\r\na gun, for fear they should hurt themselves. He had got by heart all\r\nthe stories that ever his nurse had told him, about the accidents which\r\nhappen at rough play, or in handling firelocks, and would repeat them\r\nsometimes, till his wife and his mother were quite ashamed of him.\r\n\r\nIt would require the pen of a great historian to tell how this great\r\nchange was brought about. Some people said, that John was old and\r\nbegan to doat; others said, that it was all owing to an old nurse\r\nwho lived about the house; but alas, they do not tell us how John\r\ncame to be directed by old women, or what was the reason that some\r\nof John’s neighbours were grown worse than even he was at this\r\ntime. Lewis Baboon was grown from a spruce forward gallant, a mere\r\npriest-ridden, whore-ridden, flimsey periwig-making old fool. Lord\r\nStrutt could never be got out of his bed before eleven o’clock in the\r\nmorning; and Nicholas Frog would rather have taken ready money for a\r\nfarthing-candle, than see his best friend return from the grave. One\r\nstout man could have chaced a hundred of them into the sea, and yet\r\nthese damned fellows contrived to be very troublesome for all that, by\r\nmeans of a device of which the devil himself was certainly the author.\r\nIn their younger days they were all ready enough at a blow, yet as they\r\nand every body about them, had some other business besides fighting,\r\nthey could not well quarrel when they were otherways engaged; but they\r\ncame at last to keep people on purpose to fight, and as nobody cared\r\nwhat became of these fellows, they would send them out for the turn\r\nof a straw, to play the devil in all the neighbourhood; and the rest\r\nof the people at home trusting to them, became mere milk-sops and old\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAn historian of great credit affirms, that this practice was grafted\r\non that of keeping a game-keeper; and for this reason it is, that\r\nalthough there be many more of them in every house than are necessary\r\nto keep the game, they are nevertheless known under the title of\r\ngame-keepers even unto this day. In former times, continues he,\r\nevery father of a family and his children, were sportmen more or\r\nless. It mattered not who started the game, they could all shoot\r\nwithout distinction; and it mattered as little what part of the house\r\na thief attempted to break in upon, the first man he met thought\r\nhimself obliged to defend the premises. But when they grew lazy,\r\nspiritless, and purse-proud, they must needs keep their game-keepers\r\nlike lords, and each according to his estate, got as many as he\r\ncould well maintain, and those he employed not only to knock down\r\na hare, or a partridge, now and then, for the master’s table, but\r\nto them he entrusted the whole defence of his estate inclosed and\r\ncommon, barn-yards, orchards, and kitchin-grounds, and it was thought\r\npresumption in any body else to do any thing besides running away when\r\nany body attempted to disturb the house. Lewis Baboon would have kept\r\nyou forty or fifty at a time, and this when nobody was meddling with\r\nhim, as he said, to guard his poultry, and attend him to church.\r\n\r\nThese fellows did nothing from morning to night, but first turn upon\r\none heel, and then upon another, put a gun sometimes to their hip,\r\nsometimes to their nose, sometimes to their shoulder; and, in short,\r\nplayed so many antic tricks with a musket, that few or none of them\r\ncould remember or distinguish its real use. But they bilked their\r\nlandlords, cursed, swore, and bullied, wherever they went, and in many\r\nhouses where such fellows were kept, nobody durst say his life was his\r\nown for them.\r\n\r\nIt may be hard enough to tell how any matter of a family came to keep\r\nsuch people about him; but the most amazing thing of all is, how John\r\nBull, so kind a father, and so good a master, should ever think of\r\nentertaining so many of them, and trust more to their affection, than\r\nto that of his own children.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that John’s heart has always misgiven him in this project;\r\nhe generally keeps a dozen or so, but nobody could ever prevail on\r\nhim, or Mrs. Bull, to tell how long they were to keep them; and every\r\nSaturday night when he pays off his workmen, he always says, Gentlemen,\r\nwhereas it goes against my conscience, to keep some damned rascals\r\nperpetually about my house, you are to remain only for next week, and\r\nno longer; but still he keeps them on in this manner from one week to\r\nanother, for which he has many salvo’s. In the first place, says John,\r\nI don’t take any body but my own tenants sons, or now and then an idle\r\nfellow from my own farm, and I have always some of my own boys who keep\r\nthem company; so that they always behave very respectfully to me, and\r\nhave often taken my part, when such fellows as Nicholas Frog keeps\r\nwould have cut my throat. Secondly, says John, I only keep them as long\r\nas Squire Geoffrey and his abettors are like to be troublesome, which I\r\nhope will not be long. But many of John’s enemies said, that there was\r\na better reason than all these put together, viz. that he was afraid to\r\nfire a gun himself, and was frightened out of his senses when he had\r\nnot some of his bullies by him.\r\n\r\nWhether this was the cause, or the effect of his keeping those fellows,\r\nit must be owned that John Bull, who used to be a bold hearty fellow,\r\nalways master in his own house, and afraid of nothing, began to sneak\r\nabout the doors, and would start at his own shadow; and when there was\r\nany noise in the orchard, or poultry-yard, he would scour up to the\r\ngarret, and leave the game-keepers and the thieves to do what they\r\npleased with his effects, shutting his eyes, and stopping his ears,\r\nthat he might not see or hear any shooting of guns, of which in truth\r\nhe was become marvelously afraid. Lewis Baboon had no more ado, but\r\nto give out that he was going to pay a civil visit to John, in order\r\nto put the whole house in a pannic: and this word _pannic_ was grown\r\nso familiar with John, that he had it always ready as an excuse for\r\nrunning away upon the slightest occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n _How =John= got a terrible fright in his own house of Bull-hall._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not always without cause, that John Bull disliked the visits\r\nof Lewis Baboon; he knew what fine sport that rogue might have made\r\nfor himself in such a house; and that besides cuckoldom, many other\r\nmisfortunes might have befallen the landlord. But history, with all her\r\ngravity, will scarcely make posterity believe, how much John was afraid\r\nof his own sister Margaret’s garret lodgers. Once upon a time, two or\r\nthree of them being seduced by some outlandish person, who stiled\r\nhimself young Mr. Geoffrey, got down stairs, ran into Margaret’s dining\r\nroom and drawing-room, overset the china, drank the cream, and having\r\nfound one of John’s game-keepers teaching the maids to coddle apples in\r\nthe back-kitchen, gave him a slap in the chops, and poured the scalding\r\nwater on him. From thence they proceeded as they thought proper; and\r\nthough Margaret threw her poker at them as they passed, with an air of\r\ngreat bitterness and vexation, yet John took it in his head that it was\r\nall her doing, and sent her word to keep them at home, otherwise he\r\nwould set fire to her house: but just as he was talking in this strain,\r\nand abusing his poor sister as a treacherous vixin, who might have kept\r\nbetter order in her house if she pleased, he was silenced at once with\r\na knock on the pate; and without staying to see what was the matter,\r\nran up to the leads, called out to his game-keepers, who were gone\r\nnobody knows where, then to Nicholas Frog, Rousterdivel, and all the\r\ndamned names you can think of, to come to the assistance of John Bull,\r\nwhose throat was just going to be cut in his own house.\r\n\r\nMean time, Mr. Luchar, for this was the ringleader in all this\r\nmischief, continued to do what he pleased. Whenever he met any of\r\nJohn’s fellows, he asked, What trade are you? And if they were weavers,\r\nhe made them furnish what cloth he wanted; threatening to rip up their\r\nguts. In like manner, if they were brewers, tanners, cooks, scullions,\r\nor malsters, each in his way had something good for Mr. Luchar, and the\r\nfellow had learned not to be afraid, although there were three hundred\r\nof them together.\r\n\r\nThis fray, however, did not last long; Mr. Luchar was tired, and went\r\naway home to his garret, and John, who had been more afraid than hurt,\r\ncame down stairs, and when he saw that the foe was actually gone,\r\ncalled out to set fire to Peg’s house, to burn her, and all her vermin;\r\nfor, says he, we shall never get any peace for them. Mean time, the\r\ngame-keeper took heart at last, went up to the garret, and gave Mr.\r\nLuchar a stunning blow in the guts, just as he was stripping to go to\r\nbed, and dragged him down to the court, where John was in a little\r\nprevailed on to come and see the object of his terror, with his hands\r\ntied behind his back. Then, indeed, he began to be ashamed of his\r\nown behaviour, and abused all his people for letting him be so much\r\nafraid; he scolded the very scullions for letting the bacon be carried\r\noff by so paultry a fellow as Mr. Luchar. In short, he and every body\r\nelse threw the blame upon his neighbour, but all agreed in cursing and\r\nsinking sister Peg, to the deepest pit of hell.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to say what the poor woman had done to deserve all this\r\ntreatment; but some people set to work with her merely because it was\r\nthe fashion, and others found their account in it, some in one way,\r\nsome in another. As for the game-keeper, it was not very difficult to\r\nsee his motive; he had never beat any body before in all his life, and\r\nwanted now to magnify his feats as much as he could, and accordingly\r\nsaid, that few people knew the amount of what he had done; that if he\r\nhad not fought with sister Margaret’s people one and all, he was no\r\ntrue man; that he totally subdued them, and knew of nobody to compare\r\nhimself to, but the ancient conquerors. That if any body said, that the\r\nwhole of Margaret’s people was not against him, he was a scoundrel, and\r\na rascal, and not to be trusted.\r\n\r\nAfter this, who and who were to be trusted became the great question in\r\nJohn’s house. There was no pretending to any thing without being able\r\nto talk about trusting; and some people would scarcely let John Bull\r\ntrust himself. As for poor Peg, he was the finest fellow that spoke the\r\nmost ill of her. Even some of her own children who took care of nobody\r\nbut themselves all the time that Mr. Luchar was stirring, came abroad\r\nnow to confess with regret, that their mother was a sad vixin; that\r\nshe had given Mr. Luchar a dram of cherry-brandy, before he set out\r\nupon that damned unnatural diabolical hell-fire scamper; that for their\r\nparts it was true, they had the misfortune to be born in her house,\r\nsome people said of her own proper person, but few people know who\r\ntheir real parents are: this, however, they knew, that they had left\r\nher very young, and never liked her company. When one had made such\r\na speech as this, another endeavoured still to improve upon it; and\r\nif one gave his mother two, three, or more abusive epithets, the next\r\ndid not fail to give five or six. At last one great dolt of a fellow,\r\ncalled Bumbo, made a shift to get a round dozen of them on his fingers\r\nends, with which he never failed to entertain John Bull as often as he\r\nmet him.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of all this spite to their mother, was a great deal of\r\nkindness to John Bull. Leave matters to us, said they, we shall take\r\ncare that so worthy a man shall not be imposed upon; you should\r\nalways have some of us about your own person, and give us some decent\r\nemployment, that no body may suspect the design of our being here; we\r\nshall take care to place people in that unnatural sister’s house, so\r\nthat not a whisper shall be uttered among her gossips, but you shall\r\nhear of it; and these speeches they commonly concluded, with a _beware\r\nof counterfeits_. John upon all this looked like a perfect oaff: he\r\nthought Mr. Luchar’s knife was at his throat every moment; and these\r\nfavourable dispositions they took care to improve. One time he was told\r\nthat a cousin of Mr. Luchar’s had come in secretly at Peg’s garret\r\nwindow; at another time, that Mr. Luchar himself had bought a pair of\r\nnew shoes; at another time, that his sister Margaret had laughed at\r\nhim, when she heard that he went up to the leads; and all this, besides\r\nbeing asked regularly every morning, what would become of him, if he\r\nhad not some trusty friends to stand between him and that unnatural\r\nsister. In short, John was put from his sleep, and his appetite; he\r\nstared and stammered in his speech; you could not hear a word of common\r\nsense from him; and to have spoken a word of common sense, would have\r\ndisgraced you with him for ever.\r\n\r\nHistory says, however, that John did not continue very long in this\r\nhumour; and, indeed, it must be owned, that it was for once a good\r\nthing to be of a changeable temper: it would have been the devil\r\nindeed, to have continued for ever in the hands of spies and informers,\r\nperpetually talking of the miseries of human life; and the truth is,\r\nthat there was nothing in the world more repugnant to his ordinary\r\ntemper; so that though he could not all at once return to a perfect\r\ncordiality with his sister, yet he listened to people who advised him\r\nto take gentle methods with her. He accordingly, let even Mr. Luchar\r\nhimself off, with little more than an obligation to put on his breeches\r\nevery morning before he came down stairs among the ladies; and sent a\r\ncivil message to his sister, to ask her how she did, and to propose\r\ntaking a lease of her garret, and said that he would pay her any\r\nrent she chose to put upon it. Many odd projects, indeed, were put in\r\nhis head at this time; such as to turn that garret into a stable and\r\ncoach-house; to make sister Peg lodge her coals in it, brew her ale,\r\nand wash her linen; in short, to make Mr. Luchar himself, besides\r\nputting on his breeches, carry up earth, and plant cabbages and turnips\r\nupon the leads. It is true, that nothing of all this has been done; but\r\nit is not John’s fault, he was at some expence about it, and meant all\r\nfor the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n _How =John=’s affairs had like to have gone to the devil._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know how difficult a thing it is to write history. Whenever the\r\nreader meets with any thing that exceeds his own pitch, he presently\r\nattacks the credit of the historian; and we shall now be asked how came\r\nJohn Bull, who was such a coward in his own house, to be so very rash,\r\nas we have said, in that scuffle with Lewis Baboon. The fact is, that\r\nJohn never was slow at getting into a quarrel; he was choleric beyond\r\nmeasure; and as for mischief out of doors, there was nobody readier.\r\nHe had a parcel of watermen who feared neither man nor devil, and when\r\nhe was in his barge, either on the east or the west lake, it was but\r\na word and a blow with him; he never was afraid to meet with Lewis\r\nBaboon there, nor any where else, except at home. When you proposed to\r\nJohn, to go over to Lewis’s own house, and break his bones for him, he\r\nthought nothing more easy; but alas, if Lewis talked of coming to him,\r\nmatters went no better than we have said.\r\n\r\nYou will easily believe, that after that scuffle in the barge, Lewis\r\nBaboon must be in a very great passion. Accordingly, he cursed and\r\nswore like twenty dragoons, that he would speedily see John in his own\r\nhouse, and show him in the face of Mrs. Bull herself, what sort of a\r\nman he had affronted: this was sooner said than done. But in the mean\r\ntime, nobody could tell what was become of John, and all his watermen;\r\nwhilst Lewis Baboon went vapouring about every where, and did what\r\nhe pleased. He drove John’s cattle out of Cracket-Island, and took\r\npossession of it; although John used to think that nobody could ever\r\ndispute islands with him, so ready was he with his barge to relieve\r\nthem: but the truth upon this occasion was, that John had got into one\r\nof these pannics we have mentioned, had applied to Nicholas Frog to\r\nno purpose, and actually brought over Rousterdivel, to protect him.\r\nBut the whole neighbourhood laughed at him, when they saw that Lewis\r\nBaboon had no more to do than to talk of going over to John, in order\r\nto do what he pleased every where else; and John got into one of the\r\ngreatest passions that ever he was in in his life. All the historians\r\nof that time, ring with the amazing noise which he made about that\r\nsame Cracket-Island. He swaggered and stared, and roared and swore,\r\nthat John Bull of Bull-hall was abused and cheated by his clerks,\r\nhis watermen, his overseers, and every soul about him. When he saw\r\nRousterdivel, he called to his people to turn out that fellow; asked,\r\nwhat the devil had brought him to his house; would not give him a bit\r\nof victuals, and threatened to go to law with him about a handkerchief:\r\nand in short, obliged the poor fellow to go away, very much puzzled to\r\nmake out what sort of a man this same Mr. Bull must be.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion, John made such a noise, that he wakened Mrs. Bull,\r\nand brought her down yawning to the parlour, and rubbing her eyes,\r\nafter one of those drousy fits, to which she had been lately subject.\r\nHe had already, to her no small mortification, chaced away two or three\r\nof her favourite servants, who used to put her to bed every night, and\r\namong the rest his own nurse, who was grown of late a great person\r\nin all Mrs. Bull’s junketings and private parties; and indeed, for\r\nsome time, pretended to manage John himself as she thought proper. To\r\ndo this nurse justice, there were few people had a better hand at a\r\nsack-posset; and though she had no aversion to a glass of liquor in a\r\nfair way, yet she never tasted what came through her hands in the way\r\nof making cawdle, whey, or panada for the children: we never heard any\r\nthing amiss of her, save that she would take the children’s halfpence\r\nfrom them to keep, and therewith make up little sums, which she lent\r\nto the servant maids at interest, when they wanted to buy ribbons, or\r\nother trinkets. But the love of money may be forgiven in old age, as\r\nalso that meddling disposition which servants usually acquire when\r\nthey have been long about a house. The truth is, that nothing could\r\nbe more ridiculous than to hear this old woman put in her word upon\r\nall occasions. There was nothing in which she did not think herself a\r\nperfect oracle; she talked to John not only about his markets and his\r\nbargains, and all his dealings with his neighbours, about the choice\r\nof schools and masters for his children; game-keepers, hunts-men,\r\nwhippers-in; but, in short, about his drunken quarrels, boxing matches,\r\ncudgel play, and quarter staff. She would govern every part of his\r\nhouse for him, and no servant durst go with a message from his master,\r\nwithout first asking her, if she had any commands?\r\n\r\nHubble-bubble, and this nurse, had gone hand in hand for many a day;\r\nbut alas! the loss of Cracket-Island fell heavy upon them both at last.\r\nBawd, whore and rogue, were the best names they could get from John\r\nupon that occasion, and Hubble-bubble got out of his way as fast as\r\nhe could scour; but the nurse broke a cawdle-cup which she had in her\r\nhand, and bid him go find another to make slops for himself and his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nJohn was greatly helped into this fine humour by one Jowler, for whom\r\nhe had a great regard at this time. Most historians agree, that the\r\nname of Jowler was only a nick-name, which this fellow had got from the\r\nboys at school, on account of some odd conceit of a resemblance between\r\nhim and a hound of that name in John’s pack. They say, moreover, that\r\nmost of the boys had the name of some dog or other given them, and that\r\nthey used to make one of themselves the hare, and so hunt him with a\r\nmighty noise, in imitation of John’s pack. As to the dog Jowler, his\r\nresemblance to the person we are now speaking of, has procured him a\r\nplace in the records of history. There we are told, that this dog had\r\na very loud tongue, and that if he could not lead the whole pack, he\r\nnever failed, at least, to carry off five or six couple, sometimes on\r\na right, sometimes on a wrong scent; that he thereby so often spoilt\r\nthe sport, that the huntsman was downright crazy with rage, and often\r\nthreatened to turn Jowler out of the kennel, and sometimes actually\r\ntied him up at home; but then he made such a noise, that Mrs. Bull\r\ncould get no sleep for him in a morning; and the huntsman was as often\r\nobliged to leave Mango’s tomb and plaister in the kennel, whilst\r\nJowler was suffered to lead the pack. Then John had excellent sport,\r\nand the huntsman no great cause to complain; for Jowler was tractable\r\nenough, and a crack of the whip would make him leave the pursuit of\r\nthe stag, for that of a pole-cat, or a rabbit, and this not absolutely\r\nfor want of nose, but for fear of being turned down among the babblers\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAlthough we account it below the dignity of history, to adopt, or\r\nretail nick-names, yet we think ourselves obliged in this case, to\r\nretain a name which has come down to us on the great tide of writers,\r\nwhich watt and carry the transactions of that age. To return,\r\ntherefore, from this digression; Jowler no sooner observed the humour\r\nwhich John was in, than he chimed in directly; he told him that his\r\nfamily had never been so much disgraced before; that the scandalous\r\nloss of Cracket-Island was more owing to his overseer, than to the\r\nwaterman who was sent to look after it; that it was ignominious for\r\nJohn Bull, with a house full of fine young fellows, to need the\r\nprotection of so sorry a fellow as Rousterdivel; that if he did not\r\nlook about him, he would soon become the jest of all the neighbourhood,\r\nand lose all the ground which he had upon the common, or any where\r\nelse. To approve of a man’s advice in one thing, and trust him with\r\nevery thing, were inseparable with John; accordingly, he put all his\r\naffairs directly into Jowler’s hands, and for the first fortnight\r\nneither Sir Thomas, nor any body else, durst controul him in any thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n _How =John= consulted with his friends about the method of retrieving\r\n his affairs._\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was a great person for collecting his friends together to have\r\ntheir advice, but for the most part he did just what he pleased for\r\nall that; and he had always some point or other in his head, in which\r\nit was in vain to contradict him. This was the case now about the\r\nmalversations of his servants, and though there were many people\r\ndisposed to soften him, not a mortal durst put in a word. In the\r\nheight of his passion he abused every thing that had been done, right\r\nor wrong, for many years before. They had neglected his new farm upon\r\nthe common, and sent his horses, his ploughs and carts, to labour\r\nSir Thomas’s land in the east country; they had run him in debt over\r\nhead and ears, pawned his plate, and mortgaged his estate; they had\r\nmade his wife, who used to be a notable woman, a mere sot, with ale,\r\nbrandy, and slops. The nurse had even spoilt his own stomach with nasty\r\nmawkish warm drinks, and over-heating his ale. With all this in his\r\nhead, whenever he went to any of the neighbouring towns, he instantly\r\nrepaired to the coffee-house, and poured all forth to the first\r\nperson he met. All the world admired the vigour of his spirit, and the\r\nhonesty of his intentions, even when he carried matters too far; and\r\nwe all know, that if the father of such a family does not make a noise\r\nsometimes, affairs will be managed but so so.\r\n\r\nAbout this time of which we are now speaking, John had a circle about\r\nhim wherever he went, and talked of his affairs from morning to night.\r\nHe testified a particular aversion to the employing of Rousterdivel\r\nany more, swore that he himself never would cross the lake upon any\r\nbody’s errands, and that if any body came over to meddle with him, he\r\nwould show them that he could defend himself. In all which, Jowler\r\nencouraged him strongly, and repeated every word John could say, in a\r\nmuch higher tone than himself; and next to the point of getting fixed\r\nin the management of the business, seemed to have nothing more at\r\nheart, than to break off all idle connections, to keep John at home,\r\nand put a gun in his own hands, to avoid the disgrace of running to\r\nother people for protection on every trifling alarm. Whatever might be\r\ndone afterwards, Jowler knew this was no time to baulk John in any of\r\nhis fancies; and accordingly, he assisted in all his consultations, and\r\nnobody so loud as he.\r\n\r\nOne day, when John’s tongue was running on God knows where, he was\r\nasked by some of his friends what he intended to do. Do you intend,\r\nsaid they, to ask Lewis Baboon’s pardon for striking him in the manner\r\nyou did, or do you persist in the design of giving him gentlemany\r\nsatisfaction? I tell you what, says John, if Lewis Baboon had a\r\nthousand Cracket-islands of mine, and that he would give me them all\r\nfor asking his pardon, I would not do it. He is a vile, over-reaching,\r\nundermining, treacherous rogue, and there never will be any peace in\r\nthe neighbourhood, as long as that fair-tongued rascal is out of his\r\ngrave. Let him come out in his barge again, and I shall meet him; but\r\nI know the rascal, he has perpetually some bad design in his head, and\r\nwhen he is found out, he will bow and scrape, and make compliments; but\r\nhe does not lay it aside for all that, he only waits for a time to put\r\nit in execution, not in a fair gentlemany way, but behind your back,\r\nor when you are asleep, or indisposed: but I will dress his jacket for\r\nhim, if I find him put his nose upon the lake again.\r\n\r\nBut only suppose then, said they, that he should slip over in the\r\nnight, as he has often threatened, with a parcel of his game keepers,\r\nand take possession of your parlour and bed-chamber, which are worth\r\nmore than Cracket-Island to him, do you think, he will give you time to\r\nsend for Rousterdivel, as you used to do?\r\n\r\nAll the fires of Sodom and Gomorrah seize me, says John, if ever I\r\nsend for Rousterdivel with his great tobacco-pipe, his sour crout, and\r\nhis damned lingo, that nobody can understand. Odds-blood, an’t I as\r\ngood a man as Rousterdivel or Lewis Baboon? Though I have not so many\r\ngame-keepers, yet I have as good clean-made fellows about my farm as\r\nhe; and if my own children will let me be insulted, it is time that\r\nJohn Bull was gone the way of all flesh.\r\n\r\nBut what can your children do for you, said they, when your wife, and\r\nyour nurse, and your steward, will not let one of them touch a gun or\r\na cutlass, and think there is no safety but in the dark cellar, or the\r\ncoal-hole, when there is any disturbance in the yard.\r\n\r\nWell, says John, I shall tell them another tale; my boys shall learn to\r\ndefend me as they used to do. I have seen the time when the stoutest\r\nof them all durst not meddle with me, and that time shall return again,\r\nif I can get arms enough to furnish my hall, as I always had it, till\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n _How the Nurse dreamt that =John Bull= had banished all the weavers._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may believe that after so busy a day, as we have been describing,\r\nthe Nurse was not likely to get a very good night’s rest; starting,\r\ntumbling and tossing she had in abundance, but very little sound sleep.\r\nShe could not shut an eye, but presently she dreamt of some mischief\r\nor other. One time she thought the pan boiled over in the fire; at\r\nanother time, that the cat’s paw was in the custard; and finally, about\r\nthree o’clock in the morning, she dreamt that John Bull had banished\r\nall the weavers from his house; she saw the beams, the tradles, the\r\nshuttles, the pirns, all tumbled in a heap into a great black boat; she\r\nsaw all the weavers posting to embark. When she would have seized a\r\npiece of broad cloth, behold it was a great iron cannon! When she put\r\nout her hand to save a pirn, lo, it perked up in her face in the make\r\nof a pistol! Terror and amazement awaked her; she forgot her resolution\r\nnever to talk any more to John Bull about his affairs, and thought\r\nherself now called upon by heaven, to interpose in behalf of him and\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she lost no time in the morning, but went straight to the\r\nparlour, where she found John as busy as ever, talking about the orders\r\nhe was to give in his house: and having told him her dream, earnestly\r\nbeseeched him to tell her, whether he had any such intention, with\r\nrelation to the weavers; for she thought that a person, who had ceased\r\nto be guided by her, would stick at nothing.\r\n\r\n“The woman is crazy,” says John: “I am only thinking how I may best\r\nsecure the peace and welfare of my family, and how to keep off rogues;\r\nand you ask me, if I am to banish my weavers? I’ll defend my weavers\r\nto the last drop of my blood; they shall fare no worse than I do; late\r\nor early, if they are molested, I shall be with them, and I know that\r\nthey will stand by me against all the world.”\r\n\r\n“What better protection can you desire for yourself or them,” says the\r\nnurse, “than your own game-keeper, or Rousterdivel? It would do one\r\ngood to see, how that fine tall fellow will stop and turn, and do what\r\nhe is bid.”\r\n\r\n“A plague take the woman,” says John, “with her Rousterdivel; do\r\nyou think that I am a coward, a scoundrel, a beast, a blockhead, a\r\nmilk-sop, that I must always run for protection to other people? I tell\r\nyou again, that I am able to defend myself, and that I have people\r\nenow about my house to stand by me.”\r\n\r\n“And how do you propose that they should stand by you?” says the nurse:\r\n“When Lewis sends over his game-keepers, with their guns and their\r\nsabres, who will stand by you then?”\r\n\r\n“Odso,” says John, “cannot my people have guns and sabres as well as\r\nthey?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! then,” says the nurse, “my dream is read. You will not have a\r\nweaver in your house in three days, if you go on at that rate: who do\r\nyou think will sit quietly on a loom, with guns and pistols pointing\r\nat them in every corner, and that boy George putting crackers in\r\nthe candles, and firing his pistols at sparrows, and shooting the\r\nneighbours cats when they come about the hedges? See who can settle\r\nto work for you, if they are in perpetual danger of having their eyes\r\nblown out with squibs, serpents and rackets? Do you think a tradesman\r\ncan do any good if he is scared at that rate?”\r\n\r\n“Scared!” says John, “you don’t think that a weaver will be scared when\r\nhe turns game-keeper, and I have none better on my grounds. If any of\r\nmy people are afraid of a gun, so much the more shame to them and to\r\nme; it is the very thing I want to correct, by using them a little to\r\nwhat may be necessary for their own defence and mine.”\r\n\r\n“Worse and worse,” says the nurse: “if you use them to guns, you’ll\r\nnever get them to work a jot; and banishing the trade is worse than\r\nbanishing the men.”\r\n\r\n“A tenfold madness has seized your pericranium,” says John; “do you\r\nthink that nobody can make broad cloth but cowards; or that a fellow\r\nwon’t work, because he knows he can defend the fruits of his labour?\r\nYou have no objection to the taking as many of my tradesmen as you can\r\nget, to make game-keepers of them; and because they work none, you\r\nimagine that every fellow who takes a firelock in his hand to defend\r\nhimself and me, is to be idle too. Don’t the game-keepers themselves\r\nwork when they are allowed, and are paid for it? have not I known them\r\ngive money to their overseers, for leave to work at their own trades?\r\nand many a good penny has been got in that way. As my people are useful\r\nto me, and to themselves, I intend that they shall work in safety, and\r\nthat nobody shall insult an honest tradesman of mine, whilst they and\r\nI have breath in our bodies. Do what you will, you shall never get me\r\ndisgraced as you have done, with your idle jaw and nonsensical trash.”\r\n\r\n“Bless me,” says the nurse, “what a wild project you have got in your\r\nhead! You’ll tell me you want to defend your house and your estate; but\r\nto what purpose keep your estate, if you cannot find time, so much as\r\nto eat a bit of warm victuals; hurried late and early, banged, soused\r\nand drenched in all weathers, and this for fear that Lewis Baboon\r\nshould turn you out of your possessions; and what matter who has your\r\npossessions, if you cannot sit down to enjoy them? _Et propter vitam\r\nvivendi perdere causas._”\r\n\r\n“Hey-day,” says John, “your humble servant, Latin! I remember you of\r\nold.” “But goody,” says he, “I knew you lived among the boys; but don’t\r\nthink to palm upon me as a commendation of eating and drinking and\r\ncowardice, what the old boy for whom I have so often been whipped, damn\r\nhim, has said against a fellow who would forfeit his honour to preserve\r\nhis life.”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” says the nurse, “see how you can keep your bargain\r\nwith Sir Thomas. What will he say, when he sees your house swarming\r\nwith pistols and carabines, and cutlasses? you know that he does not\r\nchuse to trust any body in this house with gun-powder, except the\r\ngame-keeper.”\r\n\r\n“Blood-and-wounds,” says John, “you are more mindful of Sir Thomas\r\nthan you are of me. I have heard nothing from you these twenty years,\r\nbut Sir Thomas does not like this, and Sir Thomas does not like that.\r\nI was advised to take Sir Thomas into the management of my affairs,\r\nbecause Squire Geoffrey endeavoured to get a game-keeper of his own,\r\nand do what he pleased about my house. And now you tell me, that Sir\r\nThomas and the game-keeper are the only people to be trusted. Those\r\ngentlemen, it seems, will trust nobody else, and who the devil will\r\ntrust them? I never knew any of those suspicious people, that was much\r\nto be trusted himself. Ill doers are ill dreaders, as my sister Peg\r\nsays. Odso, if Sir Thomas does not think himself safe in my parlour\r\nwith me and my children, he must know of something worse than I thought\r\nof. Who was it that brought him about the house? Have not I done all\r\nthat lay in my power for him? And now you and he won’t let me defend\r\nmyself, because he won’t trust me. I love Sir Thomas; I mean, that he\r\nshall have the disposal of all the arms about my house, and he shall\r\nfind that I am his friend, when Hubble-bubble and you are in your\r\ngraves, and all the nonsense you are perpetually putting in his head\r\nand mine, is not worth a curse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n _What happened after this conversation with the Nurse._\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was listening to all this discourse, but the very boy George\r\nhimself, whom the nurse was so much afraid of? This youngster,\r\ninstead of loitering about the kitchen or the nursery, flattering the\r\ncook-maid, or the nurse, for slops and tit-bits between meals, was\r\nperpetually rambling about in quest of some diversion without doors.\r\nHe had procured a pistol and a gun, and powder and shot, all which\r\nhe hid in the hay-stack, or in crannies of the barn wall. You would\r\nthink that he minded nothing but climbing walls, and scrambling over\r\nhedges; but no sooner did he see two or more people serious about any\r\nthing, than he forgot all his play, came to listen, as he did to this\r\nconversation between John and his nurse, and gave such attention, that\r\nthere were few articles relating to the family, of which he had not\r\nan excellent notion; and could see the folly and ridicule of people,\r\nwho thought themselves over wise, as well as another: he was a perfect\r\nplague to the nurse, who hated a joke, and was often put downright mad\r\nwith his dry wipes and arch sayings. He no sooner heard John talk in\r\nthe peremptory manner above related, than he ran away to Mrs. Bull as\r\nfast as his legs could carry him, and told her all that her husband\r\nhad said, and a great deal more of his own, without mincing the matter\r\nin the least, by which he convinced her that John was not then in an\r\nhumour to be crossed, and that whether she liked the project or no, it\r\nwas best to put a good face upon the matter.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows that John had devolved great part of his business upon\r\nMrs. Bull; no tradesman’s bill could be paid without her authority, nor\r\nany receipts granted to any of John’s tenants. In short, neither John\r\nhimself, nor Sir Thomas, durst go to a fair or a market, till they knew\r\nwhether she would stand to their bargains. This had often been very\r\ntroublesome to Sir Thomas, and till he found out the way of managing\r\nher by means of Hubble-bubble, and the like persons, he was obliged to\r\nproceed with great caution, and for the most part to stay at home, when\r\nhe would fain have been a gadding.\r\n\r\nJohn had been so oft married, that it may be said with safety, that no\r\nman in the world ever had more experience in matrimony. He had tasted\r\nat times both the sweet and the bitter; but it was a maxim of his,\r\nthat any wife was better than none; and accordingly, no sooner one\r\nwife died, than he instantly married another. He never liked a woman\r\nthe worse for having a spice of the vixen; it pleased him to hear the\r\nclack of a woman’s tongue; and the truth is, that in a family like\r\nhis, it was no good sign when the mistress was not heard of both late\r\nand early. His present wife had got herself a tolerable name in the\r\nneighbourhood, as a quiet, discreet, good sort of a woman; and John,\r\naccordingly, sometimes almost forgot that she was in the family. She\r\nnever let him have any of those disputes with Sir Thomas about settling\r\nthe accounts, with which John had used to be delighted; but commonly\r\npassed them in the lump, saying, that every article was just what she\r\nwould have thought of herself, for the good of the family. With all\r\nthis good understanding with Sir Thomas, it was suspected that she had\r\nnot all the respect for her husband that she should have had; and the\r\nmore that she never scrupled to talk over all the arts which she had\r\npractised in the courtship, and to tell, how many a pot and penny it\r\nhad cost her, to get a good word with his servants, thereby to secure\r\nJohn to herself, when he might have had his choice of all the country;\r\nand then she would talk of her pin-money, and little perquisites, out\r\nof which, she was perpetually endeavouring to make up some little stock\r\nfor herself. The nurse and Hubble-bubble humoured her in all this way\r\nof talking, and said, to be sure, nobody would marry such an old fellow\r\nas John Bull, except with a view to get something by him. By this, and\r\nsuch like discourse, they had got a great deal to say with her, and\r\ncould have easily persuaded her at this time to put off the project\r\nof giving out the guns, if they durst have ventured to cross John in\r\na thing he was so much bent upon. The boy George assured Mrs. Bull,\r\nthat John must have at least fifty or sixty at a time, and all that the\r\nnurse could venture upon, was to make her abate one half; with which\r\nsolacing herself in the mean time, she let an order be signed for the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say, what made Hubble-bubble and the nurse so averse to\r\nthis scheme. As for Hubble-bubble it is probable, as most historians\r\nagree, that he did not know very well himself. But the nurse, who was\r\nno fool, most people thought, must have some other reasons besides her\r\ndream. However this be, we shall relate facts as they occur in the\r\ncourse of our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n _Concerning sister =Peg=._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the accounts were brought to sister Peg of all those fine doings\r\nin John’s house; how Jowler was entrusted with every thing, and was\r\ndriving it away like Jehu; and how John had brought all his arms from\r\nthe cellar, and was determined to fight with Lewis Baboon himself; and\r\nhow John’s hall was stuck round, as it used to be, with guns, pikes,\r\nbayonets and cutlasses, mixed, as report was, with stags branches, fox\r\nskins, and solitairs taken from Lewis in his youth; Peg expected a\r\nmessage every minute to desire she would garnish her hall in the same\r\nmanner, and get ready the few young men she had left in her house to\r\noppose Lewis, in case he should attempt to break in that way. But many\r\na day passed without any tidings; and what was most surprizing of all\r\nwas, that with all this lady’s wonted spleen, and acrimony when she\r\nwas vexed, there was scarcely a discontented word heard from her on\r\nthe occasion. One morning, indeed, at breakfast, she said, that she\r\ncould not blame her brother, but that she could not well understand,\r\nwhat Mrs. Bull meant by putting such a slight upon her, or how it came\r\nto pass that her own clerks, whom she sent to the office, and who had\r\nnothing else to do but to mind her affairs, never let her hear a word\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\nThis was almost all that she said, for a great while, and that with\r\nso little appearance of concern, that few historians have taken any\r\nnotice of it. People who thought of former times, expected bad humour\r\nenough from her on this occasion; but the fact was, that this lady was\r\ngreatly changed in her manners and deportment. From being jealous,\r\ncaptious, and ready to quarrel about a straw, she was grown in a very\r\nlittle time, a quiet easy-tempered, good-conditioned body, as could be\r\nwished, and this made some people think that the girl might have been\r\nalways easy enough to live with, if people had not played tricks on\r\nporpose to vex her, which indeed was so often the case, that you would\r\nhave thought her in a perpetual passion; and she was, by the habit of\r\ncontinual fretting, so much on the catch, that she thought herself\r\naffronted often, when no such thing was meant. In those days her\r\nservants had better lose their ears, than slight her in the manner they\r\nnow did, and they commonly stood as much in awe of her, as the servants\r\nin John’s, or any other house could do of their master and mistress.\r\nBut it was a changed world now. Her elder boys and upper servants\r\npassed most of their time out of the house, and sent any orders they\r\npleased, about the kitchen, the cellar, or the farm; and those who\r\nstayed at home, and did the work of the family, forgot the way to\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\nWhilst John’s house perpetually rung with the marrow-bones and\r\ncleavers, or cat-calls and groans either in honour or contempt of the\r\nupper-servants, according to their behaviour; insomuch, that Mrs.\r\nBull’s own woman durst not give herself any saucy airs; in Peg’s house\r\nall was hush, the good and the bad were used almost alike; and as to\r\nthe business of the office, it was out of sight out of mind with Peg;\r\nshe sent her clerks to wait upon Mrs. Bull, and although she was at\r\nno pains to send people that would not require looking after, yet she\r\nnever inquired any more about the matter. Accordingly, they not only\r\nneglected her concerns, but often got bits of the best, for abusing\r\nher to the nurse and the game-keeper, and others of Mrs. Bull’s\r\ngossips; and few or none of them thought of any thing, but how to get a\r\nshare to themselves of what was going about Mr. Bull’s house. She had\r\neven the mortification to see some of the worst of them come home, from\r\nJohn’s counting-room, with directions to keep the keys of her cellar\r\nand pantry, and deal out the victuals to her children; in doing which,\r\nthey had a wonderful jargon, which nobody could understand, but which\r\nhad a strange effect in benumning and stupifying all their hearers.\r\nThey talked perpetually of the _people above_, the _great folks_, or\r\n_the people in power_; and now and then would whisper Peg herself, that\r\nif she kept her temper, the _people above_ might possibly make her a\r\npresent of a hood, or a tippet, or a new petticoat, at a proper time;\r\nand though she did not know, who the devil these people above were,\r\nshe was perpetually gulled with this sort of talk. Those who pretend\r\nto understand these matters, say, that the people above were such as\r\nhad the naming of John Bull’s servants, and that they contrived new\r\noffices, and a variety of perquisites and vails, on purpose to allure\r\npeople, who were willing to sell their souls to hell, and cheat their\r\nown father and mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n _How =Lewis Baboon= was belaboured and drubbed; and how =Jowler=\r\n behaved._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have already set forth, was the real state of sister Margaret’s\r\naffairs, when her brother took that sturdy resolution for himself, but\r\nleft her out. His, indeed, was the best part of the family, and it was\r\nwell that matters were carried so far. John was likely some time or\r\nother to go all lengths for his sister, as well as for himself; and it\r\nwas the fashion at this time to say, that the great Jowler would never\r\nstop, till every good work was accomplished; but historians do not\r\nmention any great things that he did in the matter. It appears, indeed,\r\nthat this fellow did set himself in earnest to touzle Lewis Baboon, and\r\nso beset the lake and the common, that Lewis could no where appear,\r\nwithout getting a knock on the pate with an oar, or a punch in the guts\r\nwith a hand-hoe, and sometimes had musket-bullets whistling about his\r\nears so thick, that he ran as if all the devils in hell were let loose\r\nat his heels.\r\n\r\nIn short, Jowler went on helter-skelter; and as long as John and his\r\nwife were in the humour of paying his bills, he hired all the poachers,\r\ngame-keepers, and whippers-in in the country, and did not care a\r\nfarthing for a fellow, unless he could send him off the country, to\r\ndo some mischief or other. For this reason he made John get as many\r\ngame-keepers as possible, but never a word of arming his own children.\r\nHe made up matters again with Rousterdivel, gave him all he asked, and\r\nencouraged him to play the devil in the house of Squire South, John’s\r\nold friend. He sent more people to look after Sir Thomas’s farm, than\r\never were there before in this world. He brought John in bills of\r\nexpence laid out in the East country, so extravagant, and consisting\r\nof so many articles, that you would have thought all the taylors and\r\napothecaries in the country, had been concerned in making them up. But\r\nJowler minded nothing of all this; as long as John was in the humour,\r\nhe went on, and bullied and roared, and spent his money, as if the\r\nmaster’s salvation depended on the noise which his man Jowler should\r\nmake in the neighbourhood; and there was nothing to stop him, for\r\npeoples tongues were tied up, some by one thing, some by another; and\r\nwell did he know how to hold one tongue, that used to be the loudest of\r\nall on the like occasions.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, seldom a day but John had the news of some\r\nmischance befalling his foe Lewis, and then he had the marrow-bones and\r\ncleavers at his door, and his house rung with dancing of hornpipes,\r\njigs, and country bumkins. It was in vain to tell him that these things\r\nwould not avail his family a sixpence after all was over, and that he\r\nhad forgot the fine resolutions he had taken, about the defence of his\r\nown house at home, the clearing up of his old arms, and sending his\r\nchildren to the fencing-school.\r\n\r\nJowler kept him perpetually drunk, in order to get his money to spend;\r\nthere was seldom a night, but he made him drink twelve bumpers, and\r\ndance three hornpipes; so that John frequently exposed himself to the\r\nneighbourhood, and in his cups talked no less than of taking the half\r\nof Lewis Baboon’s estate to himself.\r\n\r\nIn all this hurry-scurry, the nurse and Hubble bubble were laughing\r\nin their sleeves; they saw their own game played to better purpose,\r\nthan ever they durst venture to play it. Sir Thomas and they got the\r\nfingering of more money than ever they had seen before in their lives,\r\nand they might lay it out where they pleased, so they let Jowler have\r\nthe honour of the treat: whilst in the mean time they saw no necessity\r\nof taking the arms out of the cellar, and they hoped, that John would\r\nsoon forget all that he ever said upon the subject. And so, perhaps, he\r\nwould, till Lewis Baboon chose to put him in mind of it again, if it\r\nhad not been for the boy George, and one or two more. But George never\r\nrested till he got his gun again, which the game-keeper had taken from\r\nhim some time before; and there was no hindering of him, from getting\r\nsome choice fellows together on holidays to shoot, as he had an order\r\nfor it under Mrs. Bull’s own hand.\r\n\r\nThe nurse then thought that she would give them their bellyful; she\r\nsaid, that Lewis Baboon was coming, and advised Sir Thomas to call\r\nthem out of their beds, at all hours of the night, to send them over\r\nhedge and ditch, from post to pillar, and never give them any rest, in\r\nhopes that they would tire of their project; she thought that when they\r\nfound there was no money to be got by the bargain, they would beg to be\r\noff. And here historians observe, that this good woman had forgotten,\r\nhow much young people like fun better than money. But still she made\r\nsomething of a bad bargain; she advised Sir Thomas never to let these\r\npeople come home, because Lewis Baboon was coming, and to send away\r\nall the game-keepers to his own farm, because Lewis Baboon was not\r\ncoming. In short, we can find no clear account of Lewis Baboon’s real\r\nintention, in any historian of that age, much less collect any opinion\r\nabout it from the conduct of John Bull’s advisers at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n _How sister =Peg= began to look about her; and how she wrote a letter\r\n to her brother =John=._\r\n\r\n\r\nMany were the freaks which John had taken in his head at different\r\ntimes: he once thought of turning lawyer, as every body knows; but\r\nhe now despised that and every other profession, and would be nothing\r\nless than a duke or a lord. He thought that he only wanted a suitable\r\nestate to maintain his dignity, and encouraged every scheme that was\r\nlaid before him for acquiring it. He had, accordingly, twenty proposals\r\nbrought him every day in writing by Jowler, all entitled, “Speedy and\r\neasy methods of acquiring a great land estate, humbly addressed to John\r\nBull, Esq;” Islands were to be seized here and there by main force;\r\nthe whole common was to be inclosed, without enquiring who had a right\r\nthere; plantations were to be cut down, and sent to market; farms were\r\nto be let to tenants that John could confide in, and every door was to\r\nbe chalked with John Bull’s name in great letters.\r\n\r\nWhy should not I, says he, have a great estate, as well as another?\r\nEvery body knows, that Lewis did not come honestly by all he has, yet\r\nthe rogue is never the worse esteemed in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhilst John’s head was busied with these hopeful projects, the news\r\ncame that Lewis Baboon was coming in earnest. John looked like a person\r\njust awake from his first sleep, and made some motions towards the\r\nback-door, before he recollected that he had some guns ready in the\r\nhall, and that he and his people must be affronted for ever, if they\r\ndid not pluck up their spirits. He saw a good many of his people ready\r\nto stand by him, and the blood returned to his face; the game-keepers\r\nwere all brought into the yard; and the nurse herself was then glad to\r\nsee as many of John’s people in arms as possible; the watermen were\r\nsent out in the barge to meet Lewis Baboon; and John, in short, passed\r\nthe night, as easily as could be expected of a man in his situation.\r\n\r\nIt is an old saying, Every man for himself, and God for us all. John in\r\nhis hurry, barricading his doors, and posting his people, forgot his\r\nsister Margaret altogether. There was, indeed, a game-keeper lodged\r\nin her house, but this poor fellow could scarcely pretend to secure\r\none door, and Lewis had twenty methods of coming into her house, where\r\nthere was neither lock nor latch, nor a single pistol to resist any\r\nbody, that should attempt to force his way; and the worst on’t was,\r\nthat Lewis had sent a sculler, with some of his game-keepers boys, to\r\ntake advantage of this situation. What could a poor woman do? the maids\r\nand the children screamed in every corner of the house, and Jowler sent\r\na gun to Mac Lurchar, as if Peg’s garret was the only place exposed,\r\nand left her pantry and her cellar to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nMany people in the house were of opinion, that she should write\r\nimmediately to her brother John, to represent her case, and put him\r\nin mind, that when she trusted her affairs to the management of his\r\nclerks, it was in hopes that her concerns would be equally looked\r\nafter with his own. Jack, who by this time had sown his wild oats,\r\nand was grown an orderly conversable fellow as you would desire to\r\nsee, was clear for writing this letter. “From the little I have seen\r\nof this troublesome neighbourhood,” says he, “I am convinced that no\r\nfamily is safe from ill neighbours, and thievish servants, without the\r\nmaster and his children can take care of themselves. _As arrows are\r\nin the hands of a mighty man_, says the Psalmist, _so are children\r\nof the youth. Happy the man that hath his quiver full of them: they\r\nshall not be ashamed, but speak with the enemies in the gate._ That\r\nis the true defence,” says Jack, “and let us have it. A game-keeper\r\nmay be out of the way, but the child of the house is always by his\r\nfather’s side.” In short, as he was no trifler, so he was seldom idle,\r\nwhen there was any thing of consequence to be done, and never minded\r\nwhether his opinion was asked or no. He spoke loudly on this occasion,\r\nand as he kept a regular correspondence with Sir Thomas, never failed\r\nto tell him his mind. Peg herself, who, as we have said, was rather\r\ngentle and inoffensive in her ordinary deportment, gave some signs of\r\ndiscontent and vexation; you could see a little fierceness return to\r\nher eye, and the affection and confidence with which she had always of\r\nlate regarded her brother, perhaps, at this time helped to augment her\r\ndispleasure. It is a grievous thing to be neglected by people to whom\r\nwe make advances of kindness and respect: this, however, did not extort\r\nfrom her any injurious terms to her brother. If there was a cloud, it\r\nwas readier to break upon his enemies head than on his. The truth is,\r\nthat instead of having that waspish cross disposition, which she had\r\noften discovered in her youth, she now needed some encouragement and\r\nspiriting up, to be able to defend her own. This did not hinder many\r\npeople from thinking her greatly improved; she had, indeed, more bloom\r\nin her complexion, or was rather less pale than formerly, and was\r\nwhat you may call a tight comely woman to converse with, rather than\r\none of your delicate beauties. But be her person what it would, it was\r\nnecessary to defend her house and her children; and people told her,\r\nthat if she would write to her brother, he would not hesitate a moment\r\nabout putting it in her power to do so. Peg was not near so ready in\r\ntaking resolutions as she used to be, when left entirely to shift for\r\nherself; and even so small a matter as writing a letter, she put off\r\nfrom day to day; at last, she got up one morning very early, and with\r\nthe assistance of some of her children and relations, drew up a scroll\r\nof the following letter, which was afterwards copied out fair, and sent\r\nby a careful person to her brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A copy of Margaret’s letter to her brother =John=._\r\n\r\n  “My dear Brother,\r\n\r\n“It was with great pleasure that I heard lately from people who\r\nfrequent your house, that you had taken a resolution not to depend\r\nany longer upon Nicholas Frog or Rousterdivel for your defence; that\r\nyou had collected your spirit very opportunely, and have since found\r\nyourself fortified, by what is the real strength of every family, the\r\naffection and vigour of your own children. My heart warmed to the\r\nprospect of finding myself in the same situation, and I could have\r\nalmost wished for an opportunity to see your children and mine fairly\r\nunited, against some common oppressor, a case in which I hope they\r\nwill always be invincible. But whatever my situation may be, I do not\r\nrepine at your prosperity. Our interests, indeed, are unseparable, and\r\nI cannot be persuaded, when matters go well with you, that they can, at\r\nthe long run, go ill with me or my family. This made me bear patiently\r\nwith your people’s neglect of me, when they ordered your family into\r\na posture of defence; and indeed, unless it had come of yourself at\r\nthat time, I was unwilling to have any matter started, which might have\r\nembarassed you in what you was about, by furnishing, as I was told it\r\nmight do, the people who were disposed to cross you, with arguments\r\nagainst your scheme. Those gentlemen, it seems, have a language ready\r\nprepared with respect to me, but I enter into no contentions with\r\nthem. It seems that words have their weight after their meaning has\r\nceased to be believed. It is in this way only, that I can understand,\r\nwhy a suspicion thrown upon me in words should be regarded, whilst\r\nyour servants in my own sight, carry arms to Mac Lurchar, the only\r\nperson almost whom you or I have reason to distrust. I do not condemn\r\nthat proceeding of yours; it is an instance of your openness and\r\ngood-nature, and I believe has met with a fellow, who has the heart to\r\nstand by his friends, and who, if properly directed, will fight for you\r\nand me, rather than for any body else.\r\n\r\n“But whatever my reasons were, for delaying to put you and Mrs. Bull\r\nin mind of me, I cannot, in justice to my own family, delay it any\r\nlonger. Your prosperity I shall always consider as my own; but there\r\nare certain distinctions, which if borne in silence by me, must, even\r\nin your own opinion, render me unworthy of the relation I bear to you.\r\nYou used to call me proud. I wish I may not have erred on the other\r\nextreme. When you cease to be proud, I shall not esteem my brother\r\nthe more. But whatever weaknesses I may have, how could you for a\r\nmoment think of reducing me to the necessity of asking as a favour,\r\nwhat is the birth-right of all mankind, liberty to defend myself? I\r\nwas possessed of this liberty, before I entrusted my affairs to the\r\nmanagement of your servants; and if you and I both afterwards ceased\r\nto use it, that part of our history, perhaps, had better be past in\r\nsilence. It never occurred to me, that you might perhaps resume it\r\nyourself, without offering it to me.\r\n\r\n“If a partial distribution of arms in your own family alarmed you, as\r\nit must do every man of common reason, what must I think? the only\r\nperson to whom the means of self-defence are denied, whilst I am\r\nsurrounded on every hand, by those who carry a badge of superiority,\r\nmore certain than scepters or empty pageantry. If my neighbours are at\r\nvariance, whoever is uppermost, it seems, I must be at under, a poor\r\ntame drudge, unable to keep my own, or assist my friends.\r\n\r\n“I should tire you, if I was to say every thing that occurs to me on\r\nthis alarming subject, and upon an occasion which would justify greater\r\ndegrees of impatience, than I have hitherto expressed. When I think,\r\nthat the very enemy against whom your people have taken such care to\r\nsecure themselves, is now hovering about my doors, where he is sure\r\nneither to find lock nor bar, nor a single musket to oppose his entry,\r\nI may well lose my patience, and wish at least to hear the cause of\r\nthis difference explained.\r\n\r\n“I shall direct my own people with you, how to act upon this occasion;\r\nand I must beg the favour, that you will assist in procuring me\r\ndirections how to proceed in warding off the blow, with which I am now\r\nthreatened; or let me know where I am to find bread for my children, if\r\nwhat I have within my doors is the property of every fool, who may be\r\ndisposed to take it.\r\n\r\n  “I am,\r\n  with the sincerest esteem\r\n  and affection, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n  “MARGARET.”\r\n\r\nThis letter had a tone of impatience, perhaps, because it was the\r\nsudden burst of a sentiment, which Margaret had been at some pains to\r\nstifle. She meant, as historians affirm, only to speak of the present\r\nalarm; yet she broke into the subject at once, and then was almost\r\nashamed to own, that she or her children were afraid of Lewis Baboon’s\r\nscurvy waterman, though, to say the truth, she could then have made no\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n _How this letter was received by =John=._\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret certainly did her brother wrong, if she supposed that he had\r\never refused her the privilege of defending herself, or that he was in\r\nany degree averse, to give his consent to whatever might be necessary\r\nfor that purpose. The fact was, that he had forgot her altogether, and\r\nnever once thought of the question, whether she should be put upon the\r\nsame footing with himself in this particular.\r\n\r\nWhen John Bull acted from his own temper, and without reflection, he\r\nnever discovered any remains of distrust or antipathy to his sister:\r\nbut when any matter came to be seriously considered, and friends, as\r\nJohn expressed himself, were consulted, then he had, indeed, some\r\nunfavourable maxims relating to her, which he had retained from his\r\nyouth, without having ever examined them since; and any ill-disposed\r\nperson, putting him in mind of a bit of custard or cheese-cake, which\r\nshe had snatched from him in the nursery, could have revived all his\r\nantient prejudices; and then, indeed, from his manner of talking, you\r\nwould imagine that his pockets were in perpetual danger. And speaking\r\nof his sister and her family, you would imagine that he had got a\r\nnest of gypsies whom he could not dislodge from his barn, that their\r\nfingers were perfect fish-hooks or harpies claws, perpetually sticking\r\nin his back. There were people enow who found it of use, to put him in\r\nthis mood, and they were sure never to neglect it, when any of Peg’s\r\npeople whom they did not like, came about the house to sell trinkets,\r\nor asking for service. Then they would ask John, whether he meant to\r\nbring the itch into his family, or go to bed in perpetual fear of\r\nhaving his throat cut? But if any body came, who was in the use of\r\nflattering, lying, or pimping for themselves, then a lousy fellow who\r\nhad been kicked out of Peg’s house, was the most valuable person in the\r\nworld, and John could not do too much for him.\r\n\r\nYou may believe, that if Hubble-bubble or the nurse, had been warned\r\nof a person’s coming with a letter from Peg on this occasion, they\r\nwould not have failed to have called, Stop Thief; but by good luck the\r\nletter was delivered into their master’s own hands, and they durst\r\nnot for their lives say a word more on the subject at that time. John\r\nhad got some bumpers that afternoon; his watermen had met with Lewis\r\nBaboon’s people, and he was gone abroad with Jowler, to see some boats\r\nthat had been taken from Lewis, and wrecks that had been driven on\r\nshore. When he had read Peg’s letter: “Ah!” says he, “poor sister here\r\nis mightily afraid indeed. Here is a spot of work now, Jowler. She is\r\nnot so much afraid either, but she wants that her young men should\r\nbe armed as well as mine.” “Signify to her,” says Jowler, “that the\r\ngreatness and importance of the affairs, in which you are now engaged,\r\nmust throw all domestic details into a season of more leisure.” “Ay,\r\nay,” says John, “tell her we are drinking Lewis Baboon’s dirge here,\r\nthe fellow’s joints are stiff by this time; tell her to open a new tap\r\nfor her boys, let them be merry, that’s all. She shall not see Lewis\r\nBaboon this twelvemonth, I warrant her. However, as to the affair of\r\ngetting guns in her house, if my wife and she can agree about it, I\r\nhave no objections.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n _How Mrs. =Bull=’s attendants were prepared on this subject._\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret could scarcely expect any other answer from her brother; he\r\nmight, indeed, have talked to his wife, and it would have become him to\r\nhave done so very loudly; but the settling matters of that kind, was\r\nleft entirely to her and Sir Thomas. This circumstance Peg knew, and\r\naccordingly wrote to Mrs. Bull, Sir Thomas, and all her own clerks in\r\nthe office, to each in the stile which was proper for her to make use\r\nof; and as all the originals are in our hands, not to interrupt the\r\ncourse of our narration, we intend to defer the publication of them,\r\nwith that of many other original papers, to the conclusion of this\r\ngreat work.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Peg had taken all this trouble, many people\r\nwere of opinion that the affair would never be heard of in the\r\ncounting-room, so much were they used to see Peg’s affairs overlooked;\r\nbut they were mistaken. Gilbert told Mrs. Bull the first or second time\r\nhe saw her, what a suit he was to present from her sister, and two\r\nor three of Peg’s boys were determined that it should not go without\r\na hearing. Mean time, the nurse and Hubble-bubble were not idle. The\r\nscheme which they thought to have frustrated was taking place very\r\nfast. The boy George and his companions were laughing at them as\r\nusual, and the young men who had been sent out to watch Lewis Baboon’s\r\nmotions, past their time merrily in the fields, playing at cricket,\r\npitch-bar, and foot-ball, from morning to night, eat their victuals\r\nwith a good appetite, and slept as sound in a barn, as ever they had\r\ndone in the best bed in John’s house: all which, the nurse would not\r\nhave believed, if you had sworn it to her on all the four evangelists.\r\nIn short, there was no appearance of their tiring, and they would have\r\nheld out through mere spite, if they had been tired, when they found\r\nthat there was any intention to vex them.\r\n\r\nAll this was sore enough upon the nurse, without being obliged to see\r\nher predictions equally falsified, by having the same thing tried\r\nin sister Peg’s house. This she could by no means think of with any\r\npatience, and she determined to do all she could with Mrs. Bull\r\nto prevent it. For this purpose, Hubble-bubble and she took their\r\nopportunity to talk to many of Mrs. Bull’s attendants. They put them\r\nin mind of all the perquisites, presents and vails, which had been so\r\nkindly thrown in their way; observed of what consequence the present\r\naffair was to them, and that if they suffered their friends to be\r\nbaffled, and discredited, they must not expect to be served so, in\r\ntime coming. You may soon get other people in our places, said they,\r\nwho will be willing to court you for the sake of your mistress; but\r\ncan you go as familiarly to a new comer, to ask for a bit of victuals,\r\nor a glass of liquor between meals? By this and such like talk, they\r\ncontrived to secure the people who had Mrs. Bull’s ear. And though they\r\nwere sure of herself at last, yet matters would go much more smoothly,\r\nif they could get any of sister Peg’s own clerks to give up the affair,\r\nas if she was not very much bent upon it herself.\r\n\r\nHistorians agree, that they tampered with many people for this\r\npurpose; but it is well known that not a soul of them would listen to\r\nproposals of that kind, till they came to Bumbo, whom they would have\r\ntried sooner, if they had not thought themselves sure of him, and\r\nat the same time known what degree of credit he was likely to bring\r\nthem. They had sometimes let him loose upon Mrs. Bull before, to very\r\nlittle purpose; although for discourse he was always ready, and had\r\nstuff in his head, which might be turned into jocular sayings, serious\r\nsentences, pathetic declamations, angry ebullitions, or plaintive\r\nditties, with equal propriety. He made the same thing pass in all these\r\nshapes, but the hearers did not know either when to laugh or cry,\r\nunless he gave them a signal, by a slap in the chops, a remarkable\r\nroar, or a doleful whine, by means of which it was dangerous to sit\r\nnear him; and whether you was near him or no, the changes of his voice\r\nproduced an odd sort of mounting and dipping, like the heaving of\r\nwaves, and had the same effect in raising a violent inclination to\r\nvomit. They say, that he had often turned Mrs. Bull’s stomach, and that\r\nshe always took cordials when she expected a visit from him. This being\r\nthe case, he was to be employed with caution; but he had still one\r\nquality, from which they expected some good, and that was his precise\r\nand accurate method of dividing mankind into Thomists and Geoffrites;\r\nin the last of which classes, he commonly put his mother Peg.\r\n\r\nA Geoffrite originally meant any person who was for restoring Squire\r\nGeoffrey to the management of John Bull’s business, and a Thomist the\r\nopposite. What this gentleman meant by these appellations nobody could\r\nfind out, for he sometimes bestowed them indifferently on Sir Thomas’s\r\nbest friends; and what is more surprizing still, on people who never\r\nthought of Sir Thomas nor Squire Geoffrey in all their lives; as well\r\nas some others, who never thought of any thing at all, but how to fill\r\ntheir own bellies and their pockets. He himself, it was said, was a\r\nThomist of this kind; but whilst he did nothing himself, but swallow\r\nthe warm pottage he had got from John Bull’s nurse, he wanted to\r\npersuade you, that other people’s heads were constantly taken up about\r\nthe divine right of attornies to treat their clients as they pleased. A\r\nGeoffrite was his favourite topic to speak upon; but whether it was to\r\nshow his sagacity in finding out what escaped other people, or merely\r\nbecause he had never seen any body paid for finding out Thomists, it\r\nis certain, that for one Thomist, he would point you out a dozen of\r\nGeoffrites; and you would be surprized, how the devil Sir Thomas got\r\ninto the management of John Bull’s or sister Peg’s business at all, as\r\nBumbo certainly was not in the way to help him to it.\r\n\r\nWith all these considerations pro and con, the nurse was extremely\r\ndesirous to see him; and as fortune would have it, he was no less\r\nanxious to see her. He wanted at this very time a special reward for\r\nall his services, no less than to be appointed major-domo in Peg’s own\r\nhouse: this was a sort of a man house-keeper, and was commonly a grave\r\nelderly person who kept the keys of Peg’s pantry, and entertained as\r\nhe thought proper any of the tenants, who had affairs about the house.\r\nThe last major-domo was lately dead; and as John Bull’s nurse took the\r\ncharge of all pantries and nurseries far and near, and would let nobody\r\nmeddle with them, but who was of her own chusing, it was not doubted at\r\nthis time, that her favourite Bumbo would be the man. But in order to\r\nsecure it the more, he furnished himself with a list of some dozen of\r\nGeoffrites, picked up nobody knows how, and containing some of those\r\nwho were likely to oppose himself, in getting the major-domo-ship in\r\nPeg’s family. With this provision he went down stairs, and so across\r\nthe court to John Bull’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n _How =Bumbo= discoursed with =John Bull=’s Nurse, and found her not so\r\n great a fool as he thought her._\r\n\r\n\r\nBumbo, without staying to speak with any body, went straight to the\r\nnurse’s closet, where he found her very melancholy, lamenting her\r\nconnection with such a fool as Hubble-bubble, and not much comforted\r\nwith the thought of having nobody now to trust to but Bumbo. However,\r\nas the saying is, a drowning man will catch at a straw; whenever he\r\nappeared, she got up and embraced him. Which he understanding to be as\r\nmuch as to say, My dear major-domo, I am glad to see you, was going to\r\nthank her, when she broke out into a perfect rage against sister Peg\r\nand her family.\r\n\r\nWhat, says she, is the meaning of this impertinent saucy letter, you\r\nhave sent from your house to Mr. Bull? have I not enough to do with his\r\nown humours and his freaks, without your refreshing his memory, and\r\npretending to copy after him like the ass in Æsop? Set you up, indeed!\r\nwe should bring our matters to a fine pass, if we minded all your\r\nletters and remonstrances.\r\n\r\nI hope your ladyship, says Bumbo, does not imagine that I had any hand\r\nin writing that letter, or would put any thing in Peg’s head, which I\r\nknew to be so disagreeable to your ladyship; indeed, I could not shew\r\nmyself any where, without the hazard of being absolutely worried by the\r\npeople who were for writing that insolent letter.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do then? says the nurse; if that vixen is so much bent\r\nupon this whim, Mrs. Bull cannot possibly refuse her husband’s own\r\nsister, what the world will call so poor a favour; it would look like\r\nmere jealousy and spleen, and might breed heart-burnings between the\r\ntwo families.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Bumbo, perceiving the good woman’s extreme distress, thought\r\nhow he best might comfort her, and thereby turn the discourse to the\r\naffair of his own major-domo-ship. My dear madam, says he, don’t be\r\nuneasy; this letter was written by a parcel of Geoffrites, of whom\r\nI have a list in my pocket; the few Thomists that are in that house,\r\nwould sooner be hanged than do any thing so disagreeable to your\r\nladyship.\r\n\r\nYours are right Thomists, says the nurse; ours here are more\r\ntroublesome about those matters, than any body; but assure me, says\r\nshe, that this letter is a forgery, and I shall love you as long I\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nA mere forgery upon my salvation, says Bumbo.\r\n\r\nWell said, says she, what comfort you give me! Let us away to Mrs.\r\nBull, and have those forgers tried to the utmost.\r\n\r\nBefore your ladyship goes, says Bumbo, I have a little affair to\r\nmention: your ladyship knows, that the major-domo is dead, may not I\r\npresume to hope, that your ladyship will do me a good office with Sir\r\nThomas on this occasion?\r\n\r\nAssure yourself that you shall be major-domo, says the nurse; but you\r\nmust not go, till Mrs. Bull has heard your evidence about the forgery.\r\n\r\nUpon my honour and reputation, says Bumbo, there is no occasion; the\r\nforgery will appear quite plain, every word of it forged, as I declare\r\nto you; but that unnatural woman was persuaded to desire me to second\r\nher application, and your ladyship knows, that even a major-domo leads\r\nbut a dog’s-life, if the mistress and every body be against him. There\r\nis Small-Trash, the Laird of Lick-pelf’s brother, will give his oath\r\nabout the forgery; and that is the same thing as if I did it myself,\r\nfor every body knows that we always swear the same things.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand your scruples now says the nurse; would any woman\r\ndesire you to second a forged application? Besides nobody ever heard\r\nof Small-Trash; and we cannot be answerable for trusting his evidence.\r\nStay, stay, my dear major-domo, and give us your own proper evidence in\r\nthis important point of forgery.\r\n\r\nI pray, says Bumbo, that your ladyship would consider my straits; I\r\ndare not say a word about Geoffrites; every body will roar, and say,\r\nthey knew what was a coming; nor dare I speak my mind about Peg; I beg\r\nthat your ladyship would not expose me like a bawd on the pillory, to\r\nbe pelted, battered, and splashed with rotten eggs, chewed apples, and\r\nstreet dirt, for the faithful counsel which I give in your private ear.\r\nI will do twice as much for you in another way.\r\n\r\nWell, well, says the nurse, I see the matter is hard, Gilbert and James\r\nwill carry all before them. I shall neither meddle nor make; Sir Thomas\r\nwill be imposed upon about the major-domo-ship. There are many people\r\nlooking for the place, and let me tell you it is an office of great\r\nconsequence. You are young, Mr. Bumbo; and they say, you are hot when\r\nmy back is turned, and you do not understand much of the larder or the\r\npantry, and you huff the poor tenants when they come about the kitchen,\r\nand that Margaret herself has not that confidence in you, which the\r\nmistress of a family should have in a person, who has such a trust\r\nabout her house. In short, I have had many disputes on your account,\r\nand now I am an old woman, and don’t meddle much. There is little\r\nappearance of my being able to obtain this favour for you; but you may\r\ntalk to Sir Thomas about it yourself. I am, indeed, very much out of\r\norder; old age has many infirmities; a very severe cough I have, and\r\nam troubled with wind; indeed, I have not eat an ounce of victuals for\r\nthese three days.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe what passed in Bumbo’s countenance\r\nduring this harangue. It changed from suspence to embarrassment, from\r\nembarrassment to confusion, from confusion to absolute despair; and\r\nthere it settled, when the nurse concluded her speech and was just a\r\ngoing. Well, says he, with a faultering voice, I have got many enemies\r\non your account and Sir Thomas’s; here they are, pulling the list out\r\nof his pocket, sworn Geoffrites, as I hope to be saved.\r\n\r\nThat will not do, Mr. Bumbo, says the nurse; we do not care a rush for\r\nyour Geoffrites or your Thomists either. They do well enough in their\r\ntime, but when one is about serious business, I hate trifling. If John\r\nBull and his sister take the defence of their houses upon themselves,\r\nwe may all go packing. What influence can any body have in a family,\r\nwhere he has little or nothing to give away? I have been all my life\r\ncontriving things for Sir Thomas and myself, to take to ourselves,\r\nor to give away, and now you would have us part with one of the best\r\nthings we have. I have found, Mr. Bumbo, that a person’s influence in\r\nany family, depends on the number of good things he has to give; you\r\nmust have caps, ribbons and petticoats for the maids, sugar-plumbs\r\nfor the children, and luncheons for the clerks, and be able to help a\r\nfootman now and then out of livery, otherwise they will not give an\r\nold song for you; and Sir Thomas has found plenty about John’s house,\r\notherwise Mrs. Bull and he would not be so good friends as they are.\r\nPeople must have their vails and their perquisites. Many a time has\r\nSir Thomas obliged his friend with a game-keeper’s place or so; and\r\nconsider with yourself, that if John continues to do any part of that\r\nbusiness himself, what numbers, not only of game-keepers, foresters and\r\nwhippers-in, but even weavers, taylors, smiths, accountants, bakers,\r\ntanners, and shoe-makers, will forget the way to Sir Thomas’s closet,\r\nand never think more of Hubble-bubble, or your humble servant. And then\r\nthe management of Rousterdivel’s affairs when he was brought over,\r\nwas an excellent thing; trust me, many a pretty fortune has been got\r\nby Rousterdivel. But it is all over, Mr. Bumbo, all over; and now a\r\nperson who comes to ask for a major-domo-ship, thinks he may do what he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nMuch honoured madam, says Bumbo, I hope you do not consider the\r\nscruples of a friend as an absolute refusal. I have always been ready\r\nto swear what you please, and if my oath be required to this forgery, I\r\nam ready to give it.\r\n\r\nThat was spoken like a major-domo, says the nurse; let us away to\r\nHubble-bubble, and settle the tenour of your evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n _Showing how it was the fashion to harangue Mrs. =Bull=._\r\n\r\n\r\nAltho’ Mrs. Bull, in all matters of consequence, generally took her\r\nresolution before she came into the office, yet it was the fashion to\r\ntalk to her, as if she was undetermined to the last; and she herself\r\nhumoured people in this whim, by listening to them, as if she was\r\ndrinking in instruction at both her ears, from every word they said.\r\nThis same had its consequences, for she got the habit of doing nothing,\r\nunless some body spoke to her more or less, and then if she was never\r\nso much determined upon a point, she was often out of countenance,\r\nwhen all the talk and the noise was on the other side.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance made Jowler so precious a fellow, that Hubble-bubble\r\nhimself, at the time he had most to say with Mrs. Bull, would have\r\ngiven a piece of his ear to have had Jowler hold his tongue; which he,\r\nhowever, would never do, till he saw time and place convenient. Then do\r\nhistorians say, that they have seen him as silent as a lamb, or making\r\nhis noise on t’other side of the same question.\r\n\r\nHowever this be, you may believe that this affair of sister Peg’s was\r\nnot to pass without talking enough. Mrs. Bull was no sooner seated,\r\nthan there were people enow ready to advise her; she was told to\r\nput off the matter to another time, that it was an affair of great\r\nconsequence, and that Peg appeared to be in too great a hurry. Which\r\nwas scarcely said, when she was told, that her ladyship was no stranger\r\nto such subjects, that she had heard enough of it lately from her own\r\nhusband, and given her opinion; that the people who spoke of Margaret’s\r\nhurry, were certainly in jest, and meant to ridicule the poor woman for\r\nher long patience and forbearance.\r\n\r\nIn short, some people said, that they did not think it was safe to\r\ntrust sister Peg with any arms at all. They bid Mrs. Bull recollect,\r\nwhether she had not heard, that Peg had been in the practice of biting\r\nand scratching her brother, when they were both in the nursery; and\r\nasked, what security John now had, that she might not beat him out of\r\nhis own house, or otherwise use him as she thought proper.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bull herself was ashamed of this argument; for a woman, whatever\r\nshe may think, cannot bear to hear her husband meanly spoke of. But she\r\nwas soon relieved of this distress, by a person who set forth John’s\r\nmanhood to some purpose; and in short, gave his opinion, that to be\r\nafraid of so inferior a force was mean and dastardly, to express any\r\njealousy of Margaret’s dispositions was injurious and abominable, as\r\nthey had every reason to believe, that she was well satisfied with her\r\nbrother, and only meant to tread in his steps, in a matter which would\r\nbe so honourable for both.\r\n\r\nOne fellow came running from the pantry, with a bib and an apron, and\r\nquoted the nurse’s dream; he said, that although John Bull had banished\r\nthe weavers, it was no reason why his sister Peg should do the like;\r\nthat she had more need to have a piece of cloth sent her to make coats\r\nfor her children, than authority for any such pernicious scheme; and\r\nthat if she and her whole house were at the door, he would not grant\r\nso ruinous a favour; that he remembered to have heard the condition\r\nthat both houses were in, when every body thought himself qualified to\r\nfight, that there was then neither wheel nor loom within the door, and\r\nnobody wrought any at all; and he asked Mrs. Bull, whether she would\r\nhave those times revived?\r\n\r\nTo this it was said, that every body might have heard of times, when\r\npeople wrought very little, but that they always wrought more or less;\r\nand that if there was less work done formerly than now, it was because\r\nfewer people were bred to business, and because there was not so ready\r\na market for fine cloaths or other niceties, by which tradesmen get\r\ntheir livelihood; but that now when every body is bred to business, and\r\na tradesman’s work is well paid for, it was absurd to say, they would\r\ngrow idle, merely because they could keep their own, and were put in a\r\ncondition not to be robbed and plundered.\r\n\r\nThis did not hinder others from talking on without end. Some of your\r\nfine-spun faint-hearted thinking people declared, that they did not\r\nthink that John Bull or his sister could prosecute this scheme; it\r\nwas a fine one indeed, they said, but the brother and sister were now\r\ntoo old to think of such projects; a good warm bed, an elbow-chair,\r\nor a couch, a glass of cordial, or a bit of comfortable dinner, were\r\nproperer subjects for them to think of, than scrambling over hedges,\r\nlying out of nights, and dry blows: That game-keepers might be\r\ndangerous within doors, but that John had now no other chance to keep\r\noff roguish neighbours: That either his own game-keepers, or those of\r\nother people, would lay him in his grave at last: That it became him\r\nand his sister who had so many marks of age about them, rather to think\r\nof preparing themselves for the other world, than to talk of vapouring\r\nany longer in this. In short, there was no end of the impertinencies\r\nwhich were spoken in this strain, all giving Mrs. Bull a speedy\r\nprospect of widowhood, and turning her thoughts toward Sir Thomas, or\r\nsome other of your spruce young gallants.\r\n\r\nSome said it was lucky that John heard nothing of all this, for he was\r\nsometimes as jealous as ten furies, and if he had symptoms of age,\r\nhe had likewise remains of youth, which would have very ill brooked\r\nsuch insidious attacks on his honour. For our parts we wish that he\r\nhad heard every word of it, and had given the person who spoke so, a\r\nslap in the face; for we do not see what any body has to do putting\r\npeople in mind of their age, and we are very sure that John will not\r\ndie the sooner, for doing all he can to keep himself alive; and if he\r\nwas to die to-morrow, we would rather see him hearty and well while he\r\nlives, were it but for an hour, than moping and drooping his head, and\r\nin terror not only of what is to come in the other world, but even of\r\nevery fool who may think to tread upon him in this.\r\n\r\nNo sooner the rustling, whispering and hubbub which this speech had\r\noccasioned was over, then in steps a game-keeper, to tell how much\r\nbetter he could defend the house than any body else. For you must know\r\nthat the game-keepers were very angry, and treated John Bull as little\r\nbetter than a poacher, for pretending to keep a gun in his own house.\r\n\r\nHe told Mrs. Bull that her husband and his family were mere aukward\r\nlubbers, who never could get the strut nor the air of a game keeper to\r\nthe end of the world; that a man could not fight unless he gave his\r\nwhole time to it; and that unless a man could fight to purpose, he had\r\nbetter not fight at all.\r\n\r\nThis speech met with an answer too. It was said, that every body would\r\nfight till he ran away; that some people ran away sooner, and others\r\nlater; that nobody, however, could do it sooner than the game-keepers\r\nthemselves had done upon occasion; whether their manner of running\r\naway was better than any that John or his sister could attain, this\r\nspeaker would not pretend to say; but he saw no harm in letting them\r\nhave a gun in their hands now and then, to use them to it, in order\r\nthat they might stand as long as possible, if any body came to attack\r\nthem; and he could see no objection to this, unless it was said, that\r\npeople were the worse for being used to a firelock, and fought best\r\nwhen they knew nothing of the matter, which from what he had heard of\r\nnew hired game-keepers might possibly be the case; but that people\r\nwould probably not urge that argument; and for his part, he had always\r\nconsidered a previous use of arms, as an advantage in times of danger;\r\nand therefore, he thought that not only Mr. Bull, but his sister too,\r\nshould have as much of it, as was consistent with their situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n _How Mrs. =Bull= sat still and heard a great deal more on this\r\n subject._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot well tell how it happened, that although Mrs. Bull was\r\nconsidering only, what answer should be given to sister Peg’s letter,\r\nyet John’s own affairs were brought in head and shoulders, and it\r\nseemed as if people were afraid to hurt Peg, except through John’s\r\nsides. The truth was, that though some people did not like to see the\r\nhumour spreading, they did not chuse to stop it by objections peculiar\r\nto Peg, in which they could have been contradicted; and as the state of\r\ndisparity to her brother, in which she was put, could by no means be\r\nglossed over, they chose to keep away from it as far as possible, and\r\nspeak only in general terms, Peg’s clerks found themselves obliged to\r\ndo the same thing. One of them told Mrs. Bull, that he came there to\r\nsollicite a piece of justice for an aged parent, and was surprized to\r\nfind so many people ready to dissuade her from granting it.\r\n\r\nIf there are, says he, sufficient objections to the use of arms in a\r\nfamily, discontinue it in your own; if there are not, why disgrace one\r\npart of your house, by refusing what all mankind know to be the great\r\ndistinction between masters and slaves?\r\n\r\nI am surprized, however, to hear so much concerning the absolute\r\ninconveniencies of this measure. It may be inconvenient for a man to do\r\nany thing at all for his own defence; but if it be necessary for his\r\npreservation, to what purpose talk of inconveniencies? It is certainly\r\nmeant by people who speak in this strain, that the method now in\r\nquestion is more inconvenient than that by game-keepers, which is the\r\nonly other one that I have heard of. If this is their opinion, they\r\nshould have entered somewhat farther into the question, than at present\r\nthey appear to have done.\r\n\r\nThis family has been for some time in the practice of committing\r\ntheir defence intirely to a certain class of people, whom they call\r\ngame-keepers. Those are the only persons about the house, supposed to\r\nknow any thing at all of the use of arms; they are set apart from the\r\nrest of the family, and by their manner of life, are made to shake off\r\nall connection with them as much as possible; and this, I suppose,\r\nthat they may be at all times ready to go any where, or do any thing\r\nthat their profession may require, without any regret of their own, or\r\nincumbrance from other people.\r\n\r\nThey are taught, for the same reason, to obey their leader implicitly,\r\nand to know no law but his commands; to all which conditions they\r\nbind themselves for life; and in the mean time, do no work either in\r\nseed-time or harvest, but are fed at the expence of the family.\r\n\r\nThis, I apprehend, to be a very fair description of a game-keeper,\r\nas that profession is now maintained. Every body knows that Mr.\r\nBull has chosen this expedient with great reluctance. He was always\r\napprehensive, that whoever was master of the only arms in a house,\r\nmight soon become master of the house itself. The practice, however,\r\nstole upon him, and for ought I know he might have gone all lengths\r\nin the use of it, if he had not been ashamed of a sudden, to find\r\nhimself and all his family afraid to look any enemy in the face. He\r\nbethought himself of the wretched condition he must be in, either if\r\nhis game-keepers should turn against him, should desert him, or even\r\nbe out of the way at an unlucky time. And to fortify himself against\r\nthose calamities, he has distributed a certain quantity of arms among\r\nhis children; a certain number are to be named in their turns; to learn\r\nthe use of those arms, under the direction of a person, to whom all\r\nhis other affairs are so happily intrusted. The people who receive\r\nthis instruction live in the family, and mind their business, with the\r\nsingle interruption, which some days of practice, or necessary service\r\nmay occasion. When they have taken their turn, they leave that station\r\nto others, and live as before; with this only difference, that if the\r\nhouse is alarmed, they are readier to act a part, in which they have\r\nalready had some practice.\r\n\r\nWe have heard enough of the impossibility of putting this scheme in\r\nexecution; but, I think, it is found sufficiently practicable, when we\r\nwant to have somebody in place of the game-keepers, whom we employ so\r\nliberally elsewhere; and therefore, I shall not now say any thing at\r\nall upon that point.\r\n\r\nHas it then any inconveniencies which do not attend every other method\r\nof self-defence? The expence, the interruption of business, the trouble\r\nattending it, do certainly not exceed what is found of the same kind,\r\nin maintaining the profession of game-keepers. In point of expence, it\r\nis evident we can afford a much more numerous body of men in this way\r\nthan in any other, if instead of augmenting our game-keepers without\r\nend, to vie with our neighbours, we are satisfied with a moderate\r\nnumber in ordinary times, and prepare this resource for ourselves,\r\nagainst any sudden alarm.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the interruption of work, it must be allowed, that\r\nnobody can possibly work less than a game-keeper. To have so many\r\npeople idle in succession, or the same number of individuals idle for\r\ntheir whole lives, appears to me precisely the same thing, with this\r\nonly difference, that a game-keeper is idle, whether there be occasion\r\nto employ him in his profession or no, the other is not.\r\n\r\nAs for the trouble, I do not know any body who can have cause to\r\ncomplain of it, except Mr. Bull and his sister; and when they are\r\ntired, they will probably let it alone, without troubling your ladyship\r\nfor any orders about the matter.\r\n\r\nBut I find people of very solemn authority, who tell us that it is\r\ndangerous to trust the youth of a family with arms. That besides\r\nquarrelling among themselves, they will fly in the face of every body\r\nelse. That they may even drag your ladyship off that couch where you\r\nsit, and kick us your clerks down stairs. I should be glad to know\r\nfrom whom it is you are to fear these outrages; or if any body in\r\nreality was to offer them, to whom would you apply for protection,\r\nbut to those who call you their lawful superior and their parent. It\r\nis strange, that a parent should be supposed to have no hold in the\r\naffections of her own children, or that they who stand first in point\r\nof esteem and respect in the family, should be in danger of being\r\nmaltreated by those with whom they are so nearly connected. For my\r\npart, if the children of this family improve in their courage, their\r\nvigour, and their spirit, I expert to improve with them, and should\r\nbe ashamed to own, that I fear losing, in that case, the respect and\r\naffection, with which I am now received among my companions.\r\n\r\nAt any rate it seems it is owned, that we may quarrel among ourselves;\r\nand pray who is it we would have to be worsted, in case of such a\r\nquarrel? Can we foresee who will be in the right, that we may arm them,\r\nand nobody else? It seems, we are sure, the game-keeper, at least, will\r\nbe always in the right, since we are for keeping him perpetually armed,\r\nand for rendering all the rest as tame and helpless as possible, that\r\nhe may have the less trouble, or find them ready subdued to his hand.\r\nOr do those who alarm us with the fear of domestic quarrels, pretend\r\nthat the game-keeper will never quarrel with any body? I would gladly\r\navoid this subject, but the question is forced upon us. I honour the\r\nprofession of which I speak, and would often in my life have gladly\r\nembraced it. But when I was describing it to you, I thought that I was\r\npointing out the most dangerous quarter, into which the spirit of\r\ndomestic faction can come. Here is an order of men, who are always in\r\nreadiness to act, whose leader is always prepared; in possession at all\r\ntimes of great power, and at all times desirous of more. Other factions\r\nmay lurk under-ground in the seed, or spring into view to be crushed as\r\nthey appear. But this is at all times a full grown plant. There needs\r\nno giant to tear it from the roots, nor is there any great address\r\nrequired, with the help of this weapon, to confound and destroy all the\r\ncivil and domestic institutions of men.\r\n\r\nI speak not with a view to excite groundless jealousies; I speak in\r\nbehalf of an institution, which is now compleated in one part of the\r\nfamily, and which, if carried to the other, must prove our best\r\nsecurity against ill-designing men, from within, or from without, in\r\neither house. If it be an advantage where it is already established,\r\nI hope that your ladyship will not refuse to share it with an only\r\nsister, who would be glad to employ all her force in your service, and\r\nnow only claims her privilege as a piece of justice, from a person to\r\nwhom she has intrusted the management of her affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n_How =Bumbo= gave his evidence._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are far from commending the practice of certain historians, who\r\npretend to give the compleat speeches which were spoken many ages\r\nbefore, by leaders of armies, members of councils, and orators in\r\npopular assemblies; we maintain that nobody can do this, except the\r\ndevil, or some person to whom the speaker himself gave a copy of his\r\nharangue in writing. This not being our case, we content ourselves\r\nwith giving a few broken hints, such as we have been able to collect\r\nfrom the best authorities, in order to give our reader some notion of\r\nthe substance of what was said to Mrs. Bull upon this great occasion.\r\nWith respect to the contents of this chapter, indeed, we are singularly\r\nhappy, in having met with the memoirs of Suck-Fist, a very learned man\r\nof that age, who used to feed the game-keeper’s pointer, and being\r\npresent with Mrs. Bull on this occasion, has transmitted to posterity\r\nthe particulars of Bumbo’s appearance.\r\n\r\nBy him we are informed, that Bumbo, after all, was not put to his oath;\r\nthat the terrors of a formal oath approaching, he so explained what he\r\nhad said about the forgery, that it was not thought expedient to put\r\nhim to it in public; and the nurse thought it was better to hazard a\r\nspeech from him at large, which if the lady’s bowels could bear to an\r\nend, would at least show the world, that there was one of Peg’s own\r\npeople against granting her request.\r\n\r\nBumbo therefore appeared with this view, as no better could be made of\r\nit. Suck-Fist relates, that he began with declaring the instructions he\r\nhad got from Margaret, to second her application. He said, that for\r\nhis part it was his opinion, that nothing could be more reasonable than\r\nthe proposal she made; that if John Bull had arms in his house, or sent\r\nhis children to the fencing school for a month or two, there was no\r\nreason why Margaret should be hindered from doing the same thing; and\r\nthat there was nothing more desireable than to have every distinction\r\nbetween the two families abolished.\r\n\r\nWere not Suck-Fist a writer of good authority, both in point of\r\njudgment and veracity, we should be apt to question the following\r\nparticulars of his narration; they are so repugnant to what went\r\nbefore, and so totally void of sense or coherence, that not only we,\r\nbut all future historians will hesitate before they transcribe this\r\npart of his memoirs into their works. But as fiction is often more\r\nprobable than truth, we draw a presumption of veracity from the very\r\nwant of likelihood in the case, and are sure that such things could\r\nnever have come into any body’s head, if they had not been true. To\r\ndissuade Mrs. Bull from signing the order, which, it seems, was brought\r\nher ready written, relating to Peg’s people, he tells her, that it was\r\nexactly like that she had already given in her own house. He did not\r\npretend, at least in public, that the Geoffrites were many in Peg’s\r\nhouse, yet he would not even let Sir Thomas pick and chuse, but said,\r\nit was giving arms indiscriminately, to raise turbulent spirits. He\r\ncommended Mac Lurchar extremely, and said it was a pity to take him\r\noff his loom, except he was to be transported; that giving him arms\r\nwould spoil his hand as a weaver, and hinder his fighting, in which he\r\nhad behaved so gloriously, that he did not deserve to be discouraged,\r\nmuch less annihilated, till John had made up matters with Lewis Baboon.\r\nHe pointed at many bad consequences, that would attend employing Mac\r\nLurchar, for the defence of the house, such as spoiling a good weaver,\r\nand the like; but he insisted, that no distinction should be made\r\nbetween him and any body else, by pushing a line, or any other method\r\nthat could separate the house into two parts; I implore, beseech, and\r\nintreat, says he, that you would not push any such line across our\r\nhouse; let us all be treated alike, and if there be any of us who are\r\nnot in danger of being molested, or others who are not fit to carry\r\narms, let us all be refused them together, that nobody’s mind may be\r\nruffled, nor any heart-burnings be left, but those which do or may\r\nsubsist between John Bull himself and his worthy sister Margaret; they\r\nhave been used to more dust than any can raise between them, and can\r\nbear it all. He advised Mrs. Bull to do nothing at all in Peg’s house,\r\nlest she should forget something; when you have shown to us, that you\r\ncan remember every circumstance at once, then we will apply for your\r\ndirections, or devise a method of our own; and as Margaret has already\r\nborn the disgrace of this difference so long, I see no reason why she\r\nmay not bear it some time longer; her house can never be more open, or\r\nmore defenceless than it is now, nor her children less qualified to\r\nresist thieves; and I see no reason to hurry the supply of defects, to\r\nwhich she is now so well accustomed. He concluded by telling Mrs. Bull,\r\nwhat a dangerous thing it would be to give any orders in Peg’s house,\r\nwhen he was told that her ladyship was just going to give some fresh\r\norder in her own.\r\n\r\nThese particulars, posterity will no doubt admit upon the testimony\r\nof Suck-Fist; especially as he adds, that if any body shall say, that\r\nBumbo reasoned upon other principles, he is ready to contradict them,\r\nby saying it is not true. He subjoins, that Jowler paid him great\r\nrespect in speaking after him; and we ourselves know, that Small-Trash\r\nexclaimed, that he had gained immortal honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\n_How Mrs. =Bull= settled her stomach._\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bull, in the course of the foregoing speech, was observed by\r\nmany people to change colour, and before it was done, hartshorn-drops\r\nand smelling-bottles were produced in abundance. Every one said, that\r\nnobody but Jowler could settle her stomach, for he used to stun her\r\nsometimes, so as to take away the sense of every thing else, which has\r\noften been observed to have very good effects in trifling illnesses, by\r\ndrawing off the patient’s attention, as the fear of drowning will do in\r\nthe case of sea sickness, and blisters, caustics, and stimulusses, in\r\nthe case of other disorders. Jowler accordingly set to work with her:\r\nbut for want of the big words, with which he used to coax John Bull,\r\nand which he avoided now for reasons best known to himself, he could\r\nproduce nothing that day, but a maukish sort of stuff, that was little\r\nbetter than the warm water, which people are made to drink after a\r\nvomit.\r\n\r\nIn short, Mrs. Bull was up and just going, when one of Peg’s clerks\r\nbegged her not to be rash in dismissing a business, in which the\r\ninterest, the honour, and the preservation of her husband’s family,\r\nwere so deeply involved; he told her, that he was surprized, to find\r\nany objections made to the terms of the order that was laid before\r\nher, as they did not pretend to ask any more at that time, than that\r\nshe should appoint a day to consider that order, and correct it if\r\nshe thought proper; that if she refused that request, the whole world\r\nmust say, that she was determined to hear no reason on the subject,\r\nand would be left to suspect, that she had as little inclination to\r\nthe measure in Mr. Bull’s own house, as in his sister’s; for he had\r\nscarcely heard one argument, that was not equally strong against it in\r\nboth. That whether this was the case or no, he never could think the\r\nestablishment secure, whilst it reached only to one part of the family,\r\nnor the union between the two houses compleat, whilst some were treated\r\nlike step-children or bastards, and others like gentlemen and heirs to\r\nthe paternal estate.\r\n\r\nIt were painful, says he, to lay before you at large the iniquity\r\nof such a conduct, of which I believe you incapable; but if you are\r\ndisposed to hear what may be offered on the point in general, I have\r\nyet those impressions deeply rooted in my breast, which made me wish\r\nfor this establishent in your house, as the best security to your\r\nfortune, your honour, and your life. Impressions, which make me behold\r\nwith joy, the steps you have pursued, altho’ I am now reduced to the\r\nnecessity of begging as a favour, in behalf of a parent, what, on\r\nthe foot of equal treatment, she has a right to demand; and what, if\r\nrefused, must appear as a stain to her honour, and a mark of disparity\r\nwhich she was not born to endure. But her opposers have saved us the\r\ntrouble of enlarging on this topic, and wisely made it unnecessary to\r\nprove, what is already too plain.\r\n\r\nThe arguments are such as would make us believe, that every moment\r\nwhich is bestowed by individuals for the good of the public, is lost\r\nto that family for which it is bestowed. They talk of the advantage\r\nof private industry, but speak of every practice that connects an\r\nindividual in his views or affections with the family to which he\r\nbelongs, as an allurement to idleness and sloth. To act for the family,\r\nto defend it in times of peril, is the noblest office to which any\r\nindividual can aspire; and if he labours within your doors to heap up\r\nwealth, without having a soul capable of this office; you may call\r\nhim, indeed, a gainful property, but will scarcely show him among your\r\nchildren, when they come to appear before those who are judges of men.\r\nWho upon such an occasion would point out a sneaking mercenary selfish\r\ncoward, and call him his child? Yet such is the race which we are\r\ndesired to propagate, and such is the character which we are cautioned\r\nnot to corrupt.\r\n\r\nWe have heard from many the praise of industry, as if any body were\r\ninclined to dispute that praise. We have heard at large, the advantages\r\nof wealth, as if wealth and industry were inconsistent with the measure\r\nfor which we contend. From this source, say they, your store-houses and\r\nyour granaries are filled: let them tell us then from what source the\r\ndefence of our stores are to proceed? Will our wealth deter a rapacious\r\nenemy? Are the eagles intimidated, when they are told that the doves\r\nare fatter than they? No; but our wealth will hire a protector. Who\r\nthen will defend us against the protector whom we have hired? Is the\r\ngripe of a rapacious hireling less to be feared, than that of a rival\r\nat the gate? But our wealth, we are told, will enable us to maintain\r\na large and a numerous family. But what is it will render that family\r\nworth maintaining, or make the company of those numbers that we hear of\r\ndesirable? For my part, I never thought it a blessing to be placed in a\r\nmultitude of base, degenerate, and selfish men. If the people we live\r\nwith are vile, the more there are of them, just so much the worse.\r\n\r\nI have been surprised, therefore, to hear gentlemen speak of filling\r\na house with men, without ever mentioning the quality of those\r\nnumbers they mean to assemble; and speak of cloaths and food, as\r\nof consequence, whilst the character of him who is to use them is\r\nneglected. A little reflection will convince, that the soul of a\r\nman is of more value than his possessions, and that the happiness\r\nof individuals, as well as that of the families which they compose,\r\ndepends more on the generosity, justice and fortitude of their spirit,\r\nthan on the trappings in which they are cloathed, or the quantity\r\nof merchandize they sell to their neighbour. They, however, who\r\ncontend that the present measure is inconsistent with the success of\r\nindustry and traffic, throw these advantages into a light of greater\r\ncontempt, than I am disposed to do. We excell our predecessors in the\r\nart of procuring wealth; we excell them in the knowledge of domestick\r\noeconomy; why should we not excell them too in the skill and resolution\r\nto defend advantages, which so far exceed what they ever possessed?\r\n\r\nWithout we carry this quality along with us, other advantages are of\r\nlittle avail; wealth and affluence are but allurements to rapine; even\r\na disposition to gentleness, humanity and candour, but exposes the more\r\nto the assaults of others, and doth not secure the integrity of him who\r\ninherits it. If I contend with a knave in behalf of the innocent, and\r\ndare not stand the hazard of a contest when brought to extremes, my\r\nantagonist knows how to prevail from the first, for I shrink from the\r\ncountenance of a person who is hardier than I. I am prepared on the\r\nslightest trial to betray my friend, my brother, my father, and the\r\nhonour of my race. I am already formed for a slave, and hold my safety\r\nand my life by the tenor of another’s will. There is no vice, which may\r\nnot be grafted on cowardice, as successfully as upon avarice itself,\r\nthat other stock which we are so willing to cultivate.\r\n\r\nI shall be told that the people of this house are yet far removed\r\nfrom this despicable extreme. I hope they are, and that every assault\r\nof injustice would meet with a hardy and resolute opposition in the\r\nmembers of this family; but let us beware of the extremes, to which\r\nour maxims and our practices may finally carry us.\r\n\r\nWe educate a few only to the use of arms; them, indeed, we endeavour\r\nto inspire with courage and a contempt of danger, but we endeavour\r\nat the same time, by throwing them into a separate way of life, to\r\nweaken their connection with the family, and to stifle the sentiments\r\nof filial tenderness and respect, under the load of artificial\r\nsubordinations, to which they are bound for life. The familiar use\r\nof arms may fortify the breast; but more is required to accomplish a\r\nfaithful and dutiful child, a tender, a generous affection, to that\r\nparent, whom he is bound to defend.\r\n\r\nThe flower and choice of our young men, croud into the profession of\r\nwhich I speak: for what station is more desireable to a man of spirit,\r\nthan one in which he can exert the native vigor of his mind, and stand\r\nin the light of a protection and defence to his father’s house? They\r\nplace themselves in this station with a glowing and ardent mind, but\r\ntheir continuance in it seldom fails to extinguish or depress those\r\nsentiments, and leave no impression but that of a servile dependance on\r\nthe persons under whose directions they are placed.\r\n\r\nWhilst we thus educate one part of the family, the remainder, we say,\r\nare left to cultivate pacific arts; and those arts must be pacific\r\nindeed, which render the ability of self-defence unnecessary, by which\r\nmen are made tools to procure the means of life, and are scarcely\r\nput in mind, that they have a right to defend the privileges of men,\r\nagainst all who shall presume to attack them. The former are bred\r\nto commit acts of violence, in cold blood, the latter to bear them\r\nwith a tame and dejected soul. Did we resolve to try what the utmost\r\ncorruption could do, to debase, to sink and destroy a race of men, a\r\nmore ingenious contrivance could not be found than this we are disposed\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of one man, it seems, to think of nothing but\r\nquarrels and violence; to another, it is not even permitted to defend\r\nhimself. In this hopeful partition of your children, where are you to\r\nfind the generous, the manly, and the dutiful spirit, equally prepared\r\nfor times of quiet and of trouble? A spirit, which the suspension\r\neven of domestic government will not discompose, but which can, by a\r\nwell-directed resolution and vigor, restore that order, which it is so\r\nwell qualified to adorn and maintain.\r\n\r\nIf we would have any vestige of such spirit remain among us, let those\r\nwho have the habits and affections of children, be likewise endowed\r\nwith the force of men; let those who call you parent be inspired with a\r\nresolution to stand by you in all your distresses and difficulties; and\r\nwhilst they enjoy the privileges and immunities of children, be taught\r\nto know that it is their duty to defend them.\r\n\r\nI was always fond of the measure now under consideration, because it\r\naimed at producing those happy effects. You need not be told in what\r\nmanner it tends to produce them, for your family has already gained\r\nstrength by pursuing it; and I feel with pleasure, the hopes of a\r\ngallant and happy race of men, likely to continue in this house. But\r\nlet not so wise a measure be partially pursued; let not one part of\r\nyour race be doomed to baseness and servility, whilst the other is\r\nformed to elevation and honour. One rotten member is sometimes found to\r\nspread corruption over the whole, and a lurking humour in one corner,\r\nto destroy the soundest constitution.\r\n\r\nYour wisest establishments, when confined to a part, may perish for\r\nwant of that emulation, which, when all are equally engaged, must\r\nkindle the ardor and spirits of generous minds. And the implements of\r\nslavery may one day be brought from that corner, to which you now deny\r\nthe privileges of free-men. Into other families we have heard that a\r\nmaster has come, who turned his dwelling into a jail, where nothing\r\nis heard but the clank of chains, and the crashing of iron bars. He\r\nhimself is distinguished by the gloomy depression of his look; the\r\nwhip, which he holds in his hand, and the instruments of death which\r\nare carried before him. But where are the ministers of his cruel\r\npurpose to be found? They are purchased with gold in those obscure\r\ncorners of his neighbourhood, where every man that is born is a slave.\r\n\r\nIt has been the practice of other families to condemn a particular race\r\nto servile purposes. Their names were never reckoned in the list of the\r\nfamily, their numbers never estimated as any part of their strength.\r\nFor they were such as by their crimes deserved no better treatment; or\r\nby the baseness and servility of their minds, had naturally sunk into\r\nthis station.
